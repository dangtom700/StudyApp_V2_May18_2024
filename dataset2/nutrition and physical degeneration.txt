HE gracious reception given to my several reports of field studies 
among primitive racial groups and the many requests for copies of 
those brief reports and for further data, together with the need for pro￾viding interpretations and applications of the data, have induced me to 
consolidate my investigations. There have also been many requests from 
my patients and from members of the medical and dental professions for 
concise statements as to what I have found that would be useful as pre￾ventive procedures. In addition I have been conscious of an opportunity 
for helpfulness to the members of the various primitive races that I have 
studied and who are so rapidly declining in health and numbers at their 
point of contact with our modern civilization. Since they have so much 
accumulated wisdom that is passing with them, it has seemed important 
that the elements in the modern contacts that are so destructive to them 
should be discovered and removed. 
There has been a deep sense of obligation to the officials of many 
countries for the great kindness and assistance that they have so cheer￾fully given by providing the opportunity for these investigations. The 
list of these individuals is much too long to mention them all by name. 
One of the joys of my work has been the privilege of knowing the mag￾nificent characters that are at the outposts earnestly striving to better the 
welfare of the natives whom they are ministering to, but who are dis￾traught with the recognition that under the modernization program the 
natives decline in health and become afflicted by our modern types of 
degenerative diseases. It would be fortunate if each of these field workers 
could be provided with a copy of this report which they have helped to 
make possible. 
In order to make this information available to as wide a group as pos￾sible, I have avoided technical language and will ask the indulgence of 
professional readers. 
There are some individuals whose assistance I must acknowledge 
specifically: Reverend Father John Siegen and Doctor Alfred Gysi of 
Switzerland; Mrs. Lulu Herron and Doctor J. Romig of Alaska; the 
Indian Department at Ottawa; the Department of Indian Affairs at 
Washington, D. C.; the officials of the eight archipelagos studied in the 
Pacific; Colonel J. L. Saunders of New Zealand; the Minister of Health,

constructive suggestions and cooperation. To these and a host of others 
I am deeply indebted and profoundly grateful. 
WeEsTON A. PRICE 
8926 Euclid Avenue, 
Cleveland, Ohio, 1938. FOREWORD 
HERE is nothing new in the observation that savages, or peoples 
living under primitive conditions, have, in general, excellent teeth. 
This fact is a matter of record based upon casual examinations of con￾temporary primitives made by travellers, explorers, and scientists, and 
established with better documentation by the studies of teeth preserved 
in skeletal collections of savages recently or more remotely extinct. Nor 
is it news that most civilized populations possess wretched teeth which 
begin to decay almost before they have erupted completely, and that 
dental caries is likely to be accompanied by periodontal disease with 
further reaching complications. Indeed this has been a matter of grave 
concern to the dental profession for more than a generation, and rightly 
so. A great deal of elaborate and patient research and experimentation 
has been expended upon this problem of the etiology and control of 
dental caries, but I do not suppose that anyone would claim that it has 
been solved. At any rate, the dentists are still busily engaged in drilling 
our cavities and in plugging them. A quantity of excellent evidence has 
been amassed which indicates that dental caries is, to a great extent, con￾nected with malnutrition and with deficient diets. 
Since we have known for a long time that savages have excellent teeth 
and that civilized men have terrible teeth, it seems to me that we have 
been extraordinarily stupid in concentrating all of our attention upon 
the task of finding out why our teeth are so poor, without ever bothering 
to learn why savage teeth are good. Dr. Weston Price seems to be the only 
person who possesses the scientific horse sense to supplement his knowl￾edge of the probable causes of dental disease with a study of the dietary 
regimens which are associated with dental health. In other words, Dr. 
Price has accomplished one of those epochal pieces of research which 
make every other investigator desirous of kicking himself because he 
never thought of doing the same thing. This is an exemplification of the 
fact that really gifted scientists are those who can appreciate the obvious. 
So Dr. Price has found out why primitive men have good teeth and 
why their teeth go bad when they become “civilized.” But he has not 
stopped there: he has gone on to apply his knowledge acquired from 
savages to the problems of their less intelligent civilized brothers. For I 
think that we must admit that if savages know enough to eat the things 
Xvi XVIll FOREWORD 
which keep their teeth healthy, they are more intelligent in dietary mat￾ters than we are. So I consider that Dr. Price has written what is often 
called “a profoundly significant book.” The principal difference between 
Dr. Price’s work and many others so labelled is that in the present in￾stance the designation happens to be correct. I salute Dr. Price with the 
sincerest admiration (the kind that is tinged with envy) because he has 
found out something which I should like to have discovered for myself.

Harvard University, 
November 21, 1938. NUTRITION AND 
PHYSICAL DEGENERATION INTRODUCTION 
HIS text provides a new approach to some problems of modern 
degeneration. Instead of the customary procedure of analyzing the 
expressions of degeneration, a search has been made for groups to be used 
as controls who are largely free from these affections. 
After spending several years approaching this problem by both clinical 
and laboratory research methods, I interpreted the accumulating evi￾dence as strongly indicating the absence of some essential factors from 
our modern program, rather than the presence of injurious factors. This 
immediately indicated the need for obtaining controls. To accomplish 
this it became necessary to locate immune groups which were found 
readily as isolated remnants of primitive racial stocks in different parts 
of the world. A critical examination of these groups revealed a high 
immunity to many of our serious affections so long as they were sufh￾ciently isolated from our modern civilization and living in accordance 
with the nutritional programs which were directed by the accumulated 
wisdom of the group. In every instance where individuals of the same 
racial stocks who had lost this isolation and who had adopted the foods 
and food habits of our modern civilization were examined, there was an 
early loss of the high immunity characteristics of the isolated group. 
These studies have included a chemical analysis of foods of the isolated 
groups and also of the displacing foods of our modern civilization. 
These investigations have been made among the following primitive 
racial stocks including both isolated and modernized groups: the Swiss 
of Switzerland, the Gaelics in the Outer and Inner Hebrides, the Eskimos 
of Alaska, the Indians in the far North, West and Central Canada, 
Western United States and Florida, the Melanesians and Polynesians on 
eight archipelagos of the Southern Pacific, tribes in eastern and central 
Africa, the Aborigines of Australia, Malay tribes on islands north of 
Australia, the Maori of New Zealand and the ancient civilizations and 
their descendants in Peru both along the coast and in the Sierras, also in 
the Amazon Basin. Where available the modernized whites in these com￾munities also were studied. 
There have been many important unexpected developments in these 
investigations. While a primary quest was to find the cause of tooth 
decay which was established quite readily as being controlled directly by 
nutrition, it rapidly became apparent that a chain of disturbances devel￾1 2 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
oped in these various primitive racial stocks starting even in the first 
generation after the adoption of the modernized diet and rapidly in￾creased in severity with expressions quite constantly like the character￾istic degenerative processes of our modern civilization of America and 
Europe. While tooth decay has proved to be almost entirely a matter of 
the nutrition of the individual at the time and prior to the activity of 
that disease, a group of affections have expressed themselves in physical 
form. These have included facial and dental arch changes which, hereto￾fore, have been accounted for as results of admixtures of different racial 
stocks. My investigations have revealed that these same divergencies 
from normal are reproduced in all these various racial stocks while the 
blood is still pure. Indeed, these even develop in those children of the 
family that are born after the parents adopted the modern nutrition. 
Applying these methods of study to our American families, we find 
readily that a considerable percentage of our families show this same 
deterioration in the younger members. The percentage of individuals so 
affected in our American communities in which I have made studies 
varies through a wide range, usually between 25 per cent to 75 per cent. 
A certain percentage of this affected group has not only these evidences 
of physical injury, but also personality disturbances, the most common 
of which is a lower than normal mental efficiency and acuteness, chiefly 
observed as so-called mental backwardness which includes the group of 
children in the schools who are unable to keep up with their classmates. 
Their I. Q.’s are generally lower than normal and they readily develop 
inferiority complexes growing out of their handicap. From this group or 
parallel with it a certain percentage develop personality disturbances 
which have their expression largely in unsocial traits. They include the 
delinquents who at this time are causing so much trouble and concern 
because of evidence of increase in their numbers. This latter group has 
been accounted for largely on the basis of some conditioning experience 
that developed after the child had reached an impressionable age. My 
investigations are revealing a physical structural change and therefore, 
an organic factor which precedes and underlies these conditioning influ￾ences of the environment. The fact that a government survey has shown 
that 66 per cent of the delinquents who have been treated in the best 
institutions and released as cured, later have developed their unsocial or 
criminal tendencies, strongly emphasizes the urgent necessity that if 
preventive methods are to be applied these must precede and forestall 
the primary injuries themselves. 
While it has been known that certain injuries were directly related to 
an inadequate nutrition of the mother during the formative period of INTRODUCTION > 
the child, my investigations are revealing evidence that the problem goes 
back still further to defects in the germ plasms as contributed by the two 
parents. These injuries, therefore, are related directly to the physical 
condition of one or of both of these individuals prior to the time that 
conception took place. 
A very important phase of my investigations has been the obtaining 
of information from these various primitive racial groups indicating 
that they were conscious that such injuries would occur if the parents 
were not in excellent physical condition and nourishment. Indeed, in 
many groups I found that the girls were not allowed to be married until 
after they had had a period of special feeding. In some tribes a six 
months period of special nutrition was required before marriage. An 
examination of their foods has disclosed special nutritional factors which 
are utilized for this purpose. 
The scope of this work, accordingly, becomes of direct interest in 
many fields including the various branches of the healing arts, particu￾larly medicine and dentistry, and the social organizations that are con￾cerned with betterment of the racial stock. Similarly, the educational 
groups are concerned directly since, if we are to stem the tide by passing 
new information on to the parents of the new generation, it must. be 
done prior to the time the emergency shall arise. This involves a system 
of education directed particularly to the high school age pupils. 
The data that are being presented in the following chapters suggest 
the need for reorientation in many problems of our modern social or￾ganization. The forces involved in heredity have in general been deemed 
to be so powerful as to be able to resist all impacts and changes in the 
environment. These data will indicate that much that we have inter￾preted as being due to heredity is really the result of intercepted heredity. 
While great emphasis has been placed on the influence of the environ￾ment on the character of the individual, the body pattern has generally 
been supposed to require a great number of impacts of a similar nature 
to alter the design. The brain has been assumed to be similarly. well 
organized in most individuals except that incidents in the life of the 
individual such as disappointments, fright, etc., are largely responsible 
for disturbed behavior. Normal brain functioning has not been thought 
of as being as biologic as digestion. The data provided in the succeeding 
chapters indicate that associated with disturbances in the development 
of the bones of the head, disturbances may at the same time occur in the 
development of the brain. Such structural defects usually are not heredi￾tary factors even though they appear in other members of the family or 4 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
parents. They are products of the environment rather than hereditary 
units transmitted from the ancestry. 
In the light of these data important new emphasis is placed on the 
quality of the germ cells of the two parents as well as on the environment 
provided by the mother. The new evidence indicates that the paternal 
contribution may be an injured product and that the responsibility for 
defective germ cells may have to be about equally divided between the 
father and mother. The blending of races has been blamed for much of 
the distortion and defects in body form in our modern generation. It 
will be seen that these face changes occur in all the pure blood races 
studied in even the first generation, after the nutrition of the parents 
has been changed. 
The origin of personality and character appear in the light of the 
newer data to be biologic products and to a much less degree than usu￾ally considered pure hereditary traits. Since these various factors are 
biologic, being directly related to both the nutrition of the parents and 
‘to the nutritional environment of the individuals in the formative and 
growth period any common contributing factor such as food deficiencies 
due to soil depletion will be seen to produce degeneration of the masses 
of people due to a common cause. Mass behavior therefore, in this new 
light becomes the result of natural forces, the expression of which may 
not be modified by propaganda but will require correction at the source. 
Nature has been at this process of building human cultures through 
many millenniums and our culture has not only its own experience to 
draw from but that of parallel races living today as well as those who 
lived in the past. This work, accordingly, includes data that have been 
obtained from several of Nature’s other biologic experiments to throw 
light on the problems of our modern white civilization. 
In presenting the evidence I am utilizing photographs very liberally. 
A good illustration is said to be equivalent to a thousand words of text. 
This is in keeping too with the recent trend in journalism. The pictures 
are much more convincing than words can be, and since the text chal￾lenges many of the current theories, the most conclusive evidence 
available is essential. 
Owing to the many requests received for slides or the loan of my 
negatives, provision is being made for supplying a limited number of 
slides of the illustrations in either black and white or in color. Slides of 
other subjects are available. Chapter i 
WHY SEEK WISDOM FROM PRIMITIVE PEOPLES 
OME of the primitive races have avoided certain of the life problems 
faced by modernized groups and the methods and knowledge used 
by the primitive peoples are available to assist modernized individuals in 
solving their problems. Many primitive races have made habitual use of 
certain preventive measures in meeting crucial life problems. 
Search for controls among remnants of primitive racial stocks has been 
resorted to as a result of failure to find them in our modernized groups 
or to find the controlling factors by applying laboratory methods to the 
affected clinical material. Only the primitive groups have been able to 
provide adequate normal controls. . 
In the following chapters, I have presented descriptions of certain 
peoples and their environments in primitive state, and, for comparative 
study, descriptions of members of the primitive tribes who have been in 
contact with modernized white races. I have recorded the effects of that 
contact as expressed in physical and character changes, and have given a 
survey of the factors in the environment which have changed. It has 
been necessary to study in this way a wide variety of primitive groups 
and physical environments. It will, accordingly, be advisable for the 
reader to keep in mind the comparative effects of different altitudes, 
latitudes, temperatures and races, and to note the similarity of the reac￾tions of these primitive groups when contact is made with our modern 
civilization. The purpose is to glean data that will be applicable for use 
in correcting certain tragic expressions of our modern degeneration, 
including tooth decay, general physical degeneration, and facial and 
dental-arch deformities, and character changes. These data will be useful 
in preventing race decay and deformities, in establishing a higher re￾sistance to infective diseases, and in reducing the number of prenatal 
deficiency injuries. These latter include such expressions as mental de￾ficiencies caused by brain defects in the formative period, which result 
in mental disturbances ranging from moderate backwardness to char￾acter abnormalities. 
The data presented show the level of susceptibility to dental caries 
(tooth decay) in each isolated primitive group and, contrasted with that, 
5 6 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
the level of susceptibility in the modernized natives of the same stock. 
A résumé of the changes in the environment that are associated with 
the changes in immunity and susceptibility will be presented. These data 
reveal an average increase in susceptibility of thirty-five fold. Similar 
contrasts are shown in relation to the relative incidence of facial and 
dental arch deformities among primitive natives and modernized natives. 
It will be easy for the reader to be prejudiced since many of the appli￾cations suggested are not orthodox. I suggest that conclusions be deferred 
until the new approach has been used to survey the physical and mental 
status of the reader’s own family, of his brothers and sisters, of associated 
families, and finally, of the’mass of people met in business and on the 
street. Almost everyone who studies the matter will be surprised that 
such clear-cut evidence of a decline in modern reproductive efficiency 
could be all about us and not have been previously noted and reviewed. 
It is important to preface the observations by constructing a mental 
pattern of physical excellence from the pictures of the various primitive 
groups and, with this yardstick or standard of normalcy, observe our 
modern patterns. Certain preconceived ideas may have to be modified, 
as for example, that based on the belief that what we see is due to 
heredity or that deformity is due to mixing of races. If so, why should 
the last child in a large family generally suffer most, and often be dif￾ferent in facial form; or why should there be these changes in the later 
children, even in pure racial stocks, after the parents have adopted our 
modern types of nutrition? 
Although the causes of physical degeneration that can be seen easily 
have been hard to trace, the defects in the development of the brain, 
which affect the mind and character, are much more obscure, and the 
causes of mental degeneration are exceedingly difficult to trace. Much 
that formerly has been left to the psychiatrist to explain is now rapidly 
shifting to the realm of the anatomist and physiologist. 
Those contributions of the past cultures which have blended agree￾ably into our modern experience have been accepted with too little ques￾tioning. Much ancient wisdom, however, has been rejected because of 
prejudice against the wisdom of so-called savages. Some readers may 
experience this reaction to the primitive wisdom recorded in these 
chapters. 
The writer is fully aware that his message is not orthodox; but since 
our orthodox theories have not saved us we may have to readjust them 
to bring them into harmony with Nature’s laws. Nature must be obeyed, 
not orthodoxy. Apparently many primitive races have understood her 
language better than have our- modernized groups. Even the ‘primitive WISDOM OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES 7 
races share our blights when they adopt our conception of nutrition. 
The supporting evidence for this statement is voluminous and as much 
of it as space permits is included in this volume. The illustrative material 
used is taken from the many thousands of my negatives which are avail￾able. Photographs alone can tell much of the story, and one illustration 
is said to be worth as much as one thousand words. 
Since the problem of applying the wisdom of the primitives to our 
modern needs concerns not only health workers and nutritionists, but 
also educators and social workers, the data are presented without techni￾cal details. 
While many of the primitive races studied have continued to thrive 
on the same soil through thousands of years, our American human stock 
has declined rapidly within a few centuries, and in some localities within 
a few decades. In the regions in which degeneration has taken place the 
animal stock has also declined. A decadent individual cannot regenerate 
himself, although he can reduce the progressive decadence in the next 
generation, or can vastly improve that generation, by using the demon￾strated wisdom of the primitive races. No era in the long journey of 
mankind reveals in the skeletal remains such a terrible degeneration of 
teeth and bones as this brief modern period records. Must Nature reject 
our vaunted culture and call back the more obedient primitives? The 
alternative seems to be a complete readjustment in accordance with the - 
controlling forces of Nature. 
Thinking is as biologic as is digestion, and brain embryonic defects are 
as biologic as are club feet. Since both are readily produced by lowered 
parental reproductive capacity, and since Nature in her large-scale hu￾man demonstration reveals that this is chiefly the result of inadequate 
nutrition of the parents and too frequent or too prolonged child bearing, 
the way back is indicated. Like the successful primitive racial stocks, we, 
too, can make, as a first requisite, provision for adequate nutrition both 
for generation and growth, and can make provision for the regulation 
of the overloads. We, like the successful primitives, can establish pro￾grams of instruction for growing youth and acquaint it with Nature’s 
requirements long before the emergencies and stresses arise. This may 
require a large-scale program of home and classroom instruction, par￾ticularly for the high school girls and boys. This would be in accordance 
with the practice of many of the primitive races reported upon in the 
following chapters. 
If the individuals in our modern society who are sufficiently defective 
to require some supervision are in part or largely the product of an in￾jured parentage, who should be held responsible? Is it just for society to 8 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
consign these unsocial individuals which it has made to a life of hard 
labor or confinement in depressing environments? Is it just for society 
to permit production of physical and mental cripples? 
Many primitive races apparently have prevented the distortions which 
find expressions in unsocial acts. If so, cannot modern society do this by 
studying and adopting the programs developed through centuries of 
experience by the primitives? 
Nature uses a written language which, without the keys, is made up 
of meaningless hieroglyphics, but which, with the proper keys, becomes 
a clear story of racial and individual history. The hieroglyphics indicate 
racial and individual disaster for modernized groups who heed not the 
warning story. The primitive races have some of these keys and have 
used them successfully in avoiding many of the disasters of our modern 
society. The following chapters record many of the excellent practices 
of the primitives and they are presented here with the hope that they 
will be helpful in a program designed to relieve mankind of some of the 
misfortunes common in the present social order and to prevent disorders 
for future generations of civilized peoples. Chapter 2 
THE PROGRESSIVE DECLINE OF MODERN CIVILIZATION 
HAT modern man is declining in physical fitness has been empha￾sized by many eminent sociologists and other scientists. That the 
rate of degeneration is progressively accelerating constitutes a cause for 
great alarm, particularly since this is taking place in spite of the advance 
that is being made in modern science along many lines of investigation. 
Dr. Alexis Carrel in his treatise “Man, the Unknown” states: 
Medicine is far from having decreased human sufferings as much as it en￾deavors to make us believe. Indeed, the number of deaths from infectious diseases 
has greatly diminished. But we still must die in a much larger proportion from 
degenerative diseases. 
After reviewing the reduction in the epidemic infectious diseases he 
continues as follows: 
All diseases of bacterial origin have decreased in a striking manner... . 
Nevertheless, in spite of the triumphs of medical science, the problem of disease 
is far from solved. Modern man is delicate. Eleven hundred thousand persons 
have to attend the medical needs of 120,000,000 other persons. Every year, 
among this population of the United States, there are about 100,000,000 ill￾nesses, serious or slight. In the hospitals, 700,000 beds are occupied every day 
of the year. . . . Medical care, under all its forms, costs about $3,500,000,000 
yearly. . . . The organism seems to have become more susceptible to degenera￾tive diseases. 
The present health condition in the United States is reported from 
time to time by several agencies representing special phases of the health 
program. The general health problem has been thoroughly surveyed and 
interpreted by the Surgeon General of the United States Public Health 
Service, Dr. Parran. Probably no one is so well informed in all of the 
phases of health as is the head of this important department of the gov￾ernment. In his recent preliminary report’ to state and local officers for 
their information and guidance, he presented data that have been gath￾ered by a large group of government workers. The report includes a 
census of the health conditions of all the groups constituting the popula￾tion of the United States—records of the health status and of the eco￾9 10 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
nomic status of 2,660,000 individuals living in various sections, in vari￾ous types of communities, on various economic levels. The data include 
records on every age-group. He makes the following interpretations 
based upon the assumption that the 2,660,000 offer a fair sampling of 
the population, and he indicates the conclusions which may be drawn 
regarding conditions of status for the total population of some 130,- 
000,000 people. 
Every day one out of twenty people is too sick to go to school or work, or at￾tend his customary activities. 
Every man, woman and child (on the average) in the nation suffers ten days 
of incapacity annually. 
The average youngster is sick in bed seven days of the year, the average 
oldster 35 days. 
Two million five hundred thousand people (42 per cent of the 6,000,000 sick 
every day) suffer from chronic diseases—heart disease, hardening of the arteries, 
rheumatism, and nervous diseases. 
Sixty-five thousand people are totally deaf; 75,000 more are deaf and dumb; 
200,000 lack a hand, arm, foot or leg; 300,000 have permanent spinal injuries; 
§00,000 are blind; 1,000,000 more are permanent cripples. 
Two persons on the Relief income level (less than $1,000 yearly income for 
the entire family) are disabled for one week or longer for every one person better 
off economically. 
Only one in 250 family heads in the income group of more than $2,000 
yearly cannot seek work because of chronic disability. In Relief families one in 
every 20 family heads is disabled. 
Relief and low-income families are sick longer as well as more often than 
better-financed families. They call doctors less often. But the poor, especially in 
big cities, get to stay in hospitals longer than their better-off neighbors. 
Concluded Dr. Parran: 
It is apparent that inadequate diet, poor housing, the hazards of occupation and 
the instability of the labor market definitely create immediate health problems. 
It will be seen from this report that the group expressed as oldsters, 
who spend on an average thirty-five days per year in bed, are sick in bed 
one-tenth of the time. Those of us who are well, who may have been so 
fortunate as to spend very little time in bed, will contemplate this fact 
with considerable concern since it expresses a vast amount of suffering 
and enforced idleness. It is clear that so great an incidence of morbidity 
must place a heavy load upon those who at the time are well. The prob￾lem of the progressive increase in percentage of individuals affected with 
heart disease and cancer is adequate cause for alarm. Statistics have been 
published by the Department of Public Health in New York City which DECLINE OF MODERN CIVILIZATION 11 
show the increase in the incidence of heart disease to have progressed 
steadily during the years from 1907 to 1936. The figures provided in 
their report reveal an increase from 203.7 deaths per 100,000 in 1907 to 
327.2 per 100,000 in 1936. This constitutes an increase of 60 per cent. 
Cancer increased 90 per cent from 1907 to 1936. 
That this problem of serious degeneration of our modern civilization 
is not limited to the people of the United States has been commented on 
at length by workers in many countries. Sir Arbuthnot Lane, one of 
England’s distinguished surgeons, and a student of public welfare, has 
made this comment:° 
Long surgical experience has proved to me conclusively that there is some￾thing radically and fundamentally wrong with the civilized mode of life, and 
I believe that unless the present dietetic and health customs of the White 
Nations are reorganized, social decay and race deterioration are inevitable. 
The decline in white population that is taking place in many commu￾nities throughout several countries illustrates the widespread working of 
the forces that are responsible for this degeneration. In discussing this 
matter in its relation to Australia, S. R. Wolstenhole,’® lecturer in eco￾nomics at Sydney University, predicts that: 
A decline in Australia’s population is inevitable within 40 years because of 
the absence of a vigorous population policy. 
Students of our modern social problems are recognizing that these 
problems are not limited to health conditions which we have been accus￾tomed .to think of as bodily diseases. This is illustrated in a recent 
discussion by Will Durant:* 
. The American people are face to face with at least 4 major and militant 
problems that have to do with the continuity and worthwhile progress of modern 
civilization: 
1. The threatened deterioration of our stock. 
2. The purchasing power of our people must rise as fast as the power to 
procure. ... 
3. The third problem is moral. A civilization depends upon morals for a 
"social and governmental order. . . . 
4. The sources of statesmanship are drying up... . 
Dental caries or tooth decay is recognized as affecting more individuals 
throughout the so- called’ civilized world today than any other affection. 
In the United States, England ‘and Europe examinations of highly mod￾ernized groups, consisting of several million individuals, reveal the fact 
that from 85 to 100 per cent of the individuals in various communities 12 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
are suffering from this affection. As a contributing factor to absence 
from school among children it leads all other affections. From the stand￾point of injury to health, it has been estimated by many to be the most 
serious contributing factor through its involvement of other organs of 
the body. The Honorable J. A. Young, Minister of Health of New Zea￾land, strongly emphasized that the insidiousness of the effect of dental 
disease lies in the fact that it is the forerunner of other far-reaching dis￾turbances and he has referred to the seriousness with which it is viewed 
in England as follows: ‘Sir George Newman, Principal Medical Officer 
of the Ministry of Health in Great Britain, has said that ‘dental disease 
is one of the chief, if not the chief, cause of the ill health of the people.’ ” 
Dr. Earnest A. Hooton, of Harvard University, has emphasized the 
importance of oral sepsis and the task of stopping tooth decay. In closing 
Chapter VII of his recent book “Apes, Men and Morons,” he states the 
case as follows: 
I firmly believe that the health of humanity is at stake, and that, unless steps 
are taken to discover preventives of tooth infection and correctives of dental 
deformation, the course of human evolution will lead downward to extinc￾tion. . . . The facts that we must face are, in brief, that human teeth and the 
human mouth have become, possibly under the influence of civilization, the foci 
of infections that undermine the entire bodily health of the species and that de￾generative tendencies in evolution have manifested themselves in modern man 
to such an extent that our jaws are too small for the teeth which they are sup￾posed to accommodate, and that, as a consequence, these teeth erupt so irregu￾larly that their fundamental efficiency is often entirely or nearly destroyed. 
In discussing the strategic situation of dental science, Dr. Hooton states: 
In my opinion there is one and only one course of action which will check 
the increase: of dental disease and degeneration which may ultimately cause the 
extinction of the human species. This is to elevate the dental profession to a 
plane on which it can command the services of our best research minds to study 
the causes and seek for the cures of these dental evils. . . . The dental prac￾titioner should equip himself to become the agent of an intelligent control of 
human evolution, insofar as it is affected by diet. Let us go to the ignorant 
savage, consider his way of eating, and be wise. Let us cease pretending that 
tooth-brushes and tooth-paste are any more important than shoe-brushes and 
shoe-polish. It is store food which has given us store teeth. 
Students of history have continually commented upon the superior 
teeth of the so-called savages including the human types that have pre￾ceded our modernized groups. While dental caries has been found occa￾sionally in several animal species through the recent geologic ages, the 
teeth of the human species have been comparatively free from dental DECLINE OF MODERN CIVILIZATION 13 
caries. Primitive human beings have been freer from the disease than has 
contemporary animal life. This absence of tooth decay among primitive 
races has been so striking a characteristic of human kind that many 
commentators have referred to it as a strikingly modern disease. 
Dryer,® in discussing dental caries in the pre-historic South Africans, 
makes this comment: 
In not one of a very large collection of teeth from skulls obtained in the 
Matjes River Shelter (Holocene) was there the slightest sign of dental caries. 
The indication from this area, therefore, bears out the experience of European 
anthropologists that caries is a comparatively modern disease and that no skull 
showing this condition can be regarded as ancient. 
In connection with the studies reported in this volume, it is of par￾ticular importance that a desire to find the cause of dental caries was the 
primary reason for undertaking these investigations. Since it was ex￾ceedingly difficult to find in our modern social organization any large 
group with relatively high immunity to dental caries, a search was made 
for such control groups among remnants of primitive racial stocks that 
could also be examined at the point of contact with modern civilization 
in order that the changes associated with their racial loss of immunity 
might be noted. Probably few problems with which our modern social 
groups are concerned have been so inadequately understood not only by 
the laity, but by the members of the medical and dental professions as 
has this problem of the cause of dental caries. 
The problem of correcting dental arch deformities and thereby im￾proving facial form has developed a specialty in dentistry known as 
“orthodontia.” The literature dealing with the cause of facial deformi￾ties is now voluminous. The blending of racial stocks that differ radically 
in facial form has been said by many to be the chief factor contributing 
to the creation of deformities of the face. Crowded teeth have been said 
to be due to the inheritance of the large teeth of one parent and the 
small bone formation of the other and that such inheritances would 
provide dental arches that are too small for the teeth that have been made 
for them. A more general explanation for certain types of deformity, 
particularly for the protruding of the upper teeth over the lower, is that 
they result from thumb sucking, which tends to bring the upper arch 
forward and to depress the lower. Among the other contributing factors 
named have been faulty sleeping and breathing habits. To these has been 
assigned much of the blame. This problem of facial form, as well as that 
of bodily design, including dental arch design, is so directly a problem of 
growth, not only of individuals, but of races themselves, that certain 14 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
laws have been very definitely worked out by physical anthropologists 
as laws of development. They have assumed that changes in physical 
type can occur only through the impact of changes in the environment 
which have affected a great number of generations. It is important to 
keep this viewpoint in mind as the succeeding chapters are read, for they 
contain descriptions of many changes in physical form that have oc￾curred routinely in the various racial groups, even during the first gen￾eration after the parents have adopted the foods of modern civilization. 
Many of our modern writers have recognized and have emphasized the 
seriousness of mental and moral degeneration. Laird has made a splendid 
contribution under the title “The Tail That Wags the Nation,” in which 
he states: 
The country’s average level of general ability sinks lower with each genera￾tion. Should the ballot be restricted to citizens able to take care of themselves? 
One out of four cannot. . . . The tail is now wagging Washington, and Wall 
St. and LaSalle Street. . . . Each generation has seen some lowering of the 
American average level of general ability. 
In Laird’s analysis of our present situation he has stressed a very impor￾tant phase. While emphasizing that the degeneration is not limited to 
restricted areas, he raises the question as to whether local conditions in 
certain areas play important roles in the rate and extent to which degen￾eration has taken place. He says further,’ 
Although we might cite any one of nearly two dozen states, we will first 
mention Vermont by name because that is the place studied by the late Dr. 
Pearce Bailey. “It would be,” he wrote, “safe to assume that there are at least 
30 defectives per 1000 in Vermont of the eight-year-old mentality type, and 
300 per 1000 of backward or retarded persons, persons of distinctly inferior in￾telligence. In other words, nearly one-third of the whole population of that 
state is of a type to require some supervision.” 
The problem of lowered mentality and its place in our modern con￾ception of bodily diseases has not been placed on a physical basis as have 
the better understood degenerative processes, with their direct relation￾ship to a diseased organ, but has generally been assigned to a realm en￾tirely outside the domain of disease or injury of a special organ or tissue. 
Edward Lee Thorndike,* of Columbia University, says that “thinking 
is as biological as digestion.” This implies that a disturbance in the 
capacity to think is directly related to a defect in the brain. 
Another of the distinguished students of mental capacity, J. B. Miner,° 
states: DECLINE OF MODERN CIVILIZATION 15 
If morality and intellect are finally demonstrated to be correlated throughout 
the whole range of individual differences, it is probably the most profoundly sig￾nificant fact with which society has to deal. 
The origin of backwardness in a child seems to have been assigned 
very largely to some experience in that child’s life which becomes a con￾ditioning factor and which thereafter strongly influences his behavior. 
The problem of the relation of physical defects to delinquency in its 
various phases, including major crime, constitutes one of the most 
alarming aspects of our modern problems in social degeneration. Chas￾sell’? has made an exhaustive study of the reports from workers in differ￾ent fields in several countries and summarizes her finding as follows: ‘The 
correlation between delinquency and mental inferiority as found in the 
case of feeble-minded groups is clearly positive, and tends to be marked 
in degree.” 
Burt,*’ who had made an extensive study, over an extended period, of 
the problems of the backward child and the delinquent child in London, 
states in his summary and conclusion with regard to the origin of back￾wardness in the child: 
Both at London and at Birmingham between 60 and 70 per cent belong to the 
(innately) “dull” category. . . . In the majority the outstanding cause is a 
general inferiority of intellectual capacity, presumably inborn and frequently 
hereditary. 
In discussing the relationship between general physical weakness and the 
mentally backward, he writes: 
Old and time-honoured as it must seem to the schoolmaster, the problem of 
the backward child has never been attacked by systematic research until quite 
recently. We know little about causes, and still less about treatment. . 
Thirdly, though the vast majority of backward children—80 per cent in an 
area like London—prove to be suffering from minor bodily ailments or from 
continued ill-health, nevertheless general physical weakness is rarely the main 
factor. 
Among the many surveys made in the study of the forces that are re￾sponsible for producing delinquency and criminality, practically all the 
workers in this field have testified to the obscure nature of those forces. 
Burt! says that, “it is almost as though crime were some contagious 
disease, to which the constitutionally susceptible were suddenly exposed 
at puberty, or to which puberty left them peculiarly prone.” He empha￾sizes a relationship between delinquency and physical deficiency: 
Most repeated offenders are far from robust; they are frail, sickly, and infirm. 
Indeed, so regularly is chronic moral disorder associated with chronic physical 16 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
disorder that many have contended that crime is a disease, or at least a symptom 
of disease, needing the doctor more than the magistrate, physic rather than 
the whip. 
. . . ° ° . . 
The frequency among juvenile delinquents of bodily weakness and ill health 
has been remarked by almost every recent writer. In my own series of cases 
nearly 70 per cent were suffering from such defects; and nearly 50 per cent 
were in urgent need of medical treatment. . . . Of all the psychological causes 
of crime, the commonest and the gravest is usually alleged to be defective 
mind. The most eminent authorities, employing the most elaborate methods of 
scientific analysis, have been led to enunciate some such belief. In England, for 
example, Dr. Goring has affirmed that “the one vital mental constitutional 
factor in the etiology of crime is defective intelligence.”’ In Chicago, Dr. Healy 
has likewise maintained that among the personal characteristics of the offender 
“mental deficiency forms the largest single cause of delinquency.” And most 
American investigators would agree. 
The assertion of the obscurity of the fundamental causative factors of 
delinquency constitutes one of the most striking aspects of the extensive 
literature that has been accumulated through the reporting of intensive 
studies made by workers in many countries. 
Thrasher,*® in discussing the nature and origin of gangs, expresses this 
very clearly: 
Gangs are gangs, wherever they are found. They represent a specific type or 
variety of society, and one thing that is particularly interesting about them is 
the fact that they are, in respect to their organization, so elementary, and in 
respect to their origin, so spontaneous. 
Formal society is always more or less conscious of the end for which it exists, 
and the organization through which this end is achieved is always more or less 
a product of design. But gangs grow like weeds, without consciousness of their 
aims, and without administrative machinery to achieve them. They are, in fact, 
so spontaneous in their origin, and so little conscious of the purposes for which 
they exist, that one is tempted to think of them as predetermined, foreordained, 
and “instinctive,” and so, quite independent of the environment in which they 
ordinarily are found. 
No doubt, many cities have been provided, as has Cleveland, with a 
special school for delinquent boys. The institution there has been given 
the appropriate title, the “Thomas A. Edison School.” It usually has an 
enrollment of 800 to 900 boys. Dr. Watson,!* who has been of outstand- ing service in the organization of this work, makes an important com￾ment on the origin of the student population there: DECLINE OF MODERN CIVILIZATION 7 
The Thomas A. Edison student population consists of a group of truant and 
behavior boys, most of them in those earlier stages of mal-adjustment which we 
have termed predelinquency. . . . In general, they are the products of unhappy 
experiences in school, home and community. They are sensitive recorders of the 
total complex of social forces which operate in and combine to constitute what 
we term their community environment. 
It will be seen from these quotations that great emphasis has been 
placed upon the influence of the environment in determining factors of 
delinquency. 
Hooton, the distinguished physical anthropologist of Harvard, has 
made important observations regarding our modern physical degenera￾tion. As an approach to this larger problem of man’s progressive degen￾eration, he has proposed the organization and establishment of an Insti￾tute of Clinical Anthropology,’ the purpose of which he has indicated: 
. . . for finding out what man is like biologically when he does not need a doc￾tor, in order to further ascertain what he should be like after the doctor has 
finished with him. I am entirely serious when I suggest that it is a very myopic 
medical science which works backward from the morgue rather than forward 
from the cradle. 
Very important contributions have been made to the forces that are 
at work in the development of delinquents through an examination of 
the families in which affected individuals have appeared. Sullenger,’® in 
discussing this phase, states: 
Abbott and Breckinridge found in their Chicago studies that a much higher 
percentage of delinquent boys than girls were from large families. However, 
Healy and Bronner found in their studies in Chicago and Boston that the large 
family is conducive to delinquency among children in that the larger the family 
the greater percentage of cases with more than one delinquent. They were unable 
to detect whether or not this fact was due to parental neglect, poverty, bad 
environmental conditions, or the influence of one child on another. In each of 
the series in both cities the number of delinquents in families of different sizes 
showed general similarity. 
As the investigations outlined in this study are reviewed, many prob￾lems not anticipated by the writer when these investigations were under￾taken will be presented. These new problems were not, at first, generally 
thought of as related directly or indirectly to our modern racial degen￾eration, but have been found recently to be so related. 
Since it will be seen that the size and shape of the head and sinuses, 
including the oral cavity and throat, are directly influenced by forces 
that are at work in our modern civilization, we shall consider the speak- i8 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
ing and singing voice. In traveling among several of the primitive races, 
one is frequently impressed with the range and resonance of many of 
the voices—in fact, by almost every voice. We are quite familiar with 
the high premium that is placed on singing voices of exceptional quality 
in our modern social order. This is illustrated by the following com￾ment:"" 
Tip-top Italian-style tenors have always been a scarce commodity, and for 
the past two decades they have been growing scarcer and scarcer. Opera im￾presarios count on the fingers of one hand the lust-high-voice Latins. . . . Since 
the death of Enrico Caruso (1921) opera houses have shown a steady decline. 
Important light will be thrown on this phase of the problem—the 
cause of fewer good voices in Italy today than of old—as we note the 
narrowing of the face and of the dental arches and as we see the change 
in the form of the palate of the various primitive races. These changes 
occur even in the first generation after the parents have adopted the 
foods of modern white civilizations. 
As we study the primitives we will find that they have had an entirely 
different conception of the nature and origin of the controlling forces 
which have molded individuals and races. 
Buckle,’® in writing his epoch-making “‘History of Civilization” abeut 
the middle of the last century, summed up his years of historical studies 
with some very important conclusions, some of which are as follows: 
2. It is proved by history, and especially by statistics, that human actions are 
governed by laws as fixed and regular as those which rule in the physical world. 
3. Climate, soil, food, and the aspects of Nature are the principal causes of 
intellectual progress. 
6. Religion, literature, and government are, at best, but the products, and 
not the cause of civilization. 
This important view was not orthodox and was met by very severe 
criticism. The newer knowledge strongly corroborates his view. 
My early studies of the relation of nutrition to dental problems were 
related chiefly to growth defects in the teeth produced long before the 
eruption of the permanent teeth, chiefly from one year of age to the time 
of eruption. These often appeared as lines across the teeth. I was able to 
trace these lines directly to the use of a few highly processed baby foods. 
I published an extensive report on this phase of the problem, together 
with illustrations, in 1913.'® These injuries are disclosed with the x-ray 
long before the teeth erupt. These disturbances occur much less fre￾quently in connection with the baby foods used today. 
The problems of modern degeneration can in general be divided into DECLINE OF MODERN CIVILIZATION 19 
two main groups, those which relate to the perfection of the physical 
body and those which relate to its function. The latter include character 
as expressed in behavior of individuals and of groups of individuals which 
thus relate to national character and to an entire culture. 
In an enumeration of the phases in which there is a progressive decline 
of modern civilization, it is essential that we keep in mind that in addi￾tion to an analysis of the forces responsible for individual degenera￾tion, the ethical standards of the whole group cannot be higher than 
those of the individuals that compose it. That recent mass degeneration 
is in progress is attested by daily events throughout the world. The cur￾rent interpretation for individual character degeneration largely places 
the responsibility on a conditioning factor which exerts an influence 
during early childhood and therefore is directly related to the environ￾ment of the child. These, therefore, are postnatal conditioning factors. 
An important contribution to this phase comes directly from the experi￾ence of primitive races and indicates that a more fundamental condi￾tioning factor had developed in the prenatal period. If, therefore, large 
groups of individuals suffer from such a prenatal conditioning influence, 
new light will be thrown upon the larger problems of group deteriora￾tion. History seems to provide records of such mass degeneration as, for 
example, those which culminated in the so-called “dark ages.”’ That some 
such mass degeneration is now in progress is suggested by leading stu￾dents of human welfare. The regius professor of Greek at Oxford in 
his inaugural lecture in 1937 made the following observation:”° 
In the revolution of thought through which we are living, the profoundest 
and most disturbing element is the breakdown of that ethical system which, 
since the days of Constantine, has imposed upon European culture at least the 
semblance of moral unity. 
In commenting on this important statement Sir Alfred Zimmern in his 
address on the decline of international standards said that “Recent events 
should convince the dullest mind of the extent to which international 
standards have deteriorated and the anarchy which threatens the repudia￾tion of law and order in favour of brute force.” 
The problem of progressive decline in individual and group ethical 
standards is commanding the attention of great international organiza￾tions. In discussing this problem before the International Rotary at its 
meeting in San Francisco in June, 1938, one of the leaders in mass reform, 
Mayor Harold Burton of Cleveland, stressed very important phases. He 
stated that the American boys “‘are making irrevocable choices” between 
good and bad citizenship which “may make or wreck the nation. It may 20 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
be on the battlefield of crime prevention that the life of democracy will 
be saved.” He described great industrial cities as battlefields where “the 
tests of democracy are the newest and sharpest.” . . . “For centuries,” 
he said, 
. . . we have fought crime primarily by seeking to catch the criminal after the 
crime has been committed and then through his punishment to lead or drive 
him and others to good citizenship. Today the greater range of operation and 
greater number of criminals argue that we must deal with the flood waters of 
crime. We must prevent the flood by study, control and diversion of the waters 
at their respective sources. To do this we must direct the streams of growing 
boys in each community away from fields of crime to those of good citizenship. 
If the ‘flood waters” that must be controlled lie farther back than the 
cradle, in order to safeguard individual character and individual citizen￾ship from prenatal conditioning factors which have profound influence 
in determining the reaction of the individuals to the environment, it 
is essential that programs that are to be efficient in maintaining national 
character reach back to those forces which are causing the degeneration 
of increasing numbers of the population in succeeding generations of our 
modern cultures. 
That the problem of mass degeneration constitutes one of the most 
alarming problems of our modernized cultures is demonstrated by the 
urgency of appeals that are being made by students in national and inter￾national affairs. The discussion of “An Ethical Declaration for the 
Times,””” a declaration of faith, is accompanied by a pledge. This pledge 
reads: 
I pledge myself to use every opportunity for action to uphold the great tradi￾tion of civilization to protect all those who may suffer for its sake, .and to pass 
it on to the coming generations. I recognized no loyalty greater than that to the 
task of preserving truth, toleration, and justice in the coming world order. 
The author emphasizes the great danger of taking for granted that the 
cultural progress that has been attained will continue. There is prob￾ably no phase of this whole problem of modern degeneration that is so 
brilliantly illuminated by the accumulated wisdom of primitive races as 
group degeneration. They have so organized the life of the family and 
the individual that the nature of the forces which established individual 
behavior and character are controlled. 
Our problem of modern degeneration involves both individual and 
group destiny. Our approach to this study will, accordingly, involve 
first a critical examination of the forces that are responsible for individual degeneration. DECLINE OF MODERN CIVILIZATION © 21 
In my search for the cause of degeneration of the human face and 
the dental organs I have been unable to find an approach to the problem 
through the study of affected individuals and diseased tissues. In my two 
volume work on ‘Dental Infections,” Volume I, entitled ‘Dental Infec￾tions, Oral and Systemic,” and Volume II, entitled ‘Dental Infections 
and the Degenerative Diseases,”** I reviewed at length the researches that 
I had conducted to throw light on this problem. The evidence seemed to 
indicate clearly that the forces that were at work were not to be found 
in the diseased tissues, but that the undesirable conditions were the result 
of the absence of something, rather than of the presence of something. 
This strongly indicated the need for finding groups of individuals so 
physically perfect that they could be used as controls. In order to dis￾cover them, I determined to search out primitive racial stocks that were 
free from the degenerative processes with which we are concerned in 
order to note what they have that we do not have. These field investiga￾tions have taken me to many parts of the world through a series of years. 
The following chapters review the studies made of primitive groups, first, 
when still protected by their isolation, and, second, when in contact with 
modern civilization.

ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS 
N ORDER to study the possibility of greater nutritive value in foods 
produced at a high elevation, as indicated by a lowered incidence of 
morbidity, including tooth decay, I went to Switzerland and made studies 
in two successive years, 1931 and 1932. It was my desire to find, if pos￾sible, groups of Swiss living in a physical environment such that their 
isolation would compel them to live largely on locally produced foods. 
Officials of the Swiss Government were consulted as to the possibility of 
finding people in Switzerland whose physical isolation provided an ade￾quate protection. We were told that the physical conditions that would 
not permit people to obtain modern foods would prevent us from reach￾ing them without hardship. However, owing to the completion of the 
Loetschberg Tunnel, eleven miles long, and the building of a railroad 
that crosses the Loetschental Valley, at a little less than a mile above sea 
level, a group of about 2,000 people had been made easily accessible for 
study, shortly prior to 1931. Practically all the human requirements of 
the people in that valley, except a few items like sea salt, have been pro￾duced in the valley for centuries. 
A bird’s eye view of the Loetschental Valley, looking toward the en￾trance, is shown in Fig. 1. The people of this valley have a history cover￾ing more than a dozen centuries. The architecture of their wooden 
buildings, some of them several centuries old, indicates a love for simple 
stability, adapted to expediency and efficiency. Artistically designed 
mottoes, many of them centuries old, are carved deep in the heavy sup￾porting timbers, both within and without the buildings. They are always 
expressive of devotion to cultural and spiritual values rather than to 
material values. These people have never been conquered, although many 
efforts have been made to invade their valley. Except for the rugged 
cleft through which the river descends to the Rhone Valley, the 
Loetschental Valley is almost completely enclosed by three high moun￾tain ranges which are usually snow-capped. This pass could be guarded 
by a small band against any attacking forces since artificial landslides 
could easily be released. The natural occurrence of these landslides has 
made passage through the gorge hazardous, if not impossible, for months 
23 24 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
of the year. According to early legends of the valley these mountains 
were the parapets of the universe, and the great glacier of the valley, 
the end of the universe. The glacier is a branch of the great ice field that

Swiss live here. In 1932 no deaths had occurred from tuberculosis in the history of the 
valley. 
stretches away to the west and south from the ice-cap of the Jungfrau 
and Monch. The mountains, however, are seldom approached from this 
direction because of the hazardous ice fields. The gateway to them with 
which the traveling world is familiar is from Interlaken by way of the 
Lauterbrunnen or Grindelwald valleys. 
At the altitude of the Loetschental Valley the winters are long, and 
the summers short but beautiful, and accompanied by extraordinarily 
rapid and luxuriant growth. The meadows are fragrant with Alpine 
flowers, with violets like pansies, which bloom all summer in deepest hues. 
The people of the Loetschental Valley make up a community of two 
thousand who have been a world unto themselves. They have neither 
physician nor dentist because they have so little need for them; they 
have neither policeman nor jail, because they have no need for them. The 
clothing has been the substantial homespuns made from the wool of their 
sheep. The valley has produced not only everything that is needed for 
clothing, but practically everything that is needed for food. It has been 
the achievement of the valley to build some of the finest physiques in all 
Europe. This is attested to by the fact that many of the famous Swiss ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS 25 
guards of the Vatican at Rome, who are the admiration of the world 
and are the pride of Switzerland, have been selected from this and other 
Alpine valleys. It is every Loetschental boy’s ambition to be a Vatican 
guard. Notwithstanding the fact that tuberculosis is the most serious 
disease of Switzerland, according to a statement given me by a govern￾ment official, a recent report of inspection of this valley did not reveal 
a single case. I was aided in my studies in Switzerland by the excellent 
cooperation of the Reverend John Siegen, the pastor of the one church 
of this beautiful valley. 
The people live largely in a series of villages dotting the valley floor 
along the river bank. The land that is tilled, chiefly for producing hay 
for feeding the cattle in the winter and rye for feeding the people, ex￾tends from the river and often rises steeply toward the mountains which 
are wooded with timber so precious for protection that little of it has 
been disturbed. Fortunately, there is much more on the vast area of the 
mountain sides than is needed for the relatively small population. The 
forests have been jealously guarded because they are so greatly needed 
to prevent slides of snow and rocks which might engulf and destroy the 
villages. 
The valley has a fine educational system of alternate didactic and 
practical work. All children are required to attend school six months of 
the year and to spend the other six months helping with the farming and 
dairying industry in which young and old of both sexes must work. 
The school system is under the direct supervision of the Catholic Church, 
and the work is well done. The girls are also taught weaving, dyeing and 
garment making. The manufacture of wool and clothing is the chief 
homework for the women in the winter. 
No trucks nor even horses and wagons, let alone tractors, are avail￾able to bear the burdens up and down the mountain sides. This is all 
done on human backs for which the hearts of the people have been made 
especially strong. 
We are primarily concerned here with the quality of the teeth and the 
development of the faces that are associated with such splendid hearts 
and unusual physiques. I made studies of both adults and growing boys 
and girls, during the summer of 1931, and arranged to have samples 
of food, particularly dairy products, sent to me about twice a month, 
summer and winter. These products have been tested for their mineral 
and vitamin contents, particularly the fat-soluble activators. The samples 
were found to be high in vitamins and much higher than the average 
samples of commercial dairy products in America and Europe, and in the 
lower areas of Switzerland. 36 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Hay is cut for winter feeding of the cattle, and this hay grows rapidly. 
The hay proved, on chemical analysis made at my laboratory, to be far 
above the average in quality for pasturage and storage grasses. Almost 
every household has goats or cows or both. In the summer the cattle seek 
the higher pasturage lands and follow the retreating snow which leaves 
the lower valley free for the harvesting of the hay and rye. The turning 
of the soil is done by hand, since there are neither plows nor draft animals 
to drag the plows, in preparation for the next year’s rye crop. A limited 
amount of garden stuff is grown, chiefly green foods for summer use. 
While the cows spend the warm summer on the verdant knolls and 
wooded slopes near the glaciers and fields of perpetual snow, they have a 
period of high and rich productivity of milk. The milk constitutes an 
important part of the summer’s harvesting. While the men and boys 
gather in the hay and rye, the women and children go in large numbers 
with the cattle to collect the milk and make and store cheese for the fol￾lowing winter’s use. This cheese contains the natural butter fat and 
minerals of the splendid milk and is a virtual storehouse of life for the 
coming winter. 
From Dr. Siegen, I learned much about the life and customs of these 
people. He told me that they recognize the presence of Divinity in the life￾giving qualities of the butter made in June when the cows have arrived 
for pasturage near the glaciers. He gathers the people together to thank 
the kind Father for the evidence of his Being in the life-giving qualities 
of butter and cheese made when the cows eat the grass near the snow line. 
This worshipful program includes the lighting of a wick in a bow] of the 
first butter made after the cows have reached the luscious summer 
pasturage. This wick is permitted to burn in a special sanctuary built for 
the purpose. The natives of the valley are able to recognize the superior 
quality of their June butter, and, without knowing exactly why, pay it 
due homage. 
The nutrition of the people of the Loetschental Valley, particularly 
that of the growing boys and girls, consists largely of a slice of whole rye 
bread and a piece of the summer-made cheese (about as large as the slice 
of bread), which are eaten with fresh milk of goats or cows. Meat is 
eaten about once a week. In the light of our newer knowledge of activat￾ing substances, including vitamins, and the relative values of food for supplying minerals for body building, it is clear why they have healthy bodies and sound teeth. The average total fat-soluble activator and mineral intake of calcium and phosphorus of these children would far exceed that of the daily intake of the average American child. The sturdiness of the child life permits children to play and frolic bareheaded ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS 27 
and barefooted even in water running down from the glacier in the late 
evening’s chilly breezes, in weather that made us wear our overcoats and 
gloves and button our collars. Of all the children in the valley still using 
the primitive diet of whole rye bread and dairy products the average 
number of cavities per person was 0.3. On an average it was necessary 
to examine three persons to find one defective deciduous or permanent 
tooth. The children examined were between seven and sixteen years 
of age. 
If one is fortunate enough to be in the valley in early August and 
witness the earnestness with which the people celebrate their national 
holiday, he will be privileged to see a sight long to be remembered. These 
celebrations close with the gathering together of the mountaineers on 
various crags and prominences where great bonfires are lighted from fuel 
that has been accumulated and built into an enormous mound to make a 
huge torchlight. These bonfires are lighted at a given hour from end to 
end of the valley throughout its expanse. Every mountaineer on a dis￾tant crag seeing the lights knows that the others are signalling to him 
that they, too, are making their sacred consecration in song which says 
“one for all and all for one.” This motive has been crystallized into action 
and has become a part of the very souls of the people. One understands 
why doors do not need to be bolted in the Loetschental Valley. 
How different the level of life and horizon of such souls from those 
in many places in the so-called civilized world in which people have de￾graded themselves until life has no interest in values that cannot be ex￾pressed in gold or pelf, which they would obtain even though the life 
of the person being cheated or robbed would thereby be crippled or 
blotted out. 
One immediately wonders if there is not something in the life-giving 
vitamins and minerals of the food that builds not only great physical 
structures within which their souls reside, but builds minds and hearts 
capable of a higher type of manhood in which the material values of life 
are made secondary to individual character. In succeeding chapters we 
will see evidence that this is the case. 
Our quest has been for information relative to the health of the body, 
the perfection of the teeth, and the normality of development of faces 
and dental arches, in order that we might through an analysis of the 
foods learn the secret of such splendid body building and learn from the 
people of the valley how the nutrition of all groups of people may be 
reinforced, so that they, too, may be free from mankind’s most universal 
disease, tooth decay and its sequelae. These studies included not only the 
making of a physical examination of the teeth, the photographing of 28 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
subjects, the recording of voluminous data, the obtaining of samples of 
food for chemical analysis, the collecting of detailed information regard￾ing daily menus; but also the collecting of samples of saliva for chemical 
analysis. The chemical analysis of saliva was used to test out my newly 
developed procedure for estimating the level of immunity to dental 
caries for a given person at a given time. This procedure is outlined in 
following chapters. The samples of saliva were preserved by an addition 
of formalin equivalent in amount to one per cent of the sample of saliva. 
These children will, it is hoped, be reexamined in succeeding years in 
order to make comparative studies of the effect of the changes in the 
local nutritional programs. Some of these changes are already in progress. 
There is now a modern bakery dispensing white bread and many white￾flour products which was in full operation in 1932. 
I inquired of many persons regarding the most favorable districts in 
which to make further studies of groups of people living in protected 
isolation because of their physical environment, and decided to study 
some special high Alpine valleys between the Rhone Valley and Italy, 
which I included in 1932. The Canton of Wallis is bordered by French￾speaking people on the west, by Italian-speaking people on the south, and 
by German-speaking people on the east and north. I had as guides and 
interpreters in Wallis, Dr. Alfred Gysi and also Dr. Adolf Roos through 
part of the territory. 
Our first expedition was into the valley of the Visp which is a great 
gorge extending southward from the Rhone River, dividing into two 
gorges, one going to the Saas Fee country, and the other to the vicinity 
of the Matterhorn with its almost spirelike pinnacle lifting itself above 
the surrounding snow-capped mountains and visible from eminences in 
all directions as one of the mightiest and most sublime spectacles in the 
world. It was one of the last mountains of Europe to be scaled by man. 
One has not seen the full majesty of the Alps if he has not seen the 
Matterhorn, 
We left the mountain railroad, which makes many of the grades with 
the cog system, at the town of St. Nicholas, and climbed the mountain 
trail to an isolated settlement on the east bank of the Mattervisp River, 
called Grachen, a five-hour journey. The settlement is on a shelf high 
above the east side of the river where it is exposed to southern sunshine and enjoys a unique isolation because of its physical inaccessibility. An examination made of the children in this community showed that only 2.3 teeth out of every hundred had been attacked by tooth decay. 
The hardihood of the people was splendidly illustrated by a woman ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS 29 
of 62 years who carried an enormous load of rye on her back at an alti￾tude of about 5,000 feet. We met her later and talked to her, and found 
that she was extraordinarily well developed and well preserved. She

showed us her grandchildren who had fine physiques and facial de￾velopments. 
The rye is so precious that while being carried the heads are protected 
by wrapping them in canvas so that not a kernel will be lost. The rye 
is thrashed by hand and ground in stone mills which were formerly 
hand-turned like the one shown in Fig. 2. Recently water turbines have 
been installed. Water power is abundant and the grinding is done for 
the people of the mountain side in these water-driven mills. Only whole￾rye flour is available. Each household takes turns in using the community 
bake-oven, which is shown in Fig. 2. A month’s supply of whole-rye 
bread is baked at one time for a given family. 
Here again the cows were away in the midsummer, pasturing up near 
the glaciers. Grachen has an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The church 
at Grachen was built several hundred years ago. We were shown an em￾bossed certificate of honor and privilege extended to a group of about 
120 people who had originally built the edifice. We were given valued 
assistance by the local priest, and were provided with facilities in his 
spacious and well-kept rooms for making our studies of the children. 
From-Grachen we returned to St. Nicholas and proceeded from there 30 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
by train down the valley and up another steep ascent, requiring several 
hours, to the hamlet of Visperterminen, on the east side of the mountain 
above the Visp River, and below the junction of the Mattervisp and 
Saaservisp. This community is made up of about 1,600 people living 
on a sheltered shelf high above the river valley. The view from this 
position is indescribably beautiful. It is a little below the timber line of 
this and the surrounding mountains. Majestic snow-clad peaks and pre￾cipitous mountains dot the horizon and shade off into winding gorges 
which mark the course of wandering streams several thousand feet below 
our vantage point. It is a place to stop and ponder. 
The gradations in climate range in the summer from a tropical tem￾perature in protected nooks during the daytime to sub-zero weather with 
raging blizzards at night on the high mountains. It is a place where 
human stamina can be tempered to meet all the vicissitudes of life. 
The village consists of a group of characteristically designed Swiss 
chalets clustered on the mountain side. The church stands out as a beacon 
visible from mountains in all directions. Visperterminen is unique in 
many respects. Notwithstanding its relative proximity to civilization— 
it is only a few hours’ journey to the thoroughfare of the Rhone Valley— 
it has enjoyed isolation and opportunity for maintaining its characteristic 
primitive social and civil life. We were greeted here by the president 
of the village who graciously opened the school house and sent messengers 
to have the children of the community promptly come to the school 
building in order that we might make such studies as we desired. This 
study included a physical examination of the teeth and of the general 
development of the children, particularly of the faces and dental arches, 
the making of photographic records, the obtaining of samples of saliva, 
as in other places, and also the making of a detailed study of the nutri￾tion. In addition, we obtained samples of foods for chemical analysis. 
The people of Visperterminen have the unique distinction of owning 
land in the lower part of the mountain on which they maintain vine￾yards to supply wine for this country. They have the highest vineyards 
of Europe. They are grown on banks that are often so steep that one 
wonders how the tillers of the soil or the gatherers of the fruit can main￾tain their hold on the precarious and shifting footing. Each terrace has a 
trench near its lower retaining wall to catch the soil that is washed down, 
and this soil must be carried back in baskets to the upper boundary of 
the plot. This is all done by human labor. The vineyards afforded them 
the additional nutrition of wine and of fruit minerals and vitamins which 
the two groups we studied at Loetschental and Grachen did not have. 
This additional nutrition was of importance because of the opportu- ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS a1 
nity for obtaining through it vitamin C. It is of particular interest in the 
study of the incidence of tooth decay in Visperterminen that these addi￾tional factors had not created a higher immunity to tooth decay, nor a 
better condition of health in gingival tissues than previously found. In 
each one hundred teeth examined 5.2 were found to have been attacked at 
some time by tooth decay. Here again the nutrition consisted of rye, 
used almost exclusively as the cereal; of dairy products; of meat about 
once a week; and also some potatoes. Limited green foods were eaten 
during the summer. The general custom is to have a sheep dressed and 
distributed to a group of families, thus providing each family with a 
ration of meat for one day a week, usually Sunday. The bones and scraps 
are utilized for making soups to be served during the week. The children 
have goat’s milk in the summer when the cows are away in the higher 
pastures near the snow line. Certain members of the families go to the 
higher pastures with the cows to make cheese for the coming winter’s use. 
The problem of identifying goats or cattle for establishing individual 
ownership is a considerable one where the stock of all are pastured in 
common herds. It was interesting to us to observe how this problem was 
met. The president of the village has what is called a “tessel’? which is a 
string of manikins in imitation of goats or cattle made of wood and 
leather. Every stock owner must provide a manikin to be left in the safe￾keeping of the president of the village with whom it is registered. It 
carries on it the individual markings that this member of the colony 
agrees to put on every member of his animal stock. The marking may 
be a hole punched in the left ear or a slit in the right ear, or any com￾bination of such markings as is desired. Thereafter all animals carrying 
that mark are the property of the person who registered it; similarly, any 
animals that have not this individual symbol of identification cannot be 
claimed by him. 
As one stands in profound admiration before the stalwart physical 
development and high moral character of these sturdy mountaineers, he 
is impressed by the superior types of manhood, womanhood, and child￾hood that Nature has been able to produce from a suitable diet and a 
suitable environment. Surely, here is evidence enough to answer the 
question whether cereals should be avoided because they produce acids 
in the system which if formed will be the cause of tooth decay and many 
other ills including the acidity of the blood or saliva. Surely, the ultimate 
control will be found in Nature’s laboratory where man has not yet been 
able to meddle sufficiently with Nature’s nutritional program to blight 
humanity with abnormal and synthetic nutrition. When one has watched 
for days the childlife in those high Alpine preserves of superior manhood; 32 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
when one has contrasted these people with the pinched and sallow, and 
even deformed, faces and distorted bodies that are produced by our 
modern civilization and its diets; and when one has contrasted the un￾surpassed beauty of the faces of these children developed on Nature’s 
primitive foods with the varied assortment of modern civilization’s 
children with their defective facial development, he finds himself filled 
with an earnest desire to see that this betterment is made available for 
modern civilization. 
Again and again we had the experience of examining a young man or 
young woman and finding that at some period of his life tooth decay had 
been rampant and had suddenly ceased; but, during the stress, some teeth 
had been lost. When we asked such people whether they had gone out of 
the mountain and at what age, they generally replied that at eighteen or 
twenty years of age they had gone to this or that city and had stayed 
a year or two. They stated that they had never had a decayed tooth 
before they went or after they returned, but that they had lost some 
teeth in the short period away from home. 
At this point of our studies Dr. Roos found it necessary to leave, but 
Dr. Gysi accompanied us to the Anniviers Valley, which is also on the 
south side of the Rhone. The river of the valley, the Navizenze, drains 
from the high Swiss and Italian boundary north to the Rhone River. 
Here again we had the remarkable experience of finding communities 
near to each other, one blessed with high immunity to tooth decay, and 
the other afflicted with rampant tooth decay. 
The village of Ayer lies in a beautiful valley well up toward the 
glaciers. It is still largely primitive, although a government road has re￾cently been developed, which, like many of the new arteries, has made it 
possible to dispatch military protection when and if necessary to any 
community. In this beautiful hamlet, until recently isolated, we found 
a high immunity to dental caries. Only 2.3 teeth out of each hundred 
examined were found to have been attacked by tooth decay. Here again 
the people were living on rye and dairy products. We wonder if history 
will repeat itself in the next few years and if there, too, this enviable im￾munity will be lost with the advent of the highway. Usually it is not 
long after tunnels and roads are built that automobiles and wagons enter 
with modern foods, which begin their destructive work. This fact has 
been tragically demonstrated in this valley since a roadway was extended 
as far as Vissoie several years ago. In this village modern foods have been 
available for some time. One could probably walk the distance from 
Ayer to Vissoie in an hour. The number of teeth found to be attacked ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS 33 
with caries for each one hundred children’s teeth examined at Vissoie was 
20.2 as compared with 2.3 at Ayer. We had here a splendid opportunity 
to study the changes that had occurred in the nutritional programs. With 
the coming of transportation and new markets there had been shipped in 
modern white flour; equipment for a bakery to make white-flour goods; 
highly sweetened fruit, such as jams, marmalades, jellies, sugar and 
syrups—all to be traded for the locally produced high-vitamin dairy 
products and high-mineral cheese and rye; and with the exchange there 
was enough money as premium to permit buying machine-made cloth￾ing and various novelties that would soon be translated into necessities. 
Each valley or village has its own special feast days of which athletic 
contests are the principal events. The feasting in the past has been largely 
on dairy products. The athletes were provided with large bowls of cream 
as constituting one of the most popular and healthful beverages, and 
special cheese was always available. Practically no wine was used because 
no grapes grew in that valley, and for centuries the isolation of the people 
prevented access to much material that would provide wine. In the Vis￾perterminen community, however, the special vineyards owned by these 
people on the lower level of the mountain side provided grape juice in 
various stages of fermentation, and their feasts in the past have been 
celebrated by the use of wines of rare vintage as well as by the use of 
cream and other dairy products. Their cream products took the place 
of our modern ice cream. It was a matter of deep interest to have the 
President of Visperterminen show us the tankards that had been in use in 
that community for nine or ten centuries. The care of these was one of 
the many responsibilities of the chief executive of the hamlet. 
It is reported that practically all skulls that are exhumed in the Rhone 
valley, and, indeed, practically throughout all of Switzerland where 
graves have existed for more than a hundred years, show relatively per￾fect teeth; whereas the teeth of people recently buried have been riddled 
with caries or lost through this disease. It is of interest that each church 
usually has associated with it a cemetery in which the graves are kept 
decorated, often with beautiful designs of fresh or artificial flowers. 
Members of succeeding generations of families are said to be buried one 
above the other to a depth of many feet. Then, after a sufficient number 
of generations have been so honored, their bodies are exhumed to make a 
place for present and coming generations. These skeletons are usually 
preserved with honor and deference. The bones are stacked in basements 
of certain buildings of the church edifice with the skulls facing outward. 
These often constitute a solid wall of considerable extent. In Naters there 34 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
is such a group said to contain 20,000 skeletons and skulls. These were 
studied with great interest as was also a smaller collection in connection 
with the cathedral at Visp. While many of the single straight-rooted 
teeth had been lost in the handling, many were present. It was a matter 
of importance to find that only a small percentage of teeth had had 
caries. Teeth that had been attacked with deep caries had developed apical 
abscesses with consequent destruction of the alveolar processes. Evidence 
of this bone change was readily visible. Sockets of missing teeth still had 
continuous walls, indicating that the teeth had been vital at death. 
The reader will scarcely believe it possible that such marked differences 
in facial form, in the shape of the dental arches, and in the health condi￾tion of the teeth as are to be noted when passing from the highly mod￾ernized lower valleys and plains country in Switzerland to the isolated 
high valleys can exist. Fig. 3 shows four girls with typically broad dental 
arches and regular arrangement of the teeth. They have been born and 
raised in the Loetschental Valley or other isolated valleys of Switzerland 
which provide the excellent nutrition that we have been reviewing. They 
have been taught little regarding the use of tooth brushes. Their teeth 
have typical deposits of unscrubbed mouths; yet they are almost com￾pletely free from dental caries, as are the other individuals of the group 
they represent. In a study of 4,280 teeth of the children of these high 
valleys, only 3.4 per cent were found to have been attacked by tooth 
decay. This is in striking contrast to conditions found in the modernized 
sections using the modern foods. 
In Loetschental, Grachen, Visperterminen and Ayer, we have found 
communities of native Swiss living almost exclusively on locally pro￾duced foods consisting of the cereal, rye, and the animal product, milk, 
in its various forms. At Vissoie, with its available modern nutrition, there 
has been a complete change in the level of immunity to dental caries. It is 
important that studies be made in other communities which correspond 
in altitude with the first four places studied in which there was a high 
immunity to dental caries. Modern foods should be available in the new 
communities selected for comparative study. To find such places one 
would naturally think of those that are world-famed as health resorts 
providing the best things that modern science and industry can assemble. 
Surely St. Moritz would be such a place. It is situated in the south￾eastern part of the Republic of Switzerland near the headwaters of the Danube in the upper Engadin. This world-famous watering place at￾tracts people of all continents for both summer and winter health 
building and for the enjoyment of the mountain lakes, snow-capped ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS 35

peaks, forested mountain sides, and crystal clear atmosphere with abun￾dance of sunshine. 
The journey from the Canton of Wallis (Valais) to the upper Engadin 
takes one up the Rhone valley, climbing continually to get above cascades 
and beautiful waterfalls until one comes to the great Rhone glacier 
which blocks the end of the valley. The water gushes from beneath 
the mountain of ice to become the parent stream of the Rhone river 
which passes westward through the Rhone valley receiving tributaries 
from snow-fed streams from both north and south watersheds, as it 
rolls westward to the beautiful Lake Geneva and then onward west and 
south to the Mediterranean. 
It is of significance that a study of the child life in the Rhone valley, 
as made by Swiss officials and reported by Dr. Adolf Roos and his asso￾ciates, shows that practically every child had tooth decay and the ma￾jority of the children had decay in an aggravated form. People of this 
valley are provided with adequate railroad transportation for bringing 
them the luxuries of the world. As we pass eastward over the pass 
through Andermatt, we are reminded that the trains of the St. Gotthard 
tunnel go thundering through the mountain a mile below our feet en 
route to Italy. To reach our goal, the beautiful modern city and summer 
resort of St. Moritz, we enter the Engadin country famed for its beauty 
and crystal-clear atmosphere. We already know something of the beauty 
that awaits us which has attracted pleasure seekers and beauty lovers of 
the world to St. Moritz. One would scarcely expect to see so modern 
a city as St. Mortiz at an altitude of a little over a mile, with little 
else to attract people than its climate in winter and summer, the mag￾nificent scenery, and the clear atmosphere. We have passed from the com￾munities where almost everyone wears homespuns to one of English 
walking coats and the most elegant of feminine attire. Everyone shows 
the effect of contact with culture. The hotels in their appointments and 
design are reminiscent of Atlantic City. Immediately one sees something 
is different here than in the primitive localities: the children have not 
the splendidly developed features, and the people give no evidence of the 
great physical reserve that is present in the smaller communities. 
Through the kindness of Dr. William Barry, a local dentist, and 
through that of the superintendent of the public schools, we were invited 
to use one of the school buildings for our studies of the children. The 
summer classes were dismissed with instructions that the children be re￾tained so that we could have them for study. Several factors were imme￾diately apparent. The teeth were shining and clean, giving eloquent ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS 37. 
testimony of the thoroughness of the instructions in the use of the 
modern dentifrices for efficient oral prophylaxis. The gums looked better 
and the teeth more beautiful for having the debris and deposits removed. 
Surely this superb climate, this magnificent setting, combined with the 
best of the findings of modern prophylactic science, should provide a 
100-per-cent immunity to tooth decay. But in a study of the children 
from eight to fifteen years of age, 29.8 per cent of the teeth had already 
been attacked by dental caries. Our study of each case included careful 
examining of the mouth; photographing of the face and teeth; obtaining 
of samples of saliva for chemical analysis; and a study of the program 
of nutrition followed by the given case. In most cases, the diet was 
strikingly modern, and the only children found who did not have tooth 
decay proved to be children who were eating the natural foods, whole rye 
bread and plenty of milk. 
In Chapter 15, a detailed discussion of the chemical differences in the 
tood constituents is presented for both the districts subject to immunity, 
and for those subject to susceptibility. 
I was told by a former resident of this upper Engadin country that 
in one of the isolated valleys only a few decades ago the children were 
still carrying their luncheons to school in the form of roasted rye carried 
dry in their pockets. Their ancestors had eaten cereal in this dry form 
for centuries. 
St. Moritz is a typical Alpine community with a physical setting simi￾lar to that in the Cantons of Bern and Wallis (Valais). It is, however, 
provided with modern nutrition consisting of an abundance of white￾flour products, marmalades, jams, canned vegetables, confections, and 
fruits—all of which are transported to the district. Only a limited supply 
of vegetables is grown locally. We studied some children here whose par￾ents retained their primitive methods of food selection, and without 
exception those who were immune to dental caries were eating a dis￾tinctly different food from those with high susceptibility to dental caries. 
Few countries of the world have had officials so untiring in their efforts 
to study and tabulate the incidence of dental caries in various geographic 
localities as has Switzerland. In the section lying to the north and east, 
and near Lake Constance, there is a considerable district where it is re￾ported that 100 per cent of the people are suffering from dental caries. 
In almost all the other parts of Switzerland in which the population is 
large 95 to 98 per cent of the people suffer from dental caries. Of the 
two remaining districts, in one there is from 90 to 95 per cent and in 
the other from 85 to 90 per cent individual susceptibility to dental caries. 38 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Since in the district in the vicinity of Lake Constance the incidence of 
dental caries is so high that it is recorded as 100 per cent, it seemed 
especially desirable to make a similar critical study there and to obtain 
samples of saliva and detailed information regarding the food, and to 
make detailed physical examinations of growing children in this com￾munity, and through the great kindness of Dr. Hans Eggenberger, 
Director of Public Health for this general district, we were given an op￾portunity to do so. 
Arrangements were made by Dr. Eggenberger so that typical groups 
of children, some in institutions, could be studied. He is located at 
Herisau in the Canton of St. Gall. We found work well organized for 
building up the health of these children in so far as outdoor treatment, 
fresh air, and sunshine were concerned. As dental caries is a major prob￾lem, and probably nutritional, it is treated by sunshine. The boys’ group 
and girls’ group are both given suitable athletic sports under skillfully 
trained directors. These groups are located in different parts of the city. 
Their recreation grounds are open lawns adjoining wooded knolls which 
give the children protection and isolation in which to play in their 
sunsuits and build vigorous appetites, and thus to prepare for their in￾stitutional foods which were largely from a modern menu. Critical dental 
examinations were made and an analysis of the data obtained revealed 
that one-fourth of all teeth of these growing boys and girls had already 
been attacked by dental caries, and that only 4 per cent of the children 
had escaped from the ravages of tooth decay, which disease many of 
them had in an aggravated form. 
In the Herisau group 25.5 per cent of the 2,065 teeth examined had 
been attacked by dental caries and many teeth were abscessed. The upper 
photographs in Fig. 4 are of two girls with typically rampant tooth 
decay. The one to the left is sixteen years of age and several of her perma￾nent teeth are decayed to the gum line. Her appearance is seriously 
marred, as is also that of the girl to the right. 
Another change that is seen in passing from the isolated groups with 
their more nearly normal facial developments, to the groups of the lower 
valleys, is the marked irregularity of the teeth with narrowing of the 
arches and other facial features. In the lower half of Fig. 4 may be seen 
two such cases. While in the isolated groups not a single case of a typical 
mouth breather was found, many were seen among the children of the 
lower-plains group. The children studied were from ten to sixteen years 
of age. 
Many individuals in the modernized districts bore on their faces scars ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS 39 
Fic. 4. In the modernized districts of Switzerland tooth decay is rampant. The gurl, 
upper left, is sixteen and the one to the right is younger. They use white bread and sweets 
liberally. The two children below have very badly formed dental arches with crowding 
of the teeth. This deformity is not due to heredity. 40 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
which indicated that the abscess of an infected tooth had broken through 
to the external surface where it had developed a fistula with resultant 
scar tissue, thus producing permanent deformity. 
Bad as these conditions were, we were told that they were better than 
the average for the community. The ravages of dental caries had been 
strikingly evident as we came in contact with the local and traveling 
public. As we had at St. Moritz, we found an occasional child with much 
better teeth than the average. Usually the answer was not far to seek. 
For example, in one of the St. Moritz groups, in a class of sixteen boys, 
there were 158 cavities, or an average of 9.8 cavities per person (fillings 
are counted as cavities). In the cases of three other children in the same 
group, there were only three cavities, and one case was without dental 
caries. Two of these three had been eating dark bread or entire-grain 
bread, and one was eating dark bread and oatmeal porridge. All three 
drank milk liberally. 
When looking here for the source of dairy products one is impressed 
by the absence of cows at pasture in the plains of Switzerland, areas in 
which a large percentage of the entire population resides. True, one 
frequently sees large laiteries or creameries, but the cows are not in sight. 
On asking the explanation for this, I found that a larger quantity of milk 
could be obtained from the cows if they were kept in the stables during 
the period of high production. Indeed, this was a necessity in most of 
these communities since there were so few fences, and during the time 
of the growth of the crops, including the stock feed for the winter’s use, 
it was necessary that the cows be kept enclosed. About the only time 
that cows were allowed out on pasture was in the fall after the crops 
had been harvested and while the stubble was being plowed. 
Among the children in St. Moritz and Herisau, those groups with the 
lower number of cavities per person were using milk more or less liber￾ally. Of the total number of children examined in both places only 11 
per cent were using milk in their diets, whereas 100 per cent of the chil￾dren in the other districts that provided immunity were using milk. 
Nearly every child in St. Moritz was eating white bread. In Herisau, all 
but one of the children examined were eating white bread in whole or in 
principal part. 
Since so many cattle were stall-fed in the thickly populated part of 
Switzerland, and since so low a proportion of the children used milk even 
sparingly, I was concerned to know what use was made of the milk. 
Numerous road signs announcing the brand of sweetened milk chocolate 
made in the several districts suggested one use. This chocolate is one of ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS 4) 
the important products for export and as a beverage constitutes a con￾siderable item in the nutrition of large numbers living in this and in 
other countries. It is recognized as a high source of energy, primarily 
because of the sugar and chocolate which when combined with the milk 
greatly reduces the ratio of the minerals to the energy factors as ex￾pressed in calories. 
It was formerly thought that dental caries which was so rampant 
in the greater portion of Switzerland was due in part to low iodine con￾tent in the cattle feed and in other food because of iodine deficiency in 
the soil. Large numbers of former generations suffered from clinical 
goiter and various forms of thyroid disturbances. That this is not the 
cause seems clearly demonstrated by the fact that dental caries is ap￾parently as extensive today as ever before, if not more so, while the iodine 
problem has been met through a reintorcement of the diet of growing 
children and others in stress periods with iodine in suitable form. Indeed 
the early work done in Cleveland by Crile, Marine, and Kimball was 
referred to by the medical authorities there as being the forerunner of 
the control of the thyroid disorder in these communities. 
The officials of the Herisau community were so deeply concerned re￾garding the prevalence of dental caries that they were carrying forward 
institutional and community programs with the hope of checking this 
affliction. If dental caries were primarily the result of an inadequate 
amount of vitamin D, then sunning the patients should provide an ade￾quate reinforcement. This is one of the principal purposes for getting the 
growing boys and girls of the community into sunsuits for tanning their 
bodies. 
Another procedure to which my attention was called consisted of 
adding to the bread a product high in lime, which was being obtained 
in the foothills of the district. This and other types of bread were studieu 
by chemical analyses. Clinically, tooth decay was not reduced. 
I made an effort to establish a clinic in a neighboring town for the 
purpose of demonstrating with a group of children that dental caries can 
be controlled by a simple nutritional program. An interesting incident 
developed in connection with the selection of the children for this experi￾mental group. When parents were asked to permit their children to have 
one meal a day reinforced, according to a program that has proved ade￾quate with my clinical groups in Cleveland, the objection was made that 
there was no use trying to save the teeth of the girls. The girls should 
have all their teeth extracted and artificial teeth provided before they 
were married, because if they did not they would lose them then. 42 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
It is of interest that the southern part of Switzerland including the 
high Alpine country is largely granite. The hills in the northern part of 
Switzerland are largely limestone in origin. A great number of people 
live in the plain between these two geologic formations, a plain which is 
largely made of alluvial deposits which have been washed down from the 
upper formations. The soil is extraordinarily fertile soil and has sup￾ported a thrifty and healthy population in the past. 
When I asked a government official what the principal diseases of 
the community were, he said that the most serious and most universal 
was dental caries, and the next most important, tuberculosis; and that 
both were largely modern diseases in that country. 
When I visited the famous advocate of heliotherapy, Dr. Rollier, in 
his clinic in Leysin, Switzerland, I wondered at the remarkable results 
he was obtaining with heliotherapy in nonpulmonary tuberculosis. | 
asked him how many patients he had under his general supervision and 
he said about thirty-five hundred. I then asked him how many of them 
come from the isolated Alpine valleys and he said that there was not one; 
but that they were practically all from the Swiss plains, with some from 
other countries. 
I inquired of several clinicians in Switzerland what their observations 
were with regard to the association of dental caries and tuberculosis 
among the people of Switzerland. I noted that the reports indicated that 
the two diseases were generally associated. We will find a corollary to this 
in many studies in other parts of the world. 
These studies in Switzerland, as briefly presented here, seem to demon￾strate that the isolated groups dependent on locally produced natural 
foods have nearly complete natural immunity to dental caries, and that 
the substitution of modern dietaries for these primitive natural foods de￾stroys this immunity whether in ideally located elevated districts like 
St. Moritz or in the beautiful and fertile plains of lower Switzerland. 
The question seems to answer itself in a general way, without much 
laboratory data, from the results of a critical examination of the foods. 
The laboratory analyses, however, identify the particular factors in the 
foods which are primarily responsible by their presence for establishing 
immunity, and by their absence in inducing susceptibility to dental 
caries. These chemical data are discussed in Chapter 15. 
High immunity to dental caries, freedom from deformity of the den￾tal arches and face, and sturdy physiques with high immunity to disease 
were all found associated with physical isolation, and with forced limita￾tion in selection of foods. This resulted in a very liberal use of dairy ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED SWISS 43 
products and whole-rye bread, in connection with plant foods, and with 
meat served about once a week. 
The individuals in the modernized districts were found to have wide￾spread tooth decay. Many had facial and dental arch deformities and 
much susceptibility to diseases. These conditions were associated with 
the use of refined cereal flours, a high intake of sweets, canned goods, 
sweetened fruits, chocolate; and a greatly reduced use of dairy products. Chapter 4 
ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED GAELICS 
tories have long been told of the superb health of the people living 
S in the Islands of the Outer Hebrides. The smoke oozing through the 
thatched roofs of their “black houses” has added weirdness to the de￾scription of their home life and strange environment. These stories have 
included a description of their wonderfully fine teeth and their stalwart 
physiques and strong characters. They, accordingly, provide an excellent 
setting for a study to throw light on the problem of the cause of dental 
caries and modern physical degeneration. These Islands lie off the north￾west coast of Scotland, extending to a latitude nearly as far north as the 
southern part of Greenland. A typical view of their thatched-roof cot￾tages may be seen in Fig. 5. 
The Isle of Lewis has a population of about twenty thousand, made up 
almost entirely of fisher folk and crofters or sheep raisers. This island has 
so little lime in its soil that it is said that there are no trees in the entire 
island except a few which have been planted. The surface of the island 
is largely covered with peat, varying in thickness from a few inches to 
twenty feet. This is the fuel. Peat contains the rootlets of the plant life 
which grew many centuries ago. There is so little bacterial growth that 
vegetable products undergo very slow decay. The pasturage of the island 
is so poor that exceedingly few cattle are to be found, largely because 
they do not properly mature and reproduce. In a few districts some high￾land cattle with long shaggy hair and wide spread horns are found. Al￾most all of these are imported. The principal herd of cattle on the island 
consists of a few dozen head on the government experimental farm. 
The basic foods of these islanders are fish and oat products with a little 
barley. Oat grain is the one cereal which develops fairly readily, and it 
provides the porridge and oat cakes which in many homes are eaten in 
some form regularly with each meal. The fishing about the Outer 
Hebrides is specially favorable, and small sea foods, including lobsters, 
crabs, oysters and clams, are abundant. An important and highly rel￾ished article of diet has been baked cod’s head stuffed with chopped 
cod’s liver and oatmeal. 
The principal port of the Isle of Lewis is Stornoway with a fixed popu￾44 ¢ ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED GAELICS 45 
Fic. 5. A typical “black house’’ of the Isle of Lewis derives its name from the smoke of 
the peat burned for heat. The splendid physical development of the native Gaelic fisherfolk 
is characterized by excellent teeth and well formed faces and dental arches. 46 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
lation of about four thousand and a floating population of seamen over 
week-ends, of an equal or greater number. The Sunday we spent there, 
450 large fishing boats were said to be in the port for the week-end. Large 
quantities of fish are packed here for foreign markets. These hardy 
fisherwomen often toil from six in the morning to ten at night. The 
abundance of fish makes the cost of living very low. 
In Fig. § may be seen three of these fisher-people with teeth of unusual 
perfection. We saw them at the fish-cleaning benches from early morning 
till late at night dressed, as you see them pictured, in their oilskin suits 
and rubber boots. We met them again in their Sunday attire taking im￾portant parts in the leading church. It would be difficult to find examples 
of womanhood combining a higher degree of physical perfection and 
more exalted ideals than these weather-hardened toilers. Theirs is a land 
of frequent gales, often sleet-ridden or enshrouded in penetrating cold 
fogs. Life is full of meaning for characters that are developed to accept 
as everyday routine raging seas and piercing blizzards representing the 
accumulated fury of the treacherous north Atlantic. One marvels at their 
gentleness, refinement and sweetness of character. 
The people live in these so-called black houses. These are thatched-roof 
dwellings containing usually two or three rooms. The walls are built of 
stone and dirt, ordinarily about five feet in thickness. There is usually 
a fireplace and chimney, one or two outside doors, and very few windows 
in the house. The thatch of the roofs plays a very important réle. It is 
replaced each October and the old thatch is believed by the natives to 
have great value as a special fertilizer for their soil because of its im￾pregnation with chemicals that have been obtained from the peat smoke 
which may be seen seeping through all parts of the roof at all seasons of 
the year. Peat fires are kept burning for this explicit purpose even when 
the heat is not needed. This means that enormous quantities of peat are 
required to maintain a continuous smudge. Some of the houses have no 
chimney because it is desirable that the smoke leave the building through 
the thatched roof. Not infrequently smoke is seen rolling out of an open 
door or open window. Fortunately the peat is so abundant that it can 
be obtained easily from the almost limitless quantities nearby. The sheep 
that roam the heather-covered plains are of a small black-faced breed, 
exhibiting great hardihood. They provide wool of specially high quality, 
which, incidentally, is the source of the famous Harris Tweeds which 
are woven in these small black houses chiefly on the Isle of Harris. 
We are particularly concerned with the people of early Scotch descent 
who possess a physique that rivals that found in almost any place in the world. They are descendants of the original Gaelic stock which is their ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED GAELICS 47 
language today, and the only one which a large percentage of them can 
speak. This island has only one port which means that most of the shore 
line still provides primitive living conditions as does the central part of 
the island. It was a great surprise, and indeed a very happy one, to find 
such high types of manhood and womanhood as exist among the occu￾pants of these rustic thatched-roof homes, usually located in an expanse 
of heather-covered treeless plains. It would be hard to visualize a more 
complete isolation for child life than many of these homes provide, and 
one marvels at the refinement, intelligence, and strength of character of 
these rugged people. They resent, and I think justly so, the critical and 
uncomplimentary references made to their homes in attaching to them 
the name “black-houses.” Several that we visited were artistically deco￾rated with clean wallpaper and improvised hangings. 
One would expect that in their one seaport town of Stornoway things 
would be gay over the week-end, if not boisterous, with between four 
and five thousand fishermen and seamen on shore-leave from Saturday 
until midnight Sunday. On Saturday evening the sidewalks were crowded 
with happy carefree people, but no boisterousness and no drinking were 
to be seen. Sunday the people went in throngs to their various churches. 
Before the sailors went aboard their crafts on Sunday evening they met 
in bands on the street and on the piers for religious singing and prayers 
for safety on their next fishing expedition. One could not buy a postage 
stamp, a picture card, or a newspaper, could not hire a taxi, and could 
not find a place of amusement open on Sunday. Everybody has reverence 
for the Sabbath day on the Isle of Lewis. Every activity is made sub￾servient to their observance of the Sabbath day. In few places in the 
world are moral standards so high. One wonders if the bleak winds 
which thrash the north Atlantic from our Labrador and Greenland 
coasts have not tempered the souls of these people and created in 
them higher levels of nobility and exalted human expression. These 
people are the outposts of the western fringe of the European continent. 
Just as one sees in Brittany, on the west coast of France, the prehistoric 
druidical stone forest marking a civilization which existed so far in the 
past as to be without historic records except in its monuments; so, too, we 
find here the forest of granite slabs in which these sturdy prehistoric 
souls worshipped their divinities before they were crowded into the 
sea by the westward moving hordes. When one realizes the distance that 
these heavy stones had to be transported, a distance of probably twenty 
miles over difficult terrain, we can appreciate the task. Their size can be 
calculated from the depth to which they must be buried in order to stand 
erect even to this day. 48 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
We are concerned primarily with the physical development of the 
people, and particularly with their freedom from dental caries or tooth 
decay. One has only to see them carrying their burdens of peat or to 
observe the ease with which the fisherwomen on the docks carry their 
tubs of fish back from the cleaning table to the tiers of packing barrels 
to be convinced that these people have not only been trained to work, 
but have physiques equal to the task. These studies included the making 
of dental examinations, the taking of photographs, the obtaining of 
samples of saliva for chemical analysis, the gathering of detailed clinical 
records, and the collecting of samples of food for chemical analysis and 
detailed nutritional data. 
Communication is very difficult among many of these islands. It would 
be difficult to find more complete isolation than some of them afford. 
We tried to get to the islands of Taransay and Scarpa on the west coast 
of the Isle of Harris, but were unable to obtain transportation since the 
trip can be made only in special, seaworthy crafts, which will undertake 
the passage only at certain phases of the tide and at certain directions of 
the winds. On one of these islands, we were told, the growing boys and 
girls had exceedingly high immunity to tooth decay. Their isolation was 
so great that a young woman of about twenty years of age who came to 
the Isle of Harris from Taransay Island had never seen milk in any larger 
quantity than drops. There are no dairy animals on that island. Their 
nutrition is provided by their oat products and fish, and by a very 
limited amount of vegetable foods. Lobsters and flat fish are a very im￾portant part of their foods. Fruits are practically unknown. Yet the 
physiques of these people are remarkably fine. 
It was necessary sometimes for us to engage skilled seamen and their 
crafts to make a special trip to some of these isolated islands. These sea￾men watch critically the tide, wind and sky, and determine the length of 
time it will be safe to travel in a certain direction under conditions exist￾ing in the speed of the running tide and the periodic change of the wind. 
Some of the islands are isolated by severe weather conditions for many 
months of the year. 
These islands have been important in the whaling industry, even up 
to recent years. We visited a whaling station on the Isle of Harris, not 
active at this time, where monsters of the sea were towed into a deep bay. 
In the interior of the Isle of Lewis the teeth of the growing boys and 
girls had a very high degree of perfection, with only 1.3 teeth out of 
every hundred examined that had even been attacked by dental cartes. 
An important part of the study of these islands was the observations 
made on conditions at the fringe of civilization. A typical cross-section ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED GAELICS 49 
of the residents of the seaport town of Stornoway can be seen assembled 
on the docks to greet the arrival of the evening boat, the principal event 
of the community. The group consists largely of adult young people. In 
a count of one hundred individuals appearing to be between the ages 
of twenty and forty, twenty-five were already wearing artificial teeth, 
and as many more would have been more presentable had they too been 
so equipped. Dental caries was very extensive in the modernized section 
of Stornoway. Since an important part of these studies involved a deter￾mination of the kinds and quantities of foods eaten, it was necessary to 
visit the sources available for purchasing foods in each town studied. In 
Stornoway, one could purchase angel food cake, white bread, as snow 
white as that to be found in any community in the world, many other 
white-flour products; also, canned marmalades, canned vegetables, sweet￾ened fruit juices, jams, confections of every type filled the store windows 
and counters. These foods probably made a great appeal both because 
of their variety and their high sugar content to the pallets of these primi￾tive people. The difference in physical appearance of the child life of 
Stornoway from that of the interior of the Isle of Lewis was striking. 
We found a family on the opposite coast of the island where the two 
boys shown in the upper half of Fig. 6 resided. One had excellent teeth 
and the other had rampant caries. These boys were brothers eating at the 
same table. The older boy, with excellent teeth, was still enjoying primi￾tive food of oatmeal and oatcake and sea foods with some limited dairy 
products. The younger boy, seen to the left, had extensive tooth decay. 
Many teeth were missing including two in the front. He insisted on hay￾ing white bread, jam, highly sweetened coffee and also sweet chocolates. 
His father told me with deep concern how difficult it was for this boy to 
get up in the morning and go to work. 
One of the sad stories of the Isle of Lewis has to do with the recent 
rapid progress of the white plague. The younger generation of the mod￾ernized part of the Isle of Lewis is not showing the same resistance to 
tuberculosis as their ancestors. Indeed a special hospital has been built at 
Stornoway for the rapidly increasing number of tubercular patients, 
particularly for girls between twenty and thirty years of age. The super￾intendent told me with deep concern of the rapidity with which this 
menace is growing. Apparently very little consideration was being given 
to the change in nutrition as a possible explanation for the failure of this 
generation to show the defense of previous generations against pulmo￾nary tuberculosis. In this connection much blame had been placed upon 
the housing conditions, it being thought that the thatched-roof house 
with its smoke-laden air was an important contributing factor, notwith- 50 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

standing the fact that former generations had been free from the disease. 
I was told that the incidence of tuberculosis was frequently the same in 
the modern homes as it was in the thatched-roof homes. It was of special 
interest to observe the mental attitude of the native with regard to the 
thatched-roof house. Again and again, we saw the new house built beside 
the old one, and the people apparently living in the new one, but still 
keeping the smoke smudging through the thatch of the old thatched-roof 
house. When I inquired regarding this I was told by one of the clear￾thinking residents that this thatch collected something from the smoke 
which when put in the soil doubled the growth of plants and yield of 
grain. He showed me with keen interest two patches of grain which 
seem to demonstrate the soundness of his contention. 
I was particularly interested in studying the growing boys and girls 
at a place called Scalpay in the Isle of Harris. This Island is very rocky 
and has only small patches of soil for available pasturage. For nutrition, 
the children of this community were dependent very largely on oatmeal 
porridge, oatcake and sea foods. An examination of the growing boys 
and girls disclosed the fact that only one tooth out of every hundred ex￾amined had ever been attacked by tooth decay. The general physical 
development of these children was excellent, as may be seen in the upper 
half of Fig. 7. Note their broad faces. 
This is in striking contrast with the children of the hamlet of Tarbert 
which is the only shipping port on the Isle of Harris, and the place of ex￾port of most of the famous Harris tweeds which are manufactured on 
- looms in the various crofters’ homes. These Tarbert children had an 
incidence of 32.4 carious teeth out of every hundred teeth examined. The 
distance between these two points is not over ten miles and both have 
equal facilities for obtaining sea foods, being on the coast. Only the latter, 
however, has access to modern foods, since it supports a white bread 
bakery store with modern jams, marmalades, and other kinds of canned 
foods. In studying the tragedy of the rampant tooth decay in the mouth 
of a young man, I asked him regarding his plans and he stated that he 
was expecting to go to Stornoway about sixty miles away in the near 
future, where there was a dentist, and have all his teeth extracted and 
plates made. He said that it was no use to have any teeth filled, that he 
would have to lose them anyway since that was everybody’s experience 
in Tarbert. The young women were in just as poor a condition. 
Through the department of dental inspection for north Scotland, I 
learned of a place on the Isle of Skye, Airth of Sleat, in which only a 
few years ago there were thirty-six children in the school, and not one 
case of dental caries in the group. My examination of the children in this 52 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

community disclosed two groups, one living exclusively on modern foods, and the other on primitive foods. Those living on primitive foods had only 0.7 carious teeth per hundred, while those in the group living on modern foods had 16.3, or twenty-three times as many. This community living near the sea had recently been connected with the outside world by daily steamboat service which delivered to the people modern foods of various kinds, and within this community a modern bakery, and a supply house for purchasing the canned vege￾tables, jams and marmalades had been established. This district was just 
in the process of being modernized. 
I examined teeth of several people in the seventies and eighties, and 
except for gingival infections with some loosening of the teeth, nearly all 
of the teeth were present and there was very little evidnce that dental 
caries had ever existed. The elderly people were bemoaning the fact that 
the generation that was growing up had not the health of former genera￾tions. I asked what their explanation was and they pointed to two stone 
grinding mills which they said had ground the oats for oatcake and por￾ridge for their families and preceding families for hundreds of years. 
Though they prized them highly, the plea that they would be helpful in 
educational work in America induced them to sell the mills to me. They 
told us with great concern of the recent rapid decline in health of the 
young people of this district. 
This one-time well-populated Island, the misty Isle of Skye, still has 
one of the finest of the famous old castles, that belonging to the Dun￾vegan clan. It participated in the romantic life of Prince Charlie. The 
castle equipment still boasts the grandeur of a past glory. Among the 
relics is a horn which measured the draft to be drunk by a prospective 
chieftain before he could aspire to the leadership of the clan. He must 
drink its contents of two quarts without stopping. Again the character 
of that manhood is reflected in the fact that although a bounty of thirty 
thousand pounds was placed upon the head of Prince Charlie, none of the 
many who knew his place of hiding betrayed it. 
On my return from the Outer Hebrides to Scotland, I was concerned 
to obtain information from government officials relative to the incidence 
of tooth decay and the degenerative diseases in various parts of north 
Scotland. I was advised that in the last fifty years the average height of 
Scotch men in some parts decreased four inches, and that this had been 
coincident with the general change from high immunity to dental caries 
to a loss of immunity in a great part of this general district. A study of 
the market places revealed that a large part of the nutrition was shipped 
into the district in the form of refined flours and canned goods and sugar. 54 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
There were very few herds of dairy cattle to be seen. It was explained 
that even the highland cattle did not do as well as formerly on the 
same ranges. 
As one proceeds from the north of Scotland southward to England 
and Wales, there is a marked increase in the percentage of individuals 
wearing artificial restorations or in need of them. In several communi￾ties this reached fifty per cent of adults over thirty years of age. An 
effort was made to find primitive people in the high country of Wales, 
but without success. We were advised that about the only place that we 
would be likely to find people living under primitive conditions would 
be on the Island of Bardsey off the northwest coast of Wales. This is a 
rock and storm-bound island with the decadent walls of an old castle and 
a community made up largely of recently imported colonists whom we 
were advised had been taken to the Island to re-populate it. There is con￾siderable good farm land, but very limited grazing stock. Formerly the 
Island had produced the foods for its inhabitants with the assistance of 
the sea. These sources of natural foods have been largely displaced with 
imported white flour, marmalades, sugar, jams and canned goods. We 
found the physical condition of the people very poor, particularly that of 
the growing boys and girls. Tooth decay was so wide-spread that 27.6 
out of every hundred teeth examined in the growing boys and girls had 
already been attacked by dental caries. It was even active in three year 
olds. From a conference with the director of public health of this district 
I learned that tuberculosis constituted a very great problem, not only 
for the people on this island, but for those of many districts of northern 
Wales. This was ascribed to the lowered defense of the people due to 
causes unknown. It had been noted that individuals with rampant tooth 
decay were more susceptible to pulmonary tuberculosis. 
While on the Island of Bardsey, I inquired as to what they thought 
was the cause of such extensive tooth decay as we found, and was told 
that they were familiar with the cause and that it was due to close contact 
with the salt water and salt air. When I asked why many of the old people 
who had lived by the sea all their lives in some districts still had practi￾cally all their teeth and had never had tooth decay, no explanation was 
available. This they said was the reason that had been given in answer 
to their inquiries. 
There is a very remarkable history written in the ruins of the island, 
and in the faces of the people who live on the Island of Bardsey. The 
rugged walls of ancient castles bespeak the glory and power of the 
people who lived proudly in past centuries. They are testified to also 
by the monuments in the cemeteries; but a new era has come to this ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED GAELICS any 
island. The director of public health, of this district of Wales, including Bardsey Island, told me the story of the decline and almost complete 
extinction of the population due to tuberculosis. He also told how the 
government had re-populated the Island with fifty healthy young fami￾lies, and then the sad story of how these new settlers were breaking down 
as rapidly as the former occupants. 
The lower photograph in Fig. 7 is of a family of four children in wh Jse 
faces the tragic story is deeply written. Everyone is a mouth breather and 
everyone has rampant tooth decay. These people are products of mod￾ernization on this island which one time produced vigorous children and 
stalwart men and women. It is important to compare the faces of vhe 
children of the Isle of Bardsey shown in Fig. 7 below with those shown in 
Fig. 7 above living in an isolated district in the Isle of Harris. As we will 
see later, the facial deformity does not reach its maximum severity until 
the eruption of the second dentition and the development of the adult 
face, usually at from nine to fourteen years of age. In cases of extreme 
injury, however, we find it appearing in the childhood face during the 
period of temporary or deciduous dentition. These children will, doulbt￾less, be much more seriously deformed when their permanent dentitions 
and adult faces develop. It is important for us to keep this picture in 
mind in its relation to the high incidence of tuberculosis as we read 
succeeding chapters and find the part played by modernization in break￾ing down the defense of individuals to infective processes including 
tuberculosis. 
In Fig. 6 (lower left) is a young girl from the Isle of Bardsey. She is 
about seventeen years of age. Her teeth were wrecked with dental caries, 
the disease involving even the front teeth. We ate a meal at the home in 
which she was living. It consisted of white bread, butter and jam, all 
imported to the island. This is in striking contrast with the picture of 
the girl shown in Fig. 6 (lower right) living in the Isle of Lweis, in the 
central area. She has splendidly formed dental arches and a high im￾munity to tooth decay. Her diet and that of her parents was oatmeal 
porridge and oatcake and fish which built stalwart people. The change in 
the two generations was illustrated by a little girl and her grandfather 
on the Isle of Skye. He was the product of the old régime, and about 
eighty years of age. He was carrying the harvest from the fields on his 
back when I stopped him to take his picture. He was typical of the 
stalwart product raised on the native foods. His granddaughter had 
pinched nostrils and narrowed face. Her dental arches were deformed 
and her teeth crowded. She was a mouth breather. She had the typical 
expression of the result of modernization after the parents had adopted 56 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

the modern foods of commerce, and abandoned the oatcake, oatmeal porridge and sea foods. 
Since a fundamental part of this study involves an examination of the accumulated wisdom of the primitive racial stocks, it is important that we look further into the matter of the smoked thatch. I was advised by the old. residents that a serious conflict existed between them and the health officials who came from outside to their island. The latter blamed the smoke for the sudden development of tuberculosis in acute form, 
and they insisted that the old procedure be entirely discontinued. For this purpose the government gave very substantial assistance in the 
building of new and modern homes. The experienced natives contended 
that the oat crop would not mature in that severe climate without being 
fertilized with the smoked thatch. While they were willing to move into 
the new house, they were not willing to give up the smoking of the oat 
straw used for the thatch to prepare it for fertilizing the ground. I 
brought some of this smoked thatch with me both for chemical analysis 
and for testing for the influence on plant growth. This was done by add￾ing different quantities of the smoked thatch to a series of pots in which 
oat seeds were planted. In Fig. 8 will be seen the result. The pot to the 
right shows the result of planting the oats in a sandy soil almost like that 
of the Islands of the Outer Hebrides. The oats only grew to the fuzzy 
limited condition shown. As increasing amounts of this thatch were 
added to the soil, there was an increase in the ruggedness of the plants so 
that in the last pot to the left tall stalks were developed heavily loaded 
with grain which ripened by the time the growth shown in the other 
pots had occurred. The chemical analysis of the thatch showed that it 
contained a quantity of fixed nitrogen and other chemicals resulting 
from the peat smoke circulating through the thatch. This explains the 
confidence of the hardy old natives who insisted on being permitted to 
continue the smoking of the thatch even though they did not live in the 
house. 
A dietary program competent to build stalwart men and women and 
rugged boys and girls is provided the residents of these barren Islands, 
with their wind and storm-swept coasts, by a diet of oats used as oatcake 
and oatmeal porridge; together with fish products, including some fish 
organs and eggs. A seriously degenerated stock followed the displacement 
of this diet with a typical modern diet consisting of white bread, sugar, 
jams, syrup, chocolate, coffee, some fish without livers, canned vegetables, 
and eggs. . Craigflower Indian Reservation,

ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED ESKIMOS 
hoes the rise and fall of historic and prehistoric cultures that have 
often left their monuments and arts following each other in suc￾cession in the same location, one culture, the Eskimo, living on until 
today, brings us a robust sample of the Stone Age people. The Maya 
race is gone, but has left its monuments. The Indian race is rapidly 
changing or disappearing in North America. The Eskimo race has re￾mained true to ancestral type to give us a living demonstration of what 
Nature can do in the building of a race competent to withstand for 
thousands of years the rigors of an Arctic climate. Like the Indian, the 
Eskimo thrived as long as he was not blighted by the touch of modern 
civilization, but with it, like all primitives, he withers and dies. 
In his primitive state he has provided an example of physical excellence 
and dental perfection such as has seldom been excelled by any race in 
the past or present. We are concerned to know the secret of this great 
achievement since his circumscribed life greatly reduces the factors that 
may enter as controlling units in molding this excellence. While we are 
primarily concerned in this study with the characteristics of the Eskimo 
dentition and facial form and the effect upon it of his contact with 
modern civilization, we are also deeply concerned to know the formula 
of his nutrition in order that we may learn from it the secrets that will 
not only aid the unfortunate modern or so-called civilized races, but 
will also, if possible, provide means for assisting in their preservation. 
It is a sad commentary that with the coming of the white man the 
Eskimos and Indians are rapidly reduced both in numbers and physical 
excellence by the white man’s diseases. We have few problems more 
urgent or more challenging than that means shall soon be found for 
preventing the extermination of the primitive Americans. 
Many reports have been made with regard to the condition of the 
teeth of the Eskimos. Doubtless, all have been relatively authentic for 
the groups studied, which have been chiefly along the routes of com￾merce. Clearly those people would not represent the most primitive 
groups, which could only be located beyond the reach of contact with 
modern civilization. The problems involved strongly suggested the de￾59 60 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
sirability of locating and studying Eskimos in isolated districts. While 
dog teams could furnish means of approach in the winter season, they 
would not be available for summer travel. 
Through the kindness of Dr. Alexis Hrdli¢ka, who has made anthropo￾logical studies of the Eskimos in many of the districts of Alaska, I 
learned that the most primitive groups were located south of the Yukon 
in the country between it and Bristol Bay including the Delta and mouth 
of the Kuskokwim River. A government station has been established on 
the Kuskokwim River for which a government boat enters the mouth 
of the Kuskokwim to deliver supplies. It carries officials, but not pas￾sengers. This contact with civilization has made available modern foods 
for a limited district, chiefly at the point at which the boat Jands, namely 
Bethel. A portion of these supplies is transported by a stern-wheel river 
boat to settlements farther up the river. A great number, however, of 
Eskimos live between the mouth of the Kuskokwim and the mouth of 
the Yukon River, on the mainland and islands, a distance of several 
hundred miles, and have little or no contact with this food. 
Accordingly, our program for making these field studies among the 
Eskimos in 1933 required transportation over long distances and into 
districts where travelling facilities were practically non-existent by 
other means than by modern airplane. Mrs. Price accompanies and 
assists me with my records. Our itinerary included steamship serv￾ice to Seward in western Alaska and railway to Anchorage, where an 
airplane was chartered which carried us to various districts in western 
and central Alaska. This plane carried our field equipment, and travelled 
to the points selected. The great Alaska mountain range, culminating 
in the magnificent Mt. McKinley, stretches across Alaska from the 
Aleutian Peninsula at the southwest far into the heart of this vast terri￾tory. The highest mountain in the United States proper is Mt. Whitney, 
14,502 feet. The highest mountain in Canada is Mt. Logan, 19,539 feet. 
Alaska, however, boasts many mountains that are higher than any of 
these, many of which are in this range. Mt. McKinley is 20,300 feet. It 
was necessary for us to surmount this magnificent range to reach the 
territory in which our investigations were to be made. The special air￾plane selected was equipped with radio for both sending and receiving, 
and was in touch, or could be in touch at all times, with the Signal 
Service Corps, as well as with the headquarters and branches of the 
Company. Owing to clouds in the selected pass, the pilot found it neces￾sary to go one hundred fifty miles out of his course to find one that 
was clear enough to fly through. Beyond these mountains were vast ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED ESKIMOS 61 
areas of bare wilderness with no signs of human life. Moose were fre- quently seen. 
Our first objective was to find, if possible, a band of Indians reported to live on Stony River. They had been described as being very primi- tive. Our pilot, who was well informed about this region, said this was 
the first time he had even landed in this district. All the people were 
busy catching and storing the running salmon. After drying the fish 
they are smoked for a few hours and then stored for winter use. These 
thrifty people have physical features quite unlike the Indians of cen￾tral, southern and eastern Alaska. Of the twelve individuals studied 
here, ten had lived entirely on the native foods or practically so. In their 
288 teeth only one tooth was found that had ever been attacked by 
tooth decay, or 0.3 per cent. Two had come up from the Kuskokwim 
River, of which the Stony River is a branch. There, they had received 
a considerable quantity of the “store grub” that had been shipped up 
the Kuskokwim from Bethel. Twenty-seven per cent of the teeth of 
these two had been attacked by dental caries. 
We then proceeded to Sleet Mute, on the Kuskokwim River, where 
three individuals were found who had lived entirely on native foods 
None of them had ever had a tooth attacked by tooth decay. Seven 
others had lived partly on native foods and partly on “store grub,” and 
they had dental caries in 12.2 per cent of their teeth. 
At Crooked Creek, the next settlement, eight individuals were exam￾ined and of their 216 teeth forty-one, or 18.9 per cent, had caries. All 
but one of these were living in considerable part on “store grub,” and 
this individual had no dental caries. 
At Napimute, 16 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by dental 
caries, but no individuals studied here were living entirely on native 
foods. 
Bethel is the largest settlement on the Kuskokwim, and contains in 
addition to the white residents many visiting Eskimos from the nearby 
Tundra country surrounding it. Eighty-eight individuals studied here 
were largely Eskimos and mixed bloods. Of their 2,490 teeth, 11.6 
per cent, or 281 teeth, had been attacked by tooth decay. Of these 
eighty-eight individuals twenty-seven with 796 teeth had lived almost 
exclusively on natural foods, and in this group only one tooth was 
found with dental caries, or 0.1 per cent. Forty individuals were living 
almost exclusively on modern foods as shipped in by the government 
supply boat. Of their 1,094 teeth, 252, or 21.1 per cent, had been at￾tacked by tooth decay. Twenty-one individuals were living partly on 62 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
native foods and partly on “store grub,” and of their 600 teeth thirty￾eight, or 6.3 per cent, had been attacked by tooth decay. 
At Kokamute, on the Bering Sea at the mouth of the Kuskokwim 
River, a large band of very primitive Eskimos was studied. They had 
come from the vicinity of Nelson Island, a district which has had ex￾ceedingly little contact with modern civilization. In this group twenty￾eight individuals with 820 teeth showed only one tooth, or 0.1 per cent, 
that had ever been attacked by dental caries. 
Bethel Island is situated in the Kuskokwim River. It is visited in the 
summer by Eskimos from the Tundra Country for laying in their store 
of fish for winter use. Of fifteen individuals here, thirteen, with 410 
teeth, had lived exclusively on native foods, and not a single tooth had 
been attacked by dental caries. Two had come from Bethel, and of 
their sixty teeth twenty-one or 35 per cent had been attacked by tooth 
decay. 
In the various groups in the lower Kuskokwim seventy-two individ￾uals who were living exclusively on native foods had in their 2,138 
teeth only two teeth or 0.09 per cent that had ever been attacked by 
tooth decay. In this district eighty-one individuals were studied who 
had been living in part or in considerable part on modern foods, and of 
their 2,254 teeth 394 or 13 per cent had been attacked by dental caries. 
This represents an increase in dental caries of 144 fold. 
It next became desirable to study a district that had been in contact 
with the foods of modern commerce for many years, and for this Holy 
Cross was selected. This community is located on the Yukon River 
above the Arctic Circle. It has been in contact with the summer com￾merce of the Yukon for several decades. It has one of the oldest and 
best organized Catholic Missions of Alaska. The individuals studied were 
all in the school connected with the Mission. The students had come 
from as far north as Point Barrow on the Arctic Ocean and west to the 
Bering Straits. All but one had been in contact with and had used mod￾ern foods before coming to the Mission, and were using them while 
there. This one individual had lived exclusively on native foods before 
coming to the Mission and he had no carious teeth. In eight individuals 
with 224 teeth, who had lived very largely on modern foods, forty￾two teeth or 18.7 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. Four in￾dividuals had lived partly on native foods and partly on modern foods, 
and of their 112 teeth four, or 3.5 per cent, had been attacked by 
tooth decay. 
It is of interest that while the Eskimos and Indians have lived in ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED ESKIMOS 63 
accord, they have not intermarried. The Eskimos occupy the lower 
section of the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers, and the Bering Sea fron￾tier. The Indians have occupied the Upper waterways of both these 
rivers. The next place selected for study was McGrath, which is on the 
Upper Kuskokwim not far distant from the McKinley Mountain Range. 
It is the upper terminus of navigation on the Kuskokwim River for the 
stern-wheel river boats. Its chief importance lies in the fact that it is 
the division point on the Cross Alaska Aeroplane Routes from Anchor￾age or Fairbanks to Nome and other western points. Its population con￾sists of several white prospectors and miners who have stayed in the 
country following the gold rush. Some of them have married Indian and 
Eskimo women. Of twenty-one individuals only one had lived almost 
exclusively on native foods and she had no dental caries. Twenty had 
lived chiefly on imported foods, and of their 527 teeth 175, or 33.2 
per cent, had been attacked by tooth decay. 
Among the residents of McGrath there is a remarkable family. The 
father is an American mining engineer who has spent much of his life 
in that country. His wife is a charming Eskimo woman of splendid 
intelligence and fine personality. She had come originally from the 
lower Kuskokwim and was one of the primitive Eskimo stock. While 
mining interests had provided food supplies for the family, shipped 
from the United States, she followed her early training and insisted on 
catching and storing salmon in season as an important part of her own 
dietary. The salmon were dried and smoked as was the custom of her 
people. She is the mother of at least twenty children, for she could give 
the names of that many. Only eleven were living, however, several hav￾ing died from tuberculosis. Notwithstanding her many overloads, not a 
single tooth had ever been attacked by tooth decay. A lower anterior 
tooth had been broken. A picture of this woman is shown in Fig. 9 
(upper, left). There has been extensive wear of the teeth, as is char￾acteristic of the teeth of many of the Eskimos, a matter which we will 
presently discuss. It is of interest to note the splendid symmetry of her 
dental arches. Her children and husband and son-in-law had lived very 
largely on modern foods and in these eight individuals with 212 teeth 
eighty-seven, or 41 per cent, had been attacked by tooth decay. Her 
oldest living daughter is twenty-two years of age. She has a narrowing 
of the upper arch and extensive tooth decay. Another daughter, sixteen, 
is a beautiful girl except for her narrow dental arches. She was reported 
by our pilot to have become so deeply interested in the engines of the 
aircrafts as they stopped at this point for servicing and fuel that she 64 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Fic. 9. Typical native Alaskan Eskimos. Note the broad faces and broad arches and no

had become expert in tuning up and conditioning aeroplane motors. She, doubtless, inherited some of the genius of her father, who is a min- ing engineer. Twelve of her teeth had been attacked by dental caries. One does not get a conception of the magnificent dental develop- ment of the more primitive Eskimos simply by learning that they have freedom from dental caries. The size and strength of the mandible, the 
breadth of the face and the strength of the muscles of mastication all 
reach a degree of excellence that is seldom seen in other races. This is 
typically illustrated in Fig. 9. I was told that an average adult Eskimo 
man can carry one hundred pounds in each hand and one hundred 
pounds in his teeth with ease for a considerable distance. This illustrates 
the physical development of other parts of the body as well as the jaws, 
and suggests that the exercising of the jaws is not the sole reason for 
their very fine teeth, since the superb development of the musculature 
includes all parts of the body. It has also been suggested that chewing 
of tough foods, by building teeth of exceptionally fine quality, has been 
an important factor in the establishment of immunity to caries. As will 
be shown presently, the teeth of these individuals with their excellent 
physical development and fine tooth structure develop caries when they 
depart from their native foods and adopt our modern foods. 
Much has been reported in the literature of the excessive wear of the 
Eskimos’ teeth, which in the case of the women has been ascribed to 
the chewing of the leather in the process of tanning. It is of interest 
that while many of the teeth studied gave evidence of excessive wear in￾volving the crowns to a depth that in many individuals would have 
exposed the pulps, there was in no case an open pulp chamber. They 
were always filled with secondary dentin. This is important since our 
newer knowledge indicates that with the chemical characteristics of 
their food we might expect that secondary dentin would be readily 
formed within the pulp chambers by a process similar to that which 
occurs in many individuals under a diet reinforced with mineral and 
activator-providing foods. One old Eskimo had a scar on his lower lip, 
which was the result of perforations for carrying a decoration as prac￾ticed by his tribe. I have found primitive tribes in several parts of the 
world with this marking. 
The principal outer garment worn by the Eskimo for the more 
primitive groups consists of a parka carrying a hood which is pulled 
over the head and closed around the neck with a shirr string, while 
another shirr string controls the size of the face opening in the hood 
when it is up. In the summer this is made of cloth or of skin without 66 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
the fur. A typical case is shown in Fig. 9. It will again be noted that 
the teeth are excessively worn. 
Owing to the bleakness of the winds off the Bering Sea, even in the

summer many of the women wear furs. A typical mother and child 
dressed in their warm clothing are shown in Fig. 10. The Eskimo women 
are both artistic and skillful in needle work. They use fur of different 
colors for decorating their garments. These women make artistic deco￾rations by carving ivory from walrus teeth and from the buried tusks 
of the hairy mammoth that wandered over the Tundra tens of thou￾sands of years ago. The ear decoration of this Eskimo woman is a typical 
design. This mother’s teeth are literally “two rows of pearls.” It is im￾portant to note the width of the arches. One is continually impressed 
with the magnificent health of the child life which is illustrated in 
Fig. 10. In our various contacts with them we never heard an Eskimo 
child crying except when hungry, or frightened by the presence of 
strangers. The women are characterized by the abundance of breast￾food which almost always develops normally and is maintained without 
difficulty for a year. The mothers were completely free of dental caries, 
and I was told that the children of the Eskimos have no difficulties 
with the cutting of their teeth.

Fic. 11. When the primitive Alaskan Eskimos obtain the white man’s foods, dental 
caries become active. Pyorrhea also often becomes severe. In many districts dental service 
cannot be obtained and suffering is acute and prolonged. 68 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
The excellence of dentitions among the Eskimos has been a charac￾teristic also of the skulls that have been excavated in various parts of 
Alaska. 
It might be expected that such wonderfully formed teeth would 
maintain so high an immunity to dental caries that their proud pos￾sessors would never be troubled with tooth decay. This, unfortunately, 
is not the case, a fact of great significance in evaluating our modern 
theories of the causes of dental caries. When these adult Eskimos ex￾change their foods for our modern foods, which we will discuss in 
Chapter 15, they often have very extensive tooth decay and suffer 
severely. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 11, for these Eskimos’ teeth 
had been seriously wrecked by tooth decay. They had been living on 
modern foods and were typical of a large number who are in contact 
with the Bering Sea ports. Their plight often becomes tragic since there 
are no dentists in these districts. 
A typical effect of modernization on a growing girl was shown in a 
case in which the central incisors and 16 other teeth were attacked by 
dental caries. Sixty-four per cent of her teeth had tooth decay. 
There are no dentists in western Alaska, north or west of Anchorage, 
which is near the southern coast, except at Fairbanks which, like An￾chorage, is many hundreds of miles from these Eskimos. It would take 
months for them to make the journey in winter by dog team, and it 
would be practically impossible to make it in the summer season by any 
means of travel except by aeroplane, which clearly these people could 
not afford. Their dilemma is, accordingly, most tragic when they sud￾denly become victims of diseases which require hospitalization or skilled 
medical or dental service. One mining engineer in the interior told me 
that he had spent two thousand dollars to have a dentist brought in by 
aeroplane to render dental service. On my examination of his mouth 
I found twenty-nine of his thirty-two teeth had been attacked by 
dental caries. 
One important phase of modern degeneration, namely, change in 
facial and dental arch form and other physical expressions, is of inter￾est. It is a matter of great significance that the Eskimos who are living in isolated districts and on native foods have produced uniformly broad 
dental arches and typical Eskimo facial patterns. Even the first genera- tion forsaking that diet and using the modern diet, presents large num- bers of individuals with marked changes in facial and dental arch form. In Fig. 12 will be seen four Eskimo girls who are of the first generation following the adoption of modernized foods by their parents. All have ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED ESKIMOS 69

bloods. These girls are pure-blooded Eskimos whose parents have nor￾mally formed dental arches. 
We are particularly concerned with the foods used by these primitive 
Eskimos. They almost always have their homes on or near deep water. 
Their skill in handling their kayaks is most remarkable. During the 
salmon running season they store large quantities of dried salmon. They 
spear many of these fish from their kayaks; even young boys are very 
skillful. They land salmon so large that they can hardly lift them. They 
are expert in spearing seals from these light crafts. Seal oil provides a 
very important part of their nutrition. As each piece of fish is broken 
off, it is dipped in seal oil. I obtained some seal oil from them and 
brought it to my laboratory for analyzing for its vitamin content. It 
proved to be one of the richest foods in vitamin A that I have found. 
The fish are hung on racks in the wind for drying. Fish eggs are also 
spread out to dry, as shown in Fig. 13. These foods constitute a very 
important part of the nutrition of the small children after they are 
weaned. Naturally, the drifting sands of the bleak Bering Straits lodge ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED ESKIMOS 71 
upon and cling to the moist surfaces of the fish that are hung up to dry. This constitutes the principal cause for the excessive wear of the 
Eskimos’ teeth in both men and women.

Fic. 14. This white boy was born and raised in Alaska on imported foods. His facial 
deformity includes a lack of development of the air passages, so that he breathes through 
his mouth. Lack of bone development creates the crowded condition of the teeth. Note 
his narrow nostrils. 
The food of these Eskimos in their native state includes caribou, 
ground nuts which are gathered by mice and stored in caches, kelp 
which is gathered in season and stored for winter use, berries including 
cranberries which are preserved by freezing, blossoms of flowers pre￾served in seal oil, sorrel grass preserved in seal oil, and quantities of 
frozen fish. Another important food factor consists of the organs of the 
large animals of the sea, including certain layers of the skin of one of 
the species of whale, which has been found to be very high in vitamin C. 
Since contact with our modern civilization, the Eskimo population 
for Alaska is very rapidly declining. One authority has quoted the re￾duction of 50 per cent in population in seventy-five years. 
An important observation has been made relative to the rapid short￾ening of the average life by Dr. V. E. Levine and Professor C. W. 
Bauer, of Creighton University, Nebraska, who reported: 
Cordova, Alaska, Oct. 26, 1934—-Due to susceptibility to tuberculosis and 
other diseases the average life span of the Eskimo of Alaska is only 20 years and 72 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
their race is doomed to extinction within a few generations unless modern medi￾cal science comes to their aid. 
Unless a very radical change is made in the interference with the 
native supply of game and sea foods, the Eskimo population seems 
destined to have a rapid decline and an early extinction. Their primi￾tive fish foods have been largely curtailed by the encroachment on their 
salmon streams made by modern canneries. 
It is of interest to discuss in connection with the Alaskan Eskimo 
two white boys (one is shown in Fig. 14), who were sons of a mining 
engineer. They had been born and raised in a mining camp in Alaska, 
where their foods had been almost entirely shipped in. I travelled with 
the mother of these two boys who was bringing them to the United 
States for operations on their noses, because they were mouth-breathers. 
It is important to observe the marked underdevelopment of both the 
middle third and lower third of the face of the boy shown in Fig. 14. 
The nutrition of the family during their development and growth had 
been largely provided in package form shipped in from the United 
States. Their disfiguration is typical of that of large numbers that are 
developing in our highly modernized communities, and is similar, in 
general, to the deformities which develop in the primitive races after 
they adopt the modernized nutrition. 
Notwithstanding the very inhospitable part of the world in which 
they reside, with nine or ten months of winter and only two or three 
of summer, and in spite of the absence for long periods of plant foods 
and dairy products and eggs, the Eskimos were able to provide their 
bodies with all the mineral and vitamin requirements from sea foods, 
stored greens and berries and plants from the sea. Chapter 6 
PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS 
INES seems to have made one of her large scale demonstrations 
in the Americas of the power of adaptation of a single racial 
stock to the scale of climates ranging from torrid jungles of the tropics 
to the Arctics. The various members of the American Indian race seem 
clearly to have come from a common origin. The route by which they 
reached America from Asia as suggested by anthropologists was by way 
of the Bering Strait. Within a decade a Russian engineer has crossed 
from Asia to America on the pack ice of the Bering sea, a distance of 
ninety miles. If this is possible now, how much more likely is it that 
it has been possible in earlier periods of the world’s history, as, for ex￾ample, during or following the last ice age, or at the time of an earlier 
ice age. The American Indian, therefore, provides a very remarkable 
opportunity to study both the capacity for adaptability to different en￾vironments and the variations that different environments can produce 
in a single racial stock. That the Indian of today is not in general a 
counterpart of the native resident at the time of the discovery of Amer￾ica by Columbus is clearly demonstrated both by the skeletal material 
and by the early records. 
Our problem involved the location and study of groups of the orig￾inal stock, if such were to be found, who were living in accordance 
with the tradition of their race and as little affected as might be pos￾sible by the influence of the white man. At first thought it might seem 
impossible that such groups can exist, but as a matter of fact there are 
still great areas of the American continent inhabited by the original 
stock living in areas still unexplored. In order to find Indians as little 
changed as possible by reason of their contact with the white man, 
particularly with the white man’s foods, I went to northern Canada to 
the region inside the Rocky Mountain range to study the Indians of 
Northern British Columbia and the Yukon territory. Since an aero￾plane could not be used, owing to the lack of a base of supplies for fuel 
for the return trip; and since the MacKenzie water route was im￾practicable (an expedition could not go up the waterways through 
Canada on the MacKenzie River and its branches and return the same 
73 74 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
season), the route selected was that which enters that territory from 
Alaska on the large waterway of the Stikine River. This river has cut 
its channel through the Coast and Cascade Ranges of mountains and has 
its origin in the high western watershed of the Rockies. It was particu￾larly desirable to reach a group of Indians who could not obtain the 
animal life of the sea, not even the running salmon. These fish do not 
enter the waterways draining to the Arctic. We used a high-powered 
river transport specially designed for going up rapids on the Stikine 
River to the end of navigation at Telegraph Creek. At this point large 
quantities of modern foods are stored during the short open navigation 
season of the summer to be exchanged for furs during the long winter. 
A Hudson Bay Post has been established at this point. Here a truck 
was chartered which took us over a trail across the Rocky Mountain 
Divide to the headwaters of the rivers flowing north to the Arctic. At 
this outpost two guides were engaged and a high powered scow char￾tered to make the trip down the waterways toward the Arctic on the 
Diese and Liard Rivers. This made it possible, in the summer of 1933, 
to make contact with large bands of Indians who had come out of the 
Pelly mountain country to exchange their catch of furs at the last out￾post of the Hudson Bay Company. Most of the Indians of Canada are 
under treaty with the Canadian Government whereby that government 
gives them an annual per capita bounty. This arrangement induces the 
Indians in the interior to come out to the designated centers to obtain 
the bounty. Since it is based on the number in the family, all of the 
children are brought. This treaty, however, was never signed by the 
Indians of the British Columbia and Yukon Territory. And, accord￾ingly, they have remained as nomadic wandering tribes following the 
moose and caribou herds in the necessary search to obtain their foods. 
The rigorous winters reach seventy degrees below zero. This pre￾cludes the possibility of maintaining dairy animals or growing seed 
cereals or fruits. The diet of these Indians is almost entirely limited to 
the wild animals of the chase. This made a study of them exceedingly 
important. The wisdom of these people regarding Nature’s laws, and 
their skill in adapting themselves to the rigorous climate and very 
limited variety of foods, and these often very hard to obtain, have 
developed a skill in the art of living comfortably with rugged Nature 
that has been approached by few other tribes in the world. The sense 
of honor among these tribes is so strong that practically all cabins, 
temporarily unoccupied due to the absence of the Indians on their hunt￾ing trip, were entirely unprotected by locks; and the valuables belong￾ing to the Indians were left in plain sight. The people were remarkably PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED INDIANS 75 
hospitable, and where they had not been taken advantage of were very kind. Many of the women had never seen a white woman until they saw Mrs. Price. Their knowledge of woodcraft as expressed in skill in building their cabins so that they would be kept comfortably warm and protected from the sub-zero weather was remarkable. Their plan￾ning ahead for storing provisions and firewood strongly emphasized 
their community spirit. When an Indian and his family moved to a 
camp site on a lake or river, they always girdled a few more trees than 
they would use for firewood so that there would be a plentiful supply 
of dry standing timber for future visitors to the camp. 
They lived in a country in which grizzly bears were common. Their 
pelts were highly prized and they captured many of them with baited 
pitfalls. Their knowledge of the use of different organs and tissues of 
the animals for providing a defense against certain of the affections of 
the body which we speak of as degenerative diseases was surprising. 
When I asked an old Indian, through an interpreter, why the Indians 
did not get scurvy he replied promptly that that was a white man’s 
disease. I asked whether it was possible for the Indians to get scurvy. 
He replied that it was, but said that the Indians know how to prevent 
it and the white man does not. When asked why he did not tell the 
white man how, his reply was that the white man knew too much to 
ask the Indian anything. I then asked him if he would tell me. He said 
he would if the chief said he might. He went to see the chief and re￾turned in about an hour, saying that the chief said he could tell me 
because I was a friend of the Indians and had come to tell the Indians 
not to eat the food in the white man’s store. He took me by the hand 
and led me to a log where we both sat down. He then described how 
when the Indian kills a moose he opens it up and at the back of the 
moose just above the kidney there are what he described as two small 
balls in the fat. These he said the Indian would take and cut up into as 
many pieces as there were little and big Indians in the family and each 
one would eat his piece. They would eat also the walls of the second 
stomach. By eating these parts of the animal the Indians would keep 
free from scurvy, which is due to the Jack of vitamin C. The Indians 
were getting vitamin C from _the adrenal glands and organs. “Modern 
science has very recently discovered that the adrenal glands are the 
richest sources of vitamin C in all animal or plant tissues. We found 
these Indians most cooperative in aiding us. We, of course, had taken 
presents that we thought would be appreciated by them, and we had

Fic. 16. At the point of modernization including the use of the foods of modern 
commerce, the health problem of the Indians is very different. These modernized Indian 
children are dying of tuberculosis which seldom kills the primitives. 
The condition of the teeth, and the shape of the dental arches and 
the facial form, were superb. Indeed, in several groups examined not 
a single tooth was found that had ever been attacked by tooth decay. 
In an examination of eighty-seven individuals having 2,464 teeth only 
four teeth were found that had ever been attacked by dental caries. 
This is equivalent to 0.16 per cent. As we came back to civilization and 
studied, successively, different groups with increasing amounts of con￾tact with modern civilization, we found dental caries increased pro￾gressively, reaching 25.5 per cent of all of the teeth examined at 
Telegraph Creek, the point of contact with the white man’s foods. As 
we came down the Stikine River to the Alaskan frontier towns, the 
dental caries problem increased to 40 per cent of all of the teeth. 
Careful inquiry regarding the presence of arthritis was made in the 
more isolated groups. We neither saw nor heard of a case in the isolated 
groups. However, at the point of contact with the foods of modern 
civilization many cases were found including ten bed-ridden cripples 
in a series of about twenty Indian homes. Some other affections made 78 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
their appearance here, particularly tuberculosis which was taking a very 
severe toll of the children who had been born at this center. In Fig. 16 
are seen two typical cases of tubercular involvement of glands of the 
neck. The suffering from tooth decay was tragic. There were no dentists, 
no doctors available within hundreds of miles to relieve suffering. 
The physiques of the Indians of the far north who are still living in 
their isolated locations and in accordance with their accumulated wis￾dom were superb. There were practically no irregular teeth, including 
no impacted third molars, as evidenced by the fact that all individuals 
old enough to have the molars erupted had them standing in position 
and functioning normally for mastication. The excellence of the dental 
arches is shown in Fig. 17. Where the Indians were using the white 
man’s food tooth decay was very severe, as shown in Fig. 18. In the 
new generation, after meeting the white civilization and using his foods, 
many developed crooked teeth, so-called, with deformed dental arches, 
as seen in Fig. 19. 
Contact was also made with representatives of relatively isolated 
primitive Indian stocks in the district south of Hudson Bay. These 
groups were reached by a newly projected railroad extending eastward 
and northward from Winnipeg, Manitoba, and we were thus brought 
into contact with the Indians that had come out of the waterways 
draining the Hudson Bay and from as far north as James Bay. They had 
come down to dispose of their furs in exchange for ammunition, 
blankets, etc. Since this contact was made only once or twice a year, it 
was quite impossible for the Indians to carry back a sufficient quantity 
of the foods of the white man to have great influence on their total 
diet for the year. They still lived on the wild animal game of the Jand. 
As in the northern country just reviewed, their principal large animal 
was the moose. These are treaty Indians, and many of them come out 
to this frontier to obtain the government bounty and, accordingly, 
were obliged to bring their families. The bounty here amounted to five 
dollars per head, a considerable income in exchange for blankets and 
other equipment. Some of these contact points were at the height of 
the land dividing the waters running north and east to James Bay and 
Hudson Bay, or south to Lake Superior. This was historic country that 
had been the meeting ground of the tribes of the northern waters with 
the tribes of the Great Lakes district. Many battles had been fought 
there. For comparison with these more primitive groups from the Hud￾son and James Bay watershed, I had the opportunity here of studying 
families that had taken up residence along the railroad or in its vicinity 
in order that they might have the advantage of exchanging furs for PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED INDIANS "pe 4

the modern white man’s foods. This gave us an excellent opportunity to 
study the effects of the modern dietary, of which an example is shown 
in Fig. 20. This Indian and his wife had built their bodies before the 
contact with the white man. He is about six feet tall. Both the parents 
had splendid dental arches and well formed faces. His teeth are shown 
in Fig. 20 (upper, left). Their two children shown in the photograph 
were born after the adoption of the white man’s foods brought in by 
the railroad. Both are mouth-breathers and both have narrow dental 
arches and marked underdevelopment of the middle third of the face. 
The older girl has tuberculosis. Another adult man is shown in Fig. 20 
(upper, right). He, like the generation he represents, has exceptionally 
fine dental arches and well developed face. 
At this point we again found many of the younger generation ill 
with tuberculosis or crippled with arthritis. Two of these are shown in 
Figy 21. 
For further comparison of the more isolated and more highly mod￾ernized groups a study was made of the Indians in the largest single 
Indian Reservation in Canada, which is located at Brantford, Ontario. 
In this group there are about 4,700 Indians living under highly mod￾ernized conditions provided by the Canadian Government. They live 
on very fertile land and in close proximity to a modern Canadian city. 
Each head of a family is provided with a tract of land from which he 
usually has an income sufficient to permit him to have an automobile. 
They were able to buy not only necessities and comforts according to 
the modern standards of the white man, but many of the luxuries as 
well. The government provides a well administered hospital and staff. 
When I asked the Director of this hospital, Dr. Davis, what the prin￾cipal use of the hospital was at that time (1933), he said that the 
demand for beds had completely changed in the twenty-eight years he 
had been there. The principal services requested at the hospital in 1933 
related to the problems of maternity. He stated that in his period of 
contact he had seen three generations of mothers. The grandmothers of 
the present generation would take a shawl and either alone or accom￾panied by one member of their family retire to the bush and give birth 
to the baby and return with it to the cabin. A problem of little dif￾ficulty or concern, it seemed. He stated that today the young mothers 
of this last generation are brought to his hospital sometimes after they 
have been in labor for days. They are entirely different from their 
grandmothers or even mothers in their capacity and efficiency in the 
matter of reproduction. He stated that that morning he had had two 84 NUTRITION AND

cases in which surgical interference was necessary in order to make birth possible. 
We had an opportunity here to study the effects of modernization. 
Indians are great lovers of sports, particularly of their own national game which is lacrosse. We were able to witness one of these contests with a team from another reservation. Indian families came in modern 
automobiles dressed in modern clothes and purchased pop and candy 
and modern confections at typical confection stands. These were highly 
modernized Indians. 
The group on this reservation, comprising approximately four thou￾sand seven hundred Indians, belong to the following tribes: Mohawks, 
Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas, Oneidas and Delawares making up the 
Six Nation or Iroquois group. A later addition to this group has been 
the Tuscaroras from the Carolinas. While there were many mixed 
bloods, there were also a goodly number of full-blooded Indian families, 
so that there was an opportunity to study comparatively the effects of 
intermingling of the Indians with the whites. As in previous investiga￾tions, a special effort was made to study the children from eight to 
sixteen years of age. Typical cases were selected from different environ￾ments. For example, boys and girls selected from a training school called 
Mohawk Institute, which was near the city of Brantford, represented 
one type of environment. There are approximately one hundred and 
sixty students under training here, and we were informed that they 
study half a day and work half a day. The boys are taught crafts￾manship and farming, the girls, home economics and garment making, 
and such practical training as would prepare them for later home build￾ing. While most of the boys and girls come from that reservation, a 
few are accepted from other reservations. It is of interest that 77 
per cent of the children in this Institution had suffered from earlier 
dental caries and that 17 per cent of all the teeth examined had already 
been attacked by dental caries. But this had occurred apparently before 
their entrance to the Institute, for we did not find a single case of active 
caries among those examined, and this is particularly important in con￾nection with their excellent nutrition. The Institute maintained a fine 
dairy herd and provided fresh vegetables, whole wheat bread, and lim￾ited the sugar and white flour. 
The children of this group were compared with children of approxi￾mately the same age in a public school of the reservation where it was 
found that 90 per cent had had dental caries, and that at present in 
70 per cent of the cases the caries was apparently active. It is impor- 86 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
tant to note that in this group 28.5 per cent of all the teeth examined 
had already been attacked by tooth decay. 
A study was made of patients at the reservation hospital where free 
service of all kinds is provided. We found that 83 per cent had suffered 
from dental caries, and that 23.2 per cent of all teeth had already been 
attacked by caries. 
We were particularly interested in the conditions obtaining in the 
homes, especially with the mothers. A typical young mother had ap￾proximately half her teeth attacked by dental caries, as had also her 
son, aged seven. The middle third of his face was underdeveloped and 
all of his upper anterior teeth were decayed to the gum line. 
A study was made of an Indian reservation in New York State for 
comparison and for making an estimate of typical modern American 
Indian life with regard to dental caries and nutrition. For this study a 
band of 450 in the Tuscarora Reservation northeast of Niagara Falls 
was visited. Here again we were fortunate to see the people in holiday 
mood since the study was made on Decoration Day and events of the 
year had been scheduled, a lacrosse match and a baseball game, between 
the Indians’ teams and white teams from adjacent towns. Several hun￾dred Indians were congregated to exhibit their best in wearing apparel, 
transportation equipment, and physical prowess. There was evidence of 
a similarity of features in the older Indians who had not been highly 
modernized, and a striking deficiency in the facial development of 
many of the moderns. 
A typical mother was studied at her home. She had four children. 
Her teeth were ravaged by dental caries. She was strictly modern, for 
she had gold inlays in some of her teeth. The roots of the missing teeth 
had not been extracted. Twenty of her teeth had active dental caries. 
Her little girl, aged four, already had twelve very badly carious teeth. 
Another daughter aged eight had sixteen carious teeth, and her son aged 
ten had six. The husband was in bed from an acute lung involvement, 
doubtless tuberculosis. The children were eating their noon day meal 
when we arrived, which consisted of a white bread and some stewed 
vegetables. Milk was available for only the small baby in arms. In this 
Tuscarora group 83 per cent of those examined had dental caries and 
38 per cent of all teeth had already been attacked by dental caries. 
Every one studied in this reservation was using white-flour products, 
none were using milk liberally, and only a few in even limited amounts. 
I was told that in both reservations a few years ago the Indians grew 
wheat and kept cows to provide a liberal supply of natural cereal and 
milk for their families, but of late this practice had been discontinued. PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED INDIANS 87 
They were now buying their wheat in the form of white flour and 
their vegetables largely put up in cans. In both reservations they were 
using commercial vegetable fats, jams and marmalades, sweetened goods, 
syrups and confections very liberally. It is remarkable how early the 
child life adopts modern civilization’s confections. 
In order to provide a further cross section of the modernized Indians 
of North America, I made a study in a reservation on Winnipeg Lake 
in Manitoba. This reservation lies north and east of Winnipeg and is 
quite highly modernized. 
These people were reached with much difficulty because of the natu￾ral protection provided by the location of their reservation at the 
mouth of Brokenhead River. They had been provided with fertile lands 
and taught modern methods of farming. Their proximity to a great 
body of water fairly well-stocked with fish gave them an opportunity 
to secure fish, if they were disposed to make the effort to do so, as their 
ancestors had done through previous centuries. Their homes were found 
to be in a dilapidated condition, and while their lands were stocked 
with cattle and horses, such as we found were in poor condition, and 
limited in number. The people had been provided with a government 
school and a government agent to assist in providing for their needs 
and in giving material assistance when needed. They were within 
fairly easy distance of hospitals, and had available modern medical 
service. Notwithstanding all these advantages, their physical condition 
was very poor. Dental caries was so wide-spread that 39.1 per cent of 
all teeth studied were found to be affected. They were living almost 
entirely on modern foods, imported white flours, jams, canned vege￾tables and liberal quantities of sugar. Over 90 per cent of the individuals 
had rampant dental caries. Their physical condition and their supply 
of necessities was very much lower than was that of either of the two 
preceding groups. Distress was evident even in late summer. 
The Indians so far reported were living inland with access to inland 
foods only. The Pacific Coast Indians were examined to determine the 
effect of sea foods. To find evidence relating to the physical, and par￾ticularly to the dental condition of the Indians who inhabited the 
Pacific slope a thousand or more years ago, a visit was made to the 
Vancouver Museum at Vancouver which fortunately possesses splen￾didly preserved specimens of prehistoric periods. Some of these skulls 
were uncovered while cutting through a hill for a street extension in 
the city of Vancouver. Above was a virgin forest of large size green 
firs and underneath them in the soil there were preserved fallen trunks 
of other large trees. Several feet blow thse, burials were uncovered 88 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
containing skeletons of an early Indian race. This collection contains 
also skulls from several places and from prehistoric periods. The teeth 
are all splendidly formed and free from dental caries. The arches are 
very symmetrical and the teeth in normal and regular position. 
It was important to study the conditions of their successors living in 
the same general community. Accordingly, we examined the teeth and 
general physical condition of the Indians in a reservation in North 
Vancouver, so situated that they have the modern conveniences and 
modern foods. In this group of children between eight and fifteen 
years of age, 36.9 per cent of all the teeth examined had already been 
attacked by dental caries. No people were found in this group who were 
living largely on native foods. 
Vancouver Island with its salubrious climate is one of the most fa￾vored places of residence on the Pacific Coast. It was of particular in￾terest to study the Indians near Victoria on this island in the Craig￾flower Indian Reservation. Indeed, the city of Victoria has been partly 
built on the original Craigflower Indian Reservation. As the need be￾came acute for the territory reserved for them, an arrangement was 
consummated whereby the Indians were induced to exchange that land 
for new land in an adjoining district in which a new house was built 
free for each family. Besides a house, an allotment of land and a sum 
of money, reported to be ten thousand dollars, was given to each fam￾ily. This allowed them to become very modern, and, accordingly, many 
of them owned automobiles and other modern luxuries. The physical 
effects of the use of food luxuries, resulting from ample funds for pur￾chasing any foods that they might desire, was marked. They were in 
close proximity to skilled dental service and had practical training in 
oral prophylaxis. Notwithstanding this, 48.5 per cent of all teeth ex￾amined had already been attacked by dental caries. Every individual 
examined was suffering from tooth decay. The original diet of the In￾dians of the Pacific Coast was, as we shall see, very largely sea foods, 
which are probably as abundant today as ever before. It would require 
a real urge to go to catch the fish since they can now be purchased 
canned in the open market. Like most modern people, they were living 
on white-flour products, sweet foods and pastries. 
Probably few cities of the Pacific Coast have had a greater abundance 
and variety of edible sea foods, particularly the various kinds of salmon, 
than Ketchikan. It is beautifully located on an island, and is the most 
southerly city in Alaska. Among the many fish that are abundant along 
this part of the Pacific Coast is the oolachan or candle fish. It is a small 
fish, but very rich in oil; so much so that it gets its name from being PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED INDIANS 89 
burned as a candle for light. This oil is collected in large quantities and 
used as a dressing for many of their sea foods. It is also traded with 
the Indians of the interior for furs and other products. An Indian settle￾ment in this city was studied and it was found that 46.6 per cent of 
all teeth examined had already been attacked by tooth decay. In many 
of the homes individuals were ill with tuberculosis or arthritis. Tuber￾culosis had robbed many of the homes of one or more of its children. 
At Juneau, the capital of Alaska, two groups were studied; one in the 
government hospital, and the other in an Indian settlement. In the hos￾pital were both Indians and Eskimos, chiefly the former. Seventy-five 
per cent of the patients were reported to have been brought because 
they had tuberculosis, and some who had come because of accident and 
other conditions were reported to have tuberculosis also. Approximately 
50 per cent of the total hospital enrollment was under 21 years of age. 
The dental conditions were bad, for 39.1 per cent of all the teeth 
examined had been attacked by tooth decay. 
In the Indian settlement, a group of elderly primitives was found, 
every one of whom had complete dentitions in normal arrangement of 
the arches and without dental caries. In a settlement of modern Indians 
living principally on modern foods 40 per cent of all teeth had been 
attacked by tooth decay. 
At Sitka, the former capital, two important groups were studied. 
Located here is the Sheldon Jackson School for Eskimos and Indian boys 
and girls, chiefly Indians. They have come from widely scatterd ter￾ritory throughout Alaska, and represent the finest physical specimens 
that can readily be secured for giving the advantages of an education. 
Of necessity they came very largely from the modernized districts. In 
this group 53.7 per cent of all the teeth examined had already been 
attacked by tooth decay. This gives an indication of the dental condi￾tions in the large number of modernized districts which they represented. 
In a settlement at Sitka, a group of Indians of various ages were 
studied, and it was found that 35.6 per cent of all their teeth had 
already been attacked by dental caries. A well preserved native Indian, 
seventy years of age, was found who had come into town from another 
district. He stated that his diet had consisted chiefly of fish, fish eggs, sea￾weed and deer. His teeth were of very high excellence and were entirely 
free from past or present dental caries. He is a splendid example of the 
product of the native dietary provided for the Pacific Coast people of 
any period or stage of civilization. 
The local physician at Sitka kindly gave very valuable information 
relative to the attitude of the native Indians in the matter of obtaining 90 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
fresh sea foods when foods that were very satisfying could be so easily 
obtained in concentrated form at the various stores. They could go to 
one of the piers at almost any time of the year and catch fish or secure 
them as they had been accustomed to do before the arrival of modern 
foods, but there is a constant striving to be like and live like the white 
people. They seem to think it is a mark of distinction to purchase their 
foods and that it is degrading to have to forage for one’s foods. They 
very readily come to depend on white flour and sugar, jams and canned 
vegetables; and much prefer to have the government or charitable or￾ganization supply these when they cannot purchase them, rather than 
go out and secure their own nutrition. This physician stated that there 
were about 800 whites living in the town and about 400 Indians, and 
that notwithstanding this difference in numbers there were twice as 
many Indian children born as white children, but that by the time 
these children reached six years of age there were more white children 
living than Indian and half-breed children. This he stated was largely 
due to the very high child mortality rate, of which the most frequent 
cause is tuberculosis. While it does not take many decades to record a 
distinct physical deterioration, a deteriorating parenthood greatly speeds 
up this process. While physical defects acquired by the parent will not 
be transmitted as such, prenatal deficiencies may be established because 
of the physical defects of the mother resulting from her faulty nutri￾tion, and these deficiencies, together with disturbed nutrition of infancy 
and early childhood will go far in determining whether there will be for 
the child a physical breakdown or whether the normal defense of the 
body will be adequate to protect it from various infections to which it 
may later be exposed. 
Sitka has furnished the longest history of contact with white men of 
almost any community on the Pacific Coast. Indeed, it was a famous 
seaport long before any United States Pacific Coast communities had 
been established. It is of much interest that it was a shipbuilding center 
for vessels in the Russian trade. Its foundries were developed so effi￾ciently that the bells of the early monasteries of California were cast 
in this town by the Russians. It contains some of the best examples of 
the early Russian architecture, particularly in its cathedral. 
Anchorage is the principal city of western Alaska, since it is not only a base for the railroad running north to Fairbanks, but a base for aeroplane companies operating throughout various parts of Alaska. It is accordingly a combination of a coast city with its retail activities and a wholesale base for outfitters for the interior. It has an excellent government hospital which probably has been built around the life of PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED INDIANS 91 
one man whom many people told us was the most beloved man in all Alaska. He is Dr. Josef Romig, a surgeon of great skill and with an experience among the Eskimos and Indians, both the primitives and modernized, extending over thirty-six years. I am deeply indebted to him for much information and for assistance in making contacts. He took me, for example, to several typically modernized Indian homes in 
the city. In one, the grandmother, who had come from the northern 
shore of Cook Inlet to visit her daughter, was sixty-three years of age, 
and was entirely free from tooth decay and had lost only one of her 
teeth. Her son, who had accompanied her, was twenty-four years of 
age. He had only one tooth that had ever been attacked by tooth decay. 
Their diet had been principally moose and deer meat, fresh and dried 
fish, a few vegetables and at time some cranberries. Recently the son 
had been obtaining some modern foods. Her daughter, twenty-nine 
years of age, had married a white man and had had eight children. She 
and they were living on modern foods entirely. Twenty-one of her 
thirty-two teeth had been wrecked by dental caries. Their diet con￾sisted largely of white bread, syrup and potatoes. Her children whom 
we examined ranged from five to twelve years of age, and in that fam￾ily 37 per cent of all the teeth have already been attacked by dental 
caries, notwithstanding the young age of the children. The mother of 
this family is shown in Fig. 18 (upper, left). It is of great importance 
that not only was dental caries rampant, but that there were marked 
deformity of the dental arches and irregularity of teeth in the cases of 
the children. 
Among the many items of information of great interest furnished by 
Dr. Romig were facts that fitted well into the modern picture of asso￾ciation of modern degenerative processes with modernization. He stated 
that in his thirty-six years of contact with these people he had never 
seen a case of malignant disease among the truly primitive Eskimos and 
Indians, although it frequently occurs when they become modernized. 
He found similarly that the acute surgical problems requiring operation 
on internal organs such as the gall bladder, kidney, stomach, and ap￾pendix do not tend to occur among the primitive, but are very common 
problems among the modernized Eskimos and Indians. Growing out of 
his experience, in which he had seen large numbers of the modernized 
Eskimos and Indians attacked with tuberculosis, which tended to be 
progressive and ultimately fatal as long as the patients stayed under 
modernized living conditions, he now sends them back when possible 
to primitive conditions and to a primitive diet, under which the death 
rate is very much lower than under modernized conditions. Indeed, he 92 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
reported that a great majority of the afflicted recover under the primi￾tive type of living and nutrition. 
The institutions that have been organized for the care of orphans 
and for the education of Eskimo and Indian boys and girls provide an 
opportunity to study conditions. A particularly favorable institution 
is located at Eklutna on the railroad north of Anchorage. Many of the 
individuals in the school had come from districts so remote from trans￾portation facilities that their isolation had compelled them to live 
mostly on native foods, at least during their early childhood. They had 
come from districts very widely distributed throughout the Alaskan 
peninsula. Credit is due to the management of this institution for pre￾paring and storing dried salmon for use throughout the winter. The 
beneficial effects of their good nutritional program were evident. The 
percentage of teeth attacked by dental caries was 14.6. A large per￾centage of these pupils were of mixed blood of native Eskimos or In￾dians with whites. The white parent had probably been largely respon￾sible for their attendance at this training school. There were several 
full-blooded Eskimos and Indians from modernized communities where 
they had been living on modern foods throughout their entire lifetime. 
This gave an opportunity to study the rédle of nutritional deficiencies 
in the development of deformities and irregularities in the facial fea￾tures, in the arrangement of the teeth, and in the inter-relationship 
between the dental arches. The typical irregularities and divergencies 
from normal were present in the full-blooded Eskimo and Indian boys 
and girls in as high percentage as in the mixed bloods. Some of the 
young people with parentage of mixed blood have beautiful features. 
Another important institutional group was studied at Seward in the 
Jesse Lee Home which had first been established at Nome and had been 
moved to Seward to avoid the extreme isolation of that district. This 
institution is located at Resurrection Bay which is one of the most beau￾tiful harbors in the world. It gives shelter and educational opportunities 
to Eskimos and Indians, chiefly of mixed blood, from a large area of 
Alaska, and particularly from the Aleutian Peninsula, the Aleutian 
Islands and the Bering Sea. These individuals, whether of mixed or 
pure blood, had come chiefly from homes that were in large part mod￾ernized. The incidence of dental caries found here was 27.5 per cent 
for all teeth examined. Here again all individuals were affected. Not- withstanding the unusually fine hygienic conditions and highly trained 
dietitians of this institution, a medical ward and trained nurses, tuber- culosis was reaping a heavy toll. I was told that 60 per cent of all those students who had moved with the school from Nome to this location PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED INDIANS 93 
were already dead from tuberculosis. It is common knowledge that tuberculosis has played a very important réle in decimating the Indian and Eskimo population in the Pacific Coast towns and villages. A very important phase of these investigations is the development of new light on the role of nutrition in lowering the defense of these individuals so that with their low inheritance of defensive factors they rapidly become 
susceptible to tuberculosis. 
The problem of evaluating the influence of a particular environment 
on racial and tribal development is relatively simple when studying con￾temporary remnants of primitive racial stocks. However, groups that 
have lived and disappeared in the past do not permit of so simple a 
procedure for making physical estimates. Fortunately, we have in the 
burial grounds not only the skeletons, but also many of the implements 
used in daily life. Sometimes these contain samples of the foods. We 
may find also their art ware and hunting equipment. While the period 
may not be definitely recorded, the knowledge of the history of the 
pottery of the tribe often gives an important clue to the dates as will 
also the method of burial. Burials made before the advent of the Chris￾tian era will in many groups show the bodies in a flexed position with 
the arms in the lap, whereas in the Christian burials the bodies have 
been laid prone and the arms crossed on the chest. By this sign the 
pre-Columbian burials can readily be separated from the _post￾Columbian. 
Using these guides, a study of the Indians of Florida, past and pres￾ent, permits of comparing the pre-Columbians with those living today 
in that same territory. We will, accordingly, consider the dental caries 
problem and that of facial and dental arch form in the Florida Indians 
by comparing three groups: namely, the pre-Columbian, as evidenced 
from a study of the skull material in the museums; the tribes of Indians 
living in as muchvisolation as is possible in the Everglades and Cypress 
Swamps; and the Indians of the same stock that are living in contact 
with the foods of modern civilization. This latter group lives along the 
Tamiami trail and near Miami. In a study of several hundred skulls 
taken from the burial mounds of southern Florida, the incidence of 
tooth decay was so low as to constitute an immunity of apparently one 
hundred per cent, since in several hundred skulls not a single tooth 
was found to have been attacked by tooth decay. Dental arch deformity 
and the typical change in facial form due to an inadequate nutrition 
were also completely absent, all dental arches having a form and inter￾dental relationship such as to bring them into the classification of 94 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

growing out of their belief that they had been grossly taken advantage 
of in some of their early efforts to make a treaty with the whites. With 
the assistance of three guides, one, an Indian of their own group, an￾other, a white man whom they trusted, and the third, a government 
nurse who had been very helpful in case of sickness, we were able to 
take the desired measurements and records and photographs. A group 
of these more primitive representatives is shown in Fig. 24. While their 
hunting territory had been grossly encroached upon by the white 
hunters, they were still able to maintain a very high degree of physica] 
excellence and high immunity to dental caries. Only four teeth in each 
hundred examined were found to have been attacked by tooth decay. 
Practically all of the dental arches were normal in contour with free- 100 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
dom from facial distortion. In contrast with this, the Indians of Florida 
who are living today in contact with modern civilization present a 
pathetic picture. Forty out of every hundred teeth examined were found 
to have been attacked by tooth decay, typically illustrated in Fig. 25. 
In the latest generation, many dental arches showed a typical deforma￾tion with crowding of the teeth and narrowing of the face, conditions 
that have been found in all human stocks when on an inadequate nutri￾tion during the formative and early growth period. A group of these 
is typically illustrated in Fig. 26. 
It is of interest that the quality of the skeletal material that is taken 
from the mounds showed unusually fine physical development and 
freedom from joint involvements. In contrast with this, many of the 
individuals of the modernized group were suffering from advanced 
deformities of the skeleton due to arthritic processes. 
The effects of the excellent nutrition of the pre-Columbian Indians is 
indicated in the comparative thickness of the skulls. In Fig. 27 are shown 
two pieces of a pre-Columbian skull in contrast with a modern skull. The 
specimen of a trephined lower jaw, shown in Fig. 27 (right) indicates a 
knowledge of surgery that is very remarkable. The margins show new 
bone growth. The operation opened a cyst. 
For the study of a group of Indians now living in a high western 
state, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was visited. 
Several other Indian studies have been made including studies of liv￾ing groups, recently opened burials and museum collections, all of 
which support the findings recorded here. I am indebted to the directors 
and to the staffs of these institutions for their assistance. 
Notwithstanding the wide range of physical and climatic conditions 
under which primitive Indians had been living, their incidence of tooth 
decay while on their native foods was always near zero; whereas, the 
modernized Indians of these groups showed very high incidence of dental 
caries. A summary of percentages follows: Primitive Indians: Pelly 
Mountain, 0.16 per cent; Juneau, 0.00 per cent; Florida re-Columbian, 
0.00 per cent; Florida Seminoles, 4.0 per cent. Modernized Indians: 
Telegraph Creek, 25.5 per cent; Alaska Frontier, 40.0 per cent; Mohawk 
Institute, 17 per cent; Brantford Reservation Public School, 28.5 per 
cent; Brantford Reservation Hospital, 23.2 per cent, Tuscarora Reserva￾tion 38.0 per cent; Winnipeg Lake Reservation, 39.1 per cent; North 
Vancouver Reservation, 36.9 per cent; Craigflower Indian Reservation, 
48.5 per cent; Ketchikan, 46.6 per cent; Juneau Hospital, 39.1 per cent; 
Sheldon Jackson School, 53.7 per cent; Sitk;a, 35.6 per cent; Eklutna, PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED INDIANS 101 
14.6 per cent; Jessie Lee Home, Seward, 27.6 per cent, and Florida Semi￾noles, 40.0 per cent. 
The foods used by the primitives varies according to location and 
climate. The foods of the modernized groups in all cases were the typical 
white man’s foods of commerce. 
While the primitive groups constantly presented well-formed faces 
and dental arches reproducing the tribal pattern, the new generation, 
after the adoption of white man’s foods, showed marked changes in 
facial and dental arch form. 
The Indians like several primitive races I have studied are aware of the 
fact that their degeneration is in some way brought about by their 
contact with the white man. The dislike of the American Indian for the 
modern white civilization has been emphasized by many writers. In my 
studies among the Seminole Indians of Florida I found great difficulty in 
communicating with or making examination of the isolated Seminoles 
living deep in the Everglades and Cypress Swamp. Fortunately, I had 
the able assistance of one of their own tribe, a government nurse who had 
been very helpful to them and also a white man who had befriended 
them and whom they trusted. With their assistance I was able to carry 
out very detailed studies. It was of interest, however, that when we ar￾rived at a settlement in the bush we practically always found it unin￾habited. Our Indian guide would go into the surrounding scrub and call 
to the people assuring them it was to their advantage to come out, which 
they finally did. I was told that this attitude had grown out of the belief 
on their part that their treaties had been violated. These isolated Seminole 
Indian women had the reputation of turning their backs on all white 
men. 
A United States Press report’ provides an article with the heading 
“Tribes ‘Fed Up’ Seek Solitude, Indians Dislike Civilization, Ask Land 
Barred to White Men.” The article continues: 
The Bureau of Indian Affairs revealed today that five Indian tribes in Okla￾homa are ‘fed up” with white civilization and want new, secluded tribal lands. 
So widespread is the discontent among the 100,000 Indians living in Okla￾homa, officials said, that serious study is being given to the possibility of pro￾viding new lands where the redman may hunt and fish as his ancestors did. 
Dissatisfaction has been brewing for a long time as a result of an increasing 
Indian population, decreasing Indian lands and unsatisfactory economic condi￾tions. It was brought officially to the notice of bureau officials several days ago 
when a delegation, headed by Jack Gouge, a Creek Indian from Hanna, Okla., 
told Indian Commissioner John Collier that most of the Oklahoma Indians 
wanted new tribal lands away from white civilization. 1022 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
So anxious are his people to escape from the white man and his influences, Jack 
Gouge said, that an organization of about 1000 Indians has been formed to press 
the demands. It is known as the ‘Four Mothers,” apparently representing four of 
the ‘civilized tribes’ —the Creeks, Choctaws, Cherokees and Chickasaws. 
The fifth civilized tribe, the Seminoles of Oklahoma, are negotiating with 
the Mexican government for tribal lands in that country. 
These tribes are described as ‘‘civilized” because of the high degree of culture 
they attained in their original tribal lands along the eastern coast. As their 
eastern lands became valuable the Indians were moved to the area which is now 
Oklahoma. At the turn of the century, however, with the discovery of oil there 
the new tribal lands were broken up. The Indians were forcibly removed to 
small tracts despite their desire to remain together. Indian Bureau officials do not 
conceal their bitterness over the white man’s “‘treachery.”’ One official pointed 
out that about 300 treaties have been signed with the Indians and that practi￾cally every one has been violated. 
It will be most fortunate if in the interest of science and human better￾ment such a program as this will be carried out in order to permit these 
Indians to live in accordance with the accumulated wisdom of their vari￾ous tribes. Their preservation in isolation would preserve their culture. 
The greatest heritage of the white man today is the accumulated wisdom 
of the human race.

ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED MELANESIANS 
So our quest was to gather data that will throw light upon the 
cause of modern physical degeneration among human racial stocks in 
various parts of the world, it became necessary to include for study 
various groups living in the hot sultry climates of the tropics. Again it 
was desirable to obtain contact with both highly isolated and, therefore, 
relatively primitive stocks for comparison with modernized groups of 
the same stock. In order to accomplish this an expedition was made in 
1934 to eight archipelagos of the Southern Pacific to study groups of 
Melanesians and Polynesians. The Melanesians described here were living 
in New Caledonia and the Fiji Islands. 
If the causative factors for the physical degeneration of mankind are 
practically the same everywhere, it should be possible to find a common 
cause operating, regardless of climate, race, or environment. 
Owing to the vast extent of the Pacific waters and the limited number 
of transportation lines, it became very difficult to arrange a convenient 
itinerary. This, however, was finally accomplished satisfactorily by 
going southward through the more easterly archipelagos; namely, the 
Marquesas Islands, Society Islands and Cook Islands, then westward to 
the Tongan Islands in the southern central Pacific near New Zealand, 
and then westward to New Caledonia near Australia. From this group 
we went northward to the Fiji Islands, also in the western Pacific, then | 
to the Samoan Islands in the central Pacific south of the equator, and 
then to the Hawaiian Islands north of the equator. These island groups 
were all populated by different racial stocks speaking different languages. 
The movements from archipelago to archipelago were made on the larger 
ships, and between the islands of the group in small crafts, except in the 
Hawaiian Islands where an aeroplane was used. 
The program in each group consisted in making contact with local 
guides and interpreters. They had generally been arranged for in advance 
by correspondence with government officials. By these means we were 
able to reach isolated groups in locations quite distant from contact with 
trade or merchant ships. To reach these isolated groups often required 
103 104 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
going over rough and difficult trails since most of the islands being of 
volcanic formation are mountainous. 
On reaching the isolated groups our greetings and the purpose of the 
mission were conveyed by our interpreters to the chiefs. Much time was 
often lost in going through necessary ceremonials and feasting. In every 
instance we received a very cordial reception and excellent cooperation. 
In no instance was there antagonism. Through the underground tele￾graph they always seemed to know we were coming and had prepared 
for us. When these formalities were once over and our wishes made 
known, the chiefs instructed the members of their tribes to carry out 
our program for making examinations, recording personal data, making 
photographs, and collecting samples of foods for chemical analysis. The 
food samples were either dried or preserved in formalin. 
The detailed records for every individual included data on the tribe, 
village and family, his age, previous residence, physical development, the 
kinds of foods eaten, the physical condition of every tooth, including 
presence or absence of cavities; the shape of the dental arches; the shape 
and development of the face; and detailed notes on divergencies from 
racial type. Special physical characteristics were photographed. A com￾parison was made of these factors for each of the more isolated members 
of the same tribe and those in the vicinity of the port or landing place of 
the island. Through the government officials detailed information was 
secured, usually in the form of the annual government statistical reports, 
showing the kind and quantity of the various ingredients and articles 
that were imported, and similarly those that were exported. Contact was 
made in each island group with the health officers, and the studies were 
usually made with their assistance. In many instances the only contact 
with civilization had consisted of the call of a small trading ship once 
or twice a year to gather up the copra or dried coconut, sea shells and 
such other products as the natives had accumulated for exchange. Pay￾ment for these products was usually made in trade goods and not in 
money. The following articles consisted nearly always of 90 per cent of 
the total value: white flour and sugar. Ten per cent consisted of wearing 
apparel or material for that apparel. 
While the missionaries have encouraged the people to adopt habits of 
modern civilization, in the isolated districts the tribes were not able to 
depart much from their native foods because of the infrequency of the 
call of the trader ship. Effort had been made in almost all of the islands 
to induce the natives to cover their bodies, especially when in sight of 
strangers. In several islands regulatory measures had been adopted re- quiring the covering of the body. This regulation had greatly reduced ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED MELANESIANS 1065

the primitive practice of coating the surface of the body with coconut oil, which had the effect of absorbing the ultra-violet rays thus prevent- ing injury from the tropical sun. This coating of oil enabled them to shed the rain which was frequently torrential though of short duration. The irradiation of the coconut oil was considered by the natives to pro￾vide, in addition, an important source of nutrition. Their newly acquired wet garments became a serious menace to the comfort and health of the wearers. 
The early navigators who visited these South Sea Islands reported the 
people as being exceedingly strong, vigorously built, beautiful in body 
and kindly disposed. There were formerly dense populations on most of 
the inhabitable islands. In contrast with this, one now finds that on many 
of the islands the death rate has come to so far exceed the birth rate that 
the very existence of these racial groups is often seriously threatened. 
The Island of New Caledonia is one of the largest of the Pacific. It is 
situated in the vicinity of 23 degrees south latitude and 165 degrees east 
longitude. The New Caledonians are pure Melanesian stock. They are 
broad shouldererd, very muscular and in the past have been very war￾like. These Islands are under French control. The foreign population 
is chiefly French, and limited mainly to the vicinity of the one port of 
Noumea. The subjugation of these people has been very difficult and as 
recently as 1917 a band from the interior in protest against efforts to 
establish a white colony and sugar plantation on a desirable section of 
coastal land swept down on the French colony in the night and massacred 
almost the entire population. Their contact with the required foods from 
the sea had been cut off. They believe they require sea foods to maintain 
life and physical efficiency. The physical development of the primitive 
people including their teeth and dental arches is of very high order. A 
comparison of the individuals living near the ports with those living in 
the isolated inland locations shows marked increase in the incidence of 
dental caries. For those living almost exclusively on the native foods the 
incidence of dental caries was only 0.14 per cent; while for those using 
trade foods the incidence of dental caries was 26 per cent. The splendid 
facial and dental arch development of these quite primitive Caledonians 
is shown in Fig. 28. Note also their kinky hair and strong neck and face 
muscles. 
The Fiji Island group lies between 15 and 22 degrees south latitude and 
between 177 degrees west and 175 degrees east longitude, thus straddling 
the international date line. The Fiji Islanders are similar in physical de￾velopment and appearance to the New Caledonians, and like them are

hair and broad shoulders. In the past, they have been excellent warriors. They are not as tall as their hereditary enemies, the Tongans, to the east, b and in order to make themselves look equally tall, they have adopted the practice of training their kinky hair straight out from the head to a height often reaching six or more inches. Typical facial and dental arch forms are shown in Fig. 29. They are British subjects, and where they 
have had supervision, in the districts near the ports and on those islands 
on which sugar plantations have been established, they have suffered very 
greatly from the degenerative diseases. 
Since Viti Levu, one of the islands of this group, is one of the larger 
islands of the Pacific Ocean, I had hoped to find on it a district far 
enough from the sea to make it necessary for the natives to have lived 
entirely on land foods. Accordingly, with the assistance of the govern￾ment ofhcials and by using a recently opened government road I was 
able to get well into the interior of the island by motor vehicle, and from 
this point to proceed farther inland on foot with two guides. I was not 
able, however, to get beyond the piles of sea shells which had been carried 
into the interior. My guide told me that it had always been essential, as it 
is today, for the people of the interior to obtain some food from the sea, 
and that even during the times of most bitter warfare between the inland 
or hill tribes and the coast tribes, those of the interior would bring down 
during the night choice plant foods from the mountain areas and place 
them in caches and return the following night and obtain the sea foods 
that had been placed in those depositories by the shore tribes. The indi￾viduals who carried these foods were never molested, not even during 
active warfare. He told me further that they require food from the sea 
at least every three months, even to this day. This was a matter of keen 
interest, and at the same time disappointment since one of the purposes 
of the expedition to the South Seas was to find, if possible, plants or friuts 
which together, without the use of animal products, were capable of 
providing all of the requirements of the body for growth and for main￾tenance of good health and a high state of physical efficiency. Among the 
sources of animal foods was the wild pig from the bush. These were not 
native, but imported into nearly all of the islands, and they have become 
wild where there is an abundance of food for them. Another animal food 
was that from coconut crabs which grow to a weight of several pounds. 
At certain seasons of the year the crabs migrate to the sea in great num￾bers from the mountains and interior country. They spend about three 
days in the sea for part of their reproductive program and return later 
to their mountain habitats. Their routes of travel are as nearly as possible 
in straight lines. At the season of migration, large numbers of the crabs

are captured for food. These crabs rob the coconut trees of fruit. They 
climb the trees during the darkness and return to the ground before the 
dawn. They cut off the coconuts and allow them to drop to the ground. 
When the natives hear coconuts dropping in the night they put a girdle 
of grass around the tree fifteen or twenty feet from the ground, and 
when the crabs back down and touch the grass they think that they are 
down on the ground, let go their hold and are stunned by the fall. The 
natives then collect the crabs and put them in a pen where they are fed 
on shredded coconut. In two weeks’ time the crabs are so fat that they 
burst their shells. They are then very delicious eating. Fresh water fish of 
various kinds are used where available from the mountain streams. Land 
animal foods, however, are not abundant in the mountainous interior, 
and no places were found where the native plant foods were not supple￾mented by sea foods. 
Our first visit to the Fiji Islands was in 1934, and the second in 1936. 
On our first trip we had much personal assistance from Ratu Popi, heredi￾tary king. His residence was on the royal island reserved exclusively for 
the king and his retinue. His picture is shown in Fig. 30 with that of 
Mrs. Price. He was very solicitous for the welfare of his people whom he 
recognized to be rapidly breaking down with modernization. The council 
house is also shown in Fig. 30. He gave us very important information 
regarding the origin of cannibalism, relating it to a recognition of special 
food values of special organs, particularly the livers. 
There has been a very extensive development of sugar plantations on 
the larger islands of several of the Pacific archipelagos. The working of 
these plantations has required the importation of large numbers of in￾dentured laborers. These have been brought chiefly from India and 
China. Since they are nearly all men, those who have married have ob￾tained their wives from among the natives. This, the Chinese have done 
quite frequently. Since they are excellent workers they provide good 
homes and are good business men. They are, in many districts, rapidly 
becoming the landowners and are men of influence. This influx of Asi￾atics, together with that of Europeans, has had an important influence 
upon the purity of the native race around the ports and provided an op￾portunity to study the effect of intermingling of races upon the suscepti￾bility to dental caries. No differences in extent of tooth decay due to 
ancestry were disclosed. The incidence of dental caries at the points of 
contact with imported foods was 30.1 per cent of teeth examined as com￾pared with 0.42 for the more isolated groups living on the native foods 
of land and sea.

imported foods included the loss of immunity to dental caries in practi￾cally all of the individuals who had displaced their native foods very 
largely with the modern foods. Dental caries was much worse, however, 
in the growing children and motherhood group due to the special de￾mands of these individuals. These conditions are illustrated in Figs. 31 
and 32. The boy shown in Fig. 32 (upper, left) typifies the suffering 
brought by modernization. Abscessed teeth often cause suicide. 
Another important phase of the studies included a critical examination 
of the facial form and shape of the dental arches which include very 
definite and typical changes represented by the narrowing of the features 
and the lengthening of the face with crowding of the teeth in the arch. 
These are illustrated in the lower half of Fig. 32. 
The members of the Melanesian race living on the Fiji Islands of the 
Pacific, whether volcanic or coral in origin, have developed a very high 
immunity to dental caries and well formed faces and dental arches. Their 
native foods consisted of animal life from the sea eaten with plants and 
fruits from the land in accordance with a definite program of food 
selection. In their primitive state only 0.42 per cent of their teeth were 
attacked by tooth decay. In the modernized groups this incidence in￾creased to 30.1 per cent. The change in the nutrition included a marked 
reduction in the native foods and their displacement with white-flour 
products, sugar and sweetened goods, canned foods and polished rice. In 
the succeeding generations after the parents had adopted the modern 
foods, there occurred distinct change in facial form and shape of the 
dental arches. Chapter 8 
ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED POLYNESIANS 
HE characteristics of the Polynesian race included straight hair, oval 
features, happy, buoyant dispositions and splendid physiques. When 
the Pacific Islands were discovered the Polynesians were found inhabiting 
the Hawaiian Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Tuamotu group includ￾ing Tahiti, the Cook Islands, the Tongan Islands and the Samoan group. 
The first group studied was made up of the people of the Marquesas 
Islands which are situated 9 degrees south latitude and 140 degrees west 
longitude, about 4,000 miles due west of Peru. Few, if any, of the primi￾tive racial stocks of the South Sea Islands were so enthusiastically ex￾tolled for their beauty and excellence of physical development by the 
early navigators. Much tooth decay prevails today. They reported the 
Marquesans as vivacious, happy people numbering over a hundred thou￾sand on the seven principal islands of this group. Probably in few places 
in the world can so distressing a picture be seen today as is found there. 
A French government official told me that the native population had de￾creased to about two thousand, chiefly as a result of the ravages of tuber￾culosis. Serious epidemics of small-pox and measles have at times taken a 
heavy toll. In a group of approximately one hundred adults and children 
I counted ten who were emaciated and coughing with typical signs of 
tuberculosis. Many were waiting for treatment at a dispensary eight 
hours before the hour it opened. In the past some of the natives have had 
splendid physiques, fine countenances, and some of the women have had 
beautiful features. They are now a sick and dying primitive group. A 
trader ship was in port exchanging white flour and sugar for their copra. 
They have largely ceased to depend on the sea for food. Tooth decay was 
rampant. At the time of the examination, 36.9 per cent of the teeth of 
the people using trade food in conjunction with the land plants and 
fruits had been attacked by tooth decay. The individuals living entirely 
on native foods were few. Some early navigators were so highly impressed 
with the beauty and health of these people that they reported the Mar￾quesas Islands as the Garden of Eden. 
Tahiti is the principal island of the Society group. It is situated 17 degrees south of the equator, 149 degrees west longitude. Fortunately de￾116 ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED POLYNESIANS 117 
Fic. 33. Polynesians are a beautiful race and physically sturdy. They have straight hair and

generation has not been so rapid nor so severe here. The Tahitian popula￾tion, however, has reduced from over two hundred thousand as early esti￾mated, to a present native population estimated at about ten thousand. 
These islands are also a part of French Oceania. Many of the able bodied 
men were taken from these French Islands to France to fight in the 
World War. Only a small percentage, however, returned, and they were 
mostly crippled and maimed. The Tahitians are a buoyant, light-hearted 
race, fully conscious, however, of their rapid decline in numbers and 
health. Many of the more primitive are very fine looking and have ex￾cellent dental arches, as seen in Fig. 33. 
The capital of Tahiti, Papeete, is the administrative center for the 
French Pacific possessions. It has a large foreign population, and there is 
considerable commerce in and out of this port. Much imported food is 
used. Like on the Marquesas Islands, it was difficult to find large numbers 
of individuals living entirely on the native foods. Those that were found 
had complete immunity to dental caries. For the natives living in part on 
trade foods, chiefly white flour, sugar and canned goods, 31.9 per cent 
of the teeth were found to be attacked by tooth decay. Typical extensive 
destruction of the teeth amongst the modernized Tahitians is shown in 
Fig. 34. There is a large colony of Chinese in Tahiti, brought there as 
indentured laborers. They have not returned. When the Tahitian men 
did not return from the war, their wives married the Chinese, who are 
good workers. 
The Cook Islands are British and under the direct guidance of the 
New Zealand Government. Rarotonga is the principal island. It is situ￾ated in the Pacific Ocean in the vicinity of 21 degrees south latitude and 
160 degrees west longitude. It has a delightful climate the year around. 
Racially according to legend, the Maori tribe, the native tribe of New 
Zealand, migrated there from the Cook Islands. In addition to being 
similar in physical development and appearance, their languages are 
sufficiently similar so that each can understand the other, even though 
their separation occurred probably over a thousand years ago. 
It is a matter of great importance that the inhabitants of these South 
Sea Islands were skillful navigators and boat builders. It was a common 
occurrence for expeditions both peaceful and aggressive to make journeys of one and two thousand miles in crafts propelled by man power and wind and carrying in addition an adequate supply of water and food for their journey. 
A large number were found in Rarotonga living almost entirely on native foods, and only 0.3 per cent of the teeth of these individuals have been attacked by dental caries. In the vicinity of Avarua, the principal ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED POLYNESIANS 119

port, however, the natives were living largely on trade foods, and among 
these 29.5 per cent of the teeth were found to have been attacked by 
dental caries. In Fig. 35 (top) are seen typically fine faces and teeth. 
However at the lower left is shown a child at the port whose parents were 
living on the imported food. This boy’s upper lateral teeth are erupting 
inside the arch. In the lower right is a child with normal spacing of the 
deciduous teeth. 
Under British guidance the Cook Islanders have much better health 
than the Marquesans or the Tahitians. Their population is not seriously 
decreasing, and is untroubled except for the progressive development of 
the degenerative diseases around the port. They are thrifty and happy, 
and are rapidly developing a local culture including a school system 
supported by natives. 
The inhabitants of the Tongan Islands, the principal of which is 
Tongatabu, are Polynesian. This group, containing over 100 islands, is 
situated between 18 and 22 degrees south latitude and between 173 and 
176 degrees west longitude, and has a native population of about 28,000. 
They have the distinction of being one of the last absolute monarchies 
of the world. While they are under the protection of Great Britain, they 
largely manage their own affairs. Their isolation is nearly complete 
except for a call from an infrequent trader. They seem to be credited by 
the inhabitants of the other islands as being the greatest warriors of the 
Pacific. The Tongans at least acknowledge that they are the greatest 
warriors, and indeed the greatest people of the world. They will not 
step aside to allow anyone to pass since they say that when the world 
was created and populated they were the first to be made, next was the 
pig, and last the white man. Ethnologically, they are said to be a mixture 
of the darker Melanesians with their kinky hair, and the fairer Polyne￾sians of the eastern archipelagos with straight hair. It is said they have 
never been defeated in battle. For centuries they and the Fijian tribes 
700 miles to the west have frequently been at war. The British govern￾ment has very skillfully directed this racial rivalry into athletics. While 
we were in the Fiji Islands the British government provided a battle 
cruiser to carry the football team from Fiji to Nukualofa for the annual 
contest of strength. 
These islanders have practiced eugenics by selecting tall strong mates. 
The queen of the islands was six feet three inches in height. 
The limited importation of foods to the Tongan Islands due to the in- frequent call of merchant or trading ships has required the people to remain largely on their native foods. Following the war, however, the price of copra went up from $40.00 per ton to $400.00, which brought ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED POLYNESIANS 121

trading ships with white flour and sugar to exchange for the copra. The 
effect of this is shown very clearly in the condition of the teeth. The inci￾dence of dental caries among the isolated groups living on native foods 
was 0.6 per cent, while for those around the port living in part on trade 
foods, it is 33.4 per cent. The effect of the imported food was clearly to 
be seen on the teeth of the people who were in the growth stage at that 
time. Now the trader ships no longer call and this forced isolation is very 
clearly a blessing in disguise. Dental caries has largely ceased to be active 
since imported foods became scarce, for the price of copra fell to $4.00 
a ton. The temporary rise in tooth decay was apparently directly asso￾ciated with the calling of trader ships. 
The Samoan Islands are located in the vicinity of 14 degrees south 
latitude and between 166 and 174 degrees west longitude. The native 
population of the Samoan Islands is Polynesian. The control of the 
Islands is divided between two governments. The eastern group is Amer￾ican. The western group is British since the World War, before which it 
was under German control. The western group is now under a mandate 
to New Zealand. Through the kindness of the Governor and Naval Off￾cers of American Samoa transportation was provided on an auxiliary 
craft to the various islands of the American Samoan group. We were 
particularly indebted to Commander Stephenson, Director of Health, 
whose guests we were, for continued personal assistance in making favor￾able contacts in nearly all villages of the American Samoan group. In no 
islands of the Pacific did we find so excellent an organization for health 
service. Dispensaries have been established within reach of nearly all the 
villages besides hospital service at Pago Pago, the port of Tutuila. This is 
the finest port in the Pacific Ocean. Notwithstanding the regular 
monthly contact through merchant ships to and from America and Aus￾tralia, many isolated groups were found living largely on the native 
foods. A dental survey had recently been made of this group by Lieu￾tenant Commander Ferguson. 
The excellent facial and dental arch development of the Samoans 
is illustrated in the upper half of Fig. 36. The change in facial and 
dental arch form which follows the use of modern food by the parents is shown in the lower half of Fig. 36. Note the marked irregularity of the teeth. This is one of the few groups of islands in which the popula- tion is not rapidly decreasing, indeed there is some increase. The Navy personnel includes one dentist.

Samoa are on the largest island, Tutuila, and due to the development 
of roads, a considerable number of the people have access to the main 
port, to which several of them come on ship days to sell their wares and 
to buy provisions to augment their native foods. The incidence of 
dental caries among those individuals living in part on imported foods at 
the port as compared with those in remote districts living on native 
foods was as follows: Those almost exclusively on native foods had 0.3 
per cent of the teeth attacked by dental caries, and for those on trade 
foods, 18.7 per cent. Sea foods used here include many shell fish which 
are gathered and sold largely by the young people. The octopus, the 
sea crab and the beche-de-mere eaten raw were used. 
The Hawaiian Islands lie between 18 and 22 degrees north latitude 
and between 154 and 160 degrees west longitude. These Islands are 
quite unlike any of the other Pacific Island groups previously discussed. 
Sugar and pineapple plantations cover vast areas and together constitute 
by far the most important industries of these Islands. In many dis￾tricts the population is almost entirely foreign or of various blends, 
chiefly of Filipinos and Japanese with Hawaiians. There is a large Amer￾ican population and a considerable European. These different racial 
groups have largely brought their own customs which are rapidly sub￾merging the native customs. Since the native population is so greatly 
reduced in comparison with the foreign population, and because inter￾marrying has been so general, it was difficult to find large groups of 
relatively pure-blooded Hawaiians either living almost entirely on native 
foods or on modernized foods. Though the number of the individuals 
in these groups is accordingly not large, important data were obtained 
for comparing the relative incidence of dental caries and other degen￾erative processes. While the preparation of foods on the various Pacific 
Islands has many common factors, all natives using the underground oven 
of hot stones for cooking, the Hawaiian Islands present one unique 
difference in the method of preparation of their taro. They cook the 
root as do all the other tribes, but having done so they dry the taro, 
powder it and mix it with water and allow it to ferment for several 
hours, usually twenty-four or more. This preparation called “poi” be￾comes slightly tart by the process of fermentation and has the con￾sistency of heavy strap molasses or a very heavy cream. It is eaten 
by rolling it up on one or two fingers and sucking it from them. It 
accordingly offers no resistance to the process of mastication. In the districts where the natives are living on native foods the incidence of dental caries was only 2 per cent of the teeth, whereas among those natives who are living in large part on the imported foods, chiefly white ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED POLYNESIANS 1235

Fic, 38. The Polynesian race is rapidly disappearing with modernization. Tooth decay 
becomes extreme as shown in the girl above. This girl has tuberculosis, one of the physical 
injuries which accompany modernization. This is one of the bodily injuries as we will 
see later. 
The study of the incidence of dental caries in these various South Sea 
Island groups in its relation to diet was only one of several of the prob￾lems investigated. Since nutrition is the principal factor that has been 
found related to the rdle of immunity and susceptibility to dental caries 
in my previous field studies, the collection of foods for chemical analysis 
and the gathering of detailed data regarding the articles of diet have 
been very important phases of the activities of this group of studies. 
Data were collected for relating the incidence of irregularities of the 
teeth and dental arches to the types of nutrition. Similarly, studies were 
made of the individuals who had been hospitalized, in the few places ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED POLYNESIANS 127 
where hospitals existed, chiefly to obtain data regarding the classifica￾tion of the individuals who were suffering from tuberculosis. These 
were similar to the studies that I have made among the Eskimos and 
Indians of Alaska and northern and central Canada. 
If one will picture a community of several thousand people with an 
average of 30 per cent of all the teeth attacked by dental caries and 
not a single dentist or dental instrument available for assistance of the 
entire group, a slight realization is had of the mass suffering that has to 
be endured. Commerce and trade for profit blaze the way in breaking 
down isolation’s barriers, far in advance of the development of health 
agencies and emergency relief unwittingly made necessary by the trade 
contact. 
While dental caries was most active in the periods of systematic over￾loads, such as growth, gestation and lactation, even the splendidly 
formed teeth of the adult men were wrecked by dental caries when 
the native foods were displaced with modern foods. In all of the groups 
living on native foods with a liberal intake of animal life of the sea, 
the health of the gums was generally excellent. When, however, the 
sea foods were quite limited in the dietary, heavy deposits formed and 
often were associated with a marked destruction of the supporting 
tissues with gingival infection. This condition was particularly preva￾lent among all groups near the ports, when the groups were displacing 
part of their native foods with imported foods. 
In American Samoa through the cooperation of the educational au￾thorities and the Director of the Department of Health, Commander 
Stephenson, and under the direct supervision of Lieutenant Commander 
Lowry, the dental surgeon, a group of four young men of the native 
teaching staff was selected and given instructions for the removal of 
the deposits. Equipment in the form of instruments has since been pro￾vided, in part through the kindness and generosity of some dental 
manufacturers. This probably constitutes the only native dental service 
that has ever been available in any of the Pacific Island groups. The 
intelligence and aptness with which these men were able to learn the 
fundamental principles, and their skill in carrying out a highly com￾mendable prophylactic operation was indeed remarkable. I gave them 
pieces of soap and asked them to carve a reproduction of an extracted 
tooth which was given as a model and in which they were required to 
increase all diameters to a given amount. Their work would probably 
equal if not exceed in excellence that of the first effort of 90 per cent 
of American dental students. Many of these natives are very dexterous 128 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
with their fingers and are skilled artists in carving wood and other 
material. 
A great service could be rendered to these people who are in the 
process of modernization, but who have no opportunity for dental assist￾ance, by teaching some of the bright young men certain of the pro￾cedures for rendering first aid. They could be compensated by con￾tributions of native foods and native wares much as our itinerant 
dentists were in earlier days. The people would not have money to pay 
an American or European dentist for his service until trade is carried on 
with currency. 
Nearly all these racial stocks are magnificent singers for which Nature 
has well-equipped them physically. Their artistry can be judged by the 
fact that they sing very difficult music unaccompanied and undirected. 
A large native chorus at Nukualofa, in the Tongan Group, sang without 
accompaniment “The Hallelujah Chorus” from Handel’s Messiah with 
all the parts and with phenominal volume and modulation. Much of 
their work, such as rowing their largest boats, and many of their sports 
are carried out to the rhythm of hilarious music. 
Many of the island groups recognize that their races are doomed 
since they are melting away with degenerative diseases, chiefly tubercu￾losis. Their one overwhelming desire is that their race shall not die out. 
They know that something serious has happened since they have been 
touched by civilization. Surely our civilization is on trial both at home 
and abroad. 
The nutrition of the primitive Polynesians is continually reinforced 
with animal life from the sea which includes both soft- and hard-shell 
forms. The incidence of tooth decay varied from 0.6 per cent for the 
most isolated groups to 33.4 per cent for the modernized groups. Those 
individuals living in their native environment on their native foods 
have universally normal facial and dental arch form reproducing the 
characteristics of the race. Those living on the normal environment 
except for using the imported foods of white flour, sugar, sugar prod￾ucts, syrup, polished rice, and the like, have in the succeeding genera￾tions marked changes in facial and dental arch forms.

ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AFRICAN TRIBES 
peat has been the last of the large continents to be invaded and 
explored by our modern civilization. It has one of the largest 
native populations still living in accordance with inherited traditions. 
Accordingly, it provides a particularly favorable field for studying 
primitive racial stocks. 
This study of primitive racial stocks, with the exception of some 
Indian groups, has been largely concerned with people living under 
physical conditions quite different from those which obtain in the cen￾tral area of a large continent. 
Sea foods are within reach of the inhabitants of islands and coastal 
regions regardless of latitude. The inhabitants of the interior of a con￾tinent, however, have not access to liberal supplies of various forms of 
animal life of the sea. It was important, therefore, in the interest of the 
inhabitants of the United States, Canada, Europe, and other large 
continental interiors, to study primitive people living under environ￾ments similar to theirs. Africa is one of the few countries that can 
provide both primitive living conditions and the modern life of the 
plains and plateau country in the interior. The great plateau of eastern 
and central Africa has nurtured a score of tribes with superb physiques 
and much accumulated wisdom. We are concerned to know how they 
have accomplished this, and whether they or any other people can sur￾vive in that environment after adopting the formulas of our modern 
civilizations. Considering that the most universal scourge of modern 
civilization is dental caries, though it is only one of its many degen￾erative processes, it is important that we study these people to note how 
they have solved the major problems of living in so severe and disciplin￾ing an environment as provided in Africa. 
This was done during the summer of 1935. Our route took us through 
the Red Sea and down the Indian Ocean to enter the African continent 
at Mombasa below the equator and then across Kenya and Uganda into 
Eastern Belgian Congo, and thence about 4,000 miles down the long 
stretch of the Nile through Sudan to the modernized civilization of 
Egypt. This journey covered most of the country around Ethiopia and 
129 130 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
gave us contact with several of the most primitive racial stocks of that 
country. These people are accordingly the neighbors of the Abyssinians 
or Ethiopians. Since the various tribes speak different languages and 
are under different governments, it was necessary to organize our safari 
in connection with the local government officials in the different 
districts. 
During these journeys in Africa which covered about 6,000 miles, we 
came in contact with about thirty different tribes. Special attention 
was given to the foods, samples of which were obtained for chemical 
analysis. Over 2,500 negatives were made and developed in the field. 
If any one impression of our experiences were to be selected as par￾ticularly vivid, it would be the contrast between the health and rug￾gedness of the primitives in general and that of the foreigners who 
have entered their country. That their superior ruggedness was not 
racial became evident when through contact with modern civilizations 
degenerative processes developed. Very few of the many Europeans 
with whom we came in contact had lived in central Africa for as much 
as two years without serious illness or distinct evidence of physical 
stress. That the cause was not the severity of the climate, but something 
related to the methods of living, was soon apparent. In all the districts 
it was recognized and expected that the foreigners must plan to spend 
a portion of every few years or every year outside that environment 
if they would keep well. Children born in that country to Europeans 
were generally expected to spend several of their growing years in 
Europe or America if they would build even relatively normal bodies. 
One exacting condition of the environment that we encountered 
was the constant exposure to disease. Dysentery epidemics were so severe 
and frequent that we scarcely allowed ourselves to eat any food that 
had not been cooked or that we had not peeled ourselves. In general, 
it was necessary to boil all drinking water. We dared not allow our 
bare feet to touch a floor of the ground for fear of jiggers which burrow 
into the skin of the feet. Scarcely ever when below 6,000 feet were we 
safe after sundown to step from behind mosquito netting or to go out 
without thorough protection against the malaria pests. These malaria 
mosquitoes which include many varieties are largely night feeders. They 
were thought to come out soon after sundown. We were advised that 
the most dangerous places for becoming infected were the public eating 
houses, since the mosquitoes hide under the tables and attack the diner’s 
ankles if they are not adequately protected. We rigidly followed the precaution of providing adequate protection against these pests. Disease- carrying ticks were so abundant in the grass and shrubbery that we had ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AFRICAN TRIBES 131 ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AFRICAN TRIBES 133 
to be on guard constantly to remove them from our clothing before 
they buried themselves in our flesh. They were often carriers of very 
severe fevers. We had to be most careful not to touch the hides with 
which the natives protected their bodies from the cold at night and 
from the sun in the daytime without thorough sterilization following 
any contact. There was grave danger from the lice that infected the 
hair of the hides. We dared not enter several districts because of the 
dreaded tsetse fly and the sleeping sickness it carries. One wonders at 
the apparent health of the natives until he learns of the unique im￾munity they have developed and which is largely transmitted to the 
offspring. In several districts we were told that practically every living 
native had had typhus fever and was immune, though the lice from 
their bodies could transmit the disease. One also wonders why people 
with such resistance to disease are not able to combat the degenerative 
diseases of modern civilization. When they adopt modern civilization 
they then become susceptible to several of our modern degenerative 
processes, including tooth decay. 
Dr. Anderson who is in charge of a splendid government hospital 
in Kenya, assured me that in several years of service among the primi￾tive people of that district he had observed that they did not suffer from 
appendicitis, gall bladder trouble, cystitis and duodenal ulcer. Malig￾nancy was also very rare among the primitives. 
It is of great significance that we studied six tribes in which there 
appeared to be not a single tooth attacked by dental caries nor a 
single malformed dental arch. Several other tribes were found with 
nearly complete immunity to dental caries. In thirteen tribes we did 
not meet a single individual with irregular teeth. Where the members 
of these same tribes had adopted modern civilization many cases of tooth 
decay were found. In the next generation following the adoption of 
the European dietaries dental arch deformities frequently developed. 
We are concerned to know something of the origin of these people 
including the Ethiopians and to what extent racial ancestry has pro￾tected them. If we refer to an ethnographic map of African races we 
find there is evidence of a great movement northward from South 
Africa. These people had some things in common with the Melanesians 
and Polynesians of the South Pacific whom we studied the year pre￾viously. Their language carries some words of similar meaning. While 
there are many tribes existing today, it is of significance that they each 
possess some identifying characteristics of language, dress and food 
habits. Another great racial movement has apparently moved south￾ward from Northern Africa. These tribes are of Hamitic origin and 134 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
include Nilotic tribes and Abyssinians. The Nilotic tribes have a dis￾tinct physical pattern and mode of life. These great racial movements 
have met in the Upper Nile region of Eastern Africa near the equator, 
and have swayed back and forth with successive obliteration or absorp￾tion of those tribes that were least sturdy. The negro race occupied an 
area across Africa from the West to Central Africa. They were exposed 
to the aggression and oppression of these two great racial movements, 
resulting often in intermingling in various proportions of racial bloods. 
The Semitic race, chiefly Arabs, occupied Arabia and a great area in 
Northern Africa. 
In this bird’s eye view we are observing changes that have been in 
progress during many hundreds or thousands of years. The Arabs have 
been the principal slave dealers working in from the east coast of 
Africa. They have maintained their individuality without much blend￾ing except on the coast. They have not become an important part of 
the native stock of the interior. These primitive native stocks can be 
largely identified on the basis of their habits and methods of living. 
The Nilotic tribes have been chiefly herders of cattle and goats and 
have lived primarily on dairy products, including milk and blood, with 
some meat, and with a varying percentage of vegetable foods. It was 
most interesting to observe that in every instance these cattle people 
dominated the surrounding tribes. They were characterized by superb 
physical development, great bravery and a mental acumen that made 
it possible for them to dominate because of their superior intelligence. 
Among these Nilotic tribes the Masai forced their way farthest south 
and occupy a position between two of the great Bantu tribes, the Kikuyu 
and the Wakamba. Both of these latter tribes are primarily agricultural 
people. 
Masai Tribe. The Masai are tall and strong. Fig. 39 shows a typical 
belle, also a Masai man who is much taller than our six-foot guide. It 
is interesting to study the methods of living and observe the accumu￾lated wisdom of the Masai. They are reported to have known for over 
two hundred years that malaria was carried by mosquitoes, and further 
they have practiced exposing the members of their tribes who had been 
infected with syphilis by the Arabs to malaria to prevent the serious 
injuries resulting from the spirochetal infection. Yet modern medicine boasts of being the discoverers of this great principle of using malaria to prevent or relieve syphilitic infections of the spinal cord and brain. I saw the native Masai operating on their cattle with skill and knowl- edge. The Masai have no currency and all their transactions are made with cows or goats.

ashes of a plant that acted as a very powerful styptic. Their knowledge 
of veterinary science is quite remarkable. I saw them treating a young 
cow that had failed to conceive. They apparently knew the cause and 
proceeded to treat her as modern veterinaries might do in order to over￾come her difficulties. For their food throughout the centuries they have 
depended very largely on milk, meat and blood, reinforced with veg￾etables and fruits. They milk the cows daily and bleed the steers at 
regular intervals by a unique process. In Fig. 40 we see a native Masai 
with his bow and arrow, the latter tipped with a sharp knife which is 
guarded by a shoulder to determine the depth to which the arrow may 
enter the vein. If the animal is sufficiently tame, the blood is drawn 136 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

the blood of the steers which is drawn about every thirty days. Above shows the lance

while it is standing. If the animal is frightened it is quickly hobbled, as shown below. In this figure the stream of blood may be seen spurting from the jugular vein into a gourd which holds about a gallon. A torque is placed around the neck before the puncture is made. The 
animals did not even flinch when struck by the arrow, the operation 
is done so quickly and skillfully. When sufficient blood was drawn, the 
torque was removed and the blood immediately stopped flowing. A 
styptic made of ashes referred to above was used. This serves also to 
protect the wound from infection. The blood is defibrinated by whip￾ping in the gourd. The fibrin is fried or cooked much as bacon or meat 
would be prepared. The defibrinated blood is used raw just as the milk 
is, except in smaller quantities. When available, each growing child 
receives a day’s ration of blood as does each pregnant or lactating 
woman. Formerly, the warriors used this food exclusively. These three 
sources, milk, blood and meat provide them with liberal supplies of 
body-building minerals and the special vitamins, both fat-soluble and 
water soluble. Their estimate of a desirable dairy stock is based on quality 
| not quantity. They judge the value of a cow for keeping in their herd 
i} by the length of time it takes her calf to stand on its feet and run after 
it is born, which is only a very few minutes. This is in striking contrast 
/ with the practice of our modern dairymen who are chiefly concerned 
_with the quantity of milk and quantity of butter fat rather than with 
‘its value as a source of special factors for nutrition. Many of the calves 
of the modern high-production cows of civilized countries are not able 
to stand for many hours after birth, frequently twenty-four. This 
ability to stand is very important in a countty infested with predatory 
animals; such as lions, leopards, hyenas, jackals and vultures. 
, This reminded me of my experience in Alaska in studying the rein- 
|deer of the Eskimos. I was told that a reindeer calf could be dropped 
jin a foot of snow and almost immediately it could run with such speed 
that the predatory animals, including wolves, could not catch it. And, 
| moreover, that these fawns would go almost immediately after their 
| birth with a herd on a stampede and never be knocked down. 
The problem of combating the predatory animals, particularly the 
lions, calls for greater skill and bravery than is required by other tribes 
in Africa. The lions live on the large grazing animals, particularly the 
cattle, from which they select the strongest. In driving over the veldt 
we frequently saw one or two men or boys guarding an entire herd 
with only their spears. Their skill in killing a lion with a spear is one 
of the most superb of human achievements. I was interested to learn 
that they much prefer their locally made spears to those that are manu- 138 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
factured outside and brought in, because of their certainty that they 
will not break, will withstand straightening regardless of how much 
they are bent and because due to the process of manufacture will take 
a very sharp edge. 
On one occasion, after we had been kept awake much of the night 
by the roaring of the lions and neighing of the zebras that were being 
attacked by the lions, we visited a Masai manyata nearby in the morn￾ing to learn that when they let their cattle and goats out of the corral 
of acacia thorns, three or four spearsmen went ahead in search of the 
lions that might be waiting to ambush the cattle. They apparently did 
not have the slightest fear. The lions evidentally had made a kill nearby. 
This the natives determined by the number of coyotes. 
The heart and courage of these people has been largely broken by 
the action of the government in taking away their shields in order to 
prevent them pillaging the surrounding native tribes as formerly. They 
depended upon their shields to protect them from the arrows of the 
other tribes. The efforts to make agriculturists of these Masai people 
are not promising. 
In a typical manyata the chief has several wives. Each one has a 
separate dwelling. Timber and shrubbery are so scarce in this vicinity 
that the dwellings are built of clay mixed with cow dung which is plas￾tered over a framework of twigs. Many chiefs are over six feet in height. 
The Masai live in a very extensive game preserve in which hundreds 
of thousands of grazing animals enjoy an existence protected from man 
since even the natives are not allowed to kill the animals as formerly. 
They seemed to be preserved for the numerous lions which occasionally 
become very bold since they have an abundance of food and no enemies. 
Recently the local government authorities found it necessary to shoot 
off eighty of the lions in a particular district because of their aggressive￾ness. 
In the Masai tribe, a study of 2,516 teeth in eighty-eight individuals 
distributed through several widely separated manyatas showed only four 
individuals with caries. These had a total of ten carious teeth, or only 
0.4 per cent of the teeth attacked by tooth decay. 
Kikuyu Tribe, Kiambu, Kenya. In contrast with the Masai, the Kikuyu 
tribe, which inhabits a district to the west and north of the Masai, are characterized by being primarily an agricultural people. Their chief 
articles of diet are sweet potatoes, corn, beans, and some bananas, millet, and Kafir corn, a variety of Indian millet. The women use special diets during gestation and lactation. The girls in this tribe, as in several others, are placed on a special diet for six months prior to marriage. ISOLATED AND AUER ED AFRICAN TRIBES 139 
They nurse their children for three harvests and precede each pregnancy with special feeding. 
The Kikuyus are not as tall as the Masai and physically they are much 
less rugged. Like many of the central African tribes, they remove some 
lower incisors at the time these permanent teeth erupt. This custom is 
reported to have been established for the purpose of feeding the indi￾viduals in case of lock-jaw. One of the striking tribal customs is the 
making of large perforations in the ears in which they carry many 
metal ornaments. A typical Kikuyu woman is shown in Fig. 41 (upper 
right). Typical Kikuyu men are also shown in Fig. 41. Note their fine 
teeth and dental arches. 
A study of 1,041 teeth in thirty-three individuals showed fifty-seven 
teeth with caries, or 5.5 per cent. These were 36.4 per cent of the indi￾viduals affected. 
Much of the territory occupied by the Kikuyu tribes was formerly 
forest. Their practice has been to burn down a section of forest in order 
to get new lands for planting. As soon as the virgin fertility is ex￾hausted, which is usually in three to five years, they burn down another 
section of forest. By this process they have largely denuded their section 
of Kenya of its timber. This has resulted in a great waste of building 
material. There are few stands of native forest within easy reach of 
transportation. 
Wakamba Tribe, Kenya. The Wakamba tribe point their teeth as 
shown in Fig. 41. They occupy the territory to the east of the Masai, 
who in past centuries have driven themselves as a wedge between the 
Kikuyu and the Wakamba tribes. The Masai until checked carried on 
a relentless warfare, consisting largely of raids, in which they slaughtered 
the men and carried off the women and children and drove away the 
cattle or goats. The Wakambas are intellectually superior to the Kikuyus 
and have distinct artistic skill in the carving of art‘objects. They are 
mechanical and like machinery. Many of them have important posi￾tions in the shops of the Kenya and Uganda railway. 
An examination of 1,112 teeth of thirty-seven individuals showed 
sixty-nine teeth with caries, or 6.2 per cent. Twenty-one and six-tenths 
per cent of the individuals studied had dental caries. 
Jalou Tribe, Kenya. This tribe occupies the territory along Lake Vic￾toria and Kisumu Bay. They are one of the most intelligent and physi￾cally excellent native tribes. They were studied in two groups, one at 
Maseno, and the other at Ogado. 
The group studied at the Maseno school were boys ranging from about 
ten years to twenty-two, totaling about 190 in all. The principal of the 140 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

school presented the boys in military formation for inspection. Through 
him as interpreter I asked that all boys who had ever had toothache 
hold up their hands, and nineteen did so. Of the nineteen only one 
individual was found to have caries; two of his teeth were involved, 
which, out of 546 teeth for these individuals, gives 0.4 per cent of the 
teeth with caries. 
In the Ogada Mission a study of 258 teeth for ten individuals re￾vealed no teeth affected with dental caries. 
Jeannes School, Kenya. This school is located at Kabete. It is an in￾stitution where young married couples are trained in domestic science, 
agriculture, and similar subjects. 
In 388 teeth of thirteen individuals, thirty-one teeth were found to 
have been attacked by dental caries, or 7.9 per cent. These were in 
six individuals. 
Pumwani Mission School, Kenya. This is a native suburb of Nairobi, 
and there the people have come under the influence of recent European 
contact. 
In an examination of 588 teeth of twenty-one individuals twenty-six 
teeth had caries, or 4.4 per cent. 
C. M. S. School, Nukuru, Kenya. The children of this school belong 
to several tribes, chiefly Jalou. In a study of 312 teeth of eleven indi￾viduals, only one tooth was found to have been attacked by tooth 
decay, or 0.3 per cent. 
Chewya at Kisumu, Kenya. The natives of this district belong to the 
Maragoli tribe. They are very strong and physically well developed. 
They live within easy reach of Lake Victoria from which they obtain 
large quantities of fish which constitutes an important part of their diet, 
together with cereals and sweet potatoes. 
A study of 552 teeth of nineteen individuals revealed only one tooth 
with dental caries, or 0.2 per cent. 
Muhima Tribe or Anchola, Uganda. This tribe resides in southern 
Uganda. They, like the Masai, are primarily a cattle raising people and 
live on milk, blood and meat. The district in which they live is to the 
east of Lake Edward and the Mountains of the Moon. They constitute 
one of the very primitive and undisturbed groups. While the Masai raise 
chiefly the hump-backed cattle, the herds of this Muhima or Anchola 
tribe are characterized by their large wide-spread horns. Like the Masai, 
they are tall and courageous. They defend their herds and their families 
from lions and leopards with their primitive spears. Like the other primi￾tive cattle people, they dominate the adjoining tribes. 
In a study of 1,040 teeth of thirty-seven individuals, not a single 142 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
tooth was found with dental caries. This tribe makes their huts of grass 
and sticks. 
Watusi Tribe. This is a very interesting tribe living on the east of 
Lake Kivu, one of the headwaters of the West Nile in Ruanda which is 
a Belgian Protectorate. They are tall and athletic. Their faces differ 
markedly from those of other tribes, and they boast a very noble in￾heritance. According to legend, a Roman military expedition pene￾trated into central Africa at the time of Anthony and Cleopatra. A 
phalanx remained, refusing to return with the expedition. They took 
wives from the native tribes and passed laws that thereafter no mar￾riage could take place outside their group. They have magnificent phy￾siques. Many stand over six feet without shoes. 
Several of the tribes neighboring Ethiopia are agriculturists and grow 
corn, beans, millet, sweet potatoes, bananas, Kafir corn, and other grains, 
as their chief articles of food. Physically they are not as well built 
as either the tribes using dairy products liberally or those using fish from 
the fresh water lakes and streams. They have been dominated because 
they possess less courage and resourcefulness. 
The Government of Kenya has for several years sponsored an athletic 
contest among the various tribes, the test being one of strength for which 
they use a tug-of-war. One particular tribe has carried off the trophy 
repeatedly. This tribe resides on the east coast of Lake Victoria and lives 
very largely on fish. The members are powerful athletes and wonderful 
swimmers. They are said not to have been conquered in warfare when 
they could take the warfare to the water. One of their methods is to 
swim under water to the enemy’s fleet and scuttle their boats. They 
fight with spears under water with marvelous skill. Their physiques are 
magnificent. In a group of 190 boys who had been gatherei into a gov￾ernment school near the east coast of Lake Victoria only ane boy was 
found with dental caries, and two of his teeth had been affected. The 
people dry the fish which are carried far inland. 
Uganda which lies to the north and west of Lake Victoria and west 
of Kenya, is high and although on the equator, has an equitable climate 
with an abundance of native foods. Two crops per year are produced, 
and many varieties of bananas grow wild. The Buganda Tribe, Uganda, 
is the chief tribe of this region. Uganda has been called the Garden of 
Eden of Africa because of its abundance of plant foods, chiefly bananas 
and sweet potatoes, and because of its abundance of fresh water fish and 
animal life. The natives are thrifty and mentally superior to those of 
most other districts. They have a king and a native parliament which 
the British Government recognizes and entrusts with local administra- ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AFRICAN TRIBES 143

West Nile Laborers from the Belgian Congo. The West Nile Laborers 
studied at Masaka represent a very strong and dependable group. They 
come from districts north of Lake Albert in Belgian Congo. They are 
much sought for in industrial enterprises and are often moved in groups 
for a considerable distance. 
A study of 984 teeth of thirty-one individuals revealed that only 
three teeth had ever been attacked by tooth decay, or 0.3 per cent. Only 
one individual had dental caries. 
As one travels down the West Nile and later along the western border 
of Ethiopia many unique tribes are met. A typical negroid type of the 
upper Nile region is shown in Fig. 42. Members of these tribes wear 
little or no clothing. They have splendid physiques and high immunity 
to dental caries. 
After the confluence of the White Nile and West Nile, the former 
draining Lake Victoria and the Uganda lakes through Uganda, and the 
latter, Lakes Kivu, Edwards and Albert and eastern Belgian Congo, the 
volume of water moving northward is very large. A unique obstruction 
to navigation has developed due to the fact that the Nile runs under￾ground for a considerable distance. In this district vegetation is rank and 
prolific, including large quantities of water plants which form islands 
that are often attached temporarily to the shore. The water carries large 
quantities of alluvia which furnish an abundance of nutriment to the 
floating plant life. Accordingly, in many of these floating islands a large 
quantity of soil is enmeshed in the plant roots. At some period in the 
past the river became bridged across in upper Sudan near its southern 
border. With the progressive addition of new material a large natural 
bridge has been raised on which trees are now growing, and across which 
are elephant trails. This and a series of rapids require a detour of over 
a hundred miles. 
The elephants are so plentiful in this district that both in Uganda 
and Sudan the governments have been required to send in special hunters 
to reduce the herds. In one district in Uganda two hundred were said 
to have been slaughtered. They are very destructive to banana planta￾tions. They break the banana trees over or pull them up by the roots 
and eat the succulent heart as well as the fruits. In a night a herd may 
destroy an entire plantation. The only people in the districts who are 
permitted to kill the elephants without license are the pygmies. They 
are also the only ones not required to pay a head tax. There are many 144 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

tribes of them in the great forest area in Belgian Congo and Uganda. 
Their skill with spears is remarkable and they are able to kill an elephant 
while the animal remains unaware of his danger. It takes them one to 
two days to hamstring an elephant by working stealthily from behind, 
always keeping out of the elephant’s sight. Although an elephant can 
scent a human for a long distance, these pygmies can disguise themselves 
so completely that the elephant is unaware of their presence. After dis￾abling him by cutting the tendons of both hind legs, they attack him 
openly and, while one attracts his attention, the other slowly but pro￾gressively hacks off his trunk. In this manner he bleeds to death. They 
are particularly fond of elephant meat and a slaughter means a great 
feast. While we were in one of the pygmy colonies two of them brought 
in the tusks of an elephant they had just killed. We had the rare oppor￾tunity of witnessing the celebration in the colony, which included the 
special reproduction in pantomime of the attack and method of killing 
the elephant. The pygmy mother of these two men is shown in Fig. 43 
(lower half). It will be noticed that she is a full head shorter than 
Mrs. Price, who is five feet three inches tall. This rugged, though small, 
woman is the mother of five grown men, two of whom are shown in 
Fig. 43 with the tusks of the elephant. Note their homemade spears. 
As marksmen with bows and arrows and as trappers, these pygmies have 
wonderful skill. Their arrows are tipped with iron of their own manu￾facture and have receptacles for carrying drugs which they extract 
from plants. These drugs temporarily paralyze the animals. For animals 
which they wish to destroy the arrows carry a poison which rapidly 
produces death. The home life of the pygmies in the forest is often 
filled with danger. Just before our arrival two babies had been carried 
off by a leopard. This stealthy night prowler is one of the most difficult 
animals to combat and probably has been one of the reasons the pygmies 
build cabins in the trees. Ordinarily their homes are built on the ground 
in a little clearing in the big forest. They consist of low shelters cov￾ered with banana leaves and other plants, built over a frame work.

Pygmies, Ituru Forest, Belgian Congo. These people are said to have 
originally lived in the trees and they were exceedingly shy and difficult 
to contact. We were taken to several of their villages in the heart of

very difficult. 
A study of 352 teeth of twelve individuals revealed eight teeth had 
been attacked by tooth decay, or 2.2 per cent. 
The native tribes of Africa have depended to a great extent on fresh 
water fish from the numerous lakes and rivers for certain of their essen￾tial food factors. After being dried in the sun these fish are carried long 
distances into the interior. The Nile perch grows frequently to a weight 
of 150 pounds. The natives of Africa know that certain insects are very 
rich in special food values at certain seasons, also that their eggs are valu￾able foods. A fly that hatches in enormous quantities in Lake Victoria is 
gathered and used fresh and dried for storage. They also use ant eggs and 
ants. 
Nyankunde Mission, Irumu, Belgian Congo. This group is made up 
of members of the Bahema, Babira, Alur and Balendu tribes. We will 
consider the representatives of these different tribes collectively since 
they live largely on a common dietary consisting chiefly of cereals. Only 
the Bahemas of this group have small herds of cattle. Some of the others 
have a few goats. This district is located southwest of Lake Albert. 
A study of 6,461 teeth of 217 individuals revealed 390 teeth with 
dental caries, or 6 per cent. Thirty-eight and seven-tenths per cent of 
the individuals suffered from dental caries. 
Bogora Mission, Belgian Congo. This mission is located west of Lake 
Albert and includes members of the Bahema and Balendu tribes. While 
the Bahema tribe originally lived very largely on cattle products, milk, 
blood and meat, in this district, the herds were small and they were 
using a considerable quantity of cereals, chiefly corn and beans, some 
sweet potatoes and bananas. These latter were the chief foods of the 
other tribes, in addition to goats’ milk. 
An examination of 2,196 teeth of seventy-seven individuals revealed 
160 teeth with caries, or 7.2 per cent. Fifty-three per cent of the indi￾viduals had caries. 
Kasenyi Port, Lake Albert, Belgian Congo. These natives were mem￾bers of several tribes surrounding this district who were for the most 
part temporary residents as laborers. The people had been living largely 
on a cereal diet and now during their temporary residence at the port 
had had fish. 
An examination of 1,940 teeth of sixty-three individuals revealed 120 
teeth with dental caries, or 6.1 per cent of the teeth. Fifty and eight￾tenths per cent of the individuals had dental caries.

Belgian Congo. Their diet consists largely of bananas, sweet potatoes, 
cereals and goats’ milk. 
In an examination of 368 teeth of thirteen individuals, there were

of the individuals were affected. 
Baitu Tribe, Nyunge, Ruanda, Belgian Protectorate. This district lies 
south of Uganda and east of Belgian Congo proper, northwest of Tan￾ganyika. It lies just east of Lake Kivu. When we learn that Lake Kivu 
was only discovered in 1894, even though it is one of the important 
sources of the Nile waters, we realize the primitiveness of the people 
of this and adjoining districts. This group lives largely on dairy products 
from cattle and goats, together with sweet potatoes, cereals and bananas. 
In a study of 364 teeth of thirteen individuals, not a single tooth was 
found to have been attacked by dental caries. 
Native Hotel Staff at Goma, Belgian Congo. This group consisted of

An examination of 320 teeth of ten individuals revealed twenty teeth 
with caries, or 6.3 per cent. It is significant that all of these carious teeth 
were in the mouth of one individual, the cook. The others all boarded 
themselves and lived on native diets. The cook used European foods. 
Where the members of the African tribes had attached themselves 
to coffee plantations aad were provided with the imported foods of 
white flour, sugar, polished rice and canned goods, tooth decay became 
rampant. This is typically illustrated in Fig. 44. 
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan has an area approximately one-third that of 
the United States. It is traversed throughout its length from south to 
north by the Nile. There are several tribes living along this great water￾way, which are of special interest now owing to their close proximity to 
Ethiopia. There are wonderful hunters and warriors among them. In 
hunting they use their long-bladed spears almost entirely. The shores 
of the Nile for nearly a thousand miles in this district are lined with 
papyrus and other water plants to a depth of from several hundred 
yards to a few miles. Back of this area the land rises and provides ex￾cellent pasturage for the grazing cattle. These tribes, therefore, use milk, 
blood and meat from cattle and large quantities of animal life from the 
Nile River. Some of the tribes are very tall, particularly the Neurs. The 
women are often six feet or over, and the men seven feet, some of them 
reaching seven and a half feet in height. I was particularly interested 
in their food habits both because of their high immunity to dental caries 
which approximated one hundred per cent, and because of their physical 
development. I learned that they have a belief which to them is their ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AFRICAN TRIBES 149

religion, namely, that every man and woman has a soul which resides 
in the liver and that a man’s character and physical growth depend 
upon how well he feeds that soul by eating the livers of animals. The 
liver is so sacred that it may not be touched by human hands. It is 
accordingly always handled with their spear or saber, or with specially 
prepared forked sticks. It is eaten both raw and cooked. 
Many of these tribes, like the Neurs, wear no clothing and decorate 
their bodies with various designs, some of them representing strings 
of beads produced by putting foreign substances under the skin in defi￾nite order. They have maintained a particularly bitter warfare against 
the Arab slave dealers who have come across from the Red Sea coast 
to carry off the women and children. In isolated districts even to this 
day they are suspicious of foreigners. We were told that in one district 
adjoining Ethiopia all light skinned people are in danger and cannot 
safely enter that territory without a military escort. 
Terrakeka, Upper Nile, Sudan. These people are tall and live largely 
on fish and other animal life. This part of Sudan consists of many dis￾tricts of great marshland called the sudd. It is covered with rank papyrus 
to the height of fifteen to thirty feet. This jungle of rank marsh growth 
swarms with a wide variety of animal life, large and small. 
An examination of 548 teeth of eighteen individuals revealed that 
not a single tooth had been attacked by dental caries, or 100 per cent

Neurs, Malakal, Sudan. The Neurs at Malakal on the Nile River are 
a unique tribe because of their remarkable stature. Many of the women 
are six feet tall and the men range from six feet to seven and a half 
feet in height. Their food consists very largely of animal life of the 
Nile, dairy products, milk and blood from the herds. 
A study of 1,268 teeth of thirty-nine individuals revealed only six 
teeth with dental caries, or 0.5 per cent. Only three individuals had 
caries, or 7.7 per cent. 
Dinkas, Jebelein, Sudan. This tribe lives on the Nile. Its members are 
not as tall as the Neurs. They are physically better proportioned and 
have greater strength. They use fish from the Nile and cereals for their 
diet. They decorate their bodies profusely with scars. 
An examination of 592 teeth of twenty-two individuals revealed only 
one tooth with caries, or 0.2 per cent. 
Arab Schools at Khartoum and Omdurman, Sudan. The Arabs are 
the chief occupants of the territory of Northern Sudan. Omdurman on the west bank of the White Nile opposite Khartoum is the largest purely Arab city in the world. It has been but slightly influenced by modern ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AFRICAN TRIBES 151 
civilization, Khartoum, on the contrary, just across the river from 
Omdurman and the capital of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, has districts 
which are typically modern. ‘These include the government offices and 
administration organization, The Arab section of Khartoum has been 
definitely influenced by contact with the Europeans. This makes pos￾sible a comparative study of similar groups in the two cities modern￾ived Khartoum and primitive Omdurman. 
A study of 1,284 teeth of fifty-two individuals in an Arab school 
at Khartoum revealed that 59 teeth or 4.7 per cent had been attacked 
by dental caries, or 44.2 per cent of the individuals studied. 
In Omdurman a study of 744 teeth in thirty-one individuals, revealed 
only nine teeth that had been attacked by tooth decay, or 1.2 per cent. 
In this group only two or 6.4 per cent of the individuals had dental

The groups examined were selected with the assistance of the govern￾ment otheials and consisted of the higher grade pupils in two advanced

It is of interest that of the two boys in the Arab school at Omdur￾man with dental caries one was the son of a rich merchant and used 
liberally sweets and European foods.

per cent of the individuals ot this group had dental caries. 
300 had one or more carious teeth, or had lost teeth by caries, making 
29.9 per cent of the individuals with dental caries. Of this total number 
of individuals studied in twenty-seven groups, there were several groups 
with practically complete immunity to dental caries, while other groups 
had relatively high incidence of that disease. 152 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

Facial and Dental Arch Deformities. The purpose of these studies has included the obtaining of data which will throw light also on the etiology of deformities of the dental arches and face, including irreg￾ularity of position of the teeth. 
A marked variation of the incidence of irregularities was found in 
the different tribes. This variation could be directly associated with the 
nutrition rather than with the tribal pattern. The lowest percentage of 
irregularity occurred in the tribes living very largely on dairy products 
and marine life. For example, among the Masai living on milk, blood and 
meat, only 3.4 per cent had irregularities. Among the Kikuyu and 
Wakamba, 18.2 and 18.9 per cent respectively had irregularities. These 
people were largely agriculturists living primarily on vegetable foods. 
In the native Arab school at Omdurman, among the pupils living almost 
entirely according to the native customs of selection and preparation of 
foods, 6.4 per cent had irregularities, while in the native school at mod￾ernized Khartoum 17 per cent had irregularities. In the Ikhlas school at 
Cairo, under modern influence, 16.5 per cent had irregularities. In the 
native hospital at Khartoum, 70 per cent had irregularities. In the Pygmy 
group 33.3 per cent had irregularities, and among the grain eaters of the 
west Nile, 25.5 per cent had irregularities. The Jeannes School had 46.1 
per cent and the Ogada mission 30 per cent. 
While the primitive racial stocks of Africa developed normal facial 
and dental arch forms when on their native foods, several characteristic 
types of deformity frequently developed in the children of the modern￾ized groups. One of the simplest forms, and one which corresponds with 
a very common deformity pattern in the United States, involves the 
dropping inward of the laterals with narrowing of the upper arch 
making the incisors appear abnormally prominent and crowding the 
cuspids outside the line of the arch. Typical illustrations of this are 
shown in Fig. 45. Where the nutritional deficiency is very severe, as at 
Mombasa on the coast, more severe changes in facial form are found. 
Among the deformity patterns a lack of development forward of the 
middle third of the face or of the lower third of the face often appeared 
in the more highly modernized groups. An illustration of the former is 
seen in Fig. 46 (upper left), and of the latter in Fig. 46 (lower left and 
right). In the girl at the upper left, the upper arch tends to go inside 
the lower arch all around. This girl is of the first generation, in a mis￾sion in Nairobi, following the adoption of the modernized foods by the 
parents. 
A more extreme and severe type of facial change involves an abnor- is4 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

This is shown typically in Fig. 47. 
These extreme deformities often produce facial expressions that are 
suggestive of the faces of some of the monkeys. This is illustrated by 
the three boys shown with the monkey in Fig. 48. 
The Arabs in several districts use camels’ milk extensively. It is nutri￾tious, and in much of the desert country constitutes the mainstay of the 
nomads for months at a time. The primitive Arabs studied had fine 
dental arches with very little deformity. Even the horses ridden by the 
Arab chiefs in moving their camel herds across the desert are often 
dependent, sometimes for as long as three months, upon the milk of 
the camels for their nutrition. Typical Arab faces and a camel caravan 
at rest are shown in Fig. 49. The primitive Arab girls have splendidly 
developed faces and fine dental arches. Their natural beauty, however, 
is rapidly lost with modernization, as illustrated in Fig. 50. 
Dr. Hrdli¢ka has called attention to the occasional development in

While slavery of the old form no longer exists in the so-called civil￾ized countries, in its new form it is a most tragic reality for many of 
the people. Taxes and the new order of living make many demands. For 
many of these primitive tribes a new suit of clothes could formerly be 
had every day with no more trouble than cutting a new banana leaf. 
With the new order they are requested to cover their bodies with cloth￾ing. Cloth of all kinds including the poorest cotton has to be imported. 
They must pay an excessive charge due to the long transportation cost 
for the imported goods, a charge which often exceeds the original cost 
in the European or American markets by several fold. In order to pay 
their head tax they are frequently required to carry such products as 
can be used by the government officials, chiefly foods, over long distances 
and for part of each year. These foods are often those which not only 
the adults, but particularly the growing children sorely need for provid￾ing body growth and repair. This naturally has produced a current of 
acute unrest and a chafing under the foreign domination. 
As we encircled Ethiopia we found the natives not only aware of 
what was going on in that border country, but deeply concerned re￾garding the outcome. From their temper and sympathetic attitude for 
the oppressed Ethiopians, it would not be surprising if sympathizers 
pass over the border into that country to support their crushed neigh- 158 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

foreign domination. The native African is not only chafing under the 
taxation by foreign overlords, but is conscious that his race becomes 
blighted when met by our modern civilization. I found them well aware 
of the fact that those of their tribes who had adopted European methods 
of living and foods not only developed rampant tooth decay, but other 
degenerative processes. 
In one of the most efficiently organized mission schools that we found 
in Africa, the principal asked me to help them solve a serious problem. 
He said there was no single question asked them so often by the native 
boys in their school as why it is that those families that have grown up 
in the mission or government schools were physically not so strong as 
those families who had never been in contact with the mission or gov￾ernment schools. These young men were thinking. I was even asked 
several times by them whether or not I thought that the native Africans 
must go the way of the Red Indians of America. 
The happiness of the people in their homes and community life is 
everywhere very striking. A mining prospector who had spent two ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AFRICAN TRIBES 161 
decades studying the mineral deposits of Uganda was quoted to me as 
stating that if he could have the heaven of his choice in which to spend 
all eternity it would be to live in Uganda as the natives of Uganda had 
lived before modern civilization came to it. 
While inter-tribal warfare has largely ceased, a new scourge is upon 
them, namely the scourge which comes with modern civilization. As in 
the primitive racial stocks previously studied and reported, we found 
that modernizing forces were often associated with a very marked in￾crease of the death rate over the birth rate. In some districts in Africa 
a marked degeneration is taking place. Geoffrey Gorer in his book, 
“Africa Dances,” which was written after making studies in West 
Africa, discusses this problem at length. 
He quotes figures given by Marcel Sauvage” in his article on French 
Equatorial Africa: “ “In 1911 French Equatorial Africa had twenty mil￾lion negro inhabitants; in 1921 there were seven and a half million; in 
1931 there were two and a half million.’ ” 
He states regarding the quotation: “These figures were given in a 
responsible French conservative paper and have not been denied.”’ Major 
Browne, a high official of the British Government Administrative De￾partment of Kenya, with long experience, states in the closing paragraph 
of his book entitled, ‘““The Vanishing Tribes of Kenya,” the following: 
It must also be remembered that the “blessings of civilization” are not in 
practice by any means as obvious as some simple-minded folk would like to 
believe. It can be said with fair accuracy that among the tribes with which 
we have been dealing there is, in their uncontaminated society, no pauperism, 
no paid prostitution, very little serious drunkenness, and on the whole astonish￾ingly little crime; while practically everyone has enough to eat, sufficient 
clothing, and an adequate dwelling, according to the primitive native standard. 
Of what civilized community can as much be said? 
Civilizations have been rising and falling not only through all the 
period of recorded history, but long before as evidenced by archeo￾logical findings. If we think of Nature’s calendar as one in which cen￾turies are days and civilizations are years, the part current events are 
playing in the history of a great continent like Africa may be mere 
incidents. 
This much we do know that throughout the world some remnants 
of several primitive racial stocks have persisted to this day even in very 
exacting environments and only by such could they have been protected. 
In my studies of these several racial stocks I find that it is not ac￾cident but accumulated wisdom regarding foods that lies behind their 
physical excellence and freedom from our modern degenerative proc- 162 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
esses, and, further, that on various sides of our world the primitive 
people know many of the things that are essential for life—things that 
our modern civilizations apparently do not know. These are the funda￾mental truths of life that have put them in harmony with Nature 
through obeying her nutritional laws. Whence this wisdom? Was there 
in the distant past a world civilization that was better attuned to 
Nature’s laws and have these remnants retained that knowledge? If this 
is not the explanation, it must be that these various primitive racial stocks 
have been able through a superior skill in interpreting cause and effect, to 
determine for themselves what foods in their environment are best for 
producing human bodies with a maximum of physical fitness and resist￾ance to degeneration. 
Primitive native races of eastern and central Africa have in their 
native state a very high immunity to dental caries, ranging from 0 to 
less than 1 per cent of the teeth affected for many of the tribes. Where 
modernized, however, the incidence increased to 12.1 per cent. 
In the matter of facial deformity thirteen tribes out of twenty-seven 
studied presented so high a standard of excellence that not a single in￾dividual in the group was found with deformed dental arches. 
Their nutrition varied according to their location, but always pro￾vided an adequate quantity of body-building and repairing material, 
even though much effort was required to obtain some of the essential 
food factors. Many tribes practiced feeding girls special foods for an 
extended period before marriage. Spacing of children was provided by 
a system of plural wives.

ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AUSTRALIAN 
ABORIGINES 
UR problem of throwing light upon the cause of the physical break￾down of our modern civilization, with special consideration of 
tooth decay and facial deformity, requires a critical examination of 
individuals living in as wide a range of physical conditions as may be 
possible. This requires that the Aborigines of Australia be included in 
this examination of human reactions to physical environments. These 
were studied in 1936. 
In selecting the individuals in the various groups special effort was 
made to include children between the ages of ten and sixteen years in 
order to have an opportunity to observe and record the condition of the 
dental arches after the permanent teeth had erupted. This was necessary 
because the deciduous dentition or first set of teeth may be in normal 
position in the arches with a correct relationship between the arches, 
and the permanent dentition show marked irregularity. The shape of 
the dental arches of the infant at birth and the teeth that are to take 
their place in the arches have considerable of their calcification at birth. 
The development of the adult face, however, does not occur until the 
permanent teeth have erupted. The general shape or pattern is largely 
influenced by the position and direction of the eruption of the perma￾nent teeth. These studies, accordingly, have included a careful, detailed 
record of the shape of the dental arch of each individual. 
The Australian Aborigines constitute one of the most unique primi￾tive races that have come out of the past into our modern times and 
they are probably the oldest living race. We are particularly concerned 
with those qualities that have made possible their survival and cultural 
development. 
The Aborigines are of special interest because they have come out of 
a very distant past and are associated with animal life which is unique 
in being characterized as a living museum preserved from the dawn of 
animal life on the earth. Many of the animal species that are abundant 
in Australia are found only in fossil form on other continents. The 
evidence indicates that they crossed on a land bridge which connected 
163 1644 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Australia with Asia. After the bridge was submerged the animals per￾sisted in that protected island continent which never has known any of 
the animal species of later development. Among these animals the mar￾supials play an important role and constitute a large variety. The Amer￾ican continent has only one or two of the many forms found in Aus￾tralia. These are the opossum of the marsupial family and the sloth. One 
of the most curious animals living on the earth today, or that has left 
its remains in the petrified skeletons of early periods of the earth’s his￾tory, is the duckbill platypus. It has the unique distinction of having the 
characteristics of several animal species. It lays eggs like a bird and 
hatches them with the heat of its body in its pouch. It has webbed, 
five-toed feet, like the water birds, a bill like a duck and hair and tail 
like a beaver. The typical marsupial pouch for carrying its young, is 
another characteristic of this strange animal. Like other mammals it 
provides milk for its young. Its milk is similar in chemical constituents 
to that of other mammals. Most rudimentary in form are the mammary 
glands of the platypus. The young, when hatched in the pouch, nuzzle 
the lining membrane of the pouch and the milk exudes through minute 
openings. There is no nipple. The animal lives chiefly in the water. Its 
home is built above the water level on the bank, but the entrance to it 
is underneath the water. They are exceedingly playful creatures, ap￾parently more at home in the water than on land. They live on both 
animal life and plant food found under the water. They seem to be 
related to an early era of differentiation of animal species. 
The Aborigines are credited with having the most primitive type of 
skeletal development of any race living today. The eyes are very deep 
set, the brows very prominent giving them an expression that identifies 
them as a distinct racial type. See Fig. 52. Professor Weidenreich has 
shown that they resemble in this regard the recently discovered ancient 
Peking man. While they are still in the Stone Age stage in their arts 
and crafts, they have developed further in some respects than has any 
other ancient race. Their skill in tracking and outwitting the fleet and 
very cunning animal life of their land is so remarkable that they have 
been accredited with a sixth sense. They have been able to build good 
bodies and maintain them in excellent condition in a country in which 
the plant life, and consequently the lower animal life can be maintained 
at only a very low level because of the absence of rain. Over half of Australia has less than ten inches of rain a year. It is significant that 
the natives have maintained a vigorous existence in districts in which the 
white population which expelled them is unable to continue to live. 165 AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES ONVIVIZ MAN sl IL|4 sl VOWVS Pe

Fic. 52. The Aborigines of Australia are recognized to be the oldest living race of 
mankind. Note the prominent eyebrows and deep set eyes. The man at the upper right 
is holding his spears and wamara, or spear thrower. They are very fond of decorations 
on their bodies. Little baldness was seen even in the very old. 168 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Among the white race there, the death rate approaches or exceeds the 
birth rate. 
They have developed a device for throwing spears, which makes them 
more deadly than any in the world. I witnessed a group of the present￾day natives throwing their spears at a target which consisted of a banana 
stalk much smaller than a man’s body. They threw the spears from a 
distance which I estimated to be seventy-five yards. About thirty spears 
were thrown and several pierced the banana stalk and the others were 
stuck in the ground close around it. This was accomplished by means 
of a wamara or throwing stick approximately as long as the arm, with a 
strong hand grip at one end and a device on the other end for engaging 
in a depression in the butt of the spear. This was thrown by poising 
the spear about the level of the shoulder, the spear supported by the fin￾gers of the hand which swung the throwing stick. The latter extended 
back over the shoulder. The impact of their spears has often been 
demonstrated to be sufficient to completely penetrate a man’s body. 
Their method of tempering wood for the points of the spears was 
such that the spearheads offered great resistance. A throwing stick is 
shown in Fig. 52 (upper right). 
These natives decorate their bodies with paints for dances and sports. 
They know the habits of all of the animals and insects so well that they 
are able to reproduce the calls of the animals and thus decoy them into 
traps. Some of the water birds maintain sentinels at lookout points to 
guard those in the water. The Aborigines are able to decoy these birds 
by most ingenious methods. They travel with their bodies disguised by 
grass and shrubbery and enter the water with a headgear made from 
feathers of one of the birds. Once in the water, they then maneuver 
in a manner similar to that of the birds and go among the flock of 
wild ducks or swans. Working entirely under water, they draw the birds 
under one by one and take load after load to shore without raising the 
suspicion of the flock. When working among the kangaroos they are so 
skilled in preparing movable blinds that they can kill many in a grazing 
wild pack without alarming the rest, always striking when the animal is 
grazing. Their skill at fishing probably exceeds that of any other race. 
They are so highly trained in the knowledge of the habits of the fish and 
the type of movement that the fish transmits to the water and to the 
reeds in the water, that one of their important contests between tribes is to see how many fish can be struck in succession with a spear, the fish never being seen, their only information as to its whereabouts being the change in the surface of the water and movement of grasses that are growing in the water as the fish moves. The fish are started by the AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES 169 
umpire’s striking the water. The experts bring up a fish six times out of 
eight. These fishing contests are held along the banks of lakes and rivers 
where the water is deep enough for some of the reeds and grasses to 
come to the surface. The contestants travel in canoes. 
The native canoe is cut in one piece from the side of a tree, the cut￾ting being done with stone axes. The canoe offers an exceedingly treach￾erous platform from which a standing man must throw his spear. For 
some of the contests the canoe carries a paddler, but in the most exact￾ing contests the spear man must manage his own flat-bottomed canoe. 
The skill of the Aborigines in tracking is so phenomenal that practi￾cally every large modern town or city in Australia has one or more 
of these men on its police staff today to track criminals. For weeks, 
they carry the detailed information about the characteristics of the 
prisoner’s foot across the desert, and when they come across the man’s 
foot print they recognize it among all others in the same path. Every 
leaf that is turned over or grain of sand on bare rocks has meaning for 
them. 
Their social organization is such that almost every person who had 
been in intimate contact with them, testified that they had never known 
any of the Aborigines to be guilty of the theft of anything. Even where 
partly modernized, as they are in the large government reservations they 
are trustworthy. A nurse in an emergency hospital told me that she con￾tinually left her money, jewelry and other objects of personal property 
freely exposed and available where many of the hundreds of primitives 
passing could pick them up, and that she had never known them to take 
anything. The other nurses had had the same experience. 
Every boy and girl among these Aborigines must pass many exam￾inations. Their early schooling includes the tracking of small animals 
and insects. The small boys begin throwing spears almost as soon as 
they can stand up straight. No young man can even witness a meeting 
of the council, let alone become a member of it, until he has passed 
three supreme tests of manhood. First, he is tested for his ability to 
withstand hunger without complaint. The test for this is to go on a 
march for two or three days over the hot desert and assist in preparing 
the meals of roast kangaroo and other choice foods and not partake of 
any himself. He must not complain. If he becomes too weak, he is given 
a small portion. There are tests for fear in which he is placed under the 
most trying ordeals without knowing that it is part of his examination, 
and he must demonstrate that he will accept death rather than flee. No 
member of their society would be allowed to continue to live with the 170 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
tribe if he had defied the ideals of the group. Immorality is cause for 
immediate death. 
The growing boys among the Aborigines are taught deference and 
esteem for their elders in many impressive ways. A boy may not kill 
or capture a slow moving animal. That is left for the older men, whom 
he must call. He must limit his hunting primarily to the fast fleeing and 
canny kangaroos and wallabies, whom even a man on horseback cannot 
outdistance. Racketeers and such unsocial beings could not exist in this 
type of civilization. 
Marriages are arranged according to very distinct tribal patterns 
and every girl is provided with a husband at a time decided by the coun￾cil. Their code of ethics is built around the conception of a powerful 
Supreme Force that is related to the sun. They believe that there is an 
after-existence in which the myriads of stars represent the spirits of the 
Aborigines that lived before. The boys and girls are taught the names 
of the great characters that make up the different constellations. These 
were individuals who had conquered all of the temptations of life and 
had lived so completely in the interest of others that they had fulfilled 
the great motivating principle of their religion, which is that life con￾sists in serving others as one would wish to be served. The seven stars of 
Pleiades were seven beautiful maidens that had surpassed most other 
girls in their devotion and service in the interest of their tribe. It is 
most remarkable how closely this concept is related to the classical myth 
regarding the séven daughters of Atlas and the nymph, Pleione. 
A part of a young men’s examination to determine his ability to with￾stand pain and his power of self-control consists in performing an oper￾ation at the time of his graduation. This operation is at the same time 
calculated to provide him with his badge of attainment. It consists of 
the boy’s lying on his back and allowing the appointed operator to knock 
out one of his front upper teeth. This is done by putting a peg against 
the tooth and hitting it a series of sharp blows with a stone. He must 
endure this without flinching. We saw scores that carried this diploma. 
Prior to this, other very severe tests of physical endurance had been 
successfully completed. 
The marvelous vision of these primitive people is illustrated by the 
fact that they can see many stars that our race cannot see. In this con￾nection it is authoritatively recorded regarding the Maori of New Zea￾land that they can see the satellites of Jupiter which are only visible to 
the white man’s eye with the aid of telescopes. These people prove that they can see the satellites by telling the man at the telescope when the eclipse of one of the stars occurs. It is said of these primitive Aborigines AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES 171 
of Australia that they can see animals moving at a distance of a mile 
which ordinary white people can not see at all. 
While these evidences of superior physical development command our 
most profound admiration, their ability to build superb bodies and main￾tain them in excellent condition in so difficult an environment com￾mands our genuine respect. It is a supreme test of human efficiency. It 
is doubtful if many places in the world can demonstrate so great a con￾trast in physical development and perfection of body as that which 
exists between the primitive Aborigines of Australia who have been the 
sole arbiters of their fate, and those Aborigines who have been under 
the influence of the white man. The white man has deprived them of 
their original habitats and is now feeding them in reservations while 
using them as laborers in modern industrial pursuits. This contrast be￾tween the primitive Aborigines as they still exist in isolated communi￾ties in Australia and the tres members of the clans is not, however, 
much greater than that between these excellent primitives and the 
whites, near whom they are living. 
In my comparative study of primitive races in different parts of the 
world, of modernized members of their groups and of whites who have 
displaced them, as well as in my study of our typical modern social 
organization, I have seldom, if ever, found whites suffering so tragically 
from evidence of physical degeneration, as expressed in tooth decay and 
change in facial form, as are the whites of eastern Australia. This has 
occurred on the very best of the land that these primitives formerly 
occupied and becomes at once a monument to the wisdom of the primi￾tive Aborigines and a signboard of warning to the modern civilization 
that has supplanted them. Their superb physical excellence is demon￾strated in every isolated group in the primitive stocks with which we 
came in contact. For tribes that have lived along the coast and had access 
to the sea foods, their stature was large and well formed. 
When living in the Bush they are largely without clothing. Where 
they are congregated in the reservations they are required to wear cloth￾ing. It is important to note in these people the splendid proportions of 
the faces, all of which are broad, with the dental arches wide and well 
contoured. This is Nature’s normal form for all humans and is shown 
in Figs. 53 and 54 (upper right). The person in Fig. 53 (upper left) is 
a woman. 
Various factors in the changed environment were studied critically. 
Samples of foods were gathered for chemical analysis; and the changes 
in the modern diet from that which was characteristic of the primitives 
were studied. When the teeth of the primitives and the teeth found in 4 ND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

Tooth decay was almost unknown in many districts, AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES 173 
Fic. 54. Wherever the primitive Aborigines have been placed in reservations and 
fed on the white man’s foods of commerce dental caries has become rampant. This 
destroys their beauty, prevents mastication, and provides infection for seriously injuring 
their bodies. Note the contrast between the primitive woman in the upper right and the 
three modernized women. 174 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
the skulls that had been assembled in the museums were examined, it 
was found that dental caries or tooth decay was exceedingly rare among 
the isolated groups. Those individuals, however, who had adopted the 
foods of the white man suffered extremely from tooth decay as did the 
whites. Where they had no opportunity to get native food to combine 
with the white man’s food their condition was desperate and extreme. 
This is readily disclosed in Fig. 54. Note contrast with upper right. It is 
quite impossible to imagine the suffering that these people were com￾pelled to endure due to abscessing teeth resulting from rampant tooth 
decay. As we had found in some of the modernized islands of the Pacific, 
we discovered that here, too, discouragement and a longing for death 
had taken the place of a joy in living in many. Few souls in the world 
have experienced this discouragement and this longing to a greater 
degree. 
One of the most important phases of our special quest was to get 
information that would throw light on the degeneration of the facial 
pattern that occurs so often in our modern civilization. This has its ex￾pression in the narrowing and lengthening of the face and the develop￾ment of crooked teeth. It is most remarkable and should be one of the 
most challenging facts that can come to our modern civilization that 
such primitive races as the Aborigines of Australia, have reproduced for 
generation after generation through many centuries—no one knows 
for how many thousands of years—without the development of a 
conspicuous number of irregularities of the dental arches. Yet, in the 
next generation after these people adopt the foods of the white man, a 
large percentage of the children developed irregularities of the dental 
arches with conspicuous facial deformities. The deformity patterns are 
similar to those seen in white civilizations. Typical illustrations of this 
will be seen in Figs. 55 and 56. Severe deformities of the face were fre￾quently seen in the modernized groups, as evidenced in Fig. 57. 
The data obtained from a study of the native Australians who are 
located in a reservation near Sydney, at LeParouse, revealed that among 
the Aborigines 47.5 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by dental 
caries, and 40 per cent of the individuals had abnormal dental arches. 
For the women of this group, 81.3 per cent of all the teeth had been 
attacked by dental caries, and for the men, 60.4 per cent, and for the children, 16.5 per cent. In this group 100 per cent of the individuals were 
affected by dental caries. 
Palm Island is a government reservation situated in the ocean about fifty miles from the mainland, off the east coast of Australia, about two- thirds of the way up the coast. It was reached by a government launch. AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES 175

Included in the population of this reservation are a large number of 
adults who have been moved from various districts on the mainland of 
Central and Eastern Australia and many children who were born either 
before or after their parents were moved to this reservation. The food 
available on the Island is almost entirely that provided by the govern￾ment. Of ninety-eight individuals examined and measured, 53.1 per 
cent of them had dental caries. For the group as a whole, 8.9 per cent 
of all of the teeth were affected; for the women, 21.2 per cent; for the 
men, 14.2 per cent; and for the children, 5.8 per cent. Fifty per cent of 
the children had deformed dental arches, which occurred in only 11 
per cent of the adults. 
Cape Bedford is situated about three-fourths of the way up the east 
coast and is so isolated that it was necessary for us to use a special aero￾plane to reach it. Landing was made on the beach. This group of people 
is under the management of a German Lutheran missionary. They are 
dependent almost entirely on the food provided by the mission and the 
government. The official in charge had spent fifty years in devoted sery￾ice to these native people. We found him exceedingly sad because of 
the very rapid breakdown that was in progress among the natives in 
his care. The dental caries for the group of eighty-three individuals 
studied was 12.4 per cent of their 2,176 teeth examined. For the women, 
this amounted to 37.2 per cent of the teeth; for the men, 8.4 per cent; 
and for the children, 6.1 per cent. Of the eighty-three individuals, 48.1 
per cent had been affected by dental caries. Many of the adults in this 
group had been born on plantations under the influence of the modern 
nutrition, and many of the children had been born in the mission. For 
the adults, 46 per cent had abnormally formed dental arches, and for 
the children, 41.6 per cent. We were advised that deaths occurred very 
frequently from tuberculosis. This reservation does not provide the 
natives with natural hunting grounds capable of providing the people 
with animal life for food. The coast for some distance inland is a series 
of sand dunes which are slowly being transferred over the vegetation by 
wind, completely smothering it. While the coast is well supplied with a 
variety of deep-water fish the natives have practically no equipment for 
obtaining them, a condition which restricts them very largely to the use 
of the imported foods supplied by the officials. 
Our next stop, using the special aeroplane, was at Lockhart River, 
which is about four-fifths of the way up the east coast of Australia. 
Here again we were able to land on the beach near a large group of 
primitive Aborigines. The isolation here is so nearly complete that they are dependent upon the sea and the land for their foods. This part of AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES 179 
Australia, namely, the York Peninsula, is still so primitive that there 
has been very little encroachment by the white population. It will be 
remembered that in this area there are no roads, the country being a 
primitive wilderness. Of fifty-eight individuals examined, their 1,784 
teeth revealed that only 4.3 per cent had been attacked by dental caries. 
For the women, this amounted to 3.4 per cent; for the men, 6.1 per 
cent; and for the children, 3.2 per cent. Some of these men had at 
some time worked on cattle ranches for the white men. Of the children, 
only 6.3 per cent had abnormal dental arches, and of the adults, 8.7 
per cent. In this group, therefore, 91.4 per cent of all ages had repro￾duced the typical racial pattern as compared with 56 per cent of the 
group at Cape Bedford, 62 per cent of the group at Palm Island, and 60 
per cent at LeParouse. At Lockhart River, 32.7 per cent of the individu￾als had dental caries. 
A reservation called Cowall Creek on the west side of York Peninsula 
situated on the Gulf of Carpenteria, was reached by flying our special 
plane to Horn Island in the Torres Strait north of Australia and pro￾ceeding from there by boat to Thursday Island, and on, by boat, to 
Cowall Creek. In this reservation thirty-five individuals were studied 
and found to be in a very pathetic condition. We were told that deaths 
occurred frequently. Of the 976 teeth examined, 24.6 per cent had 
been attacked by tooth decay. For the women, this amounted to 60.7 
per cent; for the men, 30.4 per cent; and for the children, 8.9 per cent. 
Forty-nine and six-tenths per cent of the individuals studied had ab￾normal dental arches. Of the children 66.6 per cent had deformed dental 
arches, and 9 per cent of the adults. Many of these adults had been 
raised in the bush. Of the individuals studied, 68.6 per cent had had 
dental caries. One can scarcely visualize, without observing it, the dis￾tress of a group of primitive people situated as these people are, com￾pelled to live in a very restricted area, forced to live on food provided 
by the government, while they are conscious that if they could return 
to their normal habits of life they would regain their health and again 
enjoy life. Many individuals were seen with abscessing teeth. One girl 
with a fistula exuding pus on the outside of her face is shown in Fig. 58 
(upper right). In their native life where they could get the foods that 
keep them well and preserve their teeth, they had no need for dentists. 
Now they have need, but have no dentists. It is easy to chide and blame 
the officials who provide them with the modernized foods under which 
they are breaking, but it must be remembered that practically all mod￾ern civilizations are more or less in the same plight themselves. 
An opportunity was provided for examining a group of the native 180 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

Aborigines of Australia who made up the crew of eighteen for a pearl￾fishing boat. Of this group, 5.7 per cent of their 554 teeth had been at￾tacked by tooth decay. These individuals could be readily divided into 
two groups; namely, those who had been raised in the Bush and those 
who had been raised in missions. For the thirteen raised in the Bush, not 
a single tooth of their 364 teeth had ever been attacked by tooth decay 
and not a single individual had deformed dental arches. In contrast with 
this, of the five raised in the mission, 19.3 per cent of their 140 teeth 
had been attacked by tooth decay and 40 per cent of these individuals 
had abnormal dental arches. 
The cook on the government boat was an aboriginal Australian from 
Northern Australia. He had been trained on a military craft as a dieti￾tian. Nearly all his teeth were lost. It is of interest that while the native 
Aborigines had relatively perfect teeth, this man who was a trained 
dietitian for the whites had lost nearly all his teeth from tooth decay 
and pyorrhea. 
In the group of Aborigines so far reported, there were many who had 
come from the interior districts of Australia and many who had always 
lived near the coast. These two types of districts provided quite dif￾ferent types of foods. Those near the coast were able to obtain animal 
life from the sea, including fish, dugong or sea cow, a great variety of 
shell fish, and some sea plants. Those from the interior districts could not 
obtain animal life of the sea, but did obtain animal life of the land which 
was eaten with their plant foods in each case. It was quite important to 
reach a group of Aborigines who had always lived inland and who were 
on a reservation inland. This contact was made with the group at a gov￾ernment reservation called Cherbourg. A typical group of individuals 
was examined. Of forty-five individuals with 1,236 teeth, 42.5 per cent 
of the teeth had been attacked by tooth decay. For the women, this 
constituted 43.7 per cent; for the men, 64.6 per cent; and for the chil￾dren, 5.6 per cent. Of all of the individuals here examined 64.5 per cent 
had dental caries. It is of interest that many of these men had worked 
on white men’s cattle ranches. While the adults showed 11.7 per cent 
to have deformed dental arches, this rose to 50 per cent for the chil￾dren of the group. We were informed that in all of these groups tuber￾culosis was taking a very heavy toll. In Fig. 58, upper left, will be seen 
a boy with a superating tubercular gland of the axilla; at the right, a 
girl with a fistula draining pus onto the outside of the face from an 
abscessed tooth; below, deformed legs and a girl with tubercular glands 
of the neck. 
A reservation situated on the coast where sea foods were available 182 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
might be expected to make available a particular type of nutrition 
through sea foods. The individuals in a reservation for the Aborigines 
at Tweed Heads, which is so situated, were studied. Of the twenty-seven 
individuals examined, 89 per cent had dental caries. Of their 774 teeth, 
39.7 per cent had been attacked by dental caries. For the women, this 
amounted to 62.5 per cent; for the men, 70.9 per cent; and for the 
children, 20.8 per cent. Most of these children had been born in this 
environment while their parents were being fed, largely, the foods pro￾vided by the government and mission. In this group, 83.4 per cent of 
the children had deformed dental arches, and 33.3 per cent of the 
adults. 
An interesting incident was brought to my attention in one of the 
Australian reservations where the food was practically all supplied by 
the government. I was told by the director in charge, and in further 
detail by the other officials, that a number of native babies had become 
ill while nursing from their mothers. Some had died. By changing the 
nutrition to a condensed whole milk product, the babies recovered. 
When placed back on their mother’s breast food they again became ill. 
The problem was: Why was not their mothers’ milk adequate? 
I was later told by the director of a condition that had developed in 
the pen of the reservation’s hogs which were kept to use up the scraps 
and garbage from the reservation’s kitchens. He reported that one after 
another the hogs went down with a type of paralysis and could not get 
up. The symptoms were suggestively like vitamin A deficiency in both 
the babies and the hogs, and indicated the treatment. 
The rapid degeneration of the Australian Aborigines after the adop￾tion of the government’s modern foods provides a demonstration that 
should be infinitely more convincing than animal experimentation. It 
should be a matter not only of concern but deep alarm that human 
beings can degenerate physically so rapidly by the use of a certain type 
of nutrition, particularly the dietary products used so generally by mod￾ern civilization. 
The child life among the Aborigines of Australia proved to be exceed￾ingly interesting. Children develop independence very young and learn 
very early to take care of themselves. Mothers are very affectionate and 
show great concern when their children are not thriving. Two typical 
mothers with their children are shown in Fig. 59. These children, as 
suggested in the picture, were keenly interested in everything that I did, 
but were not alarmed or frightened. 
The wonderful wisdom of these primitive people was attested by the principal of the public school at Palm Island. A mother died and her AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES 183 
Fic. 59. Typical Aborigine mothers with their children. 184 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
nursing infant was taken care of by its maternal grandmother, who had 
not recently given birth to a child. She proceeded to carry out the primi￾tive formula for providing breast food by artificial means. Her method 
was to make an ointment of the fresh bodies of an insect which made 
its nest in the leaves of a certain tree. This she rubbed on her breast and 
in a short time produced milk liberally for this foster child. I was shown 
the type of insect, photographed its nest and the colony inside when the 
nest was opened. The people who vouched for this circumstance declared 
that they had seen the entire procedure and knew the facts to be as 
stated. They further stated that this was common knowledge among 
the Aborigines. 
Another important source of information regarding the Aborigines 
of Australia was provided by a study of the skeletal material and skulls 
in the museums at Sydney and Canberra, particularly the former. I do 
not know the number of skulls that are available there for study, but 
it is very large. I examined many and found them remarkably uniform 
in design and quality. The dental arches were splendidly formed. The 
teeth were in excellent condition with exceedingly little dental caries. 
A characteristic of these skulls was the evidence of a shortage of material 
for those that had been transferred to a museum from the interior arid 
plains country. Those skulls, however, that had come from coastal areas 
where sea foods were available, show much more massive dimensions of 
the general pattern. In Fig. 60 will be seen typical skulls showing the 
normal dental arches and general design of the head. It is of interest to 
note the very heavy orbital ridges which characterize this race. 
I have previously referred to a report by Professor Weidenreich re￾garding the resemblance of the Australian native’s skulls to those of the 
recently discovered Peking man in the caves of China. In Fig. 60 are 
two views for comparison. The skull at the left is that of an Australian 
primitive photographed in a museum in Sydney, and an outline of the 
Peking skull is shown at the right. Professor Weidenreich has emphasized 
the observations that when three skulls are put in series, namely, the 
Australian primitive, the Peking skull and a chimpanzee skull, the Pe￾king skull appears to be about half way between the two in design and de￾velopmental order. The Australian primitive’s skull is higher in the 
crown, showing much greater brain capacity. The supra-orbital depres￾sions are less deep in the Peking than in the chimpanzee, and still less 
deep in the Australian primitive. The supra-orbital ridges which produce 
the prominent eyebrows are less pronounced in the Australian primitive 
than in the Peking man, and still more prominent in the chimpanzee. AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES 185 
Fic. 60. The buried skulls throughout Australia provide a dependable record of their 
physical excellence and splendid facial and dental arch forms. In the lower pictures are 
shown the skull dome of a typical Australian Aborigine for comparison with that of 
the recently discovered Peking man who possibly lived a million years ago. 186 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
The prominent supra-orbital ridges of the chimpanzee face are shown in 
Fig. 48. 
The age of the Peking skulls has been variously placed from several 
hundred thousand to a million years. A distinguished anthropologist 
has stated that the Australian primitives are the only people living on 
the earth today that could be part of the first race of mankind. It is a 
matter of concern that if a scale were extended a mile long and the 
decades represented by inches, there would apparently be more degenera￾tion in the last few inches than in the preceding mile. This gives some 
idea of the virulence of the blight contributed by our modern civiliza￾tion. 
The foods available for these people are exceedingly limited in variety 
and quantity, due to the absence of rains, and unfertility of the soil. 
For plant foods they used roots, stems, leaves, berries and seeds of grasses 
and a native pea eaten with tissues of large and smaH animals. The large 
animals available are the kangaroo and wallaby. Among the small ani￾mals they have a variety of rodents, insects, beetles and grubs, and 
wherever available various forms of animal life from the rivers and 
oceans. Birds and birds’ eggs are used where available. They are able to 
balance their rations to provide the requisites for splendid body build￾ing and body repair. In several parts of Australia, which originally sup￾ported a large population of the primitives, none are left except a few 
score in reservations. These also are rapidly disappearing. Their fertility 
has been so greatly reduced that the death rate far exceeds the birth 
rate. 
This group provides evidence of exceptional efficiency in obeying the 
laws of Nature through thousands of years, even in a parched land that 
is exceedingly inhospitable because of the scant plant foods for either 
men or animals. While the Aborigines are credited with being the oldest 
race on the face of the earth today, they are dying out with great ra￾pidity wherever they have changed their native nutrition to that of the 
modern white civilization. For them this is not a matter of choice, but 
rather of necessity, since in a large part of Australia the few that are 
left are crowded into reservations where they have little or no access to 
native foods and are compelled to live on the foods provided for them by our white civilization. They demonstrate in a tragic way the inadequacy 
of the white man’s dietary programs. Chapter ial 
ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED TORRES 
STRAIT ISLANDERS 
1B STUDYING the relationship between nutrition and physical charac￾teristics, it is important to make observations at the point of contact 
with civilization where as few factors as possible in the environment 
have been modified by that contact. My previous studies have shown 
that wherever groups of people were utilizing sea foods abundantly in 
connection with land plants including roots, greens and fruits, they en￾joyed fine physical development with uniform reproduction of the racial 
pattern and a very high immunity to dental caries. For this particular 
study we wished to select a racial group living on islands in tropical or 
subtropical climate, whose ancestral stocks differed from those previously 
observed, and which was located at points of contact with modern 
civilization. A high level of excellence might be expected among the 
groups who were in process of being modernized but were still utilizing 
the native foods. 
For this study the inhabitants of islands north of Australia were 
chosen in order to record the effect on the Asiatic and Malay stocks at 
the points of contact of the north with the south and of the east with 
the west. In the Torres Strait there are a number of fertile islands sup￾porting populations of from several hundred to a few thousand individ￾uals each. These groups are in an area of the sea that is well stocked with 
sea animal life, and during the past they have been sufficiently isolated 
to provide protection. The racial stocks have retained their identities 
and include Papuans, New Guineans, Mobuiags, Arakuns, Kendals and 
Yonkas. The splendid dental arches of these groups will be seen in the 
various illustrations. Many of the girls are quite prepossessing, as may 
be seen in Fig. 61. 
With the valuable assistance of the officials of the Australian Govern. 
ment we were able to make investigations on several islands in the 
Torres Strait. The local administrator provided us with a government 
boat and personal introductions to the local chief and local representa￾tives of the government. We were accompanied by the administrator and 
by the general manager of the government stores. These stores have been

located on the various islands, and the profit derived from them is used 
for administrative expenses of the government. They provide modern 
clothing in addition to foods, chiefly white flour, polished rice, canned 
goods, and sugar. Studies were made on the various islands in the order 
in which the stores had been installed on them. It is important to have 
in mind the nature of these islands. Some are of volcanic origin and have 
rugged interiors with deep bays; others are of coral origin. All are in 
a zone that is abundantly supplied with sea animal life, this being the 
scene of the richest pearl fishing industry in the world. 
Badu Island had had the store for the longest period, namely twenty￾three years. Of the 586 teeth of twenty individuals examined, 20.6 per 
cent had been attacked by tooth decay. Of the individuals examined 95 
per cent had dental caries. Unfortunately, our stay at this island was 
accompanied by a torrential downpour which made it very difficult for 
us to carry forward our investigations. Had we been able to examine 
the mothers the figures doubtless would have been much higher. The 
children were examined at the school and showed 18.8 per cent of the 
teeth to have been attacked by tooth decay. The men examined showed 
21.9 per cent. Figures given me by Dr. Gibson, who had been taken by 
the government to the island to make extractions, showed that he found 
as high as 60 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by tooth decay. For 
the children of this group, 33.3 per cent had abnormal dental arches, 
whereas only 9.1 per cent of the adults’ arches were abnormally formed. 
On York Island, 1,876 teeth of sixty-five individuals showed that 
12.7 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. For the women, this 
was 20.2 per cent; for the men, 12.1 per cent; and for the children, 7 
per cent. For the children, 47.1 per cent had abnormal dental arches; 
for the adults, 27 per cent were affected. The individuals on this island 
had been in contact with the pearl fisheries industry for several years. 
Several of the men had been working on the fishing boat. Of the sixty￾five individuals examined, 67.6 per cent had dental caries. 
On Darnley Island, thirty-three individuals showed that of their 900 
teeth 5.7 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. The store had been 
established on this island recently. For the women, 16.6 per cent of the 
teeth had been attacked; for the men, 6.3 per cent; and for the children, 
4.1 per cent. On this island, 29.6 per cent of the children showed ab￾normal dental arches, and 14.3 per cent of the adults. Of the whole 
group, 46.1 per cent had been attacked by dental caries. 
On Murray Island where a store had recently been established, of the 
1,074 teeth examined for 39 individuals, only 0.7 per cent of the teeth 
had been attacked by tooth decay. For the women, this amounted to 2 1909 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
per cent; for the men, 1.7 per cent; and for the children, 0.26 per cent. 
Only 12.8 per cent of the group had dental caries. It is significant that 
the natives were conscious of a danger from the presence on the island 
of a store providing imported foods. This had been so serious a problem 
that there was a question whether it would be safe for us to land, since 
on the last visit of the government officials, blood was almost shed 
because of the opposition of the natives to the government’s program. 
The result of our examination indicates that dental caries on these islands 
shows an incidence which has an apparent direct relationship to the 
length of time government stores have been established there. The 
immunity to dental caries on this island is nearly 100 per cent. Of the 
adults, 14.3 per cent had abnormal dental arches, and of the children, 
34.4 per cent. 
Thursday Island is the location of the administrative center for the 
group. Although it is the best sheltered harbor and affords protection 
for small boats in the Torres Strait, it was not originally inhabited by 
the natives. They considered it unfit for habitation because the soil was 
so poor that it could not provide the proper plant foods to be eaten with 
the sea foods which are abundant about all of the islands. Nearly all of 
the whites inhabiting the islands of this district live on this island. They 
are the families of the administrative officers and of merchants who are 
engaged in the pearl industry. Owing to the infertility of the soil, prac￾tically all of the food has to be shipped in except the little that the 
whites obtain from the sea. On the island there were many native 
families, with children attending the native school, while their fathers 
worked in the pearling fleets. Thirty individuals in three fleets were 
examined, and of their 960 teeth only thirty-five had been attacked by 
dental caries, or 3.6 per cent. Of these thirty individuals, five, or 16.3 
per cent had abnormal dental arches. The men who had teeth attacked 
by dental caries informed me that this had happened after they had 
engaged on the pearling vessels and began to use the foods provided 
there. In the native school on Thursday Island twenty-three children 
were examined. They were living in homes in which a considerable part 
of the food was purchased at the company stores. The incidence of 
tooth decay was 12.2 per cent of their 664 teeth. Many of these Thurs￾day Island children had been born since their parents had begun using 
the commercial foods provided to the islanders. Among twenty-three 
individuals, 43.5 per cent had abnormal dental arches. 
While these investigations were planned and carried out primarily to obtain data on the condition of the native races in contact with modern white civilization, wherever possible, data were obtained on the whites TORRES STRAIT ISLANDERS 191

r1G. 62. School children from the two groups on Thursday Island. Note the beautifully

also. In a school for whites on Thursday Island, fifty children were ex￾amined with regard to their dental arches, but an embarrassing situation 
was encountered with regard to the sensitiveness of the whites in the 
matter of having their children examined for dental caries. Figures 
were obtained for the facial development which reveal that, out of 
the fifty children examined, 64 per cent had irregularities of facial and 
dental arch development. In the upper half of Fig. 62, will be seen a 
group of children photographed in the native school, and in the lower a 
group of white girls photographed at the white school. The difference in 
their facial development is readily seen. The son of the white teacher 
(Fig. 66, left) had marked under development of his face. The white 
population lived largely on canned food. 
Hammond Island adjoins Thursday Island sufficiently close by to be 
easily reached in small boats. Accordingly, the people of this island have 
access to the stores of the white settlement on Thursday Island. Unlike 
Thursday Island, Hammond Island is quite fertile. Of twenty-seven 
individuals, all of native stock, 16.5 per cent of their 732 teeth had 
been attacked by dental caries, and 40 per cent of the individuals showed 
some deformity of the dental arches. After examining the children at 
the mission school, I inquired whether there were not families on the 
island that were living entirely isolated from contact with modern in￾fluences. I was taken to the far side of the island to an isolated family. 
This family had continued to live on their own resources. They were 
raising vegetables including bananas, pumpkins, and pawpaws. In the 
cases of the three girls in the family, one with a child five months of age, 
only six of their eighty-four teeth had been attacked by tooth decay, 
or 7.1 per cent, as compared with 16.5 per cent for the entire group 
on this island. These three girls all had normally developed dental 
arches and normal features. Three of the girls are shown in Fig. 63. 
We inquired about the mother and were told that she was out fishing, 
notwithstanding the fact that the sea was quite rough. While we were 
there, she came in with two fish (Fig. 63). Here was one of the prin￾cipal secrets of their happiness and success in life. The Catholic priest 
who had charge of the mission on this island told me that this family 
practically never asked for assistance of any kind, and was always in 
a position to help others. They were happy and well nourished. It is 
important to note that the progressive degeneration in facial form which 
occurred in many of the families on the other islands was not found 
in this family. 
The incidence of dental caries ranged from 20.6 per cent of all of 
the teeth examined for the various age groups on Badu Island to 0.7 194 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
per cent, on Murray Island. A group of individuals from this 
island will be seen in Fig. 64. Note the remarkable width of the dental 
arches. Note also in this connection that the natives of this island are 
conscious of the superior food of their locality and wish that their 
people were not required to purchase food from the government store. 
The island is situated on the Barrier Reef and has an abundant supply 
of small fish. The swarms of fish are often so dense that the natives 
throw a spear with several prongs into the school of fish and when the 
spear is drawn back, there are several fish on it. This condition pro￾vides abundant food for sharks many of which could be seen surround￾ing the schools of small fish. Encircling the group, they dashed in, 
mouths open and gorged themselves with the mass of fish from the 
water. It seemed quite remarkable that the people were willing to go 
into the water to spear the fish within the zone frequently approached 
by the sharks, but I was told by the natives that when the fish are so 
abundant the sharks never attack human beings. One of the natives 
rowed me in his canoe to a point where I could photograph the sharks 
at close range. To show his disdain for the shark, he had no hesitancy 
in standing up in the end of the canoe and hurling his spear into the 
side of the monster. The spear was immediately thrown out by the 
shark, which had not been frightened sufficiently to make it leave the 
scene of action. The sharks in my pictures were swimming so close to 
the shore that the upper part of the tail was forced out of the water, also 
the back fin, in order to clear the bottom. It was a great revelation 
to watch the movement of the tail. Instead of swinging it from side to 
side like other fish, with which I was familiar, the shark would rotate 
its tail half or three quarters of a turn in a motion like that of a pro￾peller of a boat, then reverse the motion for the return trip. By a sudden 
increase of speed in this motion, the shark could dart ahead at a rapid 
rate, corral the small fish by encircling them, and finally make a dash 
through the school with its mouth open. Hundreds of the small fish, 
in order to escape, dart out of the water into the air. This exposes them 
to the birds, a flock of which follows the sharks when they are feeding 
on the fish. The birds dive down at the time they see the shark making 
his raid and catch the small fish as they dart out of the water. It is 
by the birds of prey that the native fishermen from their lookout locate 
the schools of fish. While there is a difference of opinion as to whether 
some species of shark will attack human beings, we saw one pearl diver 
who bore enormous scars received from the jaws of a shark. 
The procedure on one island is to snare the sharks by calling them 
by means of special sounds made by clapping together two large half TORRES STRAIT ISLANDERS 195

a high degree of excellence. 196 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
shells on the surface of the water. This attracts the shark, and then 
the men one at a time go into the water with a sharp stick with which 
they guard themselves against attack. A noose made of rope of coconut 
fiber is slipped over the shark’s head and over the back fin. It is then 
allowed to tire out and is brought to shore. It was not unusual in a 
good season for the shark fishers to bring in three or four in a night’s 
fishing. The strength of the native swimmers is almost beyond belief. 
The pearling boats are frequently in great danger of being dashed to 
pieces on a coral reef, since in those waters gales of fifty miles an hour 
are frequent. We experienced some such gales. On one occasion, when 
a pearling boat was wrecked some distance from an exposed rock, one 
strong swimmer rescued and helped two dozen of the crew to the rock, 
and was himself rescued after being in the water continuously for 
thirty-two hours. The pearling boats feed their crew largely on com￾mercial provisions. When the men have been continuously on the boats 
for one or two years, or often when they have been at sea using this 
food for six months, they have rampant tooth decay. When the cavi￾ties approach or reach the pulp chambers the pain produced in the teeth 
by the high pressure in deep water produces such agony that they often 
have to give up pearling. 
Physical characteristics of all these residents of the Torres Strait 
Islands, regardless of their tribal group, were, sturdy development 
throughout their bodies, broad dental arches, and for all of those who 
had always lived only on their native food, a close proximity to one 
hundred per cent immunity to dental caries. These men are natural 
mariners. They do not hesitate to make long trips even in rough seas 
in their homemade crafts. They have an uncanny skill in determining 
the location of invisible coral reefs. They relate the height of the swell 
as it rolls over the reef to particular color tones in the water, all of 
which were too vague for me to see even when they were pointed out. 
Among the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands, almost all indi￾viduals who had been born before the foods of modern civilization had 
become available were found to have dental arches normal in form. In 
many families, however, living on islands where a store had been estab￾lished for some time, and on Thursday Island where imported foods 
had been available for several decades, many individuals were found who had been born since the use of imported foods. They had gross deformities of the dental arches.

We are particularly concerned with data that will throw light on 
the nature of the forces responsible for the production of these de￾formities. Since they do not appear to their full extent until the erup￾tion of the permanent teeth as part of the development of the adult, 
it is easy for the abnormality to be ascribed to the period of child 
growth. As a result, it has been related to faulty breathing habits, 
thumb sucking, posture, or sleeping habits, of the child. 
It would be difficult to find a more happy and contented people than 
the primitives in the Torres Strait Islands as they lived without contact 
with modern civilization. Indeed, they seem to resent very acutely the 
modern intrusion. They not only have nearly perfect bodies, but an 
associated personality and character of a high degree of excellence. One 
is continually impressed with happiness, peace and health while in their 
congenial presence. 
These people are not lazy, but they donot struggle over hard to

in rampant tooth decay. They are in pathetic contrast with the superb unspoiled natives. 
They are within reach of some of the best foods to be found anywhere in the world 
and yet do not use them; a typical characteristic of modern whites. 200 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
In their native state they have exceedingly little disease. Dr. J. R. 
Nimmo, the government physician in charge of the supervision of this 
group, told me in his thirteen years with them he had not seen a single 
case of malignancy, and had seen only one that he had suspected might 
be malignancy among the entire four thousand native population. He 
stated that during this same period he had operated several dozen ma￾lignancies for the white population, which numbers about three hun￾dred. He reported that among the primitive stock other affections 
requiring surgical interference were rare. 
The environment of the Torres Strait Islanders provides a very lib￾eral supply of sea foods and fertile islands on which an adequate quan￾tity of tropical plants are readily grown. Taro, bananas, papaya, and 
plums are all grown abundantly. The sea foods include large and small 
fish in great abundance, dugong, and a great variety of shellfish. These 
foods have developed for them remarkable physiques with practically 
complete immunity to dental caries. Wherever they have adopted the 
white man’s foods, however, they suffer the typical expressions of de￾generation, such as, loss of immunity to dental caries; and in the suc￾ceeding generations there is a marked change in facial and dental arch 
form with marked lowering of resistance to disease. Chapter 12 
ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED NEW ZEALAND MAORI 
Be of the fine reputation of the racial stock in its primitive 
condition, it was with particular interest that studies were made 
in New Zealand. Pickerill' has made a very extensive study of the New 
Zealand Maori, both by examination of the skulls and by examination of 
the relatively primitive living Maori. He states: 
In an examination of 250 Maori skulls—all from an uncivilized age—I found 
carious teeth present in only two skulls or 0.76 per cent. By taking the average 
of Mummery’s and my own investigations, the incidence of caries in the Maori 
is found to be 1.2 per cent in a total of 326 skulls. This is lower even than the 
Esquimaux, and shows the Maori to have been the most immune race to caries, 
for which statistics are available. 
Comparing these figures with those applicable to the present time, we find 
that the descendants of the Britons and Anglo-Saxons are afflicted with dental 
caries to the extent of 86 per cent to 98 per cent; and after examining fifty 
Maori school children living under European conditions entirely, I found that 
95 per cent of them had decayed teeth. 
It will be noted that the basis of computation in the above is per￾centage of individuals with caries. I am using in addition to these fig￾ures the percentage of teeth attacked by dental caries. Expressed in per￾centage of teeth affected the figure for Pickerill’s group would be 0.05 
or 1 in 2,000 teeth. 
We were deeply indebted to the government officials in New Zealand 
for their invaluable assistance. In anticipation of making these studies 
I had been in correspondence with the officials for over two years. When 
we arrived at Auckland, New Zealand, on our way to Australia, our 
ship was in port for one day. We were met by Colonel Saunders, Di￾rector of Oral Hygiene in the New Zealand Department of Public 
Health who had been sent from the capitol at Wellington to offer 
assistance. A personal representative of the Government was sent as 
guide, and transportation to the various Maori settlements in which 
we wished to make our studies was provided. 
New Zealand is setting a standard for the world in the care of grow￾ing children as well as in many other health problems. A large per￾201 202 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
centage of the schools in New Zealand are provided with dental service. 
A specially trained woman was in charge of the work in each school 
under Colonel Saunders’ supervision. The operations performed by these

young women on children far exceeded in quality the average that | 
have seen by dentists in America. Their plan gives dental care to chil￾dren twelve years of age and under, provided the parents express a 
wish that their children receive that care. The service was being ex￾tended rapidly to all communities. Since my return, I have learned 
that the work is being organized to provide for every community of 
New Zealand. The art of the Maori gives evidence of their great ability 
and skill in sculpturing. Boys and girls do beautiful carving and weay￾ing. All native buildings and structures are embellished with carvings 
often in fine detail. 
It was most gratifying to find neat and well-appointed dental office 
buildings for both natives and whites, located beside a large number 
of the public schools throughout New Zealand. In many communities 
two or three schools were served by the same operator. Children were 
either brought to the central dental infirmary or provision was made 
for an operating room in the vicinity of each school. The operator went from district to district. A typical dental infirmary is shown in Fig. 68, « DISTRICTS

with Colonel Saunders and one of his efficient women operators in the 
foreground. I had suggested that I should be glad to have observers 
from the Department of Health accompany us or arrange to be present 
at convenient places to observe the conditions and to note my inter￾pretations of them. From two to five such observers were generally 
present, including the official representative of the department. The p!an￾ning of the itinerary was very greatly assisted by a Maori member of 
Parliament, Mr. Aparana Ngata. 
Although New Zealand is a new country with a relatively small 
population, there being approximately only a million and a half indi￾viduals, the building of highways has rapidly been extended to include 
all modernized sections. In order to reach the most remote groups it 
was often necessary to go beyond the zone of public improvements and 
follow quite primitive trails. Fortunately this was possible because it 
was the dry season. Even then many streams had to be forded, which 
would have been quite impossible at other seasons of the year. We were 
able to average approximately a hundred miles of travel per day for 
eighteen days, visiting twenty-five districts and making examinations 
of native Maori families and children in native schools, representing 
various stages of modernization. This included a few white schools and 
tubercular sanitariums. 
Since over 95 per cent of the New Zealanders are to be found in the 
North Island, our investigations were limited to this island. Our itin￾erary started at Wellington at the south end of the North Island and 
progressed northward in such a way as to reach both the principal cen￾ters of native population who were modernized and those who were 
more isolated. This latter group, however, was a small part of the total 
native population. Detailed examinations including measurements and 
photographic records were made in twenty-two groups consisting chiefly 
of the older children in public schools. In the examination of 535 indi￾viduals in these twenty-two school districts their 15,332 teeth revealed 
that 3,420 had been attacked by dental caries or 22.3 per cent. In the 
most modernized groups 31 to 50 per cent had dental caries. In the 
most isolated group only 2 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by 
dental caries. The incidence of deformity of dental arches in the mod￾ernized groups ranged from 40 to 100 per cent. In many districts mem￾bers of the older generations revealed 100 per cent normally formed 
dental arches. The children of these individuals, however, showed a 
much higher percentage of deformed dental arches. 
These data are in striking contrast with the condition of the teeth 206 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
and dental arches of the skulls of the Maori before contact with the 
white man and the reports of examinations by early scientists who made 
contact with the primitive Maori before he was modernized. These re￾ports revealed only one tooth in 2000 teeth attacked by dental caries 
with practically 100 per cent normally formed dental arches. 
My investigations were made in the following places in the North 
Island. The Pukerora Tubercular Sanatorium provided forty native 
Maori for studies. These were largely young men and women and being 
in a modern institution they were receiving the modern foods of the 
whites of New Zealand. Their modernization was demonstrated not 
only by the high incidence of dental caries but also by the fact that 
90 per cent of the adults and 100 per cent of the children had abnor￾malities of the dental arches. 
The Hukarera College for Maori girls is at Napier. These girls were 
largely from modernized native homes and were now living in a mod￾ern institution. Their modernization was expressed in the high percent￾age of dental caries and their deformed dental arches. 
At the Nuhaka school an opportunity was provided through the 
assistance of the government officials to study the parents of many of 
the children. Tooth decay was wide-spread among the women and active 
among both the men and children. 
The Mahia Peninsula provided one of the more isolated groups which 
showed a marked difference between the older generation and the new. 
These people had good access to sea foods and those still using these 
abundantly had much the best teeth. A group of the children who had 
been born and raised in this district and who had lived largely on the 
native foods had only 1.7 per cent of their teeth attacked by dental 
caries. 
The other places studied were Raukokore, Tekaha, Rautoki, Rotarua, 
Tehoro, Waiomio, Teahuahu, Kaikohe, Whakarara, Mautauri Bay, Ahi￾para, Manukau, Rawena, Ellerslie, Queen Victoria School at Auckland 
and Waipawa. 
New Zealand has become justly famous for its scenery. The South 
Island has been frequently termed the Southern Alps because of its 
snow-capped mountains and glaciers. Of the 70,000 members of the 
Maori race living in the two islands, about 2000 are on the South 
Island and the balance on the North Island. While snow is present on many of the mountains of the North Island in the winter season, only 
a few of the higher peaks are snow capped during the summer. Most of the shoreline of the seacoast of the South Island is very rugged, with NEW ZEALAND MAORI 207 
Fic. 69, Since the discovery of New Zealand the primitive natives, the Maori, have had 
the reputation of having the finest teeth and finest bodies of any race in the world. These 
faces are typical. Only about one tooth per thousand teeth had been attacked by tooth decay 
before they came under the influence of the white man. 208 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Fic. 70. With the advent of the white man in New Zealand tooth decay has become 
rampant. The suffering from dental caries and abscessed teeth is very great in the most 
modernized Maori. The boy at the lower left has a deep scar in his upper lip from an

glaciers descending almost to the sea. The coastline of the North Island is broken and in places is quite rugged. The approach to the Mahia Peninsula is along a rocky coast skirting the bay. The most important 
industries of New Zealand are dairy products, and sheep raising for 
wool. 
The reputation of the Maori people for splendid physiques has placed 
them on a pedestal of perfection. Much of this has been lost in modern￾ization. However, through the assistance of the government, I was able 
to see many excellent physical specimens. In Fig. 69 will be seen four 
typical Maori who retained much of the tribal excellence. Note their 
fine dental arches. A young Maori man who stands about six feet four 
inches and weighs 230 pounds was examined. The Maori men have 
great physical endurance and good minds. Many fine lawyers and gov￾ernment executives are Maori. The breakdown of these people comes 
when they depart from their native foods to the foods of modern civ￾ilization, foods consisting largely of white flour, sweetened goods, syrup 
and canned goods. The effect is similar to that experienced by other 
races after using foods of modern civilization. Typical illustrations of 
tooth decay are shown in Fig. 70. In some individuals still in their teens 
half of the teeth were decayed. The tooth decay among the whites of 
New Zealand and Australia was severe. This is illustrated in Fig. 71. 
Particularly striking is the similarity between the deformities of the 
dental arches which occur in the Maori people who were born after 
their parents adopted the modern foods, and those of the whites. This 
is well illustrated in Fig. 72 for Maori boys. In my studies among other 
modernized primitive racial stocks, there was a very high incidence of 
facial deformity, which approached one hundred per cent among indi￾viduals in tuberculosis sanatoria. This condition obtained also in New 
Zealand. 
Through the kindness of the director of the Maori Museum at Auck￾land, I was able to examine many Maori skulls. Two views are shown 
in Fig. 73. The skulls belong in the pre-Columbian period. Note the 
splendid design of the face and dental arches and high perfection of 
the teeth. 
One of the most important developments to come out of these in￾vestigations of primitive races is the evidence of a rapid decline in ma￾ternal reproductive efficiency after an abandonment of the native foods 
and the substitution of foods of modern civilization. This is discussed 
in later chapters. 
It was particularly instructive to observe the diligence with which 
some of the isolated Maori near the coast sought out certain types of 210 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

food in accordance with the tradition and accumulated wisdom of their 
tribes. As among the various archipelagos and island dwellers of the 
Pacific, great emphasis was placed upon shell fish. Much effort was 
made to obtain these in large quantities. In Fig. 74 (lower), will be seen 
two boys who have been gathering sea clams found abundantly on these 
shores, Much of the fishing is done when the tide is out. Some groups 
used large quantities of the species called abalone on the West Coast of 
America and paua in New Zealand. In Fig. 74 (upper), a man, his 
wife and child are shown. The father is holding an abalone; the little 
girl is holding a mollusk found only in New Zealand, the toharoa; the 
mother is holding a plate of edible kelp which these people use abun￾dantly, as do many sea bordering races. Maori boys enjoy a species of 
grubs which they seek with great eagerness and prize highly. The prim￾itive Maori use large quantities of fern root which grows abundantly 
and is very nutritious. 
Probably few primitive races have developed calisthenics and sys￾tematic physical exercise to so high a point as the primitive Maori. On 
arising early in the morning, the chief of the village starts singing a 
song which is accompanied by a rhythmic dance. This is taken up not 
only by the members of his household, but by all in the adjoining house￾holds until the entire village is swaying in unison to the same tempo 
This has a remarkably beneficial effect in not only developing deep 
breathing, but in developing the muscles of the body, particularly those 
of the abdomen, with the result that these people maintain excellent 
figures to old age. 
Sir Arbuthnot Lane? said of this practice the following: 
As to daily exercise, it is shown here that every person capable of movement 
can benefit by it, and I am certain that the only natural and really beneficial 
system of exercise is that developed through long ages by the New Zealand 
Maori and their race-brothers in other lands. 
The practical application of their wisdom is discussed in Chapter 21. 
The Maori race developed a knowledge of Nature’s laws and adopted 
a system of living in harmony with those laws to so high a degree that 
they were able to build what was reported by early scientists to be the 
most physically perfect race living on the face of the earth. They ac￾complished this largely through diet and a system of social organiza￾tion designed to provide a high degree of perfection in their offspring. To do this they utilized foods from the sea very liberally. The fact that they were able to maintain an immunity to dental caries so high that only one tooth in two thousand had been attacked by tooth decay NEW ZEALAND MAORI 215 
(which is probably as high a degree of immunity as that of any con￾temporary race) is a strong argument in favor of their plan of life.

ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF PERU 
N THE foregoing field studies among primitive races we have been 
dealing chiefly with living groups. Since the West Coast of South 
America has been the home of several ancient cultures, it is important 
that they be included with the living remnants of primitive racial 
stocks, in order to note the contributions that they may make to the 
problem of modern degeneration. The relationship between the Andes 
Mountain Range and the coast and the sea currents is such that there 
has been created a zone, ranging from forty to one hundred miles in 
width between the coast and the mountains, which for a distance of 
over a thousand miles is completely arid. The air currents drifting west￾ward across South America from the Atlantic carry an abundance of 
moisture. When they strike the eastern foothills of the Andes they are 
projected upward into a region of constant cold which causes the 
moisture to be precipitated as rain on the eastern slopes, and as snow 
on the eastern Cordillera Range. Hence the name of the eastern range 
is the White Cordillera, and that of the western range, which receives 
little of this rain, is the Black Cordillera. Between these two ranges is a 
great plain, which in the rainy season is well watered. The great civiliza￾tions of the past have always utilized water from the melting snow 
through irrigation ditches with the result that a vast acreage was put to 
agricultural uses. 
The Humboldt Current which sweeps northward from the southern 
ice fields and carries its chilly water almost to the equator has influenced 
the development of the West Coast of South America. The effect of 
the current on the climate is generally noticeable. One of the conspicu￾ous results is the presence of a cloud bank which hovers over the coastal 
area at an altitude of from one thousand to three thousand feet above 
sea level for several months of the year. Back from the coast these 
clouds rest on the land and constitute a nearly constant fog for extended 
periods. When one passes inland from the coast up the mountains he 
moves from a zone which in winter is clammy and chilly, into the fog 
zone, and then suddenly out of it into clear sky and brilliant sunlight. 
It is of interest that the capital, Lima, is so situated that it suffers from 
217 218 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
this unhappy cloud and fog situation. When Pizarro sent a commission 
to search out a location for his capital city the natives commented on 
the fact that he was selecting a very undesirable location. Either on the 
coast or farther inland than Lima the climate is much more favorable, 
and these were the locations in which the ancient civilizations have left 
some very elaborate foundations of fortresses and extended residential 
areas. The great expanse of desert extending from the coast to the moun￾tains, with its great moving sand dunes and with scarcely a sign of green 
life, is one of the least hospitable environments that any culture could 
choose. Notwithstanding this, the entire coast is a succession of ancient 
burial mounds in which it is estimated that there are fifteen million 
mummies in an excellent state of preservation. The few hundred thou￾sand that have been disturbed by grave robbers in search of gold and 
silver, have been left bleaching on the sands. Where had these people 
come from and why were they buried here? The answer is to be found 
in the fact that probably few locations in the world provided such an 
inexhaustible supply of food for producing a good culture as did this 
area. The lack of present appreciation of this fact is evidenced by the 
absence of flourishing modern communities, notwithstanding the almost 
continuous chain of ancient walls, fortresses, habitations, and irrigation 
systems to be found along this coast. The Humboldt Current coming 
from the ice fields of the Antarctic carries with it a prodigious quantity 
of the chemical food elements that are most effective in the production 
of a vast population of fish. Probably no place in the world provides as 
great an area teeming with marine life. The ancient cultures appreciated 
the value of these sea foods and utilized them to the full. They realized 
also that certain land plants should be eaten with the sea foods. Ac￾cordingly, they constructed great aqueducts used in transporting the 
water, sometimes a hundred miles, for the purpose of irrigating river 
bottoms which had been collecting the alluvial soil from the Andes 
through past ages. These river beds are to be found from twenty to 
fifty miles apart and many of them are entirely dry except in the rainy 
season in the high Andes. In the river bottoms these ancient cultures 
grew large quantities of corn, beans, squash, and other plants. These 
plant foods were gathered, stored, and eaten with sea foods. The people 
on the coast had direct communication with the people in the high 
plateaus. It is of more than passing interest that some twenty-one of our 
modern food plants apparently came from Peru. 
Where there is such a quantity of animal life in the sea in the form of fish one would expect to find the predatory animals that live on fish. One group of these attack the fish from the air and they constitute the ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF PERU 219 
great flock of guanayes, piqueros and pelicans, For a thousand miles 
along the coast, these fish-eating birds are to be seen in great winding 
queues going to and tro between the fishing grounds and their nesting 
places, At other times they may be seen in wreat clouds, beyond compu 
(ition ia number, fishing over an area of many square miles. On one 
island Twas told by the caretaker that twenty-four million birds had 
their nests there, We passed through a flock of the birds fishing, which 
the caretaker estimated to contain between four and five million birds. 
On one hind [found it impossible to step anywhere, off the path, 
without (reading on birds’ nests, Le is of interest that a product of these 
birds has constituted one of the Mreatest sources of wealth in the past 
for Peru, namely, the guano, which is the droppings of the birds left 
on the ishinds along the coast where they have their nests. Through 
the centuries these deposits have reached to a depth of 100 feet in places. 
When it is realized that only one-fifth of the droppings are placed on 
the islands, it immediately raises the great question as to the quantity 
of fish consumed by these birds, As high as seventy-five fish have been 
found in the digestive tract of a single bird. The quantity of fish con￾sumed per day by the birds nesting on this one island has been estimated 
to be greater than the entire catch of fish off the New England coast 
per day, 
In addition to the birds, a vast number of sea lions and seals live on 
the fish, The sea lions have a rookery in the vicinity of Santa Island, 
which was estimated to contain over a million, These enormous animals 
devour great quantities of fish. It would be difhcult to estimate how 
far the fish destroyed by this one group of sea lions would go toward 
providing excellent nutrition for the entire population of the United 
States. The guano, consisting of the partially digested animal life of 
the sea, constitutes what is probably the bese known fertilizer in the 
world, It is thirty-three times as efheient as the best barnyard manure. 
At one time it was sent in shiploads to Europe and the United States, 
but now the Peruvian Government is retaining nearly all of it for local 
use. They have locked the barn door after the horse was stolen, figura￾tively speaking, since the accumulation of ages had been carried off by 
shiploads to other countries before its export was checked. At the present 
time all islands are under guard and the birds are protected. They are 
coming back into many of the islands from which they had been driven 
and are re-nesting. Birds are given two or three years of undisturbed 
life for producing deposits. ‘These are then carefully removed from the 
surface of the islands and the birds are allowed to remain undisturbed 
for another period. 220 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
A very important and fortunate phase of the culture of the primitive 
races of the coast has been their method of burial. Bodies are carefully 
wrapped in many. layers of raiment often beautifully spun. With the 
mummies articles of special interest and value are usually buried. Imple￾ments used by the individuals in their lifetime were also put in the 
grave. With a fisherman there were placed his nets and fishing tackle. 
Almost alwavs, jars containing foods to supply him on his journey in 
the transition to a future life were left in the tomb. In some of the 
cultures the various domestic and industrial scenes were reproduced in 
pottery. These disclosed a great variety of foods which are familiar to 
us today. Even the designs of their habitations were reproduced in pot￾tery. Similarly their methods of performing surgical operations, in which 
they were very skillful, were depicted. Fortunately, the different cul￾tures had quite different types of pottery as well as quite different types 
of clothing. This makes it possible to identify various groups and indi￾cate the boundaries of their habitations. 
Their engineering feats disclosed skill in planning fortresses. Their 
forts were probably impregnable from assault in that day. The ma￾terials used for building their temples, abodes, and fortifications differ 
somewhat in various locations. Throughout the greater extent of the 
coast of Peru, the walls of buildings were made of adobe often many 
feet thick and sometimes sixty feet high. They had walled cities pro￾tected by inner and outer lines of fortifications. It is particularly sig￾nificant that the hardest metals that they are known to have had were 
copper and bronze. Silver and gold were quite plentiful. Their surgical 
instruments were flints and the operations that they were able to per￾form with these instruments were very remarkable. An important in￾strument in warfare consisted of a club with a star on the end made 
of copper or stone. With this the opponent’s skull was crushed in. One of 
the amazing features in the various collections of skulls is the large 
number that show the results of surgical operations. These operations 
were apparently done for the purpose of saving the life of the indi￾vidual. The procedure was to remove a section of bone in the center 
of the depressed area and raise the depressed edges surrounding that 
area. The fact that a large number of these show abundant evidence of 
healing and repair clearly indicates that the individual lived for an ex￾tended period following the operation. In some cases, the opening is 
apparently entirely closed in with new bone. Some of these trepanning 
operations removed a quantity of bone over an area large enough for 
a human hand to pass through. A group of these operated skulls are shown in Fig. 75. The owner of the one on the lower row, left, prob- ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF PERU 221 
Fic. 75. Trephined skulls of the ancient peoples of Peru. Their war weapons were de￾signed to produce skull fractures. Their surgeons trephined the skulls, thus removing 
the depressed area. The large percentage of operated skulls showing extensive healing indi￾cates a large percentage lived for months and years afterwards. Their surgical flesh cutting 
knives were made of copper and bronze, the bone cutting of mounted crystals. They used 
cocoa leaves (cocaine) as a sedative as the natives do today. 222 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
ably died following the operation, as there is no evidence of repair. 
The others show good healing, which in some is very extensive. A study 
of these trephined skulls reveals that 62 per cent lived for months or 
years. In Fig. 75 (lower right), is seen a skull which shows a large 
operation. A part of the surgical procedure was to place a plate of gold 
over the opening in the skull for protection. One of these is shown in 
the upper half of Fig. 76. Below is shown the healed scar after removal 
of the gold plate. 
The skill of the surgeons in amputations is illustrated by the pottery 
reproductions of amputated parts. One of these, for example, shows a 
man with an amputated foot holding the stump of his leg with one 
hand while putting on a sock over the end of the stump with the other 
hand. The technic of amputation is shown in pottery form in Fig. 77. 
A serious disease of the foot is suggested, requiring amputation of the 
leg, high up. Note how the thigh bone was cut so as to provide a flesh￾covered stump. Below in Fig. 77 is shown a healed oblique fracture with 
good adaptation. 
When the Spaniards arrived to carry forward the conquest of Peru 
they found the entire coastal area and upper plateaus under the control 
of a culture organized under the Inca rulers. Prior to the domination 
of that culture, which had its origin in the high plateau country, sey￾eral other cultures had developed along the coast in succeeding eras of 
domination. In northern Peru the Chimus developed a great culture that 
extended over a long period of time. Their capital city was at Chan 
Chan, inland from the present coastal port of Saliverry and near Tru￾jillo. This city is estimated to have contained a million people. The argu￾ment is sometimes presented that at the time these ancient cultures 
lived the coastal areas were not arid desert but well supplied with rain. 
That this was not so is clearly evidenced by the fact that the walls were 
built of stucco made by mixing water with the available sand and rubble 
either in continuous molds or in blocks that were built into the fort. 
Since these blocks were only sun-dried they had very little resistance 
to rain. In this rainless desert land they have continued to stand through 
many centuries, many of them probably through several thousand 
years. There has been a vast change in the walls of the ruined city of 
Chan Chan within a decade and a half. 
In 1925 this district was visited by a heavy downpour of rain which 
apparently exceeded any precipitation, not only through historic times, 
but for many centuries preceding. Temples, courtyards and military 
defenses which were in splendid preservation before that downpour were 
reduced to a mere semblance of their former structure. Clearly these ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF PERU 223

great cities and their defenses could not have been built of this mate￾rial in the period when downpours were even occasional, let alone 
requent. 
It was, of course, the wealth of the ancient cultures that spurred on 
the conquistadors. It is very difficult to estimate the per capita quantity 
of gold available in those early cultures. That gold and silver were 
abundant is evidenced by the extensive use that was made of these 
metals for covering the walls of rooms and decorating public buildings 
with massive plates, sometimes entirely encircling a building and the 
walls of its various rooms. A considerable quantity of gold and silver 
has been taken from the burial mounds. One burial mound is reported 
to have yielded between six and seven million dollars worth of gold. 
So great has been the activity of the grave robbers that the Peruvian 
Government has placed a ban on this enterprise though for a period it 
was allowed on condition that a stated percentage was given to the 
Government. 
One of the principal characteristics of the Chimu culture of the coastal 
area of northern Peru is shown in the type of pottery they produced. 
All articles were realistic in design. The pots show hunting scenes, fish￾ing and domestic scenes, as illustrated above. They were very skillful in 
reproducing features in nearly natural size. Many thousands of these 
portrait jars have been taken from the mounds of this district. The local 
museum in the vicinity of Chan Chan, under the skillful direction of 
Mr. Larco Herrera at Chiclyan was reported to contain over twenty 
thousand jars and specimens taken from the mounds. 
To the south of the domain of the Chimu culture, a very strong cul￾ture was built up with very different characteristics known as the 
Naska. While many of their habits of life, including their methods of 
providing food, were similar to those of the Chimu culture, they were 
unique in the designs of their pottery, which were characterized by 
being allegorical. They used elaborate color designs and fantastic pat￾terns. Very little is known as yet of the meaning of much that they 
have left. While sundials of ancient design and build have been found 
in many parts of Peru, it is not known to what extent they developed 
a knowledge of astronomy. The pilot of the plane that flew us from 
Lima to Arequipa took us over some very strange architectural designs 
of geometrical patterns which he had discovered and which he sug￾gested had not been reported upon nor interpreted. I photographed 
some of these from the air. The straight lines constituting the sides of 
some of the geometric figures are over a thousand feet long and reveal 
a precision of the angles and a straightness of the ground structures 226 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
which indicate the use of competent engineering equipment and a high 
knowledge of surveying. 
One of the principal purposes of my trip to Peru was to study the 
effect of the Humboldt Current, with its supply of human food, on 
the ancient cultures which were buried along the coast. In other parts 
of the world, where Nature had provided the sea with an abundance 
of sea life which was being utilized by native races, I found quite rou￾tinely excellent physical development with typical broad, well-developed 
facial forms and dental arches with normal contours. In each of these 
groups, the people have reproduced quite closely the racial type in prac￾tically all members of the group. I have emphasized with illustrations 
this fact in connection with the Melanesians and Polynesians on eight 
archipelagos of the Pacific Ocean, the Malay races on the islands north 
of Australia, the Aborigines of Australia along the east coast; also the 
Gaelics in the Outer Hebrides, and the Eskimos of Alaska. 
The activity of grave robbers in the ancient burial mounds has left 
skeletons strewn helter skelter where many of them have been weather￾ing, probably for years. While many of these had apparently been de￾liberately smashed, large numbers were intact, and in a good state of 
preservation. Some of the ancient cemeteries apparently extended over 
areas covering a square mile; and as far as the eye could see the white 
bleaching bones, particularly the skulls, dotted the landscape. Since 
there were several distinct cultures, I endeavored to make a cross section 
study of a number of these burial grounds in order that a fair average 
of specimens might be obtained. The skulls were handled by me, per￾sonally, and large numbers of them were photographed. As I have men￾tioned, it was the ancient custom when making the burials to inter 
objects that were of special interest to the individuals, including the im￾plements with which he had worked. Fishermen’s skulls are shown in Fig. 
78 with their nets. It will be noted that all these arches are broad and 
wide, that the third molars are well formed and almost always well 
developed, and in good masticating position. Notwithstanding the long 
period of interment the fabrics buried with these people were often 
in a remarkably good state of preservation. Even the hair was well pre￾served. A characteristic of the method of preparation for burial involved placing over the teeth a preparation that was held in position by a strip of cloth which cemented the teeth quite firmly to this strip with the result that when the mummy cases were torn open the removal of this bandage removed the straight rooted teeth, and therefore large numbers of the skulls that were bleaching on the sandy wastes were without the straight rooted teeth. Of course, these would readily tumble out ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF PERU v27 
Fic. 78. The two skulls in the upper photograph apparently belonged to fishermen of 
the Chimu culture as evidenced by the flattened back of the head. Note the splendidly 
formed dental arches. In an examination of one thousand two hundred and seventy-six 
skulls in succession I did not find one with the typical deformities of our moderns. 228 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
at the slightest jar, after the mummified tissues had decomposed from 
exposure. The teeth lost in this way would include practically all of the 
upper and lower incisors, some of the bicuspids and third molars. 
Since our study was primarily concerned with the shape of the dental 
arches and facial form, these characteristics could be studied and re￾corded with the straight rooted teeth removed. Fortunately, there are 
some excellent collections of skulls in museums in Peru, with the skulls 
in position where they can be readily studied for the shape of the dental 
arches. When we have in mind that from 25 to 75 per cent of indi￾viduals in various communities in the United States have a distinct 
irregularity in the development of the dental arches and facial form, 
the cause and significance of which constitutes one of the important 
problems of this study, the striking contrast found in these Peruvian 
skulls will be seen to constitute a challenge for our modern civilizations. 
In a study of 1,276 skulls of these ancient Peruvians, I did not find a 
single skull with significant deformity of the dental arches. 
Since these investigations have apparently established the fact that 
this problem is related directly to nutrition, and chiefly to nutrition 
in the formative period, and, as we shall see, to a very early part of the 
formative period, we have here evidence of a system of living that is 
very closely in accord with Nature’s fundamental laws of reproduction. 
Several studies have been made dealing with the incidence of dental 
caries or tooth decay among these ancient cultures. The author of “Bird 
Islands of Peru’’’ states that in his examination of fifty mummies in 
succession he found only four with a tooth with dental caries. This 
again is in striking contrast to our modernized communities in which 
from 95 to 100 per cent of all the members of a community group 
suffer from dental caries. I have shown in connection with the Indians 
of the western coast of Canada that in six highly modernized communi￾ties where the Indians were using white man’s foods, 40 per cent of all 
the teeth had been attacked by dental caries. A similar high percentage 
was found in the Indians now living in Florida. The ancient burials in 
southern Florida revealed apparent, complete immunity. These were 
pre-Columbian burials. 
The skill of the primitive cultures of Peru in engineering as evi￾denced by the irrigation systems has always been a subject of amaze￾ment to modern engineers. I visited in a valley fifteen miles from the 
Santa River an ancient aqueduct which was said to be a hundred miles 
long. Our guide informed me that he had walked in it for thirty-five miles. With its even grades, overflows and auxiliary channels for dis- tribution, its adaptation to the area to be watered, and the skill with ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF PERU e29

Fic. 79. The ancient civilizations of Peru had skilled engineers. In the upper view is seen 
one of the ancient aqueducts still intact for thirty-five miles which modern scientists esti￾mate was capable of delivering sixty million cubic feet of water per day. They had no 
hardened tools or blasting powder, yet they cut this channel through boulders and rocks. 
Below is seen a valley covering thousands of acres once made fertile by irrigation but now 
an arid desert. 230 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
which it was cut through rock shoulders and its retaining walls built, 
it constitutes a monument to engineering ability. Modern engineers 
have estimated that this aqueduct could deliver sixty million cubic feet 
of water a day. In Fig. 79 will be seen a section where it has been carried 
through a rock cutting and beyond will be seen a retaining wall used 
to carry the flume along the sheer face of a rock. The modern inhabi￾tants of this community have carried away this retaining wall for use 
in the foundations of their huts. Below, in Fig. 79, will be seen a dis￾trict of many hundreds of acres, possibly a thousand, where the fields 
are laid out just as they were left hundreds of years ago when the primi￾tive people were driven from this habitat. All this valley needs is water. 
In order to reach the burial places it was necessary to drive many hun￾dreds of miles over the arid desert inland from the coast. We were ex￾ceedingly fortunate in having as our interpreter and guide Dr. Albert 
Giesecke, who for fourteen years was the Chancellor of Cuzco Uni￾versity. With his excellent knowledge of the country and its languages, 
with the credentials which gave us entry to the secluded places, to￾gether with the kindness and helpfulness of the Peruvian Government 
officials in almost all localities, we were able to obtain much valuable 
information. In an estimate of this culture not only their arts, but their 
scientific skill should be included. 
Since the primary object of this quest was to learn of the efficiency 
of these primitive people in the art of living in harmony with Nature’s 
laws and their methods for accomplishing this, it was desirable to find, 
if possible, some living descendants of these people to gain from them 
the information that had been handed down. We were told that there 
were a few villages in an isolated section of the coast in northern Peru 
where the inhabitants claimed descent from the ancient Chimu cultures 
of that area. This group was characterized by a flattening of the skull 
at the back which classified them as short heads and is readily identified. 
We were very fortunate in having the assistance of Commander Daniel 
Matto of the Peruvian Army. He was able to utilize the police facili￾ties for locating typical old residents who could tell us much of the 
story of their race and its recent history as it had been handed down by 
word of mouth. In Fig. 80 will be seen one of these nonagenarians. He 
told us of incidents that had been related to him by his great-great- grandfather and by the old people of that area, of the coming of Pi- zarro four hundred years ago. The height of this man can be judged as he is seen standing beside Mrs. Price, who is five feet three. His head is shown both front and side view, revealing the flattened surface at the back. An ancient skull with typical flattening is also shown. For- ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF PERU 234

Fic. 80. The ancient Chimus flattened the back of the head, as shown in the lower left, 
by placing the infant on a board. A descendant of the Chimus is shown in the upper left 
with Mrs. Price, and in front and side views at the right. Note that the back of his head 
is similarly flattened. 232 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
tunately these people are living very closely in accordance with the 
customs of their ancestors. They are fisherfolk, with a hardihood and 
skill that is in striking contrast with the lethargy of the modernized 
groups. Their fine physical development, the breadth of their dental 
arches and the regularity of their facial features are in striking con￾trast to the characteristics noted among individuals in the modernized 
colonies. In Fig. 81 will be seen typical members of these colonies. 
The skill with which these men manage their fishing boats is inspir￾ing. Even though the surf was rolling in great combers they did not 
hesitate to go out in either their small crafts carrying one individual 
or in their large sailboats carrying a dozen men. The abundance of the 
fish in this district is demonstrated by the large catch that each suc￾ceeding boat brought to shore. 
At the time the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in Peru one of the 
most unique of the ancient cultures held sway over both the mountain 
plateaus and the coastal plains from Santiago of Chile northward to 
Quito, Equador, a distance of about 1200 miles. This culture took its 
name from the ruling emperors called Incas. The capital of their great 
kingdom was Cuzco, a city located between the East and West Cordil￾lera Ranges of the Andes. These parallel ranges are from fifty to two 
hundred miles apart. Between them is situated a great plateau ranging 
from 10,000 to 13,000 feet above the sea. The mountain ranges are 
snow-capped and include in Peru alone fifty peaks that are over 18,000 
feet in altitude, ranging up to 22,185 feet in Mount Huascaran. Only 
Mount Aconcagua in Chile is higher. It is 23,075 feet—the highest 
mountain in the Americas. The air drift is across South America from 
east to west, carrying vast quantities of water received by evaporation 
from the Atlantic Ocean. This moisture is precipitated rapidly when 
the clouds are forced into the chill of the higher Andes. In the rainy 
season the great plateau area is frequently well watered, though not 
in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of agriculture for much of the 
territory. In the past the precipitation has been supplemented by vast 
irrigation projects using the water from the melting snows. It is esti￾mated that the population ruled over by the reigning Incas at the time 
of the coming of the Spaniards reached five millions. 
It is probable that few, if any, of the ancient or modern cultures 
of the world have ever attained a more highly perfected organization 
of society than had this Inca culture. The ruling Inca was a benevolent 
despot, and according to history unique in that he practiced most dili- gently all of the laws he promulgated for his people. There was no pov- erty, want or crime. Every man, woman and child was specifically ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF PERU 233

villages in the north of Peru. They live, as did their ancestors, largely on the sea food. 
Typical faces of this native stock are shown in this photograph. Note the breadth of the 
dental arches and full development of the facial bones. 234 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
provided with all necessities. The entire amount of tillable land was 
divided so that every man, woman and child had his assigned parcel. 
Everyone worked as assigned by the proper official. While it is not 
appropriate here to go into details, it is important that we have a bird’s 
eye view of this great culture for which I will quote a paragraph from 
Agnes Rothery’s “South America, The West Coast and The East.”” 
The people who erected this temple lived in order and health, under the most 
successful communism the world has ever seen. Their land was divided into 
three portions—one portion for the Inca, one for the Sun, and one for the 
people, with seventy square meters for every boy and thirty-five for every girl. 
The live stock and implements were similarly apportioned and the land was 
ploughed, planted, and the crops gathered in strict rotation. First the fields of 
the Sun were cultivated, and then the land of the aged, the sick, widows, and 
orphans was tended; then the lands of the people, neighbors assisting one 
another; and last of all the lands of the Inca, with songs of praise and joy, 
because this was the service of their King. To every living soul was given his 
tasks, according to his physical and mental capacities. He was prevented from 
overwork, prohibited from idleness, cared for in illness and old age. Children 
were taken by the Government when they were five and trained to the pro￾fession where they were most needed. There was no hunger, no crime in the 
whole empire. 
The Inca held his kingly office over the docile, industrious, and contented 
mass not only through his royal blood, but through his wisdom and kindness in 
caring for and guiding his subjects, his bravery in war, and his statesmanship 
at home. Although he set an example to his subjects by following every law 
which he promulgated (astonishing idea to our modern lawmakers!), he lived, 
as became his rank, in luxury. In his garden were rows of corn moulded from 
pure gold with leaves of pure silver, and a tassel of spun silver, as fine as silk, 
moving in the air. Llamas and alpacas, life-sized and cunningly fashioned from 
the same metal, stood upon his lawns, as they did in the courts of the Temple 
of the Sun. 
‘Cuzco, the capital, is reported to have housed about two hundred 
thousand people at the time of the Spanish Conquest. It is situated on 
a branch of the Urabamba River in a beautiful valley surrounded by 
fertile mountain sides and towering snow-capped pinnacles. The Ura￾bamba River drains a large area of the plateau lying to the south of 
Cuzco and has cut a magnificent gorge through the southern range of 
the Andes where it passes from the plateau to the eastern watershed 
and thence to the Amazon. A little to the south of Cuzco the eastern and the western ranges of mountains approach and combine in a cluster of magnificent pinnacles and intervening valleys and gorges, that are.to be equalled by no mountain scenery in the world. Today, almost all ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF PERU 235 
travel from the Andean Plateau north of this region, as well as from all 
areas along the coast, must proceed to the coast, thence down the coast by boat to the port of Mollendo which is often dangerous or impossible of approach because of the heavy seas. The journey is made by train up through Arequipa and over the western Cordillera Range of the 
Andes into the plateau country and from there northward to Cuzco. 
So great is this natural barrier that the detour requires many days, and 
the crossing of several divides ranging from fourteen to sixteen thou￾sand feet above the sea. This was not necessary for the Incas who had 
built roads and suspension bridges through these mountains from Cuzco 
to all parts of the great empire. It is in this mountain vastness that the 
Inca rulers had constructed their most superb fortresses. While the early 
Spanish conquerors of the country knew that the nobility had great 
defenses to which they might retreat, the location of the fortresses was 
not known. Their greatest fortress was discovered and excavated by 
Professor C. W. Bingham of Yale, under the auspices of Yale University 
and the American Museum of Natural History. This fortress and retreat 
is now world famous as Macchu Piccu, and probably represents the high￾est development of engineering, ancient and in some respects modern, 
on the American continent. 
We are particularly concerned with the type of men that were capable 
of such great achievement, since they were required to carry forward 
their great undertakings without the use of iron or the wheel. While the 
great Inca culture dominated the Sierras and the coast for several cen￾turies prior to the coming of the Spanish, and while they had their seat 
of government and vast agricultural enterprises in the high Sierras, it 
is of special interest that many of the most magnificent monuments 
remaining today in stone were not constructed by the Inca culture, but 
by the Tauhuanocan culture which preceded the Inca. The Incas were 
a part of the Quechu linguistic stock, while the Tauhuanocans were a 
part of the Aymara linguistic stock. The Incas had their capital in the 
high plateau country about the center of Peru. The earlier Tauhuanocan 
culture centered in southern Peru near Lake Titicaca where their most 
magnificent structures are to be found today. One of the largest single 
stones to be moved and put into the building of a great temple in the 
history of the world is to be found near Lake Titicaca. According to 
engineers, there is no quarry known in an easily reached locality where 
such a stone could be quarried. It is conjectured that it was brought 
two hundred miles over mountainous country. It is important to note 
that many magnificent structures, evidently belonging to this ancient 236 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Tauhaunocan culture, are found distributed through the Andean 
Plateau from Bolivia to Equador. Their masonry was characterized by 
the fitting together of large stones faced so perfectly that in many of 
the walls it was difficult to find a crevice which had enough space to 
allow the passage of the point of my pen knife, notwithstanding that 
these stones were many-sided with some of them fifteen to twenty feet 
in length. In Figure 82 above will be seen a section of wall of the great 
fortress Sacsahuaman overlooking Cuzco. Modern engineers seem unable 
to provide a satisfactory answer as to how these people were able to 
cut these stones with the limited facilities available, nor is it explained 
how they were able to transport and hoist some of their enormous mono￾liths. The walls and fortress of Macchu Piccu, as well as the residences 
and temples, were built of white granite which apparently was taken 
from quarries in the bank of the river Urabamba, two thousand feet 
below the fortress. Without modern hoisting machinery, how did they 
raise those mammoth stones? In Fig. 82 below is shown a typical section 
of wall. One stone shown has twelve faces and twelve angles, all fitting 
accurately its boundary stones. It is as though the stones were plastic 
and pressed into a mould. 
The country is rugged. Over it passes the highest standard-gage rail￾road in the world,—about 16,000 feet above sea level. The banks of this 
river are protected for long distances by ancient stone retaining walls. 
The native Indians live and herd their flocks of llamas and alpacas up 
near the snow line, largely between 15,000 and 18,000 feet. The Incas 
and their descendants now occupying the high Sierras in the Andes have 
been thrifty agriculturists. They turn the soil with a very narrow, long, 
slender bladed spade which they force into the ground, and with which 
they pry the ground up in chunks. They then break up the chunks. 
These spades were originally made of copper which they mined them￾selves. Cuzco is the archeological capital of South America, but its glory 
is in the ancient fortresses and temples, rather than in the modern struc￾tures. As one passes through the streets, he will note that in many in￾stances the foundations and parts of the walls of many of the modern 
Spanish cathedrals and public buildings are of old Inca construction, of 
fine stone work surmounted by cheap rubble work and mortar super- structure. Whereas the original Cuzco had running water and an excellent sanitation system, modern Cuzco has deplorable sanitary con- ditions. The following is quoted from the West Coast Leader, published 
in Lima, dated July 20, 1937: “Of a total 3,600 houses in the city ot Cuzco 900 are without water or drainage; 2,400 are without light ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF PERU 237

surprising, therefore, that in some years the death rate exceeds the birth 
fate.

Note the breadth of the dental arches provided by excellent development of the bones of 
the head. 
We are particularly concerned in studying these people to know the 
sources of their great capacity for developing art, engineering, govern￾ment and social organization. Can such a magnificent culture be brought 
about unless founded on a superb physical development resulting from 
purely biologic forces? 
Earthquakes are very frequent in the Andes. We experienced several 
while in Peru. One of these opened up a cave in the mountainside in 
the Urabamba Valley near which we were making studies. The cave 
had just been explored and a number of ancient burials found. I was 
able to examine a number of skulls from this cave which apparently 
represented a pre-Spanish period. The date of the burials could not be 
determined. The skulls were interpreted as belonging to an early Indian 
period. In Fig. 83 may be seen two typical skulls. Note the broad sweep ANGIENT ChVILIZATIONS*" OF, PERU 239 
of the dental arches and freedom from tooth decay. The third molars 
(wisdom teeth) are well developed and in normal position for mastica￾tion. These are typical of the entire group found in this burial place. It 
is very evident that these individuals were provided with an adequate 
nutrition throughout the formative and growth periods, as well as dur￾ing their adult life. This is significant because of the limited variety of 
foods easily obtainable for the people in the high plateau country of the 
Andes. 4 
The ancient Peruvians of both the coastal area and high plateau coun. 
try had developed superb physical bodies in each of the several cultures 
This development had been brought about in spite of the bad conditions 
prevailing with arid desert land extending from the coast to the moun. 
tains, and in spite of the severe climate of the high Sierras. The people 
utilized the wide variety of animal life from the sea in conjunction with 
the excellent plant foods grown in the river basins with the aid of ir￾rigation. Over twenty of our common plants had their origin in ancient 
Peru. In the high Sierras, their animal foods were largely limited to the 
llama, alpaca and wild animals. Each household, however, maintained a 
colony of guinea pigs. Owing to the difficulty of boiling in the high 
altitudes, they found it necessary to roast their cereals and meats. Their 
vegetable foods included potatoes, which were preserved in powder 
form by freezing and drying and pulverizing. Corn and several variet‘es 
of beans and quinua were their principal cereals. The latter is a small] 
seed of very high nutritive value.

N ORDER to understand the living descendants of the ancient residents 
I of the high Andes it is essential that we know their environment. 
Their climate is cold at night the year around. While during the winter 
the snow is deep in the high mountains, there is very little on the pla￾teau, since Peru is near the equator extending from 5 to 16 degrees south 
latitude. The sunshine is bright and warm even in winter. Consequently 
they have pasturage for their animals the year around. 
The only native domesticated animals of the Andean Plateau are the 
llama and the alpaca. Both of these belong to the camel species, as does 
the vicuna. The llama is the Indians’ beast of burden in the Andes. 
Only the males are used. The animals are very docile and respond with 
gentleness when treated with kindness. One continually marvels at the 
ease with which the Indian guides his loaded caravan with soft words or 
motions, never with harshness. The llama has many unique features as a 
beast of burden. It forages as it moves along and consequently must be 
driven very slowly. Each animal will carry a burden not exceeding a 
hundred pounds, and if more is placed on its back it will immediately 
lie down until the extra burden is removed. The llama has broad double￾toed feet like the camel which make it very sure-footed. It requires no 
shoeing and exceedingly little care. It can thrive, however, only in the 
high altitudes. The wool of the llama is coarse and is used for heavy, 
rough garments. The alpaca is a little smaller than the llama and pro￾duces a very heavy wool of fine quality. Accustomed as this animal is 
to the severe cold and the high altitudes, as well as to the rain and sun, 
its fleece is both durable and warm. It is used extensively throughout 
the world for suits for aviators. The native colors vary from white to 
bluish tints and from light to very dark browns. It accordingly provides 
very stable colors for weaving directly into ponchos and native apparel. 
The vicuna is a much smaller animal than either the llama or alpaca. 
It has one of the most highly prized coats of fur produced anywhere in 
the world. This animal has never been domesticated; vast herds have 
lived wild on the high slopes of the Andes mountains. The demand for 
vicuna fur became so great that a million and a half of these animals 
240 PERUVIAN INDIANS 241 
were slain in one year to obtain their fur pelts. The result is that the 
Peruvian Government has now completely forbidden their destruc￾tion. The garments of the ruling class of the Incas were made of the 
vicuna wool. 
One of the important objectives of my trip to Peru was to find and 
study, if possible, some descendants of these Andean stocks. Fortunately, 
large numbers of the Aymara linguistic stock, the descendants of the 
Tauhuanocan culture, are still residing in southern Peru and Bolivia 
where they are said to retain the essentials of their ancient methods of 
living. They constitute the principal native populations in the vicinity 
of Lake Titicaca and the high mountain plateaus of southern Peru and 
northern Bolivia. I have always encountered difficulty in persuading the 
native peoples to allow themselves to be photographed in their primitive 
costumes. They are usually willing to be photographed provided one will 
wait for them to put on some modern garment. 
I am reminded of an experience on one of the South Sea Islands where 
there was need for roads, but no money with which to build them. Laws 
were passed by the chiefs that anyone approaching a highway in native 
garb where he might be seen by a foreigner was subject to arrest and to 
payment of a fine which had to be worked out as labor in building roads. 
Of course, on that island no one would allow himself to be photographed 
without some modern clothing. One boy presented himself wearing a 
single garment, a man’s full dress vest, which had evidently reached the 
island in a missionary barrel. 
The hats in the pictures in Fig. 84 are of native design and manufac￾ture. They are made of fur and are like our modern derbies in con￾struction. 
It is important to note the roundness of the features of the Aymaras, 
the wide development of the nostrils for air intake and the breadth of 
the dental arches. Many of them had been transported several hundreds 
of miles to a coffee plantation because of their adeptness and skill in 
sorting imperfect coffee beans from the run. As I watched them I found 
it difficult to move my eyes fast enough to follow their fingers and pick 
out from the moving run the undesired or imperfectly formed kernels. 
This revealed a superb development of coordination. The wisdom of 
these Aymaras is discussed in Chapter 21. 
I was very anxious to study the Incas in different parts of the high 
Andes, particularly some of the original type in the vicinity of Cuzco, 
their ancient capital. Throughout the Andean Plateau, the Indians 
from the higher elevations bring down their wares on market days to 
exchange with Indians from other localities, as well as to meet and visit 242 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

with their friends. They are very industrious and one seldom sees a 
woman, either shepherding the stock or carrying a burden, who is not 
busily engaged in spinning wool. While their wool is obtained in part 
from sheep that have been imported, a great deal of it is obtained from 
the alpacas which, like the llamas, are raised in the high altitudes where 
the Indians always prefer to live. I was fortunate in making contact 
with several groups of Indians in high altitudes through the kindness of 
the prefects. A group of Indians from the high mountains of the Ura￾bamba Valley near Cuzco is shown in Fig. 85. An examination of this 
group of twenty-five revealed the fact that not one tooth had been 
attacked by dental caries and that, at all ages, the teeth normally due 
were present. 
In Fig. 85, lower right, may be seen a typical Indian of the Andes 
carrying a heavy load. The Indians of this region are able to carry all 
day two hundred to three hundred pounds, and to do this day after day. 
At several of the ports, these mountain Indians have been brought down 
to the coast to load and unload coffee and freight from the ships. Their 
strength is phenomenal. 
In approaching the study of the descendants of the Inca culture, it 
is important to keep in mind a little of their history and _ persecution 
under the Spanish rule. To this day they are bitter against the white 
man for the treachery that has been meted out to them on many occa￾sions. Their leader was seized under treachery. The agreement to free him, 
if the designated rooms were filled with gold as high as a man could 
reach, was broken and their chief killed after the gold was obtained. 
It is recorded that some six million of them died in the mines under 
forced labor and poor foods under the lash of their Spanish oppressors. 
In many places they still keep themselves aloof by staying in the high 
mountains of the Andes with their flocks of llamas and alpacas. They 
come down only for trading. As in the past, they still weave their own 
garments. Indeed, they provide practically all of their necessities from 
the local environment. Their capacity for enduring cold is wonderful. 
They can sleep comfortably through the freezing nights with their 
ponchos wrapped about their heads and with their legs and feet bare. 
They wear two types of head cover, one inside the other. Several in￾dividuals are seen in Fig. 85. Many of them have faces that show strong 
character and personality. 
The women of this district wear felt hats which can be turned up or 
down according to the weather. Fine examples of weaving were worn 
by the women.

development of his chest, the splendid facial development and fine teeth 
and dental arches. It is important to keep in mind that these people are 
living in a rarified atmosphere and that, because of the high altitude, 
they need greater lung capacity and stronger hearts than do the people 
living at sea level. The ratio of oxygen content is reduced about half 
at 10,000 feet. 
The broad dental arches of these Indians are shown in Fig. 87. Note 
the extensive wear of the teeth at the upper left. Much of the food is 
eaten cold and dry as parched corn and beans. Such rough foods as these 
wear the teeth down. 
Market days which usually occur on Sunday present an interesting 
scene. The Indians travel long distances with their wares for exchange. 
Ti:ey have no currency and exchanges are made by bargaining. 
Where these Indians have become modernized, the : *»w generation 
shows typical changes in facial and dental arch form as reported for the 
other groups. There is also a marked character reaction whic', will be 
discussed in detail in Chapter 19. In Fig. 88 are shown four cypical 
modification patterns due to the influence of modernization after the 
foods of the white man have displaced the native dietary. 
An important item iin the life of the Andean Indians is the satisfaction 
they get from chewing cocoa leaves from which is made our modern 
cocaine. In order to extract the alkaloid they chew with these leaves the 
ash produced by the burning of a particular plant. This drug is chewed 
as tobacco, one large quid will last for several hours. Practically every 
Indian carries in a little pouch a quantity of these leaves in dried form. 
The effect of this drug is to increase their capacity for endurance. It 
makes them unconscious of hunger and fatigue. Through our inter￾preter we frequently asked them regarding the comfort or nourishment 
they obtained from the leaves and were told that they often preferred 
these leaves to food when they were on a journey and carrying heavy 
loads. I was informed that they can increase the quantity of the drug 
used to a point at which they are quite unconcious of pain and able to 
endure injuries without suffering, and operations without discomfort. 
Since packets of these leaves were found in the burials near the coast, it 
is clear that the drugs were used throughout Peru in early times. It is 
also of interest that several of the skulls taken from the cave in the 
high Andes, were found with trephine operations in the skulls similar 
to those found in the burials along the coast. PERUVIAN INDIANS 247

at the upper left is a mouth breather because his nostrils are too small to carry sufficient 
air. The girl at the upper right has a badly underdeveloped chin and pinched nostrils.. Both 
boys below have badly narrowed arches with crowding teeth. PERUVIAN INDIANS 249 
The physical perfection and development of the present and past 
Andean population has been accomplished in spite of the difficulty of 
building and maintaining good bodily structure at the high altitude 
where dairy products have not been and are not at present a large part 
of the nutritional program. In this regard the ancient and contemporary 
peoples of the Andes differ radically from the present and past groups 
of people who live in the high valleys of Switzerland and Tibet where 
milk is plentiful. The cow, sheep, horse and pig have been imported 
into the high Andean countries during the last four hundred years since 
the Spanish Conquests, but they have not acclimatized easily. The earlier 
cultures were of course, dependent upon the Ilama, alpaca, wild deer, 
birds and guinea pig for animal foods. While there have been vast burial 
mounds built and preserved in the coastal regions where the absence of 
rain and the dry sand have added materially to their preservation, the 
rainy seasons have established very different conditions for skeletal 
preservation in the high altitudes. Nevertheless, a large number of 
skeletons in good state of preservation have been recovered. 
The high Andean plateau extends throughout the length of Peru 
between the mountain chains. The present Indian stock was studied in 
four different places in the high plateau country, the farthest north 
being Huaras. In this area we were materially assisted by the governor 
of the province who very kindly sent messengers and brought down 
Indian families from high altitudes to the police headquarters at Huaras. 
This place is at an elevation of about 11,000 feet. We had an opportun￾ity to study also many who had come from the higher altitudes to the 
markets to sell their wares. Huaras lies in a fertile valley that has been 
in contact with modern civilization for many decades. This vicinity, 
therefore, provided a wide range in classes of people, from Indians who 
are isolated to those who are living in highly modernized groups. In 
addition to the opportunity for studying the older people there were 
opportunities for studying adolescents in the two high schools, one for 
girls and one for boys. Some were pure-bloods who had been highly 
isolated in their formative and childhood periods. The mixed-bloods had 
been considerably modernized. There were some whites. I was told by 
the prefect and others who were well informed that there was quite a 
distinct difference between the Indians who were living in the high 
northern Cordillera, the western Andean range called the Black Moun￾tains, and those living in the eastern range or White Mountains. The 
latter were physically much better built and were least modernized. 
Typical low immunity to caries and changes in facial and dental arch 
form were found in these modernized groups. 550 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Another important area in which the native Indians were studied 
was Chiclayo. This district is unique in large part because of the in￾fluence of the modern civilization at Lima with which it is connected 
by the railroad. The native market here is very large and occupies about 
a mile of the main street of the town, through which no traffic except 
pedestrian traffic can pass while the market is in session. The town has 
been under the influence of the Spanish since the time of the Conquest. 
It has many colonial buildings and a large cathedral. It has not, however, 
accommodations for the influx of tourists who come out of curiosity 
for the purchase of Indian wares. With the aid of the prefect, even 
though no public accommodations were available, we were made very 
comfortable in the soldiers’ barracks. As the Indians came down from 
the mountains to display and sell their wares, they were brought to us 
at the barracks. Since this district has been in quite intimate contact 
with the nutrition of the modernized capital, we found here many in￾dividuals showing typical degeneration of the teeth and dental arches. 
The adaptation of racial characteristics to the environment in which 
they have developed is very strikingly illustrated in the Indian cultures 
of the Amazon jungle district. We were very fortunate in being able to 
make studies of some groups living at present as did their ancestors 
through countless centuries in the Amazon basin. We were greatly 
pleased and impressed with the splendid physiques and fine personalities 
of many of the individuals of the groups. 
The abundance of rain, the fertility of the soil and the warm climate 
make plant growth most luxuriant on the eastern slopes of the Andes. 
It is of interest that in passing from the capital, Lima, across the desert 
stretch between the ocean and the mountains and then up the wall of 
the Andes to an altitude of sixteen thousand feet and then down to the 
plateau at about twelve thousand feet and up again over the eastern 
range and down into the Amazon basin, one has passed through the 
tropics, temperate zone and sub-arctic zones with varieties of plant 
life corresponding to each. A distance of a few hundred yards will often 
divide the limits of particular birds and flowers. When one reaches the 
foothills of the Andes on the eastern side, he is in a region of rushing 
streams teeming with fish, a region of tropical fruits and vegetables. It is in this setting that some of the finest Indians we have seen were en- joying life in its fullness. The type of shelter is very simple, indeed, consisting as it does of a framework covered with banana and palm leaves. We were privileged to meet by special arrangement about thirty of this tribe who had been brought from some distance by the officials of the Perene Colony, owned and operated by the Peruvian Corporation. PERUVIAN INDIANS 251 
In Fig. 89 will be seen the chief and one of the noble women of his 
retinue. They understood that they would have their pictures taken and came dressed in royal regalia. Typical countenances are seen in Figs.

90 and 91. These people have very kind faces with broad dental arches, 
and a high sense of humor. They decorated their faces especially for 
their photograph. In the entire group associated with this chief I did not 
find a single tooth that had been attacked by dental caries. The fine 
dental arches are illustrated in Figs. 90 and 91. Many of these young 
men had really noble countenances, such as would rate them as leaders 
in modern science and culture. 
In another tribe, however, of the same racial stock, efforts to modern￾ize had been in operation for some time by a mission. The food of this 
latter group had been distinctly affected by their contact with the 
modern group. By reducing the animal foods, the change in physical 
efficiency, and appearance of tooth decay, is most marked. In Fig. 92 252 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

above will be seen typical cases of rampant tooth decay with extensive 
loss of the teeth. In Fig. 92 below are shown two of the first generation 
following the adoption of the modernized type of diet in this group. 
Note the narrowing of the faces with crowding of the teeth. Note the 
deformed dental arches. 
The native foods of these Amazon Jungle Indians included the liberal 
use of fish which are very abundant in both the Amazon and its 
branches, particularly in the foothill streams; animal life from the forest 
and thickets; bird life, including many water fowl and their eggs; plants 
and fruits. They use very large quantities of yucca which is a starchy 
root quite similar to our potato in chemical content. This is not the 
yucca of North America. 
The Peruvian Indians, in the highlands and in the eastern watershed 
of the Andes, and also in the Amazon Basin, have built superb bodies 
with high immunity to dental caries and with splendidly developed 
facial and dental arch forms while living on the native foods in accord￾ance with their accumulated wisdom. Whenever they have adopted the 
foods of modern civilization and have displaced their own nutrition, 
dental caries has been found to be wide-spread; and in the succeeding 
generations following the adoption of modern foods, a change in facial 
and dental arch forms has developed. The modernized foods which dis￾placed their native foods were the typical white man’s dietary of re￾fined-flour products, sugar, sweetened foods, canned goods, and polished 
rice. Chapter ik: 
CHARACTERISTICS OF PRIMITIVE AND 
MODERNIZED DIETARIES 
F PRIMITIVE races have been more efficient than modernized groups 
if in the matter of preventing degenerative processes, physical, mental 
and moral, it is only because they have been more efficient in complying 
with Nature’s laws. We have two procedures that we can use for evalu￾ating their programs: first, the interpretation of their data in terms of 
our modern knowledge; and second, the clinical application of their 
procedures to our modern social problems. Specifically, since the greater 
success of the primitives in meeting Nature’s laws has been based pri￾marily on dietary procedures, it becomes desirable first, to evaluate their 
dietary programs on the basis of known biologic requirements for com￾parison with the foods of our modern civilization; and second, to test 
their primitive nutritional programs by applying their equivalents to 
our modern families. 
The advance in our knowledge of body-building and body-repairing 
materials from a biochemical standpoint makes it possible even with our 
limited knowledge of organic catalysts, to draw comparisons between 
the primitive and modernized dietaries. If we use the generally accepted 
minimal and optimal quantities of the various minerals and vitamins 
required, as indicated by Sherman,’ we shall have at once a yardstick 
for evaluating the primitive dietaries. 
Of the eighteen elements of which the human body is composed, all 
of which are presumably essential, several are needed in very small 
quantities. A few are required in liberal quantities. The normal adult 
needs to receive from the foods eaten one-half to one gram of calcium 
or lime per day. Few people receive more than one-half of the minerals 
present in the food. The requirements of phosphorus are approximately 
twice this amount. Of iron we need from one-seventh to one-third of 
a gram per day. Smaller amounts than these are required of several other 
elements. 
In order to utilize these minerals, and to build and maintain the 
functions of various organs, definite quantities of various organic cata￾256 PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 257 
lysts which act as activating substances are needed. These include the 
known and unknown vitamins. 
Unlike some experimental animals human beings have not the ability 
to create some special chemical substances (not elements) such as vita￾mins within their bodies. Several animals have this capacity. For example, 
scurvy, which is due to a lack of vitamin C, cannot be produced readily 
in rats because rats can manufacture vitamin C. Similarly, rickets cannot 
be produced easily in guinea pigs, because they can synthesize vitamin D, 
The absence of vitamin D and adequate minerals produces rickets in 
young human beings. Neither rickets nor scurvy can be produced read￾ily in dogs because of the dogs’ capacity to synthesize both vitamins C 
and D. We are not so fortunate. Similarly, the absence of vitamin B 
(B1) produces in birds and man severe nervous system reactions, such 
as beri-beri. These symptoms are often less pronounced, or quite dif￾ferent, in other animals. 
From our knowledge of the dietaries used by the various primitive 
racial stocks we can calculate the approximate amounts of the minerals 
and vitamins provided by those dietaries, for comparison with the 
amounts provided by modernized foods. Our problem is simplified by 
the fact that the food of the white man in various parts of the world 
being built from a few fundamental food factors, has certain quite 
constant characteristics. Hence the displacing diets are similar for the 
several modernized groups herewith considered. 
As a further approach to our problem, it is important to keep in mind 
that, in general, the wild animal life has largely escaped many of the 
degenerative processes which affect modern white peoples. We ascribe 
this to animal instinct in the matter of food selection. It is possible that 
man has lost through disuse some of the normal faculty for consciously 
recognizing body requirements. In other words, the only hunger of 
which we now are conscious is a hunger for energy to keep us warm 
and to supply power. In general, we stop eating when an adequate 
amount of energy has been provided, whether or not the body building 
and repairing materials have been included in the food. The heat and 
energy factor in our foods is measured in calories. In planning an ade￾quate diet, a proper ratio between body building and energy units must 
be maintained. It is important to keep in mind that while the amount 
of body-building and repairing material required is similar for different 
individuals of the same age and weight, it is markedly different for two 
individuals, one of whom is leading a sedentary, and the other, an active 
life, Similarly, there is a great difference between the amount of body- 258 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
building and repairing material required by a growing child or an ex￾pectant mother and an average adult. 
There are certain characteristics of the various dietaries of the primi￾tive races, which are universally present when that dietary program 1s 
associated with a high immunity to disease and freedom from deformi￾ties. In general, these are the foods that provide adequate sources of 
body-building and body-repairing material. The use by primitives, of 
foods relatively low in calories has resulted in forcing them to eat 
large quantities of these foods, in order to provide the heat and energy 
requirements of the body. The primitives have obtained, often with 
great difficulty, foods that are scarce but rich in certain elements. In 
these rare foods were elements which the body requires in small quanti￾ties, including minerals such as iodine, copper, manganese and special 
vitamins. In connection with the vitamins it should be kept in mind 
that our knowledge of these unique organic catalysts is limited. The 
medical profession and the public at large think of vitamin D as con￾sisting of just one chemical factor, whereas, investigations are revealing 
continually new and additional factors. A recent review” describes in 
considerable detail eight distinct factors in vitamin D and refers to in￾formation indicating that there may be at least twelve. Clearly, it is 
not possible to undertake to provide an adequate nutrition simply by 
reinforcing the diet with a few synthetic products which are known to 
represent certain of these nutritional factors. By the mass of the people 
at large, as well as by members of the medical profession, activated 
ergosterol is considered to include all that is necessary to supply the 
vitamin D group of activators to human nutrition. 
The various dietary programs of primitive races which appear to be 
successful in controlling dental caries and deformities may be divided 
into three groups based upon the sources from which they derive the 
minerals and fat-soluble activators. I do not use the term “vitamins” 
exclusively because as yet little is known about the whole group of or￾ganic catalysts, although we have considerable knowledge of the limited 
number which are designated by the first half dozen letters of the alpha￾bet. Most lay people and members of the medical and dental professions 
assume that the six or eight vitamins constitute practically all that are 
needed in an adequate nutrition. These organic activators can be divided 
into two main groups, water-soluble and fat-soluble. An essential char￾acteristic of the successful dietary programs of primitive races has been 
found to relate to a liberal source of the fat-soluble activator group. 
When we discuss the successful dietary programs of the various groups from the standpoint of their ability to control tooth decay and prevent PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 259 
deformity we find that for the people in the high and isolated Alpine 
valleys their nutrition is dependent largely on entire rye bread and dairy 
products with meat about once a week and various vegetables, fresh in 
the summer season and stored for the winter season. An analysis in my 
laboratory of the dairy products obtained from the Loetschental Valley 
in Switzerland through a series of years has shown the vitamin content 
to be much higher than the average throughout the world for similar 
foods during the same seasons. The milk in these high valleys is produced 
from green pasturage and stored green hay of exceptionally high chloro￾phyll content. The milk and the rye bread provided minerals abun￾dantly. 
The diet of the people in the Outer Hebrides which proved adequate 
for maintaining a high immunity to dental caries and preventing de￾formity consisted chiefly of oat products and sea foods including the 
wide variety of fish available there. This diet included generally no 
dairy products since the pasture was not adequate for maintaining cattle. 
Oat grain was the only cereal that could be matured satisfactorily in 
that climate. Some green foods were available in the summer and some 
vegetables were grown and stored for winter. This diet, which included 
a liberal supply of fish, included also the use of livers of fish. One im￾portant fish dish was baked cod’s head that had been stuffed with oat 
meal and chopped cods’ livers. This was an important inclusion in the 
diets of the growing children. The oats and fish, including livers, pro￾vided minerals and vitamins adequate for an excellent racial stock with 
high immunity to tooth decay. 
For the Eskimos of Alaska the native diet consisted of a liberal use of 
organs and other special tissues of the large animal life of the sea, as 
well as of fish. The latter were dried in large quantities in the summer 
and stored for winter use. The fish were also eaten frozen. Seal oil was 
used freely as an adjunct to this diet and seal meat was specially prized 
and was usually available. Caribou meat was sometimes available. The 
organs were used. Their fruits were limited largely to a few berries in￾cluding cranberries, available in the summer and stored for winter use. 
Several plant foods were gathered in the summer and stored in fat or 
frozen for winter use. A ground nut that was gathered by the Tundra 
mice and stored in caches was used by the Eskimos as a vegetable. Stems 
of certain water grasses, water plants and bulbs were occasionally used. 
The bulk of their diet, however, was fish and large animal life of the 
sea from which they selected certain organs and tissues with great care 
and wisdom. These included the inner layer of skin of one of the whale 
species, which has recently been shown to be very rich in vitamin C. 
\

{ 260 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Fish eggs were dried in season. They were used liberally as food for the 
growing children and were recognized as important for growth and re￾production. This successful nutrition provided ample amounts of fat￾soluble activators and minerals from sea animal life. 
For the Indians living inside the Rocky Mountain Range in the far 
North of Canada, the successful nutrition for nine months of the year 
was largely limited to wild game, chiefly moose and caribou. During 
the summer months the Indians were able to use growing plants. During 
the winter some use was made of bark and buds of trees. I found the 
Indians putting great emphasis upon the eating of the organs of the 
animals, including the wall of parts of the digestive tract. Much of the 
muscle meat of the animals was fed to the dogs. It is important that 
skeletons are rarely found where large game animals have been slaugh￾tered by the Indians of the North. The skeletal remains are found as 
piles of finely broken bone chips or splinters that have been cracked up 
to obtain as much as possible of the marrow and nutritive qualities of 
the bones. These Indians obtain their fat-soluble vitamins and also most 
of their minerals from the organs of the animals. An important part of 
the nutrition of the children consisted in various preparations of bone 
marrow, both as a substitute for milk and as a special dietary ration. 
In the various archipelagos of the South Pacific and in the islands 
north of Australia, the natives depended greatly on shell fish and various 
scale fish from adjacent seas. These were eaten with an assortment of 
plant roots and fruits, raw and cooked. Taro was an important factor 
in the nutrition of most of these groups. It is the root of a species of 
lily similar to “elephant ears” used for garden decorations in America 
because of its large leaves. In several of the islands the tender young 
leaves of this plant were eaten with coconut cream baked in the leaf of 
the tia plant. In the Hawaiian group of islands the taro plant is cooked 
and dried and pounded into powder and then mixed with water and 
allowed to ferment for twenty-four hours, more or less, in accordance 
with the stiffness of the product desired. This is called poi. Its use in 
this form was comparable in efficiency with its use on other archipelagos 
as a boiled root served much as we use potatoes. For these South Sea 
Islanders fat-soluble vitamins and many of the minerals were supplied 
by the shell-fish and other animal life from the sea. 
The native tribes in eastern and central Africa, used large quantities 
of sweet potatoes, beans, and some cereals. Where they were living suf￾ficiently near fresh water streams and lakes, large quantities of fish were 
eaten. Goats or cattle or both were domesticated by many tribes. Other tribes used wild animal life quite liberally. Some very unique and ne “5 = fk - Cot rae ;

PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 261 
special sources of vitamins were used by some of these tribes. For ex￾ample, in certain seasons of the year great swarms of a large winged 
insect develop in Lake Victoria and other lakes. These often accumu￾lated on the shores to a depth of many inches. They were gathered, 
dried and preserved to be used in puddings which are highly prized 
by the natives and are well spoken of by the missionaries. Another 
insect source of vitamins used frequently by the natives is the ant 
which is collected from great ant hills that in many districts grow 
to heights of ten feet or more. In the mating season the ants develop 
wings and come out of the ant hills in great quantities and go into the 
air for the mating process. These expeditions are frequently made during 
or following a rain. The natives have developed procedures for inducing 
these ants to come out by covering over the opening with bushes to give 
the effect of clouds and then pounding on the ground to give an imita￾tion of rain. We were told by the missionaries that one of the great 
luxuries was an ant pie but unfortunately they were not able to supply us 
with this delicacy. Parts of Africa like many other districts are often 
plagued by vast swarms of locusts. These are gathered in large quantities, 
to be cooked for immediate use or dried and ground into a flour for 
_later use. They provide a rich source of minerals and vitamins., The 
natives of Africa used the cereals maize, beans, linga linga, millet, and 
Kaffir corn, cooked or roasted. Most of these were ground just before 
cooking. 
Among the Aborigines of Australia we found that those living near 
the sea were using animal life from that source liberally, together with 
the native plants and animals of the land. They have not cultivated the 
land plants during their primitive life. In the interior, they use freely 
the wild animal life, particularly wallaby, kangaroo, smal! animals and 
rodents. All of the edible parts, including the walls of the viscera and 
internal organs are eaten. 
The native Maori in New Zealand, used large quantities of foods from 
the sea, wherever these were available. Even in the inland food depots, 
mutton birds were still available in large quantities. These birds were 
captured just before they left the nests. They developed in the rockeries 
about the coast, chiefly on the extreme southern coast of the South 
Island. At this stage, the flesh is very tender and very fat from the 
gorging that has been provided by their parent. The value of this food 
for the treatment of tuberculosis was being heralded quite widely in 
both Australia and New Zealand. In the primitive state of the islands 
large quantities of land birds were available and because of the fertility 
of the soil and favorable climate, vegetables and fruits grew abundantly 462 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL; DEGENERATION 
in the wild. Large quantities of fern root were used. Where groups of 
the Maori race were found isolated sufficiently from contact with mod￾ern civilization and its foods to be dependent largely on the native foods, 
they selected with precision certain shell-fish because of their unique 
nutritive value. 
A splendid illustration of the primitive Maori instinct or wisdom 
regarding the value of sea foods was shown in an experience we had 
while making examinations in a native school on the east coast of the 
North Islands. I was impressed with the fact that the children in the 
school gave very little evidence of having active dental caries. I asked 
the teacher what the children brought from their homes to eat at their 
midday lunch, since most of them had to come too great a distance to 
return at noon. I was told that they brought no lunch but that when 
school was dismissed at noon the children rushed for the beach where, 
while part of the group prepared bonfires, the others stripped and dived 
into the sea, and brought up a large species of lobster. The lobsters 
were promptly roasted on the coals and devoured with great relish. 
Other sea foods are pictured in Fig. 74. 
The native diet of the tribes living in the islands north of Australia 
consisted of liberal quantities of sea foods. These were eaten with a 
variety of plant roots and greens, together with fruits which grew 
abundantly in that favorable climate. Few places in the world have so 
favorable a quantity of food for sea-animal life as these waters which 
provide the richest pearl fisheries in the world. This is evidence of the 
enormous quantity of shell-fish that develop there. Here, as off the east 
coast of Australia, are to be found some of the largest shell-fish of the 
world. It was a common occurrence to see these shells being used by 
natives for such purposes as water storage and for bath tubs of a size 
approximately that of a wash tub. Australia and New Zealand are near 
enough to the Antarctic ice cap to have their shores bathed with cur￾rents coming from the ice fields, currents which abound in food for sea 
animals. The great barrier reef off the east coast of Australia extends 
north to within a few leagues of New Guinea. Murray Island is near 
the north end of this barrier. The fish in the water at times form such 
a dense mass that they can be scooped into the boats directly from the 
sea. Fishermen wading out in the surf and throwing their spears into the 
schools of fish usually impale one or several. 
The incidence of tooth decay on this island was less than one per cent 
of all of the teeth examined. Another important sea food in these waters 
was dugong, referred to as sea cow in northern waters. This animal is very highly prized but is becoming scarce. We found its meat very much PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 263 
like lamb. It lives on the vegetation of the sea floor in shallow water. 
As we flew over the bays of Eastern Australia going northward in 
search of colonies of native Aborigines, we could see these sea animals 
pasturing in the clear water among the ocean plants. 
During these investigations of primitive races, I have been impressed 
with the superior quality of the human stock developed by Nature 
wherever a liberal source of sea foods existed. These zones of abundant 
marine life were largely in the wake of the ocean currents drifting from 
the ice fields of the poles. The Humboldt Current is probably the most 
liberal carrier of marine life of any of the ocean currents. It leaves the 
ice field of the Antarctic and bathes the west coast of South America 
from its southern tip nearly to the equator, where the coast line changes 
direction and the Humboldt Current is deflected out into the ocean. It 
meets here a warm current coming down from the coast of Central 
America, Panama and Columbia. If the superb physiques that Nature 
has established among the Maori of New Zealand, the Malays of the Is￾lands north of Australia, the Gaelics of the Outer Hebrides and the 
natives on several of the archipelagos of the Pacific, owe their superior 
physical development to sea foods, we should expect to find that the 
tribes which have had contact with the great Humboldt Current food 
would also have superb physiques. Unfortunately, very little has been 
known of the ancient cultures that have developed along the coast of 
Chile and Peru. It has been reported that of all the Indian tribes of 
South America, those in Patagonia were the most stalwart. While the 
west coast of Peru is bathed by the Humboldt Current with its nearly 
inexhaustible supply of human nutrition, the lands bordering that shore 
are among the most desolate deserts of the world. The zone between the 
Andes Mountains and the coast for approximately a thousand miles is ut￾terly barren, consisting of moving sand dunes and jagged promontories. 
Practically the only break in this waterless, treeless desert is to be found 
in the few ribbons of water that trickle down from the melting snows 
of the Andes Coastal Range. This coast has no rainy seasons. Any vege￾tation grown, now or in the past thousands of years, has had to be 
watered from the limited supply afforded by these rivers which seem so 
insignificant when compared with the vastness of the territory. These 
river bottoms contain the alluvial deposits from the Andes and are very 
rich when watered. It has been only by means of gigantic engineering 
undertakings that the water from these rivers has been carried through 
great irrigation ditches, sometimes fifty to a hundred miles long for 
the purpose of making it possible to utilize these river bottom lands for 
agriculture. 264 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
In many of the primitive tribes living by the sea we found emphasis 
on the value of fish eggs and on some animal forms for insuring a high 
physical development of growing children, particularly of girls, and a 
high perfection of offspring through a reinforcement of the mother’s 
nutrition. It is also important to note that in several of the primitive 
tribes studied there has been a consciousness that not only the mothe: 
should have special nutrition, but also the father. In this group very great 
value was placed upon a product obtained from a sea form known lo￾cally as the angelote or angel fish, which in classification is between a 
skate and a shark. The young of the angelota are born alive, ready for 
free swimming and capable of foraging for themselves immediately at 
birth. Twenty to thirty young are born in one litter. The eggs of the 
female before fertilization are about one inch in diameter, slightly 
oval but nearly spherical. They are used as food by all, but the special 
food product for men is a pair of glands obtained from the male. These 
glands weigh up to a pound each, when they are dried. They have a 
recognized value among the natives for treating cases of tuberculosis, 
especially for controlling lung hemorrhages. The sea foods were used in 
conjunction with the land plants and fruits raised by means of irrigation 
in the river valleys. Together these foods provided adequate nutrition 
for maintaining high physical excellence. 
In Chapter 13 I have discussed the probable order of these ancient 
cultures and the possible extent of their duration. Very little is known 
of their origin. Evidence has recently been discovered in Panama in￾dicating that both the wealth and the culture of Peru were carried 
northward by maritime conquerors and that the cultures of Central 
America, including the Maya culture may have had their origins in these 
ancient cultures of Peru. 
While the coastal area of Peru saw the development of many magnifi￾cent cultures through past ages, the highlands of Peru also have left 
much evidence of superior attainments and wisdom. The two great 
Indian linguistic groups of the Andean highlands of today are the 
Aymara of Southern Peru and Bolivia and the Quichus of central and 
northern Peru. The Aymara are credited with being the descendants 
of the Tauhuanocan culture which preceded the Incan culture in the 
highlands. The Quichu are credited with being the descendants of the 
Incan culture which had its zenith just prior to the coming of the 
Spaniards. In Chapter 14 I have shown photographs of these racial stocks 
as they are found today in the Andean Sierras. It may be possible that 
in former times the vast mountain ranges provided large herds of graz￾ing wild animals of the deer family. Because of the vastness of the PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 265 
population and the extent to which all available land surfaces were 
utilized for agriculture, it does not seem possible that wild animal life 
could have been an adequate source of nutrition. The members of the 
camel family, the llamas, alpacas, and vicunas were utilized for food. 
Of these the first two were used to considerable extent as they are 
today. When it is recognized that in the Sierra the available water is 
largely that provided to the streams from the melting snows and from 
rains in the rainy season, it will be realized that these sources of fresh 
water could not provide the liberal quantity of iodine essential for 
human growth and development. It was, accordingly, a matter of great 
interest to discover that these Indians used regularly dried fish eggs from 
the sea. Commerce in these dried foods is carried on today as it no doubt 
has been for centuries. When I inquired of them why they used this 
material they explained that it was necessary to maintain the fertility 
of their women. I was informed also that every exchange depot and 
market carried these dried fish eggs so that they were always available. 
Another sea product of very great importance, and one which was uni￾versally available was dried kelp. Upon inquiry I learned that the Indians 
used it so that they would not get “big necks” like the whites. The kelp 
provided a very rich source of iodine as well as of copper, which is very 
important to them in the utilization of iron for building an exception￾ally efficient quality of blood for carrying oxygen liberally at those high 
altitudes. An important part of their dietary consists today as in the 
past of potatoes which are gathered and frozen, dried and powdered, and 
preserved in the powdered form. This powder is used in soups with Ilama 
meat and other products. Since the vitamin D group of activators is 
absent from nearly all plant products but must be synthesized in animal 
bodies from the plant foods, where it is largely stored in organs, an 
adequate source had to be provided. The Indians of the highlands of 
Peru maintained colonies of guinea pigs which were used in their stews. 
The ancient burials also show that the guinea pig was a common source 
of food since mummified bodies of this animal were found. This is 
significant since of all the animals that are used for experimental work 
the guinea pig is probably the most efficient in synthesizing vitamin D 
from plant foods. They are very hardy. They live on a great variety of 
green plant foods and twigs and are very prolific. They apparently 
played a very important part in the physical excellence of the ancient 
cultures. 
It is unfortunate that as the white man has come into contact with 
the primitives in various parts of the world he has failed to appreciate 
the accumulated wisdom of the primitive racial stocks. Much valuable 266 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
wisdom has been lost by this means. I have referred to the skill of the 
Indians in preventing scurvy and to the many drugs that we use which 
the white man has learned of from the primitives. 
In this connection the Indians of British Columbia, who have been 
so efficient in preventing scurvy, have a plant product for the preven￾tion and cure of diabetes. This has recently become known to the white 
man through the experience of a patient who was brought into the 
\ hospital at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, as reported in the Canadian 
Medical Journal, July 1938. Prince Rupert is near the boundary between 
British Columbia and Alaska on the coast. The patient came to that 
hospital for an operation and suddenly showed signs of diabetes, which 
required treatment with large doses of insulin. Dr. Richard Geddes 
Large asked him regarding the history of his affection and what he had 
been taking. He was told that for several years he had been using an In￾dian preparation which was a hot water infusion of a root of devil’s-club_ 
_ which is a spiny, prickly shrub. This medicine was in common use by 
‘the British Columbia Indians. The material was obtained and used in 
this hospital for the treatment of diabetes and was found to be quite as 
efficient as insulin and had the great advantage that it would be taken 
by mouth whereas the insulin which is destroyed in the stomach by the 
process of digestion must be injected. They could see very little dif- 
_ ference in the efficiency of this preparation whether taken internally or 
used hypodermically. This promises to be a great boon to a large group 
of individuals suffering from diabetes. It is also probable that its use 
will prevent the development of diabetes and since the Indians used it 
for other affections it may also become a very important adjunct in 
modern preventive medicine. 
One of the sources that I have found to be helpful in studying primi￾tive races is an investigation of knapsacks. I have asked for the privi￾lege of seeing what is carried in their knapsacks. I found dried fish eggs 
and dried kelp in the knapsacks in the high Andes. It is also of interest 
that among this group in the Andes, among those in central Africa, 
and among the Aborigines of Australia, each knapsack contained a ball 
of clay, a little of which was dissolved in water. Into this they dipped 
their morsels of food while eating. Their explanation was to prevent 
“sick stomach.” This is the medicine that is used by the native in these 
countries for combating dysentery and food infections. It is the treat- ment that was given me when I developed dysentery infection in cen- tral Africa while making studies there. The English doctor in Nairobi whom I called in said he would give me the native treatment of a suspension of clay. It proved very effective. An illustration of the way PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 267 
) in which modern science is slowly adopting practices that have been 
long in use among primitive races, is to be found in the recent exten￾sive use that is made of clay (kaolin) in our modern medicine. This is illustrated in the following:® 
In the course of an expedition to Lake Titicaca, South America, financed by 
the Percy Slade Trustees in which one of us (H.P.M.) took part, an interesting 
observation was made in regard to the diet of the Quetchus Indians on the 
Capachica Peninsula near Puno. These people are almost certainly descendants 
of the Incas and at the present time live very primitively. They exist largely 
on a vegetable diet of which potatoes form an important part. Immediately, 
before being eaten, the potatoes are dipped into an aqueous suspension of clay, 
a procedure which is said to prevent “‘souring of the stomach.” 
We have examined this clay and found it to consist of kaolin containing a 
trace of organic material, possibly coumarin, and presumably a decomposition 
product of the grass from underneath which the clay is dug. The local name 
for the clay is Chacco, and the Indians distinguish between good and bad qualities. 
This dietetic procedure is universal among the Indians of the Puno district, and 
is probably of very ancient origin. 
Such a practice by a primitive people would appear rather remarkable in 
view of the comparatively recent introduction of kaolin into modern medicine 
as a protective agent for the gastric and intestinal mucosa and as a remedy — 
for bacterial infections of the gut. . . 
It is of interest that both the British and American Pharmacopeias 
have added kaolin to their list during the last two decades. 
The Indians of the past buried, with their dead, foods to carry them 
on their journey. From an examination of these one learns that in many 
respects the Indians living in the high Sierras are living today very much 
as their ancestors did during past centuries. Items of importance now 
and in the past are parched corn and parched beans which are nibbled 
as the people walk along carrying their heavy burdens. Today these are 
the only foods eaten on many long journeys. We found the parched 
beans pleasant to taste and very satisfying when we were hungry. 
The Indians of the Amazon Basin have had a history very different 
from either those of the high Sierras of the Andes or those of the coastal 
region. The fact that vast areas of the Amazon Basin have not only never 
been surveyed, but never even penetrated, indicates the nature of the 
isolation of these groups. Very little progress has been made in the 
effort to conquer or modernize these Indians. A few explorers have 
made expeditions into parts of the interior and have reported the 
characteristics of the plant and animal life, as well as of the native races. 
Our sole contact was with the tribe which came to the coffee plantation 268 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
to assist in the gathering and the harvest of the coffee beans. In Chap￾ter 14 I have described these people in considerable detail. Since the 
Amazon Basin has vast quantities of rain as well as abundant streams 
from the eastern watershed of the Andes, the tribes live largely in tropical 
jungles where there is an abundance of water. They are expert, accord￾ingly, in the use of river crafts and in fishing for the various types of 
marine life. Unlike the Indians of the high Andes or of the coast regions 
they are not agriculturists. They live on wild native foods almost en￾tirely. They are expert with the blow gun, with the bow and arrow and 
in snaring with both nets and loops. They use very large quantities of 
a tuber root called yucca which has many qualities similar to the roots 
of the edible variety of the lily family. This plant is boiled and eaten 
much as are potatoes. They use also large quantities of fish from the 
streams, birds and small animals of the land, together with the native 
fruits including bananas. Their dietary provides a very liberal supply of 
minerals and vitamins together with an adequate quantity of carbo￾hydrates, fats and proteins. 
In evaluating the nutritive value of the dietary programs of primitive 
races and our modernized cultures, it is important that we have a yard￾stick adequately adjusted to make computation in terms of specific body 
needs for building good bodies and maintaining them in good health. 
The advance in modern chemistry has gone far toward making this 
possible. 
The problem of estimating the mineral and activator contents, in 
other words the body-building and repairing qualities of the displacing 
foods used by the various primitive races, is similar in many respects to 
estimating these qualities in the foods used in our modern white civiliza￾tions, except that modern commerce has transported usually only the 
foods that will keep well. These include chiefly white flour, sugar, 
polished rice, vegetable fats and canned goods. 
Very important data for typical American dietaries are now available 
provided by the Bureau of Home Economics, United States Department 
of Agriculture, and also by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States 
Department of Labor. These surveys provide a basis of estimating the 
nutrition of various income groups both with regard to the type of foods selected in our American communities and the quantities of each type used, together with the chemical content of these foods expressed quantitatively. Those who wish to have detailed reports are referred to the bulletins of the above departments. In my clinical studies of the mineral constituents of individuals, affected with dental caries and other disturbances of physical deficiency, I find a wide range of variation in PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 269 
the calcium, phosphorus and fat-soluble activator content of the dietaries 
used, although in general the calorie content is adequate. This latter 
factor is controlled by appetite. These computations reveal that the 
individuals studied have a calcium intake ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 
grams; and a phosphorus intake of from 0.3 to 0.6 grams. The minimum 
adult requirements as provided by such an authority as Sherman, whose 
figures are used by the United States Department of Labor, are for the 
average adult 0.68 of a gram of calcium and 1.32 grams of phosphorus 
per day. It can be seen readily that the amounts given above are far 
short of the minimum even if individuals absorbed from the foods all 
of the minerals present. A question arises at this point as to the efficiency 
of the human body in removing all of the minerals from the ingested 
foods. Extensive laboratory determinations have shown that most people 
cannot absorb more than half of the calctum and phosphorus from the 
foods eaten. The amounts utilized depend directly un the presence of 
other substances, particularly fat-soluble vitamins. It is at this point 
probably that the greatest breakdown in our modern diet takes place, 
namely, in the ingestion and utilization of adequate amounts of the 
special activating substances, including the vitamins needed for render￾ing the minerals in the food available to the human system. 
A recent report by the Council on Foods of the American Medical 
Association* makes this comment on spinach: 
Spinach may be regarded as a rich source of vitamin A and as a contributor 
of vitamin C, iron and roughage to the diet. It is therefore a valuable food. 
(But) the iron is not well utilized by infants... Gad) the feeding of spinach 
is of no value during early infancy as a source of calcium, 
Even though calcium is present in spinach children cannot utilize it. 
Data have been published showing that children absorb very little of 
the calcium or phosphorus in spinach before six years of age. Adult 
individuals vary in the efficiency with which they absorb minerals and 
other chemicals essential for mineral utilization. It is possible to starve 
for minerals that are abundant in the foods eaten because they cannot be 
utilized without an adequate quantity of the fat-soluble activators. 
This is illustrated in the following case. A minister in an industrial 
section of our city, during the period of severe depression, telephoned 
me stating that he had just been called to baptize a dying child. The 
child was not dead although almost constantly in convulsions. He 
thought the condition was probably nutritional and asked if he could 
bring the boy to the office immediately. The boy was badly emaciated, 
had rampant tooth decay, one leg in a cast, a very bad bronchial cough 270 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
and was in and out of convulsions in rapid succession. His convulsions 
had been getting worse progressively during the past eight months. His 
leg had been fractured two or three months previously while walking 
Fic. 93. This figure shows the rapid healing of a fractured femur of a boy four and one￾half years of age suffering from convulsions due to malnutrition. His fracture occurred 
when he fell in a convulsion. There was no healing in sixty days. After reinforcing his 
nutrition with butter vitamins the healing at the right occurred in thirty days. Whole 
milk replaced skim milk and a whole wheat gruel made from freshly ground whole wheat 
replaced white bread. 
across the room when he fell in one of his convulsions. No healing had 
occurred. His diet consisted of white bread and skimmed milk. For 
mending the fracture the boy needed minerals, calcium, phosphorus and PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 271 
magnesium. His convulsions were due to a low calcium content of the 
blood. All of these were in the skimmed milk for the butter-fat removed 
in the cream contains no calcium nor phosphorus, except traces. The 
program provided was a change from the white flour bread to wheat 
gruel made from freshly ground wheat and the substitution of whole 
milk for skimmed milk, with the addition of about a teaspoonful of a 
very high vitamin butter with each feeding. He was given this meal 
that evening when he returned to his home. He slept all night without 
a convulsion. He was fed the same food five times the next day and did 
not have a convulsion. He proceeded rapidly to regain his health without 
recurrence of his convulsions. In a month the fracture was united. 
Two views of the fracture are shown in Fig. 93, one before and one 
after the treatment. Six weeks after this nutritional program was 
started the preacher called at the home to see how the boy was getting 
along. His mother stated that the boy was playing about the doorstep, 
but they could not see him. She called but received no answer. Presently 
they spied him where he had climbed up the downspout of the house to 
the second story. On being scolded by his mother, he ran and jumped 
over the garden fence, thus demonstrating that he was pretty much of a 
normal boy. This boy’s imperative need, that was not provided in white 
bread and skimmed milk, was the presence of the vitamins and other 
activators that are in whole milk but not in skimmed milk, and in 
whole wheat, freshly ground, but not in white flour. He was restored 
to health by the simple process of having Nature’s natural foods re￾stored to him. 
This problem of borrowing from the skeleton in times of stress may 
soften the bones so that they will be badly distorted. This is frequently 
seen as bow legs. An illustration of an extreme condition of bone soften￾ing by this process is shown in Fig. 94, lower section, which is the 
skeleton of a monkey that was a house pet. It became very fond of 
sweets and was fed on white bread, sweetened jams, etc., as it ate at the 
same table with its mistress. Note that the bones became so soft that the 
pull of the muscles distorted them into all sorts of curves. Naturally its 
body and legs were seriously distorted. In this condition my patient, 
whom I was serving professionally, asked me for advice regarding her 
monkey’s deformed legs and distorted body. I suggested an improved 
nutrition and provided fat-soluble vitamins consisting of a mixture of 
a high vitamin butter oil and high vitamin cod liver oil with the result 
that minerals were deposited on the borders of the vertebrae and joints 
and on the surfaces of the bones as shown in the illustration. This of BSUS gs SEN : > J 
Fic. 94. This boy, age 5, had suffered for two and one-half years from inflammatory 
rheumatism, arthritis and heart involvement. Upper left shows limit of movement of neck, 
left wrist, swollen knees and ankles. The middle upper view shows the change in six 
months after improvement of his nutrition, and at right his change in one year. Below is 
shown the gtossly demineralized and deformed skeleton of a pet monkey being fed on 
sweets and pastries. PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 273 
course, could not correct the deformity and the animal was chloro- formed. 
The necessity that the foods selected and used shall provide an ade￾quate quantity of fat-soluble activators (including the known fat￾soluble vitamins) is so imperative and is so important in preventing a 
part of our modern degeneration that I shall illustrate its need with 
another practical case. 
A mother asked my assistance in planning the nutritional program 
for her boy. She reported that he was five years of age and that he had 
been in bed in hospitals with rheumatic fever, arthritis and an acute 
heart involvement most of the time for the past two and a half years. 
She had been told that her boy would not recover, so severe were the 
complications. As is so generally the case with rheumatic fever and endo￾carditis, this boy was suffering from severe tooth decay. In this connec￾tion the American Heart Association has reported that 75 per cent of 
heart involvements begin before ten years of age. My studies have shown 
that in about 95 per cent of these cases there is active tooth decay. The 
important change that I made in this boy’s dietary program was the 
removal of the white flour products and in their stead the use of freshly 
cracked or ground wheat and oats used with whole milk to which was 
added a small amount of specially high vitamin butter produced by 
cows pasturing on green wheat. Small doses of a high-vitamin, natural 
cod liver oil were also added. At this time the boy was so badly crippled 
with arthritis, in his swollen knees, wrists, and rigid spine, that he was 
bedfast and cried by the hour. With the improvement in his nutrition 
which was the only change made in his care, his acute pain rapidly 
subsided, his appetite greatly improved, he slept soundly and gained 
rapidly in weight. In the first view,,to the left, in Fig. 94, the boy is 
shown sitting on the edge of the bed at the end of the first month on 
this program. His joints were still badly swollen and his spine so rigid 
that he could not rotate his head farther than shown in the picture. In 
the center view he is shown about six months later, and in the third view, 
one year later. This occurred six years ago. As I write this a letter has 
been received from the boy’s mother. She reports that he is taller and 
heavier than the average, has a good appetite and sleeps well. 
In the newer light regarding the cause of rheumatic fever, or inflam￾matory rheumatism (discussed in Chapter 21) there appear to be three 
underlying causes: a general lowered defense against infection in which 
the fat-soluble vitamins play a very important part; minute hemor￾rhages in joint tissues as part of the expression of deficiency of vitamin C, 
a scurvy symptom, and a source of infecting bacteria such as strepto- 274 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
coccus. This could be provided by his infected teeth. These typical ex￾pressions of modern degeneration could not occur in most of the primi-. 
tive races studied because of the high factor of safety in the minerals and 
vitamins of their nutrition. It is important to emphasize the changes that 
were made in our modern dietary program to make this boy’s nutrition 
adequate for recovery. Sugars and sweets and white flour products were 
eliminated as far as possible. Freshly ground cereals were used for breads 
and gruels. Bone marrow was included in stews. Liver and a liberal supply 
of whole milk, green vegetables and fruits were provided. In addition, he 
was provided with a butter that was very high in vitamins having been 
produced by cows fed on a rapidly growing green grass. The best source 
for this is a pasturage of wheat and rye grass. All green grass in a state of 
rapid growth is good, although wheat and rye grass are the best found. 
Unless hay is carefully dried so as to retain its chlorophyll, which is a pre￾cursor of vitamin A, the cow cannot synthesize the fat-soluble vitamins. 
These two practical cases illustrate the fundamental necessity that 
there shall not only be an adequate quantity of body-building minerals 
present, but also that there shall be an adequate quantity of fat-soluble 
vitamins. Of course, water-soluble vitamins are also essential. While I 
have reduced the diets of the various primitive races studied to definite 
quantities of mineral and calorie content, these data are so voluminous 
that it will not be appropriate to include them here. It will be more 
informative to discuss the ratios of both body-building and repairing 
material in the several primitive dietaries, in comparison with the dis￾placing foods adopted from our modern civilization. The amount of 
_ food eaten by an individual is controlled primarily by the hunger factor 
which for our modernized groups apparently relates only to need for 
heat and energy. The dietaries adopted have all been built on the basis of 
the heat and energy requirements of the body for the groups living in 
the several districts and under their modes of life. These have been cal- 
/ culated for the principal foods eaten by the various groups. The figures 
will be published in detail in a more technical report. There are two 
simple ways in which these comparisons can be made. One is in terms of 
normal body requirements; and the other in terms of the ratio between 
the mineral and the vitamin content of the native foods and the dis￾placing foods. If we use as a basis the ability of individuals to remove 
half of the minerals present even though their bodies need more than 
this, we will be more generous than the average individual’s capacity will 
justify. This will require that we double the amount, as specified for 
minimum body use by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, in their Bulletin R 409, that is, for calcium 0.68 PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 275 
grams; for phosphorus 1.32 grams; for iron 0.015 grams. The figures 
that will be used, therefore, are for twice the above amounts: 1.36 
grams of calcium; 2.64 grams of phosphorus; 0.030 grams of iron. 
Few people who have not been in contact with experimental data on 
metabolism can appreciate how little of the minerals in the food are 
retained in the body by large numbers of individuals who are in need of 
these very chemicals. We have seen that infants cannot absorb calcium 
from spinach. If we are to pyovide nutrition that will include an ade￾quate excess as a factor of safety for overloads, and for such periods as 
those of rapid growth (for children), pregnancy, lactation and sickness, 
we must provide the excess to the extent of about twice the require￾ments of normal adults. It will therefore, be necessary for an adequate 
nutrition to contain approximately four times the minimum require￾ments of the average adult if all stress periods are to be passed safely. 
It is of interest that the diets of the primitive groups which have 
shown a very high immunity to dental caries and freedom from other 
degenerative processes have all provided a nutrition containing at least 
four times these minimum requirements; whereas the displacing nutri￾tion of commerce, consisting largely of white-flour products, sugar, 
polished rice, jams, canned goods, and vegetable fats have invariably 
failed to provide even the minimum requirements. In other words the 
foods of the native Eskimos contained 5.4 times as much calcium as the 
displacing foods of the white man, five times as much phosphorus, 
1.5 times as much iron, 7.9 times as much magnesium, 1.8 times as 
much copper, 49.0 times as much iodine, and at least ten times that 
number of fat-soluble vitamins. For the Indians of the far North of 
Canada, the native foods provided 5.8 times as much calcium, 5.8 times 
as much phosphorus, 2.7 times as much iron, 4.3 times as much mag￾nesium, 1.5 times as much copper, 8.8 times as much iodine, and at least 
a ten fold increase in fat-soluble activators. For brevity, we will apply 
the figures to calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron and fat-soluble 
activators in order. The ratio in the Swiss native diets to that in the 
displacing diet was for calcium, 3.7 fold; for phosphorus, 2.2 fold; for 
magnesium, 2.5 fold; for iron, 3.1 fold; and for the fat-soluble acti￾vators, at least ten fold. For the Gaelics in the Outer Hebrides, the native 
foods provided 2.1 times as much calcium, 2.3 times as much phosphorus, 
1.3 times as much magnesium, and 1.0 times as much iron; and the 
fat-soluble activators were increased at least ten fold. For the Aborigines 
of Australia, living along the eastern coast where they have access to sea 
foods the ratio of minerals in the native diet to those in the displacing 
modernized foods was, for calcium, 4.6 fold; for phosphorus, 6.2 fold; 276 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
for magnesium, 17 fold; and for iron 50.6 fold; while for the fat￾soluble activators, it was at least ten fold. The native diet of the New 
Zealand Maori provided an increase in the native foods over the displac￾ing foods of the modernized whites of 6.2 fold for calcium, 6.9 fold for 
phosphorus, 23.4 fold for magnesium, 58.3 fold for iron; and the fat￾soluble activators were increased at least ten fold. The native diet of the 
Melanesians provided similarly an increase over the provision made in 
the modernized foods which displaced them of 5.7 fold for calcium, 
6.4 fold for phosphorus, 26.4 fold for magnesium, and 22.4 fold for 
iron; while the fat-soluble activators were increased at least ten fold. 
The Polynesians provided through their native diet for an increase in 
provision over that of the displacing imported diets, of 5.6 fold for 
calcium, 7.2 fold for phosphorus, 28.5 fold for magnesium, 18.6 fold 
for iron; and the fat-soluble activators were increased at least ten fold. 
The coastal Indians of Peru provided through their native primitive diets 
for an increase in provision over that of the displacing modernized die* 
of 6.6 fold for calcium, 5.5 fold for phosphorus, 13.6 fold for mag￾nesium, 5.1 fold for iron; and an excess of ten fold was provided for 
fat-soluble vitamins. For the Indians of the Andean Mountains of Peru, 
the native foods provided an increase over the provision of the displacing 
modern foods of 5 fold for calcium, 5.5 fold for phosphorus, 13.3 fold 
for magnesium, 29.3 fold for iron; and an excess of at least ten fold was 
provided for fat-soluble vitamins. For the cattle tribes in the interior of 
Africa, the primitive foods provided an increase over the provision of 
the displacing modernized foods of 7.5 fold for calcium, 8.2 fold for 
phosphorus, 19.1 fold for magnesium, 16.6 fold for iron and at least 
ten fold for fat-soluble activators. For the agricultural tribes in Central 
Africa the native diet provided an increase over the provision of the 
displacing modern diet of 3.5 fold for calcium, 4.1 fold for phosphorus, 
§.4 fold for magnesium, 16.6 fold for iron and ten fold for fat-soluble 
activators. All the above primitive diets provided also a large increase in 
the water-soluble vitamins over the number provided in the displacing 
modern diets. 
| From the data presented in the preceding chapters and in this com￾parison of the primitive and modernized dietaries it is obvious that there 
is great need that the grains eaten shall contain all the minerals and vita￾mins which Nature has provided that they carry. Important data might 
be presented to illustrate this phase in a practical way. In Fig. 95 will be 
seen three rats all of which received the same diet, except for the type of bread. The first rat (at the left) received whole-wheat products freshly ground, the center one received a white flour product and the PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 277

of these rats. Several rats of the same age were in each cage. The feeding 278 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
_ was started after weaning at about twenty-three days of age. The rat at 
the left was on the entire grain product. It was fully developed. The 
rats in this cage reproduced normally at three months of age. The rats 
in this first cage had very mild dispositions and could be picked up by 
the ear or tail without danger of their biting. The rats represented by 
the one in the center cage using white flour were markedly undersized. 
Their hair came out in large patches and they had very ugly dispositions, 
so ugly that they threatened to spring through the cage wall at us when 
we came to look at them. These rats had tooth decay and they were not 
able to reproduce. The rats in the next cage (illustrated by the rat to 
the right) which were on the bran and middlings mixture did not show 
tooth decay, but were considerably undersized, and they lacked energy. 
The flour and middlings for the rats in cages two and three were pur￾chased from the miller and hence were not freshly ground. The wheat 
given to the first group was obtained whole and ground while fresh in 
a hand mill. It is of interest that notwithstanding the great increase in 
ash, calcium, phosphorus, iron and copper present in the foods of the last 
group, the rats did not mature normally, as did those in the first group. 
This may have been due in large part to the fact that the material was 
not freshly ground, and as a result they could not obtain a normal vita￾min content from the embryo of the grain due to its oxidation. This is 
further indicated by the fact that the rats in this group did not repro￾duce, probably due in considerable part to a lack of vitamins B and E 
which were lost by oxidation of the embryo or germ fat. 
There is a misapprehension with regard to the possibility that humans 
may obtain enough of the vitamin D group of activators from our mod￾ern plant foods or from sunshine. This is due to the belief viosterol or 
similar products by other names, derived by exposing ergosterol to ultra￾violet light, offer all of the nutritional factors involved in the vitamin D 
group. I have emphasized that there are known to be at least eight D 
factors that have been definitely isolated and twelve that have been 
reported as partially isolated. 
Coffin has recently reported relative to the lack of vitamin D in com￾mon foods as follows:° 
1. A representative list of common foods was carefully tested, by approved 
technique, for their vitamin D content. 
2. With the remote possibility of egg yolks, butter, cream, liver and fish 
it is manifestly impossible to obtain any amount of vitamin D worthy of 
mention from common foods. 
3. Vegetables do not contain vitamin D. Cy

PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 279 
It will be noted that vitamin D, which the human does not readily 
synthesize in adequate amounts, must be provided by foods of animal 
tissues or animal products. As yet I have not found a single group of 
primitive racial stock which was building and maintaining excellent 
bodies by living entirely on plant foods. I have found in many parts 
of the world most devout representatives of modern ethical systems advo￾cating the restriction of foods to the vegetable products. In every in￾stance where the groups involved had been long under this teaching, I 
found evidence of degeneration in the form of dental caries, and in the 
new generation in the form of abnormal dental arches to an extent very 
much higher than in the primitive groups who were not under this influ￾ence. 
Many illustrations might be presented showing the special wisdom of 
the primitives in the matter of reinforcing their nutrition with protec￾tive foods. 
_ Few people will realize how reluctant members of the primitive races 
_ are, in general, to disclose secrets of their race. The need for this is com￾parable to the need for secrecy regarding modern war devices. 
The Indians of the Yukon have long known the cure for scurvy and 
history makes an important contribution to their wisdom in treating 
this disease. It is of interest that W. N. Kemp® of Vancouver states: 
The earliest recorded successful treatment of scurvy occurred in Canada in 
1535 when Jacques Cartier, on the advice of a friendly Indian, gave his scurvy￾prostrated men a decoction of young green succulent ‘shoots’ from the spruce ° 
trees with successful results. These happy effects apparently were not ap- 
\ preciated in Europe, for scurvy continued to be endemic. 
Since that time untold thousands of mariners and white land dwellers 
| have died with this dreaded disease. 
| Shortly before our arrival in Northern Canada a white prospector 
had died of scurvy. Beside him was his white man’s packet of canned 
foods. Any Indian man or woman, boy or girl, could have told him how 
| to save his life by eating animal organs or the buds of trees. 
Another illustration of the wisdom of the native Indians of that far 
‘north country came to me through two prospectors whom we rescued 
and brought out with us just before the fall freeze-up. They had gone 
into the district, which at that time was still uncharted and unsurveyed, 
to prospect for precious metals and radium. They were both doctors of 
‘engineering and science, and had been sent with very elaborate equip￾ment from one of the large national mining corporations. Owing to the 
‘inaccessibility of the region, they adopted a plan for reaching it quickly. 
ee 
| 1 i } 280 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
They had flown across the two ranges of mountains from Alaska and 
when they arrived at the inside range, i.e., the Rocky Mountain Range, 
they found the altitude so high that their plane could not fly over the 
/range, and, as a result, they were brought down on a little lake outside. 
| The plane then returned but was unable to reach the outside world be- 
| cause of shortage of fuel. The pilot had to leave it on a waterway and 
| trudge over the mountains to civilization. The two prospectors under- 
| took to carry their equipment and provisions over the Rocky Mountain 
_ Range into the interior district where they were to prospect. They found 
_ the distance across the plateau to be about one hundred miles and the 
_ elevation ranging up to nine thousand feet. While they had provisions 
_ and equipment to stay two years they found it would take all of this 
time to carry their provisions and instruments across this plateau. They 
accordingly abandoned everything, and rather than remain in the coun￾try with very uncertain facilities and prospects for obtaining food and 
shelter, made a forced march to the Liard River with the hope that some 
expedition might be in that territory. One of the men told me the fol￾lowing tragic story. While they were crossing the high plateau he nearly 
went blind with so violent a pain in his eyes that he feared he would 
go insane. It was not snow blindness, for they were equipped with glasses. 
It was xeropthalmia, due to lack of vitamin A. One day he almost ran 
into a mother grizzly bear and her two cubs. Fortunately, they did not 
attack him but moved off. He sat down on a stone and wept in despair 
of ever seeing his family again. As he sat there holding his throbbing 
head, he heard a voice and looked up. It was an old Indian who had been 
tracking that grizzly bear. He recognized this prospector’s plight and 
while neither could understand the language of the other, the Indian 
after making an examination of his eyes, took him by the hand and led 
him to a stream that was coursing its way down the mountain. Here as 
the prospector sat waiting the Indian built a trap of stones across the 
stream. He then went upstream and waded down splashing as he came 
and thus drove the trout into the trap. He threw the fish out on the bank 
and told the prospector to eat the flesh of the head and the tissues back 
of the eyes, including the eyes, with the result that in a few hours his 
pain had largely subsided. In one day his sight was rapidly returning, 
and in two days his eyes were nearly normal. He told me with profound 
| emotion and gratitude that that Indian had certainly saved his life. 
Now modern science knows that one of the richest sources of vitamin 
A in the entire animal body is that of the tissues back of the eyes includ￾ing the retina of the eye. 
In Chapter 18 I refer to the work of Wald on studies of vitamin A PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED DIETARIES 281 
tissues. He states that extracts of eye tissue (retina, pigment, epithelium, 
and choroid) show the characteristic vitamin A absorption band and 
that they are potent in curing vitamin A deficient rats. He shows also 
that the concentration of vitamin A is constant for different mammals. 
I have been impressed to find that primitive racial stocks in various 
parts of the world are familiar with the fact that eyes constitute an in￾valuable adjunct for nutrition. Even the one time cannibals of the Fiji 
Islands, and the hereditary king of the Fiji Islands, told me in detail of 
the practices with regard to the use of eyes as an adjunct to diet. The 
chief, his father, and grandfather had the privilege of reserving the eyes 
of captives for their personal use. When among the natives of the islands 
north of Australia, I learned to enjoy greatly fish head soup made from 
certain selected tissues. After the fish had been cleaned the heads were 
split and the eyes left in. 
The space of the entire book might be used for discussing the nutri￾tional wisdom of the various primitive races. It is a pity that so much of 
their wisdom has been lost through lack of appreciation by the whites 
who early made contact with them.

PRIMITIVE CONTROL OF DENTAL CARIES 
dle essential differences in the diets of the primitive races and those 
of the modernized groups have been discussed in the preceding 
chapter. We are concerned now with discovering whether the use of 
foods, which are equivalent in body-building and repairing material to 
those used by the primitives will, when provided to our affected modern￾ized groups, prevent tooth decay or check it when it is active. 
There are two approaches to this problem of the control of tooth decay 
by nutritional means. One is by the presentation of clinical results and 
the other by the consideration of the characteristics of those nutritional 
programs which have been successful in producing a high immunity to 
tooth decay. 
We may divide the primitive racial stocks into groups, classified ac￾cording to the physical environment in which they are living and the 
manner in which: the environment largely controls their available foods. 
It is significant that-I have ; as yet found no group that was building and 
maintaining good bodies exclusively on plant foods. A number of groups 
are endeavoring to do so with marked evidenee. of failure. The variety of 
animal foods available has Jaremgely™ in some" groups, and been lim￾ited among others. i 
In thespreceding chapter we five seen that the successful dietaries 
included'in, addition to a liberal source of mineral’, carbohydrates, fats, 
proteins, and Water=s luble vitamins, a source of fat-soluble vitamins. 
Vitamin D is not found®in.plants, but must be sought in an animal 
food. The dietaries of the efficientprimitive racial stocks may be divided 
into groups on this basis: in thesfirst ‘place those obtaining their fat￾soluble activators, which include the“known fat-soluble vitamins, from 
efficient dairy products. This includes the Swiss in the high Alps, the 
Arabs (using camel’s milk), and the Asiatic races (using milk of sheep 
and musk ox). In the secondyplace there are those using liberally the 
organs of animals, and the opoeot Birds, wild and domesticated. These 
include the Indians of the far North, the buffalo hunting Plains Indians 
and the Andean tribes. In the third place there are those using liberally 
animal life of the sea. These include Pacific Islanders and coastal tribes 
282 PRIMITIVE CONTROL OF DENTAL CARIES 283 
\\throughout the world. In the fourth place there are those using small 
animals and insects. These include the Australian Aborigines in the in￾terior, and the African tribes in the interior. 
Many of the above groups use foods from two or more sources. Each 
of the groups has provided an adequate quantity of body-building ma￾terial from both animal and plant tissues. It does not matter what the 
source of minerals and vitamins may be so long as the supply is adequate. 
In our modern life, the location of a group will determine the most effi￾cient and most convenient source for obtaining the essential foods. 
Clearly, for those near the coast, the sea may be most convenient, while 
for those in the interior or in the far North, dairy products or the 
organs of animals may be the only available source. It would be fortu￾nate indeed, if our problems were as simple as this statement might indi￾cate. We have, however, in the first place, the need for a strength of 
character and will power such as will make us use the things our bodies 
require rather than only the foods we like. Another problem arises from 
the fact that our modern sedentary lives call for so little energy that 
many people will not eat enough even of a good food to provide for 
both growth and repair, since hunger appeals are for energy only, the 
source of heat and power, and not for body-building minerals and other 
chemicals. Still another problem confronts us, i.e., the sources of fat￾soluble activators indicated above, namely: dairy products, organs of 
animals and sea foods, may vary through a wide range in their content 
of the fat-soluble activators or vitamins, depending upon the nutrition 
available for the animals. Cows fed on third grade hay, too low in caro￾tene, not only cannot produce strong calves but their milk will not 
keep healthy calves alive. (Chapter 18.) 
The League of Nations’ Committee on Nutrition has estimated the 
amount of pasture land required per capita to provide adequate milk 
and meat. Owing to the density of population and cost of land near 
large cities, it is not possible to provide an adequate acreage for dairy 
cattle. This results in stall feeding of shipped fodder. Only those cows 
can be kept in a herd whose production of milk and butter fat can pay 
in volume for their keep. Unfortunately milk may have a high cream 
line or butter fat content and still be low in essential fat-soluble vita￾mins. This constitutes an exceedingly important phase of our modern 
problem. Butter ships best when hard and this quality can be largely 
controlled by the fodder given to the cattle and hence becomes an im￾portant factor in the wholesale butter industry. Since 1927, I have been 
analyzing samples of dairy products, chiefly butter, from several parts 
of the world for their vitamin content. These samples are received every 284 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
| two to four weeks from the same places, usually for several years. They 
all show a seasonal rise and fall in vitamin content. The high level is al￾ways associated with the use of rapidly growing young plant food. This 
tide in plant life, fluctuating with the seasons, controlled the migration 
of the buffalo southward in the autumn and winter and northward in 
the spring. They moved at the rate of about twelve miles per day, trav- 
_ elling with the sun in order to provide the highest-vitamin milk for the 
young calves born in the south. No doubt these tides in nutrition con￾trol also the migration of birds. By far the most efficient plant food that 
I have found for producing the high-vitamin content in milk is rapidly 
growing young wheat and rye grass. Oat and barley grass are also ex￾cellent. In my clinical work small additions of this high-vitamin butter 
to otherwise satisfactory diets regularly checks tooth decay when active 
and at the same time improves vitality and general health. 
Similarly the value of eggs for providing fat-soluble vitamins depends 
directly upon the food eaten by the fowl. The fertility of the eggs also 
is a direct measure of the vitamin content, including vitamin E. 
Since the sea foods are, as a group, so valuable a source of the fat￾soluble activators, they have been found to be efficient throughout the 
world not only for controlling tooth decay, but for producing a human 
stock of high vitality. Unfortunately the cost of transportation in the 
_ fresh state often constitutes a factor limiting distribution. Many of the 
| primitive races preserved the food value, including vitamins, very efh￾ciently by drying the fish. While our modern system of canning pre- 
/ vents decomposition, it does not efficiently preserve some of the fat￾soluble activaters, particularly vitamin A. 
Since the organs, particularly the livers of animals, are storage depots 
of the vitamins an important source of some of the fat-soluble activators 
can be provided by extracting the fat of the livers and shipping it as liver 
oils. Modern methods of processing have greatly improved the quality of 
these oils. There are some factors, however, which can be provided to 
great advantage for humans from dairy products of high efficiency. 
I have shown in the preceding chapter the quantities of several of the 
minerals that are essential in suitable chemical form to maintain an adult 
in good health and make possible tissue repair. The dietaries of the vari￾ous primitive groups have all been shown to have a mineral content 
several times higher than that which obtains in the inadequate food 
eaten by modernized primitives and the people of our modernized cul- tures. 
Modern commerce has deliberately robbed some of nature’s foods of much of their body-building material while retaining the hunger satis- PRIMITIVE CONTROL OF DENTAL CARIES _ 285 
fying ene:gy factors. For exam ple, in the production of refined white 
flour approximately eighty per cent or four-fifths of the phosphorus and 
calcium content are usually removed, together with the vitamins and 
miinera): provided in the embryo or germ. The evidence indicates that 
a very important factor in the lowering of reproductive efficiency of 
womar.hood is directly related to the removal of vitamin E in the proc￾essing of wheat. The germ of wheat is our most readily available source 
of that vitamin. Its role as a nutritive factor for the pituitary gland 
in the base of the brain, which largely controls growth and organ func￾tion, apparently is important in determining the production of mental 
types. Similarly the removal of vitamin B with the embryo of the wheat, 
together with its oxidation after processing, results in depletion of body￾building activators. 
Refined white sugar carries only negligible traces of body-building and 
repairing material. It satisfies hunger by providing heat and energy be￾sides having a pleasant flavor. The heat and energy producing factors in 
our food that are not burned up are usually stored as fat. In the preceding 
chapter we have seen that approximately half of the foods provided in 
our modern dietaries furnish little or no body-building or repairing ma￾terial and supply no vitamins. Approximately 25 per cent of the heat 
and energy of the American people is supplied by sugar alone which 
goes far in thwarting Nature’s orderly processes of life. This per capita 
use is unfortunately on the increase. Therefore we must begin by radi￾cally reducing the foods that are so deceptive, and often injurious in 
overloading the system. Even this much change in our modern nutrition 
will raise the factor of safety sufficiently to check tooth decay in a large 
percentage of people. It will not, however, be adequate for most chil￾dren in whom the additional demands of rapid growth must be satisfied. 
I have found the highest incidence of tooth decay in the high school 
and boarding school girls, and the next in the boarding school boys. 
These groups suffer even more than the childbearing mothers, 
In discussing the technical aspects later I shall consider the defensive 
factors in the saliva as controlled by the nutrition through the blood 
stream, and also the role of oral prophylaxis. 
It is appropriate at this point to note some characteristics of a decay- 
' ing tooth. The process of tooth decay never starts from within but al￾ways from without and is most likely to start at the contact points 
between the teeth or in the pits and grooves, especially when these are 
incompletely formed. Teeth never have caries while they are covered 
with flesh but decay most easily soon after eruption, when conditions are 
/ unfavorable. If the saliva is normal the surfaces of the teeth progressively 286 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
harden during the first year after eruption. While there are many the￾ories regarding the relative importance of different factors in the proc￾ess of decay practically all provide for a local solution of the tooth sub￾stance by acids produced by bacteria. The essential difference in the 
process. The primitive approach has been to provide a program that will 
keep the teeth well, that is, prevention of dental caries by adequate 
food combinations. I have just stated that teeth harden after eruption if 
various theories of tooth decay is the difference in theories relative to the 
control of these decalcifying organisms, and relative to their quantity 
and activity. The dental profession has been waiting for decades for 
this question to be solved before taking active steps to prevent the whole 
the saliva is normal. This occurs by a process of mineralization much like 
the process by which petrified wood is produced. 
The tooth is made up of four structures. The first is the pulp within, 
which carries blood vessels and nerves. This structure is surrounded in 
both the root and crown by the dentine or tooth bone which is nour￾ished from within. The dentine of the root is covered by cementum 
which receives nourishment from the membrane which attaches the 
root to the jaw bone. The dentine of the crown or exposed part of the 
tooth is covered with enamel. Tooth decay proceeds slowly through the 
enamel and often rapidly in the dentine, always following the minute 
channels toward the pulp, which may become infected before the decay 
actually reaches the pulp to expose it; nearly always the decay infects 
the pulp when it destroys the dentine covering it. When a tooth has 
a deep cavity of decay, the decalcified dentine has about the density of 
rotten wood. With an adequate improvement in nutrition, tooth decay 
will generally be checked provided two conditions are present: in the 
first place, there must be enough improvement in the quality of the sa￾Of course, if the decay is removed and a filling placed in the cavity, the 
liva; and in the second, the saliva must have free access to the cavity. 
bacteria will be mechanically shut out. One of the most severe tests of 
a nutritional program, accordingly, is the test of its power to check tooth 
decay completely, even without fillings. There are, however, two fur￾ther tests of the sufficiency of improvement of the chemical content 
of the saliva. If it has been sufficiently improved, bacterial growth will 
not only be inhibited, but the leathery decayed dentine will become 
mineralized from the saliva by a process similar to petrification. Note 
that this mineralized dentine is not vital, nor does it increase in volume 
and fill the cavity. When scraped with a steel instrument it frequently 
takes on a density like very hard wood and occasionally takes even a glassy surface. When such a tooth is placed in silver nitrate, the chemical PRIMITIVE CONTROL OF DENTAL CARIES 287 
does not penetrate this remineralized dentine, though it does rapidly 
penetrate the decayed dentine of a tooth extracted when decay is active. 
This process is illustrated in Fig. 96 which shows two deciduous teeth ex￾Cia i us os oo - om

tracted from the same child, one before, and the other a few months 
after improving the nutrition. These deciduous molars were replaced 
by the bicuspids of the second dentition. The tooth at the left had deep 
caries and was removed before the treatment was begun. Note that the 
silver nitrate has blackened the tissue to the depth of the decay. The 
tooth at the right was removed about three months after the nutrition 
was changed. Note that the decayed dentine is so dense that the silver 
nitrate has not penetrated deeply and discolored it. 
There is still another test that demonstrates Nature’s protective mech￾anisms. Ordinarily, when the pulp of a tooth is exposed by dental caries, 
the pulp becomes not only infected, but dies opening up a highway of 
infection direct from the infected mouth to the inside of the fort at the 
end of the root. One expression of this is a dental abscess, the existence 
of which is usually unknown to the individual for sometime and the 288 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
infecting germs pass more or less freely throughout the body by way of 
the blood stream and lymph channels. This infection may start the 
degeneration of organs and tissues of other parts of the body. 
Among some of the primitive races, whose nutritional programs pro￾vided a very high factor of safety, even though the teeth were worn 
down to the gum line and into what was formerly the pulp chamber, 
the pulp was not exposed. Nature had built a protecting zone, not in the 
cavity of the tooth in this case, but within the pulp chamber. This en￾tirely blocked off a threatened exposure and kept the walls of the fort 
sealed against bacteria. This process does not occur in many instances in 
people of our modern civilization. Pulp chambers that are opened by 
wear provide exposed pulp which becomes infected with subsequent 
abscess formation. If a reinforced nutrition as efficient as that of many 
of the primitive races, is adopted, the pulp tissue will seal up the opening 
made by decalcification of the dentine, by building in a new layer of 
normal dentine which is vital and quite unlike the petrified decay ex￾posed to the saliva, thus completely walling off the impending danger. 
This is illustrated in Fig. 97 with three cases. At the left are shown x-rays 
of teeth of three children in one of my experimental clinics in a poor 
district in Cleveland. The pulp chambers and pulp tissues of the root 
canals are shown as dark streaks in the center of the tooth. The very 
large cavities which had decalcified the tooth to the pulp chamber are 
shown as large dark areas in the crown. Temporary fillings had to be 
placed because of pain produced by the pressure of food on the pulp 
below the decayed dentine. After the nutrition was improved, the tissues 
of the pulp built in secondary dentine thus reincasing itself in a closed 
chamber. This process is shown in each of the three cases presented in 
Fig. 97, in the views to the right. 
Under the stress of the industrial depression the family dietary of 
the children shown in Fig. 97 was very deficient. They were brought 
to a mission where we fed them one reinforced meal at noon for six days 
a week. The home meals were not changed nor the home care of the teeth. 
The preliminary studies of each child included complete x-rays of all of 
the teeth, a chemical analysis of the saliva, a careful plotting of the po￾sition, size and depth of all cavities, a record of the height, and weight, 
and a record of school grades, including grades in deportment. These 
checks were repeated every four to six weeks for the period of the test, 
usually three to five months. It is important to note that the home nu- trition which had been responsible for the tooth decay was exceedingly low in body building and repairing material, while temporarily satisfy- ing the appetite. It usually consisted of highly sweetened strong coffee ERIMITIVETCON TROL, OF DENTAL CARIES” 259

dental caries by building a protecting wall within the pulp chamber when the nutrition 
is adequately improved. 290 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
and white bread, vegetable fat, pancakes made of white flour and eaten 
with syrup, and doughnuts fried in vegetable fat. 
The nutrition provided these children in this one meal included the 
following foods. About four ounces of tomato juice or orange juice and 
a teaspoonful of a mixture of equal parts of a very high vitamin natural 
cod liver oil and an especially high vitamin butter was given at the be￾ginning of the meal. They then received a bowl containing approxi￾mately a pint of a very rich vegetable and meat stew, made largely from 
bone marrow and fine cuts of tender meat: the meat was usually broiled 
separately to retain its juice and then chopped very fine and added to 
the bone marrow meat soup which always contained finely chopped 
vegetables and plenty of very yellow carrots; for the next course they 
had cooked fruit, with very little sweetening, and rolls made from freshly 
ground whole wheat, which were spread with the high-vitamin butter. 
The wheat for the rolls was ground fresh every day in a motor driven 
coffee mill. Each child was also given two glasses of fresh whole milk. 
The menu was varied from day to day by substituting for the meat stew, 
fish chowder or organs of animals. From time to time, there was placed 
in a two quart jar a helping similar to that eaten by the children. This 
was brought to my laboratory for chemical analysis, which analysis 
showed that these meals provided approximately 1.48 grams of calcium 
and 1.28 grams of phosphorus in a single helping of each course. Since 
many of the children doubled up on the course, their intake of these 
minerals was much higher. I have shown in the preceding chapter that 
the accepted figures for the requirements of the body for calcium and 
phosphorus are 0.68 grams of calcium and 1.32 grams of phosphorus. 
It is obvious that this one meal a day plus the other two meals at home 
provided a real factor of safety. Clinically this program completely 
controlled the dental caries of each member of the group. 
The chemical analysis of the saliva’? revealed a marked improvement 
which progressively increased. At the beginning of the test the average 
for the group showed a very low factor of safety, so low that we should 
expect tooth decay to be active. In six weeks the average changed to a 
condition which we should expect would be accompanied by a cessation 
of tooth decay. The saliva factor of safety continued to improve for five 
months at which time the special program was discontinued for the summer. 
Several incidents of special interest occurred. Two different teachers came to me to inquire what had been done to make a particular child change from one of the poorest in the class in capacity to learn to one PRIMITIVE CONTROL OF DENTAL CARIES 291 
of the best. Dental caries is only one of the many expressions of our mod￾ern deficient nutritions. 
I have referred to the importance of a high vitamin butter for provid￾ing the fat-soluble activators to make possible the utilization of the 
minerals in the foods. In this connection, it is of interest that butter 
constitutes the principal source of these essential factors for many prim￾itive groups throughout the world. In the high mountain and plateau 
district in northern India, and in Tibet, the inhabitants depend largely 
upon butter made from the milk of the musk ox and the sheep for these 
activators. The butter is eaten mixed with roasted cereals, is used in tea, 
and in a porridge made of tea, butter and roasted grains. In Sudan Egypt, 
I found considerable traffic in high vitamin butter which came from the 
higher lands a few miles from the Nile Basin. This was being exchanged 
for and used with varieties of millet grown in other districts. This but￾ter, at the temperature of that area, which ranged from 90° to 110° 
Fahrenheit, was, of course, always in liquid form. Its brilliant orange 
color testified to the splendid pasture of the dairy animals. The people 
in Sudan, including the Arabs, had exceptionally fine teeth with ex￾ceedingly little tooth decay (Chapter 9). The most physically perfect 
people in northern India are probably the Pathans who live on dairy 
products largely in the form of soured curd, together with wheat and 
vegetables. The people are very tall and are free of tooth decay. 
Probably every housewife is familiar with the low melting quality 
_of the butter produced in early summer when the cows have been put 
on the green pastures. This is particularly true of butter that has the 
grassy flavor and the deep yellow to orange color. This butter is usually 
several times as high in fat-soluble activators including vitamins A and 
D as butter produced from stall fed cattle or cattle on poorer pasturage. 
In Chapter 15, I have explained why this butter is not favorable for ship￾ping and why dairymen so frequently give the cows a ration that will 
produce less of these qualities. One of the principal foods used for accom- 
_plishing this is made of cotton seed meal and cereals. 
There are many illustrations of the low efficiency of this type of fod￾der for providing vitamins essential for dairy products. In one of the 
recent severe droughts in the Mississippi Valley several thousand cattle 
were shipped to Ohio for water and green pasture as a means of saving 
their lives. They were fed enroute on concentrates said to consist of cot￾ton seed meal and grain. Professor Oscar Erf of the Department of 
Dairying of Ohio State University has given me the following detailed 
information: 292 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
With reference to the cattle from the south-western and central-northern 
states of the drought area which were brought into Ohio in the fall of 1935 
on a 600 acre farm north of Delaware, will say that I had the privilege of 
viewing some of these cattle previous to the time that they were brought to 
Ohio in 1935. Because of the extreme drought period and the hot sun, it was 
rare to see green grass on the prairies. The sedges were nearly all dried up. The 
tumbleweed was about the only thing that was available for the cattle in some 
instances. The corn was dried up and very little green was in evidence. In the 
particular location that I was in we found the cattle suffering terribly. Many 
had infected eyes. 
. There were a good many deaths on the plains which were literally dried up. 
Sometimes there was even a small amount of decomposition after death. In 
the fall, those that survived on the plains, were loaded up and driven to the 
corrals, loaded into cars and sent east. Only the good ones were loaded and even 
a large number of these passed out in transit. 
I was informed that the crop of grass the year before was very scant. Con￾sequently, a large number of calves were born with weak eyes and these were 
the early ones to pass out on the plains. The low vitality of the individuals 
which I considered was due to the lack of vitamin A or the green grass factors 
was the cause of the serious infection, however their being secondary to the 
primary cause. 
The first train load of the twenty-eight hundred cattle that were brought 
to this ranch were fed on green corn stalks. There was a nine acre patch of 
corn in this area. The fences were taken down one afternoon at 3 o’clock and 
by 9 o’clock there was no evidence of stubbles or roots. This had all been eaten 
in a very short space of time. We had quite a time getting hays and green stuff 
which we demanded because of its carotin content and its green grass factor. 
There was not enough grass available in the beginning so we had to buy about 
400 tons of hay a day to keep the animals fed. They got no grain of any kind 
because it was a question of bringing the cattle to a more or less normal condi￾tion with no intention of fattening the animals. 
After they had made arrangements for feeding operations and made feed racks 
in sufficient numbers, we went over the herd to estimate the numbers that were 
blind and had sore eyes, which I assume from past experience, was due to a 
vitamin A deficiency. As near as we can estimate, nearly 812 animals were 
affected (29 per cent). There were 157 calves born and approximately 50 per 
cent were deformed and not normal. We did not get the complete figures but 
they probably ranged a little higher than that. The worst infected cows were calves and animals that were 18 to 20 months old. I could not get the story of these individuals but they must have been in the area of dry grass for 2 years. 
There was a slight improvement in those that were not seriously infected after 
they were fed here. They improved decidedly in October and November and 
were practically all slaughtered before the middle of December. PRIMITIVE CONTROL OF DENTAL CARIES 293 
The milk of these vitamin deficient cows would not properly nourish 
either their calves or human beings. 
Many children have tooth decay even while using whole milk, in part 
because the milk is too low in vitamin content, due to the inadequacy 
of the food given the cows. The means for improving this condition 
have been discussed in Chapter 15. 
Some of the current theories of the chemistry of tooth decay place the 
‘responsibility on the local condition in the mouth as affected by the con￾tributing factors provided by sugars and starches which enhance the 
growth of acid producing organisms. A phase of this has been closely 
related to the slogan that a clean tooth cannot decay. Among the diffi￾culties in applying this interpretation is the physical impossibility of 
keeping teeth bacteriologically clean in the environment of the mouth. 
Another difficulty is the fact that many primitive races have their teeth 
smeared with starchy foods almost constantly and make no effort what￾soever to clean their teeth. In spite of this they have no tooth decay. In 
many of the primitive groups that I have studied the process of mod￾ernization includes teaching oral hygiene and prophylaxis. Yet, even 
with the addition of this important adjunct to health, they have in most 
cases lost their immunity to tooth decay and dental caries has become 
active. This will be seen in many of the illustrations of the primitive 
races in the preceding chapters. Of course everyone should clean his 
teeth, even the primitives, in the interest of and out of consideration for 
others. 
In my clinical work I have sought for extreme cases of active tooth 
decay in order to test the primitive wisdom. Many of these cases have 
been furnished by members of the dental profession in other cities and 
states. By the simple procedure of studying the nutrition of the indi￾vidual, obtaining a sample of saliva for analysis, seeing x-rays of the 
individual’s teeth and supporting bone, and getting a history of the sys￾temic overloads, I have been able to outline a nutritional program 
which, in well above 90 per cent of the cases has controlled the dental 
caries. Improvement in the condition of the teeth has been confirmed by 
later x-rays and reports by the patients’ dentists. In a few cases where I 
had contact with the patients only through correspondence the cooper￾ation was not adequate for accomplishing complete improvement. While 
it is true that there is a marked difference in the susceptibility of differ￾ent individuals to dental caries, even those who would ordinarily be 
classed as highly susceptible, have generally received permanent benefit 
from the treatment. 
These principles of treatment have now been applied to many hun- 294 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
dreds of patients as indicated by the fact that over 2,800 chemical analy￾ses of the saliva have been made. The dietary programs that have been 
recommended have been determined on the basis of a study of the nutri￾tion used by the patient, the data provided by the x-rays, from the saliva 
analysis and case history. The diets have been found to be deficient in 
minerals, chiefly phosphorus. Fat-soluble vitamins have been deficient 
in practically every case of active tooth decay. The foods selected for 
reinforcing the deficient nutritions have always included additional fat￾soluble vitamins and a liberal source of minerals in the form of natural 
food. Human beings cannot absorb minerals satisfactorily from inor￾ganic chemicals. Great harm is done, in my judgment, by the sale and 
use of substitutes for natural foods. 
One of our greatest difficulties in undertaking to apply the wisdom of 
the primitives to our modern problems involves a character factor. The 
Indians of the high Andes were willing to go hundreds of miles to the 
sea to get kelp and fish eggs for the use of their people. Yet many of our 
modern people are unwilling to take sufficient trouble to obtain foods 
that are competent to accomplish the desired results. 
Jobbers and middlemen as well as supply depot managers want but￾ter sold in accordance with its label rather than in accordance with its 
vitamin content. One large distributor whom I asked to cooperate by 
maintaining a stock of high-vitamin butter to which I could refer peo￾ple, told me frankly that he wished I would stop telling people about 
the difference in the vitamins in butter. He did not wish them to think 
of butter in terms of its vitamin content. Another large concern told me 
that when I had worked up a sufficiently large market they would be￾come interested in supplying the demand. I counsel people to put in 
storage some of that butter which has the grassy flavor and which melts 
easily and is produced when the cows go onto the rapidly growing young 
grass. Unfortunately, cows that have been on a stable fodder low in 
carotene and under the stress of gestation often are so depleted in their 
own body vitamins that it takes them three or four weeks to replenish 
their own bodies when they get on good pasture. Then the vitamins 
will appear in liberal quantity in their milk. This has made it necessary 
for me to assist many patients in obtaining a supply by analyzing butter 
for its vitamin content and then putting this material in storage and 
making it available for special cases as needed. 
The program that I have found most efficient has been one which in￾cludes the use of small quantities of very high vitamin butter mixed in 
equal parts with a very high vitamin cod liver oil. A simple method of 
preparing the butter is by melting it and allowing it to cool for twenty- PRIMITIVE CONTROL OF DENTAL CARIES 295 
four hours at a temperature of about 70°r., then centrifugalizing it 
which provides an oil that remains liquid at room temperature. When 
this butter oil is mixed in equal parts with a very high-vitamin cod 
liver oil, it produces a product that is more efficient than either alone. 
It should be used within a couple of weeks of the time it is mixed. It is 
desirable that this material be made available in various parts of the 
country. Even the high-vitamin butter produced on the early summer 
growth of grass put in storage and used during the winter will go far 
toward solving our great national problem of shortage of fat-soluble 
vitamins. The quantity of the mixture of butter oil and cod liver oil 
required is quite small, half a teaspoonful three times a day with meals is 
sufficient to control wide-spread tooth decay when used with a diet that 
is low in sugar and starches and high in foods providing the minerals, particularly phosphorus. A teaspoonful a day divided between two or three meals is usually adequate to prevent dental caries and maintain a 
high immunity; it will also maintain freedom from colds and a high level 
of health in general. This reinforcement of the fat-soluble vitamins to a 
menu that is low in starches and sugars, together with the use of bread 
and cereal grains freshly ground to retain the full content of the embryo 
or germ, and with milk for growing children and for many adults, and 
the liberal use of sea foods and organs of animals, produced the result 
described. 
I have previously reported* seventeen cases of extensive dental caries. 
In these patients there were found 237 open cavities of apparently active 
caries. Most of the individuals were between twelve and twenty years 
of age and accordingly had twenty-eight permanent teeth each, or a 
total of 476. It will be noted that if one cavity is allowed per tooth, ap￾proximately half of the total number of teeth were affected, or precisely 
49.7 per cent of all the teeth had open cavities. This group includes 
only persons of whom I have been making critical examination every 
six to twelve months over a three-year period. In practically all cases, 
Roentgen-ray examinations were made in addition to clinical examina￾tions of the teeth. While these persons have been on the reinforced nu￾tritional program during the winter and spring months of the past 
three years, only two new cavities have developed in the group, or 0.4 
per cent. The length of time during which the cavities previously found 
had been developing is not known beyond the fact that all of the pa￾tients were receiving frequent and thorough dental service, most of 
them twice a year and many of them more frequently. It is accordingly 
probable that the cavities found had developed in less than a year. That 
dental caries was not a new problem with these persons was indicated 
ss 296 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
by the very extensive and numerous dental restorations that had been 
made in their mouths. It is, therefore, apparent that 250 times as many 
cavities developed in the period preceding the starting of the nutritional 
program as in the three years following its adoption. If these data were 
reduced. to a yearly basis, the comparison would show a much wider 
variation. 
In a group of fifty persons, including the above mentioned seventeen, 
who had been on the special nutritional program for from one to six 
years, most of them three years or more, only two new cavities devel￾oped. Allowing these persons to have an average of twenty-eight teeth 
per person, or a total of 1,400 teeth, this would represent an incidence 
of dental caries in a period of three years of 0.14 per cent. In this group 
of fifty, there are many instructive and striking cases. 
For example, H. F. did not have a single cavity from October, 1932, 
to June, 1933, while taking additional vitamins and high mineral foods. 
From June, 1933, to May, 1934, while not taking the special vitamins, 
she developed ten new cavities. 
S. K., prior to 1931 had rampant tooth decay with pulps nearly ex￾posed in all first permanent molars. The remaining deciduous teeth had 
been reduced to shells. She was on the special nutritional program from 
December, 1931, to June, 1932, during which time caries was completely 
arrested. She discontinued taking special oil in June, 1932, and did not 
take it again until October, 1933, during most of which time she was 
taking viosterol under a physician’s prescription-to prevent dental caries. 
She came in October, 1933, with fourteen new cavities. She was im￾mediately placed again on the special program, from October, 1933, to 
May, 1934. During this period, the dental caries was completely under 
control. During the time that she was not on the special program, there 
developed on many of the surfaces of the permanent teeth white patches 
of decalcifying enamel. Under the reinforced nutritional program, these 
largely disappeared, and those that did not regain their translucency 
turned dark. 
Among the group of seventeen J. H., sent in from another city, had 
thirty-eight open cavities in June, 1931. In addition to active caries, he 
had quite disturbing heart symptoms, which curtailed his activity, and 
he also had a marked sense of lassitude and weariness. He has been 
on the reinforced nutritional program during the fall, winter and spring 
of each year since that time. During this time, he has not developed a 
single new cavity. The density of all the teeth has progressively improved 
as evidenced by Roentgen-ray records. His physical condition has been 
greatly improved so that he is able to carry on his college activities and |

heavy outside work to earn money to maintain his college expenses. He 
is not conscious of a heart limitation. When asked what the principal 
change was that he had noticed, he said that in addition to not feeling 
tired, he was more rested with six hours’ sleep than formerly with ten 
hours’. 
A. W. had thirty-two new cavities in the two years previous to begin￾ning the special nutritional reinforcement. She continued this regularly 
during the winter and spring months for three years and has not had a 
single new cavity since that time. 
In a group of children whose mothers had the special nutritional rein￾forcement during gestation and lactation and who had been provided 
with the same dietary adjuncts during the winter and spring months of 
infancy and early childhood, not a single carious cavity has developed. 
A number of these children are now in public schools. Their physical 
development is distinctly above that of the average children of their 
age, as is also their efficiency in school work. 
It is important that I emphasize here some dangers that are not usu- ! 
ally recognized or properly emphasized in the literature. When fish oils 
including cod liver oils are given in too large doses to some patients they 
experience quite definite symptoms of depression. The available evidence 
indicates that fish oils that have been exposed to the air may develop 
toxic substances. My work and that of others with experimental animals 
has demonstrated that paralysis can be produced readily by over-dosing. 
Serious structural damage can be done to hearts and kidneys. I have re￾ported this in considerable detail. My investigations have shown that 
when a high vitamin natural cod liver oil is used in conjunction with a 
high vitamin butter oil the mixture is much more efficient than either 
alone.* This makes it possible to use very small doses. Except in the late 
stages of pregnancy I do not prescribe more than half a teaspoonful with 
each of three meals a day. This procedure appears to obviate completely 
the undesirable effects. As stated elsewhere fish oils should be stored in 
small containers to avoid exposure to the air. Rancid fats and oils destroy 
vitamins A and E,° the former in the stomach.°® 
I am frequently reminded that ancient skulls are often found with ex￾tensive dental caries thus disproving that the primitive groups were more 
free from dental caries than the modern groups. It must be kept in mind 
that the fundamental laws of Nature have been in operation as long as 
animals and men have been on the earth. In my investigations among 
primitive races, I have been concerned particularly with the study of 
changes that have taken place both in immunity to dental caries and in 
the environment, including the foods used. It has been important that I LN 
298 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
find large groups with relatively high immunity to dental caries to be 
used as controls. There is great need, accordingly, that additional data 
be provided. Fortunately, this need is being met. There have just come 
to my desk two interesting reports; one, from Dr. Arne Hoygaard" and 
the other from Dr. P. O. Pedersen.*® 
These two distinguished scientists have spent a year in East Greenland 
among the Eskimos in that very barren and isolated region. The per￾centage of teeth found attacked by dental caries among the isolated 
Eskimos of East Greenland is exceedingly low, less than 1 per cent. Where 
the Eskimos were in contact with modernized store foods at the port, 
tooth decay was active. The conditions which they have found were 
apparently not quite so favorable as in the groups I studied in Alaska. 
The Greenland Eskimos apparently are living in a more difficult environ￾ment. The data provided by these investigations are in accord with the 
data I have obtained among isolated Eskimos and other primitive racial 
stocks. Eastern Greenland, by international agreement, is administered 
by the Danish Government and no one is permitted even to visit the 
coast of Greenland without special permission. This permission is very 
difficult to obtain. Even Danish citizens are not free to travel there. We 
are, accordingly, very grateful to Dr. Hoygaard and Dr. Pedersen for 
their contribution from studies made in that protected field. We shall 
look forward with interest to their detailed reports. 
Unfortunately, the public is very much at sea because of the extrava￾gant claims that are made for many of the products advertised over the 
, tadio, in journals, and by door to door solicitation. A dependable and 
| helpful booklet on the vitamin content of foods has been published by 
| the United States Department of Agriculture, Miscellaneous Publica- 
| tions, No. 275. The fact should always be emphasized that foods as 
Nature makes them have much more nutritional value than after they 
are processed so that insect life cannot live on them. When foods cannot 
support insect life they cannot support human life. 
A report has just appeared in the September number of the New 
Zealand Dental Journal by H. H. Tocker on behalf of the Hawkes 
Bay Branch of the New Zealand Dental Association in which he reports 
the results of the application of my suggestions in the Hukarere School 
for native Maori girls at Napier. I have reported my studies there in 
Chapter 12. They used only one part of my suggestions for checking 
the activity of dental caries. The diet of both their control group and 
tested group was the same except for one item, i.e., ‘one heaped. tea￾spoonful twice daily of malt _and cod liver oil.” In a group of sixty-six native girls the thirty-three with the best teeth were used as a control PRIMITIVE CONTROL OF DENTAL CARIES 299 
group. The remaining thirty-three were given the additional fat-soluble 
vitamins. In six months’ time “resistance of this group was raised by 
41.75 per cent” as compared with the control group. The nutrition of 
the test group was not adequately reinforced to obtain the best results. 
There was a marked inadequacy of mineral carrying foods in proportion 
to the energy and heat providing factors in the foods. An adequate 
quantity of such efficient foods should be as readily available today as 
before the white men came to New Zealand. 
It is important to summarize at this point some of the data that ] 
have developed in other chapters because of their direct relation to 
the control of dental caries and other degenerative processes. Since hu￾man life like other animal life has been developed in Nature’s laboratory 
to fit Nature’s natural foods we run a great risk when we undertake to 
modify seriously these foods. Bakers’ so-called whole wheat bread is not 
comparable to Nature’s foods that provide entire wheat and other cereals, 
because of the factors that have been removed from the wheat either 
mechanically or by oxidation. This is so large a problem that adequate 
changes in the available grain foods cannot be made until there is 
sufficient public demand to produce them through the normal channels 
of supply and demand. It is primarily a problem for our Federal and 
State governments. Packaged foods containing dry cereals can undergo 
important changes, even while the material is being processed or while 
in packages on the shelves. The determinations of the loss of vitamins 
in packaged foods as reported in 1938 by the Agricultural Experimental 
Station of Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College, reveal that 
a material loss occurs in two weeks’ time and a very serious loss in one to 
two months’ time in certain stock rations. 
An important source of misapprehension is the literature and teach￾ings of fadists. Such, for example, as the misapprehension of many 
people that they must use only alkaline producing foods and that a 
great danger is associated with the use of acid producing foods. In 
the primitive races I have found practically no difference between the 
acid balance meat diet of the isolated Eskimos of the far north and 
the less acid vegetable and milk diet of other groups as efficient factors 
in control of caries. It is important to keep in mind that our bodies 
have a mechanism for maintaining proper acid and alkali balance in 
the blood and this varies through only a very narrow limit whether the 
balance of the total food eaten is acid or alkaline. It is also important 
to have in mind that there are certain fat-soluble vitamins provided 
in dairy products in adequate quantity that cannot all be supplied in 
fish oils. Also that overdosing with cod liver oil and other fish oils can J whe > LEN $FLO , i]

be definitely detrimental. When packages of cod liver oil are purchased 
from the trade the material should be received in full containers not 
exposed to air and when opened should be transferred to small units 
so it is not progressively oxidized during the period of its use. 
The excess of calories over body building minerals is exceedingly high 
in sweets of various kinds regardless of their special branding and the 
methods of manufacture and storage. There is very little of the body 
building minerals in maple syrup, cane syrup from sugar or honey. 
They can all defeat an otherwise efficient dietary. The problem is not 
so simple as merely cutting down or eliminating sugars and white flour 
though this is exceedingly important. It is also necessary that adequate 
mineral and vitamin carrying foods be made available. It is also necessary 
to realize that many of our important foods for providing vitamins are 
very low in body building material. For example, one would have to eat 
nearly a bushel of apples a day or half a bushel of oranges to obtain a 
liberal factor of safety for providing phosphorus; similarly one would 
be required to eat nine and one half pounds of carrots or eleven pounds 
while this quantity would be provided in one pound of lentils or beans, 
wheat or oats. I have discussed elsewhere the availability of phosphorus 
depending upon its chemical form. Since the calories largely determine 
the satisfying of the appetite and since under ordinary circumstances 
we stop when we have obtained about two thousand to twenty-five 
hundred very little of the highly sweetened fruits defeats our nutritional 
program. We would have to consume daily the contents of thirty-two 
one pound jars of marmalade, jellies or jams to provide a two gram 
intake of phosphorus. This quantity would provide 32,500 calories; an 
amount impossible for the system to take care of. 
Milk is one of the best foods for providing minerals but it may be 
inadequate in several vitamins. Of all of the primitive groups studied 
those using sea foods abundantly appear to obtain an adequate quantity 
of minerals particularly phosphorus with the greatest ease, in part 
because the fat-soluble vitamins provided in the sea foods (by which 
I mean animal life of the sea) are usually high. This enables a more 
efficient utilization of the minerals, calcium and phosphorus. 
As I study routinely the sample dietaries being used by people suffer￾ing from dental! caries, usually associated with other disturbances, I find 
large numbers who are not getting in their food even half the minimum 
requirements of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium and iron and usually only a fraction of the minimum requirements of the fat-soluble vitamins. These latter have a role which in many respects is like the

battery of an automobile which provides the spark for igniting the fuel. 
Even though the tank is filled with gasoline there is no power without the 
igniting spark. 
There are two programs now available for meeting the dental caries 
problem. One is to know first in detail all the physical and chemical 
factors involved and then proceed. The other is to know how to prevent 
the disease as the primitives have shown and then proceed. The former 
is largely the practice of the moderns. The latter is the program suggested 
by these investigations. Available data indicate that the blood and saliva 
normally carry defensive factors which when present control the growth 
of the acid producing organisms and the local reactions at tooth sur- 
_ faces. When these defensive factors are not present the acid producing 
organisms multiply and produce an acid which dissolves tooth structure. 
The origin of this protective factor is provided in nutrition and is 
directly related to the mineral content of the foods and to known and 
unknown vitamins particularly the fat-soluble. Clinical data demon￾strate that by following the program outlined dental caries can be 
prevented or controlled when active in practically all individuals. This 
does not require either permission or prescription but it is the inherent 
right of every individual. A properly balanced diet is good for the entire 
body.

aces are classified on the basis of physical characteristics and ap￾R pearances which identify them as having a common ancestry. The 
constant reproduction of ancestral patterns constitutes one of the funda￾mental laws of heredity. We are concerned here with the divergences 
from the normal course of reproduction. 
The precision with which Nature reproduces widely distributed ‘racial 
stocks demonstrates how deeply seated and controlling are the Mendelian 
laws. In Fig. 98 may be seen four young men of the Melanesian race 
born on four different islands. They have never seen each other, yet 
they look like brothers. Similarly, in Fig. 99 are shown four Polynesian 
girls. Here again they look so much alike that they might readily be 
taken for sisters. Yet, they live in four different groups of Polynesian 
islands; the Hawaiian, the Samoan, the Tahitian, and the Rarotongan. 
The blending of different racial stocks produces typical characteristics 
of either or both ancestral patterns. When, however, marked diver￾gences appear without mixing of racial stocks, the result is not due to 
heredity, but occurs in spite of heredity. In the previous chapters, I have 
shown that in the modernized groups of various primitive racial stocks, 
certain individuals developed marked changes in facial and dental arch 
form from the racial pattern. We are interested to know the nature of 
the forces responsible for this distortion of the ancestral pattern. In a 
study of 1,276 skulls of the ancient civilizations of Peru, I did not find 
one with a typical divergence from normal such as we find in modern 
whites or in children of primitive racial stocks after the parents have 
adopted the foods of our modern civilization. It is important that we 
study this phase in further detail. 
In Fig. 100 are shown two Indian fathers and their sons, whom we 
studied in Peru. The father and son shown above lived at Talara, in a 
highly modernized Indian colony. The father worked in the oil fields 
on the coast. This district is an arid desert into which practically all 
food has to be shipped for the large colony engaged in the oil industry. 
The father was born while his parents were using the native foods of the 
coast, including an abundance of sea foods. The son was born to his

parents after they had adopted the foods of modern civilization. The 
father and son shown below, lived in the high Sierras. The father is an 
Indian descendant of the Incas and was born while his parents were 
living on the native dietary of the high plateau country, near Cuzco. 
After the adoption of the modern foods by the parents, the son shown 
to the right was born. It ?; important to keep in mind that the marked 
change in these fathe:s and sons has occurred in the first generation after 
the parents have adopted the white man’s foods, and has occurred in 
spite of heredity. 
In Fig. 101 above is shown a Wakamba father in central Africa, 
a man who is working for the railroad company which contributed 
largely to the food supply for the laborers. The boy shown at the right 
was born after the parents had adopted the imported foods. In the lower 
picture, in Fig. 101, is seen a Fiji Islander and his son. The father was 
born to parents living on the native foods, and his son was born after 
the adoption of the white man’s foods. All these are typical cases of 
the inhibition of Nature’s normal procedure. We have additional data 
which indicate that our problem is associated with a progressive lowering 
of reproductive capacity on the part of one or both of the parents. 
In photographing the members of modernized families, regardless of 
racial stocks, we frequently find that changes in facial expression appear 
in the younger members of the family. This change in facial contour 
within a family does not occur in the primitive races, while on their 
native dietary. 
In contrast with this we see, in Fig. 102, two sisters and two brothers. 
In each pair there is a marked change in the facial form of the younger. 
The arches and the nostrils of the younger child are narrower and there 
is a marked lack of development in both the middle and lower thirds 
cf the face. 
Very striking illustrations of this progressive degeneration in the 
children of a given family were found among the modernized aborigines 
of Australia. Two views of brothers are shown in Fig. 103 (upper). The 
father and mother of these two boys were born in the Bush. They were 
living, when photographed, in one of the reservations, on the imported 
modern foods which were provided by the government. This is also 
illustrated in the lower photograph. Note the marked underdevelopment 
of the middle third of the face of the girl. 
Striking instances were frequently seen among the modernized Maori 
of New Zealand. Two sisters presenting two extremes of facial form are 
shown in the upper section of Fig. 104. The girl to the left is the older. ONE ORIGIN OF PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES 307

She has the typical tribal pattern which has been completely lost in her 
younger sister to the right. 
If the change in facial form were the result of racial admixture, we 
should not have the types of deformity patterns that these cases show. 
Indeed, in the same family we should not find several different deformity 
patterns. The lack of development, downward of the upper anterior 
incisors and the bone supporting them is illustrated for the younger 
child, in Fig. 103 lower right. It will be noted that when this girl’s 
molar teeth are in contact her front teeth still miss occluding by a con￾siderable distance. 
Members of the white race are affected in a similar manner. In Fig. 
104 (lower) are shown two sisters; the younger to the right reveals 
strikingly the lack of development of the middle and lower third of the 
face. The fact that this condition so frequently shows a progressively 
severe injury in the younger members of the family is a matter of great 
importance in tracing the causative factors. It is important to keep in 
mind that when the injury shows in the face of the young child it 
becomes worse when the adult face forms. This increase in deformity 
occurs at the time of the development of the permanent dentition, at 
from ten to fourteen years of age. 
In the islands north of Australia where contact with modern civiliza￾tion is just being made, the adult individuals showed a constant repro￾duction of the tribal pattern, while those born since contact was made, 
had many divergences from normal. In Fig. 105 will be seen a family of 
six indiv:duals. Four were born before the modern store was put on 
that island and two after the parents had come into contact with the 
influence of the imported foods. It will be seen that the four older broth￾ers show marked uniformity of facial design, and that all have repro￾duced the tribal pattern. The two younger members show definite 
change in facial pattern. This is also illustrated in Fig. 106 above, in 
which the oldest brother was born before the store was put on Badu 
Island, and the three younger, after the establishment of the store 
twenty-three years ago. 
This problem of progressive degeneration in the younger members of 
the family is again illustrated by the group shown in Fig. 107. The 
older girl has reproduced the tribal pattern of the race with normal 
broad, dental arches. The second girl shows marked narrowing and 
lengthening of the face. The third child, a boy, shows very marked diver￾gence from the tribal pattern. This group is shown below with their 
teeth exposed. It will be seen that the oldest girl has broad dental arches 
typical of Nature’s normal design. The second girl has a marked de- ONE ORIGIN OF PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES 311

pression laterally in the molar and bicuspid region producing a narrow￾ing of the palate. The third child has in addition to the narrowing of the 
face a marked deficiency in bone growth so that the cuspids both above 
and below are forced entirely outside the arch. The total circumference 
as well as the breadth of the upper arch is so reduced that space is not 
available for the cuspids. They will be seen imbedded high in the tissue, 
as illustrated in the lower picture of Fig. 106. 
Fig. 108 shows three white girl scouts in New Zealand. Note that 
progressive narrowing of the body including both shoulders and hips 
has occurred in the younger members of the family. This is also shown in 
Fig. 107. 
It would be remarkable if these disturbances in the physical pattern 
were limited to the face and dental arches. An illustration of other 
deficiency injuries is shown in Fig. 109, which shows three children in 
a modernized Maori family. It will be seen that while the oldest girl has 
the typical Maori racial pattern of face, there is a marked lack of 
development of the middle third of the face, with progressive severity 
of distortion in her two younger brothers. On observing the feet it will 
be seen that she has splendidly formed feet while the second child has 
flat feet, and the third child has clubbed feet. 
I have found similar examples in several of the modernized primitive 
racial stocks. The severity of the disturbing factors may be different 
under different circumstances. Drought, industrial depression, unem￾ployment, and the like, all have their influence. In Fig. 110 will be seen 
three Maori children of New Zealand; the second child is smaller in 
stature than the third and gives more evidence of facial injury. While 
his older sister and younger brother have normal feet, his quite severe 
disturbance in facial growth is associated with club feet. 
I have one patient who was the seventh of a family of eleven children. 
All the children in the family have good facial development, except this 
patient. She was born in the midst of a severe financial depression when 
the total amount of money available for the food for the family was 
reduced to a very low level. The other children were born before or 
after the depression, and were not injured. In addition to this patient’s 
severe facial deformity, she has had some arthritis and a general rheu￾matic tendency. Her facial injury is marked and is characterized by a 
lack of development of the middle third. 
Deformities of the feet associated with facial deferens have been found in several modernized groups of primitive racial stocks. A typical case among the modernized Indians of Peru is shown in Fig. 111. The face of this boy shows abnormal development with narrowing of the ONE ORIGIN OF PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES © 317

The serious expressions of physical deformities which we found had 
occurred in several primitive racial stocks, after they have become mod￾ernized sufficiently to be using the foods of our modern civilization, are 
occurring in our modern American families with equal severity and 
great frequency. 
One method for determining the cause of these deformities is through 
an examination of birth and death certificates to note the recorded data 
relative to physical deformities. An outstanding contribution to this 
approach has been made by Dr. D. P. Murphy, of the University of 
Pennsylvania. In an examination of 130,132 individual death certificates 
that have been recorded between 1929 and 1933, he found physical 
deformities recorded in 1,476 cases. Dr. Murphy sent field workers to 
make a personal study of the family histories by contacting the mothers 
or grandmothers, of whom they were able to locate 890. From this 
group he was able to select 405 with sufficiently complete family his￾tories to allow tabulation in a form that would throw light upon the 
birth rank and other data. His studies strongly emphasize the presence 
of a period of low reproductive activity. In concluding one of his reports 
he states:* 
Miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature births occurred more often than 
_ would be expected by chance in the pregnancies immediately preceding and 
immediately following the pregnancy which resulted in the birth of a defective 
child, and less often than would be expected by chance in the remaining preg￾nancies. Miscarriage, stillbirth, and premature birth occurred most often in 
the pregnancy immediately preceding that of the defective child. 
From the above observations, it is concluded that the birth of a congenitally 
malformed child may be only one expression of a prolonged decrease in func￾tional reproductive activity, the other expressions being miscarriages, stillbirths, 
and premature births. 
It is suggested that the obstetrician has unusual reason to suspect the pos￾sible existence of a congenital malformation in the pregnancy which follows 
immediately after a miscarriage, a stillbirth, or a premature birth. 
Shute, of the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, in a 
personal communication, states that he has been impressed, in his studies 
of aborted fetuses, with the large percentage that are malformed. This 322 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
seems to link the malformations with the causative factors which have 
resulted in decreased reproductive activity. 
In connection with the production of imperfect infants, the period 
in the formative process at which the injury occurs and also its origin 
are important. Murphy has thrown important light on this phase in his 
study of the cause of the defectives in forty families with two or more 
malformed.” He concludes: “Many if not most of the congenital mal￾formations met with in this study resulted from defects in the germ 
plasm, which were present before fertilization.” 
Among the important questions that arise is the relative responsibility 
of the two parents. As an approach to this phase Murphy” has made a 
study which deals with a consecutive series of 884 families in each of 
which there appeared at least one congenitally malformed child. In forty 
of these families, there were two or more malformed brothers and sisters. 
He presents extensive data in tabular form from which he takes exam￾ples to illustrate his interpretation. He states under the “Clinical Value 
of Study” the following: 
It is evident from the above data (tables) that there is a strong tendency 
for congenital malformations to duplicate in siblings that belong to a consecu￾tive series of families. And also that such defects tend to appear rather fre￾quently among their more distant relatives. This duplication of malformations 
is to be observed in the case of the more serious types of defects, just as it 
is noticed in the less serious ones. These findings lend support to the theory that 
congenital malformations are primarily the result of influences which affect 
the germ cells prior to, rather than after, fertilization. The validity of this 
theory is emphasized by three examples taken from Tables 1 and m. Family 17 
in Table 1 contained 3 children with pyloric stenosis, two of which were twins. 
Family 6 in Table 1 possessed 2 siblings with cleft palate, conceived by the 
same father, but born to different mothers. Family 8 in Table m contained 2 
children both exhibiting an absence of the right half of the diaphragm. It does 
not seem likely that such sequences of events as these could be the result of any 
forces that did not operate until after fertilization had taken place. . 
Since, as has been shown in a previous report, congenital malformations are 
24 times more common in siblings of defective children than in the population 
at large, the present observations should be of added clinical interest. 
Summary and Conclusions 
1. A consecutive series of 40 families having 2 or more congenitally mal￾formed children has been studied with respect to the duplication of 
defects in siblings. 
2. The defect observed in the first malformed child reappeared in a subse￾quent malformed sibling in about 50 per cent of all cases; the 50 per cent 
remaining including all other possible defects. ONE ORIGIN OF PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES — 323 
3. In a second group of 39 consecutive families, in which a malformed child 
possessed a malformed relative, the malformation in the child and in 
the relative were identical in about 41 per cent of cases. 
4. In 19 non-consecutive families with 2 or more malformed children, the 
defect of the first child repeated in a subsequent child in over half of the 
families. 
It is significant that while these important factors are just coming 
to light in our modernized civilization, the evidence clearly indicates 
that several so-called primitive races have been conscious of the need for 
safeguarding motherhood from reproductive overloads which would 
reduce the capacity for efficient reproduction. For example, G. T. 
Baden® in his book “Among the Ibos of Nigeria”’ states: 
It is not only a matter of disgrace but an actual abomination, for an Ibo 
woman to bear children at shorter intervals than about three years. . . . The 
idea of a fixed minimum period between births is based on several sound prin￾ciples. The belief prevails strongly that it is necessary for this interval to elapse 
in order to ensure the mother being able to recuperate her strength completely, 
and thus be in a thoroughly fit condition to bear another child. Should a second 
child be born within the prescribed period the theory is held that it must in￾evitably be weak and sickly, and its chances jeopardized. 
Similarly, the Indians of Peru, Ecuador and Columbia have been 
familiar with the necessity of preventing pregnancy overloads of the 
mother. Whiffen* in his book ““North-West Amazons” states: 
The numbers (of pregnant women) are remarkable in view of the fact that 
husbands abstain from any intercourse with their wives, not only during preg￾nancy but also throughout the period of lactation—far more prolonged with 
them than with Europeans. The result is that two and a half years between 
each child is the minimum difference of age, and in the majority of cases it is 
\ even greater. 
It may also be important to note that the Amazon Indians have been 
conscious of the fact that these matters are related to the nutrition of 
both parents. Whiffen states that: 
These Indians share the belief of many peoples of the lower cultures that the 
food eaten by the parents—to some degree of both parents—will have a definite 
influence upon the birth, appearance, or character of the child. 
This problem of the consciousness among primitives of the need for 
spacing children has been emphasized by George Brown’ in his studies 
among Melanesians and Polynesians in which he reports relative to the 
natives on one of the Solomon Islands as follows: 324 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
After the birth of a child the husband was not supposed to cohabit with his 
wife until the child could walk. If a child was weak or sickly, the people would 
say, speaking of the parents, “Ah, well, they have only themselves to blame.” 
These new data have a very important bearing on the problems of 
degeneration in our modern civilization. Since it is true that a racial 
pattern can be changed in a single generation our modern concept and 
teaching with regard to the role of heredity must be modified, in its rela￾tionship to cause and effect. A deformity arising from intercepted hered￾ity is just as truly biologic as a deformity arising from accumulated 
impacts as expressed in heredity. Instead of blaming the past generations 
for the distortions or frailties of our modern generation and thus reliev￾ing our own generation of responsibility these new data indicate that the 
social organization that is creating these divergencies from normal must 
alone accept the responsibility. 
This completely changes some aspects of the theories and practice 
of modern social education. Instead of planning the care and manage￾ment of distorted personality as though the lesion were the result of 
environmental influences upon a normally organized individual, it 
should be looked upon as a distortion affecting one link in the chain of 
heredity which is neither the result of the distortions of previous links 
nor a controlling factor for future links in the chain. The prognosis, in 
other words, while being bad for the individual is not necessarily bad for 
his or her descendants. 
While many of the individuals who have suffered physical distortions 
have apparently practically normal brain development we shall see in 
the following chapter that a certain percentage have so great a disturb￾ance in brain organization that they cannot and should not be consid￾ered as individually responsible for their behavior. 
It is urgent therefore that the data presented in this chapter be looked 
upon as an important key to the progressive degeneration that is taking 
place in many parts of the world under the influence of our so-called 
modern civilization. It is a matter of profound significance that 
the most primitive races were originally able to avoid the physical 
degeneration so general in many communities today. It is also a matter 
of importance that the primitives recognized not only these dangers 
but were conscious of and practiced adequate means for preventing them. They had sufficient character to achieve the ends which they deemed essential. Weakness in character may constitute the greatest barrier in the reorganization and conservation of our modern civilization, ONE ORIGIN OF PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES 325 
Two serious defects from which many individuals in our modernized 
civilization suffer are impacted teeth and the absence of teeth due to their 
failure to develop. It is significant that in the arches of the primitive 
races practically all teeth form and erupt normally, including the third 
molars. In the modernized primitives and among our modern whites 
with deformed dental arches many teeth are impacted and often several 
of the permanent teeth have never formed. The evidence indicates that 
this, like the facial and dental arch deformities is due to an absence of 
vitamin A in the diet of the mother during the gestation period or of one 
or both of the parents prior to conception. The cause is discussed in the 
next chapter.

PRENATAL NUTRITIONAL DEFORMITIES AND 
DISEASE VYPES 
RELATIONSHIP between physical types and certain disease suscep￾AN tibilities has been recognized by diagnosticians for centuries. The 
skill of many physicians in reading intuitively and from external signs 
the nature of their patients’ troubles when these could not be classified 
with precision played an important part in the successful warfare 
against disease in the period preceding the advance in modern laboratory 
technique. For many of the old-time physicians, these constitutional 
qualities were expressed as diathesis. An individual would be recognized 
as having a phthisical diathesis (a susceptibility to tuberculosis). Simi￾larly, the arthritis group had a rheumatic diathesis. While modern science 
has undertaken to express its findings numerically, the problem of 
reducing the diatheses to mathematical formulas has required so many 
overlappings, that it has been impossible to establish definite limiting 
boundaries. 
In my investigations regarding the types of individuals who develop 
rheumatic group lesions as a result of dental focal infections,’ I found 
that individuals could be divided into very definite groups in which 
15.05 per cent with severe lesions belonged to families in which similar 
disease symptoms had occurred. Evidence was disclosed of a systemic 
factor that played a controlling role in determining whether or not 
the individual would be seriously injured from dental focal infections. 
It became very clear that the soil was quite as important a determining 
factor as was the type of infection. This finding led me to broaden the 
scope of my investigations to include a search for control cases that were 
free from the degenerative processes. I was not able to find these controls 
in the clinical material afforded by our modern civilization, and there￾fore extended the search to isolated primitive racial stocks. 
Associated with a fine physical condition the isolated primitive groups 
have a high level of immunity to many of our modern degenerative 
processes, including tuberculosis, arthritis, heart disease, and affections 
of the internal organs. When, however, these individuals have lost this 
high level of physical excellence a definite lowering in their resistance to

the modern degenerative processes has taken place. To illustrate, the 
narrowing of the facial and dental arch forms of the children of the 
modernized parents, after they had adopted the white man’s food, was 
accompanied by an increase in susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis. 
In Fig. 113 will be seen four young people, examined in the tubercu￾losis wards of the Juneau (Alaska) Hospital for Indians and Eskimos. 
All exhibited marked evidence of prenatal injury. Note the cuspids 
erupting outside the line of the arch. The teeth of the upper arch of the 
boy at the upper left, pass inside the teeth of the lower arch. His upper 
arch is so narrow that even a finger could not be passed between the 
lateral walls. These pictures had to be taken with short exposures in the 
poor light of the wards. They reveal, however, the conditions. 
In Figs. 114 and 115 are shown several individuals photographed in 
the tuberculosis hospital in New Zealand. Note the lack of development 
of the middle third of the face and the narrowing and lengthening of 
the face. In several individuals the teeth of the upper arch closed inside 
the teeth of the lower arch, instead of outside, as in normal persons. Here 
again, 100 per cent of the young people with tuberculosis gave evidence 
of injury in the formative period, and 91.2 per cent of the total number 
of patients were found to have disturbed dental arches. 
In Fig. 116 are shown four typical individuals in the tuberculosis 
hospitals in Hawaii; one in Hilo and the other in Honolulu. In each of 
these hospitals 100 per cent of the individuals had abnormal develop￾ment of the face and dental arches. 
While we know many of the factors contributing to the nature of 
diatheses, I have found no data dealing with the forces which determine 
diatheses, except the influence of heredity. The data I am presenting in 
this volume, deal with forces other than heredity. 
An outstanding advance in organizing the data which relate the 
physical characteristics of individuals to their disease susceptibilities has 
been made by the Constitutional Clinic of Columbia University and the 
Presbyterian Hospital of New York, under the able direction of Dr. 
George Draper. He has found it necessary’in order to study man as 
a whole, to view him from four different angles: “his form, his func￾tion, his immunity mechanism and his psychology.” These four at￾tributes he has designated as the “four panels of personality.” Dr. 
Draper has published several communications including two textbooks, 
one entitled, “Human Constitution,”? and the other, “Disease and the 
Man.”? 
Dr. Draper has approached this problem from the data provided in the medical clinics, and therefore, from the characteristics of affected PRENATAL NUTRITIONAL DEFORMITIES 329

individuals, whereas my approach has been through a study of the 
primitive groups and the physical changes and disease susceptibilities 
which occur as a result of their modernization. The similarity of our 
conclusions greatly emphasizes the importance of the findings of each. 
Dr. Draper has emphasized the importance of the face and of the dental 
arches in the general matter of susceptibility to disease. He closes one of 
his chapters, entitled The Relation of Face, Jaws and Teeth to Human 
Constitution and Its Bearing on Disease, as follows: 
The lessons which we have learned from these observations, however, is that 
the face and jaws hold much information of value to the student of the human 
being. As clinicians in the field of internal medicine we have been taught to 
observe the gums and teeth in order to detect possible foci of infection. But 
for the student of clinical organismalism, the teeth and jaws hold much valu￾able information about the total personality. For the worker in the dental 
branch of medicine it would seem that an unusual opportunity is offered for 
extending such observations and correlations. It may very well be that the 
dental student who becomes interested in the relation of the mouth to the 
organism may form a most important link with the responsibilities of internal 
medicine. 
The more we come to view man as a totality, as an organism which func￾tions as a whole and not as a collection of separate elements, the more do all 
the special btanches of medicine become fused with the general concept which 
forms the basis of this discussion, namely, the relation of the human organism 
as a whole to those various reactions of maladjustment with environment which 
we call disease. 
It is clear that a definite association of abnormal facial patterns with 
specific disease susceptibilities exists. From my studies it is also clear 
that these abnormal facial patterns are associated with influences result￾ing from a change in the nutrition of the parents of the individual. We 
are at this point concerned with the forces that underlie these phe￾nomena. 
In approaching this problem as it applies to human beings, much can 
be learned from a study of domestic and wild animals. Until recent years 
it has been common knowledge among the superintendents of large 
zoos of America and Europe that members of the cat family did not 
reproduce efficiently in captivity, unless the mothers had been born in 
the jungle. Formerly, this made it necessary to replenish lions, tigers, leopards and other felines from wild stock as fast as the cages were emptied by death or as rapidly as new stock should be added by en- largement. 
The story is told of a trip to Africa made by a wild animal specialist PRENATAL NUTRITIONAL DEFORMITIES © 333 
from the London zoo for the purpose of obtaining additional lions and 
studying this problem. While in the lion country, he observed the lion 
kill a zebra. The lion proceeded then to tear open the abdomen of the 
zebra and eat the entrails at the right flank. This took him directly to the 
liver. After spending some time selecting different internal organs, the 
lion backed away and turned and pawed dirt over the carcass which he 
abandoned to the jackals. The scientist hurried to the carcass and drove 
away the jackais to study the dead zebra to note what tissues had been 
taken. This gave him the clue which when put into practice has entirely 
changed the history of the reproduction of the cat family in captivity. 
The addition of the organs to the foods of the captive animals born in 
the jungle supplied them with foods needed to make reproduction 
possible. Their young, too, could reproduce efficiently. As I studied 
this matter with the director of a large lion colony, he listed in detail 
the organs and tissues that were particularly selected by animals in the 
wilds and also those that were provided for animals reproducing in 
captivity. He explained that, whereas the price of lions used to be fifteen 
hundred dollars for a good specimen, they were now so plentiful that 
they would scarcely bring fifteen cents. If we observe the parts of an 
animal that a cat eats when it kills a small rodent or bird, we see that it 
does not select exclusively the muscle meat. 
During my biological investigations using animals, I have had barn 
rats gnaw their way into the room where the rabbits were kept and 
kill several animals during a night. On two different occasions, only the 
eyes of the rabbits had been eaten, and the blood may have been sucked. 
On another occasion the brains had been eaten. It was evident that 
these rats had a conscious need for special food elements that were 
provided by these tissues. 
No phases of the problem of physical degeneration can be as important 
as knowledge of the forces that are at work and the methods by which 
they operate. It is clear from the data presented in previous chapters 
that these forces can become operative with sufficient speed to make 
a difference in two generations, one succeeding the other. It is also clear 
from preceding data that these forces originate in the change of the 
nutrition of the parents. 
A chemical analysis of the food (Chapter 15), discloses a marked 
reduction in the intake of some of the vitamins and minerals in individ￾uals who are undergoing a degenerative process. 
Many investigators have presented important data dealing with the 
role of vitamin A in prenatal as well as postnatal growth processes. It 
is known that the eye is one of the early tissues to develop injury from 334 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
the absence of vitamin A, hence the original name for this vitamin war 
the xerophthalmic vitamin. The importance of vitamin A to the eye, and 
the fact that this vitamin is stored in eye tissue have been emphasized 
by several investigations. 
Wald? in discussing vitamin A in eye tissues states: 
Extracts of eye tissue (retina, pigment epithelium and choroid) showed the 
characteristic vitamin A absorption band at 620 mu. with the SbC13 test and 
were also potent in curing vitamin A deficient rats. The concentration of 
vitamin A was very constant for different mammals, at about 20 Y per g. 
dry tissue. Values for frog tissues were much higher. 
This comment is of interest in connection with the observation that 
I have previously quoted regarding the raid of barn rats on the rabbit 
cages in the stress of deep winter. While it has been shown that vitamin 
A is essential for the normal function of eyes, its role in the formation of 
eye tissues has not been clearly understood. Probably the most sensitive 
procedure for testing the depletion of vitamin A in domestic animals 
today is by observing their behavior in semi-darkness. 
Edward Mellanby® has presented important new data dealing with 
vitamin A deficiency and deafness. He states in an abstract of a paper 
read before the Biochemical Society, in London in November 1937, the 
following: 
In previous publications I have shown that a prominent lesion caused by 
vitamin A deficiency in young animals, especially when accompanied by a 
high cereal intake, is degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous sys￾tems. In the peripheral system it is the afferent nerves which are principally 
affected, including the eighth nerve, both cochlear and vestibular divisions. It 
has now been possible to show that vitamin A deficiency produces in young 
dogs degenerative changes in the ganglia, nerves and organs of both hearing 
and balance inside the temporal bone. All degrees of degeneration have been 
produced, from slight degeneration to complete disappearance of the hearing 
nerve. The nerves and ganglion cells supplying the organ of Corti are more 
easily damaged than those of the vestibular division. As might be expected when 
once the spiral ganglion cells have disappeared, additions of vitamin A to the 
diet have no effect, and the organ of Corti remains completely denervated. The 
“inattention” of dogs on these diets which I previously ascribed to cerebral 
defect is undoubtedly due to deafness. It now remains to determine whether 
these results may be extended to explain certain forms of deafness in man. 
The serious effects of deficiency in vitamin A on pregnant rats has 
been investigated and reported by Mason‘® as follows: 
Abnormalities are described in the pregnancies of rats maintained on diets 
deficient in vitamin A in varying degree. Prolongation of the gestation period PRENATAL NUTRITIONAL DEFORMITIES 335 
up to 26 days in severe cases and a long and difficult labour which might last 
2 days and often resulted in death of both mother and young were char￾acteristic. 
Defects due to deficiencies in vitamin A in the diet of dairy animals, 
, (pregnant cows, their offspring and normal calves fed on the milk from 
\those cows) have been reported upon by Meigs and Converse’ as follows: 
h\ 2 : . . In 1932 we reported from Beltsville evidence that farm rations frequently 
fed to calves may be dangerously low in vitamin A, and that milk produced 
by cows fed hay which has lost its green color may be an unsafe source of 
‘vitamin A in the calf ration. This preliminary paper reported results dealing 
with four cows which had been fed over two years on a good grain mixture 
/ \and late-cut low-color timothy hay. Of six calves born of these cows, two 
were dead, one was unable to stand and died shortly after birth, and three 
were both weak and blind. The fact that cows so fed were unable to properly 
nourish their calves before birth led to the question whether the milk from 
these cows might not be deficient for normal growth of calves from other 
cows fed on rations adequate in vitamin A. This preliminary report included 
results on three normal calves fed milk from those cows fed low-color timothy 
hay. The three calves died at fifty-seven, sixty-two, and seventy-one days of 
age, respectively... . 
,/ Since growth, prenatal and postnatal, is related directly to the pi- 
| | tuitary body, we are specially interested in the knowledge available on | 
the functioning of this gland. 
| The work of Barrie* throws important light on this subject. He has 
reported as follows: 
, Partial deficiency of vitamin E as shown in the female rat fed on a diet con￾taining only a trace of vitamin E but which is otherwise complete, results in 
the prolongation of gestation, which may be continued as long as 10 days be￾yond the normal period. The offspring under these conditions are abnormal. 
These young may develop slowly and be thin and undersized in spite of suf￾ficiently profuse lactation, or they may become extremely fat and develop a leg 
weakness and carpopedal spasm about 18 days after birth. Animals of both 
types have thin skulls and short silky fur. Complete E deficiency in the adult 
C also produces the soft fur and imperfectly calcified skull. Partially E deficient 
Y animals occasionally give birth to a litter but fail to lactate. 
The changes observed are similar in several ways to those produced by hypo￾physectomy (surgical removal of pituitary gland). Marked degranulation of 
the anterior pituitary is found in both the abnormal young and the adult sterile 
animals. Lack of vitamin E therefore produces a virtual nutritional hypo￾physectomy in the young rat. 
The inability of various species to complete gestation when vitamin E 
is not provided in adequate quantity has been reported by many investi- 336 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
gators. A. L. Bacharach, E. Allehorne and H. E. Glynn have used their 
study of this factor as a means of estimating the quantity of vitamin E 
in the diet.® They state: 
A diet suitable for work on vitamin E causes female rats, fed on this diet 
from weaning, to show a gestation-resorption rate not significantly differing 
from 100 per cent; when the diet is supplemented with adequate amounts of 
vitamin E, also administered from weaning, the live litter rate does not differ 
significantly from 100 per cent. It is found that, on such a diet, the percentage 
of implantations (conceptions) is markedly different between animals that have 
been submitted to a single gestation-resorption, owing to lack of vitamin E, 
and animals that are mated for the first time. The authors suggest that the 
process of undergoing gestation-resorption brings about some deep-seated 
changes in the reproductive mechanism of the rat, of a kind not hitherto rec￾ognized as characterising the vitamin E deficiency syndrome. 
One of the outstanding changes which I have found takes place in 
the primitive races at their point of contact with our modern civilization 
is a decrease in the ease and efficiency of the birth process. When I visited 
the Six Nation Reservation at Brantford, Ontario, I was told by the 
physician in charge that a change of this kind had occurred during the 
period of his administration, which had covered twenty-eight years 
and that the hospital was now used largely to care for young Indian 
women during abnormal childbirth (Chapter 6). 
A similar impressive comment was made to me by Dr. Romig, the 
superintendent of the government hospital for Eskimos and Indians at 
Anchorage, Alaska. He stated that in his thirty-six years among the 
Eskimos, he had never been able to arrive in time to see a normal birth 
by a primitive Eskimo woman. But conditions have changed materially 
with the new generation of Eskimo girls, born after their parents began 
to use foods of modern civilization. Many of them are carried to his 
hospital after they had been in labour for several days. One Eskimo 
woman who had married twice, her last husband being a white man, 
reported to Dr. Romig and myself that she had given birth to twenty￾six children and that several of them had been born during the night 
and that she had not bothered to waken her husband, but had introduced 
him to the new baby in the morning. 
Sherman,’ who has made many important contributions to our 
knowledge of vitamin A, has shown in a recent communication that an amount of vitamin A sufficient to support normal growth and maintain every appearance of good health in animals, may still be insufficient to meet the added nutritive demands of successful reproduction and lacta- tion. With the failure to reproduce successfully, there usually appears PRENATAL NUTRITIONAL DEFORMITIES 337 
in early adult life an increased susceptibility to infection, and particu￾larly a tendency to lung disease at an age corresponding to that at which 
pulmonary tuberculosis so often develops in young men and women. 
He states, further, that vitamin A must be supplied in liberal proportions 
not only during the growth period but during the adult period as well, 
if a good condition of nutrition and a high degree of health and vigor 
are to be maintained. 
Hughes, Aubel and Lienhardt"! have shown that a lack of vitamin A 
in the diets of pigs has resulted in extreme incoordination and spasms. 
They also emphasize that gilts bred prior to the onset of the nervous 
symptoms either aborted or farrowed dead pigs. 
Hart and Gilbert'> have shown that the symptoms most commonly 
seen in cattle having a vitamin A deficiency are the birth of dead or 
weak calves, with or without eye lesions. They report also a condition of 
newborn calves which simulates white scours, and the development of 
eye lesions in immature animals. 
Hughes’® has shown that swine did not reproduce when fed barley 
and salt, but did so when cod liver oil was added to this food. 
Sure’™* has shown that a lack of vitamin A produces in females a 
disturbance in oestrus and ovulation, resulting in sterility. Further, he 
states, that resorption of the fetus may be produced by lack of vitamin 
A, even on a diet containing an abundance of vitamin E, which is 
known as the anti-sterility vitamin. 
One of the most important contributions in this field has been made 
vy Professor Fred Hale, of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, 
at College Station, Texas. He has shown that many physical deformities 
are readily produced by curtailing the amount of vitamin A in the 
ration of pigs. He produced fifty-nine pigs'’ that were born blind, 
every pig in each of six litters—where the mothers were deprived of 
vitamin A for several months before mating and for thirty days there￾afier. In pigs, the eyeballs are formed in the first thirty days. He found, 
as have several others, that depriving pigs of vitamin A for a sufficient 
period produced severe nerve involvements including paralysis and 
spasms, so that the animals could not rise to their feet. He reported that 
one of these vitamin A deficient pigs that had previously farrowed a 
litter of ten pigs, all born without eyeballs, was given a single dose of cod 
liver oil two weeks before mating. She farrowed fourteen pigs which 
showed various combinations of eye defects, some had no eyes, some had 
one eye, and some had one large eye and one small eye, but all were blind. 
In Fig. 117 I am able through Professor Hale’s kindness, to show 
an eyeless pig and a normal eye of a pig (at the left) and (at the 338 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

serious deformities due to lack of vitamin A in the mother’s diet. Offspring of these blind 
pigs when normally fed had perfect eyes and no deformities. Below, A, at left shows normal

right) a pair of incomplete eyes from a pig born in the litter just men￾tioned. This one dose of vitamin A made possible the partial formation 
of optic nerves and eyeballs. A typical eyeless pig is shown in Fig. 118 
(lower). Note its deformed ears. Among the many physical injuries 
which develop in the pigs born to sows fed on a diet deficient in vitamin 
A are serious defects of the snout, dental arches, eyes and feet. This pig 
was born without eyeballs. It also had club feet and two tumors. In Fig. 
118 (upper right) is shown a pig with cleft palate, and in Fig. 119 
(upper right) one with double hairlip. In Fig. 118 (upper left) 
is shown a boy with cleft palate and defective eyes. One of the very 
important results of Professor Hale’s investigations has been the pro￾duction of pigs with normal eyes, born to parents both of whom had 
no eyeballs due to lack of vitamin A in their mother’s diet. The problem 
clearly was not heredity. Two litters, one containing nine pigs and the 
other eight, which were born to mothers that had been deprived of 
vitamin A before mating and for thirty days thereafter, produced the 
following lesions: All had complete absence of eyeballs; some lacked 
development of the opening of the external ear; others had cleft palate, 
harelip, displaced kidneys, displaced ovaries, or displaced testes. 
It is of interest that in October, 1935, Professor Hale reports that the 
Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was informed that a litter of 
fourteen pigs had been born blind in June, 1935, on a farm at Ralls, 
Texas. Of these, six pigs were raised and brought to the Station for 
further study. The farmer owning the pigs stated that no green feed 
was available on his farm from March, 1934, until May, 1935. It will be 
noted that this condition paralleled the experimental conditions at the 
station under which by restricting vitamin A before and immediately 
after gestation fifty-nine pigs were produced without eyeballs. 
Professor Hale reports that in April, 1935, a litter of seven pigs were 
born blind at McGlean, Texas, which was suffering from drought con￾ditions, similar to those at Ralls. The litter and dam were purchased by 
the Experimental Station. Matings were made between blind pigs. These 
were fed rations containing ample vitamin A, and normal pigs with 
normal eyeballs were produced. Even the mating of a blind son with his 
mother who had produced him when on deficient diet, produced only 
normal pigs when both had ample vitamin A. He states, “If an heredi￾tary factor had been the cause of this congenital blindness, these matings 
would have produced some blind pigs, even if vitamin A were present 
in the ration.” 
The problem of congenital cleft palate has been very embarrassing 
to those parents whose children have been so afflicted. It is of interest 340 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Fic. 118. Upper left: Boy has cleft palate, and harelip. Upper right: Pig has cleft palate,

Fic. 119. Many young of modern domestic animals are born with deformities. At the 
upper left is seen a pup with cleft palate. In two previous litters all the pups were deformed 
and unable to live. At the upper right is one of Professor Hale’s pigs with double harelip. 
Below two blind lambs and one with club foot. 342 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
that breeders of fancy dogs are frequently embarrassed by having this 
problem develop in their kennels or among litters born to parent stock 
obtained from their kennels. 
In Fig. 119 (upper left) I have shown a water spaniel pup with 
cleft palate. This pup was not able to nurse because of the impossibility 
of producing suction without a palate. When fed artificially the milk 
was expelled through the nostrils. The mother had given birth to two 
previous litters all of which were dead at birth or died soon after. Her 
diet had been reinforced with mineral calcium phosphate in tablet form 
hoping to insure normal offspring. This is not nature’s method. 
I am informed by a veterinary that he has experienced trouble with 
harelip, cleft palate or serious facial deformities among dogs that are 
pets in homes where they are lavishly coddled and fed the things they 
like best. He stated that he has more trouble with head defects in bulldog 
pups than any other breed. 
There are few if any problems connected with modern degeneration 
on which so much light is thrown as that supplied by recent investiga￾tions on the problems of paternal responsibility for defects in the off￾spring. There are several reasons for this. Because the mother has the 
sole responsibility for the nourishment of the fetus during the formative 
period and she alone provides the handicaps incident to the process of 
birth, it is very natural that defects are practically all interpreted as 
being associated with these processes. This unfortunately, has been em￾barrassed further by the fact that since distortions in behavior do not 
appear until sometime after birth, normality was largely assumed to be 
present up to the time of their appearance, and therefore of necessity 
would be contributions from the child’s environment. As such they 
would be subject naturally to treatment by applying influences to 
change the mental environment. Hence the entire problem of the role 
of the sex cells through controlling the architecture of the body includ￾ing the brain has been largely overlooked. Very important light is thrown 
on this problem in the data provided on the pup shown in Fig. 120. 
This shows a dachshund pup with cleft palate and a very severe spinal 
deformity. This is not unlike deformities frequently seen, or unlike 
that of the pup shown in Fig. 119. The highly significant circumstance 
is the fact that these same deformities not only appeared also in another 
pup of this same litter but in one pup in each of three other litters about 
the same time. While four mothers were involved these four litters 
were all sired by one father. The paternal responsibility is clearly es￾tablished.

lambs without eyeballs. I am told that in some of the sheep raising 
states quite a number of deformities occur in lambs at birth. One 
writer states: 
These deformities may maintain themselves in any number of ways. We 
have them two-headed, 5 and 6 legs, 2 tails, born without eyes, hermaphro￾dites, born with ribs on one side and any number of such deformities. A 
common deformity in sheep is under-shot and over-shot jaws. This simply 
means that the upper jaw extends farther to the front that the under jaw and 
the front teeth do not meet. This is called over-shot and the reverse is called 
under-shot. 
It will be noted that a common deformity in sheep relates to an 
under-development of either the upper or lower jaw which is one of the 
most common expressions of disturbed development in humans. 
Some illustrations of the deformities that may occur in domestic 
animals are shown in Fig. 121. Above are seen two cows each with an 
extra foreleg attached to the shoulder; below, to the left is shown a 
double-faced calf which also had a cleft palate; to the right a cat with 
deformed legs. 
In corresponding with Professor Hale, I inquired whether they had 
information as to the effect of vitamin A deficiency on the sire. He 
replied, “If we reduced the vitamin A content of the body of the sire, 
he would become sterile and, therefore, we could not try this procedure.” 
The question arises as to what the effect would be of a less severe deple￾tion of vitamin A of both parents. 
It is a very easy matter to place the full responsibility on the mother, 
when defects develop in the children. These data indicate that either 
parent may contribute directly to certain of the defects of the children, 
due to defects in the germ plasm. 
A practical case from my field studies includes a full-blooded Eskimo 
woman who was married twice, the second time to a white man, by 
whom she had several children. She had insisted on selecting and pre￾paring the native foods for herself, though she prepared the white man’s 
imported foods for him. With a total of twenty-six pregnancies she did 
not have any tooth decay. He had rampant tooth decay, and a marked 
abnormality in the development of face and of the dental arches. 
Several of the children had incomplete development of the face and of 
the dental arches. One of the girls who was married had very narrow 
dental arches and nostrils and a typical boyish type of body build. 
Unlike her mother, this girl had a very severe experience in the birth of 
her only child and insisted that she would not take the risk of having 
another. Several daughters have narrow arches. The question arises PRENATAL NUTRITIONAL DEFORMITIES 345

whether the deficient nutrition of the father may have been the con￾tributing factor in the injury of their children. 
New light is being thrown on human problems by animal investiga￾tions. One study that is particularly instructive has been conducted by 
McKenzie and Berliner of the University of Missouri. (Bulletin No. 
265.) The experimental animals -used were sheep. Their studies indi￾cated to them that they could predict the level of fertility of the sire by 
studies made on the seminal fluid. They found that the percentage of 
abnormal spermatozoa increased to 84 per cent under unfavorable 
conditions and reduced to less than 15 per cent under favorable con￾ditions. When the unfavorable conditions characterized by these ab￾normal spermatozoa prevailed the females did not conceive. High 
temperature proved to be an important controlling factor as indicated 
by variation in percentage of abnormal sperm. In one breed the average 
variation was from 2.5 per cent in January to 22 per cent defective in 
August; in another breed from 18 per cent in January to 73 per cent 
defective in August. They also found that the same result could be 
produced in the winter by keeping the sires in heated rooms or by 
applying heat externally. They further found that when the percentage 
of abnormal sperm was high a condition of sterility was apparently es￾tablished. In a personal communication from Professor McKenzie he 
states that their inference is that with a high percentage of abnormal 
sperm the ova either are not fertilized or that fertilization takes place 
and that prenatal death occurs in a certain number of the cases, and 
that there is an appreciable prenatal death loss in sheep, horses, cattle, 
and swine. I have referred to the data presented by Mall indicating 
that 15 per cent of human conceptions in England are expelled as de￾formities in the second and third month of gestation. McKenzie also 
presents data relating to swine in which a sire that showed a high percent￾age of abnormal sperm was bred to two groups of sows of similar breed. 
One was maintained in a barn without access to pasture, the other 
received similar rations plus access to pasture. The group without pas￾ture produced a high percentage of mummies, small litters, and abnormal 
pigs (open abdominal walls with viscera protruding and exposed spine 
in the region of the lumbar vertebrae). The second group on the same 
food with the addition of pasturage produced normally large-size litters 
without mummies. The following year this experiment was repeated reversing the groups of sows and using a similar high percentage of 
defective sperm in the same sire. The same results occurred, with 
the group maintained without access to pasture. This emphasizes the need for the vitamins and minerals that are provided in natural foods, PRENATAL NUTRITIONAL DEFORMITIES 347 
particularly vitamin A and seems to relate to the studies of Hale in 
which the absence of vitamin A produced gross defects. These studies 
on domestic animals strongly emphasize the necessity that both parents 
shall have adequate nutrition before conception occurs and subsequently 
for the mother. 
Until very recently there has been exceedingly little literature dealing 
with the factors contributing to the abnormal development of fetuses in 
either domestic animals or humans. Williams, who is one of the few 
students of this problem as it relates to domestic animals, in referring 
to this phase has commented that there is no treatise in the English 
language on teratology (development of monsters) in domestic ani￾mals.'° He emphasizes that these defects are growing in numbers and 
economic importance. He refers to Burki’s studies in Switzerland indi￾cating that this difficulty has constantly and enormously increased in his 
territory. This veterinary has asked “Are our cows degenerating?” It is 
of interest that a type of deformity commonly recognized among 
veterinaries as a distortion of the head presenting a lack of development 
of the bones of the middle part of the face including the upper jaw is 
commonly called “bull-dog calf.” This is particularly important in 
connection with the frequent human deficiency of lack of development 
in the middle third of the face. Williams emphasizes the common knowl￾edge that Boston bull-dogs are not prolific and because of the difficulty 
of giving birth to their young, some veterinarians resort routinely to 
caesarian section. Fortunately, seriously deformed specimens are seldom 
born alive and usually do not continue to term. Williams states that 
Loje has observed ten grossly deformed calves of a particular type that 
were traced to the same sire; also a series of five with this deformity 
reported by Hutt were traced to one sire. Among the deformities in 
domestic animals cleft palate or absence of palate is very common. 
These studies on domestic animals strongly emphasize two facts; first, 
that deformities among these animals are very similar to those that 
develop in humans, and second, that the defects are largely related to 
the original germ cells and that the male may provide the defect quite 
as well as the female. Several of the primitive races have understood 
and provided against these mishaps. 
Moench and Holt of the Cornell Medical School and New York 
Hospital’? have made important studies on humans and have found a 
very high incidence of sterility when abnormal forms of spermatozoa 
reached 25 per cent. Among the abnormal forms they found one par￾ticular family with a particular type of abnormal sperm reaching 12 per 
cent. Their breeding record was decidedly bad and fetal malformations 348 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
repeatedly occurred. In their group, in 63 sterile matings the men were 
normal 21 times and abnormal 37 times. They listed over 40 difterent 
abnormal or deformed types of sperm. They conclude: 
1. In a normal semen the abnormal sperm heads do not exceed 19 to 20 per 
cent. 
2. When the sperm head abnormalities reach 20 to 23 per cent, impaired 
fertility can be assumed. 
3. When the sperm head abnormalities are above 25 per cent, clinical steril￾ity is usually present. 
An important contribution to the question of the relation of the 
germ cells of the father to the type of defects that are prevalent in his 
family history has been made in recent studies conducted in Germany."* 
Two German surgeons concerned with enforcing the sterilization law in 
Berlin have taken advantage of their opportunities to make an important con￾tribution to the study of fecundity. 
Several studies have been published previously, of the spermatozoa of normal 
men. This book offers a study of the spermatozoa of men who had been diag￾nosed as hereditarily defective. At the time of the operation, the upper part 
of the vas deferens was washed out, and the sperm thus obtained were studied 
in great detail, 20 different types of abnormality being distinguished. 
In their control studied, the normal man is found to produce 19 per cent 
of morphologically defective sperm. By contrast, the chronic alcoholic patient 
produces 75 per cent of defective sperm. 
Previously it has been assumed that as much as 25 per cent or 30 per cent of 
abnormal sperm were a good evidence of lowered fertility if not of sterility. 
But the fertility of these chronic alcoholics was not diminished, the authors 
claim. 
In cases of inherited mental defect, 62 per cent of abnormal sperm were 
produced, accompanied by low fecundity,—as is the case generally with the 
mentally defective male. On the other hand, in hereditary deafness, 62 per cent 
and in hereditary blindness 75 per cent of defective sperm appeared. 
Epilepsy and schizophrenia (dementia praecox) both supposed to be con￾stitutional in origin, show less abnormality of spermatozoa (58 per cent and 
54 per cent respectively) than blindness and deafness. 
The fact that in the past almost the entire emphasis of change in 
physical, mental and moral qualities has been assigned to the forces of 
heredity, strongly emphasizes the lack of information regarding the 
nature of the forces at work and the points at which their influence con￾stitute the determining factors. The data previously presented in this 
chapter dealing with the role of vitamins A and E throw valuable new 
light on this phase. It is important, however, that new data are available PRENATAL NUTRITIONAL DEFORMITIES 349 
dealing with the factors which injure the germ cells and which Tredgold 
has spoken of as “poisoned germ cells.” 
In a personal communication received from Professor T. S. Sutton 
of the College of Agriculture, Ohio State University, he makes the 
following observation: 
For several years we have been interested in the study of the effects of vita￾min A deficiency. Right now our main consideration is the effect of this defi￾ciency on reproduction. We find that a diet low in vitamin A will cause. re￾productive failure, which seems to be caused chiefly by a degeneration of the 
germinal epithelium of the gonad. This is particularly true in the case of the 
male. I think we have rather convincing evidence that this is a direct dietary 
damage to the gonad (ovary or testis), rather than a disruption of the en￾docrine balance which might result in sterility as appears to be the case in 
vitamin B deficiency. 
The degenerative processes which occur in nerve tissues due to vitamin 
A deficiency have been studied by Professor Sutton and his associates.’° 
They have been able to show detailed progressive degeneration within 
nerve fibers as a result of vitamin A deficiency. 
In the light of the newer information it is quite clear why we may 
have anyone of the following distinct expressions in the reproductive 
process, namely, physical excellence of succeeding generations (such as 
obtains among many of the primitive races as I have shown) ; complete 
reproductive failure or sterility or partial failure resulting in defectives 
of various types at the borderline between these two phases. It is the 
rapid and progressive increase in this last group which constitutes the 
progressive degeneration of our modern civilization. 
One of the main problems in this study has to do with the relation of 
nutrition to the modification of the growth of the child, both in its 
formative period and in the stage of adolescence. I have shown that in 
many of these primitive racial stocks there occurs in the first generation 
after the displacement of native foods by imported foods a marked 
change in facial and dental arch forms. These changes happen most 
frequently in the later children in the families and come about notwith￾standing the impact of heredity through all the previous generations of 
excellent physical development. Clinically, the evidence is abundant, 
that this change occurs in these primitive racial stocks regardless of 
color, geographic location, temperature, and climate. We are apparently 
dealing here with a factor which, while it may be related to the germ 
plasm and to the prenatal growth period, clearly involves other forces 
than those that are at work in the case of hereditary defectives. Since 
these changes have to do directly with disturbances in growth of the 350 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
head, particularly of the face and of the dental arches, we are concerned 
with such evidence as may be available as to the nature of the forces 
that readily affect the anatomy of the skull. 
The general architecture of the body is apparently determined pri￾marily by the health of the two germ cells at the time of their union. 
This architectural design may fot be completely fulfilled due to 
interference with nutritive processes both before and after birth. In 
this large problem of the relationship between physical design of the 
body and resistance or susceptibility to disease, we may have determin￾ing factors operating at different periods in prenatal and_ postnatal 
growth. The accumulating evidence strongly emphasizes that disease 
susceptibility is a widely variable factor and associated with certain types 
of developmental disturbances. 
In a discussion of tuberculosis susceptibility before a meeting of 
specialists in that field, emphasis was placed upon the fact that other 
factors than the bacteria played controlling roles in the matter of 
susceptibility to tuberculosis. 
Weisman has recently made an important contribution to the problem 
of physical development and susceptibility to tuberculosis. He has pre￾sented” statistical data indicating the type of chest deformity which 
predisposes an individual to tuberculosis. He states: 
In a study previously made on the shape of the normal and of the tuber￾culosis chest, it was found that the average normal chest was flat and wide 
and that the average tuberculous chest was deep and narrow. It was also 
shown that the deep chest was an underdeveloped, primitive type of chest, 
resembling an infant’s chest in shape. Later studies on the shape of the chest 
and on environment showed that children from the poorer socio-economic en￾vironments had on the average a deeper chest, weighed less and were shorter 
than the children from the higher socio-economic levels. An investigation 
recently made on the incidence of tuberculosis in the various school districts 
in Minneapolis revealed that there is a very high incidence of tuberculosis 
among the children from the slums where the deep chest prevails. Ten times as 
many cases of tuberculosis were reported from a school district which is perhaps 
the poorest in the city as were reported from the best school districts. 
This study, which shows that there is a definite correlation between the deep 
chest and the positive reaction to tuberculin adds one more link to the chain 
of evidence supporting the contention that the deep chest is more or less as￾sociated with tuberculosis. It also helps to explain why there is such a high 
incidence of tuberculosis among the poor in the slum districts. The children 
in the slums are physically underdeveloped. They are not only shorter and 
lighter but they have on the average a deep, primitive, infantile type of chest, 
one that has not gone through the normal process of development. Even the PRENATAL NUTRITIONAL DEFORMITIES 351 
new-born and infants are shorter and lighter and have a deeper chest than 
the average infant from a better environment. 
It is important to note that Dr. Weisman associated the type of chest 
which predisposes the individual to tuberculosis, with a prenatal con￾dition since he states “even the new-born and infants are shorter and 
lighter and have a deeper chest than an average infant from a better 
environment.” 
This work throws important light on why in the primitive groups 
the children born to parents who are living on the imported nutrition 
lower in vitamins and minerals than the native foods, not only showed 
a greatly increased incidence of tuberculosis over the children born to 
parents on the native diet but also proved to be those individuals who, 
in facial and dental arch form, presented positive evidence of prenatal 
injury. We also have a direct explanation for the observations that have 
been emphasized by Dr. George Draper, that physical form has a direct 
relationship to disease susceptibility of certain types, frequently spoken 
of as diatheses. 
It is important in this connection to call to mind the statement 
made by some clinicians that tuberculosis patients with narrow nostrils 
tend to make a poor fight. These narrow nostrils are clearly related to 
prenatal injury resulting primarily from defective germ cells which 
determine the architecture, not heredity but intercepted heredity. 
It is very easy to understand the effects of gross physical lesions such 
as the absence of eyeballs, harelip and cleft palate. These defects can 
readily be seen. The problem is very different, however, when we are 
dealing with disturbances of function due to minute anatomical lesions 
in either external or internal organs such as the brain. These latter will 
be discussed in the next chapter.

PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND MORAL DETERIORATION 
fae one has lived among the primitive racial stocks in different 
parts of the world and studied them in their isolation, few im￾pressions can be more vivid than that of the absence of prisons and 
asylums. Few, if any, of the problems which confront modern civiliza￾tion are more serious and disturbing than the progressive increase in the 
percentage of individuals with unsocial traits and a lack of respon sibility. : 
Laird’ has emphasized some phases of this in an article entitled, The 
Tail That Wags the Nation, in which he states: ‘““The country’s average 
level of general ability sinks lower with each generation. Should the 
ballot be restricted to citizens able to take care of themselves? One out 
of four cannot.” He has illustrated the seriousness of this degeneration 
by presenting details as follows: 
Although we might cite any one of nearly two dozen states, we will first 
mention Vermont by name because that is the place studied by the late Dr 
Pearce Bailey. “It would be,” he wrote, “safe to assume that there are at 
least 30 defectives per 1000 in Vermont of the eight-year-old mentality type, 
and 300 per 1000 of backward or retarded persons, persons of distinctly in￾ferior intelligence. In other words, nearly one-third of the whole population 
of that state is of a type to require some supervision. 
From a broad view of the problem of modern degeneration it will 
be helpful to note the observations by Tredgold’ in mental deficiency. 
He states: 
It is thus evident that the condition of mental deficiency, whilst presenting 
many interesting problems to the physician, the pathologist, and the psychol￾ogist, has also a much wider interest and importance. Since in Man the pre￾dominate feature is Mind, and since it is by its development and evolution 
that human progress has taken, and must take place, it is clear that the ques￾tion of its disease, and particularly of its defect, is one of supreme importance 
to the statesman, the sociologist, the philosopher, and the whole community. 
In connection with these investigations among primitive races it is 
interesting to note that the data are in complete harmony with the data 
353 354 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
which clinical pathologists, clinicians and anatomists have obtained in 
their study of the physical and structural characteristics of individuals 
who make up the deficiency groups. In discussing the problem of the 
significance of the shape of the palate, Tredgold” states: 
Palate—The association of abnormalities of the palate with mental deficiency 
has long been recognized, and there is no doubt that it is one of the common￾est malformations occurring in this condition. Many years ago Langdon Down 
drew attention to the subject, and more recently Clouston has recorded a large 
number of observations which show conclusively that, although deformed 
palates occur in the normal, they are far and away more frequent in neuro￾paths and the mentally defective. He states that deformed palates are present 
in 19 per cent of the ordinary population, 33 per cent of the insane, 55 per 
cent of criminals, but in no less than 61 per cent of idiots. Petersen, who has 
made a most exhaustive study of this question, and has compiled an elaborate 
classification of the various anomalies found palatal deformities present in no 
less than 82 per cent of aments, (mental defectives), in 76 per cent of 
epileptics, and in 80 per cent of the insane. 
Probably every city in the United States has made special provision 
for both mentally deficient groups and unsocial individuals, either in 
special schools or in special classes. In Cleveland, we have had a large 
school devoted to the problems of the so-called pre-delinquent boys, of 
whom nearly all have been before the courts and are assigned to this 
institution because they are not well enough adjusted to be kept in their 
normal school environment. In discussing the characteristics of these 
boys with the principal of that school, I asked him what the probabilities 
were that many of these boys would finally become involved in crime. 
His comment was, in effect, that they were virtually in the vestibule of 
a penal institute, when judged by the experience of previous boys from 
that school. 
In approaching a study of this group, it is helpful to observe the 
experience of the well-equipped institutions organized for the correction 
of the abnormal trend which characterizes these boys. In this connection, 
there is a helpful report by the United States Dept. of Labor, Publica￾tion No. 203, which gives the result of tracing the after careers of 621 
boys who were in five of the best-known correctional institutions. It was found that 66 per cent had been arrested and 58 per cent convicted one or more times after having been paroled from the institution. It is apparent from data of this type that probably the forces that produce these abnormal expressions cause irreparable damage in the brain tissue. Practically all recent crime reports are recording an increase in juvenile crime. The Children’s Bureau of the Dept. of Labor stated (Nov. 4, f 
| 
RE YSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION: 355 
1938): “that juvenile delinquency spurted during 1937 for the first 
time since 1930,” but it cannot explain why until further study. 
Reports to the bureau from 28 courts in 17 states and the District 
_ of Columbia showed that they handled 31,038 cases during 1937, an 
increase of 3,000 over 1936. The report showed that 44 per cent of the 
} | 
cases involved children between 14 and 15 years old; 22 per cent those 
between 12 and 13 years, and 10 per cent those between 10 and 11. 
Boys’ cases comprised 85 per cent of the total. 
As an approach to this problem I have made an examination of 189 
boys in the Cleveland school for pre-delinquents. I gave particular atten￾tion to those physical signs of nutritional injury, which seemed to be 
definitely assigned to the formative period of the child. We endeavored 
to obtain detailed information relative to the family history and to the 
birth of the child. We were fortunate in having the assistance of the off￾cers, and of a nurse in the dental service of the Health Department of the 
Board of Education, a nurse who made visits to the homes of many of 
these boys to obtain the information directly from the mothers. 
In this group of boys, there were twenty-nine for whom I had not 
sufficient details to include their cases in the studies. Of the 189 in the 
group, there were only three with sufficiently normal dental arches to 
be classified as normal. Accordingly, 98.4 per cent proved to be indi- 
| viduals with more or less marked abnormality. Many of the faces were 
‘ very badly deformed. 
While often it will be difficult to place the responsibility entirely on 
either parent for the child’s abnormal physical development, it is of 
interest to study the birth rank of these children. The average number 
of children in the families represented by these 160 children is 4.75. Of 
these, thirty-five, or 21.9 per cent, are first children in the families 
represented; thirteen, or 9.1 per cent, are only children; thirty-nine, or 
24.4 per cent, are last children; and thirty-six or 22.5 per cent, are fifth 
children or later. Sixty-two, or 38.7 per cent, are either the first or last 
child. It will be seen from these data that the first or last child, or even 
a late child in a large family, tended to have a distinctly poorer chance 
than the intermediate children in the families in which these studies 
were made. Statistical data relating the age of the mother and father to 
prenatal deficiency of their offspring reveal that abnormally young 
parents have a much higher percentage of defective children than do 
those in the most favorable child-bearing period of life. The group at 
the Cleveland school included only those boys who have been before 
the courts because of more or less serious phases of delinquency. If they 
are in a considerable part the products of a defective society, it seems 356 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
quite unfair that they should be held entirely responsible for that de￾linquency, which has put them in this institution. If they are destined 
for a penal institute in which they will be held entirely responsible for 
that abnormality which resulted in their misdemeanor, as has been the 
procedure in the past, are they receiving just consideration? Society 
may be justified in protecting itself from their misdeeds by placing 
restrictions about them, but it does not seem that society is justified in 
shifting the entire responsibility to the affected individuals. 
Recent studies of the mental capacity of felons brought before the 
Common Pleas Court in Cleveland have shown that of 3,197 convicted 
felons examined in the medical clinic only 42.3 per cent were classified 
as normal. Fifty-five and nine-tenths per cent were classed as defective 
delinquents and only 1.8 per cent as insane. The outgrowth of this 
study has resulted in the drafting by the Cleveland Bar Association of 
a new criminal law for Ohio to be presented to the coming State Legis￾lature. This bill provides for the creation of a new criminal class com￾posed of what are called defective delinquents. This includes morons and 
others of abnormal mentality but not insane who commit felonies or 
misdemeanors. The purpose of this legislation is to afford special treat￾ment for law violators falling within the new classification, making it 
possible to segregate delinquents in separate institutions. The Ohio law 
like that of most other states now recognizes only two types of criminals, 
sane and insane, and if not insane they must be punished. 
It is proper that we should ask who is to blame for the abnormalities 
which render these young men incapable of making the necessary adapta￾tion to our environment. 
An important characteristic of the boys in the Cleveland school was 
“their low intelligence. Practically all were recorded as retarded or men￾tally backward prior to their transfer to this institution. 
It is important that we note the characteristics of groups that are 
similarly retarded, but who have not demonstrated sufficiently unsocial 
characters to have to be placed in the pre-delinquent groups. We shall 
recognize them as individuals who may never commit unsocial acts 
sufficient to get them into trouble, though they will doubtless continue 
in the group of mentally backward persons. Such a group is to be 
found in the Outwaithe School in Cleveland. The children in this 
school, which enrolls about one thousand students, were examined ‘in 
order to ascertain whether there might be groups that are similarly afflicted physically. The school is distinctive because it has a very high percentage of children who are backward mentally. Many of these 
children have been concentrated there in order to bring them under the PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION 357 
influence of special teachers. In an examination of a cross section of the 
children, almost all were found to have had distinct injury in the forma￾tive period, as evidenced by the changes in facial form. A preliminary 
survey of the backward children of this institution was made by having 
typical classes selected by an official of the school from ages ranging 
from eleven to seventeen. I examined the arches and made measurements 
of the head and face. With the assistance of the school nurse I obtained 
records of the other children in the families selected. This latter survey 
was supplemented by field work by the nurse. The intelligence quotients, 
as reported in the records, were also provided. In the twenty-nine indi￾viduals so studied, seven, or twenty-five per cent were first children; 
fourteen, or fifty per cent last children in the families. Only one indi￾vidual was found with approximately normal dental arches, that is, 
approximately three per cent of the individuals. Twenty-eight children, 
or 97 per cent, had abnormality of one or both dental arches. These 
children were placed in this institution because they were backward 
mentally, although as a group they are comparable to the group studied 
in the Thomas A. Edison School, where the grouping was based on de￾linquent traits. A cursory examination was made by observing other 
pupils in this school in their classes and on the grounds. A large per￾centage of severe facial and dental arch deformities and a very high 
percentage with definite disturbances in facial growth were evident. 
These data are presented as applying to a group of individuals charac￾terized by a disturbed mentality, to the extent that they were assigned 
to special classes for the mentally retarded. While the group constituting 
the school population at Outwaithe represented the relatively large group 
of pupils assigned to special classes for backward children and did not 
carry the stigmata of delinquency carried by those of the Thomas A. 
Edison School, both groups had many physical defects in common. 
We are, accordingly, concerned with the relationship existing among 
various stages of mental backwardness, pre-delinquency and criminality. 
To throw light on this subject, I visited our State Penitentiary to observe 
the characteristics of facial and dental arch development of the indi￾viduals whose unsocial traits had brought them to this institution. ] 
visited the dental clinic with the director, Dr. May, and saw the mouths 
of typical members of that colony as they were presented for oral 
examination. I asked the director what, if any, special features of the 
oral cavity he had observed to be characteristic of this group and 
different from those he had observed outside the institution in his private 
practice. He stated that he had noted continually that there was a tend￾ency for the tongue to be too large for the mouth. This is a constant 358 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

characteristic of another group of mentally injured, namely, the Mon￾goloid. This institution has a population of approximately four thousand 
individuals. A high percentage of them gave marked evidence of

injury in the prenatal period as expressed in disturbances of facial form 
and the shape of the dental arches. In observing over half the popula￾tion at work or exercise, I did not see one with a typically normal facial 
development. In Fig. 122 will be seen typical examples of this group. 
These show front and side views (see Hooton’s recent book’). 
Newspaper daily illustrated reports of crimes committed by young 
criminals show almost continually these evidences of prenatal injury. 
Note the two characters Bird and Nixon, Fig. 123. 
It is important to emphasize the fact that the disturbances in the 
development of the head, face and brain may have a variety of expres￾sions. In the more severe form characteristic of the Mongoloid group, 360 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
as seen in Fig. 124 the facial injury is typical and is associated with a 
mental disturbance which, in turn, has been shown to be associated with 
typical brain lesions. The individuals of that group, however, do not 
tend to be criminals. Indeed, their injury is too severe. As a group they 
are apt to be docile, tractable and happy. Indeed, in the mentally back￾ward and criminal groups in their various stages, we find facial patterns 
typical of large numbers of individuals we see on the streets, who are 
in school or in business, and entirely capable of maintaining a respected 
and honorable position in society. Accordingly, it is not justified, and 
indeed would be entirely unfair, to associate their disturbed facial and 
dental arch development with traits that would be normally found in 
ihe grossly unsocial groups. We cannot by viewing the face evaluate the 
kind or extent of brain injury that is associated with prenatal mal￾nutrition of that individual. Indeed, these various divergent facial 
patterns are accepted by our modern civilization as representative of 
the many varieties or patterns constituting a normal population. It is 
not until we see primitive groups living under a controlled natural 
environment that we see Nature’s model and design of the human 
physiognomy. 
We are concerned to know the percentage in any typical colony of 
cur modern civilization that may be placed in the various classifications 
of normal, mildly backward mentally, severely backward mentally, 
unsocial, delinquent, criminal, idiots, epileptic and insane. Tredgold? 
reports two surveys in England and Wales which give figures on the 
proportion of the population that could be identified with definite 
lesions. It would be fortunate if a survey could be made in the United 
States that would indicate the extent of the increase in delinquents of 
various types, including racketeers and criminals. It would be very 
helpful if these data could be related to the degrees of prenatal injury. 
There are many phases of modern degeneration which lend themselves 
to study from the standpoint of the probable role of progressive decline 
in the efficiency of nutrition to the progressive increase in morbidity, 
mortality, mental deficiency and delinquency. This is discussed in the next chapter on Soil Depletion, Plant and Animal Deterioration. 
From the point of view of this problem the differences between the modern white civilizations and many of the primitive groups is inter- esting. Criminal tendencies in isolated primitives are so slight that no prisons are required. I have referred to the Loetschental Valley in Switzerland, which, until recently, has been physically isolated from the process of modernization. For the two thousand inhabitants in that PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION 361

valley, there is no prison. In Uganda, Africa, the Ruanda tribes esti￾mated to number two and a half millions, had no prisons. 
Observation of Nature’s normal facial patterns in the primitive ra￾cial stocks, establishes types within the limits of normality. The readers 
of this text by observing the individuals in any given families may see 
in how large a percentage of white families the progressive narrowing 
and lengthening of the face in the younger members of the family as 
compared with the older occurs. Further observations will enable one 
to recognize rapidly, even without experience and special training in 
anatomy, these evidences of prenatal injury. 
I made a survey in the New England States, Quebec and Eastern 
Ontario, because the United States death rate from heart disease as re￾ported by the American Heart Association was shown to be highest in 
Vermont and New Hampshire, followed closely by Massachusetts and 
New York. I first visited the New York State Hospital for tuberculosis 
patients at Raybrook, near Saranac. With the assistance of a member of 
the staff, I examined fifty young men and women in the wards. In that 
group, only three were found with normal facial and dental arch devel￾opment. These three individuals were marble cutters who were suffering 
from silicosis. The forty-seven other individuals examined (94 per cent) 
were found to have marked evidence of injury in the developmental 
period. At the state fair at Rutland, Vermont, to which residents came 
from various communities throughout the state, I was able to count, 
by observing and recording the individuals who passed, that in each 
100 people, three out of four gave evidence of injury in the develop￾mental period. Similar studies were made at the State Farm for delin￾quent boys and girls, almost all of whom had been before the courts. 
I found that a very high percentage, approximating 100 per cent of 
those observed, had received injuries in the prenatal period. I then went 
to Quebec and studied groups of school children in the early teens. 
I observed groups in which a very high percentage gave marked evi￾dence of prenatal injury. This seemed aggravated in districts where the 
farms had been abandoned, because the land was not producing as well 
as in the past. I studied Indians in two Indian Reservations, also, and 
there again found marked evidence of injury typical of our modernized 
communities. Similarly, a limestone district in Ontario was visited and 
critical observations were made of the facial form of the new generation, 
in regions in which the fertility of the soil had been definitely depleted 
through exhaustion. These again showed evidence of prenatal injury 
through faulty nutrition. The prisoners in a jail were examined, and all PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION _ 363 
of them except two habitual drunkards showed marked evidence of 
prenatal injury. 
If space permitted, it would be interesting to include here a discus￾sion and illustrations of the physical characteristics of the racketeers and 
criminals whose pictures are shown in our newspapers almost daily. It 
is rare that a normal face is depicted in this group. 
As an approach to more detailed study of the available information 
regarding the processes that are involved in the production of facial 
deformities, it will be helpful to think of the face as constituting the 
floor of the anterior part of the brain. The pituitary body is situated 
on the underside of the brain just back of the eyes. It is the governing 
body for the activity of growth, and largely controls the functioning 
of several of the other glands of internal secretion. It is, as it were, the 
master of the ship. We are, accordingly, primarily concerned with the 
role that it plays, and the forces which control its own development and 
function. Its dependence upon vitamin E has been demonstrated by 
many workers. For example, Dr. M. M. O. Barrie® has reported that an 
inadequate amount of vitamin E produces marked disturbance in the 
growth of the offspring of rats. He states: 
The changes observed are similar in several ways to those produced by hypo￾physectomy (removal of pituitary gland). Marked degranulation of the an￾terior pituitary is found in both the abnormal young and the adult sterile 
animals. Lack of vitamin E therefore produces a virtual nutritional hypophys￾ectomy in the young rat. 
The work recently done in this field by Dr. Hector Mortimer and his 
associates in McGill University, Montreal, has included studies of skull 
development of rats. He has shown that the surgical removal of the 
pituitary body at the base of the brain in very young rats produces 
regularly a certain type of defect in skull development. This has been 
characterized by a lack of development forward of the muzzle or face, 
with a narrowing of the nose and dental arches. He found that by the 
addition of extracts made from the pituitary glands, which he had re￾moved surgically, he entirely prevented the development of these defects, 
thereby establishing the relation of the injury to deficiencies of the 
hormones developed by that organ. Another approach to the problem 
on which he has expended much fruitful effort, has been in connection 
with the study of the skulls of individuals who are known to have dis￾turbances in the functioning of the pituitary gland through the inter￾ference caused by tumors. Common illustrations are the cases of acro￾megaly or giantism. By associating these physical changes in bodily 364 NUTRITION AND PHYSIGAL DEGENERATION 
form with each x-ray, data obtained from skiagraphs, together with the 
history and the nature of the tumor, considerable information has been 
developed. Another important series of studies has included the correla￾tion, by means of the x-rays, of the skulls of individuals suffering from 
certain types of physical and mental disturbances, with certain abnor￾malities in the skull as shown by the x-rays. By these various means Dr. 
Mortimer has been able to divide the various types of skull defects and 
developmental and growth defects into distinct classifications. With this 
yardstick he is able to classify individuals from their Roentgenograms. 
It is of interest that in his work, in association with Dr. G. Levine, Dr. 
A. W. Rowe and others at the Evans Memorial for Clinical Research and 
Neuro-Endocrine Research in Boston, important relationships have been 
established through the examination of over three thousand case histories. 
X-ray records of the skull are included in the studies. They report that 
independent and previous physiological investigations gave evidence at 
the time of the examination of disturbed pituitary function. Dr. Morti￾mer’s excellent investigations seem to indicate clearly that facial and 
dental arch form are directly related to and controlled by the function￾ing of the pituitary body in the base of the brain. Dr. Barrie® reports 
that partial deficiency of vitamin E, as shown in the case of the female 
rat, results in the prolongation of gestation which may be continued 
as long as ten days beyond the normal period. The offspring under these 
conditions are abnormal. Further, animals deficient in vitamin E, occa￾sionally give birth to a litter, but fail to lactate. 
When we realize that one of the best sources of vitamin E is wheat 
germ, most of which is removed from white flour, usually along with 
four-fifths of the mineral, we see one cause of the tragedy that is over- 
_ whelming so many individuals in our modern civilization. In many in￾dividuals it may be wise to reinforce our modern white bread and 
starchy dietary with wheat germ, which can be obtained in package 
form from the manufacturers of flour. As this is put up in cans, all 
air is displaced with an inert gas when the cans are sealed. While in this 
way oxidation of the embryo which is very fragile, is prevented, as soon 
as the seal is broken, oxidation sets in and progresses rapidly, producing 
a product that is not comparable to the wheat embryo of freshly cracked 
whole wheat. My investigations indicate that Nature has put just the 
right amount of embryo in each grain of wheat to accompany that 
quantity of food. If the whole wheat is prepared and eaten promptly 
after grinding and exposing the embryo to oxidation, the effect desired 
by Nature is adequately provided. 
It is important to emphasize in connection with the development PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION _ 365 
of the deformities of the face that other skeletal deficiencies or abnor￾malities result from the same disturbing factors. One of these is the 
narrowing of the entire body, with a tendency to increase in height. 
This is shown in many of the family groups of modernized primitives. 
The effect of this narrowing of the body, which in girls results in the 
boyish type of figure due to the narrowing of the hips, introduces an 
entirely new and serious problem in the experience of our modern 
civilization when confronted with the problems of childbirth. 
Among primitive races living in a primitive state childbirth was a 
very simple and rapid process, accompanied by little fear or apprehen￾sion; whereas, in the modernized descendants, even in the first and 
second generations of those individuals born to parents after they had 
adopted the foods of modern white civilizations, serious trouble was 
often experienced. 
We have been considering the changes which take place in the skele￾tal growth as a result of the disturbances in the functioning of the 
pituitary body of the individual after birth, or of the mother during 
the prenatal period. We are also concerned with changes in the soft 
tissues, particularly the brain. I have presented data indicating that 
a very large percentage of mentally backward children have disturb￾ances in facial development. The available data also indicate that a large 
percentage of those who are seriously injured in facial form have some 
disturbance in their mental or moral character. Whether there is rela￾tionship between the processes which develop these physical abnormali￾ties in brain growth and mental efficiency, including emotional states 
and character traits is now to be considered. 
An important contribution has been made to this phase of the problem 
by Dr. James Papez, Professor of Anatomy at Cornell University,* who 
concludes his report: 
Is emotion a magic product, or is it a physiologic process which depends on 
an anatomic mechanism? ... The evidence presented is . . . suggestive of 
such a mechanism as a unit within the larger architectural mosaic of the brain. 
Research data have been presented which deal with the anatomical 
defects of the brain of individuals suffering from the typical mental 
and physical patterns of the so-called Mongolian idiot. In these cases 
the gyrus cinguli of the brain were found to be absent, which indicates 
the impossibility that these individuals function normally either physi￾cally or mentally. 
Modern civilization has provided a large group of the defectives 
known as Mongolian idiots. They have very definite characteristics both 366 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
physical and mental. Among the former, one of the most universal 
expressions is a vacant stare associated with a face that is markedly 
underdeveloped in the middle third, usually accompanied by narrow 
nostrils and a narrow upper dental arch. 
One of the outstanding characteristics of the group is their inability 
to develop mentally beyond three to eight years of age. Because of the 
difficulty of building a character and intelligence level beyond infancy, 
these unfortunates are housed largely in state institutions for feeble￾minded. Since the physical picture is similar to that which occurs in a 
much less severe form in a large number of individuals in our modern 
civilization, it is important that we study this group in the light 
of the information that is available with regard to their physical, mental 
and moral characteristics, and in the light of such information as is 
available regarding their origin. 
The surveys that have been made reveal the fact that nearly all of 
them are born to mothers more than forty years of age, and apparently 
at a period of very low efficiency in reproductive capacity. While most 
of the discussion and literature stress the importance of the age of the 
mother, some data are now available which throw responsibility also 
on the paternal side. 
Korosi, as reported by Tredgold in Mental Deficiency, came to the 
conclusion as a result of the investigation of 24,000 unselected individ￾uals that the children of fathers below twenty or above forty years of 
age are weaker than the children of fathers between these ages. Also, 
the children of mothers over forty years of age are weaker than those 
born to mothers below this age. Tredgold presents data connecting de￾fective structures in the brain with certain phases of physical behavior 
and mental deficiencies. He quotes many authors whose data correspond 
with his own. Much of this material relates to accounts of incomplete 
prenatal development of nerve structures in the brain. 
We are particularly interested in the origin and the nature of the 
brain lesions. Penrose,” in analyzing the relative etiologic importance of 
birth order and maternal age in Mongolism presents data obtained 
from an examination of 224 defectives in which the total number of 
children in all the families involved was 1,013. Accordingly, in these 
families approximately 20 per cent were so affected. The average number 
of children per family was five and one-half. He states: 
Mongolian imbeciles are very often born last in a long family. This fact, 
which was pointed out many years ago by Shuttleworth, has led clinicians to 
believe that Mongolism is to some extent a product of the exhaustion of 
maternal reproductive powers due to frequent child bearing. . . . The con- PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION 367 
clusion is widely accepted with the reservation that the affected child is not 
necessarily born at the end of the family. Several cases are first-born, in fact, 
and last children than in other ordinal positions. There is, however, ample evi￾and it is sometimes stated that the conditions occur more frequently in first 
dence that Mongolian imbeciles have a significantly later birth rank than 
normal children. 
G. Ordahl® has reported on a study of ninety-one cases in which he 
found that fifty-six or 60 per cent were the last born. The families 
averaged five children. He states that “uterine exhaustion is the most 
commonly advanced reason for Mongolism.”” Madge T. Macklin’ says, 
“It is usually stated that it (Mongolism) occurs more frequently in the 
later pregnancies owing either to reproductive exhaustion or to too 
advanced age of the mother.” 
We are concerned at this point for evidence that will throw light on 
the relationship between the functioning of the pituitary body in the 
base of the brain and the development of this type of facial and mental 
deformity. 
A striking case is that of a boy sixteen years of age who was a typical 
Mongolian idiot. He had two sisters who were much older than he. His 
mother was a partial invalid when he was born late in her life. We have 
no data relative to the details of the children who may have been lost. 
His father was living and well except for a railroad injury. This boy at 
the age of sixteen was infantile in many of his characteristics and de￾velopments. The genitals were those of a boy eight years old. The 
facial expression was that of the typical Mongolian idiot. By the Binet 
test he had a mentality of about four years. Roentgenograms of his 
hands showed that the epiphyseal bones had not united. He played on 
the floor with blocks and with rattles like a child. His interest was in 
children’s activities. (Fig. 125.) 
The outstanding physical characteristic was his maxillary arch which 
was so much smaller than the mandibular arch that it went entirely 
inside it. In order to give him a masticating surface, and with the hope 
of helping him both physically and mentally, since several cases had 
greatly benefited by such an operation, I determined to widen his arch 
by moving the maxillary bones apart about one-half inch. The position 
of his teeth before the moving of the bones is shown in Fig. 126. 
Roentgenograms showing the opening of the median suture with increase 
of pressure are also shown in Fig. 126. An important phase of this case 
was that the left nostril was entirely occluded, and probably had been 
all his life. A rhinologist spent half an hour trying to shrink the tissue 
with adrenalin and cocain sufficiently to get air or water through, and 368 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
was not able to do so. The quantity of air that he was able to inhale 
through his right nostril was so scant that he continually breathed with 
his mouth open. At night he was forced to lie with something like his

coat rolled into a hard ridge and placed under the back of his neck and 
his head pushed far back to a position that would open his mouth and 
retain it so, or he would awaken, strangling because of the closing of his 
mouth. 
With the movement of the maxillary bones laterally, as shown pro￾gressively in Fig. 126, there was a very great change in his physical & L. November 26

development and mentality. He grew three inches in about four months. 
His moustache started to grow immediately; and in twelve weeks’ time 
the genitals developed from those of a child to those of a man, and with 
it a sense of modesty. His mental change was even more marked. The 
space between the maxillary bones was widened about one-half inch in 
about thirty days. This lateral pressure on the maxillary bones was ac￾complished by rigid attachments to the teeth of the two sides of the 
upper arch. The outward movement of the maxillary bones (which 
form the roof of the mouth and sides of the nose) by pressure on the 
temporal bones produced a tension downward on the floor of the anterior 
part of the brain, thus stimulating the pituitary gland in the base of 
the brain. In a few weeks’ time he passed through stages that usually 
take several years. At first, he got behind the door to frighten us; later, 
he put bent pins on chairs to see us jump when we sat down, and finally 
he became the cause of a policeman’s coming to the office from where he 
was conducting traffic on the corner below to find who it was squirting 
water on him when his back was turned. He developed a great fondness 
for calling people over the telephone, wanted to borrow my automobile 
to take his mother for a drive, and with his arm caressingly about the 
shoulders of one of the secretaries, invited her to go with him to a 
dance. All this change developed in about twelve weeks. 
A most remarkable event happened in connection with this pro￾cedure. He lived in another city, and so, while with me, stayed in a 
boarding house at a little distance from my office in order that he might 
have frequent, and almost constant attention. On his return to his home 
town, his efficiency had increased to such an extent that his mother 
could send him with the money to the grocery store with the order for 
the day’s groceries, and he could bring back the right change and could 
tell when it was correct. He could also come alone to me ninety miles by 
railroad and make two changes of trains and the various transfers on the 
street cars of the city with accuracy and safety. 
He wore an appliance in his mouth to keep the bones in position. 
This appliance became dislodged; the maxillary bones settled together; 
immediately, or in a day or two, he lapsed into his old condition of 
lethargy accompanied by an old trouble, which had frequently been 
distressing, namely, nausea, this sometimes lasting for twenty-four hours. 
With the readaptation of the separating appliance and the reconstruction 
of the retaining appliance, he returned rapidly to his improved con￾dition. 
But a new problem had developed. We had changed an infant to a 
potential man with the impulses of a man, but with the mind of a child. PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION 371 
With the change in his physical condition he became a menace in his 
community as a sex pervert. His mother died and his sister married. It 
became necessary to have him placed in a state institution for defectives. 
During the period he was in my care, he had learned to read child stories 
and newspaper headings, and had spent much time doing so. The changes 
in his physical appearance are shown in Fig. 125, above, front view, and 
below, side view. The first picture at the left shows his appearance 
before the operation; the second, thirty days after; and the last, six 
months later. The opening produced in the upper arch in front of half 
an inch was filled by supplying two teeth on a restoration, which at the 
same time held the maxillary bones in their new position. In six months 
he had developed whiskers and moustache. The progressive changes in 
the position of the maxillary bones with the opening of the median suture 
are shown in Fig. 126, together with the mechanical appliance. In the 
last view, the restoration carrying the porcelain teeth to fill the space 
is shown. 
A very important contribution to our knowledge of the cause of 
Mongolism has recently been published by Dr. Clemens E. Benda,°® 
Clinical Director of the Wrentham State School, Wrentham, Massachu￾setts, in association with the Harvard Medical School of Boston. He and 
his group have approached the problem of Mongolism from two different 
angles; first, as to determine whether it is accidental, and second, whether 
it is a unit of symptoms which can be related to more essential altera￾tion. Their studies including careful anatomical studies have been 
made on the basis of an examination of 125 Mongoloids. He states: 
Summarizing our investigations, the pituitary in mongoloids reveals a pe￾culiar and definite pathology. On the basis of fourteen cases we feel justified in 
emphasizing that in mongolism definite failure of the pituitary development 
is to be found. Mongolism appears as a hypopituitarism of a specific type, in 
which the absence or deficiency of basophiles seems to be essential. 
The evidence indicates that this severe type of facial and brain 
injury is related directly to a lowered reproductive capacity of the 
mother associated with age, since the majority are born to mothers 
beyond forty years of age, and to an inadequate nutrition of the mother, 
particularly in vitamin E since this vitamin plays so important a role in 
the nutrition of the pituitary body. 
Important new data have been provided in an analysis of births in the 
United States in connection with the development of the Mongolian 
group. Bleyer® has reported a study of 2,822 cases. He reports that of the 
total births in the United States in 1934, of 1,095,939, there were 1,822 372 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
reported as Mongoloids. The average age of the mothers of these indi￾viduals was forty-one years. He reports data indicating that in the age 
group of mothers forty to forty-four the chances of the development 
of a Mongoloid would be seventy-five times as high as normal expect￾ancy, and in the age forty-five to forty-nine the chances are 125 times 
normal expectancy. In a group of 1,942 Mongoloids, 1,100 or 57 per 
cent were last children. These data are in keeping with those of several 
other investigators, and emphasize the problem of depleted reproductive 
capacity. 
The interesting problems involved in the birth of identical twins 
throw light on the origin of both physical and mental characters. It is 
a matter of great significance in connection with these studies that 
anomalies which we can associate with parental deficient nutrition are 
reproduced in both twins. Important additional light has been thrown 
on this phase by a family of six pairs of fraternal twins born to the same 
parents. These are reported by Dr. William W. Greulich, of New 
Haven." It is significant that nine of these individuals (one of the oldest 
pair is deceased, and the youngest twins are yet babes in arms) show 
marked narrowing of the nostrils and lack of development of the middle 
third of the face, narrowing of the face and tendency to be mouth 
breathers. Further, the severity of this condition appears to be pro￾gressively more severe in the younger pairs of twins, sufficiently grown 
to show facial development. There is accordingly, evidence here of pro￾gressive lowering of reproductive efficiency, and the fact that both indi￾viduals are involved similarly has great significance, since they are 
fraternal twins arising from a single ovum. This seems clearly to relate 
this disturbance with a deficient germ plasm. Factors that are reproduced 
in identical twins would include both hereditary characters and those 
that are produced by a disturbance in environment resulting in an inter￾ference with normal hereditary processes. In a case of twins that are not 
identical, there is significance in the development of similar deformities 
which are likely to be of acquired origin rather than of hereditary 
origin. In Fig. 127 is seen a pair of twins. Note that they have similar 
disturbance in the development of the dental arches with the upper 
laterals depressed and the cuspids crowded outward in the arch. 
A very important source of information which deals with the relation 
of disturbances of the physical development of the head and mentality 
is provided by a study of the members of the teen-age group who are 
classed as mentally backward. In an examination of a Cleveland school 
in a colored district that has been set aside largely for boys and girls who 
are distinctly deficient in their ability to learn, it was disclosed that a PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION 373 
verv large percentage suffered from gross facial deformities when judged 
by these standards. Typical individuals in this group are shown in Fig. 
128, one is white, lower left. It is clear that these boys were all physically

deformity of the dental arch, apparently due to the same cause. 
injured in the formative period. Their clinical history indicates that the 
brain was involved in this disturbed development. 
One of the problems involved in the development of the group of 
disturbances having physical and mental expressions, is associated with 
the sensitiveness of the body during the period of adolescence. Many 
students of degenerative problems have emphasized various phases of 
this large problem. Burt'’ commented: “It is almost as though crime 
were some contagious disease, to which the constitutionally susceptible 
were suddenly exposed at puberty, or to which puberty left them pe￾culiarly prone.” The age of adolescence is also the period of greatest 
susceptibility to dental caries. Data derived from chemical studies of 
the blood and saliva show that in this period of susceptibility to dental 
caries the supplies of minerals and vitamins are inadequate to meet 
Nature’s demands, and the system borrows minerals from the skeleton 
to maintain vital processes. Lichtenstein and Brown” report data which 
reveal that educational quotients, like intelligence quotients, fall with 
increase in age during the years of developing puberty. They show that 
the educational quotient at nine years of age for the group studied was

Fic. 128. These four boys are typical of a group of several hundred in a special school 
for backward children. Practically all showed some evidence of incomplete facial and dental 
arch development. The range of defects is wide. Blacks are similarly injured as whites. 
This is inhibited heredity. PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION 375 
74. The changes in facial and dental arch form, which I have described 
at length in this volume, develop in this age period also, not as a result 
of faulty nutrition of the individual but as the result of distortions in 
the architectural design in the very early part of the formative period. 
Apparently, they are directly related to qualities in the germ plasm of 
one or both parents, which result from nutritional defects in the parent 
before the conception took place, or deficient nutrition of the mother in 
the early part of the formative period. Case records show that the first 
signs of delinquency generally make their appearance during these years. 
The age reported most frequently was that of thirteen. 
One expression of the rate of the progressive degeneration that is 
taking place in the United States is the increase in delinquency and crime 
in young people between twelve and twenty years of age, as well as in 
crime in general. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Bureau of Investiga￾tion, has recently published data showing comparative figures for 1936 
and 1937, during which time crimes in the United States increased from 
1,333,526 to 1,415,816, an increase of six per cent. This increase is 
occurring in spite of the rapid development of social organizations for 
improving the environment. 
Preventive measures among the unsocial group, who pass through 
the stages of predelinquency and crime, have been almost entirely con￾fined to improvement in the social surroundings of the growing youth. 
While, no doubt, individuals with a low factor of safety are less likely 
to develop serious criminal tendencies under favorable environments, 
such factors as constitute a first-conditioning force, i.e., injury of the 
germ plasm, and deficient nutrition in the developmental period are 
not corrected by these efforts. These new data relating to the nature of 
the underlying causes strongly emphasize the need for beginning much 
earlier. Indeed, the preparation for the next generation should begin 
early in the life of the preceding generation. 
Many investigators have emphasized the sensitiveness of the nervous 
system to disturbances in the formative period. Considerable data have 
been presented indicating that the tissues of the nervous system are the 
most easily affected of all the structures of the body. The extent of the 
injuries to the nervous system vary through a wide range. 
Harris in his chapter on “Congenital Abnormalities of the Skeleton” 
in Blacker’s'® ““Chances of Morbid Inheritance” has presented data indi￾cating the sensitive period at which the ovum is most likely to be injured: 
Few normal human embryos have been subjected to careful study. The vast 
majority of human embryos examined have been abnormal, and it is their 
abnormality which has led to their abortion between the sixth and thirteenth 376 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
weeks of embryonic life, a critical period associated with the development of 
the placenta, during which the death rate is probably in the neighborhood of 
at least 15 per cent. 
In tracing the development of the human embryo, he tells why the 
growth process is very different from that of the development of em￾bryos of lower forms. He states regarding deformed ova: “Ova that 
survive the eighth week tend to live on to term, and are born as 
monsters.” I have referred previously to a personal communication from 
[rofessor Shute, of the University of Western Ontario, which states 
that he had been impressed with the high percentage of deformities in 
aborted fetuses. This seems to be Nature’s method of eliminating defec￾tive individuals. Harris says further: 
It is sometimes suggested that threatened abortions in early pregnancy should 
not be treated by rest and quiet, as it is quite possible that the uterus is at￾tempting to rid itself of a pathological ovum which might become a monster 
in the future. 
The available data emphasize strongly that a very small percentage 
of the total gross deformities ever develop to menace society. Harris 
quotes Mall:" 
He estimated from the records of 100,000 pregnancies that there were 80,572 
normal births, 11,765 abortions of normal embryos and early monsters, and 
615 monsters born at term. Thus at term 1 child in 132 is born with some 
anatomical defect. For each such case appearing at term, 12 others died and 
were aborted during pregnancy. 
These data deal with gross defects involving physical deficiencies in 
the infant and indicate that the defects that are produced in the forma￾tive period, which are less severe than the above, are not recognizable 
at birth and may not be until long afterwards. According to Harris, 
“During the tourth week of embryonic life the head, brain and spinal 
cord are most susceptible to adverse conditions.” He traces the sensitive 
areas of the various structures through the various weeks in the em￾bryonic history. The deformities of the face among the primitive races 
which I have illustrated extensively frequently are not revealed until 
the eruption of the permanent dentition and the development of the 
adult features. While it is true that many children show deformity in 
facial development even in babyhood and childhood, those individuals 
are usually much more seriously injured when the adult face is devel￾oped. 
Bloom’ has presented the anatomical and histological characteristics PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION 377 
of a defective born to a mother fifty-one years of age, whose general 
health was reported as good. The infant’s facial pattern was markedly 
divergent from normal and practically no brain tissues had been formed. 
This expression of an extreme injury was entirely beyond that with 
which we are concerned in the study of the mental and the moral cripples 
who constitute an increasing part of our society. This is presented to 
emphasize Nature’s inexorable requirement that each parent shall be 
individually physically fit for the responsibility of producing the next 
generation. Several primitive races studied have realized this respon￾sibility. 
There are some phases of modern physical degeneration in which most 
of us take part with remarkable complacency. We would consider it 
a great misfortune and disgrace to burn up the furniture in our homes 
to provide warmth, if fuel were available for the collection. This is 
precisely what we are doing with our skeletons by a process of borrow￾ing, simply because we fail to provide new body repairing material each 
day in the food. You are all familiar with the tragic misfortune that 
overtakes so many elderly people through the accident of a broken hip 
or other fractured bone. Statistics show that approximately 50 per cent 
of fractured hips occurring in people beyond 65 years of age never 
unite. We look upon this as one of the inevitable consequences of ad￾vancing age. In Chapter 15 I have referred to the small boy whose leg 
was broken when he fell in a convulsion while walking across the kitchen 
floor. That bone did not break because the blow was hard but because 
the minerals had been borrowed from the inside by the blood stream in 
order to maintain an adequate amount of the minerals, chiefly calcium 
and phosphorus in the blood and body fluids. He had been borrowing 
from his skeleton for months because due to a lack of vitamins he could 
not absorb even the minerals that were present in the inadequate food 
that he was eating. The calcium and the phosphorus of the milk were 
in the skimmed milk that he was using but he needed the activators of 
the butter-fat in order to use the minerals. Simply replacing white bread 
with these activators and the normal minerals and vitamins of wheat 
immediately checked the convulsions. 
We have many other expressions of this borrowing process. Much of 
what we have thought of as so-called pyorrhea in which the bone is 
progressively lost from around the teeth thus allowing them to loosen, 
constitutes one of the most common phases of the borrowing process. 
This tissue with its lowered defense rapidly becomes infected and we 
think of the process largely in terms of that infection. A part of the 
local process includes the deposit of so-called calculus and tartar about 378 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
the teeth. These contain toxic substances which greatly irritate the flesh 
starting an inflammatory reaction. Many primitive peoples not only re￾tain all of their teeth, many of them to an old age, but also have a healthy 
flesh supporting these teeth. This has occurred in spite of the fact that 
the primitives have not had dentists to remove the deposits and no means 
for doing so for themselves. Note particularly the teeth of the Eskimos. 
The teeth are often worn nearly to the gum line and yet the gum tissue 
has not receded. Many of these primitive groups were practically free 
from the affection which we have included in the general term of 
pyorrhea or gingivitis. Pyorrhea in the light of our newer knowledge is 
largely a nutritional problem. While nutrition alone often will not be 
adequate for correcting it, when established practically no treatment 
will be completely adequate without reinforcing the nutrition in so far 
as deficient nutrition has been a contributing factor. Nutrition plus 
the frequent removal of deposits, plus suitable medication will check and 
prevent pyorrhea but not correct the damage that has already been 
done. The elements that are chiefly needed in our nutrition are those 
that I have outlined as being particularly abundant in the menus as 
used by several of the primitive races. These are discussed in detail in 
Chapter 15. 
Another important aspect of this problem of borrowing has to do with 
the progressive shrinking of the skeleton as evidenced by the shortening 
of the stature. I have measured many individuals who have lost from 
two to six inches in height in a decade or two. I have seen a few indi￾viduals who have lost as much as ten inches of their height by this 
process of borrowing from the skeleton. Our bodies need a certain 
amount of fresh minerals every day with which to manufacture blood. 
The days that these minerals are not provided in the foods they will be 
taken from our storage depots, the skeleton. 
A particularly tragic phase of this problem of borrowing from the 
bone is seen in growing girls and is chiefly due to their ambition to 
avoid enlargement of their bodies to keep down their weight. The girls 
deprive themselves of body building material at a time when their bodies 
are growing and are requiring considerable new mineral. Forming bone 
has a prior claim on minerals, which is sufficiently commanding to 
induce the individual to borrow from bones that are already formed 
to provide for the necessary lengthening and growth. By this process 
many of the bones of the body are softened, particularly the bones of 
the spine. Curvatures develop, one of the expressions of which may be 
round or stooped shoulders. 
Among primitive races this type of girl, so commonly seen in our PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DETERIORATION 379 
modern civilization, is absent. Probably not one of these girls has ever 
suspected the suffering and sorrow that is being stored up for future 
life as a result of this bad management at a critical time in her develop￾ment. Fig. 134 illustrates one of the tragedies of this borrowing process. 
Practically all of these physical evidences of degeneration can be pre￾vented and fortunately many of them can be relieved in large part with 
an adequate nutrition. Even ununited fractures often can be induced to 
unite by an adequate reinforcement of the nutrition. This is true not 
only for young people but for elderly people as well. 
In addition to the problems growing out of physical injuries through 
lack of development before birth, which express themselves as facial-and 
other deformities, there is increasing need for concern for physical handi￾caps entailed in underdevelopment of the hips. The difficulty encoun￾tered at childbirth in our modern civilization has been emphasized 
by Dr. Kathleen Vaughan" of London. In her book, “Safe Childbirth,” 
she states that faults of development more than race modify pelvic 
shape. In the Foreword to her book, Dr. Howard A. Kelly, Professor 
Emeritus of Gynaecological Surgery, Johns Hopkins University, says: 
Dr. Vaughan presents such an array of facts and data that the book must 
| impress every reader. It is of vital importance that her conclusions be con- 
\ sidered, for in my opinion our methods of bringing up our girls and the habits 
\ of our women with many of the customs of ‘civilized’ life must be radically 
| readjusted. 
This important work should be made available for reference in the 
school libraries of the United States. Further data from it are presented 
in Chapter 21. 
The great contrast in discomfort and length of time of the labor of 
modern mothers is to be contrasted with ease of childbirth among primi￾tive mothers. Many workers among the primitive races have emphasized 
the vigorous health and excellence of the infant at birth. We have here, 
therefore, emphasis on the need in the interest of the infant that the 
mother shall have an easy and short labor. Both of these factors are 
directly influenced by the vitamin content of the mother’s body as 
supplied by her nutrition and also by the physical development of her 
body if her mother at the time of gestation and prior to conception had 
adequate vitamins in her food to insure perfect germ cells. 
The sensitivity of the brain to injury resulting from medication 
given the mother has been emphasized by Dr. Frederic Schreiber of 
Detroit. In his paper before the American Medical Association meeting 
in San Francisco, June, 1938, he was quoted as saying™ that the analysis 380 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
showed that 72 per cent of the children had shown difficulty in breathing 
at the time of birth or in the first few days following birth. He con￾cluded, therefore, that this difficulty in breathing was the cause of the 
brain damage. 
Difficulty in breathing would lead to a shortage of oxygen. An in￾sufficient supply of oxygen in the blood stream would have serious 
effects upon the tissues of the brain. In this connection, he cited evidence 
found in post-mortem examinations that deficiency of oxygen caused 
microscopic changes in the brain. 
X-ray photographs of some of the children examined by Dr. Schreiber 
showed various degrees of brain atrophy. 
The contribution of Dr. Schreiber also emphasizes strongly the 
susceptibility of the brain tissue to injuries which may handicap the 
individual throughout life.

SUIS DEPERTION AND PLANT AND ANIMAL 
DETERIORATION 
jee data available on the subject of soil depletion and animal de￾terioration are so voluminous that it would require a volume to 
present them adequately. When we realize the quantities of many of 
the minerals which must enter into the composition of the bodies of 
human beings and other animals, we appreciate the difficulty of pro￾viding in pasture and agricultural soils a concentration of these minerals 
sufficient to supply the needs for plant growth and food production. 
ai y If we think of growing plants and grasses in terms of average soil 
; tilled to a depth of seven inches, we are dealing with a total of approxi￾4’ = mately two million pounds of soil per acre, of which two thousand 
~. © pounds will be phosphorus in its various chemical forms, some of which 
~~ will not be readily available for plants. If one-half of this phosphorus 
)s\ were present in an available form, there would be enough for only one 
‘hundred poor crops, utilizing ten pounds to the acre for the seed alone; 
‘or for forty good crops, taking twenty-five pounds per acre, assuming 
y+ that the seed were to be removed from that Jand and not replaced. A 
: a _$sixty-bushel crop of wheat or corn per acre takes twenty-five to twenty- 
“. _ eight pounds of phosphorus in the seed. The soil is depleted of calcium 
‘similarly, though that mineral is not usually present in such limited 
nas amounts nor so rapidly taken away as is phosphorus. The leaves and 
-~ = ‘stems of rapidly growing young plants and grasses are rich in calcium 
2 and phosphorus. As the plants ripen the phosphorus is transported in 
~ large amounts to the seed while most of the calcium remains in the leaves. 
‘<A large part of the commerce of the world is concerned with the trans- 
‘Sportation of chemical elements as foods, chief of which are calcium and 
S phosphorus. Whether the product of the soil is ultimately used as wheat 
=, “for bread, milk and meat for foods, or wool and hides for clothing, 
<~S\y every pound of these products that is shipped represents a depletion of 
J ~~ & soil for pasturage or for grain production.

capacity of the best soils, and one-fourth of that for a great deal of the

Rof depletion may seem to many people unimportant, either because 
there has been no consciousness that depletion has been taking place, or 
~\because they believe that replenishment is a simple matter. 
« In correspondence with government officials in practically every 
state of the United States I find that during the last fifty years there 
chas been a reduction in capacity of the soil for productivity in many 
“districts, amounting to from 25 to 50 per cent. I am informed also 
‘that it would cost approximately fifty dollars per acre to replenish the 
~supply of phosphorus. 
“y Many people realize that farms they knew in their childhood have 
‘ceased to be productive because they have “run out.” The movement 
.,of population to cities and towns is, in part, the result of the call of the 
social center and in part a consequence of the need of forsaking depleted 
soil. While there are many things that influence the movement from the 
farms, there is much to be learned from the government census reports 
which deal directly with farm acreage and values. 
If we relate the levels of life of human and domestic animals to the 
problem of soil depletion, we find two important groups of data. First, 
there are those which relate to specific land areas, some small and some 
~yery large; and second, those which relate to civilizations and groups, 
both large and small that have passed out of existence or are rapidly 
deteriorating. A study of the skeletons of the past and present often 
discloses a progressive breakdown. For example, we may mention the 
important anthropological findings of Professor Hooton of Harvard, 
who, in his examinations of various pueblos of the Western Plains, 
especially at the Pecos Pueblo where the progressive burials have been 
uncovered, has brought to light the calendar of a civilization extending 
over a thousand years. These findings show that there has been over 
. the period of years a progressive increase in skeletal deformities, includ￾ing arthritis and dental caries, together with a reduction in stature, sug￾gesting a direct relationship to progressive depletion of the soil. 
1 In a recent magazine article, I have presented data’ comparing the 
mineral content of different pasture grasses, and relating these to defi￾ciencies in cattle. Unfortunately, space does not permit reviewing these 
for a dry pasture grass in Arizona to 1.9 per cent in a Pennsylvania 
, pasturage plant, to 2 per cent in a British Columbia pasturage plant, 
~ a range of over ten fold. Similarly, phosphorus was shown to vary from 
0.03 per cent to 1.8 per cent, a range of sixty fold. Neither pasture

a rapid depletion of soil. Minerals and other chemicals are removed and 
therefore there is need for adequate replacement. 
In Chapter 18 I have reported investigations made by Professors 
Meigs and Converse at the Beltsville Experimental Station, in which | 
they have shown that feeding cattle on a grade of dried hay that was 
low in chlorophyll resulted in the development of dead or blind calves, + 
and further that when the milk of these cows was fed to three normal > 
calves they died in fifty-seven, sixty-two and seventy-one days respec￾tively. These calves had been fed on whole milk until twenty days of age. ‘ 
They show that the main deficiency in this ration was vitamin A. 
Since mammals require milk in infancy and since it is the most effi￾cient single food known, I have made a special study of milk and its 
products. The role of the vitamins and other activating substances in 
foods is quite as important and essential as that of minerals. These 
activating substances, in general, can be divided into two groups, those 
that are water-soluble and those that are fat-soluble, the former being 
much more readily obtained in most communities, than the latter. Since 
the fat-soluble and also the water-soluble vitamins are essential for 
mineral utilization and particularly since the fat-soluble activators are - 
so frequently found to be inadequately supplied in diet and are usually 
more difficult to obtain, a special effort has been made to determine the 
level of these in dairy products in many different places for different 
seasons of the year. To accomplish this, I have obtained each year since 
1927 samples of cream and butter, mostly butter, for analysis for their 
activator content. The work has rapidly extended so that for the eleventh 
year we are receiving now (1939) samples from several hundred places 
distributed throughout the world, usually once or twice a month . 
throughout the year. Methods used for these studies are both biologic 
and chemical. These data are used in connection with morbidity and | 
mortality statistics for the same districts. 
The progressive changing of the levels of life is shown by the mor￾bidity and mortality statistics of the various areas of the United States 
and Canada. The American Heart Association publishes, from time 
to time, very important data relative to the number of deaths from * 
heart disease in the various states of the Union. It is of interest to note § 
that the highest mortality levels that are obtained are found in those 
states, in general, that have been longest occupied by modern civiliza￾tions, namely, the Atlantic States, the New England States, the Great 
Lakes States and the Pacific States. Their data published in their booklet 
“Heart Disease Mortality Statistics” and based on the United States 
Registration area reveal that the death rate per 100,000 population was 3%

Sir Arnold Theiler, who spent a quarter of a decade studying the), 
: problems of nutritional deficiency diseases among pasture animals in‘ 
<* South Africa, has discussed at length the reduction of phosphorus in~ 
“& available quantities for plant development as constituting, by far, thes; ~ 
most important mineral deficiency. He reported data obtained from iS 
} many countries through the world, indicating that the deterioration of” 
‘cattle and sheep can be directly traced to an inadequate amount oe 
phosphorus in the soil. He states, in discussing the relation of this prob- 
“lem to the conditions as they obtain in Australia, that:* 
. Amongst the Australian data the figures showing depletion of phosphorus, 
‘(as a result of sale of products off the farm without adequate replacement by »

It is important to keep in mind that morbidity and mortality data}

with large increases in the late winter and spring and a marked decrease 
in summer and early autumn. The rise and fall of the level of morbidity )

In Chapter 3, I discussed data obtained during two summers in the * 
% Loetschental and other Swiss valleys. The Loetschental Valley has been 
isolated from contact with surrounding civilizations by its unique phys￾ical environment. For twelve hundred years during which time a written 
‘ © history of the valley has been kept, the people have maintained a high 
sv? 388 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
level of physical excellence providing practically all their food, shelter . 
and clothing from the products raised in the valley. Cattle and goats | ‘ 
provided milk, milk products and meat. The stock was carefully shel- ¢ 
tered during the inclement weather and great care was used to carry © | 
back to the soil all of the enrichment. This, of course, is a process that be 
is efficiently carried out in many parts of the world today. In this J \ 
manner extensive depletion of the minerals required for food for animals * 
and human beings may be prevented. Their practice is in striking * 
contrast to that in many of the agricultural districts of the United, 
States in which the minerals are systematically shipped from the land 
to the cities, there to be dissipated to the ocean through the sewerage) 
system. Among many primitive races there is some attempt to preserve - 
the fertility of the soil. For example, in Africa, many of the tribes that * 
depend in part on agriculture, cleared off only a few acres in the heart ¥ 
of a forest and cropped this land for a limited number of years, usually, 
less than ten. Great care was taken to prevent the loss of the humus both 
through drenching rains and wind erosion. The decaying vegetation~ 
and lighter soil that might be dislodged by the water were caught in 
the entanglement of roots and shrubbery surrounding the agricultural; 
patch. The surrounding trees protect the soil from wind erosion. Care|, 
was taken not to form gullies, furrows and grooves that could carry-\ 
currents of water and thus float away the valuable humus from the soil... 
This again is in contrast to conditions in other parts of the world, par- _ 
ticularly in the United States. Sears® has stated that “Bare ground left’ 
by the plow will have as much soil washed off in ten years as the un-4 “ 
broken prairie will lose in four thousand. Even so, soil in the prairie willy. 
be forming as fast as, or faster than it is lost.” . 
In Nature’s program, minerals are loaned temporarily to the plants.) 
and animals and their return to the soil is essential. To quote again\ 
from Sears: 
What is lent by earth has been used by countless generations of plants and 
animals now dead and will be required by countless others in the future. In“ 
the case of an element such as phosphorus, so limited is the supply that if it * 
were not constantly being returned to the soil, a single century would be © 
\ & sufficient to produce a disastrous reduction in the amount of life. ~~

cate the imbalances that have developed when minerals have been per-. 
manently transferred from the soil. There are only a few localities in \ Ry 
the world where great civilizations have continued to exist through long\)

a few centuries, and in some profligated systems a few decades to produce 
so serious a mineral depletion of the soil that progressive plant and 
animal deterioration resulted. In such instances, regular and adequate 
replenishment was not taking place. 
The replenishment may be made, as in the case of the prairie with its 
plant and animal life, through a replacement in the soil of borrowed 
minerals, a program carried out efficiently by a few intelligent civiliza￾tions. The balance of the cultures have largely failed at this point. 
Another procedure for the replenishing of the depleted soils is by the 
annual spring overflow of great water systems which float enrichment 
from the highlands of the watersheds to the lower plains of the great 
waterways. This is illustrated by the history of the Nile which has 
carried its generous blanket of fertilizing humus and rich soil from the 
high interior of Africa northward over its long course through Sudan 
and Egypt to the Mediterranean, and thus made it possible for the 
borders of the Nile to sustain a population of greater density than that 
of either China or India. The salvation of Egypt has been the fact that 
the source of the Nile has been beyond the reach of modernizing influ￾ences that could destroy Nature’s vast stores of these replenishing soil 
products. Where human beings have deforested vast mountainsides at 
the sources of the great waterways, this whole problem has been changed. 
A similar situation has occurred in China. Her two great rivers, the 
Yangtze and the Yellow River, having their sources in the isolated 
vastness of the Himalayas in Tibet, have through the centuries provided 
the replenishment needed for supporting the vast population of the 
plains of these great waterways. Together with this natural replenish￾ment the Chinese have been exceedingly efficient in returning to the soil 
the minerals borrowed by the plant and animal life. Their efficiency as 
agriculturists has exceeded that of the residents of most parts of the 
populated world. 
The story in Europe and America has been vastly different in many 
districts. The beds of roots of trees and grasses that hold the moisture 
and induce precipitation have been rudely broken up. An important 
function of the plant and tree roots is the entanglement of dead plant 
life. Vegetation holds back moisture at the time of melting snows and 
rainy seasons so efficiently that disastrous floods are prevented and a 
continuing flow of water maintained over an extended period. Under 
the pressure of population more and more of the highlands have been 
denuded for agriculture; the forests have often been ruthlessly burned 
down, frequently with the destruction of very valuable timber. The 
ashes from these great conflagrations provided fertilizer for a few good el 
\ 390 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
crops, but these chemicals were dissipated rapidly in the swift flow of 
the water in which they were soluble, with the result that vast areas that 
Nature had taken millenniums to forest have been denuded and the soil 
washed away in a few decades. These mountainsides have become a great 
menace instead of a great storehouse of plant food material for the 
plains country of the streams. Loss of timber which was needed greatly 
for commerce and manufacture has been another disastrous result. 
The heavy rains of the spring now find little impediment and rush 
madly toward the lower levels to carry with them not the rich vegetable 
matter of the previous era, but clay and rocks which in a mighty rush 
spread over the vast plains of the lowlands. This material is not good 
soil with which to replenish and fertilize the river bottoms. On the 
contrary, it often covers the plains country with a layer of silt many 
feet deep making it impossible to utilize the fertile soil underneath. 
We have only to look over the departed civilizations of historic times 
to see the wreckage and devastation caused by these processes. The rise 
and fall in succession of such cultures as those of Greece, Rome, North 
Africa, Spain, and many districts of Europe, have followed the pattern 
which we are carving so rapidly with the rise and fall of the modernized 
culture in the United States. 
The complacency with which the masses of the people as well as the 
politicians view our trend is not unlike the drifting of a merry party in 
the rapids above a great cataract. There seems to be no appropriate sense 
of impending doom. 
An outstanding example of our profligate handling of soil and water￾sheds may be seen in our recent experiences in the Mississippi Basin. The 
Ohio River draining the western slopes of the Allegheny Mountains 
has gone on rampages almost annually for a decade carrying with it 
great damage to property and loss of life. Other branches of the Mis￾sissippi, particularly the Missouri, draining the eastern slopes of the 
Rocky Mountains have gone out of control so that vast areas are flooded 
with silt. There is now a concerted effort to stem this series of cataclysms 
by building dykes along the great waterways to raise the banks and dams 
in the higher regions of the watershed to hold back the floods. These 
artificial lakes become settling pools for the silt and soon lose their 
efficiency by being filled with the debris that they are holding back 
from the lower levels. An effort is also being made to reforest which is purposeful, but when we consider the millenniums of time that Nature has required to build the tanglewood of plant life, shrubbery and trees over the rocks and through the gullies to act as great defenses for SS le of.

holding back the water, these modern programs offer very little assurance 
for early relief. 
Another very destructive force is the wind. When surfaces are 
denuded either at high or low altitudes the wind starts carving up the 
soil and starts it on the march across the country. We call the demon￾strations dust storms. When we travel through our Western States, 
it is not uncommon to see buildings and trees partially buried in these 
rolling dunes of drifting sand. When we were travelling across the 
desert of Peru in 1937, we saw in many places mountain-like dunes 
rolling slowly across the country, frequently so completely blocking 
former trafic routes that long detours were necessary. When we were 
flying over eastern Australia in search of groups of primitive aborigines, 
we saw great forests gradually being engulfed with these marching bil￾lows of sand so that most of the trees were covered to their tips. 
Few people will realize that it is estimated that only about 45 per cent 
of the land surface of the United States is now available for agricultural 
purposes and grazing. This includes vast areas that are rapidly approach￾ing the limit of utility. 
In one of my trips to the Western States I visited a large ranch of 
some fifty thousand acres. I asked the rancher whether he was con￾scious of a depletion in the soil of the ranch in its ability to carry 
pasture cattle. He said that it was very greatly depleted, that whereas 
formerly the cows on the ranch were able to produce from ninety-three to 
ninety-five healthy calves per hundred cows annually, nearly all of sufh￾ciently high physical quality to be available for reproductive purposes, 
‘ now he was getting only forty to forty-four calves per hundred cows 
annually and usually only ten or eleven of these were physically fit for 
reproductive purposes. He stated also that he was able to raise as many 
calves for restocking the ranch on the plant food produced on the fifty 
acres to which he was applying a high fertilization program as on the 
rest of the fifty-thousand-acre ranch. Of late most of the calves for the 
ranch had to be imported from other states. 
* In a city in the vicinity I inquired of the director of public health 
what the death rate was among their children up to one year of age. 
He stated that the figures were progressively increasing in spite of the 
fact that they were giving free hospitalization and free prenatal and 
_ postnatal care for all mothers who could not afford to pay for the service. 
This death rate had more than doubled in fifty years. I asked how he 
interpreted the increasing mortality rate among the infants and mothers. 
His comment was in effect that they could not explain the cause, but 
that they knew that the mothers of this last generation were far less fit 392 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
physically for reproduction than their mothers or grandmothers had 
been. 
To many uninformed people the answer will seem simple. Those who 
are responsible for these programs, recognize the difficulty in replenish￾ing the exhausted minerals and food elements in adequate quantity. I 
have been informed by the director of the department of agriculture 
of the state of Ohio that it would cost fifty dollars per acre to restore 
the phosphorus alone that has been exhausted during the last fifty to 
one hundred years. He stated that the problem is still further complicated 
by the fact that the farmer cannot go to a bank and borrow money to 
buy this fertilizer. If, however, he buys adjoining acreage to double his 
own, he can then borrow twice as much money as he can on his own 
farm. But this is not all of the difficulty. Recent data indicate that if 
sufficient phosphorus in a form easily available for plant use were supplied 
to the land at once, it would kill the plant life; it must be provided in 
a form in which by a process of weathering it is made slowly available 
for plant utilization. Phosphorus is only one of the minerals that is 
readily taken from the soil. Other minerals also are difficult to provide. 
I have been able practically to double the weight and size of beets in five 
weeks by the addition of a tablespoonful of ferric ammonium citrate to 
each square foot of garden soil. 
An important commentary on soil depletion is provided by the large 
number of farms that have been abandoned in many districts through￾out the United States. The severe industrial depression which has thrown 
large numbers of shop and mill workers out of employment, has induced 
a considerable number of these to return to the land for subsistence. As 
one drives through farming districts that once were very fertile many 
farms are seen apparently abandoned insofar as tillage is concerned. 
In my studies on the relation of the physiognomy of the people of 
various districts to the soil, I have found a difference in the facial type 
of the last generation of young adults when compared with that of 
their parents. The new generation has inherited depleted soil. In many 
communities three generations of adults are available for study. The 
yardstick for these comparisons has been developed in the preceding 
chapters. It will be of interest for the readers to apply this yardstick to 
their own brothers and sisters in comparison with the parents and par￾ticularly their grandparents. The most serious problem confronting the coming generations is this nearly unsurmountable handicap of depletion of the quality of the foods because of the depletion of the minerals of the soil.

PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 
[ THE observations and deductions presented in the foregoing chapters 
are exerting as controlling an influence on individual and national 
character as seems to be indicated, the problem of the outlook for our 
modern civilization is changed in many important aspects. One of the 
most urgent changes in our viewpoint should be to look upon the 
assortment of physical, mental and moral distortions as due, in consid￾erable part, to nutritional disturbances in one or both parents which 
modify the development of the child, rather than to accepted factors in 
the inheritance. The evidence indicates that these parental disturbances 
of nutritional origin may affect the germ plasm, thus modifying the 
architecture, or may prevent the mother from building a complete fetal 
structure, including the brain. In other words, these data indicate that 
instead of dealing entirely with hereditary factors, we are dealing in 
part with distortions due to inhibitions of normal hereditary processes. 
This changes the prospects for the offspring of succeeding generations. 
Atavism will still have plenty to her credit even if she must give up 
her claim to distortions of individual characteristics. 
Jacobson’ has summarized the determining factors in individuality 
and personality when he says “The Jekyll-Hydes of our common life 
are ethnic hybrids.”’ Most current interpretations are fatalistic and leave 
practically no escape from our succession of modern physical, mental 
and moral cripples. Jacobson says of our modern young people: 
Very much of the strange behavior of our young people to-day is simply 
due to their lack of ethnical anchorage; they are bewildered hybrids, unable 
to believe sincerely in anything, and disowned by their own ancestral manes. 
To turn these neurotic hybrids loose in the world by the million, with no 
background, no heritage, no code, is as bad as imposing illegitimacy; their 
behavior, instead of expressing easily, naturally and spontaneously a long-used 
credo, will be determined by fears and senseless taboos. How can character be 
built upon such foundations? 
There is a ludicrous as well as a pathetic side to the situation presented by a 
Greek puzzled by his predominantly German children, or by the German 
woman unable to understand her predominantly Spanish progeny. It is a foolish 
case over again of hen hatching ducklings, of wolf fostering foundlings. 
394 APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 395 
If our modern degeneration were largely the result of incompatible 
racial stocks as indicated by these premises, the outlook would be gloomy 
in the extreme. Those who find themselves depressed by this current 
interpretation of controlling forces would do well to recall the experi￾ments on pigs referred to in Chapters 17 and 18, in which a large colony 
all born blind and maimed because of maternal nutritional deficiency— 
from deficient vitamin A—were able to beget offspring with normal eyes 
and normal bodies when they themselves had normal nutrition. 
Much emphasis has been placed on the incompatibility of certain 
racial bloods. According to Jacobson,' 
Aside from the effects of environment, it may safely be assumed that when 
two strains of blood will not mix well a kind of “molecular insult” occurs 
which the biologists may some day be able to detect beforehand, just as blood 
is now tested and matched for transfusion. 
It is fortunate that there is a new explanation for the distressing old 
doctrine which holds that geniuses cannot be born unless there is an 
abundant crop of defectives. In this connection Jacobson says, 
The genius tends to be a product of mixed ethnic and nervously peculiar 
stock—stock so peculiar that it exhibits an unusual amount of badness. The 
human family pays dearly for its geniuses. Just as nature in general is prodigal 
in wasting individuals for the development of a type, or species, so do we here 
find much human wastage apparently for a similar purpose. One may think 
of the insane and the defectives as so many individuals wasted in order that 
a few geniuses may be developed. It would seem that in order to produce one 
genius there must be battalions of criminals, weaklings and lunatics. Nietzsche 
must have had biologic implications of this sort in mind when he spoke of the 
masses as merely “‘fercilizers” for the genius. This is why the genius has been 
compared to the lily on the dunghill. He absorbs all the energy of his family 
group, leaving the fertilizing mass depleted. 
Our recent data on the primitive races indicate that this theory is 
not true, since in a single generation various types and degrees of 
physical, mental or moral crippling may occur in spite of their purity of 
blood and all that inheritance could accomplish as a reinforcement 
through the ages. 
The extent to which the general public has taken for granted that 
there is a direct relationship between mental excellence and mental 
deficiency is illustrated by the commonly heard expression “great wits 
and fools are near akin” which expresses tersely the attitude of a modern 
school of psychiatry. This doctrine is not supported by controlled data 
from scientifically organized investigations. One of the principal ex- 396 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
ponents quoted is Maudsley who stated “it is not exaggeration to say 
that there is hardly ever a man of genius who has not insanity or nervous 
disorder of some form in his family.” Many reviews of the lives of great 
men have been published in support of this doctrine. Havelock Ellis, 
however, one of the leading psychologists and psychiatrists of our day, 
has shown that the percentage of cases substantiating this doctrine is 
less than 2 per cent and less than half that proportion found in the 
population at large, which in a tested group he found to be 4.2 per cent. 
East of Harvard in discussing this problem states, after reviewing the 
evidence pro and con: “Thus it is seen that where one collates the work 
of the most competent investigators on the possibility of relation between 
insanity and genius the conclusion is unavoidable that none exists.” 
Those who still believe in the old fatalistic doctrines may answer 
the questions why the last child is affected seriously much more often 
than would be expected through chance; or why the most severe defec￾tives are born after mothers have exceeded forty years of age; and still 
further why our defectives are found chiefly among the later members 
of large families. These facts are not explainable by Mendel’s laws of 
heredity. 
Professor J. C. Brash, of the University of Birmingham, in his mono￾graph? discusses the current theories in detail. He emphasizes the role of 
heredity as the controlling factor in the origin of divergencies. However, 
all of the distortions of the face and jaws which he presents as being re￾lated to heredity can be duplicated, as I have shown, in the disturbances 
appearing in the first and second generation after primitive racial stocks 
have adopted the foods of our modern civilizations in displacement of 
their native foods. He emphasizes the importance of an adequate diet 
during the growth period of the child, and also the fact that malocclusion 
is not a direct manifestation of rickets. Hellman has emphasized the im￾portance of childhood diseases. The disturbances which we are studying 
here, however, are not related to these influences. 
Two of the outstanding advances in laboratory and clinical approach 
to this problem of the relation of the structure of the brain to its func￾tion as expressed in mentality and behavior have been the work of 
Tredgold in England, referred to in Chapter 19, and the “Waverly 
Researches in the Pathology of the Feeble-Minded,” in Massachusetts. 
Tredgold recognizes two sources of brain injury, “germinal blight” and 
“arrest” and puts particular stress on the former as being pathological 
and not spontaneous, and related to the germ of either or both parents 
due to poisoning of the germ cell. The “arrest” problems have to do with 
intra-uterine environmental disturbances. APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 597 
The Waverly group have made very detailed anatomical studies, both 
gross and microscopic, of brains of mental defectives and related these 
data to the clinical characteristics of the individuals both mental and 
physical when living. They have reported in detail two groups of studies 
of ten individuals each. In their summary of the second group they 
state:* 
The provisional conclusions drawn from the second series and the combined 
first and second series are much in agreement with the original conclusions 
drawn from the first series which were as follows: First that measurable brain 
can be correlated with testable mind in the low and high orders with fairly 
positive results. That is the small simple brains represented the low intellects 
or idiots and the most complex brain patterns corresponded to the high grade, 
moronic and subnormal types of feeble-mindedness. 
The lessons from the primitive races demonstrate certain procedures 
that should be adopted for checking the progressive degeneration of our 
modernized cultures. If, as now seems indicated, mal-development with 
its production of physical, mental and moral cripples is the result of 
forces that could have been reduced or prevented, by what program 
shall we proceed to accomplish this reduction or prevention? 
I have presumed in this discussion that the primitive races are able 
to provide us with valuable information. In the first place, the primitive 
peoples have carried out programs that will produce physically excellent 
babies. This they have achieved by a system of carefully planned nutri￾tional programs for mothers-to-be. It is important to note that they 
begin this process of special feeding long before conception takes place, 
not leaving it, as is so generally done until after the mother-to-be knows 
she is pregnant. In some instances special foods are given the fathers￾to-be, as well as the mothers-to-be. Those groups of primitive racial 
stocks who live by the sea and have access to animal life from the sea, 
have depended largely upon certain types of animal life and animal 
products. Specifically, the Eskimos, the people of the South Sea Islands, 
the residents of the islands north of Australia, the Gaelics in the Outer 
Hebrides, and the coastal Peruvian Indians have depended upon these 
products for their reinforcement. Fish eggs have been used as part of 
this program in all of these groups. The cattle tribes of Africa, the 
Swiss in isolated high Alpine valleys, and the tribes living in the higher 
altitudes of Asia, including northern India, have depended upon a very 
high quality of dairy products. Among the primitive Masai in certain 
districts of Africa, the girls were required to wait for marriage until the 
time of the year when the cows were on the rapidly growing young grass 
and to use the milk from these cows for a certain number of months 398 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
before they could be married. In several agricultural tribes in Africa 
the girls were fed on special foods for six months before marriage. The 
need for this type of program is abundantly borne out by recent experi￾mental work on animals, such as I have reported in Chapters 17, 18 
ance 9, 
Another important feature of the control of excellence of child life 
among the primitive races has been the systematic spacing of children by 
control of pregnancies. The interval between children ranged from two 
and a half to four years. For most of the tribes in Africa this was 
accomplished by the plural-wife system. The wife with the youngest 
child was protected. 
The original Maori culture of New Zealand accomplished the same 
end by birth control and definite planning. In one of the Fiji Island 
tribes the minimum spacing was four years. 
These practices are in strong contrast with either the haphazard, 
entirely unorganized programs of individuals in much of our modern 
civilization, or the organized over-crowding of pregnancies also current. 
The question arises immediately: what can be done in the light of the 
data that I have presented in this volume to improve the condition of 
our modern civilization? A first requisite and perhaps by far the most 
important is that of providing information indicating why our present 
haphazard or over-crowded programs of pregnancies are entirely inade￾quate. This should include, particularly, the education of the high￾school-age groups, both girls and boys. 
In the matter of instruction of boys and girls it is of interest that 
several of the primitive races have very definite programs. In some, 
childbirth clinics supervised by the midwife are held for the growing 
girls. With several of these tribes, however, the ease with which child￾birth is accomplished is so great that it is looked upon as quite an insig￾nificant experience. Among the ancient Peruvians, particularly the 
Chimu culture, definite programs were carried out for teaching the 
various procedures in industry, home-building and home management. 
This was accomplished by reproducing in pottery form, as on practical 
water jugs, the various incidents to be demonstrated. The matter of 
childbirth was reproduced in detail in pottery form so that it was 
common knowledge for all young people from earliest observation to 
the time the practical problems arose. Many of the problems related 
directly were similarly illustrated in pottery forms. 
It is not sufficient that information shall be available through maternal 
health clinics to young married couples. If pigs need several months of 
special feeding in order that the mothers-to-be may be prepared for APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM yoo 
adequate carrying forward of all of the inheritance factors in a high 
state of perfection, surely human mothers-to-be deserve as much con￾sideration. It is shown that it is not adequate that sufficient vitamin A 
be present to give the appearance of good health. If highly efficient 
reproduction is to be accomplished there must be a greater quantity than 
this. There is no good reason why we, with our modern system of 
transportation, cannot provide an adequate quantity of the special 
foods for preparing women for pregnancy quite as efficiently as the 
primitive races who often had to go long distances without other trans￾portation than human carriers. 
The primitive care of a newborn infant has been a matter of severe 
criticism by modernists especially those who have gone among them to 
enlighten them in modern ways of child rearing. It is common practice 
among many primitive tribes to wrap the newborn infant in an absorbent 
moss, which is changed daily. A newborn infant, however, does not 
begin having regular all over baths for a few weeks after birth. While 
this method is orthodox among the primitives it is greatly deplored as 
a grossly cruel and ignoble treatment by most moderns. Dr. William 
Forest Patrick of Portland, Oregon was deeply concerned over the 
regularly occurring rash that develops on newborn infants shortly after 
they are first washed and groomed. He had a suspicion that Nature had 
a way of taking care of this. In 1931 he left the original oily varnish on 
several babies for two weeks without the ordinary washing and greasing. 
He found them completely free from the skin irritation and infection 
which accompanies modern treatment. This method was adopted by the 
Multanomah County Hospital of Oregon which now reports that in 
1,916 cases of unwashed, unanointed babies only two cases of pyodermia 
occurred. They record that each day the clothing was changed and 
buttocks washed with warm water. Beyond this the infants were not 
handled. Dr. Patrick states that within twelve hours after birth by 
Nature’s method the infant’s skin is clear, and Nature’s protective film 
has entirely disappeared. In my observations of the infant’s care among 
primitive races I have been continually impressed with the great infre￾quency with which we ever hear a primitive child cry or express any 
discomfort from the treatment it receives. Of course, when hungry they 
make their wants known. The primitive mother is usually very prompt, 
if possible, to feed her child. 
Among the important applications that can be made of the wisdom 
of the primitive races is one related to methods for the prevention of 
those physical defects which occur in the formative period and which 
result in physical, mental and moral crippling. When I visited the native Fic. 129. This Fiji woman has come a long distance to gather special foods needed for 
the production of a healthy child. These and many primitive people have understood the 
necessity for special foods before marriage, during gestation, during the nursing period and 
for rebuilding before the next pregnancy. APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 401 
Fijian Museum at Suva, I found the director well-informed with regard 
to the practices of the natives in the matter of producing healthy normal 
children. He provided me with a shell of a species of spider crab which 
the natives use for feeding the mothers so that the children will be 
physically excellent and bright mentally, clearly indicating that they 
were conscious that the mother’s food influenced both the physical and 
mental capacity of the child. The care with which expectant mothers 
were treated was unique’in many of the Pacific Islands. For example, in 
one group we were informed that the mother told the chief immediately 
when she became pregnant. The chief called a feast in celebration and 
in honor of the new member that would come to join their colony. At 
this feast the members of the colony pledged themselves to adopt the 
child if its own parents should die. At this feast the chief appointed one 
or two young men to be responsible for going to the sea from day to 
day to secure the special sea foods that expectant mothers need to nourish 
the child. Recent studies on the vitamin content of crabs have shown 
that they are among the richest sources available. We have then for 
modern mothers the message from these primitives to use the sea foods 
liberally, both during the preparatory period in anticipation of preg￾nancy and during that entire period. In Fig. 129 will be seen a woman of 
one of the Fiji Islands who had gone several miles to the sea to get this 
particular type of lobster-crab which she believed, and which her tribal 
custom had demonstrated, was particularly efficient for producing a 
highly perfect infant. 
For the Indians of the far North this reinforcement was accomplished 
by supplying special feedings of organs of animals. Among the Indians 
in the moose country near the Arctic circle a larger percentage of the 
children were born in June than in any other month. This was accom￾plished, I was told, by both parents eating liberally of the thyroid 
glands of the male moose as they came down from the high mountain 
areas for the mating season, at which time the large protuberances carry￾ing the thyroids under the throat were greatly enlarged. 
Among the Eskimos I found fish eggs were eaten by the childbearing 
women, and the milt of the male salmon by the fathers for the purpose 
of reinforcing reproductive efficiency. 
The coastal Indians in Peru ate the so-called angelote egg, an organ of 
the male fish of an ovoviviparous species. These organs were used by the 
fathers-to-be and the fish eggs by the mothers-to-be. 
In Africa I found many tribes gathering certain plants from swamps 
and marshes and streams, particularly the water hyacinth. These plants 
were dried and burned for their ashes which were put into the foods of 402 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
mothers and growing children. A species of water hyacinth is shown in 
Fig. 130. The woman shown in Fig. 130, with an enormous goiter, had 
come down from a nine-thousand-foot level in the mountains above 
4 
Fic. 130. This African woman with goiter has come down from the 9600 foot level in 
the mountains in Belgian Congo near the source of the Nile to a 6000 foot level to gather 
special plants for burning to carry the ashes up to her family to prevent goiter in her 
children. Right, a Nile plant, a water hyacinth burned for its ashes. 
Lake Edward. Here all the drinking water was snow water which did 
not carry iodine. She had come down from the high area to the six￾thousand-foot level to gather the water hyacinth and other plants to 
obtain the ashes from these and other iodine carrying plants to carry 
back to her children to prevent, as she explained, the formation of 
“big neck,” such as she had. The people living at the six-thousand-foot 
level also use the ashes of these plants. 
Among many of the tribes in Africa there were not only special 
nutritional programs for the women before pregnancy, but also during 
the gestation period, and again during the nursing period. 
As an illustration of the remarkable wisdom of these primitive tribes, 
I found them using for the nursing period two cereals with unusual 
properties. One, was a red millet which was not only high in carotin 
but had a calcium content of five to ten times that of most other cereals. 
They used also for nursing mothers in several tribes in Africa, a cereal 
called by them linga-linga. This proved to be the same cereal under the 
name of quinua that the Indians of Peru use liberally, particularly the 
nursing mothers. The botanical name is quinoa. This cereal has the APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 403 
remarkable property of being not only rich in minerals, but a powerful 
stimulant to the flow of milk. I have found no record of the use of 
similar cereals among either the English or American peoples. In 
Chapter 14, I presented data indicating that the Peruvians, who were 
descendants of the old Chimu culture on the coast of Peru, used fish 
eggs liberally during the developmental period of girls in order that 
they might perfect their physical preparation for the later responsibility 
of motherhood. These fish eggs were an important part of the nutrition 
of the women during their reproductive period. They were available 
both at the coast market of Peru and as dried fish eggs in the highland 
markets, whence they were obtained by the women in the high Sierras 
to reinforce their fertility and efficiency for childbearing. A chemical 
analysis of the dried fish eggs that I brought to my laboratory from 
Alaska as well as of samples brought from other places has revealed 
them to be a very rich source of body-building minerals and vitamins. 
Here again, I have found no record of their use in our modern civilization 
for reinforcing physical development and maternal efficiency for repro￾duction. As I have noted in Chapter 15 special nutrition was provided 
for the fathers by tribes in the Amazon jungle, as well as by the coastal 
tribes. 
Professor Drummond, a British bio-chemist, in discussing the question 
of the modern decline in fertility, before the Royal Society of Medicine: 
suggested that the decline in the birth rate in European countries, during 
the last fifty years, was due, largely, to the change in national diets 
which resulted from the removal of vitamins B and E from grains when 
the embryo or germ was removed in the milling process. He called atten￾tion to the fact that the decline in the birth rate corresponded directly 
with the time when the change was made in the milling process so that 
refined flour was made available instead of the entire grain product. 
Of the many problems on which the experience of the primitive races 
can throw light, probably none is more pressing than practical pro￾cedures for improving child life. Since this has been shown to be largely 
dependent upon the architectural design, as determined by the health of 
the parental germ cells and by the prenatal environment of the child, 
the program that is to be successful must begin early enough to obviate 
these various disturbing forces. The normal determining factors that 
are of hereditary origin may be interrupted in a given generation but 
need not become fixed characteristics in the future generations. This 
question of parental nutrition, accordingly, constitutes a fundamental 
determining factor in the health and physical perfection of the offspring. 
One of the frequent problems brought to my attention has to do 404 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
with the responsibility of young men and women in the matter of the 
danger of transmitting their personal deformities to their offspring. 
Many, indeed, with great reluctance and sense of personal loss decline 
marriage because of this fear, a fear growing out of the current teach￾ing that their children will be marked as they have been. 
On the presumption that all mentally crippled individuals will be 
in danger of transmitting these qualities to their offspring there is a 
strong movement continually in operation toward segregating such in￾dividuals or incapacitating them by sterilization. Several primitive 
racial stocks have produced large populations without criminals and 
defectives by means of an adequate nutritional program which pro￾vided normal development and function. May it not be that even our 
defectives, when they have resulted from poisoning of germ cells or 
interference with an adequate normal intrauterine environment, may 
be able to build a society with a high incidence of perfection, that wil! 
progressively return toward Nature’s ideal of human beings with nor￾mal physical, mental and moral qualities? 
Because of its interpretation of the individual’s responsibility for his 
mental and moral qualities, society has not only undertaken to pro￾tect itself from the acts of so-called unsocial individuals but has pro￾ceeded to treat them as though they were responsible for the injury 
that society has done to them. Does it not seem inevitable that this 
apparently false attitude will change if it be demonstrated that they 
are the result of a program of inadequate nutrition for the parents. 
As we have seen, the children born in many of the families of primi￾tive racial stocks after the parents have adopted our modernized dietary, 
may have marked changes in the facial and dental arch forms. In our 
modernized white civilization this change occurs so frequently that in 
a considerable percentage of the families there is seen a progressive nar￾rowing of the dental arches in the succeeding children of the same 
family. Since the position of the permanent teeth which erupt at from 
seven to twelve years of age, can be determined by x-rays early in child 
life, this procedure provides an opportunity to anticipate deformities 
that will make their appearance with the eruption of the permanent 
teeth. 
In Fig. 131, may be seen the x-rays of the upper arches of three chil￾dren. Even under conditions causing the permanent teeth to develop 
irregularly the deciduous dental arch will not show the deformity that 
will be expressed later in the permanent dental arch. The abnormal 
placement of the developing permanent teeth, however, will show the 
deformity that is later to be produced in the face even though the de- APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 405 
ciduous arch is normal in design. Both deciduous and permanent teeth 
can be seen at the same time. In Fig. 131 it will be seen that there is a 
progressive deformity revealed in the position of the permanent teeth in 
these three children. (Most severe in the youngest.) This narrowing of 
the curve made by the permanent teeth is a condition characteristic of a 
large number of individuals, occurring in at least 25 per cent of the 
families throughout the United States; in some districts the percentage 
will reach 50 to 75 per cent. 
Another striking illustration of this progressive injury in the younger 
members of the family, detected early by the x-rays, is shown in Fig. 
132. Note the breadth of the arch of the permanent teeth of the oldest 
child (to the left), and the marked narrowing of the arch of the two 
younger children (to the right). 
While the application of orthodontic procedures for the improve￾ment of the facial form and arrangement of the teeth will make a vast 
improvement in facial expression, that procedure will not modify dis￾turbances in other parts of the body, such as the abnormal underde￾velopment of the hips and pelvic bones. If an improvement in nutrition 
for the mothers-to-be is adequately provided in accordance with the 
procedures of the primitives, it should be possible to prevent this pro￾gressive lowering of the capacity of our modern women to produce 
physically fit children. 
Fig. 133 is another illustration. The oldest child, ten years of age, is 
shown at the upper left. She has a marked underdevelopment of the 
width of the face and dental arches. The nostrils are abnormally nar￾row and she tends to be a mouth breather. She is very nervous and is 
becoming stooped. In the lower left photograph, is shown an x-ray of 
the narrowed upper arch. At the right is shown her younger sister, six 
years of age. It will be seen that the proportions of her face are much 
more normal and that she breathes with complete ease through her nose. 
She has none of the nervous trouble of her older sister. In the x-rays, 
below, at the right, it will be seen that her permanent arch, as indi￾cated by the positions of the permanent teeth, although not so far 
advanced as that of her sister, has good design. The history of these 
pregnancies is of interest. The duration of labor for the first child was 
fifty-three hours and for the second three hours. Following the birth of 
the first child the mother was a partial invalid for several months. Fol￾lowing that of the second child the experience of childbirth made but 
slight impression on the strength and health of the mother. During the 
first pregnancy no special effort was made to reinforce the nutrition 
of the mother. During the second pregnancy the selection of foods was 406 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

and high vitamin natural cod liver oil. It is a usual experience that the 
difficulties of labor are greatly decreased and the strength and vitality of 
the child enhanced where the mother has adequately reinforced nutri￾tion along these lines during the formative period of the child. APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 409 
The problem of maternal responsibility with regard to the physical capacity of their offspring to reproduce a healthy new generation com- prises one of the most serious problems confronting modern degenerating 
society. In a previous chapter I have discussed the difficulty that zoolog￾ical garden directors have had in rearing members of the cat family in 
captivity. It has been a very general experience until the modern system 
of feeding animal organs was instituted, that unless the mothers-to-be 
had themselves been born in the jungle the lack of development of the 
pelvic arch would frequently prevent normal birth of their young. In 
the Cleveland Zoo a very valuable tigress, that had been born in cap￾tivity, found it impossible to give birth to her young. Although a 
Caesarian operation was performed, she lost her life. The young also 
died. One of the veterinaries told me that the pelvic arch was entirely 
too small to allow the young to pass through the birth canal. Studies 
of the facial bones of this animal showed marked abnormality in de￾velopment. 
The result of disturbance in the growth of the bones of the head 
and of the development of general body design is quite regularly a nar￾rowing of the entire body, and often there is a definite lengthening. 
Statistics have been published relative to the increase in the height of 
girls in colleges during the last few decades. This is probably a bad 
rather than a good sign as actually it is an expression of this change in 
the shape of the body. I am informed by gynecologists that narrowing 
of the pelvic arch is one of the factors that is contributing to the in￾creased difficulties that are encountered in childbirth by our modern 
generation. 
A typical case illustrating the relationship between the lack of pelvic 
development and deformity of the face, is presented in Fig. 134. This 
girl presented a very marked underdevelopment of the lower third of 
the face which produced the appearance of protrusion of her upper 
teeth so that it was quite difficult or impossible for her to cover them 
with her lips. An operation to improve her appearance consisted in re￾moving the first bicuspid on each side above and then moving the bone 
carrying the anterior teeth backward with appliances, the width of the 
two removed teeth. This changed the relationship of the teeth as shown 
in the two upper views in Fig. 134. The operation greatly improved her 
facial appearance and she lost the inferiority complex which had pre￾vented her from mingling with young people. When she went to the 
hospital for her first child, there was special concern because of her 
weak heart, and every effort was made to obtain a normal birth rather 
than one by Caesarian section. This proved impossible and the Caesarian 410 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

Fic. 134. This girl suffered with a serious deformity of her face. She alse had very con￾tracted pelvic arch. The facial deformity was improved as shown. She nearly lost her life 
with the birth of her first baby which was removed by Caesarian operation. Note her badly 
deformed back from the overload of reproduction. APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 411 
operation was done. Great difficulty was experienced in saving the life 
of the mother and child. Her boyish figure, of which she had been so 
proud, and which had been a part of her serious deformity, during her 
formative period had nearly resulted in her undoing. She nursed her 
baby for some time but the overdraft of reproduction on her frail body 
was so great that she aged rapidly, her back weakened and she stooped 
forward as shown in Fig. 134, lower right. In the view at the lower 
left, it will be seen that the teeth remained in their new position. A point 
to keep in mind is that her physical deficiency was probably directly 
caused by an inadequate nutrition of her mother during the intrauterine 
development and prior to conception. It is, of course, possible that the 
father also contributed a poisoned germ cell that constituted a disturb￾ance in the architectural design of the offspring. In this connection, it is 
important to have in mind the tragic influence of a program of deliber￾ate starvation of mothers-to-be in order that the bones of the baby 
may be soft and thus provide an easy birth. Some literature has been 
published indicating the foods that would be efficient in accomplishing 
this. This means almost certain wreckage or handicapping of the child’s 
life. 
Information from many sources may suggest that the expectant 
mother needs more calcium and more vitamin D. She may go to the phar￾macy with a prescription or on her own initiative obtain calcium tablets 
and so-called vitamin D as a synthetic preparation. We are concerned here 
with data which will throw light on the comparative value of the treat￾ment the modern mother will thus give herself with that that the 
primitive mother would provide. 
Dr. Wayne Brehm who is associated with two Columbus, Ohio, hos￾pitals has recently published the results’? of a study of the effect of the 
treatment received in 540 obstetrical cases divided into six groups of 
ninety individuals each, on the basis on which their nutrition was rein￾forced in order to study the comparative effects of the different treat￾ments. The reinforcement of the diet consisted in Group 1 of taking 
calcium and synthetic vitamin D as viosterol; Group 2, calcium alone; 
Group 3, viosterol alone; Group 4, calcium and cod liver oil; Group 5, 
cod liver oil alone and Group 6, no reinforcement. For those receiving 
the calcium and viosterol there was extensive calcification in the pla￾centae, marked closure of the fontanelle (the normal opening in the 
top of the infant skull) and marked calcification in the kidneys. For 
those receiving calcium alone there was no placental calcification, slight 
closure of the fontanelle and no calcification of the kidneys. Group 3 
receiving viosterol had moderate to marked placental calcification, mod- 412 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
erate closure of the fontanelle and no calcification of the kidneys. Those 
receiving cod liver oil alone had very slight placental calcification, slight 
fontanelle closure and no calcification in the kidneys. Those receiving no 
reinforcement had very slight placental calcification, normal fontanelle 
closures and no calcification of the kidneys. The effect on the mother 
was a prolonging of labor in Group 1 and at birth the fetal heads were 
less moulded not being able to adjust their shape to the shape of the 
birth tube. These infants had a general appearance of ossification or 
postmaturity. This strongly emphasizes the great desirability of using 
Nature’s natural foods instead of modern synthetic substitutes. 
It is a matter of great importance that the most serious disturbances 
in reproduction and childbirth are occurring in the most civilized parts 
of the world. In Chapter 19 I have referred to the important work of 
Dr. Kathleen Vaughan entitled ‘Safe Childbirth.” She has not only 
had wide experience among several tribes in India and in the British 
Hospitals but has collected a large quantity of information regarding 
the experience of many races throughout the world. Her data strongly 
emphasize the necessity that the growing girl shall be allowed to have 
an active outdoor life not only until the completion of the building of 
her body at about fourteen years of age, but through the child-bearing 
period. In practically all countries a restricted sedentary indoor life 
greatly increases the complications associated with childbirth. She quotes 
Whitridge Williams to the effect that: “At the onset of pregnancy the 
(males) are 125 to 100 (females), and he adds that sex is determined in 
the germ cells, primarily or immediately after their union, and is im￾mutable by the time segmentation of the ovum begins.’ Notwithstand￾ing this advantage, prenatal and infant mortality reduces the proportion 
of boys to a level below that of girls. Dr. Vaughan in her reference to 
the data on the annual report of the chief medical officer, the Minister of 
Health, states as follows: 
Our infant mortality returns show that over half the number of infants 
dying before they are a year old die before they have lived a month (and 6,744 
of them before they are twenty-four hours old), strongly suggesting that their 
vitality was impaired by the process of birth. The figures of those who did not 
survive one month are 20,060, and of these more than half are males. So we 
lose over ten thousand boys every year under a month old! (Public Health 
Report, No. 55, British). Hear what Dr. Peter McKinley has to say on the 
subject. “The death rate of infants in the period immediately subsequent to 
birth is nine times as high as that which occurs later in the first years of life.” He shows how the difficulty experienced by the mothers during parturition leads to the death of infants at and just after birth, and says in this connection, APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 413 
“Infant deaths under a month are significantly associated with the death rates 
of mothers in childbearing.”’ He quotes Netherland statistics showing that of 
stillbirths due to difficulty during birth, male stillbirths predominate, and says, 
“These figures might be taken in support of the view that the greater size of 
the male head is a cause of some greater difficulty in labour than there is with 
a female birth.’ Here, indeed, in civilized childbirth is the laboratory where 
the sex of the population is finally determined—the actual births of boys and 
girls are nearly equal in number, but the small ones slip through; the larger 
children are the ones who are killed during birth, or so damaged that life is 
heavily handicapped, and we are left with an enormous surplus female popula￾tion. This destruction of male infants, which goes on day by day and year by 
year, puts the consequences of the Great War into the shade. Our surplus 
female population (now reaching over one and a half million in excess of the 
male) is directly due to it. We have no need of Pharaoh’s midwives to kill our 
boys off at birth (Exodus i. 16). Civilization does it unaided, for all civilized 
races as they pass their zenith and are on the downgrade have eventually had 
to face the same problem, the outnumbering of men by women, and most of 
them have met it as the East does to-day by female infanticide. A more intel￾ligent policy would be to prevent the males dying at birth. We see that difficult 
childbirth leads to a high maternal mortality, but it is also the cause of a 
high infant mortality falling most heavily upon the male infants, and it is also 
responsible for the production of mental defectives in ever-increasing numbers. 
Dr. Vaughan’s work places emphasis on the necessity that the human 
body be properly built, especially that of the mother-to-be. She shows 
clearly that the shape of the pelvis is determined by the method of life 
and the nutrition. In all primitive tribes living an outdoor life child￾birth is easy and labor is of short duration. She shows that this is asso￾ciated with a round pelvis and that the distortion of the pelvis to a 
flattened or kidney shape, even to a small degree, greatly reduces the 
capacity and therefore the ease with which the infant head may pass 
through the birth canal. In Dr. Vaughan’s wide experience she has 
observed two ways by which a rough estimate of the pelvic shape and 
capacity may be anticipated: first, by the gait of the individual, because 
the angle of the hips is determined by the shape of the pelvis; and second, 
by the teeth and jaws. She has recognized an association between facial 
and dental arch deformities and deformed pelvis. 
During my investigations in eastern Australia I was informed that 
the birth rate among the whites had declined over a large area and to 
such an extent that many families had no children and many women 
could produce only one child. The diets used in that district were very 
largely refined white-flour products, sugar, polished rice, vegetable fats, 
canned goods and a limited amount of meat. The alarm regarding the 
declining birth rate in Australia has recently been a matter of discussion 414 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
by the New South Wales legislature as indicated by an Associated Press 
dispatch from Sydney, Australia, dated August 1, 1938: “A ‘stork derby’ 
with sweepstakes prizes was proposed in the New South Wales Legis￾lature today to boost Australia’s falling birth rate.” 
A report just received from the Bureau of Home Economics, De￾partment of Agriculture, Washington, presents figures for the average 
amount of the various foods used in different income groups in different 
parts of the United States. These showed that in general about one-third 
of the income up to $2500 was spent for food per family; further, that 
the total flour equivalent ranged from 0.39 to 0.50 pound per capita per 
day. These quantities will furnish about 829 to 1063 calories per day, 
per capita. It will be seen at once that this provides a large number of 
the calories required for growing children and sedentary adults per 
day. With this number of calories derived from refined flour products 
there is no adequate provision for a normal amount of such body-build￾ing materials as minerals and vitamins. These have been removed, largely, 
in the milling process, and are largely denied to our modern civilization 
insofar as the cereal foods are concerned. This includes vitamin E, so 
essential for the functioning of the pituitary gland, the master governor 
of the body. 
One of the most important lessons we may learn from the primitive 
cultures is the detail of their procedures for preventing dental caries. 
Since I have devoted an entire chapter (Chapter 16) to this I will make 
only a brief comment here. Simply stated, the practical application of 
the primitive wisdom for accomplishing this would involve returning 
to the use of natural foods which provide the entire assortment of body￾building and repairing food factors. This means the recognition of the 
fact that all forms of animal life are the product of the food environ￾ments that have produced them. Therefore, we cannot distort and rob 
the foods without serious injury. Nature has put these foods up in 
packages containing the combinations of minerals and other factors that 
are essential for nourishing the various organs. Some of the simpler 
animal forms are able to synthesize in their bodies some of the food 
elements which we humans also require, but cannot create ourselves. 
Our modern process of robbing the natural foods for convenience or 
gain completely thwarts Nature’s inviolable program. I have shown 
how the robbing of the wheat in the making of white flour reduced the 
minerals and other chemicals in the grains, so as to make them sources 
of energy without normal body-building and repairing qualities. Our 
appetites have been distorted so that hunger appeals only for energy 
with no conscious need for body-building and repairing chemicals. APPEICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 415 
A first requisite for the control of tooth decay is to have provided 
an adequate intake of the body-building and repairing factors by the 
time the hunger appeal for energy has been satisfied. A sufficient variety 
of foods must be used to supply the body’s demand for those elements 
which it needs in large quantities, that is, calcium and phosphorus, and 
the other elements which it needs in smaller quantities, though just as 
imperatively. One of the serious human deficiencies is the inability to 
synthesize certain of the activators which include the known vitamins. 
This makes necessary the reinforcement of the nutrition with definite 
amounts of special foods to supply these organic catalysts, especially 
the fat-soluble activators, including the known vitamins, which are par￾ticularly difficult to provide in adequate quantities. I have shown that 
the primitive races studied were dependent upon one of three sources for 
some of these fat-soluble factors, namely, sea foods, organs of animals or 
dairy products. These are all of animal origin. I have indicated in Chap￾ter 16 the nutritional programs that have proved in clinical testing ade￾quate for providing the body with nutrition that will not only prevent 
tooth decay, but check it when it is active. The stress periods of life, 
namely, active growth in children and motherhood, do not constitute 
overloads among most of the primitive races because the factor of safety 
provided by them in the selection of foods is sufficiently high to protect 
them against all stresses. I have indicated the type of nutrition that is es￾pecially needed for these stress periods in our modern civilization. Also, 
that it is not necessary to adopt the foods of any particular racial stock, 
but only to make our nutrition adequate in all its nutritive factors to 
the primitive nutritions. Tooth decay is not only unnecessary, but an 
indication of our divergence from Nature’s fundamental laws of life 
and health. (See Chapter 16 for primitive menus.) 
The responsibility of our modern processed foods of commerce as con￾tributing factors in the cause of tooth decay is strikingly demonstrated 
by the rapid development of tooth decay among the growing children on 
the Pacific Islands during the time trader ships made calls for dried copra 
when its price was high for several months. This was paid for in 90 per 
cent white flour and refined sugar and not over 10 per cent in cloth and 
clothing. When the price of copra reduced from $400 a ton to $4 a ton, 
the trader ships stopped calling and tooth decay stopped when the people 
went back to their native diet. I saw many such individuals with teeth 
with open cavities in which the tooth decay had ceased to be active. 
In undertaking to make practical application of primitive wisdom 
to our modern problems, the field is so broad that only a limited number 
of items may be included. It is important to emphasize the difference 416 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
between the procedures used in the preparation of boys and girls for life 
in many of the primitive groups, and in our modern social organiza￾tion. Few people will realize the remarkable training given the primitive 
children, with the fathers and mothers as tutors. To illustrate, among 
the Indians of the far North in Canada near the Arctic Circle, the girls 
rather than the boys select a companion for life. This is done with the 
help of her parents. Before a boy is considered worthy of consideration 
he must demonstrate that he can build the winter cabin, provide the 
firewood for maintaining the home of the parents, and all of the pro￾visions of wild game, during the trial period of several weeks. After 
an adequate demonstration of bravery as well as of skill, in which the 
boy must kill a grizzly bear, he is accepted into the home for a period 
of trial marriage. The girl has the privilege of making her choice by 
trial, but when the choice is made there is complete faithfulness on the 
part of both. Girls are prepared for life’s duties by being taught to make 
clothing, prepare food, care for children and assist in the maintenance 
of the home. I have seldom, if ever, seen such happy people as these 
forest Indians of the far North. 
In Chapter 10, in discussing the Australian Aborigines, I have simi￾larly described the preparation of boys for the responsibility of man￾hood. No modern college graduate has to win his spurs under more 
exacting examinations and tests than do those boys. 
In Africa several specialties call for special training. The medicine 
men spend several years under the training of a tutor. Each boy must 
provide a specified number of cattle per year which are eaten by the 
group. 
Probably the most indelible impression that is left by my investiga￾tions among primitive races, is that which came from examining 1,276 
skulls of the people who had been buried hundreds of years ago along 
the Pacific Coast of Peru and in the high Andean Plateau, without find￾ing a single skull with the typical marked narrowing of the face and 
dental arches, that afflicts a considerable proportion not only of the 
residents in modernized districts in Peru, but in most of the United 
States and many communities of Europe today. I know of no problem so 
important to our modern civilization as the finding of the reason for 
this, and the elimination of the cause of error. Perhaps few will recog￾nize the significance of this important point. This may be the reason 
why the prospect is not encouraging. 
One of the important lessons we should learn from the primitive 
races is that of the need for maintaining a balance beween soil produc￾tivity, plant growth and human babies. Even in a country with so low APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 417 
a fertility as obtains in the greater part of Australia, the Aborigines for 
a very long period were able to maintain this balance. Their system of 
birth control was very efficient and exacting. 
A survey made by a committee appointed by the League of Nations 
indicates the need per capita of approximately one-half acre of land for 
wheat, two acres for dairy products, and ten acres for beef producing 
pasture for the supply of meat. When we realize that Ohio has been 
occupied by our modern civilization for only one hundred fifty years 
and that it is estimated that during that time approximately half of 
the topsoil has been lost through water and wind erosion we realize 
that Nature’s accumulated vegetable enrichment has been greatly re￾duced in this area within a short time from this one source alone. In 
Chapter 20 I have shown that there is only enough phosphorus in the 
top seven inches of agricultural land for approximately fifty crops of 
high-yield wheat or one hundred crops of moderate-yield. Other grains 
make similar drafts upon the land. I have given data indicating a rela. 
tionship between progressive soil depletion and progressive increase in 
heart disease. 
It is apparent that the present and past one or two generations have 
taken more than their share of the minerals that were available in the 
soil in most of the United States, and have done so without returning 
them. Thus, they have handicapped, to a serious extent, the succeeding 
generations, since it is so difficult to replenish the minerals, and since 
it is practically impossible to accumulate another layer of topsoil, in less 
than a period of many hundreds of years. This constitutes, accordingly, 
one of the serious dilemmas, since human beings are dependent upon 
soil for their animal and plant foods, for body-building. The minerals 
are in turn dependent upon the nutritive factors in the soil for estab￾lishing their quality. The vitamin and protein content of plants has been 
shown to be directly related to availability of soil minerals and other 
nutriments. A program that does not include maintaining this balance 
between population and soil productivity must inevitably lead to dis￾astrous degeneration. Over-population means strife and wars. The his￾tory of the rise and fall of many of the past civilizations has recorded 
a progressive rise, while civilizations were using the accumulated nu￾trition in the topsoil, forest, shrubbery and grass, followed by a pro￾gressive decline, while the same civilizations were reaping the results 
of the destruction of these essential ultimate sources of life. Their cycle 
of rise and degeneration are strikingly duplicated in our present Amer￾ican culture. 
Various therapeutic measures in use today have come to us from 418 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
primitive peoples. One of the greatest scourges of the world is malaria 
fever. Everywhere it has been fought successfully with quinine. Indeed, 
many parts of the world would not have been tenantable for whites 
without it. Yet few people realize that quinine was the gift of the 
ancient Peruvian Indians. 
In Chapter 15 I presented data regarding the treatment used by sev￾eral primitive races for preventing and correcting serious disturbances 
in the digestive tract. This consisted in the use of clay or aluminum 
silicate which modern science has learned has the important quality of 
being able to adsorb and thus collect toxic substances and other products. 
Important new light is now thrown on the probable role of this sub￾stance in the primitive diet and its possible application in our modern 
problems of sensitization reactions or allergies. In the first volume of my 
work on “Dental Infections,” I presented data relating toxic sensitiza￾tion reactions to dental infections. These were shown in both animals 
and human beings. I discussed the relation of these reactions to hista￾mine and emphasized their similarity to the effect produced by inoccu￾lation with histamine. An important new chapter has recently been 
added to this problem by the work of Dr. C. F. Code for which he has 
received an award by the American Association for the Advancement 
of Science. He reported his findings before the Association meeting at 
Richmond, Virginia, in December, 1938. Dr. Code has apparently dis￾covered that histamine is the actual product responsible for the symp￾toms of the various allergies. Its excess accumulation in the blood is 
the actual cause of the symptoms whether expressed as asthma, hay fever 
or skin eruptions such as produced by pollens, various foods, dust and 
other sensitizing agents. He has shown that the eosinophils, a type of 
white blood cell, are the source of excess histamine in the blood. It is 
accordingly indicated that the primitive treatment by the use of kaolin, 
aluminum silicate, as an adsorbent was used directly for controlling 
such symptoms. It is now further indicated that this treatment can be 
helpful for the prevention of modern allergies. Previous investigations 
have shown that histamine is produced in the alimentary tract as a 
putrefaction product of proteins by the action of certain micro-organisms 
of the colon group. 
Modern science boasts the discovery of vitamin C, lack of which 
took its toll of thousands of the white mariners through hundreds of 
years with scurvy. The first recorded cure of that disease was made by 
the Indians in Canada when the British soldiers were dying in large 
numbers. The Indians taught them to use a tea made from the steeped 
tips of the shoots of the spruce. When I was among the Indians of the APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 419 
far north I asked a chief why the Indians did not get scurvy. He then 
proceeded, as I have related in Chapter 15, to explain to me how the 
Indians prevented scurvy by the use of special organs in the animals. While 
it is true that we have come to associate the absence of vitamin C as the 
causative factor in scurvy, we do not know how many other affections 
may be due to its absence in adequate quantity in our foods. Almost 
weekly, new diseases are being associated with vitamin deficiencies in our 
modern dietaries. 
One of our modern tendencies is to select the foods we like, particu￾larly those that satisfy our hunger without our having to eat much, 
and, another is to think in terms of the few known vitamins and their 
effects. The primitive tendency seems to have been to provide an ade￾quate factor of safety for all emergencies by the selection of a sufficient 
variety and quantity of the various natural foods to prevent entirely 
most of our modern affections. Their success demonstrates that their 
program is superior to ours. An important advance in modern inter￾national relationships provides for exchange of professorships and, thus, 
interchanges of wisdom. We have shown a most laudable and sympa￾thetic interest in carrying our culture to the remnants of these primitive 
races. Would it not be fortunate to accept in exchange lessons from 
their inherited knowledge? It may be not only our greatest opportunity, 
but our best hope for stemming the tide of our progressive breakdown 
and also for our return to harmony with Nature’s laws, since life in its 
fullness is Nature obeyed. 
As I have sojourned among members of primitive racial stocks in 
several parts of the world, I have been deeply impressed with their fine 
personalities, and strong characters. I have never felt the slightest fear 
in being among them; I have never found that my trust in them was 
misplaced. As soon as they had learned that I was visiting them in their 
interest, their kindness and devotion was very remarkable. Fundamen￾tally they are spiritual and have a devout reverence for an all-powerful, 
all-pervading power which not only protects and provides for them, but 
accepts them as a part of that great encompassing soul if they obey 
Nature’s laws. 
Ernest Thompson Seton has beautifully expressed the spirit of the 
Indian in the opening paragraph of his little book “The Gospel of the 
Red Man”: 
The culture and civilization of the White man are essentially material; his 
measure of success is, “How much property have I acquired for myself?” The 
culture of the Red man is fundamentally spiritual; his measure of success is, 
“How much service have I rendered to my people?” 420 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
The civilization of the White man is a failure; it is visibly crumbling 
around us. It has failed at every crucial test. No one who measures things by 
results can question this fundamental statement. 
The faith of the primitive in the all-pervading power of which he is 
a part includes a belief in immortality. He lives in communion with the 
great unseen Spirit, of which he is a part, always in humility and rever￾ence. Elizabeth Odell in the following lines seems to express the spirit 
of the primitives, 
Flat outstretched upon a mound 
Of earth I lie; I press my ear 
Against its surface and I hear 
Far off and deep, the measured sound 
Of heart that beats within the ground. 
And with it pounds in harmony 
The swift, familiar heart in me. 
They pulse as one, together swell, 
Together fall; I cannot tell 
My sound from earth’s, for I am part 
Of rhythmic, universal heart. APPLICATION OF PRIMITIVE WISDOM 421

AR HE need for the reprinting of the book and the addition of this supplement 
has been emphasized by the increasing evidence that the perils of our present 
civilization are products of our own creation. The most alarming perils are the 
present world struggle, the foremost reason for which is for control of the 
dwindling sources of food and the progressively increasing percentage of juve￾nile delinquents in our population, and lower intelligence of the children in our 
grade schools. 
Another alarming situation is that of every hundred pregnancies in the 
United States today, twenty-five are not good enough to be born alive and of 
these fifteen are so badly deformed as to be grouped as monsters. Of the seventy￾five born alive, thirty-seven percent or forty-nine individuals prove to be failures 
within fifteen years, due in large part to the development of degenerative dis￾eases. This makes seventy-four of each hundred pregnancies that are either lost 
or are a burden on our modern culture. The twenty-six males and females that 
ate left, or thirteen of each, have the entire responsibility of carrying on business, 
making homes and providing soldiers. Of these thirteen men, if all were sub￾ject to draft, according to the United States Senate report forty percent are 
physically unfit for military service. These thirteen men and thirteen women 
also have the responsibility of the perpetuation of the race. 
My studies of the primitive races in various stages of modernization show 
that the causes of our degeneration are due to our failure to obey nature’s funda￾mental laws of life and that all our qualities, physical, mental and moral are 
primarily determined by the adequateness of our nutrition. This means that the 
parents must have proper preconception nutrition, the mother adequate prenatal 
nutrition to be followed, of course, by correct nutrition for the entire family. 
Our modern degenerative diseases are both an expression of and a measure for 
our dilemma. We can now see why the primitives honored and conserved the 
fertility of the soil, even to the extent of taking their bodies back to the place 
of their birth, in order that they might pay back what they borrowed from the 
soil. They learned this from the grasses and the trees. I have presented new and 
additional data on the controlling influence of soil fertility. 
Practically all of our modern philosophies, both religious and social, fail to 
recognize the nature of the creative forces which preceded all our modern con￾cepts of life and on which all interpretations of life should be founded. It is 
these forces which show how the great Creator made us. I have, therefore, in￾cluded a chapter on our physical and zoological origin. 
Our modern degenerations, physical, mental and moral, are demonstrated in 
scores of ways. Sir Arthur Beecham, reporting on his studies of modern music, 
stated that he had not found a single composition, composed during the past 
ten years, that had qualities worthy of being played by his symphony orchestra. 
433 434 PREFACE TO SUPPLEMENT 
Even our men of science show by their birthplaces their dependence on soil fer￾tility for their mental acumen. This is illustrated in this supplement. 
The primitives show us that man’s sublimity is a measure of his capacity to 
adapt his life to Mother Natures’ laws, just as the birds and butterflies and wild 
animals have done for millions of years. Some primitive races have been doing 
this since before the ice ages. We are living today with several persisting stone 
age cultures. Dr. M. F. Ashley-Montagu, a distinguished anatomist and anthro￾pologist, has discussed these cultures in the June, 1940 issue of Scientific Monthly, 
under the title “The Socio-Biology of Man’. He states, “In spite of our enor￾mous technological advances we spiritually and as human beings are not the 
equal of the average Aboriginal or the average Eskimo—we are very definitely 
their inferiors. We lisp noble ideals and noble sentiments—The Australians and 
the Eskimos practice them—they neither write books nor lecture about them. 
Theirs are the only true democracies where every individual finds his happiness 
in catering to the happiness of the group and where any one who in any way 
threatens the welfare of the group is dealt with as an abnormality”. 
What could be more tragic than that our modern culture is rapidly destroying 
these superb democracies, by poisoning them off with our own defective nutri￾tion and consequent degenerative diseases. We now see more clearly that LIFE 
IN ITS FULLNESS IS NATURE OBEYED. 
For many years I have been asked why these problems of our modern degen￾eration have not been answered by geneticists. It is significant that only in May of 
this year has a grant of $282,000 been announced by the Rockefeller Foundation, 
for a five year study of these problems. It is also significant that Dr. C. C. Little, 
Director of the Jackson Memorial Laboratory, in announcing the grant, made the 
following statements, ‘‘ * * * It has become evident that neither heredity nor 
environment could go far without the other. 
“If for example, the tiny concentrated centers of chemical organization known 
as genes—the basic unit of heredity—had no living organism provided by food 
and growth on which and in which to express their directive powers they would 
be incapable of description, measurement or identification.” 
We are deeply indebted to Dr. Wm. A. Albrecht of the University of Mis￾souri, who has kindly contributed the message on soil fertility for this supple￾ment and to Dr. James G. Needham, Cornell University, whose work on zoology 
entitled “ABOUT OURSELVES”, “A Survey of Human Nature from the Zoo￾logical Viewpoint’, has been quoted. 
Because of the service these lessons from primitive races can render for human 
betterment, I am publishing this enlarged fourth edition myself, in order to 
make it available as generally as may be possible by way of public libraries 
throughout the modernized world. The sale price is as previously, $5.50. Each 
book sold should place a free copy in a public library for aid in post-war re￾habilitation by United Nations.

HEN we speak of “good health’, we are using terms which 
thus far have not yielded to exact definition. Information has 
not yet been tabulated completely enough to tell us just exactly what 
good health is. 
The absence of good health, on the other hand, is recognized by 
many bodily ills and conditions which we describe volubly and with 
precision. What is known as disease is made manifest by myriads of 
variations from the regular structures and functions of the organs. 
It was an early belief by Dr. Price that defective and diseased teeth 
are a manifestation of ill-health. Although dentists were studying such 
teeth for years, there was all the while an apparent increase in dental 
maladies. To Dr. Price it seemed clear that it would be far more fruit￾ful to search out and study those peoples and places where toothache is 
unknown. 
This was a positive approach to health and to the knowledge or 
definition of it. It was a decided contrast to the negative way of study￾ing the body in the absence of health. It was this philosophy that car￾ried the author of this work to many parts of the world to observe and 
study not only the teeth of many peoples, but also to learn what kinds 
of foods they eat, and whether these were eaten raw or processed. It was 
necessary to examine the habits of living and other behaviors of many 
peoples in order to establish the validity of the belief that defective 
teeth are evidence of malnutrition. This travel with its many observa￾tions was supplemented by chemical studies of peoples’ foods, by tests 
of these foods with animals, and numerous other researches. It is the 
record of these efforts and the well ripened mental experiences by an 
able dentist, scientist, and humanitarian intent on the positive aspects 
of good health, that the reader will find in these printed pages. 
Gathered through the eyes and mind of a careful thinker, and faith￾fully recorded by camera and pen, these studies have made it possible 
to superinpose the geographic picture and pattern of health upon the 
fertility pattern of the soils. They have made possible the correlation 
of the health of the native peoples with the types of soils. This soil 
pattern varies as the areas are less humid and the soils mineral-rich in 
their production of proteinaceous crops of high growth values for ant￾mals and peoples, or as the areas are more humid and the soils grow 
435 436 FOREWORD TO SUPPLEMENT 
carbonaceous crops of mainly fuel and fattening values. Dr. Price has 
made excellent contributions to help us see the health pattern as it is a 
reflection of the soil fertility pattern that is determining or controlling 
our nutrition by way of the food plants the soil produces. By that means 
the soil is determining the pattern of all life forms. 
Not only the dentists, doctors, clinicians, diagnosticians, and others 
professionally responsible for the treatment of clients’ maladies will 
find interest in this volume, but also all who are intelligently interested 
in health for its own sake. Those who are scientists in a broader way 
and hopeful for a better understanding of their own body nourishment 
and well-being will find this volume of help. It is particularly essential 
that those in public positions with humanitarian responsibilities get 
some glimpses of Dr. Price’s philosophy as it points to good nutrition 
as prevention of abnormalities of body, mind, and spirit that have, ac￾cording to him, been provoking the increase of juvenile delinquencies. 
Good nutrition from foods grown with an understanding of their greater 
body services to prevent delinquencies puts health in a positive position 
and will relieve us of the increasing struggle for additional medical 
services and hospitalization. 
Nutritious foods and thereby good physical condition and excellent 
health with its feeling of well-being that generates fellowship rather 
than improper foods, physical degeneration, diseases and human strife 
are Dr. Price’s suggestions for us as individuals and as a nation.

A NEW VITAMIN-LIKE ACTIVATOR 
HE seriousness of the dental caries problem in relation to both 
human progress and the dilemma of modern physical degeneration 
emphasizes the need of a bird’s-eye view of the problems involved 
in restoring to man his original immunity. 
) For the entire period of human life on the earth, say one million years, 
_some human skeletons have been preserved in burials. A study of these 
remains reveals that there has been more dental caries in the last hundred 
years than at any time previously and probably more than during any 
thousand-year period of his history. This situation suggests, if it does 
not demand, that we analyze critically the changes in man’s environ￾ment and his interference with it. 
As to our present knowledge of the problem, we find it evaluated in 
the recently published summary made by the Research Commission of 
the American Dental Association. Two hundred thirty-seven investi- 
} gators and observers present their best judgment and experience in 276 
| pages. In this detailed report, we see that there is no recognized theory 
| regarding the etiology of dental caries and no accepted program for the 
control of the disease. So far as progress is concerned, there is much evi- 
| ' dence that, in general, the situation is getting worse from decade to 
| decade. 
While outstanding progress has been made in the knowledge of disease 
in general—knowledge that places great emphasis on the réle of nutri￾tion in modern degeneration — that splendid progress has revealed the 
nature and role of many of its new factors, especially vitamins. It is pro￾foundly significant, however, that no single vitamin or combination of 
vitamins has completely solved the riddle of dental caries or pointed the 
way to a determination of its etiology. This suggests our ignorance as 
regards any speciflc substance for use in controlling dental caries. There 
must be some food substance that is not adequately provided in modern 
nutrition, perhaps owing to some fundamental change in quality, prepa￾ration or selection of the substance. To judge from the skeletal remains, 
437 438 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
people of the past obtained a substance that modern generations do not 
thave. The present report will present evidence of a heretofore not gener￾ally recognized activating substance. It is not one of the recognized vita- 
(mins, but is a substance which belongs in the fat-soluble group. 
The data to be presented will indicate that: (a) it plays an essential 
role in the maximum utilization of body-building minerals and tissue 
| components; (b) its presence can be demonstrated readily in each the 
butterfat of milk of mammals, the eggs of fishes and the organs and fats 
of animals; (c) it has been found in highest concentration in the milk of 
| 
the reindeer and in varying amounts in the milk of several species, vary￾ing with the nutrition of the animal, and (d) it is synthesized by the 
mammary glands and plays an important réle in infant growth and also 
in reproduction. 
Experimental Data 
In 1926, Yoder’ published a report on the “Relation Between Peroxi￾dation and Antirachitic Vitamins,” including a chemical procedure for 
determining antirachitic potency. When Vitamin D was separated from 
vitamin A, its role included the functions of activated ergosterol, which 
came to be known as vitamin D. While Yoder’s peroxidation method was 
early used as a chemical test for vitamin D, it was later found that it 
measured a nutritional factor much broader than its antirachitic func￾tion. 
In my early reports on the vitamin content of dairy products, I used 
| this test as a measure of the vitamin D content. My data revealed that 
the nutritional factor it represented included aids to mineral utilization, 
| as well as potency for dental caries immunity. I have accordingly used 
| this method for testing the value of foods, particularly dairy products, 
| for potency in controlling dental caries, and of associated health factors. 
| In my early reports’ on the levels of this activating substance in butter 
_as measured by the chemical test reported by Yoder, I expressed the 
values as vitamin D; but, as my studies progressed, it was revealed clearly 
that the qualities which I was concerned with in butter were not com￾parable to vitamin D as represented by ergosterol that had been exposed 
| to ultraviolet radiation. Since butter contained definite nutritional quali- 
| ties not provided in irradiated ergosterol in addition to its antirachitic 
properties, I accordingly dropped the term vitamin D, as expressed in 
| Yoder’s test, and, for want of a better means of identification, used in 
| my records the term activator X. 
| a A NEW VITAMIN-LIKE ACTIVATOR 439 
Since an acceptable chemical test for vitamin A that depended on the 
beets of antimony trichloride in choloroform solution had been devel￾ped by Carr and Price,” I made an extensive number of studies of the 
vitamin A and activator X content of a large series of butter samples 
obtained from many states and provinces and from different countries REY S, e 
4 throughout the world. These studies were related to two other important 
| |studies; namely, sunshine curves and mortality data from various dis- 
| tricts. These studies, which have now been in progress since 1928, include 
jan analysis of more than 20,000 samples of dairy products. In order to 
\ “establish wide application of the data, samples were received every two 
to four weeks from several different parts of the world over a period of 
several years. These included samples from districts of the United States, 
northwestern Canada, Australia, Brazil and New Zealand. we) mower as It was quickly disclosed that neither total hours of sunshine nor tem- 
|< Ge perature was the chief controlling factor. The factor most potent was 
RA found to be the pasture fodder of the dairy animals. Rapidly growing 
grass, green or rapidly dried, was most efficient. It was disclosed that 
these periods of growth were directly related to the rains and harvest, 
and, for the southern states, there were two distinct peaks in the vitamin 
and activator curves, one in the spring and the other in the autumn. In 
general, in moving northward through the United States and through 
the Canadian provinces, these two peaks came closer together and the 
total for the maximum rise was much higher in the northern dairy dis￾tricts than in the southern. By obtaining samples over a very wide range, 
curves for vitamin A and activator X, as shown combined in Figure 135, 
~ were made for the products analyzed from various provinces of the 
United States and Canada. The total area was divided into sixteen divi- 
* sions, each representing several thousand square miles.

jhow much higher the vitamin curves are for the north than for the re￾gions farther south ;also, how much lower the vitamin curves are in the

A NEW VITAMIN-LIKE ACTIVATOR 441 
Simultaneously, dairy products were obtained for analysis from several 
| countries in the southern hemisphere, chiefly, Australia, New Zealand, 
¥ _and Brazil. These again showed the distinct seasonal variation in vitamin 
A and activator X content of the dairy products, which were, similarly, 
‘in the opposite phase for heart disease and pneumonia. The curves, how￾ever, for the southern hemisphere were in the phase opposite to those of 
the northern hemisphere, but were parallel with the seasons. 
As these data were developed, preliminary reports were made from 
time to time in current scientific journals. These reports are summarized 
in the bibliography. While it is clearly not possible to review the steps of 
progress in detail in this communication, certain essential facts are pre￾sented briefly, with illustrations. I have been deeply indebted to national, 
state and provincial officials, also to individuals in the United States, Can￾ada, Australia and New Zealand, for continuous cooperation extending 
over several years. This assistance has made it possible to develop curves 
showing comparative values from month to month and from year to 
year. 
» Inthe early part of this work, progress was slow in the differentiation 
lof those activating substances that were identified as vitamins and given 
lalphabetical numbers. Little was known of their nutritional. properties. 
‘Tt was early discovered in the history of mineral utilization that one of 
& most striking manifestations was involved in rickets; and since the 
therapeutic use of ergosterol that had been exposed to ultraviolet radia- 
[tion resulted in rapid healing of rickets, being comparable to exposure 
_of the individual to sunlight or suitable artificial radiation, that substance 
| was given the identifying name of vitamin D and was assumed to have 
| the total responsibility for mineral utilization in bone and tooth forma- 
‘tion and maintenance. The substance was given the name of viosterol in 
pm United States. It did not prove efficient, however, in the control of 
dental caries. 
Much progress has been made in recent years in identifying four dif￾ferent vitamin D factors, of which viosterol or irradiated ergosterol 
is vitamin D.° Vitamin D* is produced by the irradiation of a form of 
cholesterol. It is now recognized that activated ergosterol D* does not 
represent the factors essential for the utilization of calcium and phos￾phorus by the human body. Available data indicate that it is not a pro￾duct of animal bodies. We accordingly are concerned with data that will 
relate to mineral metabolism in general and dental caries in particular. 
Pf | \ [have found in these studies that, in the control of dental caries, while a) tA 
442 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
) the consumption of whole butter is an aid in mineral metabolism, greater 
potency may be obtained by melting a high vitamin butter and allowing 
| it to crystallize for twenty-four hours at a temperature of about 70 de￾grees. It is then centrifuged, and, under the process, it separates into an 
| oil that is limpid at that temperature, with a solid crystalline layer below. 
| This oil is much higher in the activating factor than the whole butter.

demonstrated by the roentgen rays and the progress in its healing is 
readily measured by this means. 
Rats are used largely for testing the efficiency of various treatments 
for rickets. The effect of administration of activator X on rickets is 
striking. 
In Figure 136 will be seen the roentgenographic appearance of the fore￾legs and the tails of two rats on the same deficiency diet; namely, Steen￾bock 2965. It will immediately be seen that all of the bones of No. 1 are 
very transparent and the carpal bones have not formed. The junction of

the epiphyses and the diaphyses of the bones, especially of the tail, is 
shown to be characterized by a zone of separation. In rat No. 2, there is 
a marked density of the bones, seen as an area of opacity to the roentgen 
rays, and the carpal bones are well formed. The head of the humerus and 
the epiphyseal zones of provisional growth of the tail are well calcified, 
with only a line of separation between them and the diaphyses. This rat 
received, as an addition to the deficient diet, 2 per cent of the diet as 
a butter-oil concentrate obtained from a high vitamin butter. Clinically, 
this condition constitutes healed rickets. The quantity of this butter used 
would constitute only about one-half ounce for a child eating 2 pounds 
of food per day. This is a very small quantity for a growing child. To the 
right in Figure 136 will be seen the mineral levels in the blood serum of 
these two rats. The calcium for rat No. 1 is at 6.26 mg. per hundred 
cubic centimeters, and in rat No. 2, it is 8.4. The inorganic phosphorus 
in rat No. 1 is at 1.93 mg. per hundred cubic centimeters and in rat No. 
2, it is 2.5 mg. We see at once that this clinical condition in these two 
rats is attended by marked correction of the blood chemical levels. 
The product that was administered to rat No. 2 is a normal constituent 
of a normal milk, Nature’s only complete diet for mammalian infants 
and by far the most important single item of food for growing human 
beings in all periods of stress. 
I shall use as illustration of a case profiting by the use of this dietary 
factor, the case of a boy 4 years of age (Fig. 93, page 270), brought to 
me with a fracture. He was in a cast. Rampant tooth decay was present. 
The diet had consisted of white bread and skimmed milk, which had been 
the source of his nutrition for an extended period owing to the poverty 
of the family at the time of the depression. He had been suffering from 
convulsions, which had been increasing in severity over a period of eight 
months. His leg had been broken when he had fallen to the floor in one 
of his convulsions three months before receiving the reinforced diet. The 
minister who brought him to me had been called to the home to baptize 
the boy for burial because he was considered so near death. 
The only treatment given was a change in diet from skimmed milk 
and white bread to whole milk and a gruel made of freshly ground whole 
wheat. Over this gruel was poured about a desert spoonful of butter oil 
from a sample of butter that had been produced when the cows were 
eating rapidly growing green wheat. After his first meal, the boy slept his 
first night without a convulsion. He was fed five times the next day on 
the same diet, and had no convulsions. Recovery was very rapid. 444 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
Figure 93 shows the broken leg before and after the use of the rein￾forced diet for one month. The x-ray film shows the healed fracture. 
The patient had been taken out of the cast the day before. The x-ray 
film of the broken femur shows clearly the healing of the fracture. The 
photograph is indicative of the excellent physical condition of the child. 
Without operation on his teeth, dental caries was controlled. He grew to 
be an athletic young man, active in sports, particularly baseball. 
During the severe industrial depression, rampant caries developed in 
a great number of cases in the families of mill workers. Children in these 
families provided excellent clinical material. A typical result of work 
done for these families is shown in a study of an experimental group of 
twenty-seven mission children selected on the basis of rampant dental 
caries. At the beginning of the test, in the average chemical analysis of 
all of the saliva specimens of the group, the inorganic phosphorus had 
passed from the powdered bone in an amount of 2.4 per cent of the 
total inorganic phosphorus of the saliva. In two months, this condition 
changed to a movement toward the powdered bone averaging 3.42 per 
cent of inorganic phosphorus for the entire group; in four months, to 
8.13 per cent; in five months, to 11.36 per cent, and in seven months, to 
11.75 per cent. 
Since these children were all from poor homes, many of the families 
being on relief, one extra good meal a day at midday was provided for 
the entire group at the mission. This was preceded by administration to 
each child of one teaspoonful of a mixture containing a high vitamin 
butter oil obtained by centrifuging the butter at 70 degrees from a 
twenty-four hour crystallization of the melted butter. This butter was 
selected on the basis of its high content of activator X. It was mixed with 
equal parts of a high-vitamin, natural cod-liver oil. The clinical effect 
was apparent complete control of dental caries for the entire group, as 
shown in the x-ray films. In many of these cases, the open cavities were 
left without fillings; and, in all such cases, the exposed dentin took on 
a hard glassy finish. There were many other evidences of betterment. 
One of the boys, who was so weak at the beginning of the test that it 
was considered questionable whether it was safe for him to walk the two 
blocks from his home to the mission for the one reinforced meal a day, 
in six weeks was able to play basketball. He was dashing about as a star 
player, and there was no evidence of undue fatigue on his part in this 
strenuous game. 
Under the stress of the industrial depression, the family dietary for —_ 
| 
' 
A NEW VITAMIN-LIKE ACTIVATOR 445 
the children in this mission group was very deficient. During the experi￾ment, the home meals were not changed, nor was the home care of the 
teeth. The preliminary studies of each child included complete x-ray ex￾amination of all the teeth, chemical analyses of the saliva, a careful plot￾ting of the position, size and depth of all cavities, a record of the height 
and weight and a record of school grades, including deportment. It is 
important to note that the home diet which had been responsible for the 
tooth decay, was exceedingly low in body-building and repair material 
and high in sweets and refined starches. It usually consisted of a highly 
eae coffee and white bread, vegetable fat, pancakes made of a 
white flour and eaten with syrup and doughnuts fried in vegetable fat. 
The diet provided these children in the supplemental meal was as fol￾lows: About 4 ounces of tomato juice or orange juice and a teaspoonful 
of a mixture of equal parts of a very high vitamin, natural cod-liver oil 
and an especially high vitamin butter oil was given at the beginning of 
_ the meal. The child then received a bowl containing approximately a pint 
' of a very rich vegetable and meat stew, made largely from bone marrow 
and fine cuts of tender meat. The meat was usually broiled separately to 
retain its juice and then chopped very fine and added to the bone-marrow 
meat soup, which always contained finely chopped vegetables and plenty 
of very yellow carrots. The next course consisted of cooked fruit, with s/, 
very little sweetening, and rolls made from freshly ground whole wheat 
and spread with high vitamin butter. The wheat for the rolls was ground 
fresh every day in a motor-driven coffee mill. Each child was given also 
2 glasses of fresh whole milk. The menu was varied from day to day by 
_ substituting for the meat stew fish chowder or organs of animals. From 
time to time, food similar to that eaten by the children was placed in 
a 2-quart jar and brought to my laboratory, where chemical analysis 
showed that these meals provided approximately 1.48 gm. of calcium 
and 1.28 gm. of phosphorus in a single helping of each course. Since 
many of the children took “seconds,” their intake of these minerals was 
much higher. Since the accepted figures for the requirements of the body 
for calcium and phosphorus are 0.68 gm. of calcium and 1.32 gm. of 
phosphorus, it is obvious that this one meal a day, plus the other two 
meals at home, provided a factor of safety. Clinically, this program com￾pletely controlled the dental caries of each member of the group, as de￾termined by x-ray and explorer examination. 
It is important to note with regard to the effect of the special nu￾tritional program on this group of mission children that two different / v 
eee, 
446 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
\ teachers came to me to inquire as to what had been done to make a par- 
\ticular child change from one of the poorest in the class in capacity to 
\learn to one of the best. Dental caries is only one of the many expres￾sions of our modern deficient nutrition. 
An example of the change produced in the structure of the teeth as 
a result of the reinforced nutrition in this mission group is illustrated in 
Figurge 97, page 289, which shows three first permanent molars in which 
caries apparently had decalcified the dentin to the vicinity of the pulp 
chamber, causing exposure. The pulps were still vital. It will be noted at 
the left, in Figure 97, that each of the three molars apparently had an ex￾posure of the pulp. In the views to the right, a progressive filling in of 
the pulp chambers can be noted from a deposition of secondary dentin, 
making a roof over the pulp and thereby providing a protection which 
enabled the pulp to remain vital and useful for an extended period. This 
is frequently experienced as a result of reinforcing the diet with high￾vitamin and high-activator butter, together with reducing the carbo￾hydrate intake to a normal level as supplied by natural foods and by in￾creasing the foods that provide body-building and tooth-forming min￾erals. The condition that obtains in the tooth is one in which the minerals 
cease to be taken in minute amounts from the tooth structure and, ow￾ing to the change in the saliva, the minerals in ionic form pass from the 
saliva bathing the tooth cavity into the demineralized dentin, in many 
cases a hard and even glassy surface resulting. 
It is important to keep in mind that silver nitrate will not penetrate 
appreciably into tooth enamel after the tooth has been erupted for a year 
or more, in a normal mouth with normal saliva and high immunity to 
dental caries, though it will penetrate an appreciable distance in a re￾cently extracted tooth in the same mouth. This experiment is easily made 
with impacted third molars, in which silver nitrate will often penetrate 
a millimeter into the enamel. 
An excellent illustration of the rescue of a large number of apparently 
doomed teeth in the same mouth is shown in Figure 137. The patient, a 
girl aged 14, had lost all four of the first permanent molars and the diag￾nosis made by her local dentist indicated the necessity of removing all of 
the erupted teeth and the construction of two artificial dentures. Studies 
indicated that she had forty-two open cavities in twenty-four teeth in 
addition to fillings. The patient was placed on a reinforced diet including 
approximately one-half teaspoonful of a mixture of a high vitamin A and high-activator X butter oil mixed with equal parts of a very high- A NEW VITAMIN-LIKE ACTIVATOR 447 
vitamin natural cod-liver oil taken in capsules three times a day. She 
was on this regimen for about seven months, with the result that there 
was very little evidence of extension of the caries, notwithstanding that 
no fillings were placed, with the exception of two or three temporary 
ones. The condition of these teeth before the dietary change is shown in 
the two upper rows of Figure 137. 
Fig. 137.—Case of girl who had forty-two cavities in twenty-four teeth. With the diet 
reinforced with activator X, the pulp chambers built in secondary dentin and all the 
teeth were saved. Full dentures had been recommended. i | N | |

' Because of the extreme severity and extent of the dental operations 
needed, restoration was not undertaken locally, but the patient was sent 
ito Cleveland from a southern state; also for the management and care 
of her case. The operative program was completed by my associate Dr. 
Richard Spayde. The roots of three of the straight-rooted teeth wit 
extensive pulp exposure were filled. Another tooth had had its roots 
filled before the patient came to me. The lower two rows of teeth show 
‘them as restored. 
| This girl, at 15, had all her teeth, with the exception of the four first 
permanent molars, extracted earlier in life. The teeth have been well 
restored with good masticating surfaces and the appearance of the pa￾tient is excellent. She is so enthusiastic that she wishes to give lectures 
on nutrition to aid others with their dental problems. Important light 
is thrown on this case by both the chemical analysis of the saliva and 
the bacterial count. The inorganic phosphorus of the saliva, shaken with 
powdered bone, was changed from +19.1 to —29.5. The bacterial count 
| change for L. acidophilous was from 680,000 to none. 
This form of nutritional control of dental caries is so satisfactory that 
I can recommend it with confidence as adequate to control well over 
95 per cent of dental caries, in the hands of painstaking, efficient and 
informed dentists. 
During the years that these investigations on the nature and source 
of this special activating substance in butter, which I have called acti￾vator X, have been in progress, no reports have been noted from other 
workers of its discovery until the last few years. Then Schantz, 
Elvehjem and Harts reported the comparative nutritive value of butter 
fat and certain vegetable oils. Their data were summarized in Dairy 
Council Digest, March 1940, as follows: 
A series of feeding experiments on rats showed differences in the nutritive value of 
common fats. The rats which received butter fat grew better than the rats fed vege￾table oils, were better in appearance, and had better reproductive capacity. Apparently 
butter fat contains a substance not present in the other fats tested, which is essential for 
the growth and health of young animals. This difference is not due to vitamins A, D, 
or E, but to a difference in the chemical constitution of the fats. These findings are 
significant to the knowledge of nutrition because they indicate additional reasons why 
milk fat has superior value for human diets. 
Hart emphasizes the importance of these findings. He says: 
Milk is indispensable for the best nutrition of children and serves as a concentrated 
protective source of nutritional essentials for all ages. This being true, dairying must 
continue as a part of our agriculture if our standards of living are to be maintained.

Hart and his group later reported additional data under the title 
“Rations for the Study of the Relative Nutritive Value of Fats and Oils.” Science Dec. 3, 1943, which he summarized as follows: “It is apparent 
that lactose has an as yet unknown effect on intestinal conditions which 
is counteracted by butter but not by corn oil.” 
Dec. 1943 he reported further studies in the Journal of Nutrition, 
under the title, “Further Studies on the Comparative Value of Butter 
Fat, Vegetable Oils, and Oleomargarines,”’ which he summarized as fol￾lows: 1. “With lactose as the sole carbohydrate in the diet, rats showed 
superior growth when fed butter fat or lard as compared to corn oil, 
coconut oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, olive oil and hydro￾genated cottonseed oil. 
2. With a mixture of carbohydrates composed of sucrose, starch, dex￾trose, dextrin, and lactose in the diet, the average growth response of the 
animals fed vegetable oils was equal to that of the animals fed butter fat 
and lard. The growth rate on this ration was more rapid than when all of 
the carbohydrates was present as lactose. 
3. Properly fortified oleomargarine fats have growth equal to butter 
fat over a period of 6 weeks when the above mixture of carbohydrates 
was incorporated in the rations. 
4. Properly fortified oleomargarines did not give growth equal to 
butter fat when lactose was the sole carbohydrate in the diet. On such 
a regime rats fed butter fat grew slightly better than rats fed oleomar￾garines of animal origin, but decidedly better than rats fed oleomar￾garines of vegetable origin.” 
Another group of workers using calves as the experimental animals 
has recently reported a similar superiority of butterfat in feeding trials. 
T. W. Gullickson, F. C. Fountaine and J. B. Fitch,’ of the Division of 
Dairy Husbandry, University of Minnesota, used animal and vegetable 
fats with skimmed milk, with the following results: 
Feeding tests were conducted to compare the feeding value of the following fats and 
oils for calves: butterfat, lard, tallow, coconut oil, peanut oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, 
and soybean oil. . . . In average daily gain in weight as well as in general well-being, 
the calves fed butterfat excelled those in all other groups. Following closely were those 
receiving lard and tallow. Corn oil, cottonseed oil and soybean oil were the least satis- 
‘factory. . . . They appeared unthrifty, listless and emaciated. Some calves in these 
iproues died and others were saved only by changing to whole milk. 450 . NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
We are concerned to note the probable relationship between the fac￾tor that has been disclosed by the Wisconsin and Minnesota groups and 
my activator X and vitamin A. Table I shows the relation of activator 
X and vitamin A to butterfat structure as reported by the Wisconsin 
Group, which shows the comparative readings in six spaced samples of 
butter produced by the same cows. This herd was fed in Deaf Smith 
County of northwest Texas near Hereford. The samples were obtained 
about ten days apart, beginning with February and extending through 
to April. In March, the fodder was reinforced with green alfalfa hay.

*Data on six ten-day samples of cream from same herd, near Hereford, Texas, show￾ing marked increase in both nutritional factor reported by Wisconsin group and acti￾vator X factor, strongly indicating that they are the same. 
It will be noted that all of the factors, namely the saponification 
number, iodine number, vitamin A and activator X, progressed through 
a wide range and are in general parallel. The addition of the green pas￾ture also produced a marked change in the color of the butterfat. The 
first two samples of butter, when separated from the cream, were as 
white as lard. A very slight tint was showing in the third sample, which 
increased progressively to a brilliant golden yellow through the next 
three samples. The relation of the changes in these four factors to . 
each other and to the green pasture addition to their fodder is shown 
graphically in Figure 138, which also shows a change in the color of the 
butter as photographed on panchromatic plates. It will be noted that the 
evidence is very striking in that the factor which I have been studying 
and referring to as activator X is possibly the same factor that has re￾cently been observed and reported by both the Wisconsin and the Min￾nesota groups. s A NEW VITAMIN-LIKE ACTIVATOR | 451

It is important that we observe the effect of the administration of 
the activator X factor to patients suffering with rampant dental caries 
on each the incidence of caries, the change in chemical analysis of the 
saliva and L. acidophilous growth. 1 have previously reported that in 
the inorganic phosphorus of the saliva, as determined by an adaptation 
of the Kuttner and Cohen: technic for blood, in which the proteins of 
the saliva are precipitated by sodium acid molybdate and trichloracetic 
_acid, there is a marked change in the behavior of the phosphate ions of 
the saliva when it is shaken with powdered bone or powdered tooth 
substance. In the mouths of susceptible individuals, the inorganic phos￾phorus is increased by transfer of the phosphate ions from the powdered 
bone or tooth chips, whereas, in normal saliva of patients with immun￾ity to dental caries, the movement is from the saliva to the negative ab￾sorbent; namely, powdered bone or tooth chips. This is graphically 
shown in Figure 139 for a group of six typical cases. 452 - NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION

Fig. 139.—Six typical cases in which, under influence of reinforced diet, inorganic 
phosphorus factor changed from average of +-11.5 to —13.9 and L. acidophilous 
count fell from 323,000 to 15,000. 
In this group, the saliva, before the treatment began, gained 11.5 per 
cent in inorganic phosphorus; whereas, after treatment, the saliva lost 
13.9 per cent of its inorganic phosphorus. The change in nutrition in￾cluded an increase in the activator X and vitamin A content as con￾centrated from a high vitamin butter and a reduction in carbohydrates; 
also an increase in mineral-providing foods. Before the change in nu￾trition, when the tooth decay was considered active, L. acidolphilous 
averaged, for the group, 323,000 colonies per cubic centimeter of saliva, 
and, after treatment, averaged 15,000. These data are typical of many 
hundreds of clinical cases in which dental caries has been reduced ap￾parently to zero, as indicated by both x-ray and instrumental ex￾amination. 
We human beings of modern civilzation are at a great disadvantage 
in the selection of foods in that we seem to have lost a sixth sense by 
which we would recognize a specific need for special food. Many of the 
primitive races and most animals retain the capacity to satisfy the body 
needs by choosing the foods that will provide minerals and vitamins. 
This is well illustrated in one of my experiments with chickens. 
Three brooders, each carrying twenty-five chickens, 3 days old, were 
provided with a diet of grain. No opportunity was given the chicks to 
supplement the diet, as chickens in the open or birds in the wild can 
supplement theirs by picking up green food and insects. In order to 
provide an additional source of food, each brooder was supplied with A NEW VITAMIN-LIKE ACTIVATOR 453 
a measured quantity of butter selected on the basis of its vitamin A 
and activator X content.

Fig. 140.—Changes in blood of chicks depending on vitamin A and activator X

both were used and fell to a low level when butter with low vitamin A and activator X

» Brooder No. 1 had a butter that was high in both vitamin A and 
| activator X; brooder No. 2, a butter high in vitamin A and low in 
| activator X, and brooder No. 3, a butter low in vitamin A and activator 
| X. It was observed that the chicks in brooder No. 1 developed much 
\ better than those in either of the two other brooders even though the 
\vitamin A content was high in both brooder No. 1 and brooder No. 2. 
An important part of the experiment was observation of the effect of 
these diets on the chemical content of the blood. On the eighth day, a 
sufficient number of chickens were killed for blood tests to determine 454 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
the level of the product of serum calcium and serum inorganic phos￾phorus. (CaXP) 
A product of 40 is considered normal for most species. At the be￾ginning of the test, this factor stood at 29.7. On the eighth day, for 
| the chickens receiving the butter high in both vitamin A and activa￾tor X, this factor had increased to 31.2; for the chicks in brooder No. 2, 
receiving the butter high in vitamin A and low in activator X, it de￾creased to 28.8, and for those in brooder No. 3, receiving the butter 
low in both vitamin A and activator X, it had fallen to 17.8. On the 
twentieth day, this progressive change was even more marked, being at 
32 for the chicks receiving butter high in both vitamin A and activator 
X and at 25 for those receiving butter high in vitamin A and low in 
activator X. For those receiving butter low in both vitamin A and 
activator X, this product of serum calcium and serum inorganic phos￾phorus had fallen to 13. This result is strikingly illustrated in Figure 140. 
The significance of these data is very great since they throw an im￾portant light on the lowering of the level of defense for many of our 
modern degenerative processes, including dental caries. 
An important observation was made with regard to the behavior 
of the chicks in these three groups, particularly as to the amount of 
| the butter they consumed and the effect on their general health. It was 
noted that the chicks in pen No. 1 ate much more butter than those 
in either pen No. 2 or pen No. 3. This suggested the desirability of mak￾ing an observation of the ability of the chickens to select from three 
samples of food the one that was highest in vitamin A and activator X. 
Accordingly, a new group of forty chickens was started in a large 
brooder. The same deficient diet was used and three containers supplying 
the same three grades of butter were placed in the large brooder, fresh 
each day. The butter was weighed before and after each feeding and 
the containers were shifted to different parts of the brooder so that the 
«same grade of butter was not in the same place twice in succession. This 
was repeated for fifty-seven days, when it was found that the chickens 
selected and ate about two and one-half times as much of the high 
activator X butter as of the low. I could not distinguish between these 
butters, nor could any member of my staff. This clearly indicated an 
ability on the part of the chicks to select the best food. 
An important modification of this chick experiment related to the 
_ capacity of this butter vitamin and activator to maintain life. The 
same three grades of butter were used and the chicks were on McCol- A NEW VITAMIN-LIKE ACTIVATOR 455 
_ lum’s deficiency diet 3142. When 28 per cent of the chicks had died in 
the pen with the low vitamin A and low activator X butter, only 16 
per cent had died in the group receiving butter high in vitamin A and 
low in activator X, and none had died in the pen with the butter high 
in both vitamin A and activator X. When 72 per cent of the chicks were 
dead in group 3, 53 per cent were dead in group 2 and only 24 per cent 
in group 1. 
It has generally been assumed that cod-liver oil is an adequate source 
of the fat-soluble vitamins, but that this is not true for human beings, 
animals or birds is readily illustrated by the following experiment in 
which turkeys were used that were afflicted with weak legs. Three 
groups of turkeys were used. Those in pen No. 1 were controls; those 
in pen No. 2 received cod-liver oil in addition to the stock food on 
_ which they were being fed, and those in pen No. 3 received in addition 
, to foods mentioned butter high in vitamin A and activator X. After a 
\seven-day period, the controls had gained only 8.3 per cent in weight 
j jand those in pen No. 2, on cod-liver oil as an addition to the stock food, 
‘had gained 16.7 per cent; while those in pen No. 3, receiving in addition 
‘the high vitamin A and activator X butter, gained 37.5 per cent in 
weight, more than twice the gain of those in pen No. 2 and more than 
four times that of the controls ih pen No. 1. The difference in their ap￾pearance and condition is shown in Figure 141. We are concerned to 
note the changes in the blood. The calcium and phosphorus increase is 
shown graphically at the right in Figure 141. The calcium increased 2 
mg. in groups 2 and 3, the phosphorus, 1 mg. in group 3. 
Space does not permit a detailed presentation of my experimental 
studies showing the direct relationships among the soil, chemical con￾tent, the plants produced by the soil and the effect of those foods on 
human beings and animals.” 
Interpretation of these data in relation to current thought regarding 
the etiology and control of dental caries requires strong emphasis on the 
need for a broader view than is involved in the interpretation that dental 
caries is purely a local problem in the mouth and soley due to the pres￾ence and activity of aciduric organisms propagated by favorable pabu￾lum supplied in the food and chiefly by sugar. It is also strongly indi￾cated that we must not think of dental caries in terms of oral hygiene, 
as important as that process is.

shown that where isolated and dependent on their native foods, selected 
in accordance with the accumulated wisdom of the racial stock, people 
are relatively free from dental caries. This was true notwithstanding the 
fact that almost no effort was made at oral hygiene. At their point of 
{ contact with the foods of modern civilization, they rapidly lost their 
immunity, in large part because of the high sugar and refined starch 
content, which provided pabulum. However, many other expressions 
of degeneration appeared besides dental caries. The percentages of teeth 
attacked by dental caries in these groups, the more isolated as compared 
with the modernized, are shown in Table 2. CASK O° L762

On the basis of the chemical analysis of the foods, it was disclosed as 
shown in previous chapters that the primitive diets of these various 
groups in various environments all indicated a high content of minerals 
and vitamins, including activator X. I have reported these data in several 
communications.’ 
Table 1 and Figure 138, above, show the chemical characteristics of 
butters produced in Deaf Smith County, Texas. Much publicity has been 
given to the observation that dental caries had a much lower incidence 
in the town of Hereford than in most other districts in the United 
| States. It is of special interest that during the years that I have been 
obtaining butter samples from various parts of the United States and 
| Canada and several other countries, I have been making a special study 
' of the dairy products in the immediate district of northwest Texas and 
eastern New Mexico in the adjoining counties of Curry, New Mexico 
and Deaf Smith County, Texas. On the basis of the samples of butter 
received from these counties and analyzed, during 14 years, when I 
| had butter shipped to Cleveland because of its very high content of acti- 
| vator X and vitamin A to use in my experimental groups of human be- 
‘ings and animals I found its use highly effective in the control of human 
' dental caries, when accompanied by an adequately adjusted food intake. 
During these years, it has been found that the high level of activator X 
‘and-vitamin A was directly associated with the specially favorable , 
| pasturage, chiefly wheat_grass_and other cereal grasses and alfalfa in a 
| lush green state of growth. The cows were pastured on this wheat grass 
| during the fall, winter_and spring until time for the wheat plants to _ 
| stalk. The winter wheat was usually sown in August. 
Ta the immediate districts in which the specially high vitamin butter 
Pic 458 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
was produced by this pasturage, it has now been shown that the butter 
| content is directly related to the soil. Excavations to trace the wheat 
\roots show that they pass down 6 feet or more through 3 feet of top 
soil, varying in depth, into a caliche soil which is very rich in calcium. 
This caliche consists of glacial pebbles cemented together with calcium 
/ carbonate. All of the plants growing on these areas that have this soil 
foundation are particularly rich in minerals and vitamins. 
I have obtained samples of wheat from thirteen districts surrounding 
Hereford for chemical analysis. It is of interest that while these samples 
all show a relatively high level of thiamine, vitamin B’, there is still a 
marked variation which is not related directly to the protein, calcium 
or phosphorus content. 
Farm stock produced in this area has a much higher market value and 
a greater capacity for reproduction than the stock in most states. The 
capacity of most of our states for supporting domestic animals has pro￾gressively decreased until, in many districts, the capacity of the farms 
has gone down to about 50 per cent. When animal life degenerates be￾cause of inadequate food, human beings react similarly. The data dis￾close a physical basis for our modern physical degeneration including 
dental caries. 
Summary 
1. Data have been presented revealing a wide range of nutritive fac￾tors, one of which has not been generally recognized and to which, for 
want of an accepted identification, I have referred as activator X. This 
is found in the food fats of animal origin and is particularly high in 
butterfat when dairy animals are eating lush green pasturage directly 
or rapidly cured and stored for stall feeding. 
2. Data have been presented indicating that this factor, activator X, 
plays an important role in such vital processes as the control of dental 
caries and the healing of fractured bones. 
3. It has been shown that dairy products in Hereford vicinity may 
vary through a range of fiftyfold in a few weeks’ time in the vitamin A 
and activator X content, the range depending directly on the fodder. 
There is a sharp rise at the time that the green pasturage is added to the 
ration of the cows. 
4. This factor, which I have discovered in my investigations of but￾terfats, gives strong evidence of being the same factor that has recently 
been announced by the Dairy Department of the University of Wis￾consin and of the University of Minnesota, which they identify by de- A NEW VITAMIN-LIKE ACTIVATOR 459 
termining the saponification number and iodine number and by animal 
feeding. 
§. The addition of butter high in activator X to the diets of hu￾man beings suffering from tooth decay causes a marked change in the 
chemical constituents of the saliva and the growth of L. acidophilous. 
6. Data have been presented indicating that chickens have the ability 
to recognize and select butters high in activator X and that this prolongs 
their life. 
7. Turkeys are shown to grow much more rapidly when this factor 
is available in their food than when cod-liver oil alone is used, and its 
addition to their diet prevents and cures weak legs. 
8. Clinically, the use of butter high in activator X, in conjunction 
with a favorable selection of natural foods, as shown through a period of 
seventeen years, is highly effective in the control of dental caries. 
9. Primitive races controlled dental caries with diets high in body 
building factors which included activator X.

FOODs(S FABRICATED. SOIL FERTILITY 
BY WILLIAM A. ALBRECHT, 
UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI, COLUMBIA 
INTRODUCTION 
In chapter 20 I have discussed briefly Soil Depletion and Plant and 
Animal Deterioration. Dr. Albrecht has made new and important con￾tributions to this field. He has graciously consented to my presenting 
here a condensed summary which he has provided. This address was 
given before the regional A.A.A. conference at Durham, N. H., June 
1944. In referring to that address Dr. Henry Bailey Stevens, Director 
General Extension Service, University of New Hampshire, made these 
comments; 
“Sometimes a powerful thought, like a flash of lightning, throws a great area from 
darkness into sudden light. Such an illumination was experienced by those of us who 
heard the two addresses by Dr. Wm. A. Albrecht. I confess that I am not sure yet 
how far or along what strange paths this message will take us. Apparently we can no 
longer think of foods as having a fixed value; for such value varies according to the 
soil content. * * * It would seem that nutrition is a much more profound science 
than has been generally recognized and that in studies heretofore its surface has perhaps 
only been scratched.” Extension Bulletin 66. General Extension Service, University of 
New Hampshire, Durham, N. H. 
Dr. Albrecht has published many research reports and is greatly aid￾ing by his contributions, in the large problem of human rehabilitation. 
DRePRICE 
OOD is fabricated soil fertility. It is food that must win the war 
and write the peace. Consequently the questions as to who will 
win the war and how indelibly the peace will be written will be an￾swered by the reserves of soil fertility and the efficiency with which 
they can be mobilized for both the present and the post-conflict eras. 
National consciousness has recently taken consideration of the great 
losses by erosion from the body of the surface soil. We have also come 
to give more than passive attention to malnutrition on a national scale. 
Not yet, however, have we recognized soil fertility as the food￾producing forces within the soil that reveal national and international 
patterns of weakness or strength. Soil fertility, in the last analysis, must 
461 Vv 
aw 
i] 
462 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
not only be mobilized to win the war, but must also be preserved as the 
standing army opposing starvation for the maintenance of peace. 
What is soil fertility? In simplest words it is some dozen chemical 
Seen antl | elements in mineral and rock combinations in the earth’s crust that are 
' being slowly broken out of these and hustled off to the sea. Enjoying a 
temporary rest stop enroute, they are a part of the soil and serve their 
essential roles in nourishing all the different life forms. They are the 
soil’s contribution—from a large mass of nonessentials—to the germinat￾ing seeds that empowers the growing plants to use sunshine energy in 
the synthesis of atmospheric elements and rainfall into the many crops 
for our support. The atmospheric and rainfall elements are carbon, hy￾drogen, oxygen and nitrogen, so common everywhere. 
It is soil fertility that constitutes the five per cent that is plant ash. 
Tt is the handful of dust that makes up the corresponding percentage in 
the human body. Yet it is the controlling force that determines whether 
‘Nature in her fabricating activities shall construct merely the woody 
framework with leaf surfaces catching sunshine and with root surfaces 
absorbing little more than water or whether inside of that woody shell 
there shall be synthesized the innumerable life-sustaining compounds. 
Soil fertility determines whether plants are foods of only fuel and 
fattening values, or of body service in growth and reproduction. Be￾cause the soil comes in for only a small percentage of our bodies, we are 
ect generally aware of the fact that this five per cent can pre-determine 
| ‘the fabrication of the other ninety-five per cent into something more 
‘ than mere fuel. 
History Records Changing Politics Rather than Declining Soil Fertility 
Realization is now dawning that a global war is premised on a_ global 
struggle for soil fertility as food. Historic events in connection with 
the war have been too readily interpreted in terms of armies and poli￾tics and not premised on mobilized soil fertility. Gafsa, merely a city 
in North Africa, was rejuvenated for phosphorus-starved German soils. 
Naura, a little island speck in the Pacific, is a similar nutritional savior 
to the Japanese. Hitler’s move eastward was a hope looking to the Rus￾sian fertility reserves. The hoverings of his battleship, Graf Spee, around 
Montevideo, and his persistance in Argentina were designs on that last 
of the world’s rich store of less exploited soil fertility to be had in the 
form of corn, wheat and beef much more than they were maneuverings 
for political or naval advantage. Some of these historic material events FOOD IS FABRICATED SOIL FERTILITY 463 
serve to remind us that ‘‘an empty stomach knows no laws” and that 
man is in no unreal sense, an animal that becomes a social and political 
being only after he has consumed some of the products of the soil. * * * 
Geographic divisions to give us an East and a West, and a North and 
a South for the eastern half of the country, are commonly interpreted 
as separations according to differences in modes of livelihood, social cus￾toms, or political affiliations. Differences in rainfall and temperature are 
_ readily acknowledged. But that these weather the basic rock to make 
soils so different that they control differences in vegetation, animals, and 
ee 
humans, by control of their nutrition is not so readily granted. That “we 
are as we eat” and that we eat according to the soil fertility, are truths 
that will not so generally and readily be accepted. Acceptances are seem￾ingly to come not by deduction but rather through disaster. 
Patterns of Nourishment are Premised on the Pattern of 
Soil fertility. 
We have been speaking about vegetation by names of crop species and 
by tonnage yields per acre. We have not considered plants for their 
chemical composition and nutritive value according to the fertility in the 
soil producing them. This failure has left us in confusion about crops and 
has put plant varieties into competition with- rather than in support of￾one another. Now that the subject of nutrition is on most every tongue, 
, we are about ready for the report that vegetation as a deliverer of essen￾tial food products of its own synthesis is limited by the soil fertility. 
Proteinaceousness and high mineral contents, as distinct nutritive 
| values, are more common in crops from soil formed in regions of lower 
rainfall and of less leaching as for example the “Midlands” or the mid￾western part of the United States. “Hard” wheat, so-called because of its 
high protein content needed for milling the “‘patent” flour for “light” 
bread, is commonly ascribed to regions of lower annual rainfalls. “Soft” 
wheat is similarly ascribed to the regions of higher rainfalls. The high cal￾cium content the other liberal mineral reserves, and the pronounced 
activities of nitrogen within the less-leached soil, however, are the causes 
when experimental trials suppying the soil with these fertility items in 
high rainfall regions can make hard wheat where soft wheat is common. 
The proteinaceous vegetation and the synthesis by it of many unknowns 
which, like proteins help to remove hidden hungers and encourage 
fecundity of both man and animal are common in the prairie regions 
marked by the moderate rainfalls. It is the soil fertility, rather than the © 
464 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
low precipitation, that gives the Midwest or those areas bordering along 
approximately the 97th meridian these distinctions: (a) its selection by 
the bison in thundering herds on the “buffalo grass”; (b) the wheat 
which taken as a whole rather than as a refined flour is truly the “staff 
of life”; (c) animals on range nourshing themselves so well that they 
reproduce regularly; and (d) the more able-bodied selections for the 
military service of whom seven out of ten are chosen in contrast to 
seven rejected out of ten, in one of the southern states where the soils are 
more exausted of their fertility. 
‘Protein production, whether by plant, animal or man, makes demands 
| on the soil giving elements. Body growth among forms of higher life is 
' a matter of soil fertility and not only one of photosynthesis. It calls for 
more than rainfall, fresh air and sunshine. 
The heavier rainfall and forest vegetation of the Eastern United States 
mark off the soils that have been leached of much fertility. Higher tem￾peratures in the southern areas have made more severe the fertility- 
| reducing effects of the rainfall. Consequently, vegetation there is not 
| such an effective syntheizer of proteins. Neither is it a significant pro- 
| vider of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, or the other soil-given, foetus- 
| building nutrients. Annual production as tonnage per acre is large, par- 
| ticularly in contrast to the sparsity of that on the western prairies. The 
East’s production is highly carbonaceous, however, as the forests, the 
cotton and the sugar cane can testify. The carbonaceous nature as con- 
| tributed by air, water and sunlight more than by the soil. Fuel and fat￾tening values are more prominent than are aids to growth and pro- 
| duction. 
Here is a basic principle that cannot be disregarded. It has signal value 
as we face nutritional problems on a national scale. It is of course, true 
that soil under higher rainfalls and temperatures still supply some fer￾tility for the plant production. Potassium however, dominates that limit￾ed supply to give prominence to photosynthesis of carbonaceous pro￾ducts. The insufficient provision of calcium and of all requisite elements 
usually associated with calcium does not permit the synthesis, by inter￾nal performances of plants, of the proteins and many other compounds 
of equal nutritive value. The national problem is largely one of mobiliz￾ing the calcium and other fertility elements for growing protein and 
not wholly of redistributing proteins under federal controls. The soil fer- FOOD IS FABRICATED SOIL FERTILITY 465 
tility pattern on the map delineates the various areas of particular suc￾cess or particular trouble in nutrition. It marks out the areas where, by 
particular soil treatments, the starving plants can be given relief. 
The Fertility Pattern of Europe is a Mirror 
Pattern of Our Own. 
The more concentrated populations in the United States are in the 
East and on the soils of lower fertility. For these people, Horace Greeley 
spoke good advice when he said “Go West young man”’. It was well that 
they treked to the semi-humid midwest where the hard wheat grows on 
the chernozem soils, and where the bread basket and the meat basket are 
well-laden and carried by the same provider, viz, the soil. It was that 
move that spelled our recent era of prosperity. 
In Europe the situation is similar but the direction of travel was re￾versed and the time period has been longer. It is Western Europe that 
represents the concentrated populations on soils of lower fertility under 
heavier rainfall. Peoples there reached over into the Pioneer United States 
for soil fertility by trading for it the marked “made in Germany”. More 
recently the hard wheat belt on the Russian chernozem soils has been 
the fertility goal under the Hitlerite move eastward. Soil fertility is thus 
the cause of no small import in the world wars. 
Calcium and Phosphorus are Prominent in the soil Fertility 
Pattern as it Determines the Pattern of Nutrition of 
Plants and Animals. 
Life behaviors are more closely linked with soils as the basis of nutri￾tion than is commonly recognized. The depletion of soil calcium through 
leaching and cropping and the almost universal deficiency of soil phos￾phorus, connect readily with animals when bones are the chief body de￾positories for these two elements. In the forest, the annual drop of leaves 
and their decay to pass their nutrient elements through the cycle of 
growth, and decay again, are almost a requisite for tree maintenance. Is 
it any wonder then that dropped antlers and other skeletal forms are 
eaten by the animals to prohibit their accumulation while their calcium 
and phosphorus stay in the animal cycle? Deer in their browse will select 
trees given fertilizers in preference to those untreated. Pine tree seed￾lings along the highway as transplantings from fertilized nursery soils 
are taken by the deer when the same tree species in the adjoining forests 466 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
go untouched. Wild animals truly “know their medicines” when they 
take plants on particular levels of soil fertility. 
The distribution of wild animals, the present pattern or distribution 
of domestic animals, and the concentrations of animal diseases, can be 
visualized as super-impositions on.the soil fertility pattern as it furnishes 
nutrition. We have been prone to believe these patterns of animal be￾haviors wholly according to climate. We have forgotten that the eastern 
forest areas gave the Pilgrims limited game among which a few turkeys 
were sufficient to establish a national tradition of Thanksgiving. It was 
on the fertile praries of the Midwest, however, that the bison were so 
numerous that only their pelts were commonly taken. 
Distribution of domestic animals today reveals a similar pattern, but 
more freedom from “‘disease”- more properly freedom from malnutri￾tion- and by greater regularity and fecundity in reproduction. It is on 
the lime-rich, unleached, semi-humid soils that animals reproduce well. 
It is there that the concentrations of disease are lower and some diseases 
are rare. There beef cattle are multiplied and grown to be shipped to the 
humid soils where they are fattened. Similar cattle shipments from one 
fertility level to another are common in Argentina. 
In going from midwestern United States eastwerd to the less fertile 
soil, we find that animal troubles increase and become a serious handicap 
to meat and milk production. The condition is no less serious as one goes 
south or south-eastwerd. The distribution patterns of milk fever, of 
acetonemia, and of other reproductive troubles, that so greatly damage 
the domestic animal industry, suggest themselevs as closly connected 
with the soil fertility pattern that locates the proteinceous, mineral-rich 
forages of higher feeding value in the prairie areas but leaves the more 
carbonaceous and more deficient foods for the East and Southeast with 
their forest areas. Troubles in the milk sheds of eastern and southern 
cities are more of a challenge for the agronomists and soil scientists than 
for veterinians. 
Experiments using soil treatments have demonstrated the important 
roles that calcium and phosphorus can play in the animal physiology and 
reproduction by way of the forages and grains from treated soils. Ap￾plied on adjoining plots of the same area, their effects were registered in 
sheep as differences in animal growth per unit of feed consumed, and as 
differences in the quality of the wool. Rabbits also grew more. rapidly 
and more efficiently on hay grown where limestone and superpfosphate 
had been used together than where phosphate alone had been supplied. FOOD IS FABRICATED SOIL FERTILITY 467 
The influence of added fertilizers registers itself pronouncedly in the 
entire physiology of the animal. This fact was indicated not only by dif￾ferences in the weight and quality of the wool, but in the bones and more 
pronouncedly in the semen production and reproduction in general. 
Rabbit bones varied widely in breaking strength, density, thickness, 
hardness and other qualities beside mass and volume. Male rabbits used 
for artificial insemination became sterile after a few weeks on lespedeza 
hay grown without soil treatment, while those eating hay from limed 
rock remained: fertile. That the psysiology of the animal, seemingly so 
far removed from the slight change in chemical condition in the soil, re￾gistered the soil treatment, is shown by the resulting interchange of the 
sterility and fertility of the lots with the interchange of the hays during 
the second feeding period. This factor of animal fertility alone is an 
economic liability on less fertile soil, but is a great economic asset on the 
soils that are more fertile either naturally or made so by soil treatments. 
Animal Instincts are Helpful in Meeting Their Nutritional Needs 
Instincts for wise choice of food are still retained by the animals in 
spite of our attempts to convert the cow into a chemical engineering 
establishment wherein her ration is as simple as urea and phosphoric 
}acid mixed with carbohydrates and proteins,, however crude. Milk, 
{ which is the universal food with high efficiency because of its role in re- 
‘production, cannot as yet be reduced to the simplicity of chemical en￾gineering when calves become affected with rickets in spite of ample 
sunshine and plenty of milk, on certain soil types of distinctly low fer￾tility. Rickets as a malnutrition “disease” according to the soil type, need 
not be a new concept, so far as this trouble affects calves. 
/ | Even if we try to push the cow into the lower levels in the biotic 
| pyramid, or even down to that of plants and microbes that alone can 
‘live on chemical ions, not requisite as compounds, she still clings to her 
‘instincts of selecting particular grasses in mixed pasture herbages. For￾tunately, in her physiology she strikes up partnership with the microbes 
‘in her paunch where they synthesize some seven essential vitamins for 
her. We are about to forget, however, that these paunch-dwellers cannot 
be refused in their demands for soil fertility by which they can meet this 
expectation. England’s allegiance in war time to cows as ruminants that 
/carry on these symbiotic vitamin synthesis, and her reduction of the 
| population of pigs and poultry that cannot do so, bring the matter of 
‘soils more directly into efficient service for national nutrition than we 
| have been prone to believe.

468 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
The instincts of animals are compelling us to recognize soil differences. 
Not only do dumb beasts select herbages according as they are more 
carbonaceous or proteinaceous, but they select from the same kind of 
grain the offerings according to the different fertilizers with which the 
soil was treated. Animal troubles engendered by the use of feeds in mix￾tures only stand out in decided contrast. Hogs select different corn grains 
from seperate feeder compartments with disregard of different hybirds 
but with particular and consistent choice of soil treatments. Rats have 
indicated discrimination by cutting into the bags of corn that were 
chosen by the hogs and left uncut those bags not taken by the hogs. 
Surely the animal appetite, that calls the soil fertility so correctly, can be 
of service in guiding animal production more wisely by means of soil 
treatments. 
/ Dr. Curt Richer of the Johns Hopkins Hospital has pointed to a 
_ physiological basis for such fine distinction by rats, as an example. De￾prived of insulin delivery within their system, they ceased to take sugar. 
_ But dosed with insulin they increased consumption of sugar in propor￾tion to the insulin given. Fat was refused in the diet similarly inaccord- 
_ ance with the incapacity of the body to digest it. Animal instincts are 
| inviting our attention back to the soil just as differences in animal 
| physiology are giving a national pattern of differences in crop produc￾tion, animal production, and nutritional troubles too easily labeled as 
“disease” and thus accepted as inevitable when they ought to have rem- 
| edy by attention to the soil. The soils determine how well we fill the 
bread basket and the meat basket. 
Patterns of Population Distribution Are Related to the Soil. 
The soil takes on national significance when it prompts the Mayor of 
| the eastern metropolis to visit the “Gateway to the West” to meet the 
| farmers dealing with their production problems. More experience in 
_ rationing should make the simple and homely subject of soils and their 
| productive capacity household words amongst urban as well as rural 
| peoples. Patterns of the distribution of human beings and their diseases, 
that can be evaluated nationally on a statistical basis as readily as crops of 
wheat or livestock, are not yet seen in terms of the soil fertility that 
determines one about as much as the other. Man’s nomadic nature has 
made him too cosmopolitan for his physique, health, facial features, and 
mental attitudes to label him as of the particular soil that nourished him. 
His collection of foods from far-flung sources also handicaps our ready FOOD IS FABRICATED SOIL FERTILITY 469 
correlation of his level of nutrition with the fertility of the soil. We have 
finally come to the belief that food processing and refinement are deny￾ing us some essentials. We have not yet, however, come to appreciate the 
role that soil fertility plays in determining the nutritive quality of foods, 
and thereby our bodies and minds. Quantity rather than quality is still 
the measure. 
Now that we are thinking about putting blanket plans as an order 
over states, countries and possibly the world as a whole, there is need to 
consider whether such can blot out the econimics, customs and institut￾ions that have established themselves in relation to the particular soil’s 
fertility. Since any civilization rests or is premised on its resources rather 
than on its institutions, changes in the institution cannot be made in 
disregard of so basic a resource as the soil. 
National Optimism Arises Through Attention to Soil Fertility. 
Researches in soil science, plant physiology, ecology, human nutrition 
and other sciences have given but a few years of their efforts to human 
welfare. These contributions have looked to hastened consumption sur￾pluses from unhindered production for limited territorial use. Research￾ers are now to be applied to production, and a production that calls for 
use of nature’s synthesizing forces for food production more than to 
simple non-food conversions. When our expanded chemical industry 
is permitted to turn from war-time to peace-time pursuits, it is to be 
hoped that a national consciousness of declining soil can enlist our scien￾ces and industry into rebuilding and conserving our soils as the surest 
guarantee of the future health and strength of the nation. Chapter 24 
FLUORINE IN PLANT AND ANIMAL GROWTH 
HE recent interest in the use of Fluorine as an aid in the control 
of dental caries, has emphasized the need for recording some related 
data. 
The presence of Fluorine in the igneous rocks of the earth’s surface, 
in an amount about equal to that of phosphorus, namely, one part per 
one thousand, has made it quite universally available for plant and ani￾mal growth. Its extreme toxicity, even in great dilution, has been pre￾vented from doing harm by its very low solubility in water, namely, 
thirty-seven parts per million,for CaF. Even a small fraction of this con￾centration, when present in the drinking water, greatly disturbs normal 
tooth and bone development, producing the unsightly disfigurement of 
brown stain and mottled enamel. This curses the people living in the 
districts having an affected water supply. It may ruin the teeth of graz￾ing animals, by making them so brittle that they break off. Camels, 
sheep, cows, goats, donkeys and horses are seriously affected in a North 
Africa district, thus making them unable to pasture. 
This increase in Fluorine concentration occurs in water-pools by 
evaporation and in some artesian water supplies, where the drainage is 
from distant table lands. These dental defects are caused systemically 
when the teeth are being formed. Fluorine slightly increases the density 
or hardness of developed teeth, even in a test-tube. This includes slight 
resistance to acids, including those due to carbohydrate fermentation. 
This is the basis for the hope in its reducing the effects of bacterial acids, 
produced in tooth decay. 
Bibby, Journal American Dental Association, March 1, 1944. Subject, 
Fluorine in Prevention of Caries, reports regarding the experimental 
efficiency of Fluorine treatment as follows: 
Summary; Experiments on eighty children over a period of two years 
showed that six topical applications of a one to one thousand sodium 
fluoride solution, reduced dental caries by somewhat more than one third 
as compared with results in the corresponding untreated quadrants in 
the same mouth. 
470 FLUORINE IN PLANT AND ANIMAL GROWTH 471 
Regarding the theory of acid resistance and methods of treatment, 
Atkins states, in Journal American Dental Association, March 1, 1944: 
For lack of a more descriptive word it is explained that the teeth are 
given an invisible coating of Fluorine in a similar manner as silver nitrate 
is deposited. 
He emphasises the great care that is needed in applying it because of 
its extreme toxicity as follows; 
Because it is one the violently poisonous elements, Fluorine requires 
careful handling. In the preparation of solutions one must keep well 
within the bounds of saftey. The highest suggested content here is similar 
to that of several water supplies, furnished for general consumption. 
Neither the drug itself, nor the formula, has been given to others than 
those qualified to handle it. Adding it to the food or water for general 
use is beyond the practice of dentistry. 
In my studies of primitive races in many parts of the world and in 
many stages of loss of immunity to dental caries, many groups had not 
changed their location or made changes in their local environment. The 
water supply, whether from a mountain stream or a well, had remained 
the same. Ships had made contact with the island, often to carry away 
local products, chiefly copra, dried cocoanut meat. The payment was 
made chiefly in three articles of commerce, refined flour, concentrated 
sweetened fruit jams and highly colored calicos, but no currency. I asked 
the manager of one of these inter island navigation companies, regarding 
the proportions. He said ninety percent must be in flour and jams and 
not over ten percent in cotton goods. The reduction on fluorine intake, if 
any, was limited to the lowered use of sea foods and land plants. As I 
have shown in previous chapters, the increase in dental caries averaged 
about thirty fold. 
The great mass of research data, developed during the past fifty years 
with the mechanisms involved in dental caries, has emphasized the 
solubility action of acids produced by the breakdown of carbohydrates 
by bacteria, chiefly those of the acidohpilis group. Two controling fac￾tors have been recognized, the type and quantity of carbohydrate present 
and the presence or absence of depressments to bacterial growth. The 
emphasis is placed on control of these two factors. Programs involving 
the use of fluorine, because of its depressing action on carbohydrate 
acidity development, should include control of the carbohydrate factor. 
It is very important that in the consideration of the dental caries prob￾lem it shall be kept in mind continually, that it is only one of a large 472 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
group of symptoms of modern physical degeneration and when teeth are 
decaying other things are going wrong in the body. Fluorine treatment, 
like dental extractions, cannot be a panacea for dental caries. 
Evidence of a Need for Fluorine in Optimun Amounts for Plant and 
Animal Growth and Bone and Tooth Development, with Thresholds 
For Injury. 
One of the major problems of dental research for the past three 
decades has involved phases of hypoplasia of different types. In 1913 the 
author published an illustrated report presenting an extended series of 
structural tooth defects, which seemed traceable directly to particular 
types of baby food. Black and McKay, in 1916, presented data relating 
to an endemic deformity of tooth structure chiefly expressed as ““mott￾ling” and “stain” which has come to be known as the “brown-stain 
mottled-enamel lesion.” McKay’s work through the succeeding years 
has emphasized the relation of this lesion to the water supply. Paleopath￾ology, and medical and dental annals have been recording the existence 
of this disease. The recent studies of Churchill, Smith, and others have 
emphasized the probable relationship of this lesion to excess of F in the 
water. The widespread distribution of this lesion throughout large areas 
of many countries has emphasized the seriousness of the defect and the 
probability that the causative factors will be found in soil conditions. 
The present studies have been carried forward to ascertain the method 
by which F acts when injourious effects are produced. The author’s 
studies of blood chemical-changes, as associated with disturbances in 
mineral metabolism, have emphasized the sensitiveness of the human 
mechanism not only to shortage of essential minerals and vitamins, but 
also to toxic quantities of certain metallic and non-metallic substances. 
These have suggested the need for information on the influence on min￾eral metabolism, and on growth for both plants and animals. 
Much of the F of the earth’s crust occurs in apatite and other Ca-P 
compounds, being frequently associated with Ca and P. Since approxim￾ately one part in a thousand of the earth’s crust is P and approximately 
an equal amount is F, there is no scarcity of either element in the igneous 
rocks from which soils were developed. There is about thirty times as 
much Ca as either F or P in the earth’s crust. The problem of the chem￾ical form and solubility of F, as compared with other elements, has much 
to do with its concentration and availability for serious effects. The various phosphate rocks that are used as fertilizers—primarily calcium FLUORINE IN PLANT AND ANIMAL GROWTH 473 
phosphate—contain from 0.69 to 4.23 percent of F, which is about one￾tenth the P content. The ratio of F to P:Os, as reported by Marshall 
Jacob, and Reynolds in an extended series of determinations, ranged 
from 0.06 to 1.32 for continental rocks; from 0.0178 to 0.085 for island 
deposits. The solubility of F is accordingly an important factor in deter￾mining the amount available in various waters and soils. Since igneous 
rocks are about equally rich in P and F, our problem clearly is not one of 
limited distribution of F, CaF, or fluorite, a common mineral, occurs in 
abundance in many districts, and is soluble to 37 parts per million of 
water. Other F salts, such as NaF, and sodium silico-fluoride (Na:SiFs) 
are also soluble—the former, 400 parts per ten thousand; the latter, 65 
parts per ten thousand. F presumably has constantly been a factor in the 
environment of plant and animal life. Since living forms are the product 
of their environment, F has presumably had a part in vital phenomena. 
Its low solubility in the forms in which it occurs in igneous rocks sug￾gests that it has not been present in high concentration in surface waters. 
These studies have accordingly been made to determine the effect of F on 
plant and animal growth; and on the levels at which it becomes toxic in 
the water bathing the plant roots, and when ingested by animals in water 
and food. Various types of plants have been grown in different nutrient 
fluids in which the concentration of F was varied up to 25 mg. per liter. 
F as NaF, added in progresive amounts to sprouting corn—when the 
plant is utilizing only the stored minerals of the kernel, while growing 
in distilled water—had a progressive stimulating effect up to 10 parts per 
million of the water; 20 parts, or more, were very toxic and produced 
only stunted growth with a bronzed appearance. When, however, Ca 
and P were added to the fluid, the toxic effect was very greatly reduced. 
The maximum concentration (37 parts per million) of CaF» (the com￾mon mineral fluorite) would, if present, prevent this cereal from sprout￾ing; and if it occured in irrigation waters, would markedly depress plant 
growth. Surface drainage cannot readily become saturated. Water stored 
in soil and rocks as artesian water can more nearly do so, and has fre￾quently been found to blight plant growth. 
Studies have also been made of the effect on mineral metabolism when 
F is ingested by rats. In general several chemicals were depressed. The 
total iron of the blood of a control rat was at 50 mg. per 100cc. (The 
succeeding numerical data for rat blood indicate mg. per 100cc., when 
not given as percent.) When F was added as NaF (1 per cent of the 
food), the iron content of the blood was 42.5mg. The cell-Ca of the 474 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
blood was reducedfrom 41.7 to 35. The inorganic P of the serum was 
reduced from 6.67 to 5.26; of the serum of 100 cc. of whole blood, from 
3.89 to 3.42; in 100cc. of blood cells, from 0.67 to 0.22; in the cells from 
from 100 cc. of whole blood, from 0.28 to 0.88. The cell inorganic -P 
percent of the total-blood inorganic-P was reduced from 6.7 to 2.3. The 
inorganic P of whole blood, was reduced from 4.17 to 3.50; the Ca of 
whole blood, from 9.35 to 7.80. the Mg of blood rose from 2.63 to 3.50. 
The K of whole blood was reduced from 322 to 267. These data indicate 
that 1 percent of NaF (diet) caused general disturbance of mineral me￾tabolism. They also suggest that ingestion of F, in amounts above the 
threshold of tolerance of the tissues, may be very depressing, and may 
meterially influence mineral deposition in bones and teeth. Since, how￾ever, the teeth differ from the bones, in that a complete rebuilding pro￾cess is not possible for the teeth through subsequent months and years, 
growth defects of the enamel would be permanent. 
Field studies gave important data on waters and soils from many dis￾tricts, including one in Northern Africa where the teeth of humans, and 
also those of camels, sheep, cows, goats, donkeys, and horses, are seriously 
affected. The waters from this district contain from 23 to 31 parts of F 
per ten million, determined by the Jacob and Reynolds method. The 
rocks from this district contained 5.38 percent of F, or 53,800 parts per 
million. This is the highest figure in our series, and higher than any found 
in the literature. Another series is related to the skeletal breakdown of a 
group of cattle on a western farm in eastern New Mexico, where both the 
water and soil contain excessive amounts of F. The blood of afflicted 
animals showed very marked depression of mineral constituents. Chapter 25 
HOW MOTHER NATURE MADE US 
Y STUDIES of fourteen primitive races in various stages of being 
modernized, together with our newer knowledge of the role of 
nutrition in human and animal behavior, help us to visualize what is 
taking place in our modern society. 
It is most significant that where many primitive racial stocks have suc￾ceeded superbly, our modernized civilizations are failing dismally. The 
primitives have retained excellent bodies through many generations, 
while many moderns wreck theirs early with degenerative diseases. 
The explanation as disclosed by the primitives is chiefly in our defeat￾ing some fundamental processes of life. We disregard our own physical 
needs as they are disclosed by our developmental origins. We have used 
our scientific knowledge largely to change nature’s foods and thereby 
have defeated nature’s laws of growth and health. The primitives co-

In the second stage shown in line 2 the similarity is retained in all 
except the Salamander and Fish. It is only in line 3 that the differentia￾tion is complete in all eight groups. All of these forms of life have a 
similar origin, though clearly this does not demonstrate that man has 
sprung directly from some ancestral ape, but that both have developed 
from a common progenitor that lacked their several peculiarities. 
| Much of modern thinking and teaching has failed to recognize as 
| common the origin of man with many animal forms and its significance 
| for understanding his form and behaviour. Since much of man’s expres- 
| sions, physically and mentally, are related to his automatic behaviour, 
| growing out of his heredity, we see at once the urgent need for a better 
understanding of him in this aspect, since these controls are the origin 
| of his instincts or inherited behaviour. For all the simpler forms of life, 
| behaviour i is automatically controlled by the individual’s reactions to the 
‘environment, Needham reminds us that many of the lower animals are. 
born educated almost to the full extent of their capacity, the possible 
"lines of action of their whole lives being provided for or being predeter￾mined in their organization. The acts most fundamental to the preserva- 
' tion of races, feeding and reproduction, are thus cared for in the main in 
all animals and in ourselves. This is very important in connection with 
| our modern tendencies, including human behaviour. 
We are familiar with the normal behaviour of domestic animals and 
| birds. For example, a kitten’s first response to a dog is to arch its back and 
| spit while bushing its tail and extending its claws. The dog’s first response 
is to halt and back up. We call this instinct. It is wisdom at birth without 
_ being taught. Chickens run for shelter, young ones go to the mother at 
the cry of a hawk, which the mother hen recognizes and responds with 
her cry of danger. Needham defines instinct as inherited behaviour. He 
says it is that part of behaviour with respect to which animals are born 
fully educated. It is automatic and instantaneous in action. It is common 
to all members of a species. In matters of vital importance all tend to act 
alike. It is by instinct the animals, birds and insects build their homes, 
often of great complexity, without having been taught by example. They 
are instinctive acts, unconsciously performed, being automatic yet made 
with the full knowledge of the individual. 
~ Pavlov describes instinct as a complex of reflexes. Instinct is knowledge 
at birth or as soon after as needed. By instinct the kitten knows the dog 
is its enemy; it is on guard and active even when the individual is not 
conscious, as in sleep, in which state some animals have violent reactions 478 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
from odors; for example, sex urge. Humans all start and finish life domi-_ 
nated by these unconsious reactions. ‘ 
Unlike the simpler forms of life man and the higher forms super￾impose wilful behavior in accordance with the dominance of the will and 
its store of intelligence, which is variable, together with his release from 
the domination of his impulsive instructor or rather his instructive im￾pulses. 
Instructive impulses change radically with internal development and 
environment. This is strikingly illustrated in many of the simpler ani￾mals and insect forms, as shown in figure 143, of the tent caterpillar. 
It has four distinct life stages, viz., as an egg, larva, pupa and moth. 
Its behavior for all these stages is controlled at the time of the fertiliza￾tion of the original ovum to produce the egg. The delicacy and power of 
the mechanism not only persists through these physical transitions, but 
go forward to motivate similarly all future generations. 
The eggs are laid on a tiny twig in July by a small moth, but do not 
hatch until the following April or May. They must withstand freezing, 
blizzards of winter and dehydrating sun and wind. The eggs are attached 
to end tips of live cherry limbs, and for some varities only cherry will do. 
Two views of an egg cluster are shown at a and b, fig. 143. The hatching 
time of the eggs is adapted to the appearance of green leaves on which the 
minute caterpillars feed in warm sunshine, and at evening proceed down 
the twig to the first crotch, laying a web as they go to build their in￾genious tent home; see d, figure 143. The brood from this one group of 
eggs includes many hundreds. They are laid in pyramid shape, and have 
a color that matches the cherry branch. When the caterpillars are fully 
grown, see C figure 143, they crawl down the trunk of the tree and find 
a shelter in which they live alone and spin about themselves a silken 
cocoon; see e figure 2. This silken coat is covered by a white creamy fluid 
secreted to fill the meshes of the cocoon. Within this cocoon the cater￾pillar changes its form to a pupa (chrysalis) with wings, long legs, an￾tennas and various structures of the moth, male and female; see f and g, 
figure 143. This takes about two weeks time. It now can fly, which it does 
at night after hiding during the day; it no longer has hunger or a diges￾tive system. The controlling impulse is now only sex urge, and it goes 
forth at night to find a mate that is out on this same mission, which is its only mission in life and for which alone its former stages were pro￾vided. The male, too, now cannot eat; after mating he is through with 
life. His contribution, the spermatozoa, however, lives on through con- HOW MOTHER NATURE MADE US 479

tinuing generations as a well-nigh eternal force; they are potentially im￾mortal. The female moth proceeds forthwith to find another cherry tree 
and plants her fertilized eggs on a twig in systematic order all on end, 
closely packed and protected by a waterproof covering about the color 
of the twig. Then her mission in life is fulfilled, her sex-cell caterpillar 
history and the specifications for future generations are, like the male’s, 
practically immortal. 
What is the source of all this energy and can it carry on through 
countless generations? The only renewal source of energy is the food 
selected and utilized in only one of its four forms of organized proto￾plasm, viz., when a caterpillar. That food was required to make it grow 
to maturity. This involved many score of chemical substances, adequate 
‘to build, each, a nervous system, eyes, silk factory and spinning tools, 
‘embryonic sex cells, male and female antennas, wings, cocoon parts, 
‘moths, etc. These chemicals were all synthesized from the minerals, acids, 
_ bases, hormones and vitamins furnished by the rapidly growing green 
cherry leaves, plus sunshine and atmosphere. These include several min- 
,erals from the soil. Clearly this could only occur where mother nature’s 
| laws were obeyed at every step. Suppose the caterpillar had learned to rob 
‘ the plant juice of its carotine, then the vitamin A could not form and 
no eyes could be made or many of the other structures; or if only starches 
and sugars were eaten, no body could be built or capacity to reproduce 
and continue the race. Its safety is provided in both its ignorance and the 
rigidity of Mother Nature’s laws. 
While many other cycles may seem more simple than that of this 
animal they are all controlled by vital forces that we do not yet under￾stand. We are in fact quite as helpless in our dependence on nature’s 
sources and essentials for life as are the insects, animels and birds. All are 
dependent on land and sea foods, since we cannot create the elements and 
we can only get them by way of our foods. Ultimately they must come 
, from the sources of all foods, the soil and the sea. 
We humans have the same rigid restrictions regarding food selection 
as the simpler forms of life when foods are evaluated from their chemical 
basis. Our greater complicity however, introduces new behavior patterns 
due to injuries to the structure and therefore the functions of the fore￾brain. All primitive races that have lived on for long periods have done 
so by obeying Nature’s rigid laws. 
) The insects, birds and animals are provided with a key to direct them 
| to the foods most helpful, namely their instinct; modern man has largely 
\ lost this guide, tho while young he retains a large measure of it. HOW MOTHER NATURE MADE US 481 
It is important to note regarding instincts that they develop and dis￾appear with d different stages of development and growth. Children and 
adults are afraid of snakes but infants are not. With the change i in a boy’s 
voice his manners with girls change. In adolescence there is a radical 
change in the sex urge in which action is automatic in balance with the 
inhibitions, which in most animals are physiological but in man are pri￾marily mental being provided by education. 
The animal or human body is an incubator, nothing can take the place 
of the germ cells, or change their functions, there is no other starting 
material for a new generation. Needham’s ‘. ABOUT OURSELVES” ex￾plains this clearly as follows: 
Early in the development of the body from the egg there occurs 
a differentiation of the growing cell mass into two parts that Weis￾mann properly emphasized as “germ plasm” and “body plasm.” 
The germ plasm is a group of cells that will remain unspecialized, 
that will be segregated within the developing body, and that on the 
approach of the maturity of that body will produce new germ cells 
for another generation. They take not part in the labors of the body. 
They serve no other function than that of reproduction; but they 
alone leave descendants in future generations. They at are e thus -poten￾tially immortal. 
Many of the lower animals are born educated almost to the full 
extent of their capacity, the possible lines of action of their whole_ 
lives being provided for or predetermined in their organization. The 
acts most fundamental to the preservation of the races, feeding and 
reproduction are thus cared for in the main in all animals and in 
ourselves. So also are avoidance reactions that protect from deadly 
perils. A chicken flees at the first cry of a hawk although it may be 
quite unresponsive to the (to us) similar cry of a cat bird. Nature 
has developed this nice discrimination by the elimination of those 
individuals that do not act properly and with effective promptness. 
Racial experience has thus been incorporated into the organism in 
such manner that vitally important stimuli dominate all the activi￾ties of the body and enable it to meet the chief exigencies of life. 
, There is however, especially in the higher animals, a field of activity 
| in which the reactions are less fixed, and here lies the opportunity 
| for learning by individual experience. This is so large a part of our 
| own life that we have difficulty in realizing how limited it is in 
| many of the lower animals. 482 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
These data throw important light on our modern world problems, not￾withstanding our declining food resources through loss of fertility, which 
Needham emphasizes. 
Since the units of populations are persons, it is obvious that the basic 
need is for soundness in body and mind in those persons. There are 
two sets of factors entering into the making of each person; in￾herent tendencies and environmental influences; and there are like￾wise two schools of opinion as to means of social betterment. The 
programs that they offer bear high-sounding Greek names: 
1. Eugenics, looking to nature, to better breeding heredity. 
2. Euthenics, looking to nurture, to better environment. 
Behind all this crowding is the nature of man, with the irresistible 
sex urge. Abetting this urge is the demand of war-lords for larger 
families—more men to man the guns—more men for fodder. There 
also remains the primitive feeling that the nation is strongest that 
has the largest population. Obviously this is no longer true. 
Nature’s inexorable limit is set by the food supply. Mankind must 
eat to live. Every advance in food production is quickly overtaken 
by increase in population. Generally the optimum is soon overpassed 
with men as with caterpillars, and starvation sets in to reduce the 
excess. 
Modern man’s mental inhibitions are not strong enough to protect him, 
as Needham shows. 
Studies in widely scattered areas in the United States show that the 
birthrate among families who have been on relief (Sustained by 
public funds: 1936) for more than a year is about 60% higher 
than among families of similar social status who are not on relief. 
—James S. K. Bossard, in Birth Control and Continuing the De￾pression. 
The normal and proper exercise of the primal altruistic racial in￾stincts is the chief basis of human happiness. The consuming joy 
that lovers find in each other’s company, the captivation of a baby’s 
smile—of one’s own baby’s smile, the sense of belonging within the 
family circle; these are far older than church or state or any other 
artificial products of the social order. They are the product of a 
natural evolution. They are the greatest of God’s gifts to human 
kind. 
It was at this point that several of the primitive racial stocks have dis- played superior wisdom, which has enabled them to live on through HOW MOTHER NATURE MADE US 483 
many centuries even in difficult physical environments. For example the 
Australian Aborigines controlled the population by limiting the size of 
families, while permitting each woman to have one or two children but 
only the restricted number that the territory of that clan could support. 
The evidence provided by these studies among the primitives throws 
an important new light on the confusion regarding which is responsible 
for modern character disturbances and various mental variations. The 
general assumption is that it is faulty environment that provides abnor￾mal personalities, since only two causes are considered possible, namely, 
heredity or environment. In other words, is it the result of nature or 
nurture? It has not been considered that a third cause may be respons￾ible, namely, intercepted heredity. In the light of these new data our 
mentally backward and delinquent individuals may be injured and are 
really abnormal because of this type of injury resulting from parental 
nutritional germ cell defect. The opposite phase of this, namely, exalted 
mentality may represent normality. For example, a much larger propor￾tion of Rhodes’ scholars than normal are the oldest boy in the family and 
in general come from districts providing good nutrition. Similarly, data

BIRTH DISTRIBUTION Fig. 144 
Concentration per million population of American scientists with respect to state of 
birth. Climate, education and economic opportunities differ so greatly throughout the 
country that these differences cannot be attributed mainly to genetic differences. 484 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
now available illustrate this regarding the leading men of science. Dr. 
Richard Ashman of Louisiana State University reports in the April 1945 
issue of “The Journal of Heredity” a study of the state of birth of 
American men of science. The map showing this is reproduced as figure 
144. ; 
He closes his interpretation of these finds as follows: Since many 
dysgenic factors are operating in the United States today, it is pertinent 
to inquire whether our civilization can long endure. For its perpetuation 
many things are, of course, necessary, including education. But how long 
shall we have a sufficient supply of educable material? No amount of 
social and economic reform, however desirable and necessary these may 
be, can prevail against a downward genetic trend, even though moderate. 
Civilization in the region or nation which reverses this trend may soon 
surpass that of the rest of the world. 
While his interpretation seems to place the emphasis on genetics it is 
significant that the states showing the highest population of scientists are 
those covering the areas that my studies indicate have produced a very 
high level of body-building foods. It is also significant that Dr. Albrecht 
has presented data indicating that this district was the one selected by 
the buffalo herds because of superb pasture, in his discussion of the rela￾tion of soils to food qualities. 
The relation of brain function to soil fertility is demonstrated in many 
sources of information. These include a percentage of grade school pupils 
in classes for mentally retarded and backward children. I have found the 
| proportion in several districts to be above thirty percent, and progres- 
_ sively increasing in several states. In the group of southern states using © 
the same examination, passing from grade schools to high schools, the 
data show a marked superiority in the proportion of children for the 
Panhandle area. That area is underlain with caliche subsoil which consists 
of calcium pebbles cemented together with calcium carbonate. 
In Chapter 22 I have shown that the milk and cream produced from 
wheat pasture in that area are very high in Vitamin A and Activator X. 
Many of the children are excellent. The average well above normal. 
The roots of the wheat plants in this district have been shown to pene￾trate down six feet, well into the subsoil. The district includes Hereford 
which has been highly publicized for its low incidence of dental caries. 
The cattle raised in that area are very superior, both for beef and for 
reproduction. The people can be also if they are as wise as the buffalo 
and cattle in the selection of their food. \

STEPS IN OUR MODERN DEGENERATION 
| C) x degenerations like our growths being an unconscious process 
will be recognized and evaluated best by making comparative 
measurements. Accordingly, studies of changes occurring in our 
modern civilization require a set of standards in order to make these com- 
' parisons. For evidence of a need for making such studies it will be help- 
| ful to note the comments of competent observers in various fields. 
i Ernest Thompson Seton has been a critical student of the early Ameri￾can civilization that preceded modern European invasion and conquest. 
In his analysis of the relative virtues of the American Indian as recorded 
in his book The Gospel of the Red Man’ he makes this observation: 
“The civilization of the white man is a failure; it is visibly crumbling 
around us. It has failed at every crucial test. No one who measures things 
by results can question this fundamental statement.” 
Referring to the comparative physical qualities of our modern whites 
he says: 
\ “All historians, hostile and friendly, admit the Indian to have been the 
\ finest type of physical manhood the world has ever known. None but the 
| best, the picked, chosen and trained of the Whites, had any chance with 
! ”? | him. 
| In his discussion of the comparable cultural qualities of the modern 
whites and the Indians he states: 
“The culture and civilization of the White man are essentially ma￾terial; his measure of success is ‘How much property have I acquired 
| for myself?’ The culture of the Red man is fundamentally spiritual; his 
| measure of success 1s, ‘How much service have I rendered to my peo￾ple?’” 
' The severe expressions of modern degeneration as they affect various 
‘ organs and tissues constitute the every day experince of surgeons. This 
group of specialists has developed because of the imperative need that 
diseased parts of organs and tissues should be removed in order to pro￾long the function and comfort of other structures. Sir Arbuthnot Lane, 
a world renowned authority on the disturbances of the intestinal tract 
‘of the modernized whites as compared with the more normal functioning 
of primitive races, has expressed his deep impressions in his Preface to 
Maori Symbolism’ as follows: 
485 486 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
“Long surgical experience has proved to me conclusively that there 
is something radically and fundamentally wrong with the civilized 
mode of life, and I believe that unless the present dietetic and health 
customs of the White Nations are reorganized, social decay and race 
deterioration are inevitable.” 
Sociologists emphasize strongly the evidences of an alarming increase 
in the percentage of individuals in our modernized cultures who cannot 
manage their own lives successfully, and hence require some supervision 
by those who are more competent. Laird in discussing this problem under 
the title The Tail That Wags the Nation’ states: 
“The country’s average level of general ability sinks lower with each 
generation. Should the ballot be restricted to citizens able to take 
care of themselves? One out of four cannot. ... The tail is wagging 
Washington, and Wall Street and LaSalle Street.” 
The seriousness of the decline in modern physical fiitness has been em￾phasized by many individuals and organizations. An expression of the 
deep interest and concern is seen in the large contributions amounting to 
many millions of dollars yearly for scientific research to find the con￾tributing factors. This generous response by philanthropists has made 
possible the engaging of the services of many prominent research workers 
in various fields of investigation. Among these, the contributions of Dr. 
Alexis Carrel have been outstanding. In his profound studies of the prob￾lem under the title Man, the Unknown he has made a most forceful re￾view of the present dilemma and places great importance on modern 
man’s increased susceptibility to degenerative diseases. In relating this 
phase to modern medicine he states: 
“Medicine is far from having decreased human suffering as much 
| as it endeavors to make us believe. Indeed, the number of deaths 
| from infectious diseases has greatly diminished. But we still must 
| die in i a much larger proportion from degenerative diseases. .. . All 
It | 10 4 oa | diseases of bacterial origin have decreased in a striking manner... . 
| Nevertheless, in spite of the triumphs of medical science, the prob- 
_lem of disease is far from solved. Modern man is delicate. Eleven 
hundred thousand persons have to attend the medical needs of 120,- 
| 000,000 other persons. Every year, among this population of the | United States, there are about 100,000,000 illnesses, serious or slight. In the hospitals, 700,000 beds are occupied every day of the year. 
. Medical care, under all its forms, costs about $3,500,000,000 STEPS IN OUR MODERN DEGENERATION 487 
yearly. ... The organism seems to have become more susceptible to 
degenerative diseases.” 
While it has been a matter of general knowledge that progressive de￾terioration was in operation, the search for contributing factors has not 
adequately revealed the causes. The forces at work have been largely 
‘assigned to either heredity or environment. The exponents of these two 
/\ views have marshalled impressive evidence in support of their interpreta￾tions. It is of particular importance that practically all of the efforts at 
correction have been built around either the prevention of reproduction 
| by defective individuals or the modifying of the environment of defec- 
) tives in order to prevent or correct the development of the disturbance. 
| A widely accepted interpretation of the controlling factors in heredity 
has been the acceptance of the principle that the carriers of individual 
qualities, as involved in the function of the sex cells and the entire pro￾cesses of reproduction and development, are practically immutable and 
as such cannot readily be modified by the environment into which the 
individual is born. These principles have been supported by impressive 
evidence from both animal and plant life illustrating the laws of trans￾mission of Mendelian qualities. The very principle on which racial and 
tribal characteristics are evaluated and classified implies a faithful trans￾mission from generation to generation. This view requires that these 
dominating forces prevail over disturbances in prenatal environment and 
provide normal offspring from normal ancestry. 
That the journey of the fetus resulting from the fertilized ovum en￾counters grave experiences in the prenatal environment is indicatd by 
the report of the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecolo￾gists as follows: 
y “Out of every one hundred pregnancies in the United States, 25 are 
| lost before birth.” 
An evaluation of the controlling forces requires that light be thrown 
on the role of each heredity and environment and on the forces at work 
—each—prior to fertilization, during gestation and after birth. As an 
approach to this phase it is important that we have in mind the nature of 
the defects, for which we must find the causes. 
The ills of modern man have required the services of large groups of 
specialists trained for rendering service in the various fields. The dental 
profession is organized to serve civilization and treat and care for the ills 
of the oral cavity including dental caries, dental arch deformities and 
diseased supporting tissues of the teeth. Similarly, each organ of the body —— 
488 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
has its corps of specialists equipped to furnish first aid and make repairs 
and adjustments where possible. Their greatest effort, and in the dental 
profession nearly the entire effort, is expended in repair and replacement 
of defective or removed organs. Available data indicate that from 90 to 
100 per cent of the individuals in our modernized groups have suffered 
from dental caries. 
A comprehensive study of modern degeneration will require the use of 
controls in order that standards of excellence may be established. Not 
finding adequate controls in our affected groups it became necessary to 
look elsewhere in Nature’s great biological laboratory which has been in 
operation throughout the history of life. For this the primitive racial 
stocks that have persisted through centuries have been selected. These 
have been located both where still protected by the isolation, and where 
they were in the process of being modernized by contact with the cul￾ture and commerce of the white man. For this fourteen primitive racial 
stocks have been studied by comparing the individuals of the more iso￾lated groups with groups of the same stock in various stages of modern￾ization, also with modernized Europeans and Americans. The following 
primitive racial stocks have been studied: Swiss, Gaelics, Eskimos, North 
American Indians, Polynesians, Melanesians, Africans, Australian Abori￾gines, New Zealand Maori, Malay Micronesians, Ancient Peruvians, Iso￾lated Peruvian Indians, High Andes Indians and Amazon Jungle Indians. 
The data obtained from these comparative studies together with the re￾sults of animal experimentation are the basis for this report. 
[t is clearly impossible in the limited space available for this text to 
include extended supporting data. The data presented here will be classed 
under two heads; injuries that result from forces at work after the in￾dividual is born, and those that are produced prior to birth. For brevity 
and to avoid confusion arising out of extended details only general results 
are provided in this text. 
Were it not for the greater importance of the larger problems involved 
in modern degeneration, it would be appropriate to use the available 
space for this chapter in the discussion of new light on the dental caries 
problem since the detailed data are so illuminating. Under the circum￾stances the dental problem will be discussed here only briefly. Clearly 
the personality and behaviour problems are most important. 
However the comparative incidence of dental caries in the various 
isolated groups and the same groups when modernized, expressed in terms 
of affected teeth, ranged from an average of about one per cent for the 
isolated to thirty per cent of all teeth studied for the modernized. In STEPS IN OUR MODERN DEGENERA'LION 489 
several groups the effect of contact with modern white culture and its 
commerce involved an increase in the incidence of dental caries of several 
hundred fold. The one factor in the contact with modern civilization 
that was universally found to be present and always associated with loss 
of immunity to dental caries and in proportion to its use, was a change 
from the native foods as selected by the isolated groups to the commer￾cial foods of commerce. In many groups the loss of immunity occurred 
promptly after the change in nutrition was established and existed only 
during the period of the change, immunity being reestablished with the 
return to the original nutrition of the tribe. 
This is illustrated by the calling of ships to isolated islands in the Paci￾fic to purchase copra (dried cocoanut meat) when the price suddenly 
rose from forty dollars to four hundred dollars a ton. This lasted for only 
a short time and in two years the price dropped to about four dollars per 
ton, which changed factor that could be found in the environment was 
the displacement of the native diets with the foods of commerce that 
were used to make the exchange. I was informed personally by the ad￾ministrator in charge of the outfitting of trading vessels that 90 per cent 
of the exchange was required to be taken in white flour and sugar and 
only 10 per cent could be taken in clothing and other products. In pots 
of regular call on ship routes the displacing diet included also canned 
foods, polished rice, vegetable fats, etc. 
My studies on isolated Pacific Islands were made a few years after the 
temporary calling of copra ships. They revealed that teeth that had re￾cently erupted, particularly first or second molars, at the time there wa; 
a change in the nutrition, had evidence of past active caries related di￾rectly to the period of changed nutrition. The cavities were open bu: 
immunity had been reestablished by a return to the native foods. 
The data obtained from these various studies strongly indicated that 
the presence or absence of immunity of the teeth to dental caries was not 
dependent upon a change of structure in the formative period. The prob￾lem of immunity to dental caries has seemed clearly to be related to nu￾trition of the affected individual at the time the dental caries is active. 
Similarly other effects such as rickets, avitaminosis diseases, were found 
to relate to changes in the structure of the organs and tissues rather than 
being transmitted qualities from the ancestry. A large group of affections 
were found to be directly related to forces that were operative before 
birth. These contribute the principal discussion of this chapter. 
A glimpse of the dental tragedy which ushers in the disappearance of 
many of these primitive racial stocks is easily shown. 490 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
The girl (figure 38) is an Hawaiian. She is not only suffering from 
abscessing teeth but is coughing with tuberculosis, from which her 
mother and a brother recently died. The boy (figure 32) upper right is 
a Fijian, typical of many suffering from abscessing teeth. The woman to 
the right below is a typical illustration of the Australian aborigines con￾fined in reservations in Australia being fed by the government. The 
woman at the lower right (fig.26) is atypical modernized Florida Indian. 
A bird’s eye view of factors found associated with mental and moral 
expressions of physical deficiency shows common biologic contributing 
agents. 
The end result has been the same in all the primitive racial stocks 
studied when they changed from their native dietary as selected in ac￾cordance with the accumulated wisdom of their race to the foods of mod￾ern commerce. These have been largely the same for the different groups. 
It is a matter of great importance in connection with the world problem 
of dental caries that these several racial groups that established immunity 
for themselves by using a proper selection of available food did so on very 
different dietaries when judged on the basis of type and name of the 
foods. Their efficient diets, however, were very similar when reduced to 
mineral and vitamin content. The outstanding difference from the chem￾ical standpoint is the comparative level of body building and body re￾pairing materials in proportion to heat and energy factors or calories. 
In general all the efficient dietaries were found to contain two to six times 
as high a factor of safety in the matter of body building material, as the 
displacing foods. 
The people in the isolated valleys of Switzerland provided a high im- 
| munity by the use of exceptionally high vitamin dairy products and 
entire rye bread, with meat about once a week and vegetables as avail￾able, chiefly in the summer. 
The people of the Outer Hebrides accomplished high immunity with 
the use of sea foods, oat cake and oat porridge with limited vegetables in 
season. Marine plants also were used. 
The Eskimos and Indians of Alaska and the Far North accomplished 
a high immunity with sea and land animal tissues used as foods but lim￾ited vegetables and very limited seeds. Green foods were used in season 
and in some districts were stored. The organs of animals were used liber￾ally. 
The people of the South Sea Islands whether Polynesian, Melanesian STEPS IN OUR MODERN DEGENERATION 491 
‘or Micronesian provided a high immunity with a liberal use of sea animal 
foods, marine and land plants, limited seeds and lily roots or taro. 
The cattle tribes of Africa established their high immunity by the use 
of milk, blood and meat supplemented by plant foods. The agricultural 
tribes of Africa used domestic animals, utilizing their organs, fresh water 
animal life, insects and a variety of plants. 
The Australian Aborigines established their high immunity by the use 
of large and small wild animal life, wild plants, and where available, fresh 
water or marine sea life, large and small. 
The New Zeaand Maori had a high immunity to dental caries by a lib￾eral use of sea animal life, marine plants, marine birds and their eggs, 
land birds, seeds of trees and plants and vegetables, particularly fern root. 
The Indians of the plains of North and South America provided a high 
_ immunity by a liberal use of the organs and tissues of wild animal life, 
a large variety of plant foods and fresh and salt water animal life, as 
available. 
The coastal Indian tribes of North and South America provided a high 
_ immunity by a liberal use of sea animal life together with plant life of 
_ the coastal region. 
The Amazon Jungle Indians provided a high immunity with a liberal 
use of fresh water animal life, small land animals and birds, and wild 
, plants and seeds. 
In all of these groups the displacing diets that consisted of the foods of 
commerce were more or less highly refined sugars, refined flours, canned 
i goods, vegetable fats and polished rice. 
My investigations have included, when visiting these tribes, the gath￾ering of samples of foods utilized by them. These were carried or sent to 
my laboratory for chemical analysis. Clinical investigations also were 
made in which individuals who had lost their immunity to dental caries 
in our modern highly susceptible groups were provided special dietaries 
which were modified to make them as nearly as possible equivalent in 
minerals and vitamins to the efficient primitive dietaries. The result of 
doing so not only has prevented the development of dental caries (when 
caries is the problem involved) in practically all cooperating individuals 
but has controlled it where active in over ninety per cent of the individ￾uals so studied. 
DEPARTURE FROM RACIAL TYPES 
/ An important new light has been thrown by these studies among 
i 
i j | 
primitive races on modern departure from racial types. Whereas it has 
been assumed that gross changes in physical form could only result from 492 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
| influences operative through a vast number of generations, these studies 
have revealed that gross changes can occur in a single new generation. 
| have referred to the view in physical anthropology that has provided 
' for the classification of skeletal material and its assignment to races on 
the basis of uniformity of structure and design. This has also enabled in- 
' dividuals to be classified into racial groups while living. It is based on re￾cognition of similarity of facial and body form in various individuals in 
a given racial stock and recognizes a constancy regardless of location. 
_ This constitutes a fundamental expression of the laws of heredity. 
_ This is illustrated in Figure 98 in which four Melanesian boys are 
shown who were photographed on different islands where the stock was 
still isolated. While they probably have never seen each other the family 
resemblance is purely a racial resemblance and demonstrates that under 
an adequate environment the racial characteristics were perfected in 
these various locations some of them hundreds of miles apart. 
Similarly in Figure 99 will be seen Polynesian girls. They look like sis￾ters but only so because they look like Polynesians. They have been born 
and lived in locations many hundreds of miles apart. In these groups the 
accumulated wisdom regarding nutrition was similar. 
We are concerned to know how quickly gross changes like these can 
occur. An important part of these studies included an examination of 
parents and their offspring, both where still isolated and where recently 
modernized. In Figure 101 above is shown an African father and son of 
the Wakamba tribe. The father was born before the advent of imported 
foods. He works for the railroad which furnishes the family nutrition 
and his son has a marked change in facial form as may be seen. In Figure 
101 below will be seen a Fiji father and son. The father was born before 
the influence of foods of commerce had reached that group. He and his 
wife have excellently developed faces and normal dental arches.Their 
son was born after the change in nutrition. The father works for a sugar 
plantation which provided the commercial foods. The son has a narrowed 
upper dental arch, and modified facial form. 
In Figure 100 Page 305 above is seen a father and his son of a coastal 
Indian tribe in Peru. Note the father’s excellent facial and dental arch 
development. He was born when his parents lived largely on sea foods. 
He is now working for the International Oil Company at Talara which 
furnishes the food for the family. The boy has badly deformed dental 
arches. In Figure 100 Page 305 below, is shown an Indian father and son 
living in the High Andes in Peru. The father is the product of the primi- STEPS IN OUR MODERN DEGENERATION 493 
tive nutrition as used by his parents, and the son is the product of the 
use by his parents of modern foods of commerce. 
These marked changes in facial form are characteristic of many in￾dividuals in our modern civilization and in the modernized groups of the 
primitive racial stocks represented in this study. 
If space for illustrations permitted we would use many obtained in 
various parts of the world indicating the superior physical structure in￾cluding facial and dental arch design as found among primitive races in 
many countries. People do not require to be specialists to recognize a 
large percentage of individuals in modern European and American life 
with deformities of the face and dental arches. My studies in many parts 
of the United States and Europe have disclosed that from 25 to 75 per 
cent of the population carry injuries of these types. In some communi￾ties the percentage is even higher. 
In contrast with this, in a study of twenty-seven native tribes in east￾ern and central Africa, I found thirteen tribes in which I did not record a 
single instance of even moderate deformity of facial and dental arch 
form. Similarly, in studies in Peru of the ancient burials along the coast, 
an examination of 1,276 skulls in succession did not reveal one with de￾formity of the facial design and dental arch form. The modernized na￾tives in these as in all modernized groups showed a considerable percent￾age of the population with gross deformities. The change that occurs in 
even the next generation after the parents have adopted the modern 
foods of commerce is so marked that one would expect that some other 
force like mixture of bloods would be involved. This is typically illus￾trated in Figures. While a considerable variety of pattern changes occur 
in each racial group with modernization, I have selected as an example 
a very common type of deformity consisting of a dropping inward of the 
upper laterals with a narrowing of the upper arch and consequent promi￾nence of the cuspids. This will be recognized as a very frequently occur￾ring deformity in our modern civilization. In many figures this has 
developed in a modernized Eskimo; B, an Indian of northern Canada; C, 
\a Polynesian of the South Sea Islands; D, an East Indian of Mombasa; 
IE, a Negro of Belgian Congo and F, an Arab of Khartoum. Similar illus￾esis are abundant in each of the primitive racial stocks examined 
wherever they are in the process of modernization, occurring even in the 
first generation after the adoption by the parents of foods of modern 
commerce. 
| | The gross physical changes occurring promptly after modernization 494 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
' were not limited to structures of the head. The narrowing and lengthen- 
_ ing of the face was usually only a small part of the change in body form. 
— 
The hips and chest were usually narrowed with a tendency for narrowing 
throughout the length of the body. As we will see later, the bones of the 
head, particularly the maxillary bones, seem to suffer most severely. 
An important development occurs in a large percentage of our modern 
families which, so far as I know, has been entirely overlooked by even 
the members of the dental profession. This is expressed as changes within 
the family group in individual facial and body form, which disturbances 
tend to occur more severely in late members of a family than in the first 
or early born. Orthodontists will have an opportunity to study this phase 
by noting the birth rank of the children of a family who have greatest 
need for orthodontia. Where the child needing this service is the oldest, 
it is very often the only child in the family. Another factor operates of 
course, namely, that an only child will often receive professional service 
because the expense can be afforded while it cannot always be afforded 
for the children of large families. The fact that among both the modern￾ized primitives and our modern whites there is a tendency for a greater 
injury to occur in the late children in the family is of great significance, 
because of its indication that a lowering of capacity for reproduction has 
occurred in the parents. Chapter 27 
NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS FOR RACE 
REGENERATION 
UR modern civilizations are doubly indebted to the primitive races 
() for they have both demonstrated what we might be like in physi￾cal form and health and have indicated the nutritional require￾ments for doing so. 
| We will consider these expressions of modern degeneration under two 
main headings, namely, (see group 1) those caused chiefly by the faulty 
| nutrition of the affected individual, and, (group 2) those caused in large 
| part, by parental deficiencies which affect function. 
Typical expressions of the former are: dental caries, peridontal in￾flammations, so-called pyorrhea alveolaris, types of eye inflammations, 
_ | failing vision, scurvy, un-united fractures, recurring spasmodic fractures, 
| skeletal affections, joint pains, berri berri, pellagra and sterility. Over 
\ ninety have been reported by McCarrion, Reference 2, Wrench, “The 
) Wheel of Health.” 
The second group of affections are associated with prenatal injuries, 
caused by parental vitamin and mineral deficiencies, before and at the 
_ time of fertilization. These affect the germ cells, thereby producing a de￾fective fertilized ovum and defective fetus. 
In this group (2) are hare-lip, cleft palate, narrow hips, narrow face, 
constricted nostrils, mental backwardness, juvenile delinquency, skull 
defects of the face and the floor of the brain, brain defects, mongoloid￾ism, idiocy, etc. These two groups will be discussed and illustrated sepa￾rately in this chapter. 
At the point of contact of modern commerce with large areas in which 
the primitive racial stocks have been protected by their isolation, we find 
degeneration of the human stock in its worst phase. 
In order to reach the Pelly Mountain Indian tribes in the interior of 
the far north of Canada, just inside the continental divide, the only 
method of approach that seemed justified or practical was to travel 
up the Stikine River, which flows into the Pacific in the vicinity of 
Wrangell. A high-powered, Diesel-engined, shallow-draft boat has been 
constructed for this purpose. The river winds through snow-capped 
mountains, which progressively rise to higher heights as one approaches 
the continental divide. The river finally becomes so narrow and the gorge 
495 496 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
so deep that for forty miles beyond the last landing stage the banks are 
so steep that, we were advised, moose could not leave the water and scale 
the banks. In order to cross the divide a truck is used over an old moose 
trail. 
The engineering problems involved in making that journey call for the 
finest craftsmen. For example, the experiences crossing the divide were 
so harrowing that a young man, who was being sent to a Hudson Bay 
post, the one farthest north in the interior to relieve the man who had 
been in charge, made the comment that if he had to go over that road 
again in order to get out to civilization, he would rather die there than 
endure the frights he had on that trip. At places on the road, we were 
shown where two trucks and their loads had slipped down the river wall 
and all were lost. 
The chief industry that has used the Stikine River navigation has 
probably been the Hudson Bay Co. in order to obtain the furs collected 
by the Indian tribes. These are carried across the divide from one to

several hundred miles. The commodity of exchange, as in most parts, is 
not money but goods. In this district, this means blankets, for which the 
Hudson Bay Co. is so famous, and other apparel, together with foods 
such as are used by the modern whites outside. This latter consists chiefly 
of white flour, refined sugar, jams. 
At the terminus of navigation, Telegraph Creek, in addition to the 498 NUTRITION AND PHYS.CAL DEGENERATION 
important Hudson Bay post the government Indian. Agent is located. It 
was through his highly esteemed assistance that we were able to arrange 
in advance, both for the permission to enter the north country and for 
transportation. At this point is also located a group of missionaries who 
are teaching the people modernized methods for living. 
Several score of Indian families and half-breeds, a few families of 
whites, have congregated around this business center. 
We visited a number of their homes and found many bed-ridden crip￾ples, including boys and girls in their late teens. A striking illustration 
is shown in figure No. 145. This young man’s jaw is locked in the open 
position and note that his right hand has been distorted by the pull of 
the muscles so that the hand is folded back on the forearm. The extrem￾ity of his suffering cannot readily be imagined. 
In figure No. 146 are seen three children suffering with tuberculosis. 
The two boys have tubercular infection of the glands of the neck. The 
girl, above, pulmonary tuberculosis in the late stages. The fence in front 
of her tent, we were told, was to keep the dogs away. 
These children were in the vicinity of the interior post over the divide 
and had been and were living on the imported foods whereas their 
parents and untold generations before had lived on the native foods of 
<St. 
Fig. 147.—This happy healthy Indian family live in the deep woods of the far north on Nature’s natural foods. NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS FOR RACE REGENERATION 499 
moose meat, moose livers, caribou, bear, ground nuts, dried berries and 
dried buds of trees. 
A picture of a typical native Indian family in the far north, who were 
and had been living on their native foods, is shown in figure No. 147. 
The meat on the drying racks, shown in the picture, consists of moose 
liver and slabs of moose meat. The hardihood of the native Indian men is 
splendidly illustrated by an incident that happened on the last trip of the 
truck across the divide, prior to our crossing. The truck broke down 
about half way over the two or three day return trip and he had to leave 
his two passengers and walk the sixty-five miles back to Telegraph Creek 
for another truck. This he did without stopping to rest or eat, a journey 
which took eighteen hours. 
The lesson we should learn is that these primitive Indians living in that 
_ very inclement climate were able, before the advent of the modern foods, 
to build superb bodies and that, in even the first generation after the ar- 
_ rival of modern foods, their children broke down with typical nutri￾tional deficiency diseases. 
Under the second group of infections, namely those due to prenatal 
defects, caused by deficient nutrition of one or both parents prior to fer￾tilization, we will emphasize the wisdom of the primitives in providing 
sources of food that will be adequate for preventing this type of injury. 
I have presented evidence in Chapter 17 “One Origin of Physical De￾formities” using illustrations from several of the primitive groups which 
indicate the nature of these defects. 
On pages 303, 4, 5 and 7, I presented data indicating the normal facial 
structure of several primitive groups and then have shown members of 
_ the next generation with marked changes in physical form, particularly 
' of the face. I have emphasized that this appears in severe form in even 
| 
~ the first generation. 
On pages 308, 9, 11, 12 and 13, I presented data demonstrating that 
the injury is more severe in later children born in the family as compared 
with the first. This seems clearly to show a lowering of reproductive 
capacity of one or both parents and usually of the mother. 
On pages 314, 15 and 17, I presented evidence showing that the injury 
"is progressive through three successive births. The data strongly empha- 
' size that many structures of the body may be involved. Among them, 
the deformity of club feet is very frequent. This is illustrated on pages 
SIP ep 1 Osand 20: 
Chapter 18 covers data emphasizing the frequent association of lowered 
defense against infection. On pages 327, 29, 30 and 31, I have shown 500 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
cases of individuals with low capacity of resisting tubercular infection, 
all of whom show physical evidence of prenatal injury by deformities of 
' the dental arches. 
_ Fortunately, experimental animals can be used to demonstrate the 
types of deficiencies that produce typical physical deformities. I have 
emphasized this phase by giving- the history of several animals used in 
the study of the problem. On pages 338 and 340 are shown pigs, pre￾senting a large group of defects, all born to the same mother. In that 
group, six mother pigs were purposely deprived of Vitamin A by Prof. 
Fred Hale. Fifty-nine little pigs were born of these six sows, not one of 
which had an eyeball. Other lesions produced were defective ears, club 
feet, cleft palate, hare-lip and spinal bifidae. Later litters were produced 
by these same sows, while on an adequate nutrition, without the produc￾tion of any defectives and still more important, when these blind pigs 
were mated they produced litters with normal eyeballs. This is contrary 
to the tenets of the hereditary transfer of these defects. 
I also presented data illustrating the serious loss amongst dairy cattle 
and sheep herds during drought periods. In figure 148 are shown, in the 
| lower group, three pups. In the first from the left, the pup was born with 
the intestines outside the abdomen. The next two have an unique his- 
| tory, they both show cleft palates. The mother of these pups has had five 
| litters the first four all by the same sire. In the first three litters, when 
| both were on an adequate nutrition, all pups were perfect. In the fourth 
_ litter ten pups were born of which eight had cleft palates and only two 
were normal. Both parents were on an inadequate nutrition prior to and 
at the time of this fertilization. In the fifth litter this mother dog was 
/mated to her own son and if this factor had been of hereditary origin, 
this defect would have to appear according to Mendel’s law. Three pups 
were born, all of which were perfect. 
In my correspondence with an observing teacher in the hill country 
of western Pennsylvania, she reported that in her school a condition was 
frequent in the families, namely, that the children could not carry pre￾scribed text book work because of low mentality. This is often spoken of, 
though incorrectly, as delayed mentality. In one family of eight children 
only the first child was normal. The mental and physical injuries were 
progressively more severe. The eighth child had both hare-lip and double 
cleft palate. The seventh child had cleft palate and the sixth was a near 
idiot. The second to the fifth, inclusive, presented increasing degrees of 
disturbed mentality. NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS FOR RACE REGENERATION © 501

In my cabin to cabin studies of families living in the hill country of 
North Carolina, I found many cases of physical and mental injury. 
Among these cases arthritis and heart disease were very frequent, many 
individuals being bedridden. A typical case is shown in the upper part of 
figure 148 of a father and mother and their one child. The child is so 
badly injured that he is mentally an imbecile. They are living on very

poor land where even the vegetable growth is scant and of poor quality. 
Their food consisted very largely of corn bread, corn syrup, some fat 
pork and strong coffee. 
In my studies amongst the primitive races, I was continually impressed 
_with the increase of population where foods were most efficient. This is 
' strikingly demonstrated by the physical evidence of dense populations 
_ which lived through several centuries along the west coast of Peru. 
The Chimu tribe make their burials in the dry sand. The scantiness of 
rain in that area is demonstrated by the fact that their clay walled cabins, 
built hundreds of years ago, are still standing in large numbers. There 
has not been sufficient rainfall to wash down these walls. That they ob￾tained ample water is shown by the many aqueducts, one of which ex￾tended for many hundreds miles into the Andes mountain wall, which 
rises to twenty and twenty-two thousand feet, some of the passes being 
sixteen thousand feet above sea level. 
An important part of nutrition was provided in the sea food. This is 
_ supplied by abundant food for sea animal life, from the vicinity of the 
| South Pole ice caps. In many parts of the world the primitives made their 
_ habitation by those seas where an abundance of fish eating birds were in 
- evidence and where seals and sea lions lived in large numbers. This is 
_ splendidly illustrated, for the Peru coast, in figure 149, in the upper part 
of which is shown a flock of fish eating birds, that range in size compar￾able to ducks and geese. They fly over the sea and dive into it to catch the 
fish. The splashes show where they have just dived to make their daily 
catch. In the lower part of the picture is a herd of sea lions, which I was 
advised included over a million. Each sea lion was Said to eat an average 
of seventy-five pounds a day. 
That the earlier members of the Chimu tribe were good fishermen is 
readily shown by the extensive fishing nets removed in large numbers 
_ from the burials. I personally examined many hundreds of the skeletons 
and in not one did I find a dental arch which was constricted or the teeth 
out of line. Tooth decay was apparently practically unknown to the cul- 
- tural group. 
Our war department Records reveal that in both world wars, one and 
two, from thirty to seventy percent of the young men of the draft age 
were found to be unfit for field service. It is urgent that we learn why. 
Modern civilization is in a dilemma. The biggest problem in the world 
today is not war, but means for race betterment. Epidemics, plagues and 
infectious diseases are largely under control. Today, the members of the 50f NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
healing professions are engaged in alleviating suffering from degenera￾tive diseases by means of remedial surgery and makeshift repairs. 
A prime requisite is a new orientation; first, for recognizing our di- 
‘lemmas, and second for establishing educational programs and leadership 
for human conservation through race betterment. As an aid to this new 
orientation, let us review the observations of some of our leaders in social 
sciences. 
1. Modern man is delicate... . The organism seems to have become 
more susceptible to degenerative diseases. (Carrel. ) 
2. Nearly one-third of the whole population (of two dozen states) 
is of a type to require some supervision. (Laird.) 
3. Of 2,000,000 babies to be born in 1941, 738,386 will be wholly or ° 
partially wasted, 37%. (Nat’l Committee for Planned Parenthood.) 
4. Measurable brain can be correlated with testable mind. (Waverly 
Researches. ) 
§. Thinking is as biologic as digestion. (Thorndike. ) 
6. Of all the psychological causes of crime, the commonest and grav￾est is usually alleged to be a defective mind. .. (Burt.) 
7. ...Gross human congenital malformations arise solely from influ￾ences which affect the germ cells prior to fertilization. ... (Murphy.) 
8. Eggs (fertilized ova) are not all of equal quality, 25°, are not 
good enough to be born as living individuals. (Streeter. ) } 
9. It is store food which has given us store teeth. (Hooton.) 
10. There is a nutritional basis for modern physical, mental and 
moral degeneration. (Price.) 
Evidence of our modern degeneration is developing at an increasing 
rate and has now reached a point where the continued existence of mod￾ern civilization is threatened. This is well illustrated in the alarming death 
rate from several modern degenerative diseases. The report of the Metro￾politan Life Insurance Company under date of August 1941 reveals that 
death rates per hundred thousand policy holders had reached, for the 
month of July 1941, 714 for all causes. Of these, 185 were from heart 
_ disease and arterial conditions and 100 from cancer, death rates from all 
other causes combined being 429. Whereas, formerly infectious diseases 
accounted for the large proportion of deaths, these are now well under 
control, but the degenerative diseases have increased to such an alarming 
_ extent that in this total of 714 deaths for the month of July for each 
_ hundred thousand policyholders, the degenerative diseases now constitute 
420, or 60 per cent, of the total. Of the degenerative diseases, conditions NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS FOR RACE REGENERATION — 305 
of the heart and arteries and cancer took 285, or 40 per cent; while all 
jof the other causes took only 293, or 40 per cent. The latter number in￾cluded automobile accident. Even this wastage of human life is not ade￾quately expressed by a consideration of the principal causes of death after 
birth; since of every hundred pregnancies in the United States, twenty 
five are reported to end before term.

Soil Minerals as Provided by the 
Original Source , the Igneous Rocks. 
Fig. 150 
All our Calcium and Phosphorus came originally from apatite which constitutes only 
six-hundredths percent of the earth’s surface. 
In order that we may get a bird’s-eye view of simply one factor in 
progressive modern degeneration, let us consider the problem of depletion 
of soils. In Figure 150, we see expressed diagrammatically the ratio of the 
various minerals that make up the soil of the earth from which all our 506 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
_ plant foods must develop. It is of interest that calcium and phosphorus 
are limited to the small section at the left of the circle. Calcium and phos￾phorus, in the group of minerals classed as apatite, constitute only a mi￾nute percentage of the earth’s surface. These two minerals. forming as 
they do the principal constituents of bone, are in greatest demand in the 
growth of animal life. 
It will aid us in visualizing the difficulties involved in obtaining these 
minerals by plants and animals to observe with regard to phosphorus that 
it constitutes only about one part in 1,000 of the earth’s crust. Plants, 
dry weight, require about 30 parts per thousand; while animals with 
skeletons, dry weight, require it in the ratio of 100 parts in 1,000. The 
only source of phosphorus is the soil on which the plants grow, and we 
must realize that the top 7 inches of an acre of ground contains only 
about 1,000 pounds of phosphorus in a chemical form in which plants 
can use it. Now when we realize that a 60-bushel crop per acre of wheat 
or corn will remove from the soil about 25 pounds of phosphorus per 
acre, or one-fortieth of the total content of the top 7 inches, we are im￾mediately confronted with the fundamental, controlling problem that 
we have, accordingly, only enough phosphorus in the average soil for 
forty excellent crops. This is why we see so many farms that have been 
abandoned because they have been exhausted of their minerals, particu￾larly phosphorus. It is also the reason that the annual death rates are so 
rapidly increasing in certain parts of the country, particularly those dis￾tricts that have been longest settled or where the soil is shallowest. 
While it is true that only about one-thousandth of the original earth’s 
surface consists of available phosphorus, Nature’s system of management 
of plant and animal life provides for an accumulation of the minerals 
most used by increasing the concentration of these minerals on the sur￾face of the soil. In Nature’s program, plants and animals return to the 
earth what they borrow. The roots of plants, large and small, particu￾larly forests, bring up the required minerals from the various depths to 
which the roots penetrate and deposit them as fallen leaves and trunks, 
to decay on the surface. By this method, Nature builds an enriched top 
soil, production of one inch of which requires 400 years. Our prairies 
have from 4,000 to 10,000 years of accumulated top soil, which greatly 
reinforces the capacity of the surface for plant growth. The top soil is 
normally held by the roots of grasses and shrubs. When the roots are all 
removed, the wind and water rapidly carry away top soil, chiefly to the 
ocean, where it is lost for human use. 
; The death rate from heart disease in 1925 as reported by the American NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS FOR RACE REGENERATION — 507 
| Heart Association has for many areas increased 50 per cent or more, in 
| the last fifteen years. The states of New England and those bordering the 
Great Lakes, together with the Pacific coast states, constitute the areas 
where the death rates are the highest, and these are the areas that have 
_ been occupied for the longest time. Large areas of these states now have 
, a greatly reduced capacity for human maintenance, requiring that food 
| Be shipped in from other areas. 
“My studies of this problem of reduced capacity of soils for maintain￾ing animal life have included correspondence with the agricultural de￾partments of all of the states of the union with regard to maintaining 
cattle. The reduction in capacity ranges from 20 to 90 per cent, and large 
areas are reported to carry successfully now only 50 per cent as many 
head of cattle as formerly. I am advised that it would cost $50 an acre to 
replace the phosphorus alone that has been shipped off the land in large 
areas. 
There is an important fact that we should consider; namely, the role 
that has been played by glaciers in grinding up and distributing rock 
formations. One glacier, the movement of which affected the surface soil 
of Ohio, covered only about half the state; namely, that area west of 
a line starting east of Cleveland and extending diagonally across the state

They were shipped in as a reserve supply of beef for the declining population in Florida. 508 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
to Cincinnati. It is important for us to note that, in the areas south and 
east of this line, several expressions of degeneration are higher than in the 
areas north and west of this line. The infant mortality per thousand live 
births in 1939 is very informative. In the counties north and west of that 
line, the death rate was from 40 to 49 per thousand live births; whereas, 
in the area south and east of that line, the death rate was from 50 to 87. 
It is of particular interest to us as dentists that studies show the per￾centage of teeth with caries to be much higher southeast of this line than 
northwest of it. 
The effect of depletion of soils on animal life is striking. In a district in 
| which I was studying this phase of the problem, I examined ranch cattle 
| that were pasturing on a badly depleted soil where there was adequate 
| water. These cattle had been shipped into the area to provide food for 
\human beings. In one district, in traveling about 5 miles, I counted ten 
thead of cattle that had starved to death for certain minerals that had been 
depleted from the soil. A typical example is shown in Figure 151. 
Fig. 152.—These two views of the same steer show the effect of poor pasture on his horns; his wasting body is being kept alive by borrowing from his skeleton. 
Another excellent illustration of the effect of change of pasturage on cattle is shown in Figure 152. A number of well-fed long horn cattle were transferred from a good district to a poor one. Figure 152 shows two NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS FOR RACE REGENERATION — 509 
views of the same steer, at the left while pasturing on a good soil and at 
the right after being transferred to pasture on a depleted soil, indicating 
the results of depletion of the soil of minerals. Because the long rangy 
horns have been demineralized at their base, they have dropped down so 
that their tips extend far below the nose and mouth. This condition 
constituted a barrier to eating grass because the horns prevented the ani￾mal from reaching its food. In the picture to the right, the steer is badly 
emaciated. 
, Another approach to this important problem is directly related to the 
quantity of animal life, large and small, that can be maintained on grain 
food such as flour. This is of special concern because of the effect of de￾pletion of our cereal foods of natural minerals and vitamins by process￾ing. Modern white flour has had approximately four-fifths of the phos￾phorus and nearly ill of the vitamins removed by processing, in order to 
produce a flour that can be shipped without becoming infested with in￾sect life. I have been advised by millers that they could not ship flour if 
the minerals and vitamins were not removed. At once, we have an impor￾tant measure of the value of a food; namely, the quality of insect life 
that it can support. The more valuable the product for human food, the 
more insect life it will support. Whereas highly refined white flour will 
support almost no insect life, a good product will support a relatively 
large amount of insect life in proportion to the volume of flour. 
When I was studying this problem in the high Alps of Switzerland, 
I found an excellent state of physical development and health in adults 
and children living in all the high valleys. While the summers were short, 
the rate of plant growth was rapid, and rye was the only cereal that de- 
_ veloped well for human food. Herds of cattle pastured near the glaciers. 
‘ Mountaineer cabins were located near the foot of the glaciers. The chil￾Fig. 153—The half slice of whole rye bread, grown up near the glaciers in Switzerland, 
fed all the bugs in the left hand dish; the refuse is shown at the right. They cannot live on 
our highly refined white flour bread. 510 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
dren living in these cabins were exceptionally healthy. On the side of the 
valleys, rye was grown for bread. I obtained a piece of the bread that 
was made in one of these homes and put it in a bottle and carried it with 
other foods to my laboratory for chemical analysis. It was rich in min￾erals and vitamins. 
In Figure 153, the dish to the right contains all of the residue of that 
bread after it had been eaten by the bugs which later developed in it. The 
one at the left shows the quantity of skeletons of bugs that had devel￾oped in and lived upon this one small piece of bread. This explained why 
the human life living upon it was so exceptionally fine. Bugs and children 
require the same minerals and vitamins. Our modern white bread cannot 
support much insect life. 
This is one of the evils that has accompanied our progress in modern￾ization. We do not realize how much modern human beings are handi￾capped and injured since they learned how to modify Nature’s foods. 
The wild animal uses Nature’s foods as Nature makes them. This was 
true of the earlier races of mankind. In proportion as man has learned 
to modify Nature’s foods, he has degenerated. 
STARS IN A CAVE 
Delighted were archeologists 
to discover a prehistoric cave￾wall painting of the Pleiades 
star group, “Seven Sisters.” But 
surprised were they that the an￾cient artist painted ten stars, 
four of which we need telescopes 
to see. Natural guess: stars were 
brighter then. Astronomers said 
“No.” . . .the artist had seen all

The physical qualities of the Neanderthal man as he inhabited southern 
Europe are attested by the perfection of his skeleton. Prof. Sergio Sergi, 
of Rome University shows what is called the most perfect Neander￾thal skull. I visited him in Rome and studied his wonderful collection 
in 1935. Whereas only four skulls out of 4,000 belonging to the pre￾Christian era and gathered from Italy and surrounding islands showed 
serious malformations, approximately 40 per cent of the skulls in the 
collection of people who died in the last fifty years showed gross imper￾fections and abnormal formations. These people had all died in mental 
institutions. 
I have been impressed many times in my studies with the superior 
_ physical development and acuteness of the senses of primitive races. This 
is strikingly illustrated in the visual acuity of the Maori of New Zealand, 
the Aborigines of Australia and some African tribes. Figure 154 shows 
| a caveman. He did not need a telescope to correctly draw the position 
_ of the stars constitutiing the constellation of Pleiades. 
I was advised that the Australian Aborigine could see a mile away ani￾mals which the white man could not see. 
It has been my privilege to study the skeletal remains of primitive 
groups in many parts of the world. I have been continually impressed 
with the superior qualities exhibited, particularly skull development and 
design of dental arches. Among the skulls of the Maoris of New Zea￾land, of individuals who lived before the coming of the white man, 
only one tooth per thousand teeth had been attacked by decay. This is in 
striking contrast with the condition of the teeth of this same people to￾day since it has become largely modernized by contact with the white 
population. In my studies of modernized Maori groups, I found from 
300 to 600 per thousand teeth attacked by dental caries. This is a typical 
and striking illustration of modern degeneration. The whites of New 
Zealand, according to their own dentists have the poorest teeth in the 
world today. A typical primitive Maori skull shows excellent dental 
arches. 
I have recently made a study of preColumbian Indian burials in seven 
of the southeastern states. It has been impressive to see that those groups 
that lived near the coast and used sea animal-life abundantly, as evi￾denced from the material found in the burials, had excellent skeletal de￾velopment, usually with complete freedom from dental caries. This was 
also true of skeletal material in the interior districts where they used 
fresh-water clams liberally. In contrast with this, in those areas where 
they were largely dependent on plant foods and small animals, the skele- eer 
DIEZ NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
tal material was fragile and tooth decay often had been extensive. A 
striking difference in skeletal quality was found. Whereas the skeletons 
of both men and women were in a state of complete preservation and 
physical perfection, with little or no caries where sea foods were eaten, 
/ those in the interior districts showed a marked difference in quality of the 
skeletons of adult women and adult men. This was illustrated by skele￾tons which show what is presumed to be a husband and wife buried to￾gether. While his skeleton is well preserved and its structure excellent, 
most of her teeth had been lost and her bones were of much poorer struc￾ture. This may have been due to the overload of pregnancies. This con￾dition did not occur where sea foods were used liberally. 
There is a marked tendency in modern civilization to substitute syn￾thetic products for Nature’s foods. This has been particularly true of 
vitamins. While these tendencies are fortunate so far as Nature’s require￾ments can be duplicated, the limited knowledge regarding the number 
_and kind of activators and their individual roles in conjunction with 
‘other necessary activating substances and body building minerals has 
resulted in serious injuries and some unfortunate misapprehensions. For 
example, it has been assumed that so-called vitamin D as viosterol in￾cluded much that is required for the control of mineral utilization, par￾ticularly calcium and phosphorus. 
Since the reduction in skeletal growth constituted the most easily ob￾served deficiency in nutritional interference in infancy as expressed in 
rickets, the growth process was assumed to adequately express Nature’s 
requirements for mineral utilization. It was early found that exposure of 
affected infants to ultraviolet light, either from sunlight or from an arti￾cial source, and the use of materials that had been exposed to suitable 
radiant energy were comparable procedures, since both were effective in 
preventing rickets. Thus, the activation by irradiation of ergosterol 
marketed as viosterol or calciferol was supposed to accomplish all that 
was needed for reinforcing the body enough to maintain normal mineral 
utilization. A patent was granted covering the entire process of activating 
drugs and food substances by irradiation. Notwithstanding the fact that 
I was one of the first, by some considered the first, to report this process, 
I have never interpreted my data as indicating that irradiation of ergos￾terol satisfies Nature’s requirements. In the first volume of my work on 
“Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic,” published in 1923, page 342, 
I presented a preliminary report, in a chapter on irradiation. Later, in 
a paper read before the National Academy of Sciences at Washington, 
cluding the activation of cholesterol by this means. — 
NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS FOR RACE REGENERATION — 513 
For nearly two decades, the product activated ergosterol has been ac￾cepted as meeting Nature’s requirements for mineralization as expressed 
by a need for vitamin D. Recent studies, however, have shown that 
Nature’s product is not activated ergosterol, now known as vitamin D», 
but activated cholesterol, now known as vitaman D*. During the years 
in which activated ergosterol has been used extensively to aid in mineral 
utilization, many clinical reports have indicated marked inadequacy as 
_ expressed by clinical results. Dr. Brehm, for example, has reported that 
a very large percentage of infants born to mothers that had received acti￾vated ergosterol and minerals in tablet form during the gestation period 
were abnormal at birth, showing such conditions as stone in the kidney 
and abnormal closure of the sutures of the skull and the fontanel at 
birth. Calcified islands were also found in the placentae. Several reports 
have appeared of infants dying soon after birth with gross calcification, 
including involvement of the coronary artery and myocardium and ar￾teries of other parts of the body. 
With the newer knowledge of the determining role of nutrition in the 
development of degenerative diseases, which, according to the data pre￾viously quoted, now cause 60 per cent of deaths, it is evident that, in 
many cases, conditions which do not cause death are primarily vitamin 
deficiency, including dental caries. The new role of nutritional control 
for disease prevention challenges the attention of the various groups en￾gaged in public health service. Almost weekly, reports appear of ad￾ditional findings throwing light on the contributing factors in heretofore 
obscure nutritional diseases. 
An important illustration is a report in Science News Letter for Aug￾ust 2, 1941, presented under “Medicine” with the following headline: 
“Cancer Growth Prevented in Mice by Yeast and Vitamins; Vitamins 
Alone Had Little Effect, but Riboflavin and Pantothenic Acid with Yeast 
Succeeded with 62%.” 
These advances in knowledge emphasize the necessity that a change 
be made from relief of the symptoms of these degenerative diseases by 
surgery and repair to measures that are adequately conceived and applied 
for their prevention. While I am not suggesting that a cure for malign￾ancy has been found, data available from several sources indicate that 
this and other serious disturbances of the digestive tract and associated 
organs are directly related to nutritional deficiency. In my contacts with 
government hospitals and medical missions that had been established 
among primitive races, these diseases were reported to be rarely found 
among the strictly primitive groups, but to be found in the same stock 514 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
after they were modernized. Two things are strongly emphasized: the 
imperative need for substituting prevention for repair, and the need for 
programs for teaching the public regarding means for prevention. 
This at once raises an important question: By what means will the 
public be informed and who will be their teachers? A report of the sur￾vey of the American Dietetic Association made of schools teaching nutri￾tion indicates that of seventy-six medical schools reporting, only twenty 
had seperate courses on nutrition, and of thirty-nine dental schools re￾porting, only fifteen had seperate courses on nutrition. This survey was 
made in 1939. On the basis, it would seem that we have an explanation 
for much of the confusion in the minds of the members of the dental and 
medical professions in this matter of preventive medicine, including den￾tistry, through nutritional means. 
One of the most serious of the present confusions is failure to appre￾ciate that an adquate, well-balanced diet is capable of building people 
strong and well in all respects and adquate for maintaining health and 
strength. This is the right of all mankind and their sacred birthright. The 
primitive races have demonstrated a score of different nutritional form￾ulas, any and all of which will accomplish this. These, when reduced to 
to their bases, are chemically equivalent. The primitives’ methods of liv￾ing give them excellent appetites, enabling them to provide a good factor 
of safety for the essential minerals and vitamins. While they do not un￾derstand the chemical nature of the needed foods, they know and teach 
the use of the special foods that are needed for providing normal devel￾opment and continous health of the various organs and tisues of the 
body. The Chinese, for example, in a treatise written 1,600 years ago, 
listed more than sixty foods that were good for the eyes, more than 
twenty of which we now know to be very high in vitamin A, an essential 
for the development and the function of the eyes. 
My investigations have included, when visiting these tribes, the gath￾ering of samples of foods utilized by them. These were carried or sent to 
my laboratory for chemical analysis. Clinical investigations also were 
made in which individuals who had lost their imunity to dental caries in 
our modern highly susceptible groups were provided special dietaries 
which were modified to make them as nearly as possible equivalent in 
minerals and vitamins to the efficient primitive dietaries. The result of 
doing so not only has prevented the development of dental caries, when 
caries is the problem involved, in practically all cooperating individuals 
but has controlled it where active in over ninety per cent of the indi- viduals so studied. Chapter 28 
SOCIAL REFORMS BY EDUCATION 
REVENTION can be our salvation. Our greatest need, therefore, is 
P to teach the masses by every means possible. This will save millions 
both in lives and money. We can prevent but we cannot cure. Who 
and what will we teach? Fortunately, our experience is enlightening. It 
has been found that grade and high school pupils get the prevention idea 
clearly and naturally. 
The masses must be taught that LIFE IN ITS FULNESS IS MOTHER 
NATURE OBEYED. 
These lessons from Primitive Races are already being used in many 
places. Miss Alfreda Rooke has given me a note with her experiences. 
She says, 
“Nutrition and Physical Degeneration” by Dr. Weston A. Price has 
been used as a text book on three different teaching levels: elementary, 
adult education and teacher training. Each program covered three phases 
of nutrition: 
1. Nutrition and physical degeneration 
2. Inadequate diets due to deficient foods 
3. Adequate nutrition from present day foods. 
The dramatic evidence presented by Dr. Price of the effect of diet on 
growth and development, captivates the interest of students of every 
age level. His description and picturization of the change in primitive 
man. who has lived on the vital foods of his country, after he adopts the 
food habits of the civilized world, proves both startling and thought 
provoking; a stimulating introduction to the teaching of nutrition. 
On the elementary level, a program in nutrition, based on this book 
was developed in the Chula Vista Union School District, San Diego 
County, California, by the supervisor of Physical and Health Education. 
Chula Vista Union Elementary School District, San Diego County, California, J. C. 
Lauderbeck, District Superintendent. Alfreda F. Rooke,, Supervisor of Physical and 
Health Education. 
The foundation for the work in the elementary schools was laid in 
teachers’ meetings and conferences. The Supervisor provided recent books 
515 516 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
on nutrition, pertinent medical and dental reprints, government bulle￾tins, and other available material for teaching fundamentals of nutrition. 
Every other week, in each fifth and sixth grade class, the Supervisor 
presented nutrition material, throughout the district. This brought the 
newer nutrition knowledge to both teachers and pupils. On alternate 
weeks, the classroom teachers correlated the subject with social science 
and other studies. Stories, maps, pictures from such periodicals as the 
National Geographic, as well as interesting objects from various coun￾tries, served to add color and interest. 
To the children, the Supervisor introduced Dr. Price as the dentist who 
locked his door, and set out with his wife, to discover why many people 
in primitive countries had healthy mouths. After they had completed 
their study of the travel pictures from Dr. Price’s book, which were 
shown on class room walls by means of a large projector, they made a 
summary of the things they had learned. From notes, voluntarily taken, 
they drew a comparison between the diet and health of primitive peoples 
and that of civilized peoples. They demonstrated quite plainly they had 
learned, that there is a difference between animal and plant proteins in 
building blocks for the body; that protein is a “grow” food, whereas 
carbohydrate is a “go” food; that animal proteins differ in nutritional 
quality depending on the fertility of the soil where the animals graze; 
that processing of foods destroys heat labile factors that are necessary to 
maintaining normal health. 
At the University of Missouri, the same material and procedure was 
again used in teaching a nutrition unit in Health Education for second￾ary teachers. This was an inter-departmental project, including the De￾partment of Physical Education, in which the course in Health Educa￾tion was given, and the Department of Soils, of the College of Agricul￾ture. 
Department of Physical Education, Miss Mary McKee, Director, Miss Ethel Mit￾chell, instructor in Health Education. 
Department of Soils; Dr. Wm. A. Albrecht, Chairman; Miss Alfreda F. Rooke, 
Graduate Student in Soils and Nutrition. 
Miss Rooke is devoted to helping the next generations of children by 
teaching the new generations of parents-to-be. 
My contacts have included all ages and people of many colors. Chil￾dren are always more receptive than adults. Note the two essays below: 
A grade school boy, aged 9, writes: “From the pictures I see that the 
sugar rationing in the United States is O.K. because people here will start 
using more honey and maple syrup as well as other natural sweets. This 
will do much to improve their health and teeth. I have seen that there SOCIAL REFORMS BY EDUCATION obi 
are 30 insects in the brown flour and none in the white flour so now I 
know that the insects and bugs are smarter than we are and go for the 
whole wheat which is nourishing and do not touch the white flour which 
is not nourishing because the minerals and vitamins are not in it. I learned 
from the pictures that if we want healthy children when we grow up and 
are married, we better learn to eat right now. When we eat right it makes 
our bodies right, it makes our bodies healthy and when we’re married and 
have children they’ll be good and healthy too.” 
This next is a high school girl of sixteen, who heard my thirty-five 
minute talk a week previously. “Good bodies are essential to good minds. 
Healthy bodies are made by proper food. That means enough vitamins 
and minerals. If one’s parents are healthy, you will have a good chance 
to be happy and healthy. If the egg and sperm cells are the best one can 
produce, good bodies will follow. Children should be spaced for several 
reasons. A mother gives so much of her vitamins and essential needs to 
her child that it requires several years to rebuild her body. The youngest 
child is likely to be the one most lacking. The mother gives her best to 
her first child and if she has many children her body elements slowly de￾cline. Yes, the parents should have a good diet before fertilization. A 
healthy egg does not come from sickly or deficient parents. A healthy 
egg results in a healthy child. A good diet would insure good health. The 
source of the criminal person Dr. Price thinks is the parents. A criminal 
is born of dietary deficient parents or parents deficient in other ways. 
Educate the parents and the criminals will disappear. His information 
applies to everyone who will heed it. We, as the future parents should 
realize and take into consideration his information. We know he is right 
because good common sense will tell us the same thing.” 
Similarly the modernized primitives respond readily. The Maori in 
New Zealand are materially benefited and I quote from a previous report 
as follows: 
“An excellent illustration of the application of this principle is pro￾vided by the history of the Maori stock in New Zealand. The skulls of 
the native New Zealanders before the coming of the white race and at 
the time of its arrival showed that only one tooth per thousand teeth had 
been attacked by dental caries. My studies of the modernized Maori re￾vealed that from 30 to 60 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by 
dental caries, or from 400 to 600 per thousand teeth. The present Maori 
dietary is very similar to that of the white of New Zealand. In contrast 
with the original high immunity of the natives to caries, the modern 
whites of New Zealand are credited by their own dentists with having 
the poorest teeth of all groups in the world. 518 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
“The Hukerara Girls School in Napier for native Maori girls had, as 
I have reported, a high incidence of dental caries in the student body 
when I visited the school in 1936. Dr. Tocker has undertaken to improve 
the conditions there by modifying the food selection for this group in 
accordance with a program that I have outlined for him. This included 
a liberal increase of sea foods and seeds as used by the original Maori. 
His report recently made in the New Zealand Dental Journal, indicates 
a reduction in dental caries of 75 per cent since the establishment of the 
program. Another item of importance that he reports relates to a flu 
epidemic in which not one of the girls in this group under the nutri￾tional program contracted the flu, whereas, in the Maori boys’ school in 
the same vicinity, approximately half of the boys developed influenza. 
Similarly, diphtheria, which was epidemic, failed to attack any of the 
girls on this special dietary program.” 
The available data reveal that our greatest need is for better nutrition 
for parents-to-be, particularly mothers. The public must know of the 
relation of pre-natal injury to the vast group of physical, mental and 
moral defectives. For example, Burt of London reports: 
“Of all the psychological causes of crime, the commonest and the 
gravest is usually alleged to be a defective mind.” 
Hickson of Chicago reports, regarding the origin of young delin￾quents: 
“85.8% of our female cases are distinctly feeble-minded, and 
84.5% of boys under arrest are morons.” 
The general idea assumes that delinquent boys can be trained to be nor￾mal. The United States Department of Labor, bulletin 203, states: 
“Out of 621 paroled from five of the best known correctional 
institutions 66% were later arrested and 58% convicted.” 
The economic problem associated with defectives includes both sup￾port and expense of teaching. From Time, June 17th, 1940 we Jearn: 
“Detroit spends $287 a year to educate a subnormal child. $58 
for a smart one.” 
The economic problems involved for education of mentally retarded 
individuals is increasing rapidly in most of the country because of the 
general lowering of nutritional level. Nutritional education is the only 
foundation for individual, national and world peace and must be fos￾tered by state and national organizations. 
Since the greatest asset of a nation is the quality of its citizenship, the 
responsibility of the government includes the prevention of nutritional SOCIAL REFORMS BY EDUCATION 219 
degeneration by making adequate foods available to the masses. For large 
areas of the earth the supply of adequate foods from the land has been 
reduced below the population level. Fortunately, there is a vast store 
house of excellent food still available in the oceans. The polar currents 
which flow from the icecaps are teeming with fish, the waters near the 
icecaps are loaded with high protein food which accumulates there by 
subocean currents. The temperature of the water adjoining the polar ice￾caps is four degrees below freezing, at which temperature bacterial break￾down does not occur. This provides a huge storage of nutrition for ani￾mal life by way of algae. These feed the myriad crops of first small, then 
larger and larger animal forms until we come to the billions of seals, 
whales, seacows, walrus and sea lions. These together consume more fish, 
the world’s best food, than the entire human population could consume. 
Some civilizations in the past, like the cultures along the coast of Peru, 
tapped this great reservoir. Today’s cultures there disregard it. ; BS 4

ARE TWO OF OUR MAJOR DILEMMAS SOLVED? 
\ J HAT produces our so called bad boys and girls, and why? 
This concerns every thoughtful citizen and all parents. 
Only two forces have been considered as capable of producing both 
our juvenile delinquents and the increasing population of so called 
mentally retarded individuals who drive both our parents and our 
teachers to despair, since they are blamed. Heredity and environment 
have been the only forces understood to be associated with birth and 
childhood. The mystery of where we came from and how, have been 
but vaguely understood and for most of us a carefully closed and almost 
sealed book, through ignorance and prejudice. Our environment is sim￾ple and is always presided over, presumably by parents, hence they must 
be to blame for their children’s behavior. Our California law now im￾plies their blame by recording that whenever a juvenile offender, boy or 
gitl is reported, the parents must be hailed into court to explain why. 
The present increase is explained by the fact that both parents are now 
employed in war work, statistical data however easily refute this since 
in only about 4% of the cases, are both parents so employed. The origin 
of this law may have been inspired by conviction that since heredity is 
a perfect process of divine origin its processes are beyond human knowl￾edge and indeed are not proper and appropriate topics for Christians to 
consider. This is strongly demonstrated by the opposition to any inter￾ference with unregulated childbirth. 
In this situation both juvenile delinquents and mentally retarded in￾dividuals have increased decade after decade all over the country. This 
increase has been much greater in some districts than in others which in￾cidentally gives us a clue. Another factor has been recorded in which 
certain physical divergencies from normal, tend to be found present in 
the delinquent, regardless of where born. 
521 522 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
These two sources of influence, inheritance and environment, have 
been the limit of consideration or knowledge. The fact of similarity, re￾gardless of birth place, has led me to investigate primitive races in vari￾ous parts of the world, to learn whether humans there have indicated 
any other wisdom than that which we possess. Since many a long buried 
skeleton shows superfine bone formation, they apparently had good 
physical form. I have accordingly gone to many remnants of old civiliza￾tions to find the reasons and fortunately so, for I have found that the 
more perfect group physically, are duplicates of our best form and their 
defectives are duplicates of our imperfect moderns. This latter group 
however, is their group of modernized individuals who have been 
touched and changed by contact with our modern commerce. We made 
them with our demineralized and vitamin free foods. 
Even heredity with all its complicated nature, while in a sense im￾mortal is itself purely physical and composed of units of proteins, min￾erals and vitamins called genes and in the transfer from one generation 
to the next must be rebuilt by the special sex cells of the parents and 
only by complete rebuilding can perfect hereditary traits, physical and 
physiological, be expressed as personality and character. These modern￾ized primitives produced typical juvenile delinquents with abnormal per￾sonalities and the associated physical defects of our modern defectives. 
Their undoing is not caused by heredity but is intercepted heredity. Yes, 
their parents produced them but they are not the product of their exter￾nal environment. They are cripples produced at the time of conception, 
their defects can never be cured, but, with proper education and parental 
nutrition they could have been prevented. Nature has been making nor￾mal birds, butterflies and animals for millions of years. If wild animals 
can do it why cannot we? Is it because they, by their instinct, select the 
right foods and do not meddle with nature’s foods by changing them? 
A part of the bird and animal at birth is its education or instinct, for it 
knows how to build a home and how to select its food. They are pro￾tected by their ignorance, including a natural absence of a profit motive. 
In my recording of these studies of primitive races I have made thou￾sands of photographs which show the constant similarity of given de￾fects in all humans and animals in which many changes in shape of the ARE TWO OF OUR MAJOR DILEMMAS SOLVED? 325 
head and structure of the body are shown. These also demonstrate that 
it is not normal heredity since the next generation is not affected when￾ever the defective parent had the proper food. This is the burden of

reprinted and enlarged. 
It is very significant as I have shown that the Rockefeller Founda￾tion has, in May of this year, made a grant of $282,000 to the Jackson 
Memorial Laboratories, at Bar Harbor, Maine, for the study of what 
goes on in genes in normal and disturbed hereditary processes. The di￾rector, Dr. C. C. Little, in announcing the grant, made the following 
statement: “. . . It has become evident that neither heredity nor environ￾ment could go far without the other. 
“If for example, the tiny concentrated centers of chemical organiza￾tion known as genes—the basic unit of heredity, had no living organism 
provided by food and growth on which and in which to express their 
directive powers, they would be incapable of description, measurement 
or identification.” Dr. Little is one of the world’s leading students of 
the problems associated with the complicated structure of the genes, 
which must carry to the new generation the parental characteristics. 
Dr. Ernest A. Hooton, who has written the foreword to this book, 
has closed with the following statement: “So I consider that Dr. Price 
has written what is often called ‘a profoundly significant book.’ The 
principal difference between Dr. Price’s work and many others so la￾beled is that in the present instance the designation appears to be cor￾rect. I salute Dr. Price with the sincerest admiration (the kind that is 
tinged with envy) because he has found out something which I should 
have liked to have discovered for myself.” 
We can all see, as in my many illustrations from primitive races and 
from animals, this problem of physical degeneration expressing itself in 
the younger members of the family, indicating that the parents were 
running out of something. Even the personality may show it, if they are 
more backward than the first born child and if they are more than ten 
years of age, look for narrow nostrils, crooked teeth or narrow hips. 
Nature does the best she can with the available material. Twenty-five 
percent of our modern babies are not perfect enough to have a live birth, 524 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
and thirty-seven percent of those born alive are either dead or have be￾come a burden on society in fifteen years. 
Our immediate need is for means to prevent the building of defec￾tives which is primarily a matter of education of parents to be, long 
before the problems arise. This is the method used by many of the 
primitive races that I have studied. It does not involve parading sex 
problems but simply telling the story of biology to both grade and high 
school pupils, which now is being done very successfully. An adequate 
nutritional program will indicate in detail both the nature of the defects 
produced by faulty foods, in each the individuals themselves and in their 
offspring. The needed better foods for both are indicated. It is signifi￾cant that the proper foods have been found available in all the countries 
where primitive races have succeeded, very often however, certain foods, 
recognized as necessary, were carried long distances. 
With adequate teaching we can save millions both in money and in 
lives besides building a living, instead of, a dying civilization. 
WHO WAS MY MOTHER? Was it that sweet soul who conceived 
me and gave me a physical birth? The land of my birth first claimed me 
and provided food and shelter; the church where my father was so ac￾tive, sponsored controlling tenets for guiding my young and wavering 
feet. Or is there a force back of all these that is parent to them all? As 
I go to remnants of ancient cultures I find that, though differing in color 
and size, they are all true to type and all disclose the same constant rela￾tion to variations in physical form and behaviour and share these varia￾tions with all the animal forms of their district. They all fit into an 
endless scheme revealing interrelationships exceeding the most varied 
assortment of known vital forms. They include all the geologic strata 
of the epochs through which this earth has passed and hence must be 
related to its very structure. Living forms have been adapted to the 
changing physical environments. Earnest students of living cultures find 
them each sympathetic to some controlling motive. Ernest Thompson 
Seton, an earnest student of the American Indian, summarizes the In￾dians’ motive as being 
“fundamentally spiritual, his measure of success is, ‘How much service have I rendered to my people?” ARE TWO OF OUR MAJOR DILEMMAS SOLVED? By) 
Dr. M. F. Ashley-Montagu, distinguished anatomist and anthropol￾ogist, in discussing the motive of the Australian Aborigine and the aver￾age Eskimo, states: 
“We are very definitely their inferiors. We lisp noble ideals and noble sen￾timents—the Australians and Eskimos practice them—they neither write 
books nor lecture about them. Theirs are the only true democracies where 
every individual finds his happiness in catering to the happiness of the 
group, and where any one who in any way threatens the welfare of the 
group is dealt with as an abnormality.” 
Similarly the many creeds of today have differing points of emphasis, 
though with many qualities in common. The association of the concept 
of humans often carry over to chemicals of which they are made, giving 
them almost parental relationships. Thus heavy elements break down 
slowly into slightly lighter elements, but always according to atomic 
weight of the elements and in doing so, give off radiant energy as in 
the splitting of uranium and production of radium. It is common prac￾tice today in biological laboratories to start the breakdown of a sub￾stance, for example phosphorus, by making it radio-active, by exposure 
to neutrons, negatively charged particles, and thus making it capable of 
recording its position photographically in its passage through animal 
tissues. In 1900 I reported in Paris the use of Roentgen rays for making 
shiagrams of bone specimens, and in 1922 I reported at the Mayo In￾stitute, Rochester, Minn., on the ability of foetal tissues to collect irrida￾tion from the circulating blood. I injected a solution of radio-active salt 
into the leg of a living guinea-pig and made records of the changing 
location by photographing through black paper. At first the plate was 
darkened only opposite the leg. An hour later the entire body gave off 
diffuse radiation and in another hour the radiant energy was accumu￾lated in the unborn foetus. The embryo was removed and covered with 
black paper and its photograph shows a halo about it in the resulting 
illustration. Many viruses are now grown in embryonic tissues, for ex￾ample the viruses of our common colds are grown in unhatched chicken 
eggs, these viruses are ultra-microscopic, like the building blocks in the 
parental tissue of genes. 
These genes, which carry all the physical characters in heredity, are 
so small that their entire mass for providing the blue-print for an ele- 526 NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL DEGENERATION 
phant is so small that only the highest magnification of the best micro￾scopes are able to reveal them. They are the parental transfer of life in 
all its details. A pollen floating invisibly in the air far above the earth, 
is a seed, capable of producing a plant, or a chemical reaction in our 
bodies as hay fever, yet it is invisible. Such invisibly small structures are 
the carriers of life in all its forms. We are familiar with slow oxidation 
producing body warmth and with rapid oxidation as in the open fire. 
Similarly, atomic energy is expended slowly in nature in all living forms 
and its prodigious energy as heat and light. The carriers of hereditary 
factors call for force prodigious in small units comparable to, if not 
identical with atomic energy. 
We can now visualize our universe, its light, gravity and heat, its 
seasons, tides and harvest, which perpare a habitation for the universe 
of vital forms, microscopic and majestic, which fill the oceans and the 
forests. We have a common denominator for universes within and 
around each other, our world, our food and our life have potentials so 
vast that we can only observe directions, not goals. We sense human 
achievements or ignominous race self-destruction. Every creed today 
vaguely seeks a utopia; all have visualized a common controlling force 
or diety as the most potent force in all human affairs. Yes, man’s place 
is most exalted when he obeys his mother nature’s laws. 
Neither heredity nor environment alone cause our juvenile delin￾quents and mental defectives. They are cripples, physically, mentally and 
morally, which could have and should have been prevented by adequate 
education and by adequate parental nutrition. Their protoplasm was 
not normally organized. 
This atomic energy which may be liberated in large amounts as light 
and heat from the sun or in small amounts from decaying elements in 
nature at varying rates, builds all the foods by its reactions in living 
plants. It thus provides the plant and animal protoplasms which gives 
them life. Needham, from whom I have quoted, Chapter 25 emphasizes 
protoplasm as the first of the four units of the living world. He says: 
“In all living creatures there is one common substance, protoplasm, the 
physical basis of life, the only known living substance. It is a semi-fluid 
substance, transparent, well nigh structureless, and apparently inert, yet pos- ARE TWO OF OUR MAJOR DILEMMAS SOLVED? 527 
sessing the unique powers that distinguish living from non-living things, 
the powers of growth and reproduction. 
‘The living substance throughout is protoplasm; seemingly one substance, 
alike in all, and yet in the course of its onflow, marvelously dispensing to 
every individual some mark of his own that no other individual in all the 
world possesses. Protoplasm organizes itself in cells, its working units; and 
behind the cells that build our bodies, that do the work of our bodies and of 
our minds, is the great mystery of life itself—the driving power of an un￾explained control that shapes the course of self development in the individ￾ual, and carries on by cell lineage through successive generations.” 
This driving power must have qualities like this universal but ob￾Scure atomic energy. 
We now see new and greatly enlarged meaning in each Activator 
the various hormones and the vitamins. We learn how they have 
changed many prospective mothers and their babies as illustrated on 
page 408. 
There has been intelligent purpose in the strange practices of many 
of the primitive races. Those terraced gardens in the high Andes and 
Himalaya mountains are evidence of the struggle toward a better radi￾ated atmosphere, by those superbly built Incas and Hunzas who con￾structed them. They beautifully reveal cause and effect. 
All human growth demands this struggle towards these sources of 
life produced by atomic energy.
