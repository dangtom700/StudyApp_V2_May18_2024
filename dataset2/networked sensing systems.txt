Preface
With today’s improvements in wireless and mobile connectivity, Internet 
of Things (IoT) sensor technologies, and digital innovation, sustainabil￾ity principles have started to reinforce one another. To switch to more 
resource-efficient solutions, use resources responsibly, and streamline 
operations, businesses must embrace digital transformation. Energy man￾agement, air pollution monitoring, fleet management, water manage￾ment, and agriculture are a few examples of potential actuation sectors. 
Simultaneously, the expansion of IoT deployments and their integration 
into the contexts of 5G and upcoming 6G mobile networking necessitate 
that the solutions themselves be green and sustainable, incorporating, for 
instance, the use of energy- and environmentally-aware technical solutions 
for communications. 
By offering previously unattainable solutions, networking can contrib￾ute to a more sustainable society by enabling the collection of data from 
new and heterogeneous sources in unique ways and from novel sources 
using novel technology. In addition, the networking-based solution itself 
needs to be sustainable or environmentally friendly. For instance, changing 
the network architecture and moving network equipment to key locations 
can reduce wasteful energy use. These goals drive the search for solu￾tions, which range from “better” and novel sensing objects that need to be 
energy-efficient using mobile sensing devices.
The goal of “Networked Sensing Systems” is to present and highlight the 
most recent developments in sustainable networked sensing systems in a 
variety of contexts with the common goal of enhancing human well-being 
and halting climate change. Regardless of their area of expertise, the objec￾tive is to offer workable solutions that meet the major problems and diffi￾culties in building a sustainable smart society 5.0. This book will serve as a 
potential platform to discuss networked sensing systems for a sustainable 
society, namely systems and applications based on mobile computers and 
wireless networks, while taking into account multidisciplinary approaches 
that emphasise the human element in resolving these difficulties.

Abstract
Network Sensing System in Society 5.0 provides unprecedented connectivity 
and data-driven solutions to numerous societal problems. But they also raise 
many questions and problems that need to be resolved to ensure they are used 
effectively and fairly. This content explores the key issues and challenges of the 
Society 5.0 community. Since sensors collect and transmit a lot of data contin￾uously, data privacy and security become an important issue. Strong protection 
and encryption are required to prevent data from leakage, unauthorized access, 
and misuse. The integration and data sharing of many sensors and protocols 
depend on the interoperability and standardization of the sensor. So, the systems 
can be made more scalable and efficient using different structures and procedures. 
Transparency, impartiality, and fairness are among some of the ethical concerns 
under data analysis and algorithmic decision making. So, it is necessary to take 
necessary actions to ensure fair results and get rid of biases to maintain trust and 
prevent bad outcomes. Network Detection System 5.0 focuses on reliable power 
plans and strong communication methods; therefore, infrastructure flexibility 
and dependability are very important. Such vulnerabilities in the systems might 
have the potential to cause disturbances and may interfere with vital activities. 
Hence, it is necessary to invest in redundancy and resilience in infrastructure. 
Energy and safety are important issues due to the environmental impact of sensors 
and data processing. Energy-efficient solutions and renewable energy sources can 
reduce these impacts and promote sustainability. The development of tech￾nology, policy, and business management creates uncertainty about responsibility 
and control. Guidelines and policies should be developed to address legal, ethical, 
and social issues while promoting innovation and community service. Public

1.1 What is Society 5.0?
Society 5.0 represents an enormous evolution in how data are accumu￾lated, processed, and implemented to enhance various components 
of human existence [1–3]. While the idea of making use of statistics to 
improve efficiency and comfort is not always new, Society 5.0 distinguishes 
itself by means of expanding the scope of application throughout society 
in an incorporated manner. Unlike previous iterations, wherein comput￾erized structures operated within specific domain names, like temperature 
control or transportation, Society 5.0 envisions a complete technique to 
optimizing all aspects of lifestyles.
The key distinction lies in the basic integration of structures to ensure 
happiness and safety in various sectors as well as strength, transportation, 
healthcare, buying, training, employment, amusement, and so forth. In 
Society 5.0, the focus shifts from isolated solutions to interconnected struc￾tures that work together seamlessly. This community allows the gathering 
of numerous certain real-world facts that are then processed by means of 
AI and other state-of the-art IT structures. What sets Society 5.0 apart 
is the ability to use these vast amounts of data to directly shape human 
behavior and actions resulting in a more fulfilling and richer lifestyle 
Unlike previous models where data guide only individual policies, Society 
5.0 influences social behavior at a broad scale. Essentially, Society 5.0 cre￾ates an iterative cycle of constantly collecting, analyzing, and transform￾ing data into meaningful insights that improve tangible real-world results 
This cycle works across society and ensures that the benefits of data-driven 
decision making extend to all aspects of human life. As we dive deeper into 
the discussion, it is clear that Citizenship 5.0 represents a significant step 
forward in social improvement and embodies a future where data-driven 
insights pave the way for a happier, more comfortable society promising 
sustainability.

1.1.1 Advancements in Society 5.0 Over Society 4.0
Society 5.0 represents a significant advancement over Society 4.0 address￾ing various issues and challenges while offering significant improvements 
in several key areas. Let us see how Society 5.0 is superior to its predecessor 
and overcomes the limitations faced in Society 4.0 depicted in Figure 1.1.
1.1.2 Integration and Interconnectivity
Using Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things, Society 4.0 intro￾duced the idea of connection between machines. However, those systems 
were mostly functioning in isolation, which resulted in dispersed data and 
ineffective system-to-device connection. Also, it had a vast communication 
gap between the interconnected devices. Society 5.0, forces integration and 
relationships between different entities. It made it easier for systems and 
domains to work jointly and communicate with one another promoting 
complete optimization and combined interactions.

1.1.3 Data Utilization and Analysis
Although Society 4.0 placed a force or intensity of expression that gives 
impressiveness or importance to something on connection and data col￾lecting, it had created some trouble with the in-efficient use and analysis of 
the large volumes of data. The extraction of significant insights was ham￾pered by no longer used or useful analytical methodologies and limited 
processing capabilities. Society 5.0 leverages advanced technologies like 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data analytics to unlock the full poten￾tial of data. It employs sophisticated algorithms to analyze complex data￾sets in real time extracting actionable insights to drive decision making 
and innovation.
1.1.4 Personalization and Customization
Based on the user’s preferences and actions, Society 4.0 introduced cus￾tomized experiences and services. However, these efforts have largely failed 
due to a lack of awareness of unique needs and preferences. By exploiting 
complicated AI algorithms to analyze a wealth of information about unique 
interests, behaviors and situations, Society 5.0 elevates personalization to a 
new level. This can provide highly customized and flexible experiences in 
various sectors such as retail, healthcare, and education.
1.1.5 Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Society 4.0 [4] largely ignores the problem of sustainability and ethics by 
prioritizing economic expansion and technological development. Rapid 
technological progress has worsened social inequality and destroyed the 
environment. Society 5.0 involves a balanced and holistic policy approach, 
with a strong emphasis on social responsibility, ethics, and the environ￾ment. It seeks to use technology for the greater good in addition to pro￾moting equity, environmental protection, and ethical decision making 
at all levels of life with greater integration, improved data management, 
customized experiences, navigation, ethical considerations, and human￾centered design. Society 5.0 has a huge step up from Society 4.0.
1.1.6 Human-Centric Design and Empowerment
Automation and digitization [5, 6] were brought about by Society 4.0 
[4], while it was criticized for putting efficiency and productivity above 
the empowerment and welfare of people. Workers often believed that

methods pushed by technology were forcing them out or excluding them. 
Humanizing design and empowerment are given the most importance in 
Society 5.0 in Figure 1.2 ensuring that technology advances, rather than 
eclipses, mankind. To increase creativity, productivity, and well-being, it 
promotes the growth of human potential using technology and promotes 
cooperation between people and machines.
1.2 Network Sensing Systems in Society 5.0
Society 5.0 is characterized by extensive integration, advanced data testing, 
reputation stability, and the concept of web sentiment processing as the 
core represents a well-designed basic system, and it is a real analysis of 
high sensitivity and elevation analysis. Monitoring world events, analyt￾ics, trends and in real time, networked sensing systems play a key role in 
enabling seamless and streamlined integration of various social services 
from transportation and healthcare to energy management and urban 
planning through community development.
Data-driven decision-making principle [7] is a foundation of sensing 
systems based on networks, where data from IoT devices, sensors, and 
social media platforms are collected in real time from diverse sources. This 
information stream offers invaluable insights into the complex nature of 
the dynamics of the society and allows the stakeholders to make smart 
decisions about how to prevent the emerging problems and take advantage

of the opportunities. Through application of advanced data analytics meth￾ods, including machine learning and predictive modeling, network sensing 
systems can obtain actionable information from the data, and this infor￾mation can then be applied to activities such as predictive maintenance, 
resource optimization, and risk management.
In addition to that, network sensing system in Society 5.0 also promotes 
creative and user-friendly design and public participation resulting in 
technological developments that serve people’s needs and goals. Because 
of increase in openness, involvement, and democratic governing bodies, 
these systems have encouraged civilians to be the designers of their urban 
environments, health services, and transportation systems. Citizen feed￾back mechanisms and mutually beneficial decision-making platforms in 
network sensing systems increase stakeholder participation promoting 
citizen contact and giving them chance to participate in decision-making 
processes. Moreover, network sensing system in Society 5.0 do follow 
some ethical and sustainable principles by trying to protect privacy and 
data security to promote social fairness and reduce negative effect on the 
environment. These systems use smart meters, sensors for monitoring 
the environment, and renewable energy technologies to make it simpler 
to use resources more efficiently, reduce carbon production, and promote 
environment-friendly behavior. Furthermore, moral standards, encryp￾tion technologies, and data privacy rules assure private data security while 
maintaining public trust in the digital economy.
1.3 Issues and Challenges
1.3.1 Data Privacy and Security
Modeled upon a data-driven society [8], Society 5.0 stresses the concept of 
data-driven decision making and its capacity to impact growth in society. 
This viewpoint deviates from the traditional comprehension of the media 
by prioritizing data in the advancement of societal development. In the 
context of Society 5.0, data are more than just processed information; it 
also serves as a catalyst for practical findings that inspire transformative 
change in a wide range of sectors. The core data-driven society in Society 
5.0 is enshrined in the Japanese government’s “Development Plan 2018,” 
where two terms explicitly reflect the data-driven society, as described 
in official documents in the field of computer physical systems (CPS) [9] 
and the Internet of Things (IoT) [10], which harnesses the power to digi￾tize networks in various industrial sectors. This digitization facilitates the

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseNetwork Sensing in Society 5.0 7
collection of vast amounts of data, which is then transformed into action￾able intelligence and applied to real-world situations into, thereby increas￾ing the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making processes.
The evolution of how data affects the real world of Society 5.0 is mul￾tifaceted. First, data indirectly influence social outcomes through human 
decision-making processes. For example, traditional approaches to urban 
planning have limited data sources which prevents the accuracy of the 
decision making process, but in a data-driven society [26], real-time data 
from multiple sources resides that smartphones, CCTV cameras, and 
transport cards provide a comprehensive understanding of cities dynam￾ics empower stakeholders to make informed decisions, and thus the pub￾lic fabric. Second, the public use of data in Society 5.0 is characterized by 
the direct impact of data through automated processes. For example, the 
complexity of adapting traffic signals to different needs for traffic manage￾ment is beyond human capacity. In response, AI-controlled systems [11] 
use continuous input data to iteratively adjust control algorithms inde￾pendently adapting to changing conditions and traffic. This paradigm shift 
from human- to AI-controlled systems model data as the primary driver of 
social work in Society 5.0.
More specifically, Society 5.0 indicates an evolution of paradigms toward 
a data-driven society in which data go beyond its usual use as information 
to become an essential part of social progress. By using data, Society 5.0 
aims to improve efficiency, encourage innovation across a range of indus￾tries, and affect decision-making processes, for example. Data have a 
crucial role in deciding the future of society, as shown by the revolutionary 
potential of data-driven techniques, which use innovations in traffic man￾agement and urban planning as examples.
1.3.2 Importance of Privacy and Security
Operational approach of Society 5.0 revolves around the use of data to 
drive out societal progress; a huge responsibility is devolved to data pri￾vacy and security [12–14]. These two fundamental elements are very 
indispensable for sustaining data management integrity and for ethical 
application of the data. With the data increasingly decisive in the making 
decisions and also transforming societies, a major concern that should 
be taken care of is the confidentiality of the data and the privacy of an 
individuals’ information.
Surveillance of the information is the basis for the reliability and 
credibility of the stakeholders, which should be based on data privacy 
and also security. Through the application of well-defined regulations 
 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by ibrahim ragab - Oregon Health & Science Univer , Wiley Online Library on [09/02/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License8 Networked Sensing Systems
and protocols, organizations not only mitigate many legal risks but also 
create a platform that allows them to publicize the data and innovate. 
Obedience with the legal frameworks as GDPR and also CCPA is very 
critical reflecting the accountable control of the ethical data and also 
responsibility.
Strong security mechanisms [24], including encryption and access con￾trol, ensure the checking on the possible threats, such as data breaches and 
also unauthorized access. This preventive approach reduces the chance of 
misuse and enhances the secure handling of the data across the whole dig￾ital territory. Ethical considerations assume the first place in the direct￾ing of the data use in proper ways. Maintaining the privacy rights of the 
individuals and ensuring equality of the access to data are ethically very 
important components of the stewardship, which both promote openness 
and accountability within the data-driven environment.
Furthermore, the safeguard of data confidentiality and privacy will 
provide a secure platform for the development of innovation in the social 
structure of Society 5.0. Through such way of confining research and 
experiments on the data, organizations, in turn, will be able to continue 
innovating, and the technology will keep on being improved while pro￾tecting their intellectual property rights, and also assuring data integrity. 
In fact, data privacy and also security are not luxury building blocks of 
humanization in Society 5.0. At every stage of use, there is integration of 
these living organisms into data-driven decision-making processes, which 
guarantees just and responsible utilization of data to promote innovation 
and drive social change.
1.4 Encryption and Decryption Techniques: 
Safeguarding Data Integrity
Encryption and decryption methods are essential for guaranteeing the 
security, confidentiality, and integrity of sensitive data in the era of Society 
5.0, when data are the essential resource for society. By making data illeg￾ible for unauthorized users and reducing the likelihood of unlawful access 
and exploitation, these techniques serve as the cornerstone of data protec￾tion initiatives. Let us explore the complexities of encryption and how it is 
decrypted in the context of Society 5.0. In Society 5.0 ecosystems, encryp￾tion is the first line of defense for data security [12]. Different encryption 
techniques are used to convert plaintext data into cipher text. Symmetric 
 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by ibrahim ragab - Oregon Health & Science Univer , Wiley Online Library on [09/02/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseNetwork Sensing in Society 5.0 9
Encryption is the method that encrypts and decrypts data using the same 
key. One of the most straightforward symmetric encryption [15] meth￾ods is the Caesar Cipher [16], which is also one of the simplest to break. 
Many additional symmetric encryption [15] methods have since been 
developed by cryptologists, including some that are currently in use to 
encrypt data like passwords. Asymmetric Encryption [17], also referred 
to as public-key cryptography, is a type of data encryption in which the 
matching decryption key, also known as the private key, and the encryp￾tion key, also known as the public key, are distinct. Only the matching pri￾vate key can be used to decrypt an exchange that has been encrypted using 
the public key. In Society 5.0 contexts, key exchange techniques and secure 
communication channels are made available by algorithms like Elliptic 
Curve Cryptography [18] (ECC) and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) [19]. 
Homomorphic Encryption [20] is an enhanced technique for encryption 
that preserves data privacy and encourages data analysis and interaction 
by enabling computations to be done on encrypted data without the need 
for decryption.
1.4.1 Decryption Technology
Decryption is the process of restoring encrypted text information to its 
original text allowing users to securely access encrypted information. Key 
technical points include the following:
Key Management: Effective management of encryption keys is crucial 
for a secure decryption process. Key management systems, including key 
identification, storage, rotation and destruction, ensure the confidentiality 
and integrity of encryption keys [19] in a community 5.0 environment.
Authentication: Verifying the user’s identity and providing appropriate 
decryption authority are crucial to ensuring data security. Multi-factor 
authentication (MFA) [21] and biometric authentication [21] methods 
increase the security of the decryption process and reduce the risk of unau￾thorized access.
Decryption Algorithm: Using an industry-standard decryption algorithm 
corresponding to the encryption method used is crucial for successful 
data decryption. The organization uses advanced decryption algorithms 
to ensure data integrity and confidentiality throughout the decryption 
process.

1.4.2 Challenges and Decisions
While encryption and decryption technologies provide significant benefits 
in data protection in Society 5.0, some challenges and decisions need to be 
addressed as follows:
Performance: Strong Encryption algorithm will increase performance 
And affects system latency and response capacity. Security measures along 
with performance considerations are necessary for the integration of com￾munication and decryption technologies.
Key Management Complexity: Managing encryption keys across multiple 
systems and platforms can be complex. Implementing a strong key man￾agement and encryption key management solution is critical to managing 
key lifecycles.
Compliance: When using encryption and decryption technologies, data 
protection laws and regulations (such as GDPR and CCPA) [22] must be 
followed. For staying within the law and fulfill regulatory requirements, it 
is really important to make sure that encryption solutions follow the rules 
set by regulators. Encryption and decryption strategies are vital for retain￾ing data integrity and secrecy in Society 5.0. Organizations can shield sen￾sitive records in information-pushed ecosystems by way of using robust 
encryption algorithms, effective key management techniques, and solid 
decryption techniques.
1.4.3 Interoperability Challenges in Society 5.0: A Tripping 
Block on the Road to a Hyperconnected Future
Society 5.0, which promises us of a hyper-connected and intelligent soci￾ety, promises a future in which technology smoothly integrates into all 
aspects of our life. Consider a scenario in which smart cities optimize 
traffic flow, linked homes anticipate our wants, and intelligent healthcare 
systems deliver individualized treatment. However, this utopian vision is 
dependent on a critical factor: compatibility.
1.5 Understanding Interoperability on Society 5.0
Interoperability refers to the capability of various systems and gadgets to 
communicate and trade facts seamlessly. In the context of Society 5.0, this 
interprets to make that fact from diverse sources, including clever sensors, 
wearables, and infrastructure structures, may be simply incorporated and 
 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by ibrahim ragab - Oregon Health & Science Univer , Wiley Online Library on [09/02/2025].

analyzed to allow clever decision making and foster innovation throughout 
numerous domains. However, reaching this seamless trade gives numer￾ous challenges that threaten to impede the progress of Society 5.0. Let us 
delve deeper into these demanding situations through a real global state of 
affairs.
1.5.1 The Smart City Dilemma: A Case Study 
in Interoperability Woes
Imagine Alice, a resident of a bustling clever metropolis, experiencing a 
sudden scientific emergency at domestic. Her clever domestic gadget, pre￾pared with several health sensors, detects an anomaly in her vital organs 
and triggers an emergency reaction about this apparently straightfor￾ward situation, but that signal can be disturbed by way of the subsequent 
interoperability hurdles as follows:
Standardization Issues
May be that statistics transmitted using Alice’s clever home machine is 
probably incompatible with the layout used by the emergency reaction 
center’s gadget. This incompatibility creates a conversation barrier delay￾ing the critical alert and potentially impacting the timeliness of scientific 
intervention.
1.5.2 Ensuring Integration and Data Exchange
The achievement of Society 5.0 relies on the potential of diverse structures 
and devices to connect and bypass records correctly. This necessitates over￾coming several interoperability hurdles. Diving deeper into Interoperability 
Issues [25] in Society 5.0 is shown in Figure 1.3.

1.5.3 Standardization Challenges and Solutions
The current landscape is riddled with competing standards across vari￾ous sectors hindering interoperability. For example, the healthcare indus￾try utilizes diverse standards, like HL7 (Health Level Seven) and DICOM 
(Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine), while the automotive 
industry employs CAN (Controller Area Network) and OBU (On-Board 
Unit) standards.
Collaborative Standardization Efforts: Establishing common ground 
requires collaboration between industry players, government agencies, and 
international standardization bodies. Initiatives like the Industrial Internet 
Consortium (IIC) and the Open Web Alliance (OWA) are fostering collab￾oration to develop interoperable standards across different domains.
1.5.4 Heterogeneity Challenges and Solutions
Integration is made extremely challenging by the wide variety of devices 
and systems that are available ranging from cutting-edge AI platforms to 
antiquated infrastructure. Numerous operating systems, communication 
protocols [12], and data formats [26] are often used by these systems.
The answer is to build robust frameworks for interoperability that can 
react to and translate data between different systems. These frameworks 
use techniques, like data virtualization, format translation, and semantic 
mediation [27], to make communication between various components 
easier.
It is also important to invest in processes and technologies to adapt to 
different products and systems in Society 5.0. From semantic interopera￾bility to API-based integration and intermediary platforms, there are many 
ways to bridge communication and facilitate data exchange.
1.6 Importance of Robust Communication and Power 
Plans
With its compelling future vision of highly connected sophisticated tech￾nology, Society 5.0 envisions a society of intelligent automation, data￾driven decision-making systems, and interconnection. This ambitious 
strategy is predicated on the vital cornerstones of robust infrastructure 
and aggressive communication. This essential cornerstone of the contem￾porary world is crucial in facilitating the following:

to complicated, constant structures. Think about construct￾ing furniture with pre-fabricated pieces instead of custom 
carpentry.
1.6.7 Safeguarding the Digital Age: Security and Privacy 
in Infrastructure
Society 5.0 is all about tech making our lives wonderful, but with great 
energy comes fantastic responsibility (i.e., to maintain our records safe). 
The following are the ways to be a privacy pro:
Fort Knox Your Logins: Think of complicated passwords as your digital 
bodyguards. Add some other layer of security with two-component 
authentication, like a code sent to your telephone. It is like having a double 
deadbolt on your on-line money owed.
Patch Up With Defenses: Regularly update the devices and software. These 
updates are like digital patches fixing vulnerabilities that hackers may try 
and exploit.
Be Data Ninja: Not all organizations need your complete life tale. In 
Society 5.0, you could regularly pick to proportion anonymized facts. This 
could help agencies analyze what they need without compromising user 
privacy. It is like sharing book summaries with friends as opposed to 
lending them the entire book.
Know Where Your Data Goes: Before delivering your statistics, under￾stand how it is going to be used. Reputed groups can be transparent about 
statistics practices and come up with manipulation over yours. It is your 
statistics in the end!
By following those recommendations, we will build a Society 5.0 where 
each person feels stable and enjoys the blessings of a generation.

2.1 Introduction
2.1.1 Urban Environment Remote Sensing Overview
Remote sensing is used for the collection of data with the latest technology 
about the Earth without the use of any physical contact. It involves col￾lecting data remotely with the help of sensors placed on spacecraft, satel￾lites, and in other platforms [1]. These sensors capture the electromagnetic 
waves that the Earth’s surface generates. Such radiation can then be gener￾ated and processed to gain the most useful information [2].
2.1.2 Smart Factory
Urban environments have begun to employ remote sensing methods, such 
as satellite images, LiDAR, also known as Light Detection and Ranging, 
and drone photography, to observe and regulate the different aspects of the 
urban settings [3].
Some examples where remote sensing used in cities are listed as follows:
1. Classification of Land Use: Within the metropolitan areas, 
there are different land cover types, like residential, com￾mercial, industrial, park, and agricultural land, which can be 
mapped and then classified with the help of remote sensing 
data [4].
2. Monitoring the Environment: Remote sensing would also 
help to observe the factors like vegetation health of the plant, 
changes in land usage over time, and the quality of air and 
water. The data help to determine how urbanization affects 
the environment and informs sustainable development 
strategies [5].
3. Infrastructure Planning: Comprehensive data about the net￾works of roads, buildings, bridges, and uses are currently in 
place; remote sensing data can do help with infrastructure 
planning such as planning new construction projects, evalu￾ating the infrastructure vulnerabilities, and then streamlin￾ing transportation networks with the gathered data from the 
satellite [6].
4. Disaster Management: By providing correct information and 
precise data about natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, 
wildfires, and landslides, remote sensing plays an import￾ant role in disaster management. The surveys were taken

aerially, and satellite images can be used in the support of 
emergency response efforts and to determine the areas that 
need assistance for the evaluation of any damage [7].
2.1.3 Benefits of Remote Sensing in Cities
• Broad Coverage: The usage of remote sensing technologies 
facilitates the acquisition of data from different geographical 
regions, and it enables the exhaustive observation and exam￾ination of urban environments [8].
• Regular Monitoring: Data will be acquired by satellites and 
remote sensing platforms regularly giving current informa￾tion about the changes that are taking place in urban areas 
over time [9].
• Cost Effectiveness: The need for costly field surveys makes 
it possible to collect data from dangerous or inaccessible 
locations. It is frequently less expensive than the traditional 
ground-based methods of data collection [10].
• Urban planners, legislators, and environmental scientists 
support sustainable urban development and environmental 
management using remote sensing methods to collect valu￾able insights into urban dynamics and make well-informed 
decisions [11].
2.2 Connectivity Challenges in Urban 
Remote Sensing
2.2.1 Conventional Remote Sensing Systems’ 
Technological Limitations
In urban environments, traditional remote sensing systems face techno￾logical challenges because of things like the following:
• Limited Spatial Resolution: It may be difficult for tradi￾tional satellite sensors to distinguish between various land 
cover types or features in urban areas due to their inability 
to capture fine-scale details [12].
• Urban regions are more frequent and humid than the rural 
ones. This will result in the inaccuracy of data that we get 
from remote sensing, and the features get disrupted [13].

• Effects of Shadowing: In urban areas, buildings that are tall 
create shadows that hinder the underlying features making it 
quite difficult to accurately predict an image [14].
• The more dynamic range of remote sensing sensors will pro￾duce high-density data in urban areas with more complex 
geometries that lead to data and saturation loss.
2.2.2 Logistical Obstacles in the Integration and Transmission 
of Data
Logistical obstacles in data integration and transmission in urban remote 
sensing are more significant.
• Limited Access to Urban Environments: Deploying ground￾based sensors or gaining access to specific areas to gather data 
is difficult in urban areas due to the high population [15].
• Limitations of Infrastructure: Due to inadequate infra￾structure, it is difficult to transmit data in real time and to 
integrate remote sensing data with the current urban area. 
Examples of this are the limited internet connection and 
poor electricity supply [16].
• Interoperability of Data: Analyzing and integrating the dif￾ferent datasets are challenging because of data in different 
formats and the varying resolutions [17].
2.2.3 Problems Affect Data Analysis and Quality
The quality and analysis of remote sensing data are affected by issues based 
on connectivity in urban areas as follows:
• Data Loss and Gaps: Data loss or gaps can be created by 
network connectivity outages and signal inference, so the 
accuracy and the completeness of remote sensing datasets 
may be different [18].
• Data Transmission Delays: can limit the timeliness and 
usefulness of remote sensing data for decision making. 
These delays can be caused by slow or unreliable data trans￾mission [19].
• Reduced Temporal and Spatial Coverage: Problems with 
connectivity may limit the temporal and spatial coverage of

analyze urban dynamics thoroughly.
2.2.4 Cutting Edge Technologies to Handle Connectivity Issues
New technologies provide creative ways to address connectivity issues in 
urban remote sensing [20] as follows:
• Satellite technology advancements have resulted in the 
creation of high-resolution satellite constellations that can 
capture detailed imagery of urban areas with enhanced tem￾poral and spatial resolution.
• Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Unlike traditional satel￾lite sensors, UAVs, also known as drones, offer versatile and 
affordable platforms for gathering high-resolution aerial 
imagery and LiDAR data in urban settings.
• Edge Computing and Cloud-Based Solutions: By enabling 
real-time processing and analysis of remote sensing data at 
the point of acquisition, edge computing and cloud-based 
platforms lessen the need for centralized infrastructure and 
increase data accessibility.
• Integration of sensor networks and Internet of Things (IoT) 
devices with remote sensing systems enables smooth data 
transmission and integration allowing for extensive moni￾toring of urban environments in almost real time.
• Urban remote sensing practitioners can overcome connec￾tivity issues and fully utilize remote sensing data for envi￾ronmentally conscious and sustainable urban development 
by utilizing these cutting-edge technologies.

2.4 Case Study
2.4.1 Monitoring Urban Air Quality With IoT Sensors
Overview
The major reason for pollution is air, which affects the health of humans 
and the environmental system. To reliably evaluate the air state and the cost 
in metropolitan areas, conventional techniques for monitoring frequently 
the lack of geographic coverage and granularity are needed. The Internet 
of Things (IoT) plays an important role in economics and reliability, scal￾ability monitoring of the system, and the quality of air in urban areas [26].
A majority of the cities with air pollution problems set up a new tech￾nique for the network of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in different areas 
to track important air quality substances like nitrogen dioxide (NO2
), par￾ticulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2
), carbon monoxide (CO), and 
ozone (O3
) in residential areas and their surroundings, industrial areas and 
the nearby zones, and high-traffic areas. To record the spatial variations in 
the quality of air, different sensors were placed.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License38 Networked Sensing Systems
Gathering and Analyzing Data
A cloud platform or centralized database is used to gather data on air 
quality parameters, such as the air quality index (AQI), for sending real￾time data. The gathered data are processed and verified using new tech￾niques in data analytics techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, 
for finding the hotspots and the pattern of air pollution [27].
Communication and Visualization
To access and understand data, user-friendly platforms, such as interactive 
maps, dashboards of the air level noted, and mobile apps for measuring the 
air quality, are used to visualize and process quality, which makes it easiest 
for stakeholders, like the government, policymakers, general public, and 
agencies. When the quality of air is not healthy or above the threshold, 
residential people and the corresponding authorities may receive real-time 
alarm signals and notifications [28].
Effects and Results
The quality of air in the affected area is estimated by the temporal and the 
spatial variations of air pollution and the number of hotspots to improve, 
based on that the targets and the decision-making information are chosen. 
Behavioral changes and awareness are the objectives of sustainable urban 
development and public health protection.
Conclusion
New technologies, like IOT, have potential with their sensors for moni￾toring of air quality in the urban community, and the value of data in real 
time, analysis of data, and communication for the data are addressed in the 
case study for urban areas and showcases their potential. Cities can take 
steps to protect public health and improve their environmental quality for 
both the current and future generations.
2.4.2 Analyzing Satellite Images for Urban Development 
and Planning

and capacity of storage in cloud computing.
5. Cost-Effective Solutions: When using the new emerging 
technologies in urban setting areas, specifically in the cit￾ies and the remote areas, affordability of data is important 
to consider. Cost-effective solutions require aligning the 
operating costs by sharing infrastructure, hardware, and 
software, as well as leveraging the resources and expertise 
of the private sector in implementation and financing of 
new technologies in urban areas through public-private 
partnerships (PPPs) to ensure affordability. PPPs divide the 
costs and risks between the data from private and public 
data parties to adapt financially for the new technologies.
6. Lifecycle Cost Analysis: The entire usage of maintaining 
and deploying the cutting-edge technologies in an urban 
setting is considered in the evaluations of affordability. The 
lifecycle cost and technology affordability measures are used 
to analyse the upfront costs, maintenance costs, expected 
returns on investment (ROI), and ongoing costs of solutions 
throughout their usage.
7. Inclusive Pricing Models: Inclusive pricing models assure 
equitable access to technology for the residents, income 
level, and socioeconomic status, irrespectively. These people 
are given priority when considering affordability. The com￾munities of the underdeveloped are given less privilege and 
increased accessibility for technological solutions in finan￾cial mechanisms, pricing structures, and pricing subsidies.
Conclusion
The usage of emerging technologies requires careful focus on two key fac￾tors: scalability and affordability in urban planning. Cities may produce 
scalable solutions that give the advantage of cloud-based infrastructure 
usage, interoperability of data, and data modularity to enhance and mod￾ify the data and their technological capacities in all responses to making 
changes in the demands and the challenging obstacles. Moreover, by this, 
the cities can guarantee good access to the solutions and for sustainable 
urban development for all citizens in considerable solutions, partnerships, 
and pricing models.

2.6.3 AR and VR’s Place in the Future of Urban 
Environment Management
Immersive technologies, like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality 
(AR), play an important role to change urban environmental management 
techniques in upcoming projects. One innovative approach to visualising, 
analysing, and communicating urban data is to involve stakeholders in pro￾active measures to identify environmental issues and make well-informed 
decisions. Mixed reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are used in several 
significant domains of urban environmental management. Urban environ￾mental management uses AR and VR in various important areas [40].
Analysis and Visualization of Data
Stakeholders are able to visualize the urban environmental data in more 
immersive 3D environments, like AR and VR, to improve the comprehen￾sion and the relationships of spatial data, data trends, and data patterns 
[41] using interactive data analysis tools to investigate the urban environ￾ments, scenarios, and the possibility of data.
Collaboration and Engagement of Stakeholders
By producing immersive experiences that promote involvement and coop￾eration in urban environmental management projects, augmented reality 
and virtual reality (AR/VR) help to increase stakeholder engagement. The 
stakeholders can collaboratively exchange data viewpoints and co-create 
solutions in an environmental challenge for virtual meetings, workshops, 
and design collaboration sessions in virtual reality (VR) environments.
Planning and Decision Support
Legislators, environmental managers, and urban planners can view alter￾native scenarios, weigh trade-offs, and prioritize interventions through a 
head-mounted display using AR and VR as decision support tools. In the 
use of scenario modeling, assessment of impact, and the analysis of risks, 
the technologies help the stakeholders in developing strategies, which are 
flexible and for sustainable development based on the facts from urban 
data [42].
Education and Public Awareness [43, 44]
Civic duty and environmental stewardship are through the applications of 
AR and VR in terms of public awareness and local teaching about envi￾ronmental issues and are encouraged. Engaging the participants or the 
audiences with the new immersive storytelling and the virtual tours in

interactive educational experiences using AR and VR environments prac￾tices them to behave in a more proper sustainable development [45].
Readiness and Preparedness for Disasters
To help emergency responders and the members of the community to build 
the skills and develop the mechanism that is necessary to practice along 
with the environmental hazards, simulations of augmented reality and vir￾tual reality to produce more realistic scenarios for training, and the prepa￾ration for disasters with virtual simulations, stakeholders use the routes for 
evaluation, emergency coordinate responses, and potential understanding 
of impacts like wildfires, storms, and floods [46].
Observation and Investigation
The surveillance and real-time monitoring of environment data related to 
urban settings are possible with the help of AR and VR technologies for the 
stakeholders to spot the changes in hotspots and new threats. AR and VR 
technologies have the importance of revolutionizing urban environmental 
management for providing future cutting-edge environmental monitoring, 
disaster resilience, management of stakeholders, visualization of data, and 
decision support. Cities can address difficult issues in the environment, 
sustainability encouragement, and quality of life for the citizens of AR and 
VR. These technologies have significant potential for improving urban 
management of environmental data [47, 48].
2.7 Conclusion
This chapter discusses remote sensing technology for dealing with issues in 
the urban environment, efficient connectivity, and capability. The impor￾tance of combining cutting-edge technologies, like Artificial Intelligence, 
the Internet of Things, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality, to improve 
urban environmental management and get around connectivity issues is 
highlighted by key findings. The creation of different cooperative platforms 
for data sharing, the adoption of all moral and privacy standards, and the 
expenditure of money on all the scalable and reasonable-cost technological 
solutions are recommended. Urban environmental remote sensing and the 
development in all 5G connectivity, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered 
analytics, and technological democratization have a future scope. Urban 
environmental management techniques are in revolution, to make easy for

the decision process by the stakeholders, encourage participation, and also 
creating stronger, viable, and enjoyable cities for the coming generations.
2.7.1 Future Gap
Further studies might concentrate on handling the remaining obstacles 
and constraints in the fusion of remote sensing technology and developing 
urban environmental management methodologies. More specifically, there 
are creative ways to improve the cost effectiveness, and scalability, and the 
accessibility of these technologies must be examined especially in envi￾ronments with limited resources and populations. To ensure responsibility 
and implementation, more research into the area of ethical, social, and 
environmental management of remote sensing is essential. Future research 
also concentrates on the policy interventions and the capacity-building 
programs that work to motivate the stakeholders to adopt and use remote 
sensing technology.

3.1 Introduction
This part covers the concept of Society 5.0, which is considered to be cru￾cial for the fast-growing modern world. Summarizing the starting point 
for a full discussion of the technology-sustainability nexus, the chapter 
explores how Society 5.0 can significantly change world politics. The com￾mencement of the long voyage of human society into the impending Smart 
and Sustainable Society 5.0 marks a pivotal era where different advanced 
technologies converge to create a harmonious and equitable future for all. 
The transition of this paradigm not only extends the growth of technology 
but also goes beyond and incorporates sustainability and innovation. A 
novel concept of Smart and Sustainable Society 5.0 emerges as a solution 
to major global problems and a balancing tool for human–technology–
nature interaction through the application of advanced technologies. This 
introduction provides the background to a comprehensive analysis of ways 
in which artificial intelligence, the IoT, renewable energy, and sustainable 
development get involved in society’s development. The objective is to 
build a society that is socially and environmentally conscious besides tech￾nologically advanced. It is almost important to understand a future where 
ecological conservation and economic prosperity coexist, and technology 
is a tool that enables humanity and does not hinder it. Achieving Smart 
Sustainable Society 5.0 involves transforming enterprises, communities, 
and economies, which can only be accomplished through collective effort. 
Therefore, mastering the basics is the first step to adopting this approach.
3.1.1 Evolution of Societal Paradigms
Industrialization and social transformations are deeply interrelated, as 
the latter can bring about the growth of the economy, progress in technol￾ogy, migration and building of urban centers, the reorganization of soci￾ety, and cultural revolutions. Among the many consequences brought by 
industrialization is the growth of the economy, which, in turn, modifies 
several aspects including the distribution of wealth job trends and social 
structure. Technological evolutions, like steam engines, electricity, and 
digital technology, have been the reason for the ability to form commu￾nication, transportation, and healthcare that have been bringing change 
in the entire society. Urbanization led people to population flow from the 
rural periphery to urban centers to achieve comfortable living and favor￾able working conditions. Through the introduction of industrial capital￾ism, new social classes like the bourgeoisie and workers appeared amid the

class stratification and power relations transformations. Cultural change 
has been possibly brought about by factors, like globalization, mass media, 
and the development of technology, and it has been impacting the world 
views, aesthetics, and people’s cultural identities. Environmental influence 
is also essential, as pollution, resource depletion, and habitat destruction 
become immense. Developing a good link between industry and society is 
an essential factor for the promotion of equality between the classes and 
ultimately toward developing a sustainable way of life as well as being able 
to deal successfully with the beneficial and bad effects of technology.
Industry 1.0: Mechanization With Water and Steam Power
Through steam and water power in equipment and transportation, England’s 
industrial revolution of the 18th century converted agrarian societies into 
industrial ones. Manufacturing equipment driven by steam developed pro￾duction zones, extended rail systems, and allowed mass-produced goods to 
travel to nations with low production levels. Transportation and industry 
were revolutionized by steam machinery, including the telegraph, fossil 
fuel cars, and steamships.
Industry 2.0: Mass Production and Electrification
Cheap steel manufacturing and sophisticated chemical and electrical pro￾cesses marked the start of the Second Industrial Revolution. In 1882, it 
carried on with the introduction of electricity to cities and enterprises. 
Electric power, automated procedures, and production lines were import￾ant components. Synthetic chemicals, artificial fertilizers, and textile items 
were manufactured together with the emergence of total quality and scien￾tific management principles.
Industry 3.0: Automation and Digitalization
In Industry 3.0, the rapid growth of computers and cyberspace is referred 
to as the informatics revolution, which led to the creation of programmable 
devices and the commercialization of digital technology. This revolution 
focused on issues, like overcapacity, and enabled more efficient produc￾tion while lowering labor costs. Artificial intelligence-based intelligent 
machines also emerged throughout the revolution completely changing 
the sector.
Industry 4.0: Smart Manufacturing and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
Smart factories, IoT, and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are all part of the 
revolution known as Industry 4.0, which was first presented in Germany. 
Big data, cloud computing, machine-to-machine connectivity, and smart

products are all included. Faster and more flexible production is made 
possible by innovation. Products can be produced more quickly, more 
intelligently, more competitively, and more smartly thanks to Industry 4.0 
technologies like data management, cyber-physical systems, AI, robotics, 
augmented reality, machine learning, smart factories, IoT, cloud comput￾ing, and big data.
Industry 5.0: Human–Machine Collaboration and 
Sustainable Production
Building on Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0 emphasizes the mutually beneficial 
association between people and machinery. It imagines a day when human 
abilities and creativity are complemented by cutting-edge technologies, 
like robotics and AI, creating more collaborative and human-centered 
work settings. The evolution of industry is shown in Figure 3.1.
Society 1.0: Hunter–Gatherer Communities
The early human communities throughout the Palaeolithic epoch were 
characterized by nomadic hunter–gatherer lifestyles. Individuals depend 
on fishing, hunting, and harvesting natural plants for sustenance. Its key 
features include small bands of people living in temporary shelters, using 
primitive tools and weapons made from natural materials, and sharing 
resources within kinship-based social structures.

and industry. In this utopian society, economic expansion and technologi￾cal advancement are not driven by the interests of a small group of people, 
but rather by the desire for everyone to live life to the fullest. The expecta￾tions of Society 5.0 are being met by investigating emerging technologies 
including fog computing, cloud computing, 5G/5G IoT, edge computing, 
Internet of Everything, blockchain, and beyond networks. The work of the 
author sheds light on several open research opportunities and difficulties 
for Society 5.0, such as the function of 5G–IoT in waste pooling, resource 
identification, and dispersed resources. It also emphasizes empowering 
pertinent linked health societal sectors and remote education.
The concept “Society 5.0” was first established at the Japan Business 
Federation, in the “5th Science and Technology Basic Plan.” Then, it later 
came into practice in January 2016 by the Cabinet of Japan [1]. To increase 
future investment, the cabinet of Japan implemented a strategy that was 
aimed at realizing Society 5.0. In contrast to Germany and the US, Fukuda’s 
research examines how Japan’s Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) 
ecosystem is evolving into Society 5.0. The analysis demonstrates system 
resilience while identifying the main socioeconomic hazards and catego￾rizing them as capital, labor, and spatial risks [2]. According to this strat￾egy, creating Society 5.0 would be essential to achieving both mid- and 
long-term growth. This would allow for the introduction of I4.0 technolo￾gies, such as robotics, big data, AI, and the Internet of Things, to the social 
and industrial spheres and solve a variety of societal problems [3–5].
Numerous studies focus on Society 5.0. The authors discussed the var￾ious stages that evolved from Industry 1.0 leading up to Society 5.0 and 
also discussed Society 5.0’s objectives and contributions. Specifically, they 
showcased the growth of people, organizations, and communities capa￾ble of setting up, running, and utilizing Society 5.0 systems in the face 
of COVID-19, which is a global pandemic. Furthermore, they stressed 
that governmental policies on digital technologies are significantly influ￾enced by institutional compliance with Society 5.0. Consequently, soci￾eties capable of setting up and running e-based systems are needed for 
Society 5.0 [6].
Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 were defined as the humanization of indus￾trial production. To learn about the difficulties and opportunities faced 
by the Russian business community, the authors conducted a survey. 
According to the report, establishing mechanisms to promote investment 
in socially conscious technologies and giving priority to these principles 
for national technological growth are important. As Russia’s economy 
moves toward becoming a digital society, it faces comparable challenges to 
those of other countries [7].

The authors evaluated the concept of Society 5.0 and discussed the 
integration of Society 5.0 technologies into people’s daily lives and the 
community. The authors found that Japan, Turkey, and Indonesia had 
the highest levels of research engagement in this field after examining pre￾vious studies on Society 5.0 [8]. The challenges of digitalization in edu￾cation were explored during the shift to Society 5.0 focusing on Turkey’s 
studies and activities. The authors emphasized the importance of priori￾tizing digitalization in evaluating tools, gathering relevant practices, and 
achieving objectives in education highlighting the shift from Education 1.0 
to Education 4.0 [9].
In a 2020 study, the ideas of Society 5.0 were explored, and the ICT 
effects were analyzed on older caregivers and the elderly who require care 
and also analyzed the effects of sociocultural and ethical implications on 
elderly care. In particular, there was concern expressed about the likelihood 
that AI robots would offer spiritual social services and care in addition to 
physical cleaning and cleanliness. This work explains how communication 
technologies have possible effects on the healthcare sector [11].
The author addresses cyber-physical systems, which comprise hard￾ware, software, and biological elements. The study also covers the key ideas 
of cyber-physical system design, including big data, cloud computing, arti￾ficial intelligence (AI), big data, and digital twins. The author noted that, 
in addition to software and hardware, developing technologies also take 
biological elements into account. Systems that not only allow machines 
to communicate with one another but also keep people informed are in 
development. One of the industries most impacted by Society 5.0 is health￾care, and the author provided instances of cyber-physical systems in this 
field [12]. Socioeconomic robotic systems’ impact was studied, which is 
proliferating in the context of globalization. The application of robotic and 
intelligent systems in the industrial, economic, and sociocultural domains 
was studied by the authors about digital transformation and change in the 
economy. The study emphasized that a significant economic revolution is 
provided by the systems around [13].
To build extremely intelligent societies, the authors have researched the 
framework of Japanese Society 5.0. Japan is facing several issues, similar to 
those facing other nations, such as lack of competition, falling birth rates, 
and aging populations. Society 5.0, which takes a community-centered 
approach, seeks to address these issues by utilizing technology advance￾ments. Another of its goals is to create a better global order where everyone 
has access to the technological advancements of modern civilization and to 
support the nation’s growth and development in all spheres. The shift from 
Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0 was discussed, which places a strong emphasis

on human-centric, sustainable resource management and integrates digital 
efficiency with resilient design to create a resilient society [14]. The signif￾icance of Society 5.0 lies in its visionary approach to addressing societal 
challenges and fostering inclusive prosperity through the integration of 
cutting-edge technologies and social innovation. By leveraging emerging 
technologies, such as fog computing, cloud computing, 5G/5G–IoT, edge 
computing, and blockchain, Society 5.0 aims to enhance efficiency, con￾nectivity, and resilience across diverse sectors. Furthermore, Society 5.0 
can be a driver where nations and citizens can cope with crises like the 
COVID-19 global pandemic and demographic aging. Society 5.0 aims at a 
model of the future global environment where the use of technology boosts 
sustainable growth and development at the same time it targets the welfare 
of humanity through selective decision making and legislative initiatives.

another, provides both smart services and data sharing. Interconnection, 
sensors and actuators, data collecting and analyzing, real-time controlling 
and monitoring, scalability and interoperability, privacy and security, 
energy efficiency, and user experience are some of the main themes. To 
achieve efficient data communication and sharing, the devices of the 
Internet of Things make use of a variety of communication protocols such 
as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and cellular networks. The actuators will 
respond based on the information that the sensors have analyzed from 
their surroundings. Then, data are delivered to the cloud systems for analy￾sis and storage. In-time monitoring and control enabled by the IoT renders 
preventive maintenance and resource management possible. For successful 
data exchange in various domains, interoperability and scalability matter 
a lot. For user-friendly interfaces and effective interaction, the user expe￾rience counts the most. IoT technology could help businesses increase 
their productivity, quality of life for people, and efficiency of processes by 
deploying those ideas.

technologies, like the Internet of Things, augmented reality, AI, and driv￾erless cars, as well as spur economic expansion, innovation, and increased 
competitiveness internationally.
3.4.1 Evolution of Cellular Communication Standards
From early analog systems to 5G technologies, the development of cellular 
communication standards has been fueled by technical breakthroughs and 
standardization initiatives to improve data speeds, coverage, dependability, 
and efficiency.
First Generation (1G)
The first commercial mobile, 1G cellular networks, were presented in the 
1980s and had basic voice calling with low data rates for limited-service 
areas.
Second Generation (2G)
Since the appearance of the 2G networks at the very beginning of the 
1990s, voice quality as well as security and spectrum efficiency improved

when digital communication was implemented instead of analog transmis￾sion. The data networks along these networks were also made available to 
the users of this.
Third Generation (3G)
The era of 3G networks began in the early 2000s, with faster data speeds 
and multimedia services, it was a significant step forward. Such innova￾tions helped to spur a boom in mobile multimedia streaming and internet 
data services.
Fourth Generation (4G LTE)
The appearance of 4G LTE networks in the late 2000s served as a means for 
widespread mobile broadband, streaming movies, and online gaming due 
to the data speed rise, decreased latency, and improved spectral efficiency.
Fifth Generation(5G)
5G networks allow for new apps, such as augmented reality and the Internet 
of Things, by offering lightning-speed data rates, low latency, as well as an 
enormously increased number of connections. These technologies com￾prise things like millimeter-wave frequencies, massive MIMO, beamform￾ing, and network slicing.
3.4.2 5G Networks’ Features and Capabilities
Unlike the preceding 4G networks, 5G networks are proficient in pro￾viding a large number of connections, very low latency, very fast data 
rates, improved coverage, seamless network slicing, cloud computing, 
and additional security features. They do an excellent job of download￾ing and uploading quickly, playing games in real time, and streaming 
high-definition videos. They are the vehicle for IoT networks and smart 
city initiatives that require large connectivity coverage. High availabil￾ity and reliability are other attributes of 5G that are also dedicated to 
ensuring smooth operation even in a high-density area. Besides, they 
allow for the transmission on low- and high-band frequencies gener￾ating not only in-space but also out-of-station communication. For 
low-latency applications, like augmented reality and driverless cars, in 
particular, edge computing lowers latency by permitting real-time data 
analysis processing.

3.4.3 Emerging Trends and Technologies Beyond—5G (B5G) 
and 6G
Currently, as Beyond-5G (B5G) and 6G technologies, the next level in 
wireless communication is under development. They hold promise in 
delivering speeds that are even faster, with latency that has been reduced, 
and an enhanced network connection than the current 5G connectivity. 
However, the next few years will see these emerging trends that change the 
way businesses work, and start new industries based on these applications. 
Given below are some of the key emerging technologies:
Terahertz Communication
Compared to the used millimeter-wave and microwave frequencies, B5G 
and 6G show impressive performance improvements that include much 
better data speed and bandwidth by experimenting with the terahertz 
(THz) frequency implementation for wireless communication.
Massive MIMO and Beamforming
Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Outputs) and Beamforming 
comprise two techniques crucial in 5G communication. B5G and 6G tech￾nologies leverage beamforming as a tool to enhance the capability of spec￾trum efficiency, coverage, capacity, and so on.
A huge MIMO system is accomplished by the use of a maximal number 
of antennas in the service of multiple users simultaneously, and thus, the 
system capacity and throughput are increased. The purpose of beamform￾ing is to accurately focus radio waves in certain directions. Coverage is 
thus enhanced as interference is significantly reduced especially in densely 
populated metropole areas.
Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS)
The radio operators target the passive reflecting surfaces, which are manip￾ulated by the high-tech machinery to face the radio waves. To know about 
this technology better, it is necessary to learn about reconfigurable intelli￾gent surfaces and metasurfaces, which are the two types of surfaces.
By utilizing the phase changing and amplification, the IRS reaches wider 
areas, with further range, and higher signal quality be it indoor or outdoor. 
It results from efficient use of time processing and moving base stations to 
the next level.

Quantum Communication
One of the most important tools of the B5G and 6G technologies is apply￾ing the principles of quantum communication for the encryption of com￾munication channels and making them safe and impenetrable. Quitting 
the classical keys round for quantum-encoded ones to transmit the cryp￾tographic keys is done by quantum key distribution (QKD) and high pri￾vacy is achieved for both parties.
Intelligent Network Management
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are 
widely adopted by B5G and 6G networks to provide intelligent network 
management and optimization.
Speeding up responses, increasing efficiency, and making networks 
more dependable is not only possible with versatile orchestration and 
advanced analytics but also autonomous operations powered by artificial 
intelligence.
Bio-Communication
Concurrently, research has been carried out, which explores the possibility 
of employing biological systems in terms of DNA and protein. Utilizing the 
in-built information-processing and transmitting agency features of bio￾logical molecules, bio-based communication technologies are being con￾sidered the safest and energy-saving choices for communication.
3.5 Edge Computing: Decentralized Processing 
for Low Latency
Through onsite data processing, edge computing decreases latency and 
bandwidth consumption in distributed computing. This is perfect for real￾time sensitive applications like augmented reality, driverless cars, and the 
Internet of Things. Quicker response time and better performance of data 
processing close to the edge or network are achieved. Through filters and 
analysis locally, edge computing facilitates applications that take a short 
time to travel with a small bandwidth. Being able to store sensitive data 
near its source and with a lower likelihood of data leakage or unlawful 
access also frees up some privacy and security rights. It is anticipated that 
the networked systems and services are going to be relying heavily on edge 
computing technology in the future.

3.5.1 Understanding Edge Computing Architecture
Human-driven society, which aims to make use of modern technologies, 
such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data 
analytics to optimize a relationship between social progress and economic 
growth, relies on edge computing architecture significantly. Edge com￾puting in the Society 5.0 context means processing data in a manner that 
involves both the points close to the sources of the generated data and the 
centralized cloud servers instead of relying solely on the centralized serv￾ers. This method includes a few benefits like reduction of delay, improved 
data security, and better productivity. Some of the key components and 
layers of edge computing architecture for Society 5.0 are discussed below:
Edge Devices
The principle of edge computing architecture is high-end devices that are 
capable of gathering large amounts of data from multiple sources, which 
include sensors, actuators, wearables, cell phones, and IoT endpoints.
Edge Gateways
Edge gateways will lower the latency and bandwidth utilization by remov￾ing, reordering, compressing, and encrypting data as it is in transit between 
edge devices and the cloud.
Edge Servers
Edge servers are placed close to edge devices and deliver the computa￾tional ability that is useful for processing data, executing AI algorithms, 
and running apps in real time. The advantage of this is that it allows being 
proactive and receiving immediate responses.
Fog Computing
Due to classical distributed architecture in fog computing, the comput￾ing power spreads over network layers closer to edge devices than classical 
cloud data centers.
Distributed Data Processing
Through the architecture of edge computing, distributed data processing 
methods are used to analyze data streams from edge devices, which then 
help to mine the learned insights. At the network edges, this is the tech￾nology that enables the conduction of real-time analytics and decision￾making processes and, at the same time, minimizes data flow as well as 
latency.

Security and Privacy
In applications where edge computing also serves as a means for process￾ing highly delicate data, security and privacy issues are major aspects of the 
design process. Security mechanisms, such as encryption, access controls, 
and secure booting, are implemented by edge devices and gateway devices 
to protect sensitive and critical data.
Interoperability and Standards
It is necessary to provide certainty of compatibility and seamless integra￾tion among different edge computing systems and devices by implement￾ing interoperability and standardization activities. Channeling data among 
edge devices, gateways, and cloud platforms is streamlined due to the avail￾ability of industry-established protocols, APIs, and data format standards.
Collaborative Ecosystem
The collaboration of edge devices, gateways, servers, and cloud services is 
made possible by the edge computing architecture with the help of which 
intelligent, context-aware applications and services can be delivered. In 
Society 5.0, all these innovative applications, such as smart cities, driverless 
cars, medical monitoring, and industrial automation, are enabled by this 
collaborative approach, which, in turn, is also the economic driver.
3.5.2 Edge Computing’s Benefits for Analytics 
and Data Processing
Within the concept of Society 5.0 in which the approaches of technology’s 
most advanced part hope to provide a balanced society, through which 
people’s comfort and economic power will simultaneously work, edge 
computing offers different benefits in this area. The following are some of 
the crucial returns of edge computing in data processing and analytics for 
Society 5.0:
Reduced Latency
Another element that is supported by edge computing is lower reaction 
times and reduced data processing latency through the process of data 
processing closer to the points of generation. The processing of data 
needs to be even faster for applications in the real-time environment of 
Society 5.0. Such applications include industrial automation, healthcare 
monitoring, and driverless cars, where the decisions need to be made on 
the prompt.

Improved Data Privacy and Security
The issues of data protection and privacy have become increasingly import￾ant for raising global concerns. Processing of usual data can be left on local 
edge devices or gateways by edge computing that omits sending raw data to 
centralized cloud servers, which results in saving bandwidth. A decrease in 
the data breach probability, illegal access, and dangerous exposure of data 
is highly vital for the privacy protection and security of data.
Bandwidth Optimization
The architecture of edge computing can do this in the sense that it calcu￾lates and minimizes its bandwidth consumption by locally refining and 
filtering data before sending it to the cloud where it will be analyzed exten￾sively. This prevents data transfer expenses from outspending the budget 
and reduces the consumption of network bandwidth where the connectiv￾ity is either irregular or cannot be guaranteed to be there.
Real-Time Insights and Decision- Making
Edge computing brings about real-time analytics and decision making as 
it operates at the ends of a network processing data through the network 
edge. Thus, the ability of Society 5.0 apps to customize the services is real￾ized by utilizing the immediate provision of answers and data on predic￾tions, optimizations, and deviations, which are happening all the time.
3.5.3 Use Case and Deployment Scenario
Edge computing, as a technology in Society 5.0, expands the possibilities 
for achieving revolutionary use cases and deployment scenarios. It allows 
driving data to be analyzed in real time where it makes the roads safer, 
creates perfect traffic flows, and eliminates congestion. In addition, it also 
provides for environmental monitoring, for implementation of preventive 
measures, acts as a prompt in the case of an emergency arising in a crisis, 
and improves public health. Thus, thanks to the growth of the IoT, tele￾medicine, point-of-care diagnostics, and remote monitoring of patients are 
technically possible in the healthcare sector. It allows supply chain stream￾lining, quality control, and predictive maintenance in the industrial area. 
Real-time production and energy distribution or consumption networking 
are done by smart grid integration, and also through the renewable energy 
sources and energy storage devices in support of energy management. It 
is in a position to read the energy consumption data from smart meters 
and IoT devices to the end of supporting the demand response strategies.

It accesses the existing capacities rather than the expanding by installing 
new ones. In addition, it can extract maximum energy from the buildings, 
thus minimizing expenses. This technology has also made precision farm￾ing possible.
3.6 Blockchain Technology: Securing Data Integrity 
and Trust
Blockchain technologies could bring a great deal of trust and data integrity 
into Society 5.0. It provides a decentralized, immutable ledger for storing 
information and transactions, which makes these transactions ensure their 
integrity. Blockchain transactions furthermore offer the reliability of audit￾ing and transparency of stakeholders. The smart contracts along with the 
cryptographic keys allow people to retain possession and rule over their 
data. Blockchain-based identity management systems provide users with 
increased privacy and better security against identity thefts. The ability of 
blockchain to provide supply chains with more transparency and trace￾ability allows stakeholders to view the origin, authenticity, and quality of 
products. Smart contracts aim to eliminate intermediaries and achieve 
affable transactions through computerized automation and execution. 
Blockchain-based platforms for data sharing, which are secure, allow for 
the exchange of meaningful information between various parties. It also 
allows for tokenization of assets and, therefore, places value generation and 
ownership transfers between peers on the agenda.
3.6.1 Fundamentals of Blockchain Technology
The basis of Society 5.0 is blockchain technology, which makes it a simpler 
process to incorporate sophisticated technologies into a human-oriented 
society that combines social and economic progression. The following are 
the fundamentals of blockchain technology in Society 5.0:
Decentralization
Data can be stored between several computers instead of centralizing 
the data in one spot; with blockchain, data can be stored on a network of 
decentralized nodes. Thus, this scalability leads the network to the state of 
the system, which meets the objectives of empowering of an individual and 
at a community level by Society 5.0.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License88 Networked Sensing Systems
Immutable Ledger
Blockchain technology is a transaction and data-logging device that never 
gets tampered with and is incapable of any data change. In terms of record￾ing data into the blockchain, its integrity and authenticity are guaranteed 
since no data deletion or modification is possible after it is loaded.
Transparency and Traceability
Transactions between blocks are traceable and transparent, which means 
that a user can check for the source data and prove when the informa￾tion was created. Such transparency can be translated into the open trail of 
transactions, which makes stakeholders feel more confident by increasing 
the level of accountability of the participants and boosting the necessity for 
regulatory compliance.
Cryptographic Security
The blockchain secures data and transactions on the network using 
so-called cryptographic measures like hashing and digital signatures. 
These cryptographic methods provide the basis of protecting the informa￾tion from any attempts to modify data or illegal access during data verifi￾cation enabling the users to secure their information.
Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are programmable agreements, which are recorded and 
enforced on the blockchain simultaneously with specific rule precondi￾tions. They allow for trustless transactions and provide an alternative for 
the functions of intermediaries, which facilitate and enforce agreements. 
Parties to an agreement no longer depend on those intermediaries. In the 
Society 5.0 era, smart contracts are being used in sectors such as supply 
management, decentralized finance, and DAOs (decentralized autono￾mous organizations).
Tokenization
Blockchain creates a digital record that represents ownership of assets, and 
the technology makes it possible to tokenize such assets as digital curren￾cies, stocks, and physical assets. They can use the tokenized representation 
of assets on the blockchain to do safe transfer of ownership, and peer-to￾peer asset exchange, and also to discover new avenues for wealth genera￾tion and exchange in Society 5.0.

3.6.2 Applications in Secure Data Sharing, Supply Chain 
Management, and Decentralized Finance
Blockchain technology is a prerequisite for safe data sharing in a Society 
5.0 world, where digitalization initiatives strive to create a social system 
that balances economic superiority with community enhancement. The 
following are some applications of blockchain in these areas:
Secure Data Sharing
With the help of blockchain, it is possible for data sharing across borders, 
supply chain traceability, and interchange of health data in a safe envi￾ronment. It can be performed through cryptographic keys that allow the 
patients to use their medical records while maintaining privacy. Moreover, 
it yields accountability and a sense of integrity in the operations of the sup￾ply chain. Data compliance is guaranteed by its decentralized encryption 
technology.
Supply Chain Management
Blockchain technology reduces the risks of fraud and forgeries through the 
ability to monitor and audit supply chain operations in real time. Supplier 
verification can be made easier with the help of credential records and 
certifications. As such, the blockchain serves as a transparent ledger that 
tracks stock movements and replenishment requests, which simplifies the 
process of having an efficient inventory management strategy.
Decentralized Finance
Through transparency, blockchain technology enables one to form decen￾tralized exchanges (DEX) for cryptocurrency trading. The implementation 
of smart contracts brings out lending and borrowing platforms, which are 
decentralized, hence, giving an opportunity to underserved individuals to 
get to the financial services they need. The algorithms play a role in auto￾mated market making, which, in turn, facilitates market trading and pro￾vision of liquidity.
3.6.3 Challenges and Potential Solutions
Society 5.0 has great potential where blockchain technology can be applied 
for the better, but it does have obstacles. One of the issues is scalability 
where the number of transactions is normally slow. In addition, the costs 
 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by ibrahim ragab - Oregon Health & Science Univer , Wiley Online Library on [09/02/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License90 Networked Sensing Systems
of these transactions are higher. Therefore, to fix the crowding problem, 
sharding, layer 2 protocols, and consensus algorithm will be integrated. If 
interoperability is a concern in the case of the inability of the blockchain 
networks and platform, it needs to be addressed immediately to provide 
efficient data transmission and cooperation. Cross-chain communication 
techniques, protocols, and interoperability standards also help to bridge 
the gap assisting in bringing integration and connectedness in Society 5.0.
The issues of privacy and confidentiality are quite significant and are 
especially common in sectors such as banking and healthcare. Privacy￾enabling techniques, such as secure multi-party computing, zero-knowledge 
proofs, and homomorphic encryption, will be of great importance to 
maintain transparency and auditability while data privacy is protected. 
Adopting permissioned blockchains, while including access limitations, 
will create a more safeguarded network for conduct of the sensitive infor￾mation and transactions. Moreover, user experience and adoption are also 
a problem in Society 5.0. The broader deployment of blockchain technol￾ogy is impeded by so many critical issues such as complexity and usability. 
To expand the acceptability, apps, which are accessible on mobile devices 
and simple interfaces, can be created. In addition, linkage with current sys￾tems can also be made seamlessly. The adoption and involvement of users 
and stakeholders in Society 5.0 can be stimulated if there is proper educa￾tion about the benefits and applications of blockchain technology to users 
as well as stakeholders.
3.7 Artificial Intelligence in Network Optimization
Artificial intelligence (AI) in Society 5.0 is capable of transforming net￾works and infrastructure into a single system using the integration of new 
technologies. The AI-powered network management systems use machine 
learning algorithms to observe, enhance, and optimize network security, 
reliability, and performance of the network. Intelligent vehicle networks 
offer predictive maintenance, allocation of dynamic resources, intelligent 
traffic routing, detection of security risks and their consequences, and 
quality of service optimization as the extra advantages of these systems. 
AI-based cybersecurity solutions allow the detection of risks in real time 
and mitigation where the software examines and finds out if there is any 
deviant activity. Edge computing capabilities with integrated networks and 
AI-driven ones enable applications to run better and faster and produce 
data for making better decisions.

3.7.1 Role of AI and Machine Learning 
in Network Management
Society 5.0 integrates AI and ML into network management for trou￾bleshooting network performance, identifying traffic patterns, as well as 
security problems, which becomes possible without any human involve￾ment. To identify failures and malfunctions in the future, they use past 
data for analyzing and recognizing patterns. Based on actual demand and 
workload patterns, AI and ML replace human resources by dynamically 
increasing, decreasing, or modifying bandwidth, capacity, and computing 
resources, which results in better utilization of the resources. AI-driven 
network routing algorithms and traffic control models implemented for 
routing and traffic engineering reduces data processing such as latency 
and congestion. Through transmission network analysis and identification 
of malicious work, they can encounter security risks in real-time mode. 
Delivering standard user demands, various preferences, and service level 
agreements takes place through adjusting networks based on QoS (Quality 
of Service). It guarantees stable operation, believably, and highly positive 
rates for the members of Society 5.0.
3.7.2 AI-Driven Approaches for Resource Allocation 
and Optimization
AI-inspired optimization and resource allocation techniques rely on machine 
learning algorithms and data-driven foresight to maximize resource usage in 
areas that include manufacturing, cloud computing, and network technolo￾gies where resources need to be allocated quickly and in a dynamic manner. 
The following are some key AI-driven approaches for optimization and allo￾cation of resources:
Reinforcement Learning
An agent needs to interact with its environment by introducing the kind 
of machine learning known as reinforcement learning (RL) to effectively 
make decisions that will maximize the reward. RL algorithms are unique 
in that they can react by adjusting the allocation of resources accord￾ing to environmental cues, such as the usage of the resources in an opti￾mized manner and the satisfaction of the users. RL applications, such 
as load balancing in cloud computing, adjusting traffic engineering in 
networks, and smart grid energy management, all have been fielded with 
RL approaches.

Genetic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms are optimization tools that are based on the concepts of 
natural selection and evolution. GAs can be employed in resource alloca￾tion while solving problems to find solutions with the highest performance 
values so that these solutions require the least amount of resources to 
achieve the goals and constraints. GAs are greatly useful in solving compli￾cated tasks that can be decomposed into smaller problems, such as produc￾tion schedule optimization in production management or job scheduling 
in distributed computing.
Convolutional Neural Networks
The primary use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is image rec￾ognition, categorization, and other such tasks. CNNs can be applied in 
resource management to process large amounts of data, like reading 
through the traffic patterns or network readings, to detect any abnormal￾ity. In this way, the employed CNNs examine the anomaly, the predictive 
maintenance, as well as any existing faults from a network infrastructure 
perspective. It allows the allocation of resources to ensure that preventable 
losses or poor performance are mitigated.
Swarm Intelligence
The collective behavior of animals and social insects serves as the model 
for swarm intelligence algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization 
(PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The mimicking of swarm 
cooperativity using swarm intelligence algorithms can be used to search 
for optimal answers by focusing on resource distribution.
To increase the performance, swarm intelligence techniques have been 
taken into account for different optimization problems such as vehicle 
routing, task scheduling, and network routing.
3.8 Energy-Efficient Networking for Sustainability 
in Society 5.0
In the context of Society 5.0, a society where advanced technologies 
aimed at creating a community-oriented society that tries to find a bal￾ance between societal growth and economic progress while ensuring a 
minimum negative impact on the environment, data-efficient network￾ing becomes a fundamental part of sustainability. The following are key

strategies and technologies for achieving energy-efficient networking in 
Society 5.0:
 Green Networking Technologies—Significantly less energy 
is used in network infrastructure when low-power, dynamic 
power management, and energy-efficient hardware is used. 
By using these strategies, devices can adjust their power 
usage to meet the needs of their job and use less energy 
when there is little activity.
 Optimized Network Architecture—Energy-efficient resource 
consumption is made possible by network virtualization 
technologies, such as SDN and NFV. By reducing the dis￾tance over which data must be transmitted, edge comput￾ing uses less energy. Data journey distance is decreased by 
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) with distributed caching 
and nodes improving performance.
 Efficient Protocol Design—In wireless sensor networks, 
energy-aware protocols give priority to energy saving, and 
traffic optimization minimizes idle times and duplicate data 
transmissions. For effective resource allocation, network 
traffic is prioritized using Quality of Service (QoS)-based 
traffic management, taking into account user preferences 
and application needs.
 Renewable Energy Integration—Carbon emissions and 
dependency on fossil fuels are decreased via energy￾collecting systems and green data centers. By enabling 
sustainable operation in isolated or off-grid areas, these 
techniques lower carbon emissions.
 Data-Driven Optimization—Big Data Analytics: Proactively 
identifying inefficiencies and opportunities for optimization 
through the analysis of network traffic patterns, resource 
utilization, and information on energy use permits resource 
allocation and strategic decision making for energy-efficient 
networking. ML for Optimization: Energy efficiency and 
sustainability in network operations are improved using 
machine learning algorithms to optimize network topol￾ogies, forecast future patterns of energy use, and dynami￾cally modify network parameters based on real-time data 
analysis.

3.8.1 Strategies for Reducing Energy Consumption in 
Communication Networks
Reducing energy consumption in communication networks is crucial for 
sustainability in Society 5.0. The following are several strategies for achiev￾ing this goal:
Optimized Hardware and Infrastructure
Implement energy-efficient networking hardware, low-power compo￾nents, and cooling systems to reduce power consumption in network 
infrastructure.
Network Virtualization and Consolidation
Adopt network virtualization technologies to reduce energy usage by con￾solidating network services and reducing the number of physical devices 
such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network function vir￾tualization (NFV). To maximize resource allocation and minimize costs 
related to distributed network topologies, centralize network administra￾tion and control.
Traffic Optimization and Management
Reduce energy usage by streamlining network traffic patterns and trans￾mission protocols to reduce redundant data transfers, packet retransmis￾sions, and idle times. To prioritize network traffic according to application 
requirements, implement Quality of Service (QoS) techniques. This will 
ensure effective resource use and minimize energy waste.
Dynamic Power Management
To minimize energy consumption during idle periods and alter power 
usage based on workload needs, take advantage of network equipment’s 
power-saving capabilities and dynamic power management methodologies.
3.8.2 Green Networking Technologies and Practices 
in Society 5.0
Green networking methods and solutions constitute major elements that 
would permit the evolution of environmentally friendly communication

the fostering of self-sufficient communities geared toward the attainment 
of sustainability goals. The chapter presents the central themes, which are 
the emergence of paradigm shifts in society from the Industrial Age to the 
digital era; people witnessed the conversion of upheavals that started with 
the Industrial Revolution and were later followed by shifts in social and 
economic dynamics. Society 5.0 brings forth an approach to technology 
integration based on the human-centric perspective, encompassing har￾monization between the three pillars representing humans, technology, 
and nature. The extensive use of edge computing, IoT, 5G, and other net￾work and communication technologies plays a vital role in making smart 
and sustainable solutions applicable across various industries ranging from 
the healthcare, transportation, agriculture, and planning of urban spaces. 
Stakeholders of multi-sectoral, cross-sectoral, and international collabo￾ration are important in designing comprehensive programs that eradicate 
these constraints with alternative approaches that are fair for many. From 
time to time, it is, of course, necessary to look at ethical questions, sus￾tainability of the environment, and social equality in technology design, 
deployment, and control over networks and communications.

4.1 Introduction
Environmental monitoring is vital for empathizing with complex com￾munications between human actions and the atmosphere and for updat￾ing actual policies for environmental management and policy making. 
Outdated monitoring organizations naturally rely on immobile sensors 
arranged in secure locations, as long as there is valuable data, but often 
missing in longitudinal and sequential resolution. Besides, these schemes 
may not confine the occupied range of conservational experiences by 
people as they move over different locations and engage in various activ￾ities. In recent years, increasing attention in human-centric sensing as an 
opposite approach to outdated environmental monitoring. Human-centric 
sensing leverages the ubiquity of smart phones, wearable devices, and 
other individual gadgets equipped with sensors to collect environmental 
data directly from individuals in real time. By using the power of personal 
devices, human-centric sensing offers a possibility to enhance the coarse￾ness and context of environmental monitoring providing insights into 
environmental exposures at the micro scale and empowering individuals 
to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.
This chapter investigates novel methodologies for anthropocentric 
sensing within the purview of environmental surveillance. An original 
dissertation on the ethical thoughts of anthropocentric sensing and its 
compensations qualified to predictable monitoring system some examples 
are, understanding anthropocentric perception systems, surrounding data 
achievement, broadcasting, and investigation and so on. An exhibition of 
detecting sense modality, counting GPS, accelerometers, television camera, 
mics, and environmental sensors, are appraised for their efficacy in cap￾turing related environmental data. Furthermore, the manuscript addresses 
the inherent tasks associated with anthropocentric sensing such as discre￾tion anxieties, data quality concerns, and scalability. To ease these con￾texts, the work explores innovative approaches, plus privacy-preserving 
data combination techniques and machine learning algorithms for data 
authentication and synthesis.

are discussed. Complete circumstance trainings and practical examples 
validate the efficiency of human-centric sensing in providing criminal 
visions for conservational organization and policy making. Last, this paper 
explores forthcoming investigation instructions and developing trends in 
human-centric sensing for ecological monitoring.

while actively participating in all events, which are shown in Figure 4.4. 
This sensor is used to guide an individual user to access and transmit data 
using a Smartphone. This level of monitoring in human-centric sensing 
application has produced a major impact in data acquisition and transition 
using advanced wireless technology.
The most important monitoring scheme in a human-centric sensing 
system is social media analysis. It is a big area to develop the environment 
in a large area network. The main objective of this social media analysis is 
to share data, photos, events, and videos relevant to public concern and 
explore public requirement and issues in the authorized region. It is a good 
platform, which has so many resources that are used to analyze day-to-day 
activities, and reaches all people, and also gives solutions to the public. 
Nowadays, according to the digital world, data are collected using machine 
learning, AI, deep learning, and different network architectures, which are 
shown in Figure 4.5.

After considering all the processes in each monitoring process, the sensor 
is used to calculate and validate the information. This human-centric mon￾itoring uses many methodologies, which are used to observe data, collect 
data, and identify errors, accuracy level of monitoring process, and original 
information, which are used to improve the system quality. Ethnographic 
research methods involve studying human behavior and cultural practices 
within specific communities. Researchers conduct interviews, partici￾pant observations, and focus group discussions to understand how people 
perceive and interact with their environment. Ethnographic insights can 
inform the design of environmental monitoring programs and help identify 
relevant indicators for monitoring, which are shown in Figure 4.6.

From the overall monitoring process, the final stage of human-centric 
sensor is collaborative decision making. This process is used to collabo￾rate with scientists, policy members, community people, environmental 
management team, stakeholders, and finally human experience [25]. This 
monitoring system actively participates in all environmental-related mon￾itoring schemes, challenges, and issues. This mechanism is more relevant 
and effective to predict a better performance.
4.3 Types of Advanced HCS Environmental 
Monitoring System
4.3.1 Multispectral Sensors
An HCS environmental monitoring system has more sensors to capture 
data in a different frequency. To predict the data in any rate of frequency, 
this multispectral sensor is proposed. This sensor is working not like a 
human eye, which contains visible light spectrum inside the module. The 
input of a multispectral sensor is sent to an analog frame camera or lens, 
after initiating the data that are sent to a detector’s lens and filtration. This 
detector is used to detect active data with a proper frequency spectrum, 
and filtration is applied to remove unethical data. The data are transmitted 
over the scanner. This method is used to predict the exact point and send to 
discrete decoders, which are used to decode the process in a discrete man￾ner. After decoding of given data, which are sent to a mirror, they are going

to reflect the data to a dispersing element to reach the output. This method 
has a very good capability of data sensing to asses vegetation health, which 
is shown in Figure 4.7.
4.3.2 Thermal Sensors
This sensor is used to find the exact value of a particular device, which is 
identified through a sample of pattern. The heat sensor is a crucial factor in 
image recognition. Many analyses enable finding diseases in plants, finding 
fake images, and identifying humans, animals, plants, flowers, and so on.
4.3.3 LiDAR
Light Detection and Ranging is used to communicate data between long 
distances. The LiDAR is used to monitor the distance and distraction of 
signal in under water communication using the Lasar object, which is 
shown in Figure 4.8. This sensor is highly productive to measure data in 
a long-channel communication without any path transition loss using 
GPS. In upcoming technology, the path loss is rectified and recovered 
using 6G wireless communication. This wireless technology is more active 
in transmitting data between source and destination from one point to 
many, either in land, water, forest, device, etc. High-resolution mapping is 
analyzed using a 3D image spectrum [26].
4.3.4 Hyperspectral Sensors
It is used to analyze a specific area, which is affected by pollution, and the 
main aim of this sensor is good accuracy and to detect an object in the 
exact resolution with large data transmission using high bandwidth. It is 
similar to a multilevel sensor. This sensor has high charge capacity, high

resolution monitoring device. For quality, it has a spectrometer and driver 
system. To transfer data between communication media, it has alleviating 
device and color conversion process to predict original information, which 
is shown in Figure 4.9.
UAVs with hyperspectral sensors play a significant role in this area. 
These sensors can sense specific chemical signatures of pollutants offer￾ing a means to rapidly assess and monitor pollution levels. For instance, 
hyperspectral sensors can recognize oil spills in water bodies or detect air 
pollutants over industrial areas.

find destruction of image, frequently monitor the data due to changes hap￾pening in communication technology, deforestation, etc. In general, 3D 
image is used to get the details of any object using this sensor, which is 
shown in Figure 4.10. Three important processes are analyzed to obtain a 
high resolution. Image acquisition and calibration are used to predict the 
quality of an object from the communication technology. The second pro￾cess is referencing, which is verified using various analysis processes. Then, 
measurement and interpretation are used to find the overall quality of the 
data communication. These all happen because of the GIS process.
4.4 Applications in Environmental Monitoring
This human centric-sensing environmental monitoring system is the most 
required domain in today’s digital world. Depending upon the data pro￾cessing, application users have done many research to collect proper data 
and connectivity of a network reducing transmission loss, detecting fake 
objects, finding in-depth knowledge of undefined areas, etc. According to 
many research, this area has many sensors to protect human lifestyle using 
environmental monitoring system. Few applications based on environ￾mental monitoring system is defined in [27].
4.4.1 Smart Sensor
A smart sensor senses physical occurrence, interprets them into another 
form (often electronic impulse), and processes the obtained data. This 
function releases the external or programmable logic controller (PLC) 
of processing sensor output, which is shown in Figure 4.11. It frees the 
central controller to emphasize system-level tasks like process automation 
and analytics. This contrasts distinctive sensors, which simply translate 
physical phenomena into numerical values and communicate them to a 
central controller. In a challenging environment, for example, the internal 
machinery of a smart sensor can prevent inexact detection. Their output 
signal strength and threshold automatically change based on the environ￾ment. This varies from the typical sensor, in which the primary controller 
deals with this issue. Sensors collect information from specific settings and 
convert it into numerable electrical impulses. Temperature, speed, mass, 
force (pressure), and the occurrence of heat bodies, like humans, are exam￾ples of these characteristics. A microprocessor then processes the electri￾cal impulses to produce outputs corresponding to a set of actions. Finally, 
the system connects the output with receivers in the designated devices

to ensure proper operation. A system may employ many sensors of vary￾ing capabilities depending on the functional difficulties and rising feature 
needs. It may include more power sources, transmitters, receivers, and so 
on to achieve better outputs [28, 29].

networks (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G, 6G), enabling communication across varying 
distances. This wireless technology offers many resources for effective com￾munication over the entire world with secure communication. To over￾come the issues of wired connection, this wireless technology monitoring 
process is proposed in human-centric sensing mechanism for environ￾mental monitoring. This process is a crucial way to transmit data without 
any loss as well as for an easy way of communication between source to 
destination from anywhere in the world. This wireless technology has an 
advanced method, which might be connected with IoT, machine learning, 
and Artificial Intelligence to enhance the quality of the communication 
system. The main aim of this wireless technology is focused on secured 
data transmission using various encryption and decryption algorithms in 
cybersecurity and transmits the data confidentially using secured protocol 
in advance technology. The research in wireless technology is based on 
data rate transmission and bandwidth allocation, channel formation, data 
loss during communication, node connection, etc.
4.4.3 Passive Sensing Technology
Passive sensing technology entails detecting and measuring signals emitted 
or reflected by objects in the surroundings without actively emitting any 
energy, as illustrated in Figure 4.13, and which contains a sensing element, 
communication channel, readout unit, and processes data. In contrast to 
active sensing technologies, like radar or LiDAR, which emit signals and 
analyze their echoes, passive sensing relies on capturing naturally occurring

information from them. Passive sensing encompasses various modalities, 
including electromagnetic radiation (like visible light, infrared, and radio 
waves), acoustic waves (sound), thermal radiation (infrared), and chemical 
signals (such as a molecules). Each modality offers distinct insights into 
the environment and its objects. As sensor technology research and devel￾opment progress, passive sensing is anticipated to assume an increasingly 
pivotal role in facilitating smart and autonomous systems across various 
applications [30].

This technology utilizes diverse sensing modalities, such as accelerome￾ters, gyroscopes, cameras, microphones, and wearable gadgets to capture 
signals or data pertaining to human movements, interactions, or behav￾iors. These sensors may be integrated into smartphones, wearable devices, 
smart home appliances, or environmental monitoring tools [31].

Abstract
Due to the rising services offered by data centers, such as load balancing, 
auto-scaling, dynamic resource allocation, and efficient resource use, many firms 
are migrating their businesses to the cloud. Servers are considered the essential 
processing units in a data center. The growing expansion of cloud applications 
is leading to a significant rise in energy usage and increased carbon gas emis￾sions. Upon receiving a user’s request, the scheduler allocates the tasks to cloud 
resources for execution. Efficiently organizing tasks in a cloud environment poses 
a formidable challenge. Several sophisticated job schedulers exist for managing 
workflow; their architecture mostly caters to batch workflow rather than real-time 
workflow. Efficient allocation of real-time workflows to suitable virtual machines 
on a server requires implementing a dynamic workflow scheduling technique that 
effectively minimizes energy usage. This study proposes an alternative approach 
to dynamic workflow scheduling, aiming to improve the workflow schedule to 
decrease both makespan and energy usage in cloud data centers. This chapter 
introduces a novel approach that combines a Genetic Algorithm and DQN. This 
scheduler efficiently transmits dynamic workflows to the virtual machines of the 
servers. To be more specific, the scheduling of the dynamic process is divided into

two parts. First, using GA, the task’s execution scheme calculates from the time 
it arrives until the end of the execution. The second stage uses an agent in the 
DQN to determine whether or not assigning tasks to a VM instance in the cloud is 
appropriate. The energy usage is assessed based on the minimal makespan value. 
Our method was developed by integrating a Genetic Algorithm with a DQN algo￾rithm to calculate the makespan. Data collected from experiments prove that our 
approach exhibits superior performance compared to alternative dynamic work 
scheduling approaches.

5.1 Introduction
Cloud computing provides servers, storage, databases, networking, and 
software online. The services are in remote data centers and can be used 
online. Cloud providers use Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to provide 
virtualized computer resources over the Internet. Users can rent and 
operate virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networking infrastructure 
instead of buying and maintaining actual equipment. Different operating 
systems (OS) and applications can operate on the same hardware with 
virtualization. Cloud computing is used across industries due to its flex￾ibility, scalability, cost effectiveness, and accessibility. The following are 
some examples of how cloud computing is used in various businesses. 
Information Technology, Healthcare, Finance and Banking, Education, 
Retail and E-Commerce, and Manufacturing are just a few examples; 
there are many more. In cloud computing, SLA stands for Service Level 
Agreement. It is an agreement that specifies the caliber of service that a 
cloud service provider will provide to a client. SLAs usually outline the 
performance parameters to be assessed, including availability, throughput, 
uptime, and response time. These measurements aid in determining the 
level of service quality [1]. Task scheduling is allocating the appropriate 
resources for each action, such as virtual machines, containers, or server￾less compute instances. Allocating jobs or tasks to the server’s available 
resources is known as task allocation. It generates a virtual machine (VM) 
on the server based on the user’s work needs. After the user’s task is over, 
the VM is assigned to meet the needs of another user. This means that all 
resources are being used to their full potential and that none are being 
over or underutilized. Tasks are stored in the Queue. It runs the jobs using 
the Heuristic approach that we have incorporated into the scheduler. 
There are two types of tasks: homogeneous and heterogeneous. All tasks

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseEnergy System for Cloud Workflow Scheduling 123
in a homogeneous task set have the same requests and resource require￾ments. Every task in a heterogeneous task set has a variable request type, 
varying processing requirements, and varying resource requirements [2]. 
Many authors proposed heuristic approaches to task scheduling, such as 
First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin 
(RR), and nature-inspired approaches, such as Ant Colony Optimization 
Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Gray Wolf Optimization, 
Artificial Bee Colony Optimization Algorithm, and so on. However, these 
solutions do not properly solve the difficulty of scheduling dynamic jobs 
on virtual machines or allocating resources dynamically based on user job 
requests. The approach does not even handle the execution of the subopti￾mal task dependency and how they minimize metrics like makespan and 
energy usage [3]. In recent studies, researchers presented a Reinforcement 
Learning algorithm, which is a type of Artificial Intelligence algorithm that 
excels at allocating jobs to appropriate resources. Inside the Reinforcement 
Learning process, the agent operates inside an environment by executing 
actions. It transitions from one state to another state based on its actions. 
Each action state is associated with either a positive or negative reward. 
The objective of the Reinforcement Learning algorithm is to optimize the 
total accumulated reward. Q-learning is a model-free Reinforcement tech￾nique that generates a table to represent states and actions. In the context 
of Task Scheduling, the states correspond to the availability of resources, 
virtual machines (VMs), and the priority of tasks. The action, on the other 
hand, involves the allocation of tasks to the VMs [4]. The chosen action 
is carried out, and the scheduler monitors the subsequent state change 
and is given a reward signal depending on the action’s performance. The 
scheduler changes the Q-value for the chosen action in the current state by 
applying the Q-learning update rule after performing an action and moni￾toring the subsequent reward. However, Q-learning is lacking in handling 
dynamic workloads. As the number of tasks increases, the size of the Q 
table also increases, reaching a point where it becomes unable to handle 
any additional jobs. Real-time scheduling policy adaptation is difficult 
since the best course of action may change as circumstances do. Heuristic 
algorithms are important in dynamic cloud systems since standard opti￾mization techniques may not be practical due to the changing availability 
of resources, changes in workload, and shifting user demands; however, 
heuristics also have trouble locating the best answer in a dynamic cloud 
context. On the other hand, metaheuristic-based techniques, like Genetic 
Algorithms (GA), emulate natural selection to discover the best answers 
to issues by progressively evolving a group of potential solutions. Various 
authors have furnished a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that demonstrates

superior performance in load balancing, resource provisioning, and activ￾ity scheduling in comparison to current nature-stimulated meta-heuristic 
algorithms [5]. However, the Genetic Algorithm encounters challenges 
when handling fluctuating workloads and executing obligations with sub￾top-rated assignment dependency.
Recent studies have shown that the combination of Deep Learning and 
Q-gaining knowledge of algorithms is effective in managing task schedul￾ing in a Cloud Computing Environment. This method is adept at coping 
with a high extent of jobs. We are utilizing the blessings of Deep Learning 
and Genetic Algorithms to efficiently schedule dynamic workloads and 
adapt to diverse conditions [6].
This bankruptcy introduces a different method for addressing the dif￾ficulties associated with job scheduling. The GA–DQN approach is a sys￾tem for scheduling dynamic workflows that integrates the abilities of Deep 
Q-Learning (DQN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). This approach com￾bines the strength of GA and DQN to improve the rate of execution of 
responsibilities. This paintings’ number one contribution may be summed 
up as follows:
• Our proposal is a dynamic workflow scheduling system that 
integrates GA and DQN intending to optimize energy effi￾ciency and makespan in cloud computing.
• We are giving a complete demo regarding the design and 
implementation of the method, along with providing a clear 
explanation of how GA uses the behavior ion of dynamic 
workflow to accelerate efficient learning for the DQN 
manager.
• We compare our technique to various workflow scheduling 
strategies, and our experimental results indicate that it per￾forms well across various workloads.
The remaining papers are organized as follows: Section 5.2 covers exist￾ing methodologies, whereas Sections 5.3 and 5.4 detail the problem defini￾tion and proposed methodology. The simulation findings are reviewed in 
part 5.5, and the conclusion is discussed in the final part.

scheduling for incoming jobs. A method for optimizing workflow sched￾uling has the potential to enhance cloud performances, such as makespan, 
and achieve energy efficiency and is important for the ecosystem. The 
number and nature of activities being processed can vary over time, and 
dynamic task scheduling addresses these variable demands. As a result of 
the increased implementation of the Internet of Things, big data, and cloud 
platform technologies in recent years, job shops have given way to net￾worked, collaborative, and intelligent manufacturing systems. Smart man￾ufacturing scheduling differs from job shop scheduling in several ways, 
including the dynamic nature of services and uncertainties, in addition to 
the greater quantity of tasks and services. The authors analyze and provide 
a mathematical description of the smart manufacturing service schedul￾ing problem in this article. Then, a method based on deep reinforcement 
learning is suggested for reducing the maximum completion time of all 
assignments. The system architecture of the proposed method includes the 
design of the agent, environment, and interaction. The system state is deter￾mined by the queue times of all candidate services, with the target value 
being the utmost queue time at the present moment [7]. However, these 
techniques might be too time consuming and computationally demanding 
for dynamic workflow scheduling. One of the key elements that impact 
cloud computing performance is task scheduling, which is essential to the 
system. The dynamic task-scheduling problem has garnered global interest 
due to many factors such as the expanding information processing indus￾try and the growing demand for quality of service (QoS) in networking. 
Task scheduling has been identified as an NP-hard problem due to its 
complexity. Furthermore, the majority of dynamic online task schedul￾ing frequently handles jobs in a complicated environment, which makes 
it much harder to strike a balance and reap the rewards of every cloud 
computing feature. In this research, the authors [8] present a new artificial 
intelligence system that combines the benefits of a deep neural network 
and the Q-learning algorithm, which we term deep Q-learning task sched￾uling (DQTS). The goal of this novel method is to address the challenge 
of managing directed acyclic graph (DAG) workloads in cloud computing 
settings. The technique is based on the widely used deep Q-learning (DQL) 
method in task scheduling, where DQL serves as a major inspiration for 
core model learning. The dependency between sub-tasks must be consid￾ered in workflow scheduling, which is not addressed.
A hybrid meta-heuristic optimization approach was given in this paper 
to reduce the overall execution time of processes operating on hetero￾geneous cloud platforms. The author [9] explains the technique com￾bined two optimization trends as follows: global and local, respectively,

thermodynamic simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. Both algo￾rithms thereby compensate for each other’s flaws. The crossover in GA 
searches the search space worldwide, while the unique procedures in the 
proposed TSA efficiently permute search space by enhancing existing 
methods. Based on the quality of the solutions obtained during the anneal￾ing process, the TSA uses concepts from information theory and thermo￾dynamics to reduce temperature. The simulation results demonstrate the 
hybrid GATSA’s advantage over other state-of-the-art when compared to 
the average values of scheduling assessment metrics. Additionally, the sug￾gested GATSA demonstrates its adaptability to many applications by lever￾aging exploitation with multiple walking about algorithms, each of which 
may be called at random, and benefiting from experiments with crossover 
operator and arbitrary mutation operator. However, it is lacking in show￾ing brilliant performance in scheduling tasks when compared with existing 
approaches. Because of the “pay for use” paradigm, cloud computing sys￾tems are widely used by clients to access cloud resources. However, because 
of the large number of resources and the amount of user requests, schedul￾ing and energy consumption have become major challenges for these sys￾tems. This subject has been extensively studied. Reducing makespan is the 
primary objective of a timetable, which is a means of allocating resources 
to users. The energy problem has received less consideration in the major￾ity of cloud system scheduling techniques, and in some techniques that 
have been tuned for energy consumption, the makespan has grown. For 
instance, the Hybrid GA algorithm is an energy-efficient scheduling 
technique for dependent jobs; yet, despite the interdependence of tasks, 
primary chromosome manufacturing and scheduling have not been car￾ried out to the best of their abilities. Not every conceivable combination 
to complete a task is taken into account by the ECS (Energy-Conscious 
Scheduling) algorithm. Thus, scheduling methods that maximize energy 
and time savings are preferable. The goal of this study is to save time and 
energy by presenting a two-step method called GAECS. Here, the author 
[10] employed the GA to generate optimal schedules and three ranking 
algorithms to generate the major chromosomes in the proposed GAECS 
method and also optimized the resource distribution to processors using 
the energy-conscious ECS algorithm. The GAECS method generates the 
first three primary chromosomes using three different prioritizing algo￾rithms. The GA then receives the primary chromosomes, and the GA 
completes the primary population. Better chromosomes are then chosen 
using the established crossover and mutation operators, and last, the best 
chromosomes in terms of time and energy are chosen and allocated to 
resources. The GAECS has a better makespan and energy usage, according

5.3 Dynamic Workflow Scheduling System
This section presents the fundamental cloud scheduling system architec￾ture and explains the dynamic workflow scheduling model.
5.3.1 System Architecture
Job scheduling in the cloud involves distributing computing resources and 
organizing tasks or jobs to make the most optimal use of the resources in 
cloud computing settings. It entails overseeing the implementation of dif￾ferent computational tasks or jobs supplied by users or applications, ensur￾ing they are executed promptly, utilizing resources efficiently, and reaching 
specific performance goals. Virtual machines (VMs) are generated via vir￾tualization, which abstracts and virtualizes physical hardware resources to 
produce numerous isolated instances of virtualized computing environ￾ments. Transferring a user job to a virtual machine in the cloud includes 
deploying the VM, transferring the job files, executing the job on the VM’s 
operating system, and monitoring the job’s progress and resource usage.
Figure 5.1 illustrates a basic architecture of the cloud job scheduling 
framework. The basic idea of job scheduling is that there are n number 
of users, each with n number of requests (tasks). All of these jobs are sub￾mitted to a scheduler. Depending on the nature of the user’s employment, 
we normally recommend this form of scheduler. Every scheduler includes

a built-in task manager, whose function is to prioritize tasks depending 
on requests. In host environments, each host is made up of many virtual 
machines. A virtual machine monitor in the host environment assigns 
tasks to the virtual machine based on their requirements. Each virtual 
machine has its own resources and computing power. In this task schedul￾ing, we focus on optimizing makespan. The term “makespan” denotes the 
overall duration required to finish a specific set of activities or jobs under 
a particular scheduling context. It signifies the time from the initiation of 
the initial job/task to the conclusion of the final job/task in the workload. 
The objective of this study is to minimize the duration of the makespan. 
Makespan refers to the whole duration required to finish the execution of 
a job starting from the moment it enters the queue until it is executed on 
the virtual machine (VM). Increased energy consumption occurs when a 
job spends more time in the queue, is not appropriately provisioned with 
resources, or is not allocated a suitable virtual machine.
When determining the makespan, the evaluation of execution time is 
crucial as it measures the duration of a task running on a specific virtual 
machine (VM). The computation of the execution time for a task on a cer￾tain virtual machine (VM) is determined using the subsequent equation.

Tasks are allocated to a virtual machine (VM) from the task queue

5.3.2 Genetic Algorithm for Dynamic Workflow Scheduling
In the context of the Genetic Algorithm, a schedule is represented by a 
chromosome, which signifies both the job and the assigned resources. 
Every chromosome is composed of genes.
Each schedule is evaluated using a fitness function, which determines 
how effectively it meets optimization goals such as lowering makespan 
or cost. Solutions with higher fitness values are chosen for replication 
utilizing methods such as roulette wheel or tournament selection.

Selected schedules are merged to produce child schedules via a cross￾over, which exchanges genetic information between the parents. During 
the mutation phase, random adjustments are made to offspring schedules 
to retain diversity and seek novel solutions. Offspring schedules replace 
older ones in the population via techniques such as generational replace￾ment. The algorithm terminates when a termination condition is met, such 
as reaching a maximum number of generations or obtaining a satisfying

solution. The best schedule(s) are selected from the final population and 
executed in the cloud environment [11].
The basic idea demonstrated in Figure 5.2 is that core phases of the 
Genetic Algorithm are the same because it adapts to each type of appli￾cation. We use a Genetic Algorithm to solve the task scheduling problem. 
In the first phase, we are initializing tasks. In the second phase, the fitness 
value of each virtual machine is determined. The fitness value of a virtual 
machine aids in assigning jobs to relevant resources. This process will con￾tinue until all of the tasks have been assigned to appropriate resources, 
when the number of iterations has been completed and there are no more 
tasks that require resource allocation.
5.3.3 Deep Q-Learning for Dynamic Workflow Scheduling
The state of the environment represents the current state of the workflow 
scheduling problem. This could provide details about the current task, its 
dependencies, available resources, and their use. The agent (scheduler) 
chooses an action based on the present situation. Each action represents 
either allocating a job to a specified resource for execution or deferring 
its execution. The agent learns to make judgments by keeping a Q table or 
employing a deep neural network to approximate Q-values. Q-values indi￾cate the predicted cumulative payoff for performing a specific activity in 
a given state. The agent balances the exploration of novel actions with the 
exploitation of old activities by employing an exploration method known 
as epsilon-greedy, in which actions are randomly selected with a proba￾bility epsilon. A reward is granted to the agent for every activity under￾taken by the agent. In the perspective of workflow scheduling, rewards 
may be based on job completion time, resourcefulness usage, cost, or 
service quality. The agent interacts with its environment, selects activities, 
observes rewards, and updates Q-values to match those observations. This 
process continues over many episodes, and the agent gets to improve its 
decision-making ability. To improve sampling efficiency and stability, DQL 
frequently uses experience replay. This entails storing experiences (state, 
action, reward, and next state) in a replay buffer and randomly sampling 
from it while training. To stabilize training, a separate target network is 
periodically updated with the primary Q-network’s weights. Training con￾tinues until convergence or a predetermined stopping criterion is satis￾fied, such as completing a maximum number of episodes or reaching a 
sufficient level of performance. Once trained, the agent can apply its learnt 
policy to make real-time scheduling decisions by choosing behaviors that 
maximize projected cumulative rewards [12].

Q-learning is an influential technique in reinforcement learning that 
operates without requiring prior knowledge of the current system. It relies 
on a Q-function, which stores pairs of two states indicated by a q(S, A) 
and actions indicating the quality of taking an action in a given state. This 
function is updated iteratively using a specific equation.
q S A q S A re maximum q S A q S A tt tt t a t t t t ( , ) ( , ) [ (  , ) ( , )] 1
where σ is the rate of learning, and its value is in between (0,1). ret is the 
reward for taking action, i.e., At for state St
. £ is the discount factor, and its 
value lies in between (0,1).
Figure 5.3 depicts the distribution of tasks to appropriate resources 
using a combination of Q-learning and Deep Learning.
Action Space
In the context of work, the action space pertains to the n number of vir￾tual machines (VMs) previously mentioned. Incoming requests are first 
directed to the task manager, whereupon each task’s priority is computed. 
Subsequently, the scheduler, equipped with a DQN model, makes deci￾sions based on these priorities and assigns tasks to an execution queue 
accordingly. Finally, the scheduler’s decisions dictate the execution of tasks 
on the VMs, in alignment with the order of tasks in the queue and their 
respective priorities. Thus, the action space within our model is delineated 
as described [13].

5.3.4 Energy Consumption for Dynamic Workflow 
Scheduling [14]
Our current emphasis is on reducing energy consumption within the cloud 
computing paradigm, which stands as a significant and impactful met￾ric. With the processing of extensive workloads necessitating substantial 
infrastructure or cloud resources, there is a resultant increase in energy 
consumption and CO2
 emissions adversely affecting the environment. 
Thus, our focus is directed toward minimizing energy consumption within 
the cloud paradigm. In the cloud model, energy consumption is contin￾gent upon the utilization of computing time and idle time. For a virtual 
machine (VM), energy consumption is computed according to the follow￾ing equation:

5.4 Problem Formulation and Proposed 
System Architecture
In dynamic situations, new tasks can arrive unexpectedly disrupting the 
existing schedule. Genetic Algorithms may struggle to efficiently change the 
present schedule to accommodate new jobs resulting in a longer makespan. 
To decrease makespan, Genetic Algorithms must be able to adapt swiftly 
to dynamic changes in their environment. However, Genetic Algorithms’ 
slow convergence and the time necessary to explore and exploit new solu￾tions may limit their capacity to respond effectively to quick changes in 
task requirements or resource availability. In the DQN algorithm, the ini￾tial step involves creating a Q table that contains the states and correspond￾ing actions for each task. The values in the Q table are derived using the 
Genetic Algorithm and represent the optimal values for scheduling tasks. 
The Q table values are evaluated using the Deep Learning network. When 
the tasks are not provided with adequate resources, the network under￾goes training until all tasks are appropriately assigned to resources that 
are well-suited to meet the user’s requests. The system can attain an equi￾librium between exploration (Genetic Algorithm) and exploitation (deep 
Q-network) leading to enhanced convergence in discovering the optimal 
solution and improving performance.
5.4.1 Hybrid Approach
The objective of task scheduling in cloud computing is to minimize the 
makespan, which is the total time needed to finish all jobs. This includes

both the time spent doing tasks and any possible waiting time caused by 
resource contention or schedule delays. As was said before, you should 
begin by utilizing GA to initialize a population of task schedules. Every 
single person in the population represents a prospective task schedule, and 
the allocations of tasks to virtual machines are encoded. The makespan 
method, which was discussed before, should be used to evaluate the appro￾priateness of each job schedule in the population. The population of task 
schedules can be evolved through the application of selection, crossover, 
and mutation processes, which will result in the generation of new task 
schedules that may have lower makespan values. Through the use of rein￾forcement learning, a DQN model should be trained to discover the most 
effective task scheduling. As input, the DQN collects the current state of the 
task scheduling problem, which includes tasks, virtual machines (VMs), 
and the current assignment. It then produces an action such as determin￾ing which task should be assigned to which VM. It is necessary to define 
the reward function, the state space, and the action space for the DQN. The 
action space is a representation of the many decisions that could be made 
about the assignment of tasks, while the state space contains information 
about the existing work schedule including the surroundings. The DQN 
receives feedback from the reward function, which does so depend on the 
quality of the work schedules that are generated. Training the DQN can be 
accomplished through simulation in a cloud computing environment or 
through the use of historical data on job scheduling. To stabilize training 
approaches, such as experience replay and target network, updates can be 
utilized. During the execution of the Genetic Algorithm, the trained DQN 
model should be used to guide the selection of task assignments rather 
than the conventional genetic operators [15].
The architecture of GA–DQN includes a crucial component known 
as the replay buffer. This buffer is responsible for storing all relevant past 
information, such as the allocation of tasks to virtual machines, the status 
of each virtual machine, and the distinction between idle and busy vir￾tual machines. By utilizing this stored data, the system can make appro￾priate decisions when a new job is received effectively assigning tasks to 
the most relevant resources and efficiently managing the changing work￾load [16].
Figure 5.4 depicts a hybrid strategy for allocating tasks to resources that 
uses GA–DQN to handle dynamic workflow. This integrated technique 
aims to generate work plans that effectively minimize makespan compared 
to the approach utilizing individual algorithms.

5.4.2 Implementation of GA
For every incoming workflow, we encode the execution plan utilizing a 
topology sorting approach. Specifically, we employ anti-topological sort￾ing to generate random execution sequences for the sub-tasks initially 
ensuring that each solution respects the dependencies among these sub￾tasks. Following this, we randomly allocate a CPU core to each sub-task 
within each sequence, treating these sequences as individuals in a Genetic 
Algorithm (GA).

Here, t1, t2 , ……. t11 are sub-tasks of the workflow. p1, p2, p3 are CPU 
cores.
By generating individuals at random, it is possible to acquire a popula￾tion that is defined as:
P I I I i m { , , , } 1 2
We employ the execution time of instances of individuals as the fitness 
function in the initial population and choose members for crossover and 
mutation. For selection purposes, candidates with shorter execution times 
are favored. In the course of evolution, the crossover operation is initiated

by arbitrarily selecting an identical position between two sequences fol￾lowed by the exchange of chromosomes (sub-tasks) positioned to the left 
of this specific position. Then, in the order of the original individuals, each 
individual is traversed, with each subtask not present in the new section 
being sequentially placed on the right. This procedure ensures that the new 
individuals can be considered viable solutions. After the crossover opera￾tion, for instance, the individuals denoted in equation can be represented 
as follows:
I t k p t p t p t p t p t p t p ’ {( , ), ( , ), ( , ), ( , ), ( , ), ( , ), ( , 21 13 61 5 2 9 3 3 1 4 2 8 2

The exchange portion is denoted by an underline in this instance. In the 
mutation operation, conversely, every individual possesses a specific likeli￾hood of arbitrarily perturbing the sequence of execution. In particular, an 
individual’s position between the sub-tasks that are closest to their prede￾cessor and successor is altered by a random sub-task, which also causes a 
random change in the primary choice.
5.5 Simulation Set-Up and Experimental Results
This section discusses the simulation findings of our effort. The entire 
simulation runs on a CloudSim simulator. We chose our datasets with 
various distributions. In our chapter, we first took different datasets and 
arranged them so that tasks had distinct distributions, which were then 
put into the scheduler. The dataset distributions are classified as follows: 
uniform, normal, left-, and right-skewed distributions. All of these data￾sets have uniform, normal, left- and right-skewed distributions, denoted 
as d1, d2, d3, and d4. When it comes to task scheduling, a uniform distri￾bution may be used to depict situations in which tasks have comparable 
needs for resources. For instance, tasks may follow a uniform distribution 
if they arrive at random and have comparable computation requirements 
or deadlines. Platforms for cloud computing frequently manage several 
requests or tasks from various users or applications at once. No matter

how the underlying distribution of individual task times is distributed, the 
Central Limit Theorem holds when there are a lot of tasks, and the distri￾bution of task execution times tends to become normal. The distribution 
of task execution durations may be left skewed if most tasks performed in 
the cloud environment are brief or have little computational complexity. 
A distribution is said to be right skewed, or positively skewed if its bigger 
values on the right side are more extended than its smaller values on the 
left side. A right-skewed distribution may suggest that most tasks in the 
cloud computing setting have longer execution durations, whereas fewer 
activities have shorter execution times. We utilize these distributions to 
test how our algorithm performs with various types of tasks. We compared 
our GA–DQN against known algorithms such as RR, FCFS, Priority-Based 
Scheduling, Deadline-Based Scheduling, and DRTSA.

that the various distribution of tasks is completed fast with the GA-DQN

configuration parameters to analyze the makespan of tasks, and our GA–

assessed energy consumption using these datasets. We did 100 iterations 
to compare our results to baseline algorithms such as RR, FCFS, Priority￾Based Scheduling, Deadline-Based Scheduling, and DRLBA.
Table 5.3 describes the datasets d1, d2, d3, and d4, as well as the number

5.6 Conclusion
Due to task heterogeneity, scheduling different workloads over a cloud 
presents a difficult problem. For scheduling in a cloud context, several 
writers presented different algorithm approaches for mapping the process 
to virtual machines (VMs). This chapter contains our algorithm’s demon￾stration. The process of assigning jobs to virtual machines (VMs) in the 
cloud is extremely dynamic requiring that numerous tasks be assigned 
to resources that accurately match their processing capacities. Energy 
consumption in cloud computing for makespan in data centers for task 
scheduling pertains to the quantity of electrical energy needed to supply 
electricity and maintain the temperature of the infrastructure utilized to 
carry out computational tasks in a cloud environment. The primary objec￾tive is to minimize the makespan. We suggested a GA–DQN network in 
this chapter to address dynamic scheduling issues in cloud environments. 
We have run simulations using CloudSim and fed fabricated datasets into 
the algorithm. It performs well in terms of cutting down on makespan and 
energy usage. Our algorithms have been tested using RR, FCFS, PBS, DBS, 
and DRTSA. There were 100 iterations of the simulation. When compared 
to baseline techniques, our suggested approach performs admirably. In the 
future, we must implement GA–DQN in real-time workloads and assess 
our scheduler’s effectiveness.

Abstract
In the current environment, data generation and data transmission are increasing 
exponentially in day-to-day life. These exponentially growing data might create 
heavy traffic when transmitted between systems. Also, this affects many function￾alities like configuration of networked systems, system and routing configuration 
parameters, load managing factors of network devices, etc. A dynamic traffic control 
mechanism needs to be adopted with the help of load-balancing algorithms and effi￾cient resource allocation mechanisms to deal with heavy data traffic. Load balanc￾ing algorithms in networked sensing systems aim to distribute the workload evenly 
among sensor nodes to optimize network performance and energy efficiency and 
prolong the network lifetime. Resource allocation mechanisms in a networked sens￾ing system involve allocating and distributing network resources efficiently, such as 
energy, bandwidth, processing power, etc., to optimize performance and increase 
the network’s lifetime. To achieve efficient resource allocation with a balanced load, 
notable works have been done in optimization and machine learning. The work 
gives a scientific analysis of traditional and Artificial Intelligence algorithms from a 
centralized and distributed perspective. Researchers can take this analysis forward 
when deciding on algorithms based on their application and infrastructural needs.

In the recent era, data generation and transmission are enormous in num￾ber in all the networked sensing systems and devices such as Wireless 
Sensor Networks (WSN), Software Defined Networks (SDN), and Internet 
of Things (IoT). A WSN is a self-reconfigurable, autonomous sensor device 
connected by a radio receiver channel to a base station. A Wireless Sensor 
Network suite comprises sensor nodes deployed in an unattended envi￾ronment [1]. A sensor acts as an interface in the deployed device that pro￾vides information on a managed resource’s state and state transitions. The 
wireless sensor network consists of spatially disseminated self-governing 
sensors, which are used to sense, monitor the scenario, and communi￾cate different types of data to the destination where it gets connected. In 
the huge deployment, sharing load among all the devices, which get con￾nected, is a very challenging task [2]. The load balancing with the cloud 
environment is shown in Figure 6.1.
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) carry a lot of promise in applications 
[3] where gathering sensed information in remote or inaccessible locations 
is demanded. In WSNs, the routing communication protocol is application 
dependent, and their pattern goals might change depending on different 
applications [4]. To consider with an example, a firefighter might expect 
well-timed temperature readings for awareness of the current situation 
and to act accordingly. In contrast, applications like soil monitoring, might 
demand temperature data in a few hours once in a day. Consequently,

routing protocols should meet the requirements with bare minimal cost. 
Hence, the load balancing and routing protocol algorithms have to con￾sider the features of sensor devices along with the application and archi￾tectural requirements [5].
Most of the reexamined clustering protocols (ex., C-LEACH, M-LEACH, 
HEED, etc.) are application specific [6]. Such protocols demand flexible 
fundamental alterations to assemble the diversity of operations and mal￾functioning necessaries committed by the applications. Consequently, 
deciding an appropriate balanced communication protocol for a particular 
concern is highly diplomatic since formulating the load-balanced cluster￾ing will remain a challenge if the sensor nodes increase, and measures are 
to be taken to optimize its functioning by fixing the routing metrics. In this 
chapter, the following topics are taken into consideration and discussed 
further:
• Understanding the Load Balancing Challenges
• Efficient Resource Allocation Strategy
• Overview of Existing Approaches
• Artificial Intelligence for Resource Handling
• Real-World Applications
• Performance Evaluation Metrics
• Future Directions and Emerging Trends
• Conclusion and Summary
6.2 Understanding the Load Balancing Challenges
In critical traffic, congestion, and unavoidable situations, a better mecha￾nism is required to handle sensor devices [7]. So, there is a demand to pat￾tern the communication protocol to act under eminent pressured network 
situations such as vital network situations, admitting over-crowding and 
collisions. This can occur for various reasons such as interference, miser￾able link quality, and mobility. During this situation, the balanced routing 
protocol necessitates acquiring and qualifying the most estimable com￾bination of routing to execute the information transmission seamlessly. 
Nevertheless, it is hard to determine routing without regarding the suc￾ceeding measure heuristic of the network kinetics. Therefore, the routing 
establishes redesign with the capability of managing the network kinetics, 
including data retransmission. Load balancing in a network is of para￾mount importance because of the following challenges:

 ii. Heterogeneity of Sensor Nodes and Data
 iii. Dynamic Environmental Conditions
 iv. Energy Efficiency and Power Constraints
 v. Communication Overhead and Latency
 vi. Quality of Service (QoS) Requirements
 vii. Security and Privacy Concerns
 viii. Impact of Mobility and Node Failures
Sensing Networks can be established from small scale to large scale 
depending on the application requirements, and the algorithm should be 
designed to accommodate a node count of 100 or 1,000. Accordingly, the 
generated data might also increase in volume and energy deplete sooner 
if the sensors are not placed at an optimized distance. In this case, opti￾mized distance among sensing devices ensures load balancing and energy 
efficiency [8]. Different applications with sensors might generate different 
types of data, and to represent them in a generic way, data heterogene￾ity needs to be given attention. Sensing systems should be designed and 
tested in different environmental conditions, but if they are deployed in an 
area that is entirely different from the tested conditions, then the sensing 
devices may not be expected to collect data evenly and efficiently utilize 
resources.
Initial communication establishment is essential; unexpected node fail￾ure due to power depletion might increase the packet delay. Also, node 
failure might increase the number of retransmissions, which creates com￾munication overhead. Node failure, traffic due to congestion, power deple￾tion, connectivity issues, etc., lead to compromise in the quality of service. 
When nodes are moving, they might be attached to different base stations 
from time to time, and tracing data is another challenge in addition to 
mobility issues. While transmitting data from one device to another, data 
privacy is quintessential, and vulnerability issues, threats, trojan horses, 
viruses, and worms play a major role in compromising data security and 
privacy.
6.2.1 Types of Load Balancing
Application Load Balancing
Many server farms with numerous servers devoted to a single applica￾tion function are used in complex modern applications. To reroute traf￾fic, application load balancers examine the content of the request, such as 
HTTP headers or SSL session IDs. An e-commerce program comprises a

shopping cart, checkout area, and product directory. Requests for brows￾ing items are sent to servers holding photos and videos via the application 
load balancer eliminating the need for open connections. In contrast, it 
routes requests for shopping carts to servers that can sustain numerous 
client connections and store cart data indefinitely.
Network Load Balancing
Network load balancers look up IP addresses and other network informa￾tion to optimally divert traffic. Network load balancers search IP addresses 
and other information to reroute traffic optimally. They can pinpoint the 
source of the application traffic and supply several servers with static IP 
addresses. Network load balancers use the previously mentioned static and 
dynamic load balancing strategies to balance server load.
Global Server Load Balancing
Multiple geographically separated servers are involved in the global server 
load-balancing procedure. For example, companies may have servers 
across many data centers, international borders, and third-party cloud pro￾viders. In this case, the application load inside a zone or area is managed by 
local load balancers. They attempt to redirect traffic to a server destination 
that is nearer to the client’s location. Only servers outside the client’s geo￾graphic area may be used to reroute traffic in the event of a server failure.
DNS Load Balancing
When people utilize DNS load balancing, the domain could be configured 
to split up network requests among several resources on the requested 
domain. A website, mail server, print server, or any other internet-based 
service can all be associated with a domain. Maintaining application avail￾ability and distributing network traffic among a globally dispersed pool of 
resources are two benefits of DNS load balancing.
6.2.2 Load Balancing Technologies
There are different types of load balancing technologies taken into consid￾eration, which include software and hardware balancers.
Hardware Load Balancers
A hardware appliance known as a hardware-based load balancer can safely 
process and reroute gigabytes of data to hundreds of distinct servers. It can 
be kept in your data centers, and you can utilize virtualization to make sev￾eral digital or virtual load balancers that you can control centrally.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License150 Networked Sensing Systems
Software Load Balancers
Applications that handle all aspects of load balancing are known as 
software-based load balancers. They can be accessed as a fully managed 
third-party service or installed on any host.
Comparison of the Balancers
Hardware load balancers must be configured, maintained, and invested in. 
You might not employ them to their maximum potential, particularly if 
you buy one solely to handle traffic spikes during peak hours. Users will 
be impacted if traffic volume unexpectedly climbs beyond capacity until 
another load balancer can be purchased and installed.
Software-based load balancers, on the other hand, offer far greater flexi￾bility. They are more compatible with contemporary cloud computing sys￾tems and are easier to scale up or down. Over time, they also cost less to 
use, maintain, and set up.
6.3 Importance of Efficient Resource Allocation
Sensor nodes in the WSN are deployed without following any infrastruc￾ture, and the nodes will be active while sensing the data and become inac￾tive for the remaining period of time. Since sensor nodes are generally 
power constrained, the node’s lifetime can be prolonged by applying differ￾ent techniques in addition to the previous characteristics.
Noticeably, sensor node energy consumption is highly dependent on 
application and it is application specific, the significant role played by the 
node-level, and network-level architectures. The following measures might 
reduce the consumption of energy during communication in WSN
• To schedule sensing and the sleep, idle state among the sen￾sor head and sensor nodes
• Adjusting the range of transmission among the sensor head 
and sensor nodes
• Adopting efficient routing as well as efficient data-collecting 
mechanism
• Unwanted data gathering is to be avoided, as in the case of 
overhearing.
Based on the above steps, numerous algorithms came into play to 
reduce the consumption of energy in WSN, but on the other hand, effi￾ciency of data gathering should be negotiated to achieve network lifetime.

Hence, this tradeoff should be addressed with existing techniques, and the 
efficiency of the resources should be analyzed.
6.4 Overview of Existing Approaches
There are various types of clustering algorithms presented, but these algo￾rithms are primarily divided into two different categories based on the clus￾ter head selection process and even the distribution of resources. They are 
probabilistic and non-probabilistic clustering. In the existing approaches, 
like HEED, PEGASIS, GAF, and SPIN, the sensing devices and other net￾work resources are utilized to ensure energy efficiency [9]. A virtual grid 
structure in HEED is framed based on the deployment area, and each grid 
is considered a cluster.
6.4.1 Probabilistic Clustering
In this technique, each sensor has to determine the cluster heads initially 
based on the probability. Assigning probabilities to each sensor node is 
the main criterion for deciding the cluster heads during their election 
process. The secondary criterion may be residual, initial, and average net￾work energy. Even though these are highly energy efficient, the cluster￾ing algorithms usually achieve faster execution and reduce the volume of 
exchanged messages [10]. Some of its algorithms are as follows:
LEACH
LEACH, abbreviated as Low-Energy Adaptative Clustering Hierarchy, is 
considered as one of the dynamic approaches in clustering. It uses a hier￾archical routing technique that routes the packets in a multi-hop fashion. 
It follows TDMA-based MAC protocol. The major goal of the LEACH is to 
dynamically fix the clusters, improve energy conservation, which, in turn, 
improves the duration of the network. Reducing the traffic by aggregating 
the whole data collected from cluster head and saving energy using sin￾gle hop routing are some of the main advantages of the LEACH protocol. 
But it does not give any idea about the number of clusters framed in the 
network area. In addition, the clusters are divided randomly based on the 
probability resulting in an uneven distribution of clusters.
HEED
HEED is a Distributed, Energy Efficient Hybrid protocol mainly used for 
even size of Clustering. HEED protocol is intended to split the geographical

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License152 Networked Sensing Systems
area in a virtual grid-based structure, and cluster head is elected based on 
the energy level and transmission range of the nodes within that cluster. 
HEED aims to increase the network lifespan by providing distributed 
energy consumption and minimizing control overheads. It provides a 
compact cluster with well-distributed cluster heads. However, the random 
selection of the cluster heads may cause higher communication overhead, 
and the periodic cluster head election also requires some energy dissipa￾tion [11].
UCR
UCR stands for unequal-cluster-based routing protocol. In this, the cluster 
size is smaller near the sink node and are gradually larger when clusters are 
farthest from the sink. It encourages the communication in inter-clusters 
when nearer to the sink and intra-cluster nodes when farther. This might 
eliminate the current hot spot issue and can maintain balanced commu￾nication. On the other hand, the geographical size, the number of nodes 
nearer and far away from the sensor nodes, and the shape of the cluster, 
etc., might vary, and these are entirely dependent on application specific.
EECS
EECS is an Efficient Clustering protocol, which is mainly implemented for 
optimizing energy consumption. It mainly focuses on the initial cluster 
formation. The weighted probability in each node is then calculated to find 
its nearby cluster-head within the cluster. Three parameters were consid￾ered to calculate the weighted probability, which includes current energy 
availability, difference between the current and the initial energy level, and 
the distance from the member node to the cluster-head. In this scheme, the 
initial communication and framing the clusters itself consume a consider￾able amount of energy and creates little overhead. This protocol takes more 
time for clustering and unequal-sized cluster formation [12].
6.4.2 Non-Probability Clustering
These types of clustering algorithms help to select the head node of the 
cluster and also the formation of clustering in a more precise way. The 
selection depends on the proximity of sensing a node, position, and geo￾graphical location. The data trans-receiving process focuses on the nearby 
nodes rather than the probability-based collection. It has the worst time 
complexity due to the graphs’ traversing and many message exchanges. 
However, it is more reliable considering the energy transmission power 
and mobility factor, which achieves more generalized goals [13].

PEGASIS
Efficient gathering of data from sensors and information systems without 
losing power is achieved by the protocol named PEGASIS. The main aim 
of this protocol is to frame a chain sequence among the nodes instead of 
randomly selecting the head node in a scheduled time period to balance 
the energy consumption. This can be accomplished by using the greedy 
approach starting from any of the sensor node, which gets located near the 
sink. Since each node gets connected with its previous and the next node, 
the data loss due to the dead node can be avoided. But, on the other hand, 
to identify the location of the sensor node to find the neighbor nodes is a 
quite challenging task in a small-size to medium-size sensing node deploy￾ment and may not be possible to adopt to a larger scale. For a small-scale 
network, reconstructing the chain is possible, and it uses hierarchical net￾work with maximum power utilization, and it also has low overhead.
TEEN
TEEN is one of the energy-efficient, sensitive threshold-based networking 
protocol mainly used in the hierarchical network. It does not send the data 
periodically; instead, it sends only when there is an extreme change in the 
sensor values. To identify this, this protocol sets a threshold limit based on 
the applications the sensors are deployed in, like an event based or time or 
any specific value-based decision. The cluster framing and the initial com￾munication to find the members within the cluster is the same as the LEACH 
protocol. When sensors sense data that are beyond the threshold or lesser 
than the threshold limit, they broadcast data to their nearby members until 
they reach the sink. Even though the energy consumption for frequent trans￾mission is reduced, this broadcasting consumes more energy and might not 
provide a balanced energy consumption. It has high overhead [14].
SPIN
SPIN is one of the negotiation protocols used for collecting sensed infor￾mation. It considers a flat network and creates a meta data with the actual 
data received from the network and transmits the meta data to the neigh￾bors. In contains the message description in addition to the data that the 
sensor wants to communicate over the network. SPIN uses limited power. 
It reduces both the network overhead and the energy consumption during 
the transmission [15].
ACQUIRE
ACQUIRE stands for Active Query Forwarding in Sensor Networks. This 
protocol concentrates highly on how easily and quickly data is retrieved

through a set of sub queries instead of posting a complex query. This pro￾tocol encourages the sensing system to request and collect whichever the 
data are required for that particular time limit. So, all the sensed data are 
not going to be transmitted, which, in turn, reduces energy usage. Based 
on the currently available information, the sink responds to the requested 
node instead of transmitting to the whole network. If, on the other hand, 
the available data are not updated properly, then this protocol collects the 
information from neighbor nodes within a specified number of hop count. 
It uses a low amount of power since the information transmission is sent 
only between the sink and the sensing node. It requires low overhead, and 
it performs complex queries also [16, 17].
All the discussed probabilistic and non-probabilistic protocols are try￾ing to allocate and utilize the resources wisely so that the network load gets 
balanced without compromising much on energy and/or power consump￾tion issues. All these protocols are compared against a few parameters to 
ensure network load balancing and are given clearly in Table 6.1.
6.5 Artificial Intelligence for Resource Handing
Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are extremely effective for Networked 
Sensing Systems in controlling resource allocation and load balancing. 
These systems, which are widely used in fields, including environmental 
monitoring, healthcare, and industrial automation, usually require real￾time data processing and decision making. Technologies pertaining to 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), namely, machine learning and also deep learn￾ing, can recognize patterns, predict trends, and analyze large amounts of 
data. Through the dynamic allocation of resources, such as network band￾width along with processing power, to different activities and nodes, the 
system is able to respond and perform at its peak. Artificial Intelligence 
strategies are critical apparatuses for guaranteeing the reliability and via￾bility of arranged detecting frameworks since they are likewise entirely 
adaptable to changing client necessities and organization conditions [18].
AI, support learning, and prescient examination are a couple of instances 
of computer-based intelligence calculations that help with handling infor￾mation as indicated by client prerequisites, framework measurements, 
and organization traffic. Utilizing past and current organization infor￾mation likewise assists the arranged detecting framework with coming to 
conclusions about asset assignment and burden adjusting. A number of 
factors, including workload characteristics, node capacity, and network 
state, ensure that decisions about load balancing are made effectively.

Furthermore, it is able to progressively acclimate to stack adjusting tech￾niques to ensure powerful work appropriation among hubs. This ensures 
efficient utilization of the resources like storage, network bandwidth, com￾putation resources, etc. On the other hand, tasks are accomplished in a 
distributed manner based on priority [19].
The key components of AI-based load balancing and resource allocation 
are continuous monitoring and feedback. The performance metrics and 
feedback are evaluated continuously by the network sensing system. This 
helps update the decisions over time based on the approach’s effectiveness. 
It also efficiently assesses the performance of the system. Hence, integrat￾ing AI in load balancing and resource allocation in networked sensing sys￾tems improves the system’s performance, efficiency, and responsiveness. 
Automating these AI processes ensures dynamic decision making leading 
to effective resource utilization.

Figure 6.2 illustrates the load balancing and resource allocation processes 
using AI. As shown, AI-driven load balancing and resource allocation can 
be used to enhance the performance of the network sensing system, which 
leads to effective utilization and responsiveness of the sensing system [20]. 
Several AI algorithms can be used to improve the efficiency of the applica￾tions. The different algorithms used are illustrated in Figure 6.3.
Depending on the application, they can be a simple ML algorithm or a 
complex neural network. Some of the algorithms are described in detail as 
follows.
6.5.1 Naïve Bayes
These classifiers are efficient when the data dimensionality is high and the 
features are independent of each other. A simple implementation of the 
same is given as follows [21]:
Define the features and labels
# Features: Each row represents a node, and each column represents a feature
# Labels: The load of each node
features = [[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]
labels = [1, 2, 1, 3]
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_
size=0.2, random_state=42)
# Train the Naive Bayes model
model = GaussianNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Make predictions on the testing set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f “Accuracy: {accuracy}”)
6.5.2 Multi-Class SVM
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a potent category of supervised 
learning algorithms suitable for both regression and classification appli￾cations. To support several classes, the fundamental SVM technique is 
extended by Multi-Class Support Vector Machines or MCSVMs. A sample 
implementation is given as follows [22]:

# Make predictions on the testing set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f “Accuracy: {accuracy}”)
6.5.3 AdaBoost
A set of weak classifiers are combined together to form a robust classifier 
with better accuracy. The loss function minimizer also performs better as 
it is formed from a hybrid algorithm. The sample working of the algorithm 
is given below [23]:
#Each row represents a node, and each column represents a feature
# Labels: The load of each node
features = [Sample data]
labels = [sample labels]

# Make predictions on the testing set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f “Accuracy: {accuracy}”)
6.5.4 Clustering
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a straightforward, occurrence-based learn￾ing calculation that can be utilized for both characterization and relapse 
undertakings. It can likewise be adjusted for load adjusting in organized 
detecting frameworks [24].
def load_balance(nodes, k, max_iterations=100):
centroids = initialize_centroids(nodes, k)
for _ in range(max_iterations):
clusters = assign_to_nearest_centroid(nodes, centroids)
new_centroids = update_centroids(clusters)
if np.allclose(centroids, new_centroids):
break
centroids = new_centroids
return clusters
6.5.5 Learning-Based Resource Allocation (LB-RA)
LB-RA methods work based on two different principles, i.e., Dynamic 
Switching Between Different RA Strategies and Resource Allocation 
Strategies Evaluation and Selection. LB-RA essentially uses long-term 
popularity trends as the aggregate point to which the average popular￾ity should eventually revert. The objective of LB-RA is to select the best 
resource allocation strategy for the upcoming period [25].
Algorithm Steps:
Step 1: Based on previous observations and the assumption of a Zipf-based 
long tail, the popularity trends for the upcoming period are predicted.
Step 2: After that, the prior probabilities are created. This involves com￾paring how well each of the three RA strategies performed to the predicted 
distribution of popularity for the upcoming period of time. Thereafter, 
we measure execution levels over the long haul as far as progress rate and

entropy. Montecarlo simulation is used here to obtain the most granular 
performance assessment (the measurement is done at a VoD request level).
Step 3: The probability density is then approximated by a Gaussian func￾tion. The parameters of this function are ones that produce a best fit with 
the histogram of the prior probabilities generated in the prior step above. 
Here, we assume that the probability distribution follows a normal distri￾bution that is used in the Bayesian fusion. It is important to note that our 
LB-RA process will lead to six Gaussian functions: three RA strategies for 
two performance metrics.
Step 4: The next step would be to use Bayes’ theorem to combine the two 
Gaussian functions associated with the two performance metrics for each 
RA strategy considered. At this point, we obtain a common way to com￾pare the different RA strategies while still considering the performances 
along the two dimensions: success rate and entropy. This process is referred 
to as obtaining posterior probabilities.
Step 5: To evaluate the different RA strategies against each other, a 
Montecarlo Simulation is used. This allows calculating the value of the pos￾terior probability of each strategy in the most detailed way.
Step 6: The maximum a posteriori estimator is applied: the RA strategy 
with the highest posterior probability is selected for the upcoming time 
period.
6.5.6 Neural Networks for Load Balancing and Resource 
Allocation
Neural networks can indeed be utilized for load balancing in various 
systems, including computer networks, cloud computing environments, 
and distributed systems. The objective of burden adjusting is to split the 
responsibility between a few assets to limit response times, boost through￾put, enhance asset use, and forestall over-burden situations. Coming up 
next are the advantages of this technique [26].
a. Resource Demand Prediction: Brain organizations can 
be prepared to foresee future asset requests by consolidat￾ing authentic information, current responsibility patterns, 
and other pertinent attributes. By precisely foreseeing asset 
requests, a heap balancer can proactively rearrange respon￾sibility to forestall asset bottlenecks and guarantee profi￾cient asset use.

b. Dynamic Resource Allocation: Real-time workload fac￾tors and system performance indicators can be taught to 
neural networks to dynamically allocate resources. Thus, 
load balancers can adaptably adjust asset portions in light 
of moving responsibility conditions augmenting frame￾work execution and keeping up with high accessibility.
c. Fault and Anomaly Detection: Neural networks can be 
used for anomaly detection to find unusual patterns or 
deviations from the system’s usual behavior. We call this 
technique adaptation to internal failure. At the point when 
load balancers answer fittingly to irregularities, for exam￾ple, abrupt spikes in responsibility or asset blackouts, they 
can decrease the effect on framework execution and propo￾sition adaptation to non-critical failure.
d. Traffic Prediction and Routing: By analyzing network 
traffic patterns, neural networks can predict future traffic 
loads on various resources or nodes. These projections can 
be used by load balancers to intelligently route incoming 
requests to the most appropriate resources, thereby reduc￾ing response times and increasing system throughput.
e. QoS (Quality of Service) Optimization: Based on user￾defined goals and constraints, neural networks can be trained 
to optimize QoS attributes like response time, throughput, 
and resource utilization. These learned models can be uti￾lized by load balancers to conclude which solicitations to 
focus on or how best to disseminate assets to meet explicit 
nature of administration necessities.
f. Self-Learning and Adaptation: Self-learning load￾balancing systems that constantly adapt and enhance their 
performance can incorporate neural networks. Support 
learning methods permit load balancers to independently 
explore different avenues regarding a few techniques and 
track down the ideal ones for responsibility dispersion and 
asset designation.
A simple implementation of the same is given as follows:
# Initialize Neural Network Model
model = NeuralNetwork(input_size, hidden_layers, output_
size)
# Train the Neural Network Model (using historical data)

train_neural_network(model, training_data)
# Monitor System Metrics (e.g., current workload, resource 
utilization)
while True:
# Collect Real-Time System Metrics
current_workload = monitor_workload()
resource_utilization = monitor_utilization()
# Predict Resource Demands using Neural Network Model
predicted_demands = model.predict(current_workload)
# Determine Resource Allocation based on Predictions
resource_allocation=allocate_resources(predicted_demands, 
resource_utilization)
# Update Load Balancer Configuration (e.g., route requests)
update_load_balancer(resource_allocation)
# Repeat (continuously monitor and adjust)
6.5.7 Reinforcement Learning
By interacting with its surroundings, the reinforcement learning (RL) 
learner is an adaptive decision-making agent that can enhance its behavior 
on its own. In contrast to conventional supervised learning, which involves 
giving the agent labeled training data, reinforcement learning (RL) learns 
by making mistakes and getting feedback in the form of incentives or 
penalties. Fundamentally, the goal of the RL learner is to choose actions 
that produce desired results to maximize cumulative rewards over time. It 
does this by constructing a predictive model of the dynamics of the envi￾ronment, which is commonly expressed as a Q-table or Q-function and 
calculates the projected future benefits linked to executing certain actions 
in various stages. The RL learner eventually moves from initially random 
actions to more informed judgments by iteratively exploring and exploit￾ing its policy [27].
# Step 1: Define RL Environment and Agent
# Define environment dynamics (state transitions and rewards)
def step(state, action):
# Update system state based on action
# Calculate reward
# Return next state, reward, and done flag
# Define agent policy
def select_action(state):
# Select action based on policy (e.g., epsilon-greedy)

# Step 2: Main Loop (Training)
# Initialize Q-table
Q = {}
# Loop through episodes
for episode in range(num_episodes):
# Reset environment to initial state
state = initial_state
# Loop within an episode
while not done:
# Select action using epsilon-greedy policy
action = select_action(state)
# Take action and observe next state, reward, and done flag
next_state, reward, done = step(state, action)
# Update Q-value for (state, action) pair
Q[state][action] = update_q_value(Q[state][action], reward, 
next_state)
# Move to next state
state = next_state
# Step 3: Deployment
# Deploy trained agent
state = initial_state
while not done:
action = select_action(state)
next_state, _, done = step(state, action)
state = next_state
6.6 Real-World Applications
In many industries, including computer science, telecommunications, 
manufacturing, transportation, and finance, load balancing and resource 
allocation are fundamental ideas.
a. Computer Networks: Load balancing and resource alloca￾tion in networking ensure that data packets are efficiently 
distributed across the servers, routers, and switches that are 
accessible to the network. Many servers use load balancers 
to evenly distribute incoming network traffic among them 
preventing one server from becoming overloaded.
b. Cloud Computing: Cloud service providers use load balanc￾ing and resource allocation strategies to spread computational

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License164 Networked Sensing Systems
workloads across multiple servers in data centers. This 
ensures the ideal utilization of open resources and success￾ful treatment of client demands. Dynamic weight-changing 
computations acclimate to changing resource openness and 
solicitations.
c. Data Centers: In server farms, load balancing and asset 
assignment are crucial for optimizing server utilization 
and ensuring high help accessibility. The unique portion 
of assets, like computer chip, memory, and capacity, to vir￾tual machines in light of interest is made conceivable by 
virtualization advances. To avoid bottlenecks and main￾tain responsiveness, load balancers distribute traffic among 
servers.
d. Distributed Systems: Distributed file systems, distributed 
databases, and content delivery networks (CDNs), which 
distribute data and processing across multiple nodes, all 
rely heavily on resource allocation and load balancing. This 
further develops adaptation to non-critical failure, adapt￾ability, and execution improved this.
e. Transportation Networks: Load changing is pressing in 
transportation associations like rail routes, conveyance 
associations, and planes. It limits traffic and delays while 
guiding vehicles or freight to their complaints as fast as 
common sense. Vehicles, workers, and courses are distrib￾uted according to interest, limit requirements, and schedule 
requirements using asset distribution methodologies.
f. Energy Management: In the energy region, managing the 
age, transmission, and course of power requires load chang￾ing and resource conveyance. Smart grid technologies opti￾mize the distribution of electricity resources like renewable 
energy sources, storage systems, and demand response pro￾grams to meet fluctuating demand while maintaining grid 
stability.
g. Financial Trading: High-recurrence exchanging firm’s use 
load adjusting and asset assignment calculations to amplify 
exchange execution across many trades and exchanging set￾tings. These calculations progressively allocate exchanging 
requests to various servers and courses to limit inactivity 
and amplify benefits.

6.7 Performance Metrics
Metrics for performance evaluation are necessary to determine whether 
load balancing and resource allocation strategies are working. Common 
methods for achieving this objective include the following:
6.7.1 Throughput
A measure of how quickly a system responds to queries or completes tasks 
is called throughput. It shows how successfully assets are figured out and 
how to deal with approaching undertakings. Better performance typically 
indicates higher throughput.
6.7.2 Reaction Time
Reaction time is the time it takes to get done with a responsibility or inter￾action, a solicitation from when it is shipped off the framework until it is 
settled. Shorter response times indicate a more responsive system and are 
better for the user experience.
6.7.3 Latency
It refers to the amount of time necessary to complete a task or request. It 
thinks about network inertness, handling time, and lining delays. System 
responsiveness and delay optimization are both enhanced by lower latency, 
particularly for real-time systems.
6.7.4 Versatility
The limit of a system to manage extending position or resource demands 
without relinquishing its handiness is assessed by flexibility. It looks at the 
system’s ability to grow or shrink in response to changes in workload or 
resources.
6.7.5 Asset Use
How much microprocessor, memory, and association information move 
limit consumed by the structure is shown by estimations for assessing 
resource use. High use exhibits useful resource assignment; however, low 
use could show underutilization or logical bottlenecks.

6.7.6 Optimization
Load dissemination measurements assess how equitably the responsibility 
is conveyed among servers or accessible assets. Balanced load distribution 
prevents resource overloading, which can lower performance, and maxi￾mizes resource utilization.
6.7.7 Fairness
Fairness can be measured as the equitable distribution of resources or 
workload among users or apps. It ensures that all clients or tasks get a com￾parable movement of resources and shields against resource starvation or 
partnership by unambiguous components.
6.7.8 MTTF
The framework’s capacity to work and stay accessible even with mistakes 
or different interruptions is estimated by adaptation to internal failure 
measurements. This includes estimates like accessibility (percent), mean 
opportunity to recover (MTTR), and interim to failure (MTTF).
6.7.9 Cost Effectiveness
This action looks at how asset portioning and burden-adjusting meth￾ods affect costs and execution improvements. It considers the expense of 
equipment, energy use, and working expenses.
6.7.10 Adaptability
The system’s capacity to dynamically adjust load balancing and resource 
allocation strategies in response to shifting workload patterns, resource 
availability, or system conditions is known as dynamic load balancing.
By examining these performance metrics, researchers, engineers, and 
system administrators can evaluate the effectiveness of load balancing and 
resource allocation strategies, identify areas for improvement, and make 
well-informed decisions to maximize system efficiency and performance.

6.8.4 Containerization and Orchestration
The sending and organization of microservice-based applications pro￾gressively use containerization stages like Docker and coordination sys￾tems like Kubernetes. Load balancers and asset portion strategies should 
acclimate to the powerful idea of containerized conditions to oversee 
asset allotment and responsibility dissemination across holder bunches 
proficiently.

Abstract
This work presents a comprehensive analysis of topological network performance 
in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) domain. With the increasing deployment 
of WSNs in diverse applications, selecting the most suitable network topology is 
crucial for optimizing performance and resource utilization. The objective of the 
study is twofold. Initially, this study conducts an in-depth examination of four 
prominent topologies: Star, Mesh, Tree, and Cluster, evaluating their performance 
across key parameters, such as reliability, energy efficiency, scalability, latency, fault 
tolerance, deployment, and cost. The findings contribute valuable insights into the 
trade-offs and advantages associated with each topology aiding network designers 
and researchers in making informed decisions for WSN deployments tailored to 
specific application requirements. Second, this research offers a valuable reference 
point for optimizing WSN performance and enhancing the effectiveness of sensor 
networks in various domains. To develop smarter cities, we must really understand 
how different forms and structures of cities are interconnected with each other 
and how these fit into the maps we draw. The study as a comparison of some repre￾sentative topological architectures is backed up by their relevance to the smart city 
infrastructure systems. It covers network-based model evaluation addressing their 
efficiency, scalability, and availability in the urban conditions. On the other hand,

7.1 Introduction
In bringing up the idea of sensor network, the manner of how they are con￾nected is of the essence. It influences what information is gathered from 
the overall network and how it is brought to a central control. The term 
topology within the context of sensor networking describes the spatial lay￾out of these nodes and the communication links that connect them as well. 
Topology selection can greatly affect tangible properties of sensor network 
facilities such as reliability of data, energy efficiency, scalability, latency, 
and fault tolerance. As more and more sensor networks are deployed in 
broader domains, such as environmental monitoring, industrial automa￾tion, smart cities, or healthcare, the criticality of choosing the right topol￾ogy becomes apparent. This introductory exploration focuses upon the 
role of topology in sensor networking. Topology is a multifaceted concept 
that is present everywhere from how it influences the performance and 
effectiveness of ubiquitous networks to the structures in which it can be 
realized. Decisions on the spatial distribution of sensor nodes (SN) are the 
main factors in sensor networking that determine the level of performance 
and effectiveness of the whole network.
The function carried out by topology in defining the strategic loca￾tion of SNs within a given environment is highly significant. SNs may get 
distributed in different ways and topological structures according to the 
specific application requirements, as they could be organized into a grid, 
random, hierarchical, or, in some cases, event-driven deployment pat￾terns. Grid type deployments have uniform coverage and are appropriate 
for applications, which require gathering of data over an area in a uniform 
way. In contrast, random deployments bring in an uncertain element, and 
this is beneficial in environments with varying environmental conditions. 
Hierarchical deployments perform multi-tiered networks following the 
node level hierarchy maximizing energy efficiency and scalability. Event￾triggered deployments put a priority on placing the candidate nodes in

nodes expected to detect particular events of interest. The distribution of 
the SN within the application must be selected based on technical con￾siderations. The SN distribution must be aligned with the goals and con￾straints of the application. This will also enable the application to collect 
data effectively and save energy and resources simultaneously.
Mesh topology was built to be logical and flexible and currently enjoys 
a huge attention from both academia and industrial experts due to its 
exceptional benefits. It is a mesh arrangement where every node is linked 
with several nearby nodes thus being in direct contact. It merely creates 
a web mesh of relationships between them. Such an interconnected envi￾ronment guarantees ruggedness and robustness, as there are many paths 
for data to travel from A to B. The mesh topology is, in general, very good 
for sensor networks where the fault tolerance, redundancy, as well as data 
integrity elements are considered as very important ones. Although multi￾hop communication in mesh networks is prone to consume more power 
compared to other topologies, educated routing techniques and regulated 
power mechanism can reduce this issue. Moreover, mesh topologies are 
designed to handle scenarios with robustness and flexibility in mind; these 
are widely used for applications including environmental monitoring, 
smart grids, industrial automation, where the SNs must adapt to changing 
conditions, and the data reach the destination reliably.
Sensor networking typically employs the star topology, which is simple 
to implement and established. In this topology, the sink or central node 
is connected with all nodes forming a network where every communi￾cation flows through this central node. The star topology assists with the 
network’s simplification of administration and routing as data aggregation 
and decision making mostly take place at the core node. This simple design 
is, therefore, ideal for applications that need to be quickly set up and have 
centralized control like home automation and small-scale industrial set￾tings. However, the star topology may have limitations in terms of scalabil￾ity and fault tolerance irrespective of its importance. In the case the central 
unit fails, the whole network may no longer function. Hence, one should 
keep in mind that whilse star topologies are characterized by simplicity, 
straightforward data management, and are quite suitable in regard to the 
deployment of a small-sized SN, their suitability largely depends on the 
specific requirements.
As in a hierarchical and organized network topology, a sensor network 
often uses a tree topology to control data flow. The SNs will operate in a 
similar way to that of the tree structure. The main branch is the one at the 
top, and then, all the other branches coming out from this main branch are 
the children. The SN data passes down through the hierarchy to the root

node that may be as a BS or data aggregator. Tree topologies have their 
benefits, which include scalability and energy efficiency: each node has 
its role in routing data, and other nodes may be simply connected to the 
hierarchy. This topology is highly suitable for sensor networks deployed in 
applications where data are required to be gathered from many locations 
and transferred to a central point, which may include applications such 
as environment monitoring and precision agriculture. But the success of 
a tree topology depends on how communication paths are carefully man￾aged and how routing algorithms are well designed so that there are no 
bottlenecks or long queue time.
Clustered topology is the most common strategy of network config￾uration that is effective and energy saving in sensor networking. In this 
configuration, nodes make up the clusters, and the cluster heads are the 
leader nodes. Other than the member nodes (MN), the cluster heads (CH) 
connect the BS (or sink node) to the intermediary ear (CH). This type of 
SNs call for a process of grouping together of information received through 
a different array of devices and then sending it to a CH node. Then, for 
this CH node, it combines all information and forward it to another BS. 
Cluster topologies are fluent for applications that strive for energy-saving 
and data-gathering optimization. As stated, clustering a network by lower￾ing the gap between nodes within a cluster improves energy efficiency, as 
nodes may normally operate in low power modes when not actively trans￾mitting data. This design enables scalability and longevity of network while 
ensuring data integrity and hence is a good option for sensor networks 
in habitats like soil moisture measurement, healthcare applications, and 
infrastructure maintenance. Nevertheless, the efficient managing and load 
balancing may be very important to exploit the benefits of this topology.

7.2 Literature Review
There have been many researches on the efficiency of different topologies 
when the issue is networking of sensor networks. A small-scale study was 
among the first to be undertaken [1]. They compared the performance of 
three topologies: star, trees, and net. Throughput and delay, they discov￾ered, were the best in mesh topology, but it consumed the maximum energy 
as well. The star-network implementation had the least energy consump￾tion, but this also had the worst performance in terms of throughput and 
delay. In the case of tree topology, the average performance was acceptable. 
Another study was conducted. They compared the performance of four 
topologies: star, tree, cluster, and grid are the key shapes in Vadas Gunta’s 
oil painting [2]. These researchers demonstrated that the hierarchy was a 
topology that had the best throughput and average delay, the next best was 
the grid topology, then the tree topology, and finally the cluster and the 
star topology. Wang et al. (2018) reported a more recent research work 
They compared the performance of five topologies: star, tree, mesh, hybrid, 
and dynamic. Adaptive topology was shown to be superior in terms of 
throughput and delay metrics, whereas the mesh topology came second, 
next was the hybrid topology, and then the tree topology as well as the 
star topology. Logical topologies deem the communication routes within 
the network between SNs; hence, they are of star importance especially in 
resource-limited sensor networks. Therefore, the difficulties of minimizing 
constraints become more spatial, and it becomes easier to get to know such 
problems through a perspective of topology. For this reason, the research 
enterprise is focused on the logic topologies in WSNs. Initially, the set of 
performance metrics, which are required for this task, is determined. Next, 
a complete study of the multiple logical topologies extracted from different 
application protocols in WSNs is performed, and then a comparison of 
these topologies is provided using the previously prepared performance 
metrics [3].
Many other authors have decades of work in similar ways by the writ￾ers of ref. [4]; however, the focus of their research is to create algebraic 
methods of quantitative assessment of different topologies and qualitative 
perception of other performance statistics. The main focus of this research 
is to provide a simple guidance on WSN developers in selecting the best 
topology and its associated parameters. The topology structure of WSN is 
the first stage of the designing and setting up the system. One of the great 
ways to do this is to consider a proper topology, which will increase the 
life of the network. The paper focuses on the complexity of the topology

structures of the WSN, which can be examined via the network theory. The 
paper describes the study of WSN measurement that shows the property 
unique to node degree distribution in which meshed networks result in 
a shorter average path length and a higher cluster coefficient. In addition 
to that, WSNs have qualities that place them in the middle between these 
two types of networks, in the sense that they have properties similar to the 
small-world networks [5, 6]. The architecture of a WSN is therefore one 
crucial factor. Situations can make the reliability of the network dependent 
on the setup, on how much energy is being consumed, and on how fast 
the messages can be sent. In this study, they looked at three different ways 
to set up networks: a first one with hexagons, a second one with grid, and 
a third with equilateral triangles to observe how differently each design 
covers the network performance. The topology of the nodes and the inter￾vening space between them have a crucial role for the functioning and the 
performance of WSNs. Due to the above factors, the sensors now have to 
detect certain events and pass the information to the BS. The topological 
arrangements impact on overall resource management.
On examining particular fit-constrained environments and habitats, the 
positioning of loci and distances between nodal centers turn highly spe￾cial to the specific demands of each respective application. However, the 
major milestone seen in this study is to cover the entire area to find rele￾vant events. Sensors are installed at locations where the role they are sup￾posed to plays is taken into consideration and the distances they need be 
from each other. Stated devices can be simple sensors/devices of a limited 
function or relays/devices will full capabilities. They use definite technical 
standards referred to as IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee protocol. In addition to that, 
they are working with a system that dares to launch data with the same rate 
[8]. Among the main aspects of WSN management is topology manage￾ment. The main point of it is to find an algorithm that enables the network 
to remain connected while simultaneously saving energy. The topology 
management means understanding the physical connection of sensors and 
logical relation among them [7]. The concept of topology management is 
understanding the physical connection of the sensors and the logical rela￾tionship among them. The ACL protocol is the one which involves choos￾ing active communicating nodes. This approach eliminates the redundant 
transmission of information and keeps nodes alive. Networks require con￾tinuous monitoring of the underlying infrastructure to maintain smooth 
and fast workflow. So, the primary purpose of topology management is 
to supply an energy-efficient mechanism of network connectivity mainte￾nance. This is reflected in the configuration management practice, which 
is composed of two phases, the initial setup of a network device and the

ongoing maintenance and control of these devices [9]. The correct network 
topology choice is crucial in sensor networking as, on the contrary, mis￾takes in that choice can be followed by a number of complexities, which, as 
a result, form a cascade of problems. If the grid topology does not correlate 
with the application-specific conditions, there are a lot of challenges which 
emerge. Also, it may result in the routing of data via inefficient routes, 
which requires data packets to travel unnecessary long routes thus giving 
rise to latency alongside higher power consumption [10].
Besides, network reliability can be compromised, for it may have nodes 
that are not robust enough to replace failed nodes. The network disconnec￾tions and loss of data can be a result of this. In addition, the flexibility and 
reconfigurability of the network could be compromised, which could lead 
to difficulties in scaling the network to changes of size or configuration. In 
essence, topological mapping erroneousness worsens the intrinsic sensor 
network complexity problem by adding inefficiency, raising unreliability, 
and impeding decent network growth. This stresses the substantial role 
topology plays in the achievement of the best performance and resource 
management in the sensor networks [11]. The ring topology is outside the 
sensing scenario facing the exact data transmission and reliability prob￾lems. In case of the sensor network in which data integrity and latency 
define the network, performance ring topology can be the best option 
because of its deterministic data routing feature. A ring topology is a net￾work of Sn nodes, where each one is connected to exactly two neighbors, 
hence ensuring that information traffic passes a predefined route from 
tail to head [12]. In addition, it brings both the routing simplicity and the 
collision probability reduction due to the predictive nature that improves 
network performance. In addition, rings can be developed with fault tol￾erance in mind so that data can go around a clockwise direction if there is 
a failure of any one part. The data can then take an alternative route back. 
This redundancy can be extremely useful in achieving network reliability, 
which is a critical prerequisite for the use in applications such as indus￾trial automation and surveillance. However, ring topology is not suitable 
for all sensor network scenarios but its ability to offer determined routing, 
reduced data collision, and tolerance of fault in the network make it a valu￾able choice when delivery of data and network integrity are necessary [13].
Sensing topology dimension turns out to be very valuable in the con￾text of sensor networking thanks to its ability to achieve simultaneously 
high efficiency of energy consumption and quality of data collection. In 
the hierarchical sensor network, the sensor nodes in each cluster are con￾trolled by a cluster head. This hierarchically organized topology lowers 
energy consumption due to the fact that most nodes use low-power mode 
 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by ibrahim ragab - Oregon Health & Science Univer , Wiley Online Library on [09/02/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License180 Networked Sensing Systems
in which they do not need energy for data transmission [14]. The CHs act 
as the gateway connecting multiple sensors and helping to minimize the 
energy usage and the delay in data routing to the major data aggregation 
and processing point. The clustering topology also provides scalability in 
the network, as adding new nodes to the existing clusters is not required 
to do a total network migration. Furthermore, the topology supports self￾organization because nodes can send acknowledge packets to each other 
with respect to various network conditions. These characteristics of clus￾tering topology make it an excellent match for resource-constrained sys￾tems where power efficiency, scalability, and agility are vital, such as those 
in the field of environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, and health￾care. Ensuring increased network longevity in WSNs is a daunting task. 
Beyond that, the nodes of a WSN are usually powered by battery and with 
limited energy.
As more data are relayed by a particular node, the more energy it con￾sumes. This may result in the state of the nodes to be exhausted of energy 
before others, thus total disconnection of the network. The tree-based 
approach used to solve the problem is one of the proposed algorithms. 
Initially, the algorithm generates the tree of SNs, and then, the work taken 
by the nodes is iteratively readjusted. Utilization of a unified energy level 
by all the SNs enhances WSN network lifetime. The algorithm is decentral￾ized, that is, each node only focuses on own information. This enables the 
algorithm to be scalable to large networks, which are composed of a large 
number of nodes. Nodes at each stage only communicate with their neigh￾bor, which is the fundamental reason for low communication overhead. 
The algorithm reduces the transmittal of data using a technique called 
multi-routing. This method leads a node to send its message to the mobile 
sink making use of various paths, which result in the reduction of the load 
on each path [15].
A research paper [16] compares three different ways that networks of 
sensors can be set up: trellis, trellis, and hybrid structures. They played 
computer games with every design. This finding might mean the best 
comes from a certain kind of structure, called the hierarchical topology, 
which is useful especially when the sensors are far from the main station, 
and there are lots of sensors concentrated in one area. Such a hierarchi￾cal construction can reserve the power, have the network run for a longer 
time, and make the whole system get into a better state of work. In another 
paper, the problem of designing the best set-up for a type of sensor net￾work that takes the advantage of network coding to send messages to many 
sensors by one is dealt with. They had figured out the best way because 
they had devised a complex math problem, by looking into how power is

used for sending and receiving messages The genetic algorithm used to 
make this math problem simple is outstanding and that is why the solu￾tion was a success. The result of the study proved that their method could 
find the best setup, and also acceptable setup, for these networks. This fur￾ther assisted in the maintenance of the network, at least for some time, as 
proven by their simulations [17].
7.3 Proposed Study
Many aspects of a WSN can be affected by several factors, among which the 
topology of a network matters. The following are some of the most common 
topologies used in WSNs and their relative advantages and disadvantages.
7.3.1 Star Topology
In a star configuration, the base station, which is placed at the center, is the 
central node, and the SNs are the nodes that approach it directly. It is the 
simplest network, but it is not able to deal with large networks. The advan￾tages of star topology are as follows:
• Simple to install and manage.
• Easy to troubleshoot.
• Good for applications where data need to be collected from 
a large number of SNs (SN) and sent to a central location.
The disadvantages of star topology are as follows:
• The BS is a single point of failure.
• The network can be easily congested if there are too many 
SNs.
• The SNs closest to the BS may consume more energy than 
the others.
Factor-based performance with star topology.
• Throughput: In a star topology, all nodes communicate 
directly with a central hub. Throughput is generally high 
because there is no contention for the medium. Calculate 
the throughput by measuring the amount of data success￾fully transmitted over time.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License182 Networked Sensing Systems
• Delay: Since all communication goes through the central 
hub, delay can be relatively low. Measure the end-to-end 
delay for data transmission.
• SNR: Assess SNR by measuring the signal strength at the 
central hub and comparing it to the noise level.
• Lifetime: The network lifetime may be shorter in a star 
topology because the central hub is a single point of failure. 
Evaluate how long the network can operate before the cen￾tral hub fails or requires maintenance.
7.3.2 Mesh Topology
In a mesh topology, all the sensors are connected there. This is a better 
topology for large-scale networks, but the upstream computers or routers 
need to have more complex routing algorithm.
The advantages of mesh topology are as follows:
• Scalable to large networks.
• Fault tolerant.
• Good for applications where data need to be routed between 
SNs.
The disadvantages of mesh topology are as follows:
• Complex routing algorithms.
• Difficult to install and manage.
• More energy consumption than star topology.
Factor-based performance with mesh topology.
• Throughput: Throughput compression is a network rout￾ing characteristic. Check average throughput taking into 
account the existing multiple paths for data transfer.
• Delay: Extra delays may occur in mesh networks as there are 
many hops. Measure end-to-end delay and compare it with 
the number of hops.
• SNR: The SNR is difficult to estimate in a mesh network, but 
it is of paramount importance, so the nodes are able to com￾municate effectively.
• Lifetime: The lifetime of network in a mesh topology can 
exceed that of a star topology because of the advantage of

redundance. Assets of the network will be estimated in terms 
of energy consumption and node failures.
7.3.3 Tree Topology
A tree topology is a network structure where SNs hold a hierarchical rela￾tionship, where some nodes have more connections than others. This is a 
trade-off between a star topology and a mesh topology’s name.
The advantages of tree topology are as follows:
• Scalable to large networks.
• Fault tolerant.
• Good for applications where data need to be routed between 
SNs.
• Less energy consumption than mesh topology.
The disadvantages of tree topology are as follows:
• Complex routing algorithms.
• Difficult to install and manage.
Factor-based performance with tree topology.
• Throughput: Throughput in a tree topology is good only 
in case of trees that are less deep and also not too much of 
branching. Assess throughput by looking at how many bytes 
go from leaves to the root.
• Delay: Down the road of the tree, delay grows. Measure the 
head–tail delay and analyze the height of the tree.
• SNR: Like star architecture, measure the effectiveness of the 
network by evaluating signal strength and noise at the root 
node.
• Lifetime: Time to network is affected by the depth of the tree 
and power consumption at node level. Analyze the life of 
a given network when these factors are taken into account.
7.3.4 Clustered Topology
In a cluster topology, the CNs are clubbed into clusters, each cluster having 
a CH. The CH have the role of communicating with the team members 
and BS.

The advantages of clustered topology are as follows:
• Scalable to large networks.
• Fault tolerant.
• Good for applications where data need to be routed between 
SNs.
• Less energy consumption than mesh topology.
The disadvantages of clustered topology are as follows:
• Complex routing algorithms.
• Difficult to install and manage.
Factor-based performance with tree topology.
• Throughput: Throughput in a cluster topology can be effi￾cient within clusters, but inter-cluster communication may 
have lower throughput. Measure both intra-cluster and 
inter-cluster throughput.
• Delay: Delay varies depending on the cluster’s size and the 
number of hops required for inter-cluster communication.
• SNR: Assess SNR within clusters and at the border nodes 
where inter-cluster communication occurs.
• Lifetime: Network lifetime is often extended in cluster topol￾ogies due to clustering and localized processing. Evaluate 
energy consumption within clusters and the lifespan of indi￾vidual clusters.
Topology suitable for WSN is contingent on a given application and 
demands of the network. As for instance, a star topology can be the perfect 
solution for a network that must collect data from a significant number of 
sensors and send them to a central unit. A mesh topology is the best choice 
when the network must be fault tolerant and able to extend on demand. 
A tree topology is the possible best choice that will require the least of the 
energy consumption of its SNs. Depending on the type of network and the 
few procures needed, an optimal topology can be a cluster.
The performance also varies depending on other factors, i.e., number of 
SNs, the distance between the SNs and the base station, the type of data, 
and energy restraints of the SNs. Assessing the efficiency of the WSN based 
on the different topologies (star, mesh, tree, and cluster) means evaluating 
the various parameters, including throughput, delay, signal-to-noise-ratio

(SNR), and network lifetime. Every one of these topologies has its strengths 
and weaknesses. These features influence these numbers in different ways. 
Based on Table 7.1, the performance of WSNs is shown in Figure 7.1 for the 
scenarios of different topologies.

◦ Network lifetime: Time until the first SN is dead because of 
energy depletion.
Table 7.2 shows the performance results of three network topologies for 
a smart agriculture monitoring system. The topologies are star, mesh, and 
cluster. The performance metrics are throughput, delay, energy consump￾tion, and network lifetime. Among the five topologies, the star topology 
has the lowest throughput, highest latency, and highest energy consump￾tion [18]. This is attributed to direct communication between all nodes 
and the base station, which is likely to create congestion and overhead. The 
limited lifetime is caused by the fact that the nodes with the base station 
have a higher chance to get the energy run out. In the mesh topology, the 
link does not share a specific path, and the highest data rate and the lowest 
delay are ensured. This is achieved by the nodes being able to communicate 
with each other using the multi-hop fashion, which will ensure that con￾gestion and overhead are reduced. Energy consumption is also lower than 
star topology since the nodes do not have to communicate in a direct way 
with the BS as much as in star topology. Nevertheless, mesh topology life￾time is shorter than the cluster topology due to the need to communicate 
with more nodes. Cluster topology has demonstrated the best performance 
in terms of throughput, delay, and energy consumption among all the 
topology configurations under comparison. This is because there are clus￾ter heads; cluster nodes are arranged in clusters. It is also helpful for reduc￾ing congestion, saving power, and overhead cost. Network lifetime is also

consequently choose the most energy efficient communication path so that 
they are less likely to run out of battery. Conclusively, the cluster topology 
is the most preferable for a smart agriculture monitoring system because it

is the best in every parameter such as throughput, delay, power consump￾tion, and network lifetime. But the mesh topology can also be adopted if 
the network lifetime is major than bandwidth and delay satisfaction.
Figure 7.2 demonstrates the performance of four network topologies for 
an Internet of Things (IoT) smart agriculture monitoring system, marked 
throughput, delay, energy consumption, and network lifetime. There are 
star, mesh, tree, and cluster topologies. Throughput plot illustrates the 
rate of the data being transmitted to the base station. Among the topol￾ogies, mesh, star, cluster and tree, the highest throughput is obtained by 
mesh topology, then the cluster topology, star topology, and last, the tree 
topology.
This is because the mesh topology life allows nodes to communicate with 
each other in multi-hops that helps to lessen the congestion and overhead. 
The graph with delay plot shows the total delay or end-to-end delay for data 
packets. The star topology has the maximal delay, the tree topology comes 
in the second place, while the cluster topology and the mesh topology have 
the third place. This is why the star topology needs every node communicat￾ing with the base station, and this will, in turn, lead to overload and delays. 
Energy Consumption Plot shows the network’s energy consumption in total. 
The cluster topology has the lowest energy usage in the list; in the sequence, 
next comes the mesh topology star topology being the last. This is the reason 
cluster topology lets the nodes save energy by clustering closely. The X-axis 
of the graph is the sensor time until the first node is out of energy. The cluster

node topology has the longest network lifetime, while the mesh and tree 
topologies closely follow. The fourth and the least network lit topology is the 
star topology. Cluster topology enables nodes to collaborate with each other 
and thus survive with less energy consumption. In summary, the topology 
of the cluster performs the best in the average values as regards through￾put, delay, energy consumption, and network lifetime. On the one hand, the 
mesh topology would be a suitable option when the network lifetime is given 
more weight than the throughput and delay.
Throughput: Throughput plot opposite shows the data delivery rate to the 
BS (base station) in Mbps. The hierarchical topology can achieve the high￾est throughput and then the cluster topology, the tree topology, and the 
star topology. It is mainly because this type of topology enables nodes to 
pass packets to each other via a multi-hop mode, which is capable of both 
alleviating congestion and decreasing overhead.
Delay: The delay plot graphs the one-way delay (in ms) for data packets. 
A star topology is the topology with high delay, then the cluster topology, 
tree topology, and the mesh topology in order. As for the reason, the star 
topology allows all nodes to connect with the base station directly, which 
may lead to congestion and remarks.
Energy Consumption: The efficiency plot shows the total energy, in Joules, 
consumed by the system. The mesh and tree topologies have a higher 
energy consumption, with the star topology consuming most energy. This 
is achieved in a way such that nodes can reduce their energy consumption 
by coming together in clusters and not exchanging information directly 
with every node in the cluster.
Network Lifetime: The first node to run out of energy is shown on the net￾work lifetime plot—in hours. Point-to-point has the shortest network life￾time, followed by hunger connectivity model, point-to-multi-point, and 
hybrid model. Therefore, nodes use low energy by clustering together to 
form cluster topology.

Applications

structure and effective data aggregation capabilities. When it comes to

managing parking space monitoring availability and ensuring control, the 
characteristics of the Star topology align with the requirements [19].
Centralized Control: In Smart parking systems, it is often necessary to have 
a control or management system in place wherein oversees parking spot 
availability monitors occupancy levels and directs users to empty spaces. 
The centralized hub of the Star topology enables this control by gathering 
data from various sensors or cameras placed throughout the parking facil￾ity (Ref: Figure 7.3).
Managing Simplified: Through the connection of all sensors, cameras or 
monitoring devices to a hub, the Star topology streamlines management 
and troubleshooting processes. This setup facilitates the identification of 
any issues that may arise within the parking system enabling responses to 
address malfunctions or failures effectively.
Star topology shines in applications requiring centralized control and 
data aggregation, such as traffic management or centralized monitoring 
systems. In summary, the Star topology’s centralized structure, simplified 
management, efficient data aggregation, and scalability make it highly 
suitable for Smart parking applications. It facilitates effective monitoring, 
management, and allocation of parking spaces enhancing the overall user 
experience and optimizing the utilization of parking resources within a 
Smart city environment.

7.5.2 Mapping of Mesh Topology with Smart Grid Application
The mesh topology stands as a highly suitable network architecture for 
implementing Smart Grid systems due to its resilience, fault tolerance, and 
robust communication capabilities [20]. In the context of Smart Grids, 
which involve efficient transmission and distribution of electricity along 
with data communication, the Mesh topology offers several advantages.
Redundancy and Reliability: A Smart Grid requires the trustworthiness of 
data transmitting and power distribution systems. In this respect, the mesh 
topology explicitly stands out by creating multiple simultaneous connec￾tivity paths between the jumps. If one given route meets a problem or is 
disconnected, the other routes keep the traffic going, and the whole system 
is not off the air due to rest of routes running. This redundancy adds an 
important reliability factor to a Smart Grid, which, in turn, makes it more 
robust and can therefore sustain a continuous power supply.
Fault Tolerance: In a situation where a node fails or if there is any net￾work disruption, mesh topology ensures that other nodes can proceed with 
communication via the alternative path. Nevertheless, Smart Grid has an 
inbuilt fault tolerance that enables it to continue functioning even during 
the occurrences of failures and outages and system malfunctions. This crit￾ical infrastructure, such as Power Distribution, this capability is vital to 
protect (Ref. Figure 7.4).

Scalability: Smart Grid expansion sometimes requires adding new compo￾nents or nodes for various reasons and also as the network grows and tech￾nology advances. To scale a network without any effects, mesh topology is 
used. New nodes can integrate with the network rather quickly deploying 
another communication channel without putting the existing information 
flow in danger. Therefore, the scalability feature is critical in the adoption 
of new renewable energy resources, increased flexibility, and improve￾ments in the management of a Smart Grid.
Dynamic Routing and Optimization: The major benefit of the mesh topol￾ogy is that it can route the data through multiple ways toward the receiving 
end. This implies the facility for data transmission optimization, thus a way 
of maximizing the possibility of using available paths while minimizing the 
congestion at the same time.
The ability to create redundant paths, therefore, makes mesh topology 
shine for its reliability, this being a key characteristic for vital applications 
as emergency services or utilities. In short, a mesh topology has a num￾ber of advantages, which derive from its resilience, fault tolerance, scal￾ability, and dynamic routing capabilities, and make it a primary choice for 
implementing Smart Grids. It provides the required network to support 
the uninterrupted and reliable communication that is developed for con￾sistent electricity distribution and also making it possible to integrate the 
advanced green technologies and renewable energy sources within the 
modern power systems.
7.5.3 Mapping of Tree Topology with Smart Education Model
The tree topology features a proper network structure for a Smart Education 
scenario because of its hierarchic and organized nature and that it works 
for the needs of educational systems that imply a centralized management 
and the availability of structured information flow [21].
Hierarchical Structure: In a Smart Education system, it is required to 
facilitate networked communication among various levels of education 
administration, which include a central education board, regional offices, 
schools, and classrooms. The tree topology’s core arrangement, where the 
root node (central administration) is followed by lower nodes (regional 
offices, schools), in a hierarchical manner, ensures an organized flow of 
information and its management.
Segmented Information Flow: The educational systems usually add filters 
to information channels, and it can be transmitted only to given levels or 
departments. The layering arrangement of the tree topology categorizes

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseNetwork Sensing System in Sustainable Cities 193
data into segments causing all information to be possible at all named lev￾els without any congestion or overlaps.
Centralized Control and Management: The implementation of a central￾ized control and management is critical in the educational systems, since it 
standardizes, cooperates, and monitors education quality according to the 
curriculum standards. The botanical metaphor—tree topology’s root node 
acts as a focal point for control with the hierarchy of education resources, 
curriculum updates, and administrative decisions percolating down from 
the upper level.
Scalability and Expansion: With growth, new branches and schools become 
parts of the educational system, and the tree topology can soon have more 
nodes or branches added while retaining the original structure without 
disruption. This is an important aspect of scalability as it makes it easy for 
new educational institutions or departments to be seamlessly integrated 
into the network.
Structured Communication: This topology allows designed communica￾tion channels constraining the flow of information to pre-defined routes. 
This structured communication pattern supports efficient collaboration, 
resource sharing, and data exchange within the educational network 
(Ref: First session included counseling on hygiene and benefits of good 
health, the second finger pricking and expression of thought, and the 
final session included teaching patients how to administer daily injec￾tions (Ref: Figure 7.5).

Tree topology is beneficial where data segmentation and hierarchical 
flow are necessary, like administrative structures in education or city gov￾ernance. In summary, the tree topology’s hierarchical structure, segmented 
information flow, centralized control, scalability, and organized communi￾cation paths make it well suited for implementing Smart education models. 
It streamlines data dissemination, supports centralized management, and 
facilitates efficient coordination among different levels of the educational 
system ultimately enhancing the learning environment and administrative 
processes within a smart education framework.
7.5.4 Mapping of Cluster Topology with Smart
Health Care Model
The cluster topology presents a suitable network architecture for imple￾menting a Smart Healthcare model due to its ability to facilitate specialized 
and intensive communication within clusters while maintaining limited 
interactions between different clusters [22] (Ref: Figure 7.6).
Specialized Communication Clusters: In a Smart healthcare model, different 
clusters can represent hospitals, specialized medical centers, or healthcare 
facilities. The cluster topology allows these clusters to communicate inten￾sively within their domain. For instance, within a hospital cluster, various 
departments, such as emergency, radiology, and surgery, can communicate 
efficiently without overwhelming connections to external nodes.

Isolated Communication Domains: Healthcare systems often deal with sen￾sitive patient information and specialized procedures. The cluster topology 
ensures that each healthcare cluster operates within its isolated domain 
minimizing unnecessary interactions with nodes outside the cluster. This 
aspect is used to fortify data security and, ultimately, comply with privacy 
regulations, which are critical in health settings.
Collaborative Specializations: Smart healthcare systems can include clusters 
representing medical centers and research facilities that are specialized. 
The cluster topology allows these specialized clusters to collaborate inten￾sively on research, data sharing, or complex medical cases within their spe￾cialized domain while limiting communication to other clusters as needed.
Resource Optimization: In healthcare, tighter clusters may need many 
resources to be shared and communicated; however, some clusters experi￾ence less interactions. Cluster topology is essential because it is about how 
to manage communication traffic within clusters that require intensive 
communication, thus the use of network capacity and bandwidth becomes 
even more efficient.
Scalability and Flexibility: With the change in health system, the special￾ized clusters can be added to the network, or some new healthcare facilities 
can be set up as a part of the overall network. New clusters and facilities 
do not disrupt the functioning of the existing clusters. Successful scalabil￾ity and flexibility of the system allows the introduction of new healthcare 
entities into the system with the growth of the said service or expansion of 
new specializations.
Cluster topology was designed for scenarios when nodes inside the 
clusters need to communicate with each other intensively while commu￾nicating less with nodes outside, which can be illustrated by healthcare or 
industrial sectors that are found individually in a Smart city. Indeed, the 
cluster topology geared toward on-cluster concentrated and exacting com￾munication and with low-inter-cluster interactions is appropriate when 
considering Smart healthcare models. Not only does it enhance teamwork 
within the specialized areas but also guarantees the security and the pri￾vacy of the data, optimizes the usage of resources, and undergoes constant 
evolution to understand the new healthcare scenario under the Smart 
healthcare system setting.
7.6 Conclusion
We executed a comparative analysis for the four network topologies, such 
as the star, mesh, tree, and cluster, within the context of Smart agriculture

monitoring system, as part of our work. This work has concentrated on 
performance metrics, such as throughput, delay, power consumption, and 
lifetime, which proved to be of key importance. Our findings show that the 
topology cluster is the topmost in the metrics ranking, which is particu￾larly attributable to the advantage brought by the energy saving through 
the clustering of network nodes. Moreover, even though the cluster proved 
to be more prevalent, the mesh model still shows some advantages in situ￾ations where communication persistence takes the edge over the through￾put and delay aspects. What final topology selection is appropriate is the 
result of what particular application’s requirements are as the worthiest of 
consideration. As an example, networks heavy on traffic with low latency 
could adopt mesh topology, while networks needing longer lifespan might 
stick to clustered topology. Finally, cluster topology can be regarded as the 
best choice for low-power and wide-area networks, which guarantee high 
throughput, low delay, energy efficiency, and network lifetime. While it 
is true that the simulation environments have been used throughout the 
study, we should not forget there are some limitations of the study, includ￾ing the potential low applicability of the results from the artificial environ￾ment to the real-world scenarios. In addition, our study is a basis of further 
studies that might be done on the other types of network topologies and 
their effects within the Smart agriculture monitoring system domain.

Air Pollution Monitoring and Control Via 
Network Sensing Systems in Smart Cities

Tamil Nadu, India
Abstract
As the global populace grows more and more urbanized, there is pressure on cities 
to remain livable. One of the main causes for concern for those in the vicinity is 
the improved quality of the air in the cities. Thus, to make a city intelligent and 
livable, it is important to regularly analyze its air quality index. Due to its detri￾mental effects on both the environment and human health, air pollution is cur￾rently a serious worldwide issue. Wireless sensor technology is one efficient means 
of tracking and managing air pollution. Air pollution monitoring wireless sensor 
networks rely on low-cost, low-power, multipurpose, small-sized sensors that can 
transmit data on air pollutants over the internet. This chapter begins by providing 
the background information on the air pollution monitoring and control system. 
It then delivers insights into the air quality monitoring techniques. A focus is on 
the state of use of cutting-edge, reasonably priced wireless sensor technology to 
monitor air quality and control in smart cities.

when it comes to traditional air quality monitoring methods. Wireless sen￾sor networks (WSNs) have become a promising tool for air pollution mon￾itoring and detection in recent years. Dense wireless networks made up of 
inexpensive, small sensors that gather and share environmental data are 
known as sensor networks. Improved remote tracking and administration 
of substantial settings is made possible by wireless sensor networks [1]. 
They are used in a wide range of fields [2–5], including ambient air moni￾toring, disaster management, indoor climate control, surveillance, medical 
diagnostics and emergency response in hostile areas. An electronic device 
known as an air monitor is used to identify and quantify different harmful 
gases and materials in the atmosphere. These gadgets detect contaminant 
like impure particles, ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and vol￾atile organic compounds using a range of technologies, including metal 
oxide, electrochemical, and infrared sensors. Pollutants are bad for human 
welfare and the surroundings. A range of tools are used to identify the 
contaminated sources and provide decision makers with relevant informa￾tion for formulating strategies aimed at mitigating air pollution. With this 
information, both individuals and organizations can reduce their personal 
emissions to air pollution.
There is demand for cities to continue being habitable as the world’s 
population moves closer to metropolitan areas. The number of health 
issues linked to poor air quality is expanding, including heart disease, lung 
cancer, stroke, and respiratory conditions like asthma [6]. Children, asth￾matics, expectant mothers, the elderly, and other vulnerable members of 
society are all at serious risk from poor air quality. Thousands of prospec￾tive mortality instances are identified worldwide every year caused by con￾taminants in the atmosphere, according to WHO statistics [7]. As a result, 
in recent times, urban air quality has emerged as a primary global reason 
for worry [8]. For a city to be smart, its air quality index must therefore 
be continuously monitored [9] and livable [10–12]. Large databases are 
created by air pollution monitoring, which must be appropriately handled 
and promptly distributed. Cloud computing is being used more and more 
to manage the data from air pollution monitoring since it may offer exten￾sive online data access via the internet and preservation at a distant server 
outside the sample region. A number of technical tools are used by the air 
quality management system [13] to give details about the state of the air. 
Three essential technological instruments are modeling, air quality mon￾itoring, and inventory of air pollution emissions. Such methods produce 
sizable datasets on air pollution, which aid in illuminating the complex 
connections among atmospheric air levels and the sources of emissions

ecosystems, climate change. Data retrieved from these databases are help￾ful in comprehending the state of the air in a specific place, allowing for the 
development and implementation of efficient policies aimed at reducing 
source emissions and mitigating any negative consequences. This chapter 
offers insights into the classic and sophisticated monitoring methods for 
pollution in the environment emphasizing the newly developed field of 
small, inexpensive wireless sensors. The current state of compact, inexpen￾sive wireless sensor technology and its applications for air quality monitor￾ing are highlighted.
8.2 Related Works
The design, implementation, and effectiveness of wireless devices have been 
the focus of numerous researches on their application in reducing air pollu￾tion. Even though it is seen as a highly difficult task, monitoring air pollu￾tion is crucial. In the past, data loggers were used to periodically gather data, 
which took a lot of time and money. Air pollution monitoring can be simpli￾fied, and results can be obtained more quickly with the use of WSNs [14, 15]. 
Among the primary problems to be addressed is the vehicle powered by the 
Internet of Things (IoT) with anti-collision and emissions management sys￾tems [16]. They stress how crucial it is to have a robust framework in place to 
deal with these issues. The authors review published literature on IoT-based 
solutions for preventing accidents and controlling pollution. They look into 
the many components and techniques employed in these systems to fill in 
any holes left by the literature. The authors’ investigation led them to design 
a system of the IoT comprising many sensors, microcontrollers, GPS, and 
communication devices. When neighboring automobiles are detected, the 
intent of the equipment is to alert the motorist of an impending incident. The 
concept of utilising air quality data to forecast traffic congestion has been 
established [17]. This is achieved by emphasising the detrimental effects of 
traffic congestion on air quality, such as increased levels of impure parti￾cles, ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and volatile organic com￾pounds. The authors note that these pollutants are being linked to several 
health issues, including respiratory ailments and heart disease. To address 
this issue, this research proposes an algorithm that uses data on air quality to 
forecast traffic jams. The underlying premise of the model is both the cause 
and the effect of poor air quality on traffic congestion, and that trends and 
degrees of congestion may be predicted by analyzing air quality data. The 
findings of the research are presented in the article. The design of a wire￾less air pollution tracking sensor node system [18] provided an explanation

of how inexpensive it is and to widely distribute wireless sensor nodes. The 
gadget features a sensor node to monitor elements of air quality like particu￾late particles, carbon monoxide, and ozone. High-resolution maps of air pol￾lution are produced by processing, analyzing, and creating the sensor data 
electronically on a central computer. The authors also address the challenges 
of developing such systems, such as the need for sensor calibration, power 
management, and reliable wireless communication. They also discussed the 
use of artificial intelligence. Every 15 min, contaminant amounts are deter￾mined in ref. [19] utilizing metal oxide and electrochemical tracks. They 
transfer the data utilizing the GPRS algorithm by means of a GPRS modem. 
The gadget gets its power from solar panels. Ref. [20] describes how to use 
gas monitors to measure concentration readings and to send the data to the 
cloud; an Arduino and a Wi-Fi adapter are used. In ref. [21], a number of 
sensors were used for observation. The data the sensors gathered were wire￾lessly sent to a central database so that it could be updated and reviewed right 
away.
In recent years, WSNs cover attention from all over the world. The con￾ception of intelligent sensors has been made possible by Micro-Electro￾Mechanical (MEMS) technology systems [22]. They are less expensive 
than typical sensors, smaller, and have less processing and computational 
power. They have the ability to sense, quantify, and gather data from their 
surroundings. Then, using certain localized processes for making deci￾sions, they are able to provide the user with information. There have been 
numerous researches on the application of gas sensors in WSNs, such as 
a device to monitor and avert potential coal and gas explosions or a WSN 
to identify gas leaks. Nevertheless, there are memory, energy, processing, 
communication, and scalability constraints with WSNs. Simultaneously, 
cloud computing is emerging as a potentially very powerful solution for 
software, storage, and processing services.
An Android application can be used to view the data transferred in real 
time over the internet between the devices for air quality monitoring. Since 
there is only one installation expense, it minimizes the economical mobil￾ity of system hardware at several sites. With its extensive set of characteris￾tics, in IoT-based applications, the Raspberry Pi 3B serves as the backbone 
of the system [23]. In addition to gathering data from a range of sensors 
via an embedded Wi-Fi module, it is responsible for sending the collected 
data to ThingSpeak [24], an open source cloud platform where data may be 
saved and accessed via hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) over the inter￾net. Thus, the selection of an appropriate data having a sensing and moni￾toring system is crucial to the successful implementation of IOT in a given 
application. It is feasible to have digital control over the physical devices,

and Machine to Machine (M2M) communication is a means of commu￾nication between the devices [25]. The scholarly community is very inter￾ested in location-based routing in WSNs, particularly as it is flexible. As 
location-based routing imposes fundamental constraints on routing deci￾sions, it is possible to grow network capacity without increasing signaling 
overhead [26].
Context-aware technology, wireless sensor networks, and mobile com￾munication technology are combined in the system outlined in ref. [27] 
to develop a customized health information service’s mobile web. The 
method is built on a cloud computing infrastructure. The service consists 
of two health information recommender systems: a collaborative system 
and one based on physiological parameters. In ref. [28], a WGSN for mon￾itoring indoor surroundings and quickly reporting alarms in the event of 
malfunctions and leaks is presented. Modern wireless electronic boards 
and inexpensive off-the-shelf components, like chemo resistive MOX sen￾sors, are used. It takes advantage of the sensing element’s transient reaction 
to cut the power needed to measure indoor air quality by 20.
8.3 Air Quality System
Broadly speaking, the atmosphere can be thought of as an extremely thin 
gaseous layer in which all of the climatic events that govern human life 
occur. The atmosphere, which is full of the wide variety of chemicals listed 
in Table 8.1, serves both as a protective barrier and a regulatory system. The 
term “air pollution” can mean several things. A contamination or contam￾inants present in the external atmosphere are referred to as air pollutants 
or their combination in amounts or over time, which have the poten￾tial to turn dangerous for the lives of people, animals, plants, or things. 
Hazardous chemical products, smokes, steams, paper hashes, dusts, soot, 
carbonic smokes, gasses, fogs, or radioactive substances are some exam￾ples of air pollutants. Secondary pollutants are produced when certain air 
pollutants combine with one another. Ozone is created mostly in the sum￾mer, when temperatures are greater, when volatile organic molecules, like 
carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, which are produced by car engines, 
dissociate due to the sun’s action.
Air pollution has detrimental effects on both human and environmen￾tal health, including ozone depletion, the impact of acid rain, and the 
global warming phenomenon depletion. It can cause respiratory issues, 
even death. The European Community has focused specifically on the 
issue of the most representative pollutants concentration in the situations

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License204 Networked Sensing Systems
of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), 
ozone (O3), and particles of 10 µm or smaller (PM10). As a result, special 
regulations have been created. Despite not being regarded as a pollutant, 
carbon dioxide (CO2
) must, nevertheless, have its concentration measured 
because of how vital it is to the ecosystems of the earth.
8.4 Air Quality Monitoring Techniques
The process of measuring the concentrations of air pollutants involves 
either advanced in situ monitoring techniques or typical standard equip￾ment, which involves sampling and analysis afterward using online sensor 
systems and remote sensing (like satellites), or a combination of multi￾ple approaches. Observing information is utilized to appraise the threats 
that atmosphere contamination disclosure poses to ecosystems and per￾sons’ physical condition. Legislative organizations carry out regulatory 
monitoring for specified pollutants in accordance with the parameters 
conforming to the national ambient air quality standards with regard to 
extent technique, average instant frame, and frequency of monitoring. 
Regulatory monitoring’s primary goal is to ascertain whether the local air

quality satisfies the NAAQS requirements so that, in the event that it does 
not, appropriate regulatory action can be taken to minimize pollution. 
Providing monitoring data is necessary to make sure that relevant parties, 
such as people, are informed about air quality in a timely manner, to pre￾vent overexposure to pollutants during bouts of pollution, or to authori￾ties, for the implementation of direct events.
Just the amount of air pollution present when the monitor was placed 
there and for the entire measurement period is provided by the monitoring 
equipment. Thus, in terms of geography, a network is made up of several 
monitoring locations that are necessary to give data regarding the degree 
of air pollution within a specific geographic area, such as a city, province, 
country, or region. To evaluate, for instance, the effectiveness of particular 
initiatives on air quality, monitoring should produce data constantly over a 
long period of time at a fine resolution (such as hourly). Large databases on 
air quality are thus produced by the monitoring activities. As an example, 
consider a petite town by three observational sites. The hourly readings of 
the criterion pollutants (CO, PM2.5, PM10, O3
, NO2
, and SO2
) are pro￾vided by these stations in addition to meteorological data (temperature, 
wind direction, speed, and atmospheric pressure). Over the course of a 
year, the sum of these data points would produce an enormous quantity 
of hourly data points. Data management is a major difficulty in a nation 
with up to thousands of tracking units to ensure the accuracy of informa￾tion, preservation and recovery, and exposure. Therefore, so as to handle, 
analyze, and disseminate the data of air quality, effective information man￾agement strategies are needed; as a result, cloud computing (CC) may be 
crucial.
8.5 Conventional Air Pollution Monitoring
In the past, air pollution has been tracked using traditional systems for 
tracking air pollution using fixed sensors. These monitors have two pri￾mary modes of operation: automated continuous monitoring and man￾ual monitoring. They are very dependable, precise, and able to quantify a 
broad variety of air contaminants.
8.5.1 Manual Measurement and Evaluation of Air Quality
Handheld preset displays were one of the initial types of apparatus for 
monitoring air quality. Sample collection, or sampling, and the ensuing 
laboratory examination of samples are the two distinct processes involved 
 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by ibrahim ragab - Oregon Health & Science Univer , Wiley Online Library on [09/02/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License206 Networked Sensing Systems
in manual air quality monitoring. A pump or an evacuated container, or 
any other air-moving device, which makes it simple to determine the sam￾pled air volume, is used in the active sampling technique. In this instance, 
the time of sampling is typically brief—between less than an hour and a 
day, for instance. The goal of the sampling and the target pollutants deter￾mine whether the kind of sampling device is most suited for collecting 
bulk/whole air samples or selectively collecting specific chemical samples. 
Using a reservoir, needle, or testing pouch, the real air blend is collected 
next to the sample spot so as to get bulk air samples. By utilizing an acti￾vated carbon sorbent trap to hold volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or 
a filter to capture particulate matter (PM), selective air sampling preserves 
the pollutants of interest on a specific sampling medium.
In contrast, no air-moving apparatus is used in passive air sampling. 
As an alternative, the pollutants are gathered using physical concepts such 
the particles settling on an alternative collecting surface or gasses diffusing 
in diffusive samplers. Since passive sampling often gathers samples over a 
longer time frame—2 to 3 weeks, for instance—the time-weighted average 
for the length of the sampling period is the result. Given that it is challeng￾ing to estimate how much air passed through the collector during passive 
sampling, meteorological variables should be used to calculate it.
8.5.2 Automated Continuous Monitoring Devices
The United States of America (USA) has been using continuous monitors 
to measure SO2
, NO2
, CO, O3
, and PM since the early 1970s to verify com￾pliance with the US NAAQS. These devices produce hourly average pol￾lution readings that are consecutive and are employed in automated air 
monitoring facilities across the globe. A sample pump is used by such an 
autonomous monitor to gather and transfer a certain air volume to an ana￾lytical device that subsequently offers measurements. Automatic monitors 
either detect the mass surrogate of PM using optical techniques such light 
scattering and light obscuration, or they convert PM mass concentrations 
to PM mass concentrations by using the beta ray absorption of PM that has 
been collected on a filter.
This conventional equipment for gases and PM, however, are costly, 
huge, and heavy. More specifically, the maximum number of monitoring 
stations that may be positioned in a particular area is limited by the high 
cost of the equipment. Herein, choosing representative sites for measur￾ing air pollution is crucial, but in a densely populated urban region with 
numerous emission sources, this is an extremely difficult process. For 
instance, Thailand’s 60+ automatic monitoring stations fall into two main

categories as follows: (i) general sites, which are separated further into 
roadside areas (3–5 m away from the traffic lane) and residential, commer￾cial, institutional, and industrial properties. The low spatial resolution of 
air quality information provided by the thinly distributed governmental 
monitoring networks in many Asian countries is not an appropriate repre￾sentation of the highly variable levels of air pollution in a domain that will 
be used later in research assessing the health effects.
8.5.3 Monitoring Air Quality with Sensing Technology
PM sensors usually use the optical approach (illumination scattering, illu￾mination blocking, etc.), but numerous principles—summarized in Table 
8.2—may be applied to gaseous pollutants. The most affordable, the least 
expensive dispersed light PM sensors available for measuring concen￾trations of specific particles are limited to observing particles with sizes 
between approximately 400 and 10,000 nm. Ultrafine particles (particles 
less than 100 nm in diameter) cannot be measured by any inexpensive 
sensor currently on the market. In addition, PM sensors displayed incon￾sistent performance at high air relative humidity (RH), such as declining 
performance at RH ~80%–85%. To be useful in tropical regions with high 
humidity, future PM sensors need to appropriately account for the effects 
of relative humidity. It should be noted that a number of conventional (and 
expensive) PM monitoring devices likewise make use of the optical prin￾ciple; however, to make accurate measurements, they usually keep the rel￾ative humidity in the inlet constant and employ particular technologies to 
track extremely microscopic granules; inexpensive PM sensors typically 
lack all of these characteristics.
The five categories of gas sensors are as follows: non-dispersive infrared 
absorption, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors, catalytic sensors, 
electrochemical sensors, and tiny photoionization detector (PID) sen￾sors. By utilizing the processes of oxidation and reduction involving the 
target gases and the electrochemical within the sensor, electrochemical 
sensors measure gaseous concentrations. The target pollutant’s concen￾tration is correlated with the electric signal generated. Temperature and 
relative humidity appear to interfere with electrochemical sensors. With 
the help of a catalyst that is placed on the sensor’s surface, the basic prin￾ciple of catalytic sensors is to burn the target gases at a temperature much 
below their normal ignition point. One or more metal oxides make up a 
MOS sensor then observe the electrical shift that happens as the target gas 
adsorbs on the metal oxide coating’s surface, then uses that information 
to calculate the concentration of the gas. MOS sensors are susceptible to

environmental factors and can be affected by other gasses. The principle 
of operation for the NDIR sensor is absorption spectrometry, which states 
that certain wavelengths of infrared light are absorbed by target gases; a 
detector measures certain wavelengths’ attenuation to determine the gas’s 
concentration. PID sensors monitor the electric current generated in rela￾tion to the gas concentrations by producing ionized gas molecules, both 
positive and negative ions, from the target gases using a UV light source. 
PID sensors are frequently used to measure volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs), but they have limits because not all VOCs in the air are ionized as 
efficiently by them.

PID signals are therefore dependent on the VOC mixture being ana￾lyzed because chemicals compounds are easier to identify than others 
when they are effectively ionized. In essence, the sensors convert the phys￾ical parameters of the surroundings—the amounts of air contaminants, 
for instance, into electrical impulses. Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) 
and sensors are the two main components of sensing units. Sensor analog 
signals, which represent the observed conditions, are converted into digi￾tal signals by analog-to-digital converters, or ADCs, and sent keen on the 
operation entity. The output signals from the sensor calibration must be 
done using a standard of reference equipment to acquire the measurement 
data in the concentration unit. As a result, a calibration curve is created 
that links the electrical signal reaction of the air sensor to the concentra￾tions of standard gases or the information from the reference instrument. 
Calibration of the sensors using laboratory-derived gas standards is the 
most appropriate way. Another popular calibration strategy is the coloca￾tion technique, which involves positioning a sensor node next to a refer￾ence air quality monitoring device. However, for this method to work, the 
two devices must be near enough to each other to measure the same air 
bubble. Colocation is also necessary to confirm the sensor’s functionality.
8.6 Wireless Sensor Network for Air Monitoring
8.6.1 Wireless Sensor Networks
A typical sensor network consists of sensors, a controller, and a commu￾nication system, as shown in Figure 8.1. WSNs are known to be the sensor 
networks, if wireless protocol is used to implement the communication 
system.
8.6.2 WSN Network Topologies
A wireless sensor network (WSN) may be single hop or multihop in nature. 
Numerous nodes make up the network, and they communicate with one 
another through the exchange of data over communication links. The net￾work protocol we utilize for communication is called Zigbee. The Zigbee 
network model allows mesh, star, and tree topologies, as seen in Figure 8.2. 
The Zigbee coordinator is in charge of initiating and maintaining all other 
devices connected to the network. Zigbee end devices and Zigbee routers 
can establish direct connections with the Zigbee coordinator, contingent 
upon the network topology in use. In topologies, like mesh and tree, the

coordinator is in charge of setting up the network with default settings and 
selecting a few important network characteristics, but routers can also be 
used to expand the network.
Star Topology
In a star topology, a hub, router, or switch serves as the central device to 
which all other network devices are linked. Every workstation is connected

to the central equipment using a point-to-point link. Therefore, it may 
be said that every node uses the “hub” to establish indirect connections 
with every other node. Before any data on the star topology reach its final 
destination, it must first transit via the center device. The hub not only 
maintains and controls the entire network but also serves as a connec￾tor between the various nodes that make up the Star Network. Hubs can 
function as repeaters or signal boosters based on the type of central device 
being used. The central device has the ability to communicate with other 
hubs in the network.
Tree Topology
The tree topology is a more comprehensive variant of the bus topology. A 
tree topology combines the characteristics of the star and linear bus topol￾ogies. It consists of workstation clusters connected by a linear bus back￾bone wire that are arranged in a star shape. Networks that already exist can 
be expanded thanks to tree topologies.
Mesh Topology
Any device linked to a mesh topology is able to attempt communication 
with any other device, either directly or through the use of devices that 
may route messages. The route from the source device to the destination 
in this topology is generated dynamically plus is adaptable to changes in 
the surrounding environment. The dynamic creation and modification of 
routes by a mesh network improves the dependability of wireless commu￾nications, in case the network’s routing-capable devices can work together 
to discover a different path if the source device is unable to interact with 
the destination device via a previously established route for some reason.
8.6.3 Zigbee Standard
For numerous real-time applications, a low-power, low-data-rate, short￾range wireless networking technology called Zigbee is used. It describes 
the three lowest layers (Physical, Data Link, and Network) in addition to 
an Application Programming Interface based on the seven-layer Open 
System Interconnection paradigm for layered communication systems. 
The alliance industries’ tiered architecture is seen in Figure 8.3. It should 
be mentioned that the Zigbee Alliance decided to employ physical layer 
and data link specifications that were already in place. Low-rate personal 
area networks (PANs) using these specifications is compliant with IEEE 
802.15.4 standards.

The IEEE 802.15.4 standard supports three working frequency 
bands: 2.4 GHZ (global), 868 MHz in Europe, and 916 MHz in the US. 
Throughout the world, 2.4-GHz bands are most commonly used due to 
the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) spectrum. Additionally, this 
band offers 16 communication channels with a maximum data rate of 250 
kbps at the physical layer, ranging from 2.4 to 2.4835 GHz. Typical com￾munication distances can range from over 100 m in a line-of-sight scenario 
to as short as 30 m in an indoor, non-line-of-sight location depending on 
the module characteristics. Dipole antennas are used by Zigbee modules to 
increase antenna gain.
8.7 Architecture of Wireless Sensor Networks
WSN, which can be used for socioeconomic or environmental monitoring, 
is become a reality as a result of improvements in electronics and wireless 
communications technologies. This is used for environmental monitoring, 
covering air and water quality as well as natural calamities such volcanic 
eruptions, forest fires, and landslides. The WSN uses tiny, multifunctional, 
low-cost, low-power sensors that can send air pollution data over the inter￾net to monitor air pollution.
An application layer, a control layer, and a wireless sensor network layer 
comprise a typical WSN. To measure the surroundings, sensor nodes are 
positioned in the first layer. A sensor node consists of the following three 
parts: transceiver equipment, microcontroller or microprocessor (µC),

and sensor(s). A server receives the measurement data via an internet￾connected wireless access point in the second layer. Finally, the application 
layer (server) receives the data, processes it, and stores it in a database. By 
consolidating the database server, web server, and wireless sensor network 
gateway node into a single single-board computer hardware platform, the 
system architecture reduces the modular WSN technique’s expenses and 
complexity. To facilitate users’ quick access to the system’s online interface, 
a web application was built. To enable users to quickly access the online 
edge of the scheme, a web application was built to update the sensor data 
or condition of any sensor node at anytime, anywhere; users can commu￾nicate with the web application using the internet or a local area network. 
Figure 8.4 shows the basic layout of the wireless sensor network for air 
quality monitoring.
In situations when a sizable number of these sensor nodes are dis￾persed over a large region to monitor a physical environment, networking 
becomes even more important. Within a wireless sensor network (WSN), 
a sensor node communicates wirelessly with a base station (BS) and other 
sensor nodes. After getting directives from the base station, the sensor

nodes collaborate to finish duties. The sensor nodes then transmit the data 
back to the base station. A base station can also be used as an internet gate￾way to connect to other networks. The most recent information is sent to 
the user via a base station, which receives the data from the sensor nodes, 
processes it somewhat, and connects to the internet. When every sensor 
node is connected to the base station, the single-hop network architecture 
is employed. Although long-distance transmission is possible, the energy 
needed for communication will be far more than that needed for data col￾lection and processing.
There are numerous locations where WSN has been effectively imple￾mented to observe the surroundings.
8.7.1 Fire and Flood Detection
There are many different environmental uses for WSNs. All the way through 
to identify source of forest fires, sensor networks are installed throughout 
forests. A flood detection system uses weather sensors to identify, forecast, 
and ultimately stop floods. The habitat is equipped with sensor nodes to 
track biodiversity. The Forest-Fires Surveillance System aims to prevent 
forest fires in South Korea’s mountains by providing early fire alerts in real 
time. The method uses a formula to calculate the risk level of forest fires 
based on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and smoke. It 
is feasible to detect heat early on, enabling the real-time provision of an 
early warning when a forest fire begins, instructing people to put it out 
before it spreads. As a result, it prevents financial loss and environmental 
harm. Similarly, the ALERT system used in the US is an example of a typ￾ical WSN application for flood monitoring and prevention. This system 
uses weather sensors, water level, and rainfall to detect, anticipate, and ulti￾mately avoid floods. These sensors provide data in a predetermined man￾ner to a centralized database system.
8.7.2 Biocomplexity
Precision Agriculture and Mapping Monitoring the air, soil, and water can 
be done with wireless sensor networks to manage the surroundings. The 
field is covered with sensors, which are arranged in a network and connect 
with each other to eventually arrive at a processing center. From there, the 
center analyzes the data received and modifies the environment as needed. 
For example, the center transmits signals to actuators, which then identify 
and turn on the sprinkler system, if the soil is too dry. The biocomplexity 
mapping system aids in environmental control. The geographic complexity

of dominating plant species is viewed using sensors. The monitoring of the 
marine subsurface is one example, where building offshore winds farms 
requires an understanding of the processes that lead to erosion. A devel￾oping WSN application field is precision agriculture, which uses sensors to 
measure and manage the amount of pesticides in drinking water, soil ero￾sion, and air pollution. A field’s soil, crop, and climate can all be monitored 
as part of precision agriculture. In such an application, large-scale farming 
areas often generate enormous volumes of sensor data.
8.7.3 Habitat Monitoring
The use of WSNs has mostly allayed worries about how human presence 
may affect the monitoring of plants and animals in the field. These days, 
sensors can be positioned on small islets before the breeding season starts. 
During the dormant season, during the freezing season, or anywhere else, 
it would be risky or unwise to conduct field study continuously. When con￾trasted with conventional personnel-intensive approaches, which neces￾sitate a large investment in infrastructure and logistics for the upkeep of 
field investigations, frequently at considerable pain and occasionally at 
actual risk, such deployment represents a significantly more cost-effective 
method of conducting research.
8.7.4 Factors Influencing the Efficacy of Inexpensive Sensors 
in the Monitoring of Air Pollution
To lessen the constraints on the temporal and spatial coverage of tradi￾tional air monitoring, tiny, inexpensive sensors are being created in sup￾port of a variety of ambient air monitoring applications. These sensors’ 
main benefits are their inexpensive cost, lightweight, compact size, low 
energy consumption, and ability to be widely dispersed throughout an area. 
Additionally, they require little user knowledge, which enables widespread 
community involvement and awareness raising. They offer measurement 
data in almost real time, which is easily shared online.
As a result, the adoption of low-cost, wireless sensors broadens the 
monitoring data’s temporal and spatial distributions, which is crucial for 
managing air quality generally and assessing its effects on health. These 
sensors’ precise spatial resolution can assist in identifying hotspots with 
high concentrations so that appropriate action can be taken to manage air 
quality. Thus, fascinating new potential atmospheric applications are made 
possible by the low-cost sensors.

Before they can completely replace traditional displays, a few significant 
constraints need to be addressed. When compared to traditional equip￾ment, the primary limitations of these wireless air monitoring sensors 
are limited detection range, poor accuracy, and unreliability. The external 
elements, such as humidity, wind, temperature, precipitation, insects, etc., 
have an impact on the signals. For instance, it is common to report that 
NO2
 sensor signals are interfered with by ozone interference.
Compared to normal reference equipment, smaller and/or less expen￾sive sensing devices typically have lower sensitivity, precision, and chem￾ical specificity to the substances of interest. Although common measures 
for the sensors’ performance and data quality assurance are still lacking, 
sensor calibration is still necessary to guarantee the quality of the data. The 
cost would increase if the sensors were to be utilized in any way similar to 
the current standard reference equipment, such as for routine validation, 
retention of data, methods for QA and QC, etc.
Many factors, including fault tolerance (the ability to maintain sensor 
network functionalities without interruption), scalability, hardware limita￾tions, power consumption, and atmospheric conditions can affect a sensor 
node design’s performance.
8.8 WSN-Based Air Pollution Monitoring 
in Smart Cities
Among the primary reasons for pollution in the environment, which has a 
detrimental effect on human health, is thought to be air pollution. Because 
of global air pollution and climate change, climate scientists and environ￾mentalists are extremely concerned. Because of the numerous deadly gases 
that are released into the atmosphere, marine life as well as the city’s ecol￾ogy are at risk due to transportation and industrial pollution. The global 
population shifted from rural to urban areas throughout the previous 50 
decades in search of better opportunities for employment and healthcare. 
As a result, cities are under pressure to accommodate the growing popula￾tion’s needs for daily amenities. At the same time, environmental contam￾ination is growing quickly making cities unhealthy due to pollution from 
industry and roads. The number of health problems that low air quality 
causes is rising, including heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, and respi￾ratory infections like asthma. The population of large cities faces serious 
health risks as a result of poor air quality. Environmental problems cause 
millions of early deaths worldwide each year according to WHO reports.

An investigation of environmental pollutants using a wireless sen￾sor network makes it easy to understand smart environment systems. 
Consequently, when wireless devices are deployed through WSNs, 
researchers have established norms and standards for WNS-based EPA 
systems, which are essential for appropriate SEM systems. The current 
suite of smart city services that focus on air quality monitoring is essential. 
These services include traffic monitoring, noise monitoring, weather and 
garbage monitoring, energy management, and environmental monitoring. 
The most urgent problem is managing the numerous sensors that have 
been installed to collect trustworthy data. Regarding the implementation of 
smart cities, privacy and security rank among the top ethical issues. A lack 
of security can lead to many consequences such as fraud and intimidation.
Global powers are concentrating on maintaining a better environment 
and holding several meetings and conferences to lower carbon emissions. 
It is crucial to routinely check the air quality index to maintain a healthy 
and habitable atmosphere. Governments are attempting to construct smart 
cities to monitor the environment and traffic to give citizens a healthy life￾style. Various government agencies are constructing communication net￾works with wireless sensor network assistance to construct smart cities. 
To mitigate environmental pollution and maintain a healthier atmosphere, 
intelligent systems and smart wireless sensors are placed to continuously 
check the air quality index. Cities have implemented devices for monitor￾ing real-time air quality. So as to take additional steps for the improvement 
of the urban environment, real-time data are gathered from installed sen￾sor systems and examined at the central office. While the one-time installa￾tion saves money, it lessens the hardware’s ability to move around multiple 
areas for monitoring. The sensor applications in smart cities are depicted 
in Figure 8.5.
Examining WSNs for smart automobile screening systems are done. 
The vehicle was equipped with over 20 moveable nodes that sensed tem￾perature, humidity, CO, and NO2
 levels in the atmosphere. By deploying 
WSNs in smart cities, the design is possible to enhance the handling of 
garbage and reduce pollution keeping an eye on the structural integrity 
of buildings. More and more systems are being developed with the ability 
to combine data from multiple sources, including multi-sensor networks. 
Maintaining the sustainability and durability of the world economy over 
time depends heavily on ecological preservation.
Several well-known cities have already adopted the Internet of Things 
(IoT) in the modern era to boost global resilience against climate change 
and revive economic growth. The idea of the smart city is a method for 
utilizing organizational structures, sensors, data, and applications to make

cities more resilient to climate change on a global scale. Next, it was sug￾gested that networks for public–private cooperation be established, that 
investments and initiatives related to smart cities be promoted, and that 
smart services should receive more attention. High-tech sensors known 
as wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are monitored and controlled via the 
cloud. It has been demonstrated that integrating cloud-connected devices 
with WSNs improves waste management, pollution prevention, vehicle 
identification, and temperature control. These technological advance￾ments consist of WNS-based environment systems, mobile health mon￾itoring, and remote sensing. By promoting sustainable development 
practices, technology for information and communication is used in smart 
cities to address the growing challenges associated with urbanization. 
Critical needs for smart city applications include confidentiality, integrity, 
anonymity, and safety. This infrastructure’s data management interface 
strongly reflects these requirements. The results of the simulation research 
demonstrated the scalability, speed, accuracy, and safety of the suggested 
framework.
The structure of air pollution is depicted in Figure 8.6. Many net￾worked gadgets provide information to a smart city’s data collecting layer. 
The entire city is covered in sensors that monitor ozone, sulfur dioxide,

nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. Since there are numerous data 
sources, this is where the gathering and aggregate process happens. Here, 
pre-processing and filtering are carried out because the data may take on 
many formats. The process of finding and eliminating unnecessary data is 
known as pre-processing. Data gathered must be shifted to the layer from 
the accumulating layer after it via an intermediary communication layer. 
LTE, Wi-Fi, gateways, and other communications technologies comprise 
this layer. Every sensor’s data are sent to the layer of data processing from 
this point on. This layer can be used with gateways that have real-time 
processing capabilities. Computing can be used to reduce fog latency. This 
is where decisions can be made in real time. The main layer for storing 
and analyzing data is data management. Several third-party solutions can 
be combined here because analysis requires instantaneous computing. A 
smart city’s data collecting layer compiles information from a variety of 
networked devices, including sensors.
Figure 8.7 shows air pollution using sensors that are wireless. A wireless 
sensor network, which acts as an interface between sensors and the data 
they gather, is the central component of the system. This is a splendid illus￾tration of a smart city that makes use of an SEM system to maintain the 
comfort and safety of its citizens. Among the crucial aspects of enabling the 
extended sustainability and viability of the global market is environmental 
preservation. Environments free from hazards and pollution are crucial 
for both public health and national growth. Accordingly, experts make 
use of information to perform thorough research and support executive.

Data can be used by specialists and researchers, including local governors, 
to spot long-term patterns and support scientific investigations.
Smart city concepts are replacing conventional techniques in the design 
and planning of urban areas. When designing smart cities, wireless net￾works help in tracking the amount of automobile emissions in the area. 
Environmental protection is a global issue because a healthy environment 
is vital for prosperous economic growth, sustainable agriculture, and a 
wholesome community. Monitoring environment has been made easier by 
wireless networks and sensors. The conventional approaches to city plan￾ning and design are gradually being replaced by new technologies. Smart 
city planners can keep an eye on the quantity of car emissions in their city 
through the use of wireless networks. Because a healthy environment is 
necessary for economic growth, sustainable agriculture, and a wholesome 
community, environmental conservation is a major priority on a global 
scale.

8.9 Conclusion
When monitoring air quality in smart cities, mobility and other factors, 
including the mobile sensor’s altitude, would result in a tolerable measure￾ment error. This can be made up for by expanding the monitoring area 
at very little expense. As this chapter explains, for smart cities, air pollu￾tion monitoring devices have been constructed using the WSN network. 
Together with air detection sensors and a microcontroller, the system is 
created with a WSN module, database, and online monitoring. Air pollu￾tion monitoring stations are too expensive to be feasible. When installing 
monitoring stations is not practical, economical sensors that can track vital 
aspects influencing air effluence, like traffic and weather, can be used. As a 
result, any application that requires an accurate instantaneous assessment 
of the atmosphere through minimal infrastructure costs can use the sug￾gested approach, the recommended method, for estimating the level of air 
quality in any municipal street or neighborhood. This chapter has created 
a elegant manifold sensor detection system for tracking air pollution in 
real time utilizing the WSN network given the significance of air pollution 
in intelligent urban areas. Low-cost sensors that can monitor significant 
factors influencing air pollution can be used as a stand-in for air pollution 
monitoring stations in locations where they are too expensive to be practi￾cal. The weather and traffic are two of these variables.

in caring for patients. This comprehensive study underlines the vital function that 
that sensors have in linked medical infrastructure and gives insight into the ways 
they can improve medical care for patients, foster creative thinking, and influence 
the method of delivery of health services in the years to come.

9.1 Introduction to Healthcare 5.0
The major change in the medical sector can be explained by an array of 
causes, such as advances in technology, shifts toward public demands, and 
changes to the provision of health care methods. Healthcare 5.0, an era of 
integrated medical systems, which encourage patient-centered treatment, 
customized medicine, and easy integration of modern innovations, is at 
the forefront of this transition. Doctors and nurses handled most of their 
decisions about healthcare under Healthcare 1.0, and they tend to be con￾ventional in approach. Handwritten documents, restricted availability of 
health information, and a focus on reactive cases rather than proactive pre￾vention were features of this modern era. With the advent of Health 2.0, 
which increased the availability of medical knowledge and simplified med￾ical procedures, electronic medical records, or EHRs, came into existence 
[1]. Clients had the opportunity to take an increased role in handling their 
health through the internet and patient portals, which showed an evolu￾tion favoring the empowerment of patients and individuality.
Healthcare 3.0 has witnessed an increase in the use of electronic medical

9.6 Security Measures for Protected Health 
Information
Protecting protected health information is essential for upholding patient 
privacy following regulations, such as the Health Care Portability and 
Ethics Act, and averting data breaches and unauthorized access. Some 
essential safety measures to protect Protected Health Information (PHI) 
are as follows:
Ø Encrypting sensitive health data protects it from unautho￾rized access and monitoring both during transit and storage. 
Robust methods of encryption and protocols should be used 
to protect data both at rest, as while kept on databases or other 
devices, and in transit, as during digital communication.
Ø By putting access controls in place, businesses can be sure 
that only people with permission can access PHI. To restrict 
access to PHI by considering users’ positions, duties, and 
privileges, access control mechanisms, such as multi-factor 
authentication and user authentication, like passwords, bio￾metrics, and role-based access control, should be used.
Ø Reducing the amount of PHI that is gathered, used, and 
retained can help lower the chance of exposure and unau￾thorized access [23]. When it comes to patient care, therapy, 
payment, or healthcare operations, only gather and hold the 
bare minimum of PHI that is required. If it is no more nec￾essary, securely destroy PHI.
Ø In the case of a security attack or data breach, maintaining 
audit trails and recording access to PHI make it easier to 
monitor and track user activities, identify suspicious activity 
or illegal access, and support reaction and forensic investi￾gation. Information about user access, data updates, and sys￾tem operations pertaining to PHI should all be documented 
in audit logs.
Ø Physical security measures guard against unauthorized 
access to PHI-containing buildings, servers, gadgets, and 
storage media. To stop theft, tampering, or unauthorized 
access to PHI-bearing assets, safekeeping facilities, alarm 
systems, and monitoring systems must be put in place.
Ø Implementing procedures for disaster recovery and consis￾tently backing of PHI can help lessen the effects of system

failures, natural catastrophes, and data breaches [24]. PHI 
backup copies should be kept in a secure location, encrypted, 
and routinely checked to guarantee data availability and 
integrity in the case of a data loss occurrence.
Ø Employee awareness of security standards, compliance with 
HIPAA, and the value of protecting PHI are increased, and 
the likelihood of negligence or carelessness resulting in data 
breaches is decreased. Professionals should receive train￾ing on how to safeguard private medical data securely, spot 
fraudulent efforts, and report questionable activity right 
away.
Ø Ensuring that third-party vendors or service providers, such 
as cloud providers or software vendors, abide by the secu￾rity and privacy guidelines specified in business associate 
contracts if they have access to PHI [25–27]. To protect PHI 
communicated with outside parties, conduct due diligence 
evaluations, keep an eye on provider regulation, and enforce 
contractual duties.
Ø Create reaction strategies and procedures to deal with secu￾rity events, data breaches, and unapproved PHI disclo￾sures. Create procedures for looking into events, stopping 
breaches, reducing risks, and informing impacted parties, 
law enforcement, and other stakeholders in accordance with 
breach disclosure regulations.
Healthcare companies can reduce the risk of data breaches, uphold 
patient confidence, and prove compliance with legal requirements for pro￾tecting sensitive health information by putting these security measures 
into place and taking a comprehensive approach to PHI protection.

patient by utilizing sensor-generated information [35–37].
9.9 Conclusion
In summary, interconnected Healthcare 5.0 ecosystems, enabled by the easy 
integration of sensor networks to improve patient care, offer a revolution￾ary paradigm shift in the delivery of healthcare [38]. Healthcare 5.0 enables 
continuous evaluation, individualized actions, and preventive healthcare 
measures by leveraging cutting-edge technologies including wearables, data 
analytics, and remote monitoring systems. Healthcare professionals can pro￾vide timely, patient-centered treatment by using sensor-generated insights 
to obtain a comprehensive picture of patients’ health state. By providing care 
outside of hospitals and clinics, this integrated approach to healthcare tran￾scends traditional boundaries and gives patients the tools they need to take 
charge of their own health. In addition, Healthcare 5.0 encourages cooper￾ation between healthcare providers, which stimulates innovation, enhances 
care coordination, and eventually improves patient outcomes. To move 
forward with the vision of completely personalized, proactive, and revolu￾tionary healthcare for people around the world globally, the developers are 
embracing the potential of Communicating Healthcare 5.0 ecosystems pow￾ered by networks of sensors and data-driven insights.

10.1 Introduction to Smart Agriculture 
and IoT Integration
The need to produce food more efficiently and sustainably, as well as tech￾nological advances, has driven the transformation of agriculture over the 
past few decades. The concept of “smart agriculture” emerged as a para￾digm shift, using cutting-edge technology to improve agricultural practices 
and increase production while reducing resource use and environmental 
impacts. The Internet of Things is at the heart of this transformation trans￾forming the way we farm and revolutionizing precision farming and the 
way we make decisions based on data.
Initially, the agricultural practice was entirely based on the concept of 
manual labor. The most innovative form of today’s modern world is smart 
agriculture, which acts as a promising approach in monitoring and con￾trolling various aspects of agricultural operations using connectivity in 
data analysis [1]. Enhancing the use of agriculture components with the 
Internet of Things helps in observing and gaining real-time data on water

level in soil, conditions of the crops, and the behavior of carious farm ani￾mals, thus taking vital decisions in fertilization, and pest and water con￾trolling patterns. It helps in improving efficiency, thus decreasing risk 
and increasing the sustainable aspects by integrating with the various IoT 
devices.
10.1.1 Evolution of Agriculture: From Traditional 
to Smart Farming
The field of agriculture has always evolved with a consistent phase over 
millions of years with prominent advancement and survival rate. All the 
traditional farming methods require an in-depth foundation, which proved 
to be labor intensive using all types of hands-on knowledge of all rudimen￾tary tools that are handled over time period. This method was very suc￾cessful, but their scope was confined such that they are more susceptible to 
various shifts in environmental ranges. Thus, it results in producing erratic 
results with more wastage of money. As there was predominant increase in 
population with the rise in technological advances, agricultural business 
is equipped with immense transformation [2]. The recent development of 
“Smart Farming,” with the World Wide Web of Things, has brought various 
changes in the agricultural environment patterns.
Smart Farming also holds various traditional methods of farming prac￾tices. This helps in tracking and controlling all the aspects of agricultural 
outputs depending on digitization. Thus, agricultural producers get all 
the present data about the environment, soil water stages, animal behav￾ior, and crop yields through the integration of Internet of Things sensors. 
Producers can improve utility, manufacturing, and responsibility for the 
environment by providing data on pest reduction techniques, applying fer￾tilizer plans, feeding animals, and moisture plans.
Figure 10.1 shows the Smart Farming role in developing a sustainable 
environment. A change in point of view that acknowledges the mutual 
dependence of agricultural undertakings and the need for creativity to 
solve contemporary issues have been key to the shift from normal to smart 
farming. An era of potential where skills and imagination combine to build 
an era for agriculture, is more adaptable, feasible, and lucrative, as it nego￾tiates the intricate nature of the global farming sector, is heralded by the 
change from specialization to innovation.

10.2 IoT Sensor Networks in Farming
IoT sensor networks play a critical role for modern agriculture by enabling 
the transformation of traditional farming techniques into based on data, 
precision-driven businesses [3]. The aforementioned networks are intri￾cate systems of carefully chosen, interconnected sensors that monitor, 
assess, and make choices in real time about land, stock services, and agri￾cultural assets. A group of sensors intended to record different environ￾mental data, agriculture metrics, and health of animal evaluations make up 
the heart of the Internet of Things network of sensors. In this regard, mois￾ture in soil checks give a farmer useful knowledge about how moistened 
the agricultural areas are assisting them in planning irrigation and saving 
water. In a comparable way, sensors for humidity and temperature offer 
important data to assess the environmental conditions in livestock pens or 
greenhouses, and assuring optimum conditions for livestock development 
or maintenance.
An IoT sensor connection to a network is equally crucial because it 
enables sharing of data, and simple interaction among remote sensors and 
centralized control systems is possible [4]. Such networks may span large 
agricultural areas enabling landowners to access critical agricultural data 
swiftly and securely despite geographical constraints. They accomplish so 
by employing wireless communications, like as Zigbee wireless and Lora 
Internet acquaintances, or cellular networks for that matter. The Internet 
of Things networks of sensors depend on data analytics, which transforms 
processed data generated by sensors into information and insights that 
could be put to use. Agriculture can routinely detect variations and spot 
patterns of information gathered by sensing streams through complicated 
computational algorithms and mathematical simulations.

tasks, decreases labor-intensive employment, and increases operational 
efficiency in agriculture through the use of robotics and autonomous tech￾nologies. Drones equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, 
autonomous autos, and automated harvesters enable precision in the 
planting interpretation, applications, harvesting, and monitoring. This 
increases agricultural operations’ output while reducing the demand for 
human labor.
Sustainability, which prioritizes minimizing environmental impact, 
protecting natural resources, and promoting ecosystem health, is one of 
Farming 4.0’s guiding concepts. The future viability of agricultural systems 
is ensured by combining technology-driven methods with sustainable prac￾tices, such as regenerative agriculture, organic farming, and agroforestry, 
which also enhance soil health, ecosystems, and carbon sequestration. 
Farming 4.0 promotes cooperation and knowledge sharing through digital 
platforms, ecosystem partnerships, and data exchanges. An even more flex￾ible and linked agricultural ecosystem is promoted by agriculture, schol￾ars, especially innovators in technology, and legislators working together 
to co-create novel approaches and share best practices to address common 
concerns about food availability, economic growth, and climate change

adaptation. The key elements of Farming 4.0 are traceability throughout 
the nutritional supply chain, transparency, and consumer interaction [36]. 
Consumers may now obtain details on the origin of food, production pro￾cesses, and sustainability certifications because of digital platforms, smart 
labels, and decentralized blockchain technology. Customers are better 
equipped to make judgments as a result, and consumer–producer trust 
is increased. In Farming 4.0, which uses technology-enabled solutions to 
lower risks, boost farm adaptability, and develop adaptive ability, adapt￾ability and climate change adaptability are given first attention [37, 38].
10.9 Conclusion
Ultimately, Farming 4.0 brings in a new era in cultivating crops, one in 
which innovative agricultural technology, made possible by the rise of the 
Internet of Things, replaces obsolete methods of cultivation with data￾driven, efficient, and ecologically friendly approaches. Using data analysis 
along with remote monitoring to improve livestock management, dimin￾ishing insect and infection events with rapid identification and aimed at 
behavior, and optimizing the use of mineral resources through irrigation 
and fertilization are just a few of the methods wherein Farming 4.0 uses 
the Internet of Things. Farming 4.0 increases market access for smallholder 
farmers, promotes openness and confidence around the food supply chain, 
and speeds up the widespread use of sustainable practices by utilizing dig￾ital technology, ecosystem alliances, and already-existing data exchanges 
[39, 40]. Fairness, toughness, and acceptability must be given top prior￾ity as Farming 4.0 is developed to guarantee that all farmers, despite their 
geographic location or size, may take use of the exciting potential of IoT￾enabled farm solutions. Farming 4.0 has the potential to feed the increas￾ing global population, encourage environmental stewardship, and build a 
more healthy and successful agricultural sector for future generations by 
promoting innovation, cooperation, and sustainability.

The important aspect of blockchain technology lies in its transparency 
as the ledger is distributed across multiple nodes such that all participants 
within the network can have access to an identical copy of the information. 
This fosters an environment for trust and accountability. The immutable 
nature of blockchain ensures that once a transaction is successfully com￾pleted, it remains tamper-proof and resistant to alteration ensuring secu￾rity and reliability [5].
Blockchain technology evolved from the term bitcoin. It utilizes the 
decentralized ledger to record all the data and transactions. From the evo￾lution, blockchain has gained attention across various industries due to the 
potential to address various real-time challenges [6]. Blockchain reduces 
the manual operational cost thereby reducing the operational expenses in 
the industries.
Blockchain possesses a potential to reshape how digital information is 
stored and managed. It provides providing a decentralized, secure, and 
transparent alternative to traditional centralized systems [7]. Usually, the 
data are distributed across the network of nodes to avoid a single point of 
failure and ensure trust. As technology is growing toward digitalization and 
has security challenges, blockchain is considered as an alternative secure 
mechanism in sectors like healthcare, finance, identity management, and 
so on. This has made blockchain an essential technology to reshape the 
future and business. Figure 11.2 presents the essential features of block￾chain in a variety of applications.

Society 5.0 refers to the convergence of various technologies like block￾chain, artificial intelligence, IOT, and big data in real-time scenarios. It 
represents a human centric technology development that helps in improv￾ing the welfare of the public. The integration of various technologies pos￾sesses various challenges and security concerns including data privacy and 
ethical use of technology. Hence, integration of these technologies requires 
attention and measures to ensure the safety and security of individuals [8].
Due to the availability of the internet, almost all the devices are inter￾connected devices and digital platforms are being accessed for a variety of 
applications, Society 5.0 becomes vulnerable to cyberattacks, data breaches, 
and identity theft. Deficiencies in cybersecurity infrastructure may result 
in the compromise of sensitive data, financial harm, and the disruption of 
vital services in real-time applications [9].
The blockchain technology was originally developed from the concept 
of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. It has now emerged as a framework provid￾ing its application in various sectors contributing to Society 5.0. Blockchain 
has evolved into a versatile tool with extensive implications across diverse 
sectors [10]. The decentralized nature of blockchain eliminates a single 
point of failure and makes it difficult to tamper the data present in the 
blocks. In Society 5.0, blockchain can help address the challenges of public 
safety management integrating with other technologies.
The crucial part of blockchain is consensus mechanism that contribute 
to the network security and efficiency. Consider the block chain ledger as 
a book that records all the transactions. The consensus algorithm func￾tions as the guardian of the book ensuring no unauthorized access to the 
data. If any unauthorized access to the data happens, the consensus algo￾rithm detects it and takes necessary actions to prevent data update [11]. 
This ensures the integrity of the data and makes difficult for the unautho￾rized user in making changes to the data. The consensus algorithm is also 
involved in ensuring the smooth functioning of the network. These algo￾rithms maintain consistency across the entire blockchain. This consistency 
acts an agreement to the participant about the validity and the order of the 
transactions. This agreement ensures all the users have access to the same 
view of a ledger. The consensus mechanism also ensures the fault tolerance 
of the distributed ledger. Even when some parts of the network fail or act 
incorrectly, the network continues to function properly. They also prevent 
double spending of same cryptocurrencies. Different consensus mecha￾nisms are developed for various application with the blockchain systems 
[12]. These methods are developed to address various requirements, and 
they vary in the way they achieve agreement among the participants. Some 
common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of

Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Byzantine Fault Tolerance 
(BFT), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), Proof of Authority 
(POA), Proof of Identity (POI), Proof of Burn (POB), etc. Each consensus 
mechanism has its own strategy in validating the given transactions and 
adding them to the distributed ledger. Different consensus algorithms pro￾vide different levels of security mechanisms [13]. The selection of appro￾priate consensus mechanisms depends on the application and has impact 
on the performance of the blockchain network [14].
11.2 Security Challenges in Society 5.0
Society 5.0 is the combination of various technologies such as AI, IOT, 
blockchain, and big data. AI is used for automated decision making, and 
IOT offers connectivity to devices. Blockchain ensures secure transactions, 
and big data facilitates analysis of vast amounts of data. The integration of 
such technologies offers various benefits leading to improved productivity 
and quality of life. The rapid digitalization of technologies is exposed to 
security challenges like cyber threats and malware attacks [15]. The inter￾connected nature in Society 5.0 introduces vulnerabilities where cyber￾attacks can compromise sensitive data. As technology keeps evolving, new 
types of threats keep emerging [16].
The rapid improvements in technologies like AI, machine learning, 
quantum computing, and biotechnology presents novel cybersecurity 
challenges. AI-driven systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while 
malevolent entities tamper with algorithms to yield erroneous or biased 
outcomes [17]. Quantum computing faces a significant risk to cryp￾tographic protocols potentially obsoleting current encryption techniques 
and jeopardizing data integrity. The advancements in biotechnology, such 
as gene editing and synthetic biology, raise apprehensions regarding the 
potential exploitation of biological data and substances for malicious 
intents [18].
In Society 5.0, various systems and devices interact seamlessly through 
IoT networks enabling smooth communication and data exchange. 
However, this integration also expands the potential targets for cybercrim￾inals to exploit the data from the network. Vulnerabilities within one inter￾connected system can spread across the entire network leading to multiple 
failures and widespread disruptions. Examples of interconnected systems 
at risk include smart homes, smart cities, critical infrastructure, and indus￾trial control systems.

The seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies and widespread 
connectivity gives rise to a multitude of privacy risks affecting individu￾als, businesses, and societal applications. The extensive utilization of IoT 
devices, intelligent sensors, and digital platforms leads to the ongoing 
accumulation of extensive personal data [19]. As data keeps growing expo￾nentially, security challenges also keeps increasing. These data frequently 
encompass details such as location information, medical data, and behav￾ioral patterns of the users. The perpetual surveillance facilitated by these 
technologies elicits apprehensions regarding privacy violations and the 
risk of unauthorized intrusion into personal data. There is an exponential 
growth in the deployment of biometric identification systems encompass￾ing technologies such as facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, and iris 
recognition [20, 21]. If biometric data are once compromised, they lack the 
ability to be protected from alteration or substitution rendering individu￾als susceptible to identity theft and illicit surveillance [22].
The usage of AI algorithms with blockchain introduces the concern 
of algorithmic. It represents systematic inaccuracies or inequities in the 
results generated by AI algorithms. This can arise due to various sources 
like incorrect training flows in algorithm design and defects in data collec￾tion process. These biases have a significant impact on social applications 
like employment, financial services, and law enforcement [23]. Mitigating 
algorithmic biases necessitates meticulous examination of training data, 
algorithmic architecture, and decision-making methodologies to uphold 
principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability [24].
The exponential progress within Society 5.0 presents intricate challenges 
to regulatory frameworks and privacy legislation. Existing regulations 
often lag behind the rapid evolution of emerging technologies resulting 
in deficiencies in safeguarding privacy and enforcing compliance [25]. As 
data transcends geographical borders and legal jurisdictions, achieving 
regulatory compliance becomes markedly intricate that necessitates global 
cooperation and the harmonization of privacy standards [26].
11.3 Blockchain in Society 5.0
In the increasing population, the number of industries is also growing 
to meet the demand. The industries include manufacturing industries, 
food processing industries, chemical industries, textile industries, refin￾ery industries, etc. These industries are monitored by regulatory bodies to 
ensure that these industries are following regulations to ensure the safety 
 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by ibrahim ragab - Oregon Health & Science Univer , Wiley Online Library on [09/02/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License280 Networked Sensing Systems
of the employees, people around the industry, and the common public uti￾lizing the products produced by those industries [27]. For instance, the 
Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is a regulatory body 
monitoring all the food processing industries, and the Central Pollution 
Control Board (CPCB) is a statutory body regulating all the industries to 
ensure the quality of air and water. Presently, the regulatory body team 
visits the industry periodically to conduct reviews. Mostly, the reviews are 
not conducted regularly due to the increase in the number of industries 
and shortage of manpower in the regulatory organizations. Due to these 
reasons, the audits are not conducted regularly, and in turn, the industries 
are failing to ensure standards to be followed [28] even though industries 
have internal audit teams whose responsibility is to conduct audits and 
document it. But most of the time, the audit documents are just fabricated, 
thereby violating the standards. Blockchain technology, which is a distrib￾uted and immutable ledger, can be adopted in regulating the standards to 
be followed by the industries, thereby ensuring the safety of the people. In 
industries, smart sensors can be installed in its premises to collect data at 
regular intervals.
The captured data can be stored in the blockchain, which is an immutable 
ledger, i.e., the recorded data are tamper proof. Regulatory team members 
can see the complete history of the captured data, and if there are any vio￾lations, then appropriate measures can be taken [29]. Blockchain technol￾ogy has the concept of a smart contract, which refers to a self-executing 
code. Smart contracts can be used to execute immediate steps to mitigate 
the violations. There are mainly three types of blockchains, namely, public 
blockchain, private blockchain, and consortium blockchain. The regula￾tory body can choose the appropriate blockchain based on their need. In 
marching toward Society 5.0, it would be better if all the regulatory bodies 
use a common public blockchain so all the industries can be monitored.
Token refers to a digital assert that resides on the blockchain itself and 
can be transferred from one account to another account through smart 
contracts. Basically, there are two types of tokens, namely, fungible tokens 
and non-fungible tokens. Fungible tokens have common characteristics, 
i.e., one token can be exchanged with another token as they have the same 
value. But non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have unique characteristics, and 
hence, one NFT cannot be replaced with another NFT as they both have 
different values. For this regulatory body scenario, fungible tokens will be 
the right choice. Any industry to operate in the region should have suffi￾cient tokens in their wallet; only then will they be allowed to start their 
production. During the initial stage itself, the industries will be asked to 
buy tokens by paying some amount as a security deposit. Then, once the

production starts, the smart sensors will start collecting data about the air 
quality, water quality, etc., based on the type of industry. The smart con￾tract deployed in the blockchain will monitor the collected data, and if any 
abnormal instance is encountered, then appropriate measures, like trans￾ferring certain tokens from a particular industry back to the regulatory 
body account, are taken. If more violations are recorded, then a greater 
number of tokens will be transferred, and at a particular stage, the indus￾tries will run out of sufficient tokens, thereby forcing them to stop their 
production. Further, to ensure sustainable development, incentives can be 
provided for the industries who are maintaining the standards for a long 
period. Incentives can be issued to industries in terms of tokens, and indus￾tries can be rated based on the tokens they hold. Such mechanism will not 
only regulate the standards but also encourage the industries to conduct 
periodical trails to ensure their standards. A decentralized application 
(Dapp) can be developed upon the blockchain, and using this application, 
the industry members and the regulatory members can see the captured 
data recorded in the blockchain in terms of transactions [30]. Dapp will 
also have a user interface that allows the common public to access the data 
so that they will also be aware of the quality levels in the industry.
11.3.1 Blockchain for Refinery Industry
Oil refinery industries and chemical industries are the major threats for 
people residing in nearby locations. During the refinery process, refinery 
sludges or some gas leakages, which may include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxide, etc., may be hazardous to the nearby residents. Hence, the block￾chain-based application will record all the data captured through the smart 
Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the immutable ledger [31]. Since the 
recorded data are tamper proof, it can be used to take any legal actions 
against the violating industry. A complete history of data collected by the 
sensors is available in the ledger, and it may also provide further scope of 
research. Figure 11.3 presents the overview of blockchain and its applica￾tion in the chemical and refinery industry.
11.3.2 Blockchain in Identity Management
Blockchain technology can be also adopted in identity management. 
Presently, majority of the financial institutions are maintaining their cus￾tomers’ data (KYC) in a separate database requiring customers to repeat￾edly provide their details whenever they shift to a different financial 
institution. Blockchain technology can address this issue by maintaining 
 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by ibrahim ragab - Oregon Health & Science Univer , Wiley Online Library on [09/02/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License282 Networked Sensing Systems
customers’ KYC details in a consortium chain that could be accessible by 
all the financial institutions [32]. Customers have to provide their details 
only for the first time, which are then stored in the chain. Thereafter, when￾ever the customer wants to provide their details, they can just share their 
crypto address. Any financial institution can access the customers’ data 
using their crypto address. Thus, it reduces the burden of customers in 
resubmitting their details every time whenever the customers shift to a 
different financial institution. Whenever a financial institution accesses a 
particular customer’s KYC, then this access transaction will also be stored 
in the chain [33]. The process of blockchain in performing identity man￾agement is presented in Figure 11.4.
Thus, customers will be aware of the financial institutions accessing 
their data, thereby increasing the transparency. Customers have the 
authority to determine which entities are permitted to access their KYC 
data. Tokenomics can be also applied to improve the effective participa￾tion of the customers and financial institutions [34]. Customers with a 
good credit score for a certain period can be awarded with tokens, and the 
financial institutions can categorize the customers based on the number of 
tokens they have in their wallet. Even financial institutions can be awarded 
with tokens based on their customer feedback. These tokens can be used to 
avail additional services provided by the blockchain-based Dapp.

11.3.3 Blockchain and Its Impact in Healthcare
Healthcare is another challenging domain, which can ensure the safety of 
the people. The healthcare sector comprises mainly three entities, namely, 
Providers, Payers, and Patients [35]. Providers are the healthcare service 
providers, i.e., hospitals. Payers are the ones who pay for the service pro￾vided by the hospital, and the insurance companies will be payers in most 
of the cases. Usually, a patient’s health records are stored by the hospitals in 
their databases. Patients have to spend money to access their health condi￾tions and those data are stored in the hospital database itself. Getting sec￾ond opinion or treatment at a different hospital can be a burden for patients 
because of both additional costs and the delay caused due to repeated tests. 
Another factor is that the patients do not have any control or access to their 
health records stored in the hospitals, and the hospitals may share the data 
with other organizations for their business benefits [36]. The application 
of blockchain in the healthcare sector is illustrated in Figure 11.5. All the 
stakeholders of the healthcare sector get benefited with the utilization of 
blockchain technology in healthcare.
Adoption of blockchain technology will address these issues by allow￾ing all the hospitals to store data in the blockchain. Since the same block￾chain is used, the patient’s data stored by one hospital can also be accessed 
by another hospital through the patient’s crypto address. Any hospital 
can access the health records only by knowing the crypto address; hence, 
the patient has the control of their data, and they can decide with whom 
they can share their data. Blockchain’s immutability property ensures that 
the patient’s data cannot be edited or deleted, thereby ensuring the stored

health records are tamper proof [37]. Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is 
a distributed file storage protocol, which can be integrated with blockchain 
to store large health records including images and other formats. Tokens 
can be used in this blockchain ecosystem to improve the security and reli￾ability of the application.
Hospitals can be awarded with tokens based on the patients’ feedback, 
and they can also be penalized if they breach any regulations like shar￾ing patient’s data with any third-party organizations without their con￾sent. Hence, the blockchain-based solution enables the patients to be the 
owner of their medical records, thereby securing their health information 
[38–40]. To extend further, the patient can share needed medical records 
with insurance providers for availing insurance. In the present scenario, 
the patient or the hospitals will be sharing the medical records with the 
insurance providers either through any legacy applications or through 
e-mail [41]. Sharing the data in this manner is not secure, and hence, 
blockchain-based application can ensure the data are shared in a secure 
way. The insurance provider can access the health record of its customer 
only through the customer’s crypto address, and they cannot share fur￾ther without the customer’s consent. Similar to hospitals, the insurance

providers can also be penalized in terms of tokens if they share the cus￾tomers health record with others without the customers’ consent.
11.3.4 Blockchain for Supply Chain Management
Supply chain is another domain where the adoption of blockchain technol￾ogy brings many advantages. Ensuring the availability of high-quality food 
is an important aspect in fostering healthy individuals advancing toward 
Society 5.0. Few retailers already started exploring blockchain technology 
to provide complete information of the food items tracing their journey 
from processing plants to the store [42]. Details regarding vegetables and 
fruits, such as the farm of cultivation, cultivation date, their package specs, 
and their journey particulars, can be stored in the blockchain. A customer 
can access the details of the items just by giving a unique code and thereby 
ensuring the quality of the items they purchase. Since the data stored in 
the blockchain are tamper proof, the farm details, packaging specs and 
journey details cannot be modified or deleted. This mechanism not only 
ensures that quality food is provided to the customer but also helps in trac￾ing if adulteration happens in the ecosystem [43]. Such details will enable 
the regulatory bodies to appropriate actions. Tokenomics can be adopted 
in this ecosystem to ensure effective participation from all entities. Farmers 
can be awarded with tokens for the quality of food they provide, and sim￾ilarly, the supply chain organizations and the stores can also be awarded 
with tokens for the quality of service they provide [44]. If any entity is 
found to be violating the standards and regulations, then such entity can 
be penalized in terms of tokens. Regulatory bodies can decide on the qual￾ity of service provided by the entities through the number of tokens each 
entity has in its wallet. The process of enabling traceability in supply chain 
management is depicted in Figure 11.6.
11.3.5 Blockchain in Asset Management
Blockchain can offer numerous benefits in the real estate domain through 
its decentralized decision-making strategy [45]. The blockchain-based 
decentralized application (Dapp) can facilitate converting real-world assets 
to digital tokens, and it can be made available in the blockchain-based real 
estate market. The sellers can tokenize their physical asset by attributing its 
location details, price, and other facilities through the Dapp. The tokenized 
assets will be available in the market place where the potential buyers can 
see the assets along with its details. If the buyers are interested with the

asset, they can buy the property through cryptocurrency itself without the 
involvement of a middleman. Smart contracts can be defined for the trans￾action, which can further ensure the availability of sufficient balance in the 
buyer’s digital wallet [46]. The contract will also ensure that the quoted asset 
price will be transferred from the buyer’s wallet to the seller’s wallet, and 
after successful execution, the ownership details will be also updated in the 
ledger. Since the transactions are recorded in the immutable distributed 
ledger, the information stored is tamper proof. Thereby, the distributed 
blockchain-based application ensures the transactions are secure, trans￾parent, traceable, and immutable [47]. For storing the images and other 
geographical details, the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) can be used 
as the blockchain allows to store transactions with less memory capacity. 
IPFS is a distributed file storage protocol, which can be easily integrated 
with blockchain-based decentralized applications. Real estate Dapp, when 
employed in smart cities, can eliminate long queues waiting for land reg￾istration in the registration offices and can prevent fraudulent land reg￾istrations, thereby ensuring secure transactions for buying and selling of 
physical assets [48]. Tokenomics can be also applied in this use case to 
incentivize the genuine buyers and sellers. Blockchain is widely used in 
asset management task. Figure 11.7 illustrates the process involved in man￾aging assets using blockchain technology.

11.3.6 Blockchain in Copyright Management
Blockchain application can be in copyright management applications. The 
content created by the user can be tokenized in the form of non-fungible 
tokens (NFTs) and then can be added in the ledgers [49]. Each non-fungible 
token will have unique properties including its value in terms of crypto￾currency, owner details, and other specifications. NFTs can be used in any 
application, but their properties remain immutable in the blockchain. For 
instance, the user may create a music album and can be tokenized as NFT 
in the blockchain [50]. This music album can be streamed through some 
web 3.0 applications where the end user can listen to the music but the 
ownership still remains with the album creator. In certain instances, the 
owner can sell the copyrights to some organizations, but the ownership 
will still remain with the creator [51]. Entire transactions starting from 
NFT creation to transferring the ownership details are stored in the dis￾tributed ledger. Further, the entire flow of the applications can be imple￾mented through smart contracts. Any interaction with the NFTs is done 
only through the defined smart contracts, thereby ensuring the ownership 
and copyright of the digital contents [52].

Hence, adoption of blockchain technology helps to ensure safety of the 
people. Blockchain facilitates the people to live a healthier life, and it also 
ensures sustainable growth. In Society 5.0, every individual object in the 
society will be built as digital twins in cyberspace restructured in terms of 
systems, business design, urban and regional development, etc., and then 
reflected in physical space to transform society [53].
High-Performance Computing (HPC) data centers use a cluster of pow￾erful processors and GPUs to execute given instructions and solve complex 
problems at extremely high speed. Such powerful computing resources 
are used to perform analytics in big data, scientific researches, genomic 
sequencing, medical researches, etc. HPC used in data centers can offer 
the potential to optimize consensus algorithms in blockchain networks 
[54]. HPC excels in handling complex computations and massive data pro￾cessing tasks making it well suited to improve the efficiency and perfor￾mance of consensus mechanisms. By adopting the computational power 
of HPC systems, blockchain networks can process transactions more 
rapidly and achieve faster consensus enhancing overall scalability. Such 
improvement in the performance ensures that blockchain can be used 
for critical applications handling millions of transactions per second. 
Moreover, robust infrastructure and advanced cooling systems of HPC 
data centers can contribute to the energy efficiency of consensus algo￾rithms mitigating concerns related to high energy consumption associated 
with certain consensus mechanisms like PoW.
The integration of HPC capabilities with blockchain network contrib￾utes to the reduction of computational bottlenecks that occurred due to 
high volumes of transactions and complex operations. The integration 
enhances the efficiency of consensus mechanism and the effective adapta￾tion of blockchain technology in a variety of applications [55]. Consensus 
mechanisms, like PoW and PoS, require significant resources to validate 
the transactions. The larger data-handling capacity HPC ensures faster 
response and scalability of transactions.
The widespread adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies have 
brought forth exciting opportunities for various applications. However, 
the usage of blockchain and cryptocurrencies has raised concerns about 
energy usage. The consensus mechanism, like PoW, utilize energy for val￾idating the transactions. The PoW method uses miners to solve complex 
problems. This leads to high energy usage in the blockchain networks. As 
the network grows and becomes larger, more miners are required, and the 
puzzles become harder leading to even greater energy consumption. This 
creates a scenario where the blockchain network, utilizing a PoW consen￾sus mechanism, consumes a larger amount of energy for their transactions.

The energy consumption nature of PoW has raised concerns about their 
impact on the sustainability of blockchain networks. As the energy required 
for these networks are generated from non-renewable energy sources, it 
has become a greater concern of environmental sustainability.
HPC data centers are facilities accompanied with powerful computa￾tional resources that are able to tackle complex computational tasks effec￾tively. As mentioned, the blockchain method using a PoW consensus 
mechanism, in particular, suffers from energy utilization concerns. Apart 
from computing capabilities, HPC possesses energy efficient infrastructure. 
HPCs employ techniques, like liquid cooling, smart power, and energy￾efficient components to reduce energy consumption with maximized 
performance. By leveraging blockchain with HPC, the energy-intensive 
process of blockchain mining can be optimized. This optimization aims 
to reduce the overall energy consumption required for mining activities.
11.4 Conclusion
Blockchain technology has garnered widespread interest from individuals 
and organizations across diverse sectors. Its transformative potential lies 
in a range of features, including decentralization, anonymity, persistence, 
and auditability. These features collectively redefine established industry 
norms and pave the way for innovative solutions in various domains. Using 
blockchain in healthcare systems ensures the privacy and data security of 
patient health records. It provides a flexibility for the users to finalize who 
can access their medical data. Blockchain technology revolutionizes the 
identity management tasks to perform in a few seconds where the exist￾ing methods take larger time for the same. With blockchain-based identity 
management schemes, the users get a higher level of security and privacy 
compared to traditional methods. Block eliminates the need for intermedi￾aries in verification processes. This restricts access to sensitive information 
only to the verifier. Also, the blockchain ensures robust protection against 
fraud and identity theft in identity management. User data can be securely 
encrypted and stored within their identity wallet apps thereby safeguard￾ing confidentiality and integrity. Integrating blockchain technology into 
supply chain management provides greatest levels of transparency, trace￾ability, and operational efficiency. Using the mutable ledger blockchain 
ensures data integrity, security, and trust among stakeholders. Automated 
smart contracts expedite transaction settlements, while blockchain’s audit￾ability aids in regulatory compliance and adherence to sustainability stan￾dards thereby reinforcing accountability across the supply chain network.

Incorporating blockchain into Society 5.0 can improve the well-being 
of humans by providing improvements in healthcare, manufacturing, 
finance, and other sectors. This also provides a greater impact in improv￾ing the security challenges of the society due to technical advancements. 
By harnessing the computational power of HPC, blockchain networks 
can efficiently process large volumes of data. This capability is particularly 
valuable for enhancing AI algorithms for real-time decision-making capa￾bilities. AI algorithms rely on data to make informed decisions, and the 
ability to process data rapidly and efficiently enables to make decisions in 
real time. This leads to more responsive and effective outcomes. The syn￾ergy between HPC and blockchain technology has the potential to rev￾olutionize data-sharing systems. Combining the computational power of 
HPC with blockchain data-sharing systems can achieve enhanced security, 
privacy, and efficiency. The decentralized and tamper-resistant nature of 
blockchain ensures the integrity and confidentiality of shared data, while 
HPC enables rapid and efficient processing of large datasets. The combi￾nation of HPC’s computational power and blockchain opens up new pos￾sibilities for innovation and efficiency paving the way for transformative 
changes across various applications. As the number of users increases in 
blockchain, the time in locating the blocks will take longer. The design of 
novel algorithms and methods are further required to enhance the perfor￾mance in Society 5.0

12.1 Introduction to Smart Society 5.0
12.1.1 Smart Society 5.0 and Its Key Characteristics
According to Japanese specialists in a smart society, the advanced social 
model known as “5.0” must pervade all aspects of the Internet of Things 
(IoT) and handle social and economic concerns. This elevates society to 
new heights by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and the benefits of 
cyberspace to provide the greatest solutions to societal and economic chal￾lenges. The IoT, in which technical advancements in the manufacturing 
sector are highly recognized across all societal segments, is substantially 
responsible for the intellectual Smart Society 5.0. The integration of wire￾less networks, the IoT, and cyberspace into the physical world will trans￾form society into a highly intelligent and sophisticated society. In addition 
to Society 5.0, a variety of next-generation infrastructure agents are coor￾dinated [1].
The Japanese Cabinet has introduced a new program called “Smart 
Society 5.0,” which integrates AI, cyberspace, and other technological 
advancements to create an intelligent and comfortable society. In Society 
5.0, human dispute resolution and economic problem solving are central￾ized. Providing sustainability across the social, political, economic, and 
environmental spheres is the central idea of the Smart Society. This con￾cept encompasses every evolutionary stage that has occurred, including 
hunting, agriculture, industry, information, and the current integration of 
AI and the internet. The three primary areas of focus for Smart Society 5.0 
are productivity, mobility, and health [2].

With its goal of facilitating universal access to resources and products, 
City 5.0 is a socio-material system that treats its residents as customers. 
Society 5.0, as defined in this article, envisions a livable city that is (re)
modeled through digitization to provide public services and amenities, 
thereby removing barriers for its civilians. The ultimate aim is to enhance 
the livability of the city by avoiding or preventing restrictions in society 
that limit access to available services and resources for all citizens [3].
The human-centric Smart City 5.0 paradigm focuses on human desires, 
interests, and emphasizes how individuals can benefit from using products 
and services. This is achieved through the digitalization of public goods 
and services, which eliminates any limitations or issues. These limita￾tions include factors, such as livability, constraints, governance, manage￾ment, and restrictions, that hinder the use of products and resources. The 
approach revolves around the intelligent utilization of created commodi￾ties and services enabling people or citizens to derive benefits from the use 
of public goods and services [4].
The idea behind Society 5.0, originating in Japan, advocates for the 
application of technology to improve both environmental sustainability 
and human well-being. Society 5.0 builds upon earlier stages of techno￾logical and societal development represented by Society 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 
4.0. In this latest stage, societal concerns, such as inequalities, hunger, and 
climate change, are addressed through technologies like AI, IoT, data min￾ing, and robotics. The intended outcome is an equitable, intelligent, and 
networked society with the intention of paving the way for an environmen￾tally friendly and compassionate era [8].
12.1.2 Evolution from Previous Smart Society Models
The concepts of livability and the removal of social constraints are pivotal 
in the transition from Industry 4.0 to Smart City 5.0. City 5.0 advances the 
notion of smart consumption emphasizing the experience and time during 
production, whereas the preceding model, Industry 4.0, focuses on smart 
production representing production time. AI, robotics, the IoT, people, 
and knowledge are all integrated in City 5.0. While Industry 4.0’s primary 
objective is achieving frictionless manufacturing, Smart City 5.0 is more 
oriented toward frictionless consumption. Comparatively, we observe that 
City 5.0 holds more tangible and significant implications than Industry 
4.0. Furthermore, while Industry 4.0 aimed at removing constraints, Smart 
City 5.0 introduces a modified theme: eliminating restrictions during con￾sumption. The evolution of society is described in Figure 12.1 [3].

The principles underlying Industry 4.0, Health 4.0, Banking 4.0, and 
similar concepts revolve around the development of low-cost or cost￾effective technologies. The idea of City 5.0, a citizen-focused approach, 
emphasizes the prudent utilization of these products and technologies in 
accordance with the needs and welfare of citizens. Prioritizing the applica￾tion of technology to address social issues characterizes the Smart Society 
2.0 paradigm. Additionally, the forthcoming model, 4.0, is entirely dedi￾cated to the intelligent manufacturing of various commodities and items.
Although designated as “human centric,” the focus of smart City 5.0 
revolves around people, their demands, and interests in city administra￾tion concerning how residents can benefit from employing technology and 
purchasing the commodities and products created. This paradigm enables 
people or customers to utilize the most cutting-edge technologies already 
in use without any restrictions [4].
The transition from Smart Cities 1.0 and 2.0 to Smart Cities 5.0 is charac￾terized by the necessity of infrastructure, technology, and human resources 
for regional development. Realizing the potential in every sector and region 
is crucial for the creation of Smart City 5.0. Three fundamental elements 
commonly required for regional development are infrastructure, technol￾ogy, and human resources. This builds upon the earlier paper Smart City 
3.0, which utilized the PDCA method to become global. In this context, 
the formula E = KMC2
 is applied, where K represents knowledge, C1 and 
C2 denote computer and communication technologies, respectively, and 
E stands for energy or a company’s worth. Further formulas were derived 
from this equation. The use of mathematical methods to determine the

12.2 Foundations of Virtual Reality
12.2.1 Brief History and Development of Virtual Reality
Utilizing head-mounted displays (HMDs), like the Google Cardboard 
and Xiaomi headsets, suggests that consumer-grade virtual reality (VR) 
technology is still in its initial phase. The usage of mobile VR devices, 
such as those powered by cell phones, indicates a period between 2019 
and 2020 when smartphones began to drive VR experiences. References 
to high-immersion VR technology for education point to developments in 
this sphere, most likely occurring in the years 2022–2023. The employment 
of separate VR visors and controllers with regular gaming PCs points to 
a period around 2021 when these configurations were being utilized for 
specific projects. Research utilizing IVR devices with powerful computers, 
head-mounted displays, and controllers likely took place in 2020 demon￾strating the integration of VR into classroom environments. Clusters of 
desktop PCs with 360° cameras and analytics software suggest a period 
around 2021 when desktop VR systems were being employed for teach￾ing. An exploration of such devices for immersive VR experiences around 
2021 is revealed through the usage of a spherical video-based VR system. 
Although the year of the full VR classroom setup is not mentioned, it sug￾gests a more advanced level of VR integration into educational environ￾ments, most likely in the mid- to late 2020s [9].

Jaron Lanier coined the term “virtual reality” (VR) in 1987 marking the 
first attempt to employ VR technologies. Cinematographer Heilig invented 
Sensorama, a 1957 device that could recreate various environments includ￾ing noises, scents, and sensual elements like motions and breeze. However, 
since the technology was new, the majority of entrepreneurs at the time 
were unable to make sensible use of it. Afterward, in 1968, Sutherland cre￾ated a prototype of a head-mounted gadget, and in 1970, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology scientists created the initial interactive map. Virtual 
reality was largely utilized in games during the 2000s leading to the cre￾ation of a plethora of devices, including head motion devices, specifically 
for gaming. These devices enabled users to not only view but also engage 
with a virtual world [10].
12.2.2 Key Components and Technologies in VR
Virtual reality is portrayed in Figure 12.2. Mandal (2013) divides tech￾nology into three groups: desktop VR systems that are non-immersive, 
semi-immersive, and immersive. The most basic form of virtual reality, 
with a lower degree of immersion, is the non-immersive system. These 
systems only require a computer screen; no other hardware is necessary. 
Conversely, enhanced desktop VR offers semi-immersive VR systems. 
For example, such devices can provide motion and head tracking, thereby

offering the user a greater “sense of being there” and enhancing immer￾sion. At the extremely least, the most immersive systems enable viewers to 
completely submerge inside a 3D world with HMDs. Immersion, interac￾tivity, and presence are the main elements of VR. Immersion is a psycho￾logical condition in which an individual engages in a setting that offers a 
constant flow of sensations and stimuli. Interactive refers to a user’s virtual 
interaction with the surroundings enabling them to observe the outcomes 
of their actions [11].
Two types of virtual reality (VR) exist based on technological charac￾teristics: immersive VR, which uses devices like head-mounted displays 
(HMDs) or mobile audiences to totally isolate users from the real world, 
and non-immersive VR, which displays simulations on a PC or television, 
notably in desktop VR programs and Cave Automatic Virtual Environment 
(CAVE) systems. Virtual reality (VR) is an artificially created representa￾tion of a 3D space that people are able to engage upon. Typically, expert 
electronics including virtual reality headphones are used for this. The goal 
of the system is to fully engage customers and give them a sense of exis￾tence giving the impression that they are actually there in the simulated 
setting. VR offers a complete and engaging encounter, which goes beyond 
the limitations imposed by conventional 2D model, and is used in a wide 
range of industries, including entertainment activities, medical, learn￾ing models, and pleasure. An enhanced VR equipment known as a Cave 
Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) is defined through the arrange￾ment of several huge displays in an isolated space or area. If paired with 
specialist tracking methods, such stereoscopic picture panels create a com￾plete three-dimensional experience for viewers.
The confined area in which users are able to completely lose themselves 
in the digital realm is referred to as a cave. People may interact as well as 
explore the simulated setting shown on the displays if they have 3D specta￾cles or related monitoring equipment. The immersive capabilities of CAVE 
systems contribute to a lifelike and captivating experience across various 
applications, spanning scientific research, architectural design, medical 
visualization, and virtual training simulations. CAVE technology height￾ens the feeling of presence enabling users to explore and manipulate virtual 
spaces in a manner closely mirroring real-world interactions [12].
12.2.3 VR Hardware and Software Ecosystems
Blockchain technology, Web 3.0 edge computing, AI, and virtual real￾ity (VR) form the foundation of the Metaverse. Additional innovations 
thought to materialize the Metaverse include virtual worlds, gaming, and

social networking sites. Technologies such as 5G/6G/Wi-Fi and user inter￾faces, like smart glasses/mobiles, as well as decentralization through AI, 
edge computation, and blockchain, contribute to the Metaverse’s devel￾opment. Geographical computing with augmented and virtual reality, the 
creator economy through e-commerce, discovery with avatars, and expe￾rience in gaming and social interactions constitute the seven levels of a 
Metaverse platform. The infrastructure layer encompasses various compo￾nents such as semiconductors, cloud computing, 5G and Wi-Fi, and data 
centers. The technology and software that facilitate connections between 
users and bridge the virtual and physical worlds constitute the human 
interface layer. Blockchain, which enables value exchange across software 
applications, autonomous identity, novel disaggregation techniques, and 
the bundling of data and currencies, is a component of the decentralization 
layer [13].
Initially, a tracking system was used in the interactive program to enable 
users to move around in a virtual environment, compatible with virtual 
reality headsets and portable controllers. They developed a virtual reality 
program that displayed captivating scenes from a stationary position. Since 
Oculus Go all-in-one headsets do not require an additional computer to 
function, they utilized multiple of them. These headsets provided 1,280 × 
1,440 pixels per eye, or roughly 100 pixels per field of view. Three-degrees￾of-freedom tracking was used in these headsets making them suitable for 
seated viewing [14].

12.4 Integration of AI and VR
12.4.1 How AI and VR Technologies Complement Each Other
The two main technologies of the modern period, AI and VR, are chang￾ing the way humans engage with electronic devices and interactions. The 
two separate fields have advanced significantly, and combining them opens 
up fresh opportunities. A new generation of realistic training scenarios is 
being introduced by the powerful combination of AI and VR. AI improves 
VR’s potential through knowledge and flexibility giving a fresh crop of edu￾cators an unmatched learning environment. VR continues to be an effec￾tive instrument to develop interpersonal abilities. It offers users a unique 
opportunity to learn through completely immersive experiences, many of 
which include meticulously crafted 360° video. Users can study a variety of 
scenarios and learn from their failures and successes from such activities. 
Therefore, it is possible to simulate substantial trends and project potential 
advances regarding physical items in simulations by utilizing a variety of 
categorization and regression approaches [19].
AI integration into VR adventures has an abundance of possibilities. 
AI may promote more adaptable and responsive interactions provid￾ing learners with individualized instruction and criticism. The effective 
application of AI within VR requires a delicate profile. Such digital beings 
must be enabled to communicate with AI, understand textual communi￾cations, and carry on discussions to provide prompt support. By employ￾ing AI-enabled VR simulation, people can improve their communication 
skills. Individuals might grow stronger at interacting with others and han￾dling a range of client-based situations by using AI-powered scenarios. AI 
and VR are enabling physicians to conduct interventions in models that is 
transforming the medical industry. This approach helps doctors become 
more proficient as well as at ease before doing procedures within the real￾life setting. It allows property brokers to draw findings according to infor￾mation and offer recommendations tailored to individual customers. Chat 
bots and virtual assistants driven by AI facilitate lead generation and cli￾ent service helping real estate agents to better manage their resources and 
time. On the other hand, clients can remotely and thoroughly investigate 
properties through the application of virtual reality in immersive virtual 
tours. Both residential and commercial properties can benefit from this 
technology, which can expedite the decision-making process for prospec￾tive purchasers and minimize the need for multiple in-person property 
visits [20].

12.4.2 Examples of AI-Enhanced Virtual Reality Applications
Given that the utilization of AI in Interventional Radiology (IR) is the 
main topic of this research, the development of tactile perception, motor 
skills, and spatial and cognitive awareness are all necessary for the success￾ful and efficient operation of IR equipment distinguishing features of IR 
training. Thus, insufficient skill can lead to longer procedure times, more 
operational errors or complications, and increased radiation exposure to 
operators and patients alike. This problem could be addressed by incorpo￾rating VR simulation technologies into educational programs to provide 
trainees with sufficient training hours. Furthermore, depending on their 
training contexts, IR physicians may have extremely varied skill sets due to 
variations in case mixes across institutions. Introducing a greater diversity 
of cases to trainees through simulation databases could mitigate this issue 
[21].
While the focus of this research paper is on virtual reality (VR) assisted 
by AI in medicine, the rapid advancement of AI technology allows VR 
platforms to enhance medical professionals’ visual perception throughout 
treatment and surgery phases. VR systems provide additional cognitive 
signals during surgical or training procedures enabling experts to visualize 
clinical information in an easier-to-understand format. In a virtual envi￾ronment, experts can access more data regarding treatment with the help of 
AI-powered VR approaches. A deep learning-based procedure was imple￾mented to enable critical care, achieving automatic segmentation of the 
skull, facial skin, and the ventricles. Additionally, VR driven by AI has the 
potential to completely transform remote medical education and telemed￾icine, particularly in impoverished or underserved regions. By integrating 
real-time analytical functionalities with virtual reality, AI algorithms will 
provide prompt diagnostic assistance, enhancing decision-making pro￾cedures in both non-clinical and clinical contexts. In addition, through 
giving excellent health services distantly, these advances may address the 
discrepancies among medical fairness, excellence, and affordability.
12.4.3 Possibilities and Obstacles When Fusing AI with VR
The primary barriers to the application of AI-enabled VR in healthcare 
are the accuracy of information and accessibility. Constructing effective AI 
systems requires large, diverse samples. The data remain scattered and dif￾ficult to find, though. In addition, this is a difficult endeavor that calls for 
organizational and technical alterations to integrate state-of-the-art AI–
VR advancements with existing processes and healthcare establishments.

Moral dilemmas must be resolved, especially those involving the confiden￾tiality of patients, security of information, and well-informed approval. The 
unaddressed topic of accountability in AI–VR-related errors compounds 
the governing setting for officials, technological corporations, and health￾care providers. Furthermore, the achievement of reliability and authentic￾ity in VR models is a challenging scientific task that is required for the 
successful delivery of healthcare instruction as well as treatment. The black 
box nature of certain AI tools might render it challenging to customers to 
have faith in them, as doctors typically require to know the way AI rec￾ommendations are generated. The development of user-friendly interfaces 
with a wide range of consumers and assisting physicians and patients in 
overcoming their opposition to innovation are additionally essential to the 
widespread adoption of AI-enabled VR models [22].
Examples of leading cutting-edge gadgets that have restricted energy 
storage and computational ability include mobiles and AR/VR headphones. 
Large computational capabilities are needed for executing learning tech￾niques regionally that may swiftly drain the power source and harm the 
electrical parts of the gadget. Furthermore, implementing large, compli￾cated AI systems having an elevated energy requirement for VR and AR 
applications on edge computers having low storage might be difficult. In 
addition, a large variety of gadgets with different technology specs as well 
as operating systems make up the VR environment. Finally, by processing 
data locally and eliminating the need for continuous cloud-based transfers 
of information, edge computing improves privacy. However, this approach 
also introduces security vulnerabilities [23].
Some key challenges of the Metaverse are that even if the Metaverse’s 
technological capabilities nearly resemble those of the real world, certain 
experiences are better had in reality. Software-wise, the core with excel￾lent compatibility in the Metaverse environment is comprised of programs 
written in the Metaverse sans requiring coding. But in a big system, the 
software eventually reaches its complexity limit as it becomes more intri￾cate. Every citizen of the community—children, seniors, individuals with 
disabilities, and people of all races and ethnicities—must be able to access 
the Metaverse. There might be a variety of materials in the Metaverse; thus, 
we need to make sure that each and every one can access them. To decrease 
biased material and thereby affect user behavior and the decision-making 
process, it is also crucial to take into account personalized content presen￾tation in front of users and improve the fairness of the recommendation 
algorithm. One description of vast cyberspace is the Metaverse. Because 
of this, cyberbullying in the Metaverse may inevitably pose a social risk

13.1 Introduction
For any battery-dependent device to perform optimally, it is crucial to 
consider the performance of energy storage model. This ensures that the 
device meets the requirements for performance, cost effectiveness, effi￾ciency, and environmental sustainability. Battery factors, as well as the 
inclusion of balancing circuits mechanisms, play a key role in achieving 
these goals. The battery plays a crucial role in any device that relies on 
battery power serving as a key energy source and enabling portability. 
With the rise in climate change, the focus on renewable and clean energy is 
becoming increasingly crucial. Norway has become the first country to ban 
fuel-based cars by 2025 promoting the growth of EVs [1]. Programs, like 
the Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E), are funded 
by US-DOE, which recently announced a $50M funding for the Battery500 
project. In addition to the automobile manufacturing sector, the econom￾ics of decentralized energy production are quite favorable. Efficient utili￾zation of systems derived from various renewable sources relies heavily on 
the effectiveness of energy storage technologies [2]. This system ensures 
the safe and efficient operation of batteries in various devices like EVs. This 
system oversees the battery’s current, voltage, and temperature, predicts 
SOC, and calculates the remaining time until the battery is fully discharged. 
The device includes components and circuitry for protecting against over￾and under-voltage, as well as other restrictions [3]. Figure 13.1 illustrates a 
standard battery system.

Battery deployment can be classified into the following categories:
A. Mobility: The device can be classified into many sorts based on its usage. 
Stationary systems are commonly used in electric grids [4].
 i. Computing Power: The system’s pool of computing 
resources may be divided into many categories. Every 
category possesses a corresponding response time and 
dependability.
 ii. Sensors: They build the framework by giving system data 
such as temperature, voltage, current, and GPS.
 iii. Programmability: Systems frequently have chargers that 
may be programmed to follow instructions from the BMS 
controller and determine how to charge or discharge a 
device.
Section 13.2 discusses the different battery-related attributes. In Section 
13.3, the text outlines the computational techniques, strategies, controllers, 
and optimizations used in battery management. Section 13.4 discusses the 
IoT innovation in BMS. Section 13.5 emphasizes sustainable developments 
through BMS. Section 13.6 includes the conclusions and future trends.
13.2 Current Battery Technologies
This section provides a comprehensive discussion and analysis of the dif￾ferent battery attributes currently under development. Lithium-ion batter￾ies can be replaced by sodium-ion and lithium–sulfur batteries, which have 
superior depth of discharge and less of an influence on the environment. 
Similar to lithium–air batteries, there are still certain technological prob￾lems that need to be fixed, such as insufficient cycle life [5]. The selected 
battery technologies’ specific energy and energy density are shown in Table 
13.1 and Figure 13.2.
Lithium salt in organic solvents makes up LIB liquid electrolytes. This 
design may provide serious safety issues because of the flammability, leak￾ing, and toxicity of the electrolyte. Liquid electrolyte cells lack certain ben￾efits that solid-state batteries do. It is to mention improved energy density 
to reduce production costs as in Figure 13.3 [6].

13.2.1 Metal–Air Battery
It is significant for their weight. Zinc, aluminum, magnesium, and calcium 
are among the various metal–air batteries that can be used, in addition to 
lithium–air batteries, which possess 2.91 V. Aluminum–air batteries are 
more stable than lithium–air batteries, which have 13.2 kW/kg (like gaso￾line). Metal–air batteries’ theoretical specific energy is seen in Figure 13.4. 
Due to alkaline electrolytes’ poor specific power and carbonation, batteries 
have a limited lifespan and high internal resistance. Researchers are work￾ing to overcome these issues.

13.2.2 Lithium–Sulfur Battery
In lithium–sulfur batteries, organic liquid acts as the electrolyte, sulfur 
composite, and lithium metal. Lithium-ion batteries are also a good option 
for future energy storage applications due to their affordability, abundant 
sulfur supply, and absence of necessary components. This battery type 
has a reduced environmental footprint, and sulfur can be obtained from 
recycled materials. The LiSB cell has a nominal voltage of 2.1 V. The LiSB

battery can achieve a 100% depth of discharge, while the LIB battery can 
only reach 80%. The LiSB also has a long lifespan predicted to be 10 years. 
LiSBs are projected to be market ready with an energy density of 500 Wh/
kg. When a thermal runaway happens, using an electrode based on sulfur 
may cause specific dangerous gases to escape, including H2
S, SO2
, COS, 
and CS2
. To improve the battery’s performance, using a trustworthy battery 
management solution is highly advised.
13.2.3 Batteries Beyond Lithium
The ongoing research are exploring many ways to switch to less expensive 
and more sustainable light metals like sodium rather than lithium. It is 
challenging to design robust, long-lasting electrodes with rapid charge and 
discharge rates. The goal of the Chinese company CATL is 200 Wh•kg−1.
Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) work like Li-ion batteries. Sodium, the 
fourth most abundant element, is cheap and abundant. NIBs have a faster 
capacity drop and worse cycle life than LiBs. High-temperature operating 
batteries based on sodium have now been offered in 2022. The parameters 
of Li-ion micro-batteries are provided in Table 13.2.
13.3 Battery Energy Storage and Management
Electric batteries can store large amounts of energy for a long time. Figure 
13.5 shows that protection is a Battery Management System’s major func￾tion. Maintaining cell balance and aging requires cell monitoring. BMS 
allows specified system structure irregularity cures. Additionally, system 
temperature affects power usage; Battery Management System enables

temperature regulation. Hybrid and electric car battery management 
technologies are explored. This study discussed the issues of the existing 
Battery Management System assessment of a battery’s health, charge, and 
life (a serious operation) [7]. By evaluating current battery condition eval￾uation methodologies, BMS issues and solutions are identified.
This study examines the electromagnetic interference (EMI) sensitivity 
of lithium-polymer (LiPo) and lithium-ion Battery Management Systems 
(BMSs) for usage in electric and hybrid cars. EMC system simulation is 
used to create a demonstration board for a BMS. It describes how an EMC 
system simulation enhances board design by identifying the underlying 
reason. A test board that experimentally activated the BMS EMI vulner￾ability is only partially described in research. By analyzing the processes 
of EMI-induced inadequacies that were seen during testing, tentative 
results were described. The thermal behavior of battery packs under power 
requirements has not been well studied. The expected thermal estimation 
model is classified by heat dissipation, resistance, reversible heat, and Joules 
heating. Characterization of hybrid pulse power regulates and measures 
the resistances of charge intermissions. The battery effects and restrictions 
of high-power charging models are studied using optimization techniques. 
Power sources’ power distribution is maximized [8].
A suggested management technique takes into account the charging 
and discharging power of grid-connected storage devices to maximize 
their energy efficiency, which is an additional pulse period-based tech￾nique for estimating pulse power. Reasonable accuracy was ensured by 
regression analysis methodology, since their state of health inaccuracy 
was less than 1%. There is no standard for battery management systems 
in electric cars, small appliances, or major applications. This study might

offer a methodical investigation of BMS for transportation, electrification, 
and extensive (stationary) applications with targeted regulation given the 
significance of BMS and its role in ESS safety. The components, designs, 
and safety alternatives related to battery management and operating sys￾tems are covered in this study, which is shown in Figure 13.6. To build the 
new standard, it also analyses technological concepts connected to BMS. 
Electrical networks are changing their main generators, loads, and oper￾ating methods to favor intelligent device interaction to better technical, 
economical, and environmental circumstances. These changes optimize 
energy utilization and improve network users’ lives [9].
Multiple energy management solutions for alternating current networks 
have been proposed in the literature. Such initiatives focus on DGs, mostly 
solar energy-based ones, to enhance network technical, financial, and 
environmental variables. They also use energy storage to control renew￾able power source variability and capitalize on electrical network energy 
demand and production cost fluctuations. These solutions enable adher￾ence to the electrical devices’ functional and technological limitations, 
which integrate the network while managing the power of distributed 
energy resources [10].

This research focuses on it; therefore, the following are a few studies that 
address the subject. A small number of researchers optimized the oper￾ation of PV generators and batteries in conjunction. The Cplex solver of 
GAMS was utilized to solve a mixed-integer linear programming model 
for the combined PV–battery system. Energy storage systems in electrical 
networks are configured and operated by scientists using convex optimi￾zation and CVXGEN. This study aimed to reduce energy losses and green￾house gas emissions in a 33-node metropolitan network for 1 day. To prove 
the methodology’s efficacy, MATLAB CVX solves the model and simulates 
various scenarios.
In three-phase distribution networks, it is utilized in conjunction with 
semidefinite programming models and second-order cone programming to 
control the energy of storage devices. This study aimed to lower energy costs 
and power losses at the point of substation. YALMIP/MOSEK was solved 
after the GAMS model. This study aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emis￾sions and energy losses in test systems for 33 and 69 nodes in metropolitan 
networks during a 1-day period. Despite the fact that the numerical results 
showed how successful the recommended methodology was, they were not 
compared to alternative methods found in the specialist literature. There 
was no analysis done on the solution approach’s processing times. Achieving 
optimal energy storage device functioning minimizes installation costs by 
accounting for maximum power utilization, energy acquisition costs, and 
battery lifetime. They used MATLAB and GAMS to solve an optimization 
model for multi-integer linear programming. The strategy’s success was 
proven by the numerical findings. The abovementioned methods produce 
better solution outputs and enhance the technical, economical, and environ￾mental aspects of networks using commercial software. By improving energy 
storage devices, the evolutionary technique reduced losses of energy in an 
urban distribution network using alternating current. This invention lowered 
the energy costs associated with ordinary generators. Three literature-based 
methods—a continuous genetic algorithm, a parallel particle swarm optimi￾zation, and a black hole optimization method—were surpassed by the solu￾tion technique. Processing times, standard deviation, and solution quality all 
indicated that the suggested approach was effective. Additionally, a mode￾based energy management technique is created for a stand-alone PV DG, 
battery, and load network. Technological and network operating limitations 
were guaranteed by this approach [11].
Our state-of-the-art review shows that many authors have worked hard 
to design sequential programming-based intelligent algorithms. This tech￾nique improves network technical, financial, and environmental param￾eters without commercial software. However, researchers must develop

strategies to produce efficient answers and repeatability in less time using 
parallel processing approaches. Such plans should also improve the pri￾mary indicators of rural and urban connected and standalone networks. 
Most attempts have been undertaken in connected metropolitan networks, 
while fossil fuel-based isolated rural networks face the biggest energetic 
challenges. In a distributed energy resource scenario, the suggested meth￾ods should also guarantee that the mathematical model and solutions 
correspond with the practical and technological constraints of alternating 
current networks. Last, the solutions have to function effectively in both 
rural and urban systems, the latter of which are linked to a network distinct 
from Colombia’s national interconnection system.
This study used the demands and difficulties of the state-of-the-art eval￾uation to address energy management in everyday operation of alternating 
current networks in urban and rural areas. The recommended approach 
controlled the maximum power charging and discharging of network 
batteries in a daily solar-powered distributed producing scenario. For 
rural networks in Capurganá (Chocó) and urban networks in Medellín 
(Antioquia), we examined the generation and consumption patterns for 
electricity. We’ve thought of combining three different types of lithium-ion 
batteries with three different photovoltaic producing units that maxi￾mize the energy potential of the area. The challenge was controlling bat￾tery energy in rural and urban networks to reduce CO2
 emissions, energy 
losses, and costs associated with conventional generator purchases and 
distributed energy resource maintenance. Table 13.3 provides the details 
of various battery management of components, functions, algorithms, tar￾gets, and outcomes. Figure 13.7 provides the details of battery parameters,

13.4 IoT and Cloud Computing Technology in BMS
The system’s efficiency and automation have been enhanced through 
research on utilizing cloud computing. This includes intelligent decision 
making regarding battery charging, discharging, and power source opti￾mization. In addition, when combining the power sharing approach, it can 
significantly enhance device availability by optimizing energy consumption 
within certain SoC ranges during service. Cloud computing has enabled 
the development of a highly organized V2G model. Cloud infrastructure 
is essential for managing V2G as the number of vehicles increases. The 
experimental analysis of the model is well optimized and efficient. The 
cloud-based system helps cut down on expenses. This device is designed 
to measure PV and battery features, process the data, and generate reports 
according to specific needs. All parameters are saved automatically in the 
cloud. The study also demonstrated the possibility of creating comprehen￾sive training sets offline significantly streamlining power control [12].
Utilizing the Internet of Things, the battery-related data are seamlessly 
computed and transmitted to the cloud. This process creates a digital twin 
allowing battery diagnostic algorithms to analyze the data for charge and 
age assessment. Examining analogous circuit models in battery system dig￾ital twins can enhance the performance forecasts. This text is well articu￾lated. An adaptive H-infinity filter that has the ability to produce resilient 
SoC, this cutting-edge health prediction system utilizes particle swarm 
optimization to monitor the battery’s energy levels, which decrease over 
time. Experiments in the field and with smartphones were conducted to 
assess the functionality and reliability [13].
This system monitors various local servers to a centralized data center 
and ICC-PGCEM scheduler. Requests from cloud clients are stored before 
being scheduled. The energy consumption calculator assumes uniform 
server behavior. Therefore, incoming client requests use servers in a simi￾lar manner. There is a wide variety of servers used in data centers.
Intelligent agent and data mining engine ICC-PGCEM scheduler mon￾itors storage, CPU, and network consumption with machine learning 
energy framework. Multiple linear regression is used in the ICC-PGCEM 
model. Figure 13.8 denotes data mining engine architecture logs energy 
usage and utilization numbers for power management applications. In an 
intelligent server agent environment, the ICC-PGCEM scheduler learns 
from client needs to offer frequent power usage mentorship.

operating time, and cost savings are all improved by the EEH design over 
single-solution methods. tracking for battery management was developed. 
As a proof of concept, ten IoT prototype IAQ sensor nodes and one LoRa 
gateway were placed in a four-story construction with an upper frame￾work strengthened by steel and a concrete foundation. IoT nodes detect 
temperature, humidity, pressure, CO2
, GVO, and PM. Because IoT nodes 
have both digital and analog interfaces, the device can easily monitor more 
gases [14]. Energy demand, customer preferences, real-time power pricing 
(RTP), and factors pertaining to renewable energy are a few examples of 
inputs. To minimize costs and user annoyance GA is employed to sched￾ule and control household load. Now, power costs USD51 as opposed to 
USD228. The PAR is now 1.12 instead of 2.68. Both the need for electricity 
and carbon emissions may be reduced using cloud storage. First, as this 
paper demonstrates, server farms situated at inexpensive energy produc￾tion locations, virtualized servers—which use less energy than distributed 
servers—and storage in organizations all contribute to lower power usage 
and carbon footprints. The second benefit comes from its indirect support 
of distributed renewable energy source tracking and management in the 
grid, as well as integrated computing and data storage services. Figure 13.9 
illustrates cloud computing for equipment batteries [15].

The cloud-based technology simplifies data storage and processing, 
especially created data. Cloud computing lets multiple applications share 
and compute the same data cutting expenses since most sensors and other 
devices may concentrate on their tasks while processing takes place in the 
cloud. Since the late 1990s, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been develop￾ing and may interact via a variety of protocols and technologies.
The selection of technology is contingent upon three factors:
The distance between the device and the server is known as the range.
Power: Total power expended during data transmission.
Bandwidth: Amounts of data transferred.
Power systems are designed to provide device monitoring and mainte￾nance more efficiently and cheaply.
The power system can benefit from such a system, especially for peo￾ple who cannot frequent the power station due to COVID-19 or natural 
calamities. ICC has been examined in several papers on many topics and 
perspectives.

sources. A cloud computing framework will store and manage these pro￾cesses and data. Any power distribution system that wants to decrease cost, 
power waste, and time can benefit from cloud computing. The detailed 
research gaps identified are listed in Table 13.4.

stations and support e-mobility research and development, including bat￾tery solutions. The UK government has set a target to decrease CO2
. To 
achieve the goal, 43% must be electric [16]. Recently, the US government 
initiative to boost electric car battery production. Research published indi￾cates a rapid increase in the EV in Flanders, Belgium. Based on data from 
a comprehensive poll in 2011, projections suggested that by 2020, battery 
electric vehicles would make up approximately 5% of new vehicle sales, 
with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles comprising approximately 7%. This 
statement highlights how the EV market contributes to achieving Target 
8.6 by generating job opportunities for young people, reducing youth 
unemployment, and boosting per capita income. The job opportunities 
provided will help local children access more education and increase their 
chances of finding employment, as many projects will hire people from the 
area. This will have a positive effect on 8.1 and 8.3 targets.
13.5.2 SDG9
Electric vehicles play a crucial role in helping achieve Target 9.1 by sup￾porting the development of reliable, top-notch infrastructure that enhances 
both social welfare and economic progress. A study revealed that inves￾tigating climate resilient methods can facilitate better environment and 
community. Establishing a publicly accessible replenishing facility system 
is crucial for promoting the adoption of electric vehicles. GHG emissions 
linked to traditional fuel vehicles decrease improving the urban environ￾ment. One of the main challenges in getting residents to adopt electric vehi￾cles is the availability and characteristics of charging stations. Introducing 
publicly accessible CS systems enhances the EV customer journey by 
improving the ease of use of infrastructural facilities [17]. Encouraging the 
creation and eventual development of a sustainable local CS system poses 
a significant challenge over cities and local officials. EVs are well suited for 
urban areas, where most housing in BC is located, due to their range and 
emission-reducing capabilities.
13.5.3 SDG12
Utilizing EV-incorporated distributed generation of electricity, smart 
grids, and microgrids can facilitate efficient energy distribution between 
supply and load aligning with Target 12.1. Bringing together a large num￾ber of EVs into VPPs offers ecological benefits such as energy conservation 
and pollution reduction, safety advantages related to the stable operation 
of the electrical grid, and economic incentives for VPPs and automotive

stakeholders. In the long run, an increasing number of electric vehicles will 
be integrated into Virtual Power Plants due to their numerous benefits. EVs 
in transmission lines are evolving into controlled commodities through 
V2G technology allowing them to carry out different auxiliary operations 
like maximizing energy harvesting, stabilizing voltage, and regulating fre￾quency. There is evidence that shows how EV-BESs positively affect SDG12, 
specifically Target 12.5, which aims to significantly reduce waste by mini￾mizing, recycling, and reusing. Research indicates that the Battery Energy 
Storage of an Electric Vehicle will either be reused, discarded, or have its 
components retrieved based on the specific application. When materials 
from lithium-ion batteries are recycled, it can lower the power density by 
10%–53%. Additionally, the cost of constructing lithium–oxygen batteries 
can drop leading to decreased greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling bat￾tery elements helps decrease the use of fossil sources and reduces waste 
production. Despite the positive employability outlook, the transition 
to electric-powered transport will have both winners and losers. Due to 
the global shift toward electric vehicles, job losses are expected in the oil 
industry, petrol stations, and the automotive repair as EVs demand less 
maintenance than traditional vehicles. Manufacturing batteries requires 
fewer jobs than producing gasoline-powered vehicles, emission structures, 
emission control networks, gasoline tracking devices, gearboxes, and 
automotive components. By 2030, projections suggest that Germany may 
face a loss of thousands of jobs due to the transition to electric vehicles. 
Manufacturing, research and development, and the production of batteries 
will all contribute to job creation. Setting up and maintaining the equip￾ment utilized in EVs will generate indirect job opportunities. It is probable 
that there will be fewer positions available in the EV sector compared to 
those who work in ICEV [18]. Moreover, electric vehicles have lower main￾tenance and operating costs, which can affect employment both directly 
and indirectly. According to Energy Data Administration, over 80% of the 
cost quickly exits the domestic economy. If fuel costs are lowered, more 
money will circulate within the community ultimately boosting the local 
economy. New York City residents drive significantly less compared to 
the average US metropolitan area, which helps to retain 19 billion USD 
within the city’s economy each year. This article highlights the connection 
between batteries and energy from renewable sources, all of which con￾tribute to positive environmental impacts and support the relevant SDGs. 
Below, we will discuss the pros and cons of electric vehicles in relation to 
the environment.

13.5.4 SDG13
EVs offer significant benefits for the climate by reducing emissions from tra￾ditional energy sources commonly used in renewable energy production. In 
addition, due to the progress of EV solutions, numerous countries are integrat￾ing environmental initiatives into their legislative proposals. In 2018, the IPCC 
projected that electric need to replace fossil fuel-powered passenger vehicles 
by 2035–2050 to limit global warming to below 1.5 _C. Addressing environ￾ment-related issues and integrating green tasks into social initiatives, schemes, 
and management are the focus of Targets 13.1 and 13.2. By 2050, strategies 
suggest that the combination of EVs and RE will lead to a 70% decrease in 
CO2
 emissions in the electricity sector. EVs are strongly recommended in var￾ious studies for a modern, reliable, and eco-friendly energy solution. Electric 
vehicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular for their ability to replace 
traditional power sources by transporting and storing electricity making them 
a more cost-effective option. Considering the falling price of energy from 
renewable sources and the increasing scarcity of fossil fuels, a sustainable 
approach is necessary to guarantee widespread access to power by combining 
sustainable energy and BESSs with EVs. Various studies have agreed that elec￾tric vehicles have negative environmental impacts. At times, hazardous and 
flammable components are used, requiring significant energy input and lead￾ing to high levels of greenhouse gas emissions [19]. Consequently, the BESS 
could act as a barrier to achieving Target 13.1’s aim of decreasing climate￾related risks. The BESS’s components could have significant environmental 
consequences potentially causing harm. Electric vehicles seem to offer a prom￾ising solution to address climate concerns, as transitioning to carbon-free net￾works could significantly reduce automobile emissions. Great news for electric 
vehicles as numerous countries are currently prioritizing the decarbonization 
of their power systems. Over the past few decades, energy providers in the 
United States have transitioned away from coal facilities to embrace to reduce 
emissions. Researchers have found that electric vehicles have become more 
environmentally friendly overall and are expected to continue improving.
13.6 Conclusion
Several studies have been prompted by the impact of global warming to 
reduce carbon emissions. Industries are a significant source of carbon 
emissions, but they are making strides in reducing their environmental 
impact through technological advancements. Yet, technology advancement 
necessitates the consideration of various factors. This chapter thoroughly

techniques focusing on algorithms, controllers, and optimization, all aimed 
at achieving SDGs. Discussion included multiple battery storage technolo￾gies and components of battery management. Each battery technology has 
distinct performance characteristics. Hence, it is important to take into 
account the battery features before applying them to industrial require￾ments. Furthermore, cutting-edge methods, algorithms, and optimization 
approaches were explored. It was reported that each algorithm and optimi￾zation technique for industrial application deliver satisfactory outcomes. 
Yet, the issue of computational complexity and lengthy training time still 
requires attention. Next, we identified the unresolved problem limitations 
and research gaps. Exploring the combination of different technologies, 
like battery storage systems, optimization approaches, and algorithms is 
crucial for the efficient advancement of industrial technology. Finally, a 
range of SDG targets linked to BMS have been examined and assessed.
