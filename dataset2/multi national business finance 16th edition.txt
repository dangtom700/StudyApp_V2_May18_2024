New to This Edition
Our continuing challenge is to strike a balance between being one of the very first textbooks 
in this field (and therefore in many ways defining the field) and introducing the many new 
concepts and components in global business today, from digital currencies to global fintech. 
We have hopefully found some balance between what is valued by continuing adopters 
and the valued insights of selected reviewers—the innovator’s dilemma. Surveys of adopt￾ers were extremely useful in this revision, and a number of specific recommendations were 
included.
■ Corporate Governance, Activists, and Stakeholder Capitalism. Chapter 4 on corporate 
governance, including elements of ownership, financial objectives, and the growing role of 
activist investors, has been revised and expanded. Of special note is the growth of stake￾holder capitalism and its multiple objective framework as compared to stockholder wealth 
maximization.
■ The Impossible Trinity. A core international financial principle, the Impossible Trin￾ity’s use as a unifying theoretical link across multiple subjects—whether it be Iceland’s 
financial crisis or choices made by the European Union on capital flows—is increasingly 
leveraged.
■ The Foreign Exchange Market and Digital Trade. New material in this edition explores 
in depth how the changing structure of the global foreign exchange market—trading, com￾munication, and settlement—is posing challenges for private players and public regulators 
and overseers.
■ Currency Manipulation. This is a politically charged topic between the U.S. and China, 
and we explore in depth the motivations, methods, and metrics associated with currency 
manipulation. Included is a new mini-case that seeks to determine whether China is or is 
not a currency manipulator.
■ Emerging Market Regimes. The sixteenth edition offers new insights into the currency 
and capital regime choices of many emerging market countries; many recognizing that they 
are trade-dependent economies in search of currency stability in lieu of attracting other 
capital account elements such as foreign direct investment.
■ International Taxation. Integrally linked to a world of digital commerce, multinational tax 
management continues to rise in its significance in multinational financial management. We 
have expanded our coverage of this critical determinant of global finance, with emphasis 
on the constantly changing U.S. tax rates and rules.
■ Political Risk and Financial Losses. The chapter on foreign direct investment and political 
risk has been revised to reflect the growing use of restrictions on convertibility, transfer￾ability, and the possibility of repudiation or expropriation.
A01_EITE5960_16_GE_FM.indd 5 10/07/23 4:45 PMSolving Teaching and Learning Challenges 
Multinational Business Finance is the financial management of multinational enterprises 
(MNEs)— multinational financial management . MNEs are firms and organizations of all kinds 
and sizes—for-profit companies, family-owned businesses, sovereign states, and nongovern￾mental organizations (NGOs), among others—that have operations in more than one coun￾try and conduct their activities through a multitude of structures and contracts from wholly 
owned foreign subsidiaries to joint ventures with local or global partners to host governments. 
 Moreover, global business and finance, all the way down to the trading of currencies, has 
been revolutionized by digital platforms from electronic trading to the coming introduction 
of digital currencies, all adding to the complexity of international business. 
Multinational Business Finance , Sixteenth Edition, is aimed at university-level courses 
in international financial management, international business finance, international finance, 
and similar titles. It can be used either at the graduate level or in executive education and 
corporate learning courses. 
 A prerequisite course or experience in corporate finance or financial management would 
be ideal. However, we review the basic finance concepts before we extend them to the multi￾national case. We also review the basic concepts of international economics and international 
business. 
 Over many years and many editions, as we ourselves have used the book in courses from 
Hyderabad to Helsinki to Honolulu, we have observed an ever-widening audience for this 
book. We continue to try to service this greater global audience with multicountry companies, 
markets, and challenges, whether in theoretical applications, practice boxes, mini-cases, or 
end-of-chapter problems.

Organization
Multinational Business Finance has been redesigned and restructured for tightness—critical 
elements of the field but in a much shorter delivery framework. This has been accomplished 
by integrating a number of previous topics along financial management threads. The book is 
in five parts, the parts unified by the common thread of the globalization process by which a 
firm moves from a domestic to a multinational business orientation.
■ Part 1 introduces the global financial environment.
■ Part 2 explains foreign exchange theory and markets.
■ Part 3 explores foreign exchange rate exposure.
■ Part 4 details the financing of the global firm.
■ Part 5 analyzes international investment decisions.
Pedagogical Tools
To make the book as comprehensible as possible, we use a large number of proven pedagogi￾cal tools. Again, our efforts have been informed by the detailed reviews and suggestions of 
a panel of professors who are recognized individually for excellence in the field of interna￾tional finance, particularly at the undergraduate level. Among these pedagogical tools are the 
following:
■ A student-friendly writing style combined with a structured presentation of material, begin￾ning with learning objectives for each chapter and ending with a summarization of how 
those learning objectives were realized.
The two-tier structure which separated the Interdealer Market and Customer
Market for so many years is effectively gone. Today’s system, dominated by
electronic trading, allows customers of all kinds direct access to global trading.
Constructed by authors based on a number of sources including “Foreign Exchange Market Structure, Players and Evolution,” Michael R. King,
Carol Osler and Dagfinn Rime, Norges Bank, Working Paper, Research Department, 2011, 10, p. 21, and “The anatomy of the global FX market
through the lens of the 2013 Triennial Survey,” by Dagfinn Rime and Andreas Schrimpf, BIS Quarterly Review, December 2013.

EXHIBIT B Comparison of SOFR and Overnight USD LIBOR
The continuing popularity of our mini-cases has prompted us to introduce 11 new mini￾cases in the sixteenth edition. The new topics, among others, include the following:
■ Global fintech. Global fintech’s continuing role in opening the emerging world to global 
finance.
■ Digital currencies. The rise of digital currencies like the Chinese eYuan.
■ Toshiba’s corporate governance challenges.
■ International remittances. The role international remittances may play in alleviating 
global income inequality and opportunity.
■ Replacing LIBOR. The rationale and complexity of replacing the global financial system’s 
interest rate centerpiece—LIBOR.
■ Currency volatility. The rise and fall of currency volatility during the year of COVID.
■ Google tax. The U.S. development of what many term “the Google tax.”
■ Saudi Aramco. The initial public offering of the world’s most profitable company, Saudi 
Aramco.
A01_EITE5960_16_GE_FM.indd 8 10/07/23 4:45 PMPreface 9
■ Hostile acquisitions. A detailed exploration of one of the world’s most hostile interna￾tional acquisitions, Mittal’s acquisition of Arcelor.
■ Global Finance in Practice boxes in every chapter highlight how real firms and real manag￾ers deal with the never-ending complexity of executing global business deals in a changing 
marketplace, from the mundane accounts payable to the exceptional expropriation. These 
applications extend the concepts without adding to the length of the text itself.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 13.1 
are defined as small businesses, and firms with revenue 
medium-sized according 
to the European Union. This segment of borrowers is par￾ticularly sensitive to these changes as many of these firms 
use only one bank for the majority of their financial services. 
Without alternative banks, offering either alternative services 
or competitive rates, they are starting to feel the impacts of 
reduced services and increased costs. As a result of rising 
bank fees and fewer alternatives, borrowers have experi￾enced rising costs of debt.
How this will ultimately impact business activity is hard to 
say, but early signs from these segments are not encouraging. 
Some experts, including Professor Aswath Damodaran of New 
York University’s Stern School of Business, have been encour￾aging companies to focus on the three drivers of business 
valuation—cash flows, growth rates, and discount rates—and 
not fall victim to pessimism. He has characterized Brexit as a 
“garden variety crisis” that most businesses should endure. A 
number of firms, however, have cut back on new investment 
projects. Rising capital costs make fewer prospective invest￾ments financially viable. A number of borrowers have noted 
that their firms will intentionally now work to increase their 
cash balances—a form of precautionary source of funds—as 
they fear reduced access to affordable debt.
The decision for the United Kingdom to leave the European 
Union is resulting in more and more companies having a 
higher cost of capital on both sides of the Channel. A restruc￾turing of the banking sectors in both regions involves direct 
costs as well as more segmented markets, all at a time when 
global interest rates—dollar, pound, and euro—are expected 
to start rising as the post-COVID stimulus programs fall fur￾ther and further into the past.
Impacts on Banks. Banks in the UK are already incurring 
sizeable restructuring costs. A number of London banks have 
been moving quickly to move large portions of their opera￾tions and jobs to the Continent in an effort to retain clients and 
market share. London banks are estimating that restructuring 
-
lion. The costs of capital for banks themselves are expected 
to rise at least 4%, and many are looking to increase their 
capital bases by more than 30% as they establish European 
banks to retain Continental clients.
Impacts on Borrowers. One of the unintended results is a 
multitude of banks are reducing their lines of credit and in￾creasing their fees to many of the small to medium-sized en￾Brexit and the Cost of Capital
■ A multitude of end-of-chapter questions and problems assess the students’ understanding 
of the course material. All end-of-chapter problems are solved using spreadsheet solutions. 
Selected end-of-chapter problem answers are included at the back of this book.
■ Numerous mathematical derivations, such as parity conditions, foreign currency option pric￾ing, and complex option products, are placed in appendices. This allows selective use as the 
student or faculty member feels appropriate.

M01A_EITE5960_16_GE_P01.indd 23 02/05/23 5:15 PMThe subject of this book is the financial management of multinational enterprises (MNEs)—
multinational financial management. MNEs are firms—both for-profit companies and 
not-for-profit organizations—that have operations in more than one country and conduct 
their business through branches, foreign subsidiaries, or joint ventures with host country firms.
It is a brave new world, a new world in which digital startups may become multinational en￾terprises in hours, where the number of publicly traded companies on earth is shrinking, where 
the most challenging competitors are arising from emerging markets, and where more and more 
value is being created by “idea firms.” The global marketplace is seeing change—radical, disrup￾tive, rapid, whatever terminology you prefer—from the growing role of the Chinese currency, 
the yuan; the continuing recuperative efforts to economies following the global pandemic; or the 
possible sea change likely to come from the introduction of digital currencies. In 2021 the world 
even saw the first country, El Salvador, adopt a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, as legal tender. In the 
following chapters we will explore everything from how the international financial community is 
in the process of changing its global benchmark (LIBOR) of the past 50 years, to the changes in 
currency volatility during the global pandemic, to the entry of the world’s most profitable com￾pany (Saudi Aramco) into the public security markets. Change is indeed the constant.
Multinational financial management requires managers and leaders all over the world to 
identify and navigate the prospective returns and risks of the global financial marketplace. 
These risks may all occur on the playing field of the global financial marketplace, but they are 
still a question of management—of navigating complexity in pursuit of the goals of the firm 
and all of its varied stakeholders.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1.1 Explore the global financial marketplace—players and playing field
1.2 Consider how the theory of comparative advantage applies to multinational business
1.3 Examine how international financial management differs from domestic financial 
management
1.4 Discover the steps and stages of the globalization process
The objects of a financier are, then, to secure an ample revenue; to impose it with judg￾ment and equality; to employ it economically; and, when necessity obliges him to make 
use of credit, to secure its foundations in that instance, and forever, by the clearness and 
candor of his proceedings, the exactness of his calculations, and the solidity of his funds.

M01B_EITE5960_16_GE_C01.indd 24 03/05/23 7:56 PMCHAPTER 1 Multinational Financial Management: Opportunities and Challenges 25
 This first chapter provides a brief overview of the global financial landscape including 
foreign currency markets and financial institutions—the ground rules and nomenclature of 
the game. We then explore the foundations of comparative advantage, those forces differ￾entiating international from domestic finance. We conclude our introductory overview with 
the alternative paths firms may take in going global. The chapter concludes with a mini-case, 
Global Fintech , that examines how financial technology is changing all financial functions 
and services, how it offers the power to overcome barriers to access and inclusion across the 
globe, but also how its adoption faces many political and institutional barriers along the way. 
1. 1 The Global Financial Marketplace 
 Business—domestic, international, global—involves the interaction of individuals and indi￾vidual organizations for the exchange of products, services, and capital across markets. The 
global capital markets and business marketplace is in many ways the field of play. This is 
the landscape upon which the daily activities of global business play out. Like all institu￾tions created by humans, it is constantly changing, yet certain fundamental components rarely 
change. We begin by exploring the institutional and behavioral landscape of global business— 
specifically, the organizations and assets that make up the global financial marketplace. 
 Assets, Institutions, and Linkages 
Exhibit 1. 1 provides an overview of the global capital markets. One way to characterize the 
global financial marketplace is through its securities and institutions, all linked through the 
interbank market.

The global capital market is a collection of institutions (central banks, commercial banks, investment banks, not-for￾profit financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank) and securities (bonds, mortgages, derivatives, loans, etc.),
which are all linked via a global network—the Interbank Market. This interbank market is the critical pipeline system
for the movement of capital
The exchange of securities, the movement of capital in the global financial system, must all take place through
a vehicle—currency. The exchange of currencies is itself the largest of the financial markets. The interbank market,
which must use currencies, bases its pricing through the single most widely quoted interest rate in the world—LIBOR
(the London Interbank Offered Rate).
 EXHIBIT 1. 1 Global Capital Markets 
M01B_EITE5960_16_GE_C01.indd 25 03/05/23 7:56 PM26 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
Securities. The securities—financial assets—at the heart of the global capital markets are the 
debt securities issued by highly industrialized country governments (e.g., U.S. Treasury Bonds, 
U.K. gilts). These low-risk or risk-free securities form the foundation for the creation, trading, 
and pricing of other financial securities like bank loans, corporate bonds, and equities (stock). 
In recent years, a number of additional securities—derivatives—have been created from exist￾ing securities, the value of which is based on market value changes of the underlying securities. 
The health and security of the global financial system rely on the quality of these securities.
Institutions. The institutions of global finance are the central banks, which create and con￾trol each country’s money supply; the commercial banks, which take deposits and extend 
loans to businesses, both local and global; and the multitude of other financial institutions 
created to trade securities and derivatives. These institutions take many shapes and are sub￾ject to many different regulatory frameworks. The health and security of the global financial 
system rely on the stability of these financial institutions.
Linkages. The links between the financial institutions, the actual fluid or medium for exchange, 
are the interbank networks using currency. The ready exchange of currencies in the global mar￾ketplace is the first and foremost necessary element for the conduct of financial trading, and the 
global currency markets are the largest markets in the world. The exchange of currencies, and the 
subsequent exchange of all other securities globally via currency, is the international interbank 
market. This network, whose primary price is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), is 
the core component of the global financial system. (In Chapter 8 we will examine the interna￾tional effort to replace LIBOR and what it may mean for financial instruments and markets.)
The movement of capital across currencies and continents for the conduct of business has 
existed in many different forms for thousands of years. Yet it is only within the past 50 years 
that the velocity of these capital movements has increased to the pace of an electron in the 
digital marketplace. And it is only within the past 20 years that this market has been able to 
reach the most distant corners of the earth at any moment of the day. The result has been an 
explosion of innovative products and services—some for better and some for worse.
The Market for Currencies
The price of any one country’s currency in terms of another country’s currency is called a 
foreign currency exchange rate. For example, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar (indi￾cated by the symbols $ or USD) and the European euro (€ or EUR) may be stated as “1.1274 
dollars per euro” or simply abbreviated as $1.1274 = €1.00. This exchange rate can also be 
stated as “USD1.1274 = EUR1.00” using the three-digit ISO codes. Since most international 
business activities require at least one of the two parties in a business transaction to either 
pay or receive payment in a currency that is different from their own, an understanding of 
exchange rates is critical to the conduct of global business.
Currency Symbols. As noted, USD and EUR are often used as the symbols for the U.S. 
dollar and the European Union’s euro. These are the computer symbols (ISO-4217 codes) 
used today on the world’s digital networks. The financial press, however, has a rich history of 
using a variety of different symbols, and a variety of different abbreviations are commonly 
used. For example, the British pound sterling may be indicated by £ (the pound symbol), 
GBP (Great Britain pound), STG (British pound sterling), ST£ (pound sterling), or UKL 
or UK£ (United Kingdom pound). This book uses both the simpler common symbols—the 
$ (dollar), the € (euro), the ¥ (yen), the £ (pound)—and the three-letter ISO codes.
Exchange Rate Quotations and Terminology. Exhibit 1.2 lists currency exchange rates 
for June 19, 2021, as would be quoted in New York or London. Each exchange rate listed is 
for a specific country’s currency against the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the British pound. The

rate listed is termed a “midrate” because it is the middle or average of the rates at which cur￾rency traders buy currency (bid rate) and sell currency (offer rate).
The U.S. dollar has been the focal point of currency trading since the 1940s. As a re￾sult, most of the world’s currencies are quoted against the dollar—Mexican pesos per 
dollar, Brazilian real per dollar, Hong Kong dollars per dollar, etc. They are also fre￾quently quoted against other major world currencies like the euro and pound. For ex￾ample, the Japanese yen is commonly quoted against the dollar, euro, and pound, as 
¥110.38 = $1.00, ¥130.99 = €1.00, and ¥152.59 = £1.00, as illustrated in Exhibit 1.2.
Quotation Conventions. Several of the world’s major currency exchange rates follow a 
specific quotation convention that is the result of tradition and history. The exchange rate 
between the U.S. dollar and the euro is always quoted as “dollars per euro” or $ = €1.00—for 
example, $1.1867 listed in Exhibit 1.2 for “United States.” Similarly, the exchange rate be￾tween the U.S. dollar and the British pound is always quoted as “dollars per pound” or $ =
£1.00—for example, $1.3824 listed for “United States” in Exhibit 1.2. In addition, countries 
that were formerly members of the British Commonwealth will often be quoted against the 
U.S. dollar, as in U.S. dollars per Australian dollar.
Global Finance in Practice 1.1 introduces the topic that is fundamental to this entire field 
of study, the quotation of currencies.
If exchange rates never changed, the global financial marketplace would be a much 
kinder, simpler place. But, alas, that is not the case. Exchange rates change, and when they 
do, they alter the business results and competitiveness of all players on the playing field. As 
illustrated in the following section, it requires a careful calculation of even the amount of the 
change—percentage change.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 1.1
quote provides the value of one unit of the base currency 
in terms of the underlying currency. This makes it easy to 
list currencies in tables and databases as it eliminates the 
need for details like “Renminbi per pound.”
■ Third, all these quotes are different from the way curren￾cies were quoted for decades, when the common way to 
express these would have been ¥ 7.8259/£, spoken as 
¥7.8259 per pound.
Our objective in this book is to both educate and inform 
the reader with how international finance is conducted and 
communicated in the modern world. That means we will use 
both forms of currency symbols, the ISO-4217 codes and 
symbols like £, $, and ¥. In certain cases, you may note that 
the same symbol is used for more than one currency. For 
Example, the U.S. dollar, Singapore dollar, and Australian 
dollar use the same symbol, $. The standardized ISO-4217 
codes eliminate this confusion (USD, SGD, and AUD).
The final difference is that the quotes rates are slightly 
different from each other. This is because the forex market is 
the only financial market that operates 24*7 as at least one 
currency zone is always operating at any given point in time. 
Also, different organizations use different sources to obtain 
their rates and sometimes the markets may not be in per￾fect sync with each other. However, it is much more complex 
than this, a subject best left for Chapter 5. Now back to your 
previously scheduled program.
Exchange Rate Quotations
Foreign exchange rate refers to the per unit value of a given 
currency in terms of another currency. Seemingly a very simple 
concept—except it is not. For example, on October 7, 2022, 
the following were the spot currency quotes across three major 
business and financial data sources for the value of the British 
pound sterling (GBP) in terms of the Chinese renminbi (CNY):
Financial Times GBPCNY 7.8467
Bloomberg GBP-CNY 7.8259
Xe.com GBP/CNY 7.8819
To be clear, all three are saying nearly the same thing: that the 
value of one British pound is equivalent to seven renminbi and 
85 fen (one hundred fen equals one renminbi). However, there 
are some unique characteristics that highlight the differences.
■ First, they use the three-letter ISO-4217 code for each 
currency. For example, GBP instead of British pound 
sterling or £, or CNY instead of renminbi or ¥. This is 
how the rates are expressed in the financial markets. Yet, 
many news organizations and contemporary media still 
commonly use symbols like £, $, €, or ¥.
■ Second, the order of the currency codes is the same, GBP 
and then CNY. In this standardized format the first curren￾cy (GBP) is the “base” currency and the second currency 
(CNY) is known as the “underlying” currency. A standardized

Percentage Change in Spot Exchange Rates
Assume that the Mexican peso has recently changed in value from MXN 16.00 = USD 1.00 to 
MXN 20.00 = USD 1.00. If your home currency is the U.S. dollar (USD), what is the percent 
change in the value of the Mexican peso (MXN)? The calculation depends upon the desig￾nated home currency.
Foreign Currency Terms. When the foreign currency price (the price, MXN) of the home 
currency (the unit, USD) is used, Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar in this case, the formula for 
the percent change (%Δ) in the foreign currency becomes
%∆ = Begin rate - End rate
End rate
: 100 = MXN16.00 - MXN20.00
MXN20.00
: 100 = -20.00%
The Mexican peso fell in value 20% against the dollar. Note that it takes more pesos per dol￾lar, and the calculation resulted in a negative value, both characteristics of a fall in value.
Home Currency Terms. When the home currency price (the price, USD) for a foreign cur￾rency (the unit, MXN) is used—the reciprocals of the foreign exchange quotes above—the 
formula for the percent age change in the foreign currency is
%∆ = End rate - Begin rate
Begin rate
: 100 = USD0.05000 - USD0.06250
USD0.06250
: 100 = - 20.00%
The calculation yields the identical percentage change, a fall in the value of the peso by 
–20%. Many people find the home currency terms calculation to be the more intuitive be￾cause it reminds them of a general percentage change calculation (ending value less begin￾ning value over beginning value); however, one must be careful to remember that these are 
exchanges of currency for currency, and the currency that is designated as the home currency 
is important.
The fall of the Argentine peso in 2015 serves as a clear example of percentage change. 
On December 16, 2015, the government of Argentina announced it would lift currency con￾trols; it would no longer restrict the ability of its citizens to move money out of the country. 
Over the next 24 hours, as Argentinians took advantage of this new freedom, the value of 
the Argentine peso fell from ARG 9.7908 per U.S. dollar to 13.6160, as pesos poured out of 
Argentina into the foreign exchange markets.
%∆ = Begin rate - End rate
End rate
: 100 = ARG9.7908 - ARG13.6160
ARG13.6160
: 100 = - 28%
After the 28% drop in the value of the peso against the U.S. dollar, the peso stabilized. But 
a fall in its value of that magnitude, 28%, was both dramatic and devastating for some. The 
change in exchange rates is the first example of our next subject—risk.
Financial Globalization and Risk
Back in the halcyon pre-crisis days of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it was taken 
as self evident that financial globalization was a good thing. But the subprime crisis and 
eurozone dramas are shaking that belief . . . what is the bigger risk now—particularly in 
the eurozone—is that financial globalization has created a system that is interconnected in 
some dangerous ways.
 —“Crisis Fears Fuel Debate on Capital Controls,” Gillian Tett, Financial Times, December 15, 2011.
M01B_EITE5960_16_GE_C01.indd 29 03/05/23 7:56 PM30 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
Much of the discussion dominating global financial markets today is centered on the complex￾ity of risks associated with financial globalization—the discussion goes far beyond whether 
such globalization is simply good or bad and encompasses ways to lead and manage multina￾tional firms in the rapidly moving marketplace. The following is but a sampling of risks that 
must be explored, considered, and—ultimately—managed.
■ The international monetary system, an eclectic mix of floating and managed fixed ex￾change rates, is under constant scrutiny. The rise of the Chinese renminbi is changing 
much of the world’s outlook on currency exchange, reserve currencies, and the roles of 
the dollar and the euro (see Chapter 2).
■ Large fiscal deficits, including the continuing eurozone crisis, plague most of the major 
trading countries of the world, complicating fiscal and monetary policies and, ultimately, 
leading to the use of negative interest rates in an attempt to stimulate economies and 
protect currencies (see Chapter 3).
■ Many countries experience continuing balance of payments imbalances and, in some cas￾es, dangerously large deficits and surpluses—whether it be the twin surpluses enjoyed by 
China, the current account surplus of Germany, or the continuing current account deficits 
of the United States and United Kingdom, all will inevitably move exchange rates (see 
Chapter 3).
■ Ownership and governance vary dramatically across the world. The publicly traded com￾pany is not the dominant global business organization; the privately held firm or the 
state-owned enterprise dominates in many countries, changing corporate objectives and 
expectations for financial performance (see Chapter 4).
■ Global capital markets that normally provide the means to lower a firm’s cost of capital 
and, even more critically, increase the availability of capital, have in many ways shrunk 
in size and have become less open and accessible to many of the world’s organizations 
(see Chapter 2).
■ Today’s emerging markets are confronted with a new dilemma: the problem of first be￾ing the recipients of capital inflows and then of experiencing rapid and massive capital 
outflows. Financial globalization has resulted in the ebb and flow of capital into and 
out of both industrial and emerging markets, greatly complicating financial management 
(Chapters 5 and 8).
Eurocurrencies and Eurocurrency Interest Rates
One of the major linkages of global money and capital markets is the eurocurrency market.
Eurocurrencies. Eurocurrencies are domestic currencies of one country on deposit in a 
second country. For example, a U.S. dollar deposit in a British bank, a eurodollar deposit, is 
one type of eurocurrency. Banks will pay interest on these deposits—eurocurrency interest—
depending on the agreed-upon maturity—a period ranging from overnight to more than a 
year or longer. Eurocurrency deposits are digitally transferred between banks.
The eurocurrency market serves two valuable purposes: (1) eurocurrency deposits are 
an efficient and convenient money market device for holding excess corporate liquidity; and 
(2) the eurocurrency market is a major source of short-term bank loans to finance corporate 
working capital needs, including the financing of imports and exports.
Any convertible currency can exist in “euro” form. Note that this use of the “euro” prefix 
should not be confused with the European currency called the euro. The eurocurrency mar￾ket includes eurosterling (British pounds deposited outside the United Kingdom), euroeuros 
(euros on deposit outside the eurozone), euroyen (Japanese yen deposited outside Japan), 
and eurodollars (U.S. dollars deposited outside the U.S.).
M01B_EITE5960_16_GE_C01.indd 30 03/05/23 7:56 PMCHAPTER 1 Multinational Financial Management: Opportunities and Challenges 31
Banks in which eurocurrencies are deposited are called eurobanks. A eurobank is a fi￾nancial intermediary that simultaneously bids for time deposits and makes loans in a cur￾rency other than that of its home currency. Eurobanks are major world banks that conduct 
a eurocurrency business in addition to all other banking functions. Thus, the eurocurrency 
operation that qualifies a bank for the name eurobank is, in fact, a department of a large com￾mercial bank, and the name springs from the performance of this function.
The modern eurocurrency market was born shortly after World War II. Eastern European 
holders of dollars, including the various state trading banks of the Soviet Union, were afraid 
to deposit their dollar holdings in the United States because those deposits might be attached 
by U.S. residents with claims against communist governments. Therefore, Eastern Europeans 
deposited their dollars in Western Europe, particularly with two Soviet banks: the Moscow 
Narodny Bank in London and the Banque Commerciale pour l’Europe du Nord in Paris. 
These banks redeposited the funds in other Western banks, especially in London. Additional 
dollar deposits were received from various central banks in Western Europe, which elected to 
hold part of their dollar reserves in this form to obtain a higher yield. Commercial banks also 
placed their dollar balances in the market because specific maturities could be negotiated in 
the eurodollar market. Such companies found it financially advantageous to keep their dollar 
reserves in the higher-yielding eurodollar market. Various holders of international refugee 
funds also supplied funds.
Although the basic causes of the growth of the eurocurrency market are economic ef￾ficiencies, many unique institutional events during the 1950s and 1960s contributed to its 
growth.
■ In 1957, British monetary authorities responded to a weakening of the pound by impos -
ing tight controls on U.K. bank lending in sterling to nonresidents of the United King￾dom. Encouraged by the Bank of England, U.K. banks turned to dollar lending as the 
only alternative that would allow them to maintain their leading position in world 
finance. For this they needed dollar deposits.
■ Although New York was “home base” for the dollar and had a large domestic money and 
capital market, international trading in the dollar centered in London because of that 
city’s expertise in international monetary matters and its proximity in time and distance 
to major customers.
■ Additional support for a European-based dollar market came from the balance of pay￾ments difficulties of the U.S. during the 1960s, which temporarily segmented the U.S. 
domestic capital market.
Ultimately, however, the eurocurrency market continues to thrive because it is a large 
international money market relatively free from governmental regulation and interference. 
The attitude of governments toward market intervention, such as the possible intentional 
undervaluation of one’s own currency, is the subject of Global Finance in Practice 1.2.
Eurocurrency Interest Rates. The reference rate of interest in the eurocurrency market 
is the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. LIBOR is the most widely accepted 
rate of interest used in standardized quotations, loan agreements, or financial derivatives 
valuations. The use of interbank offered rates, however, is not confined to London. Most 
major domestic financial centers construct their own interbank offered rates for local 
loan agreements. Examples of such rates include PIBOR (Paris Interbank Offered Rate), 
MIBOR (Madrid Interbank Offered Rate), SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate), 
and FIBOR (Frankfurt Interbank Offered Rate), to name just a few. But as prevalent 
and central LIBOR is to the global financial system, it is now slated for replacement, the 
subject of our mini-case in Chapter 8.
M01B_EITE5960_16_GE_C01.indd 31 03/05/23 7:56 PM32 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
The key factor attracting both depositors and borrowers to the eurocurrency loan mar￾ket is the narrow interest rate spread within that market. The difference between deposit 
and loan rates is often less than 1%. Interest spreads in the eurocurrency market are small 
for many reasons. Low lending rates exist because the eurocurrency market is a wholesale 
market where deposits and loans are made in amounts of $500,000 or more on an unsecured 
basis. Borrowers are usually large corporations or government entities that qualify for low 
rates because of their credit standing and because the transaction size is large. In addition, 
overhead assigned to the eurocurrency operation by participating banks is small.
Deposit rates are higher in the eurocurrency markets than in most domestic currency 
markets because the financial institutions offering eurocurrency activities are not subject to 
many of the regulations and reserve requirements imposed on traditional domestic banks 
and banking activities. With these costs removed, rates are subject to more competitive pres￾sures, deposit rates are higher, and loan rates are lower. A second major area of cost savings 
associated with eurocurrency markets is that deposit insurance (such as the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation [FDIC]) and other assessments paid on deposits in the United States, 
for example, are unnecessary.
1.2 The Theory of Comparative Advantage
The theory of comparative advantage provides a basis for explaining and justifying interna￾tional trade in a model world assumed to enjoy free trade, perfect competition, no uncer￾tainty, costless information, and no government interference. The theory’s origins lie in the 
work of Adam Smith, and particularly his seminal book, The Wealth of Nations, published 
in 1776. Smith sought to explain why the division of labor in productive activities, and sub￾sequently international trade of goods produced, increased the quality of life for all citizens. 
Smith based his work on the concept of absolute advantage, with every country specializing 
in the production of those goods for which it was uniquely suited. More would be produced 
for less. Thus, with each country specializing in products for which it possessed absolute ad￾vantage, countries could produce more in total and trade for goods that were cheaper in price 
than those produced at home.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 1.2
held across Africa. Countries like Nigeria use all possible ways 
to maintain their currency at a value that many in the world 
believe is either slightly overvalued or about equilibrium, but 
hardly ever will one find a currency significantly undervalued.
That’s not to say that African currencies are famously 
solid. The Zimbabwe currency is infamous in its inability to 
maintain its value as a result of bouts of hyperinflation and 
rampant money printing by the government. And there are 
others. But the international markets keep a watchful eye on 
any African country’s currency showing any sign of weak￾ness and will pounce (or maybe flee is the more appropri￾ate term) if they smell smoke. For much of Africa, however, 
maintaining the value of their currency is a matter of pride and 
demonstrated resilience and stability, and even if a weaker or 
cheaper home currency might help boost exports and there￾fore their economy, in their eyes, the “cost” is too much.
Why Don’t African Countries Undervalue Their 
Currencies?
One of the oldest strategies to promote a country’s exports is 
to undervalue its currency, maintain its traded value against 
other currencies at a rate of exchange that makes it relatively 
cheap. And if the currency is cheap, products that are priced 
in that currency—the country’s exports—will be relatively 
cheap. And, theoretically, cheaper prices mean greater sales. 
It is not a secret that many of the countries of south Asia 
maintained undervalued currencies for many years in pursuit 
of export-led growth. If it worked for them, why not Africa?
A representative of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
once encouraged the president of Tanzania to weaken its cur￾rency. The president, Julius Nyerere, responded, “I will devalue 
the shilling over my dead body.” That perspective is commonly 
M01B_EITE5960_16_GE_C01.indd 32 03/05/23 7:56 PMCHAPTER 1 Multinational Financial Management: Opportunities and Challenges 33
In his work On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, published in 1817, David 
Ricardo sought to take the basic ideas set down by Smith a few logical steps further. Ricardo 
noted that even if a country possessed absolute advantage in the production of two goods, it 
might still be relatively more efficient than the other country in one good’s production than the 
production of the other good. Ricardo termed this comparative advantage. Each country would 
then possess comparative advantage in the production of one of the two products, and both 
countries would benefit by specializing completely in one product and trading for the other.
Although international trade might have approached the comparative advantage model 
during the nineteenth century, it certainly does not today, for a variety of reasons. Countries 
do not appear to specialize only in those products that could be most efficiently produced 
by that country’s particular factors of production. Instead, governments interfere with com￾parative advantage for a variety of economic and political reasons, such as to achieve full 
employment, economic development, national self-sufficiency in defense-related industries, 
and protection of an agricultural sector’s way of life. Government interference takes the form 
of tariffs, quotas, and other non-tariff restrictions.
At least two of the factors of production—capital and technology—now flow directly 
and easily between countries, rather than only indirectly through traded goods and services. 
This direct flow occurs between related subsidiaries and affiliates of multinational firms, as 
well as between unrelated firms via loans and license and management contracts. Even labor 
can flow between countries to varying degrees, such as immigrants into the EU from North 
Africa and the Middle East and then in turn between states in the EU.
Modern factors of production are more numerous than in this simple model. Factors con￾sidered in the location of production facilities worldwide include managerial skills, a depend￾able legal structure for settling contract disputes, research and development competence, 
educational levels of available workers, energy resources, consumer demand for brand name 
goods, mineral and raw material availability, access to capital, tax differentials, supporting 
infrastructure (roads, ports, and communication facilities), and possibly others.
Although the terms of trade are ultimately determined by supply and demand, the pro￾cess by which the terms are set is different from that visualized in traditional trade theory. 
They are determined partly by administered pricing in oligopolistic markets.
Comparative advantage shifts over time as less-developed countries become more devel￾oped and realize their latent opportunities. For example, over the past 150 years, comparative ad￾vantage in producing cotton textiles has shifted from the United Kingdom to the United States, 
to Japan, to Hong Kong, to Taiwan, and to China. The classical model of comparative advantage 
also does not address certain other issues such as the effect of uncertainty and information costs, 
the role of differentiated products in imperfectly competitive markets, and economies of scale.
Nevertheless, although the world is a long way from the pure theory of comparative advan￾tage, the general principle of comparative advantage is still valid. The closer the world gets to 
true international specialization, the more world production and consumption can be increased, 
provided that the problem of equitable distribution of the benefits can be solved to the satisfac￾tion of consumers, producers, and political leaders. Complete specialization, however, remains an 
unrealistic limiting case, just as perfect competition is a limiting case in microeconomic theory.
Comparative advantage is still a relevant theory to explain why particular countries are 
most suitable for exports of goods and services that support the global supply chain of both 
MNEs and domestic firms. The comparative advantage of the twenty-first century, however, is 
one that is based more on services and their cross-border facilitation by telecommunications 
and the Internet. The source of a nation’s comparative advantage, however, is still the mixture 
of its own labor skills, access to capital, and technology.
The extent of global outsourcing is already reaching every corner of the globe. From 
financial back offices in Manila to information technology engineers in Hungary, modern 
M01B_EITE5960_16_GE_C01.indd 33 03/05/23 7:56 PM34 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
telecommunications now bring business activities to labor rather than moving labor to the 
places of business.
1.3 What Is Different About International Financial 
Management?
Exhibit 1.3 details some of the main differences between international and domestic financial 
management. These component differences include institutions, corporate governance, foreign ex￾change, political risks, and the modifications required of financial theory and financial instruments.
Multinational financial management requires an understanding of cultural, historical, 
and institutional differences such as those affecting corporate governance. Although both 
domestic firms and MNEs are exposed to foreign exchange risks, MNEs alone face certain 
unique risks, such as political risks, that are not normally a threat to domestic operations. 
MNEs also face other risks that can be classified as extensions of domestic finance theory.
For example, the normal domestic approach to the cost of capital, sourcing debt and eq￾uity, capital budgeting, working capital management, taxation, and credit analysis needs to be 
modified to accommodate foreign complexities. Moreover, a number of financial instruments 
that are used in domestic financial management have been modified for use in international 
financial management. Examples are foreign currency options and futures, interest rate and 
currency swaps, and letters of credit.
The main theme of this book is to analyze how an MNE’s financial management evolves 
as it pursues global strategic opportunities and as new constraints emerge. In this chapter, 
we introduce the challenges and risks associated with Aidan Corporation (Aidan), a com￾pany we use as an example throughout this book. Aidan is a company evolving from being 
domestic in scope to becoming truly multinational. The discussion includes constraints that 
a company will face in terms of managerial goals and governance as it becomes increasingly

involved in multinational operations. But first we need to clarify the unique value proposition 
and advantages that the MNE was created to exploit.
Market Imperfections: A Rationale for the Existence 
of the Multinational Firm
MNEs strive to take advantage of imperfections in national markets for products, factors 
of production, and financial assets. Imperfections in the market for products translate into 
market opportunities for MNEs. Large international firms are better able to exploit such 
competitive factors as economies of scale, managerial and technological expertise, product 
differentiation, and financial strength than are their local competitors. In fact, MNEs thrive 
best in markets characterized by international oligopolistic competition, where these factors 
are particularly critical. In addition, once MNEs have established a physical presence abroad, 
they are in a better position than purely domestic firms to identify and implement market op￾portunities through their own internal information network.
Why Do Firms Go Global?
Strategic motives drive the decision to invest abroad and become an MNE. These motives 
can be summarized under the following categories:
1. Market seekers produce in foreign markets either to satisfy local demand or to export to 
markets other than their home market. U.S. automobile firms manufacturing in Europe 
for local consumption are an example of market-seeking motivation.
2. Raw material seekers extract raw materials wherever they can be found, either for 
export or for further processing and sale in the country in which they are found—the 
host country. Firms in the oil, mining, plantation, and forest industries fall into this 
category.
3. Production efficiency seekers produce in countries where one or more of the factors of 
production are underpriced relative to their productivity. Labor-intensive production of 
electronic components in Taiwan, Malaysia, and Mexico is an example of this motivation.
4. Knowledge seekers operate in foreign countries to gain access to technology or mana￾gerial expertise. For example, German, Dutch, and Japanese firms have purchased U.S. 
electronics firms for their technology.
5. Political safety seekers acquire or establish new operations in countries that are consid￾ered unlikely to expropriate or interfere with private enterprise. For example, Hong Kong 
firms invested heavily in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia in 
anticipation of the consequences of China’s 1997 takeover of the British colony.
These five types of strategic considerations are not mutually exclusive. Forest products 
firms seeking wood fiber in Brazil, for example, may also find a large Brazilian market for a 
portion of their output.
In industries characterized by worldwide oligopolistic competition, each of the afore￾mentioned strategic motives should be subdivided into proactive and defensive investments. 
Proactive investments are designed to enhance the growth and profitability of the firm itself. 
Defensive investments are designed to deny growth and profitability to the firm’s competitors. 
Examples of the latter are investments that try to preempt a market before competitors can 
get established in it or capture raw material sources and deny them to competitors. But as 
highlighted by Global Finance in Practice 1.3, the objectives and responsibilities of the mod￾ern multinational enterprise have grown significantly more complex with these elements.

1.4 The Globalization Process
Aidan Corporation is a hypothetical Irish firm that is used as an illustrative example through￾out the book to demonstrate the phases of the globalization process—the structural and 
managerial changes and challenges experienced by a firm as it moves its operations from 
domestic to global.
Global Transition I: Domestic Phase to the International Trade Phase
Aidan is a young firm that manufactures and distributes an array of telecommunication 
equipment. Its initial strategy is to develop a sustainable competitive advantage in the Irish 
market. Like many other young firms, it is constrained by its small size, competitors, and lack 
of access to cheap and plentiful sources of capital. The top half of Exhibit 1.4 shows Aidan in 
its early domestic phase.
Aidan sells its products in euros to Irish customers and buys its manufacturing and ser￾vice inputs from Irish suppliers, paying euros. The creditworthiness of all suppliers and buyers 
is established under European practices and procedures. A potential issue for Aidan at this 
time is that, although Aidan is not international or global in its operations, some of its com￾petitors, suppliers, or buyers may be. This is often the impetus to push a firm like Aidan into 
the first phase of the globalization process—into international trade. Aidan was founded in 
Dublin by Aidan McClafferty in 1960 to make telecommunication equipment. The family￾owned business expanded slowly but steadily over the following 60 years. The demands of 
continual technological investment in the 1990s, however, required that the firm raise addi￾tional equity capital in order to compete. This need for capital led to its initial public offering 
(IPO) in 1998. As an Irish publicly traded company on Euronext Dublin, Aidan’s manage￾ment sought to create value for its shareholders.
As Aidan became a visible and viable competitor in the Irish market, strategic opportunities 
arose to expand the firm’s market reach by exporting products and services to one or more for￾eign markets. The European Economic Area (EEA) made trade with other European countries 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 1.3
goodness, corporate responsibility, corporate social respon￾sibility (CSR), corporate philanthropy, and corporate sustain￾ability, to list but a few. Confusion can be reduced by using 
a guiding principle—that sustainability is a goal, while re￾sponsibility is an obligation. It follows that the obligation of 
leadership in the modern multinational is to pursue profit, so￾cial development, and the environment, all along sustainable 
principles.
The term sustainability has evolved greatly within the 
context of global business in the past decade. A traditional 
primary objective of the family-owned business has been 
the “sustainability of the organization”—the long-term abil￾ity of the company to remain commercially viable and pro￾vide security and income for future generations. Although 
narrower in scope, the concept of environmental sustain￾ability shares a common core thread—the ability of a com￾pany, a culture, or even the earth to survive and renew 
over time.
Corporate Responsibility and Corporate 
Sustainability
Sustainable development is development that meets the 
needs of the present without compromising the ability of 
future generations to meet their own needs. 
—Brundtland Report, 1987, p. 54.
What is the purpose of the corporation? It is accepted that 
the purpose of the corporation is to certainly create profits 
and value for its stakeholders, but the responsibility of the 
corporation is to do so in a way that inflicts no costs on so￾ciety, including the environment. As a result of globalization, 
this growing responsibility and role of the corporation in soci￾ety have added a level of complexity to the leadership chal￾lenges faced by the multinational firm.
This developing controversy has been somewhat ham￾pered to date by conflicting terms and labels—corporate 
M01B_EITE5960_16_GE_C01.indd 36 03/05/23 7:56 PMCHAPTER 1 Multinational Financial Management: Opportunities and Challenges 37
such as Norway and Iceland attractive. This second phase of the globalization process is shown 
in the lower half of Exhibit 1.4.
Aidan responded to these globalization forces by importing inputs from Norwegian sup￾pliers and making export sales to Icelandic buyers. We define this phase of the globalization 
process as the International Trade Phase. Exporting and importing products and services in￾crease the demands of financial management over and above the traditional requirements of 
the domestic-only business in two ways. First, direct foreign exchange risks are now borne by 
the firm. Aidan may now need to quote prices in foreign currencies, accept payment in foreign 
currencies, or pay suppliers in foreign currencies. As the values of currencies change from min￾ute to minute in the global marketplace, Aidan will increasingly experience significant risks 
from the changing values associated with these foreign currency payments and receipts.
Second, the evaluation of the credit quality of foreign buyers and sellers is now more 
important than ever. Reducing the possibility of non-payment for exports and non-delivery 
of imports becomes a key financial management task during the international trade phase. 
This credit risk management task is much more difficult in international business, as buyers 
and suppliers are new, subject to differing business practices and legal systems, and generally 
more challenging to assess.
Global Transition II: The International Trade Phase 
to the Multinational Phase
If Aidan is successful in its international trade activities, the time will come when the glo￾balization process will progress to the next phase. Aidan will soon need to establish foreign 
sales and service affiliates. This step is often followed by establishing manufacturing opera￾tions abroad or by licensing foreign firms to produce and service Aidan’s products. The mul￾titude of issues and activities associated with this second, larger global transition is the real 
focus of this book.
Aidan’s continued globalization will require it to identify the sources of its com￾petitive advantage, and with that knowledge, expand its intellectual capital and physi￾cal presence globally. A variety of strategic alternatives are available to Aidan—the

foreign direct investment sequence—as shown in Exhibit 1.5. These alternatives include 
the creation of foreign sales offices, the licensing of the company name and everything 
associated with it, and the manufacturing and distribution of its products to other firms 
in foreign markets.
As Aidan moves further down and to the right in Exhibit 1.5, the extent of its physical 
presence in foreign markets increases. It may now own its own distribution and production 
facilities, and ultimately, it may want to acquire other companies. Once Aidan owns assets and 
enterprises in foreign countries, it has entered the multinational phase of its globalization.
The Multinational Enterprise’s Consolidated Financial Results
Aidan will create more and more foreign subsidiaries as it expands globally. Some MNEs 
may only have one foreign subsidiary, while others, like Johnson & Johnson (U.S.), have 
nearly 200. Each subsidiary will have its own set of financial statements and results (income 
statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flow). Each subsidiary is also likely operating 
in a different currency, subject to differing tax rates, accounting practices such as deprecia￾tion, and a multitude of other financial parameters. The company, however, must periodically 
consolidate all those financial results and report them in the currency of its home country.
Exhibit 1.6 illustrates a simplified income statement consolidation for Aidan. Assuming 
that Irish-based Aidan has two foreign subsidiaries, one in Malaysia and one in Turkey, in 
addition to its Irish operations, it converts the various income statement items to euros 
from Malaysian ringgit and Turkish lira at the average exchange rate for each currency pair 
for the period (in this case, the year). As we will see in later chapters, this process results 
in a number of currency risks and exposures, as exchange rates may change in ways that 
increase or decrease consolidated results.

The Limits to Financial Globalization
The theories of international business and international finance introduced in this chapter 
have long argued that with an increasingly open and transparent global marketplace in which 
capital may flow freely, capital will increasingly flow and support countries and companies 
based on the theory of comparative advantage. Since the mid-twentieth century, this has in￾deed been the case as more and more countries have pursued more open and competitive 
markets. But the past decade has seen the growth of a new kind of limit or impediment to fi￾nancial globalization: the increasing influence and self-enrichment of organizational insiders.
One possible representation of this process can be seen in Exhibit 1.7. If influential insiders in 
corporations and sovereign states continue to pursue the increase in firm value, there will be a defi￾nite and continuing growth in financial globalization. But if these same influential insiders pursue 
their own personal agendas, which may increase their personal power and influence or personal 
wealth, or both, then capital will not flow into these sovereign states and corporations. The result 
is the growth of financial inefficiency and the segmentation of globalization outcomes creating 
winners and losers. As we will see throughout this book, this barrier to international finance may 
indeed become increasingly troublesome. This growing dilemma is also something of a composite 
of what this book is about. The three fundamental elements—financial theory, global business, and 
management beliefs and actions—combine to present either the problem or the solution to the 
growing debate over the benefits of globalization to countries and cultures worldwide.
We close this chapter and open this book with the simple words of one of our colleagues 
on the outlook for global finance and global financial management:
Welcome to the future. This will be a constant struggle. We need leadership, citizenship, 
and dialogue. 
—Donald Lessard, in Global Risk, New Perspectives and Opportunities, 2011, p. 33.
EXHIBIT 1.6 Selected Consolidated Income Results for Aidan (Ireland)
As an Irish-based multinational company, Aidan must consolidate the financial results (in this case, sales and earnings 
from the income statements) of foreign subsidiaries. This requires converting foreign currency values into euros.
Aidan, for the year shown, generated 61.3% of its global sales in Ireland, with those Irish sales making up 58.9% of its consolidated profits. From 
quarter to quarter and year to year, both the financial performance of the individual subsidiaries will change in addition to exchange rates.

If these influential insiders are building personal wealth over that of the firm, it will indeed result in preventing
the flow of capital across borders, currencies, and institutions to create a more open and integrated global
financial community.
There is a growing debate over whether many of the insiders and rulers of organizations with enterprises
globally are taking actions consistent with creating firm value or consistent with increasing their own
personal stakes and power.

■ The creation of value requires combining three critical 
elements: (1) an open marketplace, (2) high-quality 
strategic management, and (3) access to capital.
■ The theory of comparative advantage provides a basis 
for explaining and justifying international trade in a 
model world of free and open competition.
■ International financial management requires an un￾derstanding of cultural, historical, and institutional dif￾ferences, such as those affecting corporate governance.
■ Although both domestic firms and MNEs are exposed 
to foreign exchange risks, MNEs alone face certain 
unique risks, such as political risks, that are not nor￾mally a threat to domestic operations.
■ MNEs strive to take advantage of imperfections in na￾tional markets for products, factors of production, and 
financial assets.
■ The decision whether or not to invest abroad is driven 
by strategic motives and may require the MNE to 
enter into global licensing agreements, joint ventures, 
cross-border acquisitions, or greenfield investments.
■ If influential insiders in corporations and sovereign 
states pursue their own personal agendas, which may 
increase their personal power, influence, or wealth, 
then capital will not flow into these sovereign states 
and corporations. This will, in turn, create limitations 
to globalization in finance.
terment for many. Fintech could conceptually include any 
technology associated with the movement of or transactions 
involving money. The abacus, cash register, and automated tell￾er machine (ATM) are all examples of financial technological 
developments. The term today is more commonly associated 
with online payments processing, such as AliPay, PayPal, or M￾Pesa and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin.2

Fintech—financial technology—will, in the eyes of some, revo￾lutionize the world. To others, it is just the most recent evo￾lutionary stage of the financial industry. It has, however, the 
power to overcome barriers of access and inclusion to people 
in many countries, altering the trajectory of economic bet￾MINI-CASE

Many of these developments and platforms use blockchain technology. Blockchain is an encrypted list of records, called blocks, that 
are linked together. Although fundamental to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it is not a uniquely financial technology.

and Consumed,” World Economic Forum, Prepared in collaboration with Deloitte, Final Report, June 2015.
But fintech is much more than just payments process￾ing or cryptocurrencies.3
 Developments in financial tech￾nology associated with Internet access and mobile commu￾nications can potentially disrupt nearly every dimension of 
financial services. At present, across the globe, from Kenya 
to Kathmandu, new platforms and processes and products 
are advancing as rapidly as most nations will allow them to. 
The potential for fintech across countries will in many ways 
cross three different axes of national development: (1) lev￾el of economic development, (2) financial sector infrastruc￾ture, and (3) bank/financial services regulatory landscapes. 
But like all technologies, they are not inherently good or 
evil; the societal outcome depends on how they are applied.
Financial Landscape
Access to critical financial services, such as payments, 
savings and insurance, helps people improve their lives. 
But access is unequal and poor people and small firms 
typically have many fewer options. Fintech has shown 
its potential to close gaps in the delivery of financial ser￾vices to households and firms in emerging markets and 
developing economies. Initially, such benefits were chan￾neled via mobile money and digital payments solutions.
Research conducted at country and regional level, and 
more recently at global level, has shown the effectiveness 
of such solutions for financial inclusion. Other types of 
fintech firms, such as lending and capital raising plat￾forms, are showing their potential to improve access to 
finance for underserved groups, including SMEs, 
although these platform solutions are still at an early 
stage in the majority of emerging markets and develop￾ing economies. Finally, firms that provide supporting 
services such as credit scoring or digital ID solutions are 
helping to expand the benefits of fintech across the en￾tire financial sector. —“The Global Covid-19 FinTech Market 
Rapid Assessment Study,” World Bank Group, 2020, p. 8.
What is fintech’s real potential? Which societal financial 
functions are likely to be impacted? A basic overview of 
which financial functions and services society utilizes has 
been somewhat missing from the discussion. The World Eco￾nomic Forum offered up a basic description of the financial 
landscape, what it called the Wheel, a number of years ago 
that is helpful in understanding the multitude of financial 
service sectors that could potentially be impacted by fintech. 
The Wheel identifies six sectors of potential impact.4
1. Payments. The execution of payment processing for 
both B2C and B2B transactions was the first and gener￾ally easiest financial service to be impacted by fintech. 
The movement toward digital payments is already quite 
advanced in a number of nations where the people are 
often ahead of the institutions, both banks and regulators.
2. Market provisioning. The development of technologi￾cal data collection and analysis, some using artificial 
intelligence for rapid financial assessments, some 
using artificial intelligence, is expected to be a key 
area of impact. This sector is still considered in its in￾fancy, as the artificial intelligence and big data neces￾sary to support its use are still considered developing.
3. Investment management. The increased reach of 
fintech to previously ignored and underserved de￾mographic and income sectors (e.g., Robinhood) 
has already proven both powerful and disruptive. 
The promise of the developing world is enormous in 
changing spending/saving-investment behaviors.
4. Insurance. Access to insurance services, particularly 
affordable services, is one of the key development 
barriers in emerging economies. Insurance is often 
one of the requirements for acquiring and utilizing 
assets for business and economic development. But 
new digital insurance providers are rapidly changing 
who and what is insured at what costs.
5. Deposits and lending. This is one of the core tradi￾tional banking functions that is already undergoing 
disruptive change. Financial institutions have been 
rapidly adopting fintech apps for deposit taking but 
have been slow to advance the lending functions. 
Fintech lending has some of the greatest potential 
but also some of the greatest risks—for example, the 
experience China has had with peer-to-peer (P2P) 
lending—for the global financial system.
6. Capital raising. Internet-based capital-raising chan￾nels such as crowdfunding have rapidly developed 
their own financial ecosystems. More innovation than 
disruption, fintech capital raising represents some 
of the greatest potential improvements in society 
through economic development.
This is just one taxonomy of societal financial func￾tions. But regardless of how the financial service cake is 
sliced, it is clear that fintech’s potential to alter the lives 
of people in all countries and markets is real and, in many 
cases, already here. The recent global pandemic provided a 
multitude of examples of how fintech could provide more

M01B_EITE5960_16_GE_C01.indd 41 03/05/23 7:56 PM42 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
the bureaucratic, stodgy banking empires of the past. But that 
will only happen if they can break down the political power 
and breach the turf of the established institutions.
The one sector of possibly the greatest potential ben￾efit in global business is digital lending. A naive or simplis￾tic view of the world might be to visualize that the rich, 
highly industrialized countries, that play host to most of 
the world’s capital, could see massive opportunities in get￾ting the capital to the business entrepreneurs, startups, and 
under-capitalized enterprises in the emerging world. This 
access, once again, has been somewhat denied as estab￾lished banking industries in countries, not foreign inves￾tors or lenders, define the rules of access. Again, fintech 
innovations, like FairMoney in Nigeria or Goldman Sachs 
in Mexico, are finding their way through the forests of na￾tional regulatory barriers and data deficiencies to offer 
small enterprises access to capital.5
Cross-Border Potential
One example of the potential power of fintech for good is 
that of international money transfers. Migrant workers all 
over the world continue to suffer extremely high transfer 
costs, often ranging between 5% to 25%, to simply transfer 
the income they have generated in a host country back to 
their families and friends in their home countries.
International money transfers in many ways repre￾sent one of the biggest challenges of fintech: low-income 
populations, with no legal standing, political standing, 
or banking access, attempting to move small amounts of 
money across borders. Fintech firms have started building 
their own international correspondent relationships, some 
banking, allowing these transfers to bypass the legacy 
banking systems that exploited lower-income migrant 
populations. Unfortunately, that does not mean that the 
fintech providers do not similarly exploit low-income cus￾tomers. M-Pesa, a payment processing platform founded 
in Kenya and then expanded to a multitude of countries 
across Africa, is considered by many one of the true suc￾cess stories of fintech. But a multitude of studies have cited 
its monopoly status. With no real competitors, it has been 
able to charge high fees for its use. Once again technology 
does not assure healthy societal outcomes.
Promise and Peril
Probably no single case exemplifies the risks and rewards 
of fintech better than Alipay and China. China, all agree, 
is the leader in fintech development, in some ways be￾cause it is a nexus of both categories of markets described 
in the previous section—under-banked and over-banked. 
And China also offers a powerful device of expediting 
information and more financial services to people every￾where, partially in support of the world’s struggle to ease 
human suffering from COVID.
Digital financial services are faster, more efficient, and 
typically cheaper than traditional financial services and, 
therefore, increasingly reaching lower-income house￾holds and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). 
During the COVID-19 health crisis, digital financial ser￾vices can and are enabling contactless and cashless trans￾actions. Where digital financial inclusion is advanced, 
they are helping facilitate the efficient and quick deploy￾ment of government support measures, including to peo￾ple and firms affected by the pandemic. —“The Promise 
of Fintech, Financial Inclusion in the Post COVID-19 Era,” 
Ratna Sahay, Ulric Eriksson von Allmen, Amina Lahreche, 
Purva Khera, Sumiko Ogawa, Majid Bazarbash, and Kim 
Beaton, International Monetary Fund, No. 20/09, 2020.
Country Reach
One of the curious facets of fintech is that it may have 
the greatest impact on countries which are largely under￾banked and, simultaneously, those that are over-banked.
Like mobile phones in countries without existing 
landline infrastructures, fintech can leapfrog the legacy 
physical infrastructure of traditional banking. It can po￾tentially provide all of the basic financial services that the 
large marble-columned edifices have provided in older in￾dustrial markets for centuries at a fraction of the cost, both 
capital and operating. In these countries—for example, 
those in Sub-Saharan Africa—banking sectors are in some 
cases rudimentary, with a large part of the population not 
having access to traditional banking services. Here fintech 
can be fundamental, accessible at low cost, and powerful in 
reach. There is little to “disrupt”; here fintech can be seen 
in the role of a new financial infrastructure. And that can 
in turn act as a device for inclusion.
At the same time, fintech’s potential may also be quite 
impactful and disruptive in the older highly banked industri￾alized markets. These are markets—for example, the United 
States or Mexico—where banks have operated profitably for 
more than two centuries. They are established within a soci￾etal structure of laws, regulations, and institutions that shelter 
and protect their activities and markets. And that long-term 
protection has in many cases resulted in low rates of innova￾tion, most importantly in the under-investment in digital and 
cellular financial services that many customers now desire—
now that people have discovered what those services may 
offer and cost. The traditional highly banked developed mar￾kets may be ripe for fintech disruption, as new digital finan￾cial services may be much cheaper and more efficient than

M01B_EITE5960_16_GE_C01.indd 42 03/05/23 7:56 PMfintech—those most capable of embracing digital trans￾actions are also those with some of the greatest income/
wealth-generating capabilities. Oh, to be young.
Home to an old, bureaucratic, and politically power￾ful banking industry, it has seen the advancement of two 
of the world’s largest and most successful digital payments 
systems, WeChatPay (a unit of Tencent) and AliPay (a unit 
of Ant Group). These digital payments applications allow 
buying and selling of all things economic without the use 
of traditional cash, bank checks, or credit cards while op￾erating outside the traditional banking system. AliPay, the 
largest, is a third-party mobile and online payment plat￾form utilizing a Quick Response (QR) code on a personal 
phone to conduct electronically recorded transactions in 
an instant. As the world’s largest online payment platform 
it grew in market share and reach with the most advanced 
of consumers in Shanghai (over-banked) to the poorest of 
farmers in the inland provinces (under-banked).
In November 2020, AliPay’s parent company, the Ant 
Group, was 48 hours away from its initial public offer￾ing (IPO) when the Chinese government stepped in and 
stopped it. Expected to be the largest IPO in financial histo￾ry, the Ant Group and its founder Jack Ma had purportedly 
grown so large and so powerful that Chinese authorities 
worried about its impact on their financial system’s sta￾bility. One specific activity was Ant’s role in originating 
loans, playing a middleman role in connecting borrowers 
with lenders (banks) through its digital interface. The fear 
was that it was starting to operate similar to bank lending 
seen in the U.S. leading up to the financial crisis of 2008, 
where a lack of prudent due diligence in lending led to 
subprime borrowing—and repayment delinquencies—at 
record rates.6
 In the months that followed, the Chinese 
government rolled out a series of additional regulations 
to ensure that most lending remained in the hands of the 
banks themselves, for now.
Fintech Themes
Fintech offers new and impactful opportunities for money 
and capital to flow outside the brick-and-mortar institu￾tions of the past and present. Strangely, whether fintech 
will threaten the banks, partner with the banks, or both 
is dominating much of the discussion at present. Yet the 
banks or existing financial institutions are largely only 
distributors, the plumbing and plumber, moving the capi￾tal from those who have it to those who wish to use it. 
With greater capital freedom will come risks and failures 
that cause governments to take one step back with each 
two steps forward. Such is experience. The net result, 
that’s positive.
MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. Why do you think fintech’s relationship to banking 
systems is the focal point of such debate?
2. Why has China proven to be the leader in fintech?
3. In your opinion, is fintech revolutionary or evolutionary?

Although Ant’s lending activities was the common explanation for the regulatory crackdown, it is estimated that total Ant lending was 
less than 1% of total Chinese bank lending.

Problems
1.1 Mark Du Plessis in Johannesburg. Mark Du Plessis 
lives in Johannesburg, South Africa. He can buy one 
euro for R16.3700 (South African rand). At the same 
time, Richard Nolan, living in Paris, can buy a South 
African rand for €0.0631. What is the foreign exchange 
rate between the South African rand and the euro?
1.2 Mexico’s Cada Seis Años. Mexico was famous—or 
infamous—or many years for having two things every 
six years (cada seis años in Spanish): a presidential 
election and a currency devaluation. This was the case 
in 1976, 1982, 1988, and 1994. In its last devaluation on 
December 20, 1994, the value of the Mexican peso (Ps) 
was officially changed from Ps3.30 = $1.00 to Ps5.50
= $1.00. What was the percentage devaluation?
1.3 Krisianto’s Competing Job Offers. Krisianto, after an 
intensive post-graduation job search, has received job 
offers from three multinational companies. Each po￾sition is based in a different country—Mozambique, 
Uzbekistan, and Singapore—and offers a different 
starting salary and a different signing bonus in a dif￾ferent currency. Krisianto wants to compare all the 
compensation packages in a common currency, the 
euro. Use the data below to determine which offer 
represents the greatest initial euro compensation 
package.
1.4 Munich to Moscow. For your post-graduation cel￾ebratory trip you decide to travel from Munich, 
Germany, to Moscow, Russia. You leave Munich with 
15,000 euros (EUR) in your wallet. Wanting to ex￾change all of them for Russian rubles (RUB), you 
obtain the following quotes:
Spot rate on the U.S. dollar to euro cross rate: 
USD1.0644 = EUR1.00
Spot rate on the Russian ruble to dollar cross rate:

1.5 Rugby World Cup and JPY. Steven McGregor had 
planned his trip to the Rugby World Cup in Japan for al￾most a year. He had budgeted—saved—€17,000 for ex￾penses while in Japan. But he had postponed exchang￾ing the euros for Japanese yen (JPY or ¥)—until the 
very last minute on September 17th, doing it at Dublin 
Airport at JPY 119.23 = 1.00 EUR. Given the following 
average monthly exchange rates in 2019, when should 
he have exchanged the euros for yen to maximize his 
Japanese spending money?

1.6 Pokémon Go. Crystal Gomez, who lives in Mexico 
City, bought 100 Pokécoins for 17 Mexican pesos (Ps 
or MXN). Nintendo of Japan, one of the owners of 
Pokémon Go, will need to convert the Mexican pesos 
(Ps or MXN) into its home currency, the Japanese 
yen, in order to record the financial proceeds. The cur￾rent spot exchange rate between the Mexican peso 
and the U.S. dollar is MXN18.00 = USD1.00, and the 
current spot rate between the dollar and the Japanese 
yen (¥ or JPY) is JPY100.00 = USD1.00. What are the 
yen proceeds of Crystal Gomez’s purchase?

This is most meaningful when the comparison is for 
the identical or near-identical product or service 
across countries. Deutsche Bank has recently started 
publishing a comparison of cheap dates—an eve￾ning on the town for two to eat at McDonald’s, see 
a movie, and have a drink. Once all costs are con￾verted to a common currency, the U.S. dollar in this 
case, the cost of the date can be compared across cit￾ies relative to the base case of a cheap date in USD 
in New York City. After completing the table below, 
answer the following questions.
a. Which city in the table truly offers the cheapest 
date?
b. Which city in the table offers the most expen￾sive cheap date?
c. If the exchange rate in Moscow on the Russian 
ruble (RUB) was 0.04200, instead of 0.0283, 
what would be the USD price?
d. If the exchange rate in Shanghai was CNY 6.66

relative to a cheap date in New York City?
1.8 Moscow to Tokyo. After spending a week in 
Moscow you get an email from your friend in 
Japan. He can get you a very good deal on a plane 
ticket and wants you to meet him in Tokyo next 
week to continue your post-graduation celebratory 
trip. You have 450,000 Russian rubles (RUB) left in 
your money pouch. In preparation for the trip you 
want to exchange your Russian rubles for Japanese 
yen (JPY), so you get the following quotes:
Spot rate on the Russian ruble to U.S. dollar cross 
rate: RUB30.96 = USD1.00
Spot rate on the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar cross 
rate: JPY84.02 = USD1.00
a. What is the Russian ruble/yen cross rate?
b. How many Japanese yen will you obtain for

1.11 Peng Plasma Pricing. Peng Plasma is a privately 
held Chinese business. It specializes in the manufac￾ture of plasma cutting torches. Over the past eight 
years it has held the Chinese renminbi price of the 
PT350 cutting torch fixed at Rmb 18,000 per unit. 
Over that same period it has worked to reduce costs 
per unit but has struggled of late due to higher input 
costs. Over that same period the renminbi has con￾tinued to be revalued against the U.S. dollar by the 
Chinese government. After completing the table—
assuming the same price in renminbi for all years—
answer the following questions.
a. What has been the impact of Peng’s pricing 
strategy on the US$ price? How would you ex￾pect their U.S. dollar-based customers to have 
reacted to this?
b. What has been the impact on Peng’s margins 
from this pricing strategy?

1.12 Andreas Delon’s Compensation. Andreas Delon is 
a French citizen who has been offered the position 
of CEO of LakePharma, a large French pharma￾ceuticals firm. LakePharma produces high-quality 
chemicals used by pharmaceutical firms around the 
world. Much of the production of LakePharma is 
sold in Switzerland, which means that Andreas Delon 
will spend most of his time there helping to market 
LakePharma’s products to Swiss pharmaceutical firms. 
He wishes to be paid in euros, not Swiss francs (CHF).
LakePharma has agreed to pay Andreas’ base 
salary in euros, but insists on paying his sales com￾mission and bonus (amounting to 25% of his base 
salary) in Swiss francs. Andreas is unable to de￾cide whether to agree to this suggestion or to in￾sist on receiving all his remuneration in euros. He 
constructs the table on the next page showing the 
sales revenue to help him decide. As a close friend 
and colleague, what advice would you give him 
based on your completion of the following table?

2.1 Explore how the international monetary system has evolved from the days of the 
gold standard to today’s eclectic currency arrangement
2.2 Examine how the choice of fixed versus flexible exchange rate regimes is made by 
a country in the context of its desires for economic and social independence and 
openness
2.3 Describe the tradeoff a nation must make between a fixed exchange rate, monetary 
independence, and freedom of capital movements—the impossible trinity
2.4 Explain the dramatic choices the creation of a single currency for Europe—the 
euro—required of the European Union’s member states
2.5 Study the complexity of exchange rate regime choices faced by many emerging 
market countries today including China
2.6 Evaluate trends in global reserve currencies and how the introduction of digital 
currencies may impact the future of the international monetary system
This chapter begins with a brief history of the international monetary system, from the days 
of the classical gold standard to the present time. The first section describes contemporary 
currency regimes and their construction and classification. The second section examines 
fixed versus flexible exchange rate principles. The third section, what we would consider the 
theoretical core of the chapter, describes the attributes of the ideal currency and the choices 
nations must make in establishing their currency regime. The fourth section describes the 
creation and development of the euro for European Union participating countries. The fifth 
section details the difficult currency regime choices faced by many emerging market coun￾tries today. We then conclude with both data and thoughts on global reserve currencies and 
what the future might hold. The chapter concludes with the mini-case The Promise of the 
Digital Yuan, which examines the rapid development of China’s government-sponsored digi￾tal currency.
The price of every thing rises and falls from time to time and place to place; and with 
every such change the purchasing power of money changes so far as that thing goes.

2.1 History of the International Monetary System
No world central bank issues a separate currency for commerce across national boundar￾ies. Instead, a “system” of national monies works more or less well in providing a medium 
of exchange and unit of account for current international transactions, as well as a store of 
value and standard of deferred payment for longer-term borrowing and lending.
 —Ronald I. McKinnon, The Rules of the Game: International Money in Historical Perspective, 
Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. 31, No. 1, March 1993, pp. 1–44
The system of international money, as noted by McKinnon above, is essentially a loose agree￾ment between nations to exchange their currencies. Over the centuries, currencies have been 
defined in terms of gold, silver, and other items of value, all within a variety of different 
agreements between nations to recognize these varying definitions. A review of the evolution 
of these systems over the past two centuries, shown in Exhibit 2.1, provides one perspective 
against which to understand how we arrived at today’s rather eclectic system of fixed rates, 
floating rates, crawling pegs, and others and helps us to evaluate weaknesses in and chal￾lenges for all enterprises conducting global business.
The Classical Gold Standard (1879–1913)
Since the days of the pharaohs (about 3000 B.C.), gold has served as a medium of exchange 
and a store of value. The Greeks and Romans used gold coins, and this tradition persisted 
through to the nineteenth century. The great increase in trade during the late nineteenth cen￾tury led to a need for a more formalized system for settling international trade balances. One 
country after another set a par value for its currency in terms of gold or silver and then tried 
to adhere to the so-called rules of the game.

EXHIBIT 2.1 The Evolution of the Global Monetary System

Although the expression “rules of the game” is often attributed to John Maynard Keynes, he actually never listed 
what he thought those rules were. Keynes, in the “Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill” (1925), described the 
Bank of England reducing credit as a result of the “rules of the gold standard game.”
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 50 08/05/23 9:33 AMCHAPTER 2 International Monetary System 51
Some countries, like the U.S., first defined their currency in terms of both gold and silver 
(a bi-metallic standard), setting a ratio between the two (e.g., 1 unit of gold equaling 15 units 
of silver). If the market values of gold and silver diverged from this ratio, for example, if sil￾ver became relatively more valuable, then it (silver) would flow out of the nation leaving the 
other metal (gold) as the surviving metal backing the currency. The U.S. altered ratios and 
convertibility a number of times in the mid-1800s, even ending convertibility during the Civil 
War years of 1861–1865. In order to finance its war effort, the U.S. government suspended 
convertibility and printed paper money. The paper notes, printed in green on their back 
(“greenbacks”), had no intrinsic value and no exchange value in gold or silver and therefore 
were considered fiat money, money by decree. Following the Civil War the U.S. moved back 
to convertibility. As the rise of gold as the single metal (or specie) became prevalent across 
countries, the classical gold standard was born.
The gold standard as an international monetary system gained acceptance in Western 
Europe in the 1870s. France moved to gold alone in 1873, followed by Germany. Great Britain, 
far ahead of the other major powers of the time, had officially adopted a gold standard in 1844 
under the Bank Charter Act, which made Bank of England notes fully convertible to gold. The 
U.S. was a bit of a latecomer to the system, not officially adopting the gold standard until 1879.
Under the gold standard, the rules of the game were clear and simple: Each country set 
the rate at which its currency unit (paper or coin) could be converted to a given weight of 
gold. For example, prior to the first world war the United States declared the U.S. dollar to be 
convertible to gold at a rate of $20.67 per Troy ounce, while Great Britain pegged the British 
pound sterling at £4.2474 per Troy ounce of gold. As long as both currencies were freely 
convertible into gold within each nation, the rate of exchange between the two monies—the 
parity—was set:
$20.67 = 1ounceofgold
£4.2474 = 1ounceofgold = $4.8665>£1.0
Because the government of each country on the gold standard agreed to buy or sell gold 
on demand at its own fixed parity rate, convertibility, the value of each individual currency in 
terms of gold, and therefore exchange rates between currencies, was fixed. But the validity of 
each parity rate, whether the U.S. dollar, British pound, Russian rouble, or German mark, was 
based on the ability of an individual to exchange the currency for the metal—gold. Maintaining 
reserves of gold, gold ready to be exchanged for the currency on demand, was therefore criti￾cal in order for a government to maintain the faith of its citizens in its monetary system.
The system simultaneously implicitly limited the rate at which any individual govern￾ment could expand its money supply. Growth in the money supply was limited to the rate at 
which official authorities (government treasuries or central banks) could acquire additional 
gold. This restriction was deemed essential to prevent governments from printing money 
and stoking inflationary forces. The gold standard worked adequately until the outbreak of 
World War I interrupted trade flows and the free movement of gold. This event caused the 
main trading nations to suspend operation of the gold standard. And as described in Global 
Finance in Practice 2.1, the gold standard allowed some governments to raise capital on the 
international markets by assuring investors of fixed rates of exchange.
The Interwar Years and World War II (1914–1944)
During World War I and through the early 1920s, currencies were allowed to fluctuate over 
fairly wide ranges in terms of gold and in relation to each other. Theoretically, supply and 
demand for a country’s exports and imports caused moderate changes in an exchange rate 
about a central equilibrium value. This was the same function that gold had performed under 
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 51 08/05/23 9:33 AM52 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 2.1
From 1931 until 1935, the Gold Bloc tried to continue 
with the gold standard – despite the key international countries 
abandoning the same. They tried various measures to stabi￾lize their currency’s exchange rates that included various forms 
of internal trade protection and import restrictions. However, 
these measures were not sufficient to outweigh the impact of 
asynchronies in the exchange rates for their currencies.
During this time, both the United States and the United 
Kingdom decided to devalue the US Dollars and the British 
Pound sterling. Making their exports cheaper for other coun￾tries – boosting their respective economies. This made the 
industries in the Gold Bloc less profitable as their exports be￾come more and more expensive for foreign buyers. This led 
to significant transfer of capital from the Gold Bloc countries 
to the United States and the United Kingdom. To ease the 
pressure the Belgium and Luxembourg finally gave away the 
gold standard in 1935 and devalued their currencies. France 
took one more year to join the rest of the countries and finally 
abandoned the gold standard in 1936.
However, it is argued that in addition to economic 
factors, as we have outlined here and in section 2.1 of this 
chapter, there were very strong social and political devel￾opment during this time, related to the impending expecta￾tions of the World War II, that contributed to the fall of the 
last stand of the gold standard.
The “Gold Bloc”—The Last Stand of Gold Standard
The approach of governments across the world to deal with 
the relative fluctuations of exchange rates after World War 
II was mostly uniform. The Great Depression followed the 
World War II in the 1930s made the promotion of economic 
development a priority for governments across the world. At 
the same time, the gold standard made the value of curren￾cies fixed against each other, irrespective of their demand 
from external trade. This led to capital flight and short selling 
making it more difficult to uphold the dictated exchange rates.
The growing fiscal problems due to fluctuating currency 
exchange rates made it increasingly difficult for governments 
to “peg” the value of their currency with gold standard. This 
led to abandonment of gold standard by several countries in￾cluding the United Kingdom, Japan, Norway, and Sweden in 
1931. Within two more years, by 1933 the United States also 
abandoned gold standard.
However, there was a group of seven European coun￾tries led by France, which decided to stay with the gold 
standard as the basis of their monetary policy. This group is 
termed as the “Gold Bloc” and included Switzerland, Belgium, 
Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Poland, and Italy with France.
The United States abandoned the gold standard in 
1931, resulting into a sharp jump in gold prices (see figure 
below) increasing pressure on Gold Bloc.
the previous gold standard. Unfortunately, such flexible exchange rates did not work in an 
equilibrating manner. On the contrary, international speculators sold the weak currencies 
short, causing them to fall further in value than warranted by real economic factors. Selling 
short is a speculation technique in which an individual speculator sells an asset, such as a 
currency, to another party for delivery at a future date. The speculator, however, does not yet 
own the asset and expects the price of the asset to fall before the date by which the speculator 
must purchase the asset in the open market for delivery.
The reverse happened with strong currencies. Fluctuations in currency values could not 
be offset by the relatively illiquid forward exchange market, except at exorbitant cost. The net 
result was that the volume of world trade did not grow in the 1920s in proportion to world 
gross domestic product. Instead, it declined to a very low level with the advent of the Great 
Depression in the 1930s.

the last few days the withdrawals of foreign balances have 
accelerated so sharply that His Majesty’s Government have 
felt bound to take the decision mentioned above.
This decision will of course not affect obligations of His 
Majesty’s Government or the Bank of England which are pay￾able in foreign currencies.
The gold holding of the Bank of England amounts to 
some £130 millions and having regard to the contingencies 
which may have to be met it is inadvisable to allow the re￾serve to be further reduced.
His Majesty’s Government are well aware that the 
present step is bound to have serious consequences both 
at home and abroad. But during the last few days the 
International financial markets have become demoralised 
and seem bent on liquidating their foreign assets in a spit of 
panic. In the circumstances there was no alternative but to 
protect the economy of this country the only means at our 
disposal.

Britain Leaves the Gold Standard: Press Notice 
(Excerpts of September 19, 1931)
His Majesty’s Government have decided after consultation 
with the Bank of England that it has become necessary to 
suspend for the time being the operation of Subsection (2) of 
Section 1 of the Gold Standard Act of 1925 which requires 
the Bank to sell gold at a fixed price. A Bill for this purpose 
will be introduced immediately and it is the intention of His 
Majesty’s Government to ask Parliament to pass it through 
all its stages on Monday, 21st of September. In the meantime 
the Bank of England have been authorised to proceed ac￾cordingly in anticipation of the action of Parliament.
The reasons which have led to this decision are as fol￾lows. Since the middle of July funds amounting to more than 
£200 millions have been met partly from gold and foreign cur￾rency held by the Bank of England, partly from the proceeds 
of a credit of £50 millions which shortly matures secured by 
the Bank of England from New York and Paris and partly from 
the proceeds of the French and American credits amounting 
to £80 millions recently obtained by the Government. During 
Britain had returned to the gold standard in 1925, but as a result of onset of the de￾pression and the flight of gold out of Britain in 1931, it was forced to abandon the stan￾dard in September 1931. Global Finance in Practice 2.2 presents excerpts of His Majesty’s 
Government’s decision.
The United States adopted a modified gold standard in 1934 when the U.S. dollar was de￾valued to $35 per ounce of gold from the $20.67 per ounce price in effect prior to World War I. 
Contrary to previous practice, the U.S. Treasury now traded gold only with foreign central 
banks, not private citizens. From 1934 to the end of World War II, exchange rates were 
theoretically determined by each currency’s value in terms of gold. During World War II 
and its chaotic aftermath, however, many of the main trading currencies lost their convert￾ibility into other currencies. The dollar was one of the few currencies that continued to be 
convertible.
Bretton Woods and the International Monetary Fund (1944)
As World War II drew to a close in 1944, the Allied Powers met at Bretton Woods, New 
Hampshire, to create a new postwar international monetary system. The Bretton Woods 
Agreement established a U.S. dollar-based international monetary system and provided for 
two new institutions: the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) was created to aid countries with balance of payments and exchange 
rate problems. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD or as it 
is more commonly called, the World Bank) was formed to help fund postwar reconstruction 
and has since supported general economic development. Global Finance in Practice 2.3 pro￾vides some insight into the debates at Bretton Woods.
The IMF was the key institution in the new international monetary system, and it has 
remained so to the present day. The IMF was established to render temporary assistance to 
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 53 08/05/23 9:33 AM54 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
member countries trying to defend their currencies against cyclical, seasonal, or random oc￾currences. It also assists countries having structural trade problems if they promise to take 
adequate steps to correct their problems. If persistent deficits occur, however, the IMF cannot 
save a country from eventual devaluation. In recent years, the IMF has attempted to help 
countries facing financial crises, providing massive loans as well as advice to Russia, Brazil, 
Greece, Indonesia, and South Korea, to name but a few.
Under the original provisions of Bretton Woods, all countries fixed the value of their 
currencies in terms of gold, but they were not required to exchange their currencies for gold. 
Only the dollar remained convertible into gold (at $35 per ounce). Each country established 
its exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar and then calculated the gold par value of its currency 
to create the desired dollar exchange rate. Participating countries agreed to try to maintain 
the value of their currencies within 1% (later expanded to 2.25%) of par by buying or selling 
foreign exchange or gold as needed. Devaluation was not to be used as a competitive trade 
policy, but if a currency became too weak to defend, devaluation of up to 10% was allowed 
without formal approval by the IMF. Larger devaluations required IMF approval. This be￾came known as the gold-exchange standard.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 2.3
On the more pragmatic side, all parties agreed that a 
postwar system would be stable and sustainable only if there 
was sufficient credit available for countries to defend their 
currencies in the event of payment imbalances, which they 
knew to be inevitable in a reconstructing world order. The 
conference divided into three commissions for weeks of ne￾gotiation. One commission, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Morgenthau, was charged with the organization of a fund of 
capital to be used for exchange rate stabilization. A second 
commission, chaired by Lord Keynes, was charged with the 
organization of a second “bank” whose purpose would be 
for long-term reconstruction and development. A third com￾mission was to hammer out details such as what role silver 
would have in any new system.
After weeks of meetings, the participants came to a 
three-part agreement—the Bretton Woods Agreement. The 
plan called for: (1) fixed exchange rates, termed an adjustable 
peg, among members; (2) a fund of gold and constituent cur￾rencies available to members for stabilization of their respec￾tive currencies, called the International Monetary Fund (IMF); 
and (3) a bank for financing long-term development projects 
(eventually known as the World Bank). One proposal result￾ing from the meetings, which was not ratified by the U.S., 
was the establishment of an international trade organization 
to promote free trade.
* Fixed in parities is an old expression in this field, which means 
that the value of currencies should be fixed at rates that equal￾ize their value, typically measured by purchasing power.
Hammering out an Agreement at Bretton Woods
The governments of the Allied powers knew that the dev￾astating impacts of World War II would require swift and 
decisive policies. In the summer of 1944 (July 1–22), repre￾sentatives of all 45 allied nations met at Bretton Woods, New 
Hampshire, for the United Nations Monetary and Financial 
Conference. Their purpose was to plan the postwar interna￾tional monetary system. It was a difficult process, and the 
final synthesis was shaded by pragmatism.
The leading policymakers at Bretton Woods were the 
British and the Americans. The British delegation was led by 
Lord John Maynard Keynes, known as “Britain’s economic 
heavy weight.” The British argued for a postwar system 
that would be more flexible than the various gold standards 
used before the war. Keynes argued, as he had after World 
War I, that attempts to tie currency values to gold would 
create pressures for deflation in many of the war-ravaged 
economies.
The American delegation was led by the director of 
the U.S. Treasury’s monetary research department, Harry 
D. White, and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Henry 
Morgenthau, Jr. The Americans argued for stability (fixed 
exchange rates) but not a return to the gold standard it￾self. In fact, although the U.S. at that time held most of the 
gold of the Allied powers, the U.S. delegates argued that 
currencies should be fixed in parities* but that redemption 
of gold should occur only between official authorities like 
central banks.
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 54 08/05/23 9:33 AMCHAPTER 2 International Monetary System 55
An additional innovation introduced by Bretton Woods was the creation of the Special 
Drawing Right (SDR). The SDR is an international reserve asset created by the IMF to sup￾plement existing foreign exchange reserves. It serves as a unit of account for the IMF and 
other international and regional organizations. It is also the base against which some coun￾tries peg the exchange rate for their currencies. Initially defined in terms of a fixed quantity 
of gold, the SDR was for many years the weighted average of four major currencies: the U.S. 
dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound. On October 1, 2016, the Chinese 
yuan (or renminbi) was added as the fifth currency component.
The weight assigned to each SDR currency is updated every five years by the IMF. The 
2015 weights, taking effect on October 1, 2016, are as follows:
Currency 2015 Weight 2010 Weight
U.S. dollar 41.73% 41.9%
Euro 30.93% 37.4%
Chinese renminbi 10.92% ——
Japanese yen 8.33% 9.4%
Pound sterling 8.09% 11.3%
Total 100.00% 100.0%
Individual countries hold SDRs in the form of deposits in the IMF. These holdings are 
part of each country’s international monetary reserves, along with its official holdings of gold, 
its foreign exchange, and its reserve position at the IMF. Member countries may settle trans￾actions among themselves with SDRs.
The SDR’s use outside of reserve assets is extremely limited. Harvard economist Jeffrey 
Frankel has described the SDR as “basically the Esperanto, at best, of international cur￾rencies. It’s not at all used.” He is not quite correct, however, as the Suez Canal and the 
Universal Postal Union both use the SDR in the calculation of transit charges and postal 
fees, respectively. As a weighted index of five different currencies, it is mathematically less 
volatile than any single currency value and, therefore, has found specific uses in areas such 
as maritime contracts, securities in the eurobond market, and select international treaties. 
Most recently, in March 2021, the G7, the world’s seven largest industrial economies, agreed 
to support the expansion of the IMF’s reserves to help developing countries cope with the 
global pandemic.
Fixed Exchange Rates (1945–1973)
The currency arrangement negotiated at Bretton Woods and monitored by the IMF worked 
fairly well during the postwar period of reconstruction and rapid growth in world trade. However, 
widely diverging national monetary and fiscal policies, differential rates of inflation, and various 
unexpected external shocks eventually resulted in the system’s demise. The U.S. dollar was the 
main reserve currency held by central banks and was the key to the web of exchange rate values. 
Unfortunately, the U.S. ran persistent and growing deficits in its balance of payments.
A heavy capital outflow of dollars was required to finance these deficits and to meet the 
growing demand for dollars from investors and businesses. Eventually, the heavy overhang 
of dollars held by foreigners resulted in a lack of confidence in the ability of the U.S. to meet 
its commitments in gold. This lack of confidence came to a head in the first half of 1971. In a 
little less than seven months, the U.S. suffered the loss of nearly one-third of its official gold 
reserves as global confidence in the value of the dollar plummeted. Exchange rates between 
most major currencies and the U.S. dollar began to float, and thus indirectly, so did their 
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 55 08/05/23 9:33 AM56 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
values relative to gold. A year and a half later, the U.S. dollar once again came under attack, 
thereby forcing a second devaluation in February 1973, this time by 10% to $42.22 per ounce 
of gold. By late February 1973, a fixed-rate system no longer appeared feasible given the 
speculative flows of currencies. The major foreign exchange markets were actually closed for 
several weeks in March 1973. When markets reopened, most currencies were allowed to float 
to levels determined by market forces.
Floating Exchange Rates, 1973–1997
Since 1973 exchange rates have become more volatile and less predictable than they were 
during the “fixed” exchange rate era, when changes occurred infrequently. Exhibit 2.2 illus￾trates the wide swings exhibited by the nominal exchange rate index of the U.S. dollar since 
1964. Clearly, volatility has increased since 1973.
Exhibit 2.2 notes some of the most important shocks in recent history: the creation of 
the European Monetary System (EMS) in 1979, the run-up and peak of the dollar in 1985, the 
EMS crisis of 1992, the Asian crisis of 1997, the launch of the European euro in 1999, and 
the Brexit vote in 2016.
The Emerging Era, 1997–Present
The period following the Asian Crisis of 1997 has seen growth in both the breadth and depth 
of emerging market economies and currencies. We may end up being proven wrong on this 
count, but the final section of this chapter argues that the global monetary system has already 
begun embracing—for more than two decades now—a number of major emerging market 
currencies, beginning with the Chinese renminbi. Feel free to disagree.

IMF Classification of Currency Regimes
The global monetary system—if there is indeed a singular “system”—is an eclectic combina￾tion of exchange rate regimes and arrangements. There is no single governing body or single 
official global policing authority for global exchange of currencies. The IMF, however, has at 
least played the role of “town crier” since World War II. As part of its self-appointed duties, it 
has created a classification system of currency regimes.
Brief Classification History
The IMF was for many years the central clearinghouse for exchange rate classifications. 
Member states submitted their exchange rate policies to the IMF, and those submissions were 
the basis for its categorization of exchange rate regimes. However, that all changed in 1997–
1998 with the Asian Financial Crisis. During the crisis many countries began following very 
different exchange rate practices than those they had committed to with the IMF. Their actual 
practices—their de facto systems—were not what they had publicly and officially committed 
to—their de jure systems.
Beginning in 1998, the IMF changed its practice and stopped collecting regime classi￾fication submissions from member states. Instead, it confined its regime classifications and 
reports to analysis performed in-house. (This included the cessation of publishing its Annual 
Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, a document on which many 
of the world’s financial institutions had relied for decades.) As a global institution, which is in 
principle apolitical, the IMF’s analysis today is focused on classifying currencies on the basis 
of an ex post analysis of how the currency’s value was based in the recent past. This analysis 
focuses on observed behavior, not on official government policy pronouncements.
The IMF’s De Facto System
The IMF’s methodology of classifying exchange rate regimes today, in effect since January 
2009, is presented in Exhibit 2.3. It is based on actual observed behavior, de facto results, 
and not on the official policy statements of the respective governments, de jure classification. 
The classification process begins with the determination of whether the exchange rate of the 
country’s currency is dominated by markets or by official action. Although the classification 
system is a bit challenging, there are four basic categories.
Category 1: Hard Pegs. These countries have given up their own sovereignty over mon￾etary policy. This category includes countries that have adopted other countries’ curren￾cies (e.g., Zimbabwe’s dollarization—its adoption of the U.S. dollar) and countries utilizing 
a currency board structure that limits monetary expansion to the accumulation of foreign 
exchange.
Category 2: Soft Pegs. This general category is colloquially referred to as fixed exchange 
rates. The five subcategories of soft peg regimes are differentiated on the basis of what the 
currency is fixed to, whether that fix is allowed to change (and if so under what conditions); 
what types, magnitudes, and frequencies of intervention are allowed/used; and the degree of 
variance about the fixed rate.
Category 3: Floating Arrangements. Currencies that are predominantly market-driven 
are further subdivided into free floating with values determined by open market forces with￾out governmental influence or intervention and simple floating or floating with intervention, 
where government occasionally does intervene in the market in pursuit of some rate goals or 
objectives.
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 57 08/05/23 9:33 AM58 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
EXHIBIT 2.3 IMF Exchange Rate Classifications
Rate Classification De Facto System Description and Requirements
Hard Pegs Arrangement with 
no separate legal 
tender
The currency of another country circulates as the sole legal tender (formal 
dollarization), as well as members of a monetary or currency union in which the same 
legal tender is shared by the members.
Currency board 
arrangement
A monetary arrangement based on an explicit legislative commitment to exchange 
domestic currency for a specific foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate, combined 
with restrictions on the issuing authority. Restrictions imply that domestic currency will 
be issued only against foreign exchange and that it remains fully backed by foreign 
assets.
Soft Pegs Conventional 
pegged 
arrangement
A country formally pegs its currency at a fixed rate to another currency or a basket of 
currencies of major financial or trading partners. Country authorities stand ready to 
maintain the fixed parity through direct or indirect intervention. The exchange rate may 
vary {1% around a central rate or may vary no more than 2% for a six-month period.
Stabilized 
arrangement
A spot market rate that remains within a margin of 2% for six months or more and 
is not floating. Margin stability can be met by either a single currency or basket of 
currencies (assuming statistical measurement). Exchange rate remains stable as a 
result of official action.
Intermediate pegs:
Crawling peg Currency is adjusted in small amounts at a fixed rate or in response to changes in 
quantitative indicators (e.g., inflation differentials).
Crawl-like 
arrangement
Exchange rate must remain with a narrow margin of 2% relative to a statistically 
defined trend for six months or more. Exchange rate cannot be considered floating. 
Minimum rate of change is greater than allowed under a stabilized arrangement.
Pegged exchange 
rate within 
horizontal bands
Value of the currency is maintained within 1% of a fixed central rate or the margin 
between the maximum and minimum value of the exchange rate exceeds 2%. This 
includes countries which are today members of the ERM II system.
Floating 
Arrangements
Floating Exchange rate is largely market determined without an ascertainable or predictable 
path. Market intervention may be direct or indirect and serves to moderate the rate of 
change (but not targeting). Rate may exhibit more or less volatility.
Free floating A floating rate is freely floating if intervention occurs only exceptionally and 
confirmation of intervention is limited to at most three instances in a six-month period, 
each lasting no more than three business days.
Residual Other managed 
arrangements
This category is residual and is used when the exchange rate does not meet the 
criteria for any other category. Arrangements characterized by frequent shifts in 
policies fall into this category.
Source: “Revised System for the Classification of Exchange Rate Arrangements,” by Karl Habermeier, Annamaria Kokenyne, Romain Veyrune, and 
Harald Anderson, IMF Working Paper WP/09/211, International Monetary Fund, November 17, 2009.
Category 4: Residual. As one would suspect, this category includes all exchange rate ar￾rangements that do not meet the criteria of the previous three categories. Country systems 
demonstrating frequent shifts in policy typically make up the bulk of this category.
Exhibit 2.4 provides a glimpse into how these major regime categories translate in the 
global market—fixed or floating. The vertical dashed line, the crawling peg, is the zone some 
currencies move into and out of depending on their relative currency stability. Although 
the classification regimes appear clear and distinct, the distinctions are often more difficult 
to distinguish in practice in the market. For example, in January 2014, the Bank of Russia 
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 58 08/05/23 9:33 AMCHAPTER 2 International Monetary System 59
announced it would no longer conduct intervention activities with regard to the value of the 
ruble and that it planned to allow the ruble to trade freely with no intervention.
A Global Eclectic
Despite the IMF’s attempt to apply rigor to regime classifications, the global monetary sys￾tem today is indeed a global eclectic in every sense of the term. As Chapter 5 will describe in 
detail, the current global market in currency is dominated by two major currencies, the U.S. 
dollar and the European euro, and after that, a multitude of systems, arrangements, currency 
areas, and zones.
The IMF estimates that 20.3% of its member countries use the U.S. dollar as their anchor 
currency, with another 13% using the euro and 4.7% using a composite or other currency as an￾chor.2
 In addition to anchor currency systems, 12.5% of IMF members use some monetary 
aggregate (money supply measure) as their gauge to currency management, while another 
20% pursue inflation rate targeting. A full 25% of IMF members use some other form of 
monetary policy framework or unstated exchange rate anchor.
The euro itself is an example of a rigidly fixed system, acting as a single currency for its 
member countries. However, the euro is also an independently floating currency against all 
other currencies. Other examples of rigidly fixed exchange regimes include Ecuador, Panama, 
and Zimbabwe, all of which use the U.S. dollar as their official currency; the Central African 
Franc (CFA) zone, in which countries such as Mali, Niger, Senegal, Cameroon, and Chad among 
others use a single common currency (the franc, which is tied to the euro); and the Eastern 
Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), a set of countries that use the Eastern Caribbean dollar.

At the other extreme are countries with independently floating currencies. These include 
many of the most developed countries, such as Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, 
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland. However, this category also in￾cludes a number of unwilling participants—emerging market countries that tried to maintain 
fixed rates but were forced by the marketplace to let their currencies float. Among these are 
Korea, the Philippines, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Thailand.
As illustrated by Exhibit 2.5, the regime choices of IMF member countries have not 
changed dramatically over the past decade. Countries with floating regimes average 34% or 
35% of member countries, while countries using soft peg regimes have increased from just 
under 40% to 46% in recent years. Although the contemporary international monetary sys￾tem is typically referred to as a floating exchange rate system, that is clearly not the case for 
the majority of the world’s nations.
2.2 Fixed versus Flexible Exchange Rates
A nation’s choice as to which currency regime to follow reflects national priorities about all 
facets of the economy, including inflation, unemployment, interest rate levels, trade balances, 
and economic growth. The choice between fixed and flexible rates may change over time as 
priorities change. At the risk of overgeneralizing, the following points partly explain why 
countries pursue certain exchange rate regimes. Fixed exchange rates have a number of dis￾advantages—as we will show in the following section—and maintaining them can be difficult 
and costly. But they also offer some advantages as follows:
■ Fixed rates provide stability in international prices for the conduct of trade. Stable prices 
aid in the growth of international trade and lessen risks for all businesses.

■ Fixed exchange rates are inherently anti-inflationary, requiring the country to follow re￾strictive monetary and fiscal policies. This restrictiveness, however, can be a burden to a 
country wishing to pursue policies to alleviate internal economic problems such as high 
unemployment or slow economic growth.
■ Fixed exchange rate regimes necessitate that central banks maintain large quantities of 
international reserves (hard currencies and gold) for use in the occasional defense of the 
fixed rate. As international currency markets have grown in size, increasing reserve hold￾ings has become a growing burden.
■ Fixed rates, once in place, may be maintained at levels that are inconsistent with eco￾nomic fundamentals. As the structure of a nation’s economy changes and as its trade rela￾tionships and balances evolve, the exchange rate itself should change. Flexible exchange 
rates allow this to happen gradually and efficiently, but fixed rates must be changed ad￾ministratively—usually too late, with too much publicity, and at too large a one-time cost 
to the nation’s economic health.
The terminology associated with changes in currency values is also technically specific. 
When a government officially declares its own currency to be worth less or more relative to 
other currencies, it is termed a devaluation or revaluation, respectively. This obviously applies 
to currencies whose value is controlled by government. When a currency’s value is changed 
in the open currency market—not directly by government—it is called a depreciation (with a 
fall in value) or appreciation (with an increase in value).
2.3 The Impossible Trinity
If the ideal currency existed in today’s world, it would possess the following three attributes, 
illustrated in Exhibit 2.6, often referred to as the impossible trinity or the trilemma of interna￾tional finance:
Exchange Rate Stability:
A Managed or Pegged Exchange Rate
China & major industrial countries

(give up free flow of capital )
Nations must choose in which direction to move from the center—toward points A, B, or C. Their choice is a choice of what
to pursue and what to give up—that of the opposite point of the pyramid. Marginal compromise is possible, but only marginal.

United States Independent monetary 
policy
Free movement of capital Currency value floats
China Independent monetary 
policy
Fixed rate of exchange Restricted movement of 
capital
Europe (EU) Free movement of capital Fixed rate of exchange Integrated monetary policy
For example, a country like the U.S. has knowingly given up on having a fixed exchange 
rate—moving from the center of the pyramid toward point C—because it wishes to have an 
independent monetary policy, and it allows a high level of freedom in the movement of capi￾tal into and out of the country.
The choices made by the EU are clearly more complex. As a combination of different 
sovereign states, the EU has pursued integration of a common currency, the euro, and free 
movement of labor and capital. The result, according to the impossible trinity, is that EU 
member states had to give up independent monetary policy, replacing individual central 
banks with the European Central Bank (ECB). The recent fiscal deficits and near-collapses 
of government debt issuances in Greece, Portugal, and Ireland have raised questions over the 
efficacy of the arrangement.
China today is a clear example of a nation that has chosen to continue to control and 
manage the value of its currency and to conduct an independent monetary policy, mov￾ing from the center of the pyramid toward point A while continuing to restrict the flow 
of capital into and out of the country. To say it has “given up” the free flow of capital is 
probably inaccurate, as China has allowed no real freedom of capital flows in the past 
century.
The consensus of many experts is that the force of increased capital mobility has 
been pushing more and more countries toward full financial integration in an attempt to 
stimulate their domestic economies and to feed the capital appetites of their own MNEs. 
As a result, their currency regimes are being “cornered” into being either purely floating 
(like the U.S.) or integrated with other countries in monetary unions (like the European 
Union).
1. Exchange rate stability. The value of the currency is fixed in relationship to other major 
currencies, so traders and investors could be relatively certain of the foreign exchange 
value of each currency in the present and into the near future.
2. Full financial integration. Complete freedom of monetary flows would be allowed, so 
traders and investors could easily move funds from one country and currency to another 
in response to perceived economic opportunities or risks.
3. Monetary independence. Domestic monetary and interest rate policies would be set by 
each individual country to pursue desired national economic policies, especially as they 
might relate to limiting inflation, combating recessions, and fostering prosperity and full 
employment.
Together, these qualities are termed the impossible trinity because the forces of econom￾ics do not allow a country to simultaneously achieve all three goals: monetary independence, 
exchange rate stability, and full financial integration. The impossible trinity makes it clear 
that each economy must choose its own medicine. Here is what many argue are the choices of 
three of the major global economic players:
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 62 08/05/23 9:33 AMCHAPTER 2 International Monetary System 63
2.4 A Single Currency for Europe: The Euro
Beginning with the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and continuing with the Single European Act 
of 1987, the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, and the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997, a core set of 
European countries worked steadily toward integrating their individual country markets 
into one larger, more efficient domestic market. However, even after the launch of the 1992 
Single Europe program, a number of barriers to true openness remained, including the use 
of different currencies, which required both consumers and companies to treat the individ￾ual country markets separately. Currency risk of cross-border commerce still persisted. The 
creation of a single currency was seen as the way to move beyond these last vestiges of sepa￾rated markets.
The original 15 members of the EU were also members of the European Monetary 
System (EMS). The EMS formed a system of fixed exchange rates among the member cur￾rencies, with deviations managed through bilateral responsibility to maintain rates at {2.5%
of an established central rate. This system of fixed rates, with adjustments along the way, 
remained in effect from 1979 to 1999. Its resiliency was seriously tested with exchange rate 
crises in 1992 and 1993, but it held.
The Maastricht Treaty and Monetary Union
In December 1991, the members of the EU met at Maastricht, the Netherlands, and 
concluded a treaty that changed Europe’s currency future. The Maastricht Treaty specified 
a timetable and a plan to replace all individual EMS member currencies with a single cur￾rency—eventually named the euro. Other aspects of the treaty were also adopted that would 
lead to a full European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). According to the EU, the 
EMU is a single-currency area within the singular EU market, now known informally as the 
eurozone, in which people, goods, services, and capital are allowed to move freely.
The integration of separate country monetary systems is not, however, a minor task. To 
prepare for the EMU, the Maastricht Treaty called for the integration and coordination of the 
member countries’ monetary and fiscal policies. The EMU would be implemented by a pro￾cess called convergence. Before becoming a full member of the EMU, each member country 
was expected to meet a set of convergence criteria in order to integrate systems that were 
at the same relative performance levels: (1) nominal inflation should be no more than 1.5% 
above the average for the three members of the EU that had the lowest inflation rates during 
the previous year, (2) long-term interest rates should be no more than 2% above the average 
of the three members with the lowest interest rates, (3) individual government budget deficits 
(fiscal deficits) should be no more than 3% of gross domestic product, and (4) government 
debt outstanding should be no more than 60% of gross domestic product. The convergence 
criteria were so tough that few, if any, of the members could satisfy them at that time, but 11 
countries managed to do so just prior to 1999. (Greece was added two years later.)
The European Central Bank (ECB)
The cornerstone of any monetary system is a strong, disciplined central bank. The Maastricht 
Treaty established this single institution for the EMU, the European Central Bank (ECB), 
which was established in 1998. (The EU created the European Monetary Institute [EMI] in 
1994 as a transitional step in establishing the European Central Bank.) The ECB’s structure 
and functions were modeled after the German Bundesbank, which in turn had been modeled 
after the U.S. Federal Reserve System. The ECB is an independent central bank that domi￾nates the activities of the individual countries’ central banks. The individual central banks 
continue to regulate banks resident within their borders, but all financial market intervention 
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 63 08/05/23 9:33 AM64 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
and the issuance of the single currency are the sole responsibility of the ECB. The single most 
important mandate of the ECB is its charge to promote price stability within the European 
Union.
The Launch of the Euro
On January 4, 1999, 11 member states of the EU initiated the EMU. They established a sin￾gle currency, the euro, which replaced the individual currencies of the participating mem￾ber states. The 11 countries were Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Greece did not qualify for EMU partici￾pation at the time but joined the euro group later, in 2001. On December 31, 1998, the final 
fixed rates between the 11 participating currencies and the euro were put into place. On 
January 4, 1999, the euro was officially launched.
The United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark chose to maintain their individual curren￾cies. The United Kingdom, skeptical of increasing EU infringement on its sovereignty, opted 
not to participate. Sweden, which has failed to see significant benefits from EU membership 
(although it is one of the newest members), has also been skeptical of EMU participation. 
Denmark, like the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Norway, has so far opted not to participate. 
(Denmark is, however, a member of ERM II, the Exchange Rate Mechanism II, which effec￾tively allows Denmark to keep its own currency and monetary sovereignty but fixes the value 
of its currency, the krone, to the euro.)
The euro would generate a number of benefits for the participating states: (1) Countries 
within the eurozone enjoy cheaper transaction costs, (2) currency risks and costs related to 
exchange rate uncertainty are reduced, and (3) all consumers and businesses both inside and 
outside the eurozone enjoy price transparency and increased price-based competition. The 
primary cost of adopting the euro, the loss of monetary independence, would be a continuing 
challenge for the members for years to come.
On January 4, 1999, the euro began trading on world currency markets. Its introduction 
was a smooth one. The euro’s value slid steadily following its introduction, however, primarily 
as a result of the robustness of the U.S. economy and U.S. dollar and sluggish economic sec￾tors in the EMU countries. Beginning in 2002, the euro began appreciating versus the dollar, 
peaking in the summer of 2008. Since that time, as illustrated in Exhibit 2.7, it has trended, 
roughly downward against the dollar. It has, however, demonstrated significant volatility.
The use of the euro has continued to expand to more and more members of the European 
Union since its introduction. As of January 2018, the euro was the official currency for 19 of 
the 28 member countries in the European Union, as well as five other countries (Montenegro, 
Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) that may eventually join the EU. The EU 
countries currently using the euro—the so-called eurozone—are detailed in Exhibit 2.8. Note 
that although the United Kingdom voted to exit the EU in June 2016 (Brexit), the UK had 
never adopted the euro. Both the UK and Denmark chose to remain outside the eurozone 
from the euro’s inception. (Denmark does, however, continue to manage its currency against 
the euro as a participant in the ERM II mechanism offered by the EU.)
Exhibit 2.8 also highlights why the initial launch of the euro went so smoothly. With the 
exceptions of the UK and Denmark, all other initial euro adopters had pegged their curren￾cies to the ECU for the previous 20 years. The exhibit also illustrates that as the EU itself has 
expanded, primarily to countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltic, individual members have 
followed an orderly transition to adopting the euro. Although all members of the EU are 
expected eventually to replace their currencies with the euro, recent years have seen some 
debate as to how far euro expansion can feasibly extend. Note that the United Kingdom has 
always been outside the euro. The Brexit vote in June 2016 did not alter that relationship.

2.5 Internationalization of the Chinese RMB
Crossing the stream by feeling the stones.
 —attributed to former Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping
Much has been said and written in the past decade over the internationalization of the 
Chinese renminbi, but even now it is difficult to say when or if this will happen at the level 
often expected.3
 The quote above attributed to Deng Xiaoping has been frequently used 
to describe China’s careful and gradual approach to market economics. Is this gradual ap￾proach what global currency markets are seeing, or has the global marketplace relegated 
the renminbi to the backwaters of currency trading? Will the renminbi ever near the global 
acceptance and use as that seen by the U.S. dollar? What has happened to renminbi-isation?
Renminbi Valuation
Although trading in the RMB is closely controlled by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) 
and the People’s Bank of China (PBC)—with all trading inside China between the RMB 
and foreign currencies (primarily the U.S. dollar) being conducted only according to Chinese 
regulations—its reach is spreading. The RMB’s value, as illustrated in Exhibit 2.9, has been 
carefully controlled but allowed to gradually revalue against the dollar over time—a lot of 
time. Despite the relative stability of China’s currency over time, this is but one feature of 
how internationalized the currency may be.

The People’s Republic of China officially recognizes the terms renminbi (RMB) and yuan (CNY) as names of its offi￾cial currency. Yuan is used in reference to the unit of account (numerical values), while the physical currency is termed 
the renminbi (conceptual descriptions). This has resulted in common use of both RMB and CNY for currency codes. 
Officially, the ISO-4217 currency code used in all international digital trading of the Chinese currency is CNY.
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 66 08/05/23 9:33 AMCHAPTER 2 International Monetary System 67
Despite the changing valuation and regime choices associated with the RMB, it is still not 
a freely convertible currency. Nearly all foreign exchange transactions must still be conducted 
through a highly regulated and restrictive series of permits and processes. This restrictiveness, 
seen by some as part of China’s legacy of financial repression, is at the forefront of the gov￾ernment’s desire to maintain a balance between domestic financial control and stability while 
allowing a gradual introduction of market forces. What the Chinese government has made 
very clear, repeatedly, is that it will not allow either volatility or rapid and rising interest rates 
to affect domestic economic and business conditions.
Two-Market Currency Development
The RMB’s development is driven by the Chinese economy. China makes up roughly 15% of 
the global economy. As such a large player in global trade and investment transactions—all 
requiring currency—there is a continuing and growing need for a more liquid and accessible 
currency. The PRC has clearly moved toward making the RMB an international currency 
since joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. The method and timing of this 
internationalization process have, however, continued to frustrate many.
The RMB continues to develop along a segmented onshore/offshore two-market structure 
regulated by the PRC, as seen in Exhibit 2.10. The onshore market (carrying the official ISO 
code for the Chinese RMB, CNY) is a two-tier market, with retail exchange and an interbank 
wholesale exchange. The currency has, since mid-2005, been officially a managed float regime. 
Internally, the currency is traded through the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS), 
in which the People’s Bank of China sets a daily central parity rate against the dollar (fixing). 
Actual trading is allowed to range within ±1% of the parity rate on a daily basis. This internal 
market continues to be gradually deregulated, with banks now being allowed to exchange ne￾gotiable certificates of deposit among themselves, with fewer and fewer interest rate restric￾tions. Nine different currencies are traded daily in the market against the RMB and themselves.

The offshore market for the RMB has grown out of a Hong Kong base (accounts labeled 
CNH, an unofficial symbol). This offshore market has enjoyed preferred access to the onshore 
market by government regulators, both in acquiring funds and reinjecting funds (termed 
backflow). Growth in this market has been fueled by the issuance of RMB-denominated 
debt, so-called Panda Bonds, by McDonald’s Corporation, Caterpillar, and the World Bank, 
among others. Hong Kong-based institutional investors are now allowed access to onshore 
financial deposits (interest bearing), permitting a stronger use of these offshore deposits.
The PRC also continues to promote the expansion of the offshore market to other major 
regional and global financial centers like Singapore and London. One of the largest develop￾ments has been the establishment of currency trading hubs across the globe. These hubs, from 
London to Hong Kong to New York, are banks that the Chinese government has granted 
special status as clearing centers for renminbi currency trading.
Internationalization: Theoretical Principles and Practical Concerns
As the world’s largest commercial trader and second-largest economy, it has been considered 
inevitable that China’s currency would become an international currency. But the degree of 
internationalization varies.
A first degree of internationalization occurs when an international currency becomes 
readily accessible for trade. (This is technically described as current account use, to be de￾scribed in detail in the next chapter.) As noted in Exhibit 2.10, the RMB, in the words of one 
publication, “punches far below its weight.” A 2019 IMF study (using 2016 data) found that 
93% of Chinese imports and 95% of exports were denominated in U.S. dollars. A Chinese ex￾porter paid in U.S. dollars was not allowed to keep those dollar proceeds in any bank account. 
Exporters were required to exchange all foreign currencies for RMB at the official exchange 
rate set by the PRC and to turn them over to the Chinese government (resulting in a gross 
accumulation of foreign currency reserves). Times are changing. Importers and exporters are 
increasingly encouraged to use the RMB for trade denomination and settlement purposes.
A second degree of internationalization occurs with the use of the currency for interna￾tional investment—capital account/market activity. This is an area of substantial concern and 
caution for the PRC at this time. The Chinese marketplace is the focus of many of the world’s 
businesses, and if they were allowed free and open access to the market and its currency, there 
is fear that the value of the RMB could be driven up, decreasing Chinese export competitive￾ness. Simultaneously, as major capital markets like the dollar and euro head into stages of 
rising interest rates, there is a concern that large quantities of Chinese savings could flow out 
of the country in search of higher returns—capital flight.
A third degree of internationalization occurs when a currency takes on a role as a reserve 
currency (also termed an anchor currency), a currency to be held in the foreign exchange re￾serves of the world’s central banks. The continued dilemma of fiscal deficits in the United 
States and the European Union has led to growing unease over the ability of the dollar and 
euro to maintain their value over time. Could, or should, the RMB serve as a reserve currency? 
Forecasts of the RMB’s share of global reserves vary between 15% and 50% by the year 2024.
The Triffin Dilemma
One theoretical concern about becoming a reserve currency is the Triffin Dilemma (some￾times called the Triffin Paradox). The Triffin Dilemma is the potential conflict in objectives 
that may arise between domestic monetary and currency policy objectives and external 
or international policy objectives when a country’s currency is used as a reserve currency. 
Domestic monetary and economic policies may on occasion require both contraction and the 
creation of a balance on trade surplus.
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 68 08/05/23 9:33 AMCHAPTER 2 International Monetary System 69
If a currency rises to the status of a global reserve currency, in which it is considered 
one of the two or three key stores of value on earth (possibly finding its way into the IMF’s 
Special Drawing Right [SDR] definition), other countries will require the country to run cur￾rent account deficits, essentially dumping growing quantities of the currency on global mar￾kets. This means that the country needs to become internationally indebted as part of its 
role as a reserve currency country. In short, when the world adopts a currency as a reserve 
currency, demands are placed on the use and availability of that currency, which many coun￾tries would prefer not to deal with. In fact, both Japan and Switzerland worked for decades 
to prevent their currencies from gaining wider international use, partially because of these 
complex issues. The Chinese RMB, however, may eventually find that it has no choice—the 
global market may choose.
2.6 Emerging Markets and Regime Choices
The 1997–2005 period specifically saw increasing pressures on emerging market countries to 
choose among more extreme types of exchange rate regimes. The increased capital mobility 
pressures noted in the previous section have driven a number of countries to choose between 
a free-floating exchange rate (as in Turkey in 2002) or, at the opposite extreme, a fixed-rate 
regime—such as a currency board (as in Argentina throughout the 1990s) or even dollariza￾tion (as in Ecuador in 2000). These systems deserve a bit more discussion.
Currency Boards
A currency board exists when a country’s central bank commits to back its monetary base—
its money supply—entirely with foreign reserves at all times. This commitment means that a 
unit of domestic currency cannot be introduced into the economy without an additional unit 
of foreign exchange reserves being obtained first. Eight countries, including Hong Kong, uti￾lize currency boards as a means of fixing their exchange rates.
Argentina. In 1991, Argentina moved from its previous managed exchange rate of the 
Argentine peso to a currency board structure. The currency board structure pegged the 
Argentine peso’s value to the U.S. dollar on a one-to-one basis. The Argentine government 
preserved the fixed rate of exchange by requiring that every peso issued through the Argentine 
banking system be backed by either gold or U.S. dollars held on account in banks in Argentina. 
This 100% reserve system made the monetary policy of Argentina dependent on the country’s 
ability to obtain U.S. dollars through trade or investment. Only after Argentina had earned 
these dollars through trade could its money supply be expanded. This requirement eliminated 
the possibility of the nation’s money supply growing too rapidly and causing inflation.
Argentina’s system also allowed all Argentines and foreigners to hold dollar-denominated 
accounts in Argentine banks. These accounts were in actuality eurodollar accounts, dollar￾denominated deposits in non-U.S. banks. These accounts provided savers with the ability to 
choose whether or not to hold pesos.
From the very beginning there was substantial doubt in the market that the Argentine gov￾ernment could maintain the fixed rate. Argentine banks regularly paid slightly higher interest 
rates on peso-denominated accounts than on dollar-denominated accounts. This interest differ￾ential represented the market’s assessment of the risk inherent in the Argentine financial system. 
Depositors were rewarded for accepting risk—for keeping their money in peso-denominated ac￾counts. In January 2002, after months of economic and political turmoil and nearly three years of 
economic recession, the Argentine currency board was ended. The peso was first devalued from 
Peso1.00/$ to Peso1.40/$; then it was floated completely. It fell in value dramatically within days. 
The Argentine decade-long experiment with a rigidly fixed exchange rate was over.

Dollarization
Several countries have suffered currency devaluation for many years, primarily as a result of 
inflation, and have taken steps toward dollarization. Dollarization is the use of the U.S. dollar as 
the official currency of the country. Panama has used the dollar as its official currency since 1907. 
Ecuador, after suffering a severe banking and inflationary crisis in 1998 and 1999, adopted the 
U.S. dollar as its official currency in January 2000. One of the primary attributes of dollarization 
was summarized well by BusinessWeek in a December 11, 2000, article titled “The Dollar Club”:
One attraction of dollarization is that sound monetary and exchange rate policies no longer 
depend on the intelligence and discipline of domestic policymakers. Their monetary policy 
becomes essentially the one followed by the U.S., and the exchange rate is fixed forever.
The arguments for dollarization follow logically from the previous discussion of the im￾possible trinity. A country that dollarizes removes any currency volatility (against the dollar) 
and would theoretically eliminate the possibility of future currency crises. Additional ben￾efits are expectations of greater economic integration with other dollar-based markets, both 
product and financial. This last point has led many to argue in favor of regional dollarization, 
in which several countries that are highly economically integrated may benefit significantly 
from dollarizing together.
Three major arguments exist against dollarization. The first is the loss of sovereignty over 
monetary policy. This is, however, the point of dollarization. Second, the country loses the 
power of seigniorage, the ability to profit from its ability to print its own money. Third, the 
central bank of the country, because it no longer has the ability to create money within its 
economic and financial system, can no longer serve the role of lender of last resort. This role 
carries with it the ability to provide liquidity to save financial institutions that may be on the 
brink of failure during times of financial crisis.
Ecuador. Ecuador officially completed the replacement of the Ecuadorian sucre with the 
U.S. dollar as legal tender in September 2000. This step made Ecuador the largest national 
adopter of the U.S. dollar, and in many ways it made Ecuador a test case of dollarization for 
other emerging market countries to watch closely. Ecuador’s dollarization came at the end of 
a massive two-year depreciation of the sucre.
During 1999, Ecuador suffered a rising rate of inflation and a falling level of economic 
output. In March 1999, the Ecuadorian banking sector was hit with a series of devastating 
“bank runs,” financial panics in which all depositors attempted to withdraw all of their funds 
simultaneously. Although there were severe problems in the Ecuadorian banking system, even 
the healthiest financial institution would fail under the strain of this financial drain. Ecuador’s 
president immediately froze all deposits. (This was termed a bank holiday in the U.S. in the 
1930s when banks closed their doors.) The value of the Ecuadorian sucre plummeted in early 
March, inducing the country to default on more than $13 billion in foreign debt in 1999 alone. 
Ecuador’s president moved quickly to propose dollarization to save the Ecuadorian economy.
By January 2000, when the next president took office (after a rather complicated mili￾tary coup and subsequent withdrawal), the sucre had fallen in value to Sucre25,000 = $1.00. 
The new president continued the dollarization initiative. Although unsupported by the U.S. 
government and the IMF, Ecuador completed its replacement of its own currency with the 
dollar over the next nine months. Today, many years later, Ecuador continues to struggle to 
find both economic (a positive experience) and political balance (continuing concern over its 
lack of independent monetary policy) with its new currency regime.
El Salvador. El Salvador replaced its currency, the colón, in 2001 with the U.S. dollar. Like 
other dollarization adopters, El Salvador had suffered for years with hyperinflation and a 
dysfunctional monetary policy. Since dollarization it has enjoyed the lowest inflation rate 
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 70 08/05/23 9:33 AMCHAPTER 2 International Monetary System 71
in Central America, averaging just 2.0% per annum, and an extended period of relatively 
healthy economic growth.
In June 2021, El Salvador shocked the world when it would become the first country 
in the world to make a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, legal tender. In the surprise announcement, 
the country’s president announced that Bitcoin would not replace U.S. dollars as the cur￾rency of the realm but trade alongside them. It is obviously too easy to assess how this bi￾currency monetary program will perform, but there is widespread concern that the volatility 
in Bitcoin’s price is inconsistent with its use as money. The age-old description of what money 
should do—serve as a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value—did not 
necessarily fit Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s volatile price made its use as a store of value unlikely.
Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has long suffered from hyperinflation, most of which was driven 
by rapid increases in its money supply by printing money. The government of Zimbabwe 
repeatedly attempted to re-denominate the currency—2006, 2008, and 2009—by eliminating 
multiple 0s from its official rate, none of which worked to stabilize its value. In April 2009 
the country officially abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar, adopting the use of multiple foreign 
currencies including the South African rand, Botswana pula, British pound sterling, Indian 
rupee, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, and U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar, how￾ever, held the major share of exchange, frequently suffering from severe shortages.
The multiple foreign currency system by all accounts was more stable than the preceding 
Zimbabwe home currency but suffered from massive exchange costs and disruptions. In June 
2019, the central bank of Zimbabwe, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, officially ended the 
multiple-currency system and introduced the Real Time Gross Settlement Dollar (RTGS), 
commonly termed the zimdollar or zollar. In March 2020, official use of foreign currencies 
was once again initiated as inflation reignited. The rate of change in consumer prices was re￾portedly over 350% per annum by January 2021.
Currency Regime Choices for Emerging Markets
There is no doubt that for many emerging markets the choice of a currency regime may lie 
somewhere between the extremes of a hard peg (a currency board or dollarization) and free 
floating. However, many experts have argued for years that the global financial marketplace 
will drive more and more emerging market nations toward one of these extremes. As shown 
in Exhibit 2.11, there is a distinct lack of middle ground between rigidly fixed and free-floating 
extremes. But is the so-called bipolar choice inevitable?
There are three common features of emerging market economies that make any specific 
currency regime choice difficult: (1) weak fiscal, financial, and monetary institutions; (2) ten￾dencies for commerce to allow currency substitution and the denomination of liabilities in 
dollars; and (3) the emerging market’s vulnerability to sudden stoppages of outside capital 
flows. Calvo and Mishkin (2003) may have said it best:4
Indeed, we believe that the choice of exchange rate regime is likely to be one of second 
order importance to the development of good fiscal, financial and monetary institutions in 
producing macroeconomic success in emerging market countries. Rather than treating the 
exchange rate regime as a primary choice, we would encourage a greater focus on institu￾tional reforms like improved bank and financial sector regulation, fiscal restraint, building 
consensus for a sustainable and predictable monetary policy and increasing openness to 
trade.

Mishkin, The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 17, No. 4, Autumn 2003, pp. 99–118.
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 71 08/05/23 9:33 AM72 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
In anecdotal support of this argument, a poll of the general population in Mexico in 
1999 indicated that 9 out of 10 people would prefer dollarization to a floating-rate peso. 
Clearly, many in the emerging markets have little faith in their leadership and institutions 
to implement an effective exchange rate policy. In the end, the currency regime choices of 
many emerging markets are under constant attack from innovation and digitization and even 
Internet startups, as illustrated by Global Finance in Practice 2.4.
Reserve Currencies and What Lies Ahead
Regime structures like the gold standard required no cooperative policies among coun￾tries, only the assurance that all would abide by the rules of the game. Under the gold 
standard, this assurance translated into the willingness of governments to buy or sell gold 
at parity rates on demand. The Bretton Woods Agreement, the system in place between 
1944 and 1973, required more in the way of cooperation, in that gold was no longer the 
“rule,” and countries were required to cooperate to a higher degree to maintain the dollar￾based system. Exchange rate systems, like the European Monetary System’s (EMS) fixed 
exchange rate band system used from 1979 to 1999, were hybrids of these cooperative and 
rule regimes.
The present international monetary system is characterized by no rules, with varying de￾grees of cooperation. Although there is no present solution to the continuing debate over 
what form a new international monetary system should take, many believe that it will suc￾ceed into the future only if it combines cooperation among nations with individual discretion 
to pursue domestic social, economic, and financial goals. Absent in new formal agreements 
internationally, trends in reserve currencies—currencies held by central banks and official ex￾change authorities—indicate the continuing dominance of the U.S. dollar and a growing role

of the euro. (The euro’s growth in use as a reserve and anchor currency in Africa has been 
dramatic.) But change may be in the wind as the increasing digitalization of global finance, 
including digital currencies like the digital yuan (eCNY), disrupt the international monetary 
system. A recent IMF study summarized the state of reserve currencies.5
Despite major structural shifts in the international monetary system over the past six de￾cades, the US dollar remains the dominant international reserve currency. Using a newly 
compiled database of individual economies’ reserve holdings by currency, this depart￾mental paper finds that financial links have been an increasingly important driver of 
reserve currency configurations since the global financial crisis, particularly for emerging 
market and developing economies. The paper also finds a rise in inertial effects, imply￾ing that the US dollar dominance is likely to endure. But historical precedents of sudden 
changes suggest that new developments, such as the emergence of digital currencies and 
new payments ecosystems, could accelerate the transition to a new landscape of reserve 
currencies.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 2.4
remittance process was quite costly, as remittance provid￾ers like Western Union or MoneyGram might charge a fee of 
4% or higher. (A typical dollar exchange of $200 might cost 
$8.23 by Western Union from the UK to Nigeria in 2016.) 
A number of startup businesses began to consolidate the 
British pounds of Nigerians in the UK in a single large bank 
account and then do a “swap” of pounds for naira with the 
British airlines. The exchange was executed by simply draw￾ing upon each other’s accounts held in British and Nigerian 
banks. The consolidators paid money into a London bank 
(in pounds), and the airline in turn paid funds from its bank 
account in Nigeria to private accounts in Nigeria (in naira)—in 
effect, a modern version of a foreign exchange strategy long 
known as a back-to-back cross-currency swap.
Currency Apps. A number of startup companies—
Xendpay and Azimo are two—have entered the London 
market in recent years with mobile apps lowering the cost 
of remittance dramatically for individual Nigerians, often to 
less than 1% of the transaction amount. Simply by transfer￾ring money between accounts in London banks and Nigerian 
banks, individuals could transfer funds at a fraction of the 
previous cost and often at a much more favorable exchange 
rate. Unfortunately, in July 2016, the CBN put a stop to both 
exchanges. Because the swaps and transfers exchanged 
Nigerian naira at exchange rates that did not go through 
the CBN, they were considered potentially harmful and “un￾wholesome.” As one Nigerian journalist noted, just when you 
thought things couldn’t get any worse, they did.
Nigeria Fights Currency Exchange Innovation
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is the government body 
responsible for all currency-related exchange. The CBN 
maintained a fixed exchange rate of the currency, the 
Nigerian naira (NGN, N), versus the U.S. dollar until June 
2016 when it allowed the naira to float. The fall in the global 
price of oil over the previous two years had resulted in sig￾nificantly lower export earnings—and the ability to generate 
foreign exchange reserves of U.S. dollars. When Nigeria’s 
export earnings fell, the CBN found itself short on dollars 
or other convertible currencies like the British pound for ex￾change. Anyone, including multinational companies, who 
wished to exchange Nigerian naira for foreign currency had 
to apply for the exchange with the CBN. CBN then deter￾mined some allocation, eventually.
British Airlines and the Nigerian Diaspora. A num￾ber of British airlines service the Nigerian market. Those 
airlines collect fares in local currency, naira, and then go 
to the CBN for exchange into either dollars or pounds. But 
with the growing shortage of hard currency, the airlines had 
to wait longer and longer periods of time. Following June 
2016, this wait often meant getting fewer and fewer dol￾lars or pounds with the declining value of the naira. But a 
solution arose from the large population of Nigerian nation￾als living and working in the UK. This diaspora earns British 
pounds and regularly exchanges it for Nigerian naira to be 
sent back to their families in Nigeria. Historically such a

Summary Points
■ Under the gold standard (1876–1913), the rules 
of the game were that each country set the rate 
at which its currency unit could be converted to a 
weight of gold.
■ During the interwar years (1914–1944), currencies 
were allowed to fluctuate over fairly wide ranges in 
terms of gold and each other. Supply and demand 
forces determined exchange rate values.
■ The Bretton Woods Agreement (1944) established 
a U.S. dollar-based international monetary system. 
Under the original provisions of the Bretton Woods 
Agreement, all countries fixed the value of their 
currencies in terms of gold but were not required to 
exchange their currencies for gold. Only the dollar 
remained convertible into gold (at $35 per ounce).
■ A variety of economic forces led to the suspension 
of the convertibility of the dollar into gold in August 
1971. Exchange rates of most of the leading trading 
countries were then allowed to float in relation to the 
dollar and thus indirectly in relation to gold.
■ If the ideal currency regime existed in today’s world, it 
would possess three attributes: a fixed value, convert￾ibility, and independent monetary policy. However, in 
both theory and practice, it is impossible for all three 
attributes to be simultaneously maintained—the im￾possible trinity.
■ Emerging market countries must often choose between 
two extreme exchange rate regimes: a free-floating 
regime or an extremely fixed regime, such as a cur￾rency board or dollarization.
■ The members of the EU are also members of the 
European Monetary System (EMS). This group has 
tried to form an island of fixed exchange rates among 
themselves in a sea of major floating currencies. 
Members of the EMS rely heavily on trade with each 
other, so the day-to-day benefits of fixed exchange 
rates between them are perceived to be great.
■ The euro affects markets in three ways: (1) Countries 
within the eurozone enjoy cheaper transaction costs, 
(2) currency risks and costs related to exchange rate 
uncertainty are reduced, and (3) all consumers and 
businesses both inside and outside the eurozone 
enjoy price transparency and increased price-based 
competition.
■ Emerging market countries today often must make a 
currency regime choice between two extremes, freely 
floating and dollarization/currency board.
■ China’s currency, the yuan or renminbi, is rapidly mov￾ing toward taking a role as one of the top three or four 
currencies in the international monetary system.
■ Although the U.S. dollar and European euro remain 
dominant reserve currencies, the introduction of digi￾tal currencies in the coming years, led by the Chinese 
digital yuan, may alter the global currency landscape 
dramatically.
MINI-CASE 
The Promise of the Digital Yuan6
These “govcoins” are a new incarnation of money. 
They promise to make finance work better but also to 
shift power from individuals to the state, alter geopoli￾tics and change how capital is allocated. They are to be 
treated with optimism, and humility.
—“The Digital Currencies That Matter,” The Economist, 
May 8, 2021
China has long been a source of innovation in money, having 
been instrumental in the creation of the first coins, the first 
bank receipts (leading to the issuance of paper money), and 
now the development of digital currency, the eYuan (e-CNY) 
or digital yuan. A digital money backed by the central bank, 
a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or “govcoin” as the

Economist termed it, would constitute a major change to the 
current financial ecosystem in any economy and in some ways 
coexist or compete with traditional bank-based financial ac￾counts and payment processing, as well as contemporary in￾novations such as cryptocurrencies and private-sector digital 
wallets. Hundreds of questions surrounded these issues, but 
as China moved quickly toward the launch of its own CBDC, 
answers needed to come quickly.
Cryptocurrencies and Mobile Wallets
The role and development of a digital currency are best 
understood in the context of the rapid development of two 
potential threats or competitors to traditional money and 
payments transactions: cryptocurrencies and digital wal￾lets (mobile wallets).
M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 74 08/05/23 9:33 AMCHAPTER 2 International Monetary System 75
Cryptocurrencies have been called the anti-bank 
money or the anti-government money. A cryptocurrency 
is a virtual or digital currency that relies on some form 
of cryptography to protect it from being double-used or 
counterfeited. The first and foremost form of that cryptog￾raphy, blockchain technology, allows a highly transparent 
and secure mechanism for its use in exchange. Led by the 
development of Bitcoin in 2009, a number of cryptocur￾rencies have gained widespread use globally. Whether they 
are true money or some form of investment or speculative 
vehicle remains a point of debate.7
Regardless, digital currency has sparked concern 
among government regulators and central banks every￾where, including China. The potential to be money used 
for exchange, particularly cross-border, without going 
through traditional financial institutions like banks while 
not being backed or issued by government was clearly 
disruptive. Would they constitute an uncontrollable di￾mension of money supply growth? Would they be used 
to move capital internationally out of the reach of official 
governance? Would they constitute a massive asset or se￾curity class beyond traditional securities and investment 
laws?8
 Despite official confusion by regulators, following 
Bitcoin’s early success and popularity, other cryptocurren￾cies emerged—Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, NEO, IOTA—
to name but a few.
At this same time, the growth of digital wallets—Pay￾Pal, AliPay, WeChat Pay—grew rapidly. These digital pay￾ments applications allow buying and selling of all things 
economic without the use of traditional cash, bank checks, 
or credit cards. And once again, they operated outside the 
traditional banking system. The largest in China, AliPay, 
was launched in China in 2004 by Alibaba, the Chinese 
e-commerce multinational. Led by its founder Jack Ma, 
AliPay is a third-party mobile and online payment plat￾form utilizing a Quick Response (QR) code (a matrix 
barcode invented in 1994 by Denso Wave of Japan) on a 
personal phone to conduct electronically recorded trans￾actions in an instant. Surpassing PayPal in 2013 as the 
world’s largest online payment platform, it continues to 
grow in its market dominance position in China. In 2020, 
AliPay and WeChat Pay, a subsidiary of Tencent, combined 
made up more than 50% of all digital payments in China. 
This, combined with the growing monopoly power of Ali￾baba itself, concerned the Chinese government.
The Ant Group (formerly known as Alibaba), with 
AliPay’s success, had grown extremely powerful in Chi￾na by 2020. Its platform and apps allowed users to essen￾tially bypass the existing Chinese financial system—and 
its regulations—mimicking the multitude of functions 
provided by commercial banks such as transaction 
processing and extending credit. The Ant Group’s ini￾tial public offering (IPO), estimated at over $34 billion 
scheduled for October 2020, was stopped unceremoni￾ously by the Chinese government. It seems that both it 
and its leader, Jack Ma, had transgressed too far into 
government-regulated territory. The following months 
saw Jack Ma go into seclusion, The Ant Group forced 
to undertake new regulatory restrictions including re￾duced lending activities, and the launch of the digital 
yuan accelerated.
Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)
Central banks have been studying cryptocurrencies and 
digital wallets for more than a decade as they potentially 
threatened the abilities of central banks to effectively 
execute their public policy responsibilities. Those respon￾sibilities, although different by country, always include 
controlling the size and growth of the money supply, 
ensuring a financial system’s ability to provide credit and 
to process payments in the conduct of economic activity. 
Weighty responsibilities, to say the least.
Central bank interest at this stage of digital currency 
development follows two different lines of thought. The 
first is that the growing use of online payments could fail. 
As the lender of last resort in a national financial system, 
this would fall in the lap of the central bank. The second 
reason was related to current reality, the growing influence 
and power of private sector digital wallet providers. China 
was a prime example, with AliPay and WeChat Pay garner￾ing more than 50% of the person-to-person payment mar￾ket. With growing private sector power comes monopoly 
power, and with that comes fees and other forms of un￾regulated rent-taking.
In theory, CBDC could potentially restructure the en￾tire financial ecosystem. The first example of this is why 
should an individual continue to hold CBDC in a commer￾cial bank when they could hold it directly with the central 
bank? The commercial banks carry their own risks of fail￾ure; central banks cannot fail. And if there was no need to 
hold currency in the commercial banks, where would com￾mercial banks acquire the deposits or capital to fund their 
lending? And if commercial banks were no longer based 
on fractional reserve banking, what would that mean for 
monetary policy within a national financial ecosystem? 
Obviously these were all questions far beyond peer-to-peer 
digital payments, but opening the door to direct central 
bank deposits by private entities beyond banks posed 
many challenges.

As central banks all over the world dove deeper in 
the digital abyss, structural guidance was clearly needed. 
A recent Bank for International Settlements study noted 
that there are three foundational principles that must be 
considered in the implementation of a digital currency:9
1. Do No Harm. Any new monetary innovations should 
not disrupt the central bank’s ability to support mon￾etary and financial stability. And it should not create 
new forms of money that constitute winners and los￾ers for payments—so-called uniformity of a currency.
2. Coexistence. New forms of central bank–sponsored 
money should coexist with the currency organizations 
and systems for monetary policy and payments pro￾cessing (think commercial banks).
3. Innovation and Efficiency. New monetary innova￾tions introduced in the name of efficiency should not 
inadvertently reduce efficiency by creating winners 
and losers among organizations and monetary vehi￾cles, specifically between public enterprises like reg￾ulators and central banks and their private industry 
partners, commercial banks and financial institutions.
Those principles could prove challenging to the cur￾rent organizational landscape of the financial system.
Digital Yuan
The digital yuan resides in cyberspace, available on the 
owner’s mobile phone—or on a card for the less tech￾savvy—and spending it doesn’t strictly require an online 
connection.10
The Chinese government began a series of tests of the 
government-backed digital currency in 2020 with significant 
success. In December, central bank authorities in the city 
of Suzhou awarded 20 million digital yuan ($3.1 million) 
through a lottery. Winners received 200 yuan in digital cur￾rency in a red envelope (the traditional way of gifting cash 
during Chinese holidays like the Chinese New Year) to be 
spent as they chose. Within months more than 100,000 peo￾ple had downloaded the apps needed for e-CNY use.
The digital yuan (e-CNY) is part of an acknowledged 
initiative by the Chinese government to eventually re￾place physical currency. It would serve as a replacement 
for paper money, with each digital yuan effectively replac￾ing a yuan circulating in paper form. The People’s Bank of 
China would use the existing commercial banking system 
as the conduit for its introduction, distributing e-CNY to 
them and charging them with the task of expediting the 
exchange of hard currency, paper and coins, into digital 
currency.11 But it would still mimic paper money as trans￾actions are direct between buyer and seller and would not 
be processed through the banking system.
Unlike mobile payment systems, the digital yuan 
would not require or use Wi-Fi access. The digital yuan 
uses near field communication (NFC), a set of protocols 
for communication between two electronic devices a very 
short distance apart, roughly 4 centimeters or 11.5 inches. 
This allows increased user security without having to use a 
physical connection or link.
In early tests, private individuals and retailers alike 
showed a strong willingness to try it and use it. Retailers, 
including McDonald’s and Starbucks, were quick to adopt 
it; payments required only a handheld phone or an elec￾tronic card. The currency has the look of paper money, 
with an image of Mao Zedong. Transactions did not incur 
charges or fees for either the customer or the vendor. This 
was particularly attractive to retailers who were charged 
by digital platforms for their use. Users simply had to sign 
up with the Chinese government and provide their per￾sonal identification code.
The digital yuan in some ways combined the best 
attributes of cryptocurrencies and mobile payment apps 
with none of the negatives: no fees, no Internet require￾ments, government backing. And the Chinese government 
gained as well. It could theoretically track all individual 
transactions in the economy, products and services, as well 
as the volume and nature of changing consumer tastes 
and trends. The government and People’s Bank of China 
(PBC) would gain enormous information on money in the 
Chinese economy.
There are, however, a number of concerns about digital 
currency. For example, the money could have an expiration 
date; the government could set a calendar date that would 
cancel the currency if it had not been spent. This might 
prove useful for capital injection initiatives like those used 
by governments all over the world in an effort to jump-start 
economies after the COVID global pandemic.
A second concern, possibly of more weight, was that 
the Chinese government would now be able to track every 
single transaction made by every person. Although this 
would be a powerful tool in efforts to stop illegal business 
activities, it would also mean the average citizen giving

commercial banks trading and processing currency pay￾ments globally. Dollar-based cross-border transactions 
must flow through the Society for Worldwide Interbank 
Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network, the glob￾al information system used for standardized and reliable 
financial transactions information, a network dominated 
by the U.S. dollar. The U.S. government has in the recent 
past used its influence to lock a number of countries out of 
the system, from North Korea to Myanmar.
Analysts believe there is no debate as to whether the 
digital yuan will be successful domestically by individuals; 
they take that as a given. But the world of cross-border 
payments, typically requiring an exchange of currencies, is 
one dominated not by individual personal transactions but 
by multinational businesses. Those business participants 
still value freedom from restrictions (capital controls) and 
selective degrees of privacy.
MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. Do you believe the digital yuan is meant to fight 
private enterprise, via cryptocurrencies and mo￾bile apps, from capturing the market for monetary 
transactions?
2. What role will commercial banks and other tra￾ditional financial institutions have in the Chinese 
digital currency world? Banks employ hundreds of 
thousands of people in China. Do you believe the 
Chinese government would be willing to make many 
of those people obsolete?
3. If one tabulated the pros and cons of digital cur￾rency development, do the pros outweigh the cons? 
Is it possible to find “fixes” for the cons to allow an 
acceptable digital currency development in other 
major industrial markets like the United States or 
European Union?
up a great amount of privacy. Given the existing high de￾gree of monitoring in China (e.g., the extremely high use 
of cameras in public places tracking people through facial 
recognition), this was for some not a great concern. The 
trade-off—“convenience for freedom,” in the words of 
some—was worth it. The PBC had tried to calm such con￾cerns by limiting the tracking of individuals, promoting a 
standard of “controllable anonymity.”
International Reach
The Chinese government has continually reiterated its fo￾cus on launching digital yuan domestically, postponing any 
major expansion to international transactions. That said, 
in 2021 China entered into a number of joint projects with 
the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the cen￾tral banks of Thailand, Hong Kong, and the United Arab 
Emirates to study the use of digital currency exchange and 
payments on a cross-border basis. Analysts, however, see 
China’s stringent use of capital controls, capital’s ability to 
move in and out of the Chinese economy, as a barrier to 
the growth of the yuan internationally, whether in physical 
or digital form.
China sees the launch of the digital yuan as the next step 
in securing what it terms monetary sovereignty to oppose 
dollar dominance. The digital yuan has raised concerns 
among Western nations that it might move to eventually 
replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s premier reserve cur￾rency. If digital exchange agreements were established 
between selective governments on a bilateral basis, the 
international reach and resilience of the yuan could grow.
An expanding digital yuan would also have the poten￾tial to replace the U.S. government’s political influence in 
some arenas (e.g., the U.S. ban on commercial transactions 
with Iran). Frequently referred to as dollar weaponization, 
the U.S. government has worked to maintain its ability to 
observe and in many cases manage who uses the currency

pounds (GBP), the other euros (EUR). If you were 
to check the Chunnel’s rail ticket Internet rates, you 
would find that they would be denominated in U.S. 
dollars (USD). For example, a first-class round-trip 
fare for a single adult from London to Paris via the 
Chunnel through RailEurope may cost USD170.00. 
This currency neutrality, however, means that cus￾tomers on both ends of the Chunnel pay differing

of Korea sells 25 million Chilean pesos worth 
of semiconductors to Empresa Nacional de 
Telecomunicaciones S.A., Chile, on January 1, 2019. 
The sale is invoiced in Chilean pesos (contract for 
settlement). The spot exchange rate on January 1, 
2019, was CLP 0.6235 = 1.0 KRW, so a sale of 25 mil￾lion Chilean pesos is recorded on Samsung’s finan￾cial statements as KRW 40,096,230.95. If Empresa 
Nacional de Telecomunicaciones S.A. paid 2 months 
later, on March 1, the spot rate is CLP 0.5829 = 1.0 
KRW. If Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones 
S.A. did not pay until April 1 (90 days), the spot rate 
is CLP 0.5983 = 1.0 KRW.

2.15 Tsar Alexander’s Gold Loan. The Russian govern￾ment of Tsar Alexander III issued a 100-year bearer 
bond in 1894. (One of the coupon payments and the 
bond itself are reproduced on the following page.) 
A bearer bond is a security sold to an investor in 
which the bearer of the bond, the holder, is entitled 
to receive an interest payment (the coupon) at regu￾larly scheduled dates as listed on the bond. There 
is no record kept by any authority of who owns the 
bond, the bearer is the implicit owner. There is also 
no record of who receives the coupon payments, if 
the coupons are redeemed at the recommended 
banks and cities of the time. This allowed the

be revalued by 20% or 30%. What would be the 
new exchange rate value if the yuan was revalued an 
additional 20% or 30% from its initial post-revalua￾tion rate of Yuan8.11 = $1.00?
2.10 TEXPAK in the United Kingdom. TEXPAK is a 
Pakistani-based textile firm that is facing increasing 
competition from other manufacturers in emerging 
markets selling in Europe. All garments are pro￾duced in Pakistan, with costs and pricing initially 
stated in Pakistani rupees (PKR), but converted to 
British pounds (GBP) for distribution and sale in 
the United Kingdom. In 2014, one suit was priced at 
PKR 11,000 with a British pound price set at GBP95. 
In 2015, the GBP appreciated in value versus the 
PKR, averaging PKR120 = GBP 1.00. In order to 
preserve the GBP price and product profit margin in 
rupees, what should the new rupee price be set at?

investor to earn the interest without tax authorities 
knowing the investor’s identity. These tax-free re￾turns allowed the bond issuer, in this case the Tsar, 
to raise capital at lower interest rates.
This bond paid interest on a quarterly basis. As 
noted on the coupon and on the bond itself, there 
were explicit dates on each individual coupon as 
to when it could be redeemed. In order for the 
investor to redeem their coupons for cash pay￾ment, the bond contained a sheet of coupons that 
were numbered and dated. Individual coupons 
were clipped from the sheet and taken to one of 
the listed banks around the world to receive their 
interest payment. This bond listed the cities and 
the amount of the interest payment in local cur￾rency terms. The 118th coupon in the series is re￾produced here.
This 118th coupon, which the bearer can present 
for payment beginning June 18, 1923, indicates what 
payment the bearer can receive depending on which 
currency the bearer is receiving payment. This obvi￾ously implies a set of fixed exchange rates in effect 
on the date of issuance (1894). Use the coupon repro￾duced below to answer the following questions.

M02_EITE5960_16_GE_C02.indd 80 08/05/23 9:33 AMThe measurement of all international economic transactions that take place between the resi￾dents of a country and foreign residents is called the balance of payments (BOP). This chapter 
provides a sort of navigational map to aid in interpreting the balance of payments and the 
multitude of economic, political, and business issues that it involves. But our emphasis is far 
from descriptive, as a deep understanding of trade and capital flows is integral to the manage￾ment of multinational enterprises. In fact, the second half of the chapter emphasizes a more 
detailed analysis of how elements of the balance of payments affect trade volumes and prices, 
as well as how capital flows, capital controls, and capital flight alter the cost of and ability to 
do business internationally. The chapter concludes with the mini-case Global Remittances: 
Contributions of the Invisibles, which explores how the remittances of migrant workers im￾pact their home countries, even in the year of a global pandemic.
Home-country and host-country BOP data, and their sub-accounts, are important to busi￾ness managers, investors, consumers, and government officials because the data simultaneously 
influence and are influenced by other key macroeconomic variables, such as gross domestic 
product (GDP), employment levels, price levels, exchange rates, and interest rates. Monetary 
and fiscal policy must take the BOP into account at the national level. Business managers and

3.1 Explore the fundamentals of balance of payments accounting, how nations measure 
their own levels of international economic activity and cross-border payments
3.2 Examine the two fundamental accounts of the balance of payments—the current 
account and financial account
3.3 Describe how changes in the balance of payments impact key macroeconomic 
rates—interest rates and exchange rates
3.4 Consider how international trade is altered by exchange rate changes
3.5 Explore the evolution of capital mobility and the conditions that sometimes lead to 
crisis
The sort of dependence that results from exchange, i.e., from commercial transactions, 
is a reciprocal dependence. We cannot be dependent upon a foreigner without his being 
dependent on us. Now, this is what constitutes the very essence of society. To sever natu￾ral interrelations is not to make oneself independent, but to isolate oneself completely.

M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 81 08/05/23 9:31 AM82 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
investors need BOP data to anticipate changes in host-country economic policies that might 
be driven by BOP events. BOP data are also important for the following reasons:
■ The BOP is an important indicator of pressure on a country’s foreign exchange rate and 
thus of the potential for a firm trading with or investing in that country to experience for￾eign exchange gains or losses. Changes in the BOP may predict the imposition or removal 
of foreign exchange controls.
■ Changes in a country’s BOP may signal the imposition or removal of controls over pay￾ment of dividends and interest, license fees, royalty fees, or other cash disbursements to 
foreign firms or investors.
■ The BOP helps to forecast a country’s market potential, especially in the short run. A 
country experiencing a serious trade deficit is not as likely to expand imports, as it would 
be if running a surplus. It may, however, welcome investments that increase its exports.
3.1 Fundamentals of BOP Accounting
BOP accounting is saddled with terminology from corporate accounting, but this adopted ter￾minology has different meanings within this context. The word balance creates a false image 
of a corporate balance sheet. A BOP statement is a statement of cash flows over an interval 
of time more in accord with a corporate income statement, but on a cash basis. BOP account￾ing also uses the terms debit and credit in its own unique way. A BOP credit is an event, such 
as the export of a good or service, that records foreign exchange earned—an inflow of for￾eign exchange to the country. A debit records foreign exchange spent, such as payments for 
imports or purchases of services—an outflow of foreign exchange. International transactions 
take many forms. Each of the following examples is an international economic transaction 
that is counted and captured in the U.S. balance of payments:
■ A U.S.-based firm, Jacobs, manages the construction of a major water treatment facility 
in Bangkok, Thailand.
■ The U.S. subsidiary of a French firm, Saint Gobain, pays profits back to its parent firm in 
Paris.
■ An American tourist purchases a small Lapponia necklace in Finland.
■ The U.S. government finances the purchase of military equipment for its military ally Norway.
■ A Mexican lawyer purchases a U.S. corporate bond through an investment broker in 
Cleveland.
The BOP has three major sub-accounts: the current account, the capital account, and 
the financial account. And when these three sub-accounts are supplemented with errors and 
omissions, the BOP must balance. If it does not, something has not been counted or has been 
counted improperly. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that “the BOP is in disequilibrium.” It 
cannot be. The supply and demand for a country’s currency may be imbalanced, but that is 
not the same as the entire BOP. A sub-account of the BOP, such as the balance on goods and 
services (a sub-account of any country’s current account), may be imbalanced (in surplus or 
deficit), but the entire BOP of a single country is always balanced.
Exhibit 3.1 illustrates that the BOP does indeed balance, in this case for the United States. 
The five balances listed in Exhibit 3.1—current account, capital account, financial account, net 
errors and omissions, and reserves and related items—do indeed sum to zero.
There are three main elements of the actual process of measuring international eco￾nomic activity: (1) identifying what is and is not an international economic transaction; (2) 
M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 82 08/05/23 9:31 AMCHAPTER 3 The Balance of Payments 83
understanding how the flow of goods, services, assets, and money creates debits and credits 
to the overall BOP; and (3) understanding the bookkeeping procedures for BOP accounting. 
The BOP provides a systematic method for classifying these transactions. But when all else 
fails, a rule of thumb always aids the understanding of BOP accounting: Follow the cash flow.
Defining International Economic Transactions
Identifying international transactions is ordinarily not difficult. The export of merchandise—
goods such as trucks, machinery, computers, telecommunications equipment, and so forth—is 
obviously an international transaction. Imports, such as French wine, Japanese cameras, and 
German automobiles, are also clearly international transactions. But this merchandise trade 
is only a portion of the thousands of different international transactions that occur in the 
United States and other countries each year.
Many other international transactions are not so obvious. The purchase of a good like a 
glass figure in Venice, Italy, by a U.S. tourist is classified as a U.S. merchandise import. In fact, 
all expenditures made by U.S. tourists around the globe for services provided by, for example, 
restaurants and hotels are recorded in the U.S. balance of payments as imports of travel ser￾vices in the current account.
The BOP as a Flow Statement
As noted above, the BOP is often misunderstood because many people infer from its name 
that it is a balance sheet. However, it is, in fact, a cash flow statement. By recording all in￾ternational transactions over a period of time such as a year, the BOP tracks the continuing 
flows of purchases and payments between a country and all other countries. It does not add 
up the value of all assets and liabilities of a country on a specific date like a balance sheet 
does for an individual firm. (That is, in fact, the net international investment position [NIIP] of 
a country, described in a later section.) Two types of business transactions dominate the BOP:
1. Exchange of real assets. The exchange of goods (e.g., automobiles, computers, textiles) 
and services (e.g., banking, consulting, and travel services) for other goods and services 
(barter) or for money
2. Exchange of financial assets. The exchange of financial claims (e.g., stocks, bonds, loans, 
and purchases or sales of companies) for other financial claims or money.
Although assets can be identified as real or financial, it is often easier to think of all as￾sets as goods that can be bought and sold. The purchase of a hand-woven area rug in a shop in 
Bangkok by a U.S. tourist is not all that different from a Wall Street banker buying a British 
government bond for investment purposes.

BOP Accounting
The measurement of all transactions in and out of a country is a daunting task. Mistakes, er￾rors, and statistical discrepancies will occur. The primary problem is that double-entry book￾keeping is employed in theory but not in practice. Individual purchase and sale transactions 
should—in theory—result in financing entries in the balance of payments that match. In real￾ity, current, capital, and financial account entries are recorded independently of one another, 
not together as double-entry bookkeeping would prescribe. Thus, there will be discrepancies 
(to use a polite term for it) between debits and credits.
3.2 The Accounts of the Balance of Payments
The balance of payments is composed of three major sub-accounts: the current account, the 
capital account, and the financial account. In addition, the official reserves account tracks 
government currency transactions, and a fifth statistical sub-account, the net errors and 
omissions account, is produced to preserve the balance in the BOP. The word “net” in ac￾count titles means that payments and receipts, i.e., debits and credits, are netted within that 
account.
The Current Account
The current account includes all international economic transactions with income or pay￾ment flows occurring within the year, the current period. The current account consists of four 
subcategories:
1. Goods trade. The export and import of goods is known as the goods trade. Merchandise 
trade is the oldest and most traditional form of international economic activity. Although 
many countries depend on both imports and exports of goods, most countries seek to 
preserve either a balance or surplus on goods trade.
2. Services trade. The export and import of services is known as the services trade. Common 
international services are financial services provided by banks to foreign importers and 
exporters, travel services of airlines, and construction services of domestic firms in other 
countries. For the major industrial countries, this sub-account has shown the fastest 
growth in the past decade.
3. Income. This is predominantly current income associated with investments made in 
previous periods. If a U.S. firm created a subsidiary in South Korea to produce metal 
parts in a previous year, the proportion of net income that is paid back to the par￾ent company in the current year (the dividend) constitutes current investment income. 
Additionally, wages and salaries paid to nonresident workers are also included in this 
category.
4. Current transfers. Financial settlements associated with the change in ownership of real 
resources or financial items are called current transfers. Any transfer between countries 
that is one-way—a gift or grant—is termed a current transfer. For example, funds pro￾vided by the U.S. government to aid in the development of a less-developed nation are 
a current transfer. Transfer payments made by migrant or guest workers back to their 
home countries, global remittances, are an example of current transfers.
All countries possess some amount of trade, most of which is merchandise. Many less￾developed countries have little in the way of service trade, or items that fall under the income 
or transfers sub-accounts. The current account is typically dominated by the first component 
described above, the export and import of merchandise. For this reason, the balance of trade 
M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 84 08/05/23 9:31 AMCHAPTER 3 The Balance of Payments 85
(BOT) that is so widely quoted in the business press refers to the balance of exports and im￾ports of goods trade only. If the country is a larger industrialized country, however, the BOT 
is somewhat misleading, in that service trade is not included.
Exhibit 3.2 presents the two major components of the U.S. current account for the 
1985–2020 period: (1) goods trade and (2) services trade. The exhibit highlights the mag￾nitude of the goods trade deficit. In contrast, the balance on services, although not large 
in comparison to net goods trade, has run a small but consistent surplus over the past two 
decades.
Merchandise trade is the original core of international trade. The manufacturing of goods 
was the basis of the industrial revolution and the focus of the theory of comparative ad￾vantage in international trade. Manufacturing is traditionally the sector of the economy that 
employs most of a country’s workers. Declines in the U.S. BOT attributed to specific sectors, 
such as steel, automobiles, automotive parts, textiles, and shoe manufacturing, caused massive 
economic and social disruption.
Understanding merchandise import and export performance is much like understand￾ing the market for any single product. The demand factors that drive both are income, the 
economic growth rate of the buyer, and price of the product in the eyes of the consumer after 
passing through an exchange rate. U.S. merchandise imports reflect the income level of U.S. 
consumers and growth of industry. As income rises, so does the demand for imports. Exports 
follow the same principles, but in reverse. U.S. manufacturing exports depend not on the in￾comes of U.S. residents, but on the incomes of buyers of U.S. products globally.
When those economies are growing, the demand for U.S. products is growing. As illus￾trated in Exhibit 3.2, the United States has consistently run a surplus in services trade income. 
The major categories of services include travel and passenger fares, transportation services, 
expenditures by U.S. students abroad and foreign students studying in the U.S., telecommuni￾cations services, and financial services.

The Capital and Financial Accounts
The capital and financial accounts of the balance of payments measure all international eco￾nomic transactions of financial assets. The capital account is made up of transfers of financial 
assets and the acquisition and disposal of non-produced/nonfinancial assets. This account has 
only recently been introduced as a separate component in the IMF’s balance of payments. 
The magnitude of capital transactions covered by the capital account is relatively minor, and 
we will include it in principle in all of the following discussions of the financial account.
Financial Account
The financial account consists of four components: direct investment, portfolio investment, 
net financial derivatives, and other asset investment. Financial assets can be classified in a 
number of different ways, including by the length of the life of the asset (its maturity) and 
the nature of the ownership (public or private). The financial account, however, uses degree 
of control over assets or operations to classify financial assets. Direct investment is defined 
as investment that has a long-term life or maturity and in which the investor exerts some 
explicit degree of control over the assets. In contrast, portfolio investment is defined both 
as short-term in maturity and as an investment in which the investor has no control over 
the assets.
Direct Investment. This investment measure is the net balance of capital dispersed from 
and into a country like the United States for the purpose of exerting control over assets. 
Control is defined as taking a minimum ownership interest of 10%. If a U.S. firm builds a 
new automotive parts facility in another country or purchases a company in another coun￾try, this is a direct investment in the U.S. balance of payments accounts. When the capital 
flows out of the U.S., it enters the balance of payments as a negative cash flow. If, however, 
a foreign firm purchases a U.S. firm, it is a capital inflow and enters the balance of payments 
positively.
Foreign resident purchases of assets in a country are always somewhat controversial. 
The focus of concern over foreign investment in any country, including the United States, is 
on two issues: control and profit. Some countries place restrictions on what foreigners may 
own in their country. This rule is based on the premise that domestic land, assets, and indus￾try in general should be owned by citizens of the country. The U.S., however, has tradition￾ally imposed few restrictions on what foreign residents or firms can own or control in the 
country (with the exception of national security concerns). Unlike the case in the traditional 
debates over whether international trade should be free, there is no consensus on interna￾tional investment.
The second major focus of concern over foreign direct investment is who receives the 
profits from the enterprise. Foreign companies owning and operating firms in the U.S. will 
stimulate economic activity and provide jobs, regardless of who earns the profits—foreign or 
domestic investors. In spite of evidence that indicates foreign firms in the U.S. reinvest most 
of their profits in their U.S. businesses (in fact, at a higher rate than do domestic firms), the 
debate on possible profit drains has continued. Regardless of the actual choices made, the 
people of any nation feel that the profits of their work should remain at home.
The choice of words used to describe foreign investment can also influence public opin￾ion. If these massive capital inflows are described as “capital investments from all over the 
world demonstrating faith in the future of U.S. industry,” the net capital surplus is represented 
as decidedly positive. If, however, the net capital surplus is described as resulting in “the 
United States being the world’s largest debtor nation,” the negative connotation is obvious. 
Both are essentially spins on the same economic principles at work.
M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 86 08/05/23 9:31 AMCHAPTER 3 The Balance of Payments 87
Capital, whether short-term or long-term, flows to where the investor believes it can earn 
the greatest return for the level of risk. And although in an accounting sense this is “interna￾tional debt,” when the majority of the capital inflow occurs in the form of direct investment, a 
long-term commitment to jobs, production, services, technological, and other competitive in￾vestments, the impact on the competitiveness of industry located within a country is increased. 
Net direct investment cash flows for the U.S. for the 1990–2020 period are shown in Exhibit 3.3. 
Global Finance in Practice 3.1 details the inward FDI to the U.S. and China over the past 
15 years and how in the year of COVID (2020), China for the first time was the larger.
Portfolio Investment. This is the net balance of capital that flows into and out of a country 
but that does not reach the 10% ownership threshold of direct investment. If a U.S. resident 
purchases shares in a Japanese firm but does not attain the 10% threshold, we define the pur￾chase as a portfolio investment (and an outflow of capital). The purchase or sale of debt secu￾rities (like U.S. Treasury bills) across borders is also classified as portfolio investment because 
debt securities by definition do not provide the buyer with ownership or control.
Portfolio investment is capital invested in activities that are purely profit-motivated (re￾turn) rather than activities to control or manage the investment. Purchases of debt securities, 
bonds, interest-bearing bank accounts, and the like are intended only to earn a return. They 
provide no vote or control over the party issuing the debt. Purchases of debt issued by the 
U.S. government (U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds) by foreign investors constitute net 
portfolio investment in the United States. It is worth noting that most U.S. debt purchased by 
foreigners is U.S. dollar-denominated in the currency of the issuing country (dollars). Much 
of the foreign debt issued by nations such as Russia, Brazil, and Southeast Asian countries is 
also U.S. dollar-denominated and is therefore the currency of a foreign country. The foreign 
country must then earn dollars to repay its foreign-held debt, typically through exports.
As illustrated in Exhibit 3.3, portfolio investment has shown much more volatile behav￾ior than net foreign direct investment over time, although that is not the case over the past

years to follow. The fall in FDI in 2020 will have ripple effects 
for years to come.
Inward FDI is particularly the focus of many economic 
development initiatives. In 2020, a few countries—like the 
United States and China shown below—still attracted FDI 
capital, but in reduced levels. The year 2020 was also no￾table for being the first year on record in which China sur￾passed the U.S. in inward FDI.
In 2021 FDI activity rebounded, but in less productive 
forms. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity was one of 
the first sectors to rebound. Unfortunately, M&A does not 
have the expansive impacts on jobs and other industry activ￾ity as new greenfield investment does. That sector may not 
fully recover until 2025, according to the OECD.
Inward Foreign Direct Investment in the Year 
of COVID
The global pandemic of 2020 shut down the global economy 
in a variety of ways. One area impacted that may have im￾pacts for years to come is in inward foreign direct investment 
(FDI). Global FDI dropped by 38% in 2020 from the previous 
year, falling to a low not seen since 2005. COVID had a par￾ticularly devastating impact on FDI development because the 
world shut down travel. Without the ability to visit, study, and 
explore other physical countries and business landscapes, 
investors halted new project development. FDI is critically 
important to general industrial economic activity, particularly 
manufacturing and infrastructure, not for just one year but for

five years. Many U.S. debt securities, such as U.S. Treasury securities and corporate bonds, are 
consistently in high demand by foreign investors of all kinds. The motivating forces for port￾folio investment flows are always the same: return and risk. But their net behavior can change 
dramatically and quickly, as seen in the net outflows during the financial crisis of 2008–2009. 
These same debt securities have also been influential in a different measure of international 
investment activity, as described in Global Finance in Practice 3.2.
Other Asset Investment. This final component of the financial account consists of various 
short-term and long-term trade credits, cross-border loans from all types of financial insti￾tutions, currency deposits and bank deposits, and other receivables and payables related to 
cross-border trade.

Exhibit 3.4 illustrates the current account balance and the capital/financial account bal￾ances for the United States for the 1992–2020 period. The exhibit shows one of the basic eco￾nomic and accounting relationships of the balance of payments: the inverse relation between 
the current and financial accounts.
This inverse relationship is not accidental. The methodology of the balance of payments, 
double-entry bookkeeping, requires that the current and financial accounts be offsetting un￾less the country’s exchange rate is being highly manipulated by governmental authorities. 
The upcoming section on China describes one high profile case in which government policy 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 3.2
currencies and cross borders in recent years, ownership of 
assets and securities has clearly boomed.
One common method of putting a country’s NIIP into 
perspective is to measure it as a percentage of the total eco￾nomic size of the nation—the gross domestic product (GDP) 
of the country. As illustrated here, the NIIP of the U.S. has 
clearly seen a dramatic increase in recent years, now averag￾ing above 25% of U.S. GDP.
Although some observers have seen this growing per￾centage as a risk to the U.S. economy (for example, by calling 
the U.S. the world’s largest debtor nation), these investments 
in assets of all kinds in many ways represent the faith foreign 
investors have in the future of the nation and its economy. A 
large part of this investment is the purchase of U.S. govern￾ment securities, Treasury notes and bonds, issued in part to 
finance the U.S. government’s growing deficits. These foreign 
purchasers have therefore aided in the financing of the U.S. 
government’s budget deficit.
A Country’s Net International Investment Position 
(NIIP)
The net international investment position (NIIP) of a coun￾try is an annual measure of the assets owned abroad by 
its citizens, its companies, and its government, less the as￾sets owned by foreigners public and private in their country. 
Whereas a country’s balance of payments is often described 
as a country’s international cash flow statement, the NIIP may 
be interpreted as the country’s international balance sheet. 
NIIP is a country’s stock of foreign assets minus its stock of 
foreign liabilities.
The NIIP, in the same way company cash flows are 
related to a company’s balance sheet, is based upon and 
categorized by the same capital and financial accounts used 
in the balance of payments: direct investment, portfolio in￾vestment, other investment and reserve assets. As interna￾tional capital has found it easier and easier to move between

has thwarted economics—the twin surpluses of China. Countries experiencing large current 
account deficits fund these deficits through equally large surpluses in the financial account, 
and vice versa.
Net Errors and Omissions and Official Reserves Accounts
The final two accounts within the Balance of Payments are instrumental in the “balance.”
Net Errors and Omissions Account. As previously noted, because current and financial 
account entries are collected and recorded separately, errors or statistical discrepancies will 
occur. The net errors and omissions account ensures that the BOP actually balances.
Official Reserves Account. The Official Reserves Account is the total reserves held by 
official monetary authorities within a country. These reserves are normally composed of the 
major currencies used in international trade and financial transactions (so-called “hard cur￾rencies” like the U.S. dollar, European euro, and Japanese yen; gold; and Special Drawing 
Rights [SDRs]).
The significance of official reserves depends generally on whether a country is operating 
under a fixed exchange rate regime or a floating exchange rate system. If a country’s currency 
is fixed, the government of the country officially declares that the currency is convertible into 
a fixed amount of some other currency. For example, the Chinese yuan was fixed to the U.S. 
dollar for many years. It was the Chinese government’s responsibility to maintain this fixed 
rate, also called parity rate. If for some reason there was an excess supply of yuan on the cur￾rency market, to prevent the value of the yuan from falling, the Chinese government would 
have to support the yuan’s value by purchasing yuan on the open market (by spending its 
hard currency reserves) until the excess supply was eliminated. Under a floating rate system, 
the Chinese government possesses no such responsibility and the role of official reserves

is diminished. But as described in the following section, the Chinese government’s foreign 
exchange reserves are now the largest in the world, and if need be, it probably possesses suf￾ficient reserves to manage the yuan’s value for years to come.
Breaking the Rules: China’s Twin Surpluses
Exhibit 3.5 documents one of the more astounding BOP behaviors seen globally in many 
years—the twin surplus balances enjoyed by China for many years. China’s surpluses in 
both the current and financial accounts—termed the twin surplus in the business press—are 
highly unusual. Ordinarily, for example, in the cases of the United States (recall Exhibit 3.4), 
Germany, and Great Britain, a country will demonstrate an inverse relationship between the 
two accounts. As noted previously, this inverse relationship is not accidental, and typically il￾lustrates that most large, mature, industrial countries “finance” their current account deficits 
through equally large surpluses in the financial account. For some countries like Japan, it is 
the inverse; a current account surplus is matched against a financial account deficit.
China, however, has experienced a massive current account surplus and a sometimes siz￾able financial account surplus simultaneously. This is rare and an indicator of just how excep￾tional the growth of the Chinese economy has been. Although current account surpluses of 
this magnitude would ordinarily create a financial account deficit, the positive prospects of 
the Chinese economy have drawn such massive capital inflows into China that the financial 
account too is in surplus. It has also been perpetuated by rigid capital outflow restrictions, 
limiting the capital that may leave the country. Note that from 2014–2016 the net financial/
capital account balance did indeed go negative, more in line with traditional theoretical

expectations. This was partly a result of the continued deregulation of the Chinese finan￾cial sector combined with slowing economic growth. The financial/capital account balance 
returned to surplus in 2017–2019, partly the result of the reintroduction of capital controls 
and record inward investment.
The rise of the Chinese economy has been accompanied by a rise in its current account 
surplus, and subsequently, its accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, which increased by 
a factor of 16 between 2001 and 2013—rising from $200 billion to a peak level of nearly 
$3.7 trillion. Since that time, foreign exchange reserves have bounced upward and down￾ward with accumulation and currency market intervention. As of January 2018 they stood 
at $3.0 trillion. There is no real precedent for this buildup in foreign exchange reserves in 
global financial history. These reserves allow the Chinese government to manage the value 
of the Chinese yuan and its impact on Chinese competitiveness in the world economy. The 
magnitude of these reserves will allow the Chinese government to maintain a relatively sta￾ble managed fixed rate of the yuan against other major currencies like the U.S. dollar as long 
as it chooses.
3.3 BOP Impacts on Key Macroeconomic Rates
A country’s balance of payments both impacts and is impacted by the three macroeconomic 
rates of international finance: exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation rates.
The BOP and Exchange Rates
A country’s BOP can have a significant impact on its exchange rate and vice versa, depend￾ing on that country’s exchange rate regime. The relationship between the BOP and exchange 
rates can be illustrated by using a simplified equation that summarizes BOP data:

are financial inflows and outflows, respectively. FXB is the change in reserves balance. The 
balance of payments, BOP, is then the sum of the individual account balances. The effect of 
an imbalance in the BOP of a country works somewhat differently depending on whether 
that country has fixed exchange rates, floating exchange rates, or a managed exchange rate 
system.
Fixed Exchange Rate Countries. Under a fixed exchange rate system, the government 
bears the responsibility to ensure that the BOP is near zero. If the sum of the current and 
capital accounts do not approximate zero, the government is expected to intervene in the 
foreign exchange market by buying or selling official foreign exchange reserves. If the sum of 
the first two accounts is greater than zero, a surplus demand for the domestic currency exists 
in the world. To preserve the fixed exchange rate, the government must then intervene in the 
foreign exchange market and sell domestic currency for foreign currencies or gold in order to 
bring back the BOP to near zero.
If the sum of the current and capital accounts is negative, an excess supply of the do￾mestic currency exists in world markets. Then the government must intervene by buying the 
M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 92 08/05/23 9:31 AMCHAPTER 3 The Balance of Payments 93
domestic currency with its reserves of foreign currencies and gold. It is obviously important 
for a government to maintain significant foreign exchange reserve balances, sufficient to 
allow it to intervene effectively. If the country runs out of foreign exchange reserves, it will be 
unable to buy back its domestic currency and will be forced to devalue its currency.
Floating Exchange Rate Countries. Under a floating exchange rate system, the govern￾ment of a country has no responsibility to peg its foreign exchange rate. The fact that the 
current and capital account balances do not sum to zero will automatically—in theory—alter 
the exchange rate in the direction necessary to obtain a BOP near zero. For example, a coun￾try running a sizable current account deficit and a capital and financial accounts balance of 
zero will have a net BOP deficit. An excess supply of the domestic currency will appear on 
world markets. Like all goods in excess supply, the market will rid itself of the imbalance by 
lowering the price. Thus, the domestic currency will fall in value, and the BOP will move back 
toward zero.
Exchange rate markets do not always follow this theory, particularly in the short- to in￾termediate-term. This delay is known as the J-curve (detailed in an upcoming section). The 
deficit gets worse in the short run but moves back toward equilibrium in the long run.
Managed Floats. Although still relying on market conditions for day-to-day exchange rate 
determination, countries operating with managed floats often find it necessary to take action 
to maintain their desired exchange rate values. They often seek to alter the market’s valua￾tion of their currency by influencing the motivations of market activity, rather than through 
direct intervention in the foreign exchange markets.
The primary action taken by these governments is to change relative interest rates, thus 
influencing the economic fundamentals of exchange rate determination. In the context of the 
equation presented earlier, a change in domestic interest rates is an attempt to alter the capi￾tal account balance, CI - CO, especially the short-term portfolio component of these capital 
flows, in order to restore an imbalance caused by the deficit in the current account.
The power of interest rate changes on international capital and exchange rate move￾ments can be substantial. A country with a managed float that wishes to defend its currency 
may choose to raise domestic interest rates to attract additional capital from abroad. This step 
will alter market forces and create additional market demand for the domestic currency. In 
this process, the government signals to the markets that it intends to take measures to pre￾serve the currency’s value within certain ranges. However, this process also raises the cost of 
local borrowing for businesses, so the policy is seldom without domestic critics.
The BOP and Interest Rates
Apart from the use of interest rates to intervene in the foreign exchange market, the overall 
level of a country’s interest rates compared to other countries has an impact on the financial 
account of the balance of payments. Relatively low real interest rates should normally stimu￾late an outflow of capital seeking higher interest rates in other country currencies. However, 
in the case of the United States, the opposite effect has occurred. Despite relatively low real 
interest rates and large BOP deficits on the current account, the U.S. BOP financial account 
has experienced offsetting financial inflows due to relatively attractive U.S. growth rate pros￾pects, high levels of productive innovation, and perceived political safety. Thus, the financial 
account inflows have helped the United States to maintain its lower interest rates and to 
finance its exceptionally large fiscal deficit. However, it is beginning to appear that the fa￾vorable inflow on the financial account is diminishing while the U.S. balance on the current 
account is worsening.
M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 93 08/05/23 9:31 AM94 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
The BOP and Inflation Rates
Imports have the potential to lower a country’s inflation rate. In particular, imports of lower￾priced goods and services place a limit on what domestic competitors can charge for compa￾rable goods and services. Thus, foreign competition substitutes for domestic competition to 
maintain a lower rate of inflation than might have been the case without imports.
On the other hand, to the extent that lower-priced imports substitute for domestic pro￾duction and employment, gross domestic product will be lower as the balance on the current 
account falls with rising imports.
3.4 Trade Balances and Exchange Rates
A country’s import and export of goods and services are affected by changes in exchange 
rates. The transmission mechanism is in principle quite simple: changes in exchange rates 
change relative prices of imports and exports, and changing prices in turn result in changes 
in quantities demanded through the price elasticity of demand. Although the theory seems 
straightforward, real global business is more complex.
Trade and Devaluation
Countries occasionally devalue their own currencies as a result of persistent and sizable trade 
deficits. Many countries in the not-so-distant past have intentionally devalued their currencies 
in an effort to make their exports more price-competitive on world markets. These competi￾tive devaluations are often considered self-destructive, however, as they also make imports 
relatively more expensive. So what is the logic and likely result of intentionally devaluing the 
domestic currency to improve the trade balance?
The J-Curve Adjustment Path
International economic analysis characterizes the trade balance adjustment process as occur￾ring in three stages: (1) the currency contract period, (2) the pass-through period, and (3) the 
quantity adjustment period. These three stages are illustrated in Exhibit 3.6. Assuming that 
the trade balance is already in deficit prior to the devaluation, a devaluation at time t1 results 
initially in a further deterioration in the trade balance before an eventual improvement. The 
path of adjustment, as shown, takes on the shape of a flattened “j.”
In the first period, the currency contract period, a sudden unexpected devaluation of 
the domestic currency has a somewhat uncertain impact, simply because all of the contracts 
for exports and imports are already in effect. Firms operating under these agreements are 
required to fulfill their obligations, regardless of whether they profit or suffer losses. Assume 
that the United States experienced a sudden fall in the value of the U.S. dollar. Most exports 
were priced in U.S. dollars but most imports were contracts denominated in foreign currency. 
The result of a sudden depreciation would be an increase in the size of the trade deficit at 
time t2 because the cost to U.S. importers of paying their import bills would rise as they spent 
more dollars to buy the foreign currency they needed, while the revenues earned by U.S. 
exporters would remain unchanged. There is little reason, however, to believe that most U.S. 
imports are denominated in foreign currency and most exports in dollars.
The second period of the trade balance adjustment process is termed the pass-through 
period. As exchange rates change, importers and exporters eventually must pass these ex￾change rate changes through to their own product prices. For example, a foreign producer 
selling to the U.S. market after a major fall in the value of the U.S. dollar will have to cover 
its own domestic costs of production. This need will require the firm to charge higher dollar 
M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 94 08/05/23 9:31 AMCHAPTER 3 The Balance of Payments 95
prices in order to earn its own local currency in large enough quantities. The firm must raise 
its prices in the U.S. market. U.S. import prices then rise, eventually passing the full exchange 
rate changes through to prices. Similarly, the U.S. export prices are now cheaper compared to 
foreign competitors’ because the dollar is cheaper. Unfortunately for U.S. exporters, many of 
the inputs for their final products may actually be imported, dampening the positive impact 
of the fall of the dollar.
The third and final period, the quantity adjustment period, achieves the balance of trade 
adjustment that is expected from a domestic currency devaluation or depreciation. As the 
import and export prices change as a result of the pass-through period, consumers both in 
the United States and in the U.S. export markets adjust their demands to the new prices. 
Imports are relatively more expensive; therefore the quantity demanded decreases. Exports 
are relatively cheaper; therefore the quantity demanded increases. The balance of trade—the 
expenditures on exports less the expenditures on imports—improves.
Unfortunately, these three adjustment periods do not occur overnight. Countries like the 
U.S. that have experienced major exchange rate changes have also seen this adjustment take 
place over a prolonged period. Empirical studies have concluded that for industrial countries, 
the total time elapsing between time t1 and t2 can vary from 3 to 12 months. To complicate the 
process, new exchange rate changes often occur before the adjustment is completed.
Trade Balance Adjustment Path: The Equation
A country’s trade balance is essentially the net of import and export revenues, where 
each is a multiple of price—Px
$
 and Pm
fc
 —the prices of exports and imports, respectively. 
Export prices are assumed to be denominated in U.S. dollars, and import prices are de￾nominated in foreign currency. The quantity of exports and the quantity of imports are de￾noted as Qx andQm, respectively. Import expenditures are then expressed in U.S. dollars by

If export products are predominantly priced and invoiced in domestic currency and imports are predominantly priced and invoiced
in foreign currency, a sudden devaluation of the domestic currency can possibly result—initially—in a deterioration of the balance 
on trade. After exchange rate changes are passed through to product prices, and markets have time to respond to price changes 
by altering market demands, the trade balance will improve. The currency contract period may last from three to six months, with 
pass-through and quantity adjustment following for an additional three to six months.

multiplying the foreign currency denominated expenditures by the spot exchange rate S$ = fc
.
The U.S. trade balance, expressed in U.S. dollars, is then expressed as follows:
U.S.TradeBalance = (P$
x * Qx) - (S$ = fc * Pfc
M * QM)
The immediate impact of a devaluation of the domestic currency is to increase the value 
of the spot exchange rate S$ = fc
 resulting in an immediate deterioration in the trade balance 
(currency contract period). Only after a period in which the current contracts have matured, 
and new prices reflecting partial to full pass-through of the exchange rate change, will im￾provement in the trade balance be evident (pass-through period). In the final stage, in which 
the price elasticity of demand has time to take effect (quantity adjustment period), is the 
actual trade balance expected to rise above where it started in Exhibit 3.6. Regardless, trade 
adjustment takes time, an issue of some recent question, as discussed in Global Finance in 
Practice 3.3.
3.5 Capital Mobility
The degree to which capital moves freely cross-border is critically important to a country’s 
balance of payments. We have already seen how the U.S. has suffered a deficit in its current 
account balance over the past 20 years while running a surplus in the financial account and 
how China has enjoyed a surplus in both the current and financial accounts over the last 
decade. But these are only two country cases and may not reflect the challenges for many 
countries, particularly smaller ones or emerging markets.
Current Account versus Financial Account Capital Flows
Capital inflows can contribute significantly to an economy’s development. Capital inflows 
can increase the availability of capital for new projects, new infrastructure development, and 
productivity improvements. These, in turn, may stimulate general economic growth and job 
creation. For domestic holders of capital, the ability to invest outside the domestic economy 
may reap greater investment returns, portfolio diversification, and extend the commercial 
development of domestic enterprises.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 3.3
the specific product can be highly price inelastic. This inelas￾ticity can arise from contractual conditions (as described in 
J-curve theory) or from the lack of appropriate and available 
substitutes. Clearly as global supply chains have grown in 
depth and breadth, many firms rely on very specialized sup￾pliers, suppliers who have designed components and parts 
that are not replaceable in the open market.
Regardless of the specific case, it does appear that as 
economies have grown increasingly integrated across value 
chains, the ability of exchange rate changes to alter actual 
trade flows—imports and exports—has become increasingly 
moot.
Do Trade Flows No Longer Follow the Theory?
Two major currency movements in recent years, the fall of the 
British pound after the June 2016 Brexit vote and the appre￾ciation of the Swiss franc in the first six months of 2017, have 
led many market analysts to question the ability of exchange 
rates to alter trade flows. In both cases, a major change in the 
country’s exchange rate on world markets should—at least 
eventually—alter imports and exports. In both cases, how￾ever, there has been little change that can be traced to ex￾change rate changes.
There are a number of possible explanations. In many 
cases, regardless of changes in effective price, demand for 
M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 96 08/05/23 9:31 AMCHAPTER 3 The Balance of Payments 97
That said, the free flow of capital into and out of an economy can potentially destabilize 
economic activity. Although the benefits of free capital flows have been known for centuries, 
so have the negatives. For this very reason, the creators of the Bretton Woods system were 
very careful to promote and require the free movement of capital for current account trans￾actions—foreign exchange, bank deposits, money market instruments—but they did not re￾quire such free transit for capital account transactions—foreign direct investment and equity 
investments.
Experience has shown that current account-related capital flows can be more volatile, 
with capital flowing into and out of an economy and a currency on the basis of short-term 
interest rate differentials and exchange rate expectations. This volatility is somewhat com￾partmentalized, not directly impacting real asset investments, employment, or long-term eco￾nomic growth. Longer-term capital flows reflect more fundamental economic expectations, 
including growth prospects and perceptions of political stability.
The complexity of issues, however, is apparent when you consider the plight of many 
emerging market countries. Recall the impossible trinity from Chapter 2—the theoretical 
structure that states that no country can simultaneously maintain a fixed exchange rate, 
allow complete capital mobility (both in and out of the country), and conduct independent 
monetary policy. Many emerging market countries have continued to develop by main￾taining a near-fixed (soft peg) exchange rate regime—a strictly independent monetary 
policy—while restricting capital inflows and outflows. With the growth of current account 
business activity (exports and imports of goods and services), more current account￾related capital flows are deregulated. If, however, the country experiences significant vol￾atility in these short-term capital movements, capital flows potentially impacting either 
exchange rate pegs or monetary policy objectives, authorities are often quick to reinstitute 
capital controls.
The growth in capital openness over the past 30 years resulted in a significant increase 
in political pressures for more countries to open up more of their financial account sectors 
to international capital. But the devastation of the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997–1998 
brought much of that to a halt. Smaller economies, no matter how successful their growth 
and development may have been under export-oriented trade strategies, found themselves 
still subject to sudden and destructive capital outflows in times of economic crisis and 
financial contagion.
Historical Patterns of Capital Mobility
Before leaving our discussion of the balance of payments, we need to gain additional insights 
into the history of capital mobility and the contribution of capital outflows—capital flight—
to balance of payments crises. Has capital always been free to move in and out of a country? 
Definitely not. The ability of foreign investors to own property, buy businesses, or purchase 
stocks and bonds in other countries has been controversial.
Exhibit 3.7, first introduced in Chapter 2, provides a way of categorizing historical eras of 
capital mobility over the last 150 years. The exhibit divides economic history into five distinct 
exchange rate eras and their associated implications for capital mobility (or lack thereof). 
These exchange rate eras obviously reflect the exchange rate regimes we discussed and de￾tailed in Chapter 2 but also reflect the evolution of political economy beliefs and policies of 
both industrialized and emerging market nations over this period.
Classical Gold Standard (1870–1914). Although an era of growing capital openness in 
which trade and capital began to flow more freely, it was an era dominated by industrialized 
nation economies that were dependent on gold convertibility to maintain confidence in the 
system.
M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 97 08/05/23 9:31 AM98 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
Interwar Years (1923–1938). This was an era of retrenchment in which major economic 
powers returned to policies of isolationism and protectionism, thereby restricting trade and 
nearly eliminating capital mobility. The devastating results included financial crisis, a global 
depression, and rising international political and economic disputes that drove nations into a 
second world war.
Fixed Exchange Rates (1944–1973). The dollar-based fixed exchange rate system under 
Bretton Woods gave rise to a long period of economic recovery and growing openness of 
both international trade and capital flows into and out of countries. Many believe it was the 
rapid growth in the speed and volume of capital flows that ultimately led to the failure of 
Bretton Woods—global capital could no longer be held in check.
Floating Exchange Rates (1973–1997). The Floating Era saw the rise of a growing 
schism between the industrialized and emerging market nations. The industrialized nations 
(primary currencies) moved to—or were driven to—floating exchange rates by capital mobil￾ity. The emerging markets (secondary currencies), in an attempt to both promote economic 
development and maintain control over their economies and currencies, opened trade but 
maintained restrictions on capital flows. Despite these restrictions, the era ended with the 
onslaught of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
The Emerging Era (1997–Present). The emerging economies, led by China and India, at￾tempt to gradually open their markets to global capital. But, as the impossible trinity taught 
the industrial nations in previous years, the increasing mobility of capital now requires that 
they give up either the ability to manage their currency values or to conduct independent 
monetary policies. The most challenging dimension in this current era is that a number of 
emerging market currencies are now being buffered by the magnitude of noncurrent account 
capital flows—termed portfolio capital or “hot money” flows—and their currencies now suf￾fer larger swings in appreciation or depreciation as capital flows grow in magnitude.
The 2008–2014 period reinforced what some call the double-edged sword of global 
capital movements. The credit crisis of 2008–2009, beginning in the United States, quickly

spread to the global economy, pulling down industrial and emerging market economies alike. 
But in the post credit crisis period, global capital now flowed toward the emerging markets. 
Although this capital both funded and fueled their rapid economic recoveries, it came—in 
the words of one journalist—“with luggage.” The increasing pressure on emerging market 
currencies to appreciate is partially undermining their export competitiveness. But then, just 
as suddenly as the capital came, it went. In late 2013, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that 
it would be slowing money supply growth and allowing U.S. interest rates to rise. Capital once 
again moved; this time out of the emerging markets and into the more traditional industrial 
countries like the U.S. and Europe.
Capital Controls
A capital control is any restriction that limits or alters the rate or direction of capital move￾ment into or out of a country. Capital controls may take many forms, sometimes dictating 
which parties may undertake which types of capital transactions for which purposes—the 
who, what, when, where, and why of investment.
It is in many ways the bias of the journalistic and academic press that believes that capital 
has been able to move freely across boundaries. Free movement of capital into and out of a 
country is more the exception than the rule. The United States has been relatively open to 
capital inflows and outflows for many years, while China has been one of the most closed 
over that same period. When it comes to moving capital, the world is full of requirements, 
restrictions, taxes, and documentation approvals.
There is a spectrum of motivations for capital controls, with most associated with either 
insulating the domestic monetary and financial economy from outside markets or political 
motivations over ownership and access interests. As illustrated in Exhibit 3.8, capital controls 
are just as likely to occur over capital inflows as they are over capital outflows. Although 
there is a tendency for a negative connotation to accompany capital controls (possibly the 
word “control” itself), the impossible trinity requires that capital flows be controlled if a 
country wishes to maintain a fixed exchange rate and an independent monetary policy.
Capital controls may take a variety of forms that mirror restrictions on trade. They may 
simply be a tax on a specific transaction, they may limit the quantity or magnitude of specific 
capital transactions, or they may prohibit transactions altogether. The controls themselves 
have tended to follow the basic dichotomy of the balance of payments current account trans￾actions versus financial account transactions.
In some cases capital controls are intended to stop or thwart capital outflows and cur￾rency devaluation or depreciation. The case of Malaysia during the Asian Crisis of 1997–
1998 is one example. As the Malaysian currency came under attack and capital started to 
leave the Malaysian economy, the government imposed capital controls to stop short-term 
capital movements, in or out, but not hinder nor restrict long-term inward investment. All 
trade-related requests for access to foreign exchange were granted, allowing current account￾related capital flows to continue. But access to foreign exchange for inward or outward money 
market or capital market investments was restricted. Foreign residents wishing to invest in 
Malaysian assets—real assets not financial assets—had open access.
Capital controls can be implemented in the opposite case, in which the primary fear is 
that large rapid capital inflows will both cause currency appreciation (and therefore harm 
export competitiveness) and complicate monetary policy (capital inflows flooding money 
markets and bank deposits). Chile in the 1990s provides an example. Newfound political 
and economic soundness started attracting international capital. The Chilean government 
responded with its encaje program, which imposed taxes and restrictions on short-term 
M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 99 08/05/23 9:31 AM100 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
(less than one year) capital inflows, as well as restrictions on the ability of domestic 
financial institutions to extend credits or loans in foreign currency. Although credited with 
achieving its goals of maintaining domestic monetary policy and preventing a rapid appre￾ciation in the Chilean peso, this program came at substantial cost to Chilean firms, particu￾larly smaller ones.
A similar use of capital controls to prevent domestic currency appreciation is the 
so-called case of Dutch Disease. With the rapid growth of the natural gas industry in the 
Netherlands in the 1970s, there was growing fear that massive capital inflows would drive 
up the demand for the Dutch guilder and cause a substantial currency appreciation. A 
more expensive guilder would harm other Dutch manufacturing industries, causing them 
to decline relative to the natural resource industry. This is a challenge faced by a number of

resource-rich economies of relatively modest size and with relatively small export sectors in 
recent years, including oil and gas development in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Nigeria, to 
name but a few.
An extreme problem that has arisen a number of times in international financial history 
is capital flight, one of the problems that capital controls are designed to counter. Although 
defining capital flight is a bit difficult, the most common definition is the rapid outflow of 
capital in opposition to or in fear of domestic political and economic conditions and policies. 
Although it is not limited to heavily indebted countries, the rapid and sometimes illegal trans￾fer of convertible currencies out of a country poses significant economic and political prob￾lems. Many heavily indebted countries have suffered significant capital flight, compounding 
their problems of debt service.
A variety of mechanisms are used for moving money from one country to another, 
some legal, some not. Transfers via the usual international payments mechanisms (regular 
bank transfers) are obviously the easiest and lowest cost, and are legal. Most economically 
healthy countries allow free exchange of their currencies, but of course for such countries 
capital flight is not a problem. The opposite, transfer of physical currency by bearer (the 
proverbial smuggling out of cash in the false bottom of a suitcase) is more costly and, for 
transfers out of many countries, illegal. Such transfers may be deemed illegal for balance 
of payments reasons or to make difficult the movement of money from the drug trade or 
other illegal activities.
And there are other more creative solutions. One is to move cash via collectibles or pre￾cious metals, which are then transferred across borders. Money laundering is the cross-border 
purchase of assets that are managed in a way that hides the movement of money and own￾ership. And finally, false invoicing of international trade transactions occurs when capital is 
moved through the under-invoicing of exports or the over-invoicing of imports, where the 
difference between the invoiced amount and the actual agreed upon payment is deposited in 
banking institutions in a country of choice. Or as illustrated in Global Finance in Practice 3.4, 
sometimes the best barrier may be good old-fashioned bureaucracy.

a state agency in charge of macroeconomic planning for 
China as a whole. If these applications are approved, a 
third application is then filed with the State Administration 
of Foreign Exchange, which must approve the exchange 
of Chinese renminbi for foreign exchange—typically U.S. 
dollars—to conduct the transaction.
Recently, as a result of growing concern of capital flight 
from the Chinese economy, many applications went into the 
system with no response. They were not denied, but they 
also were not approved. This “capital limbo” resulted in the 
failure of several planned acquisitions, from mining operations 
in Australia to movie studio purchases in Hollywood. In 2018 
a new set of Chinese capital restrictions was applied to the 
increasing use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency invest￾ments to seemingly bypass Chinese capital controls.
Chinese Regulatory Bureaucracy as a Capital 
Control
Chinese investment outside China—by private entities—
has grown so rapidly in recent years that it has raised con￾cerns within the Chinese government that the capital was 
not in pursuit of attractive foreign investments but rather 
fleeing the Chinese economy and its associated regulatory 
constraints.
A Chinese firm wishing to invest abroad must go through

Globalization of Capital Flows
Notwithstanding these benefits, many EMEs [emerging market economies] are concerned 
that the recent surge in capital inflows could cause problems for their economies. Many of 
the flows are perceived to be temporary, reflecting interest rate differentials, which may be 
at least partially reversed when policy interest rates in advanced economies return to more 
normal levels. Against this backdrop, capital controls are again in the news.
A concern has been that massive inflows can lead to exchange rate overshooting (or 
merely strong appreciations that significantly complicate economic management) or in￾flate asset price bubbles, which can amplify financial fragility and crisis risk. More broadly, 
following the crisis, policymakers are again reconsidering the view that unfettered capital 
flows are a fundamentally benign phenomenon and that all financial flows are the result 
of rational investing/borrowing/lending decisions. Concerns that foreign investors may be 
subject to herd behavior, and suffer from excessive optimism, have grown stronger; and 
even when flows are fundamentally sound, it is recognized that they may contribute to col￾lateral damage, including bubbles and asset booms and busts.
 —“Capital Inflows: The Role of Controls,” Jonathan D. Ostry, Atish R. Ghosh, 
Karl Habermeier, Marcos Chamon, Mahvash S. Qureshi, and Dennis B.S. Reinhardt, 
IMF Staff Position Note, SPN/10/04, February 19, 2010, p. 3.
Traditionally, the primary concern over capital inflows is that they are short-term in duration, 
may flow out with short notice, and are characteristics of the politically and economically 
unstable emerging markets. But as described in the preceding quote, two of the largest capital 
flow crises in recent years have occurred within the largest, most highly developed, mature 
capital markets—the United States and Western Europe.
In both the 2008 global credit crisis, which had the United States as its core, and the ensu￾ing European sovereign debt crisis, crisis befell markets that have long been considered some 
of the most mature, the most sophisticated, and the “safest.” Much of the world is now waiting 
to see what capital will do in the years following the 2020 global pandemic.
Summary Points
■ The BOP is the summary statement—a cash 
flow statement—of all international trans￾actions between one country and all other 
countries over a period of time, typically a 
year.
■ The two sub-accounts of the BOP that re￾ceive the most attention are the current 
account and the financial account. These 
accounts summarize the current trade and 
international capital flows of the country, 
respectively.
■ The current account and financial account 
are typically inverse on balance, one in sur￾plus and the other in deficit. Until very re￾cently, though, China has been consistently 
enjoying a surplus of both.
■ Monitoring the various sub-accounts of a 
country’s BOP activity is helpful to decision 
makers and policymakers—in all levels of 
government and industry—in detecting the 
underlying trends and movements of funda￾mental economic forces driving a country’s 
international economic activity.
■ Changes in exchange rates affect relative 
prices of imports and exports, and changing 
prices in turn result in changes in quantities 
demanded through the price elasticity of 
demand.
■ A devaluation results initially in a further 
deterioration of the trade balance before an 
eventual improvement—the path of adjust￾ment taking on the shape of a flattened “j.”
■ The ability of capital to move instantaneously 
and massively cross-border has been one of 
the major factors in the severity of recent cur￾rency crises. In cases such as Malaysia in 1997 
M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 102 08/05/23 9:31 AMCHAPTER 3 The Balance of Payments 103
and Argentina in 2001, the national governments con￾cluded that they had no choice but to impose drastic 
restrictions on the ability of capital to flow.
■ Although not limited to heavily indebted countries, 
the rapid and sometimes illegal transfer of convertible 
currencies out of a country poses significant economic 
problems. Many heavily indebted countries have suf￾fered significant capital flight, which has compounded 
their problems of debt service.
MINI-CASE 
Global Remittances–Contributions 
of the Invisible1
Some 200m expatriate workers worldwide help four 
times as many relatives meet basic needs, set up busi￾nesses or pay school fees. These flows, on average, 
make up 60% of recipients’ family income; in the eight 
largest receiving countries, they are the sole source of 
cash for about a fifth of households. – “Trickles of Gold: 
Covid-19 Has Squeezed Migrants’ Remittances to Their 
Families,” The Economist, June 15, 2020.
Global remittances are one of the most invisible of in￾ternational capital flows. In addition to providing critical 
income to recipients, estimated at one person in nine glob￾ally, they make up a growing proportion of GDP for many 
countries. COVID-19, however, posed a massive threat to 
this lifeblood cash flow.
According to the IMF, remittances are interna￾tional transfers of funds sent by migrant workers from 
the country where they are working to people, typically 
family members, in the country from which they origi￾nated. A migrant is defined as a person who comes to a 
country and stays or intends to stay for a year or more. 
Because these workers are often transitory, employed in 
extremely low-wage industries, and not entitled to many 
public services in host countries, the workers themselves 
are often labeled “invisible.” But the cash flow these 
migrants generate and remit to their home countries is 
large and in many cases critical to the health and well￾being of the recipients. That income is largely channeled 
to critical human service needs like rent, food, utilities, 
and health care.
The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), 
which is responsible for the compilation and reporting 
of U.S. balance of payments statistics, classifies migrant 
remittances as “current transfers” in the current account. 
Wider definitions of remittances may also include capital 
assets that migrants take with them to host countries and 
similar assets that migrants bring back with them to their 
home countries. These values, when compiled, are gener￾ally reported under the capital account of the balance of 
payments.
Determining exactly who is a migrant is also an area 
of some debate. For example, an expatriate (expat) work￾ing for a multinational organization but who is not consid￾ered a “resident” of that country may also be considered 
to be sending global remittances under current transfers in 
the current account.
Remittance Magnitudes
Remittance cash flows have been growing rapidly over the 
past two decades, reaching more than $700 billion globally 
in 2020. Remittances in 2020, after originally expected to 
drop by more than 20% as a result of the COVID-19-in￾duced global recession, eventually recovered to near-2019 
levels. Low-income and middle-income countries are the 
major recipients of remittances, averaging 75% of all in￾flows. And as illustrated also in Exhibit A, the two larg￾est regions, East Asia/Pacific and South Asia, continue to 
grow. For countries in these regions, remittances follow 
historical patterns of migrant worker employment.
The scale of this capital contribution to these econo￾mies borders on unbelievable. Global remittances now 
surpass the capital inflows to low- and middle-income 
countries arising from foreign direct investment (FDI), 
portfolio investment, and official assistance. The contri￾bution of remittances to economic development in many 
of these countries cannot be overstated. And it’s not only 
about magnitude; they are also more stable from year to 
year than either FDI or portfolio capital. This resilience 
became apparent once again in 2020.
Exhibit B provides some insight into how important 
remittance inflows are to a multitude of countries. In 2020 
remittances made up 37.7% of Tonga’s GDP, followed by So￾malia (35.3%), Lebanon (32.9%), South Sudan (29.5%) and 
the Kyrgyz Republic (29.4%), all proceeds from remittance 
of income earned by citizens of these countries laboring in 
other countries. The largest recipients on a dollar basis are 
India ($83 bn), China ($60 bn), Mexico ($43 bn), the Philip￾pines ($35 bn), and Egypt ($35 bn), some of the world’s larg￾est contributors to the world’s 250 million migrant workforce.

See “World Bank Predicts Sharpest Decline of Remittances in Recent History,” press release, 4/22/2020, and “Trickles of Gold; Covid-19 
Has Squeezed Migrants’ Remittances to Their Families,” The Economist, June 15, 2020.
Remittances are analyzed by corridors, the bilateral 
links between sending and receiving country. Exhibit C 
lists the top 10 corridors for 2019. The United States is 
clearly the largest sending country (host), totaling nearly 
$104 billion for the year. The U.S.-Mexico corridor is, not 
surprisingly, the largest in the world by far. Other major 
corridors reflect long-standing guest worker institutional 
structures, such as the UAW-India and Saudi Arabia-India. 
Other major corridors reflect long-standing political link￾ages such as Hong Kong-China and Russia-Ukraine.
Remittance resilience has long been known, but the 
strength shown in 2020 was remarkable. Immediately fol￾lowing the onset of COVID-19, all authorities, from the 
World Bank to the United Nations, warned that remit￾tances would likely drop more than 20% for the year.2
With falling economic output, jobs, wages, combined with 
barriers to travel and migration, prospects were thought 
quite grim. COVID was immediately followed by the col￾lapse of global oil prices, the driver of economic activity in 
a number of the countries playing host to so many migrant 
workers. The projected 20% fall appeared an underesti￾mate. It proved to not be the case. Global remittances in 
2020 dropped only to $702 billion from the previous year’s 
$719 billion, a fall of only 2.4%. What analysts had not es￾timated was the ability of migrants to leverage unknown 
savings and resourceful income supplements to maintain 
their contributions to home-country recipients.
Means of Payment
Given the development impact of remittance flows, we 
will facilitate a more efficient transfer and improved 
use of remittances and enhance cooperation between 
national and international organizations, in order to 
implement the recommendations of the 2007 Berlin 
G8 Conference and of the Global Remittances Work￾ing Group established in 2009 and coordinated by the 
World Bank. We will aim to make financial services 
more accessible to migrants and to those who receive 
remittances in the developing world. We will work to 
achieve in particular the objective of a reduction of the 
global average costs of transferring remittances from 
the present 10% to 5% in five years through enhanced 
information, transparency, competition and coopera￾tion with partners, generating a significant net increase 
in income for migrants and their families in the devel￾oping world. —The G8 Final Declaration on Responsible 
Leadership for a Sustainable Future, paragraph 134.
Reducing remittance payment costs has been the subject 
of major efforts by the World Bank, United Nations, and 
G8 for years. A typical remittance transaction takes place 
in three steps: (1) migrant earner pays the remittance to 
the sending agent using cash, check, money order, credit 
card, debit card, or a debit instruction sent by e-mail or 
phone; (2) sending agent instructs its corresponding agent 
in the recipient’s country to deliver the funds; and (3) pay￾ing agent makes the payment to the final recipient. The 
problem is that despite all efforts, global payment costs 
averaged 6.75% in 2020, still relatively high.
The costs of a remittance transaction include a fee 
charged by the sending agent, typically paid by the sender, 
and a currency-conversion fee for delivery of local cur￾rency to the beneficiary in another country. Some smaller

M03_EITE5960_16_GE_C03.indd 105 08/05/23 9:31 AM106 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
money transfer operators require the beneficiary to pay a 
fee to collect remittances, presumably to account for unex￾pected exchange-rate movements. In addition, remittance 
agents (especially banks) may earn an indirect fee in the 
form of interest (or “float”) by investing funds before de￾livering them to the beneficiary. The float can be signifi￾cant in countries where overnight interest rates are high.
The G8 countries launched an initiative in 2008 ti￾tled 5 * 5 to reduce transfer costs from a global average 
of 10% to 5% in five years. The World Bank supported 
this initiative by creating Remittance Prices Worldwide 
(RPW), a global database to monitor remittance price ac￾tivity across geographic regions. It was hoped that, through 
greater transparency and access to transfer cost informa￾tion, market forces would drive down these costs. The pro￾gram fell significantly short of its goal of 5%.
Although fee structures differ, most transactions are 
charged a fixed fee per transaction and a fee calculated 
as a percentage of the value of the transaction. This lat￾ter component increases the returns to the transfer agents 
considerably. It should also be noted that these are charg￾es imposed upon the sender, at the origin. Other fees or 
charges may occur to the receiver at the point of desti￾nation. It is also obvious from survey data that fees and 
charges may differ dramatically across institutions. Hence 
the objective of the program—to provide more informa￾tion that is publicly available to people remitting funds 
thereby adding transparency to the process—is clear. 
Exhibit D provides an overview of cost estimates for 
the fourth quarter of 2020. It appears the 5% goal is still 
largely in the future.
Innovation and Digitalization
Remittances flow through a variety of service providers, 
including commercial banks, money transfer operators 
(MTOs), and post offices. According to the World Bank, 
commercial banks continue to be the most costly, with 
MTOs generally being the cheapest.
Financial technologies—fintech—theoretically should 
find this growth market segment promising. The problem, 
however, is the existing institutions already in place—
primarily commercial banking systems. This poses two major 
barriers. First, many migrants do not have bank accounts in 
the countries in which they are working. This is a result of 
a variety of barriers including cost, government restrictions 
and regulations, and current business practices. Secondly, 
commercial banks have aggressively worked to protect their 
market segments, in some countries openly opposing online 
payment services like PayPal (e.g., India, the largest receiving 
country) as they cut into segments and profitability. Crypto￾currencies, once thought to offer promise in this arena, have 
proven unsuccessful for a variety of reasons including access, 
comfort by senders, and opposition by governments.
But COVID-19 and market economics are hard to de￾feat. A number of digital payments providers saw signifi￾cant growth in their volume of transactions in 2020, as the 
needs of recipients were accentuated with the global pan￾demic. Most of this growth was in the major industrialized 
countries that are hosts to many migrant workers—the 
United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States—but 
also hosts to some of the more developed and established 
online payments providers.
In Mexico, for example, remittances now make up the 
second largest source of foreign exchange earnings, second 
only to oil exports. The Mexican government has increasingly 
viewed remittances as an integral component of its balance 
of payments and, in some ways, a “plug” to replace declining 
export competition and dropping foreign direct investment. 
But there is also growing evidence that remittances flow to 
those who need them most, the lowest-income component 
of the Mexican population, and therefore mitigate poverty 
and support consumer spending. Former Mexican President 
Vicente Fox was quoted as saying that Mexico’s workers in 
other countries remitting income home to Mexico are “he￾roes.” Mexico’s own statistical agencies also disagree on the 
size of the funds remittances received as well as to whom the 
income is returning (family or non-family interests).

Global business is conducted by many different types of organizations for many different pur￾poses. Although it may appear at times that global business is dominated by the publicly traded 
corporation and for the sole purpose of profit, these are characteristic of only select companies, 
countries, and markets, and the global marketplace is much more diverse and complex.
This chapter explores the different forms of business organizations used today around the 
world, their governance and goals, and ultimately their ability to pursue sustainability. We begin 
our discussion by deepening our understanding of ownership, the legal construct so often as￾sociated with global business, the corporation, and then ultimately the roles and responsibilities 
of corporations by and for their major stakeholders. The chapter concludes with an examina￾tion of the 2021 turmoil surrounding Toshiba’s failing corporate governance, a classic example 
of how difficult it is to change corporate governance practices in established corporate cultures.
Financial Goals, Corporate 
Governance, and the Market 
for Corporate Control
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
4.1 Examine the different ownership structures for businesses globally and how this 
impacts the separation between ownership and management—the agency problem
4.2 Compare and contrast the two dominant theories of the corporate purpose, 
shareholder capitalism and stakeholder capitalism, in an era of growing concern 
over environmental, social and governance issues
4.3 Consider the differences in corporate governance regimes globally, including their 
ability to allow the market for corporate control to evaluate and discipline corporate 
performance
4.4 Explore the market for corporate control, the global marketplace for merging or 
acquiring control over corporate resources, and the multitude of strategies and 
tactics used to both effect and defend against hostile acquisitions.
A Corporation then, or a body politic, or body incorporate, is a collection of many in￾dividuals united into one body, under a special denomination, having perpetual succes￾sion under an artificial form, and vested, by policy of the law, with the capacity of acting, 
in several respects, as an individual, particularly of taking and granting property, of 
contracting obligations, and of suing and being sued, of enjoying privileges and immu￾nities in common, and of exercising a variety of political rights, more or less extensive, 
according to the design of its institution, or the powers conferred upon it, either at the 
time of its creation, or at any subsequent period of its existence.

4. 1 Business Ownership 
 We begin our discussion of corporate financial goals by asking two basic questions: (1) Who 
owns the business? and (2) Do the owners of the business manage the business themselves? 
In global business today, the ownership and control of organizations vary dramatically across 
countries and cultures. To understand how and why those businesses operate, one must first 
understand the many different ownership structures. 
 Types of Ownership 
 The terminology associated with the ownership of a business can be confusing. A busi￾ness owned by a government, the state, is frequently described as a public enterprise or a 
state-owned enterprise (SOE). A business that is owned by a private individual is a private 
company or private enterprise . If you were the owner of your own company, you would pos￾sess the full rights of ownership. You would set the strategic direction of the company, make 
all financial decisions, and ultimately receive any profits generated from the conduct of the 
business. 
 A second distinction on ownership clouds the terminology. A business owned by a pri￾vate party, or a small group of private individuals, a private enterprise, is termed privately 
held . If those owners, however, wish to sell a portion of their ownership in the business in 
the capital markets—for example, by listing and trading the company’s shares on a stock 
exchange—the firm’s shares are then said to be publicly traded . And in the world today there 
are a multitude of hybrid ownership structures that could alter the financial objectives of the 
firms. Exhibit 4. 1 provides a brief overview of these ownership distinctions. 
 Ownership can be held by a variety of different groups or organizations. A business may 
be owned by a single person (sole proprietorship), two or more people (partnership), a family

(family-owned business), two or more other companies (joint venture), thousands of indi￾viduals (publicly traded company), a government (state-owned enterprise), a foundation or 
trust (not-for-profit organization), or some combination.
The following three multinational enterprises are examples of how ownership differs in 
global business, as well as how it may evolve within any single enterprise over time.
■ Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras, is the national oil company of Brazil. Founded in 
1953, it was originally 100% owned by the Brazilian government—a state-owned enter￾prise. It eventually became publicly traded on the Sao Paulo stock exchange. Today the 
Brazilian government owns 64% of the shares of Petrobras, with 36% in the hands of 
private investors all over the world.
■ Apple was founded in 1976 as a partnership of Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ron￾ald Wayne and incorporated in 1977, with Ronald Wayne selling his interest to his two 
partners. In 1980, Apple sold shares to the public for the first time in an initial public of￾fering (IPO), with its shares listed (traded) on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Today Apple 
is considered widely held, with no single investor holding 5% of its shares. In recent years, 
Apple has periodically been the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, as calcu￾lated by market capitalization (shares outstanding multiplied by the share price).
■ Hermès International is a French multinational producer of luxury goods. Founded by 
Thierry Hermès in 1837, it has been owned and operated by the Hermès family for most 
of its history, making it a family-owned business. In 1993, in its initial public offering, the 
company sold 27% of its ownership to the general public. The family, however, retained 
73% ownership and therefore control of the company.
Once the ownership of the business is established, it is then easier to understand where 
control lies, as ownership and control are separate concepts. Petrobras is a publicly traded 
Brazilian business that is controlled by the Brazilian government. Hermès International is 
a publicly traded family-controlled French-based business. Apple is a publicly traded and 
widely held business, so control rests with its board of directors and the senior leadership 
team hired by the board to run the company. Individual investors who hold shares in Apple 
may vote on issues presented to them on an annual basis, so they have some degree of influ￾ence, but the strategy, tactics, operations, and governance of Apple are under the control of 
the senior management team and the board.
Any business, whether initially owned by the state, a family, or a private individual or in￾stitution, may choose to have a portion of its ownership traded as shares in the public market￾place, as noted in Exhibit 4.1. (Note that we say a portion, as a 100% publicly traded firm can 
no longer be either state-owned or privately held by definition.) For example, many SOEs 
are publicly traded. China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the state-owned parent 
company of PetroChina, is an example, with its shares being traded on stock exchanges in 
Shanghai, Hong Kong, and New York, yet majority ownership and control still rest with the 
government of China.
If a firm’s owners decide to sell a portion of the company to the public, it conducts an ini￾tial public offering, or IPO. Typically only a small percentage of the company is initially sold 
to the public, anywhere from 10% to 20%, resulting in a company that may still be controlled 
by a small number of private investors, a family, or a government, but now with a portion of 
its shares traded publicly. Over time a company may gradually sell more of its equity interest 
into the public market, eventually becoming totally publicly traded.
Alternatively, a private owner or family may choose to retain a major share but may not re￾tain control. It is also possible for the controlling interest in a firm to reverse its public share po￾sition, reducing the number of shares outstanding by repurchasing shares. The acquisition of one 
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 113 02/05/23 4:56 PM114 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
firm by another demonstrates yet another way ownership and control can change. For example, 
in 2005 a very large private firm, Koch Industries (U.S.), purchased all outstanding shares of 
Georgia-Pacific (U.S.), a very large publicly traded company. Koch took Georgia-Pacific private.
Even if a firm is publicly traded, it may still be controlled by a single investor or by a 
small group of investors, including major institutional investors. This means that the control 
of a publicly traded company is much like that of a privately held company, reflecting the 
interests and goals of the controlling individual investor or family. A continuing character￾istic of many businesses operating in emerging markets is the dominance of family control, 
although many are simultaneously publicly traded.
As discussed later in this chapter, there is another significant implication of an initial 
sale of shares to the public: The firm becomes subject to many of the increased legal, regula￾tory, and reporting requirements related to the sale and trading of securities. In the U.S., for 
example, going public means the firm must disclose a sizable degree of financial and opera￾tional detail, publish this information at least quarterly, and comply with all the rules and 
regulations of the SEC and exchange on which its shares are traded. In most countries, firms 
which are privately held do not have to publish detailed financial and operating results.
The Corporation
A corporation is an organization, typically a group of people or companies, recognized legally 
by the state to act as a single entity. This is often described as a legal person. As a legal person, 
the corporation has many of the same rights and attributes of individuals, with some ben￾eficial restrictions. The corporation can enter into contracts, take out loans, sue and be sued, 
and purchase or sell assets. Corporations are formed when individuals exchange some form 
of consideration, typically cash, in exchange for a financial interest—the interest entitling 
the shareholder to a portion of any profits. A very important benefit of the corporate form is 
that shareholders have limited liability, that is, they may only lose financially what they have 
invested. They do not, however, have personal liability. This feature is often seen as an incen￾tive for shareholders to undertake greater risks. Global Finance in Practice 4.1 traces some of 
the corporation’s history.
The corporate form poses a number of complexities. First, shareholders are financial in￾vestors, not truly owners in the traditional sense of the word. Shareholders are not privy to 
the internal workings of the firm. They cannot sign contracts on behalf of the firm. They can￾not purchase or sell assets on behalf of the firm. As financial investors and not operators, they 
are primarily interested in financial returns. The second complexity is one that is, well, more 
esoteric. The corporation is a legal person, an artificial person, not an actual person. This has 
led to a recurring debate over whether the corporation has social interests or a conscience or 
whether it is purely an organization for financial profit.
Separation of Ownership and Management
One of the most challenging issues in the financial management of the corporation or enter￾prise is the possible separation of ownership from management. Hired or professional man￾agement may be present under any ownership structure, though most common in SOEs and 
publicly traded companies. This separation of ownership from management raises the pos￾sibility that the two entities may have different business and financial objectives and—from a 
purely financial perspective—different risk tolerances or appetites. This is the so-called prin￾cipal agent problem or simply the agency problem. Describing the problem in 1972, Jensen 
and Meckling used the words of Adam Smith to introduce it:1

 “Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs, and Ownership Structure,” by Michael C. Jensen and 
William H. Meckling, Journal of Financial Economics 3 (1976): 305–360.
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 114 02/05/23 4:56 PMCHAPTER 4 Financial Goals, Corporate Governance, and the Market for Corporate Control 115
The directors of such [joint-stock] companies, however, being the managers rather of other 
people’s money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it 
with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently 
watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to 
small matters as not for their master’s honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensa￾tion from having it. Negligence and profusion, there- fore, must always prevail, more or less, 
in the management of the affairs of such a company.
—Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, 1776, Cannan Edition (Modern Library, New York, 1937) p. 722.
There are a multitude of examples of how this agency issue may be demonstrated. Management, 
for example, is hired as an agent of the shareholder to represent the shareholder’s interests. 
Shareholders, benefiting from the corporate form, are interested in the firm, via its managers, 
taking significant risks in search of profits. Managers, however, dependent on the continuing 
operation of the corporation for their livelihood, may be reluctant to take excessive risk. This 
disconnect between shareholder and management-agent is at the core of the publicly traded 
firm. There are, however, several strategies available for aligning shareholder and management 
interests, the most common of which is for senior management to own shares or share options.
The United States and United Kingdom are two country markets characterized by wide￾spread ownership of shares. Managers may own some small portion of stock in their firms, 
but largely management is a hired agent that is expected to represent the interests of share￾holders. In contrast, many firms in many other global markets are characterized by control￾ling shareholders, such as government, institutions (e.g., banks in Germany), family (e.g., in 
France and Italy and throughout Asia and Latin America), and consortiums of interests (e.g., 
keiretsus in Japan and chaebols in South Korea). A business that is owned and managed by 
the same entity does not suffer the agency problem. In many of these cases, control is en￾hanced by ownership of shares with dual voting rights, interlocking directorates, staggered 
election of the board of directors, takeover safeguards, and other techniques that are not used 
in the Anglo-American markets.
Ownership in the publicly traded corporation differs dramatically across countries today. 
Substantial and sometimes controlling interests are held by private individuals or entities, 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 4.1 
by granting monopolies to these groups, such as the English 
East India Company; only the East India Company could con￾duct trade with India. This reduced the business risk associ￾ated with the organization’s ventures, assuring higher rates of 
return. The company was originally formed as a combination 
of a guild (a member-based organization) and a joint stock 
company (a form of partnership). In its combination its share￾holders were described as “members” and “owners” arising 
from their original organizations. Profits were distributed on 
the basis of capital invested.
The economic development and the direction of govern￾ment policy is often intertwined with the dominant corpora￾tions in a country. For example, Samsung Group’s growth 
in South Korea was shaped by the government’s policy to 
develop self-reliance in consumer electronics production. 
It soon grew to be a key player in financial and IT services 
and many other industrial sectors. This group exerts signifi￾cant influence in the government policymaking and is strate￾gically important for the economy.
Historical Origins of the Modern 
Corporation
The corporate form has many historical antecedents. In the 
eleventh century, a system in Italy, the commenda, combined 
a financial partner (passive partner) with a merchant vessel 
(managing partner). When the vessel concluded its voyage 
with goods for sale, the partners divided up the profits by 
contract. The financial partner could lose no more than its 
investment; the managing partner—investing only their time 
and effort—assumed the majority of the nonfinancial risks. 
This was followed by groups of investors who combined or 
pooled their capital, spreading out the risks across multiple 
vessels and voyages—an early form of diversification.
The development of the joint stock company in Britain 
in the 1600s followed a similar structure. Groups of investors 
pooled their capital to undertake risky ventures, ventures re￾quiring more capital and effort than individual investors could 
bear. The Crown reduced the risks with such efforts further 
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 115 02/05/23 4:56 PM116 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
government enterprises, a widely dispersed public ownership, or fund-based institutions. 
These ownership differences are explored in detail by global region in Global Finance in 
Practice 4.2.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 4.2 
significant in China, other emerging Asia nations, and 
emerging markets in general. This ownership occurs 
through three primary channels: direct ownership, pen￾sion fund ownership and control, and sovereign wealth 
funds. Although government only controls 14% of global 
stock market capitalization, its ownership in these three 
key regional sectors is notable, as these owners have 
significant political as well as business interests, either 
through direct government ownership or through sov￾ereign wealth funds, public pension funds, and state￾owned enterprises.
■ Third, strategic individuals—private individuals with signif￾icant ownership—are one of the most influential but “hid￾den” sources of control and influence. The OECD notes 
that in half of the world’s publicly listed companies the 
top three strategic individuals control more than 50% of 
the capital. A topic for further study, this concentration of 
power may lead to a reduction in agency issues as these 
individuals exert influence on management but simulta￾neously potentially represent a tyranny of the minority in 
their control of the publicly traded company.

Series, OECD, Paris, 2019.
Structural Ownership Differences Across 
the World
Ownership of any organization drives purpose and process. 
For example, a private owner—for example, a family—is typi￾cally interested in both financial returns and organizational 
longevity, whereas an individual private owner of a publicly 
traded share is focused on financial returns, both dividends 
and capital gains. A recent OECD study on global patterns 
revealed substantial differences across the world.
The OECD noted three areas of interest and concern 
over the data results.
■ First, there is an obvious dominance of institutional own￾ership in both the United States and other advanced 
industrial economies. Institutional investors hold 41% 
of global market capitalization, a significant hold on the 
world’s capital. If these large institutional investors act

 Management of multinational not-for-profit organizations, issue-driven organizations (like benefit or B corps), 
and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) follows many of these same fundamental business practices.
4.2 The Corporate Objective?
What is the purpose of the corporation? The purpose of the corporation might be first de￾fined as “to run a business.” That business is in turn a system of mission, vision, and strategy. 
Depending on your field of study and perspective, the purpose of the corporation may be to 
enrich customers, provide jobs, generate wealth for shareholders, create value for stakehold￾ers, or increase the welfare of society.2
 The financial objective of the firm, of specific interest 
to us in the field of financial management, might then be viewed as the metric of performance 
in the conduct of that business.
Companies today, whether domestic firms or multinational enterprises, are in the midst 
of a growing debate as to whom the corporation specifically serves. That is a question central 
to finance and financial metrics of performance. Assuming a market economy and a focus 
on for-profit organizations, the two most widely accepted forms of capitalism practiced in 
global business over the past 50 years are shareholder capitalism and stakeholder capitalism.

Exhibit 4.2 provides a stakeholder map of the corporation.
A stakeholder is any entity with an interest or right or concern with an organization and 
its activities. In the modern corporation, the firm in Exhibit 4.2, the direct stakeholders are 
those entities with a vested financial interest in the firm’s success. Direct stakeholders can 
be subdivided into business stakeholders (suppliers and customers), internal stakeholders 
(employees and management), and financial stakeholders (equity investors and creditors). 
Indirect stakeholders are those which are impacted in some way by the firm’s activities and 
include but are not limited to community, government, civil society, and the environment. 
Direct or indirect, each entity has its own interest or expectation of the firm’s activities.

Every student today learns the concept of maximizing shareholder wealth sometime dur￾ing their college education. This means that if a firm is pursuing shareholder capitalism, the 
firm’s primary objective is to create value for shareholders in Exhibit 4.2. It does not mean 
that the other stakeholders are not important; it only directs the firm to consider sharehold￾ers first. If a firm is following stakeholder capitalism, it must find an operating balance among 
direct stakeholders and ultimately also consider indirect stakeholders as well. Balance is an 
exceedingly difficult concept to achieve, however, as we will explore in the practice of global 
financial management. Historically, an overly simplistic description of the world was the fol￾lowing: Anglo-American markets followed shareholder capitalism, the rest of the world pur￾suing some form of stakeholder capitalism. But as with so many aspects of life and business, it 
is a bit more complicated than that today!
Shareholder Capitalism
A business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stock￾holders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end. The discretion of 
directors is to be exercised in the choice of means to attain that end, and does not extend 
to a change in the end itself, to the reduction of profits, or to the non-distribution of profits 
among stockholders in order to devote them to other purposes.
—Michigan State Supreme Court, Dodge v. Ford Motor Company, 1991.
The Anglo-American markets have a philosophy that a firm’s objective should follow share￾holder capitalism, also frequently termed shareholder wealth maximization (SWM). More 
specifically, the firm should strive to maximize the financial returns to shareholders, as mea￾sured by the sum of capital gains and dividends, for a given level of risk. Alternatively, the 
firm should minimize the risk to shareholders for a given rate of return and do so in prefer￾ence to the interests and returns to all other stakeholders of the firm.
Market Efficiency. The SWM theoretical model assumes, as a universal truth, that the stock 
market is efficient. This means that the share price is always correct because it captures all the 
expectations of return and risk as perceived by investors. It quickly incorporates new infor￾mation into the share price. Share prices, in turn, are deemed the best allocators of capital in 
the macro economy.
Risk. The SWM model also treats its definition of risk as a universal truth. Risk is defined 
as the added probability of varying returns that the firm’s shares bring to a diversified port￾folio. The operational risk, the risk associated with the business line of the individual firm, 
can be eliminated through portfolio diversification by investors. Therefore, the unsystematic 
risk, the risk of the individual security, should not be a prime concern for management unless 
it increases the possibility of bankruptcy. On the other hand, systematic risk, the risk of the 
market in general, cannot be eliminated through portfolio diversification and is risk that the 
share price will be a function of the stock market.
Agency Theory. The field of agency theory is the study of how shareholders can mo￾tivate management to accept the prescriptions of the SWM model. For example, liberal 
use of stock options should encourage management to think like shareholders. Whether 
these inducements succeed is open to debate. However, if management deviates from the 
SWM objectives of working to maximize shareholder returns, then it is the responsibility 
of the board to replace management. In cases where the board is too weak or ingrown 
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 118 02/05/23 4:56 PMCHAPTER 4 Financial Goals, Corporate Governance, and the Market for Corporate Control 119
to take this action, the discipline of equity markets could do it through a takeover. This 
discipline is made possible by the one-share-one-vote rule that exists in most Anglo￾American markets.
Long-Term versus Short-Term Value Maximization. During the 1990s, the economic 
boom and rising stock prices in most of the world’s markets exposed a flaw in the SWM 
model, especially in the United States. Instead of seeking long-term value maximization, 
several large U.S. corporations sought short-term value maximization (e.g., the continuing 
debate about meeting the market’s expected quarterly earnings). This strategy was partly 
motivated by the overly generous use of stock options to motivate top management.
This short-term focus sometimes created distorted managerial incentives. In order to 
maximize growth in short-term earnings and to meet inflated expectations by investors, firms 
such as Enron, Global Crossing, Health South, Adelphia, Tyco, Parmalat, and WorldCom un￾dertook risky, deceptive, and sometimes dishonest practices for the recording of earnings 
and/or obfuscation of liabilities, which ultimately led to their demise. It also led to highly 
visible prosecutions of their CEOs, CFOs, accounting firms, and other related parties. This 
sometimes destructive short-term focus on the part of both management and investors has 
been labeled impatient capitalism.
This point of debate is also sometimes referred to as the firm’s investment horizon in 
reference to how long it takes the firm’s actions, its investments and operations, to result in 
earnings. In contrast to impatient capitalism is patient capitalism, which focuses on long-term 
shareholder wealth maximization. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, through his invest￾ment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway, represents one of the best of the patient capitalists. Buffett 
has become a billionaire by focusing his portfolio on mainstream firms that grow slowly but 
steadily with the economy, such as Coca-Cola.
Stakeholder Capitalism
The job of management is to maintain an equitable and working balance among the claims 
of the various directly interested groups . . . stockholders, employees, customers, and the 
public at large.
—Frank W. Abrams, Chairman, Standard Oil of New Jersey, 1951.
In the non-Anglo-American markets, controlling shareholders also strive to maximize 
long-term returns to equity. However, they are more constrained by other powerful stake￾holders. In particular, outside the Anglo-American markets, labor unions are more powerful 
and governments interfere more in the marketplace to protect important stakeholder groups, 
such as local communities, the environment, and employment. In addition, banks and other 
financial institutions are more important creditors than securities markets. This model has 
been labeled the stakeholder capitalism (SCM).
Market Efficiency. Stakeholder capitalism does not assume that equity markets are ei￾ther efficient or inefficient. In fact, it does not really matter because the firm’s financial 
goals are not exclusively shareholder-oriented since they are constrained by the other 
stakeholders. In any case, the SCM model assumes that long-term “loyal” shareholders, 
typically controlling shareholders, should influence corporate strategy rather than the tran￾sient portfolio investor.
Risk. The SCM model assumes that total risk, that is, operating risk, does count. It is a spe￾cific corporate objective to generate growing earnings and dividends over the long run with 
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 119 02/05/23 4:56 PM120 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
as much certainty as possible, given the firm’s mission statement and goals. Risk measure￾ment is based more on product market variability than on short-term variation in earnings 
and share price.
Single versus Multiple Goals. Although the SCM model typically avoids a flaw of the 
SWM model—impatient capital that is short-run oriented—it has its own flaw. Trying to 
meet the desires of multiple stakeholders leaves management without a clear signal about 
the trade-offs. Instead, management tries to influence the trade-offs through written and oral 
disclosures and complex compensation systems.
The Scorecard. In contrast to the SCM model, the SWM model requires a single goal of 
value maximization with a well-defined scorecard. According to the theoretical model of 
SWM, the objective of management is to maximize the total market value of the firm. This 
means that corporate leadership should be willing to spend or invest more if each additional 
dollar creates more than one dollar in the market value of the company’s equity, debt, or any 
other contingent claims on the firm.
Although both models have their strengths and weaknesses and in many ways they may 
not be too different in practice, a number of events and trends have renewed the debate.
■ In the 1990s, as more of the non-Anglo-American markets privatized their industries, 
a shareholder wealth focus was seemingly needed to attract international capital from 
outside investors, many of which were from other countries.
■ The global financial crisis, 2008–2010, demonstrated the major income and employ￾ment inequalities in market economies. Civil society called out for organizations, 
corporations, to facilitate societal change. Stakeholder capitalism appeared a more 
promising path.
■ Since 2010, the world's focus has increasingly turned toward environmental (e.g., climate 
change) and social (e.g., the global income and employment inequities accentuated by 
the global pandemic of 2020) concerns, concerns seemingly more aligned with stake￾holder capitalism.
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns are today an everyday topic in 
global business, one that has in some ways returned to its roots. Shareholder capitalists argue 
that the corporation is not a real human and has no specific conscience or social value judg￾ments. Only the leaders of the publicly traded firm are humans, and many believe it is not 
appropriate for those leaders to impose their own values on the corporation itself. Their ar￾gument is that in the process of maximizing value for the shareholder, the entire pie is en￾larged for all stakeholders. In the extreme, shareholder capitalists recite the words of Milton 
Friedman, a Nobel prize–winning champion of free markets:4
There is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its resources and engage 
in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, 
which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.
Stakeholder capitalists see these issues in a different way. They argue the corporation is 
a legal person and is obligated to benefit all of its stakeholders, including society, and not just 
shareholders. In recent years stakeholder capitalism has gained a number of victories in the 
debate, winning over a multitude of leaders in both government and industry. The investing

public has played a major role in this resurgence, as green investing flowed toward firms 
considered ESG friendly. In 2020, the World Economic Forum came out in support of stake￾holder capitalism, as described in Global Finance in Practice 4.3.
Operational Goals
The management objective of maximizing profit is not as simple as it sounds because the 
measure of profit used by ownership/management differs between the private firm and the 
publicly traded firm. In other words, is management attempting to maximize current income, 
capital appreciation as in a share price, or both?
Returns to Investors in Publicly Traded Firms. The return to a shareholder in a publicly 
traded firm combines current income in the form of dividends and capital gains from the 
appreciation of share price:
Shareholder return = D2
P1
+
P2 - P1
P1
where the initial price, P1, is the beginning price, the initial investment by the shareholder; 
P2, is the price of the share at the end of period, and D2 is the dividend paid at the end of 
period.
Shareholders reap financial returns from both components. For example, in the United 
States in the 1990s, a diversified investor may have received an average annual return 
of 14%, 2% from dividends and 12% from capital gains. This “split” between dividend 
and capital gain returns, however, differs dramatically across the world’s major markets 
over time.
Management generally believes it has the most direct influence over the first com￾ponent—the dividend yield. Management makes strategic and operational decisions that 
grow sales and generate profits. Then it distributes those profits to ownership in the form 
of dividends. Capital gains—the change in the share price as traded in the equity mar￾kets—is much more complex and reflects many forces that are not under management 
control. Despite growing market share, profits, or any other traditional measure of busi￾ness success, the market may not reward these actions directly with share price apprecia￾tion. In the end, leadership in the publicly traded firm typically concludes that it is its own 
growth—growth in top-line sales and bottom-line profits—that is its greatest hope for 
driving share price upward.

Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics: The Four Ps
The World Economic Forum (WEF) believes that if businesses 
are to thrive, companies need to enhance their license to op￾erate through greater commitment to long-term, sustainable 
value creation. The WEF believes there are four themes—the 
4Ps—that make up good governance, each theme possess￾ing core metrics in its reporting on performance against envi￾ronmental, social, and governance (ESG) indicators.

M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 121 02/05/23 4:56 PM122 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
The Case of Apple. In March 2012, Apple announced it would end a 17-year period of no 
dividend payments. This was followed by a similarly shocking announcement in April 2013 
that it would raise nearly $17 billion in debt, although the company had an enormous cash 
balance. Both financial policy changes were surprising to the market and uncommon in the 
tech sector. One way to understand the financial policy change is to consider whether Apple 
had grown and evolved from a growth firm to a value firm.
Growth firms are small to medium-sized firms in the early rapid growth stages of their 
businesses. Their value is growing rapidly in the public markets, their share prices rising, 
creating substantial capital gains for their shareholders. At the same time, since they are 
in such rapid growth stages, they need all the capital they can get their hands on, so, argu￾ably, they need the dividend cash flow more than their shareholders. Although they could 
raise debt during this stage, debt is often viewed as an obligation that slows the ability 
of corporate leadership to respond quickly to changing customer and technology market 
demands.
Value firms are large, more mature businesses, which find it increasingly difficult to 
create material value changes in their business. Once an Alibaba or Amazon gets so large, 
major new business developments and successes rarely change the company’s financial 
earnings and results significantly. Share price movements become slower and more subtle 
over time. Yet such companies continue to generate massive amounts of cash flow and 
earnings. For these firms, activist investors like Carl Icahn may pressure management to 
take on more and more debt and pay out greater and greater dividends. The debt requires 
corporate management to stay sharp in keeping up debt service obligations, while the divi￾dend distributions provide added and sometimes significant returns to shareholders who 
are seeing capital appreciation slowing or stagnating.
In Apple’s case, there is an additional issue driving its financial policy change: U.S. taxes. 
Although the company held massive cash balances, this cash was largely offshore—outside 
the United States—and would result in large tax obligations if the cash was returned to the 
U.S. Apple, not wishing to increase its tax liabilities, chose instead to issue debt in order to 
fund the newly declared cash dividends.
Returns to Owners of Privately Held Firms. A privately held firm has a much simpler 
shareholder return objective function: maximize current and sustainable financial income to 
its owners. The privately held firm does not have a share price. (It does have a value, but this 
is not a definitive market-determined value in the way in which we believe markets work.) It 
simply focuses on generating current financial income, dividend income (as well as salaries 
and other forms of income provided owners), to generate returns to its ownership.
If the privately held ownership is a family, the family may also place a great emphasis 
on the ability to sustain those earnings over time while maintaining a slower rate of growth, 
which can be managed by the family itself. Without a share price, “growth” is not of the same 
strategic importance in the privately held firm. It is therefore critical that ownership and 
ownership’s specific financial interests be understood from the very start if we are to under￾stand the strategic and financial goals and objectives of management.
The privately held firm may also be less aggressive (take fewer risks) than the publicly 
traded firm. Without a public share price, and therefore the ability of outside investors to 
speculate on the risks and returns associated with company business developments, the pri￾vately held firm—its owners and operators—may choose to take fewer risks. This may mean 
that it will not attempt to grow sales and profits as rapidly and therefore may not require 
the capital (equity and debt) needed for rapid growth. A recent study by McKinsey, one 
of the world’s foremost consulting firms, found that privately held firms consistently used 
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 122 02/05/23 4:56 PMCHAPTER 4 Financial Goals, Corporate Governance, and the Market for Corporate Control 123
significantly lower levels of debt (averaging 5% less debt to equity) than publicly traded 
firms. Interestingly, these same private firms also enjoyed a lower cost of debt, roughly 
30 basis points lower based on corporate bond issuances. Exhibit 4.3 provides an overview of 
the variety of distinctive financial and managerial differences between state-owned, publicly 
traded, and privately held firms.
Operational Goals for MNEs. The MNE must be guided by operational goals suitable for 
various levels of the firm. Even if the firm’s goal is to maximize shareholder value, the man￾ner in which investors value the firm is not always obvious to the firm’s top management. 
Therefore, most firms hope to receive a favorable investor response to the achievement of 
operational goals that can be controlled by the way in which the firm performs and then 
hope—if we can use that term—that the market will reward their results. The MNE must de￾termine the proper balance between three common operational financial objectives:
1. Maximization of consolidated after-tax income
2. Minimization of the firm’s effective global tax burden
3. Correct positioning of the firm’s income, cash flows, and available funds as to country 
and currency
These goals are frequently incompatible, in that the pursuit of one may result in a less 
desirable outcome of another. Management must make decisions daily in business about the 
proper trade-offs between goals (which is why companies are managed by people and not 
computers).
Consolidated Profits. The primary operational goal of the MNE is to maximize consolidated 
profits after-tax. Consolidated profits are the profits of all the individual units of the firm, all 
of its foreign branches and subsidiaries. And all foreign subsidiaries have their own set of local 
currency financial statements needed for incorporation and tax obligations. The MNE must 
combine all of their financial results, originating in many different currencies, for reporting in

the currency of the parent, as seen in the case of Aidan in Chapter 1. This is not to say that man￾agement is not striving to maximize the present value of all future cash flows. It is simply the 
case that most of the day-to-day decision-making in global management is about current earn￾ings. The leaders of the MNE, the management team who are implementing the firm’s strategy, 
must think far beyond current earnings.
Public/Private Hybrids. The global business environment is, as one analyst termed it, “a 
messy place,” and the ownership of companies of all kinds, including MNEs, is not necessarily 
purely public or purely private. One recent study of global business found that fully one-third 
of all companies in the S&P 500 are technically family businesses. And this is not just the case 
for the U.S.; roughly 40% of the largest firms in France and Germany are heavily influenced 
by family ownership and leadership. In other words, the firm may be publicly traded, but a 
family still wields substantial power over the strategic and operational decisions of the firm. 
This may prove to be a good thing.
Activist Investors
One of the most dramatic developments globally in the corporate governance of the publicly 
traded firm has been the development and activities of activist investors. Activist investors, 
when unhappy with the way the publicly traded company is being led, try to induce change 
in the strategy and financial management of the firm. This is a radical departure from the 
traditional passive investor who, if dissatisfied, simply sold their shares and exited. The activ￾ists themselves have become personalities of size in global media—Carl Icahn, Nelson Peltz, 
William Ackerman, Daniel Loeb, Paul Singer, among others—and they and their hedge fund 
capital firms have influenced publicly traded firms across the world including Apple (United 
States), AzkoNobel (Netherlands), Danone (France), ExxonMobil (United States), Google 
(United States), Nestlé (Switzerland), and ThyssenKrupp (Germany).
Activists are shareholders. As illustrated in Exhibit 4.4, activists accumulate anywhere 
between 3% and 10% of the public shares in a target firm. They then work to influence lead￾ership through every means possible—phone calls, published letters and white papers, share￾holder meetings, shareholder votes, board representation—any and all possible means of 
influence. What they want is for the firm to take actions, strategic and/or financial, which will 
increase the financial returns to shareholders.

The activist’s playbook is in most cases fairly standard. The strategic changes advocated 
include cutting costs (including executive compensation), selling off what they consider 
non-core businesses, actively restructuring to reduce global tax obligations, and increasing 
public (investor) debate on firm leadership and its direction. This last element, public de￾bate, usually means putting the company “in play” in which share prices rise through in￾vestor speculation. The financial changes advocated usually include increasing the amount 
of debt in the firm’s capital structure, reducing new investment (both capital expenditures 
and acquisitions), and returning more cash flow to investors through dividends and share 
repurchases.
The contributions of activists, the pros and cons, depend on where an individual sits. If 
you are a member of the leadership team in the target firm, activists are considered disruptive 
outsiders, interested in inducing short-term gains at the expense of long-term value creation. 
If you are an existing shareholder, activists are often welcomed as investors who are willing 
to step up and question established corporate leadership—an advocate for the small or pas￾sive investor. In the end, activists act as more engaged shareholders, taking on a role of a very 
engaged investor. Although they are often accused of promoting short-term thinking in their 
recommendations, they argue that they are advocating prudent policies that protect both cor￾porate and investor interests. Activists in recent years have had a greater and greater impact 
in global markets in forcing change in structure (board membership) and strategy (e.g., oil 
and gas companies investing in renewable energy).
4.3 Corporate Governance
Corporate governance is the system of rules, practices, and processes by which an organization 
is directed and controlled. Although the governance structure of any company—domestic, in￾ternational, or multinational—is fundamental to its very existence, this subject has become 
the lightning rod of political and business debate in the past few years as failures in gover￾nance in a variety of forms have led to corporate fraud and failure. Abuses and failures in 
corporate governance have dominated global business news in recent years. Beginning with 
the accounting fraud and questionable ethics of business conduct at Enron culminating in its 
bankruptcy in the fall of 2001, failures in corporate governance have raised issues about the 
ethics and culture of business conduct for the past 20 years.
The Structure of Governance
Our first challenge is to understand what people mean when they use the expression “cor￾porate governance.” Exhibit 4.5 provides an overview of the various parties and their re￾sponsibilities associated with the governance of a U.S. corporation. The various internal and 
external parties and organizations shown all exert some form of influence over the activities 
of the corporation, either by monitoring, reporting to the market or a regulator, active regu￾lation, or simply valuation—buying and selling of any securities traded in the public market 
associated with the firm.
The internal forces, the officers of the corporation (CEO, CFO, etc.) and the board of 
directors of the corporation (including the chairman of the board), are directly responsible 
for determining both the strategic direction and the execution of the company’s business. But 
they are not acting within a vacuum; the internal forces are subject to the constant prying 
eyes of the external forces in the marketplace that question the validity and soundness of 
the decisions and performance of internal forces. External forces include the equity market 
(stock exchanges) on which the company’s shares are traded, the investment banking ana￾lysts who cover and critique the company shares, the company’s creditors, the credit rating 
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 125 02/05/23 4:56 PM126 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
agencies that assign credit ratings to the company’s debt or equity securities, the auditors and 
legal advisers who testify to the fairness and legality of the company’s financial statements, 
and the multitude of regulators who oversee the company’s actions—all in an attempt to as￾sure the validity of information presented to investors. 
 This web of governance, where many different bodies and organizations constantly observe, 
monitor, and critique the U.S. corporation, is believed to not only provide a discipline to the firm 
but collectively work to protect the investor who places their hard-earned money in the securi￾ties of the firm. Most of the time it works as designed. In others, well, it does not so good. 
 Comparative Corporate Governance 
 The origins of the need for a corporate governance process arise from the separation of own￾ership from management and from the varying views by culture of who the stakeholders are 
and of their significance. This ensures that governance practices will differ across countries 
and cultures. 
 One method to categorize corporate governance regimes is by the evolution of own￾ership. Market-based regimes—like those of the United States, Canada, and the United 
Kingdom—are characterized by relatively efficient capital markets in which the ownership 
of publicly traded companies is widely dispersed. Family-based regimes, like those charac￾terized in many of the emerging markets, Asian markets, and Latin American markets, not 
only started with strong concentrations of family ownership (as opposed to partnerships or 
small investment groups that are not family-based) but have also continued to be largely con￾trolled by families even after going public. Bank-based and government-based regimes are 
those reflecting markets in which government ownership of property and industry has been a

GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 4.4 
One man in particular, Cesare Geronzi, rose to the top of 
Italian finance. And every step of the way, he took three 
scarlet chairs with him. The chairs sat in his waiting room 
at Mediobanca and eventually Generali, Italy’s largest finan￾cial group. Geronzi rose to the pinnacle of power despite 
twice being the target of major financial and accounting fraud 
cases, including Parmalat. Over the following half-century 
anyone wishing to gain influence had to pass through the 
“three chairs,” the salotto buono.
But, alas, the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 
broke down many of the world’s last bastions of private 
power. One such casualty was the salotto buono, as more 
and more of its vested families fell further into debt and 
bankruptcy.
Italian Cross-Shareholding and the End of the 
Salatto Buono
Italy, in the years following World War II, was a country teeter￾ing on collapse. In an effort to stabilize industrial activity, the 
powerful families of the north—the Agnellis (of Fiat fame), the 
Pesentis, the Pirellis, the Ligrestis, and later the Benettons 
formed salotto buono—“the fine drawing room”—to control 
Italian finance, industry, and media through relatively small 
stakes. At the core of the relationship was that each family 
business held significant ownership and control in the other in 
an interlocking or cross-shareholding structure that assured 
that no outsiders could gain ownership or influence.
The creator of salotto buono was Enrico Cuccia, the 
founder of Mediobanca, the Milan-based investment bank. 
constant over time, resulting in only marginal public ownership of enterprise and, even then, 
subject to significant restrictions on business practices.
All exchange rate regimes are therefore a function of at least four major factors in 
the evolution of corporate governance principles and practices globally: (1) the financial 
market development, (2) the degree of separation between management and ownership, 
(3) the concept of disclosure and transparency, and (4) the historical development of the 
legal system.
Financial Market Development. The depth and breadth of capital markets are critical to 
the evolution of corporate governance practices. Country markets that have had relatively 
slow growth, as in the emerging markets, or have industrialized rapidly utilizing neighboring 
capital markets (for example, Western Europe) may not form large public equity market sys￾tems. Without significant public trading of ownership shares, high concentrations of owner￾ship are preserved and few disciplined processes of governance are developed.
Separation of Management and Ownership. In countries and cultures where the own￾ership of the firm has continued to be an integral part of management, agency issues and fail￾ures have been less problematic. Family-based ownership maintains the owner–operator link. 
Family-based regimes are arguably more common and more important worldwide. For ex￾ample, in a study of 5,232 corporations in 13 Western European countries, family-controlled 
firms represented 44% of the sample compared to 37% that were widely held. Global Finance 
in Practice 4.4 describes the family cartel that controlled Italy for nearly 60 years. In coun￾tries like the United States, in which ownership has become largely separated from manage￾ment (and widely dispersed), aligning the goals of management and ownership is much more 
difficult.
Disclosure and Transparency. The extent of disclosure regarding the operations and fi￾nancial results of a company varies dramatically across countries. Disclosure practices reflect 
a wide range of cultural and social forces, including the degree to which ownership is pub￾lic, the degree to which government feels the need to protect investor rights versus owner￾ship rights, and the extent to which family-based and government-based business remains 
central to the culture. Transparency, a parallel concept to disclosure, reflects the visibility of 
decision-making processes within the business organization.
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 127 02/05/23 4:56 PM128 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
Historical Development of the Legal System. Investor protection is typically better in 
countries where English common law is the basis of the legal system, compared to the codi￾fied civil law that is typical in France and Germany (the so-called Code Napoleon). English 
common law is typically the basis of the legal systems in the United Kingdom and former col￾onies of the United Kingdom, including the United States and Canada. The Code Napoleon 
is typically the basis of the legal systems in former French colonies and the European coun￾tries that Napoleon once ruled, such as Belgium, Spain, and Italy. In countries with weak 
investor protection, controlling shareholder ownership is often a substitute for a lack of legal 
protection.
A second—simpler—way of categorizing governance regimes is on the basis of whether 
they are driven by forces from within, insider regimes, or by forces from without, outsider or 
market-based regimes. Exhibit 4.6 provides a detailed description of key components across 
representative countries.
Despite all of the rules, regulations, and regimes, corporate governance failures still 
occur. Although the Enron scandal in the U.S. is one of the most well known, it is in no way 
EXHIBIT 4.6 Insider versus Outsider Corporate Governance
Dimension Insider Regimes Outsider Regimes
Example Countries Germany, Japan United States, United Kingdom
Share Ownership Concentrated. Share ownership concentrated 
among insiders who often exert some control 
over corporate management.
Widely distributed. Significant separation of 
ownership and management, although among 
the larger firms management may hold sizeable 
shares.
Control Insider relationship-based control. Strong 
family-based ownership or cross-shareholdings 
among companies, including banks in some 
cases, ensure a concentrated control of the 
organization.
Management control (agency issues). Public 
shareholders are so widely dispersed that few 
have significant influence, “ownership vacuum,” 
giving management more power. This has cre￾ated opportunities for activist investors to gain 
power and influence.
Market for Corporate Control Hostile takeovers are rare. Hostile takeovers 
are rare as a result of legal barriers and cross￾shareholding relationships with other companies 
and banking institutions. This prevents the 
equity market from acting as a disciplinarian of 
management.
Hostile takeovers are common. Hostile take￾overs are common as a result of few institutional 
or legal barriers to market-based offerings. 
Financial institutions often back and fund hostile 
takeovers rather than opposing them. Equity 
markets act as managerial disciplinarians.
Government Role Participant role. Government frequently holds 
shares and board seats, actively participating in 
the management and control of the firm.
Non-participant role. Government rarely 
owns or actively participates in the ownership 
or governance of the firm. Its role is typically 
regulatory only.
Board Structure Supervisory board overseeing Manage￾ment board, separation of CEO and chair￾man. Although the number of outside directors 
is growing, many are the results of corporate 
relationships and not true outsiders.
Single board of directors, little separation 
of CEO and chairman. Growing proportion of

Little transparency. Little disclosure of board 
and management compensation.
High degree of transparency. Extensive 
disclosure of compensation systems, including

Minority Shareholder 
Protection
High degree of protection. Minority share￾holder rights are often highly protected, much of 
which also secures power and control of major 
shareholder interests.
Little minority shareholder protection. Mi￾nority shareholders are not afforded significant 
protection. Unhappy shareholders exit, unless 
activists engage.

unique. In addition to Enron, other firms that have revealed major accounting and disclo￾sure failures over time, as well as executive looting, are WorldCom, Parmalat, Tyco, Adelphia, 
and HealthSouth. In each case, prestigious auditing firms missed the violations or minimized 
them, possibly because of lucrative consulting relationships or other conflicts of interest. 
Moreover, security analysts and banks urged investors to buy the shares and debt issues of 
these and other firms that they knew to be highly risky or even close to bankruptcy. Even 
more egregious, most of the top executives who were responsible for the mismanagement 
that destroyed their firms often walked away with huge gains on shares sold before the down￾fall and overly generous severance packages.
The post-2000 period’s experience with financial crisis (2008–2010) and global pandemic 
(2020) has driven more and more of the world’s investors, governments, and societies to ex￾pect better governance. But change is slow, partially because it is steeped in law. Also note 
that we have not mentioned ethics. All of the principles and practices described so far have 
assumed that the individuals in roles of responsibility and leadership pursue them truly and 
fairly—a concept that was evidently not shared by someone, on some level, in Volkswagen, as 
described in Global Finance in Practice 4.5.
Good Governance and Corporate Reputation
Does good corporate governance matter? This is actually a difficult question, and the realistic 
answer has been largely dependent on outcomes historically. For example, as long as Enron’s 
share price continued to rise, questions over transparency, accounting propriety, and even 
financial facts were largely overlooked by all of the stakeholders of the corporation. Yet, 
eventually, the fraud, deceit, and the failure of a multitude of corporate governance practices 
resulted in bankruptcy. It destroyed not only the wealth of investors but also the careers, in￾comes, and savings of many of its own employees. Ultimately, good governance should matter.
One way in which companies may signal good governance to the investor markets is to 
adopt and publicize a fundamental set of governance policies and practices. Nearly all pub￾licly traded firms have adopted this approach, as becomes obvious when visiting corporate 
websites. This has also led to a standardized set of common principles, a consensus on good 
governance practices, led by the OECD.
1. Shareholder rights. Shareholders are the owners of the firm, and their interests should 
take precedence over other stakeholders.
2. Board responsibilities. The board of the company is recognized as the individual entity 
with final full legal responsibility for the firm, including proper oversight of management.
3. Equitable treatment of shareholders. Equitable treatment is specifically targeted to￾ward domestic versus foreign residents as shareholders, as well as majority and minority 
interests.
4. Stakeholder rights. Governance practices should formally acknowledge the interests of 
other stakeholders—employees, creditors, community, and government.
5. Transparency and disclosure. Public and equitable reporting of firm operating and fi￾nancial results and parameters should be done in a timely manner and should be made 
available to all interests equitably.
In principle, the idea is that good governance (at both the country and corporate levels) is 
linked to cost of capital (lower), returns to shareholders (higher), and corporate profitability 
(higher). An added dimension of interest is the role of country governance, as this influences 
the country in which international investors may choose to invest. Frustratingly, different gov￾ernance rankings services often come up with very different rankings for the same firms, and

the power structure of VW. He was known to seek power, 
control, and market dominance, not necessarily profit.
Common to German companies, VW had a two-tiered 
board structure, a supervisory board and a management 
board, as shown in the exhibit. The management board (led by 
the CEO as chairman) operated the company on a daily basis. 
The supervisory board’s job was oversight of the management 
board, with 20 board seats split evenly between shareholder 
interests and the works council (worker union). Under German 
law, the Law of Codetermination (mitbestimmungesetz in 
German), any firm employing more than 2,000 workers had 
to have representatives of both employees and shareholders.
A final element, the government of Lower Saxony’s 
board seats, added to governance complexity. VW had 
been a state-owned enterprise until privatized with the 1960 
Volkswagen Law. The law required that VW’s supervisory 
board always retain two government board seats (an ex￾tremely unusual element by Western standards).
The final result was a supervisory board structure ripe 
with conflicts. Workers wanted higher wages and job secu￾rity, not necessarily profitability. Government interests were 
inherently political and often focused on increasing and sus￾taining employment. Ownership, represented by the two 
families and a single dominant personality, many of which did 
not agree on goals and interests, had pursued market domi￾nance over profitability. Stir in a strong seasoning of what 
was considered a corporate culture of arrogance, and VW’s 
governance was truly a witches’ brew.
Volkswagen’s Governance and Diesel Gate
Volkswagen AG is, periodically, the largest automobile com￾pany in the world. The company’s organizational and gover￾nance structure is typical of large German firms. In September 
2015 the company was discovered to have been utilizing 
software for years that tricked or “defeated” emissions test￾ing technology worldwide. The market value of the firm fell 
by more than 30% within months. Like every corporate gov￾ernance failure in history, the same question begged an an￾swer: How did this happen?
The answer is complicated, combining unethical man￾agement and a governance structure which failed. VW’s 
management culture, called the VW System, functioned via a 
network of deep relationships between management, work￾ers, local politicians, and a frequently torrid family ownership 
structure. Although a global organization, its deep roots in 
Lower Saxony assured corporate longevity by protecting the 
jobs and industrial structure of its constituents.
VW had a dual-class ownership structure of common 
and preferred shares. Preferred shares would receive their 
guaranteed dividend in full before common shares were paid. 
In return for that guarantee, they gave up all voting rights. 
Common shares held all voting rights. The company’s owner￾ship was dominated by two families, the Porsche and Piëch 
families, who held 31.5% of the equity via common shares, 
the dual-class structure increasing their interest to 50.7%. 
One family member, Ferdinand Piëch, had long dominated

to compound the confusion, these governance rankings seem to have little predictive ability of 
good or poor governance—measured by firms’ future likelihood of restating earnings, share￾holder lawsuits, return on assets, and a variety of measures of stock price performance.
4.4 The Market for Corporate Control
... the market for corporate control is best viewed as an arena in which managerial teams 
compete for the rights to manage corporate resources.
—“The Market for Corporate Control: The Scientific Evidence,” by Michael C. Jensen and 
Richard S. Ruback, Journal of Financial Economics 11 (1983), pp. 5–50.
Theoretically, a management team that is underperforming in its direction of a company 
could potentially be replaced by a competitive team under the expectation of superior per￾formance. Or, as in the case of an acquisition—friendly or hostile—the combining of the two 
firms could create value that neither could obtain on its own. These synergies—cost, revenue, 
financial, tax—are the drivers for combining businesses. The process as a whole is called the 
market for corporate control.
This competition is about control, and the control of a publicly traded company could be 
obtained through a takeover or acquisition. Takeovers can be friendly or hostile. A friendly 
takeover is when a bidder works with the leadership of the target firm to arrive at a mutually 
agreed-upon price per share. In principle, both parties would benefit from cooperative nego￾tiations in which detailed information regarding the target firm’s operations was shared, lead￾ing to a more accurate valuation of the target and potentially a higher bid price. The target 
firm’s leadership would then recommend to its shareholders that they support and approve 
the sale. If, however, the target firm’s leadership was not interested in being acquired by the 
bidder, it might not cooperate in information-sharing. If the bidder wished to continue, the 
bidder could announce a public tender offer to shareholders, going around management of 
the target firm—a hostile offer.
Control of the publicly traded corporation may be acquired a variety of ways, and the 
global market for corporate control never ceases to innovate new ones. Regardless of method, 
the objective is the same: to gain control of a sufficient number of votes to dictate corporate 
actions. Exhibit 4.7 provides an overview of various key thresholds in the process of a change 
in corporate control.
Disclosure Threshold. Most countries regulate the purchase and accumulation of shares in 
public equity markets. The most common regulatory requirement is the disclosure threshold. 
An acquiring firm crossing this threshold is required to publicly disclose, often via a formal fil￾ing with a regulatory authority, that it has gained a specific level of voting rights in the target 
firm. This disclosure is powerful, as most investors do not have either access to or interest in ac￾tively monitoring share interests. This public announcement often results in a rise in the target 
firm’s share price as an acquirer’s growing ownership interest may be indicative of an effort to 
gain control. The most common threshold across countries is 5%, although there are exceptions 
(e.g., Canada, 10%; the United Kingdom, 3%). A small number of countries—Spain, Turkey, 
Vietnam—have no threshold and allow accumulation of shares without public disclosure.5
5
 For example, in the U.S., an acquirer surpassing 5% ownership in a publicly traded security has 10 days in which 
to file a Form 13D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In this filing, which is a public record, the 
acquirer must state its shareholdings in the target. Additionally, it must also disclose its intentions behind its share 
acquisition—for a proxy fight, for potential acquisition or merger, or simply as an investment because the target is 
undervalued.

 The case of Vodafone’s (UK) acquisition of Mannesmann (Germany) in 2000 was one example. A few holdout 
shareholders of Mannesmann refused to sell. This required Vodafone to continue to generate Mannesmann man￾agement and financial documents, as well as hold an annual shareholders meeting, for the few—a costly outcome.

EXHIBIT 4.7 Corporate Takeover Thresholds
Mandatory Bid Rule. The second common share accumulation restriction is the manda￾tory bid rule threshold. In many countries an acquirer is required to stop accumulating 
target firm shares at 30% or 33%. This rule requires the acquirer to make a tender offer for 
all or nearly all remaining shares of the target company if it wishes to proceed. The tender 
must also be open to shareholders for a specific period of time or at least until the desired 
number of shares are tendered. This serves as a major barrier to corporate takeovers, pro￾tecting holders of control, including management, as well as minority shareholders. This 
rule also prevents creeping takeovers, in which the acquirer continually accumulates shares 
purchased on the open market until gaining full control of the target firm, a possibility in the 
United States.
An acquirer faced with making a mandatory bid for control may also face a minimum 
price rule, sometimes referred to as a fair price bid. This is a rule that the tender price made 
by the acquirer is at least some minimum price based on the share price of the target firm in 
the period prior to the attempted takeover. Although this appears to be restrictive, it rarely 
proves effective. Most tender offers are made at a premium to the share price of the target 
firm at the point of mandatory bid threshold, itself often a peak share price.
Squeeze-Out/Sell-Out Rights. A squeeze-out right requires that remaining residual 
shareholders tender their shares to an acquirer once the acquirer has reached a specific 
ownership threshold, typically 90%. This is to prevent a few remaining holdout investors 
from imposing undue costs on acquirers completing a takeover.6 Sell-out rights, the dual 
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 132 02/05/23 4:56 PMCHAPTER 4 Financial Goals, Corporate Governance, and the Market for Corporate Control 133
consideration to squeeze-out rights, ensure that residual minority shareholders are offered 
a fair price once control has changed. For example, an acquirer reaching the 90% thresh￾old of voting rights could choose not to purchase the remaining shares outstanding of the 
target, allowing their trading to continue. Sell-out rights guarantee these shareholders a 
fair exit price.
Cross-Border Takeovers and Defenses
Takeovers, whether domestic or cross-border, are regulated by national law, primarily the 
laws of the country of the target firm. Most major industrial countries only established laws 
governing corporate acquisitions over the past 30 years. These legal structures all possessed a 
common objective—to strike a balance between creating an open and efficient marketplace 
for corporate control and the efficient deployment of capital. This was meant to ensure the 
fair treatment of all shareholders, including minority shareholders.
But what of the rights or abilities of management of a target company to defend itself 
against a takeover? The management of a target company normally takes a side—it is rarely 
neutral. If an acquisition or merger is described as benefiting from significant cost syner￾gies (reduction of redundant activities between the two companies), managers of the target 
company will likely be out of a job. The management team of the target may take actions to 
defend itself against takeover—so-called anti-takeover provisions (ATPs).
ATPs generally either change the shares outstanding of the target firm (voting 
power) or change the target firm’s value and risk (financial and business structure). 
Voting power ATPs include multiple classes of stock with varying voting rights or the 
issuance of new shares for intentional dilution. Firm value ATPs include divestment of 
assets, taking on debt, increased dividends and share repurchases, and merging with a 
third party, to name a few. All are intended to make acquiring the target firm more costly 
and more difficult.
Dual Class Stock. A dual class stock is when a company issues differing classes of shares. 
A dual class stock structure can consist of Class A and Class B shares, for example, where one 
class may be entitled to different dividends than the other, different numbers of voting rights 
than the other, or both. A family-based firm may restrict B-shares to family members while 
A-shares are sold to the public. In such a case the B-shares often carry significantly higher 
voting rights than the B-shares, ensuring continued family control.
Poison Pills. Named after the Cold War era’s use of spies and their ability to take a poi￾son pill to avoid interrogation, the concept is to make the target in some way too costly, too 
difficult, or too unattractive for the acquirer. A frequent form is a shareholder rights plan, in 
which the target firm’s bylaws allow the issuance of additional shares to existing shareholders 
in an effort to dilute the voting shares of the acquirer.7
Staggered Boards. Although a corporate board does not own the firm, a change in board 
members might change a hostile takeover into a friendly one. To prevent an acquirer from 
gaining new influence via newly elected board members (typically via a proxy fight), a com￾pany can ensure that its board member terms are staggered. This means that no newly elected 
controlling board composition is attainable at any one time.
7
 The shares are often sold to existing shareholder groups at a discount to expedite successful issuance, termed a 
flip-in poison pill. A less common form is the flip-over poison pill, in which target firm shareholders gain rights to 
acquire shares in the target firm if the takeover is successful; these rights are supported and subsidized by the target 
firm.
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 133 02/05/23 4:56 PM134 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
White Knights. If a target firm’s leadership believes that it may not be able to prevent a 
hostile takeover, a more extreme defense is to merge with another firm, a so-called white 
knight, that it prefers. The white knight will still need to out-bid the hostile acquirer. The 
target helps to support that higher bid price by working cooperatively with the white knight, 
particularly in information sharing. In some cases the cooperation of the target firm’s leader￾ship is in return for business and employment assurances post-acquisition.
Pac-Man Defense. Named after the game, the target firm may itself become the acquirer 
and the acquirer the target. In the earliest stages of a potential hostile takeover, the target 
firm may start buying shares in the bidder company in an effort to start gaining power and in￾fluence. Often in the process of funding these growing share accumulations, the target firm’s 
debt levels begin to rise, making it less desirable as well.
Asset Divestment and Debt. Other defense mechanisms focus on making the target firm 
less desirable. This may include selling off key business lines or assets that are the focus of 
acquirer interest—selling off the most valued assets in the eyes of the acquirer. Similarly, a 
target firm may take on large additional debt obligations to make its acquisition more costly 
and more of a financial burden to the hostile acquirer.
Corporate takeover law differs across countries, including within integrated regional 
structures like the European Union. National laws and interests will ultimately determine 
which of the previously described bidding and defense tactics can legally be employed.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without com￾promising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
—Brundtland Report, 1987, p. 54.
What is the purpose of the corporation? It is increasingly accepted that the purpose of the 
corporation is to certainly create profits and value for its stakeholders, but the responsibility 
of the corporation is to do so in a way that inflicts no costs on the environment and society. 
As a result of globalization, this growing role of the corporation in society has added an ad￾ditional level of complexity not seen before.
The discussion has been somewhat hampered to date by a lot of conflicting terms and 
labels—corporate goodness, corporate responsibility, corporate social responsibility (CSR), 
corporate philanthropy, and corporate sustainability, to list but a few. To simplify, sustainabil￾ity is often described as a goal, while responsibility is an obligation of the corporation. The 
obligation is to pursue profit, social development, and the environment—but to do so along 
sustainable principles.
Nearly two decades ago a number of large corporations began to refine their publicly 
acknowledged corporate objective as “the pursuit of the triple bottom line.” This triple bot￾tom line—profitability, social responsibility, and environmental sustainability—was consid￾ered an enlightened development of modern capitalism. What some critics termed a “softer 
and gentler” form of market capitalism was a growing desire on the part of the corpora￾tion to do something more than simply generate a financial profit. To better understand this 
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 134 02/05/23 4:56 PMCHAPTER 4 Financial Goals, Corporate Governance, and the Market for Corporate Control 135
development of an expanding view of corporate responsibilities, one can divide the argu￾ments along two channels: the economic channel and the moral channel.
The economic channel argues that by pursuing corporate sustainability objectives, the 
corporation is actually still pursuing profitability, but it is doing so with a more intelligent 
longer-term perspective—“enlightened self-interest.” It has realized that a responsible orga￾nization must ensure that its actions over time, whether or not required by law or markets, do 
not reduce future choices. Alternatively, the moral channel argues that the corporation has 
the rights and responsibilities of a citizen, including the moral responsibility to act in the best 
interests of society, regardless of its impacts on profitability. And you thought the manage￾ment of a company was simple!
Summary Points
■ Most commercial enterprises have their origins with either 
entrepreneurs (private enterprise) or governments (public 
enterprise). Regardless of origin, if they remain commer￾cial in focus, they may over time choose to go public (in 
whole or in part) via an initial public offering (IPO).
■ When a firm becomes widely owned, it is typically man￾aged by hired professionals. Professional managers’ inter￾ests may not be aligned with the interests of owners, thus 
creating an agency problem.
■ The Anglo-American markets subscribe to a philosophy 
that a firm’s objective should follow the shareholder wealth 
maximization (SWM) model. More specifically, the firm 
should strive to maximize the return to shareholders, the 
sum of capital gains and dividends, for a given level of risk.
■ As do shareholders in Anglo-American markets, control￾ling shareholders in non-Anglo-American markets strive 
to maximize long-term returns to equity. However, they 
also consider the interests of other stakeholders, including 
employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, government, and 
community. This is known as stakeholder capitalism.
■ The return to a shareholder in a publicly traded firm com￾bines current income in the form of dividends and capi￾tal gains from the appreciation of share price. A privately 
held firm tries to maximize current and sustainable income 
since it has no share price.
■ The MNE must determine for itself the proper balance be￾tween three common operational objectives: maximization 
of consolidated after-tax income; minimization of the firm’s 
effective global tax burden; and correct positioning of the 
firm’s income, cash flows, and available funds as to country 
and currency.
■ The relationship between stakeholders that is 
used to determine the strategic direction and per￾formance of an organization is termed corporate 
governance. Dimensions of corporate governance 
include agency theory; composition and control of 
boards of directors; and cultural, historical and in￾stitutional variables.
■ The market-based contest for mergers, acquisi￾tions, and other forms of combination is called 
the market for corporate control. And depending 
on which countries are involved and what govern￾ing law, mergers and acquisitions may be either 
friendly or hostile.
■ A number of initiatives in corporate governance 
practices in the U.S., the UK, and the European 
Union—including board structure and com￾pensation, transparency, auditing, and minority 
shareholder rights—are spreading to many other 
countries today including major emerging market 
countries.
■ A variety of defensive strategies and tactics are 
employed by firms in the market for corporate 
control to entice or repel potential corporate ac￾quirers. Defensive tactics may include acquisition, 
divestment, changing levels of debt, or changes to 
the firm’s financial policies.
■ Society’s growing interest and concern over issues 
related to environment, societal impact, and open 
and fair governance have led to a growing debate 
and exploration of corporate responsibility and 
sustainability.

corporate governance reforms, including the adoption of 
a new corporate governance code, came about. A core 
element in Japan’s new corporate governance code was 
General Principle 1, emphasizing equal treatment of all 
shareholders and their rights, including both minority 
and foreign shareholders. Toshiba was now charged with 
breaking General Principle 1.
Leadership and Investor Change
Japan has long been evolving a “hybrid form of gover￾nance” that seeks to balance shareholders’ focus on per￾formance and management’s concern for stakeholders.9
Corporate governance in Japan had historically been seen 
as bank-based and government-aligned. Power and control 
of public companies in Japan were highly concentrated and 
held by the company’s bankers, with complex networks of 
cross-shareholding among firms to protect management’s 
power from shareholders. Even when banks did not directly 
own shares, they still exerted significant influence over 
firms by controlling their access to capital. But decades of 
anemic economic growth and declining corporate value 
had led the country to champion change in corporate gov￾ernance practices to attract international capital. The new 
corporate governance code was symbolic of that change, 
championing the recognition of all shareholder rights, big 
and small, domestic and foreign.
Toshiba was emblematic of that change, as it had 
successfully attracted foreign capital. Following the West￾inghouse subsidiary bankruptcy in 2017, in an effort to 
recapitalize the company, Toshiba had issued 600 billion 
yen in new shares, mostly to foreign investors. The per￾centage of shares held by foreign corporations increased 
overnight from 38% to 72%, foreign investors now hold￾ing the majority. But with that capital came expectations—
expectations of financial performance and shareholder 
engagement. Exhibit A provides a summary of Toshiba’s 
major foreign investors as of 2021.
At this same time, Toshiba moved to secure new lead￾ership, taking the revolutionary step of choosing a new 
CEO from outside its own ranks in 2018, appointing No￾buaki Kurumatani. Kurumatani was recruited from CVC 
Capital Partners, a European private equity firm. He imme￾diately committed to turning Toshiba’s businesses around 
and adopting more open corporate governance practices.
Toshiba’s Failing Corporate 
Governance8
General Principle 1
Companies should take appropriate measures to fully 
secure shareholder rights and develop an environment 
in which shareholders can exercise their rights appro￾priately and effectively. In addition, companies should 
secure effective equal treatment of shareholders. Given 
their particular sensitivities, adequate consideration 
should be given to the issues and concerns of minority 
shareholders and foreign shareholders for the effective 
exercise of shareholder rights and effective equal treat￾ment of shareholders.

the Mid- to Long-Term,” Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc., June 1, 
2018 edition, p. 2.
Toshiba Corporation, Kabushiki gaisha Toshiba, the once 
mighty Japanese industrial conglomerate, a symbol of Jap￾anese technological excellence, had fallen on bad times. 
Still Japan’s largest semiconductor manufacturer and its 
second largest industrial conglomerate, it could not seem 
to steer clear of a series of scandals that had plagued the 
company and its share price for nearly a decade. In 2015, 
the company was rocked by an accounting scandal when 
it was discovered that senior management in the company 
had pressured managers to falsify accounting results. In 
2017, Westinghouse Electric Company, which Toshiba had 
acquired in 2006 at what many considered an inflated price 
of $5.4 billion, slid into bankruptcy. Now in 2021, the com￾pany was once more confronting a corporate governance 
failure, as leadership was charged with working against its 
largest shareholders—foreign shareholders.
The assorted series of scandals and failures were seen 
by some as partly the result of Japan’s insular corporate 
governance, where senior management worked closely 
with government in opposition to competition (particu￾larly foreign firms) and employees were guaranteed life￾time employment in exchange for unwavering support of 
leadership. That older club-like atmosphere, or “shared 
purpose,” was thought to now be changing as a series of

off activist investors clamoring for greater movement and 
openness by corporate leadership. The offer shepherded by 
Kurumatani was purported to be around $20 billion, quite 
low in the eyes of most analysts and investors. On April 14, 
after it was announced that CVC was withdrawing from 
discussions, Kurumatani resigned. His replacement was 
his predecessor, Satoshi Tsunakawa, who had been CEO 
before and was currently chairman of the board.
The Investigator Report
The conclusion at this point is that we let METI beat 
them for a while.
—Excerpt from internal Toshiba e-mail.
The investigation team approved by shareholders was 
made up of three lawyers from outside Toshiba. That team 
saw their charge as the exploration of two basic concerns 
regarding the July 2020 shareholder vote:10
1. Vote counting issue: More than 1,139 voting forms de￾livered to the independent agent (Sumitomo Mitsui 
Trust Bank, administrator of the shareholder vote) for 
counting were excluded.
2. Pressure issue: Many shareholders had not voted as a 
result of pressures by a number of organizations, includ￾ing Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry 
(METI), supporting Toshiba’s leadership team.
The investigators undertook a large-scale exploration 
of the issues, including hundreds of personal interviews and 
Kurumatani, however, had only been on board two 
years when the global pandemic of 2020 pummeled the 
company’s profits. He moved quickly to slash costs and di￾vest a number of businesses and assets. But by the summer 
of 2020’s Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), 
investors had grown frustrated. Toshiba’s largest sharehold￾er, a Singapore-based activist firm, Effissimo Capital Man￾agement, pushed for change, proposing its own slate of new 
board members. But at the July 31, 2020, AGM, Toshiba’s 
shareholders rejected Effissimo’s nominees and reelected 
Kurumatani CEO. It appeared that Toshiba’s leadership 
team had survived the activist challenge.
But in the months that followed, new information 
surfaced regarding the conduct of the previous summer’s 
shareholder vote that called the process into question. 
A number of Toshiba’s major investors, including Effis￾simo, wished to convene a special shareholders’ meeting 
to consider possible irregularities and commission an 
independent investigation. At an extraordinary share￾holder meeting held on March 18, 2021, the Proposal for 
Appointment of Investigators was approved by share￾holders. The vote was seen as a watershed moment in 
Japanese corporate governance. Historically, there had 
been only a handful of cases when a shareholder-spon￾sored initiative had gained shareholder support over the 
opposition of management.
Meanwhile CEO Kurumatani opened negotiations 
with his former employer, CVC Partners, on CVC’s possible 
acquisition of Toshiba. Such a transaction would take one 
of Japan’s premier industrial conglomerates private. Ru￾mors of the possible sale riled many inside Toshiba, as the

M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 137 02/05/23 4:56 PMdiscuss a variety of concerns. One major concern was a series 
of fictitious and circular transactions at a subsidiary, Toshiba 
IT Services. Effissimo was concerned that the internal inves￾tigation of the transactions had been totally inadequate and 
that the root causes of risk management in Toshiba had not 
been addressed. Toshiba’s CEO did respond by conducting 
a series of conference calls with Effissimo but limited the 
company’s interaction with other board members.
A third investor group,  3D, sent a letter to Toshiba 
on April 16 detailing financial performance concerns. 3D 
argued that Toshiba’s total shareholder return (TSR) and 
share price had been “stagnant” since Mr. Kurumatani took 
control. 3D considered the performance of the current man￾agement team “extremely poor,” going on to explain that 
it thought Toshiba’s biggest problem was the conglomerate 
discount, a reduced share value caused by a return on invest￾ed capital (ROIC) below the company’s cost of capital.12
3D believed Toshiba should divest non-core businesses to 
reduce the conglomerate discount. Instead, Toshiba had 
moved to pursue inclusion of more non-core businesses.
detailed digital forensics. At the center of much of the ex￾ploration was the communication between Toshiba and its 
major foreign investors and select government agencies.
Shareholder Communications
A number of the communications between major sharehold￾er groups and Toshiba highlighted not only Toshiba’s failure 
to respond to shareholder questions but in some cases also 
its work to exclude their participation in shared governance.
On March 3, Harvard Management Company (HMC), 
the manager of Harvard University’s endowment, sent a 
letter to Toshiba detailing its concerns over the board’s fail￾ure to respond to the decline in the company’s share price 
(see Exhibit B). HMC wished to see the company under￾take asset sales to support a large-scale share buyback pro￾gram. Toshiba reportedly took more than three months to 
reply to HMC and then only offered to take it under con￾sideration.11 Effissimo, Toshiba’s single largest shareholder, 
repeatedly requested meetings with Toshiba directors to 
11 Share buybacks (share repurchases) are viewed as one of two ways money is returned to shareholders, the other being dividends. The 
objective of share buybacks is to reduce the number of shares outstanding, increasing earnings per share and, hopefully, increasing the 
share price.
12 Many investment experts today believe that capital markets discount conglomerates, assigning them a value that is less than the sum 
of their various parts. The prescription for such discounts is to divest non-core businesses, focusing on core businesses that reflect the 
company’s true expertise and competence.

138 PART 1 Global Financial Environment
M04_EITE5960_16_GE_C04.indd 138 02/05/23 4:56 PMAccording to the above, Toshiba is found to have de￾vised a plan to effectively prevent shareholders from 
exercising their shareholder proposal right and voting 
rights at the AGM by giving undue influence to share￾holders Effissimo, 3D and HMC. Considering the 
importance of shareholders’ right to make proposals 
and exercise their voting rights, and the fact that the 
Corporate Governance Code stipulates that “Given the 
importance of shareholder rights, companies should 
ensure that the exercise of shareholder rights is not 
impeded." . . . The Investigators believe that this AGM 
was not fairly managed.
June Reactions
Following the publication of the investigator report, two 
board members and two other senior executives resigned. 
Toshiba committed to continuing to study the investiga￾tor report and to improve its communication with share￾holders. Despite the turmoil, Toshiba’s Chairman Osamu 
Nagayama announced that he had no intention of resign￾ing. He remained committed to correcting the company’s 
ills. On this same day, Japan’s trade minister reiterated to 
the press that he would not be launching any investiga￾tion into the purported influence by METI in opposing 
foreign investor interests. Similarly, the director of METI, 
in a separate statement, explained that METI saw no im￾proper activity in its involvement, as it was part of METI’s 
responsibility to protect Japan’s national security and in￾dustrial concerns. “We merely implemented policies that 
were natural for METI.”15
MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. What specific actions by Toshiba’s leadership were 
considered inappropriate corporate governance 
practices?
2. What did the activist investors want Toshiba to do?
3. Do you believe it was inappropriate for METI to be￾come involved in discussions of Toshiba’s future and 
shareholder interests?
4. Does it appear that Japan and Toshiba’s movement 
toward improved corporate governance will be 
successful?
Government Communications
One of the most powerful governmental organizations in 
Japan is METI. Created in 2001, the organization com￾bines the previously powerful postwar organization cred￾ited with Japan’s economic revitalization, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry (MITI), with other 
government agencies. The investigators found a series of 
communications between Toshiba and representatives of 
METI discussing the issues posed by a number of foreign 
investors, specifically Effissimo, and what actions might be 
taken to thwart their activities.
One e-mail discussion was found to be particularly 
troubling. On April 11, Toshiba had asked two director 
generals of METI “whether it is legally possible to elim￾inate or control undesirable organizations and institu￾tions,” and if so, “what measures are being prepared?” 
Toshiba implied in these discussions that it was a com￾pany of national security interest, and foreign investors 
could be seen as working against national security and 
taking advantage of the current more open governance 
system.
METI then asked Toshiba for a written request to 
open an investigation into the activities of Effissimo, Far￾allon, HMC, and 3D, among others. Toshiba sent a “draft” 
written request. Toshiba’s draft to METI noted that the 
actions of the foreign investors were not explicitly a viola￾tion of the law but that if an investigation was opened, the 
“tone of the letter should be that there was a suspicion 
of violation [and] if it continued in the future, and that 
urgent action was required.” HMC, after receiving notice 
from METI that it might be subject to investigation, had 
abstained from voting at the July 31 AGM. Toshiba and 
METI then purportedly devised a pressure scheme, the so￾called ‘let METI beat them for a while.’”13
Investigator Conclusions
The investigator’s conclusions on the two concerns were 
clear. On the first, although they noted that there were 
some irregularities by the vote counting authorities (“un￾lawful and unfair”), they found that Toshiba’s manage￾ment had no knowledge or role in that process. On the 
second—the pressure issue—the investigators concluded 
that Toshiba had acted with METI to prevent sharehold￾ers from exercising their shareholder rights at the AGM 
and in some cases sought to have METI try to convince 
shareholders to change voting behavior.14

company?
4.3 Separation of Ownership and Management. Why 
is the separation of ownership from management so 
critical to the understanding of how businesses are 
structured and led?
4.4 Corporate Goals: Shareholder Wealth Maximization.
Explain the assumptions and objectives of the share￾holder wealth maximization model.
4.5 Corporate Goals: Stakeholder Capitalism Model

is a Chinese multinational conglomerate holding 
company. If its share price rises from HK$318 to 
HK$324 within one year, what is the rate of return to 
a shareholder given each of the following:
a. The company paid no dividends.

c. The company paid the dividend, and the total 
return to the shareholder is separated into the 
dividend yield and the capital gain.
4.2 Carty’s Choices. Brian Carty, a prominent investor, is 
evaluating investment alternatives. If he believes an 
individual equity will rise in price from $59 to $71 in 
the coming one-year period, and the share is expected 
to pay a dividend of $1.75 per share, and he expects 
at least a 15% rate of return on an investment of this 
type, should he invest in this particular equity?
4.3 Hercule Poirot and Vaniteux (A). Hercule Poirot 
is a New York-based investor. He has been closely 
following his investment in 100 shares of Vaniteux, 
a French firm that went public in February 2010. 
When he purchased his 100 shares at €17.25 per 
share, the euro was trading at $1.3600 = €1.00. 
Currently, one share is trading at €28.33 per share, 
and the dollar has fallen to $1.4170 = €1.00.
a. If Hercule sells his shares today, what percent￾age change in the share price would he receive?

b. What is the percentage change in the value of 
the euro versus the dollar over this same period?
c. What would be the total return Hercule would 
earn on his shares if he sold them at these rates?
4.4 Hercule Poirot and Vaniteux (B). Hercule Poirot 
chooses not to sell his shares at the time described 
in Problem 4.3. He waits, expecting the share price 
to rise further after the announcement of quarterly 
earnings. His expectations are correct, and the share 
price rises to €31.14 per share after the announce￾ment. He now wishes to recalculate his returns. The 
current spot exchange rate is $1.3110 = €1.00.
4.5 Vaniteux’s Returns. Using the same prices and ex￾change rates as in Problem 4.4, Hercule Poirot and 
Vaniteux (B), what would be the total return on the 
Vaniteux investment by Laurent Vuagnoux, a Paris￾based investor?
4.6 Microsoft’s Dividend Yield. In January 2003, 
Microsoft announced that it would begin paying 
a dividend of $0.16 per share. Given the following 
share prices for Microsoft stock in the recent past, 
how would a constant dividend of $0.16 per share 
per year have changed the company’s return to its 
shareholders over this period?

4.9 Transnational Corporation of Nigeria. During the 
1960s, many conglomerates were created by firms that 
were enjoying a high price/earnings ratio (P/E). These 
firms then used their highly valued stock to acquire 
other firms that had lower P/E ratios, usually in unre￾lated domestic industries. Conglomerates went out of 
fashion during the 1980s when their P/E ratios signifi￾cantly declined, thus making it more difficult to find 
other firms with lower P/E ratios to acquire. During 
the 1990s, the same acquisition strategy was possible 
for firms located in countries where high P/E ratios 
were common compared to firms in other countries 
where low P/E ratios were common. Consider the two 
hypothetical firms shown in the following table:
Transnational Corporation of Nigeria wants to 
acquire Julius Berger Nigeria Plc. It offers 7,500,000 
shares of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria, 
with a current market value of N300,000,000 and a 
12% premium on Julius Berger Nigeria Plc’s shares, 
for all of Julius Berger’s shares.
a. How many shares would Transnational 
Corporation of Nigeria have outstanding after 
the acquisition of Julius Berger?
b. What would be the consolidated earnings of the 
combined Transnational Corporation of Nigeria 
and Julius Berger Nigeria Plc?
c. If market continues to capitalize Transnational 
Corporation of Nigeria’s earnings at a P/E ratio 
of 13, what would be the new market value of 
Transnational Corporation of Nigeria?
d. What would be the new earnings per share of 
Transnational Corporation of Nigeria?
e. What would be the new market of a share of 
Transnational Corporation of Nigeria?
f. How much would Transnational Corporation of 
Nigeria’s stock price increase?
g. Assume that the market takes a negative view 
of the acquisition and lowers Transnational 
Corporation of Nigeria’s P/E ratio to 8. What 
would be the new market price per share of 
stock? What would be its percentage loss?

A number of firms around the world have had to 
lower their previously reported earnings due to acc￾ounting errors or fraud. Assume that Transnational 
Corporation of Nigeria (Problem 4.7) had to lower 
its earnings to N30,000,000 from the previously 
reported N60,000,000. What might be its new mar￾ket value prior to the acquisition? Could it still do 
the acquisition?

New Zealand-based brewery and files all of its fi￾nancial statements in New Zealand dollars (NZD). 
The company’s European sales director Kieran 
Barrett has been criticized for his performance. He 
disagrees, arguing that sales in Europe have grown 
steadily in recent years. Who is correct?

The company’s new CFO believes, however, that what 
was originally thought to have been relatively “cheap 
debt” is no longer true. What do you think?

The foreign exchange market provides the physical and institutional structure through which 
the money of one country is exchanged for that of another country. Through this market, the 
rate of exchange between currencies is determined and foreign exchange transactions are 
physically completed. Foreign exchange means the money of a foreign country; that is, foreign 
currency bank balances, banknotes, checks, and drafts. A foreign exchange transaction is an 
agreement between a buyer and seller that a fixed amount of one currency will be delivered 
for some other currency at a specified rate.
This chapter describes the foreign exchange marketplace—its functions, participants, 
daily trading life, transactions and transaction volumes, and changing quotation practices. The 
chapter concludes with the mini-case Iceland: A Small Country in a Global Crisis, which de￾scribes how Iceland’s highly developed industrialized status and open capital markets led to 
the near destruction of its entire economy and currency.
5.1 Functions of the Foreign Exchange Market
The foreign exchange market is perhaps the largest, most globally integrated, and most ac￾tive financial market in the world. The transactions that take place there are the lifeblood 
of a global economy that comprises many different national currencies. By enabling the 
transfer of funds and purchasing power from one currency to another, the foreign exchange 
The best way to destroy the capitalist system is to debauch the currency. By a continuing pro￾cess of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of 
the wealth of their citizens.

market offers an important means for price discovery that facilitates international trade and 
investment activity. 
—Simon Potter, Executive Vice President of the Markets Group of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, at the 2015 FX Week Conference, New York City, July 14, 2015.
Money is an instrument that is accepted as payment for goods, services, and, in some 
cases, past debt. As all economics students learn, there are typically three functions of money: 
as a unit of account, as a store of value, and as a medium of exchange. The foreign exchange 
market is the mechanism by which participants transfer purchasing power between countries 
by exchanging money, obtaining or providing credit for international trade transactions, and 
minimizing exposure to the risks of exchange rate changes.
The transfer of purchasing power is necessary because international trade and capital 
transactions normally involve parties living in countries with different currencies. Usually 
each party wants to deal in its own currency, but the trade or capital transaction can be in￾voiced in only one currency. Hence, one party must deal in a foreign currency. Because the 
movement of goods between countries takes time, inventory in transit must be financed. The 
foreign exchange market therefore provides a source of credit in addition to the specialized 
instruments used, such as bankers’ acceptances and letters of credit. The foreign exchange 
market  also provides “hedging” facilities for transferring foreign exchange risk from one 
party to another.
5.2 Structure of the Foreign Exchange Market
The foreign exchange market has, like all markets, evolved dramatically over time. Beginning 
with money changing hands in stalls on the streets of Florence and Venice, to the trading 
rooms in London and New York, to a handheld computer anywhere in the world today, the 
market is based on supply and demand, market information and expectations, and negotiat￾ing strength.
The Global Trading Day
The foreign exchange market spans the globe, with prices moving and currencies trading—
somewhere—every hour of every business day. But people—traders—do eventually sleep. 
This translates into four trading sessions per day, illustrated in Exhibit 5.1. The world’s trad￾ing day begins each morning in Sydney and Tokyo, moving on to Hong Kong and Singapore, 
passing on to the Middle East and on to the European markets of Frankfurt, Zurich, and 
London, then making the final jump across the Atlantic to New York and Chicago, ending 
in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Many large international banks operate foreign exchange 
trading rooms in each major geographic trading center in order to serve both their customers 
and themselves—so-called proprietary trading—on a 24-hour-a-day basis.
Although global currency trading is indeed a 24-hour-a-day activity, there are segments 
of the 24-hour day that are busier than others. Historically, the major financial centers of the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries dominated—London and New York. But as is the case 
with much of global commerce today, the Far East, represented by Hong Kong, Tokyo, and 
Singapore, is now threatening that dominance. As the Chinese renminbi continues to grow in 
volume and depth, the growing influence of Shanghai is likely inevitable. When the two larg￾est city-based trading centers overlap, London and New York, the currency market exhibits 
the greatest depth and liquidity. Differences in time zones, however, have been the driver of 
much of the institutional structure of the global currency market, determining how it works 
and how it occasionally doesn’t work—as illustrated by Global Finance in Practice 5.1.

GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 5.1
jolt was the result of an Apple Inc. press release of weak 
sales in China for the previous quarter, prompting the dollar 
sell-off.
The twilight hour trades have a bit of history. For ex￾ample, on October 7, 2016, in the days following the Brexit 
vote, the British pound fell 6% against the dollar to a 31-
year low within the twilight hour in a quiet and thin market. 
The cause of the fall was linked to a senior British official’s 
speculation in a press release that it would be a “hard exit” 
for the UK.
How significant these shocks are is unclear. In most 
cases the currencies return to their traditional trading ranges 
and values within hours or days. But that does not stop them 
from happening again. A month after the January 2019 fall 
of the dollar, another twilight hour hit occurred. The Swiss 
franc plummeted against both the euro and the dollar during 
a placid trading period. The quiet market was later attributed 
to the National Foundation Day holiday in Japan. The prob￾able lesson to be learned is that it is a bad idea to release 
information to the market or the press during the twilight 
hour, whether you are a private individual, a government, or a 
multinational enterprise.
The Twilight Hour in Global FX Trading
The exchange of currencies is indeed a 24-hour market. That 
said, there are peak and trough periods. The daily peak oc￾curs between 9 and 10 a.m. New York time (GMT –5 during 
winter). This is the overlap period with London late trading. 
The daily trough occurs as New York closes and traders are 
heading home, roughly 5 to 7 p.m. And that is when twilight 
trading creeps in. Theoretically, this is when Sydney and 
Hong Kong are opening. But between 5 and 6 a.m., Hong 
Kong traders and trading are starting up slowly, and much of 
the world is doing the same.
But this is also when typically stable currencies can oc￾casionally suffer some “instability.” If a single trade or two of 
size occurs in a thin market or, alternatively, a piece of new 
information about one of the subject currencies or econo￾mies hits the airwaves during this usually placid period, a 
surge or jolt is possible. For example, on Thursday January 
3, 2019, the Japanese yen suddenly surged by 3% against 
the U.S. dollar. This triggered losses against the Australian 
dollar and even Turkish lira—all in minutes between 5 and 
5:30 p.m. New York and 6 and 6:30 a.m. Hong Kong. This

Market Participants—The Players
Participants in the foreign exchange market can be simplistically divided into two major 
groups: those trading currency for commercial purposes, liquidity seekers, and those trad￾ing for profit, profit seekers. Although the foreign exchange market began as a market for 
liquidity purposes, facilitating the exchange of currency for the conduct of commercial trade 
and investment purposes, the exceptional growth in the market has been largely based on 
the expansion of profit-seeking agents. As might be expected, the profit seekers are typically 
much better informed about the market, looking to profit from its future movements, while 
liquidity seekers simply wish to secure currency for transactions. As might be predicted, the 
profit seekers generally profit from the liquidity seekers.
Five broad categories of institutional participants operate in the market: (1) bank 
and nonbank foreign dealers, (2) private individuals and firms conducting commercial or 
investment transactions, (3) speculators and arbitragers, (4) central banks and treasuries, and 
(5) foreign exchange brokers.
Bank and Nonbank Dealers. Bank and nonbank traders and dealers profit from buying 
foreign exchange at a bid price and reselling it at a slightly higher ask (also called an offer) 
price. Competition among dealers worldwide narrows the spread between bids and offers and 
so contributes to making the foreign exchange market “efficient” in the same sense as are 
securities markets.
Dealers in the foreign exchange departments of large international banks often function 
as “market makers.” Such dealers stand willing at all times to buy and sell those currencies 
in which they specialize and thus maintain an “inventory” position in those currencies. They 
trade with other banks in their own monetary centers and with other centers around the 
world in order to maintain inventories within the trading limits set by bank policy. Trading 
limits are important because foreign exchange departments of many banks operate as profit 
centers and individual dealers are compensated on a profit incentive basis.
Currency trading is quite profitable for many institutions. Many of the world’s major 
currency-trading banks average between 10% and 20% of their annual net income from cur￾rency trading. Currency trading is also very profitable for the bank’s traders, who typically 
earn a bonus based on the profitability to the bank of their individual trading activities. Small 
to medium-sized banks and institutions are likely to participate but not to be market makers 
in the interbank market. Instead of maintaining significant inventory positions, they often 
buy from and sell to larger institutions in order to offset retail transactions with their own 
customers or to seek short-term profits for their own accounts.
Commercial and Investment Transactors. Importers and exporters, international 
portfolio investors, multinational corporations, tourists, and others use the foreign ex￾change market to facilitate execution of commercial or investment transactions. Their use 
of the foreign exchange market is necessary but incidental to their underlying commercial 
or investment purpose. Some of these participants use the market to hedge foreign ex￾change risk as well.
Speculators and Arbitragers. Speculators and arbitragers seek to profit from trading 
within the market itself. True profit seekers, they operate in their own interest, without a need 
or obligation to serve clients or to ensure a continuous market. Whereas dealers seek profit 
from the spread between bids and offers in addition to what they might gain from changes in 
exchange rates, speculators seek their profit from exchange rate changes. Arbitragers try to 
profit from simultaneous exchange rate differences in different markets.
M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 149 10/07/23 4:33 PM150 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Central Banks and Treasuries. Central banks and treasuries use the market to acquire or 
spend their country’s foreign exchange reserves as well as to influence the price at which their 
own currency is traded, a practice known as foreign exchange intervention. They may act to sup￾port the value of their own currency because of national policies or because of commitments 
to other countries under exchange rate currency agreements. Consequently, the motive is not 
to earn a profit as such, but rather to influence the foreign exchange value of their currency in 
a manner that will benefit domestic interests. In many instances, central banks do their job best 
when they willingly take a loss on their foreign exchange transactions. As willing loss takers, 
central banks and treasuries differ in motive and behavior from other market participants.
Foreign Exchange Brokers. Foreign exchange brokers are agents who facilitate trading 
between dealers without themselves becoming principals in the transaction. They charge 
a small commission for this service. They maintain instant access to hundreds of dealers 
worldwide.
Evolution of the Market
The modern foreign exchange marketplace arose from the ashes of the Bretton Woods 
System. Under Bretton Woods, exchange rates were fixed, and trading of currencies was con￾fined to commercial and investment purposes—the needs of the liquidity seekers. But with 
the collapse of Bretton Woods and the flotation of currencies, profit seekers entered the mar￾ket in volume and, in the case of Herstatt—the subject of Global Finance in Practice 5.2—
with impact.
The evolution of foreign exchange trading institutions is described in Exhibit 5.2. It 
serves as something of a microcosm of institutional change of global society, from the tele￾phone to the computer to the Internet. How currency rates are quoted, prices posted, and 
trades consummated, confirmed, and settled—across borders, time zones, and oceans—has all 
changed very quickly.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 5.2
it was closed by regulators. Chase Manhattan Bank of New 
York, Herstatt’s primary correspondent bank in the U.S., 
had $620 million in accounts due from Herstatt to customer 
banks in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland, and Sweden.
The simple reason for Herstatt’s delay in making the 
payments was time zone differences. At that hour in the af￾ternoon in Cologne, Chase Manhattan in New York was just 
opening. Herstatt had only started to initiate counterparty 
payments when its doors were closed (as were its telex lines 
for transfers).
This settlement failure set off a chain reaction in the inter￾national currency markets. All major currency trading banks 
now froze in fear of the risk of settlement. Banks in New York 
specifically refused to make payments on trades until receiv￾ing confirmation that their countervalue had been received. 
The fall in currency trading in the New York market alone in 
the days following Herstatt’s closure was estimated at more 
than 75%. This newly perceived risk, settlement risk, now be￾came known as Herstatt Risk.
Bankhaus Herstatt and Herstatt Risk
Bankhaus Herstatt was a relatively small Cologne bank, the 
eightieth largest in Germany. But Herstatt was a major player 
(speculator) in foreign exchange trading. In a three-year pe￾riod, 1971–1973, foreign exchange trading had moved from 
3% of total bank income to 57%. But for more than two years 
Herstatt had been the object of constant rumor, debate, and 
even regulator concern over the size and aggressiveness of 
its foreign currency positions. On June 26, 1974, at 15:30 
(3:30 p.m.) Central European Time, German bank regulators 
shut it down.
Herstatt’s large currency trading business meant that 
it was settling very large international currency transactions 
daily through its international correspondent banks. On June 
26 a number of Herstatt’s major counterparties—banks with 
which it had executed currency trades—had made large pay￾ments in deutsche marks to the bank, but they had not yet 
received their payments from Herstatt in U.S. dollars before 
M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 150 10/07/23 4:33 PMCHAPTER 5 The Foreign Exchange Market 151
The foreign exchange market is the world’s largest financial market. It is, however, an in￾formal market—a market without a single dealer, a single exchange, a single global regulator, 
or even a single price. That said, the foreign exchange market is considered to be one of the 
world’s most competitive markets.
The Evolution of FX Trading
To understand how the foreign exchange market has evolved over the past 30 years, consider the 
mechanics and content of a basic foreign currency trade undertaken by two voice traders, first in 
1985, then in the 1990s, and again in 2010. Keep in mind that currency trading at this time is con￾ducted between hundreds of banks around the world, much of it simultaneously, and all bilaterally.
1985. Two foreign exchange dealers, one in London and one in New York, are talking on the 
phone. Both work for major banks, and both are rewarded handsomely for making profits for 
their banks on foreign exchange trading. Each knows the other bank and the other trader. When 
one asks for an indication—a currency quote containing a bid-ask spread—on a foreign currency 
pair like the GBP/USD (the dollar–pound exchange rate, the U.S. dollars to equal one British 
pound, also termed cable)—the other knows who is quoting the rate and that the rate is valid for 
a trade (and not just a representative price, but one for which a contractual trade can be made). 
If they agree to a trade, each writes the key elements of the transaction on a piece of paper which 
is then carried by hand to the back-office staff for documentation, verification, and eventually 
settlement. This basic trading structure is illustrated in the left-hand panel of Exhibit 5.3.
Now consider what the two traders don’t know. They don’t know the rates at which other 
banks and other dealers have traded the currency pair in recent minutes or hours, unless they 
have called others or exchanged information with their colleagues sitting in the same trading 
room. They do not know what other dealers are quoting the same currency pair for at this 
same moment, so they don’t have explicit data on how competitive the quote they are receiv￾ing or providing is—they have limited price discovery capability. If they complete a trade, one 
or the other may make an error in recording the transaction on paper, or the back-office itself

balances for exchange.
1990s. Now move forward in time to the 1990s foreign exchange market, as seen on the 
right-hand side of Exhibit 5.3. The same two traders are considering a trade again, but now 
they are conversing using computers and the Internet. They still know the bank and trader 
on the other end of the link. But now they can look at a Reuters screen as they exchange 
the quote to track what other recent transactions have been completed at and possibly what 
other banks are at this moment giving as representative trade quotes. If they complete the 
trade, there is an instantaneous digital record of the trade, and the record is simultaneously 
passed to the back-office for verification and settlement. The introduction of an electronic 
broker changes things.
The computer-based process in the 1990s is obviously more efficient from a variety of 
operational perspectives, and more importantly, it is conducted in a market where individual 
agents have instantaneous access to much more relevant market data. But there are still con￾straints and limitations. The market is still accessible only by the intermarket dealers, typi￾cally big banks, and smaller banks and private customers like investment funds are outsiders 
and must still deal with the dealer to access this large and liquid market. For these smaller 
players, access comes at a higher cost and a higher spread. (Customers may also not have ac￾cess to real-time price data.) And although there is now electronic messaging confirmation to 
expedite the trade verification and instructions for settlement, the banks are still in different 
countries and different time zones, so settlement risk (Herstatt Risk) still exists.
2010 - Today. Now move forward in time to 2010 to the present. The same two dealers are 
now looking at large digital screens of competing quotes and transaction records. Trades are 
conducted electronically, with no need for telephone or any specific direct trader contact. 
Trading is now fragmented, transactions occurring across a multitude of different venues.
All trades conducted by telephone between 
dealers and currency brokers. Retail customers

The separation of the interdealer and customer markets has effectively broken down, as 
seen in Exhibit 5.4, with the introduction of multibank trading systems (MBT), single-bank 
trading systems (SMT), and prime brokerage (PB). Prime brokerage is a dealer–customer 
structure that allows customers such as hedge funds to deal directly in the interdealer mar￾ket. Small customers, those exchanging small notional amounts that in previous years would 
pay higher transaction costs and have access only to much wider spreads, now gain access to 
the global currency market through a variety of structures including retail aggregators. Retail 
aggregators collect and consolidate a multitude of small orders for large order execution.
Two types of trades or traders remain outside the core foreign exchange market today, 
emerging market currencies and small banks. The majority of the dealer and brokerage mar￾kets require large amounts of capital investment and volume trading, neither of which the 
small bank can support. Small banks therefore use one of the trading systems for access, often 
specializing in peripheral or emerging market currencies. Emerging market currencies, due 
to their relatively small volume and low liquidity, may still utilize voice brokers for trading.
The Three Components of FX Trades
The exchange of a foreign exchange trade today actually involves three different compo￾nents: (1) the foreign exchange trade transaction agreement—the interaction of dealers, bro￾kers, and aggregators as just described; (2) electronic communication and notification for 
payment and settlement; and (3) final settlement of the currency trade.
Foreign exchange trades today are recorded electronically, utilizing financial instruc￾tions for payment and settlement. These instructions are executed—hopefully securely—
through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). The 
SWIFT system, initiated in 1973, is a network that allows financial institutions all over the 
world to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized, 
and reliable manner. The SWIFT network sends payment orders, but it does not facilitate 
the actual transfer of funds—settlement. Settlement of a foreign exchange trade is made by 
The two-tier structure which separated the Interdealer Market and Customer
Market for so many years is effectively gone. Today’s system, dominated by
electronic trading, allows customers of all kinds direct access to global trading.

correspondent accounts that the banks and institutions have with each other. Nearly all cross￾border foreign exchange transactions are executed via SWIFT today.
Final settlement of the currency trade is the critically important and topical issue of 
Herstatt Risk. Herstatt or settlement risk has been largely eliminated by continuous linked 
settlement (CLS), which was introduced in 2002. In a CLS, a specialist bank provides set￾tlement services to its members for foreign exchange trades. CLS uses a payment versus 
payment (PvP) settlement service where both sides’ payment instructions for an FX trans￾action are settled simultaneously. Without PvP, there is a risk that one party to a currency 
transaction will deliver the currency it owes but not receive the other currency from its coun￾terparty. This risk is accentuated in transactions across different time zones, as in the case of 
Bankhaus Herstatt in 1974. As of 2015, CLS provided settlement services for 18 different cur￾rencies and more than 9,000 bank and institutional traders.
Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of man and machine, fraud and failure still persist.
FX Market Manipulation: Fixing the Fix
Following the turmoil surrounding the setting of LIBOR rates in the interbank market dur￾ing the 2007–2009 period (described in detail in Chapter 8), similar allegations arose over 
the possible manipulation of benchmarks in the foreign exchange markets in 2013 and 2014.
Much of the focus was on the London fix, the 4 p.m. daily benchmark rate used by a mul￾titude of institutions and indices for marking value. Market analysts had noted steep spikes 
in trading just prior to the 4 p.m. fix, spikes that were not sustained in the hours and days that 
followed. Traders were alleged to be exchanging e-mails and using social networking sites and 
even phone calls to collaborate on market movements and price quotes at key times. After 
hours, personal trading by currency traders, an area of only marginal concern before, was also 
under review. Moving from voice trading (telephone) to electronic trading was thought to be 
one possible long-term fix, but traders still communicated with other traders using a variety 
of electronic mediums and social networks.
By 2014, nearly 75% of all currency trades were executed electronically. The growth of 
electronic execution was expected to be something of a market fix for the 4 p.m. market 
spikes seen previously, thought to be caused by collusion among traders. With more and more 
of the market’s transactions executed electronically, computer algorithms were believed to be 
less likely to pursue fraudulent trading for fixing given the speed and frequency of transac￾tions. Research has also shown strong evidence that electronic trading is more stabilizing than 
voice trading, as most of the algorithmic codes are based on reversion to the mean—to the 
market averages—over time.
But, as is the case with many technological fixes, the fix did not eliminate the problem—it 
had possibly just changed it. Electronic trading might still facilitate market manipulation, just 
of a more sophisticated kind. For example, there was a rumor of software in development that 
could detect mouse movements by other currency traders on some of the largest electronic 
platforms, allowing a computer (human attached) to detect another trader’s mouse hovering 
over the bid or ask button prior to execution. Alas, it appears there will always be the human 
element in trading, for better or for worse.
The FX Global Code of Conduct 2016
Following the discovery of significant market manipulation and coordinated malfeasance in 
2013 and 2014 in the foreign exchange market, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) 
proposed a set of global principles of good practice in the foreign exchange market. The BIS’s 
M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 154 10/07/23 4:33 PMCHAPTER 5 The Foreign Exchange Market 155
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 5.3
In reality, the forex markets in Europe considered the 
exchange rate set by ERM CRM to be too high for pound and 
expected it to fall beyond the allowed range sooner rather 
than later. Among other traders, George Soros is known for 
building a short position portfolio against the value of pound 
sterling. A short position is a promise to sell underlying asset 
at a future time point at a price agreed today, without owning 
the said asset. This is a strategy used by traders when they 
expect a drop in price for the underlying asset. These portfo￾lios of derivatives were designed to generate extremely high 
profit if the pound value falls beyond the lower range of ERM 
exchange rate.
When the exchange rate started to fall below the lower 
level of the range in September 1992, the U.K. government 
authorized to sell of its reserve of foreign currencies to prop 
up its value. Once the trading day started at 8.30 am on 16th 
September 1992 the currency traders began to sell off pound 
for foreign currencies and Bank of England was obliged to 
accept these orders as per the ERM regulations. Within two 
hours on the day, the amount of pound offered to Bank of 
England for sale became so high that they took an extraor￾dinary step to inform the prime minister, John Major, that the 
pound purchase program is rendered ineffective. The regula￾tors then decided, on the same day, to increase the base rate 
by 2% (from 10% to 12%) to generate demand for pound to 
undermine the selling pressure. By the end of the day -7 pm 
on the same day, the government announced that they will 
withdraw from ERM.
On Black Wednesday Tuesday, George Soros made 
more than £1 billion in one day by short selling pound. The 
U.K. treasury estimated the cost of this exercise to be £3.14 
billion to the taxpayers. The events on the day also eroded 
the country’s forex market credibility.

Black Wednesday: The 1992 Sterling Crisis
Before the adoption of Euro as the common currency across 
the European Union, the EU adopted European Exchange 
Rate Mechanism or ERM that pegged different currencies 
inside the Eurozone with each other at a fixed rate. This ar￾rangement was designed to prevent any large fluctuations in 
their relative value making them more stable.
The United Kingdom opted out of ERM when it was 
adopted by EU in 1979, but then changed its mind in 1990 
and joined the ERM. The pound was entered into ERM at an 
exchange rate of Deuche Mark (Germany’s currency) 2.91 per 
pound. The ERM effectively guaranteed that the U.K. gov￾ernment would not allow the pound and the other member 
currencies to fluctuate by more than 6% and will undertake 
every possible measure to stop the exchange rate move be￾yond this given range. If the exchange rate moved towards 
the bottom of this range, the U.K. government was obliged 
to intervene.
This intervention was required within two years in 1992 
when the high interest rate in the country. The onset of Gulf 
War in 1990 and its escalation in the following two years led 
to increase in fuel prices and increased foreign and defense 
spending by the United Kingdom. Domestically, the United 
Kingdom saw inflation growing to 8.8% by April 1990. Be￾tween 1990 and 1992, the unemployment rate grew to 9.8% 
of the total work force. Bankruptcies increases rapidly, from 
a mere 9,365 in 1989 to 35,950 in the first three quarters of 
1992. The GDP growth dropped from 2.1% in 1981 to -2.2% 
in 1991. Barclays, one of the largest U.K. banks recorded its 
first ever loss. The combined effect of these domestic and ex￾ternal events started to put significant pressure on the value of 
pound and therefore its exchange rate with other currencies 
started to go down. The faster depreciating pound brought 
the exchange rate between Germany and the United King￾dom to the bottom of the allowed range of ERM regime.
Global Code is intended to provide a common set of guidelines to promote the integrity and 
effective functioning of the foreign exchange market. As stated by the BIS, “It is intended to 
promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent market in which a diverse 
set of Market Participants, supported by resilient infrastructure, are able to confidently and ef￾fectively transact at competitive prices that reflect available market information and in a manner 
M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 155 10/07/23 4:33 PM156 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
that conforms to acceptable standards of behaviour.”1
 As with most codes of conduct, it does 
not impose legal or regulatory obligations; it only promotes global best practices and processes.
The Global Code is made up of six leading principles.
1. Ethics: Market Participants are expected to behave in an ethical and professional manner 
to promote the fairness and integrity of the FX Market.
2. Governance: Market Participants are expected to have robust and clear policies, proce￾dures, and organizational structure in place to promote responsible engagement in the 
FX Market.
3. Information Sharing: Market Participants are expected to be clear and accurate in their 
communications and to protect confidential information to promote effective communi￾cation that supports a robust, fair, open, liquid, and appropriately transparent FX Market.
4. Execution: Market Participants are expected to exercise care when negotiating and ex￾ecuting transactions in order to promote a robust, fair, open, liquid, and appropriately 
transparent FX Market.
5. Risk Management and Compliance: Market Participants are expected to promote and 
maintain a robust control and compliance environment to effectively identify, measure, 
monitor, manage, and report on the risks associated with their engagement in the FX 
Market.
6. Confirmation and Settlement Processes: Market Participants are expected to put in place 
robust, efficient, transparent, and risk-mitigating post-trade processes to promote the 
predictable, smooth, and timely settlement of transactions in the FX Market.
5.3 Transactions in the Foreign Exchange Market
Transactions in the foreign exchange market can be executed on a spot, forward, or swap
basis. A broader definition of the market, one including major derivatives, would include for￾eign currency options, futures, and swaps.
Spot Transactions
A spot transaction in the interbank market is the purchase of foreign exchange with delivery 
and payment between banks taking place normally on the second following business day. The 
Canadian dollar settles with the U.S. dollar on the first following business day. Exhibit 5.5 
provides a timetable of the three major types of over-the-counter currency transactions 
typically executed in the global foreign exchange market: spot transactions, forward transac￾tions, and swap transactions. Although there are a number of variations on these types, all 
transactions are defined by their future date for delivery. (Note that we are not including 
futures transactions here; they parallel the time footprint of forwards but are not executed 
over-the-counter.)
The date of settlement is referred to as the value date. On the value date, most dollar 
transactions in the world are settled through the computerized Clearing House Interbank 
Payments System (CHIPS) in New York, which calculates net balances owed by any one bank 
to another and which facilitates payment of those balances by 6:00 p.m. that same day in 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York funds. Other central banks and settlement services pro￾viders operate similarly in other currencies around the world.

M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 156 10/07/23 4:33 PMCHAPTER 5 The Foreign Exchange Market 157
 A typical spot transaction in the interbank market might involve a U.S. bank contracting 
on a Monday for the transfer of £10,000,000 to the account of a London bank. If the spot 
exchange rate were $1.8420 to each British pound (£), the U.S. bank would transfer £10 
million to the London bank on Wednesday, and the London bank would transfer $18.42 
million to the U.S. bank at the same time. A spot transaction between a bank and its com￾mercial customer would not necessarily involve a wait of two days for settlement. 
 Forward Transactions 
A forward transaction (or more formally, an outright forward transaction ) requires delivery at 
a future value date of a specified amount of one currency for a specified amount of another 
currency. The exchange rate is established at the time of the agreement, but payment and de￾livery are not required until maturity. Forward exchange rates are normally quoted for value 
dates of one, two, three, six, and twelve months. Although the heaviest demand is for maturi￾ties of one year or less, forwards today are often quoted as far as 20 years into the future. 
According to the IMF, in 2014 there were 127 countries with forward markets. 
 Payment on forward contracts occurs on the second business day after the even￾month anniversary of the trade. Thus, a two-month forward transaction entered into on 
March 18 will be for a value date of May 20, or the next business day if May 20 falls on a 
weekend or holiday. Note that as a matter of terminology we can speak of “buying for￾ward” or “selling forward” to describe the same transaction. A contract to deliver dollars 
for euros in six months is both “buying euros forward for dollars” and “selling dollars 
forward for euros.”

Foreign exchange operations are defined by the timing—the future date—set for delivery. There are in principle three major
categories of over-the-counter transactions categorized by future delivery: spot (which may be overnight), forward
(including outright forward), and swap transactions.
 EXHIBIT 5. 5 Foreign Exchange Transactions and Settlement 
M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 157 10/07/23 4:33 PM158 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Swap Transactions
A swap transaction in the interbank market is the simultaneous purchase and sale of a given 
amount of foreign exchange for two different value dates. Both purchase and sale are con￾ducted with the same counterparty. There are several types of swap transactions.
Spot Against Forward. The most common type of swap is a spot against forward. The 
dealer buys a currency in the spot market (at the spot rate) and simultaneously sells the same 
amount back to the same bank in the forward market (at the forward exchange rate). Since 
this is executed as a single transaction with just one counterparty, the dealer incurs no unex￾pected foreign exchange risk. Swap transactions and outright forwards combined made up 
more than half of all foreign exchange market activity in recent years.
Forward-Forward Swaps. A more sophisticated swap transaction is called a
forward-forward swap. For example, a dealer sells £20,000,000 forward for dollars for delivery 
in, say, two months at $1.8420/£ and simultaneously buys £20,000,000 forward for delivery 
in three months at $1.8400/£. The difference between the buying price and the selling price 
is equivalent to the interest rate differential, which is the interest rate parity described in 
Chapter 6 between the two currencies. Thus, a swap can be viewed as a technique for borrow￾ing another currency on a fully collateralized basis.
Nondeliverable Forwards (NDFs). Created in the early 1990s, the nondeliverable forward 
(NDF) is now a relatively common derivative offered by the largest providers of foreign ex￾change derivatives. NDFs possess the same characteristics and documentation requirements 
as traditional forward contracts, except that they are settled only in U.S. dollars; the foreign 
currency being sold forward or bought forward is not delivered. The dollar settlement feature 
reflects the fact that NDFs are contracted offshore, for example in New York for a Mexican 
investor, and so are beyond the reach and regulatory frameworks of the home country gov￾ernments (Mexico in this case). NDFs are traded internationally using standards set by the 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). Although originally envisioned to 
be a method of currency hedging, it is now estimated that more than 70% of all NDF trading 
is for speculation purposes.
NDFs are used primarily for emerging market currencies or currencies subject to sig￾nificant exchange controls, like Venezuela. Emerging market currencies often do not have 
open spot market currency trading, liquid money markets, or quoted Eurocurrency interest 
rates. Although most NDF trading focused on Latin America in the 1990s, many Asian cur￾rencies—including the Chinese renminbi—have been very widely traded in recent years. In 
general, NDF markets normally develop for country currencies having large cross-border 
capital movements, but which are still subject to convertibility restrictions.
Pricing of NDFs reflects basic interest differentials, as with regular forwards (described 
in detail in Chapter 6), plus some additional premium charged by the bank for dollar settle￾ment. If, however, there is no accessible or developed money market for interest rate setting, 
the pricing of the NDF takes on a much more speculative element. Without true interest 
rates, traders may price NDFs based on what they believe spot rates may be in the future.
NDFs are traded and settled outside the country of the subject currency, and therefore 
are beyond the control of the country’s government. In the past, this has created a difficult 
situation, in which the NDF market serves as something of a gray market in the trading of 
that currency. For example, in late 2001, Argentina was under increasing pressure to abandon 
its fixed exchange rate regime of one peso equaling one U.S. dollar. The NDF market, how￾ever, quoted much weaker rates of pesos per dollar, leading to increasing speculative pressure 
against the peso (to the ire of the Argentine government).
M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 158 10/07/23 4:33 PMCHAPTER 5 The Foreign Exchange Market 159
NDFs, however, have proven to be something of an imperfect replacement for traditional 
forward contracts. The problems with the NDF typically involve its “fixing of spot rate on the 
fixing date,” the spot rate at the end of the contract used to calculate the settlement. In times 
of financial crisis, for example with the Venezuelan bolivar in 2003, the government of the 
subject currency may suspend foreign exchange trading in the spot market for an extended 
period. Without an official fixing rate, the NDF cannot be settled. In the case of Venezuela, 
the problem was compounded when a new official “devalued bolivar” was announced but 
was still not traded.
Size of the Foreign Exchange Market
The BIS, in conjunction with central banks around the world, conducts a survey of currency 
trading activity every three years. The most recent survey, conducted in April 2019, estimated 
daily global net turnover in the foreign exchange market to be $6.6 trillion, a 30% increase 
from 2016. The BIS data for surveys between 1989 and 2019 are shown in Exhibit 5.6.
Global foreign exchange turnover in Exhibit 5.6 is divided into the three categories of 
currency instruments discussed previously—spot transactions, forward transactions, and swap 
transactions—plus a fourth category of options and other variable-value foreign exchange 
derivatives. Growth has been dramatic: since 1989, daily foreign exchange market turnover 
has increased by more than 1,000%.
As of 2019 (daily trading in April), trading in the foreign exchange market was $6.6 trillion 
per day, with $2.0 trillion in spot trading, $1.0 trillion in outright forwards, $3.2 trillion in 
foreign exchange swaps, and $0.4 trillion in options and other foreign exchange derivatives.

financial crisis of 2008–2009 seemingly did not. Interestingly, the 2016 survey indicated a de￾cline in spot trading for the first time since 2001. Trading, however, returned to its growth 
path in 2019, up 30% from 2016. The BIS and others believe that it is the growth in electronic 
trading, more investors in search of profit, and different distributors of big data that are driv￾ing this growth.
Geographical Distribution
Exhibit 5.7 shows the proportionate share of foreign exchange trading for the top 10 na￾tional markets in the world between 2013 and 2019. (Note that although the data are col￾lected and reported on a national basis, the “U.S.” and “UK” should largely be interpreted 
as “New York” and “London,” respectively. The majority of foreign exchange trading takes 
place in each country’s major financial city.) These 10 markets made up 91% of all trading 
in 2019.
The United Kingdom (London) continues to be the hub of global foreign exchange trad￾ing with 53% of the market, followed by the U.S. (New York) with 20%. Although those 
two markets alone make up 73% of all global trading, it does appear that Asian trading 
(Singapore, Hong Kong, and China) is growing appreciably in market share.
Older traditional centers like Japan are showing no real growth in trading, hence declin￾ing market share. Switzerland, however, one of the oldest in foreign exchange trading, saw 
a resurgence in 2019. The relative growth of currency trading in Asia versus Europe over 
the past 15 years is not surprising given the growth of the Asian economies, markets, and 
currencies, combined with the introduction and expansion of the euro (decreasing the need

for intra-European currency trading with the elimination of individual country currencies) 
to shift currency exchange activity. The two biggest questions about the locus of future for￾eign exchange trading are how fast Chinese trading will grow and what Brexit (the United 
Kingdom’s decision to exit the European Union) will mean for London-based trading.
Currency Composition
The currency composition of trading, as detailed in Exhibit 5.8, also indicates a number of 
global shifts. The U.S. dollar continues to maintain its share of global currency trades (being 
one of the currencies involved in individual trades) yet increasing ever so slightly in recent 
years to 88%. The Japanese yen and the European euro both showed minor declines in trade 
share, their roles as two of the world’s three most frequently traded currencies appearing to 
be under siege by the Chinese renminbi (4.1%, nearly doubling since 2013) and a number of 
other emerging market currencies. Because all currencies are traded against other curren￾cies—in pairs—all percentages shown in Exhibit 5.8 are for that currency versus another.
5.4 Foreign Exchange Rates and Quotations
A foreign exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency. 
A foreign exchange quotation (or quote) is a statement of willingness to buy or sell at an an￾nounced rate. As we delve into the grammar of currency trading, keep in mind basic pricing, 
as in, say, the pricing of an orange. If the price of an orange is $1.20, the “price” is $1.20, and 
the “unit” is the orange.
Currency Symbols
Quotations may be designated by traditional currency symbols or by ISO codes. The 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is the world’s largest developer of vol￾untary standards. ISO 4217 is the International Standard for currency codes, most recently 
updated in ISO 4217:2008. The ISO codes were developed for use in electronic communica￾tions. Both traditional symbols and currency codes are given in full at the end of this book, 
but the major ones used throughout this chapter are the following:
Currency Traditional Symbol ISO 4217 Code
U.S. dollar $ USD
European euro € EUR
Great Britain pound £ GBP
Japanese yen ¥ JPY
Mexican peso Ps MXN
Today, all electronic trading of currencies between institutions in the global marketplace 
uses the three-letter ISO codes. Although there are no hard-and-fast rules in the retail mar￾kets and in business periodicals, European and American periodicals have a tendency to use 
the traditional currency symbols, while many publications in Asia and the Middle East have 
embraced the use of ISO codes. Most countries, however, continue to use traditional currency 
symbols on paper currency (banknotes).

Exchange Rate Quotes
Foreign exchange quotations follow a number of principles, which at first may seem a bit con￾fusing or non-intuitive. Every currency exchange involves two currencies, currency 1 (CUR1) 
and currency 2 (CUR2):
CUR1/CUR2
The currency on the left of the slash is called the base currency or the unit currency. The cur￾rency on the right of the slash is called the price currency or quote currency. The quotation 
always indicates the number of units of the price currency, CUR2, required in exchange for 
receiving one unit of the base currency, CUR1.
For example, the most commonly quoted currency exchange is that between the U.S. 
dollar and the European euro. For example, a quotation of EUR/USD 1.2174 designates the 
euro (EUR) as the base currency, the dollar (USD) as the price currency, and the exchange 
rate is USD1.2174 = EUR1.00. If you can remember that the currency quoted on the left of 
the slash is always the base currency and always a single unit, you can avoid confusion. 
Exhibit 5.9 provides a brief overview of the multitude of terms used globally to quote curren￾cies using the European euro and U.S. dollar.
Market Conventions
The international currency market, although the largest financial market in the world, is 
steeped in history and convention.
European Terms. European terms, the quoting of the quantity of a specific currency per 
one U.S. dollar, has been market practice for most of the past 60 years or more. Globally, the 
base currency used to quote a currency’s value has typically been the U.S. dollar. Labeled 
European terms, this means that whenever a currency’s value is quoted, it is quoted in terms 
of number of units of currency to equal one U.S. dollar.
For example, if a trader in Zurich, whose home currency is the Swiss franc (CHF), were to 
request a quote from an Oslo-based trader on the Norwegian krone (NOK), the Norwegian 
trader would quote the value of the NOK against the USD, not the CHF. The result is that 
most currencies are quoted per U.S. dollar—Japanese yen per U.S. dollar, Norwegian krone 
per U.S. dollar, Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar, Brazilian real per U.S. dollar, Malaysian ringgit 
per U.S. dollar, Chinese renminbi per U.S. dollar, and so on.

EXHIBIT 5.9 Foreign Currency Quotations
M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 163 10/07/23 4:33 PM164 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
American Terms. There are two major exceptions to this rule of using European terms: the 
euro and the U.K. pound sterling (the pound sterling for historical tradition). Both are nor￾mally quoted in American terms—the U.S. dollar price of one euro and the U.S. dollar price 
of one pound sterling. Additionally, Australian dollars and New Zealand dollars are normally 
quoted on American terms.
For centuries, the British pound sterling consisted of 20 shillings, each of which equaled 
12 pence. Multiplication and division with the non-decimal currency were difficult. The cus￾tom evolved for foreign exchange prices in London, then the undisputed financial capital of 
the world, to be stated in foreign currency units per pound. This practice remained even after 
sterling changed to decimals in 1971.
The euro was first introduced as a substitute or replacement for domestic currencies like 
the deutsche mark and French franc. To make the transition simple for residents and users of 
these historical currencies, all quotes were made on a “domestic currency per euro” basis. This 
held true for its quotation against the U.S. dollar; hence, “U.S. dollars per euro” is the com￾mon quotation used today.
American terms are also used in quoting rates for most foreign currency options and fu￾tures, as well as in retail markets that deal with tourists and personal remittances. Again, this 
is largely a result of established practices that have been perpetuated over time, rather than 
some basic law of finance.
Currency Nicknames. Foreign exchange traders may also use nicknames for major cur￾rencies. “Cable” means the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and U.K. pounds sterling, the 
name dating from the time when transactions in dollars and pounds were carried out over 
the transatlantic telegraph cable. A Canadian dollar is a “loonie,” named after the water 
fowl on Canada’s one dollar coin. “Kiwi” stands for the New Zealand dollar, “Aussie” for the 
Australian dollar, “Swissie” for Swiss francs, and “Sing dollar” for the Singapore dollar.
Direct and Indirect Quotations. A direct quote is the price of a foreign currency in domestic 
currency units. An indirect quote is the price of the domestic currency in foreign currency units. 
In retail exchange in many countries (such as currency exchanged in hotels or airports), it is 
common practice to quote the home currency as the price and the foreign currency as the unit. 
A woman walking down the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris might see the following quote:
EUR0.8214 = USD1.00
Since in France the home currency is the euro (the price) and the foreign currency is the 
dollar (the unit), in Paris this quotation is a direct quote on the dollar or a price quote on the 
dollar. She might say to herself, “0.8214 euros per dollar,” or “It will cost me 0.8214 euros to 
get one dollar.” These are European terms.
At the same time a man walking down Broadway in New York City may see the follow￾ing quote in a bank window:
USD1.2174 = EUR1.00
Since in the U.S. the home currency is the U.S. dollar (the price) and the foreign cur￾rency is the euro (the unit), in New York this would be a direct quote on the euro (the home 
currency price of one unit of foreign currency) and an indirect quote on the dollar (the for￾eign currency price of one unit of home currency). The man might say to himself, “I will pay 
M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 164 10/07/23 4:33 PMCHAPTER 5 The Foreign Exchange Market 165
$1.2174 dollars per euro.” These are American terms. The two quotes are obviously equivalent 
(at least to four decimal places), one being the reciprocal of the other: 
1
EUR0.8214 per USD 1.00 = USD1.2174 per EUR 1.00
Bid and Ask Rates. Although a newspaper or magazine article will state an exchange rate 
as a single value, the market for buying and selling currencies, whether it be retail or whole￾sale, uses two different rates, one for buying and one for selling. Exhibit 5. 10 provides a sam￾ple of how these quotations may be seen in the market for the dollar/euro. 
 A bid is the price (i.e., exchange rate) in one currency at which a dealer will buy another 
currency. An ask is the price (i.e., exchange rate) at which a dealer will sell the other currency. 
Dealers bid (buy) at one price and ask (sell) at a slightly higher price, making their profit 
from the spread between the prices. The bid-ask spread may be quite large for currencies that 
are traded infrequently, in small volumes, or both. 
 Bid and ask quotations in the foreign exchange markets are superficially complicated 
by the fact that the bid for one currency is also the offer for the opposite currency. A 
trader seeking to buy dollars with euros is simultaneously offering to sell euros for dol￾lars. Closing rates for selected currencies as quoted by The Wall Street Journal are pre￾sented in Exhibit 5. 11 .

The Wall Street Journal gives American terms quotes under the heading “USD equiva￾lent” and European terms quotes under the heading “Currency per USD.” Quotes are given 
on an outright basis for spot, with forwards of one, three, and six months provided for a few 
select currencies. Quotes are for trading among banks in amounts of $1 million or more, as 
quoted at 4 p.m. EST by Reuters. The Wall Street Journal does not state whether these are bid, 
ask, or midrate (an average of the bid and ask) quotations.
M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 166 10/07/23 4:33 PMCHAPTER 5 The Foreign Exchange Market 167
The order of currencies in quotations used by traders can be confusing (at least the au￾thors of this book think so). As noted by one major international banking publication: The 
notation EUR/USD is the system used by traders, although mathematically it would be more 
correct to express the exchange rate the other way around, as it shows how many USD have to be 
paid to obtain EUR 1. This is why the currency quotes shown previously in Exhibit 5.10—like 
EUR/USD, USD/JPY, or GBP/USD—are quoted and used in business and the rest of this 
text as $1.2170/€, ¥83.16/$, and $1.5552/£. International finance is not for the weak of heart!
Cross Rates
Many currency pairs are only inactively traded, so their exchange rate is determined through 
their relationship to a widely traded third currency. For example, a Mexican importer needs 
Japanese yen to pay for purchases in Tokyo. Both the Mexican peso (MXN or the old peso 
symbol, Ps) and the Japanese yen (JPY or ¥) are commonly quoted against the U.S. dollar 
(USD or $). Using the following quotes from Exhibit 5.11,
Currency per USD
Japanese yen
Mexican peso
USD/JPY
USD/MXN
108.84
19.9392
the Mexican importer can buy one U.S. dollar for MXN19.9392, and with that dollar can buy 
JPY108.84. The cross rate calculation would be as follows:
Japaneseyen = 1U.S.dollar
Mexicanpesos = 1U.S.dollar = ¥108.84 = $1.00
Ps19.9392 = $1.00 = ¥5.4586perpeso
The cross rate could also be calculated as the reciprocal, with the USD/MXN rate divided by 
the USD/JPY rate, yielding Ps0.1832 = ¥1.00. Cross rates often appear in various financial 
publications in the form of a matrix to simplify the math.
Intermarket Arbitrage
Cross rates can be used to check on opportunities for intermarket arbitrage. Suppose the fol￾lowing exchange rates are quoted:
Citibank quotes U.S. dollars per euro USD1.3297 = 1 EUR
Barclays Bank quotes U.S. dollars per pound sterling USD1.5585 = 1 GBP
Dresdner Bank quotes euros per pound sterling EUR1.1722 = 1 GBP
The euro-pound sterling cross rate, derived from the Citibank and Barclays Bank quotes, is
USD 1.5585 = GBP 1.00
USD 1.3297 = EUR 1.00 = EUR 1.1721 per GBP
Note that the calculated cross rate of EUR 1.1721 per GBP is not the same as Dresdner Bank’s 
quotation of EUR1.1722 = GBP1.00, so an opportunity exists to profit from arbitrage between 
the three markets. Exhibit 5.12 shows the steps in what is called triangular arbitrage.
A market trader at Citibank New York, with USD1,000,000, can sell that sum spot to 
Barclays Bank for British pounds sterling, and then in turn, sell these pounds to Dresdner 
Bank for euros. In the third and final simultaneous sale, the trader can sell the euros to 
Citibank for USD1,000,112.
M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 167 10/07/23 4:33 PM168 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
The profit on one such turn is a risk-free USD112: USD1,000,112 - USD1,000,000. We 
know that’s not much, but it’s digital! Such triangular arbitrage can continue until exchange 
rate equilibrium is reestablished. Reestablished in this case means when the calculated cross 
rate equals the actual quotation, less any tiny margin for transaction costs. This all appears 
mechanically sound and rather straightforward, but that assumes the market is not hit with 
major surprises. Global Finance in Practice 5.4 describes one case in which one of the most 
conservative governments on earth proved to be not so predictable.
Forward Quotations
Although spot rates are typically quoted on an outright basis (meaning all digits expressed), 
forward rates are, depending on the currency, typically quoted in terms of points or pips, the 
last digits of a currency quotation. Forward rates of one year or less maturity are termed cash 
rates; for longer than one-year they are called swap rates. A forward quotation expressed in 
points is not a foreign exchange rate as such. Rather it is the difference between the forward 
rate and the spot rate. Consequently, the spot rate itself can never be given on a points basis.
Consider the spot and forward point quotes in Exhibit 5.13. The bid and ask spot quotes 
are outright quotes, but the forwards are stated as points from the spot rate. The three-month 
points quotations for the Japanese yen in Exhibit 5.13 are bid and ask. The first number refers 
to points away from the spot bid, and the second number refers to points away from the spot 
ask. Given the outright quotes of 118.27 bid and 118.37 ask, the outright three-month forward 
rates are calculated as follows:
 Bid Ask
Outright spot JPY118.27 JPY118.37
Plus points (3 months) 1.43 1.40
Outright forward JPY116.84 JPY116.97

The forward bid and ask quotations of two years and longer are called swap rates. As 
mentioned earlier, many forward exchange transactions in the interbank market involve a 
simultaneous purchase for one date and sale (reversing the transaction) for another date. 
This “swap” is a way to borrow one currency for a limited time while giving up the use of an￾other currency for the same time. In other words, it is a short-term borrowing of one currency

central bank interest rates at negative levels. This meant that 
the bank charged depositors to hold Swiss franc deposits, an 
effort to dissuade investors from exchanging any currency, 
including the euro, for Swiss francs.
But the European Union’s economies continued to 
struggle in 2014, and early reports of economic activity in 
2015 were showing further slowing. Investors wished to exit 
the euro, fearing its future fall in value. The European Central 
Bank (ECB) had added to their anxiety as it had announced 
that it would be undertaking expansionary government debt 
purchases—quantitative easing (expansionary monetary pol￾icy)—to kick-start the sluggish EU economy.
On the morning of January 15, 2015, the Swiss Central 
Bank shocked the markets by announcing that it was aban￾doning the 1.20 floor and cutting interest rates further (more 
negative). It had concluded that with the forthcoming mon￾etary expansion from the ECB, there was no longer any way 
to keep the flood gates closed. The Swiss franc appreciated 
versus the euro in minutes. For two of the world’s major cur￾rencies, it was a very eventful day.
The Rocketing Swiss Franc
The Swiss franc has been fighting its appreciation against the 
euro for years. Not a member of the European Union and 
possessing one of the world’s most stable currencies for over 
a century, Switzerland is however an economy and a cur￾rency completely encased within the Eurozone.
In 2011, in an attempt stop the Swiss franc from continu￾ing to grow in value against the euro (stop its appreciation), the 
Swiss Central Bank announced a “floor” on its value against 
the euro of 1.20 Swiss francs to one euro. To preserve this 
value, the bank would intervene in the market by buying euros 
with Swiss francs anytime the market exchange rate threat￾ened to hit the floor.
In early 2015 the markets continued to try to push the 
Swiss franc’s value up against the euro (which means pushing 
its exchange value to lower than 1.20 Swiss francs per euro). 
The Swiss Central Bank continued to intervene, buying eu￾ros with Swiss francs and accumulating more and more eu￾ros in its reserves of foreign currency. The bank had also set

Summary Points
■ The three functions of the foreign exchange market are 
to transfer purchasing power, provide credit, and mini￾mize foreign exchange risk.
■ Electronic platforms and the development of sophis￾ticated trading algorithms have facilitated market ac￾cess by traders of all kinds and sizes.
■ Geographically the foreign exchange market spans 
the globe, with prices moving and currencies traded 
somewhere every hour of every business day.
■ A foreign exchange rate is the price of one currency 
expressed in terms of another currency. A foreign ex￾change quotation is a statement of willingness to buy

■ European terms quotations are the foreign currency 
price of a U.S. dollar. American terms quotations are

combined with a short-term loan of an equivalent amount of another currency. This is in fact 
why forward contracts are categorized as foreign currency loan agreements by banks. The two 
parties could, if they wanted, charge each other interest at the going rate for each of the cur￾rencies. However, it is easier for the party with the higher-interest currency to simply pay the 
net interest differential to the other. The swap rate expresses this net interest differential on a 
points basis rather than as an interest rate.
The relationship between the spot rate and the forward rate, calculated as a percent￾age difference, is called the forward premium. The forward premium, f, is the percentage 
difference between the spot and forward exchange rate, stated in annual percentage terms. 
When the foreign currency price (fc) of the home currency (hc) is used, the formula for the 
percent-per-annum forward premium is:
ffc = hc = Spot - Forward

Iceland: A Small Country in a Global 
Crisis2
There were the short story and the longer, more complex 
story. Iceland had seen both. And what was the moral of the 
story? Was the moral that it’s better to be a big fish in a little 
pond, or was it once burned, twice shy or something else?
Iceland was a country of only 300,000 people. It was 
relatively geographically isolated, but its culture and econo￾my were heavily intertwined with those of Europe. A former 
property of Denmark, it considered itself both independent 
and yet Danish. Iceland’s economy was historically driven 
by fishing and natural resource development. Although not 
flashy by any sense of the word, they had proven to be solid 
and lasting industries and, in recent years, increasingly prof￾itable. At least that was until Iceland discovered “banking.”
The Icelandic Crisis: The Short Story
Iceland’s economy had grown rapidly, so rapidly in the 
2000–2008 period that inflation—an ill of the past in most 
of the economic world—was a growing problem. As a small, 
industrialized, and open economy, capital was allowed to 
flow into and out of Iceland freely. As inflationary pressures 
rose, the Central Bank of Iceland had tightened monetary 
policy, and interest rates rose. Higher interest rates attracted 
capital from outside Iceland, primarily European capital, 
and the banking system was flooded with capital. The banks 
in turn invested heavily in everything from real estate to 
Land Rovers (or Game Overs, as they became known).
Then September 2008 happened. The global financial 
crisis, largely originating in the U.S. and its real estate-se￾curitized-mortgage-debt-credit-default-swap crisis, brought 
much of the international financial system and major indus￾trial economies to a halt. Investments failed—in the U.S., in

■ Direct and indirect are not synonyms for American and 
European terms, because the home currency will change 
depending on who is doing the calculation, while European 
terms are always the foreign currency price of a dollar.
■ A cross rate is an exchange rate between two currencies, 
calculated from their common relationships with a third 
currency. When cross rates differ from the direct rates 
between two currencies, intermarket arbitrage is possible.

banks AAA. Capital flowed into Icelandic banks, and the 
banks in turn funneled that capital into all possible invest￾ments (and loans) domestically and internationally. Ice￾land’s banks created Ice-save, an Internet banking system 
to reach out to depositors in Great Britain and the Nether￾lands. It worked. Iceland’s bank balance sheets grew 100% 
of GDP in 2003 to just below 1,000% of GDP by 2008.
Iceland’s banks were now more international than Ice￾landic. (By the end of 2007 their total deposits were 45% 
in British pounds, 22% Icelandic krona, 16% euro, 3% dol￾lar, and 14% other.) Icelandic real estate and equity prices 
boomed. Increased consumer and business spending result￾ed in growth in merchandise and service imports, while the 
rising krona depressed exports. The merchandise service 
and income balances in the current account all went into 
deficit. Behaving like an emerging market country that had 
just discovered oil, Icelanders dropped their fishing hooks, 
abandoned their boats, and became bankers. Everyone 
wanted a piece of the pie, and the pie appeared to be grow￾ing at an infinite rate. Everyone could become rich.
Then, without notice, the economic and banking 
boom stopped. What caused the sudden crash, whether 
it was the failure of Lehman Brothers in New York or 
something else, we may never know. But beginning in Sep￾tember 2008 the krona started falling and capital started 
fleeing. Interest rates were increased even further to try to 
entice (or “bribe”) money to stay in Iceland and in krona. 
None of it worked. As illustrated by Exhibit B, the krona’s 
fall was large, dramatic, and somewhat permanent. In ret￾rospect, the 2006 crisis had been only a ripple; 2008 proved 
to be a tsunami.
Now those same interest rates, which had been driven 
up by both markets and policy, prevented any form of re￾newal; mortgage loans were either impossible to get or im￾possible to afford, and business loans were too expensive 
given the new limited business outlook. The international 
interbank market, which had largely frozen up during the 
midst of the crisis in September and October 2008, now 
treated the Icelandic financial sector like a leper. As illus￾trated by Exhibit C, interest rates had a long way to fall to 
reach earth. (The Central Bank of Iceland’s overnight rate 
rose to well over 20%.)
Aftermath: The Policy Response
There is a common precept observed by governments and 
central banks when they fall victim to financial crises: save 
the banks. Regardless of whether the banks and bankers 
were considered the cause of the crisis or complicit (one Ice￾landic central banker termed them “the usual suspects”), it is 
common belief that all economies need a functioning bank￾ing system in order to have any hope for business rebirth 
and employment recovery. This was the same rule used in 
the U.S. in the 1930s and across South Asia in 1997 and 1998.
But the Icelandic people did not prescribe to the usu￾al medicinal solutions. Their preference: let the banks fail. 
Europe, in Iceland. Loans to finance those bad investments 
fell delinquent. The Icelandic economy and its currency—
the krona—collapsed. As illustrated in Exhibit A, the krona 
fell more than 40% against the euro in roughly 30 days and 
more than 50% in 90 days. Companies failed, banks failed, 
unemployment grew, and inflation boomed.
The Icelandic Crisis: The Longer Story
The longer story of Iceland’s crisis has its roots in the 
mid-1990s, when Iceland, like many other major industrial 
economies, embraced privatization and deregulation. The 
financial sector, once completely owned and operated by 
government, was privatized and largely deregulated by 2003. 
Home mortgages were deregulated in 2003; new mortgages 
required only a 10% down payment. Investment—foreign 
direct investment (FDI)—flowed into Iceland rapidly. A 
large part of the new investment was in aluminum produc￾tion, an energy-intensive process that could utilize much 
of Iceland’s natural (after massive damn construction) hy￾droelectric power. But FDI of all kinds also flowed into the 
country, including household and business capital.
The new Icelandic financial sector was dominated by 
three banks: Glitnir, Kaupthing, and Landsbanki Islands. 
Their opportunities for growth and profitability seemed 
unlimited, both domestically and internationally. Iceland’s 
membership in the European Economic Area (EEA) pro￾vided the Icelandic banks a financial passport to expand 
their reach throughout the greater European marketplace. 
As capital flowed into Iceland rapidly in 2003–2006, the 
krona rose, increasing the purchasing power of Iceland￾ers but raising concerns with investors and government. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) had grown at 8% in 2004 
and 6% in 2005 and was still above 4% by 2006. While the 
average unemployment rate of the major economic pow￾ers was roughly 6%, Iceland’s overheating economy had 
only 3% unemployment. But rapid economic growth in 
a small economy, as happens frequently in economic his￾tory, stoked inflation. And the Icelandic government and 
central bank then applied the standard prescription: slow 
money supply growth to try to control inflationary forces. 
The result—as expected—was higher interest rates.
Lessons Not Learned
Brennt barn forðast eldinn.
(A burnt child keeps away from fire.)
—Icelandic proverb.
The mini-shock suffered by Iceland in 2006 was short-lived, 
and investors and markets quickly shook off its effects. 
Bank lending returned, and within two years the Icelan￾dic economy was in more trouble than ever. In 2007 and 
2008 Iceland’s interest rates continued to rise—both mar￾ket rates (like bank overnight rates) and central bank pol￾icy rates. Global credit agencies rated the major Icelandic

M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 173 10/07/23 4:33 PMTaking to the streets in what was called the pots and pans 
revolution, the people wanted no part of the banks, the 
bankers, the bank regulators, or even the prime minister. 
The logic was some combination of “allow free markets 
to work” and “I want some revenge.” This is actually quite 
similar to what many analysts have debated over what 
happened in the U.S. at the same time when the U.S. gov￾ernment let Lehman go.
In contrast to the bank bailouts in the U.S. in 2008 
following the onset of the financial crisis undertaken un￾der the mantra of “too big to fail,” Iceland’s banks were 
considered “too big to save.” Each of the three major 
banks, which had all been effectively nationalized by the 
second week of October 2008, was closed. As illustrated 
in Exhibit D, although Iceland’s bank assets and exter￾nal liabilities were large and had grown rapidly, Iceland 
was not alone. Each failed bank was reorganized by the 
government into a good bank and a bad bank in terms 
of assets but not combined into singular good banks and 
bad banks.
The governing authorities surviving in office in the 
fall of 2008 undertook a three-point emergency plan: (1) 
stabilize the exchange rate, (2) regain fiscal sustainability, 
and (3) rebuild the financial sector. The primary tool was 
capital controls. Iceland shut down the borders and the In￾ternet lines for moving capital into or out of the country. 
The most immediate problem was the exchange rate. The 
falling krona had decimated purchasing power, and the ris￾ing prices of imported goods were adding even more infla￾tionary pressure.
Given the substantial macroeconomic risks, capital 
controls were an unfortunate but indispensable ingre￾dient in the policy mix that was adopted to stabilise the 
króna when the interbank foreign-exchange market 
was restarted in early December 2008.
 —Capital Control Liberalisation, 
Central Bank of Iceland, August 5, 2009, p. 2.
The bank failures (without bailout) raised serious and con￾tentious discussions between Iceland and other authori￾ties in the UK, the EU, the Netherlands, and elsewhere. 
Because so many of the deposits in Iceland banks were 
from foreign depositors, home-country authorities wanted 
assurance that their citizens’ financial assets would be pro￾tected. In Iceland, although the government guaranteed 
domestic residents that their money was insured (up to a 
limit), foreign depositors were not. Foreign residents hold￾ing accounts with Icelandic financial institutions were pro￾hibited from pulling the money out of Iceland and out of 
the krona.

M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 174 10/07/23 4:33 PMCapital controls were introduced in October—upon 
the recommendation of the IMF—and then altered and 
magnified in revisions in November and December 2008 
and again in March 2009.
Payments linked to current account transactions and 
inward FDI were released after a short period of time. 
Thus, transactions involving actual imports and ex￾ports of goods and services are allowed and so are in￾terest payments, if exchanged within a specified time 
limit. Most capital transactions are controlled both for 
residents and non-residents; that is, their ability to shift 
between ISK and FX is restricted. Króna-denominated 
bonds and other like instruments cannot be converted 
to foreign currency upon maturity. The proceeds must 
be reinvested in other ISK instruments. Furthermore, 
the Rules require residents to repatriate all foreign cur￾rency that they acquire.
 —Capital Control Liberalisation, 
Central Bank of Iceland, August 5, 2009, p. 23.
It also turned out that the crisis itself was not such a big 
surprise. The Central Bank of Iceland had approached the 
European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England, and 
the U.S. Federal Reserve in the spring of 2008 (months 
before the crisis erupted), hoping to arrange foreign ex￾change swap agreements in case its foreign exchange re￾serves proved inadequate. The answer was no, basically 
summarized as “talk to the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF).” In the end, the IMF did indeed help, providing a 
Stand-By Arrangement to provide favorable access to for￾eign capital.
The krona’s value was stabilized, as seen previously in 
Exhibit B, but has stayed weaker, which has helped return 
the merchandise trade account to surplus in subsequent 
years. Inflation took a bit longer to get under control but 
was successfully cut to near 2% by the end of 2010. Iceland 
remains a heavily indebted Lilliputian country (according 
to the Financial Times), in both public debt and private 
debt as a percentage of GDP.
20/20 Hindsight
Interestingly, in the years since the crisis, there has been a 
reversal (or, as one writer described it, 20/20/20/20 hind￾sight) in the assessment of Iceland’s response to the crisis. 
In the first few years, it was believed that Iceland’s recov￾ery would be shorter and stronger than other European 
countries falling into crisis in 2009 and 2010, like Ireland, 
Estonia, and others. But then, after a few more years of ex￾perience, revised hindsight concluded that Iceland’s recov￾ery has been slower, weaker, and less successful than that 
of others, partly a result of allowing the banks to fail, partly 
a result of the country’s “addiction” to capital controls.
What are the lessons to be taken from the Icelandic 
saga? Deregulation of the financial system is risky? Banks 
and bankers are not to be trusted? Cross-border banking 
is risky? Inadequate cross-border banking regulations al￾low banks to borrow too much where they shouldn’t and 
invest too much where they shouldn’t? Bank loan books 
and bank capital need to be regulated? Small countries 
cannot conduct independent monetary policy? Small fish 
should not swim in big ponds? Or . . . 
The paper concludes that, to prevent future crises of 
similar proportions, it is impossible for a small coun￾try to have a large international banking sector, its own 
currency and an independent monetary policy.

Consequences and Implications,” Rob Spruk, European

MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. Do you think a country the size of Iceland—a 
Lilliputian—is more or less sensitive to the potential 
impacts of global capital movements?
2. Many countries have used interest rate increases to 
protect their currencies for many years. What are the 
pros and cons of using this strategy?
3. How does the Iceland story fit with our understand￾ing of the impossible trinity? In your opinion, which 
of the three elements of the trinity should Iceland 
have taken steps to control more?
4. In the case of Iceland, the country was able to sustain 
a large current account deficit for several years and 
at the same time have ever-rising interest rates and 
a stronger and stronger currency. Then one day, it all 
changed. How does that happen?

M05B_EITE5960_16_GE_C05.indd 179 10/07/23 4:33 PMLEARNING OBJECTIVES
6.1 Examine how price levels and price level changes (inflation) in countries determine 
the exchange rates at which their currencies are traded
6.2 Show how interest rates reflect inflationary forces within each country and drive 
currency exchange rates
6.3 Explain how forward markets for currencies reflect expectations held by market 
participants about the future spot exchange rate
6.4 Analyze how, in equilibrium, the spot and forward currency markets are aligned with 
interest differentials and differentials in expected inflation
What are the determinants of exchange rates? Are changes in exchange rates predictable? 
Managers of MNEs, international portfolio investors, importers and exporters, and govern￾ment officials must deal with these fundamental questions every day. This chapter describes 
the core financial theories surrounding the determination of exchange rates. Chapter 7 will 
demonstrate how these core elements are combined to create foreign currency derivatives, 
while Chapter 8 will introduce two other major theoretical schools of thought regarding cur￾rency valuation and then demonstrate how the three different theories are combined in a 
variety of real-world applications.
The economic theories that link exchange rates, price levels, and interest rates are called 
international parity conditions. In the eyes of many, international parity conditions form the 
core of the financial theory that is considered unique to the field of international finance. 
These theories do not always work out to be “true” when compared to what students and 
practitioners observe in the real world, but they are central to any understanding of how 
multinational business is conducted and funded in the world today. And, as is often the case, 
the mistake is not always in the theory itself, but in the way it is interpreted or applied in 
practice. This chapter concludes with the mini-case Mrs. Watanabe and the Japanese Yen Carry 
Trade, which demonstrates how both the theory and practice of international parity condi￾tions sometimes combine to form unusual opportunities for profit—for those who are willing 
to bear the risk!
... if capital freely flowed towards those countries where it could be most profitably 
employed, there could be no difference in the rate of profit, and no other difference in the 
real or labour price of commodities, than the additional quantity of labour required to 
convey them to the various markets where they were to be sold.
—David Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, 1817, Chapter 7.

6.1 Prices and Exchange Rates
If identical products or services can be sold in two different markets and no restrictions exist 
on the sale or transportation of product between markets, the price should be the same in 
both markets. This is called the law of one price.
A primary principle of competitive markets is that prices will equalize across markets if 
frictions or costs of moving the products or services between markets do not exist. If a prod￾uct is sold in two markets in two different countries, that product’s price may be stated in dif￾ferent currency terms, but the price of the product should still be the same. Comparing prices 
would require only a conversion from one currency to the other. For example,
P$ * S¥ = $1.00 = P¥
where the price of the product in U.S. dollars, P$
, is multiplied by the spot exchange rate, 
S¥ = $1.00
 (yen per U.S. dollar), equals the price of the product in Japanese yen, P¥
. Conversely, 
if the prices of the two products were stated in local currencies and markets were efficient at 
competing away a higher price in one market relative to the other, the exchange rate could be 
deduced from the relative local product prices:
S¥ = $1.00 = P¥
P$
Purchasing Power Parity and the Law of One Price
If the law of one price were true for all goods and services, the purchasing power parity (PPP) 
exchange rate could be found from any individual set of prices. By comparing the prices of 
identical products denominated in different currencies, one could determine the “real” or 
PPP exchange rate that should exist if markets were efficient. This is the absolute version of 
purchasing power parity. Absolute purchasing power parity states that the spot exchange rate 
is determined by the relative prices of similar baskets of goods.
The “Big Mac Index,” as it has been christened by The Economist (see Exhibit 6.1) and 
calculated regularly since 1986, is a prime example of the law of one price. Assuming that 
the Big Mac is indeed identical in all countries listed, it serves as one form of comparison of 
whether currencies are currently trading at market rates that are close to the exchange rate 
implied by Big Macs in local currencies.
For example, using Exhibit 6.1, in China a Big Mac costs Yuan22.4 (local currency), 
while in the United States the same Big Mac costs $5.66. The actual spot exchange rate was 
Yuan6.4751 = $1.00 at this time. The price of a Big Mac in China in U.S. dollar terms was 
therefore:
PriceofBigMac inChinainYuan
Yuan = US$ 1.00spotrate = Yuan22.4
Yuan6.4751 = US$ 1.00 = US$3.46
This is the value in column 3 of Exhibit 6.1 for China. We then calculate the implied 
purchasing power parity rate of exchange using the actual price of the Big Mac in China 
(Yuan22.4) over the price of the Big Mac in the United States in U.S. dollars (US$5.66):
PriceofBigMac inChinainYuan
PriceofBigMac inUSin $ = Yuan22.4
US$ 5.66 = orYuan3.9576 = US$1.00
This is the value in column 4 of Exhibit 6.1 for China. In principle, this is what the Big Mac Index 
is saying the exchange rate between the Yuan and the dollar should be according to the theory.
M06_EITE5960_16_GE_C06.indd 181 08/05/23 9:28 AM182 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Now comparing this implied PPP rate of exchange, Yuan3.9576 = US$1.00, with the 
actual market rate of exchange at that time, Yuan6.4751 = US$1.00, the degree to which the 
yuan is either undervalued 1- %2 or overvalued 1+%2 versus the U.S. dollar is calculated as 
follows:
ImpliedRate - ActualRate
ActualRate = Yuan3.9576 - Yuan6.4751
Yuan6.4751 ≈ -38.9%
In this case, the Big Mac Index indicates that the Chinese yuan is undervalued by 38.9% 
versus the U.S. dollar as indicated in column 5 for China in Exhibit 6.1. The Economist is 
also quick to note that although this indicates a sizable undervaluation of the managed value 
of the Chinese yuan versus the dollar, the theory of purchasing power parity is supposed to 
indicate where the value of currencies should go over the long term and not necessarily its 
value today.
It is important to understand why the Big Mac may be a good candidate for the applica￾tion of the law of one price and for the measurement of under- or overvaluation. First, the 
product itself is nearly identical in each market. This is the result of product consistency, pro￾cess excellence, and McDonald’s brand image and pride. Second, and just as important, the 
product is a result of predominantly local materials and input costs. This means that its price 
in each country is representative of domestic costs and prices and not imported ones, which 
would be influenced by exchange rates themselves.
The index, however, still possesses limitations. Big Macs cannot be traded across borders, 
and costs and prices are influenced by a variety of other factors in each country market, such

as real estate rental rates and taxes. That said, the prominence and weight the Big Mac Index 
has had globally is undeniable.
A less extreme form of this principle asserts that in relatively efficient markets, the price 
of a basket of goods—rather than a single product—would be the same in each market. 
Replacing the price of a single product with a price index allows the PPP exchange rate be￾tween two countries to be stated as
S = PI ¥
PI $
where PI ¥ andPI $
 are price indices expressed in local currency for Japan and the United 
States, respectively. For example, if the identical basket of goods cost ¥1,000 in Japan and $10 
in the United States, the PPP exchange rate would be
¥100
$10 or ¥100 = US$1.00
Relative Purchasing Power Parity
If the assumptions of the absolute version of PPP theory are relaxed a bit, we observe what is 
termed relative purchasing power parity. Relative PPP holds that PPP is not particularly help￾ful in determining what the spot rate is today, but that the relative change in prices between 
two countries over a period of time determines the change in the exchange rate over that 
period. More specifically:
If the spot exchange rate between two countries starts in equilibrium, any change in the dif￾ferential rate of inflation between them tends to be offset over the long run by an equal but 
opposite change in the spot exchange rate.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 6.1
and INR 12.64 per MYR. The actual spot rate among these 
currencies, at the same time were INR 58.41 per SGD, MYR 
3.34 per SGD, and INR17.44 per MYR.
As you can see that the exchange rate parity does not 
hold in this case. This is because the taxi fare in a given city 
tend to be a very politically sensitive topic affected by local 
regulation. For example, taxi fares in Mumbai are authorized 
by the local municipal authority. Due to this regulatory regime, 
Uber in Mumbai is not allowed to increase taxi fares beyond 
a certain limit under surge pricing, no matter how big the de￾mand for rides is.
You may also note from the table of taxi fares is that 
Singapore has the most expensive taxi rides for a given dis￾tance. As the taxi fares also include a component of wage for 
the taxi driver, the level of hourly wage rate also influences 
taxi price. As Singapore wages are highest among the three 
cities, the cost of taxi ride for similar distance is also highest, 
almost twice as much it is in Mumbai.
Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics: Uber Fare as the 
Basis for Exchange Rate Parity
Tackling inflation has remained one of the top priorities for gov￾ernments. Once inflation is embedded in the expectations of the 
society, and possibly becomes institutionalized through auto￾matic price-index based price increases, it is very hard to control. 
One of the most common anti-inflation measures used by the 
government is the price-controls, where a government agency 
sets prices for given products to prevent prices from rising.
Let’s see if such price controls distort the exchange rate 
parity among different currencies. We obtained taxi fare esti￾mate for a very identical ride in the three South East Asian 
cities, Mumbai, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. If you hire an 
Uber for a 10 km ride, it will cost you INR 316.14 in Mumbai, 
SGD 14.30 in Singapore, and MYR 25 in Kuala Lumpur.
Assuming the exchange rate parity holds, the implied

The logic behind the application of PPP to changes in the spot exchange rate is that 
if a country experiences inflation rates higher than those of its main trading partners, and 
its exchange rate does not change, its exports of goods and services become less competi￾tive with comparable products produced elsewhere. Imports from abroad become more 
price-competitive with higher-priced domestic products. These price changes lead to a deficit 
on the current account in the balance of payments unless offset by capital and financial flows.
Empirical Tests of Purchasing Power Parity
There has been extensive testing of both the absolute and relative versions of purchasing 
power parity and the law of one price. These tests have, for the most part, not proved PPP to 
be accurate in predicting future exchange rates. Goods and services do not in reality move 
at zero cost between countries, and in fact many services are not “tradable,” for example, for 
haircuts. Many goods and services are not of the same quality across countries, reflecting dif￾ferences in the tastes and resources of the countries of their manufacture and consumption.
Two general conclusions can be made from these tests: (1) PPP holds up well over the 
very long run but poorly for shorter time periods, and (2) the theory holds better for coun￾tries with relatively high rates of inflation and underdeveloped capital markets.
Exchange Rate Indices: Real and Nominal
Because any single country trades with numerous partners, we need to track and evaluate its 
individual currency value against all other currency values in order to determine relative pur￾chasing power. The objective is to discover whether a country’s exchange rate is “overvalued” 
or “undervalued” in terms of PPP. One of the primary methods of dealing with this problem is 
the calculation of exchange rate indices. These indices are formed through trade—by weight￾ing the bilateral exchange rates between the home country and its trading partners.
The nominal effective exchange rate index uses actual exchange rates to create an index, 
on a weighted average basis, of the value of the subject currency over time. It does not really 
indicate anything about the “true value” of the currency or anything related to PPP. The nomi￾nal index simply calculates how the currency value relates to some arbitrarily chosen base 
period, but it is used in the formation of the real effective exchange rate index. The real effective 
exchange rate index indicates how the weighted average purchasing power of the currency has 
changed relative to some arbitrarily selected base period. Exhibit 6.2 plots the real effective 
exchange rate indexes for Japan, the euro area, and the U.S. for the 1980–2021 period.
The real effective exchange rate index for the U.S. dollar, E$
R, is found by multiplying the 
nominal effective exchange rate index, E$
N, by the ratio of U.S. dollar costs, C$
, over foreign 
currency costs, CFC, both in index form:
E$
R = E$
N *
C$
CFC
If changes in exchange rates just offset differential inflation rates—if purchasing power 
parity holds—all the real effective exchange rate indices would stay at 100. If an exchange 
rate strengthened more than was justified by differential inflation, its index would rise above 
100. If the real effective exchange rate index were above 100, the currency would be consid￾ered “overvalued” from a competitive perspective, and vice versa.
Exhibit 6.2 shows how the real effective exchange rate of the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, 
and the European euro have changed over the past 40 years. The dollar’s index value was sub￾stantially above 100 in the early 1980s (overvalued), falling below 100 during the 1988–1996 
period (undervalued), then rising far above 100 since 2014. While the euro has not strayed 
far from “proper valuation” since 2009, the Japanese yen has bounced from undervalued to 
M06_EITE5960_16_GE_C06.indd 184 08/05/23 9:28 AMCHAPTER 6 International Parity Conditions 185
overvalued to undervalued again over the past decade. Apart from measuring deviations from 
PPP, a country’s real effective exchange rate is an important tool for management when pre￾dicting upward or downward pressure on a country’s balance of payments and exchange rate, 
as well as an indicator of whether producing for export in that country could be competitive.
Exchange Rate Pass-Through
Exchange rate pass-through is a measure of the response of imported and exported prod￾uct prices to changes in exchange rates. When that pass-through is partial, meaning the full 
percentage change in the exchange rate is not reflected in prices, a country’s real effective 
exchange rate index can deviate from its PPP equilibrium level of 100. Although PPP implies 
that all exchange rate changes are passed through by equivalent changes in prices to trad￾ing partners, empirical research in the years following the growth in floating-rate currencies 
questioned this long-held assumption.
Complete versus Partial Pass-Through. To illustrate exchange rate pass-through, as￾sume that Volvo produces an automobile in Belgium and pays all production expenses in 
euros. The price of this specific model is €50,000. When the firm exports the auto to the 
United States, the price of the Volvo in the U.S. market should simply be the euro value con￾verted to U.S. dollars at the spot exchange rate:
P$
Volvo = P€
Volvo * S$ = €1.00
where PVolvo$ is the Volvo price in dollars, PVolvo€ is the Volvo price in euros, and S
$ = €1.00
 is the 
spot exchange rate in number of dollars per euro. If the euro were to appreciate 20% ver￾sus the U.S. dollar—from $1.00 = €1.00 to $1.20 = €1.00 the price of the Volvo in the U.S.

market should theoretically rise to $60,000. If the price in dollars increases by the same per￾centage change as the exchange rate, then there has been complete pass-through (or 100%) 
of changes in exchange rates.

However, if Volvo worried that a price increase of this magnitude in the U.S. market 
would severely decrease sales volumes, it might work to prevent the dollar price of this model 
from rising the full amount in the U.S. market. If the price of this same Volvo model rose to 
only $58,000 in the U.S. market, the percentage increase would be less than the 20% appre￾ciation of the euro versus the dollar.

If the price in U.S. dollars rises by less than the percentage change in exchange rates (as is 
often the case in international trade), then there has been only partial pass-through of ex￾change rate changes.
For example, components and raw materials imported to Belgium cost less in euros when 
the euro appreciates versus the currency of foreign suppliers. It is also likely that some time 
may pass before all exchange rate changes are finally reflected in the prices of traded goods, 
including the period over which previously signed contracts are delivered upon. It is obvi￾ously in the interest of Volvo to do what it can to prevent appreciation of the euro from rais￾ing the price of its automobiles in major export markets.
Price Elasticity of Demand. The concept of price elasticity of demand is useful when de￾termining the desired degree of pass-through. Recall that the price elasticity of demand for 
any good is the percentage change in quantity of the good demanded as a result of the per￾centage change in the good’s price:
Priceelasticityofdemand = ep = %∆Qd
%∆P
where Qd is quantity demanded and P is product price. If the absolute value of ep is less 
than 1.0, then the good is relatively “inelastic.” If ep is greater than 1.0, the good is relatively 
“elastic.”
A Belgian product that is relatively price-inelastic—meaning that the quantity de￾manded is relatively unresponsive to price changes—may often demonstrate a high degree of 
passthrough. This is because a higher dollar price in the United States market would have lit￾tle noticeable effect on the quantity of the product demanded by consumers. Dollar revenue 
would increase, but euro revenue would remain the same. However, products that are rela￾tively price-elastic would respond in the opposite way. If the 20% euro appreciation resulted 
in 20% higher dollar prices, U.S. consumers would decrease the number of Volvos purchased. 
If the price elasticity of demand for Volvos in the United States were greater than one, total 
dollar sales revenue of Volvos would decline.
Pass-Through and Emerging Market Currencies. A number of emerging market coun￾tries have chosen in recent years to change their objectives and choices, as described in the 
impossible trinity (introduced and detailed previously in Chapter 2). These countries have 
shifted from choosing a pegged exchange rate and independent monetary policy over the free 
flow of capital (point A in Exhibit 6.3) to policies allowing more capital flows at the expense 
of a pegged or fixed exchange rate (toward point C in Exhibit 6.3).
M06_EITE5960_16_GE_C06.indd 186 08/05/23 9:28 AMCHAPTER 6 International Parity Conditions 187
This change in focus has also now introduced exchange rate pass-through as an issue in 
these same emerging markets. With changing exchange rates and increased trade and finan￾cial product movements in and out of these countries, prices are changing. Although price 
volatility alone is a source of growing concern, price changes contributing to inflationary 
pressure is even more unsettling. The root cause of these problems lies not with choices made 
by the emerging market nations but rather with the interest rate choices made by the major 
industrial countries with which they trade.
Since 2009, all the major industrial country currency markets—the dollar, the euro, the 
yen—have been characterized by extremely low interest rates, as concerns over economic 
growth and employment have dominated. Select emerging market countries have then ex￾perienced appreciating currencies in some cases (because their interest rates are higher than 
industrial country currencies). Those exchange rate changes have led to exchange rate 
pass-through of imported products—rising prices—contributing to inflationary pressures.
6.2 Interest Rates and Exchange Rates
We have already seen how prices of goods in different countries should be related through 
exchange rates. We now consider how interest rates are linked to exchange rates.
The Fisher Effect
The Fisher effect, named after economist Irving Fisher, states that nominal interest rates in 
each country are equal to the required real rate of return plus compensation for expected 
inflation. More formally, this is derived from 11 + r2 11 + p2 - 1 as
i = r + p + r p
where i is the nominal rate of interest, r is the real rate of interest, and p is the expected rate 
of inflation over the period of time for which funds are to be lent. The final compound term, 
rp is frequently dropped from consideration due to its relatively minor value. The Fisher 
effect then reduces to (approximate form):
i = r + p
Many emerging market countries have chosen to move from Point A to Point C, exchanging fixed exchange rates for the chance of
attracting capital inflows. The result is that these countries are now the subject to varying levels of exchange rate pass-through.

The Fisher effect applied to the United States and Japan would be as follows:

$ = r$ + p$
; i
¥ = r¥ + p¥
where the superscripts $ and ¥ pertain to the respective nominal (i), real (r), and ex￾pected inflation 1p2 components of financial instruments denominated in dollars and yen, 
respectively.
We need to forecast the future rate of inflation, not what inflation has been. Predicting 
the future is, well, difficult. Empirical tests using ex post national inflation rates have shown 
that the Fisher effect usually exists for short-maturity government securities, such as Treasury 
bills and notes. Comparisons based on longer maturities suffer from the increased financial 
risk inherent in fluctuations of the market value of the bonds prior to maturity. Comparisons 
of private sector securities are influenced by unequal creditworthiness of the issuers. All the 
tests are inconclusive to the extent that recent past rates of inflation are not a correct mea￾sure of future expected inflation.
The International Fisher Effect
The relationship between the percentage change in the spot exchange rate over time and the 
differential between comparable interest rates in different national capital markets is known 
as the international Fisher effect. Fisher-open, as it is often termed, states that the spot ex￾change rate should change in an equal amount but in the opposite direction to the difference 
in interest rates between two countries. More formally,
S1 - S2
S2
* 100 = i
$ - i
¥
where i
$
 and i
¥
 are the respective national interest rates, and S is the spot exchange rate using 
indirect quotes (an indirect quote on the dollar is, for example, ¥ = $1.00) at the beginning 
of the period 1S1 2 and the end of the period 1S2 2. This is the approximation form commonly 
used in industry. The precise formulation is as follows:
S1 - S2
S2
= i
$ - i
¥
1 + i
¥
Justification for the international Fisher effect is that investors must be rewarded or pe￾nalized to offset the expected change in exchange rates. For example, if a dollar-based inves￾tor buys a 10-year yen bond earning 4% interest, instead of a 10-year dollar bond earning 6% 
interest, the investor must be expecting the yen to appreciate vis-à-vis the dollar by at least 
2% per year during the 10 years. If not, the dollar-based investor would be better off remain￾ing in dollars. If the yen appreciates 3% during the 10-year period, the dollar-based investor 
would earn a bonus of 1% higher return. However, the international Fisher effect predicts 
that, with unrestricted capital flows, an investor should be indifferent to whether his bond is 
in dollars or yen, because investors worldwide would see the same opportunity and compete 
it away.
Empirical tests lend some support to the relationship postulated by the international 
Fisher effect, although considerable short-run deviations occur. A more serious criticism has 
been posed, however, by recent studies that suggest the existence of a foreign exchange risk 
premium for some major currencies. Also, speculation in uncovered interest arbitrage creates 
distortions in currency markets. Thus, the expected change in exchange rates might consis￾tently be greater than the difference in interest rates. Global Finance in Practice 6.2 explores 
a key dimension of international Fisher, the distinction between high inflation and high real 
rates of interest in attracting capital.

The Forward Rate
A forward rate (or outright forward as described in Chapter 5) is an exchange rate quoted 
today for settlement at some future date. A forward exchange agreement between currencies 
states the rate of exchange at which a foreign currency will be “bought forward” or “sold for￾ward” at a specific date in the future (typically after 30, 60, 90, 180, 270, or 360 days).
The forward rate is calculated for any specific maturity by adjusting the current spot ex￾change rate by the ratio of euro currency interest rates of the same maturity for the two sub￾ject currencies. For example, the 90-day forward rate for the Swiss franc/U.S. dollar exchange 
rate (FS = /$
90) is found by multiplying the current spot rate 1SSF = $ 2 by the ratio of the 
90-day euro-Swiss franc deposit rate 1i

lends or borrows from commercial banks) went from 0.25% 
at the beginning of 2022 to 3% by September 2022, it also 
resulted into increased cost of borrowing in the bond market 
for the government.
The combination of increased cost of borrowing and a 
plan to siphon of more liquidity from the market, increased 
the return offered by the gilt-edged bonds. In a normal sce￾nario, this increased return offered by the Government bonds 
should attract more foreign capital in the country. However, 
this did not happen. Factors like the war in Ukraine and the 
increase in cost of energy, made people speculate about a 
quick recovery of U.K. market, resulting in depressed de￾mand for British pound.
As the pound is one of the reserved currencies, its sta￾bility is very important for the international forex markets. The 
increased borrowing plan made the regulators across the 
world uncomfortable and raised questions about the coun￾try’s debt sustainability in the end. It is important to note that 
despite this significant increase in return offered by the U.K. 
government bonds, the inflow of funds from foreign markets 
remained at the same level as it was before during this pe￾riod, undermining the impact of these measures.
Are foreign Capital Inflow and Interest Rate 
Directly Related?
One of the biggest challenges faced by governments and 
central banks historically is how to balance economic growth, 
inflationary forces and expectations, and the “right” value of
their currency. An increase in interest rate is supposed to 
make currency more attractive for foreign investors as they 
can earn relatively higher return on investments made in 
that currency. However, as noted in section 6.2, there may 
be considerable short-term deviations, as witnessed by the 
United Kingdom in 2022.
In October 2022, the United Kingdom experienced a 
rapid increase in inflation to up to 10% from a previous 2%. 
The Bank of England (BoE) decided to tighten the money 
supply by issuing bonds at higher interest rates. This mon￾etary plan added further £200 billion to the sovereign debt 
over the next four years until 2026. This increased the total 
outstanding U.K. government bonds by more than 20%, 
which amounted to £875 billion in November 2022 before 
this event. The official indicator of BoE’s official rate for its 
short term deals in the money market (the rate at which BoE

The forward premium or discount, f, is the percentage difference between the spot and 
forward exchange rate, stated in annual percentage terms. When the foreign currency price of 
the home currency is used, as in this case of SF = $, the formula for the percent-per-annum 
forward premium or discount on the Swiss franc, f SF, becomes:
f SF = Spot - Forward

The sign is positive, indicating that the Swiss franc is selling forward at a 3.96% per annum pre￾mium over the dollar. (It takes 3.96% more dollars to get a franc at the 90-day forward rate.)
As illustrated in Exhibit 6.4, the forward premium on the eurodollar forward arises from 
the differential between eurodollar and Swiss franc interest rates. Because the forward rate 
for any particular maturity utilizes the specific interest rates for that term, the forward pre￾mium or discount on a currency is visually obvious—the currency with the higher interest 
rate (in this case the U.S. dollar)—will sell forward at a discount, and the currency with the 
lower interest rate (here the Swiss franc) will sell forward at a premium.
The forward rate is calculated from three observable data items—the spot rate, the for￾eign currency deposit rate, and the home currency deposit rate—and is not a forecast of the 
future spot exchange. However, the forward rate is frequently used as a forecast by managers, 
yielding mixed results, as the following section describes.
Calculation of Forward Premiums
The percent per annum deviation of the forward from the spot rate is termed the forward pre￾mium. However, as with the calculation of percentage changes in spot rates, the forward pre￾mium—which may be either a positive (a premium) or negative value (a discount)—depends

The sign is positive indicating that the Japanese yen is selling forward at a premium of 4.90%

Forward rates have been a pillar of multinational financial management for 50 years. 
Their rates or values, however, have structurally changed—fallen—as short-term money mar￾ket interest rates have trended downward over time. That trend, described in Global Finance 
in Practice 6.3, continues.
Interest Rate Parity (IRP)
The theory of interest rate parity (IRP) provides the link between the foreign exchange mar￾kets and the international money markets. The theory states:
The difference in the national interest rates for securities of similar risk and maturity should 
be equal to, but opposite in sign to, the forward rate discount or premium for the foreign 
currency, except for transaction costs.
Exhibit 6.5 shows how the theory of IRP works. Assume that an investor has $1,000,000

First, major economies like those of the United Kingdom and 
United States suffered and then rid themselves of inflationary 
forces, the π. The source of that inflation was primarily that 
of political economy—economic stimulus in the pursuit of full 
employment. Those same concerns gave birth to the next 
downward drive in interest rates, the fall to near-zero in the 
real return to capital, r, in the aftermath of the global financial 
crisis of 2008–2010. And just when interest rates started to 
claw their way up from zero, the global pandemic of 2020 
forced governments to open up the monetary spigots once 
more.
Global Money Market Interest Rates, 1986–2021
The price of money has clearly gotten cheaper over the past 
four decades. The most commonly used reference rate of 
interest for bank loans and financial derivatives, the 3-month 
London Interbank Offered Rate or LIBOR, has clearly 
trended down for three of the world’s largest business￾based currencies, the U.S. dollar, British pound sterling, and 
Japanese yen. 
The drivers of change in the levels of these three major

chooses to invest in a dollar money market instrument, the investor would earn the dollar 
rate of interest. This results in (1 + i

) at the end of the period, where i
$
 is the dollar rate of 
interest in decimal form.
The investor may, however, choose to invest in a Swiss franc money market instrument 
of identical risk and maturity for the same period. This action would require that the in￾vestor exchange the dollars for francs at the spot rate, invest the francs in a money market 
M06_EITE5960_16_GE_C06.indd 192 08/05/23 9:28 AMCHAPTER 6 International Parity Conditions 193
instrument, sell the francs forward (in order to avoid any risk that the exchange rate would 
change), and at the end of the period convert the resulting proceeds back to dollars. A 
dollar-based investor would evaluate the relative returns of starting in the top-left corner 
and investing in the dollar market (straight across the top of the box) compared to corner. 
The comparison of returns would be as follows:
(1 + i
$
) = SSF = $ * (1 + i
SF) *
1
FSF = $
where S is the spot rate of exchange and F is the forward rate. Substituting in the spot rate 
1SF1.4800 = $1.002 and forward rate 1SF1.4655 = $1.002 and respective interest rates 
from Exhibit 6.5, the interest rate parity condition is
(1 + .02) = 1.4800 * (1 + .01) *
1
1.4655
The left-hand side of the equation is the gross return the investor would earn by invest￾ing in dollars. The right-hand side is the gross return the investor would earn by exchanging 
dollars for Swiss francs at the spot rate, investing the franc proceeds in the Swiss franc money 
market, and simultaneously selling the principal plus interest in Swiss francs forward for dol￾lars at the current 90-day forward rate.
Ignoring transaction costs, if the returns in dollars are equal between the two alterna￾tive money market investments, the spot and forward rates are considered to be at IRP. The 
transaction is covered, because the exchange rate back to dollars is guaranteed at the end of 
the 90-day period. Therefore, as shown in Exhibit 6.6, in order for the two alternatives to be 
equal, any differences in interest rates must be offset by the difference between the spot and 
forward exchange rates (in approximate form):

Covered Interest Arbitrage (CIA)
The spot and forward exchange markets are not constantly in the state of equilibrium de￾scribed by interest rate parity. When the market is not in equilibrium, the potential for “risk￾less” or arbitrage profit exists. The arbitrager who recognizes such an imbalance will move to 
take advantage of the disequilibrium by investing in the currency offering the higher return 
on a covered basis. This is called covered interest arbitrage (CIA).
Exhibit 6.6 describes the steps that a currency trader, most likely working in the 
arbitrage division of a large international bank, would implement to perform a CIA 
transaction. The currency trader, Fye Hong, may utilize any of a number of major euro￾currencies that his bank holds to conduct arbitrage investments. The morning conditions 
indicate to Fye Hong that a CIA transaction that exchanges U.S.$1 million for Japanese 
yen, invested in a six-month euroyen account and sold forward back to dollars, will yield 
a profit of $4,638 ($1,044,638 - $1,040,000) over and above the profit available from a 
euro dollar investment. Conditions in the exchange markets and euromarkets change 
rapidly however, so if Fye Hong waits even a few minutes, the profit opportunity may 
disappear.
Fye Hong now executes the following transaction:
M06_EITE5960_16_GE_C06.indd 193 08/05/23 9:28 AM194 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Step 1: Convert $1,000,000 at the spot rate of ¥106.00 = $1.00 to ¥106,000,000
(see “Start” in Exhibit 6.6).
Step 2: Invest the proceeds, ¥106,000,000, in a euroyen account for six months, earning 
4.00% per annum, or 2% for 180 days.
Step 3: Simultaneously sell the future yen proceeds (¥108,120,000) forward for dollars at 
the 180-day forward rate of ¥103.50 = $1.00. This action “locks in” gross dollar rev￾enues of $1,044,638 (see “End” in Exhibit 6.6).
Step 4: Calculate the cost (opportunity cost) of funds used at the eurodollar rate of 8.00% 
per annum, or 4% for 180 days, with principal and interest then totaling $1,040,000. 
Profit on CIA (“End”) is $4,638 ($1,044,638 - $1,040,000).
Note that all profits are stated in terms of the currency in which the transaction was ini￾tialized, but that a trader may conduct investments denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, 
or any other major currency. All that is required to make a covered interest arbitrage profit 
is for interest rate parity not to hold. Depending on the relative interest rates and forward 
premium, Fye Hong would have started in Japanese yen, invested in U.S. dollars, and sold the 
dollars forward for yen. The profit would then end up denominated in yen. But how would 
Fye Hong decide in which direction to go around the box in Exhibit 6.6?
Rule of Thumb. The key to determining whether to start in dollars or yen is to compare 
the differences in interest rates to the forward premium on the yen (the “cost of cover”). For 
example, in Exhibit 6.6, the difference in 180-day interest rates is 2.00% (dollar interest rates 
are higher by 2.00%). The premium on the yen for 180 days forward is as follows:
f ¥ = Spot - Forward
Forward
*
360
180
* 100 = ¥106.00 - ¥103.50
¥103.50
* 200 = 4.8309%
In other words, by investing in yen and selling the yen proceeds forward at the forward rate, 
Fye Hong earns more on the combined interest rate arbitrage and forward premium than if 
he continues to invest in dollars.

Arbitrage Rule of Thumb: If the difference in interest rates is greater than the forward pre￾mium (or expected change in the spot rate), invest in the higher interest yielding currency. If 
the difference in interest rates is less than the forward premium (or expected change in the spot 
rate), invest in the lower interest yielding currency.
Using this rule of thumb should enable Fye Hong to choose in which direction to go 
around the box in Exhibit 6.6. It also guarantees that he will always make a profit if he goes 
in the right direction. This rule assumes that the profit is greater than any transaction costs 
incurred. This process of CIA drives the international currency and money markets toward 
the equilibrium described by interest rate parity. Slight deviations from equilibrium provide 
opportunities for arbitragers to make small riskless profits. Such deviations provide the sup￾ply and demand forces that will move the market back toward parity (equilibrium).
Covered interest arbitrage opportunities continue until interest rate parity is reestab￾lished, because the arbitragers are able to earn risk-free profits by repeating the cycle as often 
as possible. Their actions, however, nudge the foreign exchange and money markets back 
toward equilibrium for the following reasons:
1. The purchase of yen in the spot market and the sale of yen in the forward market nar￾rows the premium on the forward yen. This is because the spot yen strengthens from 
the extra demand and the forward yen weakens because of the extra sales. A narrower 
premium on the forward yen reduces the foreign exchange gain previously captured by 
investing in yen.
2. The demand for yen-denominated securities causes yen interest rates to fall, and the 
higher level of borrowing in the U.S. causes dollar interest rates to rise. The net result is a 
wider interest differential in favor of investing in the dollar.
Uncovered Interest Arbitrage (UIA)
A deviation from covered interest arbitrage is uncovered interest arbitrage (UIA), wherein 
investors borrow in countries and currencies exhibiting relatively low interest rates and con￾vert the proceeds into currencies that offer much higher interest rates. The transaction is “un￾covered,” because the investor does not sell the higher yielding currency proceeds forward, 
choosing to remain uncovered and accept the currency risk of exchanging the higher yield 
currency into the lower yielding currency at the end of the period. Exhibit 6.7 demonstrates 
the steps an uncovered interest arbitrager takes when undertaking what is called the “yen 
carry trade.”
The “yen carry trade” is an age-old application of UIA. Investors, from both inside and 
outside Japan, take advantage of extremely low interest rates in Japanese yen (0.40% per 
annum) to raise capital. Investors exchange the capital they raise for other currencies like 
U.S. dollars or euros. Then they reinvest these dollar or euro proceeds in dollar or euro money 
markets where the funds earn substantially higher rates of return (5.00% per annum in 
Exhibit 6.7). At the end of the period—a year, in this case—they convert the dollar proceeds 
back into yen in the spot market. The result is a tidy profit over what it costs to repay the loan.
The trick, however, is that the spot exchange rate at the end of the year must not change 
significantly from what it was at the beginning of the year. If the yen were to appreciate signif￾icantly against the dollar, as it did in late 1999, moving from ¥120 = $1.00 to ¥105 = $1.00, 
these “uncovered” investors would suffer sizable losses when they convert their dollars into 
yen to repay the yen they borrowed. Higher return at higher risk. The mini-case at the end 
of this chapter details one of the most frequent carry trade structures, the Australian dollar/
Japanese yen cross rate.

Equilibrium between Interest Rates and Exchange Rates
Exhibit 6.8 illustrates the conditions necessary for equilibrium between interest rates and 
exchange rates. The vertical axis shows the difference in interest rates in favor of the foreign 
currency, and the horizontal axis shows the forward premium or discount on that currency. 
The interest rate parity line shows the equilibrium state, but transaction costs cause the line 
to be a band rather than a thin line.
Since 2009, all the major industrial country currency markets—the dollar, the euro, the 
yen—have been characterized by extremely low interest rates, as concerns over economic 
growth and employment have dominated. Select emerging market countries have then ex￾perienced appreciating currencies in some cases (because their interest rates are higher 
than industrial country currencies). Those exchange rate changes have led to exchange rate 
passthrough of imported products—rising prices—contributing to inflationary pressures.
Transaction costs arise from foreign exchange and investment brokerage costs on buy￾ing and selling securities. Typical transaction costs in recent years have been in the range of 
0.18% to 0.25% on an annual basis. For individual transactions, like Fye Hong’s covered in￾terest arbitrage (CIA) activities illustrated in Exhibit 6.7, there is no explicit transaction cost 
per trade; rather, the costs of the bank in supporting Fye Hong’s activities are the transaction 
costs. Point X in Exhibit 6.8 shows one possible equilibrium position, where a 4% lower rate 
of interest on yen securities would be offset by a 4% premium on the forward yen.
The disequilibrium situation, which encouraged the interest rate arbitrage in the previous 
CIA example of Exhibit 6.6, is illustrated in Exhibit 6.8 by point U. Point U is located off the 
interest rate parity line because the lower interest on the yen is 4% (annual basis), whereas the 
premium on the forward yen is slightly over 4.8% (annual basis). Using the formula for forward 
premium presented earlier, we calculate the forward premium on the Japanese yen as follows:
¥106.00 - ¥103.50
¥103.50
*
360days
180days
* 100 = 4.83%
The situation depicted by point U is unstable, because all investors have an incentive to ex￾ecute the same covered interest arbitrage. Except for a bank failure, the arbitrage gain is 
virtually risk-free.

Some observers have suggested that political risk does exist, because one of the govern￾ments might apply capital controls that would prevent execution of the forward contract. 
This risk is fairly remote for covered interest arbitrage between major financial centers of the 
world, especially because a large portion of funds used for CIA is in eurodollars. The concern 
may be valid for pairings with countries not noted for political and fiscal stability.
The net result of the disequilibrium is that fund flows will narrow the gap in interest rates 
and/or decrease the premium on the forward yen. In other words, market pressures will cause 
point U in Exhibit 6.8 to move toward the interest rate parity band. Equilibrium might be 
reached at point Y or at any other locus between X and Z, depending on whether forward 
market premiums are more or less easily shifted than interest rate differentials.
Uncovered interest arbitrage takes many forms in global financial markets today, and 
opportunities do exist for those who are willing to bear the risk (and potentially pay the 
price). Global Finance in Practice 6.4 describes one such speculation, foreign-currency home 
mortgages in Hungary, which, as described, can turn an innocent homeowner into a foreign 
currency speculator.
6.3 Forward Rate as an Unbiased Predictor 
of the Future Spot Rate
Some forecasters believe that foreign exchange markets for the major floating currencies are 
“efficient” and forward exchange rates are unbiased predictors of future spot exchange rates.
Exhibit 6.9 demonstrates the meaning of “unbiased prediction” in terms of how the for￾ward rate performs in estimating future spot exchange rates. If the forward rate is an unbi￾ased predictor of the future spot rate, the expected value of the future spot rate at time 2 
equals the present forward rate for time 2 delivery, available now, E1 1S2 2 = F1,2.

because the interest rates were lower. Regardless of the actual 
interest rate itself, the fall in the value of the forint against the

order to get out from under their rising debt burdens.

The forward rate available “today” (Ft
) for delivery at a future time (t + 1) is used as a forecast or predictor of the spot rate at time t + 1.
The difference between the spot rate which then occurs and the forward rate is the forecast error. When the forward rate is termed an
“unbiased predictor of the future spot rate,” it means that the errors are normally distributed around the mean future spot rate (the sum
of the errors equals zero).
EXHIBIT 6.9 Forward Rate as an Unbiased Predictor of Future Spot
M06_EITE5960_16_GE_C06.indd 198 08/05/23 9:28 AMCHAPTER 6 International Parity Conditions 199
Intuitively, this means that the distribution of possible actual spot rates in the future is 
centered on the forward rate. The fact that it is an unbiased predictor, however, does not mean 
that the future spot rate will actually be equal to what the forward rate predicts. Unbiased 
prediction simply means that the forward rate will, on average, overestimate and underes￾timate the actual future spot rate in equal frequency and degree. The forward rate may, in 
fact, never actually equal the future spot rate. The rationale for this relationship is based on 
the hypothesis that the foreign exchange market is reasonably efficient. Market efficiency 
assumes that (1) all relevant information is quickly reflected in both the spot and forward 
exchange markets, (2) transaction costs are low, and (3) instruments denominated in different 
currencies are perfect substitutes for one another.
Empirical studies of the efficient foreign exchange market hypothesis have yielded con￾flicting results. Nevertheless, a consensus is developing that rejects the efficient market hy￾pothesis. It appears that the forward rate is not an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate 
and that it does pay to use resources to attempt to forecast exchange rates.
If the efficient market hypothesis is correct, a financial executive cannot expect to profit 
in any consistent manner from forecasting future exchange rates, because current quotations 
in the forward market reflect all that is presently known about likely future rates. Although 
future exchange rates may well differ from the expectation implicit in the present forward 
market quotation, we cannot know today in which way actual future quotations will differ 
from today’s forward rate. The expected mean value of deviations is zero. The forward rate is 
therefore an “unbiased” estimator of the future spot rate.
Tests of foreign exchange market efficiency, using longer time periods of analysis, con￾clude that either exchange market efficiency is untestable or, if it is testable, that the market is 
not efficient. Furthermore, the existence and success of foreign exchange forecasting services 
suggest that managers are willing to pay a price for forecast information even though they 
can use the forward rate as a forecast at no cost. The “cost” of buying this information is, in 
many circumstances, an “insurance premium” for financial managers who might get fired for 
using their own forecast, including forward rates, when that forecast proves incorrect. If they 
“bought” professional advice that turned out wrong, the fault was not in their forecast!
If the exchange market is not efficient, it is sensible for a firm to spend resources on fore￾casting exchange rates. This is the opposite conclusion to the one in which exchange markets 
are deemed efficient.
6.4 Prices, Interest Rates, and Exchange Rates 
in Equilibrium
Exhibit 6.10 illustrates all of the fundamental parity relations simultaneously, in equilibrium, 
using the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. The forecasted inflation rates for Japan and the 
United States are 1% and 5%, respectively—a 4% differential. The nominal interest rate in 
the U.S. dollar market (1-year government security) is 8%—a differential of 4% over the 
Japanese nominal interest rate of 4%. The spot rate is ¥104 = $1.00, and the 1-year forward 
rate is ¥100 = $1.00.
Relation A: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). According to the relative version of purchas￾ing power parity, the spot exchange rate one year from now, S2, is expected to be ¥100 = $1.00:
S2 = S1 *
1 + p¥
1 + p$ = ¥104 *
1.01
1.05 = ¥100
This is a 4% change and equal but opposite in sign to the difference in expected rates of infla￾tion (1% – 5%, or 4%).
M06_EITE5960_16_GE_C06.indd 199 08/05/23 9:28 AM200 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Relation B: The Fisher Effect. The real rate of return is the nominal rate of interest less 
the expected rate of inflation. Assuming efficient and open markets, the real rates of return 
should be equal across currencies.
Here, the real rate is 3% in U.S. dollar markets 1r = i - p = 8% - 5%2 and in 
Japanese yen markets 14% - 1%2. Note that the 3% real rate of return is not in Exhibit 
6.10, but rather the Fisher effect’s relationship—that nominal interest rate differentials equal 
the difference in expected rates of inflation, -4%.
Relation C: International Fisher Effect. The forecast change in the spot exchange rate, in 
this case 4%, is equal to but opposite in sign to the differential between nominal interest rates:
S1 - S2
S2
* 100 = i
¥ - i
$ = -4%
Relation D: Interest Rate Parity (IRP). According to the theory of IRP the difference 
in nominal interest rates is equal to, but opposite in sign to, the forward premium. For this 
numerical example, the nominal yen interest rate (4%) is 4% less than the nominal dollar 
interest rate (8%):
i
¥ - i
$ = 4% - 8% = -4%
and the forward premium, f ¥
, is a positive 4%:
f ¥ = S1 - F
F
* 100 = ¥104 - ¥100
¥100
* 100 = 4%
Relation E: Forward Rate as an Unbiased Predictor. Finally, the 1-year forward rate 
on the Japanese yen, F, if assumed to be an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate, also 
forecasts ¥100 = $1.00.

Summary Points
■ Parity conditions have traditionally been used by 
economists to help explain the long-run trend in an 
exchange rate.
■ Under conditions of freely floating rates, the expected 
rate of change in the spot exchange rate, differential 
rates of national inflation and interest, and the forward 
discount or premium are all directly proportional to 
each other and mutually determined. A change in one 
of these variables has a tendency to change all of them 
with a feedback on the variable that changes first.
■ If the identical product or service can be sold in two 
different markets, and there are no restrictions on its 
sale or transportation costs of moving the product be￾tween markets, the product’s price should be the same 
in both markets. This is called the law of one price.
■ The absolute version of purchasing power parity states 
that the spot exchange rate is determined by the rela￾tive prices of similar baskets of goods.
■ The relative version of purchasing power parity states 
that if the spot exchange rate between two countries 
starts in equilibrium, any change in the differential 
rate of inflation between them tends to be offset over 
the long run by an equal but opposite change in the 
spot exchange rate.
■ The Fisher effect, named after economist Irving Fisher, 
states that nominal interest rates in each country are 
equal to the required real rate of return plus compen￾sation for expected inflation.
■ The international Fisher effect, “Fisher-open” as it is 
often termed, states that the spot exchange rate should 
change in an equal amount, but in the opposite direc￾tion, as the difference in interest rates between two 
countries.
■ The theory of interest rate parity (IRP) states that the 
difference in the national interest rates for securities 
of similar risk and maturity should be equal to, but 
opposite in sign to, the forward rate discount or pre￾mium for the foreign currency, except for transaction 
costs.
■ When the spot and forward exchange markets are not 
in equilibrium, as described by interest rate parity, the 
potential for riskless or arbitrage profit exists. This is 
called covered interest arbitrage (CIA).
■ Some forecasters believe that for the major floating 
currencies, foreign exchange markets are “efficient” 
and forward exchange rates are unbiased predictors of 
future spot exchange rates.
Mrs. Watanabe and the Japanese
Yen Carry Trade1
the monetary authorities at the Bank of Japan have 
worked tirelessly fighting equity market collapses and de￾flationary forces, keeping yen-denominated interests rates 
hovering at around 1% per annum or lower. Combined 
with a sophisticated financial industry of size and depth, 
these low interest rates have spawned an international fi￾nancial speculation termed the yen carry trade.
In the textbooks, this trading strategy is categorized 
more formally, as uncovered interest arbitrage (UIA). 
It is a fairly simple speculative position: borrow money 
where it is cheap and invest it in a different currency mar￾ket with higher interest returns. The only real trick is to 
time the market correctly so that when the currency in 
the high-yield market is converted back to the original 
currency, the exchange rate has either stayed the same 
or moved in favor of the speculator. “In favor of” means 
that the high-yielding currency has strengthened against 
the borrowed currency. But as Shakespeare noted, “Ay, 
there’s the rub.”

kept at home in cash, in tansu savings, named for the 
traditional wooden cupboards in which people store their 
possessions. But from the early 2000s, the housewives—
often referred to collectively as “Mrs. Watanabe,” a 
common Japanese surname—began to hunt for higher 
returns. —“Shopping, Cooking, Cleaning, Playing the Yen 
Carry Trade,” Financial Times, February 21, 2009.
Over the past 20 years, Japanese yen interest rates have 
remained extremely low by global standards. For years

But why the focus on Japan? Aren’t there other major cur￾rency markets in which interest rates are periodically low? 
Japan and the Japanese yen turn out to have a number of 
uniquely attractive characteristics to investors and specu￾lators pursuing carry trade activities.
First, Japan has consistently demonstrated for decades 
one of the world’s highest savings rates. This means that an 
enormous pool of funds has accumulated in the hands of 
private savers, savers who are traditionally very conserva￾tive. Those funds, whether stuffed in the mattress or placed 
in savings accounts, earn little in return. (In fact, given the 
extremely low interest rates offered, there is little effective 
difference between the mattress and the bank.)
A second factor facilitating the yen carry trade is the 
sheer size and sophistication of the Japanese financial sec￾tor. Not only is the Japanese economy one of the largest 
industrial economies in the world, it is one that has grown 
and developed with a strong international component. One 
only has to consider the size and global reach of Toyota or 
Sony to understand the established and developed infra￾structure surrounding business and international finance in 
Japan. Japanese banking, however, has been continuously 
in search of new and diverse investments with which to bal￾ance the often despondent domestic economy. It therefore 
sought out foreign investors and foreign borrowers who 
are attractive customers. MNEs have found ready access 
to yen-denominated debt for years—debt, which is, once 
again, available at extremely low interest.
A third expediter of the yen carry trade is the value of 
the Japanese yen itself. The yen has long been considered 
the most international of Asian currencies, and is widely 
traded. It has, however, also been exceedingly volatile over 
time. But it is not volatility alone, as volatility itself could 
undermine interest arbitrage overnight. The key has been 
in the relatively long trends in value change of the yen 
against other major currencies like the U.S. dollar, or as in 
the following example, the Australian dollar.
Australian Dollar/Japanese Yen Exchange Rate
Exhibit A illustrates the movement of the Japanese yen/
Australian dollar exchange rate over a 13-year period, 
from 2000 through 2013. This spot rate movement and 
long-running periodic trends have offered a number of 
extended periods in which interest arbitrage was highly 
profitable. The two periods of Aussie dollar appreciation 
are clear after the fact. During those periods, an investor 
who was short yen and long Aussie dollars (and enjoying 
relatively higher Aussie dollar interest) could and did en￾joy substantial returns.
But what about shorter holding periods—say, a 
year—in which the speculator does not have a crystal ball

over the long-term trend of the spot rate but only a guess? 
Consider the one-year speculation detailed in Exhibit B. 
An investor looking at the exchange rate in January 2009 
(Exhibit A) would see a yen that had reached a recent 
historical “low”—a strong position against the Aussie dol￾lar. Betting that the yen would likely bounce, weakening 
once again against the Aussie dollar, she could borrow 
JPY50 million at 1.00% interest per annum for one year. 
She could then exchange the JPY50 million for Australian 
dollars at JPY60.91 = AUD1.00, and then deposit the 
AUD820,883 proceeds for one year at the Australian in￾terest rate of 4.50% per annum. The investor could also 
have rationalized that even if the exchange rate did not 
change, she would earn a 3.50% per annum interest dif￾ferential.
As it turned out, the spot exchange rate one year 
later, in January 2010, saw a much weaker yen against 
the Aussie dollar, JPY83.19 = AUD1.00. The one-year 
Aussie-Yen carry trade position would then have earned 
a very healthy profit of JPY20,862,296.83 on a one-year 
investment of JPY50,000,000, a 41.7% rate of return.
Post 2009 Financial Crisis. The global financial cri￾sis of 2008–2009 has left a marketplace in which the U.S. 
Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) 
have pursued easy money policies. Both central banks, in 
an effort to maintain high levels of liquidity and to sup￾port fragile commercial banking systems, have kept inter￾est rates at near-zero levels. Now global investors who see 
opportunities for profit in an anemic global economy are 
using those same low-cost funds in the U.S. and Europe 
to fund uncovered interest arbitrage activities. But what 
is making this “emerging market carry trade” so unique 
is not the interest rates, but the fact that investors are 
shorting two of the world’s core currencies: the dollar and 
the euro.
Consider the strategy outlined in Exhibit C—a Euro￾Indian rupee carry trade. An investor borrows EUR20
million at an incredibly low rate (again, because of ECB 
strategy to stimulate the sluggish European economy), 
say 1.00% per annum or 0.50% for 180 days. The EUR20
million are then exchanged for Indian rupees (INR), the 
current spot rate at the start of 2012 being a dramatic low 
of INR67.4 = EUR1.00. The resulting INR1,348,000,000 
are put into an interest-bearing deposit with any of a 
number of Indian banks attempting to attract capital. The 
rate of interest offered, 2.50% (1.25% for 180 days), is not 
particularly high, but is greater than that available in the 
dollar, euro, or even yen markets. The account value at the 
end of 180 days, INR1,364,850,000, is then returned to eu￾ros at the spot rate of INR68.00 = EUR1.00, but at a loss. 
Although the rupee had not moved much, it had moved 
enough to eliminate the arbitrage profits.
Carry trade activity is often described in the global 
press as if it is easy or riskless profit. It is not. As in the 
case of the euro-rupee just described, the combination 
of interest rates and exchange rates is subject to a vola￾tile global marketplace which does indeed have a lot of 
moving parts. An accurate crystal ball will always prove 
quite useful.

6.13 Interest Rate Parity. Define interest rate parity. 
What would it say about interest rates if spot rates 
and forward rates were the same?
6.14 Covered Interest Arbitrage. Ignoring transaction 
costs, under what conditions will covered interest 
arbitrage be plausible?
6.15 Uncovered Interest Arbitrage. Explain what expec￾tations an investor or speculator would need to un￾dertake an uncovered interest arbitrage investment?
6.16 Forward Rate Calculation. If someone you were 
working with argued that the current forward rate 
quoted on a currency pair is the market’s expecta￾tion of where the future spot rate will end up, what 
would you say?
6.17 Forward Rate as an Unbiased Predictor. Some fore￾casters believe that foreign exchange markets for 
the major floating currencies are “efficient,” and 
forward exchange rates are unbiased predictors of 
future spot exchange rates. What is meant by “unbi￾ased predictor” in terms of the reliability of the for￾ward rate in estimating future spot exchange rates?
6.18 Transaction Costs. If transaction costs for undertak￾ing covered or uncovered interest arbitrage were 
large, how do you think it would influence arbitrage 
activity?
6.19 Carry Trade. The term carry trade is used quite fre￾quently in the business press. What does it mean, 
and what conditions and expectations do investors 
need to hold to undertake carry trade transactions?
6.20 Market Efficiency. Many academics and profes￾sionals have tested the foreign exchange and inter￾est rate markets to determine their efficiency. What 
have they concluded?
Problems
6.1 Chile Copper Mining Group (Chile). Chile Copper 
Mining Group, headquartered in Santiago, Chile, 
is one of the largest copper mining firms in the 
world. On January 1, when the spot exchange rate 
is CLP$930.25 = £1.00, the company borrows £30.0 
million from a London bank for one year at 1.75% 
interest (Chilean banks had quoted 5.68% for an 
equivalent loan in Chilean pesos). During the year, 
the U.K. inflation rate is 2.1% and Chilean inflation 
rate is 4.71%. At the end of the year, the firm repays 
the pound loan.
a. If Chile Copper Mining Group expected the 
spot rate at the end of one year to be equal 
to purchasing power parity, what would be 
the cost to Chile Copper Mining Group of 
its pound loan in Chilean peso-denominated 
interest?
b. What is the real interest cost (adjusted for infla￾tion) to Chile Copper Mining Group, in Chilean 
peso-denominated terms, of borrowing the 
pounds for one year, again assuming purchasing 
power parity?
c. If the actual spot rate at the end of the year 
turned out to be CLP$900.15 = £1.00, what was 
the actual Chilean peso-denominated interest 
cost of the loan?
6.2 Dalin’s Luggage: Sydney to Denver. Dalin Chen 
owns homes in Sydney, Australia, and Denver, 
United States. She travels between the two cities at 
least twice a year. Because of her frequent trips, she 
wants to buy some new high-quality luggage. She 
has done her research and has decided to purchase 
a Briggs and Riley three-piece luggage set. There 
are retail stores in Denver and Sydney. Dalin was 
a finance major and wants to use purchasing power 
parity to determine if she is paying the same price 
regardless of where she makes her purchase.
a. If the price of the three-piece luggage set 
in Denver is USD850 and the price of the 
same three-piece set in Sydney is AUD930, 
using purchasing power parity, is the price 
of the luggage truly equal if the spot rate is 
AUD1.0941 = USD1.00?
b. If the price of the luggage remains the same in 
Denver one year from now, determine the price 
of the luggage in Sydney in one year’s time if 
PPP holds true. The U.S. inflation rate is 1.15%, 
and the Australian inflation rate is 3.13%.
6.3 Hyundai’s Pass-Through. Assume that the export 
price of a Hyundai Sonata from Seoul, South Korea, 
is W23,460,000. It exports the car to Malaysia. The 
exchange rate is W279.48 = RM1.00. The forecast in￾flation rate in Malaysia is 2.0% per year and in South 
Korea it is 1.5% per year. Use these data to answer the 
following questions on exchange rate pass-through.
a. What was the export price for the Sonata at the 
beginning of the year expressed in Malaysian 
ringgit?
b. Assuming purchasing power parity holds, what 
should be the exchange rate at the end of the year?
c. Assuming 100% exchange rate pass-through, 
what will be the Malaysian ringgit price of a 
Sonata at the end of the year?
d. Assuming 60% exchange rate pass-through, 
what will be the Malaysian ringgit price of a 
Sonata at the end of the year?

trades at RM3.1350 = $1.00. She determines that 
M06_EITE5960_16_GE_C06.indd 205 08/05/23 9:28 AM206 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
the dollar cost today for a 30-day stay would be 
$10,000. The hotel informs her that any increase in 
its room charges will be limited to any increase in 
the Malaysian cost of living. Malaysian inflation is 
expected to be 2.75% per annum, while U.S. infla￾tion is expected to be 1.25%.

one year hence to pay for her 30-day vacation?
b. By what percent will the dollar cost have gone 
up? Why?
6.5 Argentine Float. The Argentine peso was fixed 
through a currency board at Ps1.00 = $1.00
throughout the 1990s. In January 2002, the Argentine 
peso was floated. On January 29, 2003, it was trad￾ing at Ps3.20 = $1.00. During that one-year period, 
Argentina’s inflation rate was 20% on an annual￾ized basis. Inflation in the United States during that 
same period was 2.2% annualized.

In New York City, the price of a tall vanilla latte is 
$2.65. The exchange rate between the Croatian kuna 
and U.S. dollar is kn5.6288 = $1.00. According to

should try an uncovered interest arbitrage (UIA) 
and thereby save the cost of forward cover. Many of 
Takeshi’s research associates—and their computer 
models—are predicting the spot rate to remain 
close to ¥118.00 = $1.00 for the coming 180 days. 
Using the same data as in Problem 6.9, analyze the

6.15 East Asiatic—Thailand. The East Asiatic Company 
(EAC), a Danish company with subsidiaries 
throughout Asia, has been funding its Bangkok 
subsidiary primarily with U.S. dollar debt because 
of the cost and availability of dollar capital as op￾posed to Thai baht–denominated (THB) debt. The 
treasurer of EAC-Thailand is considering a 1-year 
bank loan for USD250,000. The current spot rate is 
THB32.06 = USD1.00, and the dollar-based inter￾est is 6.75% for the 1-year period. One-year loans 
are 12.00% in baht.
a. Assuming expected inflation rates for the com￾ing year of 4.3% and 1.25% in Thailand and the 
United States, respectively, according to pur￾chase power parity, what would be the effective 
cost of funds in Thai baht terms?
b. If EAC’s foreign exchange advisers believe 
strongly that the Thai government wants to push 
the value of the baht down against the dollar by 
5% over the coming year (to promote its export 
competitiveness in dollar markets), what might 
be the effective cost of funds in baht terms?
c. If EAC could borrow Thai baht at 13% per 
annum, would this be cheaper than either part 
(a) or part (b)?

foreign exchange trader for a bank in New York. 
He has $1 million (or its Swiss franc equivalent)

1.2810
3-month forward rate 
1CHF = USD1.002
1.2740
U.S. dollar 3-month interest rate 4.800%
Swiss franc 3-month interest rate 3.200%
6.17 Casper Landsten—UIA (B). Casper Landsten, 
using the same values and assumptions as in 
Problem 6.16, decides to seek the full 4.800% return 
available in U.S. dollars by not covering his forward 
dollar receipts—an uncovered interest arbitrage 
(UIA) transaction. Assess this decision.
6.18 Casper Landsten—Thirty Days Later. One month 
after the events described in Problems 6.16 and 6.17, 
Casper Landsten once again has $1 million (or its 
Swiss franc equivalent) to invest for three months.

6.19 Equinor’s Corporate Arbitrage. Equinor, the 
national oil company of Norway, is a large, so￾phisticated, and active participant in both the 
currency and petrochemical markets. Although it is 
a Norwegian company, because it operates within 
the global oil market, it considers the U.S. dollar, 
rather than the Norwegian krone (Nok), as its func￾tional currency. Ari Karlsen is a currency trader for 
Equinor and has immediate use of either $3 million 
or the Norwegian krone equivalent. He is faced with 
the following market rates and wonders whether 
he can make some arbitrage profits in the coming 
90 days.
Arbitrage funds available $3,000,000

6.20 Maltese Falcon: The Black Bird. Imagine that the 
mythical solid gold falcon, initially intended as 
a tribute by the Knights of Malta to the King of 
Spain in appreciation for his gift of the island of 
Malta to the order in 1530, has recently been re￾covered. The falcon is 14 inches high and solid gold, 
weighing approximately 48 pounds. Assume that 
gold prices have risen to $440/ounce, primarily as 
a result of increasing political tensions. The falcon 
is currently held by a private investor in Istanbul, 
who is actively negotiating with the Maltese gov￾ernment on its purchase and prospective return to 
its island home. The sale and payment are to take 
place one year from now, and the parties are ne￾gotiating over the price and currency of payment. 
The investor has decided, in a show of goodwill, 
to base the sales price only on the falcon’s specie 
value—its gold value. The current spot exchange 
rate is 0.39 Maltese lira (ML) per 1.00 U.S. dollar. 
Maltese inflation is expected to be about 8.5% for 
the coming year, while U.S. inflation, on the heels 
of a double-dip recession, is expected to come in 
at only 1.5%. If the investor bases value in the U.S. 
dollar, would he be better off receiving Maltese 
lira in one year (assuming purchasing power par￾ity) or receiving a guaranteed dollar payment (as￾suming a gold price of $420 per ounce one year 
from now).
6.21 African Beer Standard. Years ago The Economist
reported the creation of an index, or standard, for 
the evaluation of African currency values using 
the local prices of beer. Beer, instead of Big Macs, 
was chosen as the product for comparison because 
McDonald’s had not penetrated the African con￾tinent beyond South Africa and beer met most of 
the same product and market characteristics re￾quired for the construction of a proper currency 
index. Investec, a South African investment bank￾ing firm, has replicated the process of creating a 
measure of purchasing power parity (PPP) like that 
of the Big Mac Index of The Economist for Africa. 
The index compares the cost of a 375-milliliter 
bottle of clear lager beer across Sub-Saharan 
Africa. As a measure of PPP, the beer needs to be 
relatively homogeneous in quality across countries 
and must possess substantial elements of local 
manufacturing, inputs, distribution, and service in 
order to actually provide a measure of relative pur￾chasing power. The beer is first priced in local cur￾rency (purchased in the taverns of the locals, and 
not in the high-priced tourist centers). The price 
is then converted to South African rand and the 
rand-price compared to the local currency price as 
one measure of whether the local currency is un￾dervalued or overvalued versus the South African 
rand. Use the data in the table and complete the 
calculation of whether the individual currencies 
are undervalued or overvalued.

6.22 Volvo of Sweden’s XC90. Export Pricing Analysis. 
Volvo Sweden, a leading auto manufacturer in 
Sweden, was scheduled to launch a new variant of the 
XC90 SUV in 2013 and was amid generating a com￾plete pricing analysis of the car for sales in Sweden 
and export. The new variant of the XC90 would be 
initially priced at Swedish Krona at SEK 619,900 in 
Sweden, and if exported to Australia, the price would 
be AUD92,985 in Australian dollars at the current 
spot rate of SEK6.65 = AUD1.00. Volvo intends to 
raise the price domestically with the rate of Swedish 
inflation over time but is worried about how that 
compares to the export price given Australian dollar 
inflation and the future exchange rate. Use the follow￾ing data table to answer the pricing analysis questions.
a. If the domestic price of the XC90 increases with 
the rate of inflation, what would be its price 
over the 2013–2018 period?
b. Assuming the forecasts of Australian and Swedish 
inflation prove accurate, what would the value of 
the Swedish krona be over the coming years if its 
value versus the Australian dollar followed pur￾chasing power parity?
c. If the export price of the XC90 were set using 
the purchasing power parity forecast of the 
Swedish krona-Australian dollar exchange 
rate, what would the export price be over the 
2013–2018 period?

6.23 Clayton Moore’s Money Fund. Clayton Moore is 
the manager of an international money market 
fund managed out of London. Unlike many money 
funds that guarantee their investors a near risk￾free investment with variable interest earnings, 
Clayton Moore’s fund is a very aggressive fund 
that searches out relatively high interest earnings 
around the globe, but at some risk. The fund is 
pound-denominated. Clayton is currently evaluat￾ing a rather interesting opportunity in Malaysia. 
Since the Asian Crisis of 1997, the Malaysian gov￾ernment enforced a number of currency and capital 
restrictions to protect and preserve the value of the 
Malaysian ringgit. The ringgit was fixed to the U.S. 
dollar at RM3.80 = $1.00 for seven years. In 2005, 
the Malaysian government allowed the currency to 
float against several major currencies. The current 
spot rate today is RM3.1345 = $1.00. Local cur￾rency time deposits of 180-day maturities are earn￾ing 8.900% per annum. The London eurocurrency 
market for pounds is yielding 4.200% per annum 
on similar 180-day maturities. The current spot rate 
on the British pound is $1.5820 = -£1.00, and 
the 180-day forward rate is $1.5561 = £1.00. What 
would you recommend Clayton do?

CHAPTER 6 APPENDIX
An Algebraic Primer to International
Parity Conditions
The following is a purely algebraic presentation of the parity conditions explained in this 
chapter. It is offered to provide those who wish additional theoretical detail and definition 
ready access to the step-by-step derivation of the various conditions.
The Law of One Price
The law of one price refers to the state in which, in the presence of free trade, perfect sub￾stitutability of goods, and costless transactions, the equilibrium exchange rate between two 
currencies is determined by the ratio of the price of any commodity i denominated in two 
different currencies. For example,
St = P$
i,t
PSF
i,t
where Pi
$
 and Pi
SF refer to the prices of the same commodity i, at time t, denominated in U.S. 
dollars and Swiss francs, respectively. The spot exchange rate, St, is simply the ratio of the two 
currency prices.
Purchasing Power Parity
The more general form in which the exchange rate is determined by the ratio of two price 
indexes is termed the absolute version of purchasing power parity (PPP). Each price index re￾flects the currency cost of the identical “basket” of goods across countries. The exchange rate 
that equates purchasing power for the identical collection of goods is then stated as follows:
St = P$
t
PSF
t
where Pt
$
 and Pt
SF are the price index values in U.S. dollars and Swiss francs at time t, respec￾tively. If p$
 and pSF represents the rate of inflation in each country, the spot exchange rate at 
time t + 1 would be
St + 1 = P$
t(1 + p$
)
PSF
t (1 + pSF) = St c
(1 + p$
)
(1 + pSF)
d
The change from period t to t + 1 is then
St + 1
St
=
P$
t(1 + p$
)
PSF
t (1 + pSF)
P$
t
PSF
t
=
St c
(1 + p$
)
(1 + pSF)
d
St
= (1 + p$
)
(1 + pSF)
Isolating the percentage change in the spot exchange rate between periods t and t + 1 is then
St + 1 - St
St
=
StJ (1 + p$
)
(1 + pSF)
R - St
St
= (1 + p$
) - (1 + pSF)
(1 + pSF)
M06_EITE5960_16_GE_C06.indd 211 08/05/23 9:28 AM212 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
This equation is often approximated by dropping the denominator of the right-hand side if it 
is considered to be relatively small. It is then stated as
St + 1 - St
St
= (1 + p$
) - (1 + pSF) = p$ - pSF
Forward Rates
The forward exchange rate is that contractual rate which is available to private agents through 
banking institutions and other financial intermediaries who deal in foreign currencies and 
debt instruments. The annualized percentage difference between the forward rate and the 
spot rate is termed the forward premium,
f SF = c
Ft,t + 1 - St
St
d * c 360
nt,t + 1
d
where f SF is the forward premium on the Swiss franc, Ft,t + 1is the forward rate contracted at 
time t for delivery at time t + 1, St is the current spot rate, and nt,t + 1 is the number of days 
between the contract date (t) and the delivery date (t + 1).
Covered Interest Arbitrage (CIA) and Interest Rate Parity (IRP)
The process of covered interest arbitrage is when an investor exchanges domestic currency for 
foreign currency in the spot market, invests that currency in an interest-bearing instrument, 
and signs a forward contract to “lock in” a future exchange rate at which to convert the for￾eign currency proceeds (gross) back to domestic currency. The net return on CIA is
NetReturn = c
(1 + i
SF)Ft,t + 1
St
d - (1 + i
$
)
where S2 and Ft,t + 1 are the spot and forward rates 1 $/SF2, i
SF is the nominal interest rate (or 
yield) on a Swiss franc-denominated monetary instrument, and i
$
 is the nominal return on a 
similar dollar-denominated instrument.
If they possess exactly equal rates of return—that is, if CIA results in zero riskless profit—
interest rate parity (IRP) holds and appears as
(1 + i
$
) = c
(1 + i
SF)Ft,t + 1
St
d
or alternatively as
(1 + i
$
)
(1 + i
SF) = Ft,t + 1
St
If the percent age difference of both sides of this equation is found (the percentage dif￾ference between the spot and forward rate is the forward premium), then the relationship 
between the forward premium and relative interest rate differentials is
Ft,t + 1 - St
St
= f SF = i
$ - i
SF
1 + i
SF
If these values are not equal (thus, the markets are not in equilibrium), there exists a 
potential for riskless profit. The market will then be driven back to equilibrium through CIA 
by agents attempting to exploit such arbitrage potential, until CIA yields no positive return.
M06_EITE5960_16_GE_C06.indd 212 08/05/23 9:28 AMCHAPTER 6 International Parity Conditions 213
Fisher Effect
The Fisher effect states that all nominal interest rates can be decomposed into an implied real 
rate of interest (return) and an expected rate of inflation:
i
$ = 3 (1 + r$
)(1 + p$
) 4 - 1
where r$
 is the real rate of return and p$
 is the expected rate of inflation for dollar￾denominated assets. The subcomponents are then identifiable:
i
$ = 3 (1 + r$
)(1 + p$
) 4 - 1
As with PPP, there is an approximation of this function that has gained wide acceptance. 
The cross-product term of r$
p$
 is often very small and therefore dropped altogether:
i
$ = r$ + p$
International Fisher Effect
The international Fisher effect is the extension of this domestic interest rate relationship to 
the international currency markets. If capital, by way of covered interest arbitrage (CIA), 
attempts to find higher rates of return internationally resulting from current interest rate dif￾ferentials, the real rates of return between currencies are equalized (e.g., r$ = rSF):
St + 1 - St
St
= (1 + i
$
) - (1 + i
SF)
(1 + i
SF) = i
$ - i
SF
(1 + i
SF)
If the nominal interest rates are then decomposed into their respective real and expected 
inflation components, the percentage change in the spot exchange rate is
St + 1 - St
St
= (r$ + p$ + r$
p$
) - (rSF + pSF + rSFpSF)
1 + rSF + pSF + rSFpSF .
The international Fisher effect has a number of additional implications, if the following 
requirements are met: (1) capital markets can be freely entered and exited, (2) capital mar￾kets possess investment opportunities that are acceptable substitutes, and (3) market agents 
have complete and equal information regarding these possibilities.
Given these conditions, international arbitragers are capable of exploiting all poten￾tial riskless profit opportunities, until real rates of return between markets are equalized 
1r$ = rSF2. Thus, the expected rate of change in the spot exchange rate reduces to the dif￾ferential in the expected rates of inflation:
St + 1 - St
St
= p$ + r$
p$ - pSF - rSFpSF
1 + rSF + pSF + rSFpSF .
If the approximation forms are combined (through the elimination of the denominator and 
the elimination of the interactive terms of r and p), the change in the spot rate is simply
St + 1 - St
St
= p$ - pSF
Note the similarity (identical in equation form) of the approximate form of the international 
Fisher effect to purchasing power parity, discussed previously. The only potential difference is 
that between ex post and ex ante, (expected) inflation.

Financial management of the multinational enterprise in the twenty-first century will cer￾tainly include the use of financial derivatives. These derivatives, so named because their val￾ues are derived from an underlying asset like a stock or a currency, are powerful tools used 
in business today for two very distinct management objectives: speculation and hedging. The 
financial manager of an MNE may purchase financial derivatives in order to take positions 
in the expectation of profit—speculation—or may use these instruments to reduce the risks 
associated with the everyday management of corporate cash flow—hedging. Before these fi￾nancial instruments can be used effectively, however, the financial manager must understand 
certain basics about their structure and pricing.
In this chapter, we cover the primary foreign currency financial derivatives used today 
in multinational finance. Here we focus on the fundamentals of their valuation and use for 
speculative purposes; Chapter 9 will describe how these foreign currency derivatives can be 
used to hedge commercial transactions. The mini-case at the end of this chapter, The Ups and 
Downs of Volatility, explores currency volatility through times of crisis like the global finan￾cial crisis of 2008–2009 and the global pandemic of 2020, as well as times of record calm as in 
2019, and ultimately whether these bouts of volatility are predictable.
Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also 
depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties to them. In the meantime, though, 
before a contract is settled, the counterparties record profits and losses—often huge in 
amount—in their current earnings statements without so much as a penny changing 
hands. The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or 
sometimes, so it seems, madmen).

A word of caution before proceeding: Financial derivatives are powerful tools in the hands 
of careful and competent financial managers. They can also be destructive devices when used 
recklessly and carelessly. The history of finance is littered with cases in which financial manag￾ers, either intentionally or unintentionally, took huge positions resulting in significant losses 
for their companies. In the right hands and with proper controls, however, derivatives may 
provide management with opportunities to enhance and protect corporate value.
7.1 Foreign Currency Futures
A foreign currency futures contract is an alternative to a forward contract that calls for future 
delivery of a standard amount of foreign exchange at a fixed time, place, and price. It is simi￾lar to futures contracts that exist for commodities (hogs, cattle, lumber, etc.), interest-bearing 
deposits, and gold. Most world money centers have established foreign currency futures 
markets. In the United States, the most important market for foreign currency futures is the 
International Monetary Market of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Contract Specifications
Contract specifications are established by the exchange on which futures are traded. Using 
the Chicago IMM as an example, the major features of standardized futures trading can be 
illustrated by the Mexican peso futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), 
as shown in Exhibit 7.1.
Each futures contract is for 500,000 Mexican pesos. This is the notional principal. Trading 
in each currency must be done in an even multiple of currency units. The method of stating 
exchange rates is in American terms, the U.S. dollar cost (price) of a foreign currency (unit), 
where the CME is mixing the old dollar symbol with the ISO 4217 code for the peso, MXN. In 
Exhibit 7.1 this is U.S. dollars per Mexican peso. Contracts mature on the third Wednesday of 
January, March, April, June, July, September, October, or December. Contracts may be traded 
through the second business day prior to the Wednesday on which they mature. Unless holi￾days interfere, the last trading day is the Monday preceding the maturity date.
One of the defining characteristics of futures is the requirement that the purchaser de￾posit a sum as an initial margin or collateral. This requirement is similar to requiring a per￾formance bond, and it can be met by a letter of credit from a bank, Treasury bills, or cash. In 
addition, a maintenance margin is required. The value of the contract is marked to market 
daily, and all changes in value are paid in cash daily. Marked-to-market means that the value 
of the contract is revalued using the closing price for the day. The amount to be paid is called 
the variation margin.
EXHIBIT 7.1 Mexican Peso (CMM)-MXN 500,000; USD per MXN
All contracts are for 500,000 Mexican pesos. “Open” means the opening price on the day. “High” means the high price on the day. “Low” indicates the 
lowest price on the day. “Settle” is the closing price on the day. “Change” indicates the change in the settle price from the previous day’s close. “High” and 
“Low” to the right of “Change” indicate the highest and lowest prices this specific contract (as defined by its maturity) has experienced over its trading his￾tory. “Open Interest” indicates the number of contracts outstanding.

M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 215 02/05/23 5:16 PM216 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Only about 5% of all futures contracts are settled by the physical delivery of foreign ex￾change between buyer and seller. More often, buyers and sellers offset their original position 
prior to delivery date by taking an opposite position. That is, an investor will normally close 
out a futures position by selling a futures contract for the same delivery date. The complete 
buy/sell or sell/buy is called a “round turn.”
Customers pay a commission to a broker to execute a round turn and a single price is 
quoted. This practice differs from that of the interbank market, where dealers quote a bid and 
an offer and do not charge a commission. All contracts are agreements between the client 
and the exchange clearinghouse, rather than between the two clients involved. Consequently, 
clients need not worry that a specific counterparty in the market will fail to honor an agree￾ment, termed counterparty risk. The clearinghouse is owned and guaranteed by all members 
of the exchange.
Using Foreign Currency Futures
The principle of a futures contract is as follows: A speculator who buys a futures contract is 
locking in the price at which she must buy that currency on the specified future date. A specu￾lator who sells a futures contract is locking in the price at which she must sell that currency 
on that future date. Any investor wishing to speculate on the movement of the Mexican peso 
versus the U.S. dollar could pursue one of the following futures strategies.
Short Positions. If Laura Cervantes, a speculator working for International Currency 
Traders, believes that the Mexican peso will fall in value versus the U.S. dollar (USD) by 
March, she could sell a March futures contract, taking a short position. By selling a March 
contract, Laura locks in the right to sell 500,000 Mexican pesos (MXN) at a set price. If the 
price of the peso falls by the maturity date as she expects, Laura has a contract to sell pesos at 
a price above their current price on the spot market. Hence, she makes a profit.
Using the quotes on Mexican peso futures in Exhibit 7.1, Laura sells one March futures con￾tract for MXN500,000 at the closing price, termed the settle price, of USD0.10958=MXN1.00. The 
value of her position at maturity—at the expiration of the futures contract in March—is then
Value at maturity (Short position) = -Notional principal * (Spot - Futures)
Note that the short position is entered into the valuation as a negative notional principal. If 
the spot exchange rate at maturity is USD0.09500 = MXN1.00, the value of her position on 
settlement is
Value = -MXN 500,000 * (USD0.09500 per MXN - USD0.10958 per MXN)
= USD7,290
Laura’s expectation proved correct; the Mexican peso fell in value versus the U.S. dollar. We 
could say, “Laura buys at USD0.09500 and sells at USD0.10958 per peso.”
All that was really required of Laura to speculate on the Mexican peso’s value was for 
her to have a directional view—an opinion on the Mexican peso’s future exchange value ver￾sus the U.S. dollar. In this case, she opined that the Mexican peso would fall in value against 
the U.S. dollar by the March maturity date of the futures contract.
Long Positions. If Laura Cervantes expected the peso to rise in value versus the dollar 
in the near term, she could take a long position by buying a March future on the Mexican 
peso. Buying a March future means that Laura is locking in the price at which she must buy 
Mexican pesos at the future’s maturity date. Laura’s futures contract at maturity would have 
the following value:
Value at maturity (Long position) = Notional principal * (Spot - Futures)
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 216 02/05/23 5:17 PMCHAPTER 7 Foreign Currency Derivatives: Futures and Options 217
Again using the March settle price on Mexican peso futures in Exhibit 7.1, USD0.10958 
= MXN1.00, if the spot exchange rate at maturity is USD0.1100 = MXN1.00, then Laura has 
indeed correctly predicted the movement of the peso. The value of her position on settlement 
is then
Value = MXN 500,000 * (USD0.11000 per MXN - USD0.10958 per MXN)
= USD210
In this case, Laura makes a profit in a matter of months of $210 on the single futures contract. 
We could say, “Laura buys at USD0.10958 and sells at USD0.11000 per peso.”
But what happens if Laura’s expectation about the future value of the Mexican peso 
proves wrong? For example, if the Mexican government announces that the rate of inflation 
in Mexico has suddenly risen dramatically, and the peso falls to USD0.08000 = MXN1.00 by 
the March maturity date, the value of Laura’s futures contract on settlement is
Value = MXN 500,000 * (USD0.08000 per MXN - USD0.10958 per MXN)
= -USD14,790
In this case, Laura Cervantes suffers a speculative loss. Futures contracts could obviously 
be used in combinations to form a variety of more complex positions. When we combine con￾tracts, valuation is fairly straightforward and additive in character.
Foreign Currency Futures versus Forward Contracts
Foreign currency futures contracts differ from forward contracts in a number of important 
ways. Individual investors find futures contracts useful for speculation because they usually 
do not have access to forward contracts. For businesses, futures contracts are often considered 
inefficient and burdensome because the futures position is marked to market on a daily basis 
over the life of the contract. Although this does not require the business to pay or receive 
cash daily, it does result in more frequent margin calls from its financial service providers 
than the business typically wants.
7.2 Foreign Currency Options
A foreign currency option is a contract that gives the option purchaser (the buyer) the right, 
but not the obligation, to buy or sell a given amount of foreign exchange at a fixed price 
per unit for a specified time period (until the maturity date). A key phrase in this definition 
is “but not the obligation,” which means that the owner of an option possesses a valuable 
choice.
In many ways, buying an option is like buying a ticket to a benefit concert. The buyer has 
the right to attend the concert but is not obliged to. The buyer of the concert ticket risks noth￾ing more than what she pays for the ticket. Similarly, the buyer of an option cannot lose more 
than what he pays for the option. If the buyer of the ticket decides later not to attend the con￾cert, prior to the day of the concert, the ticket can be sold to someone else who wishes to go.
Option Fundamentals
There are two basic types of options, calls and puts. A call is an option to buy foreign currency, 
and a put is an option to sell foreign currency. The buyer of an option is termed the holder, 
while the seller of an option is referred to as the writer or grantor.
Every option has three different price elements: (1) the exercise price or strike price—also 
commonly referred to as the strike rate—is the exchange rate at which the foreign currency 
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 217 02/05/23 5:17 PM218 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
can be purchased (call) or sold (put); (2) the premium, which is the cost, price, or value of the 
option itself; and (3) the underlying or actual spot exchange rate in the market.
An American option gives the buyer the right to exercise the option at any time between 
the date of writing and the expiration or maturity date. A European option can be exercised 
only on its expiration date, not before. Nevertheless, American and European options are 
priced almost the same because the option holder would normally sell the option itself before 
maturity. The option would then still have some “time value” above its “intrinsic value” if ex￾ercised (explained later in this chapter).
The premium or option price is the cost of the option, and is usually paid in advance 
by the buyer to the seller. In the over-the-counter (OTC) market—options offered by 
banks—premiums are quoted as a percentage of the transaction amount. Premiums on 
exchange-traded options are quoted as a domestic currency amount per unit of foreign 
currency.
An option that has an exercise price equal to the spot price of the underlying currency 
is said to be at-the-money (ATM). An option that would be profitable, excluding the cost 
of the premium, if exercised immediately is said to be in-the-money (ITM). An option that 
would not be profitable, again excluding the cost of the premium, if exercised immediately is 
referred to as out-of-the-money (OTM).
Foreign Currency Options Markets
In the past three decades, the use of foreign currency options as a hedging tool and for specu￾lative purposes has blossomed into a major foreign exchange activity. A number of banks in 
the United States and other capital markets offer flexible foreign currency options on trans￾actions of $1 million or more. The bank market, or over-the-counter market as it is called, 
offers custom-tailored options on all major trading currencies for any period up to one year 
and, in some cases, two to three years.
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange introduced trading in standardized foreign currency 
option contracts in the United States in 1982. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other 
exchanges in the U.S. and abroad have followed suit. Exchange-traded contracts are par￾ticularly appealing to speculators and individuals who do not normally have access to the 
over-the-counter market. Banks also trade on the exchanges because it is one of several 
ways they can offset the risk of options they may have transacted with clients or other banks. 
Increased use of foreign currency options is a reflection of the explosive growth in the use of 
other kinds of options and the resulting improvements in option pricing models. The original 
option-pricing model developed by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in 1973 has been ex￾panded, adapted, and commercialized in hundreds of forms since that time.
Options on the Over-the-Counter Market. Over-the-counter (OTC) options are most 
frequently written by banks for U.S. dollars against British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, 
Japanese yen, Swiss francs, or the euro but are becoming increasingly available for nearly 
every major traded currency.
The main advantage of OTC options is that they are tailored to the specific needs of 
the firm. Financial institutions are willing to write or buy options that vary by amount (the 
notional principal), strike price, and maturity. Although the OTC markets were relatively il￾liquid in the early years, these markets have grown to such proportions that liquidity is now 
quite good. On the other hand, the buyer must assess the writing bank’s ability to fulfill the 
option contract. The financial risk associated with the counterparty—counterparty risk—is an 
ever-present issue in international markets as a result of the increasing use of financial con￾tracts like options and swaps. Exchange-traded options are more the territory of individuals 
and financial institutions than of business firms.
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 218 02/05/23 5:17 PMCHAPTER 7 Foreign Currency Derivatives: Futures and Options 219
If an investor wishes to purchase an option in the OTC market, the investor will normally 
place a call to the currency option desk of a major money center bank; specify the curren￾cies, maturity, and strike rate(s); and ask for an indication, a bid-offer quote. The bank will 
normally take a few minutes to a few hours to price the option and respond to the request.
Options on Organized Exchanges. Options on the physical (underlying) currency are 
traded on a number of organized exchanges worldwide, including the Philadelphia Stock 
Exchange (PHLOX) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Exchange-traded options are 
settled through a clearinghouse, which means that buyers do not deal directly with sellers. 
The clearinghouse is the counterparty to every option contract and it guarantees fulfillment. 
Clearinghouse obligations are in turn the obligation of all members of the exchange, includ￾ing a large number of banks. For the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, clearinghouse services are 
provided by the Options Clearing Corporation.
Digital Trading. Digital trading of currency options is thought to combine the best of 
OTC and exchange traded options. Theoretically, they can be customized to the needs of the 
buyer but simultaneously be accessed and priced through a digital interface (described as 
“straight-through processing”). FXall, a foreign exchange and currency option trading house 
for banks and brokers owned by the Blackstone Group, has seen rapid growth in sales of digi￾tal foreign currency option trades in recent years.
Currency Option Quotations and Prices
Typical quotes for options on Swiss francs are shown in Exhibit 7.2. These quotes are for 
transactions completed on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange on the previous day. Although 
a multitude of strike prices and expiration dates are quoted (shown in the exhibit), not all 
were actually traded the previous trading day, and in that case no premium price is shown. 
Currency option strike prices and premiums on the U.S. dollar are typically quoted as direct 
quotations on the U.S. dollar and indirect quotations on the foreign currency, as in US$ per 
Swiss franc (SF) or US$ per Japanese yen (¥).

Buyer of a Call
Options differ from other types of financial instruments in the patterns of risk they produce. 
The holder of an option has the choice to exercise the option or to allow it to expire unused. 
The owner will exercise the option only when doing so is profitable, which means only when 
the option is in the money. In the case of a call option, as the spot price of the underlying cur￾rency moves up, the holder has the possibility of unlimited profit. On the down side, however, 
the holder can abandon the option and walk away, losing only the premium paid.
Exhibit 7.2 illustrates the three different prices that characterize any foreign currency op￾tion. In the exhibit, the highlighted option is referred to using the month and strike price as 
an “August 58.5 call option.” The three prices that characterize an “August 58.5 call option” 
are as follows:
1. Spot rate. “Option and Underlying” in the exhibit means that 58.51 cents, or $0.5851, was 
the spot dollar price of one Swiss franc at the close of trading on the preceding day.
2. Exercise price. The exercise price, or “Strike Price” in the exhibit, is the price per franc 
that must be paid if the option is exercised. The August call option on francs of 58.5 indi￾cates $0.5850 = SF1.00. Exhibit 7.2 lists nine different strike prices, ranging from $0.5600 
to $0.6000, although more were available on that date than are listed.
3. Premium. The premium is the cost or price of the option. The price of the August 58.5 call 
option on Swiss francs was 0.50 U.S. cents per franc, or $0.0050=SF1.00. The premium is 
the market value of the option, and therefore, the terms premium, cost, price, and value 
are all interchangeable for options.
The August 58.5 call option premium is 0.50 cents per franc, and in this case, the August 
58.5 put’s premium is also 0.50 cents per franc. Since one option contract on the Philadelphia 
Stock Exchange consists of 62,500 francs, the total cost of one option contract for the call (or 
put in this case) is SF62,500 * $0.0050 per SF = $312.50.
Hans Schmidt is a currency speculator in Zurich. The position of Hans as a buyer of a 
call is illustrated in Exhibit 7.3. Assume he purchases the August call option on Swiss francs 
described previously, the one with a strike price of $0.585 and a premium of $0.005 per SF. 
The vertical axis measures profit or loss for the option buyer at each of several different spot 
prices for the franc up to the time of maturity.
At all spot rates below the strike price of $0.585, Hans would choose not to exercise his 
option. This is obvious because at a spot rate of $0.580, for example, he would prefer to buy 
a Swiss franc for $0.580 on the spot market rather than exercising his option to buy a franc 
at $0.585. If the spot rate were to remain at $0.580 or below until August when the option 
expired, Hans would not exercise the option. His total loss would be limited to only what he 
paid for the option, the $0.005 = SF1.00 purchase price. Regardless of how far the spot rate 
was to fall, his loss would be limited to the original $0.005 per SF cost.
Alternatively, at all spot rates above the strike price of $0.585, Hans would exercise the 
option, paying only the strike price for each Swiss franc. For example, if the spot rate were 
$0.595 per franc at maturity, he would exercise his call option, buying Swiss francs for $0.585 
each instead of purchasing them on the spot market at $0.595 each. He could sell the Swiss 
francs immediately in the spot market for $0.595 each, pocketing a gross profit of $0.010 per 
SF, or a net profit of $0.005 per SF after deducting the original cost of the option of $0.005. 
Hans’s profit, if the spot rate is greater than the strike price, with strike price $0.585, a pre￾mium of $0.005, and a spot rate of $0.595, is
Profit = Spot Rate - (Strike Price + Premium)
= $0.595 - ($0.585 + $0.005)
= $0.005 per SF
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 220 02/05/23 5:17 PMCHAPTER 7 Foreign Currency Derivatives: Futures and Options 221
More likely, Hans would realize the profit through executing an offsetting contract on 
the options exchange rather than taking delivery of the currency. Because the dollar price of 
a franc could rise to an infinite level (off the upper right-hand side of Exhibit 7.3), maximum 
profit is unlimited. The buyer of a call option thus possesses an attractive combination of out￾comes: limited loss and unlimited profit potential.
Note that the break-even price of $0.590 is the price at which Hans neither gains nor 
loses on exercising the option. The premium cost of $0.005, combined with the cost of exercis￾ing the option of $0.585, is exactly equal to the proceeds from selling the francs in the spot 
market at $0.590. Hans will still exercise the call option at the break-even price. This is be￾cause by exercising it, he at least recoups the premium paid for the option. At any spot price 
above the exercise price but below the break-even price, the gross profit earned on exercising 
the option and selling the underlying currency covers part (but not all) of the premium cost.
Writer of a Call
The position of the writer (seller) of the same call option is illustrated in Exhibit 7.4. If the 
option expires when the spot price of the underlying currency is below the exercise price of 
$0.585, the option holder does not exercise it. What the holder loses, the writer gains. The 
writer keeps as profit the entire premium paid of $0.005 per SF. If the option is exercised 
when the spot price of the underlying currency is above the exercise price of 58.5, the writer 
of the call must deliver the underlying currency for $0.585 per SF at a time when the value 
of the franc is above $0.585. If the writer wrote the option naked, that is, without owning the 
currency, then the writer will need to buy the currency at spot and, in this scenario, take the 
loss. The amount of such a loss is unlimited and increases as the price of the underlying cur￾rency rises.

Once again, what the holder gains, the writer loses, and vice versa. Even if the writer al￾ready owns the currency, the writer will experience an opportunity loss, surrendering against 
the option the same currency that could have been sold for more in the open market. For 
example, the profit to the writer of a call option of strike price $0.585, premium $0.005, and a 
spot rate of $0.595 is
Profit = Premium + (Spot Rate - Strike Price)
= $0.005 - ($0.595 + $0.585)
= - $0.005 per SF
but only if the spot rate is greater than or equal to the strike rate. At spot rates less than the 
strike price, the option will expire worthless and the writer of the call option will keep the 
premium earned. The maximum profit that the writer of the call option can make is limited 
to the premium. The writer of a call option has a rather unattractive combination of potential 
outcomes—limited profit potential and unlimited loss potential—but there are ways to limit 
such losses through other offsetting techniques that we will discuss later in this chapter.
It’s not always easy to know when to buy a call or write a call, but as Global Finance in 
Practice 7.1 explains, there are times in history when it would certainly have been a good idea.
Buyer of a Put
Hans’s position as buyer of a put is illustrated in Exhibit 7.5. The basic terms of this put are 
similar to those we just used to illustrate a call. The buyer of a put option, however, wants to 
be able to sell the underlying currency at the exercise price when the market price of that 
currency drops (rather than when it rises as in the case of a call option). If the spot price of a

GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 7.1
buy dollars for Deutschemarks on one-half of the exposure 
($250 million) and leave the other half ($250 million) unhedged. 
As it turned out, Ruhnau was right. The dollar did fall against 
the Deutschemark. By January 1985 it was trading at DM2.3 =
$1.00. Unfortunately, that meant the $250 million that was un￾covered could be attained at DM2.3, while the other $250 mil￾lion, locked in with a forward contract, cost DM3.2 for each 
dollar. Ruhnau was heavily criticized for the forward contract, 
was accused of speculating on currency exposures of the 
company, and eventually stepped down from being chairman.
The PSE—after the fact—used this as a golden example 
of when using foreign currency options would have been the 
perfect strategy. Since Ruhnau believed the spot exchange 
rate was going to move in his favor but still needed protection 
if it didn’t, according to the PSE he should have purchased 
a call option on U.S. dollars at a strike rate near the current 
spot rate (forward-at-the-money). In hindsight, yes, it would 
have been a very good strategy. In hindsight.
Currency Options and Lufthansa
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PSE) launched foreign cur￾rency options trading in 1982. Several years later, Lufthansa, 
the national flag carrier for Germany, became the subject of a 
promotional add for currency options for many years.
In January 1985, Lufthansa, under the chairmanship of 
Herr Heinz Ruhnau, signed a contract with Boeing (US) for 
the purchase of 20 Boeing 737 jets. A single payment of 
$500 million was due on delivery in January 1986, or 1.6 bil￾lion Deutschemarks (DM, Germany’s currency at the time) at 
the current spot rate of DM3.20 = $1.00. All major currency 
analysts, as well as Herr Ruhnau himself, believed that the DM 
would appreciate versus the dollar over the coming year. The 
dollar had been rising nearly nonstop for five years and was at 
a peak that even most major governments thought too high.
But Ruhnau was cautious. He did not want to leave his 
short-dollar position uncovered (unhedged). So he chose 
to “split the difference” and purchased a forward contract to

franc drops to, say, $0.575 = SF1.00, Hans will deliver francs to the writer and receive $0.585 
per SF. The francs can now be purchased on the spot market for $0.575 each. Because the cost 
of the option was $0.005 per SF, he will have a net gain of $0.005 per SF.
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 223 02/05/23 5:17 PM224 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Explicitly, the profit to the holder of a put option if the spot rate is less than the strike 
price, with a strike price $0.585, a premium of $0.005, and a spot rate of $0.575, is
Profit = Strike Price - (Spot Rate + Premium)
= $0.585 - 1 $0.575 + $0.0052
= $0.005perSF
The break-even price for the put option is the strike price less the premium, or $0.580 in 
this case. As the spot rate falls further and further below the strike price, the profit potential 
continues to increase, and Hans’ profit could be up to a maximum of $0.580, when the price 
of a franc would be zero. At any exchange rate above the strike price of 58.5, Hans would not 
exercise the option, and so would lose only the $0.005 premium paid per SF for the put option. 
The buyer of a put option has an almost unlimited profit potential with a limited loss potential. 
Like the buyer of a call, the buyer of a put can never lose more than the premium paid up front.
Writer of a Put
The position of the writer who sold the put option to Hans is shown in Exhibit 7.6. Note the 
symmetry of profit/loss, strike price, and break-even prices between the buyer and the writer 
of the put. If the spot price of francs drops below $0.585 per franc, Hans will exercise the op￾tion. Below a price of $0.585 per franc—below breakeven—the writer will lose more than the 
premium received from writing the option ($0.005 per SF). Between $0.580 and $0.585 the 
writer will lose part, but not all, of the premium received. If the spot price is above $0.585, 
Hans will not exercise the option, and the option writer will pocket the entire premium of 
$0.005.

The profit (or loss) earned by the writer of a $0.585 strike price put, premium $0.005, at 
a spot rate of $0.575, is
Profit = Premium - (StrikePrice - SpotRate)
= $0.005 - ($0.585 - $0.575)
= - $0.005 per SF
but only for spot rates that are less than or equal to the strike price. At spot rates greater than 
the strike price, the option expires out-of-the-money and the writer keeps the premium. The 
writer of the put option has the same combination of outcomes available to the writer of a 
call: limited profit potential and loss potential.
Currency options can be combined in a variety of ways to produce even more complex 
and powerful structures. Unfortunately, they do not always turn out for the best, as described 
in Global Finance in Practice 7.2.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 7.2
and the calls were exercised against the buyers of the KiKo 
products. The Korean companies that had purchased the 
KiKo options from the Korean banks suffered massive finan￾cial losses because of the multiple notional principles.
The losses resulted in the filing of hundreds of lawsuits 
in Korean courts. Korean manufacturers that had purchased 
the KiKos sued the Korean banks to avoid the payment of 
losses that would in many cases bankrupt the companies.
Exporters argued that the Korean banks had sold 
them complex products which they did not understand. 
The lack of understanding was on at least two different lev￾els. First, many of the KiKo contracts were only in English, 
and many buyers did not understand English. (The KiKos 
had actually been created by a number of major Western 
hedge funds that then sold the products through the Korean 
banks.) Secondly, exporters argued that the risks associ￾ated with the KiKos were not adequately explained to them. 
The exporters argued that the Korean banks had a duty to 
adequately explain to them the risks and—even more impor￾tantly—only sell them products that were suitable for their 
needs. (Under U.S. law this would be termed a “fiduciary 
responsibility.”) The Korean banks responded they had no 
such specific duty, and regardless, they had explained the 
risks sufficiently. The banks argued that this was not a case 
of an unsophisticated buyer not understanding a complex 
product; both buyer and seller were sufficiently sophisti￾cated to understand the intricate workings and risks of these 
structures.
In the end the Korean courts found in favor of the ex￾porters in some cases and in favor of the banks in others. 
One principle that the courts followed was that the exporters 
found themselves in “changed circumstances” in which the 
change in the spot exchange rate was unforeseeable and the 
losses resulting too great. But some firms—for example, GM 
Daewoo—the losses were enormous, almost $1 billion.
Exotic Options: Caveat Emptor
Banks have acquired a bit of a shady reputation over the 
years when it comes to their marketing of exotic financial 
derivatives. The sale by South Korean banks of KiKos—
knock-in knock-out option agreements—is a prime example. 
Between 2006 and 2008, Korean banks sold these complex 
option agreements to major Korean exporters who feared 
that the Korean won’s (KRW) recent appreciation—although 
only marginal in size—against their major trading partner, the 
U.S., would continue. If the won did continue to rise in value 
against the dollar (USD), their competitiveness, sales, and 
ultimately, profitability was in danger.
The KiKos were a complex option agreement that basi￾cally bet that the won would continue to trade in a relatively 
narrow range against the dollar. It combined the sale of call 
options on the KRW, the knock-in component, with the pur￾chase of put options on the dollar, the knock-out compo￾nent. Selling calls earned a premium, while purchasing puts 
required paying a premium. The problem was that the puts 
possessed strike rates which were very close to the current 
spot rate, making their purchase very expensive. In order to 
construct a net-zero premium position (or close to it for sal￾ability to the Korean exporters), the call options sold were for 
multiples of the notional principal of the puts. This last part 
was called the “turbo feature.”
An added feature intensified the complexity—the feature 
related to the “knock” term. If the spot exchange rate at any 
time during the contract fell below the put option strike rate, 
the put options automatically canceled, or knocked out. If 
the spot exchange rate at any time during the contract rose 
above (meaning more and more KRW to get a USD), the call 
option strike rate knocked in, requiring the Korean companies 
to deliver on the call options they had sold.
In early 2008, the KRW started falling against the USD, 
rapidly. The spot rate quickly blew through the knock-in rate,

7.3 Option Pricing and Valuation
Exhibit 7.7 illustrates the profit/loss profile of a European-style call option on British pounds. 
The call option allows the holder to buy British pounds at a strike price of $1.70/£. It has a 
90-day maturity. The value of this call option is actually the sum of two components:
Total Value 1premium2 = Intrinsic Value + Time Value
The pricing of any currency option combines six elements. For example, this 
European-style call option on British pounds has a premium of $0.033/£ (3.3 cents per 
pound) at a spot rate of $1.70=£1.00. This premium is calculated using the following assump￾tions: a spot rate of $1.70=£1.00, a 90-day maturity, a $1.70=£1.00 forward rate, both U.S. dollar 
and British pound interest rates of 8.00% per annum, and an option volatility for the 90-day 
period of 10.00% per annum.
Intrinsic value is the financial gain if the option is exercised immediately. It is shown by 
the solid line in Exhibit 7.7, which is zero until it reaches the strike price, then rises linearly (1 
cent for each 1-cent increase in the spot rate). Intrinsic value will be zero when the option is 
out-of-the-money—that is, when the strike price is above the market price—as no gain can be 
derived from exercising the option. When the spot rate rises above the strike price, the intrin￾sic value becomes positive because the option is always worth at least this value if exercised. 
On the date of maturity, an option will have a value equal to its intrinsic value (zero time 
remaining means zero time value).
Exhibit 7.7 (graphically) and Exhibit 7.8 (table) illustrate all three value elements of the 
$1.70 strike 90-day call option on British pounds across a spectrum of spot rates. When the

spot rate is $1.75/£, the option is in-the-money and has positive time (¢1.356 per £) and intrin￾sic values (¢5.000 per £). When the spot rate is $1.70 = £1.00—the same as the option strike 
rate—the option is at-the-money, has no intrinsic value, but does have time value (¢3.302 per £). 
When the spot rate is $1.65 = £1.00, the option is out-of-the-money, has no intrinsic value, but 
does have a time value (¢1.372 per £).
The time value of an option exists because the price of the underlying currency, the spot 
rate, can potentially move further and further into the money before the option’s expira￾tion. Time value is shown in Exhibit 7.7 as the area between the total value of the option 
and its intrinsic value. An investor will pay something today for an out-of-the-money op￾tion (i.e., zero intrinsic value) on the chance that the spot rate will move far enough before 
maturity to move the option in-the-money. Consequently, the price of an option is always 
somewhat greater than its intrinsic value, since there is always some chance—some might 
say “hope everlasting”—that the intrinsic value will rise by the expiration date. Global

$700 million in size, while all other BT traders were restricted 
to $50 million.) Krieger is purported to have shorted 200 mil￾lion kiwi, more than the entire New Zealand money supply at 
the time. His view proved correct. The kiwi fell, and Krieger 
was able to earn millions in currency gains for BT. Months 
later, Krieger resigned when bonuses were announced and 
he was reportedly awarded only $3 million on the $300 mil￾lion profit.
Eventually, the New Zealand central bank lodged com￾plaints with BT, in which the CEO at the time, Charles S. 
Sanford Jr., seemingly added insult to injury when he report￾edly remarked, “We didn’t take too big a position for Bankers 
Trust, but we may have taken too big a position for that 
market.”
The New Zealand Kiwi and Andrew Krieger
In 1987 Andrew Krieger was a 31-year-old currency trader 
for Bankers Trust of New York (BT). Following the U.S. stock 
market crash in October 1987, the world’s currency markets 
moved rapidly to exit the dollar. Many of the world’s other 
currencies—including small ones that were in stable, open, 
industrialized markets, like that of New Zealand—became the 
subject of interest. As the world dumped dollars and bought 
kiwis, the value of the kiwi rose.
Krieger believed that the markets were overreacting. He 
took a short position on the kiwi, betting on its eventual fall, 
in a big way, combining spot, forward, and options positions.

7.4 Currency Option Pricing Sensitivity
If currency options are to be used effectively, either for the purposes of speculation or risk 
management (covered in the coming chapters), the individual trader needs to know how op￾tion values—premiums—react to their various components. The following section will ana￾lyze these six basic sensitivities:
1. The impact of changing forward rates
2. The impact of changing spot rates
3. The impact of time to maturity
4. The impact of changing volatility
5. The impact of changing interest differentials
6. The impact of alternative option strike prices
Forward Rate Sensitivity
Although rarely noted, standard foreign currency options are priced around the forward rate 
because the current spot rate and both the domestic and foreign interest rates (home cur￾rency and foreign currency rates) are included in the option premium calculation.
Recall from Chapter 4 that the forward rate is calculated from the current spot rate and 
the two subject currency interest rates for the desired maturity. For example, the 90-day for￾ward rate for the call option on British pounds described above, a spot rate of $1.70 = £1.00, 
with both interest rates at 8.0% per annum, is calculated as follows:
F90 = $1.70 *
c 1 + a.08 *
90
360
b d
c 1 + a.08 *
90
360
b d
= $1.70
Regardless of the specific strike rate chosen and priced, the forward rate is central to valu￾ation. The option-pricing formula calculates a subjective probability distribution centered on 
the forward rate. This approach does not mean that the market expects the forward rate to be 
equal to the future spot rate, it is simply a result of the arbitrage-pricing structure of options.
The forward rate focus also provides helpful information for the trader managing a po￾sition. When the market prices a foreign currency option, it does so without any bullish or 
bearish sentiment on the direction of the foreign currency’s value relative to the domestic 
currency. If the trader has specific expectations about the future spot rate’s direction, those 
expectations can be put to work. A trader will not be inherently betting against the market. 
In a following section we will also describe how a change in the interest differential between 
currencies, the theoretical foundation of forward rates, also alters the value of the option.
Spot Rate Sensitivity (delta)
The call option on British pounds depicted in Exhibit 5.8 possesses a premium that exceeds 
the intrinsic value of the option over the entire range of spot rates surrounding the strike 
rate. As long as the option has time remaining before expiration, the option will possess this 
time value element. This characteristic is one of the primary reasons why an American-style 
option, which can be exercised on any day up to and including the expiration date, is seldom 
actually exercised prior to expiration. If the option holder wishes to liquidate it for its value, 
it would normally be sold, not exercised, so any remaining time value can also be captured by 
the holder. If the current spot rate falls on the side of the option’s strike price which would 
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 228 02/05/23 5:17 PMCHAPTER 7 Foreign Currency Derivatives: Futures and Options 229
induce the option holder to exercise the option upon expiration, the option also has an in￾trinsic value. The call option illustrated in Exhibit 7.7 is in-the-money at spot rates to the right 
of the strike rate of $1.70, at-the-money at $1.70, and out-of-the-money at spot rates less than 
$1.70=£1.00.
The vertical distance between the market value and the intrinsic value of a call option 
on pounds is greatest at a spot rate of $1.70 = £1.00. At $1.70 the spot rate equals the strike 
price (at-the-money). This premium of 3.30 cents per pound consists entirely of time value. In 
fact, the value of any option which is currently out-of-the-money (OTM) is made up entirely 
of time value. The further the option’s strike price is out-of-the-money, the lower the value 
or premium of the option. This is because the market believes the probability of this option 
actually moving into the exercise range prior to expiration is significantly less than one which 
is already at-the-money. If the spot rate were to fall to $1.68 = £1.00, the option premium falls 
to 2.39 cents/£—again, entirely time value. If the spot rate were to rise above the strike rate 
to $1.72, the premium rises to 4.39 cents/£. In this case, the premium represents an intrinsic 
value of 2.00 cents ($1.72 - $1.70) plus a time value element of 2.39 cents. Note the symmetry 
of time value premiums (2.39 cents) to the left and to the right of the strike rate.
The symmetry of option valuation about the strike rate is seen by decomposing the op￾tion premiums into their respective intrinsic and time values. Exhibit 7.8 illustrates how vary￾ing the current spot rate by ; $0.05 about the strike rate of $1.70 alters each option’s intrinsic 
and time values.
The sensitivity of the option premium to a small change in the spot exchange rate is called 
the delta. For example, the delta of the $1.70 call option, when the spot rate changes from $1.70 
to $1.71, is simply the change in the premium divided by the change in the spot rate:
Delta = ∆ premium
∆ spot rate = $0.038 - $0.033
$1.71 - $1.70 = 0.5
If the delta of the specific option is known, it is easy to determine how the option’s value 
will change as the spot rate changes. If the spot rate changes by one cent ($0.01 per £), given a 
delta of 0.5, the option premium would change by 0.5 * $0.01, or $0.005. If the initial premium 
was $0.033 per £, and the spot rate increased by 1 cent (from $1.70 to $1.71), the new option 
premium would be $0.033 + $0.005 = $0.038. Delta varies between +1 and 0 for a call option 
and -1 and 0 for a put option.
Traders in options categorize individual options by their delta rather than in-the-money, 
at-the-money, or out-of-the-money. As an option moves further in-the-money, like the 
in-the-money option in Exhibit 5.10, delta rises toward 1.0 (in this case to .71). As an option 
moves further out-of-the-money, delta falls toward zero. Note that the out-of-the-money op￾tion in Exhibit 5.10 has a delta of only .28.1
Rule of Thumb: The higher the delta (deltas of .7 or .8 and up are considered high) the 
greater the probability of the option expiring in-the-money.
Time to Maturity: Value and Deterioration (theta)
Option values increase with the length of time to maturity. The expected change in the option 
premium from a small change in the time to expiration is termed theta. Theta is calculated 
as the change in the option premium over the change in time. If the $1.70 = £1.00 call option 
were to age 1 day from its initial 90-day maturity, the theta of the call option would be the 
1 The expected change in the option’s delta resulting from a small change in the spot rate is termed gamma. It is 
often used as a measure of the stability of a specific option’s delta. Gamma is utilized in the construction of more 
sophisticated hedging strategies which focus on deltas (delta-neutral strategies).
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 229 02/05/23 5:17 PM230 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
difference in the two premiums, 3.30 cents per £ and 3.28 cents per £ (assuming a spot rate of 
$1.70 = £1.00):
Theta = ∆ premium
∆ time = c3.30 - c3.28
90 - 89 = 0.02
Theta is based not on a linear relationship with time, but rather the square root of time. 
Option premiums deteriorate at an increasing rate as they approach expiration. In fact, the 
majority of the option premium—depending on the individual option—is lost in the final 30 
days prior to expiration.
This exponential relationship between option premium and time is seen in the ratio of 
option values between the three-month and the one-month at-the-money maturities. The 
ratio for the at-the-money call option is not 3 to 1 (holding all other components constant), 
but rather 1.73 times the price.
Premium of 3 month
Premium of 1 month = 23
21 = 1.73
1.00 = 1.73
The rapid deterioration of option values in the last days prior to expiration is seen by 
once again calculating the theta of the $1.70 = £1.00 call option, but now as its remaining ma￾turity moves from 15 days to 14 days:
Theta = ∆ premium
∆ time = c1.37 - c1.32
15 - 14 = .05
A decrease of one day in the time to maturity now reduces the option premium by .05 
cents per £, rather than only .02 cents per £ as it did when the maturity was 90 days.
The implications of time value deterioration for traders are quite significant. A trader 
purchasing an option with only one or two months until expiration will see the option’s value 
deteriorate rapidly. If the trader were to then sell the option, it would have a significantly 
smaller market value in the periods immediately following its purchase. At the same time, 
however, a trader who is buying options of longer maturities will pay more, but not propor￾tionately more, for the longer maturity option. A  six-month option’s premium is approxi￾mately 2.45 times more expensive than the one-month, while the 12-month option would 
be only 3.46 times more expensive than the one-month. This implies that two three-month 
options do not equal one six-month option.
Rule of Thumb: A trader will normally find longer-maturity options better values, giving 
the trader the ability to alter an option position without suffering significant time value 
deterioration.
Sensitivity to Volatility (lambda)
There are few words in the financial field more used and abused than volatility. Option vola￾tility is defined as the standard deviation of daily percentage changes in the underlying ex￾change rate. Volatility is important to option value because of an exchange rate’s perceived 
likelihood to move either into or out of the range in which the option would be exercised. If 
the exchange rate’s volatility is rising, and therefore the risk of the option being exercised is 
increasing, the option premium would be increasing.
Volatility is stated in percent per annum. For example, an option may be described as 
having a 12.6% annual volatility. The percentage change for a single day can be found as 
follows:
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 230 02/05/23 5:17 PMCHAPTER 7 Foreign Currency Derivatives: Futures and Options 231
12.6%
2365 = 12.6%
19.105 = 0.66% daily volatility
For our $1.70 strike call option, an increase in annual volatility of 1 percentage point—for 
example, from 10.0% to 11.0%—will increase the option premium from $0.033 per £ to $0.036 
per £. The marginal change in the option premium is equal to the change in the option pre￾mium itself divided by the change in volatility:
∆ premium
∆ volatility = $0.036 - $0.033
.11 - .10 = 0.30
The primary problem with volatility is that it is unobservable; it is the only input into the 
option pricing formula that is determined subjectively by the trader pricing the option. No 
single correct method for its calculation exists. The problem is one of forecasting; historical 
volatility is not necessarily an accurate predictor of the future volatility of the exchange rate’s 
movement, yet there is little to go on except history.
Volatility is viewed three ways: historic, where the volatility is drawn from a recent period 
of time; forward-looking, where the historic volatility is altered to reflect expectations about 
the future period over which the option will exist; and implied, where the volatility is backed 
out of the market price of the option.
Historic Volatility. Historic volatility is normally measured as the percentage movement in 
the spot rate on a daily, 6-, or 12-hour basis over the previous 10, 30, or even 90 days.
Forward-Looking Volatility. Alternatively, an option trader may adjust recent historic 
volatilities for expected market swings or events, either upward or downward. If option trad￾ers believe that the immediate future will be the same as the recent past, the historic volatility 
will equal the forward-looking volatility. If, however, the future period is expected to experi￾ence greater or lesser volatility, the historic measure must be altered for option pricing.
Implied Volatility. Implied volatility is equivalent to having the answers to the test; implied 
volatilities are calculated by being backed out of the market option premium values traded. 
Since volatility is the only unobservable element of the option premium price, after all other 
components are accounted for, the residual value of volatility implied by the price is found.
Sample implied volatilities for a number of currency pairs are listed in Exhibit 7.9. The 
exhibit clearly illustrates that option volatilities vary considerably across currencies, and that 
the relationship between volatility and maturity (time to expiration) does not move just one 
direction. For example, the first exchange rate quoted, the US$/euro cross-rate, initially falls 
from 8.1% volatility at one week to 7.4% for the 1-month and 2-month maturities and then 
rises to 9.3% for the 3-year maturity.
Because volatilities are the only judgmental component that the option writer con￾tributes, they play a critical role in the pricing of options. All currency pairs have historical 
series that contribute to the formation of the expectations of option writers. But in the end, 
the truly talented option writers are those with the intuition and insight to price the future 
effectively.
Like all futures markets, option volatilities react instantaneously and negatively to unset￾tling economic and political events (see the mini-case at the end of this chapter for a look at 
currency volatility over the past decade, including the global pandemic). A doubling of vola￾tility for an at-the-money option will result in an equivalent doubling of the option’s price. 
Most currency option traders focus their activities on predicting movements of currency vola￾tility in the short run, because short-run movements move price the most. For example, option 
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 231 02/05/23 5:17 PM232 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
volatilities rose significantly in the months preceding the Persian Gulf War, in September 
1992 when the European Monetary System was in crisis, in 1997 after the onset of the Asian 
financial crisis, in the days following the terrorist attacks on the U.S. in September 2001, 
and in the months following the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008. In all 
instances, option volatilities for major cross-currency combinations rose to nearly 20% for 
extended periods. As a result, premium costs rose by corresponding amounts.
Rule of Thumb: Traders who believe volatilities will fall significantly in the near-term will 
sell (write) options now, hoping to buy them back for a profit immediately after volatilities 
fall causing option premiums to fall.
Sensitivity to Changing Interest Rate Differentials (rho and phi)
At the start of this section we pointed out that currency option prices and values are focused 
on the forward rate. The forward rate is in turn based on the theory of interest rate parity dis￾cussed previously in Chapter 6. Interest rate changes in either currency will alter the forward 
rate, which in turn will alter the option’s premium or value. The expected change in the op￾tion premium from a small change in the domestic interest rate (home currency) is term rho. 
The expected change in the option premium from a small change in the foreign interest rate 
(foreign currency) is termed phi.
Continuing with our numerical example, an increase in the U.S. dollar interest rate from 
8.0% to 9.0% increases the ATM call option premium on British pounds from $0.033 per £ to 
$0.035 per £. This is a rho value of positive 0.2
Rho = ∆ Premium
∆ US dollar interest rate = $0.035 - $0.033
9.0% - 8.0% = 0.2
A similar 1% increase in the foreign interest rate, the pound sterling rate in this case, 
reduces the option value (premium) from $0.033 per £ to $0.031 per £. The phi for this call 
option premium is therefore a negative 0.2.

∆ foreign interest rate = $0.031 - $0.033
9.0% - 8.0% = -0.2
For example, throughout the 1990s U.S. dollar (domestic currency) interest rates were 
substantially lower than pound sterling (foreign currency) interest rates. This meant that 
the pound consistently sold forward at a discount versus the U.S. dollar. If this interest 
differential were to widen (from either U.S. interest rates falling or foreign currency inter￾est rates rising or some combination of both), the pound would sell forward at a larger 
discount. An increase in the forward discount is the same as a decrease in the forward rate 
(in U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency). The option premium condition above states 
that the premium must increase as interest rate differentials increase (assuming spot rates 
remain unchanged).
For the option trader, an expectation on the differential between interest rates can ob￾viously help in the evaluation of where the option value is headed. For example, when for￾eign interest rates are higher than domestic interest rates, the foreign currency sells forward 
at a discount. This results in relatively lower call option premiums (and lower put option 
premiums).
Rule of Thumb: A trader who is purchasing a call option on foreign currency should do 
so before the domestic interest rate rises. This will allow the trader to purchase the option 
before its price increases.
Alternative Strike Prices and Option Premiums
The sixth and final element that is important in option valuation (but, thankfully, has no 
Greek alias) is the selection of the actual strike price. Although we have conducted all 
of our sensitivity analysis using the strike price of $1.70 = £1.00 (a forward-at-the-money 
strike rate), a firm purchasing an option in the OTC market may choose its own strike rate. 
Options with strike rates that are already in-the-money will have both intrinsic and time 
value elements. Options with strike rates which are out-of-the-money will have only a time 
value component.
Exhibit 7.10 summarizes the various “Greek” elements and impacts discussed in the pre￾vious sections. The option premium is one of the most complex concepts in financial theory, 
and the application of option pricing to exchange rates does not make it any simpler. Only

■ Futures also require collateral and are normally set￾tled through the purchase of an offsetting position.
■ Corporate financial managers typically prefer foreign 
currency forwards over futures out of simplicity of use 
and position maintenance. Financial speculators typi￾cally prefer foreign currency futures over forwards be￾cause of the liquidity of the futures markets.
■ Foreign currency options are financial contracts that 
give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 
(in the case of calls) or sell (in the case of puts) a speci￾fied amount of foreign exchange at a predetermined 
price on or before a specified maturity date.
■ The use of a currency option as a speculative device for 
the buyer of an option arises from the fact that an option 
gains in value as the underlying currency rises (for calls) 
or falls (for puts). The amount of loss to the buyer of an 
option when the underlying currency moves opposite to 
the desired direction is limited to the option premium.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 7.4
Although it is not clear that either party ever wished for GM to 
ever actually acquire Fiat, the put option was seen by lead￾ership at Fiat as a type of insurance against an unprofitable 
future (a financial out), but both parties agreed there was little 
likelihood of the put ever being exercised.
In the fall of 2004 Fiat’s fortunes were reaching rock￾bottom prospects; bankruptcy loomed. Fiat began to publicly 
discuss the fact that it believed it had the right to sell itself (the put 
option) to GM. GM responded by making noises that it did not 
believe the clause was enforceable (it did not want to buy Fiat) 
and also threatened that if it did have to acquire Fiat, it would 
most likely shut it down. This did not sit well with Italian auto￾workers. The Italian autoworkers went on strike in December 
2004 in opposition to any closure and any sale to GM.
On February 13, 2005, in what has become known as 
the Valentine’s Day Annulment, GM and Fiat announced they 
had agreed to terminate the agreement, including canceling 
the put option and unwinding of the joint ventures between 
the two companies. The price of annulment, however, was 
all GM’s. GM paid Fiat $2.3 billion to cancel the agreement.
GM and Fiat’s Put Option
Option theory has long been utilized in corporate strategy. In 
the late 1990s the global automobile industry went through 
a period of consolidation. Companies like Daimler Benz 
(Germany) and Chrysler (U.S.) combined as the industry tried 
to deal with increasing costs and overcapacity. General Motors 
(GM, U.S.) appeared to have been left out in the cold, but GM 
had shown no real sense of urgency in pursing any deals.
In early 2000, however, DaimlerChrysler offered to buy 
Fiat Auto (Italy) out. This threatened GM in terms of markets 
and opportunities. GM quickly signed an alliance agreement 
with Fiat. The agreement involved an exchange of shares, 
GM taking a 20% interest in Fiat Auto and Fiat taking a 5.1% 
interest in GM, in addition to creating a number of joint ven￾tures for engineering development and procurement.
The agreement also included a put option. The put gave 
Fiat the right to sell its remaining shares (the remaining 80% 
interest not held by GM) to GM, beginning 3.5 years follow￾ing the agreement and expiring 9 years after the agreement. 
with a considerable amount of time and effort can the individual be expected to attain a 
“second-sense” in the management of currency option positions.
Prudence in Practice
In the following chapters we will illustrate how derivatives can be used to reduce the risks 
associated with the conduct of multinational financial management. It is critical, however, 
that the user of any financial tool or technique—including financial derivatives—follow 
sound principles and practices. Many a firm has been ruined as a result of the misuse of 
derivatives. A word to the wise: Do not fall victim to what many refer to as the gambler’s 
dilemma—confusing luck with talent. Major corporate financial disasters related to finan￾cial derivatives continue to be a problem in global business. As is the case with so many 
issues in modern society, technology is not the problem, the problem is user error—human 
users. Global Finance in Practice 7.4 describes how one use of options did indeed include 
human error.

■ The use of a currency option as a speculative device 
for the writer (seller) of an option arises from the op￾tion premium. If the option—either a put or call—ex￾pires out-of-the-money (valueless), the writer of the 
option has earned and retains the entire premium.
■ Speculation is an attempt to profit by trading on ex￾pectations about prices in the future. In the foreign 
exchange market, one speculates by taking a position 
in a foreign currency and then closing that position af￾terward; a profit results only if the rate moves in the 
direction that the speculator expected.
■ Currency option valuation, the determination of the 
option’s premium, is a complex combination of the 
current spot rate, the specific strike rate, the forward 
rate (which itself is dependent on the current spot rate 
and interest differentials), currency volatility, and time 
to maturity.
■ The total value of an option is the sum of its intrinsic 
value and time value. Intrinsic value depends on the 
relationship between the option’s strike price and the 
current spot rate at any single point in time, whereas 
time value estimates how intrinsic value may change—
for the better—prior to maturity.
The Ups and Downs of Volatility2
Global currency volatility reached its lowest level in 
more than 40 years in January 2020. It would prove to 
be the true bottom before the bounce.
In January 2020 the United States and China signed a trade 
agreement ending a long-standing spat in which the U.S. 
accused China of manipulating the value of the Chinese 
renminbi. The agreement was considered enormously im￾portant—calming the relationship between the world’s 
two largest trading partners. In the days that followed, JP 
Morgan’s Global FX Volatility Index, a measure of currency 
volatility, hit a record low of 5.18, a value approached but 
never reached over the previous 20 years. This of course 
made currency options extremely cheap. As illustrated in 
Exhibit A, each of the previous record lows was followed by 
short and significant increases in volatility. Fundamentalists 
would of course look to find economic drivers of these 
changes, while technical chartists would see trend and bar￾riers driving change. Regardless, in January 2020 currency 
volatility globally was a sea of glass.
Global Pandemic (COVID)
Investors are scrambling to adjust their portfolios to a 
surge of volatility in foreign exchange markets, as the 
coronavirus outbreak and massive swings in oil prices 
roil currencies around the globe.
—“Explosion in Forex Volatility Cheers Some, Bruises Others 
as Virus Fears Drive Swings,” Reuters, March 11, 2020.
Every global currency trader wishes that, in the early 
spring of 2020, they could have possessed that most

mystical of capabilities—the third eye. Having an organ 
with which the individual investor or currency trader 
could see the future would have been quite an advantage. 
With March 2020 came COVID—the global pandemic. 
And to add insult to injury, a nearly instantaneous drop 
in global oil prices sent markets spiraling downward 
even further. Currency volatilities soared. The volatili￾ties associated with the world’s three most widely traded 
currencies—the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Japanese 
yen—all spiked upward. Exhibit B illustrates how im￾plied volatilities on at-the-money (ATM) strike rate calls 
on both the yen and the euro skyrocketed to 16% and 
13%, respectively.
Everyone knows what followed—2020, the year of 
lemons: Global pandemic, quarantine, isolation, unem￾ployment, and economic crisis. Eventually, in 2021, through 
social distancing, a multitude of anti-pandemic practices, 
and the development of vaccines, much of the world 
returned to some form of new normal.
The world’s currency markets, however, recovered 
much more rapidly. For global currencies like the dollar, 
euro, and yen, recovery took only two to three months 
to return to moderate volatilities. For country curren￾cies that always seemed to suffer more debilitating times 
like the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, the recovery 
in option volatilities was slower and more muted, as il￾lustrated in Exhibit C. Currencies like the peso and real 
are, unfortunately, a bit more used to suffering such high 
volatilities, induced by political uncertainties or periodic 
bouts of inflation or currency uncertainty. But the global 
stalwarts—the dollar, euro, and yen—rarely have experi￾enced such volatility, such as that of the global financial 
crisis in 2008–2009.

Option Trading
The more violently prices fluctuate, the more chance 
there is that an out-of-the-money option . . . becomes a 
winning lottery ticket at some point before it matures.
—“When You Have Options, Volatility 
Is Your Friend,” The Economist, May 11, 2019.
Fear, anxiety, uncertainty, volatility—one and the same. 
When selling currency options, or holding currency op￾tions, volatility is said to be your friend.3
 The logic is sim￾ple. Increases in volatility drive increases in the value of 
options.
There are hundreds of different option trading strat￾egies, and the unpredictability of volatility is at the core 
of many. Currency option pricing is based on choices—the 
currency pair, the strike rate, the time to maturity, observ￾ables—the appropriate term interest rates associated with 
the two currencies, and one unknowable—what the vol￾atility will be for the coming term. As is fundamental to 
economics and finance, when we do not know the future, 
we analyze the past. Most option volatility assumptions 
for pricing are based on extrapolation of what similar vol￾atilities have been for the most recent past.
This is not a surprising problem. No one knows the 
future. Even Fischer Black, the Nobel Prize–winning 
co-developer of modern option pricing theory with 
Myron Scholes, noted, “The Black-Scholes formula is still 
around, even though it depends on 10 unrealistic assump￾tions.”4
 A major flaw was that the pricing formulas for 
assets of any kind—stocks, bonds, and currencies among 
others—assumed the assets’ volatilities were known and 
fixed. They are not. He also noted that volatility differ￾ences would have profound impacts on far-out-of-the￾money strike rates. He then offered some advice. “You 
should ‘buy volatility’ if you think volatility will rise, and 
‘sell volatility’ if you think it will fall.” He also noted that 
far out-of-the-money options were extremely sensitive to 
changes in volatility. This proved a fruitful line of thought 
for some.

3 A fellow student of the author’s in graduate school once asked the professor what he thought about the future direction of the U.S. 
dollar. The academic, after pause, said the following: “I don’t know, that is why I am teaching. And, theoretically, if I did know, and could 
profit from knowing, why would I tell you?”

Tail Risk (Fat Tails)
Put another way, investors are more volatile than 
investments. Economic reality governs the returns 
earned by our businesses, and Black Swans are un￾likely. But emotions and perceptions—the swings of 
hope, greed, and fear among the participants in our 
financial system—govern the returns earned in our 
markets. Emotional factors magnify or minimize this 
central core of economic reality, and Black Swans can 
appear at any time.
—John C. Bogle, Founder of The Vanguard Group.5
One man has spent much of his career developing theories 
along similar lines: Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Taleb published 
a book in 2001 titled Fooled by Randomness in which he 
introduced the analogy of the black swan.6
 The argument 
is quite simple: Prior to the discovery of Australia and the 
existence of black swans, all swans were thought to be white. 
Black swans did not exist because no one had ever seen one. 
But that did not mean they did not exist. Taleb then applied 
this premise to financial markets, arguing that simply be￾cause a specific event had never occurred did not mean it 
couldn’t. He concluded that most statistically based analy￾ses, whether it be portfolios or options, regularly underesti￾mated the probabilities associated with extreme events.
Taleb argued that a black swan event is characterized by 
three fundamentals, in order:
1. Rarity: The event is a shock or surprise to the observer.
2. Extremeness: The event has a major impact.
3. Retrospective predictability: After the event has oc￾curred, the event is rationalized by hindsight and 
found to have been predictable.
Although the third argument is a characteristic of 
human intellectual nature, it is the first element which is fun￾damental to the debate. If an event has not been recorded, 
does that mean it cannot occur? Option theory is a mathe￾matical analysis of inputs and assumptions. Its outcomes are 
no better than its inputs. The theory itself does not predict 
price movements. It simply prices rights on the basis of cur￾rent market conditions and assumptions about the future 
based on the recent past—a past that has occurred.
Taleb does not argue that he has some secret ability 
to predict the future when historical data cannot. Rather, 
he argues that investors should structure their invest￾ments to either protect against or embrace the extremes. 
Leverage the improbable events rather than the probable
ones. He argues for what many call “investment humility,” 
to acknowledge that the world we live in is not always the 
one we think we live in and to understand how much we 
will never understand.
For example, traditional Black-Scholes option pricing 
assumes that volatility is normally distributed. This means 
that the model assumes that there is a 99.7% probability 
of volatility occurring within three standard deviations of 
the mean (or 0.3% of it falling outside three standard de￾viations). But what if this is underestimating the probabil￾ity of volatility falling outside? This is what is referred to 
as tail-risk or alternatively relatively fat tails of the normal 
distribution.
Taleb developed investing strategies based on this 
inappropriate distribution of probabilities in his opin￾ion. The barbel strategy combines safe investments with 
opportunities. An investor should create a strategy that 
was shaped like a barbel. Most of the capital, say 90%, 
should be invested in very low-risk investments, like 
Treasury bonds. These investments are likely to yield 
the traditional results seen in normal distributions. But, 
cognizant of the bias or inadequacies of traditional sta￾tistics, the investor should also invest some small por￾tion, say 10%, of their capital in the extremes—the ends 
of the barbel. These extremes, the potential fat tails of 
the unknowable distribution, performed like lottery 
tickets. They generally never occur and therefore expire 
worthless. But, but, in rare cases, they prove true and ex￾tremely valuable.
Currency option pricing in the marketplace must fol￾low rational thought and statistical methods. They need 
predictions of what may come, even if it is generally based 
on the past, a past which may not include the so-called 
“outliers.” Kenneth Arrow, a famed economist and Nobel 
Prize winner himself, relayed the following story about 
statistics, forecasting, and humans recognizing what they 
don’t know. During the World War II a group of statisti￾cians were tasked with forecasting weather patterns over 
the English Channel.
5 “Black Monday and Black Swans,” Remarks by John C. Bogle, Founder and Former Chief Executive, The Vanguard Group, before the 
Risk Management Association, Boca Raton, Florida, October 11, 2007, p. 6.
6 Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets, Random House, 2001. He later 
extended his premise to many other fields beyond finance in The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, Random House, 2007.
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 238 02/05/23 5:17 PMThe statisticians subjected these forecasts to verifica￾tion and found they differed in no way from chance. 
The forecasters themselves were convinced and 
requested that the forecasts be discontinued. The reply 
read approximately like this: “The Commanding 
General is well aware that the forecasts are no good. 
However, he needs them for planning purposes.”7
Taleb, in a revised edition of Black Swan Theory, noted 
that “the event,” whatever it may be, is a surprise to the 
specific observer and that “what is a surprise to the turkey 
is not a surprise to the butcher.” The challenge of course is 
to avoid being the turkey.

wishes to borrow $8,000,000 for eight weeks. A rate 
of 6.250% per annum is quoted by potential lenders 
in New York, Great Britain, and Switzerland using, 
respectively, international, British, and the Swiss￾eurobond definitions of interest (day count conven￾tions). Although all three currency markets assume 
a 360-day year for interest rate calculations, the U.S. 
and British markets use the exact number of days in 
the period in question, 56 days in this case, while the 
Swiss market assumes a standardized 30-day month.

euros with a strike price of £1.2500 = €1.00 at a pre￾mium of 3.80 cents per euro (£0.0380 per €) and with 
an expiration date three months from now. The option 
is for 100,000 euros. Calculate Anna’s profit or loss 
should he exercise before maturity at a time when the 
euro is traded spot at strike prices beginning at £1.10 =
€1.00, rising to £1.40 = €1.00 in increments of £0.05.

of currencies. The investors expect annual returns in 
excess of 25%. Although officed in London, all ac￾counts and expectations are based in U.S. dollars.
Arthur is convinced that the British pound will 
slide significantly—possibly to $1.3200 = £1.00—in

CHAPTER 7 APPENDIX 
Currency Option Pricing Theory
The foreign currency option model presented here, the European style option, is the result 
of the work of Black and Scholes (1972), Cox and Ross (1976), Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein 
(1979), Garman and Kohlhagen (1983), and Bodurtha and Courtadon (1987). Although we 
do not explain the theoretical derivation of the following option-pricing model, the original 
model derived by Black and Scholes is based on the formation of a riskless hedged portfolio 
composed of a long position in the security, asset, or currency and a European call option. The 
solution to this model’s expected return yields the option premium.
The basic theoretical model for the pricing of a European call option is:
C = e-rfT SN(d1) - Ee-rdT N(d2)
where
C = premium on a European call
e = continuous time discounting
S = spot exchange rate ($/foreign currency)
E = exercise or strike rate
T = time to expiration
N = cumulative normal distribution function
rf = foreign interest rate
rd = domestic interest rate
s = standard deviation of asset price (volatility)
ln = natural logarithm
The two density functions, d1 and d2, are defined:
d1 =
ln¢ S
E ≤ + ¢rd - rf + s2
2 ≤T
s2T
and
d2 = d1 - s2T
This expression can be rearranged so the premium on a European call option is written in 
terms of the forward rate:
C = e-rfT FN(d1) - e-rdT EN(d2)
where the spot rate and foreign interest rate have been replaced with the forward rate, F, and 
both the first and second terms are discounted over continuous time, e. If we now slightly 
simplify, we find that the option premium is the present value of the difference between two 
cumulative normal density functions.
C = [FN(d1) - EN(d2)]e-rdT
M07_EITE5960_16_GE_C07.indd 243 02/05/23 5:17 PM244 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
The two density functions are now defined:
d1 =
ln¢
F
E ≤ + ¢
s2
2 ≤T
s2T
and
d2 = d1 - s2T
Solving each of these equations for d1 and d2 allows the determination of the European call 
option premium. The premium for a European put option, P, is similarly derived:
P = [F(N(d1) - 1) - E(N(d2) - 1)] e-rdT
The European Call Option: Numerical Example
The actual calculation of the option premium is not as complex as it appears from the pre￾ceding set of equations. Assuming the following basic exchange rate and interest rate values, 
computation of the option premium is relatively straightforward.
Spot rate = $1.7000/£
90-day forward = $1.7000/£
Strike rate = $1.7000/£
U.S. dollar interest rate = 8.00 % (per annum)
Pound sterling interest rate = 8.00 % (per annum)
Time (days) = 90
Std. dev. (volatility) = 10.00 %
e (infinite discounting) = 2.71828
The value of the two density functions is first derived:
d1 =
lna
F
E b + a
s2
2 b T
s2T =
lna
1.7000
1.700 b + a
.10002
2 b 90

.1000
A
90
365
= .025
and
d2 = 0.025 - 0.1000
A
90
365 = -.025
The values of d1 and d2 are then found in a cumulative normal probability table,
N(d1) = N(.025) = 0.51; N(d2) = N(-.025) = .49
The premium of the European call with a “forward-at-the-money” strike rate is
C = [(1.7000)(.51) - (1.7000)(.49)] 2.71828-.08(90>365) = $0.033/£
This is the call option premium, price, value, or cost.

8.1 Explain interest rate foundations, including interest rate calculations and reference 
rates
8.2 Define the cost of debt for both governments (sovereign borrowers) and corporate 
borrowers
8.3 Analyze interest rate risk and examine a variety of methods for its management
8.4 Explore the use of interest rate futures and forward rate agreements in managing 
interest rate risk
8.5 Examine the use of interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risks of multina￾tional firms
All firms—domestic or multinational, small or large, leveraged or unleveraged—are sensitive 
to changes in interest rates. Although a variety of interest rate risks exist, this book focuses on 
the financial management of the nonfinancial (nonbank) multinational firm. The internation￾al financial marketplace in which these multinational firms operate is largely defined by both 
interest rates and exchange rates, and those theoretical linkages were established in Chapter 6 
on parity relationships. We now turn to the interest rate structures and the challenges facing 
firms operating in a multi-currency interest rate world.
The first section of this chapter on interest rate foundations details the various reference 
rates and floating rates that all multinationals deal in. The chapter then turns to the govern￾ment—corporate interest rate relationships that define the costs and availability of capital. 
The third section focuses on the various forms of interest rate risk confronting multinational 
firms. The fourth and fifth sections detail how a variety of financial derivatives, including 
interest rate swaps, can be used to manage these interest rate risks. The mini-case at the end 
of the chapter, Replacing LIBOR, explores the complex multinational effort to move the 
world’s financial structure to a new benchmark interest rate, replacing LIBOR, which has 
been used for the past 50 years.
Confidence in markets and institutions, it’s a lot like oxygen. When you have it, you don’t 
even think about it. Indispensable. You can go years without thinking about it. When it’s 
gone for five minutes, it’s the only thing you think about. The confidence has been sucked 
out of the credit markets and institutions.

8.1 Interest Rate Foundations
We begin our discussion of interest rates with some definitions, namely, interest rate calcula￾tion practices internationally and the use of reference interest rates.
Interest Rate Calculations
International interest rate calculations are the first major concern of any firm borrowing or 
investing globally. Interest rate calculations differ by the number of days used in the period’s 
calculation and in the definition of how many days there are in a year (for financial purposes). 
Exhibit 8.1 illustrates three examples of how different calculation methodologies result in dif￾ferent 1 month payments of interest on a $10 million loan, 5.500% per annum interest, for an 
exact period of 28 days.
The first example shown, International Practice, uses a 28-day month in a 360-day finan￾cial year. The result is an interest payment of $42,777.78:
0.055 * $10,000,000 * 128>3602 = $42,777.78
If, however, the interest rate calculation had utilized the Swiss Practice (Eurobond) of a stan￾dard 30-day calculation, the interest cost for the same one-month period would have been 
$45,833.33, a substantial $3,055.56 higher. Clearly, calculation methods matter.
The Reference Rate: LIBOR
A reference rate—for example, U.S. dollar LIBOR—is the rate of interest used in a standard￾ized quotation, loan agreement, or financial derivative valuation. Most reference rates used 
are widely quoted interbank rates, the rate of interest for lending between major financial 
institutions on an overnight, daily, or multiple day basis. LIBOR, or ICE LIBOR as it is some￾times referred to today, is the London Interbank Offered Rate, the most widely used and 
quoted benchmark rate. A second source of reference rates is government borrowing rates. 
The U.S. Treasury bill, note, and bond rate is one such common reference rate.
LIBOR is administered by the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) and is calculated 
for five different currencies: U.S. dollar (USD), euro (EUR), British pound sterling (GBP), 
Japanese yen (JPY), and the Swiss franc (CHF). It is quoted for seven different maturities: 
overnight; one week; and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months. LIBOR was for decades calculated and 
published by the British Bankers Association. These different maturities terms are one of the 
most important characteristics of LIBOR, as they offer the ability of a borrower and lender 
to enter into a loan agreement for a specific maturity and have a market-based rate for that 
EXHIBIT 8.1 International Interest Rate Calculations
International interest rate calculations differ by the number of days used in the period’s calculation and their definition of 
how many days there are in a year (for financial purposes). The following example highlights how the different methods 
result in different one-month payments of interest on a $10 million loan, 5.500% per annum interest, for an exact period 
of 28 days.
$10 million @ 5.500% per annum
Practice Day Count in Period Days/Year Days Used Interest Payment
International Exact number of days 360 28 $42,777.78
British Exact number of days 365 28 $42,191.78
Swiss (Eurobond) Assumed 30 days/month 360 30 $45,833.33

coming period known to both parties. This forward-looking feature is fundamental to bor￾rowers particularly.
As detailed in the mini-case at the end of this chapter, LIBOR is now being replaced 
by a variety of different reference rates by country. As is common globally in interest rate 
quotations, all ICE LIBOR rates are quoted on an annualized basis. For example, using the 
practices described in Exhibit 8.1, an overnight British pound sterling interest rate quote of 
2.00000% would indicate that a bank would expect to pay 2% divided by 365 on the princi￾pal of the loan.
The interbank interest rate market is not, however, confined to London. There are a 
total of 35 different LIBOR rates quoted globally each business day. The most commonly 
utilized rate is the three-month U.S. dollar rate. It is the most common reference rate for 
business loans of all kinds and many different forms of financial derivatives. Most major 
regional financial centers construct their own interbank offered rates for local loan agree￾ment purposes. These rates include PIBOR (Paris Interbank Offered Rate), MIBOR 
(Madrid Interbank Offered Rate), and SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate), to 
name but a few.
Exhibit 8.2 shows 3-month USD LIBOR over the past 30 years. It has obviously 
moved over large ranges, from over 10% in the late 1980s to near zero percent in the 
post-2008 financial crisis years. The single most dramatic interest rate characteristic is how 
LIBOR has dropped leading up to and into major recessions. This is key in understanding 
corporate loan needs and practices. As economic conditions slow and prospects for new 
investments decline, the demand for debt of all forms declines, as do interest rates. At the 
same time, central banks—in this case, the U.S. Federal Reserve—typically undertake ex￾pansionary monetary policy to try to lower interest rates even further and hopefully kick￾start new borrowing and investment. The most extreme examples of this is the Fed’s use of 
quantitative easing (QE), the pumping of liquidity into the financial system, following the

2008–2010 financial crisis. A similar massive injection of money into the economy is seen 
with the onset of the global pandemic in 2020.
But, as we noted in Chapter 6 on international parity conditions, interest rates are cur￾rency specific. Exhibit 8.3 makes that very apparent as it presents three-month LIBOR 
rates for the five world currency markets for which LIBOR is officially calculated—the U.S. 
dollar, euro, Swiss franc, British pound, and Japanese yen. The true volatility of short-term 
interest rates is clear here, in that in just the past 15 years these major loan rate founda￾tions have bounced from near 7.00% to near or—in some cases recently—below zero percent. 
Note again the slight “bump” associated with the global pandemic. Just as a number of these 
LIBOR rates were just starting to rise in late 2019 and early 2020, when the global pandemic 
sent the global economy into a shutdown, central banks started pumping money into the 
economies in a variety of ways. LIBOR rates, as a result, moved downward once again.
A final note on short-term interest rates in recent history: Although near-zero short-term 
interest rates have remained near-zero or even negative over more than a decade, histori￾cally, this is unheard of. Money is not meant to be free according to economics and finance, 
and these continuing low rates have to come to an end sooner or later. But given that market 
analysts, government dignitaries, and learned academics have been repeating this phrase now 
for more than a decade, it seems it will be “later” rather than sooner!
8.2 The Cost of Debt
Individual borrowers, whether they are governments or companies, possess their own individ￾ual credit quality—the market’s assessment of their ability to repay debt in a timely manner. 
These credit assessments result in the assignments of designations of differences in the cost and 
access to capital. This means individual organizational borrowers not only pay different rates to 
borrow (different interest rates) but have access to different amounts of capital or debt.

The cost of debt for any individual borrower will therefore possess two components, 
the base rate (a reference rate like LIBOR or a risk-free rate of interest like U.S. Treasury 
bills), kUS
$
, plus a credit risk premium reflecting the assessed credit quality of the indi￾vidual borrower, RPM$
Rating. For an individual borrower in the United States, acquiring 
dollar-denominated debt, the cost of debt (kDebt$
) would be:
kDebt
$ = kUS
$ + RPM$
Rating
The credit risk premium represents the credit risk of the individual borrower. In credit 
markets, this assignment is typically based on the borrower’s credit rating as designated by 
one of the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch. An overview 
of those credit ratings is presented in Exhibit 8.4. Although each agency utilizes different 
methodologies, they all consider a standard set of common characteristics including the in￾dustry in which the firm operates, the diversity and sustainability of its revenues, its current 
level of indebtedness, and its past, present, and prospective operating performance.

Credit Ratings and Cost of Funds
Although there is obviously a wide spectrum of credit ratings, the designation of investment 
grade versus speculative grade is extremely important. An investment grade borrower (Baa3, 
BBB-, and above) is considered a high-quality borrower that is expected to be able to repay a 
new debt obligation in a timely manner regardless of market events or business performance. 
A speculative grade borrower (Ba1 or BB+ and below) is believed to be a riskier borrower 
and, depending on the nature of a market downturn or business shock, may have difficulty 
servicing new debt.
Exhibit 8.4 also illustrates how the cost of debt changes with credit quality. At this time, 
the U.S. Treasury was paying 1.74% for funds for a 5-year period. The average single-A bor￾rower (“A”) paid 2.35% per annum for funds for a 5-year period at this time, 0.61% above 
the U.S. Treasury. Note that the costs of credit quality—credit spreads—are quite minor for 
borrowers of investment grade. Speculative grade borrowers, however, are charged a hefty 
premium in the market. For example, the average single-B borrower paid a full 5.27% above 
U.S. Treasuries.
The cost of debt for corporate borrowers also changes over maturity. Exhibit 8.5 graphi￾cally presents the full range of maturities of the same credit ratings and costs presented in the 
previous exhibit. Once again, it is the U.S. Treasury yield curve, the U.S. government’s cost of 
funds over varying maturities that establishes the base rates at which all corporate credits are 
then priced. Note that AAA-rated firms (currently there are only two remaining—Microsoft 
and Johnson & Johnson—ExxonMobil having lost its AAA-rating in the spring of 2016) pay 
very little more than the U.S. government to borrow money. The bulk of the larger S&P500 
firms operating in the U.S. today are either A, BBB, or BB in rating. The U.S. Treasury yield 
curve is quite flat but still upward sloping, indicating that short-term funds are cheaper than

long-term funds. (We have limited the graphic to 10 years in maturity. U.S. Treasuries actually 
extend out to 30 years.)
Every country with an established financial system will have some version of this same 
spread structure—government yield curve plus corporate borrowing. In addition to the U.S., 
the largest such systems in the world would be those of the European Union, the United 
Kingdom, and Japan. As we will see later in this chapter, however, different countries—and 
currencies—possess very different costs of funds.
Credit Risk and Repricing Risk
For a corporate borrower, it is especially important to distinguish between credit risk and 
repricing risk. Credit risk, sometimes termed roll-over risk, is the possibility that a borrower’s 
creditworthiness at the time of renewing a credit—its credit rating—is reclassified by the 
lender. This can result in changing fees, changing interest rates, altered credit line commit￾ments, or even denial. Repricing risk is the risk of changes in interest rates charged (earned) 
at the time a financial contract’s rate is reset. A borrower that is renewing a credit will face 
current market conditions on the base rate used for financing, a true floating rate.
In the past some countries have struggled so mightily with inflation, and how it de￾stroys the ability of all entities, people and companies alike, to borrow, that they have cre￾ated new forms of indexed interest rates. Global Finance in Practice 8.1 describes one such 
well-established system.
Sovereign Debt
Debt issued by governments—sovereign debt—is historically considered debt of the high￾est quality, higher than that of nongovernment borrowers within that same country. This 
quality preference stems from the ability of a government to tax its people and, if need be, 
print more money. Although the former may cause significant economic harm in the form 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 8.1 
the country. The capital remained concentrated in the hands 
of people and groups that were close to power in these 
countries.
The crisis started with Thailand’s decision (to reduce 
its foreign debt) to float its currency and remove the fixed 
peg resulting into rapid devaluation of its currency within 
days. As the Thai Baht was pegged with other currencies, 
their value also declined and to maintain the pegged value 
of these currencies the governments needed to borrow sig￾nificant amount of USD and other reserve currencies. This 
borrowing spree further devalued the currencies to the extent 
that the global lenders panicked and stopped lending to the 
central banks of these countries causing a credit crunch. This 
resulted into an institutional version of bank run on these cen￾tral banks from foreign depositors.
As a result, the exchange rate for IDR per GBP went 
from around 5,400 IDR to more than 24,300 IDR within three 
months. The measures introduced by the local governments 
and the IMF stabilized the value, but the prices and the value 
of currency remained stuck as we see them today.
You Will Be a Millionaire in Indonesia: The Impact 
of South Asian Currency Crisis
For residents of Europe, traveling to Indonesia presents a 
unique situation in terms of organizing local bank notes. If you 
convert approximately GBP52 or USD 62, you will get more 
than a million Indonesian rupiah (IDR) in exchange! As the 
price of goods and services are always in thousands of IDR 
(A Big Mac meal will cost you 51,579 IDR in Jakarta), you will 
always be carrying several hundred thousand worth of IDR as 
a tourist.
The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis explain the reason 
behind everything priced in thousands in local currency in 
Indonesia. Just before 1997, many Southeast Asian coun￾tries witnessed a period of high interest rates and high GDP 
growth. This attracted significant amount of foreign capital 
from private fund managers and sovereign funds. However, 
due to a variety of structural reasons like crony capitalism and 
poor corporate governance systems, this inflow of capital 
was not directed towards the most productive investments in 
M08_EITE5960_16_GE_C08.indd 251 02/05/23 5:01 PM252 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
of unemployment and the latter may result in significant financial harm in the form of infla￾tion, they are both tools available to the sovereign. The government, therefore, has the abil￾ity to service its own debt—one way or another—when that debt is denominated in its own 
currency.
A government, typically through its central banking authority, also conducts its own 
monetary policy. That policy will, in combination with economic conditions of growth and 
inflation, determine the entire structure of its own interest rates of all maturities. Depending 
on the depth and breadth of domestic financial markets—the sophistication of the domestic 
financial marketplace—those maturities may be very short or very long. A large industrial 
country like the U.S. or Japan may issue its own debt instruments (borrow money) at maturi￾ties as long as 30 years or longer. These debt instruments would typically be denominated 
in the issuer’s own currency and openly saleable on global markets to both domestic and 
foreign investors. The U.S., for example, has financed a large portion of its government debt 
by selling U.S. Treasuries to a variety of investors all over the world—private individuals, or￾ganizations, and governments.
Domestic interest rates are in domestic currency, and as discussed in Chapter 6 on in￾ternational parity conditions, interest rates are themselves currency specific. A direct com￾parison of interest rates across countries is only truly economically possible if the rates have 
all been converted to one currency (as is the case when looking at various opportunities for 
uncovered interest arbitrage), when different countries raise debt in a common currency (say 
the U.S. dollar), or if exchange rates never change.
Sovereign Spreads
Many developing country governments raise debt capital in the international markets, and 
they do so typically in one of the world’s most widely traded currencies like the U.S. dollar, 
European euro, or Japanese yen. Exhibit 8.6 provides a comparison of what several sovereign 
borrowers have had to pay for U.S. dollar funds over and above that of the U.S. Treasury—the 
U.S. dollar sovereign spread—over the past two decades.
What Exhibit 8.6 details is the global financial market’s assessment of sovereign credit 
risk —the ability of these sovereign borrowers to repay foreign currency denominated debt—
U.S. dollar debt in this case—in a timely manner. For example, the cost of Brazilian sovereign 
dollar debt (kBrazil$
), the cost for the government of Brazil to raise U.S. dollar debt on global 
markets, can be decomposed into two basic components: (1) the U.S. government’s own cost 
of dollar debt (kUS
$
) and (2) the Brazilian sovereign spread, a risk premium for a dollar bor￾rower who must earn U.S. dollars in order to service the debt (RPM$
Brazil):
kBrazil
$ = U.S.TreasuryDollarrate + Braziliansovereignspread = kUS
$ + RPM$
Brazil
As illustrated in Exhibit 8.6, for some of these country borrowers like Russia or Pakistan, 
the sovereign spread has periodically been extremely high. This serves as a clear indicator 
by the international financial markets that these sovereign borrowers—at these specific 
points in time—were believed to present significant risks as borrowers. For example, in early 
2015 Russia was downgraded to “speculative” status by the major credit rating agencies. This 
downgrade, a result of economic deterioration associated with sanctions by Western nations 
(related to Ukraine) and the fall in the price of oil (that provides more than 50% of Russian 
government revenues), reduced Russia’s access to capital. The mini-case in Chapter 13, how￾ever, describes a very different situation, when the issuer (Saudi Aramco, the most profitable 
company in the world) was considered such a low risk that it borrowed at rates approaching 
those of the U.S. Treasury!

European Sovereign Debt
The European Union is a complex organism compared to the customary structure of fiscal 
and monetary policy institutions described in the typical Economics 101 course. With the 
adoption of a common currency, the EU members participating in the euro gave up exclusive 
rights over the ability to print money (to service debt). Because it is a common currency, no 
one EU member has the right to simply print more euros—that is the policy realm of the 
European Central Bank (ECB). The members of the EU do have relative freedom to set 
their own fiscal policies—government spending, taxation, and the creation of government 
surpluses or deficits. This structure sets up one of the more unique sovereign debt situations 
seen globally.
Each EU sovereign borrower has the ability to raise debt in the international market￾place but do so in its home currency, the euro. The financial markets, however, have the ability 
to differentiate borrowers by assessed credit quality. This has led to very different costs of 
sovereign debt across the EU. A number of member countries of the European Union—par￾ticularly Greece, Portugal, and Ireland—have themselves struggled with recessionary econo￾mies and rising costs of debt in recent years.
Following the onslaught of the global financial crisis in 2008–2009, a number of EU 
member countries suffered significant economic crises. Part of their economic woes included 
growing fears over their ability to service their outstanding sovereign debt. As seen in Exhibit 
8.7, these market fears and concerns drove the cost of their funds on the international market￾place very high, showing a dramatic separation of sovereign debt costs. The widest separation 
is that between the highest-quality EU borrower, Germany, and the lowest-quality borrower 
for the period in question, Greece.

8.3 Interest Rate Risk
The single largest interest rate risk of the nonfinancial firm is debt service. The debt structure 
of the MNE will possess differing maturities of debt, different interest rate structures (such as 
fixed versus floating-rate), and different currencies of denomination. Therefore the manage￾ment of this debt portfolio can be quite complex and, in all cases, important. The second most 
prevalent source of interest rate risk for the MNE lies in its holdings of interest-sensitive 
securities. Unlike debt, which is recorded on the right-hand side of the firm’s balance sheet 
(a liability), the marketable securities portfolio of the firm appears on the left-hand side 
(an asset). Marketable securities represent potential earnings or interest inflows to the firm. 
Ever-increasing competitive pressures have pushed financial managers to tighten their man￾agement of interest rates on both the left and right sides of the firm’s balance sheet.
Debt Structures and Strategies
Consider the three different bank loan structures being considered by U.S. medical equip￾ment manufacturer MedStat. Each is intended to provide $1 million in financing for a 3-year 
period.
Strategy 1: Borrow $1 million for three years at a fixed rate of interest.
Strategy 2: Borrow $1 million for three years at a floating rate, LIBOR + 2% (LIBOR to 
be reset annually).
Strategy 3: Borrow $1 million for one year at a fixed rate and then renew the credit annually.

Although the lowest cost of funds is always a major selection criterion, it is not the only 
one. If MedStat chooses Strategy 1, it assures itself of the funds for the full three years at a 
known interest rate. It has maximized the predictability of cash flows for the debt obligation. 
What it has sacrificed to some degree is the ability to enjoy a lower interest rate in the event 
that interest rates fall over the period. Of course, it has also eliminated the risk that it would 
face higher rates if interest rates rose over the period.
Strategy 2 offers what Strategy 1 did not—flexibility. It too assures MedStat of full fund￾ing for the three-year period. This eliminates credit risk. Repricing risk is, however, alive and 
well in Strategy 2. If LIBOR changes dramatically by the second or third year, the LIBOR 
rate change is passed through completely to the borrower. The spread, however, remains fixed 
(reflecting the credit standing that has been locked in for the full three years). Flexibility 
comes at a cost—in this case, the risk that interest rates may go up as well as down.
Strategy 3 offers MedStat more flexibility and more risk. First, the firm is borrowing at 
the shorter end of the yield curve. If the yield curve is positively sloped, as is commonly the 
case in major industrial markets, the base interest rate should be lower. But the short end 
of the yield curve is also the more volatile. It responds to short-term events in a much more 
pronounced fashion than do longer-term rates. The strategy also exposes the firm to the pos￾sibility that its credit rating may be different when it is time for credit renewal, for better or 
worse. Noting that credit ratings in general attempt to establish whether a firm can meet its 
debt-service obligations under worsening economic conditions, firms that are highly credit￾worthy (investment-rated grades) may view Strategy 3 as a more relevant alternative than do 
firms of lower quality (speculative grades).
Although the previous example gives only a partial picture of the complexity of funding 
decisions and choices within the firm, it demonstrates the many ways credit risks and repric￾ing risks are inextricably intertwined. The expression “interest rate exposure” is a complex 
concept, and the proper measurement of exposure prior to the management of this risk is 
critical. We now proceed to describe the interest rate risk of the most common form of corpo￾rate debt, floating-rate loans.
An Illustration: MedStat’s Floating-Rate Loans
Floating-rate loans are a widely used source of debt for firms worldwide. They are also the 
source of the single largest and most frequently observed corporate interest rate expo￾sure. Exhibit 8.8 shows the costs and cash flows for a 3-year floating rate loan taken out by 
MedStat. The loan of US$10 million will be serviced with annual interest payments and total 
principal repayment at the end of the 3-year period.
The loan is priced at U.S. dollar LIBOR + 1.250% (note that the cost of money—inter￾est—is often referred to as price). The LIBOR base will be reset each year on an agreed-upon 
date (say two days prior to payment). Whereas the LIBOR component is truly floating, the 
spread of 1.250% is actually a fixed component of the interest payment, which is known with 
certainty for the life of the loan.
MedStat will not know the actual interest cost of the loan until the loan has been com￾pletely repaid. Caitlin Kelly, the CFO of MedStat, may forecast what LIBOR will be for the 
life of the loan, but she will not know with certainty until all payments have been completed. 
This uncertainty is not only an interest rate risk, but it is also an actual cash flow risk associ￾ated with the interest payment. While a fixed interest rate loan also has interest rate risk in 
the form of opportunity cost, the exact size of the cash flows promised by the borrower in 
repayment is known.
Exhibit 8.8 illustrates the cash flows and all-in costs (AIC) of the floating-rate loan. The 
AIC is found by calculating the internal rate of return (IRR) of the total cash flow stream, 
including proceeds up-front and repayment over time. This baseline analysis assumes that 
M08_EITE5960_16_GE_C08.indd 255 02/05/23 5:01 PM256 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
LIBOR remains at 5.000% for the life of the loan. Including the up-front loan origination 
fees of 1.50%, the AIC to MedStat is 6.820% (or 6.250% without fees). But this is only hy￾pothetical, as MedStat and its bank both assume that over time LIBOR will change. Which 
direction it will change and by how much per year is, of course, unknown. The loan’s LIBOR 
component, but not the credit spread, creates a debt-service cash flow risk over time for 
MedStat.
If MedStat Corporation decided, after it had taken out the loan, that it wished to manage 
the interest rate risk associated with the loan agreement, it would have a number of manage￾ment alternatives:
■ Refinancing. MedStat could go back to its lender and restructure and refinance the entire 
agreement. This is not always possible, and it is often expensive.
■ Interest rate futures. Interest rate futures have gained substantial acceptance in the cor￾porate sector. MedStat could lock in the future interest rate payments by taking an inter￾est rate futures position.
■ Forward rate agreements (FRAs). MedStat could lock in the future interest rate pay￾ments with forward rate agreements (FRAs), interest rate contracts similar to foreign 
exchange forward contracts.
■ Interest rate swaps. MedStat could enter into an additional agreement with a bank or 
swap dealer in which it exchanged—swapped—future cash flows in such a way that the 
interest rate payments on the floating-rate loan would become fixed.
The following two sections detail the latter three interest rate derivative management so￾lutions described previously—how they work and how they might be utilized by a corporate 
borrower.
EXHIBIT 8.8 MedStat’s Floating-Rate Loan
Note: The effective cost of funds (before-tax) for MedStat—the all-in-cost (AIC)—is calculated by finding the internal rate of return (IRR) of the total 
cash flows associated with the loan and its repayment. The AIC of the original loan agreement, without fees, would be 6.250%.

8.4 Interest Rate Futures and Forward Rate Agreements
Like foreign currency, there are many interest rate-based financial derivatives. We first de￾scribe interest rate futures and forward rate agreements (FRAs) before moving on to the inter￾est rate swap.
Interest Rate Futures
Unlike foreign currency futures, interest rate futures are relatively widely used by financial 
managers and treasurers of nonfinancial companies. Their popularity stems from the high li￾quidity of the interest rate futures markets, their simplicity in use, and the rather standardized 
interest rate exposures most firms possess. The two most widely used futures contracts are the 
eurodollar futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the U.S. Treasury 
Bond Futures of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). To illustrate the use of futures for man￾aging interest rate risks, we will focus on the 3-month eurodollar futures contracts. Exhibit 8.9 
presents eurodollar futures for two years. (They actually trade 10 years into the future.)
The yield of a futures contract is calculated from the settlement price, which is the closing 
price for that trading day. For example, a financial manager examining the eurodollar quotes 
in Exhibit 8.9 for a March 2011 contract would see that the settlement price on the previous 
day was 94.76, an annual yield of 5.24%:
Yield = 1100.00 - 94.762 = 5.24%
Since each contract is for a 3-month period (one quarter) and has a notional principal of 
$1 million, each basis point is actually worth $2,500(0.01 * $1,000,000 * 90>360).
If a financial manager were interested in hedging—managing the risk of—a floating-rate 
interest payment due in March 2011, she would need to sell a future—to take a short position. 
This strategy is referred to as a short position because the manager is selling something she does 
not own (as in shorting common stock or short currency futures described in Chapter 7). If in￾terest rates rise by March, as the manager predicts, the futures price will fall and she will be able 
to close the position at a profit. This profit will roughly offset the losses associated with rising 
interest payments on her debt. If the manager is wrong, however, and interest rates actually fall 
by the maturity date, causing the futures price to rise, she will suffer a loss that will wipe out the 
“savings” derived from making a lower floating-rate interest payment than she expected. So by 
selling the March 2011 futures contract, the manager locks in an interest rate of 5.24%.

Obviously, interest rate futures positions could be, and are on a regular basis, purchased 
purely for speculative purposes. Although that is not the focus of the managerial context 
here, the example shows how any speculator with a directional view on interest rates could 
take positions with expectations of profit. As mentioned previously, the most common inter￾est rate exposure of the nonfinancial firm is interest payable on debt. Such exposure is not, 
however, the only interest rate risk. As more and more firms manage their entire balance 
sheet, the interest earnings from the left-hand side are under increasing scrutiny. If finan￾cial managers are expected to earn higher interest on interest-bearing securities (marketable 
securities), they may well find a second use for the interest rate futures market—to lock in 
future interest earnings. Exhibit 8.10 provides an overview of these two basic interest rate 
exposures and management strategies.
Forward Rate Agreements
A forward rate agreement (FRA) is an interbank-traded contract to buy or sell interest rate 
payments on a notional principal. These contracts are settled in cash. The buyer of an FRA 
obtains the right to lock in an interest rate for a desired term that begins at a future date. The 
contract specifies that the seller of the FRA will pay the buyer the increased interest expense 
on a nominal sum (the notional principal) of money if interest rates rise above the agreed 
rate, but the buyer will pay the seller the differential interest expense if interest rates fall 
below the agreed rate. Maturities available are typically 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
Like foreign currency forward contracts, FRAs are useful on individual exposures. They 
are contractual commitments by the firm that allow little flexibility to take advantage of 
favorable movements, such as when LIBOR is falling as described in the previous section. 
Firms also use FRAs if they plan to invest in securities at future dates but worry that interest 
rates might fall prior to the investment date. Because of the limited maturities and currencies 
available, however, FRAs are not widely used outside the largest industrial economies and 
currencies.
8.5 Interest Rate Swaps
Swaps are contractual agreements to exchange or swap a series of cash flows. These cash 
flows are most commonly the interest payments associated with debt service—the payments 
associated with fixed-rate and floating-rate debt obligations.
Swap Structures
There are two main types of swaps, interest rate and currency, and a single swap may combine 
elements of both types. For example, a swap agreement may swap fixed-rate dollar payments 
for floating-rate euro payments.

■ Interest rate swap. If the agreement is for one party to swap its fixed interest rate payment 
for the floating interest rate payments of another, it is termed an interest rate swap, some￾times referred to as a plain-vanilla swap.
■ Currency swap. If the agreement is to swap currencies of debt service—for example, 
Swiss franc interest payments in exchange for U.S. dollar interest payments—it is termed 
a currency swap or cross-currency swap.
In all cases, the swap serves to alter the firm’s cash flow obligations, as in changing 
floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments associated with an existing debt obligation. 
The swap itself is not a source of capital, but rather an alteration of the cash flows associated 
with payment.
The two parties may have various motivations for entering into the agreement. For exam￾ple, a very common position is as follows: A corporate borrower of good credit standing has 
existing floating-rate debt service payments. The borrower, after reviewing current market 
conditions and forming expectations about the future, may conclude that interest rates are 
about to rise. In order to protect the firm against rising debt-service payments, the company’s 
treasury may enter into a swap agreement to pay fixed/receive floating. This means the firm 
will now make fixed interest rate payments and receive from the swap counterparty floating 
interest rate payments. The floating-rate payments that the firm receives are used to service 
the debt obligation of the firm, so the firm on a net basis is now making fixed interest rate 
payments. Using derivatives, it has synthetically changed floating-rate debt into fixed-rate 
debt. It has done so without going through the costs and intricacies of refinancing existing 
debt obligations.
The cash flows of an interest rate swap are interest rates applied to a set amount of 
capital (notional principal). For this reason, these cash flows are also referred to as coupon 
swaps. Firms entering into interest rate swaps set the notional principal so that the cash flows 
resulting from the interest rate swap cover their interest rate management needs. Interest 
rate swaps are contractual commitments between a firm and a swap dealer and are com￾pletely independent of the interest rate exposure of the firm. That is, the firm may enter into 
a swap for any reason it sees fit and then swap a notional principal that is less than, equal to, 
or even greater than the total position being managed. For example, a firm with a variety of 
floating-rate loans on its books may, if it wishes, enter into interest rate swaps for only 70% 
of the existing principal. The size of the swap notional principal is a choice purely in the 
hands of corporate management and is not confined to the size of existing floating-rate loan 
obligations.
It should also be noted that the interest rate swap market is filling a gap in market ef￾ficiency. If all firms had free and equal access to capital markets, regardless of interest rate 
structure or currency of denomination, the swap market would most likely not exist. The fact 
that the swap market not only exists but also flourishes and provides benefits to all parties is 
in some ways the proverbial “free lunch.”
Illustrative Case: MedStat’s Floating-Rate Debt
MedStat is a U.S.-based firm with a $40 million floating-rate bank loan. The company is fin￾ishing the first two years of the loan agreement (it is the end of the third quarter of 2017), 
with three years remaining. The loan is priced at the 3-month LIBOR rate plus a 1.250% 
credit risk premium. The recent movements of LIBOR and MedStat’s floating-rate debt are 
depicted in Exhibit 8.11.
As shown in Exhibit 8.11, LIBOR has started moving upward in the past year. MedStat’s 
management is now worried that interest rates will continue to rise and that the company’s 
M08_EITE5960_16_GE_C08.indd 259 02/05/23 5:01 PM260 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
interest costs will rise with them. Management is considering entering into a pay-fixed 
receive-floating plain-vanilla interest rate swap. MedStat’s New York bank has quoted a 
fixed-rate payment of 3.850% in exchange for LIBOR. The notional principal of the swap, 
the base amount for calculating the interest cash flows, is something MedStat must choose. 
In this case, they decide to enter into a notional principal equal to the full amount of the 
floating-rate loan—$40 million. The interest rates of the proposed swap, when combined with 
MedStat’s current floating-rate debt obligations, would appear as follows:
Debt/Swap Component Floating Fixed
Floating-rate loan (LIBOR) (1.250%)
Swap (pay fixed, receive floating) LIBOR (3.850%)
Floating-rate loan after swap — (5.100%)
MedStat will now receive a floating-rate payment from the bank of LIBOR, which is 
then used to pay the LIBOR component on its floating-rate loan. What then remains is for 
MedStat to pay the fixed-rate spread on the loan—the 1.250% spread—plus the fixed-rate 
payment of the swap of 3.850%, for a total of 5.100%. The fixed rate quoted to MedStat is 
based on a corporate issuer of AA quality for a 3-year maturity, which is the length of time 
the swap needs in order to cover the floating-rate loan. The fixed rates available in the swap 
market will therefore always reflect the current government and corporate yield curves in the 
appropriate currency market, in this case the U.S. dollar.
Note that the swap agreement swaps only the floating-rate component, LIBOR, and does 
not swap or deal with the credit spread in any way. This is because of two principles: (1) the

MedStat has $40 million in floating rate loans, paying a floating interest rate of LIBOR 1 1.250%. Over the past year, LIBOR has been trending
upward. Company management is now considering swapping its floating-rate debt for fixed-rate payments—a pay-fixed receive-floating
plain-vanilla interest rate swap. If it swaps now, it can lock in a fixed rate payment of 3.850% (pay fixed component) in exchange for LIBOR
(received floating component).

swap market does not wish to deal with the credit risk of any individual borrower, only the 
core fixed and floating-rate foundations; and (2) the fixed-rate credit spread is indeed a 
fixed-rate component, and it does not change over the life of the loan. The swap market is 
intended only for the true floating-rate component, and therefore the final combined fixed￾rate obligation of MedStat after the swap is purely a fixed-rate payment at a combined rate 
of 5.100%. The plain-vanilla interest rate swap is a very cheap and effective method of alter￾ing the cash flows associated with debt. It allows a firm to alter the interest rate associated 
with any debt obligation without suffering the costs (time and money) of repayment and 
refinancing.
Whether MedStat’s swap to pay fixed (entering an interest rate swap agreement to pay 
a fixed rate of interest in exchange for receiving a floating rate of interest) proves to be the 
right strategy depends on what happens in the coming series of quarters. If LIBOR increases 
over the coming two or three quarters but only marginally, then the decision to swap may 
not turn out to be the best one. If, however, LIBOR rises significantly, the swap may save 
MedStat sizable interest expenses.
It is also important to consider what might have happened if MedStat had decided not 
to execute the swap. Exhibit 8.12 provides one potential future: LIBOR continues to rise and 
MedStat’s interest cost management options worsen. Both floating rates and fixed rates avail￾able are now higher. This is because as short-term interest rates rise, so do the fixed rates in 
the marketplace. In this case, as 3-month LIBOR rose from 1.885% to 2.250%, the fixed rate 
offered in the plain-vanilla swap rose from 3.850% to 4.200%. The company could still enter 
into a swap, but all interest rates, fixed and floating, are now higher.

If MedStat had decided not to execute the swap, and LIBOR continued to rise, MedStat would be left with increasingly poor choices.
If MedStat decided that it would now enter into the pay fixed receive floating swap, the fixed rate available to the company is
now higher, 4.200%, rather than the previous quote of 3.850%. This is because as short-term floating rates of interest like LIBOR rise,
so do the fixed rates of interest in the marketplace.

Plain-Vanilla Swap Strategies
The use of the plain-vanilla swap market by firms can be divided into two basic categories, 
debt structure and debt cost.
Debt Structure. All companies will pursue a target debt structure that combines maturity, 
currency of composition, and fixed/floating pricing. The fixed/floating objective is one of the 
most difficult for many companies to determine with any confidence, and they often simply 
try to replicate industry averages.
Companies that have very high credit quality and therefore advantaged access to the 
fixed-rate debt markets, A or AA companies like Walmart or IBM, often raise large amounts 
of debt in long maturities at fixed rates. They then use the plain-vanilla swap market to alter 
selective amounts of their fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt to achieve their desired ob￾jective. Swaps allow them to alter the fixed/floating composition quickly and easily without 
the origination and registration fees of the direct debt markets.
Companies of lower credit quality, sometimes those of less than investment grade, often 
find the fixed-rate debt market not open to them. For them, getting fixed-rate debt may be 
either impossible or too costly. Such firms will generally raise debt at floating rates and then 
periodically evaluate whether the plain-vanilla swap market offers any attractive alternatives to 
swap from paying-floating to paying-fixed. The plain-vanilla swap market is also frequently used 
by firms to adjust their fixed/floating debt structure. This was the case of MedStat described 
previously. Expectations of rising interest rates led the company to use plain-vanilla swaps to 
swap out of floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. During the 2009–2014 period, with 
interest rates often hitting historical lows in U.S. dollar and European euro debt markets, many 
firms used the swap market frequently to swap increasingly into fixed-rate obligations.
Debt Cost. All firms are always interested in opportunities to lower the cost of their debt. 
The plain-vanilla swap market is one highly accessible and low-cost method of doing so.
Assume that MedStat regularly explored opportunities in the debt and swap markets. 
In our previous example, in the third quarter of 2017, MedStat discovered that it could swap 
$40 million of its existing debt for an all-in fixed-rate cost (the swap fixed-rate plus the re￾maining credit spread) of 5.100%. At that same time, banks may have offered the company 
three-year fixed-rate loans of the same size at a fixed rate of 5.20% or 5.30%. MedStat could, 
if it wished, swap floating-rate debt for fixed-rate debt to lock in cheaper fixed-rate debt.
These lower costs, achieved through the plain-vanilla swap market, may simply reflect 
short-term market imperfections and inefficiencies or the comparative advantage some bor￾rowers have in selected markets via selective financial service providers. The savings may be 
large—30, 40, or even 50 basis points on occasion—or quite small. It is up to the management 
of the firm and its corporate treasury to determine how much savings is needed to make it 
worth spending the time and effort needed to execute the swaps. Banks promote the swap 
market and will regularly market deals to corporate treasuries. A corporate treasurer once 
remarked to the author that unless the proposed structure or deal can save the firm 15 or 20 
basis points, at a minimum, he did not want to hear from the banker.
Cross-Currency Swaps
Since all swap rates are derived from the yield curve in each major currency, the 
fixed-to-floating interest rate swap existing in each currency allows firms to swap across cur￾rencies. Exhibit 8.13 lists typical swap rates for the euro, the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, and 
the Swiss franc. These swap rates are based on the government security yields in each of the 
individual currency markets, plus a credit spread applicable to investment grade borrowers in 
the respective markets.
M08_EITE5960_16_GE_C08.indd 262 02/05/23 5:01 PMCHAPTER 8 Interest Rate Risk and Swaps 263
Note that the swap rates in Exhibit 8.13 are not rated or categorized by credit ratings. 
This is because the swap market itself does not carry the credit risk associated with individual 
borrowers. Individual borrowers with obligations priced at LIBOR plus a spread will keep 
the spread. The fixed spread, a credit risk premium, is still borne by the firm itself. For exam￾ple, lower-rated firms may pay spreads of 3% or 4% over LIBOR, while some of the world’s 
largest and most financially sound MNEs may raise capital at LIBOR rates. The swap market 
does not differentiate the rate by the participant; all swap at fixed rates versus LIBOR.
The usual motivation for a currency swap is to replace cash flows scheduled in an unde￾sired currency with flows in a desired currency. The desired currency is probably the currency 
in which the firm’s future operating revenues will be generated. Firms often raise capital in 
currencies in which they do not possess significant revenues or other natural cash flows. The 
reason they do so is cost; specific firms may find capital costs in specific currencies attrac￾tively priced to them under special conditions. Having raised the capital, however, the firm 
may wish to swap its repayment into a different currency—one in which it will have future 
operating revenues (cash inflows).
The utility of the currency swap market to an MNE is significant. An MNE wishing to swap a 
10-year fixed 2.29% U.S. dollar cash flow stream could swap to 0.83% fixed in euros, 1.87% fixed 
in British pounds, 0.55% fixed in Swiss francs, or 0.55% fixed in Japanese yen. In addition to swap￾ping to fixed rates, it could also swap from fixed dollars to floating LIBOR rates in the various 
currencies. Any of these swaps could be arranged with the swap dealer/bank in a matter of just 
hours and at a fraction of the transaction costs and fees of actually borrowing in those currencies.

Illustrative Case: MedStat Uses a Cross-Currency Swap
We return to MedStat Corporation to demonstrate how to use a cross-currency swap. After 
raising $10 million in floating-rate financing and subsequently swapping into fixed-rate pay￾ments, MedStat decides that it would prefer to make its debt service payments in British 
pounds. MedStat had recently signed a sales contract with a British buyer that will be paying 
pounds to MedStat over the next 3-year period. This would be a natural inflow of British 
pounds for the coming three years, and MedStat wishes to match the currency of denomina￾tion of the cash flows through a cross-currency swap.
MedStat enters into a 3-year pay-British-pounds and receive-U.S.-dollars cross-currency 
swap. Both interest rates are fixed. MedStat will pay 1.15% (the ask rate) fixed British pound 
interest and receive 1.26% (the bid rate) fixed U.S. dollars (swap rates are taken from Exhibit 
8.13). As seen in Exhibit 8.14, the 3-year currency swap MedStat selected is different from the 
plain-vanilla interest rate swap in two important ways:
1. The spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the agreement establishes the notional 
principal in the target currency. The target currency is the currency MedStat is swap￾ping into, in this case the British pound. The $10,000,000 notional principal converts to a 
£6,410,256 notional principal. This is the principal used to establish the actual cash flows 
MedStat is committing to making.
2. The notional principal itself is part of the swap agreement. In plain-vanilla interest rate 
swaps, both interest payment cash flows are based on the same notional principal (in the 
same currency). Hence, there is no need to include the principal in the agreement. In a 
cross-currency swap, however, because the notional principals are denominated in two 
different currencies and the exchange rate between those two currencies may change 
over time, the notional principals are part of the swap agreement.
At the time of the swap’s inception, both positions have the same net present value.

receiving three payments in U.S. dollars. The payments are set. Accounting practices will re￾quire MedStat to regularly track and value its position—mark-to-market the swap—on the 
basis of current exchange rates and interest rates. If after the swap is initiated, the British 
pound appreciates versus the dollar, and MedStat is paying pounds, MedStat will record a 
loss on the swap for accounting purposes. (Similarly, the swap dealer’s side of the transac￾tion will record a gain.) At the same time, if interest rates in British pound markets rise, and 
MedStat’s swap commits it to a fixed rate of 1.15%, then a gain will result from the interest 
component of the swap’s value. In short, gains and losses on the swap, at least for account￾ing purposes, will persist throughout the swap’s life. The currency swaps described here are 
non-amortizing swaps, where the swap parties pay the entire principal at maturity, rather than 
over the life of the swap agreement, standard practice in the market.
Illustrative Case: MedStat Unwinds a Currency Swap
As with all original loan agreements, it may happen that at some future date the partners to a 
swap may wish to terminate the agreement before it matures. If, for example, after one year, 
MedStat Corporation’s British sales contract is terminated, MedStat will no longer need the 
swap as part of its hedging program. MedStat could terminate or unwind the swap with the 
swap dealer.
Unwinding a currency swap requires the discounting of the remaining cash flows under 
the swap agreement at current interest rates, then converting the target currency (British 
pounds in this case) back to the home currency of the firm (U.S. dollars for MedStat). If 
MedStat has two payments remaining on the swap agreement (an interest-only payment, and 
a principal and interest payment), and the 2-year fixed rate of interest for pounds is now 
1.50%, the present value of MedStat’s commitment in British pounds is:
PV1£2 = £73,717.95
11.0152 1 +
£6,483,974.36
11.0152 2 = £6,366,374.41
At the same time, the present value of the remaining cash flows on the dollar side of the swap 
is determined using the current 2-year fixed dollar interest rate, which is now 1.40%:
PV1 $ 2 = $126,000.00
11.0142 1 + $10,126,000.00
11.0142 2 = $9,972,577.21
MedStat’s currency swap, if unwound at this time, would yield a present value of net 
inflows (what it receives under the swap) of $9,972,577.21 and a present value of outflows 
(what it pays under the swap) of £6,366,374.41. If the exchange rate is now $1.65=£1.00, the 
net settlement of this currency swap will be:
Settlement = $9,972,577.21 - (£6,366,374.41 * $1.65) = - $531,940.57
MedStat must therefore make a cash payment to the swap dealer of $531,941 to unwind 
the swap. MedStat’s cash loss on this swap would result largely from the appreciation of the 
British pound against the U.S. dollar (the interest rates both rose marginally). Since MedStat 
had promised to pay in the currency that is now stronger in value—the pound—unwinding 
the swap will be costly. (If for example the exchange rate was still $1.56=£1.00, MedStat would 
have closed out the position with a gain of $41,033.) It is important to remember, however, 
that the swap was entered into as a hedge of MedStat’s long British pound position; it was not 
meant as a financial investment. But unwinding swaps can sometimes be much more com￾plex, like that of the swaps Procter & Gamble purchased from Bankers Trust, as described in 
Global Finance in Practice 8.2.

Counterparty Risk
Counterparty risk is the potential exposure any individual firm bears that the second party 
to any financial contract will be unable to fulfill its obligations under the contract’s specifi￾cations. Concern over counterparty risk periodically rises, usually associated with large and 
well-publicized derivative and swap defaults. The rapid growth in the currency and interest 
rate financial derivatives markets has actually been accompanied by a surprisingly low de￾fault rate to date, particularly in a global market that is unregulated in principle.
Counterparty risk has long been one of the major factors that favor the use of 
exchange-traded rather than over-the-counter derivatives. Most exchanges, like the 
Philadelphia Stock Exchange for currency options or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for 
Eurodollar futures, are themselves the counterparty to all transactions. This allows all firms a 
high degree of confidence in being able to buy or sell exchange-traded products quickly and 
with little concern over the credit quality of the exchange itself. Financial exchanges typi￾cally require a small fee from all traders on the exchanges to pay for insurance funds created 
expressly for the purpose of protecting all parties. Over-the-counter products, however, are

a semi-annual basis. P&G in turn would pay Bankers Trust 
commercial paper (CP) less 75 basis points for the first six 
months of the swap agreement, and thereafter, CP less 75 
basis points plus an additional spread (the “Spread”) which 
could never be less than zero, and which would be fixed at 
the end of the first six months. The Spread was calculated 
as follows:
Spread =
98.5 *
(5@year@Treasury
@Note Yield)
5.78%
- 30@year 6.25%
Treasury price
100
The Spread formula was actually a speculative play on the 
entire U.S. Treasury yield curve. If 5-year Treasuries remained 
fairly constant at their current level, the spread stayed near 
zero. However, because the Spread could increase geomet￾rically with interest rate increases, rather than the customary 
arithmetic increases of standard interest rate movements, the 
instrument was considered highly leveraged.
The Spread formula was also extraordinarily sensitive to 
rising 5-year Treasury note yields. Each 1% increase in 5-year 
yields would increase P&G’s payments under the leveraged 
swap by more than 17% of notional principal per year (CP 
+ 1,700 basis points), while each 1% decline in long bond 
prices would cost P&G 1% of notional principal. P&G had 
interpreted the Spread as 0.17%, not 17%. A number of ana￾lysts noted the rather peculiar way in which the Spread was 
expressed. The division by 100 gave a number less than one, 
which appeared as a fraction of 1%. In the end, what P&G 
and other firms observing P&G’s travails learned was that 
one should not agree to something they do not understand. 
Or as it is oft-quoted in Latin, caveat emptor—buyer beware.
Procter & Gamble and Bankers Trust
In 1994, Procter & Gamble (P&G) announced that it had in￾curred a $157 million pre-tax loss from closing out an inter￾est rate swap transaction it had entered into with Bankers 
Trust. The loss would result in a $102 million after-tax charge 
to third-quarter earnings. According to P&G, this swap was a 
highly complex and speculative transaction that was counter 
to P&G’s policy of conservatively managing their debt portfolio.
Derivatives like these are dangerous and we were badly 
burned. We won’t let this happen again. We are seriously 
considering our legal options relative to Bankers Trust, 
the financial institution that designed these swaps and 
brought them to us.
—Edwin L. Artzt, chairman of Procter & Gamble, as quoted 
in “Procter & Gamble’s Tale of Derivative Woe,” by Lawrence 
Malkin, The New York Times, April 14, 1994.
P&G wanted to continue to make floating-rate payments 
in return for receiving fixed-rate payments in order to maintain 
a balance between its fixed and floating-rate debt obligations. 
The swap would essentially transform existing fixed-rate debt 
obligations held by P&G into floating-rate obligations at a quite 
attractive rate. According to Bankers Trust, P&G was confident 
that interest rates would not rise significantly over the next year 
(although interest rates were at that time at historically low lev￾els). P&G wanted to achieve the same favorable floating-rate 
as under another swap which had just matured, CP minus 40 
basis points. But it did not want to incur significant risk.
Bankers Trust sold P&G a “5/30 Year Linked Swap,” a 
5-year swap structure with a notional principal of $200 mil￾lion. Bankers Trust would pay P&G a fixed rate of 5.30% on 
M08_EITE5960_16_GE_C08.indd 266 02/05/23 5:01 PMCHAPTER 8 Interest Rate Risk and Swaps 267
direct credit exposures to the firm because the contract is generally between the buying firm 
and the selling financial institution. Most financial derivatives in today’s world financial cen￾ters are sold or brokered only by the largest and soundest financial institutions. This structure 
does not mean, however, that firms can enter continuing agreements with these institutions 
without some degree of real financial risk and concern.
A firm entering into a currency or interest rate swap agreement retains ultimate respon￾sibility for the timely servicing of its own debt obligations. Although a swap agreement may 
constitute a contract to exchange U.S. dollar payments for euro payments, the firm that actu￾ally holds the dollar debt is still legally responsible for payment. The original debt remains on 
the borrower’s books. In the event that a counterparty to a swap does not make the payment 
as agreed, the firm legally holding the debt is still responsible for debt service. In the event of 
such a failure, the payments would cease by the right of offset, and the losses associated with 
the failed swap would be mitigated.
The real exposure of an interest or currency swap is not the total notional principal, but 
the mark-to-market values of differentials in interest or currency interest payments (replace￾ment cost) since the inception of the swap agreement. The real exposure is similar to the 
change in swap value discovered by unwinding a swap described previously. This amount is 
typically only 2% to 3% of the notional principal.
Summary Points
■ The single largest interest rate risk of the nonfinancial 
firm is debt service. The debt structure of the MNE 
will possess differing maturities of debt, different in￾terest rate structures (such as fixed versus floating 
rate), and different currencies of denomination.
■ The increasing volatility of world interest rates, com￾bined with the increasing use of short-term and 
variable-rate debt by firms worldwide, has led many 
firms to actively manage their interest rate risks.
■ The primary sources of interest rate risk to a multi￾national nonfinancial firm are short-term borrowing, 
short-term investing, and long-term debt service.
■ The techniques and instruments used in interest rate 
risk management in many ways resemble those used 
in currency risk management. The primary instru￾ments used for interest rate risk management include 
refinancing, forward rate agreements (FRAs), interest 
rate futures, and interest rate swaps.
■ The interest rate and currency swap markets allow 
firms that have limited access to specific currencies 
and interest rate structures to gain access at relatively 
low costs. This in turn allows these firms to manage 
their currency and interest rate risks more effectively.
■ A cross-currency interest rate swap allows a firm to 
alter both the currency of denomination of cash flows 
in debt service and the fixed-to-floating or floating-to￾fixed interest rate structure.
MINI-CASE 
Replacing LIBOR1
Transitioning from LIBOR is like having to figure out 
how to re-lay the tracks of the global financial system.
—Timothy Bowler, president of ICE Benchmark 
Administration, “This Man Wants to Mend, Not End, 
Libor,” by Daniel Kruger, Wall Street Journal, May 5, 2019.
It has often been described as “the world’s most impor￾tant number.” No single interest rate is more fundamental 
to the operation of the global financial markets than the 
London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. But it was 
now being replaced. LIBOR has been the world’s most 
widely used reference interest rate for more than 50 years. 
It is used daily in hundreds of thousands of different

financial contracts, derivatives, mortgages, bank loans, 
and insurance agreements. But LIBOR had failed in a 
number of ways beginning with the multitude of crises 
in the United States and United Kingdom as far back as 
2007, and the world’s financial leaders were now moving 
to replace it. That replacement process, LIBOR cessation, 
was actively underway. But replacing a global benchmark 
used in more than $350 trillion of financial contracts 
worldwide, essentially a global institution, was a massive 
undertaking.
LIBOR Defined
LIBOR is administered by the ICE Benchmark 
Administration (IBA) and is calculated for five different 
currencies: U.S. dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British pound 
sterling (GBP), Japanese yen (JPY), and the Swiss franc 
(CHF). It is quoted for seven different maturities: over￾night; one week; and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months, a daily matrix 
of 35 different interest rate references. Prior to the IBA tak￾ing over its publication, LIBOR was for decades calculated 
and published by the British Bankers Association (BBA).
Each day, a panel of 16 major multinational banks 
was requested to submit estimated borrowing rates in the 
unsecured interbank market, which were then collected, 
massaged, and published in three steps. In the first step, 
the banks on the LIBOR panels would submit their es￾timated borrowing rates by 11:10 a.m. London time. The 
submissions were made directly to Thomson Reuters, 
which executed the process on behalf of the BBA. In the 
second step, Thomson Reuters discarded the lowest 25% 
and highest 25% of interest rates submitted. It then cal￾culated an average rate by maturity and currency using 
the remaining 50% of borrowing rate quotes. In the third 
and final step, the BBA published the day’s LIBOR rates 
20 minutes later, by 11:30 a.m. London time. The same 
process was used to publish LIBOR for the five currencies 
and seven maturities. The 3-month and 6-month maturities 
are the most significant maturities due to their widespread 
use in various loan and derivative agreements, with the 
dollar and the euro being the most widely used currencies.
At its core LIBOR represents interbank borrowing. 
Each bank surveyed daily is asked to base its LIBOR sub￾missions on the following question:
At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do 
so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers in 
a reasonable market size just prior to 11 a.m. London 
time?
This would require the reporting of the lowest perceived 
rate at which a bank could actually receive funds for a spe￾cific maturity and currency. The phrase reasonable market 
size is intentionally vague, as typical trading transaction sizes 
change frequently and the value of those transactions would 
vary dramatically depending upon currency.
In theory this produced a daily sample of the cost of 
funds for the largest and most active commercial banks in 
the world. The values submitted by the banks surveyed by 
the IBA were not, however, actual transactions. They were 
in fact nothing other than “indications” or perceptions 
and were limited to the relatively small sample of banks. 
And they could not be termed risk-free; the rates submit￾ted represented the cost of funds for commercial enter￾prises, enterprises that still possessed a core—but likely 
extremely small—credit risk component. The market had 
in fact for decades considered a core set of banks to be 
inherently risk-free and “on the run,” so much so that their 
rates were quoted as the base benchmarks reflecting little 
credit risk premium.
LIBOR’s Decline
The idea that my word is my LIBOR is dead.
—Mervyn King, Bank of England Governor, Press confer￾ence on Central Bank’s Financial Stability Report, 2012.
LIBOR and the interbank market had always been prone 
to freeze up during times of financial crisis. During the fi￾nancial crisis of September 2008, for example, for weeks 
the market showed so little trading that banks no longer 
saw it as a source of overnight funds—the exact role it 
was supposed to play. If trading occurred at all, it was at 
extremely low volumes. Low volumes in turn resulted in 
relatively high volatility as fewer quotes and traders pro￾vided poor price discovery.
The funding structure of financial institutions had 
been changing dramatically over an extended period. 
Commercial banking institutions, depository institutions, 
were required to hold more reserves, in turn requiring 
less overnight lending and borrowing activity, to support 
their balance sheets. And as many of the distinctions and 
regulations separating commercial banking and invest￾ment banking disappeared, investment banking firms 
played a greater role in markets. One such role change 
was that investment banks and similar financial institu￾tions looked to the repo market for short-term funds. 
A  repo or repurchase agreement combines the simul￾taneous sale and repurchase of a security (typically a 
government security such as a Treasury bill) as a form 
of short-term borrowing. The seller sells the underlying 
security to a buyer and by agreement buys that security 
back shortly afterward, usually the following day, at a 
slightly higher price. This difference in price is the cost of 
short-term funds.
Beginning in 2012 another series of troubling events 
eroded much of the faith in LIBOR. A series of scandals 
uncovered manipulation in rate quotes to the BBA. On a 
number of occasions, it was discovered that banks—includ￾ing Barclays, one of the oldest and most esteemed banking 
houses in the world—were submitting interbank quotes to 
M08_EITE5960_16_GE_C08.indd 268 02/05/23 5:01 PMCHAPTER 8 Interest Rate Risk and Swaps 269
the BBA working cooperatively with other banks to push 
LIBOR rates quoted in one direction or another, some￾times by 30 or 40 basis points, for both personal and in￾stitutional gain. Quotes did not realistically represent the 
cost of funds for the banks in the market.
LIBOR also suffered from certain behavioral risks, 
particularly during crisis. One example can be found in the 
concerns of banks in the interbank market in September 
2008 when the credit crisis was in full bloom. When a bank 
reported that it was being charged a higher rate by other 
banks, it was effectively self-reporting the market’s assess￾ment that it was increasingly risky. In the words of one 
analyst, it was akin “to hanging a sign around one’s neck 
that I am carrying a contagious disease.”
Following the discovery of the fraudulent activ￾ity, LIBOR was placed under the direct regulation of 
the British government by the Financial Securities 
Act 2012, and its administration was transferred to the 
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). One of the primary 
changes to LIBOR required by its new administrators was 
that it reflect actual transactions. But this proved challeng￾ing as fewer and fewer financial institutions were using 
interbank borrowing on a daily basis. The financial sector 
regulators across countries jointly began to search for a 
new alternative.
LIBOR Cessation
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) and Financial 
Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) have both pub￾licly recognized for some time that the secular decline 
in wholesale unsecured term money market funding 
by banks poses serious structural risks for unse￾cured benchmarks such as ICE LIBOR (LIBOR). 
Although significant progress has been made in 
strengthening the governance and processes underly￾ing LIBOR, the scarcity of underlying transactions 
poses a continuing risk of a permanent cessation of its 
production.
Because U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR is used in such a 
large volume and broad range of financial products 
and contracts, the risks surrounding it pose a poten￾tial threat to the safety and soundness of individual fi￾nancial institutions and to financial stability. Without 
advanced preparation, a sudden cessation of such a 
heavily used reference rate would cause considerable 
disruptions to and uncertainties around the large gross 
flows of USD LIBOR–related payments and receipts 
between many firms. It would also impair the normal 
functioning of a variety of markets, including business 
and consumer lending.
—“Second Report,” The Alternative Reference 
Rates Committee, March 2018.
LIBOR replacement efforts have been led by the 
Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body 
of the G20 countries responsible for the oversight of the 
global financial system.2
 In turn, each of the individual 
countries has led its own domestic development. In the 
United Kingdom, efforts have been led by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA), a nongovernmental authority, 
working alongside the Prudential Regulation Authority 
and the Financial Policy Committee.
In the U.S. the LIBOR transition is being led by the 
U.S. Federal Reserve and its Alternative Reference Rates 
Committee (ARRC). ARRC is a group of private-industry 
participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and 
the New York Fed to help ensure a successful transition to 
a new, hopefully more dependable rate. Other transitions 
have largely been the responsibility of central banks—the 
Bank of Japan, the Swiss Central Bank, and the European 
Central Bank (ECB).
LIBOR cessation faces challenges financially and 
legally. For example, the United Kingdom, in an effort to 
avoid endless litigation involving the changeover, gave its 
regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the 
legal right to maintain a “LIBOR-like” reference rate, a 
“zombie-type” rate, that could be used for the most dif￾ficult of legacy contracts. Although the original time line 
announced was to end the publication of all LIBOR rates 
by December 31, 2021, this schedule was revised to allow 
more time.
On March 5, 2021, the final time line for LIBOR 
phaseout was announced.3

or asset as collateral as part of the transaction), they are 
all considered risk-free rates by national authorities as 
they reflect actual transactions conducted in the regu￾lated national bank markets. Each of the risk-free rate 
choices of the five nations is different in its calculation 
and structure, a major departure from the traditional 
LIBOR system.
SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is a broad mea￾sure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized 
by Treasury securities. The SOFR includes all trades in the 
Broad General Collateral Rate plus bilateral Treasury re￾purchase agreement (repo) transactions cleared through 
the Delivery-versus-Payment (DVP) service offered by 
the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC).
SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average) is a risk-free 
rate for British pounds sterling. SONIA is based on actual 
transactions and reflects the average of the interest rates 
that banks pay to borrow sterling overnight from other 
financial institutions and other institutional investors. Fi￾nancial businesses and institutions use SONIA in a variety 
of ways including the interest paid on sterling floating-rate 
notes.
TONA or TONAR (Tokyo Overnight Average Rate) is an 
unsecured interbank overnight interest rate and reference 
rate for Japanese yen. Since 2016, the Bank of Japan has 
recommended TONAR as the preferred risk-free refer￾ence rate.
€STR (Euro Short-Term Rate) is a reference rate for the 
currency euro. The €STR is calculated by the European 
Central Bank and is based on the money market statistical 
reporting of the Eurosystem. The working group on euro 
risk-free rates has recommended €STR as a replacement 
for the EMMI Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) 
as the euro risk-free rate for all products and contracts.
SARON (Swiss Average Rate Overnight) represents the 
overnight interest rate of the secured funding market for 
the Swiss franc. It is based on transactions and quotes post￾ed in the Swiss repo market.
The advantages of moving to these benchmarks are 
substantial. SOFR is superior to LIBOR in a number of 
ways. SOFR is calculated on actual documented trans￾actions, whereas LIBOR is based on surveys of possible 
transactions. SOFR is based on secured transactions of 
government securities, truly risk-free. LIBOR is based on 
the unsecured borrowing costs of a firm possessing credit 
risk. (That credit risk for the majority of the banks sur￾veyed daily is exceedingly small but still positive.) SOFR 
is calculated from transactions in the single largest over￾night financial market reflecting the opinions of thou￾sands of different buyers and sellers, including all forms of 
financial institutions and investors. LIBOR is based only 
on the perceived borrowing and lending costs between 
select commercial banks, a weak measure of market activ￾ity. As illustrated by Exhibit B, SOFR and USD LIBOR 
(overnight) track extremely closely over time, with a few 
exceptional divergences.4
Yet there remain a number of major challenges. The 
three challenges of most immediate concern are fallback 
language, spreads, and the term challenge. The first is legal 
in nature, the second transitional behavior in character, 
and the third—well, the third is complicated.
Fallback Language. Fallback language refers to the legal 
practices and provisions in a financial contract that ap￾ply if the underlying reference rate (LIBOR) is discon￾tinued or unavailable. For example, when USD LIBOR 
4 Exhibit B shows SOFR spiking in mid-September 2019. SOFR rose from 2.43% on September 16 to 5.25% on September 17. The 
cause is believed to have been the simultaneous settlement of bank tax payments due on September 16 with more than $54 billion in 
settlement of U.S. Treasury debt.

ceases, contracts that contain fallback provisions will 
switch to a “fallback rate”—a rate to be used if the base 
rate is not available. Many contracts over time have 
used fallback language calling for the use of the “last 
quoted rate” in case of unavailability. That would ob￾viously prove an unattractive solution if contracts con￾tinued for months or even years after LIBOR stopped 
being quoted. Hence, national authorities have worked 
through legal channels in their own countries to “fix” 
this language and collectively to provide both advice and 
even samples of language to be used in financial con￾tracts moving forward.
Spread Adjustment. Spread adjustment is the concern on 
how to make the transition from LIBOR to the new ref￾erence rates fair and reasonable for both borrowers and 
lenders. For example, the USD replacement, SOFR, is his￾torically lower than USD LIBOR. ARRC has called for 
a one-year transition period as part of its recommended 
spread adjustments for consumer products. The ARRC 
specified that the starting point for the transition peri￾od would be based on a 2-week average of the relevant 
LIBOR-SOFR spread prior to the time of the benchmark 
replacement date.
Term Challenge. The replacement rates are largely over￾night rates and do not have the multitude (seven) terms 
LIBOR offers. These terms allowed interest rates in con￾tracts to be “forward-looking,” where contract participants 
would know the rate of interest for the term at the start of 
the time period of the contract. Many standard structures 
like floating-rate bank loans need a term measure, such as 
a loan priced on 3-month LIBOR. But there is no 3-month 
SOFR. ARRC has recommended that financial institu￾tions use an average rate calculation in new contracts, ei￾ther simple averaging or compound interest. For example, 
a business loan with interest rate resets every 3 months 
could use the average of the SOFR rate for that 3-month 
period. Critics of this replacement point out that although 
the math can provide a 90-day moving average, SOFR it￾self is only an overnight rate and does not implicitly con￾tain expectations for returns, both real and nominal, for 
any future period more than a day.
Associated with this averaging requirement is 
whether these will be in advance or in arrears. In arrears
means that the interest rate used in a contract would be 
the average for a period that has ended, historical and 
factual. But interest rate reference rates like LIBOR have

effectively been in advance markets, a forward-looking 
rate for the coming period of time based on both history 
and expectations. This is a particularly troublesome di￾mension for business loans. Borrowers are certainly used 
to knowing the interest rate for the coming debt-service 
period at the beginning of the period, not the end.
Exhibit C illustrates the differences between USD 
3-month LIBOR and SOFR since SOFR’s launch in 2018. 
SOFR itself is obviously more volatile than LIBOR. Even 
excluding the September 2019 one-day spike, SOFR is 
seen to vary on a daily basis much more than 3-month 
LIBOR. When a direct comparison of 3-month LIBOR is 
made with a 90-day moving average for SOFR, the rec￾ommended replacement for 3-month LIBOR, SOFR is 
seen to be considerably less volatile than LIBOR. This 
is not surprising; it is simply the result of moving average 
mathematics.
The extended time taken for LIBOR cessation is a 
function of its use. Exhibit D shows the latest estimates 
of how many assets by class are subject to USD LIBOR 
replacement. (These estimates have continued to be re￾vised upward as more and more assets have been found 
to have residual LIBOR languages and price-setting.) 
The good news for USD LIBOR is that the majority of 
instruments are relatively short-term in remaining life, 
the two years between March 2021 and June 2023 re￾tiring $150 trillion of the balance. This is not surprising 
given that LIBOR rates, regardless of term, are money 
market interest rates.
The bulk of assets in the USD LIBOR footprint are 
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. And of these, the ma￾jority are interest rate swaps. Given the longer maturities 
of swaps, some extending out to more than 20 years, it is 
understandable that they are not necessarily rapidly aging 
out of the exposed assets.
As the five major LIBOR-based economies move 
into LIBOR cessation, other countries and their city and 
regionally based interbank markets are also moving to new 
reference rates (e.g., Singapore from SIBOR, Paris from 
PIBOR, etc.). For them it may prove less of challenge as

the road is paved ahead of them. But critics and concerns 
remain about the replacements, particularly that new refer￾ence rates like SOFR are “too LIBIOR-like.” That is, they 
react to overnight events as SOFR did in September 2019. 
Such events, even in larger markets like the secured repo 
market, can be subject to lack of liquidity and its result, 
interest rate spikes. To others, these are just the expected 
downsides—the risks—of basing the cost of money on 
markets.
MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. Has LIBOR served successfully as a benchmark in￾terest rate?
2. Why is LIBOR being replaced? Do you believe its 
weaknesses or failures justify its replacement?
3. Will LIBOR’s replacements across countries really 
serve the same purposes as LIBOR has for the past 
50 years?
M08_EITE5960_16_GE_C08.indd 273 02/05/23 5:01 PM274 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Questions
8.1 Reference Rates. What is an interest “reference 
rate,” and how is it used to set rates for individual 
borrowers?
8.2 My Word Is My LIBOR. Why has LIBOR played 
such a central role in international business and fi￾nancial contracts? Why has this been questioned in 
recent debates over its value reported?
8.3 Credit Risk Premium. What is a credit risk 
premium?
8.4 Credit and Repricing Risk. From the point of 
view of a borrowing corporation, what are credit 
and repricing risks? Explain steps a company might

on the credit spread paid by corporate borrowers?
8.6 Investment Grade versus Speculative Grade.
What do the general categories of investment grade 
and speculative grade represent?
8.7 Sovereign Debt. What is sovereign debt? What

by a borrower?
8.10 Interest Rate Futures Strategies. What would be 
the preferred strategy for a borrower paying inter￾est on a future date if they expected interest rates to 
rise?
8.11 Forward Rate Agreement. How can a firm that 
has borrowed on a floating-rate basis use a forward 
rate agreement to reduce interest rate risk?
8.12 Plain Vanilla. What is a plain-vanilla interest rate 
swap? Are swaps a significant source of capital for 
multinational firms?
8.13 Swaps and Credit Quality. If interest rate swaps 
are not the cost of government borrowing, what 
credit quality do they represent?
8.14 LIBOR Flat. Why do fixed-for-floating interest 
rate swaps never swap the credit spread component 
on a floating-rate loan?
8.15 Debt Structure Swap Strategies. How can inter￾est rate swaps be used by a multinational firm to 
manage its debt structure?
8.16 Cost-Based Swap Strategies. How do corporate 
borrowers use interest rate or cross-currency swaps

want to swap those payments for interest payments 
due in U.S. dollars?
8.18 Value Swings in Cross-Currency Swaps. Why are 
there significantly larger swings in the value of a 
cross-currency swap than in a plain-vanilla interest 
rate swap?
8.19 Unwinding a Swap. How does a company cancel 
or unwind a swap?
8.20 Counterparty Risk. How does organized ex￾change trading in swaps remove any risk that the 
counterparty in a swap agreement will not complete 
the agreement?
Problems
8.1 Botany Bay Corporation. Botany Bay 
Corporation (BBC) of Australia seeks to borrow 
US$30,000,000 in the eurodollar market. Funding 
is needed for two years. Investigation leads to three 
possibilities. Compare the alternatives and make a 
recommendation.
1. Botany Bay could borrow the US$30,000,000 
for two years at a fixed 5% rate of interest.
2. Botany Bay could borrow the US$30,000,000 at 
LIBOR + 1.5%. LIBOR is currently 3.5%, and 
the rate would be reset every six months.
3. Botany Bay could borrow the US$30,000,000 
for one year only at 4.5%. At the end of the first 
year, Botany Bay Corporation would have to 
negotiate for a new 1-year loan.
8.2 Ingrid’s bet. Ingrid Niemman, a treasurer at a 
German company, believes interest rates are going 
to rise, so she wants to swap her future floating-rate 
interest payments for fixed rates. Presently, she is 
paying per annum on €5,000,000 of debt for the 
next two years, with payments due semiannually. 
EURIBOR is currently 4.00% per annum. Ingrid 
has just made an interest payment today, so the 
next payment is due six months from today. Ingrid 
finds that she can swap her current floating rate 
payments for fixed payments of 7.00% per annum. 
(The company’s weighted average cost of capital is 
12%, which Ingrid calculates to be 6% per 6-month 
period, compounded semiannually.)
a. If EURIBOR rises at the rate of 50 basis points 
per 6-month period, starting tomorrow, how 
M08_EITE5960_16_GE_C08.indd 274 02/05/23 5:01 PMCHAPTER 8 Interest Rate Risk and Swaps 275
much does Ingrid save or cost her company by 
making this swap?
b. If EURIBOR falls at the rate of 25 basis points 
per 6-month period, starting tomorrow, how 
much does Ingrid save or cost her company by 
making this swap?
8.3 T-Bill Yields. The interest yields on U.S. Treasury 
securities in early 2009 fell to very low levels as a re￾sult of the combined events surrounding the global 
financial crisis. Calculate the simple and annualized 
yields for the 3-month and 6-month Treasury bills 
auctioned on March 9, 2009, listed here.

8.4 TED Spread in the Global Financial Crisis. During 
financial crises, short-term interest rates will often 
change quickly (typically up) as indications that 
markets are under severe stress. The interest rates 
shown in the following table are for selected dates 
in September–October 2008. Different publications 
define the TED Spread in different ways. Here, we 
focus on the TED spread on U.K. interest rates. One 
measure is the differential between the 3-month 
British pound LIBOR interest rate and the 3-month 
U.K. Government bond yield.
a. Calculate the U.K. TED spread—the difference 
between the two market rates shown in the 
table—in September and October 2008.
b. On what date is the spread the narrowest? The 
widest?
c. When the spread widens dramatically, pre￾sumably demonstrating some sort of financial 
anxiety, which of the rates moves the most and 
why?
8.5 Stapleton’s Mortgage. Frank Stapleton pays 
£406,000 for a four-bedroom bungalow on the out￾skirts of Edinburgh, Scotland. He plans to make a 
20% down payment but is having trouble deciding 
whether he wants a 15-year fixed rate (3.650%) or a 
30-year fixed rate (4.565%) mortgage.
a. What is the monthly payment for both the 
15- and 30-year mortgages, assuming a fully 
amortizing loan of equal payments for the life 
of the mortgage? Use a spreadsheet calculator 
for the payments.
b. Assume that instead of making a 20% down 
payment, he makes a 15% down payment, finan￾ces the remainder at 5.785% fixed interest for 
15 years. What is his monthly payment?
c. Assume that the bungalow’s total value falls by 
30%. If Frank sells the house at the new market 
value, what will be his gain or loss on the home 
and mortgage, assuming all the mortgage principal 
remains? Use the same assumptions as in part (a).

8.6 DaimlerChrysler Debt. Chrysler LLC, the now 
privately held company sold off by DaimlerChrysler, 
must pay floating-rate interest three months from 
now. It wants to lock in these interest payments by 
buying an interest rate futures contract. Interest rate 
futures for three months from now settled at 93.07, 
for a yield of 6.93% per annum.
a. If the floating interest rate three months from 
now is 6.00%, what did Chrysler gain or lose?
b. If the floating interest rate three months from 
now is 8.00%, what did Chrysler gain or lose?
8.7 Sovereign Debt Negotiations. The Greek gov￾ernment is considering a €150 million loan for a 
four-year maturity. It will be an amortizing loan, 
meaning that the interest and principal payments 
in total, annually, to a constant amount over the 
maturity of the loan. There is, however, a debate 
over the appropriate interest rate. The Greek gov￾ernment believes the appropriate rate for its cur￾rent credit standing in the market today is 2.269%, 
but given the Greek government’s historical fiscal 
issues, several international banks with which it is 
negotiating are arguing that it is most likely 3.75%, 
and at the minimum 3.45%. What impact do these 
different interest rates have on the prospective 
annual payments?
8.8 Saharan Debt Negotiations. The country of 
Sahara is negotiating a new loan agreement with a 
consortium of international banks. Both sides have 
a tentative agreement on the principal—$220  mil￾lion. But there are still wide differences of opinion 
on the final interest rate and maturity. The banks 
would like a shorter loan, four years in length, while 
Sahara would prefer a long maturity of six years. 
The banks also believe the interest rate will need to 
be 12.250% per annum, but Sahara believes that is 
too high, arguing instead for 11.750%.
a. What would the annual amortizing loan pay￾ments be for the bank consortium’s proposal?
b. What would the annual amortizing loan pay￾ments be for Sahara’s loan preferences?
c. How much would annual payments drop on the 
bank consortium’s proposal if the same loan was 
stretched from four to six years?
8.9 Carlos and Wilmsberg Inc. Carlos and Wilmsberg 
Inc. is a rapidly growing import-export firm. It de￾cided to borrow €35,000,000 via a euro-euro float￾ing-rate loan for 4 years. Carlos and Wilmsberg Inc. 
must decide between two competing loan offers 
from two of its banks.
Caixa Brasilia Federal has offered the 4-year debt 
at euro-LIBOR + 2.5% with an up-front initiation 
fee of 2.0%. Brasilao Safra Banco, however, has 
offered euro-LIBOR + 3.0%, a higher spread, but 
no loan initiation fees up-front, for the same term 
and principal. Both banks reset the interest rate at 
the end of each year.
Euro-LIBOR is currently 0.75%. Carlos and Wilms￾berg Inc.’s economist forecasts that the LIBOR 
will rise by 0.65% points each year. Brasilao Safra 
Banco, however, officially forecast euro-LIBOR to 
begin trending upward at the rate of 0.45% points 
per year. Carlos and Wilmsberg Inc.’s cost of capital 
is 10%. Which loan proposal do you recommend for 
Carlos and Wilmsberg Inc.?
8.10 Delos Debt Renegotiations (A). Delos borrowed 
€80 million two years ago. The loan agreement, an 
amortizing loan, was for six years at 8.625% interest 
per annum. Delos has successfully completed two 
years of debt service but now wishes to renegotiate 
the terms of the loan with the lender to reduce its 
annual payments.
a. What were Delos’s annual principal and interest 
payments under the original loan agreement?
b. After two years debt service, how much of the 
principal is still outstanding?
c. If the loan was restructured to extend another 
two years, what would the annual payments—
principal and interest—be? Is this a significant 
reduction from the original agreement’s annual 
payments?

8.11 Delos Debt Renegotiations (B). Delos is con￾tinuing to renegotiate its prior loan agreement 
(€80  million for six years at 8.625% per annum) 
two years into the agreement. Delos is now facing 
serious tax revenue shortfalls and fears for its abil￾ity to service its debt obligations, so it has decided 
to get more aggressive and has gone back to its 
lenders with a request for a haircut, a reduction in 
the remaining loan amount. The banks have, so far, 
only agreed to restructure the loan agreement for 
another two years (a new loan of six years on the 
remaining principal balance) but at an interest rate 
a full 200 basis points higher, 10.625%.
a. If Delos accepts the current bank proposal of 
the remaining principal for six years (extending 
the loan an additional two years since two of the 
original six years have already passed) but at the 
new interest rate, what are its annual payments 
going to be? How much relief does this provide 
Delos on annual debt service?
b. Delos’s demands for a haircut are based on 
getting the new annual debt service payments 
down. If Delos does agree to the new loan terms, 
what size of haircut should it try to get from its 
lenders to get its payments down to €10 million 
per year?
8.12 MedStat Unwinds Its Cross-Currency Swap. In 
Exhibit 8.13, MedStat had entered into a 3-year 
cross-currency swap to pay British pounds at a fixed 
rate of interest and receive U.S. dollars at a fixed 
rate of interest. Using that same swap principal and 
contractual payments, calculate the cost of unwind￾ing the swap after one year has passed (with two 
years remaining) if the two-year fixed rate of inter￾est on British pounds is now 1.40%, the two-year 
fixed rate of interest on U.S. dollars is now 1.75%, 
and the current spot exchange rate is $1.55 = £1.00.
8.13 Firenza Motors (Italy). Firenza Motors of Italy 
recently took out a 4-year, €5  million loan on a 
floating rate basis. It is now worried, however, 
about rising interest costs. Although it had initially 
believed interest rates in the eurozone would be 
trending downward when taking out the loan, re￾cent economic indicators show growing inflationary 
pressures. Analysts are predicting that the European 
Central Bank will slow monetary growth, driving in￾terest rates up.
a. Firenza is now considering whether to seek 
some protection against a rise in euro-LIBOR 
and is considering a forward rate agreement 
(FRA) with an insurance company. According to 
the agreement, Firenza would pay to the insur￾ance company at the end of each year the differ￾ence between its initial interest cost at LIBOR 
+ 2.50% (6.50%) and any fall in interest cost 
due to a fall in LIBOR. Conversely, the insur￾ance company would pay to Firenza 70% of the 
difference between Firenza’s initial interest cost 
and any increase in interest costs caused by a 
rise in LIBOR. LIBOR is currently 4.00%.
b. Purchase of the floating rate agreement will cost 
€100,000, paid at the time of the initial loan. 
What are Firenza’s annual financing costs now if 
LIBOR rises and if LIBOR falls in increments 
of 0.5%? Firenza uses 12% as its weighted av￾erage cost of capital. Do you recommend that 
Firenza purchase the FRA?
8.14 Chipita and Plastika Kritis. Chipita and Plastika Kritis 
are two Greek companies both seek funding at the 
lowest possible cost. Chipita would prefer the flex￾ibility of floating rate borrowing, while Plastika Kritis 
wants the security of fixed rate borrowing. Chipita is 
the more creditworthy company. They face the follow￾ing rate structure. Chipita, with the better credit rating, 
has lower borrowing costs in both types of borrow￾ing. Chipita wants floating rate debt, so it could bor￾row at EURIBOR+1%. However, it could borrow 
fixed at 8% and swap for floating rate debt. Plastika 
Kritis wants fixed rate, so it could borrow fixed at 12%. 
However, it could borrow floating at EURIBOR+2% 
and swap for fixed rate debt. What should they do?
8.15 Aidan’s Cross-Currency Swap: Norwegian Krone 
for Euros. Aidan Corporation entered into a three￾year cross-currency interest rate swap to receive 
euros and pay Norwegian krone. Aidan, however, 
decided to unwind the swap after one year—thereby 
having two years left on the settlement costs of 
unwinding the swap after one year. Repeat the cal￾culations for unwinding swaps but assume that the 
following rates now apply.

8.16 LaFarge Swaps Euros for Pounds. LaFarge, a 
major French multinational, has signed a number 
of new international sales agreements which will re￾sult in it receiving payments in British pounds for at 
least four years. It has decided to use some of those 
cash inflows in pounds to service debt obligations. 
It wishes to enter into a four-year cross-currency 
swap to pay British pounds and receive euros. The 
notional principal of the swap is €12 million, and the 
current spot rate is £0.80 = €1.00.
a. Use the swap rates presented in Exhibit 8.12 to 
lay out the contractual cash flows for all four 
years for the cross-currency swap.
b. Unfortunately, one year later LaFarge’s business 
contracts have been canceled as a result of the 
Brexit vote. (The force majeure clauses allow 
contract cancellation.) The company decides to 
unwind its swap agreement with three years re￾maining on the swap. The spot exchange rate has 
changed and is now £0.8240 = €1.00. Euro inter￾est rates have risen dramatically; a two-year rate 
is 1.20%, and a three-year rate is 1.40%. British 
pound interest rates have risen on a small 
amount; the two-year rate is now 1.44%, and the 
three-year rate is now 1.48%.
8.17 UAE Small Business Loan. Mohammad tried 
one last time to explain the loan structure offered 
by the company’s Emirates bank. His boss just 
stared at him. Mo explained the detailed calculation 
of annual interest and principal payments, step-by￾step, as detailed by the bank.
The loan was for USD5 million, for five years, with 
an 8.200% interest rate.
Step 1: Calculate simple interest on loan principal 
for one year.
Step 2: Multiply that interest by the number of years 
of the loan. The bank labeled this “total interest.”
Step 3: Add the calculated total interest to the loan 
principal.
Step 4: Divide this calculated total by the number 
of years of the loan. This is the annual payment due 
on the loan (principal and interest).
Step 5: Using the calculated annual payment from 
step 4, structure the repayments to make all interest 
payments (totaling to total interest from step 2) up 
front. Once all interest has been paid, the remain￾ing cash flows associated with the annual payment 
are considered repayment of principal.
a. Complete the full calculation of the proposed 
loan, including all five years of principal, inter￾est, and total payments.
b. Estimate the all-in cost of this financing.
c. Recalculate all principal and interest payments 
for the same 5-year USD5 million dollar loan 
using traditional Western financial calcula￾tions. Include the all-in cost of funds in your 
calculations.
d. Compare the two loan structures. Why do you 
think the Emirates bank prefers this structure?

What determines the exchange rate between currencies? This question has proven to be 
very difficult to answer. Companies and agents need foreign currency for buying imports, 
and they may earn foreign currency by exporting. Investors need foreign currency to invest 
in interest-bearing instruments in foreign markets, such as fixed-income securities (bonds), 
shares in publicly traded companies, or other new types of hybrid instruments. Tourists, mi￾grant workers, speculators on currency movements—all of these economic agents buy and 
sell foreign currencies every day. This chapter offers a basic theoretical framework with which 
to organize these elements, forces, and principles.
Chapter 6 described the international parity conditions that integrate exchange rates 
with inflation and interest rates and provided a theoretical framework for both the global fi￾nancial markets and the management of international financial business. Chapter 3 provided 
a detailed analysis of how an individual country’s international economic activity, its balance 
of payments, can impact exchange rates. In the first section of this chapter, we build on those 
discussions of the schools of thought on exchange rate determination and look at another 
school of thought—the asset market approach. The chapter then turns to government inter￾vention in the foreign exchange market. In the third and final section, we discuss a number 
of approaches to foreign exchange forecasting in practice. The chapter concludes with the 
mini-case Is China a Currency Manipulator?, an exploration of the U.S. labeling China as an 
official currency manipulator under U.S. trade law in 2019.

9. 1 Exchange Rate Determination: The Theoretical Thread 
 There are basically three views of the exchange rate. The first takes the exchange rate as the 
relative price of monies (the monetary approach); the second, as the relative price of goods 
(the purchasing-power-parity approach); and the third, the relative price of bonds. 
 —Rudiger Dornbusch, “Exchange Rate Economics: Where Do We Stand?,” 
Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 1980, pp. 143 – 194 . 
 Professor Dornbusch’s three views of exchange rate theory are a good starting point but 
in some ways not sufficiently robust—in our humble opinion—to capture the multitude 
of theories and approaches. So, in the spirit of both tradition and completeness, we have 
amended Dornbusch’s three views with several additional streams of thought in the follow￾ing discussion. 
Exhibit 9. 1 provides an overview of the major schools of thought—theoretical deter￾minants—of exchange rates. The exhibit is organized both by the three major schools of 
 thought—parity conditions approach, balance of payments approach, monetary and asset 
market approaches —and by the individual drivers within each of those approaches. At 
first glance, the idea that there are three different theories may appear daunting, but it is 
important to remember that these are not competing theories, but rather complementary 
theories. 
 Without the depth and breadth of the various approaches combined, our ability to cap￾ture the complexity of the global market for currencies is lost. In addition to the three 
schools of thought described in Exhibit 9. 1 , note that two other institutional dimensions 
are considered—whether the country possesses the capital markets and banking systems 
needed to drive and discover value. Finally, note that most determinants of the spot ex￾change rate are also affected by changes in the spot rate. In other words, they are not only 
linked but also mutually determined.

M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 280 08/05/23 9:26 AMCHAPTER 9 Foreign Exchange Rate Determination and Intervention 281
Parity Conditions Approach
Under the skin of an international economist lies a deep-seated belief in some variant of the 
PPP theory of the exchange rate.
—“Flexible Exchange Rates in the Short Run,” Rudiger Dornbusch and Paul Krugman, 
Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 1976, No. 3 (1976), pp. 537–584.
There are a number of different theories that make up the parity conditions approach: the 
law of one price, absolute purchasing power parity, relative purchasing power parity, and in￾terest rate parity. All were discussed in detail in Chapter 6. The most widely accepted—the 
theory of purchasing power parity (PPP, both absolute and relative versions)—states that the 
long-run equilibrium exchange rate is determined by the ratio of domestic prices relative to 
foreign prices. PPP is both the oldest and most widely followed of the exchange rate theories 
described in Exhibit 9.1, and most theories of exchange rate determination have PPP ele￾ments embedded within their frameworks. The latter of the three theories, relative PPP is 
thought to be the most consistently relevant to possibly explaining what drives exchange rate 
values. In essence, it states that changes in relative prices between countries drive the change 
in exchange rates over time.
If, for example, the current spot exchange rate between the Japanese yen and U.S. dollar 
was ¥90.00 = $1.00 and Japanese and U.S. prices were to change at 2% and 1% over the com￾ing period, respectively, the spot exchange rate next period would be ¥90.89 = $1.00.
St + 1 = St *
1 + ∆ in Japanese prices
1 + ∆ in US prices = ¥90.00 *
1.02
1.01 = ¥90.89
Although PPP seems to possess a core element of common sense, it has proven to be 
quite poor at forecasting exchange rates (at least in the short to medium term). The problems 
are both theoretical and empirical. The theoretical problems lie primarily with its basic as￾sumption that the only thing that matters is relative price changes. Yet many currency sup￾ply and demand forces are driven by other forces, including investment incentives, economic 
growth, and political change. The empirical issues lie primarily in deciding which measures 
or indexes of prices to use across countries, in addition to providing a “predicted change in 
prices” with the chosen indexes.
Balance of Payments Approach
After PPP, the most frequently used theoretical approach to exchange rate determination 
is probably the balance of payments approach, involving the supply and demand for curren￾cies in the foreign exchange market. These exchange rate flows reflect current account and 
financial account transactions recorded in a nation’s balance of payments, as described in 
Chapter 3. The basic balance of payments approach argues that the equilibrium exchange 
rate is found when the net inflow (or outflow) of foreign exchange arising from current ac￾count activities matches the net outflow (or inflow) of foreign exchange arising from finan￾cial account activities.
The balance of payments approach continues to enjoy widespread appeal, as balance of 
payments transactions are among the most frequently captured and reported of international 
economic activity. Trade surpluses and deficits, current account growth in service activity, and 
recently, the growth and significance of international capital flows continue to fuel this theo￾retical fire.
M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 281 08/05/23 9:26 AM282 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Criticisms of the balance of payments approach arise from the theory’s emphasis on 
flows of currency and capital rather than on stocks of money or financial assets. Relative 
stocks of money or financial assets play no role in exchange rate determination in this theory, 
a weakness explored in the following discussion of monetary and asset market approaches. 
Curiously, while the balance of payments approach is largely dismissed by the academic com￾munity, market participants, including currency traders themselves, still rely on variations of 
this theory for much of their decision making.
Monetary Approach and Asset Market Approach
The third general approach to exchange rate determination, the monetary approach and asset 
market approach, is composed of two variations on the same theme—that the exchange rate 
is determined by the supply and demand for money (monetary approach) or the supply and 
demand for financial assets (asset market approach).
Monetary Approach. The monetary approach, in its simplest form, states that the exchange 
rate is determined by the supply and demand for national monetary stocks, as well as the 
expected future levels and rates of growth of monetary stocks. Other financial assets, such 
as bonds, are not considered relevant for exchange rate determination, as both domestic and 
foreign bonds are viewed as perfect substitutes. It is all about money stocks.
The monetary approach focuses on changes in the supply and demand for money as the 
primary determinant of inflation. Changes in relative inflation rates in turn are expected to 
alter exchange rates through a purchasing power parity effect. (Once again, PPP is embedded 
within another theory of exchange rate determination.) The monetary approach then assumes 
that prices are flexible in the short run as well as the long run, so that the transmission mecha￾nism of inflationary pressure is immediate in impact.
A weakness of monetary models of exchange rate determination is that real economic 
activity is relegated to a role in which it only influences exchange rates through changes in 
the demand for money. The monetary approach is also criticized for its omission of a number 
of factors that are generally agreed upon by area experts as important to exchange rate de￾termination, including (1) the failure of PPP to hold in the short to medium term; (2) money 
demand appears to be relatively unstable over time; and (3) the level of economic activity 
and the money supply appear to be interdependent, not independent.
Asset Market Approach. The asset market approach, sometimes called the relative price 
of bonds or portfolio balance approach, argues that exchange rates are determined by the 
supply and demand for financial assets of a wide variety, including bonds. Shifts in the supply 
and demand for widely varied financial assets alter exchange rates. Changes in monetary and 
fiscal policy alter expected returns and perceived relative risks of financial assets, which in 
turn alter rates.
Many of the macroeconomic theoretical developments in recent years focused on how 
monetary and fiscal policy changes altered the relative perceptions of return and risk to the 
stocks of financial assets driving exchange rate changes. Theories of currency substitution, the 
ability of individual and commercial investors to alter the composition of their portfolios, fol￾low the same basic premises of the portfolio balance and re-balance framework.
Unfortunately, for all of the good work and research over the past 50 years, the abil￾ity to forecast exchange rate values in the short term to long term is—as noted by Frankel 
and Rose—sorry. Although academics and practitioners alike agree that in the long run fun￾damental principles such as purchasing power and external balances drive currency values, 
none of the fundamental theories have proven to be very useful in the short to medium term.
M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 282 08/05/23 9:26 AMCHAPTER 9 Foreign Exchange Rate Determination and Intervention 283
... the case for macroeconomic determinants of exchange rates is in a sorry state. [The] 
results indicate that no model based on such standard fundamentals like money supplies, 
real income, interest rates, inflation rates and current account balances will ever succeed in 
explaining or predicting a high percentage of the variation in the exchange rate, at least at 
short- or medium-term frequencies.
—Jeffrey A. Frankel and Andrew K. Rose, “A Survey of Empirical Research on 
Nominal Exchange Rates,” NBER Working Paper No. 4865, 1994.
The forecasting inadequacies of these major theoretical schools of thought (the three 
approaches) has led to the increased popularity of technical analysis. Technical analysis is the 
study of past price behavior (for example, trends and formations of price movements) in an 
effort to gain insights into future price movements. The primary feature of technical analysis 
is the assumption that exchange rates—or, for that matter, all market-driven prices—follow 
trends. And those trends may be analyzed and projected to provide insights into short-term 
and medium-term price movements in the future. Global Finance in Practice 9.1 illustrates 
one example of a simplified technical analysis of the Japanese yen–U.S. dollar cross rate.
Most theories of technical analysis differentiate fair value from market value. Fair value 
is the true long-term value that the price will eventually retain. The market value is subject 
to a multitude of changes and behaviors arising from widespread market participant percep￾tions and beliefs at the time.
The Asset Market Approach to Forecasting. Foreign investors are willing to hold securi￾ties and undertake foreign direct investment in highly developed countries based primarily 
on relative real interest rates (again, a form of parity condition) and the prospects for eco￾nomic growth and profitability.

For example, the U.S. dollar strengthened in the period between 1990 and 2000 despite 
continued worsening balances on the current account. The dollar’s strength, in both nominal 
and real terms, was due to foreign capital inflow motivated by rising stock and real estate 
prices, a low rate of inflation, high real interest returns, and a seemingly endless “irrational 
exuberance” about future economic prospects. This “bubble” burst following the September 
11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. The attacks and their aftermath caused a 
negative reassessment of long-term growth and profitability prospects in the U.S. (as well as a 
newly formed level of political risk for the United States itself). This negative outlook was re￾inforced by a sharp drop in the U.S. stock markets and a series of revelations about failures in 
corporate governance by several large corporations (the Enron era). As would be predicted 
by both the balance of payments and asset market approaches, the U.S. dollar depreciated.
The experience of the United States, as well as other highly developed countries, illus￾trates why some forecasters believe that exchange rates are more heavily influenced by eco￾nomic prospects than by the current account. Consider the case of another asset price.
Assume oil prices have been down for several years (e.g., as was the case in 2020–2021), 
resulting in significantly lower earnings for oil and gas companies. As a result, their share 
prices fell. But that was the past. The price of the company’s share now—today—should re￾flect what the market expects about future earnings, the future price of oil and the company’s 
subsequent earnings in the future, not the past. This same logic can be applied to the relative 
value of a currency, the exchange rate. Only expectations about future events, future flows 
of capital across borders, will be reflected in the exchange value. All other past and present 
events and contemporaneous capital flows are already reflected in the current exchange rate.
The asset market approach to forecasting is also applicable to emerging markets. In this 
case, however, a number of additional variables contribute to exchange rate determination. 
A sampling of these variables includes illiquid capital markets, weak economic and social in￾frastructure, political instability, weak corporate governance laws and practices, susceptibility 
to contagion effects, and widespread speculation. These and other variables are illustrated in 
the section detailing major currency crises later in this chapter.
9.2 Currency Market Intervention
A fundamental problem with exchange rates is that no commonly accepted method ex￾ists to estimate the effectiveness of official intervention into foreign exchange markets. 
Many interrelated factors affect the exchange rate at any given time, and no quantitative 
model exists that is able to provide the magnitude of any causal relationship between 
intervention and an exchange rate when so many interdependent variables are acting 
simultaneously.
—Dick K. Nanto, “Japan’s Currency Intervention: Policy Issues,” CRS Report to 
Congress (United States), July 13, 2007, CRS-7.
Foreign currency intervention—the active management, manipulation, or intervention in the 
market’s valuation of a country’s currency—is a component of currency valuation and fore￾cast that cannot be overlooked. The value of a country’s currency is of significant interest to 
an individual government’s economic and political policies and objectives. Those interests 
sometimes extend beyond the individual country but may actually reflect some form of col￾lective country interest. Although many countries have moved from fixed exchange rate val￾ues long ago, the governments and central bank authorities of the multitude of floating rate 
currencies still privately and publicly profess what value their currency “should hold” in their 
eyes, regardless of whether the market for that currency agrees at that time.
M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 284 08/05/23 9:26 AMCHAPTER 9 Foreign Exchange Rate Determination and Intervention 285
Motivations for Currency Market Intervention
There is a long-standing saying that “what worries bankers is inflation, but what worries 
elected officials is unemployment.” This idea is actually quite useful in understanding the 
various motives for currency market intervention. Depending upon whether a country’s cen￾tral bank is an independent institution (e.g., the U.S. Federal Reserve) or a subsidiary of its 
elected government (as was the Bank of England for many years), the bank’s policies may 
either fight inflation or fight slow economic growth but rarely can they do both.
Traditionally, many countries have pursued policies of pushing the value of their cur￾rencies down in an effort to maintain the price competitiveness of their exports. This policy 
objective, long referred to as “beggar thy neighbor,” has given rise to numerous competitive 
devaluations over the years. It has not, however, fallen out of fashion. The slow economic 
growth and continuing employment problems in many countries in 2012, 2013, and 2014 led 
some governments, the United States and the European Union being prime examples, to 
strive to hold their currency values down.
Alternatively, the fall in the value of the domestic currency will sharply reduce the pur￾chasing power of its people. If the economy is forced, for a variety of reasons, to continue to 
purchase imported products (e.g., petroleum imports because of no domestic substitute), a 
currency devaluation or depreciation may prove highly inflationary and, in the extreme, im￾poverish the country’s people (as in the case of Venezuela).
It is frequently noted that most countries would like to see stable exchange rates and 
to avoid the entanglements associated with manipulating currency values. Unfortunately, 
that would also imply that they are also happy with the current exchange rate’s impact on 
country-level competitiveness. One must look no further than the continuing highly public 
debate between the U.S. and China over the value of the yuan. The U.S. believes the yuan 
is undervalued, making Chinese exports to the U.S. overly cheap, which in turn results in a 
growing current account deficit for the United States and current account surplus for China.
The International Monetary Fund, as one of its basic principles (Article IV), encour￾ages members to avoid pursuing “currency manipulation” to gain competitive advantage over 
other members. The IMF defines manipulation as “protracted large-scale intervention in one 
direction in the exchange market.” It seems, however, that many governments often choose 
to ignore the IMF’s advice.
Intervention Methods
There are many ways in which an individual government or collective of governments and 
central banks can alter the value of their currencies. It should be noted, however, that the 
methods used for market intervention are very much determined by the size of the country’s 
economy, the magnitude of global trading in its currency, and the depth and breadth of de￾velopment in its domestic financial markets. A short list of the intervention methods would 
include direct intervention, indirect intervention, and capital controls.
Direct Intervention. This is the active buying and selling of the domestic currency against 
foreign currencies. This traditionally required a central bank to act like any other trader in the 
currency market—albeit a big one. If the goal were to increase the value of the domestic cur￾rency, the central bank would purchase its own currency using its foreign exchange reserves, 
at least to the limits that it could endure depleting its reserves. If the goal were to decrease 
the value of its currency—to fight an appreciation of its currency’s value on the foreign ex￾change market—it would sell its own currency in exchange for foreign currency, typically a 
major hard currency like the dollar and euro. Although there are no physical limits to the 
ability of central banks to sell their own currency (they could theoretically continue to “print 
M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 285 08/05/23 9:26 AM286 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
money” endlessly), central banks are cautious in the degree to which they may potentially 
change their monetary supplies through intervention.
There is debate among economists over the efficacy of intervention if central banks “ster￾ilize” them by buying or selling domestic securities. If a central bank is attempting to support 
its currency value, it theoretically must allow the foreign exchange sales (intervention) to re￾duce the domestic money supply. Empirical studies of intervention, however, have not proven 
that theoretical concern to hold.
Direct intervention was the primary method used for many years, but beginning in the 
1970s, the world’s currency markets grew so large in size that any individual player, even a 
central bank, might not have the resources—foreign currency reserves—to move the mar￾ket. One solution to this market size challenge has been the occasional use of coordinated 
intervention, in which several major countries, or a collective such as the G8 of industrialized 
countries, agree that a specific currency’s value is out of alignment with their collective inter￾ests. In that situation, the countries may work collectively to intervene and push a currency’s 
value in a desired direction. Global Finance in Practice 9.2 describes the most famous of such 
collusive interventions. If getting agreements between nations was only so easy.
Indirect Intervention. Indirect intervention is the alteration of economic or financial fun￾damentals that are drivers of capital to flow into and out of specific currencies. This was a 
logical development for market manipulation given the growth in size of the global currency 
markets relative to the financial resources of central banks.
The most obvious and widely used factor here is interest rates. Following the financial 
principles outlined in the previous discussion of parity conditions, higher real rates of interest 
attract capital. If a central bank wishes to “defend its currency,” for example, it might fol￾low a restrictive monetary policy, which would drive real rates of interest up. The method is 
therefore no longer limited to the quantity of foreign exchange reserves held by the country. 
Instead, it is limited only by the country’s willingness to suffer the domestic impacts of higher 
real interest rates in order to attract capital inflows and therefore drive up the demand for its 
currency. Alternatively, in a country wishing for its currency to fall in value, particularly when 
confronted with a continual appreciation of its value against major trading partner curren￾cies, the central bank may work to lower real interest rates, reducing the returns to capital.
Because indirect intervention uses tools of monetary policy, a fundamental dimension of 
economic policy, the magnitude and extent of impacts may reach far beyond currency value. 
Overly stimulating economic activity, or increasing money supply growth beyond real eco￾nomic activity, may prove inflationary. The use of such broad-based tools like interest rates to 
manipulate currency values requires a determination of importance, which in some cases may 
involve a choice to pursue international economic goals at the expense of domestic economic 
policy goals.
Capital Controls. This is the restriction of access to foreign currency by the government. 
This involves limiting the ability to exchange domestic currency for foreign currency. When 
access and exchange is permitted, trading takes place only with official designees of the gov￾ernment or central bank and only at dictated exchange rates.
Often, governments will limit access to foreign currencies to commercial trade—for ex￾ample, allowing access to hard currency for the purchase of imports only. Access for invest￾ment purposes—particularly for short-term portfolios where investors are moving into and 
out of interest-bearing accounts and purchasing or selling securities or other funds—is often

Japanese banks. This easy credit pumped significant specu￾lative trend in the Japanese market resulting into an asset 
price bubble.
There was significant pressure from G7 on Japan to rec￾tify its asset bubble. Japan decided to increase the bank rate 
sharply in 1989 to streamline asset prices. This resulted into 
a stock market crash and then fall in asset prices. All this 
resulted in Banks laden with bad debts and the government

had to bail out a number of these banks using public money. 
These banks carried significant bad loans on their books— 
termed as “Zombie Banks.”
Almost at the same time, such external interventions for 
stabilizing a country’s currency and economy have also been 
successful. In September 1985, the G7 countries—The Unit￾ed States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan—Met 
at the Plaza Hotel in New York City to discuss the extreme 
appreciation of the U.S. dollar. The G7 agreed, in what is now 
known as the Plaza Accord, to push the value of the dollar 
down. To achieve this the combined G7 central banks spent 
$10 billion in a coordinated “Sale of Dollars.” This intervention 
was highly successful, and the value of the dollar declined 
against the Japanese Yen and other currencies.
In February 1987, less than two years later, the same 
G7 countries met again, this time in Paris. The new agree￾ment, the Louvre Accord, was an official acknowledgement 
that the dollar has fallen far enough, and the central banks 
agreed to act again in unison to stabilize its value. The dollar’s 
value, however, continued to slide in the period following the 
accord.
The original motivation for the Plaza Accord in 1985 was 
to curtail the massive trade deficit in the United States with its 
trading partners including Japan. The decline in the dollar’s 
value did rectify the U.S. trade balance—except with Japan.

(almost doubling its value), the Japanese economy stagnat￾ed, and the Japanese government undertook an expansion￾ary Monetary Policy. This Policy of cheaply available credit (as 
described in the opening paragraph) fueled the “Asset price 
bubble.” Once these asset prices crashed in 1991 onwards 
due to increase in bank rate as adopted by the Japanese 
Central Bank, Japan entered a decade-long slump of slow 
growth and deflation known as the Lost Decade.

prohibited or limited. The Chinese regulation of access and trading of the Chinese yuan is a 
prime example of the use of capital controls over currency value. In addition to the govern￾ment’s setting the daily rate of exchange, access to the exchange is limited by a difficult and 
timely bureaucratic process for approval and limited to commercial trade transactions.
When Foreign Currency Intervention Fails
It is important to remember that intervention may—and often does—fail. Interventions by 
authorities in Turkey and Japan in recent years serve as classic examples.
Turkey 2014. The Turkish currency crisis of 2014 is a classic example of a drastic indirect in￾tervention that ultimately only slowed the rate of capital flight and currency collapse. Turkey 
had enjoyed some degree of currency stability throughout 2012 and 2013, but the Turkish 
economy (one of the so-called “Fragile Five” countries, along with South Africa, India, 
Indonesia, and Brazil) suffered a widening current account deficit and rising inflation in late 
2013. With the increasing anxieties in emerging markets in the fourth quarter of 2013 over 
the U.S. Federal Reserve’s announcement that it would be slowing its bond purchasing (the 
Taper Program, essentially a tighter monetary policy), capital began exiting Turkey. The lira 
came under increasing downward pressure.
Turkey, however, was conflicted. To defend its currency, the Turkish central bank needed 
to raise interest rates. But the president of Turkey wanted the central bank to lower interest 
rates, which he insisted would stimulate the Turkish economy. (Lower interest rates made 
borrowing cheaper, and hopefully, more companies would borrow and expand.) Instead, 
lower interest rates provided additional incentive for capital flight. Pressures on the lira in￾tensified in early January 2014. At that point, the Turkish central bank had little choice but 
to increase the Turkish one-week bank repurchase interest rate (or repo rate) from 4.5% to 
10.0% in an effort to stop the outflow of capital. Although the first few hours indicated some 
relief, with the lira returning to a slightly stronger value versus the dollar (and euro), within 
days it was trading weaker once again. Indirect intervention in this case had not only proven 
to be a failure, but the attempted cure may in the end have worsened the economy.
Understanding the motivations and methods for currency market intervention is critical 
to any analysis of the determination of future exchange rates. And although it is often impos￾sible to determine, in the end, whether intervention is successful—be it direct or indirect—it 
is a pervasive and persistent feature of currency markets. Governments will always try to pro￾tect their currencies during periods of weakness and on occasion protect weakness in pursuit 
of trade competitiveness. In the end, the success or failure of attempts at intervention may 
depend on both luck and talent. Global Finance in Practice 9.3 provides a short list of possible 
best practices for effective intervention.
Japan 2010. In September 2010, the Bank of Japan intervened in the foreign exchange 
markets for the first time in nearly six years. In an attempt to slow the appreciating yen, Japan 
reportedly bought nearly 20 billion U.S. dollars in exchange. Finance Ministry officials had 
stated publicly that 82 yen per dollar was probably the limit of their tolerance for yen appre￾ciation—and their tolerance was being tested.
As illustrated in Exhibit 9.2, the Bank of Japan intervened on September 13 as the yen 
approached 82 yen per dollar. (The Bank of Japan is independent in its ability to conduct 
Japanese monetary policy, but as the organizational subsidiary of the Japanese Ministry of 
Finance, it must conduct foreign exchange operations on behalf of the Japanese government.) 
Japanese officials reportedly notified authorities in both the United States and the European 
Union of their activity but noted that they had not asked for permission or support. The in￾tervention resulted in public outcry from Beijing to Washington to London over the “new era 
of currency intervention.”

traders or associates in a variety of geographic markets and 
trading centers, possibly other central banks, may increase 
effectiveness.
Use Good News. Particularly when trying to quell a 
currency fall, timing the intervention to coincide with positive 
economic, financial, or business news closely associated 
with a country’s currency market can be helpful. Traders 
often argue that “markets wish to celebrate good news,” and 
currencies may be no different.
Don’t Be Cheap; Overwhelm Them. Traders fear missing 
the moment, and a large, coordinated, well-timed intervention 
can make them fear they are leaning in the wrong direction. A 
successful intervention is in many ways a battle of psychology 
and can be used to leverage the insecurities of traders. If it 
appears the intervention is gradually having the desired impact, 
throw ever-increasing assets into the battle. Don’t get cheap.
Rules of Thumb for Effective Intervention
A variety of factors, features, and tactics, according to many 
currency traders, influence the effectiveness of an interven￾tion effort.
Don’t Lean into the Wind. Markets that are moving 
significantly in one direction, like the strengthening of the 
Japanese yen in the fall of 2010, are very tough to turn. 
Termed “leaning into the wind,” intervention during a strong 
market movement will most likely result in a very expensive 
failure. Currency traders argue that central banks should time 
their intervention very carefully, choosing moments when 
trading volumes are light and the direction is nearly flat.
Coordinate Timing and Activity. The markets are much 
more likely to be influenced if they believe the intervention 
activity is reflecting a grassroots movement and not the 
activity of a single trading entity or bank. For this reason, using

Although market intervention is always looked down upon by free market proponents, 
the move by Japan was seen as particularly frustrating as it came at a time when the United 
States was continuing to pressure China to revalue its currency, the renminbi. As noted by 
economist Nouriel Roubini, “We are in a world where everyone wants a weak currency,” a 
marketplace in which all countries are looking to stimulate their domestic economies through 
exceptionally low interest rates and corresponding weak currency values— a global race to 
the bottom.

Ironically, as illustrated in Exhibit 9.2, it appears that the intervention was largely unsuc￾cessful. When the Bank of Japan started buying dollars in an appreciating yen market—the so￾called “leaning into the wind” or “one-way intervention” strategy—it was hoping to either stop 
the appreciation, change the direction of the spot rate movement, or both. In either pursuit, it 
appears to have failed. As one analyst noted, it was essentially a short-term fix to a long-term 
problem. Although the yen spiked downward (more yen per dollar) for a few days, it returned 
once again to an appreciating path within a week. Exhibit 9.3 uses the traditional framework 
of supply and demand to illustrate what Japan was attempting to do through its intervention.
Japan’s frequent interventions have been the subject of much study. In an August 2005 
study by the IMF, it was noted that between 1991 and 2005, the Bank of Japan had inter￾vened on 340 days, while the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened on 22 days and the European 
Central Bank intervened on only 4 days (since its inception in 1998). Although the IMF has 
never found Japanese intervention to be officially “currency manipulation,” an analysis by 
Takatoshi Ito in 2004 concluded that there was on average a one-yen-per-dollar change in 
market rates, roughly 1%, as a result of Japanese intervention over time.
There is no historical case in which [yen] selling intervention succeeded in immediately 
stopping the preexisting long-term uptrend in the Japanese yen.

Intervention by the Bank of Japan involves the Bank entering the foreign exchange market to demand dollars—to buy U.S. dollars in
exchange for Japanese yen. If the Bank’s timing and magnitude of intervention are sufficient, it can shift the demand for USD outward,
driving the price of the dollar up and the value of the yen down (now taking more yen to purchase one dollar).

Organizations of economic union and integration present extreme examples of cur￾rency market intervention. As described in Chapter 2, the launch of the euro in 1999 fol￾lowed two decades of economic, monetary, and currency coordination and intervention. 
This system, the European Monetary System (EMS), used an elaborate system of bilat￾eral responsibility, in which both country’s governments were committed to maintaining 
the parity exchange rates. Their commitment extended to both types of intervention, di￾rect and indirect. Global Finance in Practice 9.4 describes the EMS system, the so-called 
“snake in a tunnel.”
9.3 Disequilibrium: Exchange Rates 
in Emerging Markets
Although the three different schools of thought on exchange rate determination described 
earlier in Exhibit 9.1 make understanding exchange rates appear to be straightforward, that 
is rarely the case. The large and liquid capital and currency markets follow many of the prin￾ciples outlined so far relatively well in the medium to long term. The smaller and less liq￾uid markets, however, frequently demonstrate behaviors that seemingly contradict theory. 
The problem lies not in the theory, but in the relevance of the assumptions underlying the 
theory. An analysis of the emerging market crises illustrates a number of these seeming 
contradictions.
After a number of years of relative global economic tranquility, beginning in the second 
half of the 1990s, a series of currency crises shook all emerging markets. The Asian crisis of 
July 1997 and the fall of the Argentine peso in 2002 demonstrate an array of emerging market

The European Monetary System (EMS) in use between 1979 and the launch of the euro in 1999 established a central rate (or parity rate) of
exchange between two currencies which was to be the target long-term exchange rate. The exchange rate was then allowed to trade freely as
long as it stayed within a band of ±2.25% of that rate. If or when the rate crossed the upper or lower intervention rates, the two countries
were required to both begin intervention efforts to drive the exchange rate back toward the Central Rate trading zone.
One of the basic tenets of the system which drove much of its success was the bilateral responsibility it established between the countries in
maintaining the exchange rate. If for example the German mark (Deutschemark, DM) was appreciating against the French franc (FF) and the
market rate crossed the intervention rate, both governments were required to undertake intervention, either direct intervention (buying and
selling their currencies in the market) or indirect intervention (such as changing interest rates) or both to maintain trading about the central rate.

economic failures, each with its own complex causes and unknown outlooks. These crises also 
illustrate the growing problem of capital flight and short-run international speculation in cur￾rency and securities markets. We will use each of the individual crises to focus on a specific 
dimension of the causes and consequences.
The Asian Crisis of 1997
At a 1998 conference on the Asian financial crisis, one speaker noted that the world’s preoc￾cupation with the economic problems of Indonesia was incomprehensible because the size 
of the Asian economies was so small, comparing the GDP of Indonesia to the state of North 
Carolina. The following speaker observed, however, that the last time he had checked, North 
Carolina did not have a population of 220 million people.
The roots of the Asian currency crisis arose from a fundamental change in the economics 
of the region, the transition of many Asian nations from being net exporters to net importers. 
Starting as early as 1990 in Thailand, the rapidly expanding economies of the Far East began 
importing more than they exported, requiring major net capital inflows to support their cur￾rencies. As long as the capital continued to flow in—capital for manufacturing plants, dam 
projects, infrastructure development, and even real estate speculation—the pegged exchange 
rates of the region could be maintained. When the investment capital inflows stopped, how￾ever, crisis was inevitable.
The most visible roots of the crisis were in the excesses of capital inflows into Thailand. 
With rapid economic growth and rising profits forming the backdrop, Thai firms, banks, and 
finance companies had ready access to capital on the international markets, finding U.S. dol￾lar debt cheap offshore. Thai banks continued to raise capital internationally, extending credit 
to a variety of domestic investments and enterprises beyond what the Thai economy could 
support. As capital flows into the Thai market hit record rates, financial flows poured into in￾vestments of all kinds. As the investment “bubble” expanded, some participants raised ques￾tions about the economy’s ability to repay the rising debt. The baht came under attack.
Crisis. In May and June 1997, the Thai government repeatedly intervened in the foreign 
exchange markets directly (using up much of its foreign exchange reserves) and indirectly 
(by raising interest rates). A second round of speculative attacks in late June and early July 
proved too much for the Thai authorities. On July 2, 1997, the Thai central bank finally al￾lowed the baht to float (or sink in this case). The baht fell 17% against the U.S. dollar and 
more than 12% against the Japanese yen in a matter of hours. By November, the baht had 
fallen from 25 to 40 baht per dollar, a fall of about 38%, as illustrated in Exhibit 9.4.
In Asia’s own version of the tequila effect, a number of neighboring Asian nations, some 
with and some without similar characteristics to Thailand, came under speculative attack by cur￾rency traders and capital markets. The Philippine peso, the Malaysian ringgit, and the Indonesian 
rupiah all fell in the months following the July baht devaluation. In late October 1997, Taiwan 
caught the markets off balance with a surprise competitive devaluation of 15%. The Taiwanese 
devaluation seemed only to renew the momentum of the crisis. Although the Hong Kong dollar 
survived (at great expense to its foreign exchange reserves), the Korean won (KRW) was not so 
lucky. In November 1997, the historically stable won also fell victim, falling from 900 Korean won 
per dollar to more than 1100. The only currency that had not fallen besides the Hong Kong dol￾lar was the Chinese renminbi, which was not freely convertible at the time.
Causal Complexities. The Asian economic crisis—for it was more than just a currency 
collapse—had many roots besides traditional balance of payments difficulties. Although the 
causes of crisis were a bit different in each country, all countries shared three common con￾tributors: corporate socialism, corporate governance cronyism, and banking instability.
M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 292 08/05/23 9:26 AMCHAPTER 9 Foreign Exchange Rate Determination and Intervention 293
■ Corporate socialism. The rapidly growing export-led countries of Asia had known only 
stability. Because of the influence of government and politics in the business arena, even 
in the event of failure, it was believed that government would not allow firms to fail, 
workers to lose their jobs, or banks to close. Practices that had persisted for decades with￾out challenge, such as lifetime employment, were now no longer sustainable.
■ Corporate governance cronyism. Many firms operating within the Far Eastern business 
environments were largely controlled either by families or by groups related to the gov￾erning party or body of the country. This concept, cronyism, means that the interests of 
minority stockholders and creditors are often secondary at best to the primary motiva￾tions of corporate management.
■ Banking instability. The banking sector had fallen behind. Bank regulatory structures 
and markets had been deregulated nearly without exception across the globe. The central 
role played by banks in the conduct of business had largely been ignored. As firms across 
Asia collapsed, government coffers were emptied and banks failed. Without banks, the 
“plumbing” of business conduct was shut down.
In the aftermath of the Asian crisis, the international speculator and philanthropist 
George Soros was accused of being the instigator of the crisis. As described in Global Finance 
in Practice 9.4, Soros was likely only the messenger.
The Role of Soros. In the weeks following the start of the Asian crisis in July 1997, officials 
from a number of countries, including Thailand and Malaysia, blamed the international finan￾cier George Soros for causing the crisis. Particularly vocal was Prime Minister of Malaysia 
Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, who repeatedly implied that Soros had a political agenda associ￾ated with Burma’s prospect of joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Mahathir noted in a number of public speeches that Soros might have been making a po￾litical statement and not just speculating against currency values. Mahathir argued that the 
poor people of Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia would pay a great price for 
Soros’s attacks on Asian currencies.
Soros is probably the most famous currency speculator (and possibly the most success￾ful) in global history. Admittedly responsible for much of the European financial crisis of 
1992 and the fall of the French franc in 1993, he once again was the recipient of critical atten￾tion following the fall of the Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit.
Nine years later, in 2006, Mahathir and Soros met for the first time. Mahathir apolo￾gized and withdrew his previous accusations. In Soros’s book published in 1998, The Crisis of 
Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered, Soros explained that his fund had shorted the 
Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit (signed agreements to deliver the currency to other buyers 
at future dates) beginning in early 1997. He argued this meant that later in the spring, when 
his fund attempted to cover their positions, they were buyers of the currencies, not sellers, and 
therefore were on the “good side” and were in effect helping to support the currency values 
as the fund moved to realize its profits. Unfortunately the large short positions formed early 
in 1997 were clear signals in the market (word does move rapidly in currency markets) that 
Soros Funds expected the baht and ringgit to fall. The Economist (August 2, 1997, p. 57) had 
its own view on blame: “For Thailand to blame Mr. Soros for its plight is rather like condemn￾ing an undertaker for burying a suicide.”
The Argentine Crisis of 2002
Now, most Argentines are blaming corrupt politicians and foreign devils for their ills. But 
few are looking inward, at mainstream societal concepts such as viveza criolla, an Argen￾tine cultural quirk that applauds anyone sly enough to get away with a fast one. It is one 
reason behind massive tax evasion here: One of every three Argentines does so—and many 
like to brag about it.
—Anthony Faiola, “Once-Haughty Nation’s Swagger Loses Its Currency,”
The Washington Post, March 13, 2002.
Argentina’s economic ups and downs have historically been tied to the health of the 
Argentine peso. South America’s southernmost resident—which oftentimes considered itself 
more European than Latin American—had been wracked by hyperinflation, international in￾debtedness, and economic collapse in the 1980s. By 1991, the people of Argentina had enough. 
Economic reform was a common goal of the Argentine people. They were not interested in 
quick fixes but lasting change and a stable future. They nearly got it.
In 1991, the Argentine peso had been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a one-to-one rate of 
exchange. The policy was a radical departure from traditional methods of fixing the rate of 
a currency’s value. Argentina adopted a currency board, a structure—rather than merely a 
commitment—to limit the growth of money in the economy. Under a currency board, the 
central bank may increase the money supply in the banking system only with increases in 
its holdings of hard currency reserves. The reserves were, in this case, U.S. dollars. By remov￾ing the ability of government to expand the rate of growth of the money supply, Argentina 
believed it was eliminating the source of inflation that had devastated its standard of living. 
It was both a recipe for conservative and prudent financial management and a decision to 
eliminate the power of politicians, elected and unelected, to exercise judgment, both good 
and bad. It was an automatic and unbendable rule.
This “cure” was a restrictive monetary policy that slowed economic growth. The country’s 
unemployment rate rose to double-digit levels in 1994 and stayed there. The real GDP growth 
M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 294 08/05/23 9:26 AMCHAPTER 9 Foreign Exchange Rate Determination and Intervention 295
rate settled into recession in late 1998, and the economy continued to shrink through 2000. 
Argentine banks allowed depositors to hold their money in either pesos or dollars. This was 
intended to provide a market-based discipline to the banking and political systems and to 
demonstrate the government’s unwavering commitment to maintaining the peso’s value par￾ity with the dollar. Although intended to build confidence in the system, in the end it proved 
disastrous to the Argentine banking system.
Economic Crisis. The 1998 recession proved to be unending. Three and a half years later, 
Argentina was still in recession. By 2001, crisis conditions had revealed three very important 
underlying problems with Argentina’s economy: (1) the Argentine peso was overvalued, (2) 
the currency board regime had eliminated monetary policy alternatives for macroeconomic 
policy, and (3) the Argentine government budget deficit was out of control. Inflation had not 
been eliminated, and the world’s markets were watching.
Most of the major economies of South America now slid into recession. With slowing 
economic activity, imports fell. Most South American currencies now fell against the U.S. dol￾lar, but because the Argentine peso remained pegged to the dollar, Argentine exports grew 
increasingly overpriced. The sluggish economic growth in Argentina warranted expansionary 
economic policies, but the currency board’s basic premise was that the money supply to the 
financial system could not be expanded any further or faster than the ability of the economy 
to capture dollar reserves—eliminating monetary policy.
Government spending was not slowing, however. As the unemployment rate grew 
higher, as poverty and social unrest grew—both in Buenos Aires, the civil center of 
Argentina, and in the outer provinces—the government was faced with pressure to close 
the economic and social gaps. Government spending continued to increase, but tax receipts 
did not. Argentina turned to the international markets to aid in financing its deficit spend￾ing. The total foreign debt of the country began rising dramatically. Only a number of IMF 
capital injections prevented the total foreign debt of the country from skyrocketing. By 
the end of the 1990s, however, total foreign debt had doubled, and the economy’s earning 
power had not.
As economic conditions continued to deteriorate, banks suffered increasing runs. 
Depositors, fearing that the peso would be devalued, lined up to withdraw their money—
both Argentine peso and U.S. dollar cash balances. Pesos were converted to dollars, once 
again adding fuel to the growing fire of currency crisis. The government, fearing that 
the increasing financial drain on banks would cause their collapse, closed the banks. 
Consumers, unable to withdraw more than $250 per week, were instructed to use debit 
cards and credit cards to make purchases and to conduct the everyday transactions re￾quired by society.
Devaluation. On Sunday, January 6, 2002, in the first act of his presidency, President 
Eduardo Duhalde devalued the peso from 1.00 Argentine peso per U.S. dollar to 1.40. But the 
economic pain continued. Two weeks after the devaluation, the banks were still closed. On 
February 3, 2002, the Argentine government announced that the peso would be floated, as 
shown in Exhibit 9.5. The government would no longer attempt to fix or manage its value to 
any specific level, allowing the market to find or set the exchange rate.
The lessons to be drawn from the Argentine story are somewhat complex. From the very 
beginning, Argentina and the IMF both knew the currency board system was a risky strategy, 
but given Argentina’s long and disastrous experience with exchange rates, the strategy was 
one that had been deemed worth taking. In the end, however, despite best efforts, the use of 
such a radically strict exchange rate system, in which government gave up nearly all control 
over its sovereign monetary system, proved unsustainable.

9.4 Currency Forecasting in Practice
There are numerous foreign exchange forecasting services, many of which are provided by 
banks and independent consultants. In addition, some multinational firms have their own 
in-house forecasting capabilities. Predictions can be based on econometric models, technical 
analysis, intuition, and a certain measure of gall.
Exhibit 9.6 summarizes the various forecasting periods, regimes, and most widely fol￾lowed methodologies. Whether any of the forecasting services are worth their cost depends 
both on the motive for forecasting as well as the required accuracy. For example, long-run 
forecasts may be motivated by a multinational firm’s desire to initiate a foreign investment 
in Japan or perhaps to raise long-term funds in Japanese yen. Or a portfolio manager may be 
considering diversifying for the long term in Japanese securities. The longer the time horizon 
of the forecast, the more inaccurate, but also the less critical the forecast is likely to be.
Short-term forecasts are typically motivated by a desire to hedge a receivable, payable, 
or dividend for a period of perhaps three months. Short-term forecasts rely less on long￾run economic fundamentals and more on technical factors in the marketplace, government 
intervention, news, and the passing whims of traders and investors. Accuracy of the forecast is 
critical, since most of the exchange rate changes are relatively small even though the day-to￾day volatility may be high.
Forecasting services normally undertake fundamental economic analysis for long-term 
forecasts, and some base their short-term forecasts on the same basic model. Others base 
their short-term forecasts on technical analysis similar to that conducted in security analysis. 
They attempt to correlate exchange rate changes with various other variables, regardless of 
whether there is any economic rationale for the correlation.

The chances of these forecasts being consistently useful or profitable depend on whether 
one believes the foreign exchange market is efficient. The more efficient the market is, the 
more likely it is that exchange rates are “random walks,” with past price behavior providing 
no clues to the future. The less efficient the foreign exchange market is, the better the chance 
that forecasters may get lucky and find a key relationship that holds, at least for the short 
run. If the relationship is consistent, however, others will soon discover it and the market will 
become efficient again with respect to that piece of information.
Technical Analysis
Technical analysts, traditionally referred to as chartists, focus on price and volume data to de￾termine past trends that are expected to continue into the future. The single most important 
element of technical analysis is that future exchange rates are based on the current exchange 
rate. Exchange rate movements, similar to equity price movements, can be subdivided into 
three time horizons: (1) day-to-day movement, which is seemingly random; (2) short-term 
movements, ranging from several days to trends lasting several months; and (3) long-term 
movements, characterized by up and down long-term trends. Long-term technical analysis 
has gained new popularity as a result of recent research into the possibility that long-term 
“waves” in currency movements exist under floating exchange rates.
The longer the time horizon of the forecast, the more inaccurate the forecast is likely 
to be. Whereas forecasting for the long run must depend on economic fundamentals of ex￾change rate determination, many of the forecast needs of the firm are short to medium term 
in their time horizon and can be addressed with less theoretical approaches. These techni￾cal analyses based on time—time series techniques—infer no theory or causality but simply 
predict future values from the recent past. Forecasters freely mix fundamental theories—
the three approaches listed previously in Exhibit 9.1—and technical analysis, presumably

because forecasting is like playing horseshoes—getting close counts. Exhibit 9.7 provides a 
short analysis of how accurate one prestigious forecaster was over a three-year period.
There are many different foreign exchange forecasting services and service providers. 
JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) is one of the most prestigious and widely used. A review of JPMC’s 
forecasting accuracy for the U.S. dollar–euro spot exchange rate for the 2002–2005 period, in 
90-day increments, is presented in the exhibit.
2
 The graph shows the actual spot exchange rate 
for the period and JPMC’s forecast for the spot exchange rate for the same period.
There is good news, and there is bad news. The good news is that JPMC hit the actual 
spot rate dead-on in both May and November 2002. The bad news is that after that, it missed. 
Somewhat worrisome is when the forecast got the direction wrong. For example, in February 
2004, JPMC had forecast the spot rate to move from the current rate of $1.27 = €1.00 to $1.32 = 
€1.00, but in fact, the dollar had appreciated dramatically in the following three-month period 
to close at $1.19. This was in fact a massive difference. The lesson learned is probably that re￾gardless of how professional and prestigious a forecaster may be and how accurate it may have 
been in the past, forecasting the future—by anyone for anything—is challenging to say the least.
Cross-Rate Consistency in Forecasting
International financial managers must often forecast their home currency exchange rates for 
the set of countries in which the firm operates, not only to decide whether to hedge or to 
make an investment but also as part of preparing multi-country operating budgets in the 
home country’s currency. These are the operating budgets against which the performance of 
foreign subsidiary managers will be judged. Checking cross-rate consistency—the reasonable￾ness of the cross rates implicit in individual forecasts—acts as a reality check.

Forecasting: What to Think?
Obviously, with the variety of theories and practices, forecasting exchange rates into the fu￾ture is a daunting task. Here is a synthesis of our thoughts and experience:
■ It appears, from decades of theoretical and empirical studies, that exchange rates do ad￾here to fundamental principles and theories outlined in the previous sections. Fundamen￾tals do apply in the long term. There is, therefore, something of a fundamental equilibrium 
path for a currency’s value.
■ It also seems that in the short term, a variety of random events, institutional frictions, and 
technical factors may cause currency values to deviate significantly from their long-term 
fundamental path. This is sometimes referred to as noise. Clearly, therefore, we might 
expect deviations from the long-term path not only to occur but also to occur with some 
regularity and relative longevity.
Exhibit 9.8 illustrates this synthesis of forecasting thought. The long-term equilibrium 
path of the currency—although relatively well defined in retrospect—is not always apparent 
in the short term. The exchange rate itself may deviate in something of a cycle or wave about 
the long-term path.
If market participants agree on the general long-term path and possess stabilizing ex￾pectations, the currency’s value will periodically return to the long-term path. It is critical, 
however, that when the currency’s value rises above the long-term path, most market par￾ticipants see it as being overvalued and respond by selling the currency—causing its price to 
fall. Similarly, when the currency’s value falls below the long-term path, market participants 
respond by buying the currency—driving its value up. This is what is meant by stabilizing ex￾pectations: Market participants continually respond to deviations from the long-term path by 
buying or selling to drive the currency back to the long-term path.

If market participants have stabilizing expectations, when forces drive the currency’s value below the long-term fundamental
equilibrium path, they will buy the currency driving its value back toward the fundamental equilibrium path. If market participants
have destabilizing expectations, and forces drive the currency’s value away from the fundamental path, participants may not
move immediately or in significant volume to push the currency’s value back toward the fundamental equilibrium path for an
extended period of time (or possibly establish a new long-term fundamental path).
EXHIBIT 9.8 Short-Term Noise versus Long-Term Trends
M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 299 08/05/23 9:26 AM300 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
If, for some reason, the market becomes unstable, as illustrated by the dotted deviation 
path in Exhibit 9.8, the exchange rate may move significantly away from the long-term path 
for longer periods of time. Causes of these destabilizing markets—weak infrastructure (such 
as the banking system) and political or social events that dictate economic behaviors—are 
often the actions of speculators and inefficient markets.
Exchange Rate Dynamics: Making Sense of Market Movements
Although the various theories surrounding exchange rate determination are clear and sound, 
it may appear on a day-to-day basis that the currency markets do not pay much attention to 
the theories—they don’t read the books! The difficulty is in understanding which fundamen￾tals are driving markets at which points in time.
One example of this relative confusion over exchange rate dynamics is the phenomenon 
known as overshooting. Assume that the current spot rate between the dollar and the euro, 
as illustrated in Exhibit 9.9, is S0. The U.S. Federal Reserve announces an expansionary mon￾etary policy that cuts U.S. dollar interest rates. If euro-denominated interest rates remain un￾changed, the new spot rate expected by the exchange markets based on interest differentials 
is S1. This immediate change in the exchange rate is typical of how the markets react to news, 
distinct economic and political events that are observable. The immediate change in the value 
of the dollar-euro is therefore based on interest differentials.
As time passes, however, the price impacts of the monetary policy change start work￾ing their way through the economy. As price changes occur over the medium to long term, 
purchasing power parity forces drive the market dynamics, and the spot rate moves from 
S1 toward S2. Although both S1 and S2 rates are determined by the market, they reflect the 
dominance of different theoretical principles. As a result, the initial lower value of the dollar 
of S1 is described as overshooting the longer-term equilibrium value of S2.
This is, of course, only one possible series of events and market reactions. Currency 
markets are subject to new news every hour of every day, making it very difficult to fore￾cast exchange rate movements in short periods of time. In the longer term, as shown in 
Exhibit 9.9, the markets do customarily return to the fundamentals of exchange rate 
determination.

Summary Points
■ There are three major theoretical approaches to ex￾plaining the economic determinants of exchange rates: 
parity conditions, balance of payments, and the mon￾etary and asset market approach.
■ The recurrence of exchange rate crises demonstrates 
not only how sensitive currency values continue to be 
to economic fundamentals but also how vulnerable 
many emerging market currencies are.
■ Foreign exchange market intervention may be con￾ducted via direct intervention, buying and selling the 
country’s own currency, or indirect intervention, by 
changing the motivations and rules for capital to move 
into or out of a country and its currency.
■ Many emerging market currencies periodically expe￾rience fundamental exchange rate disequilibrium. In 
the past, the most frequent cause of disequilibrium 
was hyperinflation, but today the most frequently ex￾perienced challenge is the large and rapid inflow and 
outflow of non-current account capital.
■ Exchange rate forecasting is part of global business. 
All businesses of all kinds must form some expecta￾tion of what the future holds.
■ Short-term forecasting of exchange rates, in practice, 
focuses on current spot rates if fixed and on trends and 
forward rates if floating. Longer-term forecasting re￾quires a return to the basic analysis of exchange rate 
fundamentals such as balance of payments relative in￾flation and interest rates, and the long-run properties 
of purchasing power parity.
■ In the short term, a variety of random events, insti￾tutional frictions, and technical factors may cause 
currency values to deviate significantly from their 
long-term fundamental path. In the long term, it does 
appear that exchange rates follow a fundamental equi￾librium path, one consistent with the fundamental 
theories of exchange rate determination.
MINI-CASE
Is China a Currency Manipulator?3
Washington—The Omnibus Trade and Competitive￾ness Act of 1988 requires the Secretary of the Trea￾sury to analyze the exchange rate policies of other 
countries. Under Section 3004 of the Act, the Secre￾tary must “consider whether countries manipulate 
the rate of exchange between their currency and the 
United States dollar for purposes of preventing ef￾fective balance of payments adjustments or gaining 
unfair competitive advantage in international trade.” 
Secretary Mnuchin, under the auspices of Presi￾dent Trump, has today determined that China is a 
Currency Manipulator.
—“Treasury Designates China as a Currency Manipulator,” 
Press Release, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 
August 5, 2019.
The Economist magazine termed it “name calling,” but 
many other analysts described the labeling of China as a 
“currency manipulator” a part of ongoing trade negotia￾tions. It was in many ways not a surprise as U.S. President 
Donald Trump had been accusing China of currency ma￾nipulation for years. But this was the first time the U.S. 
government had labeled a trading partner as a currency 
manipulator in 25 years—the last case also being China.4
3 Copyright ©2021 Thunderbird School of Global Management, a unit of the Arizona State University Knowledge Enterprise. All rights

4 The U.S. had only ever labeled three countries as currency manipulators: China (1992–1994), Japan (1988), and Taiwan (1988).
It was unclear what actions—if any—the U.S. would take 
as a result of this designation.
U.S. grounds were laid out sequentially in its press re￾lease. China confirmed that it controlled the value of the 
Chinese renminbi. China had extensive foreign exchange 
reserves. China acknowledged active management of its 
currency in the recent past. China, as a member of the 
G20, had committed to not using competitive devaluation 
to gain advantages in international trade. China’s currency 
had fallen in value versus the U.S. dollar in recent days 
and weeks. What the Treasury department’s press release 
didn’t say was that a full one-half of the current U.S. trade 
deficit was with one country—China.
U.S. Law
“We called them on manipulation and they brought their 
numbers back and they brought them back rapidly and 
they were able to do that because they manipulate,” Trump 
said. “It’s called monetary manipulation. Not good.”
—President Donald Trump, “New IMF report doesn’t back 
Trump’s currency manipulation charge against China,” Doug 
Palmer, Politico, August 19, 2019.
U.S. law was a bit confusing on the topic of currency ma￾nipulation. The Trump administration had cited the 1988 
M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 301 08/05/23 9:26 AM302 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act in its 
finding. Under the 1988 act, the Treasury department was 
to annually, in consultation with the International Mon￾etary Fund (IMF), evaluate whether countries were ma￾nipulating their currencies against the dollar to distort 
balance of payments or to gain competitive advantage in 
trade (cheapen their products for export). The latter argu￾ment seemed to be implied by the Treasury press release.
A more recent U.S. trade law, the 2015 Trade En￾forcement Act, was much more specific. It laid out three 
very specific criteria to be used in the determination of a 
trade partner manipulating their currency’s trading value: 
(1) a bilateral trade surplus with the U.S. of at least $20 
billion; (2) an overall current account surplus exceeding 
2% of GDP; and (3) direct intervention, government pur￾chases of dollars in the foreign exchange market, in six of 
the last 12 months, exceeding 2% of GDP. (The Treasury 
department has discretion in setting the specific quantita￾tive levels for each criteria; it had most recently set these.) 
A recent Treasury department report had concluded that 
China currently met only one of these three criteria—the 
first—as shown in Exhibit A. Also shown is China’s official 
currency intervention as a percent age of GDP; although 
large in the past, it was negligible in 2019.
There was little doubt that China enjoyed a massive 
trade surplus with the U.S., $380 billion in the third quar￾ter of 2019. Theoretically, an undervalued currency would 
contribute to the creation of that, making Chinese exports 
to the U.S. relatively cheap and U.S. imports to China rela￾tively expensive.
Currency manipulation, under both IMF and U.S. law 
and policy, was narrowly defined. Manipulation was only 
seen as resulting from direct intervention—the buying 
and selling of foreign currencies using foreign exchange 
reserves. Indirect intervention, such as the alteration of 
interest rates, had frequently been discussed as potential 
manipulation. By the IMF’s most recent discussion on the 
topic in 2013 had come to no conclusion.
If the U.S. actually imposed tariffs in retaliation for 
what it believed to be currency manipulation, it would be 
considered in direct conflict with World Trade Organiza￾tion (WTO) rules. That, argued trade negotiators, would 
likely prompt retaliatory actions by other countries.
IMF on Currency Manipulation
The IMF was established as part of the Bretton Woods 
Agreement in 1944 to promote stability in the international 
monetary system. Currency manipulation was a real con￾cern at the time, as a multitude of countries had pursued pol￾icies of competitive devaluation in the 1930s (long argued 
as one of the many contributing factors to World War II).

EXHIBIT A China’s Trade Surplus with the U.S. and Currency Intervention
M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 302 08/05/23 9:26 AMCHAPTER 9 Foreign Exchange Rate Determination and Intervention 303
When a country joined the IMF, it agreed to not use de￾valuation of its currency to gain trade advantages. In the 
80 years since its birth, the IMF had never found a country 
guilty of currency manipulation.
Although there had been many instances in which 
currency manipulation was suspected, the IMF had found 
it extremely difficult to prove intent. In one glaring exam￾ple of the IMF’s unwillingness to push the point, in 2007 
it had noted publicly that China was running a current￾account surplus of 10% of GDP while simultaneously 
purchasing more than $2 billion a day in foreign currency￾denominated assets. But it was still not considered to be 
officially manipulating its currency value.5
The IMF had recently completed a review of the Chi￾nese economy as part of its regular monitoring of econom￾ic activity, termed Article IV, including currency issues.6
Exchange rate. The bilateral RMB/USD rate depreci￾ated relatively rapidly from mid-June to early August 
2018, when measures to counter depreciation pressure – 
the 20 percent reserve requirement for FX derivatives 
(a capital flow management measure [CFM]) and the 
countercyclical adjustment factor (CCAF) in the daily 
trading band’s central parity formation – were reintro￾duced. Despite the RMB/USD depreciation, the RMB 
was broadly stable against the basket and depreciated in 
real effective terms by about 2½ percent since the last 
Article IV. Estimates suggest little FX intervention by the 
PBC. At about US$3.2 trillion, China’s foreign currency 
reserves remain more than adequate to allow a contin￾ued transition to a floating exchange rate.
In short, the IMF had not found China to be devalu￾ing its currency. In fact, it noted that the government had 
taken active measures the previous year to “counter de￾preciation pressure” as well as finding little evidence that 
the People’s Bank of China (PBC) had been conducting 
significant intervention.
The previous month the IMF, in a separate report, 
had found the U.S. dollar to be overvalued by 6% to 12%, 
not a significant amount. The report had also noted that 
direct foreign-exchange intervention had been playing an 
ever-smaller role in determining currency values in recent 
years. Economic analysts believed it was expansionary fis￾cal policy by the U.S. likely driving the overvaluation.
Why Now?
In an additional element of irony, the recent fall in the 
value of the Chinese renminbi was likely in response to 
new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Only a 
few days prior to Treasury’s announcement, the adminis￾tration had announced the imposition of a 10% tariff on 
more than $300 billion of U.S. imports from China. This 
was only the latest salvo in the deteriorating trade rela￾tionship between Washington and Beijing.
The tariff announcement immediately sent the ren￾minbi’s value down on world markets as Chinese eco￾nomic prospects were seen as dimming in a growing 
trade war. On August 6, the renminbi had crossed what 
some analysts call “the line in the sand,” the psychologi￾cal and political barrier of 7 renminbi per dollar, as seen 
in Exhibit B.
Trade analysts believed that China would likely argue 
that it was not its responsibility to stabilize the renminbi’s 
value when it was the actions of the U.S. government driv￾ing the change in value, and that was likely the case. Since 
the PBC did actively manage the renminbi’s value, regu￾larly and officially, the fall in its value to an 11-year low 
was allowed.
As complicated as U.S. trade law was, understanding 
China’s currency management system was just as perplex￾ing. As the official keeper of the renminbi, the PBC set 
a daily “midpoint” in trading value based on the closing 
value from the previous day. It then had the discretion to 
allow the renminbi to trade onshore plus or minus 2% 
from that fix. (The offshore market for the renminbi was 
mostly run out of Hong Kong and was not subject to di￾rect control.) It regularly intervened to ensure the new fix. 
Although this procedure limited daily movement, it al￾lowed a significant discretion in its movement over time. 
And there was a second more mysterious dimension to 
potential politically driven intervention. China’s commer￾cial banks, theoretically independent from the PBC, made 
frequent purchases of U.S. dollar–denominated assets and 
securities, like U.S. Treasury bonds. This clearly drove the 
demand for dollars up.
Outcome
In January 2020, five months later and two days before 
renewed trade negotiations were scheduled to begin be￾tween the U.S. and China, the U.S. Secretary of the Trea￾sury announced that it was dropping the designation of 
China as a currency manipulator. He noted that “China 
has made enforceable commitments to refrain from com￾petitive devaluation, while promoting transparency and 
accountability.” China made no public explanation of any 
change in its currency policy. And for the record, the ren￾minbi’s value spent much of 2020 over the unofficial line 
in the sand.

1. What is your opinion of the three separate criteria 
used by the U.S. in the determination of currency 
manipulation?
2. Why has the IMF seemingly been so ineffective in 
policing currency manipulation?
3. Do you believe that the narrow definition of currency 
manipulation used by the IMF and the U.S. is adequate?
4. In your opinion, was China a currency manipulator?
P.S. For those interested in tracking potential currency 
manipulators in the eyes of the U.S., the Council on For￾eign Relations has a real-time tracker of major U.S. trading 
partners. The tracker evaluates all major trading partners 
quarterly on the basis of whether they meet the three in￾dividual criteria under the 2015 Trade Enforcement Act.

304 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
Questions
9.1 Exchange Rate Determination. What are the three 
basic theoretical approaches to exchange rate 
determination?
9.2 Purchasing Power Parity Inadequacy. The most widely 
accepted theory of foreign exchange rate determination 
is purchasing power parity, yet it has proven to be quite 
poor at forecasting future spot exchange rates. Why?
9.3 Data and the Balance of Payments Approach.
Statistics on a country’s balance of payments are 
often used by the business press and by business it￾self for predicting exchange rates, but the academic 
profession is highly critical of the practice. Why?
9.4 Supply and Demand. Which of the three major the￾oretical approaches seems to put the most weight 
on the supply and demand for currency? What is its 
primary weakness?
9.5 Asset Market Approach to Forecasting. Explain 
how the asset market approach can be used to 
forecast spot exchange rates. How does the asset 
market approach differ from the balance of pay￾ments approach (listed in Exhibit 9.1 and detailed in 
Chapter 3) to forecasting?
9.6 Traders versus Investors. How do you distinguish 
between traders and investors?

M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 304 08/05/23 9:26 AMCHAPTER 9 Foreign Exchange Rate Determination and Intervention 305
9.7 Financial Analysis. What is the difference between 
technical and fundamental analysis?
9.8 Intervention Motivation. Why do governments and 
central banks intervene in the foreign exchange 
markets? If markets are efficient, why not let them 
determine the value of a currency?
9.9 Direct Intervention Usefulness. When is direct in￾tervention likely to be the most successful? And 
when is it likely to be the least successful?
9.10 Capital inflow volatility. Can governments dampen 
capital inflow volatility in emerging nations?
9.11 Capital Controls. Are capital controls really a 
method of currency market intervention or more of 
a denial of activity? How does this fit with the con￾cept of the impossible trinity discussed previously in 
Chapters 2 and 6?
9.12 Asian Crisis of 1997 and Disequilibrium. What was 
the primary disequilibrium at work in Asia in 1997 
that likely caused the Asian financial crisis? Do you 
think it could have been avoided?
9.13 Motivations for Currency Market Intervention.
Why and when do central banks intervene in cur￾rency markets?
9.14 Currency Crises. Compare and contrast the currency 
crises of Russia in 1998 and Argentina in 2002.
9.15 Term Forecasting. What are the major differences 
between short-term and long-term forecasts for a 
fixed exchange rate versus a floating exchange rate?
9.16 Inflationary nations. Why are most export prices 
in inflationary nations quoted in terms of stable 
currencies?
9.17 Speculation and Financial Crises. Excessive cur￾rency speculation has been named among the fac￾tors blamed for the onset of financial crises. Give 
three examples where rampant speculation has 
given birth to financial crises. What other factors are 
also blamed for these crises?
9.18 Cross-Rate Consistency in Forecasting. Explain the 
meaning of cross-rate consistency as used by MNEs. 
How do MNEs use a check of cross-rate consistency 
in practice?
9.19 Stabilizing versus Destabilizing Expectations.
Define stabilizing and destabilizing expectations, 
and describe how they play a role in the long-term 
determination of exchange rates.
9.20 Currency Forecasting Services. MNEs with multiple 
foreign subsidiaries depend on currency forecasting 
to plan future expansion and contraction of their 
operations. What are the criteria that analysts use to 
forecast future exchange rates?
Problems
9.1 Naira’s Nightmare. On Friday, June 17, 2016, the 
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) abandoned the 
Nigerian naira’s (NGN or N) fixed exchange rate 
and allowed the currency to float. Previously fixed 
against the U.S. dollar at NGN196.50 = USD1.00, the 
naira closed at NGN 279.50 = USD1.00 on Monday, 
June 20, the first day of trading following the float. 
The naira quickly floated (sunk) to NGN 324.50 
by August 18. Similarly, the naira fell from NGN 
221.2001 = EUR1.00 to NGN 316.7294 = EUR1.00 
on June 20 and NGN 347.7721 on August 18.
a. What was the percentage change in the value 
of the Nigerian naira versus the dollar the first 
trading day?
b. What was the percentage change in the value 
of the naira versus the dollar by August 18, 2016?
c. What was the percentage change in the value of the 
Nigerian naira versus the euro the first trading day?
d. What was the percentage change in the value 
of the naira versus the euro by August 18, 2016?
9.2 Turkey Weakened. The Turkish lira (TRY) weak￾ened, due to an unconventional monetary policy, 
from TRY11.68 = EUR1.00 to TRY14.41 = EUR1.00 
on November 22, 2021. What was the percentage 
devaluation of the lira?
9.3 Yen Devaluation. The value of the Japanese Yen 
(JPY) was JPY 125.5 to EUR 1.00 on Friday, 
March 4, 2022. It then plunged in value to JPY136 to 
EUR1.00 on Monday, March 28, 2022. What was the 
percentage change in its value?
9.4 Ecuadorian Sucre. The Ecuadorian sucre (S) suf￾fered from hyperinflationary forces throughout 1999. 
Its value moved from S5,000 = $1.00 to S25,000 =
$1.00. What was the percentage change in its value?
9.5 Zimbabwean Anguish. As illustrated in the graph 
(on the next page), the Zimbabwe dollar moved from 
its fixed exchange rate of ZWD 460.52 = EUR1.00 to 
ZWD 515.49 = EUR1.00 in a span of three months 
in 2010. After a brief period of high volatility, the 
Zimbabwean dollar appeared to settle down into a 
range varying from 501 to 515 Zimbabwean dollars 
per euro. If you were forecasting the Zimbabwean 
dollar further into the future, to December 5, 2010, 
how would you use the information in the graphic—
the value of the Zimbabwean dollar freely floating 
in the weeks following devaluation—to forecast its 
future value?
9.6 Canadian Dollar/USD Dollar. The Canadian dol￾lar’s value against the U.S. dollar has seen some sig￾nificant changes over recent history. Use the graph 
of the C$ to US$ exchange rate on the next page 
M09_EITE5960_16_GE_C09.indd 305 08/05/23 9:26 AM306 PART 2 Foreign Exchange Theory and Markets
for the 30-year period between 1980 and end-of￾year 2010 to estimate the percentage change in the 
Canadian dollar’s value (affectionately known as the 
“loonie”) versus the dollar for the following periods.
a. January 1980–January 1986
b. January 1986–October 1991
c. October 1991–December 2001
d. October 2001–April 2011
e. April 2011–January 2015
9.7 Istanbul’s Issues. The Turkish lira (TL) was officially 
devalued by the Turkish government in February 
2001 during a severe political and economic crisis. 
The Turkish government announced on February 21 
that the lira would be devalued by 20%. The spot 
exchange rate on February 20 was TL68,000 = $1.00.
a. What was the exchange rate after devaluation?
b. What was percentage change after falling to 
TL100,000 = $1.00?

Problem 9.5
Russo-Swiss Cross—2015
Switzerland has long served as a cornerstone of banking conservatism and a safe port in a world of currency storms. 
Swiss banks have long been used by investors from all over the world as financially secure institutions that would pre￾serve depositors’ wealth with confidentiality. A large part of the security offered is the Swiss franc itself. Russian citizens 
of wealth have used Swiss banks heavily in recent years as a place where they can shelter their capital from politics, both 
inside Russia and the outside (EU and U.S.) world. But beginning in the fall of 2014, the Russian ruble’s value began to 
slide against the Swiss franc, threatening their wealth.

Peso-Dollar Cross—1995
Use the following exhibit to answer Problems 9.8–9.10.
9.8 Conchita’s Dilemma. Conchita Marquez is a famous 
Mexican entrepreneur with a multi-million-dollar 
business dealing in copper. In 1994, she decided to 
take up residence in Switzerland as part of her long￾term retirement plans, which included transferring 
all her wealth. In November 1994, Conchita held a 
portfolio of USD 450 million and CHF 200 million 
in Swiss banks, in addition to accounts in Mexico 
holding MXN 950 million. Using the exchange rate 
table, answer the following:
a. What is the value of Conchita’s portfolio as 
measured in Mexican pesos?
b. What is the value of Conchita’s portfolio as mea￾sured in Swiss francs?
c. What is the value of Conchita’s portfolio as 
measured in U.S. dollars?
d. Which currency demonstrated the greatest fluc￾tuation in total value over the six dates?
9.9 La Conquista—The Mexican Dance. Calculate the 
percentage change in the value of the peso for the 
three different cross-rates shown in the table for the 
six dates. Did the peso fall further against the U.S. 
dollar or the Swiss franc?
9.10 BP and Mexicana Oil 1995. BP (the United Kingdom) 
and Mexicana Oil (Mexico) severed a long-term 
joint venture in 1993, with Mexicana buying out BP 
with $75 billion in cash and a 30% interest (equity 
interest) in Mexicana itself. Mexicana financed a 
large part of the buyout by borrowing heavily. The 
following year, November 1994, BP received a divi￾dend on its ownership interest in Mexicana of MXN 
30 billion. But Mexicana’s performance had been 
declining, as was the Mexican peso. The winter of 
1994–1995 in Europe was a relatively mild one and 
Europe’s purchases of Mexicana’s oil output had 
fallen, as had the price of oil. Mexicana’s total sales 
were down, and the peso had clearly fallen dramati￾cally (see previous table). And to add debt to injury, 
Mexicana was due to make a payment of USD22.5 
billion in 1995 on its debt from the BP buyout.

January 1995, and the spot rate at that time was 
MXN6.30 = USD1.00, what would BP receive in 
U.S. dollars?
c. If the combination of Western trade tariffs 
against Mexico and lower oil prices truly sent the 
Mexican economy into recession, and the spot 
rate was MXN7.50 = USD1.00 in November 1995,

M10A_EITE5960_16_GE_P03.indd 311 02/05/23 5:21 PMLEARNING OBJECTIVES
10.1 Examine the three major foreign exchange exposures experienced by firms
10.2 Explore why firms hedge foreign exchange exposure
10.3 Examine how transaction exposure is defined and measured
10.4 Describe how one company may hedge its transaction exposures
10.5 Detail how foreign exchange risk management is conducted by firms today
Foreign exchange exposure is a measure of the potential for a firm’s profitability, net cash 
flow, and market value to change because of a change in exchange rates. An important task 
of the financial manager is to measure foreign exchange exposure and to manage it so as to 
maximize the profitability, net cash flow, and market value of the firm. This chapter provides 
an in-depth discussion of transaction exposure, the exposure that generally receives the most 
attention by corporate financial management. The following chapters focus on translation 
exposure (Chapter 11) and operating exposure (Chapter 12). The chapter concludes with the

10.1 Types of Foreign Exchange Exposure
What happens to a firm when foreign exchange rates change? There are two distinct cat￾egories of foreign exchange exposure for the firm: those that are based in accounting and 
those that arise from economic competitiveness. Accounting exposures, specifically de￾scribed as transaction exposure and translation exposure, arise from contracts and accounts 
being denominated in foreign currency. The economic exposure, which we will describe as 
operating exposure, is the potential change in the value of the firm from its changing global 
competitiveness as determined by exchange rates.
Exhibit 10.1 shows schematically the three main types of foreign exchange exposure: 
transaction, translation, and operating:
■ Transaction exposure measures changes in the value of contractual obligations incurred 
between the time in which they are created and booked, and when they are settled due 
to a change in exchange rates. Thus, it deals with changes in expected cash flows resulting 
from existing contractual obligations, so-called on balance sheet obligations.
Transaction Exposure
There are two times in a man’s life when he should not speculate: when he can’t 
afford it and when he can.

M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 312 03/05/23 2:56 PMCHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 313
■ Translation exposure is the potential for accounting-derived changes in owner’s equity or 
consolidated income to occur because of the need to “translate” foreign currency financial 
statements of foreign subsidiaries into a single reporting currency to prepare worldwide 
consolidated financial statements.
■ Operating exposure—also commonly called economic exposure or competitive expo￾sure—measures the change in the present value of the firm resulting from any change 
in future operating cash flows of the firm caused by an unexpected change in exchange 
rates. The change in value depends on the effect of the exchange rate change on future 
sales volume, prices, and costs.
Transaction exposure and operating exposure both exist because of unexpected changes 
in future cash flows. However, while transaction exposure is concerned with future cash flows 
already contracted for, operating exposure focuses on expected (not yet contracted for) fu￾ture cash flows that might change because a change in exchange rates has altered interna￾tional competitiveness.
The three foreign exposures impact the financial statements of the multinational firm in 
very different ways. Transaction exposures, as noted in Exhibit 10.1, are realized—they may 
increase or decrease the cash flows of the firm (impacting the statement of cash flows) and 
its reported profitability (impacting the income statement). Translation exposure, the second 
accounting-based foreign exchange exposure, may impact the firm’s reported consolidated 
income and equity. This impact, however, is purely accounting in nature and does not alter 
the firm’s cash flows. The third and final foreign exchange exposure, operating exposure, rep￾resents risks to the firm’s future sales, costs, earnings, cash flows, and asset values, all of which 
are beyond the current operating period. They may indeed impact the future of the firm—
and its financial results—but not in the current period.
Transaction Exposure
Changes in the recorded value of
identifiable transactions of the firm like
receivables and payables. Results in
realized foreign exchange gains and
losses in income and taxes.
Economic/Operating Exposure
Changes in the expected future cash flows
of the firm from unexpected changes in exchange
rates. The firm’s future cash flows are
changed from realized changes in its own
sales, earnings, and cash flows, as well as changes
in competitor responses to exchange rates over time.
Translation Exposure
Changes in the periodic consolidated value of the firm; results in no change in cash flow or
global tax liabilities—unrealized—changes only the consolidated financial results
reported to the market (if publicly traded). Often labeled Accounting Exposure.

EXHIBIT 10.1 The Foreign Exchange Exposures of the Firm
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 313 03/05/23 2:56 PM314 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
10.2 Why Hedge?
Multinational firms, as first described in Chapter 1, consist of a multitude of cash flows that 
are sensitive to changes in exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. This chapter 
focuses on how the MNE’s outstanding obligations, many of which are contractual in nature, 
are altered by changes in exchange rates. We begin by exploring the question of whether ex￾change rate risk should or should not be managed.
Hedging Defined
Many firms attempt to manage their foreign exchange exposure through hedging. Hedging 
requires a firm to take a position—an asset, a contract, or a derivative—the value of which 
will rise or fall in a manner that counters the fall or rise in value of an existing position—the 
exposure. Hedging protects the owner of the existing asset from loss. However, it also elimi￾nates any gain from an increase in the value of the asset hedged. The question remains: What 
is to be gained by the firm from hedging?
According to financial theory, the value of a firm is the net present value of all expected 
future cash flows. The fact that these cash flows are expected emphasizes that nothing about the 
future is certain. If the reporting currency value of many of these cash flows is altered by exchange 
rate changes, a firm that hedges its foreign exchange exposures reduces the variance in the value 
of its future expected cash flows. The foreign exchange exposure of the firm can then be defined as 
the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected changes in exchange rates.
Exhibit 10.2 illustrates the distribution of expected net cash flows of the individual firm. 
Hedging these cash flows narrows the distribution of the cash flows about the mean of the 
distribution. Currency hedging reduces risk. Reduction of risk is not, however, the same as 
Hedging reduces the variability of expected cash flows about the mean of the distribution. This reduction of distribution 
variance is a reduction of risk. An added question is whether the mean of the two distributions is the same. If hedging “costs,”
the distribution of the hedged distribution may shift slightly to the left of the mean of the unhedged distribution.

EXHIBIT 10.2 Hedging’s Impact on the Expected Cash Flows of the Firm
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 314 03/05/23 2:56 PMCHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 315
adding value or return. The value of the firm depicted in Exhibit 10.2 would be increased only 
if hedging actually shifted the mean of the distribution to the right. In fact, if hedging is not 
“free,” meaning the firm must expend resources to hedge, then hedging will add value only if 
the rightward shift is sufficiently large to compensate for the cost of hedging.
The Pros and Cons of Hedging
Is a reduction in the variability of cash flows sufficient reason for currency risk management?
Pros. Proponents of hedging cite the following arguments:
■ Reduction in risk of future cash flows improves the planning capability of the firm. 
If the firm can more accurately predict future cash flows, it may be able to undertake 
specific investments or activities that it might not otherwise consider.
■ Reduction of risk in future cash flows reduces the likelihood that the firm’s cash flows 
will fall below a level sufficient to make debt service payments required for continued 
operation. This minimum level of cash flows, often referred to as the point of financial 
distress, lies to the left of the center of the distribution of expected cash flows. Hedging 
reduces the likelihood that the firm’s cash flows will fall to this level.
■ Management has a comparative advantage over the individual shareholder in knowing 
the actual currency risk of the firm. Regardless of the level of disclosure provided by 
the firm to the public, management always possesses an advantage in the depth and 
breadth of knowledge concerning the real risks.
■ Markets are usually in disequilibrium because of structural and institutional imperfec￾tions, as well as unexpected external shocks (such as an oil crisis or war). Management 
is in a better position than shareholders to recognize disequilibrium conditions and 
to take advantage of single opportunities to enhance firm’s value through selective 
hedging—hedging only exceptional exposures or the occasional use of hedging when 
management has a definite expectation of the direction of exchange rates.
Cons. Opponents of hedging commonly make the following arguments:
■ Shareholders are more capable of diversifying currency risk than is the management 
of the firm. If stockholders do not wish to accept the currency risk of any specific firm, 
they can diversify their portfolios to manage the risk in a way that satisfies their indi￾vidual preferences and risk tolerance.
■ Currency hedging does not increase the expected cash flows of the firm. Currency risk 
management does, however, consume firm resources and so reduces cash flow. The 
impact on value is a combination of the reduction of cash flow (which lowers value) 
and the reduction in variance (which increases value).
■ Management often conducts hedging activities that benefit management at the ex￾pense of the shareholders. The field of finance called agency theory frequently argues 
that management is generally more risk-averse than are shareholders.
■ Managers cannot outguess the market. If and when markets are in equilibrium with 
respect to parity conditions, the expected net present value of hedging should be zero.
■ Management’s motivation to reduce variability is sometimes for accounting reasons. 
Management may believe that it will be criticized more severely for incurring for￾eign exchange losses than for incurring even higher cash costs by hedging. Foreign 
exchange losses appear in the income statement as a highly visible separate line item 
or as a footnote, but the higher costs of protection through hedging are buried in op￾erating or interest expenses.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 315 03/05/23 2:56 PM316 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
■ Efficient market theorists believe that investors can see through the “accounting veil” 
and therefore have already factored the foreign exchange effect into a firm’s market 
valuation. Hedging would only add cost.
Every individual firm in the end decides whether it wishes to hedge, for what purpose, 
and how. But as illustrated by Global Finance in Practice 10.1, this often results in even more 
questions and more doubts.
10.3 Transaction Exposure
Transaction exposure measures gains or losses that arise from the settlement of existing 
financial obligations whose terms are stated in a foreign currency. Industry refers to most 
of these types of exposures as balance sheet exposures. The types of transaction exposure 
experienced by a multinational firm arise from a variety of business activities:
■ Purchasing or selling goods or services when prices and settlement are stated in 
foreign currencies
■ Borrowing or lending funds when repayment is to be made in a foreign currency
■ Acquiring assets or incurring liabilities of any kind denominated in a foreign currency
Purchasing and Selling
The most common example of transaction exposure arises when a firm makes a sale and 
receives a promise of payment from the buyer (a receivable) or purchases an input and prom￾ises to pay in the future (a payable), and that transaction is denominated in a foreign cur￾rency. (Technically speaking, these types of sales or purchases are referred to as a sale on open 
account or a purchase on open account because goods are shipped and delivered before pay￾ment is due.) Exhibit 10.3 demonstrates how a sale by a firm creates a receivable exposure, 
how that exposure evolves over its life span, and how it can be decomposed into its compo￾nent exposures—quotation, backlog, and billing.
A transaction exposure is theoretically created at the first moment the seller quotes a 
price in foreign currency terms to a potential buyer, at time t1. The quote can be either verbal, 
as in a telephone quote, or as a written bid or a printed price list. This is quotation exposure. 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 10.1 
The company has borrowed both in U.S. dollar and in 
euro denominated bonds and debentures. A major part of 
their revenue is in these two currencies and repaying their 
loans in the same currencies will reduce their forex risk sig￾nificantly. However, corporates like Samsung also use deriva￾tives to hedge their currency risk.
Hedges that earn money continues to pose difficulty 
for regulators, auditors, and investors worldwide. Samsung 
earned $7.5 billion of financial income in 2021, which is 
more than 20% of their annual profit. This begs the ques￾tion whether Samsung is an electronics company or also 
a financial intermediary that is hedging and speculating on 
exchange rate movements.
Hedging and the Samsung Group
A multinational company operating across a range of cur￾rency zones need to hedge against the foreign exchange 
risk. South Korean company Samsung is one of the world’s 
largest producers of electronic products. One of Samsung’s 
strategies to hedge their foreign exchange exposure is called 
a ‘Currency Cocktail.’ This strategy tries to create liabilities 
in the same currencies as their cash inflow is composed of. 
This reduces the need to convert one currency into other to 
pay off their loans or other liabilities. One such example is the 
debentures (a type of long-term bond secured against as￾sets) issued by Samsung Electronics per their 2021 financial 
statements.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 316 03/05/23 2:56 PMCHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 317
When the order is placed at time t2, the potential exposure created at the time of the quota￾tion is converted into an actual exposure. This is called backlog exposure because the product 
has been contracted for but not yet shipped or delivered. Backlog exposure lasts until the 
goods are shipped and billed at t3, at which time it becomes billing exposure, which persists 
until payment is received by the seller at time t4.
Many firms, however, do not recognize the creation of the exposure as a transaction ex￾posure until time t3. This is because many different business and contractual changes often 
occur during the quotation period, including contract cancellation, and the seller still has 
control over the product.
Suppose that Aidan Corporation, an Irish firm, sells merchandise on open account to 
a Icelandic buyer for Íkr10,000,000, Icelandic króna, with payment to be made in 60 days. 
The spot exchange rate on the date of the sale is Íkr136.28 = €1.00, and the seller expects to 
exchange the Icelandic króna for Íkr10,000,000,Íkr136.28 = €73,378.34 when payment is 
received. The €73,378.34 is the value of the sale that is posted to the firm’s books. Accounting 
practices stipulate that the foreign currency transaction be listed at the spot exchange rate in 
effect on the date of the transaction.
Transaction exposure arises because of the risk that Aidan will receive something 
other than the €73,378.34 expected and booked. For example, if the Icelandic króna 
weakens to Íkr145.00 = €1.00 when payment is received, the Irish seller will receive only 
Íkr10,000,000 , Íkr145.00 or €68,965.52 some €4,412.82 less than what was expected at the 
time of sale.
Transaction settlement: Íkr10,000,000 ÷ Íkr145.00 = €1.00 = €68,965.52
Transaction booked: Íkr10,000,000 , Íkr136.28 = €1.00 = €73,378.34
Foreign exchange gain (loss) on sale = (€4,412.82)
If the Icelandic króna should strengthen to Íkr130.00 = €1.00, however, Aidan receives 
€76,923.08, an increase of €3,544.74 over the amount expected. Thus, Aidan’s exposure is the 
chance of either a loss or a gain on the resulting euro settlement versus the amount at which the 
sale was booked.
This U.S. seller might have avoided transaction exposure by invoicing the Belgian buyer in 
dollars. Of course, if the U.S. firm attempted to sell only in dollars, it might not have obtained

the sale in the first place. Even if the Belgian buyer agrees to pay in dollars, transaction expo￾sure is not eliminated. Instead, the exposure is transferred to the Belgian buyer, whose dollar 
account payable has an unknown cost 60 days in the future.
Borrowing and Lending
A second form of transaction exposure arises when funds are borrowed or loaned, and the 
amount involved is denominated in a foreign currency. For example, in 1994, PepsiCo’s largest 
bottler outside the United States was the Mexican company, Grupo Embotellador de Mexico 
(Gemex). In mid-December 1994, Gemex had U.S. dollar debt of $264million. At that time, 
Mexico’s new peso (“Ps”) was traded at Ps3.45 = $1.00, a pegged rate that had been main￾tained with minor variations since January 1, 1993, when the new currency unit had been cre￾ated. On December 22, 1994, the peso was allowed to float because of economic and political 
events within Mexico, and in one day it sank to Ps4.65 = $1.00. For most of the following 
January it traded in a range near Ps5.50 = $1.00.
Dollar debt in mid-December 1994: $264,000,000 * Ps3.45 = $1.00 = Ps910,800,000
Dollar debt in mid-January 1995: $264,000,000 * Ps5.50 = $1.00 = Ps1,452,000,000
Dollar debt increase measured in Mexican pesos = Ps541,200,000
The number of pesos needed to repay the dollar debt increased by 59%! In U.S. dollar 
terms, the drop in the value of the peso meant that Gemex needed the peso-equivalent of an 
additional $98,400,000 to repay its debt.
Other Causes of Transaction Exposure
When a firm enters into a forward exchange contract, it is deliberately creating a transac￾tion exposure. This risk is usually incurred to hedge an existing transaction exposure. For 
example, a U.S. firm might want to offset an existing obligation to purchase ¥100 million to 
pay for an import from Japan in 90 days. One way to offset this payment is to purchase ¥100
million in the forward market today for delivery in 90 days. In this manner any change in 
value of the Japanese yen relative to the dollar is neutralized. Thus, the potential transac￾tion loss (or gain) on the account payable is offset by the transaction gain (or loss) on the 
forward contract. But regardless of whether the firm actually does make its yen payment 
in 90 days, the firm is obligated, by contract with its forward exchange contract provider 
(typically a bank), to settle the forward exchange contract. The contract is therefore itself a 
transaction exposure.
10.4 Transaction Exposure Management
Foreign exchange transaction exposure can be managed by contractual hedges or operating 
hedges. Contractual hedges, also called financial hedges, employ forward, money, futures, and 
options markets. Operating hedges utilize operating cash flows—cash flows originating from 
the operating activities of the firm—and include risk-sharing agreements and payments strat￾egies using leads and lags. Financial hedges utilize financing cash flows—cash flows originat￾ing from the financing activities of the firm—and include specific types of debt and foreign 
currency derivatives, such as swaps. Operating and financing hedges are described in greater 
detail in Chapter 12.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 318 03/05/23 2:56 PMCHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 319
 The term natural hedge refers to an offsetting operating cash flow, a payable arising from 
the conduct of business. A financial hedge refers to either an offsetting debt obligation (such 
as a loan) or some type of financial derivative such as an interest rate swap. Care should be 
taken to distinguish hedges in the same way finance distinguishes cash flows, operating from 
financing. The following case illustrates how contractual hedging techniques may be used to 
protect against transaction exposure. 
 Aidan’s Transaction Exposure 
 Terry McDermott is the chief financial officer of Aidan. She has just concluded negotiations 
for the sale of a turbine generator to Regency, a British firm, for £1,000,000. This single sale 
is quite large in relation to Aidan’s present business. Aidan has no other current foreign cus￾tomers, so the currency risk of this sale is of particular concern. The sale is made in March 
with payment due three months later in June. Exhibit 10. 4 summarizes the financial and mar￾ket information Terry has collected for the analysis of her currency exposure problem. The 
unknown—the transaction exposure—is the actual realized value of the receivable in euros 
at the end of 90 days. 
 Aidan operates on relatively narrow margins. Although Terry and Aidan would be 
very happy if the pound appreciated versus the euro, concerns center on the possibility that 
the pound will fall. Because this deal was deemed desirable both for financial and strate￾gic reasons, Aidan priced and budgeted this contract with a very slim minimum acceptable 
margin at a sales price of €1,090,000. The budget rate, the lowest acceptable euro per pound 
exchange rate, was therefore established at €1.09 = £1.00. Any exchange rate below this bud￾get rate would result in Aidan realizing no profit on the deal. 
 Four alternatives are available to Aidan to manage this transaction exposure: (1) re -
main unhedged, (2) hedge in the forward market, (3) hedge in the money market, or 
(4) hedge in the options market. 
Aidan weighted average cost of capital = 12.00% (3.00% for 90 days)

M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 319 03/05/23 2:56 PM320 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
Unhedged Position
Terry may decide to accept the transaction risk. If she believes the foreign exchange advi￾sor, she expects to receive £1,000,000 * €1.085 = €1,085,000 in three months. However, 
that amount is at risk. If the pound should fall to, say, €1.065 = £1.00, she will receive only 
€1,065,000. Exchange risk is not one-sided, however; if the transaction is left uncovered and 
the pound strengthens even more than forecast, Aidan will receive considerably more than 
€1,085,000.
The essence of an unhedged approach is as follows:
Today
Do nothing.
Three months from today
Receive £1,000,000.
Sell £1,000,000 spot and receive
dollars at that day’s spot rate.
Forward Hedge
A forward hedge involves a forward (or futures) contract and a source of funds to fulfill that 
contract. The forward contract is entered into at the time the transaction exposure is created. 
In Aidan’s case, that would be in March, when the sale to Regency was booked as an account 
receivable.
When a foreign currency denominated sale such as this is made, it is booked at the spot 
rate of exchange existing on the booking date. In this case, the spot rate on the date of sale 
was €1.09 = £1.00, so the receivable was booked as $1,764,000. Funds to fulfill the forward 
contract will be available in June, when Regency pays £1,000,000 to Aidan. If funds to fulfill 
the forward contract are on hand or are due because of a business operation, the hedge is 
considered covered, perfect, or square because no residual foreign exchange risk exists. Funds 
on hand or to be received are matched by funds to be paid.
In some situations, funds to fulfill the forward exchange contract are not already avail￾able or due to be received later but must be purchased in the spot market at some future date. 
Such a hedge is open or uncovered. It involves considerable risk because the hedger must 
take a chance on purchasing foreign exchange at an uncertain future spot rate in order to 
fulfill the forward contract. Purchase of such funds at a later date is referred to as covering.
Should Aidan wish to hedge its transaction exposure with a forward, it will sell 
£1,000,000 forward today at the three-month forward rate of €1.0760 = £1.00. This is a 
covered transaction in which the firm no longer has any foreign exchange risk. In three months 
the firm will receive £1,000,000 from the British buyer, deliver that sum to the bank against 
its forward sale, and receive €1,076,000. This would be recorded on Aidan’s income statement 
as a foreign exchange loss of €14,000 (€1,090,000 as booked, €1,076,000 as settled).
The essence of a forward hedge is as follows:
Today
Sell £1,000,000.
forward @ €1.0760 = £1.00.
Three months from today
Receive £1,000,000.
Deliver £1,000,000 against forward sale.
Receive €1,076,000.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 320 03/05/23 2:56 PMCHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 321
If Terry’s forecast of future rates was identical to that implicit in the forward quotation, 
that is, €1.076 = £1.00, then expected receipts would be the same whether or not the firm 
hedges. However, realized receipts under the unhedged alternative could vary considerably 
from the certain receipts when the transaction is hedged. Never underestimate the value of 
predictability of outcomes (and 90 nights of sound sleep).
Money Market Hedge (Balance Sheet Hedge)
Like a forward market hedge, a money market hedge (also commonly called a balance sheet 
hedge) also involves a contract and a source of funds to fulfill that contract. In this instance, 
the contract is a loan agreement. The firm seeking to construct a money market hedge bor￾rows in one currency and exchanges the proceeds for another currency. Funds to fulfill the 
contract, to repay the loan, are generated from business operations. In this case, the account 
receivable generates the funds to repay the loan.
A money market hedge can cover a single transaction, such as Aidan’s £1,000,000
receivable, or repeated transactions. Hedging repeated transactions is called matching. It 
requires the firm to match the expected foreign currency cash inflows and outflows by cur￾rency and maturity. For example, if Aidan had numerous sales denominated in pounds to 
British customers over a long period of time, then it would have somewhat predictable UK 
pound cash inflows. The appropriate money market hedge technique in that case would be to 
borrow UK pounds in an amount matching the typical size and maturity of expected pound 
inflows. Then, if the pound depreciated or appreciated, the foreign exchange effect on cash 
inflows in pounds would be offset by the effect on cash outflows in pounds from repaying the 
pound loan plus interest.
The structure of a money market hedge resembles that of a forward hedge. The differ￾ence is that the cost of the money market hedge is determined by different interest rates 
than the interest rates used in the formation of the forward rate. The difference in interest 
rates facing a private firm borrowing in two separate country markets may be different from 
the difference in risk-free government bill rates or eurocurrency interest rates in these same 
markets. In efficient markets interest rate parity should ensure that these costs are nearly the 
same, but not all markets are efficient at all times.
To hedge in the money market, Terry will borrow pounds in London at once, immediately 
convert the borrowed pounds into euros, and repay the pound loan in three months with the 
proceeds from the sale of the generator. She will need to borrow just enough to repay both 
the principal and interest with the sale proceeds. The borrowing interest rate will be 10% per 
annum, or 2.5% for three months. Therefore, the amount to borrow now for repayment in 
three months is £975,610:
£1,000,000
1 + 0.025 = £975,610
Terry would borrow £975,610 now and in three months repay that amount plus £24,390
of interest with the account receivable. Aidan would exchange the £975,610 loan proceeds for 
dollars at the current spot exchange rate of €1.09 = £1.00, receiving €1,063,415 at once.
The money market hedge, if selected by Aidan, creates a pound-denominated liability—
the pound loan—to offset the pound-denominated asset—the account receivable. The money 
market hedge works as a hedge by matching assets and liabilities according to their cur￾rency of denomination. Using a simple T-account illustrating Aidan’s balance sheet, the loan 
in British pounds is seen to offset the pound-denominated account receivable:

Assets Liabilities & Net Worth
Account receivable £1,000,000 Bank loan (principal) £975,610
             Interest payable 24,390
£1,000,000 £1,000,000
The loan acts as a balance sheet hedge against the pound-denominated account receivable 
and is based on a money market loan (90-day loan).
Forward and Money Market Hedges Compared
To compare the forward hedge with the money market hedge, one must analyze how Aidan’s 
loan proceeds will be utilized for the next three months. Remember that the loan proceeds 
are received today, but the forward contract proceeds are received in three months. For com￾parison purposes, one must calculate either the future value of the loan proceeds or the pres￾ent value of the forward contract proceeds. Since the primary uncertainty here is the dollar 
value in three months, we will use future value in this case.
As both the forward contract proceeds and the loan proceeds are relatively certain, it is 
possible to make a clear choice between the two alternatives based on the one that yields the 
higher dollar receipts. This result, in turn, depends on the assumed rate of investment or use 
of the loan proceeds.
At least three logical choices exist for an assumed investment rate for the loan proceeds 
for the next three months. First, if Aidan is cash rich, the loan proceeds might be invested in 
euro money market instruments that yield 6% per annum. Second, Terry might simply use 
the pound loan proceeds to pay down euro loans that currently cost Aidan 8% per annum. 
Third, Terry might invest the loan proceeds in the general operations of the firm, in which 
case the cost of capital of 12% per annum would be the appropriate rate. The field of finance 
generally uses the company’s cost of capital (the weighted average cost of capital or WACC) 
to move capital forward and backward in time. We will therefore use the WACC of 12% (3% 
for the 90-day period here) to calculate the future value of proceeds under the money market 
hedge:
€1,063,415 * 1.03 = €1,095,317
A break-even rate can now be calculated between the forward hedge and the money 
market hedge. Assume that r is the unknown 3-month investment rate (expressed as a deci￾mal) that would equalize the proceeds from the forward and money market hedges. We have:
(Loan proceeds) * (1 + rate) = (forward proceeds)
€1,063,415 * (1 + rate) = €1,073,000
rate = 0.00901
We now convert this three-month (90 days) investment rate to an annual whole percentage 
equivalent, assuming a 360-day financial year, as follows:
0.00901 *
360
90
* 100 = 3.61%
In other words, if Terry McDermott can invest the loan proceeds at a rate higher than 3.61% 
per annum, she would prefer the money market hedge. If she can only invest at a rate lower 
than 3.61%, she would prefer the forward hedge.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 322 03/05/23 2:56 PMCHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 323
The essence of a money market hedge is as follows:
Today
Borrow £975,610.
Exchange £975,610 for
 dollars @ €1.09 = £1.00.
Receive €1,063,415 cash. 
Three months from today
Receive £1,000,000.
Repay £975,610 loan plus £24,390
interest, for a total of £1,000,000. 
The money market hedge therefore results in cash received up-front (at the start of the 
period), which can then be carried forward in time for comparison with the other hedging 
alternatives.
Options Market Hedge
Terry McDermott could also cover her £1,000,000 exposure by purchasing a put option. This 
technique, an option hedge, allows her to speculate on the upside potential for appreciation of 
the pound while limiting downside risk to a known amount. Maria could purchase from her bank 
a 3-month put option on £1,000,000 at an at-the-money (ATM) strike price of €1.07 = £1.00
with a premium cost of 1.50%. The total cost of the option is calculated as follows:
Size of option * premium * spot rate = total cost of option
£1,000,000 * 0.015 * €1.07 = €16,050
Because we are using future value to compare the various hedging alternatives, it is 
necessary to project the premium cost of the option forward three months. We will use the 
cost of capital of 12% per annum or 3% per quarter. Therefore the premium cost of the 
put option as of June would be €16,050 × 1.03 = €16,532. This is equal to €0.0165 per pound 
(€16,532 , £1,000,000).
When the £1,000,000 is received in June, the value in euros depends on the spot rate 
at that time. The upside potential is unlimited, the same as in the unhedged alternative. At 
any exchange rate above €1.07 = £1.00, Aidan would allow its option to expire unexercised 
and would exchange the pounds for euros at the spot rate. If the expected rate of €1.085
materializes, Aidan would exchange the £1,000,000 in the spot market for €1,085,000. Net 
proceeds would be €1,085,000 minus the €16,532 cost of the option, or €1,068,468.
In contrast to the unhedged alternative, downside risk is limited with an option. If 
the pound depreciates below €1.07 = £1.00, Terry would exercise her option to sell (put) 
£1,000,000 at €1.07 = £1.00, receiving €1,070,000 gross, but €1,053,468 net of the €16,532 cost 
of the option. Although this downside result is worse than the downside of either the forward 
or money market hedges, the upside potential is unlimited.
The essence of the at-the-money (ATM) put option market hedge is as follows:
Today
Buy put option to
 sell pounds @ €1.07 = £1.00.
Pay €16,050 for put option.
Three months from today
Receive £1,000,000.
Either deliver £1,000,000 against put,
receiving €1,070,000; or sell £1,000,000
spot if current spot rate is > €1.085 = £1.00.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 323 03/05/23 2:56 PM324 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
We can calculate a trading range for the pound that defines the break-even points for 
the option compared with the other strategies. The upper bound of the range is determined 
by comparison with the forward rate. The pound must appreciate enough above the €1.0760 
forward rate to cover the €0.0165 per £ cost of the option. Therefore, the break-even upside 
spot price of the pound must be €1.0760 + €0.0165 = €1.0925. If the spot pound appreciates 
above €1.0925, proceeds under the option strategy will be greater than under the forward 
hedge. If the spot pound ends up below €1.0925, the forward hedge would have been superior 
in retrospect.
The lower bound of the range is determined by the unhedged strategy. If the spot price 
falls below €1.07 = £1.00, Terry will exercise her put and sell the proceeds at €1.07. The net 
proceeds will be €1.07 less than the €0.0165 cost of the option, or €1.0535 = £1.00. If the spot 
rate falls below €1.0535, the net proceeds from exercising the option will be greater than the 
net proceeds from selling the unhedged pounds in the spot market. At any spot rate above 
€1.0535, the spot proceeds from remaining unhedged will be greater.
Foreign currency options have a variety of hedging uses. A put option is useful to con￾struction firms and exporters when they must submit a fixed price bid in a foreign currency 
without knowing until some later date whether their bid is successful. Similarly, a call option 
is useful to hedge a bid for a foreign firm if a potential future foreign currency payment may 
be required. In either case, if the bid is rejected, the loss is limited to the cost of the option.
Hedging Alternatives Compared
Exhibit 10.5 shows the value of Aidan’s £1,000,000 account receivable over a range of pos￾sible ending spot exchange rates and hedging alternatives. This exhibit makes it clear that the 
firm’s view of likely exchange rate changes aids in the hedging choice as follows:
■ If the exchange rate is expected to move against Aidan, to the left of €1.085 = £1.00, 
the money market hedge is clearly the preferred alternative with a guaranteed value of 
1,063,415.
■ If the exchange rate is expected to move in Aidan’s favor, to the right of €1.085, then 
the preferred alternative is less clear-cut, lying between remaining unhedged, the money 
market hedge, or the put.
Remaining unhedged is most likely an unacceptable choice. If Terry’s expectations re￾garding the future spot rate prove to be wrong, and the spot rate falls below €1.09 = £1.00, 
she will not reach her budget rate. The put option offers a unique alternative. If the exchange 
rate moves in Aidan’s favor, the put option offers nearly the same upside potential as the un￾hedged alternative except for the up-front costs. If, however, the exchange rate moves against 
Aidan, the put option limits the downside risk to €1,053,468.
So how should Terry McDermott choose among the alternative hedging strategies? She 
must select on the basis of two decision criteria: (1) the risk tolerance of Aidan, as expressed 
in its stated policies; and (2) her own view or expectation of the direction and distance the 
exchange rate will move over the coming period.
Aidan’s risk tolerance is a combination of management’s philosophy toward transaction 
exposure and the specific goals of treasury activities. Many firms believe that currency risk 
is simply a part of doing business internationally and, therefore, begin their analysis from an 
unhedged baseline. Other firms, however, view currency risk as unacceptable and either begin 
their analysis from a full forward contract cover baseline or simply mandate that all transac￾tion exposures be fully covered by forward contracts regardless of the value of other hedging 
alternatives. The treasury in most firms operates as a cost or service center for the firm. On the 
other hand, if the treasury operates as a profit center, it might tolerate taking more risk.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 324 03/05/23 2:56 PMCHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 325
The final choice between hedges—if Terry McDermott does expect the pound to appre￾ciate—combines the firm’s risk tolerance, its view, and its confidence in its view. Transaction 
exposure management with contractual hedges requires managerial judgment. Global Fina￾nce in Practice 10.2 describes how hedging choices may also be influenced by profitability 
concerns and forward premiums.

GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 10.2 
If U.S. dollar and British pound interest rates were 2.00% and 
4.00%, respectively, the forward rate would be USD1.5692. 
This is a forward premium of 1.923% (the pound is selling for￾ward at a 1.923% discount versus the dollar), and in this firm’s 
view, the cost of hedging the transaction is then 1.923%.
However, if British pound interest rates were significantly 
higher, say 8.00%, then the one year forward rate would be 
USD1.5111, a forward premium of –5.556%. Some mul￾tinationals see using a forward in this case, in which more 
than 5.5% of the transaction’s settlement is “lost” to hedging 
as too expensive. The definition of “too expensive” must be 
based on the philosophy of the individual firm, its risk toler￾ance for currency risk, and the profitability of the business 
and industry itself. Fundamentals of financial theory, how￾ever, would argue that the two cases are not truly different. 
Yet, in global business today, depending on how pricing is 
conducted, a loss of 5.56% on the sale settlement could de￾stroy much of the net margin on the sale.
Forward Rates and the Cost of Hedging
Some multinational firms measure the cost of hedging as 
the “total cash flow expenses of the hedge” as a percent￾age of the initial booked foreign currency transaction. They 
define the “total cash flow expense of the hedge” as any 
cash expenses for purchase (e.g., option premium paid up￾front, including the time value of money) plus any differ￾ence in the final cash flow settlement versus the booked 
transaction.
If a firm were using forwards, there is no up-front cost, 
so the total cash flow expense is simply the difference be￾tween the forward settlement and the booked transaction 
(using this definition of hedging expense). This is the forward 
premium. But the size of the forward premium has some￾times motivated firms to avoid using forwards.
Assume a U.S.-based firm has a GBP1 million one-year 
receivable. The current spot rate is USD1.6000 = GBP1.00. 
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 325 03/05/23 2:56 PM326 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
Hedging an Account Payable
The management of an account payable, where the firm would be required to make a for￾eign currency payment at a future date, is similar but not identical to the management of an 
account receivable. If Aidan had a £1,000,000 account payable due in 90 days, the hedging 
choices would include the following.
Remain Unhedged. Aidan could wait 90 days, exchange dollars for pounds at that time, 
and make its payment. If Aidan expects the spot rate in 90 days to be €1.085 = £1.00, the 
payment would be expected to cost €1,085,000. This amount is, however, uncertain; the spot 
exchange rate in 90 days could be very different from that expected.
Forward Market Hedge. Aidan could buy £1,000,000 forward, locking in a rate of 
€1.0760 = £1.00 and a total euro cost of €1,076,000. This is €9,000 less than the expected cost 
of remaining unhedged, and therefore clearly preferable to the first alternative.
Money Market Hedge. The money market hedge is distinctly different for a payable as 
opposed to a receivable. To implement a money market hedge in this case, Aidan would ex￾change euro spot and invest them for 90 days in a pound-denominated interest-bearing ac￾count. The principal and interest in British pounds at the end of the 90-day period would be 
used to pay the £1,000,000 account payable.
In order to ensure that the principal and interest exactly equal the £1,000,000 due in 90 
days, Aidan would discount the £1,000,000 by the pound investment interest rate of 8% for 
90 days in order to determine the pounds needed today:
£1,000,000
c 1 + a.08 *
90
360
b d
= £980,392.16
This £980,392.16 needed today would require €1,729,411.77 at the current spot rate of 
€1.7640 = £1.00:
£980,392.16 * €1.09 = €1,068,627.45.
Finally, in order to compare the money market hedge outcome with the other hedging 
alternatives, the €1,068,627.45 cost today must be carried forward 90 days to the same future 
date as the other hedge choices. If the current euro cost is carried forward at Aidan’s WACC 
of 12%, the total cost of the money market hedge is the €1,100,686.27. This is higher than the 
forward hedge and therefore unattractive.
€1,068,627.45 * c 1 + a.12 *
90
360
b d = €1,100,686.27
Option Hedge. Aidan could cover its £1,000,000 account payable by purchasing a call op￾tion on £1,000,000. A June call option on British pounds with a near at-the-money strike price 
of €1.75 = £1.00 would cost 1.5% (premium) or £1,000,000 * 0.015 * €1.07 = €16,050.
This premium, regardless of whether the call option is exercised, will be paid up front. Its 
value, carried forward 90 days at the WACC of 12%, would raise its end of period cost to €16,532. 
If the spot rate in 90 days is less than €1.07 = £1.00, the option would be allowed to expire and 
the £1,000,000 for the payable would be purchased on the spot market. The total cost of the call 
option hedge, if the option is not exercised, is theoretically smaller than any other alternative 
(with the exception of remaining unhedged because the option premium is still paid and lost). 
If the spot rate in 90 days exceeds €1.07 = £1.00, the call option would be exercised.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 326 03/05/23 2:56 PMCHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 327
The total cost of the call option hedge, if exercised, is as follows:
Exercise call option (£1,000,000 * €1.07 = £1.00) = €1,070,000
Call option premium (carried forward 90 days) = 16,532
Total maximum expense of call-hedged payable = €1,086,532
Strategy Choice. The four hedging methods of managing a £1,000,000 account payable for 
Aidan are summarized in Exhibit 10.6. The costs of the forward hedge and money market 
hedge are certain. The cost using the call option hedge is calculated as a maximum, and the 
cost of remaining unhedged is highly uncertain.
As with Aidan’s account receivable, the final hedging choice depends on Terry’s exchange 
rate expectations and her willingness to bear risk. The forward hedge provides the lowest cost 
of making the account payable payment; that is certain. If the euro strengthens against the 
pound, ending up at a spot rate less than €1.07 = £1.00, the call option could potentially be 
the lowest cost hedge. Given an expected spot rate of €1.085 = £1.00, however, the forward 
hedge appears to be the preferred alternative.
10.5 Transaction Exposure Management in Practice
In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.
 —Yogi Berra.
There are as many different approaches to transaction exposure management as there are 
firms. A variety of surveys of corporate risk management practices in recent years in the 
United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, Australia, and Germany indicate no real con￾sensus exists regarding the single best approach. The following is our attempt to summarize

survey findings on which goals, which exposures, and which methods and hedges are most 
frequently used in corporate transaction exposure management.
Which Goals
The treasury function of most private firms, the group typically responsible for transaction 
exposure management, is usually considered a cost center or shared service center. Treasury 
is seldom a profit center; it is not expected to add profit to the firm’s bottom line by taking 
on risk. This is not to say, however, that it is not expected to add value to the firm. Currency 
risk managers are expected to err on the conservative side when managing the firm’s money. 
At the same time most multinationals do not expect their treasury groups to beat the market 
or predict exchange rate movements. What they often hope to do is some combination of 
smoothing financial results, protecting or insuring corporate cash flows (particularly against 
corporate budgets) and gaining increasing predictability over future cash flows.
The single most frequent corporate treasury goal in foreign exchange hedging is to mini￾mize exchange rate-induced volatility in earnings. Investors in publicly traded firms prefer 
predictable and stable earnings and of course seek growth in earnings. If a hedging program 
can “smooth out the bumps” in earnings, then many firms attempt to do just that. This focus 
on earnings, however, is a function of ownership. Surveys of corporate hedging practices reg￾ularly show that publicly traded firms,1
 firms that must regularly report corporate earnings, 
hedge much more frequently and over longer future periods than private firms.2
If earnings smoothing or protection is the goal, that typically forms or determines a time 
horizon for exposure management. Many exposure programs will combine nearly mandatory 
hedging of existing exposures (most frequently within a quarter) but manage a large book of 
exposures and hedges which extend out at least 12 months into the future.
Which Transaction Exposures
Transaction exposure management in practice increasingly combines existing exposures (on 
balance sheet) with anticipated exposures (sometimes termed forecasted transactions, or those 
not yet booked but highly likely in occurrence). What is clearly changing is the willingness of 
more and more firms to actively hedge anticipated exposures.
In the past, many firms prohibited the hedging of any exposures not yet on balance sheet 
as a matter of policy. Their reasoning was straightforward: until the transaction exists on the 
accounting books of the firm, the probability of the exposure actually occurring is considered 
to be less than 100%, while any financial derivative purchased as a hedge would have a 100% 
certainty. Conservative hedging policies dictated that contractual hedges be placed only on 
existing exposures.
There are two types of anticipated exposures which are most frequently hedged by firms: 
contractual exposures and intra-firm transactions. Contractual exposures are those foreign 
currency denominated transactions that occur under a continuing contract. For example, a 
company may ship product to a customer every ninety days, and the two firms are currently 
operating under a three-year contract. Each individual shipment results in an explicit iden￾tifiable transaction exposure (a receivable to one, a payable to the other). Future shipments, 
although they have not yet occurred and are not yet booked, are contractual obligations. 
Although they have not yet been booked, their likelihood of occurrence is very high.
1
 See for example Wells Fargo’s 2020 Risk Management Practices Survey.
2
 Another important distinction between companies actively hedging foreign exchange exposures is company size; 
private firms surveyed are typically much smaller in total revenue than publicly traded firms surveyed. The larger 
the firm, the more likely the firm is to have risk managers in-house with the expertise and devoted resources to for￾eign exchange transaction exposure management.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 328 03/05/23 2:56 PMCHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 329
Intra-firm transactions, trade between units of the same company (either between sub￾sidiaries or between a subsidiary and the parent company), also generate anticipated expo￾sures. Although data is sparse in this sector, it has been estimated that more than 80% of all 
international commercial transactions off the West Coast of the U.S. is between units of the 
same companies, not between different companies—for example, shipments of components 
between Toyota of Japan and its U.S. subsidiary. The growth of global supply chains and inte￾grated corporate planning has made these intra-company shipments a very predictable and 
stable activity, but one that inevitably results in the creation of a currency exposure for one or 
the other operating unit. Hedging of these exposures is for some firms now becoming routine. 
Global Finance in Practice 10.3 examines intra-company hedging in more depth.
What Levels of Exposure Cover
Many multinationals follow rather rigid transaction exposure hedging policies which man￾date proportional hedging (what proportion or percentage of the exposure is hedged) of col￾lected exposures. This requires the identification of exposures by currency, maturity, and then 
selective hedging by cover percentage and hedging instrument.
For example, a U.S.-based business may accumulate all short and long positions against 
the Japanese yen arising over a one-week period. The net positions are then grouped by ma￾turities (e.g., less than 30 days, 30 to 90 days, more than 90 days). The company will then, 
weekly, hedge this net exposure position by maturity given market conditions, expectations, 
and any company specific attitudes toward financial derivatives. These policies generally re￾quire contractual hedges on a percentage of existing transaction exposures (e.g., 90% cover￾age of all exposures of 30 days or less, a minimum of 50% cover for exposures of 30 to 90 days 
in maturity, and selective cover of exposures greater than 90 days). As the maturity of the 
exposures lengthens, the required forward-cover percentage decreases.
The choice of which financial derivative or structure used for hedging will then be de￾termined by a combination of the market conditions, financial derivative alternatives, and 
general corporate comfort with the different hedging structures and derivatives. There are a 
few common sets of practices.
Which Hedging Instruments and Structures
Exhibit 10.7 summarizes the results of a recent hedging practice survey conducted by Wells 
Fargo covering both hedging practices and hedging instruments. Firms surveyed indicated 
that they hedged roughly 70% of all trade and finance-related exposures (on balance sheet) 
as well as 59% of forecasted exposures. Their hedging of their net investment and net income 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 10.3 
protects the firm against unpredictable events, like insur￾ance. A unit making an obligated payment in foreign currency 
could see its cost of settlement increase dramatically if the 
foreign currency appreciated against the firm’s own cur￾rency cash flows. This added cost would not be offset by 
the intra-company counterparty; the counterparty would not 
enjoy any foreign exchange gain as it has sold in its own cur￾rency. Secondly, multinational tax planning and management 
requires not only positioning of profitability but also predict￾ability of profitability. Foreign exchange gains and losses can 
destroy cash flow forecasts and tax planning.
Why Intra-Company Hedging Makes Sense
A common hedging debate is whether two units of the same 
company, when processing payments in different currencies 
among themselves, should hedge. The basic argument is 
that assuming one unit is transacting in its home currency 
and the other in a “foreign” currency, then hedging makes no 
sense because one unit’s gain is the other unit’s loss—net 
zero impact.
This argument is misleading on at least two different 
levels. First, hedging a foreign currency transaction exposure 
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 329 03/05/23 2:56 PM330 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
in their foreign subsidiaries (detailed in Chapter 11) was much lower at 10% and 8%, respec￾tively. In terms of which hedging instruments were used, forward contracts were used by 96% 
of the respondents, with options and option combinations (detailed in the appendix to this 
chapter) used by only 20% of the firms. Cross-currency swaps were used by 12% of the firms.
As might be expected, transaction exposure management programs are generally di￾vided along an “option line,” those that use options and those that do not. There are a vari￾ety of reasons typically cited for not using purchased options—their cost, their complexity, 
and the fact that they only bound exposures. Even firms that are frequent users of currency 
options occasionally are confronted with unusual market conditions making them impracti￾cal. In 2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis, option premiums skyrocketed in ex￾pense as option volatilities rose to the mid-20s. Firms that do not use currency options rely 
almost exclusively on forward contracts and money market hedges.
With forward contracts being so widely used, a number of forward contract rules are 
often noted and used by companies hedging transaction exposures:
1. When market conditions indicate that the use of a forward contract will lock in a for￾ward exchange gain (relative to the booked sale or payable), 100% required coverage is 
common.
2. When market conditions indicate that the forward premium (or discount) is quite small 
(1% to 2%), a high level of forward cover is required or encouraged.
In the end, forwards are used by nearly all firms all of the time.

Summary Points
■ MNEs encounter three types of currency exposure: 
transaction exposure, translation exposure, and oper￾ating exposure.
■ Transaction exposure measures gains or losses that 
arise from the settlement of financial obligations 
whose terms are stated in a foreign currency.
■ Considerable theoretical debate exists as to whether 
firms should hedge currency risk. Theoretically, hedg￾ing reduces the variability of the cash flows to the firm. 
It does not increase the cash flows to the firm. In fact, 
the costs of hedging may potentially lower them.
■ Transaction exposure can be managed by contrac￾tual techniques and certain operating strategies. 
Contractual hedging techniques include forward, fu￾tures, money market, and option hedges.
■ The choice of which contractual hedge to use depends 
on the individual firm’s currency risk tolerance and its 
expectation of the probable movement of exchange 
rates over the transaction exposure period.
■ Risk management in practice requires a firm’s trea￾sury to identify its goals, choose and identify which 
currency exposures to manage, and then select what 
types of hedging instruments or structures to utilize.
MINI-CASE
GraysonChung’s FX Exposure3
The business schools reward difficult complex behav￾ior more than simple behavior, but simple behavior is 
more effective.
—Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway.
GraysonChung (NASDAQ: GYCG) was a small publicly 
traded San Diego–based manufacturer of polishing and 
grinding equipment. The company’s chemical mechanical 
polishing (CMP) systems were widely used in the semicon￾ductor industry, where they were critically important for 
removing unevenness on wafer surfaces arising during pro￾duction. Company sales for the most recent year were just 
over $700 million.
In July 2018’s review of the most recently closed quarterly 
results (Exhibit A), GraysonChung’s board wanted to re￾view the company’s foreign exchange management practices. 
The company’s major analyst, Bill Kidd of Deutsche Securi￾ties, had raised questions about it. Management knew it was 
an issue; the questions had arisen before. GraysonChung’s 
current practice—inherited from its founders—was not to 
hedge, believing that foreign exchange risk was part of the risk 
associated with international business.
At first glance, it was a bit difficult to see why the 
board was concerned. Earnings per share (EPS) had risen 
over the first two quarters of 2018 (making it five consecu￾tive quarters of growing earnings), and that was despite 
a slight fall in sales in Q2. The second quarter had seen 
earnings rise to $13 million. But investors were spooked by 
the way the company’s earnings had bounced with foreign 
exchange gains and losses.
Currency Exposure
The chairman of GraysonChung’s board had opened 
the Q2 review meeting with the senior leadership team 
by asking what percentage of the company’s sales were 
international. As illustrated in Exhibit B, that was 44%. 
The board member then used that number to argue that 
the company should be hedging all international sales be￾cause they represented a significant currency risk to the 
firm’s earnings.
The task of revisiting the hedging question fell to 
GraysonChung’s corporate treasurer, Josué Soto. Soto had 
explained to the board that although 44% of the compa￾ny’s sales were international, a large portion of those sales 
were invoiced in U.S. dollars, not foreign currency. Those 
sales might pose specific cross-border risks, but currency 
exchange was not one of them. Soto went on to explain that 
the firm’s actual foreign exchange exposures arose from 
both sales and purchasing. In fact, a full 64% of the com￾pany’s cost of sales were denominated in foreign currency.
Back in his office, Soto reviewed GraysonChung’s 
foreign exchange gains and losses for Q1 of 2018 as seen in 
Exhibit C. GraysonChung was an international company, 
not a multinational company. It had no foreign subsidiar￾ies, but it did source heavily from two suppliers in Mexico 
and sell to a single major Japanese customer. In FX jar￾gon, the company was long Japanese yen (JPY)—it would 
be receiving yen in the future—and short Mexican pesos 
(MXN)—it would be paying pesos in the future.
In Q1 the company had booked three separate sales 
to its Japanese buyer, each for roughly ¥1.0 billion yen. 
Each sale (receivable) was booked by GraysonChung at 
the spot rate on that date per GAAP. GraysonChung’s

$27.68 million. Each of the receivables was settled in 30 
days as scheduled, but at spot exchange rates that had—
in two cases out of three—been in GraysonChung’s favor. 
The net FX settlement resulted in a gain of $0.63 million.
On the payables side, GraysonChung had sourced 
from two different Mexican suppliers for many years, one 
in Monterey and one in San Luis Potosi. The San Luis 
Potosi required payment in U.S. dollars. The Monterey 
manufacturer, however, required invoicing and payment 
in Mexican pesos (MXN). This was unusual for U.S.–
Mexican commercial transactions but required by the 
Monterey company. In Q1 GraysonChung had booked 
four purchases from the Monterey supplier for $20 million 
each. All were settled as required in 30 days. Those peso

When Soto reviewed the FX results for Q2, however, 
he saw some very different—better—results. Q2 book￾ings and settlements are shown in Exhibit D. Although 
suffering FX losses of $0.29 million on its Japanese yen 
sales, the Mexican peso purchasing—due to a sliding 
peso—had generated a $4.87 million gain. The FX net gain 
in the second quarter of $4.58 million ($4.87 - $0.29) 
had added significantly to GraysonChung’s EPS.

the dollar over the past decade. To add complexity, the yen 
had become quite “jumpy” in the past two years. Maybe 
it was indeed time to reconsider the company’s currency 
hedging policy.
Hedging
Soto had joined GraysonChung’s treasury in 2011, being 
promoted to treasurer in 2014. Long before he came on 
board, the company had suffered a series of what were re￾ferred to as the “derivative disasters.” Soto’s predecessor 
had utilized both forward exchange contracts and foreign 
currency options to manage currency exposures. But after 
a continuing series of quarters in which all hedges resulted 
in significant foreign exchange losses, the company’s CFO 
had instructed corporate treasury to cease all hedging ac￾tivities, arguing that its hedging appeared to be more like 
speculation than hedging—at least the way it was being 
done. That experience had resulted in a corporate policy of 
no foreign exchange hedging moving forward.
Soto knew if he were to renew foreign currency hedg￾ing activities, even on the initiative of the board, he would 
have to start slowly and very conservatively. That would 
likely translate into hedging only booked exposures (on￾balance sheet receivables and payables, not anticipated 
transactions) and maybe only the Japanese yen. He might 
also have to consider hedging less than 100% of the 
Although second quarter results had clearly been 
boosted by FX results, GraysonChung’s analyst was con￾cerned. In the company’s second quarter earnings call, Bill 
Kidd had questioned management over the company’s 
lack of currency hedging.
“Your investors signed up for CMP business-line risks, 
not currency risks. Don’t you owe it to them to protect 
earnings against these unpredictable currency swings? 
Currency hedging is not that expensive. Have you con￾sidered it?”
Exchange Rate Trends
The question had prompted GraysonChung’s board to ask 
Soto to review company policy. Soto’s first step was to take 
a look at how GraysonChung’s two most influential foreign 
currencies had trended over time. When he looked at how 
the peso and yen had moved against the dollar over the 
past eight years, as seen in Exhibit E, he saw distinct trends. 
Both currencies had weakened versus the U.S. dollar. This 
was clearly good for GraysonChung’s Mexican purchases; 
being short a weakening currency was always a good thing.
But Soto had to admit that was not the case with the 
Japanese yen. The yen was important to GraysonChung as 
it impacted a sizeable portion of revenues and therefore 
cash inflows. Clearly the yen had trended weaker against

The rates themselves were indeed quite bizarre, negative 
interest, as a result of the Japanese equivalent of “quanti￾tative easing” being conducted by the Bank of Japan over 
recent three years.
Getting interbank interest rates on the Mexican peso 
was more challenging. The peso interbank market was ad￾ministered by the Banco de Mexico and quite thin in terms 
of activity. Due to a recent resurgence of inflationary fears 
and a weakening peso, the central bank had driven inter￾est rates up. After some searching Soto found a few quotes 
of 8.000% per annum for both overnight and one-month 
interbank rates in pesos, rates that were fixed by the cen￾tral bank. He would make do with that for now, knowing 
that if he called a few banks for forward rates on the peso 
he would get some pretty ugly numbers. He also collected 
the ending spot rates corresponding to the 30-day settle￾ments. Soto’s final data table for calculating forward rates 
is shown in Exhibit F.4
Soto leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceil￾ing fan. But what about currency options? Wouldn’t they 
at least give the company an upside potential, if exchange 
rates occasionally moved in their favor? Again, given that 
individual exposures in case individual transactions were 
changed after booking.
Soto decided the next step was to do a little back￾testing of hedging for GraysonChung’s results. He quickly 
pulled together a set of exchange rate and interest rate 
quotes corresponding to GraysonChung’s currency trans￾actions (receivables and payables) for the first two quar￾ters of 2018 in order to calculate some forward rates. (Soto 
did not want to contact any of his partner banks yet, as any 
calls requesting FX information would prompt a deluge of 
sales calls and efforts from their FX services departments.) 
He would calculate the 30-day forward rates correspond￾ing to the foreign currency receivable and payable transac￾tions over the first two quarters of 2018 using the usual 
forward rate formula (where the interest rates were the 
30-day LIBOR rates per currency in annual terms).
He immediately ran into an anticipated problem. Get￾ting Japanese yen LIBOR rates was not a problem. (The 
U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis was a good online 
resource.) The yen LIBOR market was a very active and 
very liquid market, particularly given its ready use by pri￾vate organizations and institutions in the yen-carry trade.

 One alternative available to Soto which he preferred to ignore was the trading in Mexican peso futures on the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange. Although futures were extremely liquid, GraysonChung, like most corporates, had no interest in using futures for hedging 
given the daily margin calls and marked-to-market valuation fluctuations that would result.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 335 03/05/23 2:56 PMthe company would not likely accept a new active currency 
hedging program and the wide use of currency options (at 
least initially, he might consider using options only on cash 
inflows, the Japanese yen receivables). The yen had been 
moving in less of a trend against the dollar, so maybe there 
was an opportunity to do better than forwards with the 
selective use of put options on yen receivables.
Soto’s next task was to collect put option prices on the 
yen for the backdated period as well, Q1 and Q2 of 2018. 
He had a lot of what he already needed—spot rates, inter￾est rates on the two currencies, calculated forward rates—
but he still would need option volatilities. He checked his 
data terminal and was able to pull implied volatilities for 
30-day yen options for the first part of the year. After some 
deliberation, Soto concluded that he would be as conser￾vative as possible and only consider forward-at-the-money 
strike rates for his pricing and back-testing. His put option 
worksheet is shown in Exhibit G.
Soto had some work to do. He would first look at how 
the company’s financial results would have looked if it had 
used forwards to cover all exposures in Q1 and Q2 of 2018. 
He wanted to look at just hedging the receivables—the yen 
first and then both the foreign currency exposures second. 
The option analysis would be a bit more involved. He had to 
first price the puts, estimate how much the company would 
be spending in option premiums, and then perform the back￾dated analysis to see if the options would have saved the 
company some money while providing exposure protection.

Problems
10.1 Gray Wolf. Gray Wolf, Ltd., a Canadian manufac￾turer of raincoats, does not selectively hedge its 
transaction exposure. Instead, if the date of the 
transaction is known with certainty, all foreign 
currency-denominated cash flows must utilize the 
following mandatory forward cover formula:
Mandatory 
Forward Cover 0-90 days 91-180 days 180 days
Paying the 
points forward
75% 60% 50%
Receiving the 
points forward
100% 90% 50%
Gray Wolf expects to receive multiple payments in 
Danish kroner over the next year. DKr3,000,000 
is due in 90 days, DKr2,000,000 is due in 180 days, 
and DKr1,000,000 is due in one year. Using the 
following spot and forward exchange rates, what 
would be the amount of forward cover required by 
company policy for each period?
Dkr = C€1.00
Spot rate 4.70
3-month forward rate 4.71
6-month forward rate 4.72
12-month forward rate 4.74
10.2 Kraftangan Ornamentals. Kraftangan Ornamentals, 
a Malaysian, 100% privately-owned ornamentals 
company, has signed an agreement to acquire a 60% 
ownership share of Taiwan Ornamentals, a Taiwan￾based, privately-owned ornamental company spe￾cializing in customized figurines from Thailand and 
Indonesia. The acquisition price is 9 million Taiwan 
dollars (TWD), payable in cash in three months.
Ahmad Chik, the owner of Kraftangan Ornamen￾tals, believes the Taiwan dollar will either remain 
stable or decline slightly over the next three months. 
At the present spot rate of TWD7.35 = RM1.00, the 
amount of cash required is only RM1,224,490, but 
even this relatively modest amount will need to be 
borrowed personally by Ahmad Chik. The Taiwanese 
interest-bearing deposits by non-residents are reg￾ulated by the government and are currently set at 
1.7% per year. He has a credit line with Malaysian 
Entrepreneurial Bank for RM1,224,490 with a cur￾rent borrowing interest rate of 6.5% per year. He 
does not believe that he can calculate a credible 
weighted average cost of capital since the company 
is not listed and neither are his closest competitors. 
Since the acquisition would use up all his available 
credit, he wonders if he should hedge the transaction 
10.7 Arguments for Currency Hedging. Describe four 
arguments in favor of a firm pursuing an active cur￾rency risk management program.
10.8 Arguments against Currency Hedging. Describe 
six arguments against a firm pursuing an active cur￾rency risk management program.
10.9 Transaction Exposure. What are the four main 
types of transactions from which transaction expo￾sure arises?
10.10 Life Span of a Transaction Exposure. Diagram the 
life span of an exposure arising from selling a prod￾uct on open account. On the diagram define and 
show quotation, backlog, and billing exposures.
10.11 Unperformed Contracts. Which contract is more 
likely not to be performed, a payment due from a 
customer in foreign currency (a currency exposure) 
or a forward contract with a bank to exchange the 
foreign currency for the firm’s domestic currency at 
a contracted rate (the currency hedge)?
10.12 Cash Balances. Why do foreign currency cash bal￾ances not cause transaction exposure?
10.13 Contractual Currency Hedges. What are the four 
main contractual instruments used to hedge trans￾action exposure?
10.14 Money Market Hedges. How does a money market 
hedge differ for an account receivable versus that 
of an account payable? Is it really a meaningful 
difference?
10.15 Balance Sheet Hedging. What is the difference be￾tween a balance sheet hedge, a financing hedge, and 
a money market hedge?
10.16 Hedging with Forward Contracts. Explain how a 
Singaporean corporation could hedge a receivable 
in British pounds using a forward contract. What is 
the cost of such a forward market hedge?
10.17 Foreign Currency Option Premia. Why do many 
firms object to paying for foreign currency option 
hedges? Do firms pay for forward contract hedges? 
How do forwards and options differ if at all?
10.18 Decision Criteria. Ultimately, a treasurer must 
choose among alternative strategies to manage 
transaction exposure. Explain the two main decision 
criteria that must be used.
10.19 Risk Management Hedging Practices. According to 
surveys of corporate practices, which currency expo￾sures do most firms regularly hedge?
10.20 Hedging Booked Exposures. Why do many firms 
only allow hedging of existing exposures and not 
allow the hedging of anticipated exposures?

10.5 BioTron Medical, Inc. Brent Bush, CFO of medical 
device distributor BioTron Medical, Inc., was ap￾proached by a Japanese customer, Numata, with a 
proposal to pay cash (in yen) for its typical orders 
of ¥12,500,000 every other month if it were given 
a 4.5% discount. Numata’s current terms are 30 
days with no discounts. Using the following quotes 
and estimated cost of capital for Numata, Bush will 
compare the proposal with covering yen payments 
with forward contracts. Should Brent Bush accept 
Numata’s proposal?
Spot rate: ¥111.40 = €1.00
30-day forward rate: ¥111.00 = €1.00
90-day forward rate: ¥110.40 = €1.00
180-day forward rate: ¥109.20 = €1.00
Numata’s WACC 8.850%
BioTron’s WACC 9.200%
10.6 Bobcat Company. Bobcat Company, a U.S.-based 
manufacturer of industrial equipment, just pur￾chased a Korean company that produces plastic nuts 
and bolts for heavy equipment. The purchase price 
was W7,500 million. W1,000 million has already 
been paid, and the remaining W6,500 million is due 
in six months. The current spot rate is W1,110/$, and 
the 6-month forward rate is W1,175/$. The 6-month 
Korean won interest rate is 16% per annum, the 
6-month U.S. dollar rate is 4% per annum. Bobcat 
can invest at these interest rates, or borrow at 
2% per annum above those rates. A 6-month call 
option on won with a W1,200/$ strike rate has a 3.0% 
premium, while the 6-month put option at the same 
strike rate has a 2.4% premium. Bobcat can invest 
at the rates given previously, or borrow at 2% per 
annum above those rates. Bobcat’s weighted aver￾age cost of capital is 10%. Compare alternate ways 
that Bobcat might deal with its foreign exchange ex￾posure. What do you recommend and why?
10.7 Siam Cement. Siam Cement, the Bangkok-based 
cement manufacturer, suffered enormous losses 
with the coming of the Asian crisis in 1997. The 
company had been pursuing a very aggressive 
growth strategy in the mid-1990s, taking on mas￾sive quantities of foreign-currency-denominated 
debt (primarily U.S. dollars). When the Thai baht 
(B) was devalued from its pegged rate of THB25.0 
= USD1.00 in July 1997, Siam’s interest payments 
alone were over USD900 million on its outstanding 
dollar debt (with an average interest rate of 8.40% 
exposure. He has the following quotes from the 
Malaysian Entrepreneurial Bank:
Spot rate (TWD = RM1.00) 7.35
3-month forward rate 
(TWD = RM1.00)

3-month Taiwan dollar deposit rate 1.700%
3-month Malaysian ringgit 
borrowing rate

3-month call option on TWD not available
Analyze the cost and risks of each alternative, and 
then make a recommendation as to which alterna￾tive Ahmad Chik should choose.
10.3 Elan Pharmaceuticals. Elan Pharmaceuticals, a U.S.-
based multinational pharmaceutical company, is 
evaluating an export sale of its cholesterol-reduction 
drug with a prospective Indonesian distributor. The 
purchase would be for 1,650  million Indonesian ru￾piah (Rp), which at the current spot exchange rate 
of Rp9,450 = €1.00, translates into nearly €175,000. 
Although not a big sale by company standards, com￾pany policy dictates that sales must be settled for at 
least a minimum gross margin, in this case, a cash 
settlement of €168,000. The current 90-day forward 
rate is Rp9,950 = €1.00. Although this rate appeared 
unattractive, Elan had to contact several major banks 
before even finding a forward quote on the rupiah. 
The consensus of currency forecasters at the moment, 
however, is that the rupiah will hold relatively steady, 
possibly rising to Rp9,400 = €1.00 over the coming 
90 to 120 days. Analyze the prospective sale and make 
a hedging recommendation.
10.4 Embraer of Brazil. Embraer of Brazil is one of the 
two leading global manufacturers of regional jets. 
(Bombardier of Canada is the other.) Regional jets 
are smaller than the traditional civilian airliners 
produced by Airbus and Boeing, seating between 50 
and 100 people on average. Embraer has concluded 
an agreement with a regional U.S. airline to produce 
and deliver four aircraft one year from now for 
USD80 million.
Although Embraer will be paid in U.S. dollars, it 
also possesses a currency exposure of inputs—it must 
pay foreign suppliers USD20  million for inputs one 
year from now (but they will be delivering the subcom￾ponents throughout the year). The current spot rate on 
the Brazilian real (BRL) is BRL1.8240 = USD1.00, 
but it has been steadily appreciating against the U.S. 
dollar over the past three years. Forward contracts 
are difficult to acquire and are considered expen￾sive. Citibank Brasil has not explicitly provided Em￾braer a forward rate quote but has stated that it will 
probably be pricing a forward off the current 4.00% U.S.

Twelve months 7.9515% 0.1505% 7.8010%
Note that the interest rate differentials vary slightly 
from the forward discounts on the yen because of 
time differences for the quotes. The spot ¥80.31/S$, 
for example, is a mid-point range. On June 1, the spot 
yen traded in London from ¥80.36/S$ to ¥79.86/S$. 
Singflux’s Japanese competitors are currently bor￾rowing from Japanese banks at a spread of one 
percentage point above the Japanese money rate. 
Singflux’s weighted average cost of capital is 10%, 
and the company wishes to protect the Singapore 
dollar value of this receivable.
These 3-month options are available from Kokoda 
Bank: a call option on ¥100,000,000 at exercise 
price of ¥80.00/S$: a 1% premium; or a put option 
on ¥100,000,000, at exercise price of ¥80.00/S$: a 
3% premium.

10.10 Mattel Toys. Mattel is a U.S.-based company whose 
sales are roughly two-thirds in dollars (Asia and 
the Americas) and one-third in euros (Europe). 
In September, Mattel delivers a large shipment 
of toys (primarily Barbies and Hot Wheels) to a 
major distributor in Antwerp. The receivable, €30
million, is due in 90 days, standard terms for the 
toy industry in Europe. Mattel’s treasury team 
has collected the following currency and market 
quotes. The company’s foreign exchange advisors 
believe the euro will be at about €1.4200 = €1.00
in 90 days. Mattel’s management does not use cur￾rency options in currency risk management activi￾ties. Advise Mattel on which hedging alternative is 
probably preferable.

Cement took out USD50  million in debt in June 
1997 at 8.40% interest and had to repay it in one 
year when the spot exchange rate had stabilized 
at THB42.0 = USD1.00, what was the foreign ex￾change loss incurred on the transaction?
10.8 P&G India. Procter and Gamble’s affiliate in India, 
P&G India, procures much of its toiletries product 
line from a Japanese company. Because of the short￾age of working capital in India, payment terms by 
Indian importers are typically 180 days or longer. 
P&G India wishes to hedge an 8.5 million Japanese 
yen (JPY) payable. Although options are not avail￾able on the Indian rupee (INR), forward rates are 
available against the yen. Additionally, a common 
practice in India is for companies like P&G India to 
work with a currency agent who will, in this case, lock 
in the current spot exchange rate in exchange for a 
4.85% fee. Using the following exchange rate and in￾terest rate data, recommend a hedging strategy. (All 
rates of interest are stated on a per annum basis.)

Wing Sang’s treasury manager, concerned about 
the overheating Thai economy, wonders if Wing 
Sang should be hedging its foreign exchange risk. 
The manager’s forecast is as follows:
Expected spot rate in 6-months (TBH = HKD1.00):
Highest expected rate (reflecting 
a significant devaluation)
4.5000
Expected rate 4.0000

Sang for making payments? Which method would 
you select and why?
10.13 RadioEdison Manufacturing. Carla Surz is the di￾rector of finance for RadioEdison Manufacturing, 
a U.S.-based manufacturer of handheld computer 
systems for inventory management. RadioEdison’s 
system combines a low-cost active radio frequency 
identification (RFID) tag that is attached to inven￾tory items (the tag emits an extremely low-grade 
radio frequency) with custom-designed hardware 
and software that tracks the low-grade emissions 
for inventory control. RadioEdison has completed 
the sale of an inventory management system to a 
British firm, Pegg Metropolitan (UK), for a total 
payment of £1,000,000. The exchange rates that fol￾low were available to Burton on the dates shown, 
corresponding to the events of this specific export 
sale. Assume each month is 30 days.
a. What will be the amount of foreign exchange 
gain (loss) upon settlement?
b. If Carla hedges the exposure with a forward 
contract, what will be the net foreign exchange 
gain (loss) on settlement?
10.11 Chronos Time Pieces. Chronos Time Pieces of 
Boston exports watches to many countries, selling in 
local currencies to stores and distributors. Chronos 
prides itself on being financially conservative. At 
least 70% of each individual transaction exposure is 
hedged, mostly in the forward market, but occasion￾ally with options. Chronos’ foreign exchange policy 
is such that the 70% hedge may be increased up to a 
120% hedge if devaluation or depreciation appears 
imminent. Chronos has just shipped to its major 
North American distributor. It has issued a 90-day 
invoice to its buyer for €1,560,000. The current spot 
rate is €1.2224 = €1.00, and the 90-day forward rate 
is €1.2270 = €1.00. Chronos’s treasurer, Manny 
Hernandez, has a very good track record in predict￾ing exchange rate movements. He currently believes 
the euro will weaken against the dollar in the com￾ing 90 to 120 days, possibly to around €1.16 = €1.00.
a. Evaluate the hedging alternatives for Chronos 
if Manny is right (Case 1: €1.16 = €1.00) and if 
Manny is wrong (Case 2: €1.26 = €1.00). What 
do you recommend?
b. What does it mean to hedge 120% of a transac￾tion exposure?
c. What would be considered the most conserva￾tive transaction exposure management policy by 
a firm? How does Chronos compare?
10.12 Wing Sang Jeans. Wing Sang Jeans Limited of Hong 
Kong is completing a new assembly plant near 
Bangkok, Thailand. A final construction payment 
of TBH28,200,000 is due in six months. (TBH is the 
code for Thai baht.) Wing Sang uses 15% per annum

10.16 ABB Group. On May 1, ABB Group, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Asia Power Generation 
Corporation (Philippines), sold a 20-megawatt trans￾former to Roma Italia SpA of Italy for €5,000,000, 
payable as €2,500,000 on September 1 and 
€2,500,000 on December 1. ABB derived its price 
quote of €5,000,000 on April 1 by dividing its nor￾mal Philippine peso sales price of PHP279,750,000 
by the then current spot rate of PHP55.9500 = €1.00.
By the time the order was received and booked on 
June 1, the euro had strengthened to PHP56.0500 
= €1.00, so the sale was in fact worth €5,000,000 *
PHP56.0500 = PHP280,250,000. ABB had already 
gained an extra PHP500,000 from the favorable 
exchange rate movements. Nevertheless, ABB’s di￾rector of finance now wondered if the firm should 
hedge against a reversal of the most recent trend of 
the euro. Four approaches were possible:
1. Hedge in the forward market: The 3-month for￾ward exchange quote was PHP56.1500/€ and the 
6-month forward quote was PHP57.0500 = €1.00.
2. Hedge in the money market: ABB could borrow 
euros from the Munich branch of its Philippine 
bank at 6.00% per annum.
3. Hedge with foreign currency options: September 
put options were available at a strike price of 
PHP56.0500 = €1.00 for a premium of 1.5% per 
contract, and December put options were avail￾able at PHP56.0500 = €1.00 for a premium of 
1.1%. September call options at PHP56.0500 =
€1.00 could be purchased at a premium of 2.0%, 
and December call options at PHP56.0500 =
€1.00 were available at a 1.7% premium.
4. Do nothing: ABB could wait until the sales pro￾ceeds were received in September and Decem￾ber, hope the recent strengthening of the euro 
would continue, and sell the euros receives for 
Philippine pesos in the spot market.
ABB estimates the cost of equity capital to be 
10% per annum. As a moderate-sized firm, ABB is 
unable to raise funds with long-term debt. Average 
euro denominated government bonds yield 1.0% per 
annum. What should ABB do?

Michigan. The company specializes in specific pre￾cious metals and materials that are used in a vari￾ety of pigment applications in many industries in￾cluding cosmetics, appliances, and a variety of high 
tinsel metal fabricating equipment. Micca just pur￾chased a shipment of phosphates from Morocco for 
6,000,000 dirhams, payable in six months.
Six-month call options on 6,000,000 dirhams at an ex￾ercise price of 10.00 dirhams per dollar are available 
from Bank Al-Maghrub at a premium of 2%. Six￾month put options on 6,000,000 dirhams at an exer￾cise price of 10.00 dirhams per dollar are available at 
a premium of 3%. Compare and contrast alternative

The 90-day eurodollar interest rate is 6.000%, while 
the 90-day Korean won deposit rate (there is no 
euro–won rate) is 5.000%. KAL can borrow in Ko￾rea at 6.250% and can probably borrow in the U.S. 
dollar market at 9.375%.
A three-month call option in dollars in the 
over-the-counter market for a strike price of won 
KRW790 = USD1.00 sells at a premium of 2.9%, 
payable at the time the option is purchased. A 90-
day put option on dollars, also at a strike price of 
won KRW790, sells at a premium of 1.9% (assuming 
a 12% volatility). KAL’s foreign exchange advisory 
service forecasts the spot rate in three months to be 
KRW792 = USD1.00.

at establishing commercial policies for the new 
subsidiary.
Milan’s first shipment of product to South 
Africa was upcoming. The first shipment would carry 
an intracompany invoice amount of EUR2,000,000. 
The company was now trying to decide whether to 
invoice the South African subsidiary in euros or 
South African rand (ZAR) and, in turn, whether the 
resulting transaction exposure should be hedged. 
Alberto’s idea was to take a recent historical period 
of exchange rate quotes and simulate the invoicing 
and hedging alternatives available to Milan to try 
and characterize the choices.
Alberto looked at the 90-day period, which had 
ended the previous Friday (standard intra-company 
payment terms for transcontinental transactions was 
90 days). The quarter had opened with a spot rate of 
ZAR16.43 = EUR1.00, with the 90-day forward rate 
quoted at ZAR15.95 = EUR1.00 the same day. The 
quarter had closed with a spot rate of ZAR17.85 =
EUR 1.00.

CHAPTER 10 APPENDIX A
Complex Option Hedges
Aidan, the same Irish firm used throughout the chapter, still possesses a long £1 million
exposure—an account receivable—to be settled in 90 days. Exhibit 10A.1 summarizes the 
assumptions, exposure, and traditional option alternatives to be used throughout this appen￾dix. The firm believes that the exchange rate will move in its favor over the 90-day period 
(the British pound will appreciate versus the euro). Despite having this directional view or 
currency expectation, the firm wishes downside protection in the event the pound were to 
depreciate instead.
The exposure management zones that are of most interest to the firm are the two oppos￾ing triangles formed by the uncovered and forward rate profiles. The firm would like to retain 
all potential area in the upper-right triangle but minimize its own potential exposure to the 
bottom-left triangle. The put option’s “kinked profile” is consistent with what the firm wishes 
if it believes the pound will appreciate.
The firm could consider any number of different put option strike prices, depending on 
what minimum assured value—degree of self-insurance—the firm is willing to accept. Exhibit 
10A.1 illustrates two different put option alternatives: a forward-ATM put of strike price 
€1.09 = £1.00 and a forward-OTM put with strike price €1.06 = £1.00. Because foreign

currency options are actually priced about the forward rate (see Chapter 8), not the spot rate, 
the correct specification of whether an option, put or call, is ITM, ATM, or OTM is in refer￾ence to the same maturity forward rate. The forward-OTM put provides protection at lower 
cost but also at a lower level of protection.
The Synthetic Forward
At a forward rate of €1.09 = £1.00, the proceeds of the forward contract in 90 days will yield 
€1,090,000. A second alternative for the firm would be to construct a synthetic forward using 
options. The synthetic forward requires the firm to combine two options, of equal size and 
maturity, both with strike rates at the forward rate:
1. Buy a put option on £ bought at a strike price of €1.09 = £1.00, paying a premium of 
€0.0318 per£
2. Sell a call option on £ at a strike price of €1.09 = £1.00, earning a premium of 
€0.0318 per£
The purchase of the put option requires a premium payment, and the sale of the call 
option earns the firm a premium payment. If both options are struck at the forward rate 
(forward-ATM), the premiums should be identical and the net premium payment have a 
value of zero.
Exhibit 10A.2 illustrates the uncovered position, the basic forward rate hedge, and the 
individual profiles of the put and call options for the possible construction of a synthetic 
forward. The outcome of the combined position is easily confirmed by simply tracing what 
would happen at all exchange rates to the left of €1.09 = £1.00 and what would happen to 
the right of €1.09.
At all exchange rates to the left of €1.09 = £1.00:
1. The firm would receive £1,000,000 in 90 days.
2. The call option on pounds sold by the firm would expire out-of-the-money.
3. The firm would exercise the put option on pounds to sell the pounds received at €1.09.
At all exchange rates to the right of €1.09 = £1.00:
1. The firm would receive £1,000,000 in 90 days.
2. The put option on pounds purchased by the firm would expire out-of-the-money.
3. The firm would turn over the £1,000,000 received to the buyer of the call, who now 
exercises the call option against the firm. The firm receives €1.09 = £1.00 from the call 
option buyer.
Thus, at all exchange rates above or below €1.09 = £1.00, the Irish firm nets 
€1,090,000 in domestic currency. The combined spot-option position has behaved identically 
to that of a forward contract. A firm with the exact opposite position, a £1,000,000 payable 
90 days in the future, could similarly construct a synthetic forward using options.5
But why would a firm undertake this relatively complex position in order to simply cre￾ate a forward contract? The answer is found by looking at the option premiums earned and 
paid. We have assumed that the option strike prices used were precisely forward-ATM rates, 
and the resulting option premiums paid and earned were exactly equal. But this need not be 
5
 An Irish firm possessing a future foreign currency denominated payment of £1 million could construct a synthetic 
forward hedge by (1) buying a call option on £1 million at a strike price of €1.09 = £1.00; and (2) selling a put option 
on £1 million at the same strike price of €1.09 = £1.00, when €1.09 is the forward rate.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 344 03/05/23 2:56 PMthe case. If the option strike prices (remember that they must be identical for both options, 
bought and sold) are not precisely on the forward-ATM, the two premiums may differ by a 
slight amount. The net premium position may then end up as a net premium earning or a net 
premium payment. If positive, this amount would be added to the proceeds from the receiv￾able to result in a higher total dollar value received than through the use of a traditional 
forward contract. A second possibility is that the firm, by querying a number of different 
financial service providers offering options, finds attractive pricing which “beats” the forward. 
Although this means that theoretically the options market is out of equilibrium, it happens 
quite frequently.
Second-Generation Currency Risk Management Products
Second-generation risk management products are constructed from the two basic derivatives 
used throughout this book text: the forward and the option. We will subdivide them into 
two groups: (1) the zero-premium option products, which focus on pricing in and around 
the forward rate and (2) the exotic option products (for want of a better name), which focus 
on alternative pricing targets. Although all of the following derivatives are sold as financial 
products by risk management firms, we will present each as the construction of the position 
from common building blocks, or LEGO®s, as they have been termed, used in traditional cur￾rency risk management, forwards, and options. As a group, they are collectively referred to as 
complex options.

Zero-Premium Option Products The primary problem with the use of options for risk 
management in the eyes of the firms is the up-front premium payment. Although the pre￾mium payment is only a portion of the total payoff profile of the hedge, many firms view 
the expenditure of substantial funds for the purchase of a financial derivative as prohibi￾tively expensive. In comparison, the forward contract that eliminates currency risk requires 
no out-of-pocket expenditure by the firm (and requires no real specification of expectations 
regarding exchange rate movements).
Zero-premium option products (or financially engineered derivative combinations) are 
designed to require no out-of-pocket premium payment at the initiation of the hedge. This 
set of products includes what are most frequently labeled the range forward or collar and the 
participating forward. Both of these products (1) are priced on the basis of the forward rate, 
(2) are constructed to provide a zero-premium payment up front, and (3) allow the hedger 
to take advantage of expectations of the direction of exchange rate movements. For the case 
problem at hand, this means that all of the following products are applicable to an expecta￾tion that the U.S. dollar will depreciate versus the pound. If the hedger has no such view, they 
should turn back now (and buy a forward or nothing at all)!
The Range Forward or Collar The basic range forward has been marketed under a variety 
of other names, including the collar, flexible forward, cylinder option, option fence or simply 
fence, mini-max, or zero-cost tunnel. Regardless of which alias it trades under, it is constructed 
via two steps:
1. Buying a put option with a strike rate below the forward rate for the full amount of the 
long currency exposure (100% coverage)
2. Selling a call option with a strike rate above the forward rate for the full amount of the 
long currency exposure (100% coverage), with the same maturity as the purchased put
The hedger chooses one side of the “range” or spread, normally the downside (put strike 
rate), which then dictates the strike rate at which the call option will be sold. The call option 
must be chosen at an equal distance from the forward rate as the put option strike price from 
the forward rate. The distance from the forward rate for the two strike prices should be calcu￾lated in percentage, as in ± 3% from the forward rate.
If the hedger believes there is a significant possibility that the currency will move in the 
firm’s favor, and by a sizable degree, the put-floor rate may be set relatively low in order for 
the ceiling to be higher or further out from the forward rate and still enjoy a zero net pre￾mium. How far down the downside protection is set is a difficult issue for the firm to deter￾mine. Often the firm’s treasurer will determine at what bottom exchange rate the firm would 
be able to recover the minimum necessary margin on the business underlying the cash flow 
exposure, sometimes called the budget rate.
Exhibit 10A.3 illustrates the final outcome of a range forward constructed by buying 
a put with strike price €1.07 = £1.00, paying a premium of €0.0226per£, with selling a call 
option with strike price €1.11 = £1.00, earning a premium of €0.0231per£. The hedger has 
bounded the range over which the firm’s A/R value moves as an uncovered position, with 
a put option floor and a sold call option ceiling. Although the put and call option premiums 
are in this case not identical, they are close enough to result in a near-zero net premium 
(a premium expense of €500 in this case):
Net premium = (€0.0226/£ €0.0231/£) * £1,000,000 = €500
The benefits of the combined position are readily observable, given that the put option 
premium alone amounts to €22,600. If the strike rates of the options are selected indepen￾dently of the desire for an exact zero-net premium up-front (still bracketing the forward 
rate), it is termed an option collar or cylinder option.
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 346 03/05/23 2:56 PMThe Participating Forward The participating forward, also called a zero-cost ratio option
and forward participation agreement, is an option combination that allows the hedger to 
share—or participate—in potential upside movements while providing option-based downside 
protection, all at a zero net premium. The participating forward is constructed via two steps:
1. Buying a put option with a strike price below the forward rate for the full amount of the 
long currency exposure (100% coverage)
2. Selling a call option with a strike price that is the same as the put option for a portion of 
the total currency exposure (less than 100% coverage)
Similar to the range forward, the buyer of a participating forward will choose the put op￾tion strike rate first. Because the call option strike rate is the same as the put, all that remains 
is to determine the participation rate, the proportion of the exposure sold as a call option.
Exhibit 10A.4 illustrates the construction of a participating forward for the chapter prob￾lem. The firm first chooses the put option protection level, in this case €1.07 = £1.00, with 
a premium of €0.0226per£. A call option sold with the same strike rate of €1.07 = £1.00
would earn the firm €0.0425per£. The call premium is substantially higher than the put pre￾mium because the call option is already in-the-money (ITM). The firm’s objective is to sell a 
call option only on the number of pounds needed to fund the purchase of the put option. The 
total put option premium is:

which is then used to determine the size of the call option that is needed to exactly offset the 
purchase of the put:
€22,600 = €0.0425 per £ * call principal
Solving for the call principal:
Call principal = €22,600
€0.0425 per £ = £531,765
The firm must therefore sell a call option on £531,765 with a strike rate of €1.07 = £1.00 
to cover the purchase of the put option. This mismatch in option principals is what gives the 
participating forward its unique shape. The ratio of option premiums, as well as the ratio of 
option principals, is termed the percent cover:
Percent cover = €0.026 per £
€0.0425 per £ = £531,765
£1,000,00 = 0.5318 ≈ 53.18%
The participation rate is the residual percentage of the exposure that is not covered by 
the sale of the call option. For example, if the percent cover is 53.18%, the participation rate 
would be 1—the percent cover, or 46.82%. This means that for all favorable exchange rate 
movements (those above €1.07 = £1.00), the hedger would “participate” or enjoy 46.8% of 
the differential. However, like all option-based hedges, downside exposure is bounded by the 
put option strike rate.

M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 348 03/05/23 2:56 PMThe expectations of the buyer are similar to the range forward; only the degree of foreign 
currency bullishness is greater. For the participating forward to be superior in outcome to the 
range forward, it is necessary for the exchange rate to move further in the favorable direction.
Ratio Spreads One of the older methods of obtaining a zero-premium option combination, 
and one of the most dangerous from a hedger’s perspective, is the ratio spread. This structure 
leaves the hedger with a large uncovered exposure.
Let us assume that Aidan decides that it wishes to establish a floor level of protection by 
purchasing a €1.09 = £1.00 put option (forward-ATM) at a cost of €0.0318per£ (total cost of 
€31,800). This is a substantial outlay of up-front capital for the option premium, and the firm’s 
risk management division has no budget funding for this magnitude of expenditures. The firm, 
feeling strongly that the dollar will depreciate against the pound, decides to “finance” the pur￾chase of the put with the sale of an OTM call option. The firm reviews market conditions and 
considers a number of call option strike prices that are significantly OTM, strike prices of 
€1.14 = £1.00,€1.16 = £1.00, or further out.
It is decided that the €1.14 = £1.00 call option, with a premium of €0.0089per£, is to be 
written and sold to earn the premium and finance the put purchase. However, because the 
premium on the OTM call is so much smaller than the forward-ATM put premium, the size of 
the call option written must be larger. The firm determines the amount of the call by solving 
the simple problem of premium equivalency as follows:
Cost of put premium = Earnings call premium
Substituting in the put and call option premiums yields:
€0.0318 per £ * £1,000,000 = €0.0089 per £ * £ call
Solving for the size of the call option to be written as follows:
€31,800
€0.0089 per £ = £3,573,034
The reason that this strategy is called a ratio spread is that the final position, call option 
size to put option size, is a ratio greater than 1 (in this case, £3,573,034 , £1,000,000, or a ratio 
of about 3.57).
The risk to the firm in the use of a ratio spread is, however, dramatic. Although unlikely, 
it is possible that the spot rate could move far enough by the end of the period to put the 
call options written in-the-money. That would mean in our example that the firm would have 
written an uncovered call on £2,573,034, the call option notional principal less the exposure 
(£3,573,034 - £1,000,000). The loss potential in covering this position is unlimited.
An alternative form of the ratio spread is the calendar spread. The calendar spread would 
combine the 90-day put option with the sale of an OTM call option with a maturity that is 
longer—for example, 120 or 180 days. The longer maturity of the call option written earns 
the firm larger premium earnings requiring a smaller “ratio.” As a number of firms using 
this strategy have learned the hard way, however, if the expectations of the hedger prove 
incorrect, and the spot rate moves past the strike price of the call option written, the firm is 
faced with delivering a foreign currency that it does not have. In this example, if the spot rate 
moved above €1.14 = £1.00, the firm would have to cover a position of £2,573,034.
The Average Rate Option These options are normally classified as “path-dependent” cur￾rency options because their values depend on averages of spot rates over some pre-specified 
period of time. Here we describe two examples of path-dependent options, the average rate 
option and the average strike option:
CHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 349
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 349 03/05/23 2:56 PM350 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
1. Average rate option (ARO), also known as an Asian option, sets the option strike rate up 
front and is exercised at maturity if the average spot rate over the period (as observed 
by scheduled sampling) is less than the preset option strike rate.
2. Average strike option (ASO) establishes the option strike rate as the average of the spot 
rate experienced over the option’s life and is exercised if the strike rate is greater than 
the end of period spot rate.
Like the knock-out option, the average rate option is difficult to depict because its value 
depends not on the ending spot rate, but rather the path the spot rate takes over its specified 
life span. For example, an average rate option with strike price €1.09 = £1.00 would have 
a premium of only €0.0186per£. The average rate would be calculated by weekly observa￾tions (12 full weeks, the first observation occurring 13 days from purchase) of the spot rate. 
Numerous different averages or paths of spot rate movement obviously exist. A few different 
scenarios aid in understanding how the ARO differs in valuation.
1. The spot rate moves very little over the first 70 to 80 days of the period, with a sud￾den movement in the spot rate below €1.09 = £1.00 in the days prior to expiration. 
Although the final spot rate is below €1.09 = £1.00, the average for the period is above 
€1.09, so the option cannot be exercised. The receivable is exchanged at the spot rate 
(below €1.09 = £1.00) and the cost of the option premium is still incurred.
2. The euro slowly and steadily depreciates versus the pound, the rate rising from 
€1.0990 = £1.00 to €1.10, €1.11, and on up. At the end of the 90 days the option expires 
out of the money, the receivable is exchanged at the favorable spot rate, and the firm has 
enjoyed average rate option protection at substantially lower premium expense.
A variation on the average rate is the lookback option, with strike and without strike. 
A lookback option with strike is a European-style option with a preset strike rate that on 
maturity is valued versus the highest or lowest spot rate reached over the option life. A look￾back option without strike is typically a European-style option that sets the strike rate at 
maturity as the lowest exchange rate achieved over the period for a call option, or the highest 
exchange rate experienced over the period for a put option, and is exercised on the basis of 
this strike rate versus the ending spot rate.
A variety of different types of average rate currency option products are sold by 
financial institutions, each having a distinct payoff structure. Because of the intricacy of the 
path-dependent option’s value, care must be taken in the use of these instruments. As is 
always the case with more and more complex financial derivatives, caveat emptor.

The Optimal Hedge Ratio and Hedge Effectiveness
There are a number of other theoretical dimensions to currency hedging which are not often 
considered in actual industry practice, including the optimal hedge ratio, hedge symmetry, 
hedge effectiveness, and hedge timing.
Hedge Ratio
A transaction exposure is the uncertainty in the value of an asset—for example, a specific 
amount of foreign currency—that may be recognized or realized at a future point in time. 
In our example in this chapter, Aidan expected to receive £1,000,000 in 90 days but does not 
know for certain what that £1,000,000 will be worth in euros at that time (the spot exchange 
rate in 90 days).
The objective of currency hedging is to minimize the change in the value of the exposed 
asset or cash flow from a change in exchange rates. Hedging is accomplished by combining 
the exposed asset with a hedge asset to create a two asset portfolio in which the two assets 
react in relatively equal but opposite directions to an exchange rate change. Once formed, the 
most common objective of hedging is to construct a hedge which will result in a total change 
in value of the two asset portfolio (Δ Portfolio Value)—if perfect—of zero.
∆ Portfolio Value = ∆ Spot + ∆ Hedge = 0
A traditional forward hedge forms a two asset portfolio, combining the spot exposure 
with forward cover. The value of the two asset portfolio is then the sum of the foreign cur￾rency amount at the current spot rate (the exposure), with the hedge amount sold forward at 
the forward rate.
Two Asset Portfolio = [(Exposure - Hedge amount) * Spot] +
[Hedge amount * Forward rate]
For example, if Aidan hedged 100% of its £1,000,000 account receivable with a forward 
contract at time t = 90 (90 days till settlement), assuming a spot rate of €1.0940 = £1.00 and a 
90-day forward rate of €1.0840 = £1.00, this two asset portfolio would be:
Vt = [(£1,000,000 - £1,000,000) * €1.0940] + [£1,000,000 * €1.0840] = €1,084,000
Note that when there is a full forward cover, there is no uncovered exposure remain￾ing. The variance in the terminal value of this two asset portfolio with respect to the spot 
exchange rate over the following 90-day period is zero. Its value is set and certain. Also note 
that if the spot rate and the forward rate were exactly equal (which they are not here), the 
total position would be termed a perfect hedge.
If, however, Terry McDermott at Aidan decided to selectively hedge the exposure, cover￾ing less than 100% of the exposure, the value of the two asset portfolio would change with 
the spot exchange rate. The change in value could be either up or down. In this case, Terry 
McDermott would need to follow a methodology for determining what proportion, β, of the 
exposure, Xt, to cover (so β9Xt is the amount of the exposure covered). Now the two asset 
portfolio is written:
Vt = [(Xt - βXt
) * St
] + [βXt * Ft
]
CHAPTER 10 Transaction Exposure 351
M10B_EITE5960_16_GE_C10.indd 351 03/05/23 2:56 PM352 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
where the hedge ratio, β, is defined
β = Value of currency hedge
Value of currency exposure
If the entire exposure was covered as in Aidan’s example above, that is a hedge ratio of 
1.0 or 100%. The hedge ratio, β, is the percentage of an individual exposure’s nominal amount 
covered by a financial instrument such as a forward contract or currency option.
Hedge Symmetry. Some hedges can be constructed to result in no change in value to any 
and all exchange rate changes. The hedge is constructed so that whatever spot value is lost 
as a result of adverse exchange rate movements (Δ Spot), that value is replaced by an equal 
but opposite change in the value of the hedge asset, (Δ Hedge). The commonly used 100% 
forward contract cover is such a hedge. For example, in the case of Aidan, if the entire 
£1 million account receivable is sold forward, Aidan is assured of the same euro proceeds at 
the end of the 90-day period regardless of which direction the exchange rate moves over the 
exposure period.
But changes in the underlying spot exchange rate need not only result in losses; gains 
from exchange rate changes are equally possible. In the case of Aidan, if the dollar were to 
weaken against the pound over the 90-day period, the euro value of the account receivable 
would go up. Aidan may choose to construct a hedge, which would minimize the losses in the 
combined two asset portfolio (minimize negative Δ Value), but to allow positive changes in 
value (positive Δ Value) from exchange rate changes. A hedge constructed using a foreign 
currency option would be pursuing this alternative hedging objective. For Aidan, this would 
be the purchase of a put option on the pound to protect against value losses but allow Aidan 
to possibly reap value increases in the event the exchange rate moved in its favor.
Hedge Effectiveness. The effectiveness of a hedge is determined to what degree the 
change in spot asset’s value is correlated with the equal but opposite change in the hedge 
asset’s value to a change in the underlying spot exchange rate. In currency markets, spot and 
futures rates are nearly—but not precisely perfectly—correlated. This less-than-perfect cor￾relation is termed basis risk.
Hedge Timing. The hedger must also determine the timing of the hedge objective. Does 
the hedger wish to protect the value of the exposed asset only at the time of its maturity or 
settlement or at various points in time over the life of the exposure? For example, in the case 
of Aidan, the various hedging alternatives explored in the problem analysis—the forward, 
money market, purchased option hedges—all were constructed and evaluated for the dollar 
value of the combined hedge portfolio only at the end of the 90-day period. In some cases, 
however, Aidan might wish to protect the value of the exposed asset prior to maturity—
for example, at the end of a financial reporting period prior to the actual maturity of the 
exposure.

11.1 Describe how the consolidation of a multinational firm’s foreign entities creates 
translation exposure
11.2 Examine the two major methods of translation, including their theoretical and 
practical differences
11.3 Understand how translation can potentially alter the value of a firm
11.4 Explore how to manage translation exposure, including how one company uses 
swaps to do so
As you learned in Chapter 10, there are two distinct categories of foreign exchange exposure: 
those based in accounting and those based in economic competitiveness. The two accounting 
exposures are transaction exposure, covered in Chapter 10, and translation exposure. Transla￾tion exposure is the subject of this chapter.
Transaction exposure results from a firm having foreign currency-denominated contracts 
and commitments. Translation exposure arises because financial statements of foreign sub￾sidiaries—which are stated in foreign currency—must be restated in the parent’s reporting 
currency so that the firm can prepare consolidated financial statements. Foreign subsidiar￾ies of U.S. companies, for example, must restate foreign currency-denominated financial 
statements into U.S. dollars so that the foreign values can be added to the parent’s U.S. 
dollar-denominated balance sheet and income statement. This accounting process is called 
translation. Translation exposure is the potential for a change, positively or negatively, in the 
parent company’s net worth and/or net income resulting from a change in exchange rates 
since the last translation.
The main purpose of translation is to prepare consolidated financial statements for use 
by investors, creditors, and governments. However, management also uses the translated 
statements to assess the performance of foreign subsidiaries. While such assessment by 
management might be performed using the local currency statements, restatement of all 
subsidiary statements into a single currency, the currency of the parent company, facilitates 
management comparison and performance evaluation. Translation, therefore, has both 
financial and managerial implications for the multinational. The chapter concludes with the 
mini-case Electrolux of Sweden’s Currency Management, demonstrating how one major mul￾tinational firm structures and manages its currency exposures globally, combining transaction 
and translation exposure.

11. 1 Overview of Translation 
 Consolidation accounting is the process of combining the financial results of all subsidiary 
companies into the combined financial results of the parent company. Consolidated financial 
results are important to, and used by, investors, creditors, governments, and other corporate 
stakeholders to assess the risks, returns, and prospects of these entities. Our purpose here, 
however, is not to discuss or detail consolidation accounting, but rather the currency risk to the 
multinational firm that arises from the currency translation of foreign currency-denominated 
financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries. 
 Concepts and Definitions 
 We will use our example multinational firm Aidan Corporation, shown in Exhibit 11. 1 , to 
demonstrate the precise definition of key translation terms. Before we do, let us describe 
Aidan Corporation in more detail. 
■ Aidan Corporation. Aidan Corporation is an Irish multinational company. It is 
publicly traded on Euronext Dublin. It is required by law to report consolidated 
financial results according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 
euros—the euro is its reporting currency .

 EXHIBIT 11. 1 Consolidation and Translation of Financial Results for Aidan 
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 354 08/05/23 9:23 AMCHAPTER 11 Translation Exposure 355
■ Aidan Malaysia. Aidan Malaysia is a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of Aidan Corpora￾tion. As a Malaysian business, it maintains its financial statements in Malaysian ringgit. 
Aidan Malaysia’s business is based on importing subcomponents from Ireland, priced 
in euros, and completing final assembly in Malaysia, after which it prices its products in 
Malaysian ringgit based on the converted euro cost structure.
■ Aidan Ireland. This is the wholly owned domestic subsidiary of Aidan Corporation. As 
an Irish subsidiary and business, it maintains all its financial statements in euros. Like 
many Ireland-based businesses, it does on occasion purchase from and sell to other in￾ternational businesses. Some of these purchases or sales are denominated in foreign cur￾rency. For those transactions, any change in the value of the transaction as a result of 
currency changes between the date of booking and settlement is recorded as a foreign 
exchange gain or loss. This was covered in detail in Chapter 10.
■ Aidan Turkey. Aidan Turkey is a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of Aidan Corpora￾tion. As a European business (located in Turkey), it maintains its financial statement in 
Turkish lira. Aidan Turkey’s business is distinctly separate from Aidan Corporation, as it 
purchases, sells, and prices in the European marketplace.
Given Aidan Corporation’s structure and operations, we now set the stage for under￾standing translation practices in Ireland with the following set of critical definitions.
Reporting Currency. The reporting currency is the currency that the reporting entity uses 
to prepare its financial statements and for consolidated reporting. In the case of Aidan, this is 
the euro. Any other currency used by an entity of this same multinational firm in its financial 
statements is a foreign currency. For Aidan, this would include the Malaysian ringgit and the 
Turkish lira.
Foreign Entity. Any distinct or separable business that prepares its financial statements in 
any currency other than the reporting currency of the parent company is considered a foreign 
entity. A reporting entity must identify those foreign entities that maintain their statements in 
foreign currency for translation purposes. For Aidan Corporation—the reporting entity—this 
means that Aidan Malaysia and Aidan Turkey are foreign entities. Since Aidan Ireland is an 
Ireland-based business, and maintains its financial statements in the company’s reporting cur￾rency, the euro, it is not a foreign entity, and its financial statements do not require translation.
Distinct and Separable Operation. This is a characterization of the relationship of the 
foreign subsidiary with that of the parent company. If the foreign subsidiary operates as an 
extension of the parent company’s operations (e.g., a foreign distributor of the parent com￾pany’s products—products manufactured by the parent company at home), it is classified as 
an integrated foreign entity. If the foreign subsidiary operates completely separately from the 
parent company (e.g., a company acquired by the parent company in a different business than 
the parent company, with little intracompany transactions), it is classified as a distinct or sepa￾rable operation. For Aidan Corporation, Aidan Turkey is considered a distinct and separable 
operation, while Aidan Malaysia is considered an integrated foreign entity for translation 
purposes.
Functional Currency. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which a distinct entity operates. The functional currency of a foreign entity 
may or may not be the same as the currency of the country of operation. For example, the 
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 355 08/05/23 9:23 AM356 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
functional currency of Aidan’s Malaysian subsidiary is actually the euro, not the Malaysian 
ringgit. This is the case since the Malaysian subsidiary purchases the majority of its inputs 
priced and denominated in euros, as well as selling products whose prices are based on euro 
prices.
Foreign Currency Financial Statements. All incorporated businesses will possess all 
three traditional financial statements—the income statement, balance sheet, and statement 
of cash flows. However, only two of these statements need to be translated for consolidation 
purposes: the income statement and the balance sheet. (Statements of cash flow are not trans￾lated from the foreign subsidiaries. The consolidated statement of cash flow is constructed 
from the consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet.) Consolidation 
will then require the translation of these foreign currency financial statements into the re￾porting currency of the parent company.
Remeasurement and Translation
Consolidated reporting and the preparation of financial statements of a multinational firm 
into the reporting currency is conducted along two distinctly separate procedures—and they 
have their own very specific terminology. The method applicable to an individual foreign en￾tity is based on the characterization of the foreign entity and its financial statements.
Foreign Currency Measurement (Remeasurement). If a foreign entity’s functional 
currency is the reporting currency (the currency of the parent company used for consolidated 
reporting purposes), the process for preparing the financial statements is termed remeasure￾ment. This is the process by which a foreign entity expresses transactions whose terms are 
denominated in a foreign currency in its functional currency.
For example, Aidan Malaysia was described as having the euro as its functional currency, 
the same currency as Aidan Corporation’s reporting currency. Any transactions whose terms 
are denominated in a currency other than the euro, such as the Malaysian ringgit, must be 
remeasured for consolidation purposes. Any changes arising from remeasurement are in￾cluded in the consolidated net income of the company. They are therefore treated as foreign 
exchange gains and losses like transaction exposures described in Chapter 10.
Foreign Currency Translation. If a foreign entity’s financial statements are maintained in 
a functional currency, and that functional currency is different from the reporting currency of 
the parent company, the process for preparation of the financial statements is termed transla￾tion. In our example, Aidan Turkey’s functional currency is the Turkish lira. It will then fol￾low the practice of translation to prepare its financial statements in the reporting currency, 
the euro. Any changes arising from translation are included in an equity account, cumulative 
translation adjustment (CTA), a component of other comprehensive income.
The real significance of translation exposure today for multinational firms is the 
way in which changes arising from the translation are included. Since remeasurement 
changes are included in consolidated net income—earnings and earnings per share—they 
may alter these widely reported and watched financial results of publicly traded com￾panies. Changes arising from translation, however, affecting consolidated equity via the 
CTA account, are rarely noted in the business press. Measurement of performance inside 
the multinational is, however, sometimes altered by translation, as discussed in Global 
Finance in Practice 11.1
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 356 08/05/23 9:23 AMCHAPTER 11 Translation Exposure 357
11.2 Translation Methods
Two basic methods for translation are employed worldwide: the current rate method and the 
temporal method. Regardless of which method is employed, a translation method must des￾ignate at what exchange rate individual balance sheet and income statement items are re￾measured and also where any imbalance is to be recorded, either in current income or in an 
equity reserve account in the balance sheet.
Current Rate Method
The current rate method of translation—known simply as “translation” in U.S. accounting and 
translation practices—is the most prevalent in the world today. Under this method, all finan￾cial statement line items are translated at the “current” exchange rate with few exceptions.
■ Assets and Liabilities. All assets and liabilities are translated at the current rate of ex￾change; that is, at the rate of exchange in effect on the date of the balance sheet.
■ Income Statement Items. All items, including depreciation and cost of goods sold, are 
translated either at the actual exchange rate on the dates the various revenues, expenses, 
gains, and losses were incurred or at an appropriately weighted average exchange rate 
for the period.
■ Distributions. Dividends paid are translated at the exchange rate in effect on the date 
of payment.
■ Equity Items. Common stock and paid-in capital accounts are translated at historical 
rates. Year-end retained earnings consist of the original year-beginning retained earnings 
plus any income/(loss) for the year.
Gains or losses caused by translation adjustments are not included in the calculation 
of consolidated net income. Rather, translation gains or losses are reported separately and 
accumulated in a separate equity reserve account (on the consolidated balance sheet) with 
a title such as “cumulative translation adjustment” (CTA), but it depends on the country. 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 11.1
Over time the German business unit was structurally 
altered and integrated with the U.S. parent company. The 
German unit increasingly sourced inputs from the U.S. in U.S. 
dollars. At the same time, the German business unit’s sales 
were expanded to Eastern Europe and the Middle East, with 
increasing currency cash inflows shifting from the euro to the 
dollar. The company’s auditors recommended that the func￾tional currency be changed from the euro to the U.S. dollar.
When the management team of the German business 
unit analyzed how their performance would be measured by 
the change in functional currency, their performance as mea￾sured was weaker, and the result could potentially lower their 
raises or bonuses. Corporate allowed the functional currency 
to remain the euro for two years despite the objections of 
the company’s auditors. Finally, in the third year, the auditor 
threatened to not sign off on the company’s financials unless 
the designation was changed. The auditor won.
Functional Currency and Management 
Performance
Multinational financial management, as is the case with all 
areas of business management, is influenced by the various 
measures used to evaluate and reward leadership in the or￾ganization. This has in specific cases included translation—
specifically the choice of functional currency of a foreign 
subsidiary.
A number of years ago, a U.S.-based multinational 
electronics firm (to remain nameless) acquired an electron￾ics firm in Germany. Initially the German business was totally 
unrelated to the U.S. firm in terms of operations and cash 
flows. In addition, the currency dominating both cash inflows 
and outflows was the local currency, the euro. The functional 
currency designation was therefore the euro, and the current 
rate method of translation was applied.
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 357 08/05/23 9:23 AM358 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
If a foreign subsidiary is later sold or liquidated, translation gains or losses of past years ac￾cumulated in the CTA account are reported as one component of the total gain or loss on 
sale or liquidation. The total gain or loss is reported as part of the net income or loss for the 
period in which the sale or liquidation occurs.
Temporal Method
Under the temporal method, specific assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates 
consistent with the timing of those item’s creation. The temporal method assumes that a num￾ber of individual line item assets, such as inventory and net plant and equipment, are restated 
regularly to reflect market value. If these items were not restated but were instead carried at 
historical cost, the temporal method becomes the monetary/nonmonetary method of trans￾lation, a form of translation that is still used by a number of countries today. Line items as￾sumed under the temporal method to be restated regularly include the following:
■ Monetary assets and monetary liabilities. Monetary assets (primarily cash, marketable 
securities, accounts receivable, and long-term receivables) and monetary liabilities (pri￾marily current liabilities and long-term debt) are translated at current exchange rates. 
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities (primarily inventory and fixed assets) are translated 
at historical rates.
■ Income statement items. These are translated at the average exchange rate for the period, 
except for items such as depreciation and cost of goods sold that are directly associated 
with nonmonetary assets or liabilities. These accounts are translated at their historical rate.
■ Distributions. Dividends paid are translated at the exchange rate in effect on the date of 
payment.
■ Equity items. Common stock and paid-in capital accounts are translated at historical rates. 
Year-end retained earnings consist of the original year-beginning retained earnings plus 
or minus any income or loss for the year, plus or minus any imbalance from translation.
Under the temporal method, gains or losses resulting from remeasurement are car￾ried directly to current consolidated income, and not to equity reserves. Hence, foreign ex￾change gains and losses arising from remeasurement may introduce volatility to consolidated 
earnings.
U.S. Translation Procedures
The United States differentiates foreign subsidiaries based on functional currency. The pri￾mary principles of U.S. translation are summarized as follows:
■ If the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company are maintained in 
U.S. dollars, then translation is not required.
■ If the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary are maintained in the local currency 
and the local currency is the functional currency, then they are translated using the cur￾rent rate method.
■ If the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary are maintained in the local currency 
and the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, then they are remeasured using the tempo￾ral method.
■ If the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are maintained in the local currency 
and neither the local currency nor the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, then the 
statements must first be remeasured into the functional currency by the temporal method 
and then translated into dollars using the current rate method.
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 358 08/05/23 9:23 AMCHAPTER 11 Translation Exposure 359
U.S. translation practices in the form of a decision-based flow chart are summarized in 
Exhibit 11.2. A final note, however, is important. The selection of the functional currency is 
determined by the economic realities of the subsidiary’s operations and is not a discretionary 
management decision on preferred procedures or elective outcomes. Since many U.S.-based 
multinationals have numerous foreign subsidiaries, some dollar-functional and some foreign 
currency-functional, currency gains and losses may be passing through both current consoli￾dated income and/or accruing in equity reserves.1
International Translation Practices
The accounting guidance for foreign currency reporting and translation issues in the U.S. is 
found in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification 
(ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters. A large part of the rest of the world, however—
more than 100 countries—uses International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The accounting guidance for foreign currency translation under IFRS is contained in 
Standard (IAS) 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, and IAS 29, Financial 
Reporting in Hyperinflation Countries. The good news is they are quite similar in most as￾pects of foreign currency translation.
There are, however, a number of differences that bear noting. The first difference is purely 
vocabulary. Whereas the U.S. categorizes foreign entities as either integrated or distinct/sepa￾rable, international standards use integrated or self-sustaining. Their definitions remain the 
same. An integrated foreign entity is one that operates as an extension of the parent company, 
with cash flows and general business lines that are highly interrelated with those of the par￾ent. A self-sustaining foreign entity is one that operates in the local economic environment 
independent of the parent company.

local currency functional, 12% are dollar functional (currency of parent), and 23% are a mixture of the two.
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 359 08/05/23 9:23 AM360 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
Exhibit 11.3 provides a short summary of the two major differences between U.S. GAAP 
based translation and IFRS translation that are of more significance: (1) determination of 
functional currency and (2) treatment in economies and currencies suffering hyperinflation. 
The U.S. requires that a variety of indicators—cash flow, sales price, sales market, expense, 
financing, and intercompany transactions and arrangements—“be considered both individu￾ally and collectively when determining the functional currency.” This can on occasion result 
in differences of opinion both inside and outside firms regarding the functional currency for a 
specific foreign entity. This is not the case under IFRS, as it establishes a hierarchy of indica￾tors that are clearly more deterministic.
The second significant difference is how to treat and translate the financial statements 
of a foreign entity resident in a country suffering hyperinflation. U.S. translation practices 
require that remeasurement be used in cases of a highly inflationary environment—a coun￾try where cumulative inflation has been 100% or more over a three-year period. The logic 
behind the U.S. practice is that a currency suffering such a high rate of inflation is not stable 
enough to operate as a true functional currency. As described in Exhibit 11.3, IFRS standards 
largely allow the use of the traditional functional currency definition even in what it terms 
hyperinflationary instances. The U.S. directive, which preceded the formation of IFRS stan￾dards by many years, reflected the concerns of the time (the early 1980s) when inflation was 
prevalent even in the largest of industrial economies. This is not the case today.
11.3 Aidan Corporation’s Translation Exposure
Using Aidan Corporation as detailed in Exhibit 11.1, we now explore the intricacies of trans￾lation exposure arising from the preparation of the functional currency versions of the in￾come statements and balance sheets of Aidan’s foreign entities.
Translation Exposure: Income
Aidan Corporation’s sales and earnings, by operating unit for 2014 and 2015, are described 
in Exhibit 11.4. For 2015, the company generated €400 million in sales in its Irish unit, 
€143.3 million in its Turkish subsidiary ( 900 million at 6.28/€), and €108.9 million

Determination of 
Functional Currency
International standards establishes a hierar￾chy of indicators (primary and secondary) for 
determination of functional currency.
U.S. practices require analysis of a multitude 
of factors to determine the functional 
currency. These indicators are not ranked 
in any kind of a hierarchical structure.
Hyperinflationary 
Economies
Even if the entity’s host country economy 
qualifies as hyperinflationary, the functional 
currency is retained.
If the entity’s host country economy 
qualifies as hyperinflationary, financial state￾ments are remeasured as if the 
parent company’s reporting currency 
was the functional currency.
Any financial amounts that are not already 
measured at the current rate of exchange at 
the end of the period should be indexed us￾ing a general price index and then translated 
into the reporting currency at the current rate.
Any exchange rate differences calculated 
through remeasurement are therefore 
included in consolidated net income.

in its Malaysian subsidiary (MYR500 million at MYR4.59/€). Total global sales for 2010 
were €652.2 million. This constituted sales growth of 3.0% over 2014.
The company’s earnings (profits) fell in 2015, dropping to €64.7 million from €65.2 mil￾lion in 2014. Although not a large drop, the Irish stock market would not react favorably to a 
fall in consolidated earnings.
A closer look at the sales and earnings by country, however, yields some interesting in￾sights. Sales and earnings in the Irish unit rose, sales growing 7.1% and earnings growing 1.4%. 
Since the Irish unit makes up more than half of the company’s total sales and profits, this is very 
important. The Malaysian subsidiary’s sales and earnings were identical in 2014 and 2015 when 
measured in local currency, Malaysian ringgit. The ringgit, however, was revalued against the 
euro, from MYR4.68 = €1.00 to MYR4.59 = €1.00. The result was an increase in the euro value 
of both Malaysian sales and profits.
The Turkish subsidiary’s financial results are even more striking. In Turkish lira, sales and 
earnings in Turkey grew from 2014 to 2015. Sales grew 1.7% while earnings increased 1.0%. 
But the euro depreciated against the dollar, falling from 5.78 = €1.00 to 6.28 = €1.00. This 
depreciation of 8.7% resulted in the financial results of European operations falling in euro 
terms. As a result, Aidan’s consolidated earnings (in euros) fell in 2015. One can imagine the 
discussion and debate within Aidan, and among the analysts who follow the firm, over the fall 
in earnings reported to Euronext Dublin.
Translation Exposure: Balance Sheet
Let us continue the example of Aidan, focusing here on the balance sheet of its Turkish sub￾sidiary. We previously described Aidan Turkey as being self-sustaining and therefore subject 
to the current rate method. However, in this section we illustrate translation by both the 
temporal method and the current rate method in order to show the arbitrary nature of a 
translation gain or loss. The functional currency of Aidan Turkey is the Turkish lira, and the 
reporting currency of its parent, Aidan Corporation, is the euro.
Our analysis assumes that plant and equipment and long-term debt were acquired and 
that common stock was issued by Aidan Turkey sometime in the past when the exchange 
rate was 5.2760 = €1.00. Inventory currently on hand was purchased or manufactured

during the immediately prior quarter when the average exchange rate was 5.2180 = €1.00. 
At the close of business on Monday, December 31, 2015, the current spot exchange rate was 
5.2000 = €1.00. When business reopened on January 3, 2016, after the New Year holiday, the 
Turkish lira had dropped in value versus the euro to 6.0000 = €1.00.
Current Rate Method. Exhibit 11.5 illustrates translation loss using the current rate 
method. Assets and liabilities on the pre-depreciation balance sheet are translated at the cur￾rent exchange rate of 5.2000 = €1.00. Capital stock is translated at the historical rate of 
5.2760 = €1.00, and retained earnings are translated at a composite rate that is equivalent to 
having each past year’s addition to retained earnings translated at the exchange rate in effect 
that year. The sum of retained earnings and the CTA account must “balance” the liabilities and 
net worth section of the balance sheet with the asset side. For this example, we have assumed 
the two amounts used for the December 31 balance sheet. As shown in Exhibit 11.5, the “just 
before depreciation” dollar translation reports an accumulated translation loss from prior peri￾ods of €29,918. This balance is the cumulative gain or loss from translating euro statements into 
dollars in prior years.
After the depreciation, Aidan Corporation translates assets and liabilities at the new ex￾change rate of 6.0000 = €1.00. Equity accounts, including retained earnings, are translated just 
as they were before depreciation, and as a result, the cumulative translation loss increases to 
€1,836,748. The increase of €1,806,830 in this account (from a cumulative loss of €29,918 to a new 
cumulative loss of €1,836,748) is the translation loss measured by the current rate method.
This translation loss is a decrease in equity, measured in the parent’s reporting currency, 
of “net exposed assets.” An exposed asset is an asset whose value drops with the depreciation

of the functional currency and rises with an appreciation of that currency. Net exposed assets 
in this context are exposed assets minus exposed liabilities. Net exposed assets are positive 
(“long”) if exposed assets exceed exposed liabilities. They are negative (“short”) if exposed 
assets are less than exposed liabilities.
Temporal Method. Translation of the same accounts under the temporal method shows 
the arbitrary nature of any gain or loss from translation. This is illustrated in Exhibit 11.6. 
Monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the pre-depreciation Turkish lira balance sheet 
are translated at the current rate of exchange, but other assets and the equity accounts are 
translated at their historic rates. For Aidan Turkey, the historical rate for inventory differs 
from that for net plant and equipment because inventory was acquired more recently.
Under the temporal method, translation losses are not accumulated in a separate equity 
account. Instead, they are passed directly through each quarter’s income statement. Thus, in 
the euro balance sheet, translated before depreciation, retained earnings were the cumulative 
result of earnings from all prior years, translated at historical rates in effect each year, plus 
translation gains or losses from all prior years. In Exhibit 11.6, no translation loss appears in 
the pre-depreciation Turkish lira balance sheet because any losses would have been closed to 
retained earnings.
The effect of the depreciation is to create an immediate translation loss of €297,435. This 
amount is shown as a separate line item in Exhibit 11.6 to focus attention on it for this ex￾ample. Under the temporal method, this translation loss of €297,435 would pass through the in￾come statement, reducing reported net income and reducing retained earnings. Ending retained 
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 363 08/05/23 9:23 AM364 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
earnings would, in fact, be €11,826,438 minus €297,435, or €11,529,003. Whether gains and losses 
pass through the income statement under the temporal method depends upon the country.
In the case of Aidan, the translation gain or loss is larger under the current rate method 
because inventory and net property, plant, and equipment, as well as all monetary assets, are 
deemed exposed. When net exposed assets are larger, gains or losses from translation are also 
larger. If management expects a foreign currency to depreciate, it could minimize translation 
exposure by reducing net exposed assets. If management anticipates an appreciation of the 
foreign currency, it should increase net exposed assets to benefit from a gain. Depending on 
the accounting method, management might select different assets and liabilities for reduction 
or increase. Thus, “real” decisions about investing and financing might be dictated by which 
accounting technique is used, when, in fact, accounting impacts should be neutral. And as il￾lustrated in Global Finance in Practice 11.2, transaction/translation exposures may become 
intertwined in subsidiary valuation.
11.4 Managing Translation Exposure
Covering P&L translation risk is more complex to hedge and therefore not done by cor￾porates to the same extent as transactional risk,” says Francois Masquelier, chairman of the 
Association of Corporate Treasurers of Luxembourg. “Of course, reported earnings can 
have positive or negative effects depending on what the currency does vis-à-vis your func￾tional currency. If you have losses in the US then it can reduce those losses (when USD is 
weaker versus EUR), but if you have profit it can reduce that contribution to the earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and therefore your net profit.
—“Translation Risk Hits Corporate Earnings,” FX Week, May 9, 2014.
Translation exposure poses risks to both consolidated income and consolidated equity. Although 
many multinationals regularly manage the risks arising from balance sheets—net equity in￾vestment in subsidiaries—a number of firms have also hedged the risks to their consolidated 
income arising from subsidiary earnings. We begin our discussion with subsidiary earnings.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 11.2
to INR. The value of assets will also change on a year-on-year 
basis for Tata Motors (in Indian rupees term) depending on 
the direction in which the INR/GBP exchange rate has moved 
over the same period. In the consolidated annual reports, 
the effect of such translation on the asset value are recorded 
separately as “translation adjustments” to make comparison 
across periods easier.
Subsidiary Earnings
The total revenue of JLR in 2022 was GBP18,320 million (JLR 
Annual statement March 31, 2022). While including this in the 
group’s annual reports, Tata Motors again needed an exchange 
rate to convert this revenue stream from GBP to INR. This makes 
the revenue valuation subject to changes in the exchange rate. 
If the individual subsidiary constitutes a relatively significant ma￾terial component of the consolidated statement, such changes 
may significantly affect the firm’s reported income and earnings 
per share (EPS) purely because of translation.
Value of a Foreign Subsidiary: Tata Motors and 
Jaguar Land Rover
The Indian multinational automotive manufacturer, Tata 
Motors acquired the British luxury carmaker Jaguar Land 
Rover (JLR) in 2008 for a net consideration of $2.3 billion. JLR 
was subsequently valued at $18.8 billion in 2022. Changes in 
the value of a subsidiary for a multinational arise out of two 
components—changes in the value of assets and changes in 
the value of earnings.

Subsidiary Earnings
Multinational companies that generate large proportions of their profits offshore are par￾ticularly exposed to the currency risks associated with translation of subsidiary earnings. As 
demonstrated previously with Aidan’s global results of sales and earnings in Exhibit 11.4, 
translation can result in volatility in earnings, which for publicly traded companies is a prob￾lem for share prices.
In principle, many investors both understand and accept the income risks of a multina￾tional company generating earnings in a multitude of non-reporting currencies. It may in 
fact be desirable by the investor and therefore part of the multinational firm’s attraction. 
Multinationals that carry significant subsidiary earnings exposure—for example, a firm like 
Toyota (Japan), which regularly generates more than 80% of its profits offshore—are very 
clear and detailed at “stripping” currency impacts out of investor presentations on periodic 
results. (This is what was shown previously in Exhibit 11.4 where the change in an individual 
subsidiary’s sales and earnings is separated from the change in the relevant exchange rate.) 
The combination of transparency and acceptance has dominated, with few firms attempting 
to manage translation exposure of subsidiary earnings.
A few companies—for example, Coca-Cola and Goodyear, to name two—have in 
the past hedged subsidiary profits with financial derivatives.2
 This requires forecasting 
subsidiary earnings far enough out into the future—for example, 12 to 18 months—to 
provide material protection. But earnings result from the interplay of a multitude of 
individual exposures and transactions, making forecasting earnings difficult to say the 
least. Many firms do frequently hedge dividends declared from the subsidiary to the par￾ent company when declared in a foreign currency. This reduces the non-hedged earnings 
significantly on their own.
The final drawback to hedging subsidiary earnings is accounting treatment. Under cur￾rent financial accounting standards, the hedging of foreign subsidiary earnings does not qual￾ify for hedge accounting. (Hedge accounting is detailed in Global Finance in Practice 11.3.) 
The primary objection to their qualification is, as we pointed out previously, the difficulty 
in forecasting their probable values. This means that financial derivatives like forward con￾tracts and currency options, purchased as hedges for subsidiary earnings, must be re-valued 
(“marked-to-market”) on a regular reporting basis, independent of the exposure itself. This 
means that the periodic valuation of the financial derivatives (the hedges) ends up impacting 
reporting earnings more often than the underlying exposure (the foreign subsidiary earn￾ings). If a firm is attempting to hedge subsidiary earnings a year into the future, hedging could 
give rise to more earnings volatility rather than less.
Net Equity Investment
The main technique to minimize translation exposure is called a balance sheet hedge. At times, 
some firms have attempted to hedge translation exposure in the forward market. Such action 
amounts to speculating in the forward market in the hope that a cash profit will be realized 
to offset the noncash loss from translation. Success depends on a precise prediction of future 
exchange rates, for such a hedge will be effective over a range of possible future spot rates. In 
addition, the profit from the forward “hedge” (i.e., speculation) is taxable, but the translation 
loss does not reduce taxable income.
A balance sheet hedge requires an equal amount of exposed foreign currency assets and lia￾bilities on a firm’s consolidated balance sheet. If this can be achieved for each foreign currency, 
2
 Surveys of corporate hedging practices typically find only 10% to 15% of firms surveyed actively hedge net invest￾ment risk or foreign earnings.
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 365 08/05/23 9:23 AM366 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
net translation exposure will be zero. A change in exchange rates will change the value of ex￾posed liabilities in an equal amount but in a direction opposite to the change in value of ex￾posed assets. If a firm translates by the temporal method, a zero net exposed position is called 
“monetary balance.” Complete monetary balance cannot be achieved under the current rate 
method because total assets would have to be matched by an equal amount of debt, but the 
equity section of the balance sheet must still be translated at historic exchange rates.
The cost of a balance sheet hedge depends on relative borrowing costs. If foreign currency 
borrowing costs, after adjusting for foreign exchange risk, are higher than parent currency bor￾rowing costs, the balance sheet hedge is costly, and vice versa. Normal operations, however, 
already require decisions about the magnitude and currency denomination of specific balance 
sheet accounts. Thus, balance sheet hedges are a compromise in which the denomination of 
balance sheet accounts is altered, perhaps at a cost in terms of interest expense or operating 
efficiency, in order to achieve some degree of foreign exchange protection.
To achieve a balance sheet hedge, Aidan Corporation must either (1) reduce exposed 
Turkish lira assets without simultaneously reducing Turkish lira liabilities or (2) increase 
euro liabilities without simultaneously increasing euro assets. One way to achieve this is to 
exchange existing Turkish lira cash for euros. If Aidan Turkey does not have large Turkish lira 
cash balances, it can borrow Turkish lira and exchange the borrowed Turkish lira for euros. 
Another subsidiary could also borrow Turkish lira and exchange them for euros. That is, the 
essence of the hedge is for the parent or any of its subsidiaries to create Turkish lira debt and 
exchange the proceeds for euros.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 11.3
company’s equity account, not impacting earnings, by 
deferring recognition until the transaction occurs.
2. Fair Value Hedge. A fair value hedge may be desig￾nated for a firm commitment (not recorded) or foreign 
currency cash flows of a recognized asset or liability. 
Hedge accounting allows marking-to-market an asset 
or liability (that which is being hedged), matching it to 
the fluctuation in value of the financial derivative hedge, 
neutralizing the impact on earnings.
3. Net Investment Hedge. A net investment hedge may 
be designated for the net investment in a foreign sub￾sidiary or operation. Hedge accounting allows match￾ing the fluctuation in earnings arising from the translation 
loss with the fluctuation in value arising from the hedge, 
whether it be a financial derivative or a debt instrument.
There are, of course, a number of very specific require￾ments that must be met in order to use hedge accounting, 
including proper designation as a firm commitment, a highly 
probable forecasted transaction, and hedge effectiveness. A 
firm commitment is a binding agreement for the exchange 
of a specified quantity of resources at a specified price on a 
specified future date (or dates). A forecasted transaction is an 
uncommitted but highly probable future transaction. Hedge 
effectiveness is the requirement that the hedge will offset be￾tween 80% and 125% of the fluctuation in the value of the 
exposure.
Foreign Currency Hedge Accounting
One of the primary objectives of foreign currency hedging 
is to reduce losses or fluctuations in company earnings or 
cash flows caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
Frequently this is achieved through the use of financial deriva￾tives. Accounting practices, however, do not always match 
this objective. The primary problem is mark-to-market (MTM) 
accounting, in which the value of the exposure and the value 
of the financial derivative hedging the exposure are valued at 
the end of a reporting period—prior to the maturity of the ex￾posure/hedge. Depending on the exposure and the financial 
derivative, their MTM valuation may introduce more volatility, 
not less, to reported earnings.
The purpose of hedge accounting is to associate the 
exposure and the hedge so that fluctuations in value in one 
offset the fluctuations in value of the other—to treat them as 
one. Accounting standards have established hedge account￾ing for three different categories of foreign exchange hedges:
1. Cash Flow Hedge. A cash flow hedge may be des￾ignated for a highly probable forecasted transaction, a 
firm commitment (a transaction not yet recorded on the 
balance sheet), foreign currency cash flows of a rec￾ognized asset or liability, or a forecasted intercompany 
transaction. Hedge accounting allows the recording of 
fluctuations in the value of the financial derivative in a 
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 366 08/05/23 9:23 AMCHAPTER 11 Translation Exposure 367
Current Rate Method. Under the current rate method, Aidan should borrow as much as 
68,000,000. The initial effect of this first step is to increase both an exposed asset (cash) and 
an exposed liability (notes payable) on the balance sheet of Aidan Turkey, with no immedi￾ate effect on net exposed assets. The required follow-up step can take two forms: (1) Aidan 
Turkey could exchange the acquired Turkish lira for euros and hold those euros itself, or 
(2) it could transfer the borrowed Turkish lira to Aidan Corporation, perhaps as a Turkish lira 
dividend or as repayment of intracompany debt. Aidan Corporation could then exchange the 
Turkish lira for euros.
An alternative would be for Aidan Corporation or a sister subsidiary to borrow the 
Turkish lira, thus keeping the Turkish lira debt entirely off Aidan’s books. However, the second 
step is still essential to eliminate Turkish lira exposure; the borrowing entity must exchange 
the Turkish lira for euros or other unexposed assets. Any such borrowing should be coordi￾nated with all other euro borrowings to avoid the possibility that one subsidiary is borrowing 
Turkish lira to reduce translation exposure at the same time as another subsidiary is repaying 
Turkish lira debt. (Note that euros can be “borrowed” by simply delaying repayment of exist￾ing Turkish lira debt; the goal is to increase Turkish lira debt, not to borrow in a literal sense.)
Temporal Method. If translation is by the temporal method, the much smaller amount of 
only 6,800,000 need be borrowed. As before, Aidan Turkey could use the proceeds of the 
loan to acquire euros. However, Aidan Turkey could also use the proceeds to acquire inven￾tory or fixed assets in Turkey. Under the temporal method, these assets are not regarded as 
exposed and do not drop in dollar value when the Turkish lira depreciates.
When Is a Balance Sheet Hedge Justified?
If a firm’s subsidiary is using the local currency as the functional currency, the following cir￾cumstances could justify the use of a balance sheet hedge:
■ The foreign subsidiary is about to be liquidated, so that value of its CTA would be real￾ized.
■ The firm has debt covenants or bank agreements that require the firm’s debt/equity ra￾tios to be maintained within specific limits.
■ Management is evaluated based on certain income statement and balance sheet mea￾sures that are affected by translation losses or gains.
■ The foreign subsidiary is operating in a hyperinflationary environment.
If a firm is using the parent’s home currency as the functional currency of the for￾eign subsidiary, all transaction gains/losses are passed through to the income statement. 
Hedging this consolidated income to reduce its variability may be important to investors 
and bond rating agencies. In the end, translation exposure is a topic of great concern and 
involves complex choices for all multinational firms, including whether to hedge it at all 
and, if so, how to hedge it.
Using Cross-Currency Swaps to Hedge Translation: The Case 
of McDonald’s
McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) is one of the world’s most recognized and valuable 
brands. But as McDonald’s has grown and expanded globally, so have the investment risks as￾sociated with its investment in more than 100 countries. Like most multinational firms, it con￾siders its equity investment in foreign affiliates capital at risk—risk of loss, nationalization, 
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 367 08/05/23 9:23 AM368 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
and currency valuation. McDonald’s has been quite innovative in its hedging of these com￾bined currency risks over time, finding new ways to construct old solutions—such as Hoover 
Hedges—but doing so with cross-currency swaps.
Hoover Hedges. When a parent company like McDonald’s creates and invests in a foreign 
subsidiary, it creates an asset, its foreign investment in a foreign subsidiary, which corresponds 
to the equity investment on the balance sheet of the foreign subsidiary. But the equity invest￾ment in the foreign subsidiary is now in local currency, the currency of the foreign business 
environment. If this is the predominant currency of this subsidiary’s business, it is the func￾tional currency of the subsidiary. Then, as the exchange rate between two currencies changes, 
the parent company’s equity investment is subject to foreign exchange risk.
Many multinationals hedge this equity investment exposure with what is described as a bal￾ance sheet hedge. Since the parent company possesses a long-term asset in the foreign currency, 
the company tries to hedge this asset by creating a matching long-term liability in the same 
currency. A long-term loan in the currency of the foreign subsidiary is frequently used. The loan 
itself is often structured as a bullet repayment loan, in which interest payments are made over 
time but the entire principal is due in a single final payment—bullet—at maturity. In this way, 
the principal on the long-term loan acts as a match to the long-term equity investment.
These hedges are referred to as Hoover Hedges following the court case of Hoover 
Company versus the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The primary issue in the case was whether 
the gains and losses from short sales in foreign currency that the Hoover Company used as 
hedges were to be considered to be, for tax purposes, ordinary losses, business expenses, or 
capital losses and gains. Although borrowing in the local currency is frequently used, there 
are a number of other potential hedges of equity investments, including short sales and the 
use of traditional foreign currency derivatives like forward contracts and currency options.
McDonald’s Business Forms. McDonald’s has structured its business in a variety of dif￾ferent ways depending on the marketplace. In the U.S., the company has utilized a franchising 
structure, where it awards a franchise to a private investor. That investor then has exclusive 
rights to the sale and distribution of McDonald’s products and services within the designated 
franchise zone. McDonald’s corporation owns the land and building, but the franchisee is 
responsible for the investment in all equipment and furnishings required for the restaurant 
under the franchise agreement—“from the paint in,” as they describe it. This structure allows 
McDonald’s to expand with a lower level of capital investment (the franchisee is investing 
a significant portion) and at the same time create a financial incentive for the franchisee 
to remain focused on and committed to the restaurant’s success and profitability. In return, 
McDonald’s earns a royalty from the franchise’s sales, typically 5% to 5.5% of sales.
Alternatively, in markets where the company wishes to have more direct control and 
is willing to make substantially larger capital investments itself, McDonald’s uses the more 
common form of direct ownership. Although having to put up all the capital needed for the 
establishment of these restaurants, it gains more direct control over operations. Much of 
McDonald’s international expansion has been structured under this more common direct 
ownership approach, but at the risk of substantial amounts of capital, as the company seeks 
to gain a major presence in a growing number of countries.
The British Subsidiary and Currency Exposure. In the United Kingdom, McDonald’s 
owns the majority of its restaurants. These investments create three different British 
pound-denominated currency exposures for the parent company (detailed in Exhibit 11.7).
1. The British subsidiary has equity capital, which is a British pound-denominated asset of 
the parent company.
M11_EITE5960_16_GE_C11.indd 368 08/05/23 9:23 AMCHAPTER 11 Translation Exposure 369
2. The parent company provides intracompany debt in the form of a four-year loan. The 
loan is denominated in British pounds, and carries a fixed rate of interest.
3. The British subsidiary pays a fixed percentage of gross sales in royalties to the parent 
company. This too is pound-denominated.
An additional technical detail further complicates the situation. When the parent com￾pany makes an intracompany loan to the British subsidiary, it must designate—according to 
U.S. accounting and tax law practices—whether the loan is “permanently invested” in that 
country. Although on the surface it seems illogical to consider four years “permanent,” the 
loan itself could simply be continually rolled over by the parent company and never actually 
be repaid.
If the loan is not designated “permanent,” the foreign exchange gains and losses re￾lated to the loan flow directly to the parent company’s income statement, according to U.S. 
accounting practices, which is the primary standard for U.S. foreign currency reporting. If, 
however, the loan is designated as permanent, then the foreign exchange gains and losses 
related to the intracompany loan flow only to the cumulative translation adjustment account 
(CTA), a segment of consolidated equity on the company’s consolidated balance sheet. To 
date, McDonald’s has chosen to designate these loans as permanent. The functional currency 
of the British subsidiary for consolidation purposes is the local currency, the British pound.
Cross-Currency Swap Hedging. McDonald’s has in the past hedged its rather complex 
British pound exposure by entering into a U.S. dollar–British pound sterling cross-currency 
swap. The swaps may be of differing longer and longer maturities and are agreements to 
receive dollars and pay pounds. Like all cross-currency swaps, the agreement requires 
McDonald’s (U.S.) to make regular pound-denominated interest payments and a bullet prin￾cipal repayment (notional principal) at the end of the swap agreement.
The cross-currency swap serves as a hedge of both the regular royalty and interest pay￾ments in British pounds made to the U.S. parent, and the outstanding swap notional princi￾pal in British pounds serves as a hedge of the equity investment by McDonald’s U.S. in the 
British subsidiary. According to accounting practice, a company may elect to take the interest 
associated with a foreign currency-denominated loan and carry that directly to the parent 
company’s consolidated income. This has been done in the past, and McDonald’s benefited 
from the inclusion.

Because the British subsidiary makes all payments to the U.S. parent company in British pounds, McDonald’s U.S. is long British
pounds. By entering into a swap to pay pounds (£) and receive dollars ($), the swap creates an outflow of £ serviced by the $ inflows.
But the cross-currency swap has one additional major feature useful to McDonald’s: the cross-currency swap has a large principal
which is outstanding (bullet repayment) which acts as a counterweight—a match—to the long-term investment in the UK subsidiary.

Summary Points
■ Translation exposure results from translating foreign 
currency-denominated statements of foreign subsid￾iaries into the parent’s reporting currency to prepare 
consolidated financial statements.
■ A foreign subsidiary’s functional currency is the domi￾nant currency used by that foreign subsidiary in its 
day-to-day operations.
■ Technical aspects of translation include questions 
about when to recognize gains or losses, the distinction 
between functional and reporting currency, and the 
treatment of subsidiaries in hyperinflation countries.
■ Translation gains and losses can be quite different 
from operating gains and losses, not only in magnitude 
but also in direction. Management may need to deter￾mine which is of greater significance prior to deciding 
which exposure is to be managed first.
■ The main technique for managing translation expo￾sure is a balance sheet hedge. This calls for having an 
equal amount of exposed foreign currency assets and 
liabilities.
■ Even if management chooses to follow an active policy 
of hedging translation exposure, it is nearly impossible 
to offset both transaction and translation exposure si￾multaneously. If forced to choose, most managers will 
protect against transaction losses because they impact 
consolidated earnings.
MINI-CASE
Electrolux of Sweden’s Currency 
Management3
If you were to create a company that’s emblematic of 
the global economy, it might look a lot like Electrolux. 
It’s based in Sweden, but holds its board meetings in 
English, the world’s common language. Top managers 
come from countries that include Brazil, Jamaica and 
Germany.
—“Straberg’s Strategy: Cutting Costs Led Electrolux to 
Memphis,” The Commercial Appeal, Sept 18, 2011.
Electrolux of Sweden was one of the world’s premier ap￾pliance manufacturers. But it operated in an industry that 
was intensely competitive, the result of which was histori￾cally slim profit margins. Given this focus on managing 
costs and operational excellence, currency losses could 
potentially be devastating to profitability and shareholder 
value. Electrolux had established a highly structured cur￾rency exposure management program to protect those val￾ued but slim profit margins.
Electrolux
AB Electrolux (OMB: ELUX B; ADR: ELUXY), head￾quartered in Stockholm, Sweden, started life as a kerosene 
lamp company called AB Lux in 1901. In 1919, in a new 
combination of companies, its name was changed to Ele￾ktrolux and eventually Electrolux. By 2016 it was selling 
products in 150 countries.
As illustrated in Exhibit A, Electrolux’s financial re￾sults had been extremely steady over the past 16 years. Al￾though sales had been lower every year since 2001, they 
had stabilized and showed glimmers of growth in recent 
years. Despite the intense competition and race to reduce 
costs globally, Electrolux had made a profit in every year, 
averaging about 2.13% return on sales over the period (net 
income/sales). Even in the midst of the global financial cri￾sis of 2008 and 2009, the company had remained profitable.
Although the second largest appliance maker in the 
world behind Whirlpool (U.S.), Electrolux had long strug￾gled with manufacturing costs, particularly labor costs. In the 
late 1990s it had closed manufacturing facilities across West￾ern Europe (including its home country of Sweden), shifting 
significant production first to lower-labor-cost Eastern Eu￾rope and eventually to mainland China. In the process it had 
reduced global headcount by 12,000. In a series of renewed 
cuts the company had shed another 30,000 jobs worldwide 
between 2002 and 2014, moving from just 20% of its produc￾tion in low-cost countries to more than 60%. In 2016 Elec￾trolux employed 55,400 people worldwide.
Structure of Global Operations
Electrolux divided its product portfolio into three parts: 
(1) major appliances, making up 88% of global sales in 2016; 
(2) small appliances, 7% of sales; and (3) professional products, 
5% of sales. Major appliances was obviously the core of the 
business and was in turn structured into four major geographic 
segments for global operations: Europe, Middle East, and Asia 
(EMEA); North America; Latin America; and Asia/Pacific.

had a rather unique combination that presented two very 
specific currency exposure challenges.
First, although the company was Swedish by incor￾poration and financing reporting, few actual currency 
transactions involved the home currency, the Swedish 
krona (SEK). This made nearly all other currencies “for￾eign currencies.” Secondly, the growing use of Chinese 
manufacturing was shifting the company’s net currency 
exposure. The majority of purchases of Chinese manufac￾tured goods, from both Electrolux operations and other 
manufacturers, were denominated in U.S. dollars (USD), 
not Chinese renminbi (CNY). Only North American op￾erations had significant purchases from China in Chinese 
renminbi (CNY). These two forces combined in different 
As illustrated by Exhibit B, despite being a global 
company, Electrolux made most of its profits in two ma￾jor regions —North America and the EMEA. Although 
Asia/Pacific had a healthy operating margin similar to NA 
and the EMEA, the smaller level of sales in the region 
prevented its profits from having the same weight. Latin 
America, despite showing significant sales, was currently 
operating at a loss.
Global Operations and Currency Exposure
A company’s global currency exposure is a combination of 
the structure of its manufacturing and sales—operations and 
how it conducts its operations—management. Electrolux

in addition to local currency expenses and procurement. 
Foreign currency sourcing regularly generates short posi￾tions in Chinese renminbi (CNY), Thai baht (THB), and 
Mexican pesos (MXN).
Latin America. The company has manufacturing and 
sales activities in Argentina (ARS), Brazil (BRL), and Chile 
(CLP). Sales and expenses in these countries generate net 
long currency positions in each of these three host coun￾try currencies. Foreign sourcing costs are dominated by the 
USD as a result of purchasing from mainland China, with 
small amounts of specialty purchases from Europe in EUR.
Asia/Pacific. Composed primarily of Australian sales 
(long AUD), with sourcing of materials and components 
from Thailand, China, and Europe. This sourcing creates 
net short positions in the Thai baht (THB), U.S. dollar 
(USD), and euro (EUR).
Exhibit D provides a quantitative verification of these 
operating region currency exposures. This measurement pro￾vided a baseline analysis for the management of Electrolux’s 
operating exposure. The resulting net exposures as estimat￾ed by Corporate Treasury are then transferred to the region￾al or country business unit. This shifts the currency gains or 
ways to structure Electrolux’s global currency transaction 
flows, a described in Exhibit C ’s global currency map for 
the company.
Europe, Middle East, and Asia (EMEA). Electro￾lux had a large and historical base in Europe—both West￾ern Europe and Eastern Europe. Sales in the EMEA re￾gion resulted in currency earnings in U.S. dollars (USD), 
European euros (EUR), Egyptian pounds (EGP), Russian 
rubles (RUB), Swiss francs (CHF), and British pounds 
(GBP). Historically, most of EMEA sales were sourced 
from within the area, meaning material and sourcing ex￾penses were primarily denominated in euros. However, in 
the pursuit of lower and lower costs for competitiveness, 
more and more of the sourcing was shifting to mainland 
China, increasing the expenses in U.S. dollars (USD). The 
result was the EMEA annually experienced a net short 
position in the dollar and euro, with net long positions in 
all other EMEA sales currencies.
North America. Electrolux’s North American opera￾tions were more complex. Sales in the U.S. and Canada gen￾erated long positions in local currency (USD and CAD). 
Sourcing, however, was from multiple facilities globally,

losses, after hedging, to the units actually generating the ex￾posures. The company expects local business unit leadership 
to work to accommodate those currency gains and losses 
through cost reductions and price adjustments—as possible.
Currency Management
Foreign-exchange risk refers to the adverse effects of 
changes in foreign-exchange rates on the Group’s in￾come and equity. In order to manage such effects, the 
Group covers these risks within the framework of the 
Financial Policy. The Group’s overall currency exposure 
is managed centrally.
—Electrolux Annual Report, 2016, p. 70.
Risk management at Electrolux included three major areas: 
operational risks (such as market risk, pricing, customer risk, 
commodity prices, restructuring), financial risks (financing, 
interest rates, pension commitments, and foreign exchange), 
and other risks (regulatory and reputational risks).
Electrolux, like many multinationals, manages the 
global currency exposure of the company centrally. 
Monthly, using data provided by all of its operating units, 
Corporate Treasury constructs a forecast of all transaction 
currency cash flows for the coming 12-month period. This 
allows the company to compile a net inflow and outflow 
estimate for the coming year for major currencies. The 
2016 forecast and subsequent hedging positions are sum￾marized in Exhibit E.4
Exhibit E indicates that Electrolux forecasted a net 
short position (outflows to exceed inflows) in the U.S. 
dollar, European euro, Chinese renminbi, and Thai baht 
for the coming year. Corporate Treasury then selectively 
hedged these short positions, with all four currency posi￾tions still net short after hedging. These residual exposures 
are the company’s estimate of its currency exposure.
Electrolux’s Financial Policy, the official corporate 
management process used in currency management, has 
recently changed. In 2015, the policy required the hedg￾ing of 100% of exposures maturing within two months and

70% of exposures maturing within six months. This policy 
created what Electrolux considered the “hedging horizon 
of between three and eight months of forecast flows.”
In January 2016 the company adopted a new policy 
(for immediate implementation), that restricted hedging 
to invoiced exposures only. This was a significant change. 
It meant that although a unit, say Australia, regularly pur￾chased components and materials from China (in USD) 
and Thailand (in THB), if those purchases had not yet 
been invoiced (although the likelihood of the purchase 
is likely more than 80% or 90%), those anticipated expo￾sures could not be hedged using financial derivatives.5
Restricting the use of financial derivatives does not, 
however, mean the exposures were not to be managed. 
Electrolux required all the operating units to manage, 
through their regional treasury centers if appropriate, 
through natural hedges (offsetting payments in the subject 
currency), price adjustments, or cost reductions.
As part of the company’s currency management pro￾gram, Corporate Treasury regularly conducts sensitivity 
analyses on all currency exposures, simulating a 10% change 
in a specific currency pair’s impact on consolidated profits 
(global earnings). For example, a –10% change in the USD￾SEK cross rate was estimated to have a SEK 1,083 benefit 
in 2014 and a SEK 1,014 impact in 2015. Exhibit F presents 
the analysis for 2016. Sensitivity analyses such as these were 
used on a regular basis to isolate which currencies were of 
the most potential risk to corporate profitability.
Electrolux’s actual net transaction exposure by cur￾rency does not change dramatically over time. The struc￾ture of sales and manufacturing dictate the net exposure 
positions, and only strategic operating changes—like shift￾ing more and more sourcing to China—has the ability to 
alter net exposure. It is also obvious that although there 
are 14 currency positions detailed in Exhibit C, the net 
exposures in the USD and EUR are clearly largest and 
most likely dominant. It is the hedging and management 
of these major world currencies that dominate Corporate 
Treasury’s mindset. The company has learned over time 
that Electrolux’s consolidated financial performance ben￾efits from a weakening of the USD and the EUR and a 
strengthening of major net positive currency exposures as￾sociated with the BRL, GBP, CAD, and AUD.
Translation Exposure
Electrolux reports in Swedish krona, while nearly all of its 
financial results—earnings, assets, and cash flows—are gener￾ated in non-SEK currencies. This means that translation expo￾sure is a continuing challenge for the company as well. Because 
most of the company’s actual earnings—consolidated income 
and therefore the driver of earnings per share (EPS)—are 
generated out of the USD and EUR currencies, those two are 
the focus of most translation management activities.
Electrolux follows traditional translation practices as 
described in its 2016 Annual Report (p. 103):
EXHIBIT F Sensitivity Analysis of Major Currencies
A change up or down by 10% in the value of each currency versus the SEK has the following simulated impacts on 
consolidated earnings.

 There is one currency exception to the global currency management program: the CNY-USD position. Because of the complexity 
of moving money in and out of China and the difficulties in securing effective hedges on the Chinese renminbi, Electrolux Corporate 
Treasury allows a longer currency hedging outlook for the CNY-USD cross rate.

functional currency using the exchange rate prevail￾ing at the date of each transaction.
■ Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in for￾eign currencies are valued at year-end exchange rates 
and any exchange-rate differences are included in in￾come for the period, except when deferred in other 
comprehensive income for the effective part of quali￾fying net investment hedges.
■ The consolidated financial statements are presented 
in Swedish krona (SEK), which is the Parent Com￾pany’s functional and presentation currency.
■ The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are trans￾lated into SEK at year-end closing rates. The income 
statements have been translated at the average rates 
for the year. Translation differences thus arising have 
been included in other comprehensive income.
What may be of some surprise is that although nearly 
100% of the company’s consolidated earnings are subject 
to exchange rate risk from translation of income state￾ments of foreign subsidiaries into SEK, the company does 
not hedge this exposure.
MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. Which currency exposure—transaction, translation, 
or operating—is Electrolux hedging under its 2015 fi￾nancial policy? Which under its 2016 financial policy?
2. Why is Electrolux continually experiencing such a 
large short currency position in U.S. dollars? What 
could change this in the coming years?
3. Electrolux acknowledges that its consolidated earn￾ings are impacted by translation exposure but explic￾itly states that it does not hedge this exposure. Why do 
you think the company’s rationale is for this decision?

12.1 Examine how operating exposure arises in a multinational firm through unexpected 
changes in corporate cash flows
12.2 Analyze how to measure operating exposure’s impact on a business unit through 
the sequence of volume, price, cost, and other key variable changes
12.3 Evaluate strategic alternatives to managing operating exposure
12.4 Detail the proactive policies firms use in managing operating exposure
This chapter examines the economic exposure of a firm over time, what we term operating 
exposure. Operating exposure, also referred to as competitive exposure or strategic exposure, 
measures changes in present value of a firm resulting from changes in future operating cash 
flows caused by unexpected changes in exchange rates. Operating exposure analysis assesses 
the impact of changing exchange rates on a firm’s operations over months and years and on 
its competitive position vis-à-vis other firms. The goal is to identify strategic moves or operat￾ing techniques the firm might wish to adopt to enhance its value in the face of unexpected 
exchange rate changes.
Operating exposure and transaction exposure are related in that they both deal with fu￾ture cash flows. They differ in terms of the cash flows that management considers and why 
those cash flows change when exchange rates change. We begin by revisiting our firm, Aidan 
Corporation, and how its structure dictates its likely operating exposure. The chapter continues 
with a series of strategies and structures used in the management of operating exposure and 
concludes with the mini-case Brexit and Rolls-Royce, which provides a timely debate over how 
a country’s political decisions impact the operating exposure of its multinational companies.
12.1 A Multinational’s Operating Exposure
The structure and operations of a multinational company determine the nature of its operat￾ing exposure. Aidan Corporation’s basic structure and currencies of operation are described 
in Exhibit 12.1. As an Irish-based publicly traded company, ultimately all financial metrics 
and values have to be consolidated and expressed in euros. That accounting exposure of the 
firm—translation exposure—was described in Chapter 10. Operationally, however, the func￾tional currencies of the individual subsidiaries, in combination, determine the overall operat￾ing exposure of the firm in total.
The operating exposure of any individual business or business unit is the net of cash in￾flows and outflows by currency and how that compares to other companies competing in the 
same markets. Accounts receivable are the cash flow proceeds from sales, and accounts pay￾able are all ongoing operating costs associated with the purchase of labor, materials, and other

inputs. The net result—in general—is, in essence, the lifeblood of any business and the source 
of value created by the firm over time. For example, Aidan Turkey sells locally and it also 
exports, but all sales are invoiced in Turkish lira. All operating cash inflows are therefore in 
its home currency, the Turkish lira. On the cost side, labor costs and many of its material input 
purchases are local and in Turkish lira. Aidan Turkey also purchases components from Aidan 
Malaysia, but those too are invoiced in Turkish lira. Aidan Turkey is clearly Turkish lira-func￾tional, with all cash inflows and outflows in Turkish lira. Aidan Ireland is similar in structure 
to Aidan Turkey. All cash inflows from sales, domestic and international, are in euros. All 
costs, including labor and materials, sourced domestically and internationally, are invoiced 
in euros. This includes purchases from Aidan Malaysia. Aidan Ireland is, therefore, obviously 
euro functional.
Aidan Malaysia is more complex. Cash outflows, including labor and materials, are all 
domestic and paid in Malaysian ringgit. Cash inflows, however, are generated across three dif￾ferent currencies as the company sells locally in ringgit, as well as exporting to both Turkey in 
Turkish lira and Ireland in euros. On net, although having some cash inflows in both Turkish 
lira and euros, the dominant currency is the ringgit.
Static versus Dynamic Operating Exposure
Measuring the operating exposure of a firm like Aidan requires forecasting and analyzing all 
the firm’s future individual transaction exposures together with the future exposures of all 
the firm’s competitors and potential competitors worldwide. Exchange rate changes in the 
short term affect current and immediate contracts, generally termed transactions. But over 
the longer term, as prices change and competitors react, the more fundamental economic and 
competitive drivers of the business may alter all cash flows of all units.
Consider Aidan Corporation’s three operating subsidiaries—one each in Ireland, 
Malaysia, and Turkey. In 2012, the euro depreciates in the market against the Turkish lira. At 
the same time, the Malaysian government continues the gradual revaluation of the ringgit. 
The operating exposure of each individual business unit then needs to be examined statically 
(transaction exposures) and dynamically (future business transactions not yet contracted for).

Aidan Malaysia. Sales in euros will result in fewer ringgit proceeds in the immediate pe￾riod. Sales in Turkish lira may stay roughly the same in ringgit proceeds depending on the 
movement of the ringgit against the Turkish lira. General profitability will fall in the short 
run. In the longer term, depending on markets and competition, it may need to raise the price 
of exports, even to its Irish parent company.
Aidan Turkey. Since this business unit’s cash inflows and outflows are all in Turkish lira, 
there is no immediate transaction exposure or change. It may suffer some rising input costs 
in the future if Aidan Malaysia does indeed push through price increases of component sales. 
Profitability is unaffected in the short term.
Aidan Ireland. Like Aidan Turkey, Aidan Ireland has all local currency cash inflows and 
outflows. A fall in the value of the euro will have no immediate impact (transaction exposure) 
but cash flow may change over the medium to long term because input costs from Malaysia 
may rise over time as the Malaysian subsidiary tries to regain prior profit margins. But, like 
Turkey, short-term profitability is unaffected.
The net result for Aidan is possibly a fall in the total profitability of the firm in the short 
term, primarily from the fall in profits of the Malaysian subsidiary—that is, the short-term 
transaction/operating exposure impact. The fall in the euro in the short term, however, is likely 
to have a positive impact on translation exposure, as profits and earnings in ringgit and Turkish 
lira translate into more euros. Euronext Dublin prefers returns sooner rather than later.
Operating and Financing Cash Flows
The cash flows of the MNE can be divided into operating cash flows and financing cash flows.
■ Operating cash flows for Aidan arise from intercompany (between unrelated companies) 
and intracompany (between units of the same company) receivables and payables, such 
as rent and lease payments for the use of facilities and equipment, royalty and license 
fees for the use of technology and intellectual property, and assorted management fees 
for services provided.
■ Financing cash flows are payments for the use of intercompany and intracompany loans 
(principal and interest) and stockholder equity (new equity investments and dividends).
Each of these cash flows can occur at different time intervals, in different amounts, and in 
different currencies of denomination, and each has a different predictability of occurrence. 
We summarize cash flow possibilities in Exhibit 12.2 for Aidan Malaysia and Aidan Ireland.
Expected versus Unexpected Changes in Cash Flow
Operating exposure is far more important for the long-run viability of a business than 
changes caused by transaction or translation exposure. However, operating exposure is in￾evitably subjective because it depends on estimates of future cash flow changes over an 
arbitrary time horizon. Thus, it springs not from the accounting process but rather from 
operating analysis.
Planning for operating exposure is a total management responsibility and relies upon 
the interaction of strategies in finance, marketing, purchasing, and production. An expected 
change in foreign exchange rates is not included in the definition of operating exposure be￾cause both management and investors should have factored this information into their evalu￾ation of anticipated operating results and market value. An “expected change” arises from 
differing perspectives as follows:
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 380 08/05/23 9:19 AMCHAPTER 12 Operating Exposure 381
■ From a management perspective, budgeted financial statements already reflect informa￾tion about the effect of an expected change in exchange rates.
■ From a debt service perspective, expected cash flow to amortize debt should already 
reflect the international Fisher effect. The level of expected interest and principal repay￾ment should be a function of expected exchange rates rather than existing spot rates.
■ From an investor’s perspective, if the foreign exchange market is efficient, information 
about expected changes in exchange rates should be widely known and reflected in mar￾ket value. This is illustrated in Global Finance in Practice 12.1. Only unexpected changes 
in exchange rates or an inefficient foreign exchange market should cause market value 
changes.
■ From a broader macroeconomic perspective, operating exposure is not just the sensitivity 
of a firm’s future cash flows to unexpected changes in foreign exchange rates but also its 
sensitivity to other key macroeconomic variables. This factor has been labeled as macro￾economic uncertainty.

operational costs and revenue, this “operational exposure” is 
identified as having higher impact and with higher likelihood 
of occurring.
There is a reason behind this expressed requirement 
to manage exposure risk. The net forex revaluation gains/
losses reported1 by jet 2.com was a gain of £3.9 million 
in 2021 which then changed to a loss of £12.6 million in 
2022. They are expecting these losses to increase and 
have planned to take measure to hedge against this using 
a range of financial derivatives including forwards, swaps, 
and options.
Operating Exposure: Jet2.com
One of the key elements to understand the operating exposure 
is to project the expected change in the foreign exchange rates 
and measure its impact on the firm’s revenue and costs.
One of the largest holiday/travel companies in the 
United Kingdom, Jet2.com, in its 2022 Annual Report has 
clearly identified the “Operational Exposure” as one of the 
key risks. It explains that the directors are expecting signifi￾cant movement in the exchange rates between pound, euro, 
and U.S. dollar. As these currencies dominates both their

12.2 Measuring Operating Exposure
So what would be the likely impact(s) of an unexpected change in exchange rates on the 
operating cash flows of a firm? To explore this question we decompose the possible im￾pacts into intervals (as measured in the short run, medium run, and long run) and economic 
cases—price changes, volume changes, and structural changes. This taxonomy is described in 
Exhibit 12.3.
Short Run. The first interval impact is on expected cash flows within the one-year operating 
budget. The gain or loss depends on the currency of denomination of expected cash flows. 
These are both existing transaction exposures and anticipated exposures. The currency of de￾nomination cannot be changed for existing obligations, or even for implied obligations, such 
as purchase or sales commitments. Apart from real or implied obligations, in the short run it 
is difficult to change sales prices or renegotiate factor costs. Therefore, realized cash flows will 
differ from those expected in the budget. However, as time passes, prices and costs can be 
changed to reflect the new competitive realities caused by a change in exchange rates.
Medium Run: Equilibrium. The second interval impact is on expected medium-run cash 
flows, such as those expressed in two- to five-year budgets, assuming parity conditions hold 
among foreign exchange rates, national inflation rates, and national interest rates. Under 
equilibrium conditions, the firm should be able to adjust prices and factor costs over time to 
maintain the expected level of cash flows. In this case, the currency of denomination of ex￾pected cash flows is not as important as the countries in which cash flows originate. National 
monetary, fiscal, and balance of payments policies determine whether equilibrium conditions 
will exist and whether firms will be allowed to adjust prices and costs.
If equilibrium exists continuously and a firm is free to adjust its prices and costs to main￾tain its expected competitive position, its operating exposure may be zero. Its expected cash 
flows would be realized and therefore its market value unchanged since the exchange rate 
change was anticipated. However, it is also possible that equilibrium conditions exist but the 
firm is unwilling or unable to adjust operations to the new competitive environment. In such 
a case, the firm will experience operating exposure because its realized cash flows will differ 
from expected cash flows. As a result, its market value may also be altered. This debate often 
confronts firms with a simple but perplexing challenge as described in Global Finance in 
Practice 12.2.
Medium Run: Disequilibrium. The third interval impact is on expected medium-run cash 
flows assuming disequilibrium conditions. In this case, the firm may not be able to adjust

prices and costs to reflect the new competitive realities caused by a change in exchange rates. 
The primary problem may be the reactions of existing competitors. The firm’s realized cash 
flows will differ from its expected cash flows. The firm’s market value may change because of 
the unanticipated results.
Long Run. The fourth interval impact is on expected long-run cash flows, meaning those be￾yond five years. At this strategic level, a firm’s cash flows will be influenced by the reactions 
of both existing competitors and potential competitors—possible new entrants—to exchange 
rate changes under disequilibrium conditions. In fact, all firms that are subject to interna￾tional competition, whether they are purely domestic or multinational, are exposed to foreign 
exchange operating exposure in the long run whenever foreign exchange markets are not 
continuously in equilibrium.
Quantifying the stages of operating exposure described here is extremely difficult for 
multinational companies. It is in fact a two-stage problem. The first is forecasting the com￾pany’s own operating cash flows into the future from possible exchange rate changes. That 
is possible but requires a significant amount of assumptions of what values change by what 
amount at what point in time. (The appendix to this chapter provides a sample of how that 
might be done for Aidan Turkey.) The second stage challenge is estimating how competitors 
will respond to exchange rate changes—their pricing, volume, cost, sourcing, etc.—reactions 
to the unexpected exchange rate changes. That is an exercise few multinational enterprises 
have found fruitful.
12.3 Strategic Management of Operating Exposure
The objective of managing both operating and transaction exposure is to anticipate and influ￾ence the effect of unexpected changes in exchange rates on a firm’s future cash flows rather 
than merely hoping for the best. To meet this objective, management can change the firm’s 
operating and financing policies or diversify the firm’s operating and financing structure.
The key to managing operating exposure at the strategic level is for management to 
recognize a disequilibrium in parity conditions when it occurs and to be pre-positioned to 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 12.2 
Japanese yen. The initial price quote to the Japanese cus￾tomer is acceptable and a sale is concluded. But then to￾morrow brings a change in the spot exchange rate. If over 
the coming months the value of the dollar rises versus the 
Japanese yen (requiring more yen per dollar) and the U.S. 
manufacturer sets a new price in Japanese yen, the yen price 
the Japanese importer sees is rising. It may now see a do￾mestic manufacturer of the same product as being cheaper 
than that of the U.S. firm.
The result is the never-ending debate for so many ex￾porters, which price in the above equation should be “set” 
first? The price to the foreign customer in foreign currency or 
the price the manufacturer sells at home? This would mean 
reversing the application of the formula to 3-2-1. And the re￾sult may mean a very different profit margin on foreign versus 
domestic sales.
The Misunderstood Equation
One of the simplest and yet most misunderstood equations 
in global business is the foreign currency price. Assume you 
are a U.S.-based manufacturer who is now about to make its 
first export sale to Japan. The Japanese customer’s procure￾ment office requires pricing and invoicing in Japanese yen. It 
does this in order to compare prices of its purchases across 
different potential suppliers, both domestic and foreign. The 
U.S. firm therefore uses its U.S. dollar price as the base for 
setting its Japanese yen price, multiplying the dollar price by 
the spot exchange rate.
Price$ * Spot
¥ = $1.00 = Price¥
In its simplest form, the equation is therefore a sequence of 
steps,1-2-3, price in dollars, spot rate, and resulting price in 
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 383 08/05/23 9:19 AM384 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
react appropriately. This task can best be accomplished if a firm diversifies internationally 
both its operating and its financing bases. Diversifying operations means diversifying sales, lo￾cation of production facilities, and raw material sources. Diversifying financing means raising 
funds in more than one capital market and in more than one currency.
A diversification strategy permits the firm to react either actively or passively, depending 
on management’s risk preference, to opportunities presented by disequilibrium conditions in 
the foreign exchange, capital, and product markets. Such a strategy does not require manage￾ment to predict disequilibrium but only to recognize it when it occurs. It does require man￾agement to consider how competitors are pre-positioned with respect to their own operating 
exposures. This knowledge should reveal which firms would be helped or hurt competitively 
by alternative disequilibrium scenarios.
Diversifying Operations
Diversification of operations is one structural strategy to pre-positioning the firm for manag￾ing operating exposure. Consider the case in which purchasing power parity is temporarily in 
disequilibrium. Although the disequilibrium may have been unpredictable, management can 
often recognize its symptoms as soon as they occur. For example, management might notice 
a change in comparative costs in the firm’s plants located in different countries or observe 
shifts in sales volumes across country markets.
Recognizing a change in worldwide competitive conditions permits management to make 
changes in operating strategies. Management might make marginal shifts in sourcing raw 
materials, components, or finished products. If spare capacity exists, production runs can be 
lengthened in one country and reduced in another. The marketing effort can be strengthened 
in export markets where the firm’s products have become more price competitive because of 
the disequilibrium condition. And in addition to recognizing the change, an added challenge 
is to know when the change is temporary or semi-permanent, as described in Global Finance 
in Practice 12.3.
Even if management does not actively alter normal operations when exchange rates 
change, the firm should experience some beneficial portfolio effects. The variability of its 
cash flows is probably reduced by international diversification of its production, sourcing, and 
sales because exchange rate changes under disequilibrium conditions are likely to increase 
the firm’s competitiveness in some markets while reducing it in others. In that case, operating 
exposure would be neutralized. In contrast to the internationally diversified MNE, a purely 
domestic firm might be subject to the full impact of foreign exchange operating exposure 
even though it does not have foreign currency cash flows. For example, it could experience 
import competition in its domestic market from competing firms producing in countries with 
undervalued currencies.
A purely domestic firm does not have the option to react to an international disequilib￾rium condition in the same manner as an MNE. In fact, a purely domestic firm will not be 
positioned to even recognize that a disequilibrium exists, because it lacks comparative data 
from its own internal sources. By the time external data are available, it is often too late to 
react. Even if a domestic firm recognizes the disequilibrium, it cannot quickly shift produc￾tion and sales into foreign markets in which it has had no previous presence.
Constraints exist that may limit the feasibility of diversifying production locations. 
The technology of a particular industry may require large economies of scale. For example, 
high-tech firms, such as Intel, prefer to locate in places where they have easy access to high￾tech suppliers, a highly educated workforce, and one or more leading universities. Their R&D 
efforts are closely tied to initial production and sales activities.

Diversifying Financing
If a firm diversifies its financing sources, it will be pre-positioned to take advantage of tempo￾rary deviations from the international Fisher effect. If interest rate differentials do not equal 
expected changes in exchange rates, opportunities to lower a firm’s cost of capital will exist. 
However, to be able to switch financing sources, a firm must already be well known in the 
international investment community, with banking contacts firmly established. Again, this is 
not typically an option for a domestic firm. As we will demonstrate in Chapter 13, diversifying

the euro. Prior to the launch of the euro, there was a rela￾tively “weak pound” period. But in 1996 there was a seismic 
shift—roughly from GBP0.80 = EUR1.00 to GBP0.65—and 
this shift persisted for more than a decade. During this pe￾riod all things British became relatively more expensive on the 
Continent. British export prices were decidedly less competi￾tive, while European exports to the UK gained at the UK’s 
expense. As has been the case so many times around the 
globe, this basic terms-of-trade shift altered fundamental 
national economies. What the next era or cycle will look like 
is anyone’s guess. But, despite the ebb and flow of politi￾cal organizations and linkages like EU membership, the eco￾nomic linkages between multinational firms on both sides of 
the Channel are undeniable. “Trans-channel currency shift” is 
operating exposure management at work.
The United Kingdom and Europe: Trans-Channel 
Currency Shifts
The United Kingdom’s largest trading partner is the European 
Union (EU), and although the two have been heavily inter￾twined for many years, the UK’s recent decision to exit the EU 
was in many ways not that surprising. The UK never joined 
the euro. Keeping a separate currency, the British pound, and 
the associated ability to define its own monetary policy and 
currency has been a fundamental pillar of British pride and 
independence. But that independence has come at a price—
what might be termed trans-channel (think English Channel) 
currency shifts.
The past 20 years have seen at least three different 
currency eras of relative strength between the pound and 
British pounds (GBP) = 1.00 European euro (EUR)

With the global financial crisis of fall 2008, the pound weakened

streak was stopped with Brexit (British exit from the EU).

sources of financing, regardless of the currency of denomination, can lower a firm’s cost of 
capital and increase its availability of capital. The ability to source capital from outside of a 
segmented market is especially important for firms resident in emerging markets.
12.4 Proactive Management of Operating Exposure
Operating and transaction exposures can be partially managed by adopting operating or fi￾nancing policies that offset anticipated foreign exchange exposures. Five of the most com￾monly employed proactive policies are (1) matching currency cash flows, (2) risk-sharing 
agreements, (3) back-to-back or parallel loans, (4) cross-currency swaps, and (5) contractual 
approaches.
Matching Currency Cash Flows
One way to offset an anticipated continuous long-term exposure to a particular currency is 
to acquire debt denominated in that currency. Exhibit 12.4 depicts the exposure of a U.S. firm 
with continuing export sales to Canada. In order to compete effectively in Canadian mar￾kets, the firm invoices all export sales in Canadian dollars. This policy results in a continuing 
receipt of Canadian dollars month after month. If the export sales are part of a continuing 
supplier relationship, the long Canadian dollar position is relatively predictable and constant. 
This endless series of transaction exposures could of course be continually hedged with for￾ward contracts or other contractual hedges, as discussed in Chapter 9.
But what if the firm sought out a continual use—an outflow—for its continual inflow of 
Canadian dollars? If the U.S. firm were to acquire part of its debt capital in the Canadian dol￾lar markets, it could use the relatively predictable Canadian dollar cash inflows from export 
sales to service the principal and interest payments on Canadian dollar debt and be cash-flow 
matched. The U.S.-based firm has hedged an operational cash inflow by creating a financial

Hedge: The Canadian dollar debt payments act as a financial hedge by requiring debt service
payments—an outflow in Canadian dollars—for the U.S. corporation
EXHIBIT 12.4 Debt Financing as a Financial Hedge
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 386 08/05/23 9:19 AMCHAPTER 12 Operating Exposure 387
cash outflow, and so it does not have to actively manage the exposure with contractual finan￾cial instruments, such as forward contracts. This form of hedging, sometimes referred to as 
matching, is effective in eliminating currency exposure when the exposure cash flow is rela￾tively constant and predictable over time.
The list of potential matching strategies is nearly endless. A second alternative would be 
for the U.S. firm to seek out potential suppliers of materials or components in Canada as a 
substitute for sourcing from U.S. or other foreign firms. The firm would then possess both an 
operational Canadian dollar cash inflow—a receivable—and a Canadian dollar operational 
cash outflow—a payable. If the cash flows were roughly the same in magnitude and timing, 
the strategy would be a natural hedge, the term natural referring to operating-based activities.
A third alternative, often referred to as currency switching, would be to pay foreign sup￾pliers with Canadian dollars. For example, if a U.S. firm imported components from Mexico, 
the Mexican firms themselves might welcome payment in Canadian dollars because they are 
short Canadian dollars in their multinational cash flow network.
Risk-Sharing Agreements
An alternative arrangement for managing a long-term cash flow exposure between firms 
with a continuing buyer-supplier relationship is risk sharing. Risk sharing is a contractual ar￾rangement in which the buyer and seller agree to “share” or split currency movement impacts 
on payments between them. If the two firms are interested in a long-term relationship based 
on product quality and supplier reliability, and not on the whims of the currency markets, a 
cooperative agreement to share the burden of currency risk may be in order.
If Ford’s North American operations import automotive parts from Mazda (Japan) every 
month, year after year, major swings in exchange rates can benefit one party at the expense of 
the other. (Ford is a major stockholder of Mazda, but it does not exert control over Mazda’s 
operations. Therefore, the risk-sharing agreement is particularly appropriate; transactions be￾tween the two are both intercompany and intracompany in nature. A risk-sharing agreement 
solidifies the partnership.)
One potential solution would be for Ford and Mazda to agree that all purchases by Ford 
will be made in Japanese yen at the current exchange rate, as long as the spot rate on the date 
of invoice is between, say, ¥115 = $1.00 and ¥125 = $1.00. If the exchange rate is between 
these values on the payment dates, Ford agrees to accept whatever transaction exposure ex￾ists (because it is paying in a foreign currency). If, however, the exchange rate falls outside 
this range on the payment date, Ford and Mazda will share the difference equally.
For example, Ford has an account payable of ¥25,000,000 for the month of March. If the 
spot rate on the date of invoice is ¥110 = $1.00, the Japanese yen would have appreciated 
versus the dollar, causing Ford’s costs of purchasing automotive parts to rise. Since this rate 
falls outside the contractual range, Mazda would agree to accept a total payment in Japanese 
yen that would result from a difference of ¥5 per $ (i.e., ¥115 – ¥110). Ford’s payment would 
be as follows:
£
¥25,000,000
¥115.00 - a
¥5.00
2 b § = ¥25,000,000
¥112.50 = $222,222.22
At a spot rate of ¥110 = $1.00, Ford’s costs for March would be $227,272.73 without 
the risk-sharing agreement. With the agreement, however, Ford’s payment is calculated using 
an exchange rate of ¥112.50 = $1.00, a payment of $222,222.22. The risk-sharing agreement 
constitutes a savings for Ford of $5,050.51 (this savings is a reduction in a cost increase, not 
a true cost reduction). Both parties therefore incur costs and benefits from exchange rate 
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 387 08/05/23 9:19 AM388 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
movements outside the specified band. Note that the movement could just as easily have 
been in Mazda’s favor if the spot rate had moved to ¥130 = $1.00.
The risk-sharing arrangement is intended to smooth the impact on both parties of vola￾tile and unpredictable exchange rate movements. Of course, a sustained appreciation of one 
currency versus the other would require the negotiation of a new sharing agreement, but the 
ultimate goal of the agreement is to alleviate currency pressures on the continuing business 
relationship.
Risk-sharing agreements like these have been in use for nearly 50 years on world 
markets. They became something of a rarity during the 1960s when exchange rates were 
relatively stable under the Bretton Woods Agreement. But with the return to floating 
exchange rates in the 1970s, firms with long-term customer-supplier relationships across 
borders have returned to some old ways of maintaining mutually beneficial long-term 
trade. Global Finance in Practice 12.4 describes how one U.S.-based firm, Harley-Davidson, 
has used risk sharing.
Back-to-Back or Parallel Loans
A back-to-back loan, also referred to as a parallel loan or credit swap, occurs when two busi￾ness firms in separate countries arrange to borrow each other’s currency for a specific period 
of time. At an agreed terminal date, they return the borrowed currencies. The operation is 
conducted outside the foreign exchange markets, although spot quotations may be used as 
the reference point for determining the amount of funds to be swapped. Such a swap creates 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 12.4 
Harley manages this problem with a risk-sharing structure 
similar to the following.
The risk-sharing structure is based on how the spot ex￾change rate moves from a predetermined central rate (ex￾change rate). As long as the spot rate during the period stays 
within the Neutral Zone, Harley is responsible for managing the 
currency exposures that it incurs on the corporate level. If the 
spot rate moves into the Sharing Zone during the period, the 
exchange rate used in pricing is adjusted to “share” the change 
equally. If the spot rate moves beyond the Sharing Zone into the 
Renegotiation Zone during the period, Harley will work with for￾eign distributors to establish a new central rate moving forward.
Hedging Hogs: Risk Sharing at Harley-Davidson
Harley-Davidson (U.S.) is representative of a company 
with centralized manufacturing (all in the United States 
with costs in U.S. dollars) and global sales (predominantly 
in U.S. dollars, European euros, Australian dollars, and 
Japanese yen). Dealerships in foreign countries, therefore, 
purchase from Harley and sell into the local market in local 
currency. The foreign dealerships need to be assured of 
stable product costs—in local currency and at a predict￾able purchase price of the hogs from Harley (U.S.)—in 
order to offer stable and competitive prices in-country.

a covered hedge against exchange loss, since each company, on its own books, borrows the 
same currency it repays. Back-to-back loans are also used at a time of actual or anticipated 
legal limitations on the transfer of investment funds to or from either country.
The structure of a typical back-to-back loan is illustrated in Exhibit 12.5. A British parent 
firm that wants to invest funds in its Dutch subsidiary locates a Dutch parent firm that wants 
to invest funds in the United Kingdom. Avoiding the exchange markets entirely, the British 
parent lends pounds to the Dutch subsidiary in the United Kingdom, while the Dutch par￾ent lends euro to the British subsidiary in the Netherlands. The two loans would be for equal 
values at the current spot rate and for a specified maturity. At maturity, the two separate 
loans would each be repaid to the original lender, again without any need to use the foreign 
exchange markets. Neither loan carries any foreign exchange risk, and neither loan normally 
needs the approval of any governmental body regulating the availability of foreign exchange 
for investment purposes.
Parent company guarantees are not needed on the back-to-back loans because each loan 
carries the right of offset in the event of default of the other loan. A further agreement can 
provide for maintenance of principal parity in case of changes in the spot rate between the 
two countries. For example, if the pound dropped by more than, say, 6% for as long as 30 
days, the British parent might decide to advance additional pounds to the Dutch subsidiary 
to bring the principal value of the two loans back to parity. A similar provision would protect 
the British subsidiary if the euro should weaken. Although this parity provision might lead 
to changes in the amount of home currency each party must lend during the period of the 
agreement, it does not increase foreign exchange risk because at maturity all loans are repaid 
in the same currency loaned.
There are two fundamental impediments to widespread use of the back-to-back loan. 
First, it is difficult for a firm to find a partner, termed a counterparty, for the currency, amount, 
and timing desired. Second, a risk exists that one of the parties will fail to return the bor￾rowed funds at the designated maturity—although this risk is minimized because each party

to the loan has, in effect, 100% collateral, albeit in a different currency. These disadvantages 
have led to the rapid development and wide use of the cross-currency swap.
Cross-Currency Swaps
A cross-currency swap resembles a back-to-back loan except that it does not appear on a 
firm’s balance sheet. As detailed in Chapter 8, the term swap is used in a variety of ways in 
international finance, and care should be used to identify the exact use in a specific case. In 
a currency swap, a firm and a swap dealer (or swap bank) agree to exchange an equivalent 
amount of two different currencies for a specified period of time. Currency swaps can be ne￾gotiated for a wide range of maturities up to 30 years in some cases. The swap dealer or swap 
bank acts as a middleman in setting up the swap agreement.
A typical currency swap first requires two firms to borrow funds in markets and cur￾rencies in which they are well known. For example, a Japanese firm would typically borrow 
yen on a regular basis in its home market. If, however, the Japanese firm were exporting to 
the U.S. and earning U.S. dollars, it might wish to construct a matching cash flow hedge that 
would allow it to use the U.S. dollars earned to make regular debt-service payments on U.S. 
dollar debt. If, however, the Japanese firm is not well known in the U.S. financial markets, it 
may have no ready access to U.S. dollar debt.
One way in which this Japanese firm could, in effect, borrow dollars, is to participate in 
a cross-currency swap as seen in Exhibit 12.6. The firm could swap its yen-denominated debt 
service payments with another firm that has U.S. dollar-debt service payments. This swap 
would have the Japanese firm “paying dollars” and “receiving yen.” The Japanese firm would 
then have dollar debt service without actually borrowing U.S. dollars. Simultaneously, a U.S. 
corporation would actually be entering into a cross-currency swap in the opposite direction—
“paying yen” and “receiving dollars.” The swap dealer takes the role of a middleman.
Swap dealers arrange most swaps on a blind basis, meaning that the initiating firm does 
not know who is on the other side of the swap arrangement—the counterparty. The initiating 
Both the Japanese corporation and the U.S. corporation would like to enter into a cross-currency
swap which would allow them to use foreign currency cash inflows to service debt.

firm views the dealer or bank as its counterparty. Because swap markets are dominated by 
the major money center banks worldwide, the counterparty risk is considered acceptable. 
Because the swap dealer’s business is arranging swaps, the dealer can generally arrange for 
the currency, amount, and timing of the desired swap. Accountants in the U.S. treat the cur￾rency swap as a foreign exchange transaction rather than as debt and they treat the obliga￾tion to reverse the swap at some later date as a forward exchange contract. (This treatment 
reflects a fundamental property of swaps—that they are not a source of capital, but rather an 
exchange of currencies and interest rates on servicing obligations.) Forward exchange con￾tracts can be matched against assets, but they are entered in a firm’s footnotes rather than as 
balance sheet items. The result is that both translation and operating exposures are avoided, 
and neither a long-term receivable nor a long-term debt is created on the balance sheet.
Contractual Approaches: Hedging the Unhedgeable
Some MNEs now attempt to hedge their operating exposure with contractual strategies. A 
number of firms like Merck (U.S.) have undertaken long-term currency option positions—
hedges designed to offset lost earnings from adverse exchange rate changes. This hedging of 
what many of these firms refer to as strategic exposure or competitive exposure seems to fly 
in the face of traditional theory.
The ability of firms to hedge the “unhedgeable” is dependent upon predictability: (1) 
the predictability of the firm’s future cash flows and (2) the predictability of the firm’s com￾petitors’ responses to exchange rate changes. Although the management of many firms may 
believe they are capable of predicting their own cash flows, in practice, few feel capable of 
accurately predicting competitor response. Many firms still find timely measurement of expo￾sure challenging. One type of predictability is that of fixed exchange rates, a debate described 
in Global Finance in Practice 12.5.
Merck is an example of a firm whose management feels capable of both. The company 
possesses relatively predictable long-run revenue streams due to the product-niche nature 
of the pharmaceuticals industry. As a U.S.-based exporter to foreign markets, markets in 
which sales levels by product are relatively predictable and prices are often regulated by 
government, Merck can accurately predict net long-term cash flows in foreign currencies 5 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 12.5 
risk-taking behavior. In other words, a firm may tolerate more 
risks when it knows that someone else will pick up the tab. 
In a fixed or managed exchange rate regime, that “someone 
else” is represented by the central bank, which tells all those 
undertaking cross-currency contractual obligations and ex￾posures that the exchange rate will not change.
Although there is still scant research on this specific 
practice for most emerging markets, it could prove to be a 
significant issue in the years to come, as many emerging 
markets become the object of major new international capital 
flows—the so-called globalization of finance. If commercial 
firms in those markets are not aware of the risk that the coun￾try itself may be taking by opening the door to international 
capital flows both into and out of the country and the impact 
those capital flows may have on the country’s exchange rate, 
those firms may be in for a wild ride.
Do Fixed Exchange Rates Increase Corporate 
Currency Risk in Emerging Markets?
It has long been argued that when firms believe that the ex￾change rate will not change—for example, when they are 
operating in a country whose currency is officially fixed to a 
major global currency—and has been fixed for a relatively 
long period of time, they will conduct their business as if they 
have no currency exposure or risk. As one study of currency 
risk in India noted, “These results support the hypothesis that 
pegged exchange rates induce moral hazard and increase fi￾nancial fragility.”
Moral hazard is the concept that a party—an agent, 
an individual, or a firm—will take on more risk when it either 
knows or believes that a second party will handle, accom￾modate, or insure the negative repercussions of the firm’s 
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 391 08/05/23 9:19 AM392 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
Summary Points
■ Operating exposure measures the change in value of 
the firm that results from changes in future operat￾ing cash flows caused by an unexpected change in ex￾change rates.
■ Operating strategies for the management of operating 
exposure emphasize the structuring of firm operations in 
order to create matching streams of cash flows by currency.
■ The objective of operating exposure management is 
to anticipate and influence the effect of unexpected 
changes in exchange rates on a firm’s future cash flow 
rather than being forced into passive reaction to such 
changes.
■ Proactive policies include matching currency cash 
flows, currency risk-sharing clauses, back-to-back loan 
structures, and cross-currency swap agreements.
■ Contractual approaches (i.e., options and forwards) 
have occasionally been used to hedge operating expo￾sure but are costly and possibly ineffectual.
and 10 years into the future. Merck has a relatively undiversified operating structure, and it 
is highly centralized in terms of where research, development, and production costs are lo￾cated. Merck’s managers feel the company has no real alternatives except contractual hedg￾ing if it is to weather long-term unexpected exchange rate changes. Merck has purchased 
over-the-counter (OTC) long-term put options on foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar as 
insurance against potential lost earnings from exchange rate changes.
A significant question remains as to the true effectiveness of hedging operating exposure 
with contractual hedges. The fact remains that even after feared exchange rate movements 
and put option position payoffs, the firm is competitively disadvantaged. The capital outlay 
required for the purchase of such sizeable put option positions is capital not used for the 
potential diversification of operations, which in the long run might have more effectively 
maintained the firm’s global market share and international competitiveness.
MINI-CASE 
Brexit and Rolls-Royce1
Rolls said it “remains committed to the UK where we 
are headquartered, directly employ over 23,000 talent￾ed and committed workers and where we carry out a 
significant majority of our research and development. 
The UK’s decision will have no immediate impact on 
our day-to-day business.”
—“‘Business as Usual’ for Rolls-Royce as It Remains on 
Course despite Brexit,” The Telegraph, June 28, 2016.
The decision by the people of the United Kingdom to 
leave the European Union (EU)—Brexit—in June 2016 
raised many questions over the future of many of the UK’s 
multinational firms. One firm in the limelight was Rolls￾Royce, one of the premier aerospace engine manufactur￾ers in the world. Rolls was one of Britain’s major exporters, 
credited with roughly 2% of the country’s annual exports. 
Following Brexit and the sharp decline in the British 
pound sterling, analysts were attempting to gauge how the 
EU exit would alter the company’s business and how the 
company’s leadership was likely to react.
The Business and Currency Hedging
Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC is a UK-based multinational 
group that designs, manufactures, and distributes power 
systems to the aviation (civil and defense), marine, nu￾clear, and other industries.2
 It is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange (LSE: RR) and is a member of the 
FTSE 100 index. It is the second largest manufacturer 
of aircraft engines in the world, and closed 2015 with 
£13.725 billion in revenue and £0.084 billion in net in￾come. In recent years nearly all of its profits have come 
from the aerospace sector.

BMW of Germany.

Exhibit B presents Rolls-Royce’s currency derivatives 
program status as of December 31 for the previous two 
years. Note that the predominant value is the amount of 
U.S. dollars sold forward—mostly in exchange for British 
pounds sterling, but some also for euros and other un￾named currencies.
As is the case with unpredictable markets, the hedges 
had not always proved profitable when viewed in hindsight. 
In the summer of 2014 the pound began to fall against the 
dollar, a favorable movement for Rolls that the company 
could not fully enjoy given its lock-in hedge program. As 
is always the case, locking in a guaranteed rate meant that 
when the exchange rate moved in the company’s favor, its 
protection would prove to be a cost, as it could not enjoy 
the favorable movement. Unfortunately, the pound’s slide 
against the dollar had continued into 2016.
Publicly traded companies like Rolls must continually 
worry about short-term market movements while keep￾ing long-term competitiveness in their sights. Although the 
company believes its long-term hedging program is in the 
long-term interests of the company, there will always be pe￾riods in the short-term that make the program appear to be 
a mistake (reflected in short-term share price movements).
Exhibit C attempts to provide some longer-term 
perspective to the challenge Rolls faces. The exchange 
rates that matter the most, the dollar and euro against 
the pound, show varying periods of relative strength 
and weakness over the past 25 years. It is apparent from 
Exhibit C that the pound has enjoyed a long period of 
relative weakness against the dollar and euro. But the 
recent Brexit vote seems to have pushed it down to a 
level not seen in the past quarter-century against the 
dollar, as well as approaching the historical lows versus 
the euro.
But Rolls had a serious, long-term, structural currency 
problem. Although it was based in the UK, with most of 
its manufacturing operations in British pounds, its global 
sales were dominated by the U.S. dollar. This reflected the 
location and identities of its major customers like Boeing 
and Airbus. As illustrated in Exhibit A, this structural cur￾rency mismatch meant the company had a significant op￾erating exposure problem, earning primarily U.S. dollars 
when paying out British pounds and euros. (Because many 
of the pieces, parts, and subcomponents used by Rolls were 
sourced from Continental Europe, the euro was a net short 
position for the company as well.) Since many of Rolls’ 
sales programs were lengthy, often between three and six 
years in length, this long-dollar position was not only large, 
it was relatively predictable over time.
The Hedging Program
“Rolls-Royce operates in a number of very long cycle 
businesses and we therefore have a long-term hedging 
program to provide a degree of certainty to our cash 
flows going forward,” Rolls-Royce spokeswoman Jane 
Terry said in an e-mailed statement. 
—“Rolls-Royce May Rue Long-Term Hedging Decision as 
Pound Plunges,” Bloomberg.com, Mar. 15, 2013.
Rolls, like most multinationals, values predictability of cash 
flow. In an attempt to increase the predictability of British 
pound proceeds from sales, given the fluctuations of exchange 
rates, Rolls in 2012 had started a large—more than $20 bil￾lion—long-term currency hedging program, some of it more 
than six years in duration. The majority of the hedge program 
locked-in U.S. dollar revenues at an average of $1.60 per pound, 
using primarily forward contracts, for six years into the future.

Rolls-Royce’s business was structurally mismatched by currency. Although
global sales were dominated by the U.S. dollar, costs were still largely British pound-based.
The result was a multinational company that was long U.S. dollars and short British pounds. If the U.S. dollar
then appreciated versus the British pound, Rolls-Royce benefits. If, however, the dollar was to fall in value versus
the pound, sales, earnings, and cash flows would fall in value as reported in British pounds.

EXHIBIT C Long-Term Exchange Rates of the Dollar, Euro, and Pound
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 394 08/05/23 9:19 AMBrexit
Hey Europe, how’s it going? Lost a few pounds lately?
—Note in London pub window, July 2016.
The British vote in June 2016 to exit the EU was largely 
based on social and political issues, not economic or 
financial.3
 The UK had never adopted the euro, prefer￾ring these many years to keep the pound sterling and its 
monetary independence. The year 2016 had been a rela￾tively stable one for the USDGBP rate, at least up until 
the Brexit vote on June 24, as shown in Exhibit D. The 
vote had a distinctly negative impact on the value of the 
pound. By August the pound sterling was down more than 
12% against the dollar.
But a weaker pound was essentially good news for 
Rolls, as shown in its share price bump following the vote 
and its first-half year results (see Exhibit E).
Rolls was of the few companies whose shares rose on 
the day the referendum’s result was announced, with 
analysts pointing out that the weaker pound made the 
export-reliant company’s products cheaper and there￾fore more competitive.4
Posted just after the Brexit vote, Rolls’s first half-year 
results had been in line with expectations, but expectations 
had been low. The slide of the pound against the dollar in 
late June, combined with the large forward contract hedge 
position, had forced the company to miss out on substantial 
currency gains. And that had led to the company recording 
a loss on its currency hedges. As one journalist explained:
Rolls-Royce is therefore still where it was pre-Brexit. 
What is actually being said here is that if Rolls-Royce 
didn’t hedge then it would be £2 billion better off today 
but it did hedge so it isn’t.5
Rolls itself continued to try and clarify to the mar￾ket the outlook for its hedging program, a program now at 
more than $30 billion in notional principal.6
Through our hedging activities we seek to reduce the 
volatility of our revenues, costs and resulting margins. 
Our hedging instruments are sufficiently flexible to

MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. Why do you think Rolls has continued to bear this 
structural currency mismatch so long? Why hasn’t it 
done what many automobile companies have done 
and move some of its manufacturing and assembly to 
the country in which the customer resides?
2. Why are Rolls-Royce’s foreign currency hedges 
performing so poorly? Shouldn’t the hedges be pro￾tecting its sales and earnings against exchange rate 
movements?
3. If you were a member of the leadership team at 
Rolls-Royce, what would you recommend the com￾pany do to manage the risks arising from Brexit?
allow us to achieve near 100% cover for our transac￾tions in the short and medium term at close to our aver￾age hedge rate which stood at around $1.59 at the end 
of 2015. Over the longer term, should the £/$ remain at 
its current lower levels we should be able to add more 
hedges and achieve a lower average rate. With our hedge 
book now over $30 billion, the impact of lower £/$ rates 
will be limited in the near-term.
In addition to exchange rate concerns, Brexit con￾fronted Rolls-Royce with a number of very large long-term 
questions—questions about investment and strategy. Like 
other UK companies, Rolls was trying to decide whether 
to continue to invest in its operations and facilities in the 
UK or possibly redirect that invest to Continental Europe. 
No longer an EU member, UK-based companies now 
faced the possibility of being treated as outsiders to the 
Continental European markets, raising threats of trade 
restrictions, regulatory distinctions, and documentation re￾quirements and delays. Rolls-Royce said it has held “high￾level” talks with ministers about the areas that it is keen to

396 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 396 08/05/23 9:19 AMCHAPTER 12 Operating Exposure 397
Questions
12.1 Operating Exposure. What is the difference bet￾ween operating exposure and transaction exposure? 
How is operating exposure measured? Why is it dif￾ficult to measure operating exposure?
12.2 Operating Exposure versus Transaction Exposure.
What are the main similarities between operat￾ing exposure and transaction exposure? Which of 
the two exposures is more relevant for long-term 
planning?
12.3 Unexpected Exchange Rate Changes. Explain 
when exchange rate uncertainty does not expose 
firms to exchange risk.
12.4 Time Horizon. Explain the time horizons used to 
analyze and measure unexpected changes in ex￾change rates.
12.5 Static versus Dynamic. Why is static risk insurable 
while dynamic risk is not insurable?
12.6 Operating versus Financing Cash Flows. According 
to financial theory, which is more important to the 
value of the firm, financing or operating cash flows?
12.7 Economic Exposure. Economic exposure is highest 
for MNEs with multiple foreign currency opera￾tions. Is economic exposure confined to MNEs or 
does it involve local firms as well?
12.8 Strategic Exposure. Operating or strategic expo￾sure has become a concern of long-term corporate 
strategy. Which level of management is responsible 
for mitigating and managing strategic exposure? 
Explain the various policy options that manage￾ment uses to manage strategic exposure.
12.9 Managing Operating Exposure. The key to manag￾ing operating exposure at the strategic level is for 
management to recognize a disequilibrium in parity 
conditions when it occurs and to be pre-positioned 
to react appropriately. How can this task best be 
accomplished?
12.10 Diversification. What are the diversification strate￾gies and financing policies that the management of 
the firm adopts to mitigate transaction and operat￾ing exposure?
12.11 Proactive Management. Operating exposures can 
be partially managed by adopting operating or fi￾nancing policies that offset anticipated foreign ex￾change exposures. What are four of the most com￾monly employed proactive policies?
12.12 Currency Switching. Explain how currency switch￾ing can offset long-term exposure to a foreign 
currency.
12.13 Currency Risk Sharing. Explain why suppliers are 
ready to get into currency risk sharing deals with 
MNEs. How do such deals impact the financial posi￾tion of both parties?
12.14 Back-to-Back Loans. Back-to-back loans have 
caused many of the banking crises in emerging econ￾omies in the 1990s. What guarantees can firms obtain 
in order to use this type of foreign exchange hedge?
12.15 Currency Swaps. Do currency swaps always hedge 
against foreign exchange exposure? What other 
precautions are needed for effective hedging?
12.16 Hedging the Unhedgeable. How do some firms at￾tempt to hedge their long-term operation exposure 
with contractual hedges? What assumptions do they 
make in order to justify contractual hedging of their 
operating exposure? How effective is such contrac￾tual hedging in your opinion?
Problems
12.1 Mauna Loa Macadamia. Mauna Loa Macadamia, 
a macadamia nut subsidiary of Hershey’s with plan￾tations on the slopes of its namesake volcano in Hilo, 
Hawaii, exports macadamia nuts worldwide. The 
Japanese market is its biggest export market, with 
average annual sales invoiced in yen to Japanese 
customers of ¥1,200,000,000. At the present ex￾change rate of ¥125 = $1.00, this is equivalent to 
$9,600,000. Sales are relatively equally distributed 
throughout the year. They show up as a ¥250,00,000 
account receivable on Mauna Loa’s balance sheet. 
Credit terms to each customer allow for 60 days be￾fore payment is due. Monthly cash collections are 
typically ¥100,000,000.
Mauna Loa would like to hedge its yen receipts, 
but it has too many customers and transactions to 
make it practical to sell each receivable forward. 
It does not want to use options because they are 
considered to be too expensive for this particu￾lar purpose. Therefore, they have decided to use a 
“matching” hedge by borrowing yen. Mauna Loa 
can borrow Japanese yen 4.00% per annum.
a. How much should Mauna Loa borrow in yen?
b. What should be the terms of payment on the 
yen loan?
12.2 Acuña Leather Goods. DeMagistris Fashion 
Company, based in New York City, imports leather 
coats from Acuña Leather Goods, a reliable and 
longtime supplier, based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 397 08/05/23 9:19 AM398 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
Payment is in Argentine pesos. When the peso lost 
its parity with the U.S. dollar in January 2002, it col￾lapsed in value to Ps4.0 = $1.00 by October 2002. 
The outlook was for a further decline in the peso’s 
value. Since both DeMagistris and Acuña wanted to 
continue their longtime relationship, they agreed on 
a risk-sharing arrangement. As long as the spot rate 
on the date of an invoice is between Ps3.5 = $1.00
and Ps4.5 = $1.00, DeMagistris will pay based on 
the spot rate. If the exchange rate falls outside this 
range, DeMagistris will share the difference equally 
with Acuña Leather Goods. The risk-sharing agree￾ment will last for six months, at which time the ex￾change rate limits will be reevaluated. DeMagistris 
contracts to import leather coats from Acuña for 
Ps8,000,000 or $2,000,000 at the current spot rate 
of Ps4.0 = $1.00 during the next six months.
a. If the exchange rate changes immediately to 
Ps6.0 = $1.00, what will be the dollar cost of six 
months of imports to DeMagistris?
b. At Ps6.0 = $1.00, what will be the peso export 
sales of Acuña Leather Goods to DeMagistris 
Fashion Company?
12.3 Richland Crane (A). Richland Crane (U.S.) ex￾ports heavy crane equipment to several Chinese 
dock facilities. Sales are currently 10,000 units per 
year at the yuan equivalent of USD24,000 each. 
The Chinese yuan (CNY) has been trading at 
CNY8.20 = USD1.00, but a Hong Kong advisory 
service predicts the yuan will drop in value next 
week to CNY9.00 = USD1.00, after which it will 
remain unchanged for at least a decade. Accepting 
this forecast as a given, Richland Crane must make 
a pricing decision in the face of the impending de￾valuation. It may either (1) maintain the same yuan 
price and in effect sell for fewer dollars, in which 
case Chinese volume will not change; or (2) main￾tain the same dollar price, raise the yuan price in 
China to offset the devaluation, and experience a 
10% drop in unit volume. Direct costs are 75% of 
the U.S. sales price.
a. What would be the short-run (one year) impact 
of each pricing strategy?
b. Which do you recommend?
12.4 Richland Crane (B). Assume the same facts as 
in Problem 12.3. Additionally, financial manage￾ment believes that if it maintains the same yuan 
sales price, volume will increase at 12% per annum 
for eight years. Dollar costs will not change. At the 
end of 10 years, Richland’s patent expires and it will 
no longer export to China. After the yuan is deval￾ued to CNY9.20 = USD1.00, no further devalu￾ations are expected. If Richland Crane raises the 
yuan price so as to maintain its dollar price, volume 
will increase at only 1% per annum for eight years, 
starting from the lower initial base of 9,000 units. 
Again, dollar costs will not change, and at the end 
of eight years Richland Crane will stop exporting to 
China. Richland’s weighted average cost of capital 
is 10%. Given these considerations, what should be 
Richland’s pricing policy?
12.5 MacLoren Automotive. MacLoren Automotive 
manufactures British sports cars, a number of 
which are exported to New Zealand for payment 
in pounds sterling. The distributor sells the sports 
cars in New Zealand for New Zealand dollars. 
The New Zealand distributor is unable to carry 
all of the foreign exchange risk, and would not 
sell MacLoren models unless MacLoren shared 
some of the foreign exchange risk. MacLoren has 
agreed that sales for a given model year will ini￾tially be priced at a “base” spot rate between the 
New Zealand dollar and pound sterling set to be 
the spot mid-rate at the beginning of that model 
year. As long as the actual exchange rate is within 
that base rate, payment will be made in pounds 
sterling. That is, the New Zealand distributor as￾sumes all foreign exchange risk. However, if the 
spot rate at time of shipment falls outside of this 
range, MacLoren will share equally (i.e., 50/50) the 
difference between the actual spot rate and the 
base rate. For the current model year the base rate 
is NZ$1.6400 = £1.00.
a. What are the outside ranges within which the 
New Zealand importer must pay at the then cur￾rent spot rate?
b. If MacLoren ships 10 sports cars to the New 
Zealand distributor at a time when the spot ex￾change rate is NZ$1.7000 = £1.00, and each car 
has an invoice cost £32,000, what will be the cost 
to the distributor in New Zealand dollars? How 
many pounds will MacLoren receive, and how 
does this compare with MacLoren’s expected 
sales receipt of £32,000 per car?
c. If MacLoren Automotive ships the same 10 
cars to New Zealand at a time when the spot 
exchange rate is NZ$1.6500 = £1.00, how many 
New Zealand dollars will the distributor pay? 
How many pounds will MacLoren Automotive 
receive?
d. Does a risk-sharing agreement such as this shift 
the currency exposure from one party of the 
transaction to the other?
e. Why is such a risk-sharing agreement of benefit 
to MacLoren? Why is it of benefit to the New 
Zealand distributor?
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 398 08/05/23 9:19 AMCHAPTER 12 Operating Exposure 399
d. Compare the prices and volumes for the first quar￾ter of each of the three years shown (Problem 12.8 
part d, on the following page). Who has benefitted 
the most from the exchange rate changes?
12.9 Hurte-Paroxysm Products, Inc. (A). Hurte￾Paroxysm Products, Inc. (HP) of the United 
States, exports computer printers to Brazil, whose 
currency, the reais (BRL) has been trading at 
BRL3.40=USD1.00. Exports to Brazil are currently 
50,000 printers per year at the reais-equivalent of 
$200 each. A rumor exists that the reais will be de￾valued against the dollar to BRL$4.00 within two 
weeks by the Brazilian government. Should the de￾valuation take place, the reais is expected to remain 
unchanged for another decade.
Accepting this forecast as given, HP faces a 
pricing decision that must be made before any ac￾tual devaluation: HP may either (1) maintain the 
same reais price and, in effect, sell for fewer dollars, 
in which case Brazilian volume will not change; or 
(2) maintain the same dollar price, raise the reais 
price in Brazil to compensate for the devaluation, 
and experience a 20% drop in volume. Direct costs 
in the United States are 60% of the U.S. sales price. 
What would be the short-run (1-year) implication of 
each pricing strategy? Which do you recommend?
12.10 Hurte-Paroxysm Products, Inc. (B). Assume the 
same facts as in Problem 12.9. HP also believes that 
if it maintains the same price in Brazilian reais as a 
permanent policy, volume will increase at 10% per 
annum for six years, costs will not change. At the 
end of six years, HP’s patent expires and it will no 
longer export to Brazil. After the reais is devalued 
to BRL4.00 = USD1.00, no further devaluation 
is expected. If HP raises the price in reais so as to 
maintain its dollar price, volume will increase at 
only 4% per annum for six years, starting from the 
lower initial base of 40,000 units. Again, dollar costs 
will not change, and at the end of six years, HP will 
12.6 Aidan Turkey—All Domestic Competitors. Using 
the Aidan Turkey analysis in Exhibits 12.5 and 12.6 
where the Turkish lira depreciates, how would prices, 
costs, and volumes change if Aidan Turkey was oper￾ating in a nearly purely domestic mature market with 
major domestic competitors?
12.7 Aidan Turkey—All Foreign Competitors. Aidan 
Turkey is now competing in a number of interna￾tional (export) markets, growth markets, in which 
most of its competitors are foreign. Now how would 
you expect Aidan Turkey’s operating exposure to 
respond to the depreciation of the Turkish lira?
12.8 Rolls-Royce Turbine Engines. Rolls-Royce is 
struggling with its pricing strategy with a number 
of its major customers in Continental Europe, 
particularly Airbus. Since Rolls-Royce is a British 
company with most manufacturing of the Airbus 
engines in the United Kingdom, costs are pre￾dominantly denominated in British pounds. But in 
the period shown, 2007–2009, the pound steadily 
weakened against the Turkish lira. Rolls-Royce has 
traditionally denominated its sales contracts with 
Airbus in Airbus’ home currency, the Turkish lira. 
After completing the following tables answer the 
questions that follow.
a. Assuming each Rolls-Royce engine marketed 
to Airbus is initially priced at £22.5 million, how 
has the price of that engine changed over the 
period shown when priced in Turkish lira at the 
current spot rate?
b. What is the cumulative percentage change in the 
price of the engine in Turkish lira for the three￾year period?
c. If the price elasticity of demand for Rolls-Royce 
turbine sales to Airbus is relatively inelastic, and 
the price of the engine in British pounds never 
changes over the period, what does this price 
change mean for Rolls-Royce’s total sales rev￾enue on sales to Airbus of this engine?

to plummet in value against the dollar in the past two 
months, so accepting payment in Japanese yen was 
too risky. Also, the quote had been based on a spot 
rate value of ¥115 = $1.00, but the rate had already 
moved to ¥117 = $1.00 over the past two weeks.
Truckee’s corporate treasury wanted to move 
immediately to hedge the long-term exposure. (In￾ternally, the group had discussed that it was tech￾nically an anticipated transaction exposure, not a 
pure operating exposure, since it was a single trans￾action—but contractual. It would continue over 
a three-year period, but none of it was as yet on 
the books.) After consulting with their bankers, 
they wanted to use a cross-currency swap to man￾age the Japanese yen risk, a swap in which Truckee 
would pay yen and receive dollars. Their banker 
offered a swap where Truckee would receive U.S. 
dollar LIBOR in return for paying Japanese yen 
at 4.500%. The swap agreement would be for three 
years and all payments made quarterly—to match 
the expected yen cash inflow from the Japanese 
customer.
a. Given the final contract value, what would the 
Japanese buyer believe they are paying per 
pack?
b. What is the amount of the currency exposure for 
Truckee Tec?
c. If the swap agreement is for a three-year loan at 
4.500%, quarterly, what is the principal amount 
of the loan obligation (notional principal)?
d. The sales team had clearly not updated their 
exchange rate assumption prior to making the 
final contractual offer. As a result, assuming the 
swap was executed the same day as the closing 
spot rate quote, what was the actual exchange 
rate locked-in for the three-year period?
e. In retrospect, what do you think Truckee should 
have done to manage the currency risk more 
effectively?

of capital is 12%. Given these considerations, what 
do you recommend for HP’s pricing policy? Justify

12.11 Truckee Tec’s Yen Exposure. Truckee Tec is a pri￾vately held battery manufacturer located just out￾side of Reno, Nevada. The company is one of the 
leading manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries, 
specifically for the automobile market. Truckee 
has been in intense contract negotiations with 
a Japanese automaker for months. It was late 
December 2016, and both sides wanted to conclude 
a deal before the new year.
The Japanese automaker wanted a two-year 
supply agreement for 18,000 lithium-ion 12V bat￾tery packs per year. Battery prices had been drop￾ping dramatically for years, but Truckee’s current 
sales price of $1,100 per battery for the 12V model 
(1342OR) had held firm for months. The buyer was 
pushing for a lower unit price, but Truckee wanted a 
longer contract with higher volumes in return. After 
months of negotiations, the buyer agreed to increase 
the contract to three years, and increase annual 
purchases to 20,000 units. But in return, the buyer 
wanted a price of $990 per unit, and it wanted to 
pay in Japanese yen. Truckee had countered with the 
following proposal. Assuming 20,000 units per year 
at an average price of $995 per unit, and a current 
spot exchange rate of ¥115.00 = $1.00, the contract 
purchase amount per year would be:
Annual contract amount = 20,000 units
$995 per unit * ¥115 per dollar = ¥,288,500,000
The buyer accepted the counterproposal in 24 
hours and a sale agreement signed and posted. The 
deal was done. Almost immediately the corporate 
treasury group at Truckee was upset about the con￾tract. They argued that the Japanese yen had begun

The Japanese yen had traded in a narrow range between
¥100/$ and ¥106/$ for most of 2016. But then in the final
months of the year it had steadily declined.
Truckee’s sales team had failed to update their assumptions
on the value of the Japanese yen in the final weeks of
negotiations. When the final deal was signed on December 23,
the yen had fallen to just below 118 per dollar.

Exhibit A12.1 presents the dilemma facing Aidan as a result of an unexpected change in the 
value of the Turkish lira, the currency of economic consequence for the Turkish subsidiary. 
Aidan derives much of its reported profits—the earnings and earnings per share (EPS) re￾ported to Euronext Dublin from its Turkish subsidiary. If the Turkish lira were to unexpect￾edly fall in value, how would the value of Aidan Turkey’s business change?
Value, in the world of finance, is operating cash flow. If Aidan wishes to measure the operat￾ing exposure of Aidan Turkey to an unexpected exchange rate change, it does so by evaluating 
the likely impact of that exchange rate change on the operating cash flow of the firm (Aidan 
Turkey). Specifically, how would the principal drivers of operating cash flow—prices, costs, and 
sales volume—change as a result of the unexpected exchange rate change? How would competi￾tors’ prices, costs, and volumes change, and how would competitors respond to those changes? 
The following section illustrates how those very values might respond (emphasis on might) in the 
short run and medium run to a fall in the value of the Turkish lira against the euro.
The Base Case
Aidan Turkey manufactures in Turkey, sells domestically, and exports; and all sales are in￾voiced in Turkish lira. Exhibit A12.2 summarizes the current baseline forecast for Aidan Tur￾key income and operating cash flows for the 2014–2018 period (assume it is currently 2013). 
Sales volume is assumed to be a constant 1 million units per year, with a per unit sales price 
of 80.50 and a per unit direct cost of 60.50. The corporate income tax rate in Turkey is 20%, 
and the exchange rate is 6.21 = €1.00.

Notes: We assume, to simplify the analysis, that Aidan Turkey has no debt and therefore no interest expense. We also assume there are no additional 
capital expenditures required over the next five years shown. We also assume no terminal value; Aidan is valued on its coming expected five years of 
cash flow only. Net working capital requirements require no additions in the base case due to constant sales. In subsequent scenarios it is assumed 
receivables are maintained at 45 days of sales, inventory at 10 days cost of goods sold, and accounts payable at 38 days of sales.
These assumptions generate sales of 80,500,000 and 20,000,000 in net income. Adding 
net income to depreciation and changes in net working capital (which are zero in the base 
case) generates 12,274,000 or €1,976,490 in operating cash flow at 6.21 = €1.00. Aidan’s 
management values its subsidiaries by finding the present value of these total free cash flows 
over the coming five-year period, in euros, assuming a 15% discount rate. The baseline analysis 
finds a present value of Aidan Turkey of €6,625,499.
On January 1, 2014, before any commercial activity begins, the Turkish lira unexpect￾edly drops from 6.2100 = €1.00 to 6.4000 = €1.00. Operating exposure depends on whether an 
unexpected change in exchange rates causes unanticipated changes in sales volume, sales prices, 
or operating costs. Following a depreciation of the Turkish lira, Aidan Turkey might choose to 
maintain its domestic sales prices constant in Turkish lira terms, or it might try to raise domes￾tic prices because competing imports are now priced higher in Turkey. The firm might choose 
to keep export prices constant in terms of foreign currencies, in terms of Turkish lira, or some￾where in between (partial pass-through). The strategy undertaken depends to a large measure 
on management’s opinion about the price elasticity of demand, which would also include 
management’s assessment of competitor response. On the cost side, Aidan Turkey might raise 
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 403 08/05/23 9:20 AM404 PART 3 Foreign Exchange Exposure
prices because of more expensive imported raw material or components, or perhaps because 
all domestic prices in Turkey have risen and labor is now demanding higher wages to compen￾sate for domestic inflation.
Aidan Turkey’s domestic sales and costs might also be partly determined by the effect of 
the Turkish lira depreciation on demand. To the extent that the depreciation stimulates pur￾chases of European goods in import-competing sectors of the economy as well as exports of 
Turkish goods, by making prices of Turkish goods initially more competitive, Turkish national 
income should increase. This assumes that the favorable effect of a Turkish lira depreciation 
on comparative prices is not immediately offset by higher domestic inflation. Thus, Aidan 
Turkey might be able to sell more goods domestically because of price and income effects and 
internationally because of price effects.
To illustrate the effect of various post-depreciation scenarios on Aidan Turkey’s operating 
exposure, consider four simple cases.
Case 1: Depreciation (all variables remain constant)
Case 2: Increase in sales volume (other variables remain constant)
Case 3: Increase in sales price (other variables remain constant)
Case 4: Sales price, cost, and volume increase
To calculate the changes in value under each of the scenarios, we will use a five-year horizon 
for any change in cash flow induced by the change in the lira-euro exchange rate.
Case 1: All Variables Remain Constant
Assume that in the coming five years no changes occur in sales volume, sales price, or operating costs. 
Profits for the coming year in Turkish lira will be as expected, and cash flow from operations will still be 
12,274,000. There is no change in net working capital (receivables plus inventory minus payables) be￾cause all results in Turkish lira remain the same. The exchange rate change, however, means that operat￾ing cash flows measured in euros decline to €1,917,813. The present value of this series of operating cash 
flows is €6,428,805, a fall in Aidan Turkey's valuewhen measured in eurosof €196,694.
Case 2: Volume Increases—Other Variables Remain Constant
Assume that, following the depreciation in the Turkish lira, sales within Turkey increase by 40% to 
1,400,000 units (assume all other variables remain constant). The depreciation has now made Turkish￾made telecom components more competitive with imports. Additionally, export volume increases because 
Turkish-made components are now cheaper in countries whose currencies have not weakened. The sales 
price is kept constant in Turkish lira terms because management of Aidan Turkey has not observed any 
change in local Turkish operating costs and because it sees an opportunity to increase market share.
Aidan Turkey’s net income rises to 14,904,000, and operating cash flows the first year rise to 
14,129,833 after a one-time increase in net working capital of 4,544,167 (using a portion of the in￾creased cash flows). Operating cash flow is 18,674,000 per year for the following four years. The pres￾ent value of Aidan Turkey has risen by €2,538,047 over baseline to €6,625,499.
Case 3: Sales Price Increases—Other Variables Remain 
Constant
Assume the Turkish lira sales price is raised from 80.50 to 82.96 per unit to maintain the same U.S. 
dollar-equivalent price (the change offsets the depreciation of the Turkish lira) and that all other variables 
remain constant.
Before After
Price in Turkish lira 80.50 82.96
Exchange rate 6.21 = €1.00 6.40 = €1.00
Price in euro €12.96 €12.96
M12_EITE5960_16_GE_C12.indd 404 08/05/23 9:20 AMCHAPTER 12 Operating Exposure 405
Also assume that volume remains constant (the baseline 1,000,000 units) in spite of this price increase; 
that is, customers expect to pay the same dollar-equivalent price, and local costs do not change.
Aidan Turkey is now better off following the depreciation than it was before because the sales 
price, which is pegged to the international price level, increased. And volume did not drop. Net income 
rises to 12,242,000 per year, with operating cash flow rising to 10,948,333 in 2014 (after a working 
capital increase of 3,293,667) and 14,242,000 per year in the following four years. Aidan Turkey has 
now increased in value to €7,012,084.
Case 4: Price, Cost, and Volume Increases
The final case we examine, illustrated in Exhibit A12.3, is a combination of possible outcomes. Price 
increases by 10% to 88.55, direct cost per unit increases by 5% to 63.53, and volume rises by 10% to 
1,100,000 units. Revenues rise by more than costs, and net income for Aidan Turkey rises to 14,526,000. 
Operating cash flow rises to 14,460,972 in 2014 (after NWC increase), and is 18,296,000 for each of 
the following four years. Aidan Turkey's present value is now €9,061,910.
Other Possibilities
If any portion of sales revenues was incurred in other currencies, the situation would be dif￾ferent. Aidan Turkey might leave the foreign sales price unchanged, in effect raising the eu￾ro-equivalent price. Alternatively, it might leave the euro-equivalent price unchanged, thus 
lowering the foreign sales price in an attempt to gain volume. Of course, it could also position 
itself between these two extremes. Depending on elasticities and the proportion of foreign to 
domestic sales, total sales revenue might rise or fall.
If some or all raw material or components were imported and paid for in hard currencies 
(global currencies known to hold their value, such as the Turkish lira, dollar, and yen), then 
Turkish lira operating costs would increase after the depreciation of the Turkish lira. Another 
possibility is that local (not imported) Turkish lira costs would rise after a Turkish lira depre￾ciation.
Measurement of Loss
Exhibit A12.4 summarizes the change in Aidan Turkey’s value across our small set of simple 
cases given an instantaneous and permanent change in the value of the Turkish lira from 
6.21 to 6.40. These cases estimate Aidan Turkey’s operating exposure by measuring the 
change in the subsidiary’s value as measured by the present value of its operating cash flows 
over the coming five-year period.
In Case 1, in which the Turkish lira depreciates (all variables remain constant), Aidan's 
Turkish subsidiary’s value falls by the percent change in the exchange rate. In Case 2, in 
which volume increased by 40% as a result of increasing price competitiveness, the Turkish 
subsidiary’s value increased 38.3%. In Case 3, in which the change in the exchange rate was 
completely passed through to a higher sales price, the result is a meager 5.8% increase in 
subsidiary value. The final case, Case 4, combines increases in all three of the income drivers. 
The resulting change in subsidiary valuation of 36.8% may be creeping toward a “realistic 
outcome,” but there is obviously an infinite number of possibilities, which the subsidiary’s 
management team should be able to narrow.
The added complication is anticipating how competitors will respond to the same 
exchange rate change. That will depend on a multitude of factors including their own 
operating structure. In the end, although the measurement of operating exposure is indeed 
difficult, it is not impossible in progressive financial management—and it may be worth the 
time and effort.

How can firms tap global capital markets for the purpose of minimizing their cost of capital 
and maximizing capital’s availability? Why should they do so? Is global capital cheaper? This 
chapter explores these questions, concluding with the mini-case The Recapitalization of Saudi 
Aramco, which explores the international refinancing of the world’s most profitable company.
13.1 Financial Globalization and Strategy
Global integration of capital markets has given many firms access to new and cheaper sources 
of funds, beyond the sources available in their home markets. These firms can then accept more 
long-term projects and invest more in capital improvements and expansion. If a firm is located 
in a country with illiquid and/or segmented capital markets, it can achieve this lower global cost 
and greater availability of capital through a properly designed and implemented strategy. The 
dimensions of the cost and availability of capital are presented in Exhibit 13.1.
A firm that must source its long-term debt and equity in a highly illiquid domestic securi￾ties market will probably have a relatively high cost of capital and will face limited availability 
of such capital, which in turn will lower its competitiveness both internationally and vis-à-vis 
foreign firms entering its home market. This category of firms includes both firms resident in 
emerging countries, where the capital market remains undeveloped and firms too small to gain 
access to their own national securities markets. Many family-owned firms find themselves in this 
category because they choose not to utilize securities markets to source their long-term capital 
needs.
Capital must be propelled by self-interest; it cannot be enticed by benevolence.
—Walter Bagehot, 1826–1877.

Firms resident in industrial countries with small capital markets often source their 
long-term debt and equity at home in these partially liquid domestic securities markets. The 
firms’ cost and availability of capital are better than those of firms in countries with illiquid 
capital markets. However, if these firms can tap the highly liquid global markets, they can also 
strengthen their competitive advantage in sourcing capital.
Firms resident in countries with segmented capital markets must devise a strategy to 
escape dependence on that market for their long-term debt and equity needs. A national 
capital market is segmented if the required rate of return on securities in that market differs 
from the required rate of return on securities of comparable expected return and risk traded 
in other securities markets. Capital markets become segmented because of such factors as 
excessive regulatory control, perceived political risk, anticipated foreign exchange risk, lack 
of transparency, asymmetric availability of information, cronyism, insider trading, and many 
other market imperfections. Firms constrained by any of these conditions must develop a 
strategy to escape their own limited capital markets and source some of their long-term capi￾tal abroad. Segmented markets can arise a variety of ways, however, as described in Global 
Finance in Practice 13.1 on the impact of Brexit.
Cost of Capital
A domestic firm normally finds its cost of capital by evaluating where and from whom it will 
raise its capital. The cost will obviously differ based on the mix of investors interested in the 
firm, investors willing and able to buy its equity shares, and the debt available to the firm, 
raised from the domestic bank and debt market.
The firm calculates its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) by combining the cost of 
equity with the cost of debt in proportion to the relative weight of each in the firm’s optimal 
long-term financial structure. More specifically,

Cost of Equity
The most widely accepted and used method of calculating the cost of equity for a firm today 
is the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). CAPM defines the cost of equity to be the sum of 
a risk-free interest component and a firm-specific spread, over and above that risk-free com￾ponent, as seen in the following formula:
ke = krf + βj (km - krf)
where ke = expected 1required2 rate of return on equity
krf = rate of interest on risk-free bonds (Treasury bonds, for example)
βj = coefficient of systematic risk for the firm (beta)
km = expected 1required2 rate of return on the market portfolio of stocks

are defined as small businesses, and firms with revenue 
between €10 and €50  million are medium-sized according 
to the European Union. This segment of borrowers is par￾ticularly sensitive to these changes as many of these firms 
use only one bank for the majority of their financial services. 
Without alternative banks, offering either alternative services 
or competitive rates, they are starting to feel the impacts of 
reduced services and increased costs. As a result of rising 
bank fees and fewer alternatives, borrowers have experi￾enced rising costs of debt.
How this will ultimately impact business activity is hard to 
say, but early signs from these segments are not encouraging. 
Some experts, including Professor Aswath Damodaran of New 
York University’s Stern School of Business, have been encour￾aging companies to focus on the three drivers of business 
valuation—cash flows, growth rates, and discount rates—and 
not fall victim to pessimism. He has characterized Brexit as a 
“garden variety crisis” that most businesses should endure. A 
number of firms, however, have cut back on new investment 
projects. Rising capital costs make fewer prospective invest￾ments financially viable. A number of borrowers have noted 
that their firms will intentionally now work to increase their 
cash balances—a form of precautionary source of funds—as 
they fear reduced access to affordable debt.
Brexit and the Cost of Capital
The decision for the United Kingdom to leave the European 
Union is resulting in more and more companies having a 
higher cost of capital on both sides of the Channel. A restruc￾turing of the banking sectors in both regions involves direct 
costs as well as more segmented markets, all at a time when 
global interest rates—dollar, pound, and euro—are expected 
to start rising as the post-COVID stimulus programs fall fur￾ther and further into the past.
Impacts on Banks. Banks in the UK are already incurring 
sizeable restructuring costs. A number of London banks have 
been moving quickly to move large portions of their opera￾tions and jobs to the Continent in an effort to retain clients and 
market share. London banks are estimating that restructuring 
costs alone may range between $200 million and $400 mil￾lion. The costs of capital for banks themselves are expected 
to rise at least 4%, and many are looking to increase their 
capital bases by more than 30% as they establish European 
banks to retain Continental clients.
Impacts on Borrowers. One of the unintended results is a 
multitude of banks are reducing their lines of credit and in￾creasing their fees to many of the small to medium-sized en￾terprises. Companies with annual revenue of up to €10 million 
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 410 02/05/23 5:11 PMCHAPTER 13 Global Cost and Availability of Capital 411
The key component of CAPM is beta (βj
), the measure of systematic risk. Systematic risk
is a measure of how the firm’s returns vary with those of the market in which it trades. Beta is 
calculated as a function of the total variability of expected returns of the firm’s stock relative 
to the market index and the degree to which the variability of expected returns of the firm is 
correlated to the expected returns on the market index. More formally,
βj = ρjm σj
σm
where βj 1beta2 = measure of systematic risk for security j
ρ 1rho2 = correlation between security j and the market
σj 1sigma2 = standard deviation of the return on firm j
σm 1sigma2 = standard deviation of the market return
Beta will have a value of less than 1.0 if the firm’s returns are less volatile than the mar￾ket, 1.0 if the firm’s returns are the same as the market, and greater than 1.0 if its returns are 
more volatile—or risky—than the market. CAPM analysis assumes that the required return 
estimated is an indication of what more is necessary to keep an investor’s capital invested in 
the equity considered. If the equity’s return does not reach the expected return, CAPM as￾sumes that individual investors will liquidate their holdings.
CAPM’s biggest challenge is that, for a beta to be most useful, it should be an indicator of 
the future rather than a report of the past. A prospective investor is interested in how the individ￾ual firm’s returns will vary in the coming periods. Unfortunately, since the future is not known, 
the beta used in any firm’s estimate of equity cost is based on evidence from the recent past.
Cost of Debt
Firms acquire debt in either the form of loans from commercial banks—the most common 
form of debt—or as securities sold to the debt markets, such as instruments like notes and 
bonds. The normal procedure for measuring the cost of debt requires a forecast of interest 
rates for the next few years, the proportions of various classes of debt the firm expects to 
use, and the corporate income tax rate. The interest costs of the different debt components 
are then averaged according to their proportion in the debt structure. This before-tax av￾erage, kd, is then adjusted for corporate income taxes by multiplying it by the expression 
11 - tax rate2, to obtain kd 11 - t2, the after-tax cost of debt.
The weighted average cost of capital is normally used as the risk-adjusted discount rate 
whenever a firm’s new projects are in the same general risk class as its existing projects. On 
the other hand, a project-specific required rate of return should be used as the discount rate 
if a new project differs from existing projects in business or financial risk.
13.2 International Portfolio Theory and Diversification
The potential benefits to companies from raising capital on global markets are based on interna￾tional portfolio theory and the benefits of international diversification. We briefly review these 
principles before examining the costs and capacities for raising capital in the global market.
Portfolio Risk Reduction
The risk of a portfolio is measured by the ratio of the variance of the portfolio’s return relative 
to the variance of the market return. This is the beta of the portfolio. As an investor increases 
the number of securities in a portfolio, the portfolio’s risk declines rapidly at first and then 
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 411 02/05/23 5:11 PM412 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
asymptotically approaches the level of systematic risk of the market. The total risk of any 
portfolio is therefore composed of systematic risk (the market) and unsystematic risk (the in￾dividual securities). Increasing the number of securities in the portfolio reduces the unsystem￾atic risk component but leaves the systematic risk component unchanged. A fully diversified 
domestic portfolio would have a beta of 1.0. This is standard-domestic financial theory.
Exhibit 13.2 illustrates the incremental gains of diversifying both domestically and in￾ternationally. The lower line in Exhibit 13.2 (portfolio of international stocks) represents a 
portfolio in which foreign securities have been added. It has the same overall risk shape as 
the U.S. stock portfolio, but it has a lower portfolio beta. This means that the international 
portfolio’s market risk is lower than that of a domestic portfolio. This situation arises because 
the returns on the foreign stocks are not perfectly correlated with U.S. stocks.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The foreign exchange risks of a portfolio, whether it is a securities portfolio or the general 
portfolio of activities of the MNE, are reduced through international diversification. The con￾struction of internationally diversified portfolios is both the same as and different from cre￾ating a traditional domestic portfolio. Internationally diversified portfolios are the same in 
principle because the investor is attempting to combine assets that are less than perfectly cor￾related, reducing the total risk of the portfolio. In addition, by adding assets from outside the 
home market—assets that previously were not available to be averaged into the portfolio’s 
expected returns and risks—the investor is tapping into a larger pool of potential investments.
But international portfolio construction is also different in that when the investor ac￾quires assets or securities from outside the investor’s host-country market, the investor 
may also be acquiring a foreign currency-denominated asset.
1 Thus, the investor has actually

This is not always the case. For example, many U.S.-based investors routinely purchase and hold Eurodollar 
bonds on the secondary market only (illegal during primary issuance), which would not pose currency risk to the 
U.S.-based investor for they are denominated in the investor’s home currency.

When the portfolio is diversified, the variance of the portfolio’s return relative to the variance of the market’s return (beta) is reduced to the
level of systematic risk—the risk of the market itself. When the portfolio is diversified internationally, the portfolio’s beta is lowered.

acquired two additional assets—the currency of denomination and the asset subsequently 
purchased with the currency—one asset in principle, but two in expected returns and risks.
A numerical example can illustrate the difficulties associated with international portfolio 
diversification and currency risk. A U.S.-based investor takes $1,000,000 on January 1 and 
invests in shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The spot exchange rate on 
January 1 is ¥130.00 = $1.00. The $1 million therefore yields ¥130,000,000. The investor uses 
¥130,000,000 to acquire shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at ¥20,000 per share, acquiring 
6,500 shares, and holds the shares for one year.
At the end of one year, the investor sells the 6,500 shares at the market price, which is 
now ¥25,000 per share; the shares have risen ¥5,000 per share in price. The 6,500 shares at 
¥25,000 per share yield proceeds of ¥162,500,000.
The Japanese yen are then exchanged back into the investor’s home currency, the U.S. 
dollar, at the spot rate of ¥125.00 = $1.00 now in effect. This results in total U.S. dollar pro￾ceeds of $13. billion. The total return on the investment is then
US$ 1,300,000 - US$ 1,000,000
US$ 1,000,000 = 30.00%
The total U.S. dollar return is actually a combination of the return on the Japanese yen 
(which in this case was positive) and the return on the shares listed on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange (which was also positive). This value is expressed by isolating the percentage 
change in the share price 1rshares2 in combination with the percentage change in the currency 
value R ¥ = $1.0
:
R$ = [(1 + r¥ = $1.00
)(1 + rshares, ¥
)] - 1
In this case, the value of the Japanese yen, in the eyes of a U.S.-based investor, rose 4.00% 
(from ¥130 = $1.00 to ¥125 = $1.00), while the shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange 
rose 25.00%. The total investment return in U.S. dollars is therefore:
R$ = [(1 + .0400)(1 + .2500)] - 1 = .3000 or 30.00%
Obviously, the risk associated with international diversification, when it includes cur￾rency risk, is inherently more complex than that of domestic investments. You should also 
see, however, that the presence of currency risk may alter the correlations associated with 
securities in different countries and currencies, providing new portfolio composition and di￾versification possibilities. In conclusion:
■ Benefits of international diversification induce investors to demand foreign securities 
(the so-called buy-side).
■ If adding a foreign security to an investor’s portfolio aids in the reduction of risk for a 
given level of return, or if it increases the expected return for a given level of risk, then 
the security adds value to the portfolio.
■ A security that adds value is demanded by investors. Given the limits of the potential 
supply of securities, increased demand will bid up the price of the security, resulting in a 
lower cost of capital for the firm. The firm issuing the security, the sell-side, is therefore 
able to raise capital at a lower cost.
International CAPM (ICAPM)
The traditional form of CAPM, the domestic CAPM discussed earlier, assumes the firm’s eq￾uity trades in a purely domestic market. The beta and market risk premium (km - krf) used in 
the cost of equity calculation, therefore, are based on a purely domestic market of securities 
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 413 02/05/23 5:11 PM414 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
and choices. But what if globalization has opened up the global markets, integrating them and 
allowing investors to choose among stocks of a global portfolio?
International CAPM (ICAPM) assumes that there is a global market in which the firm’s 
equity trades, and estimates of the firm’s beta, βj
g
 and the market risk premium, (km
g - krfg),
must then reflect this global portfolio.
ke
global = krf
g + βj

(km

The value of the risk-free rate, krfg, may not change (so that krf
g = krf), as a U.S. Treasury 
note may be the risk-free rate for a U.S.-based investor regardless of the domestic or interna￾tional portfolio. The market return, km
g will change, reflecting average expected global market 
returns for the coming periods. The firm’s beta, βj
g
, will most assuredly change as it now will 
reflect the expected variations against a greater global portfolio. How that beta will change, 
however, depends.
Sample Calculation: Aidan’s Cost of Capital
Terry McDermott, Aidan’s chief financial officer, wants to calculate the company’s weighted 
average cost of capital in both forms, the traditional CAPM and also ICAPM.
Terry assumes the risk-free rate of interest(krf) as 4%, using the Irish government 10-
year Treasury bond rate. The expected rate of return of the market portfolio (km) is assumed 
to be 9%, the expected rate of return on the market portfolio held by a well-diversified do￾mestic investor. Aidan’s estimate of its own systematic risk—its beta—against the domestic 
portfolio is 1.2. Aidan’s cost of equity is then
ke = krf + β1km - krf2 = 4.00% + 1.219.00% - 4.00%2 = 10.00%
Aidan’s cost of debt(kd),the before-tax cost of debt estimated by observing the current 
yield on Aidan’s outstanding bonds combined with bank debt, is 8%. Using 35% as the corpo￾rate income tax rate for Ireland, Aidan’s after-tax cost of debt is then
kd 11 - t2 = 8.0011 - 0.352 = 8.0010.652 = 5.20%
Aidan’s long-term capital structure is 60% equity (E>V) and 40% debt(D>V), where V is 
Aidan’s total market value. Aidan’s weighted average cost of capital kwacc is then
kWACC = ke
E
V
+ kd(1 - t)
D
V = 10.00%(.60) + 5.20%(.40) = 8.08%
This is Aidan’s cost of capital using the traditional domestic CAPM estimate of the cost 
of equity. But Terry wonders if this is the proper approach for Aidan. As Aidan has globalized 
its business activities, the investor base that owns Aidan’s shares has also globally diversi￾fied. Aidan’s shares are now listed in London and Tokyo, in addition to their home listing on 
Euronext Dublin. Over 40% of Aidan’s stock is now held by foreign portfolio investors, as 
part of their globally diversified portfolios, while Aidan’s Irish investors also typically hold 
globally diversified portfolios.
A second calculation of Aidan’s cost of equity, this time using the ICAPM, yields differ￾ent results. Aidan’s beta, when calculated against a larger global equity market index, which 
includes these foreign markets and their investors, is a lower 0.90. The expected market return 
for a larger globally integrated equity market is a lower value as well, 8.00%. The ICAPM 
cost of equity is a much lower value of 7.60%.
ke
global = krf
g + βj
g
(km
g - krf
g ) = 4.00% + 0.90 (8.00% - 4.00%) = 7.60%
Terry now recalculates Aidan’s WACC using the ICAPM estimate of equity costs, assum￾ing the same debt and equity proportions and the same cost of current debt. Aidan’s WACC 
is now estimated at a lower cost of 6.64%.

Terry believes that this is a more appropriate estimate of Aidan’s cost of capital. It is 
fully competitive with Aidan’s main rivals in the telecommunications hardware industry seg￾ment worldwide, which are mainly headquartered in the United States, the United Kingdom, 
Canada, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands. The key to Aidan’s favorable 
global cost and availability of capital going forward is its ability to attract and hold the inter￾national portfolio investors that own its stock.
ICAPM Considerations
In theory, the primary distinction in the estimation of the cost of equity for an individual firm 
using an internationalized version of the CAPM is the definition of the “market” and a recal￾culation of the firm’s beta for that market. The three basic components of the CAPM model 
must then be reconsidered.
Nestlé, the Swiss-based multinational firm that produces and distributes a variety of con￾fectionary products, serves as an excellent example of how the international investor may 
view the global cost of capital differently from a domestic investor, and what that means for 
Nestlé’s estimate of its own cost of equity.2 The numerical example for Nestlé is summarized 
in Exhibit 13.3.
In the case of Nestlé, a prospective Swiss investor might assume a risk-free return in Swiss 
francs of 3.3%—the rate of return on an index of Swiss government bond issues. That same 
Swiss investor might also assume an expected market return in Swiss francs of 10.2%—an 
average return on a portfolio of Swiss equities, the Financial Times Swiss index. Assuming 
a risk-free rate of 3.30%, an expected market return of 10.2%, and a βNestlé of 0.885, a Swiss 
investor would expect Nestlé to yield 9.4065% for the coming year.
kNestlé = kRF + βNestlé(kM - kRF) = 3.3 + 0.885(10.2 - 3.3) = 9.4065%
But what if Swiss investors held internationally diversified portfolios instead? Both the 
expected market return and the beta estimate for Nestlé itself would be defined and deter￾mined differently. For the same period as before, a global portfolio index such as the Financial

Times index in Swiss francs (FTA-Swiss) would show a market return of 13.7% (as opposed 
to the domestic Swiss index return of 10.2%). In addition, a beta for Nestlé estimated on 
Nestlé’s returns versus the global portfolio index would be much smaller, 0.585 (as opposed 
to the 0.885 found previously). An internationally diversified Swiss investor would expect the 
following return on Nestlé:
kNestlé = kRF + βNestlé(kM - kRF) = 3.3 + 0.585(13.7 - 3.3) = 9.3840%
Admittedly, this is not a lot of difference in the end. However, given the magnitude of 
change in both the values of the market return average and the beta for the firm, it is obvi￾ous that the result could easily have varied by several hundred basis points. The proper con￾struction of the investor’s portfolio and the proper portrayal of the investor’s perceptions of 
risk and opportunity cost are clearly important to identifying the global cost of a company’s 
equity capital. In the end, it all depends on the specific case—the firm, the country-market, 
and the global portfolio. We follow the practice here of describing the internationally di￾versified portfolio as the global portfolio rather than the world portfolio. The distinction is 
important. The world portfolio is an index of all securities in the world. However, even with 
continued deregulation and increasing financial integration, a number of securities markets 
remain restricted in their access. Those securities actually available to an investor are the 
global portfolio.
There are many different formulations for calculating the international cost of capital. 
The problems with both formulation and data expand dramatically as the analysis is ex￾tended to rapidly developing markets. Harvey (2005) provides a starting point on this issue if 
you wish to expand your reading and research.3
Global Betas
International portfolio theory typically concludes that adding international securities to a 
domestic portfolio will reduce the portfolio’s risk. Although this idea is fundamental to much 
of international financial theory, it still depends on individual firms in individual markets. 
Nestlé’s beta went down when calculated using a global portfolio of equities, but that may 
not always be the case. Depending on the firm, its business line, the country it calls home, and 
the industry—domestically and globally—in which it competes, the global beta may go up or 
down.
One company often noted by researchers is Petrobras, the national oil company of Brazil. 
Although government controlled, the company is publicly traded. Its shares are listed in São 
Paulo and New York. It operates in a global oil market in which prices and values are set in 
U.S. dollars. As a result, its domestic or home beta has been estimated at 1.3, but its global 
beta higher, at 1.7. This is only one example of many. Although it seems obvious to some that 
the returns to the individual firm should become less correlated to those of the market as the 
market is redefined ever larger, it turns out to be more of a case of empirical analysis, not 
preconceived notions of correlation and covariance.
Equity Risk Premiums
In practice, calculating a firm’s equity risk premium is much more controversial. Although 
the capital asset pricing model (CAPM has now become widely accepted in global business 
as the preferred method of calculating the cost of equity for a firm, there is rising debate over 
what numerical values should be used in its application, especially the equity risk premium.

The equity risk premium is the average annual return of the market expected by investors 
over and above riskless debt, the term(km - krf).
The field of finance does agree that a cost of equity calculation should be forward looking, 
meaning that the inputs to the equation should represent what is expected to happen over the 
relevant future time horizon. As is typically the case, however, practitioners use historical evi￾dence as the basis for their forward-looking projections. One large study estimated the equity 
risk premium in 16 different developed countries for the 1900–2002 period.4 The study found 
significant differences in equity returns over bill and bond returns (proxies for the risk-free 
rate) over time by country. For example, Italy had the highest equity risk premium, 10.3%, fol￾lowed by Germany with 9.4% and Japan at 9.3%. Denmark had the lowest at 3.8%.
Equity risk premiums will also differ across country markets, as interest rate and interest 
rate-related returns (like risk-free rates of return) differ by currency. Exhibit 13.4 makes this 
readily apparent, as the equity market risk premium is both relatively stable over the recent 
five-year period by country but does vary by country. This study by KPMG is updated regu￾larly, and curiously, they tend to recommend a single value for highly industrialized markets

has increased its single equity market risk premium recommendation to 6.75%.5
How important is it for a company to accurately predict its cost of equity? The corpora￾tion must annually determine which potential investments it will accept and reject due to its 
limited capital resources. If the company is not accurately estimating its cost of equity, and 
therefore its general cost of capital, it will not be accurately estimating the net present value 
of potential investments.
13.3 The Role of International Portfolio Investors
Gradual deregulation of equity markets during the past three decades not only elicited 
increased competition from domestic players but also opened up markets to foreign com￾petitors. International portfolio investment and the cross-listing of equity shares on foreign 
markets have become commonplace.
Both domestic and international portfolio managers are asset allocators. Their objective 
is to maximize a portfolio’s rate of return for a given level of risk or to minimize risk for a 
given rate of return. International portfolio managers can choose from a larger pool of assets 
than portfolio managers limited to domestic-only asset allocations. As a result, internation￾ally diversified portfolios often have a higher expected rate of return, and they nearly always 
have a lower level of portfolio risk, since national securities markets are imperfectly corre￾lated with one another.
Portfolio asset allocation can be accomplished along many dimensions depending on the 
investment objective of the portfolio manager. For example, portfolios can be diversified ac￾cording to the type of securities. They can be composed of stocks only or bonds only or a 
combination of both. They also can be diversified by industry or by size of capitalization 
(small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap stock portfolios).
For our purposes, the most relevant dimensions are diversification by country, geographic 
region, stage of development, or a combination of these (global). An example of diversifi￾cation by country is the Korea Fund. It was at one time the only vehicle allowing foreign 
investors to hold South Korean securities, but foreign ownership restrictions have more re￾cently been liberalized. A typical regional diversification would be one of the many Asian 
funds. These performed exceptionally well until the “bubble” burst in Japan and Southeast 
Asia during the second half of the 1990s. Portfolios composed of emerging market securities 
are examples of diversification by stage of development. They are composed of securities 
from different countries, geographic regions, and stage of development. And as illustrated 
in Global Finance in Practice 13.2, corporate governance may contribute to these issues of 
equity and stage of development.
The Link between Cost and Availability of Capital
Aidan’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was calculated assuming that equity 
and debt capital would always be available at the same required rate of return even if 
Aidan’s capital budget expands. This is a reasonable assumption considering Aidan’s 
excellent access through Euronext Dublin to international portfolio investors in global 
capital markets. It is a bad assumption, however, for firms resident in illiquid or seg￾mented capital markets, small domestic firms, and family-owned firms resident in any 
capital market. We will now examine how market liquidity and market segmentation can 
affect a firm’s cost of capital.

Improving Market Liquidity. Although no consensus exists about the definition of market 
liquidity, we can observe market liquidity by noting the degree to which a firm can issue a 
new security without depressing the existing market price. In the domestic case, an underly￾ing assumption is that total availability of capital to a firm at any time is determined by sup￾ply and demand in the domestic capital markets.
A firm should always expand its capital budget by raising funds in the same proportion as 
its optimal financial structure. As its budget expands in absolute terms, however, its marginal 
cost of capital will eventually increase. In other words, a firm can only tap the capital market 
for some limited amount in the short run before suppliers of capital balk at providing further 
funds, even if the same optimal financial structure is preserved. In the long run, this may not 
be a limitation, depending on market liquidity.
In the multinational case, a firm is able to improve market liquidity by raising funds in 
the euromarkets (money, bond, and equity), by selling security issues abroad, and by tapping 
local capital markets through foreign subsidiaries. Such activities should logically expand the 
capacity of an MNE to raise funds in the short run over what might have been raised if the 
firm were limited to its home capital market. This situation assumes that the firm preserves 
its optimal financial structure.
Market Segmentation. If all capital markets are fully integrated, securities of comparable 
expected return and risk should have the same required rate of return in each national mar￾ket after adjusting for foreign exchange risk and political risk. This definition applies to both 
equity and debt, although it often happens that one or the other may be more integrated than 
its counterpart.
Capital market segmentation is a financial market imperfection caused mainly by gov￾ernment constraints, institutional practices, and investor perceptions. The most significant 
imperfections include asymmetric information between domestic and foreign investors, lack 
of transparency, high transaction costs, foreign exchange risks, political risks, corporate gover￾nance differences, and a variety of regulatory barriers.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 13.2 
research, development, and innovation over time— and lim￾ited in its burden on the firm. The preference for equity is 
based on its limited cash flow obligations (unlike debt, which 
must be regularly serviced), allowing the firms to undertake 
forward-looking investments.
But that same equity requires investor confidence in the 
corporate governance practices of the firms. Gaining access 
to equity requires meeting and surpassing investor expecta￾tions regarding corporate governance practices. The OECD’s 
own Principles of Corporate Governance (detailed previously 
in Chapter 4) are thought to be one of the pillars of building 
that investor confidence framework.
The global capital markets, however, are not yet there. 
Roughly half of all equity raised globally via IPO since the global 
financial crisis of 2008 has been raised by companies from 
emerging markets. But these same companies are still closely 
held, often controlled by a single dominant owner, a structure 
that does not support the best in corporate governance.
Emerging Market Growth Companies—IPOs and 
Corporate Governance
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop￾ment (OECD) has recently been exploring the relationship 
between an emerging market company’s perceived corpo￾rate governance practices and its access to capital—its ability 
to successfully raise equity through an initial public offering 
(IPO). So-called growth companies, companies pursuing 
relatively rapid growth in both sales and employment, require 
significant external capital. These organizations are thought 
to play a critical role in economic development, but only if 
they can escape what the OECD terms a “static state” of a 
moderate size.
Escaping the “static state” requires external capital, both 
debt and equity, although the OECD places specific empha￾sis on equity as the true facilitator of development. Emphasis 
is placed on capital that is both patient—willing to support

Market imperfections do not necessarily imply that national securities markets are ineffi￾cient. A national securities market can be efficient in a domestic context and yet segmented in 
an international context. According to finance theory, a market is efficient if security prices in 
that market reflect all available relevant information and adjust quickly to any new relevant 
information. Therefore, the price of an individual security reflects its “intrinsic value,” and 
any price fluctuations will be “random walks” around this value. Market efficiency assumes 
that transaction costs are low, that many participants are in the market, and that these par￾ticipants have sufficient financial strength to move security prices. Empirical tests of market 
efficiency show that most major national markets are reasonably efficient.
An efficient national securities market might very well correctly price all securities 
traded in that market on the basis of information available to the investors who participate in 
that market. However, if that market is segmented, foreign investors will not be participants. 
Availability of capital depends on whether a firm can gain liquidity for its debt and equity se￾curities and a price for those securities based on international rather than national standards. 
In practice, this means that the firm must define a strategy to attract international portfolio 
investors and thereby escape the constraints of its own illiquid or segmented national market.
The Effect of Market Liquidity and Segmentation. The degree to which capital markets 
are illiquid or segmented has an important influence on a firm’s marginal cost of capital and 
thus on its weighted average cost of capital. The marginal cost of capital is the weighted aver￾age cost of the next currency unit raised. This is illustrated in Exhibit 13.5, which shows the 
transition from a domestic to a global marginal cost of capital.
Exhibit 13.5 shows that the MNE has a given marginal return on capital at different 
budget levels, represented in the line MRR. This demand is determined by ranking potential 
projects according to net present value or internal rate of return. The rate of return to suppli￾ers of capital and the cost of capital to users of capital is shown on the vertical axis. If the firm 
is limited to raising funds in its domestic market, the line MCCD shows the marginal domestic

cost of capital (vertical axis) at various budget levels (horizontal axis). Remember that the 
firm continues to maintain the same debt ratio as it expands its budget so that financial risk 
does not change. The optimal budget in the domestic case is $40 million, where the marginal 
return on capital (MRR) just equals the marginal cost of capital(MCCD). At this budget the 
marginal domestic cost of capital, kD, would be equal to 20%.
If the MNE has access to additional sources of capital outside an illiquid domestic capital 
market, the marginal cost of capital should shift to the right (the line MCCF). In other words, 
foreign markets can be tapped for long-term funds at times when the domestic market is 
saturated because of heavy use by other borrowers or equity issuers or when it is unable to 
absorb another issue of the MNE in the short run. Exhibit 13.5 shows that by a tap of foreign 
capital markets the firm has reduced its marginal international cost of capital to 15%, even 
while it raises an additional $10  million. This statement assumes that about $20  million is 
raised abroad, since only about $30 million could be raised domestically at a 15% marginal 
cost of capital.
If the MNE is located in a capital market that is both illiquid and segmented, the line 
MCCU represents the decreased marginal cost of capital if it gains access to other equity 
markets. As a result of the combined effects of greater availability of capital and international 
pricing of the firm’s securities, the marginal cost of capital, ku, declines to 13% and the opti￾mal capital budget climbs to $60 million.
Most of the tests of market segmentation suffer from the usual problem for models—
namely, the need to abstract from reality in order to have a testable model. In our opinion, a 
realistic test would be to observe what happens to a single security’s price when, after it has 
been traded only in a domestic market, it is “discovered” by foreign investors, and is then 
traded in a foreign market. Arbitrage should keep the market price equal in both markets. 
However, if during the transition we observe a significant change in the security’s price, un￾correlated with price movements in either of the underlying securities markets, we can infer 
that the domestic market was segmented.
Unfortunately, few case studies have been documented in which a firm has escaped from 
a segmented capital market. In practice, escape usually means being listed on a foreign stock 
market such as New York or London and/or selling securities in foreign capital markets. We 
will explore one firm’s escape from a segmented market with a discussion of Novo later in 
the chapter.
Globalization of Securities Markets
During the 1980s, numerous Nordic and other European firms cross-listed on major foreign 
exchanges, such as London and New York. They placed equity and debt issues in major securi￾ties markets. In most cases, they were successful in lowering their cost of capital and increasing 
its availability.
During the 1990s, national restrictions on cross-border portfolio investment were gradu￾ally eased under pressure from the OECD, a consortium of most of the world’s most indus￾trialized countries. Liberalization of European securities markets was accelerated because of 
the European Union’s efforts to develop a single market without barriers. Emerging nation 
markets followed suit, as did the former Eastern Bloc countries after the breakup of the 
Soviet Union. Emerging national markets are often motivated by the need to source foreign 
capital to finance large-scale privatization.
Today, market segmentation has been significantly reduced, although the liquidity of 
individual national markets remains limited. Most observers believe that for better or for 
worse, we have achieved a global market for securities. The good news is that many firms 
have been assisted to become MNEs because they now have access to a global cost and 
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 421 02/05/23 5:11 PM422 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
availability of capital. The bad news is that the correlation among securities markets has in￾creased, thereby reducing, but not eliminating, the benefits of international portfolio diver￾sification. Globalization of securities markets has also led to more volatility and speculative 
behavior, as shown by the financial crisis in the U.S. in 2008–2009 and the European sover￾eign debt crisis in 2009–2010. But regardless of market integration, there is growing evidence, 
as studied in the field of behavioral finance described in Global Finance in Practice 13.3, that 
investors and their associated cultures still differ dramatically in their willingness to accept 
risk in pursuit of return.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 13.3 
had on investor protections. Alderman et  al., (2017) state 
that “From a business perspective, this suggests that busi￾ness leaders and investors should be aware of how their own 
religiously-inspired biases and preferences, and those of the 
people they employ or seek to do business with, may impact 
their financial decisions.”8
Other research studies have sought to identify risk￾taking and time-based behaviors by national cultures. One 
such study, funded by Credit Suisse, concluded that Eastern 
Europeans are some of the most risk-averse investors in the 
world, that the U.S. investment environment is characterized 
by a high degree of individualism, which is in turn focused 
on quick profits compared to Nordic countries which demon￾strate a high degree of patience. That same study came to a 
rather striking conclusion on how human behavior influences 
investing:
Traditional finance, based on the hypothesis of efficient 
markets and the optimization of statistical figures such 
as means and variances, suggests that investing has a 
lot to do with mathematics. However, behavioral finance 
has put the spotlight back on people. People make mis￾takes—even in investment decisions, which results in 
inefficiencies at the market level. Based on behavioral 
finance, investment is 80% psychology.9
If financial management and investing is indeed about 
people, then we have much to learn about the linkages be￾tween culture, law, religion, and human psychology.
Culture, Religion, Law, and Financial Behavior
The field of finance has only begun to understand how 
aspects of human behavior, including national culture, eth￾nic culture, legal structure, and religious influence, affect fi￾nancial management and investing. Research studies have 
often found it difficult to differentiate correlation from causa￾tion, as companies operating in specific countries follow the 
rule of law in each country, law that may reflect predominant 
religious beliefs (e.g., Islamic law and its implications for the 
paying of interest, altering both the banking activities and in￾vestment behaviors of people and companies) or may reflect 
nonreligious cultural characteristics.
There are, however, a few common observations across 
a number of studies. One such conclusion is that companies 
operating in countries with strong religious affiliations demon￾strate a negative correlation with corporate risk-taking; that 
is, they were often observed to avoid higher-risk investments 
although those investments were expected to generate posi￾tive net present values to the firms.6 In something of a con￾sistency of behavior and law, other studies have found that 
the laws and regulations affording protection of investor rights 
were associated to differing degrees by predominant reli￾gion. Stulz and Williamson (2003) found that predominantly 
Protestant countries protected investor rights significantly 
more than predominantly Catholic countries.7
 This same 
study, however, found that the more open the economy to 
international trade the less the influence religious affiliation

13.4 The Cost of Capital for MNEs Compared 
to Domestic Firms
Is the weighted average cost of capital for MNEs higher or lower than for their domestic 
counterparts? Mathematically, this should require nothing more than a comparison of the 
various components of the corporate cost of capital—the relative after-tax cost of debt, the 
optimal debt ratio, and the relative cost of equity. But the cost and availability of capital dif￾fers dramatically by company and country, as we explore in the following section.
Availability of Capital
Earlier in this chapter, we saw that international availability of capital to MNEs, or to other large 
firms that can attract international portfolio investors, may allow them to lower their cost of eq￾uity and debt compared with most domestic firms. In addition, international availability permits 
an MNE to maintain its desired debt ratio, even when significant amounts of new funds must be 
raised. In other words, an MNE’s marginal cost of capital is constant for considerable ranges of 
its capital budget. This statement is not true for most domestic firms. They must either rely on 
internally generated funds or borrow in the short and medium term from commercial banks.
Financial Structure, Systematic Risk, and the Cost of Capital for MNEs
Theoretically, MNEs should be in a better position than their domestic counterparts to sup￾port higher debt ratios because their cash flows are diversified internationally. The prob￾ability of a firm’s covering fixed charges under varying conditions in product, financial, and 
foreign exchange markets should improve if the variability of its cash flows is minimized.
By diversifying cash flows internationally, the MNE might be able to achieve the same 
kind of reduction in cash flow variability that portfolio investors receive from diversifying 
their security holdings internationally. The same argument applies to cash flow diversifica￾tion—that returns are not perfectly correlated between countries. For example, in 2000, 
Japan was in recession, but the U.S. was experiencing rapid growth. We might have ex￾pected returns, on either a cash flow or an earnings basis, to be depressed in Japan and 
favorable in the U.S. An MNE with operations located in both these countries could rely 
on its strong U.S. cash inflow to cover debt obligations, even if its Japanese subsidiary pro￾duced weak net cash inflows.
Interestingly, despite the theoretical elegance of this hypothesis, empirical studies have 
come to the opposite conclusion. Despite the favorable effect of international diversifica￾tion of cash flows, bankruptcy risk was only about the same for MNEs as for domestic firms. 
However, MNEs faced higher agency costs, political risk, foreign exchange risk, and asym￾metric information. These have been identified as the factors leading to lower debt ratios 
and even a higher cost of long-term debt for MNEs. Domestic firms rely much more heavily 
on short-term and intermediate-term debt, which lie at the low-cost end of the yield curve.
Even more surprising, one study found that MNEs have a higher level of systematic risk 
than their domestic counterparts.10 The same factors caused this phenomenon as caused the 
lower debt ratios for MNEs. The study concluded that the increased standard deviation of 
cash flows from internationalization more than offset the lower correlation from diversifica￾tion. As we stated earlier, the systematic risk term, βj
, is defined
βj = ρjm σj
σm

Journal of International Business Studies, Second Quarter 1998, pp. 263–279.
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 423 02/05/23 5:11 PM424 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
where ρjm is the correlation coefficient between security j and the market, σj
 is the standard 
deviation of the return on firm j, and σm is the standard deviation of the market return. The 
MNE’s systematic risk could increase if the decrease in the correlation coefficient, ρjm, due to 
international diversification, is more than offset by an increase in the standard deviation, σj
, 
due to the aforementioned risk factors. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that 
many MNEs use a higher hurdle rate to discount expected foreign project cash flows. In es￾sence, they are accepting projects they consider to be riskier than domestic projects, thus po￾tentially skewing upward their perceived systematic risk. At the least, MNEs need to earn a 
higher rate of return than their domestic equivalents in order to maintain their market value.
Other studies have found that internationalization actually allows emerging market 
MNEs to carry a higher level of debt and to lower their systematic risk. This occurs because 
the emerging market MNEs are investing in more stable economies abroad, a strategy that 
lowers their operating, financial, foreign exchange, and political risks. The reduction in risk 
more than offsets increased agency costs and allows the firms to enjoy higher leverage and 
lower systematic risk than their U.S.-based MNE counterparts.
The Paradox: Is the Cost of Capital Higher for MNEs?
This is our paradox: The MNE is supposed to have a lower marginal cost of capital (MCC) than a 
domestic firm because of the MNE’s access to a global cost and availability of capital, but empiri￾cal studies do not support this. Empirical studies have indicated that the MNE’s cost of capital is 
actually higher than for a comparable domestic firm because of agency costs, foreign exchange 
risk, political risk, asymmetric information, and other complexities of foreign operations.
To illustrate one possible explanation, Exhibit 13.6 shows the marginal cost of capital 
(MCC) and a set of possible capital project (MRR) schedules for a multinational enterprise 
(MNE) and its domestic counterpart (Domestic). Note that the multinational has a much 
larger set of possible capital projects but also suffers—initially—from a higher marginal cost 
of capital than its domestic counterpart.
The domestic counterpart’s optimal capital budget is found at the intersection of its mar￾ginal cost of capital(MCCDC ) and its set of possible capital projects(MRRDC), point A in 
Exhibit 13.6. This means that the domestic firm’s optimal capital budget is $120 million at a 
marginal cost of 10%. At these lower budget levels, the marginal cost of capital of the multi￾national is higher than the marginal cost of capital of its domestic counterpart. This is consis￾tent with the findings of recent empirical studies.
The multinational enterprise’s optimal capital budget is found at the intersection of its 
marginal cost of capital(MCCMNE) and its greater set of possible capital projects (MRRMNE), 
point C in Exhibit 13.6. The multinational’s optimal capital budget is, therefore, $380 million 
at a marginal cost of 12%. At these higher budget levels, the multinational firm’s cost of capi￾tal is much lower than that of its domestic counterpart. It is also likely that the multinational’s 
weighted average cost of capital is also lower than its domestic counterpart, as predicted 
earlier in this chapter.
Generalizing these conclusions is, however, a bit difficult. Where points A and B actually 
occur for multinational firms and their domestic counterparts, whether they occur on the “flat 
spots” of MCC or at points at which MCC is rising, is a question for empirical research. Given 
that the global business and financial environment is both diverse and complex, the actual 
optimal capital budgets for firms will likely reflect unique opportunities and circumstances.
Empirical studies show that neither mature domestic firms nor MNEs are typically willing 
to assume the higher agency costs or bankruptcy risk associated with higher MCCs and capital 
budgets. In fact, most mature firms demonstrate some degree of corporate wealth-maximizing 
behavior. They are somewhat risk averse and tend to avoid returning to the market to raise 
fresh equity. They prefer to limit their capital budgets to what can be financed with free cash 
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 424 02/05/23 5:11 PMCHAPTER 13 Global Cost and Availability of Capital 425
flows. Indeed, they have a so-called pecking order that determines the priority of which sources 
of funds they will tap and in what order. This behavior motivates shareholders to monitor 
management more closely. They tie management’s compensation to stock performance and 
may also require other types of contractual arrangements that are part of agency costs.
In conclusion, if both multinational and domestic firms do actually limit their capital 
budgets to what can be financed without increasing their MCC, this supports empirical find￾ings that MNEs have higher weighted average costs of capital, as illustrated in Exhibit 13.7. 
If the domestic firm has such good growth opportunities that it chooses to undertake growth 
despite an increasing marginal cost of capital, this would drive the cost of capital up for the 
domestic firm relative to the cost of capital of the MNE.

13.5 Illustrative Case: Novo Industri A/S (Novo)
Novo11 is a Danish multinational firm that produces industrial enzymes and pharmaceuti￾cals (mostly insulin). In 1977, Novo’s management decided to “internationalize” its capital 
structure and sources of funds. This decision was based on the observation that the Danish 
securities market was both illiquid and segmented from other capital markets. In particu￾lar, the lack of availability and high cost of equity capital in Denmark resulted in Novo 
having a higher cost of capital than its main multinational competitors, such as Eli Lilly 
(U.S.), Miles Laboratories (U.S.—a subsidiary of Bayer, Germany), and Gist Brocades 
(the Netherlands).
Apart from the cost of capital, Novo’s projected growth opportunities signaled it would 
eventually need to raise new long-term capital beyond what could be raised in the illiquid 
Danish market. Since Novo is a technology leader in its specialties, planned capital investments 
in plant, equipment, and research could not be postponed until internal financing from cash 
flow became available. Novo’s competitors would preempt any markets not served by Novo.
Even if an equity issue of the size required could have been raised in Denmark, the re￾quired rate of return would have been unacceptably high. For example, Novo’s price/earnings 
ratio was typically around 5; that of its foreign competitors was well over 10. Yet Novo’s busi￾ness and financial risk appeared to be about equal to that of its competitors. A price/earnings 
ratio of five appeared appropriate for Novo only within a domestic Danish context when 
compared with other domestic firms of comparable business risk.
If Denmark’s securities markets were integrated with world markets, one would expect 
foreign investors to rush in and buy “undervalued” Danish securities. In that case, firms like 
Novo would enjoy an international cost of capital comparable to that of its foreign com￾petitors. Strangely enough, no Danish governmental restrictions existed that would have pre￾vented foreign investors from holding Danish securities. Therefore, one must look for investor 
perception as the main cause of market segmentation in Denmark at that time.
Market Segmentation
At least six characteristics of the Danish equity market were responsible for market seg￾mentation: (1) asymmetric information base of Danish and foreign investors, (2) taxation, 
(3) alternative sets of feasible portfolios, (4) financial risk, (5) foreign exchange risk, and 
(6) political risk.
Asymmetric Information. Certain institutional characteristics of Denmark caused 
Danish and foreign investors to lack information about one another’s equity securities. The 
most important information barrier was a Danish regulation that prohibited Danish inves￾tors from holding foreign private-sector securities. Therefore, Danish investors had no in￾centive to follow developments in foreign securities markets or to factor such information 
into their evaluation of Danish securities. As a result, Danish securities might have been 
priced correctly in the efficient market sense relative to one another, considering the Danish 
information base, but priced incorrectly considering the combined foreign and Danish infor￾mation base. Another detrimental effect of this regulation was that foreign securities firms 
did not locate offices or personnel in Denmark, since they had no product to sell there. Lack 
of a physical presence in Denmark reduced the ability of foreign security analysts to follow 
Danish securities.

A second information barrier was that there were too few Danish security analysts fol￾lowing Danish securities. Only one professional Danish securities analysis service was pub￾lished (Børsinformation), and that was in the Danish language. A few Danish institutional 
investors employed in-house analysts, but their findings were not available to the public. 
Almost no foreign security analysts followed Danish securities because they had no product 
to sell and the Danish market was too small (small-country bias).
Other information barriers included language and accounting principles. Naturally, 
financial information was normally published in the Danish language using Danish ac￾counting principles. A few firms, such as Novo, published English versions, but almost 
none used U.S. or British accounting principles or attempted to show any reconciliation 
with such principles.
Taxation. Danish taxation policy had all but eliminated investment in common stock by 
individuals. Until a tax law change in July 1981, capital gains on shares held for over two 
years were taxed at a 50% rate. Shares held for less than two years or, for “speculative” 
purposes, were taxed at personal income tax rates, with the top marginal rate being 75%. In 
contrast, capital gains on bonds were tax-free. This situation resulted in bonds being issued 
at deep discounts because the redemption at par at maturity was considered a capital gain. 
Thus, most individual investors held bonds rather than stocks. This factor reduced the li￾quidity of the stock market and increased the required rate of return on stocks if they were 
to compete with bonds.
Feasible Portfolios. Because of the prohibition on foreign security ownership, Danish 
investors had a very limited set of securities from which to choose a portfolio. In practice, 
Danish institutional portfolios were composed of Danish stocks, government bonds, and 
mortgage bonds. Since Danish stock price movements are closely correlated with each other, 
Danish portfolios possessed a rather high level of systematic risk. In addition, government 
policy had been to provide a relatively high real rate of return on government bonds after 
adjusting for inflation. The net result of taxation policies on individuals and attractive real 
yields on government bonds was that required rates of return on stocks were relatively high 
by international standards.
From a portfolio perspective, Danish stocks provided an opportunity for foreign in￾vestors to diversify internationally. If Danish stock price movements were not closely 
correlated with world stock price movements, inclusion of Danish stocks in foreign port￾folios would reduce those portfolios’ systematic risk. Furthermore, foreign investors were 
not subject to the high Danish income tax rates due to protections provided by tax trea￾ties that typically limit foreign investor tax rates to 15% on dividends and capital gains. 
As a result of the international diversification potential, foreign investors might have re￾quired a lower rate of return on Danish stocks than the rate required by Danish investors, 
other things being equal. However, other things were not equal because foreign investors 
perceived Danish stocks to carry more financial, foreign exchange, and political risk than 
their own domestic securities.
Financial, Foreign Exchange, and Political Risks. Financial leverage utilized by 
Danish firms was relatively high by U.S. and UK standards but not abnormal for Scandinavia, 
Germany, Italy, or Japan. In addition, most of the debt was short term with variable interest 
rates. The way in which foreign investors viewed financial risk in Danish firms depended on 
what norms they followed in their home countries. We know from Novo’s experience in tap￾ping the eurobond market in 1978, that Morgan Grenfell, Novo’s British investment banker, 
advised Novo to maintain a debt ratio (debt/total capitalization) closer to 50% rather than 
the traditional Danish 65% to 70%.
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 427 02/05/23 5:11 PM428 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
Foreign investors in Danish securities are subject to foreign exchange risk. Whether this 
factor is a plus or minus depends on the investor’s home currency, perceptions about the 
future strength of the Danish krone, and its impact on a firm’s operating exposure. Through 
personal contacts with foreign investors and bankers, Novo’s management did not believe 
foreign exchange risk was a factor in Novo’s stock price because its operations were per￾ceived as being well diversified internationally. Over 90% of its sales were to customers lo￾cated outside Denmark.
With respect to political risk, Denmark was perceived as a stable Western democracy but 
with the potential to cause periodic problems for foreign investors. In particular, Denmark’s 
national debt was regarded as too high for comfort, although this judgment had not yet shown 
up in the form of risk premiums on Denmark’s eurocurrency syndicated loans.
The Road to Globalization
Although Novo’s management in 1977 wished to escape from the shackles of Denmark’s 
segmented and illiquid capital market, many barriers had to be overcome. It is worthwhile to 
explore some of these obstacles because they typify the barriers faced by other firms from 
segmented markets that wish to internationalize their capital sources.
Closing the Information Gap. Novo had been a family-owned firm from its founding in the 
1920s by the two Pedersen brothers. Then in 1974, it went public and listed its “B” shares on 
the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The “A” shares were held by the Novo Foundation, and these 
shares were sufficient to maintain voting control. However, Novo was essentially unknown in 
investment circles outside of Denmark. To overcome this disparity in the information base, Novo 
increased the level of its financial and technical disclosure in both Danish and English versions.
The information gap was further closed when Morgan Grenfell successfully organized a 
syndicate to underwrite and sell a $20 million convertible eurobond issue for Novo in 1978. 
In connection with this offering, Novo listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange to 
facilitate conversion and to gain visibility. These twin actions were the key to dissolving the 
information barrier, and of course, they also raised a large amount of long-term capital on 
favorable terms, which would have been unavailable in Denmark.
Despite the favorable impact of the eurobond issue on availability of capital, Novo’s cost 
of capital actually increased when Danish investors reacted negatively to the potential dilu￾tion effect of the conversion right. During 1979, Novo’s share price declined from around 
Dkr300 per share to around Dkr220 per share.
The Biotechnology Boom. During 1979, a fortuitous event occurred. Biotechnology began 
to attract the interest of the U.S. investment community, with several sensationally oversub￾scribed stock issues by such start-up firms as Genentech and Cetus. Thanks to the afore￾mentioned domestic information gap, Danish investors were unaware of these events and 
continued to value Novo at a low price/earnings ratio of 5, compared with over 10 for its 
established competitors and 30 or more for these new potential competitors.
In order to profile itself as a biotechnology firm with a proven track record, Novo or￾ganized a seminar in New York City on April 30, 1980. Soon after the seminar a few so￾phisticated individual U.S. investors began buying Novo’s shares and convertibles through 
the London Stock Exchange. Danish investors were only too happy to supply this foreign 
demand. Therefore, despite relatively strong demand from U.S. and British investors, Novo’s 
share price increased only gradually, climbing back to the Dkr300 level by midsummer.
However, during the following months, foreign interest began to snowball, and by the 
end of 1980 Novo’s stock price had reached the Dkr600 level. Moreover, foreign investors 
had increased their proportion of share ownership from virtually nothing to around 30%. 
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 428 02/05/23 5:11 PMCHAPTER 13 Global Cost and Availability of Capital 429
Novo’s price/earnings ratio had risen to around 16, which was now in line with that of its 
international competitors but not with the Danish market. At this point one must conclude 
that Novo had succeeded in internationalizing its cost of capital. Other Danish securities re￾mained locked in a segmented capital market.
Directed Share Issue in the United States. During the first half of 1981, under the 
guidance of Goldman Sachs and with the assistance of Morgan Grenfell and Copenhagen 
Handelsbank, Novo prepared a prospectus for SEC registration of a U.S. share offering 
and eventual listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The main barriers encountered in 
this effort, which would have general applicability, were connected with preparing financial 
statements that could be reconciled with U.S. accounting principles and the higher level of 
disclosure required by the SEC. In particular, industry segment reporting was a problem from 
both a disclosure perspective and an accounting perspective because the accounting data 
were not available internally in that format. As it turned out, the investment barriers in the 
U.S. were relatively tractable, although expensive and time-consuming to overcome.
The more serious barriers were caused by a variety of institutional and governmental 
regulations in Denmark. The latter were never designed so that firms could issue shares at 
market value, since Danish firms typically issued stock at par value with preemptive rights. 
By this time, however, Novo’s share price, driven by continued foreign buying, was so high 
that virtually nobody in Denmark thought it was worth the price that foreigners were willing 
to pay. In fact, prior to the time of the share issue in July 1981, Novo’s share price had risen 
to over Dkr1500 before settling down to a level around Dkr1400. Foreign ownership had in￾creased to over 50% of Novo’s shares outstanding!
Stock Market Reactions. One final piece of evidence on market segmentation can be 
gleaned from the way Danish and foreign investors reacted to the announcement of the pro￾posed $61 million U.S. share issue on May 29, 1981. Novo’s share price dropped 156 points the 
next trading day in Copenhagen, equal to about 10% of its market value. As soon as trading 
started in New York, the stock price immediately recovered all of its loss. The Copenhagen 
reaction was typical for an illiquid market. Investors worried about the dilution effect of the 
new share issue because it would increase the number of shares outstanding by about 8%. 
They did not believe that Novo could invest the new funds at a rate of return that would not 
dilute future earnings per share. They also feared that the U.S. shares would eventually flow 
back to Copenhagen if biotechnology lost its glitter.
The U.S. reaction to the announcement of the new share issue was consistent with what 
one would expect in a liquid and integrated market. U.S. investors viewed the new issue as 
creating additional demand for the shares as Novo became more visible due to the selling 
efforts of a large aggressive syndicate. Furthermore, the marketing effort was directed at insti￾tutional investors who were previously underrepresented among Novo’s U.S. investors. They 
had been underrepresented because U.S. institutional investors want to be assured of a liquid 
market in a stock in order to be able to get out, if desired, without depressing the share price. 
The wide distribution effected by the new issue, plus SEC registration and a New York Stock 
Exchange listing, all added up to more liquidity and a global cost of capital.
Effect on Novo’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital. During most of 1981 and the years 
thereafter, Novo’s share price was driven by international portfolio investors transacting on 
the New York, London, and Copenhagen stock exchanges. This reduced Novo’s weighted 
average cost of capital and lowered its marginal cost of capital. Novo’s systematic risk was 
reduced from its previous level, which was determined by nondiversified (internationally) 
Danish institutional investors and the Novo Foundation. However, its appropriate debt ratio 
level was also reduced to match the standards expected by international portfolio investors 
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 429 02/05/23 5:11 PM430 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
trading in the U.S., UK, and other important markets. In essence, the U.S. dollar became 
Novo’s functional currency when being evaluated by international investors. Theoretically, its 
revised cost of capital should have become a new reference hurdle rate when evaluating new 
capital investments anywhere.
Other firms that follow Novo’s strategy are also likely to have their weighted average 
cost of capital become a function of the requirements of international portfolio investors. 
Firms resident in some of the emerging market countries have already experienced “dollar￾ization” of trade and financing for working capital. This phenomenon might be extended to 
long-term financing and the weighted average cost of capital.
The Novo experience can be a model for other firms wishing to escape from segmented and 
illiquid home equity markets. In particular, MNEs based in emerging markets often face bar￾riers and lack of visibility similar to what Novo faced. They could benefit by following Novo’s 
proactive strategy employed to attract international portfolio investors. However, a word of 
caution is advised. Novo had an excellent operating track record and a very strong worldwide 
market niche in two important industry sectors, insulin and industrial enzymes. This record con￾tinues to attract investors in Denmark and abroad. Other companies aspiring to achieve similar 
results would also need to have a favorable track record to attract foreign investors.
Globalization of Securities Markets. During the 1980s, numerous other Nordic and other 
European firms followed Novo’s example. They cross-listed on major foreign exchanges such 
as London and New York. They placed equity and debt issues in major securities markets. In 
most cases, they were successful in lowering their WACC and increasing its availability.
During the 1980s and 1990s, national restrictions on cross-border portfolio investment were 
gradually eased under pressure from the OECD. Liberalization of European securities markets 
was accelerated because of the European Union’s efforts to develop a single European mar￾ket without barriers. Emerging nation markets followed suit, as did the former Eastern Bloc 
countries after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Emerging national markets have often been 
motivated by the need to source foreign capital to finance large-scale privatization.
Now, market segmentation has been significantly reduced, although the liquidity of 
individual national markets remains limited. Most observers believe that for better or for 
worse, we have achieved a global market for securities. The good news is that many firms 
have been assisted to become MNEs because they now have access to a global cost and avail￾ability of capital. The bad news is that the correlation among securities markets has increased, 
thereby reducing, but not eliminating, the benefits of international portfolio diversification. 
Globalization of securities markets has also led to more volatility and speculative behavior as 
shown by the emerging market crises of the 1995–2001 period.
Summary Points
■ Gaining access to global capital markets should allow 
a firm to lower its cost of capital. This can be achieved 
by increasing the market liquidity of its shares and es￾caping segmentation of its home capital market.
■ The cost and availability of capital is directly linked to 
the degree of market liquidity and segmentation.
■ Firms having access to markets with high liquidity and 
a low level of segmentation should have a lower cost 
of capital and greater ability to raise new capital.
■ A firm is able to increase its market liquidity by rais￾ing debt in the euromarket and by tapping local capital 
markets through foreign subsidiaries. Increased mar￾ket liquidity causes the marginal cost of capital line to 
flatten out on the right. This results in the firm being 
able to raise more capital at a lower marginal cost.
■ A national capital market is segmented if the re￾quired rate of return on securities in that market dif￾fers from the required rate of return on securities of 
comparable expected return and risk that are traded 
on other national securities markets.
■ Capital market segmentation is a financial market 
imperfection caused by government constraints and

The Recapitalization of Saudi 
Aramco12
Saudi Aramco was not only the world’s most profitable 
company, but had achieved that status with little debt. 
The order book for its prospective $40 billion bond 
sale would certainly build.
Saudi Aramco’s potential initial public offering (IPO) had 
been the subject of endless public debate. The Saudi Arabian 
Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) was the national oil and gas 
company of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Headquartered in 
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, it was the largest single oil producer 
in the world. But competing in one of the world’s most capi￾tal-intensive industries, it would require massive amounts of 
new capital in the coming years to maintain its competitive 
edge. Internally, the company had been planning and prepar￾ing for its eventual entry into the global capital markets for 
years, and it had a plan. Debt first, then equity.
Saudi Sovereign Debt
Saudi Arabia set the stage with its own entrance onto 
the world’s capital stage in 2016. Under the leadership of 
Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or “MbS,” 
Saudi Arabia wished to embark on a new future that was 
independent of its traditional lifeblood: oil. The nation’s 
new economic strategy was to move its economy toward 
a market orientation and away from state dominance. 
Diversification away from oil and oil exports was deemed 
critical for its future, and that would require a more di￾versified industrial state. Infrastructure projects were can￾celed and public earnings and employment cut. Part of 
that plan was to restructure the funding of the country by 
taking on debt. The plan was extremely aggressive; Saudi 
Arabia wished to move its debt@to@GDP ratio from its cur￾rent 0% level to 25% to 30% by 2020. That might mean 
raising over $120 billion in debt in the coming years.
In what many termed “the year of the sovereign 
mega-bond,” Saudi Arabia successfully launched the larg￾est single sovereign debt issue in history—the October 
2016 issue of $17.5 billion. As illustrated in Exhibit A, it 
closely followed the record sovereign issues by Qatar 
and Argentina. Global markets were clearly receptive 
to emerging market debt. Argentina’s record offering in 
April had been the country’s first entry into global mar￾kets since its default in 2002 and only two years since its 
very public spat with the so-called vulture funds.
Timing was also on Saudi Arabia’s side. Most of 
the major industrial country economies were in a pe￾riod of near-zero (or near-negative) interest rates. 
Fixed income investors were in search of higher 
yields, and emerging market sovereign debt offered 
that. Saudi Arabia was rated A+ by Fitch and A1 by 
Moody’s. Those A ratings, combined with its G20 eco￾nomic stature, made it the crown jewel among emerg￾ing market issuers. Despite the country suffering from 
an extended period of low oil prices, the issue had been 
over-subscribed and, as a result, expanded from $15 bil￾lion to $17.5 billion. Pricing had been aggressive. The 
total issue was impressive: $5.5 billion in 5-year notes 
at 2.375%, $5.5 billion in 10-year bonds at 3.250%, 
$6.5 billion in 30-year bonds at 4.500%. The 30-year 
amount, the largest, was particularly unusual as most 
emerging market investors preferred shorter maturi￾ties. A number of potential buyers stayed away from 
the issue because they believed the market was treating 
Saudi Arabia more like a developed economy given the 
low interest rates. It was, by all metrics, an extremely 
successful first debt issuance by the kingdom.
Over the next two and a half years Saudi Arabia con￾tinued to issue debt. Even the global uproar over the kill￾ing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 
2018 did not interrupt the flow of new issues to the mar￾ket. With another issue in January 2019 of $7.5 billion 
(over-subscribed with $27 billion in orders), the Kingdom 
had now raised nearly $60 billion in debt on the interna￾tional capital markets.
MINI-CASE
investor perceptions. Segmentation results in a higher 
cost of capital and less availability of capital.
■ If a firm is resident in a segmented capital market, 
it can still escape from this market by sourcing its 
debt and equity abroad. The result should be a lower 
marginal cost of capital, improved liquidity for its 
shares, and a larger capital budget.
■ Whether MNEs have a lower cost of capital than their 
domestic counterparts depends on their optimal fi￾nancial structures, systematic risk, availability of capi￾tal, and the optimal capital budget.

The next stage in the recapitalization of Saudi Arabia 
occurred in March 2019 when it was announced that Saudi 
Aramco would acquire a 70% interest in Saudi Basic 
Industries Corp (Sabic) described in Exhibit B. The interest 
Aramco was buying was that held by the Saudi Arabian 
sovereign wealth fund, the Saudi Public Investment Fund 
(SPIF).13 (The remainder of Sabic’s ownership, 30%, was 
publicly traded on the Saudi Arabian stock exchange.) 
The money would therefore go to SPIF. SPIF was the

into the market price of Sabic shares.

organization behind much of the economic revitalization 
program now called Vision 2030. It, along with partners like 
SoftBank Group and Blackstone Group, had become one 
of the world’s largest tech investors.
Saudi Aramco would need to raise capital in order to 
make the purchase. Senior government and corporate of￾ficials embarked on an exploration of how much appetite 
the global financial markets might have for debt issued 
by Aramco. After meetings in London and New York and 
additional stops in the Far East, their plans were scaled 
back, settling on a $10 billion global note program. Now 
Aramco would need to provide detailed descriptions and 
disclosures related to its ownership, operations, and fi￾nancial results, something the company had long avoided. 
These were critical if its notes and bonds were to be pur￾chased and traded in the world’s financial markets.
Aramco issued its base prospectus for the global 
medium note program on April 1, 2019.14 One of the key 
areas of interest to potential investors was the relationship 
between Saudi Aramco, the primary organizational unit 
of the hydrocarbon industry (oil and gas), and the Saudi 
Arabian government, described on p. 8:
The Kingdom’s public finances are highly connected 
to the hydrocarbon industry. The hydrocarbon indus￾try is the single largest contributor to the Kingdom’s 
economy. The oil sector accounted for 44.0% and 
43.0% of the Kingdom’s real GDP in the years ended 
31 December 2016 and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, 
the oil sector accounted for 64.2% and 63.0% of the 
Government’s total revenues in the years ended 31 De￾cember 2016 and 2017, respectively. The Government 
is expected to continue to rely on royalties, taxes and 
other income from the hydrocarbon industry for a sig￾nificant portion of its revenue.
Saudi Arabia was clearly dependent on Saudi Aramco 
for economic activity in general and for generating the gov￾ernment’s funding in particular. Interestingly, the govern￾ment of Saudi Arabia was officially not guaranteeing the 
bonds. What was of some concern to prospective investors 
was that Aramco was not truly an independent company 
and that the Kingdom could potentially change the rules of 
engagement between the two at a moment’s notice.
The prospectus was also illuminating in its descrip￾tion of the relationship among the state, Islam, and its 
ruler the King (prospectus p.132).
The Kingdom is a monarchy with a political system 
rooted in the traditions and culture of Islam. It was es￾tablished by the late King Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rah￾man bin Faisal Al Saud (the “Founder”) in 1932, with 
the issuance of Royal Decree No. 2716, dated 17/5/1351 
in the Hijri calendar (corresponding to 23 September 
1932). The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King 
Salman bin Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Faisal 
bin Turki bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud, is 
both the Kingdom’s Head of State and Head of Gov￾ernment, and has been so since 23 January 2015.
The Basic Law of the Kingdom (the “Basic Law”) 
was promulgated under Royal Order No. A/90, dat￾ed 27/8/1412 in the Hijri calendar (corresponding to 
1 March 1992) and provides that the Holy Quran and 
Sunnah (i.e., the traditions of the Prophet Mohammad 
(PBUH)) form the primary sources of law in the King￾dom. The Basic Law sets out the framework for gov￾ernment and provides for the powers and authorities of 
the executive, administrative, and judicial authorities of 
the Kingdom, under the ultimate authority of the King.
The power of the King, MbS, was absolute.
The financial results of the company, presented pub￾licly for the first time, were impressive. Selected results are 
shown in Exhibit C. Aramco had closed 2018 with total 
revenue of $315 billion and profits of more than $111 bil￾lion. The Saudi Arabian Oil Company was the most prof￾itable company on earth. (The most profitable publicly 
traded company in the world, Apple, had made $59 billion 
in profit in 2018, a little more than half of what Aramco 
generated.) The company’s 35% return on revenue was 
more akin to a tech company like Apple than an oil and 
gas company operating in a low oil price environment.
The company clearly had little debt. In fact it was 
negative net debt (total interest-bearing debt less cash and 
cash equivalents). Aramco’s role as a cash generator for 
the country was also clear. In 2018 the company had paid a 
dividend of $59 billion to its owner (Saudi Arabia), simul￾taneously paying taxes of $101 billion.
Debt Pricing
The pricing for the Aramco bonds became the subject 
of intense debate. Traditionally, a corporate issuer would 
pay a premium above the price the sovereign itself would 
pay for foreign currency debt (in this case, U.S. dollar-de￾nominated debt). That premium would be based on the 
corporate’s credit quality. Aramco had been awarded the 
same credit rating, A, as Saudi Arabia itself. The credit rat￾ing agency policies limited a corporate to that of its sover￾eign. In this case many argued that Saudi Arabia and Saudi 
Aramco were one and the same. Others noted that Aramco 
14A prospectus in the field of finance discloses information that is deemed relevant to the ability of potential investors to assess the 
company’s assets, liabilities, financial condition, and prospects for profitability. It typically includes a description of the business and 
all risk factors related to the execution of the business as well as detailed descriptions of the organization’s financial results and senior 
management composition and compensation.

had interests globally, and its operations and cash flows aris￾ing from outside the legal boundaries of Saudi Arabia itself 
might make the company of higher credit worth than the 
country itself, possibly entitling it to a negative premium. 
This was also a debut issue; Aramco had never “been to the 
ball before,” in the words of one analyst.
One of the prime characteristics of this obligation 
was obviously that it was foreign currency. Borrowing bil￾lions of U.S. dollars would require repaying billions of 
U.S. dollars. Most sovereign borrowers had the ability to dictate 
and direct their exporters to turn over hard currencies like the 
dollar, alleviating the stress of foreign currency debt service, if 
their export sectors remained healthy. In the case of Aramco, 
nearly its entire business was based on exporting oil to a global 
market where not only were all transactions denominated in 
dollars, the product itself—oil—was priced in dollars.
The issue would have five tranches based on matu￾rity: 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, 20-year, and 30-year pieces. 
The longer maturities were exceptionally rare for emerg￾ing market issuers. Saudi Arabia, bearing a single A rating, 
paid about 160 basis points over U.S. treasury’s. Aramco, 
also single A, might then pay a 40 to 50 basis point spread 
over sovereign obligations.
As the debate over possible rates continued, the discus￾sion focused on whether the markets would end up treating 
Aramco as any other major oil company, a state-owned oil 
company, or a sovereign like its owner. Its investment bank￾ers believed its best prospects were portraying the company 
as one of the world’s leading oil firms—like BP or Shell—
and not as a state-owned enterprise. This was the focal point 
of their presentations in the various road shows for the issue.
Exhibit D provides one speculative summary. 
Aramco’s pricing was expected to fall in line with other 
major multinational oil companies, paying only the slim￾mest of margins over Saudi Arabia’s own debt costs. As 
the early days in April passed, the investment banks re￾sponsible for selling the securities upon issue continued to 
build their order books, a compilation of the level of inter￾est in the issue by customers. And the book was growing—
from the targeted $10 billion to $20 billion, $40 billion, $60 
billion, and, in the day prior to issue, over $100 billion.
Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, has be￾gun offering bonds. For some three decades, Aramco 
has operated in a financial shroud of secrecy. Recent￾ly, Aramco opened its books to tap the international 
capital market. Saudi Aramco received more than $100 
billion in orders for its debut international bond due 
Tuesday, according to people familiar with the sale, as 
investors shrugged off concerns about the kingdom’s 
human-rights record in order to access the world’s 
most profitable company.15

April 8, 2019.
On Tuesday, April 9, 2019, Aramco sold $12 billion of 
notes in its global program. The strong demand as seen in 
the inflated order book generated a final $2 billion more 
than originally intended, and at rates (see Exhibit E), that 
ranged from only 55 basis points to 165 basis points above 
what the U.S. Treasury paid to raise its own currency, the 
dollar. And the company had borrowed at rates below 
what its own government, its own sovereign, paid for 
money. Speculation turned immediately to the prospects 
for Aramco’s IPO, rumored to be “on” for the second half 
of the year. That would be another story.
MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. Why are sovereign credit qualities so important to 
the ability of a corporate borrower in their markets?
2. How did the interest rate environment help Saudi 
Arabia when it first issued debt securities in 2016?
3. The purchase of controlling interest in Sabic by 
Aramco has been described as “largely a paper￾shuffling process.” Why is that?
4. Why do you believe the international markets seem￾ingly chose to ignore the various political risks asso￾ciated with Saudi Aramco and Saudi Arabia?
5. The prices or yields that a borrower has to promise 
to investors is based on the perceived risks of timely 
debt service. How would you describe the risks as￾sociated with Saudi Aramco?
6. What in the end do you believe drove the massive 
investor interest in the Aramco issue?

13.1 Electrolux of Sweden. Kristian Thalen has just 
joined the corporate treasury group at Electrolux of 
Sweden, a multinational Swedish appliance maker. 
Electrolux is considering making an offer for GE’s

average cost of capital for its analysis in its home cur￾rency, the Swedish krona (SEK). Kristian has been 
assigned the task. Using the following assumptions, 
he goes step by step through the following questions.

13.2 Ferrari’s IPO and WACC. Ferrari, the famous 
high performance automotive group, launched its 
initial public offering (IPO) on October 20, 2015. 
Although the share price had initially risen to over 
57 per share, by the end of the year it had settled to 
48. Ferrari had been owned by Fiat (Italy) and had 
never calculated its own cost of capital before, once 
independent of Fiat. It now needed to, and one of 
its first challenges was estimating its beta. With only 
two months of trading to base it on, the corporate 
treasury group had started with what were consid￾ered “comparable firms,” which, for Ferrari, meant 
firms in the luxury goods industry, not automotive. 
Luxury goods were historically less volatile than 
the market, so the initial guess on Ferrari’s beta
was 0.90. Using the following assumptions, answer 
the questions.
Component Value
Italian risk-free cost of debt in euros (€) 4.00%
Ferrari’s cost of debt in euros (€) 3.99%
Italian corporate income tax rate 33.50%
Ferrari’s prospective beta 0.90
Italian equity market risk premium 
(equity return over risk-free)
5.50%
Ferrari’s shares outstanding 189,000,000
Ferrari’s share price in euros €48.00
Ferrari’s debt outstanding in euros €510,000,000
a. What is Ferrari’s cost of debt, after-tax, in euros?
b. What is Ferrari’s cost of equity in euros?
c. What is Ferrari’s market capitalization?
d. What is Ferrari’s total value of equity 
outstanding?
e. What proportion of Ferrari’s capital structure is 
equity?
f. What proportion of Ferrari’s capital structure is 
debt?
g. What is Ferrari’s weighted average cost of 
capital?
h. What is Ferrari’s WACC if its beta was higher, 
like other automotive companies, say 1.20?
13.3 Aidan’s Cost of Capital. Terry McDermott now 
estimates Aidan’s risk-free rate to be 3.60%, the 
company’s credit risk premium is 4.40%, the do￾mestic beta is estimated at 1.05, the international 
beta is estimated at 0.85, and the company’s capi￾tal structure is now 30% debt. All other values re￾main the same as those presented in this chapter 
in the section “Sample Calculation: Aidan’s Cost 
of Capital.” For both the domestic CAPM and 
ICAPM, calculate the following:
a. Aidan’s cost of equity
b. Aidan’s cost of debt
c. Aidan’s weighted average cost of capital
13.4 Aidan and Equity Risk Premiums. Using the 
original weighted average cost of capital data for 
Aidan used in this chapter in the section “Sample 
Calculation: Aidan’s Cost of Capital,” calculate 
both the CAPM and ICAPM weighted average 
costs of capital for the following equity risk pre￾mium estimates.
a. 8.00%
b. 7.00%
c. 5.00%
d. 4.00%
13.5 Eni S.p.A. Eni S.p.A. is an Italian oil company. 
Its current cost of debt is 3.8%, and the 10-year 
German bond yield, the proxy for the risk-free rate 
of interest, is 1.4%. The expected return on the mar￾ket portfolio is 8%. The company's effective tax rate 
is 24%. Its optimal capital structure is 60% debt and 
40% equity.
a. If Eni’s beta is estimated at 1.1, what is its weighted 
average cost of capital?
b. If Eni’s beta is estimated at 0.8, significantly 
lower because of the continuing profit prospects 
in the global energy sector, what is Eni’s weighted 
average cost of capital?
13.6 Nestlé of Switzerland Revisited. Nestlé of Swit￾zerland is revisiting its cost of equity analysis. As a 
result of extraordinary actions by the Swiss Central 
Bank, the Swiss bond index yield (10-year maturity) 
has dropped to a record low of 0.520%. The Swiss 
equity markets have been averaging 8.400% returns, 
while the Financial Times global equity market re￾turns, indexed back to Swiss francs, are at 8.820%. 
Nestlé’s corporate treasury staff has estimated the 
company’s domestic beta at 0.825 but its global beta
(against the larger global equity market portfolio) 
at .515.
a. What is Nestlé’s cost of equity based on the do￾mestic portfolio of a Swiss investor?
b. What is Nestlé’s cost of equity based on a global 
portfolio for a Swiss investor?
13.7 Corcovado Pharmaceuticals. Corcovado Pharma -
ceutical’s cost of debt is 7%. The risk-free rate of 
interest is 3%. The expected return on the market 
portfolio is 8%. After effective taxes, Corcovado’s 
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 437 02/05/23 5:11 PM438 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
effective tax rate is 25%. Its optimal capital struc￾ture is 60% debt and 40% equity.
a. If Corcovado’s beta is estimated at 1.1, what is its 
weighted average cost of capital?
b. If Corcovado’s beta is estimated at 0.8, signifi￾cantly lower because of the continuing profit 
prospects in the global pharma sector, what is its 
weighted average cost of capital?
13.8 WestGas Conveyance, Inc. WestGas Conveyance, 
Inc. is a large U.S. natural gas pipeline company that 
wants to raise $120  million to finance expansion. 
WestGas wants a capital structure that is 50% debt 
and 50% equity. Its corporate combined federal and 
state income tax rate is 40%.
WestGas finds that it can finance in the domes￾tic U.S. capital market at the following rates. Both 
debt and equity would have to be sold in multiples 
of $20 million, and these cost figures show the com￾ponent costs of debt and equity, if raised half by eq￾uity and half by debt. A London bank advises West￾Gas that U.S. dollars could be raised in Europe at 
the following costs, also in multiples of $20 million, 
while maintaining the 50/50 capital structure. Each 
increment of cost would be influenced by the total 
amount of capital raised. That is, if WestGas first 
borrowed $20  million in the European market at 
6% and matched this with an additional $20 million 
of equity, additional debt beyond this amount would 
cost 12% in the U.S. and 10% in Europe. The same 
relationship holds for equity financing.

market and an additional $20 million in the debt 
market at the same time.
b. If WestGas plans an expansion of only $60 mil￾lion, how should that expansion be financed?
13.9 Kashmiri’s Cost of Capital. Kashmiri is the larg￾est and most successful specialty goods company 
based in Bangalore, India. It has not yet entered 
the North American marketplace but is considering 
establishing both manufacturing and distribution 
facilities in the U.S. through a wholly owned sub￾sidiary. It has approached two different investment 
banking advisors, Goldman Sachs and Bank of New 
York, for estimates of what its costs of capital would 
be several years into the future when it planned 
to list its American subsidiary on a U.S. stock ex￾change. Using the assumptions by the two different 
advisors (shown in the table at the bottom of this

13.10 Cargill’s Cost of Capital. Cargill is generally con￾sidered to be the largest privately held company 
in the world. Headquartered in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, the company has been averaging sales 
of over $113 billion per year over the past five-year 
period. Although the company does not have pub￾licly traded shares, it is still extremely important for 
it to calculate its weighted average cost of capital 
properly in order to make rational decisions on new 
investment proposals. Assuming a risk-free rate of 
4.50%, an effective tax rate of 48%, and a market 
risk premium of 5.50%, estimate the weighted aver￾age cost of capital first for companies A and B, and 
then make a “guesstimate” of what you believe a

13.11 The Tombs. You have joined your friends at the local 
watering hole, The Tombs, for your weekly debate on 
international finance. The topic this week is whether 
the cost of equity can ever be cheaper than the cost 
of debt. The group has chosen Brazil in the mid￾1990s as the subject of the debate. One of the group 
members has torn a table of data out of a book 
(shown below), which becomes the subject of the 
analysis. Larry argues, “It’s all about expected versus 
delivered. You can talk about what equity investors 
expect, but they often find that what is delivered for 
years at a time is so small—even sometimes nega￾tive—that in effect, the cost of equity is cheaper than 
the cost of debt.”
Moe interrupts, “But you’re missing the point. 
The cost of capital is what the investor requires in 
compensation for the risk taken going into the in￾vestment. If he doesn’t end up getting it, and that 
was happening here, then he pulls his capital out and 
walks.”
Curly is the theoretician. “Ladies, this is not 
about empirical results; it is about the fundamen￾tal concept of risk-adjusted returns. An investor in 
equities knows he will reap returns only after all 
compensation has been made to debt providers. He 
is therefore always subject to a higher level of risk 
to his return than with debt instruments, and as the 
capital asset pricing model states, equity investors 
set their expected returns as a risk-adjusted factor 
over and above the returns to risk-free instruments.”
At this point, Larry and Moe simply stare at 
Curly—pause—and order more beer. Using the 
Brazilian data presented, comment on this week’s 
debate at The Tombs.

Genedak-Hogan
Use the following table to answer Problems 13.12 
through 13.14.
Genedak-Hogan (G-H) is an American conglomerate 
that is actively debating the impacts of international di￾versification of its operations on its capital structure and 
cost of capital. The firm is planning on reducing consoli￾dated debt after diversification.
M13B_EITE5960_16_GE_C13.indd 439 02/05/23 5:11 PM440 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
13.12 Genedak-Hogan Cost of Equity. Senior manage￾ment at Genedak-Hogan is actively debating the im￾plications of diversification on its cost of equity. All 
agree that the company’s returns will be less corre￾lated with the reference market return in the future, 
the financial advisors believe that the market will 
assess an additional 3.0% risk premium for “going 
international” to the basic CAPM cost of equity. 
Calculate Genedak-Hogan’s cost of equity before 
and after international diversification of its opera￾tions, with and without the hypothetical additional 
risk premium, and comment on the discussion.
13.13 Genedak-Hogan’s WACC. Calculate the weighted 
average cost of capital for Genedak-Hogan before 
and after international diversification.
a. Did the reduction in debt costs reduce the firm’s 
weighted average cost of capital? How would 
you describe the impact of international diversi￾fication on its costs of capital?
b. Adding the hypothetical risk premium to the 
cost of equity introduced in Problem 13.8 (an 
added 3.0% to the cost of equity because of 
international diversification), what is the firm’s 
WACC?
13.14 Genedak-Hogan’s WACC and Effective Tax Rate. 
Many MNEs have greater ability to control and re￾duce their effective tax rates when expanding inter￾national operations. If Genedak-Hogan were able to 
reduce its consolidated effective tax rate from 35% 
to 32%, what would be the impact on its WACC?

Do what you will, the capital is at hazard. All that can be required of a trustee to invest, is, 
that he shall conduct himself faithfully and exercise a sound discretion. He is to observe 
how men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard 
to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the 
probable income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested.
—Prudent Man Rule, Justice Samuel Putnam, 1830.
Funding the 
Multinational Firm
Chapter 13 analyzed why gaining access to global capital markets should or could lower a 
firm’s cost of capital, increase its access to capital, and improve the liquidity of its shares by 
overcoming market segmentation. A firm pursuing this lofty goal, particularly a firm from a 
segmented or emerging market, must first design a financial strategy that will attract inter￾national investors. This involves choosing among alternative paths to access global capital 
markets.
This chapter focuses on firms that wish to globalize their cost and availability of capital, 
many that reside in less liquid, segmented, or emerging markets. Firms resident in large and 
highly industrialized countries already have access to their own domestic, liquid, and unseg￾mented markets. Although they too source equity and debt abroad, it is unlikely to have as 
significant an impact on their cost and availability of capital. In fact, for these firms, sourcing 
funds abroad is often motivated solely by the need to fund large foreign acquisitions rather 
than to fund existing operations.
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 441 02/05/23 4:46 PM442 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
This chapter begins with the design of a financial strategy to source both equity and 
debt globally. It then analyzes the optimal financial structure for a multinational enterprise 
(MNE) and its subsidiaries, one that minimizes its cost of capital. We then explore the alter￾native paths that a firm may follow in raising capital in global markets, and the alternative 
strategies and tactics for funding foreign subsidiaries. The chapter concludes with the mini￾case CEMEX’s Debt Dilemma, which examines the financing crisis experienced by one major 
multinational following an overly aggressive debt-funded acquisition.
14.1 Designing a Strategy to Source Capital Globally
Designing a capital sourcing strategy requires management to agree upon a long-run finan￾cial objective and then choose among the various alternative paths to get there. Exhibit 14.1 
is a visual presentation of alternative paths to the ultimate objective of attaining a global cost 
and availability of capital.
Alternative Paths to Globalize the Cost and Availability of Capital
Normally, the choice of paths and implementation is aided by an early appointment of an 
investment bank as official advisor to the firm. Investment bankers are in touch with poten￾tial foreign investors and their current requirements. They can also help navigate the various 
institutional requirements and barriers that must be satisfied. Their services include advising 
if, when, and where a cross-listing should be initiated. They usually prepare the required pro￾spectus if an equity or debt issue is desired, help price the issue, and maintain an aftermarket 
to prevent the share price from falling below its initial price.

M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 442 02/05/23 4:46 PMCHAPTER 14 Funding the Multinational Firm 443
Most firms raise their initial capital in their own domestic market as illustrated by the 
lower left starting point in Exhibit 14.1. Next, they are tempted to skip all the intermediate 
steps along the pathway to an equity issue in a target market or a euroequity issue in global 
markets. This is the time when a good investment bank advisor will offer a “reality check.” 
Most firms that have only raised capital in their own domestic market are not sufficiently well 
known to attract foreign investors. This was the lesson learned by Novo in Chapter 13—to 
start with a eurobond issue and gradually penetrate the global marketplace—in essence, a 
market penetration strategy.
14.2 Optimal Financial Structure
After many years of debate, finance theorists now agree that there is an optimal financial 
structure for a firm, and practically, they agree on how it is determined. The great debate be￾tween the so-called traditionalists and the Modigliani and Miller school of thought has ended 
in compromise:
When taxes and bankruptcy costs are considered, a firm has an optimal financial structure 
determined by that particular mix of debt and equity that minimizes the firm’s cost of capi￾tal for a given level of business risk.
If the business risk of new projects differs from the risk of existing projects, the optimal mix of 
debt and equity would change to recognize trade-offs between business and financial risks.
Exhibit 14.2 illustrates how the cost of capital varies with the amount of debt employed. 
As the debt ratio, defined as total debt divided by total assets at market values, increases, the 
after-tax weighted average cost of capital (kWACC) decreases because of the heavier weight 
of low-cost debt [kd (1 - t)] compared to high-cost equity (ke). The low cost of debt is partly 
due to the tax deductibility of interest, (1 - t).

M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 443 02/05/23 4:46 PM444 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
Partly offsetting the favorable effect of more debt is an increase in the cost of equity (ke)
because investors perceive greater financial risk. Nevertheless, the weighted average cost of 
capital (kWACC) continues to decline as the debt ratio increases, until financial risk becomes 
so serious that investors and management alike perceive a real danger of insolvency. This re￾sult causes a sharp increase in the cost of new debt and equity, thereby increasing the WACC. 
The low point on the resulting U-shaped cost of capital curve, just below 14% in Exhibit 14.2, 
defines the debt ratio range in which the cost of capital is minimized.
Most theorists believe that the low point is actually a rather broad flat area encompassing 
a wide range of debt ratios (say, 30% to 50% in Exhibit 14.2), where there is little difference 
in the cost of capital. They also generally agree that, at least in major industrial countries, the 
range of the flat area and the location of a particular firm’s debt ratio within that range are 
determined by such variables as (1) the industry in which it competes, (2) volatility of its sales 
and operating income, and (3) the collateral value of its assets.
Optimal Financial Structure and the Multinational
The domestic theory of optimal financial structures needs to be modified by four more vari￾ables in order to accommodate the case of the multinational enterprise. These variables are 
(1) availability of capital, (2) diversification of cash flows, (3) foreign exchange risk, and (4) 
expectations of international portfolio investors.
Availability of Capital. Chapter 13 demonstrated that access to capital in global markets 
allows an MNE to lower its cost of equity and debt compared with most domestic firms. It 
also permits an MNE to maintain its desired debt ratio, even when significant amounts of 
new funds must be raised. In other words, a multinational firm’s marginal cost of capital is 
constant for considerable ranges of its capital budget. This statement is not true for most 
small domestic firms because they do not have access to the national equity or debt markets. 
They must either rely on internally generated funds or borrow for the short and medium 
terms from commercial banks.
Multinational firms domiciled in countries that have illiquid capital markets are in al￾most the same situation as small domestic firms unless they have gained a global cost and 
availability of capital. They must rely on internally generated funds and bank borrowing. If 
they need to raise significant amounts of new funds to finance growth opportunities, they 
may need to borrow more than would be optimal from the viewpoint of minimizing their cost 
of capital. This is equivalent to saying that their marginal cost of capital is increasing at higher 
budget levels.
Diversification of Cash Flows. As explained in Chapter 13, the theoretical possibil￾ity exists that multinational firms are in a better position than domestic firms to support 
higher debt ratios because their cash flows are diversified internationally. The probabil￾ity of a firm’s ability to cover fixed charges under varying conditions in product, finan￾cial, and foreign exchange markets should increase if the variability of its cash flows is 
minimized.
By diversifying cash flows internationally, the MNE might be able to achieve the same 
kind of reduction in cash flow variability as portfolio investors receive from diversifying their 
security holdings internationally. Returns are not perfectly correlated between countries. In 
contrast, a domestic German firm, for example, would not enjoy the benefit of international 
cash flow diversification. Instead, it would need to rely entirely on its own net cash inflow 
from domestic operations. Perceived financial risk for the German firm would be greater 
than for a multinational firm because the variability of its German domestic cash flows could 
not be offset by positive cash flows elsewhere in the world.
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 444 02/05/23 4:46 PMCHAPTER 14 Funding the Multinational Firm 445
As discussed in Chapter  13, the diversification argument has been challenged by em￾pirical research findings that MNEs in the United States actually have lower debt ratios than 
their domestic counterparts. The agency costs of debt were higher for the MNEs, as were 
political risks, foreign exchange risks, and asymmetric information.
Foreign Exchange Risk and the Cost of Debt. When a firm issues foreign currency de￾nominated debt, its effective cost equals the after-tax cost of repaying the principal and inter￾est in terms of the firm’s own currency. This amount includes the nominal cost of principal 
and interest in foreign currency terms, adjusted for any foreign exchange gains or losses.
For example, if a U.S.-based firm borrows 1,500,000 Swiss francs (CHF) for one year 
at 5.00% interest and during the year the Swiss franc appreciates from an initial rate of 
CHF1.5000 = USD1.00 to CHF1.4400 = USD1.00, what is the dollar cost of this debt 
(kd
USD)? The dollar proceeds of the initial borrowing are calculated at the current spot rate of 
CHF1.5000 = USD1.00:
CHF1,500,000
CHF1.5000 = USD1,000,000
At the end of one year, the U.S.-based firm is responsible for repaying the CHF1,500,000 
principal plus 5.00% interest, or a total of CHF1,575,000. This repayment, however, must be 
made at an ending spot rate of :
CHF1,500,000 * 1.05
CHF1.4400 = USD1,093,750
The dollar cost of the loan’s repayment is not the nominal 5.00% paid in Swiss franc interest, 
but 9.375%:
USD1,093,750
USD1,000,000 - 1 = 0.09375 ≈ 9.375%
The dollar cost is higher than expected due to appreciation of the Swiss franc against the 
U.S. dollar. This total home-currency cost is actually the result of the combined percentage 
cost of debt and percent change in the foreign currency’s value. We can find the total cost of 
borrowing Swiss francs by a U.S. dollar-based firm, kd
USD, by multiplying one plus the Swiss 
franc interest expense, kd
CHF, by one plus the percentage change in the CHF to USD exchange 
rate, s:
kd
USD = [(1 + kd
CHF)] * (1 + s)] - 1
where kd
CHF = 5.00% and s = 4.1667%. The percentage change in the value of the Swiss franc 
versus the U.S. dollar, when the home currency is the U.S. dollar, is
S1 - S2
S2
* 100 = CHF 1.500 - CHF 1.4400
CHF 1.4400
* 100 = +4.1667%
The total expense, combining the nominal interest rate and the percentage change in the 
exchange rate, is
kd
USD = [(1 + .0500) * (1 + .041667)] - 1 = .09375 ≈ 9.375%
The total percentage cost of capital is 9.375%, not simply the foreign currency interest pay￾ment of 5%. The after-tax cost of this Swiss franc denominated debt, when the U.S. income 
tax rate is 34%, is
kd
USD(1 - t) = 9.375% * 0.66 = 6.1875%
The firm would report the added 4.1667% cost of this debt in terms of U.S. dollars as a foreign 
exchange transaction loss, and it would be deductible for tax purposes.
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 445 02/05/23 4:46 PM446 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
Expectations of International Portfolio Investors. Chapter 13 highlighted the fact that 
the key to gaining a global cost and availability of capital is attracting and retaining inter￾national portfolio investors. Those investors’ expectations for a firm’s debt ratio and overall 
financial structures are based on global norms that have developed over the past 30 years. 
Because a large proportion of international portfolio investors are based in the most liquid 
and unsegmented capital markets, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, their 
expectations tend to predominate and override individual national norms. Therefore, regard￾less of other factors, if a firm wants to raise capital in global markets, it must adopt global 
norms that are close to the U.S. and UK norms. Debt ratios up to 60% appear to be accept￾able. Higher debt ratios are more difficult to sell to international portfolio investors.
14.3 Raising Equity Globally
We have entirely lost the idea that any undertaking likely to pay, and seen to be likely, can 
perish for want of money.
—Walter Bagehot, Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market, Scribner, Armstrong & Co., New York, 1874.
Once a multinational firm has established its financial strategy and considered its desired and 
target capital structure, it then proceeds to raise capital outside its domestic market—both 
debt and equity—using a variety of capital-raising paths and instruments.
Exhibit 14.3 describes three key critical elements to understanding the issues that any 
firm must confront when seeking to raise equity capital. Although the business press does not 
often make a clear distinction, there is a fundamental distinction between an equity issuance
and an equity listing. A firm seeking to raise equity capital is ultimately in search of an issu￾ance—the IPO or SPO described in Exhibit 14.3. This generates cash proceeds to be used for 
funding and executing the business. But often issuances must be preceded by listings, in which 
the shares are traded on an exchange and, therefore, in a specific country market, gaining 
name recognition and visibility and hopefully preparing the market for an issuance.
That said, an issuance need not be public. A firm, public or private, can place an issue 
with private investors, a private placement. (Note that private placement may refer to either 
equity or debt.) Private placements can take a variety of different forms, and the intent of 
investors may be passive (e.g., Rule 144A investors) or active (e.g., private equity, where the 
investor intends to control and change the firm). What the holder of a private placement does 
not enjoy is an open and liquid market for exchange of the issue.
Publicly traded companies, in addition to raising equity capital, are also in pursuit of 
greater market visibility and reaching ever-larger potential investor audiences. The expecta￾tion is that the growing investor audience will result in higher share prices over time—in￾creasing the returns to owners. Privately held companies are more singular in their objective: 
to raise greater quantities of equity at the lowest possible cost—privately. As discussed in 
Chapter 4, ownership trends in the industrialized markets have tended toward more private 
ownership, while many multinational firms from emerging market countries have shown 
growing interest in going public.
Exhibit 14.4 provides an overview of the four major equity alternatives available to mul￾tinational firms today. A firm wishing to raise equity capital outside of its home market may 
take a public pathway or a private one. The public pathway includes a directed public share 
issue or a euroequity issue. An alternative, and one that has been used with greater frequency 
over the past decade, is a private pathway—private placements, private equity, or a private 
share sale under strategic alliance.

Initial Public Offering (IPO)
A private firm initiates public ownership of the company through an initial public offering
(IPO). Most IPOs begin with the organization of an underwriting and syndication group 
comprised of investment banking service providers. This group then assists the company in 
preparing the regulatory filings and disclosures required, depending on the country and stock 
exchange the firm is using. The firm will, in the months preceding the IPO date, publish a pro￾spectus. The prospectus provides a description of the company’s history, business, operating 
EXHIBIT 14.3 Equity Avenues, Activities, and Attributes
Equity Issuance
■ Initial public offering (IPO): The initial sale of shares to the public of a private company. IPOs raise capital and typically use 
underwriters.
■ Seasoned public offering (SPO): A subsequent sale of additional shares in the publicly traded company, raising additional 
equity capital.
■ Euroequity: The initial sale of shares in two or more markets and countries simultaneously.
■ Directed issue: The sale of shares by a publicly traded company to a specific target investor or market, public or private, 
often in a different country.
Equity Listing
■ Shares of a publicly traded firm are listed for purchase or sale on an exchange. An investment banking firm is typically 
retained to make a market in the shares.
■ Cross-listing is the listing of a company’s shares on an exchange in a different country market. It is intended to expand the 
potential market for the firm’s shares to a larger universe of investors.
■ Depositary receipt (DR): A certificate of ownership in the shares of a company issued by a bank, representing a claim on 
underlying foreign securities. In the United States, they are termed American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), and when sold 
globally, Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs).
Private Placement 
■ The sale of a security (equity or debt) to a private investor. The private investors are typically institutions such as pension 
funds, insurance companies, or high net-worth private entities.
■ Rule 144A private placement sales are sales of securities to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) in the U.S. without SEC 
registration. QIBs are nonbank firms that own and invest in $100 million or more on a discretionary basis.
■ Private equity: Equity investments in firm by large limited partnerships, institutional investors, or wealthy private investors with the 
intention of taking the subject firms private, revitalizing their businesses, and then selling them publicly or privately in 1 to 5 years.

and financing results; associated business, financial, or political risks; and business plan for 
the future, all to aid prospective buyers in their assessment of the firm.
The initial issuance of shares by a company typically represents somewhere between 
15% and 25% of the ownership in the firm (although a number in recent years have been 
as little as 6% to 8%). The company may follow the IPO with additional share sales called 
seasoned offerings or follow-on offerings (FOs) in which more of the firm’s ownership is sold 
in the public market. The total shares or proportion of shares traded in the public market is 
often referred to as the public float or free float. Global Finance in Practice 14.1 details the 
recent IPO of the world’s most profitable company, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company.
Once a firm has gone public, it is open to a considerably higher level of public scrutiny. 
This scrutiny arises from the detailed public disclosures and financial filings it must make 
periodically as required by government security regulators and individual stock exchanges. 
This continuous disclosure is not trivial in either cost or competitive implications. Public 
firm financial disclosures can be seen as divulging a tremendous amount of information that 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 14.1
were lower for oil and gas firms due to uncertainty over the 
future price of oil, the main driver of their profits and mar￾ket valuation but outside management control. Using 
a PE multiple of 18.8 gave Aramco a value of $2.1 trillion 
($111 billion * 18.8 = $2.1 trillion), but the lower forward 
PE yielded only $1.5 trillion.
Dividend Yield. A second valuation method, dividend 
yield, provided a different outlook for the company for one very 
important reason: Saudi Aramco and the Saudi Arabian gov￾ernment had promised in the company’s prospectus to pay an 
annual dividend of $75 billion (yes, billion) each and every year. 
The average dividend yield for the oil and gas majors, the inter￾national oil companies or IOCs, was 5.4% per annum, but the 
average for the major national oil companies (NOCs) was 5.0%.
Assuming that same 5% for Saudi Aramco and a $75 
billion dividend, the company’s value would be estimated to 
be $1.5 trillion ($75 billion , 5% = $1.5 trillion). The prob￾lem was that although the $75 billion appeared to be a very 
large dividend commitment, it was still not large enough to 
constitute a 5% dividend yield for a $2 trillion valuation. That 
would require a dividend of $100 billion. Promising a dividend 
of that size each and every year, with no guarantees on what 
oil prices would do and therefore what corporate cash flows 
Aramco might yield, was likely asking too much.
Consensus Builds. In the last days prior to the IPO, the 
major investment banks and institutional investors across the 
world converged on a value for Saudi Aramco of $1.7 trillion: 
enormous, above the lower 5% dividend yield, but short of 
the $2.0 trillion value MbS sought.
In the end, Saudi Arabia decided to proceed with the IPO, 
but with a reduced offering of 1.5% of the company, not the 
5.0% previously discussed. The market’s valuation of Saudi 
Aramco on the day of the IPO was $1.7 trillion, yielding the 
Kingdom proceeds of just over $26 billion on the 1.5225% of￾fering. (The 1.5% was increased by 15% at the last moment.)
Saudi Aramco’s IPO Valuation
When the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) was 
approaching the date of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019, 
there was substantial debate over what value to attribute to 
the company and its shares. There were a number of risk 
factors that the market was uncertain of. As a state-owned 
enterprise, would it focus on profitability? As the primary cash 
and revenue generator for the entire state—the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia—would it be free to pursue a corporate strat￾egy separate from simply supporting the state? How would 
the recent execution of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
be interpreted by the market? Would the company focus on 
profitability or, as the lead member of Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), pursuing global oil 
influence? These questions and more roiled the debate.
Two different traditional equity valuation methods, price￾to-earnings (PEs) and dividend yield, were looked to as guid￾ance given the confusion, but they provided substantially dif￾ferent values. Aramco’s value was also considered a highly 
politically sensitive matter, as Crown Prince Mohammed bin 
Salman of Saudi Arabia—known worldwide as “MbS”—be￾lieved that Aramco should be valued above $2 trillion. With a 
planned issue of 5% of the company, the Kingdom expected 
to raise $100 billion in the IPO, four times what the largest 
IPO in history, Alibaba, had raised in 2014. Many believed 
that if it did not look like that $2 trillion valuation would be 
met, MbS might cancel the IPO at the very last moment.
Price-to-Earnings. Saudi Aramco’s earnings in 2018 of 
$111 billion made it the most profitable company in the world. 
In that same year, the average PE ratio for the five largest 
publicly traded oil and gas firms (BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, 
RoyalDutchShell, and Total) was 18.8. But those same com￾panies had a forward PE, a PE ratio based on the consen￾sus of their future earnings, of only 13.8. Forward PEs often 
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 448 02/05/23 4:46 PMCHAPTER 14 Funding the Multinational Firm 449
customers, suppliers, partners, and competitors may use in their relationship with the firm. 
Private firms have a distinct competitive advantage in this arena. An added distinction about 
the publicly traded firm’s shares is that they only raise capital for the firm upon issuance. 
Although the daily rise and fall of share prices drive the returns to the owners of those shares, 
that daily price movement does not change the capital of the company.
Euroequity Issue
A euroequity or euroequity issue is an initial public offering on multiple exchanges in mul￾tiple countries at the same time. Almost all euroequity issues are underwritten by interna￾tional syndicates. The term euro in this context does not imply that the issuers or investors 
are located in Europe, nor does it mean the shares are denominated in euros. It is a generic 
term for international securities issues originating and being sold anywhere in the world. The 
euroequity seeks to raise more capital in its issuance by reaching as many different inves￾tors as possible. Two examples of high-profile euroequity issues would be those of British 
Telecommunications and the famous Italian luxury goods producer Gucci.
The largest and most spectacular issues have been made in conjunction with a wave of 
privatizations of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The Thatcher government in the United 
Kingdom created the model when it privatized British Telecom in December 1984. That issue 
was so large that it was necessary and desirable to sell tranches to foreign investors in addi￾tion to the sale to domestic investors. (A tranche is an allocation of shares, typically to un￾derwriters that are expected to sell to investors in their designated geographic markets.) The 
objective is both to raise the funds and to ensure post-issue worldwide liquidity.
Euroequity privatization issues have been particularly popular with international port￾folio investors because most of the firms are very large with excellent credit ratings and prof￾itable quasi-government monopolies at the time of privatization. The British privatization 
model has been so successful that numerous others have followed, like the Deutsche Telecom 
initial public offering of $13 billion in 1996.
State-owned enterprises (SOEs—government-owned firms from emerging markets—
have successfully implemented large-scale privatization programs with these foreign tranches. 
Telefonos de Mexico, the giant Mexican telephone company, completed a $2 billion euro￾equity issue in 1991 and has continued to have an extremely liquid listing on the NYSE. One 
of the largest euroequity offerings by a firm resident in an illiquid market was the 1993 sale of 
$3 billion in shares by YPF Sociedad Annima, Argentina’s state-owned oil company. About 
75% of its shares were placed in tranches outside Argentina, with 46% in the U.S. alone.
Directed Public/Private Issue
A directed public issue or directed private issue is defined as one that is targeted at investors 
in a single country and underwritten in whole or in part by investment institutions from that 
country. The issue may or may not be denominated in the currency of the target market and 
is typically combined with a cross-listing on a stock exchange in the target market. A directed 
issue might be motivated by a need to fund acquisitions or major capital investments in a 
target foreign market. This is an especially important source of equity for firms that reside in 
smaller capital markets and that have outgrown that market.
Nycomed, a small but well-respected Norwegian pharmaceutical firm, was an example of 
this type of motivation for a directed issue combined with cross-listing. The firm’s commer￾cial strategy for growth was to leverage its sophisticated knowledge of certain market niches 
and technologies within the pharmaceutical field by acquiring other promising firms—pri￾marily firms in Europe and the United States—that possessed relevant technologies, person￾nel, or market niches. The acquisitions were paid for partly with cash and partly with shares.

markets, those included in “Rest of World,” that now dominate 
the number of public listings. It is important to note, however, 
that the number of listed companies is not the same as the 
market values of these companies. Market values of publicly 
traded companies are typically described by stock exchange, 
with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) largest, followed by 
NASDAQ (U.S.), Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock 
Exchange, and Euronext.
Global Equity Listings
The number of companies listed on public stock exchanges 
has remained fairly stationary for the last decade. Older mar￾kets like the U.S. and UK peaked in the 1990s. Indian listings 
doubled in the mid-1990s but have remained relatively the 
same for 25 years. Chinese listings have continued to grow 
steadily since 2000. It is the growth in public shares in newer

The company funded its acquisition strategy by selling two directed issues abroad. In 1989 it 
cross-listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and raised $100 million in equity from foreign 
investors. Nycomed followed its LSE listing and issuance with a cross-listing and issuance on 
the NYSE, raising another $75  million from U.S. investors. Global Finance in Practice 14.2

14.4 Depositary Receipts
Depositary receipts (DRs) are negotiable certificates issued by a bank to represent the 
underlying shares of stock that are held in trust at a foreign custodian bank. Global depositary 
receipts (GDRs) refer to certificates traded outside the U.S., and American depositary 
receipts (ADRs) refer to certificates traded in the U.S. and denominated in U.S. dollars. For a 
company that is incorporated outside the U.S. and wants to be listed on a U.S. exchange, the 
primary way of doing so is through an ADR program. For a company incorporated anywhere 
in the world that wants to be listed in any foreign market, this is done via a GDR program.
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 450 02/05/23 4:46 PMCHAPTER 14 Funding the Multinational Firm 451
ADRs are sold, registered, and transferred in the U.S. in the same manner as any share 
of stock, with each ADR representing either a multiple or portion of the underlying foreign 
share. This multiple/portion allows ADRs to carry a price per share appropriate for the U.S. 
market (typically under $20 per share), even if the price of the foreign share is inappropriate 
when converted to U.S. dollars directly. A number of ADRs, like the ADR of Telefonos de 
Mexico (TelMex) of Mexico, have been some of the most active shares on U.S. exchanges for 
many years.
The first ADR program was created for a British company, Selfridges Provincial Stores 
Limited, a famous British retailer, in 1927. Created by J. P. Morgan, the shares were listed on 
the New York Curb Exchange, which in later years was transformed into the American Stock 
Exchange. As with many financial innovations, depositary receipts were created to defeat a 
regulatory restriction. In this case, the British government had prohibited British companies 
from registering their shares on foreign markets without British transfer agents. Depositary 
receipts, in essence, create a synthetic share abroad and therefore do not require actual regis￾tration of shares outside the home country—in the original case, Britain.
ADR Mechanics
Exhibit 14.5 illustrates the issuance process of a DR program, in this case a U.S.-based in￾vestor purchasing shares in a publicly traded Brazilian company—an American depositary 
receipt or ADR program:
1. The U.S. investor instructs a broker to make a purchase of shares in the publicly traded 
Brazilian company.
2. The U.S. broker contacts a local broker in Brazil (either through the broker’s interna￾tional offices or directly), placing the order.
3. The Brazilian broker purchases the desired ordinary shares and delivers them to a custo￾dian bank in Brazil.
4. The U.S. broker converts the U.S. dollars received from the investor into Brazilian reais 
to pay the Brazilian broker for the shares purchased.
5. On the same day that the shares are delivered to the Brazilian custodian bank, the custo￾dian notifies the U.S. depositary bank of their deposit.
6. Upon notification, the U.S. depositary bank issues and delivers DRs for the Brazilian 
company shares to the U.S. broker.
7. The U.S. broker then delivers the DRs to the U.S. investor.
The DRs are now held and tradable like any other common stock in the U.S. Once 
DRs are listed on U.S. exchanges, investors may buy or sell them the same as any equity. 
Exhibit 14.5 also describes the alternative process mechanics of a sale or cancellation of 
ADRs.
Once ADRs are created, they are tradable in the U.S. market like any other U.S. secu￾rity. ADRs can be sold to other U.S. investors by simply transferring them from the existing 
ADR holder (the seller) to another DR holder (the buyer). This is termed intra-market trad￾ing. This transaction would be settled in the same manner as any other U.S. transaction, with 
settlement in U.S. dollars on the third business day after the trade date and typically using 
the depository trust company (DTC). Intra-market trading accounts for nearly 95% of all 
DR trading today.
ADRs can be exchanged for the underlying foreign shares, or vice versa, so arbitrage 
keeps foreign and U.S. prices of any given share the same after adjusting for transfer costs. 
For example, investor demand in one market will cause a price rise there, which will cause an 
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 451 02/05/23 4:46 PM452 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
arbitrage rise in the price on the other market even when investors there are not as bullish 
on the stock. 
 ADRs convey certain technical advantages to U.S. shareholders. Dividends paid by 
a foreign firm are passed to its custodial bank and then to the bank that issued the ADR. 
The issuing bank exchanges the foreign currency dividends for U.S. dollars and sends the 
dollar dividend to the ADR holders. ADRs are in registered form rather than in bearer 
form. Transfer of ownership occurs in the U.S. in accordance with U.S. laws and procedures. 
Normally, trading costs are lower than when buying or selling the underlying shares in their 
home market, and settlement is faster. 
 ADR Program Structures 
 The previous section described the mechanics of issuing a DR (an ADR in this case) on a 
Brazilian company’s shares resulting from the desire of a U.S.-based investor to buy shares 
in a Brazilian company. But DR programs can also be viewed from the perspective of the 
Brazilian company—as part of its financial strategy to reach investors in the United States. 
 ADR programs differ in whether they are sponsored and in their certification level. 
Sponsored ADRs are created at the request of a foreign firm wanting its shares listed or 
traded in the United States. The firm applies to the U.S. SEC and a U.S. bank for registration 
and issuance of ADRs. The foreign firm pays all costs of creating such sponsored ADRs. If 
a foreign firm does not seek to have its shares listed in the United States but if U.S. inves￾tors are interested, a U.S. securities firm may initiate creation of the ADRs—an unsponsored
ADR program. Unsponsored ADRs are still required by the SEC to obtain approval of the

firms whose shares are to be listed. Unsponsored programs represent a relatively small por￾tion of all DR programs.
The second dimension of ADR differentiation is certification level, described in detail in 
Exhibit 14.6. The three general levels of commitment are distinguished by degree of disclo￾sure, listing alternatives, whether they may be used to raise capital (issue new shares), and the 
time typically taken to implement the programs. (SEC Rule 144A programs are described in 
detail later in this chapter.)
■ Level I programs (over-the-counter or pink sheets) are the easiest and fastest programs 
to execute. A Level I program allows the foreign securities to be purchased and held by 
U.S. investors without being registered with the SEC. It is the least costly approach but 
might have a minimal impact on liquidity.
■ Level II applies to firms that want to list existing shares on a U.S. stock exchange. They 
must meet the full registration requirements of the SEC and the rules of the specific ex￾change. This also means reconciling their financial accounts with those used under U.S. 
GAAP, raising the cost considerably.
■ Level III applies to the sale of a new equity issued in the U.S. raising equity capital. It 
requires full registration with the SEC and an elaborate stock prospectus. This is the most 
expensive alternative but is the most fruitful for foreign firms wishing to raise capital in 
the world’s largest capital markets.
DR Markets Today: Who, What, and Where
The rapid growth in emerging markets in recent years has been partly a result of the ability 
of companies from these countries to both list their shares and issue new shares on global 
equity markets. Their desire to access greater pools of affordable capital, as well as the desire 
for many of their owners to monetize existing value, has led to an influx of emerging market 
companies into the DR market.

The Who. The Who of global DR programs today is a mix of major multinationals from 
all over the world, but in recent years participation has shifted back toward industrial coun￾try companies. For example, in 2013 the largest issues came from established multinationals 
like BP, Vodafone, Royal Dutch Shell, and Nestlé but also included Lukoil and Gazprom of 
Russia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing of Taiwan. In the most recent years, there 
has been a growing influx of Chinese- and Indian-based companies. In 2014, the market en￾joyed a boom from primarily Chinese-based issuers, but the IPO surge was short-lived as 
2015 returned to relatively normal levels.
Global Registered Shares (GRSs)
A global registered share (GRS) is a share of equity that is traded across borders and markets 
without conversion, where one share on the home exchange equals one share on the foreign 
exchange. The identical share is listed on different stock exchanges but is listed in the currency 
of each exchange. GRSs can theoretically be traded “with the sun”—following markets as they 
open and close around the globe and around the clock. The shares are traded electronically, 
eliminating the specialized forms and depositaries required by share issuances like DRs.
The differences between GRSs and GDRs can be seen in the following example. Assume 
a German multinational has shares listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and those shares 
are currently trading at €4.00 per share. If the spot rate is $1.20 = €1.00, those same shares 
would be listed on the NYSE at $4.80 per share.
€4.00 * $1.20 = $4.80
This would be a standard GRS. But $4.80 per share is an extremely low share price for 
the NYSE and the U.S. equity market.
If, however, the German firm’s shares were listed in New York as ADRs, they would be 
converted to a value that was strategically priced for the target market—the United States. 
Strategic pricing in the U.S. means having share prices that are generally between $10 and 
$20 per share, a price range long thought to maximize buyer interest and liquidity. The ADR 
would then be constructed so that each ADR represented four shares in the company on the 
home market, or
$4.80 * 4 = $19.20 per share
Does this distinction matter? Clearly, the GRS is much more similar to ordinary shares 
than depositary receipts, and it allows easier comparison and analysis. But if target pricing is 
important in key markets like that of the U.S., then the ADR offers a better opportunity for a 
foreign firm to gain traction in the U.S.
Proponents of GRSs over ADRs make two fundamental arguments, both based on pure 
forces of globalization:
1. Investors and markets alike will continue to grow in their desire for securities, which are 
increasingly identical across markets—taking on the characteristics of commodity—like 
securities, changing only by the currency of denomination of the local exchange.
2. Regulations governing security trading across country markets will continue to converge 
toward a common set of global principles, eliminating the need for securities customized 
for local market attributes or requirements.
Other potential distinctions include the possibility of retaining all voting rights (GRSs 
do, by definition, while some ADRs may not) and the general principle that ADRs are de￾signed for one singular cultural and legal environment—the U.S. At least to date, the GRS 
has not replaced the ADR or GDR.
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 454 02/05/23 4:46 PMCHAPTER 14 Funding the Multinational Firm 455
14.5 Private Placement
Raising equity through private placement is increasingly common across the globe. Publicly 
traded and private firms alike raise private equity capital on occasion. A private placement 
is the sale of a security to a small set of qualified institutional buyers. The investors are tra￾ditionally insurance companies and investment companies. Since the securities are not reg￾istered for sale to the public, investors have typically followed a “buy and hold” policy. In 
the case of debt, terms are often custom designed on a negotiated basis. Private placement 
markets now exist in most countries.
SEC Rule 144A
In 1990, the SEC approved Rule 144A. It permits qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) to 
trade privately placed securities without the previous holding period restrictions and without 
requiring SEC registration. A QIB is an entity (excluding financial institutions, like banks or 
savings and loans) that owns and invests on a discretionary basis $100 million in securities of 
non-affiliates. Banks and savings and loans must meet this test but also must have a minimum 
net worth of $25 million.
The SEC estimates that about 4,000 QIBs exist, mainly investment advisors, investment 
companies, insurance companies, pension funds, and charitable institutions. Subsequently the 
SEC modified its regulations to permit foreign issuers to tap the U.S. private placement mar￾ket through an SEC Rule 144A issue, also without SEC registration. A trading system called 
PORTAL was established to support the distribution of issues and to create a liquid second￾ary market for issues.
Since SEC registration has been identified as the main barrier to foreign firms wishing to 
raise funds in the United States, SEC Rule 144A placements are proving attractive to foreign 
issuers of both equity and debt securities. Atlas Copco, the Swedish multinational engineer￾ing firm, was the first foreign firm to take advantage of SEC Rule 144A. It raised $49 million 
in the United States through an ADR equity placement as part of its larger $214 million euro￾equity issue in 1990. Since then, several billion dollars have been raised each year by foreign 
issuers with private equity placements in the United States.
Private Equity Funds
Private equity funds are usually limited partnerships of institutional and wealthy investors, 
such as college endowment funds, that raise capital in the most liquid capital markets. They 
are best known for buying control of publicly owned firms, taking them private, improving 
management, and then reselling them after several years (the average holding period has 
grown to five to seven years). They are resold in a variety of ways including selling the firms 
to other firms, selling to other private equity funds, or taking them public once again. The 
private equity funds are frequently very large but may also utilize a large amount of debt to 
fund their takeovers. These “alternatives,” as they are called, demand fees of 2% of assets plus 
20% of profits.
Many mature family-owned firms resident in emerging markets are unlikely to qualify 
for a global cost and availability of capital even if they follow the strategy suggested in this 
chapter. Although they might be consistently profitable and growing, they are still too small, 
too invisible to foreign investors, lacking in managerial depth, and unable to fund the up-front 
costs of a globalization strategy. For these firms, private equity funds may be a solution.
Private equity funds differ from traditional venture capital funds. The latter usually oper￾ate mainly in highly developed countries. They typically invest in startup firms with the goal 
of exiting the investment with an initial public offering (IPO) placed in those same highly 
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 455 02/05/23 4:46 PM456 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
liquid markets. Very little venture capital is available in emerging markets, partly because it 
would be difficult to exit with an IPO in an illiquid market. The same exiting problem faces 
the private equity funds, but they appear to have a longer time horizon. They invest in already 
mature and profitable companies. They are content with growing companies through better 
management and mergers with other firms.
Foreign Equity Listing and Issuance
According to the alternative equity pathways in the global market illustrated in Exhibit 14.1, 
a firm needs to choose one or more stock markets on which to cross-list its shares and sell 
new equity. Just where to go depends mainly on the firm’s specific motives and the willing￾ness of the host stock market to accept the firm. By cross-listing and selling its shares on a 
foreign exchange, a firm typically tries to accomplish one or more of the following objectives:
■ Improve the liquidity of its shares and support a liquid secondary market for new equity 
issues in foreign markets
■ Increase its share price by overcoming mis-pricing in a segmented and illiquid home 
capital market
■ Increase the firm’s visibility and acceptance to its customers, suppliers, creditors, and host 
governments
■ Establish a liquid secondary market for shares used to acquire other firms in the host 
market and to compensate local management and employees of foreign subsidiaries
A recent example of this last motivation, to establish a liquid secondary market, is Kosmos 
Energy. Following the company’s IPO in the United States in May 2011 (NYSE: KOS), the 
company listed its shares on the Ghanaian Stock Exchange. Ghana was the country in which 
the oil company had made its major discoveries and generated nearly all of its income.
14.6 Raising Debt Globally
The ability of firms to raise debt globally—outside their home country markets—goes back 
centuries. Most debt obligations carry specific maturities, explicit repayment schedules, and 
defined fixed/floating interest obligations, all factors that make their sale across borders and 
currencies of significantly lower risk to the investor than that seen in equities in the previous 
section.
The international debt markets offer the borrower a broader variety of maturities, repay￾ment structures, and currencies of denomination than those limited options often available 
in their home country. The markets and their many different instruments vary by source of 
funding, pricing structure, maturity, and subordination or linkage to other debt and equity 
instruments.
International Debt Instruments
Exhibit 14.7 provides an overview of the three basic forms of international debt: bank loans
(including syndicated bank loans), euronotes, and international bonds. These three debt pools 
have proven to be a major advancement over the relatively segmented national debt mar￾kets of the past, and they have provided multinational companies and sovereign governments 
alike with a set of choices of markets and instruments previously enjoyed only by the few 
major deep and developed capital markets of the industrial countries.
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 456 02/05/23 4:46 PMCHAPTER 14 Funding the Multinational Firm 457
Unique Characteristics of Eurobond Markets
Although the eurobond market evolved at about the same time as the eurodollar market, 
the two markets exist for different reasons, and each could exist independently of the other. 
The eurobond market owes its existence to several unique factors: the absence of regulatory 
interference, less stringent disclosure practices, favorable tax treatment, and ratings.
Absence of Regulatory Interference. National governments often impose tight controls 
on foreign issuers of securities denominated in the local currency and sold within their national 
boundaries. However, governments in general have less stringent limitations for securities de￾nominated in foreign currencies and sold within their markets to holders of those foreign cur￾rencies. In effect, eurobond sales fall outside the regulatory domain of any single nation.
Less Stringent Disclosure. Disclosure requirements in the eurobond market are much 
less stringent than those of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC for sales 
within the United States. U.S. firms and non-U.S. firms alike often find that the registration 
costs of a eurobond offering are less than those of a domestic issue and that less time is 
needed to bring a new issue to market via SEC registration. However, the SEC has relaxed 
disclosure requirements for certain private placements (Rule 144A), which has improved the 
attractiveness of the U.S. domestic bond and equity markets.
Favorable Tax Treatment. Eurobonds offer tax anonymity and flexibility. Interest paid 
on eurobonds is generally not subject to an income withholding tax. As one might expect, 
eurobond interest is not always reported to tax authorities. Eurobonds are usually issued in 
bearer form, meaning that the name and country of residence of the owner is not on the cer￾tificate. To receive interest, the bearer cuts an interest coupon from the bond and turns it in

GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 14.3
traditional Western bank may extend a loan to a business. It 
is agreed that the bank will receive its principal and interest 
in return regardless of the ultimate profitability of the business 
(the borrower). In fact, the debt is paid off before returns to 
equity occur. Similarly, an individual who deposits money in a 
Western bank will receive an interest earning on their deposit 
regardless of the profitability of the bank and of the bank’s 
associated investments.
Under Sharia law, however, an Islamic bank cannot pay 
interest to depositors. Therefore, the depositors in an Islamic 
bank are, in effect, shareholders (much like credit unions in 
the West), and the returns they receive are a function of the 
profitability of the bank’s investments. Their returns cannot 
be fixed or guaranteed because that would break the prin￾ciple of profit and loss being shared.
Recently, however, a number of Islamic banking institu￾tions have opened in Europe and North America. A Muslim 
now can enter into a sequence of purchases that allows him 
to purchase a home without departing from Islamic principles. 
The buyer selects the property, which is then purchased by 
an Islamic bank. The bank in turn resells the house to the pro￾spective buyer at a higher price. The buyer is allowed to pay 
off the purchase over a series of years. Although the differ￾ence in purchase prices is, by Western thinking, implicit inter￾est, this structure does conform to Sharia law. Unfortunately, 
in both the United States and the United Kingdom, unlike in￾terest, the difference in purchase price is not a tax-deductible 
expense for the homeowner.
Islamic Finance
Muslims, the followers of Islam, now make up roughly one￾fourth of the world’s population. The countries of the world 
that are predominantly Islamic create roughly 10% of global 
GDP and comprise a large share of the emerging market￾place. Islamic law speaks to many dimensions of its prac￾titioners’ individual and organizational behaviors, including 
business. Islamic finance, the specific area of our interest, 
imposes a number of restrictions on Muslims, which have 
a dramatic impact on the funding and structure of Islamic 
businesses.
The Islamic form of finance is as old as the religion of 
Islam itself. The basis for all Islamic finance lies in the prin￾ciples of the Sharia, or Islamic Law, which is taken from the 
Qur’an. Observance of these principles precipitates restric￾tions on business and finance practices as follows:
■ Making money from money is not permissible.
■ Earning interest is prohibited.
■ Profit and loss should be shared.
■ Speculation (gambling) is prohibited.
■ Investments should support only halal activities.
For the conduct of business, the key to understanding the 
Sharia prohibition on earning interest is to understand that 
profitability from traditional Western investments arises from 
the returns associated with carrying risk. For example, a 
at a banking institution listed on the issue as a paying agent. It follows, then, that bearer bond 
status is often tied to tax avoidance.
Ratings. Rating agencies, such as Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s (S&P), provide ratings 
for selected international bonds for a fee. Moody’s rates international bonds at the request 
of the issuer and limits its evaluation to the issuer’s ability to repay the issue in the currency 
of denomination. Based on supporting financial statements and other material obtained from 
the issuer, the rating agency makes a preliminary rating and informs the issuer, who then has 
an opportunity to comment. After Moody’s determines its final rating, the issuer may decide 
not to have the rating published. Consequently, a disproportionately large number of pub￾lished international ratings fall into the highest rating categories.
Purchasers of eurobonds do not generally rely only on bond-rating services or on detailed 
analyses of financial statements. The general reputation of the issuing corporation and its un￾derwriters has been a major factor in obtaining favorable terms. For this reason, larger and 
better-known MNEs, state enterprises, and sovereign governments are able to obtain the low￾est interest rates. Firms whose names are better known to the general public are often believed 
to have an advantage over equally qualified firms whose products are less widely known.
Access to debt capital is obviously impacted by everything from the legal and tax envi￾ronments to basic societal norms. Indeed, even religion plays a part in the use and availability 
of debt capital. Global Finance in Practice 14.3 illustrates one area rarely seen by Westerners, 
Islamic finance.

14.7 Financing Foreign Subsidiaries
Assuming that the multinational enterprise seeks to minimize the cost of capital for a given 
level of business risk and capital budget is the objective for the consolidated enterprise, then 
the financial structure of each subsidiary is relevant only to the extent that it affects this over￾all goal. In other words, an individual subsidiary does not theoretically have an independent 
cost of capital, and therefore its financial structure is not based on the objective of minimizing 
its cost of capital. But if that is the case, what is it based on?
The answer to this question is a complex combination of theory and practice. In theory, 
a foreign subsidiary is a foreign investment and as such carries with it the same risks as any 
cross-border investment. And as we noted, its financial structure is relevant only to the extent 
that it affects, on the margin, the multinational’s consolidated cost of capital. In practice, a 
foreign subsidiary is a business operating in a completely separate economic environment, 
one with its own set of legal, financial, currency, tax, and institutional practices—local norms. 
The financing of each foreign subsidiary may, in the end, be unique.
Internal and External Subsidiary Financing
The foreign subsidiary of a multinational enterprise is funded from sources that are from 
both internal sources and external sources. Internal financing includes all potential sources of 
funds arising from the MNE itself—the parent company, other subsidiaries and affiliates, and 
funds generated over time from the subsidiary itself. External financing is composed of both 
debt, from any source that is not the MNE itself, and equity from potential partners, local or 
global. In addition to this internal/external dimension of financing, traditional financial struc￾turing choices between equity and debt are also important.

EXHIBIT 14.9 External Financing of the Foreign Subsidiary
In general, although a minimum amount of equity capital from the parent company is 
required initially, multinationals often strive to minimize their amount of equity in foreign 
subsidiaries in order to reduce capital risk. As illustrated in Exhibit 14.8, which shows the 
internal financing sources for the foreign subsidiary, equity investment can take the form of 
either cash or kind (real goods such as machinery, equipment, inventory, technology, or trade￾marks, and others). If additional equity is needed over time, the multinational may choose to 
retain earnings in the subsidiary.
While debt is the preferred form of subsidiary financing, access to local host country debt 
is limited in the early stages of a foreign subsidiary’s life. Without a history of proven opera￾tional and debt service capability, the foreign subsidiary may need to acquire its debt from 
the parent company or from unrelated parties with a parental guarantee (after operations 
have been initiated). Once the operational and financial capabilities of the subsidiaries are 
established, it may then enjoy preferred access to debt locally.
External sources of financing available for foreign subsidiaries, as illustrated in Exhibit 
14.9, fall into three categories: (1) debt from the parent’s country, (2) debt from countries 
outside the parent’s country, and (3) local or global equity. Debt acquired from external par￾ties in the parent’s country reflects the lenders’ familiarity with and confidence in the parent 
company itself, although the parent is in this case not providing explicit guarantees for the 
repayment of the debt. Local currency debt is particularly valuable to the foreign subsidiary 
that has substantial local currency cash inflows arising from its business activities. In the case 
of some emerging markets, however, local currency debt is in short supply for all borrowers, 
local or foreign.
Host Country Norms and Debt. Financial structure norms for firms vary widely from 
one country to another but vary less for firms domiciled in the same country. This state￾ment is the conclusion of a long line of empirical studies that have investigated the question 
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 460 02/05/23 4:46 PMCHAPTER 14 Funding the Multinational Firm 461
of what factors drive financial structure. Most of these international studies concluded that 
country-specific environmental variables are key determinants of debt ratios. These variables 
include historical development, taxation, corporate governance, bank influence, a viable cor￾porate bond market, attitude toward risk, government regulation, availability of capital, and 
agency costs, to name a few.
But to what degree should local debt ratio norms be taken into consideration when de￾termining the desired debt ratio for a foreign subsidiary? For definition purposes the debt 
considered here should include only funds borrowed from sources outside the MNE. This 
debt would include local and foreign currency loans as well as eurocurrency loans. The reason 
for this definition is that parent loans to foreign subsidiaries are often regarded as equivalent 
to equity investment by host countries. A parent loan is usually subordinated to other debt 
and does not create the same threat of insolvency as an external loan.
Host country governments would, in the extreme, prefer all inward investment be fi￾nanced with equity. And they would also prefer that all profits generated by the subsidiary be 
reinvested in the country, not returned to the parent company via an intracompany dividend. 
Intracompany dividends are often considered elective payments—a choice not to reinvest in 
the country. Multinationals, however, would in the extreme prefer to fund foreign subsidiaries 
with debt. The resulting debt service obligations, both principal and interest, would serve as 
a contractual structure for remittance of cash flow returns to the multinational parent over 
time while minimizing their own equity capital at risk.
Foreign Exchange Concerns. Although it depends on the nature of the subsidiary’s busi￾ness, foreign exchange risk can be a burden on a startup subsidiary. Debt obligations in a for￾eign currency or intracompany purchases for products and services denominated in a foreign 
currency can place an undue burden of foreign exchange risk management on a startup. If 
the subsidiary has debt service obligations to the parent company, a startup subsidiary would 
prefer to make debt service payments in local currency. Local debt, if accessible, is therefore 
preferred.
Tax Concerns. MNE efforts to minimize tax obligations in high-tax environments (the sub￾ject of the next chapter) has led many firms to maximize the debt obligations of the foreign 
subsidiary—to hopefully leverage the tax deductibility of interest payments. Host country 
governments are well aware of this principal and have long instituted maximum levels of 
debt in subsidiary financial structures (limiting what they will allow as deductible toward tax 
liabilities). Regardless, minimization of tax obligations remains a primary consideration for 
all subsidiary financing.
Subsidiary Financing over Time
The financial structure and financing of any individual subsidiary will, therefore, reflect the 
MNE’s own business, its own structure, and the local norms of the markets in which the sub￾sidiaries are operating. But a foreign subsidiary, like any business, will have changing financ￾ing needs over time. Exhibit 14.10 illustrates how a foreign subsidiary’s financing needs, con￾cerns, and sources change as it passes through three fundamental stages of its business life 
cycle—startup, growth, and maturing.
Startup Stage. As a startup, the business will need sufficient funding to commence and 
sustain operations. Although it may have access to some debt, debt provided by its parent 
company, the subsidiary’s financing is largely equity during this stage. Even with access to 
parent-provided debt, debt is largely minimized to prevent imposing cash flow burdens on 
the startup business. Operational capability will be largely cash-flow based; it does not have 
to be solely profitable on its own as a subsidiary, but it does need to pay its bills.
M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 461 02/05/23 4:46 PM462 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
Growth Stage. As the subsidiary’s business grows, its capital needs may grow rapidly, de￾pending on the nature of its business. A manufacturing business will likely be relatively capi￾tal intensive, and growing sales will require growth in working capital that will in turn require 
financing. For a services business with relatively low capital requirements, growth may not 
require significant new financing. Management will typically increase its use of debt at this 
stage, and as the subsidiary demonstrates increasing cash flow from operations, it may find 
local debt increasingly attractive and available. Although there are clear tax advantages of 
using increasing quantities of debt, host country authorities will be sensitive to excessive use 
of debt (excessive being traditionally defined as debt exceeding one-third of total capital).
Maturing Stage. In the third and final stage of a subsidiary’s life cycle, business growth 
slows, and the need for additional financing slows with it. The subsidiary, however, may change 
the composition of its financial structure as sustained profits allow both retained earnings for 
equity capital and for repatriated earnings to the parent company (representing explicit cash 
flow returns to the parent). The subsidiary’s debt structure may now include a multitude of 
maturities, rate structures, and currency of denomination as it gains access to more and more 
sources of debt in both the local market and global market.
In the end, the multinational enterprise is nothing more than the sum of its parts. Its 
parts are its business units worldwide, and the task of multinational financial management 
involves the structuring, funding, and managing of all capital and cash flows crossing borders. 
Subsidiary financing is a core element of that body.

the subsidiary may use more and more local debt in its financial structure within limits established by local norms.

Summary Points
■ Designing a capital sourcing strategy requires man￾agement to design a long-run financial strategy. The 
firm must then choose among the various alternative 
paths to achieve its goals, including where to cross-list 
its shares, where to issue new equity, and in what form.
■ A multinational firm’s marginal cost of capital is con￾stant for considerable ranges of its capital budget. This 
statement is not true for most small domestic firms.
■ By diversifying cash flows internationally, the MNE 
may be able to achieve the same kind of reduction in 
cash flow variability that portfolio investors receive 
from diversifying their portfolios internationally.
■ When a firm issues foreign currency-denominated 
debt, its effective cost equals the after-tax cost of re￾paying the principal and interest in terms of the firm’s 
own currency. This amount includes the nominal cost 
of principal and interest in foreign currency terms, ad￾justed for any foreign exchange gains or losses.
■ There is a variety of different equity pathways that 
firms may choose between when pursuing global 
sources of equity, including euroequity issues, direct 
foreign issuances, depositary receipt programs, and 
private placements.
■ Depositary receipt programs, either American or 
global, provide an extremely effective way for firms 
from outside the established industrial country mar￾kets to improve the liquidity of their existing shares or 
issue new shares.
■ Private placement is a growing segment of the market, 
allowing firms from emerging markets to raise capital 
in the largest of capital markets with limited disclosure 
and cost.
■ The international debt markets offer the borrower a 
variety of different maturities, repayment structures, 
and currencies of denomination. The markets and 
their many different instruments vary by source of 
funding, pricing structure, maturity, and subordination 
or linkage to other debt and equity instruments.
■ Eurocurrency markets serve two valuable purposes: 
(1) eurocurrency deposits are an efficient and conve￾nient money market device for holding excess corpo￾rate liquidity, and (2) the euro-currency market is a 
major source of short-term bank loans to finance cor￾porate working capital needs, including the financing 
of imports and exports.
■ The financial structure of an MNE’s foreign subsid￾iaries may vary significantly from that of the consoli￾dated firm, often a result of following host country 
norms combined with internal and external-financing 
choices.
Cemex’s Debt Dilemma¹
“The combination of CEMEX and Rinker will create 
value for shareholders as well as customers, particular￾ly in growth regions in the United States. . . . We intend 
to regain our financial flexibility as soon as possible 
and return to our steady state capital structure within 
two years.”
—Lorenzo H. Zambrano, chairman and CEO, CEMEX.
On April 9, 2007, the board of The Rinker Group Ltd. 
(Australia) approved a revised offer of US$15.85 per share 
after CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: CX)—CEMEX—
raised its offer. With the backing of management, CEMEX 
obtained the needed 90% of shareholders’ approval on 
July 10, 2007, to close the acquisition. CEMEX funded the 
acquisition nearly exclusively with short-term debt.
The Rinker Deal
In the months that followed, many analysts debated 
whether CEMEX had overpaid for Rinker. The final 
acquisition price of US$15.85 was high by market stan￾dards and constituted a 54% premium over Rinker’s pre￾acquisition closing price of US$10.30.
Strategic Fit
CEMEX believed the deal made sense because the acqui￾sition expanded its diversity and strength in the aggregates 
and ready-mix concrete components of the concrete value 
chain. It also increased CEMEX’s market share in sever￾al of the key growth markets in the U.S., namely Florida 
and Arizona, as well as added segments in Australia and 
China. The combining of CEMEX and Rinker opera￾tions in the U.S. market would also offer significant cost 
synergies. (CEMEX had expanded its estimate to more 
than US$400 million in potential cost synergies in 2008.)

CEMEX’s Acquisition Process
CEMEX took on US$14 billion in new debt in the third 
quarter of 2007 to finance Rinker. As illustrated in Ex￾hibit B, this increased CEMEX’s Debt-to-EBITDA ratio, 
a metric of indebtedness used by the company’s bankers to 
track the firm’s debt-carrying capacity.
At the time CEMEX first considered making an offer 
for Rinker, in mid-2006, it expected growth in the core 
earnings of its existing and acquired businesses. But even 
as it pursued the acquisition in the fall of 2006 and spring 
of 2007, expectations for the core business were regularly 
As described in Exhibit A, CEMEX defended the Rinker 
deal as meeting all of the company’s corporate objectives 
demanded of all acquisitions.
CEMEX was a seasoned professional when it came to 
financing acquisitions. The company had paid down its net 
debt (debt less cash) from US$10.4 billion to just US$5.1 
billion in the two years leading up to the Rinker purchase. 
The acquisition would be financed entirely with debt and 
would require CEMEX to assume US$1.3 billion of Rink￾er’s existing debt obligations. Lorenzo Zambrano pledged 
to reduce CEMEX’s total net debt to under 2.7 times its 
EBITDA within two years.
EXHIBIT A CEMEX’s Explanation of the Rinker Acquisition
We complement the organic growth of our business with stra￾tegic acquisitions and capital investments. As a leading in￾dustry consolidator, we take a disciplined approach to capital 
allocation. We evaluate potential acquisitions in light of three 
investment criteria:
1. The acquisition should provide a return on our investment 
that is well in excess of our weighted cost of capital.
2. The acquisition should allow us to maintain our financial 
strength and investment-grade credit quality.
3. Factors that we can influence, in particular the application 
of our management and turnaround expertise, should 
principally drive the potential for increasing the acquisi￾tion’s value.
Our recent acquisition of Rinker meets all of these criteria and 
is consistent with our business strategy. First, the acquisition 
will provide a return on our investment that is well in excess 
of our cost of capital. It also is immediately accretive to our 
free cash flow. Second, the acquisition allows us to main￾tain our financial strength and investment-grade credit qual￾ity. The transaction enhances our earnings quality, lowers our 
weighted average cost of capital (WACC) from 7.9% to 6.8%, 
and will yield our target return on capital employed of 10% 
over the medium term. Third, the acquisition leverages our 
management expertise, integration skills, and global opera￾tions network.

M14_EITE5960_16_GE_C14.indd 464 02/05/23 4:46 PMrevised downward. The continuing construction slump 
only worsened. In the summer of 2007, as the Rinker deal 
closed, CEMEX’s earnings continued to slide. The follow￾ing spring of 2008 saw growing anxiousness for the busi￾ness outlook:2 Although CEMEX’s 2008 sales in the U.S. 
had started slowly, the company still expected to close 
2008 with an EBITDA of US$5.6 billion in 2008, 22% 
higher than 2007’s US$4.6 billion.
September 2008 Financial Crisis
What is now commonly called the global financial crisis
exploded in the U.S. in September 2008. On September 
6, 2008, the two government-sponsored mortgage associa￾tions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were put into govern￾ment conservatorship. On September 15, Lehman Brothers 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The next day, September 
16, the U.S. government seized control of American Inter￾national Group (AIG), one of the world’s largest insurers. 
In the months that followed, businesses of all kinds plum￾meted. In December arrangements were made for the U.S. 
government to take over General Motors (GM) to avoid 
its collapse.
CEMEX’s sales began to plummet in the third-quarter 
of 2008. Spain was down 26%, Mexico down 10%, the 
U.S. was estimated down more than 25%. Housing starts 
in the U.S. were now roughly one-fourth what they were 
two years previous. The company now experienced trouble 
refinancing its debt, an integral part of Zambrano’s proven 
acquisition and integration plan:3
He largely eschewed long-term financing from capital 
markets in favor of shorter-term bank loans. These he 
would refinance a year or two following a takeover after 
showing lenders how well the deal was working out. The 
assumption was that debt markets would always be open 
to a business as professionally run as CEMEX.
Now CEMEX is staring at a mountain of $16.4 billion to 
almost $20 billion of debt, depending on the accounting 
principles used, at least twice the company’s stock-market 
value. Facing weak housing sectors in its three core mar￾kets—the U.S., Spain, and Mexico—the company is hard 
put to generate enough cash soon to whittle that debt 
much. Its annual cash flow equals about 17% of its debt, 
below its historic average of 30%.
As sales and earnings declined at CEMEX and every￾where across most markets, banks began freezing up, not 
being willing to extend, roll over, or refinance debt. Banks 
stopped answering the phone, regardless of whether the 
caller was CEMEX, Yahoo, or Walmart. As one treasurer 
noted, “They don’t want to say no to new financing, but 
they can’t say yes.” By December 2008, more than three 
months into the financial crisis, CEMEX was in crisis mode. 
The company began slashing its workforce and spending.
As illustrated in Exhibit C, housing starts continued to 
plummet. One of the most immediate and drastic of the 
impacts of the financial crisis was the fall of the Mexican 
peso and the rise of the U.S. dollar. Given the multitude of 
currencies CEMEX operated in and the varying sources of 
its debt, earnings fell further. In early December the com￾pany announced that it was unwinding its failed currency 
hedging program at a cost of a US$711 million. As noted, 
CEMEX was now facing repayment of US$5.5 billion in 
debt in 2009.
CEMEX and the company’s creditors relied on the 
company’s core earnings—EBITDA—to generate the 
cash flows to service debt. Unfortunately, expectations 
over CEMEX’s future EBITDA were being consistently 
revised downward. At the time that CEMEX had initiated 
its hostile takeover of Rinker, in October 2006, its EBIT￾DA was forecast to hit US$5.071 billion for 2007. In the 
end, actual 2007 results were only US$4.590 billion. But 
it was actual EBITDA for 2008 that would pose the big￾gest problem. Although forecast to hit US$4.600 billion, 
actual 2008 results were only US$3.565 billion. This was 
essentially the same as that for 2005, a full three years be￾fore the acquisition of Rinker. Current forecasts, made in 
October 2008 amid the financial crisis, were now expecting 
earnings to continue to fall.
Credit Quality and Corporate Cash Flow
The Rinker acquisition immediately altered CEMEX’s 
credit profile with its lenders and posed serious challenges 
to the company’s ability to service its debt obligations.
Debt-Carrying Capacity
CEMEX entered 2008 with an investment grade credit 
rating (S&P’s BBB status). But at BBB, the company 
could not suffer a downgrade without being classified as 
speculative grade. Corporate credit ratings are based on 
a variety of factors including industry, product, or service 
characteristics (predominantly the ability to differentiate 
themselves from other competitors and gain pricing pow￾er), cyclicality of business, and debt levels. Unfortunately 
CEMEX was in a highly cyclical industry (construction), 
was producing what many considered a commodity, and 
had recently taken on substantial debt.
One of the most widely used measures of a firm’s ability 
to service debt was the Net-Debt-to-EBITDA ratio. This ra￾2

tio combined the total level of net debt (outstanding interest￾bearing debt less cash) as measured against the core earnings 
of the firm—EBITDA. As is the case with most financial ra￾tios, there is no one correct value, although smaller is better. 
CEMEX officially considered a ratio of 2.5 steady state.
Prior to the Rinker acquisition, CEMEX had closed 
2006 with low levels of debt and a relatively large cash 
balance, establishing a low Net-Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 
1.44 (all values in billions of U.S. dollars):
Net@Debt
EBITDA = Short@Term Debt+Long@Term Debt-Cash
EBITDA
= $1.251+ $6.289- $1.579
$4.137 = 1.44
The key driver was clear—EBITDA. The greater the core 
earnings of the firm, and therefore the core cash flow gen￾erated, the greater the ability to carry and adequately ser￾vice more debt. Banks used this same relationship as the 
basis for estimating the debt-carrying capacity of a firm, the 
amount of debt the business’s cash flows could support. This 
was found by reversing the calculation and solving for debt:
Debt capacity = EBITDA Multiplier * EBITDA
EBITDA (credit) multipliers are highly time and in￾dustry specific. For manufacturing firms in 2006–2007, an 
average EBITDA multiplier of 4.0 was deemed appropri￾ate. CEMEX, however, was in the rapidly declining hous￾ing and construction sector. Many banks now wished to 
limit the multiplier to 2.5 or 3.0.
For CEMEX in 2006, with EBITDA of US$4.137 bil￾lion and assuming a baseline EBITDA multiplier of 4.0, 
the company was deemed to have a debt-carrying capac￾ity of US$16.5 billion. Since this was far above its 2006 
net debt of US$5.961 billion, its credit rating remained 
BBB. But with CEMEX’s acquisition of Rinker in 2007, 
things changed dramatically. CEMEX closed 2007 with an 
EBITDA of US$4.591 billion, better than 2006 but nothing 
close to what had been forecast when the company had ini￾tiated its hostile takeover of Rinker. With US$14 billion of 
new debt, the company closed 2007 with net debt of US$19.1 
billion, above what the banks considered appropriate.
The financial crisis of 2008 sent the housing and con￾struction sectors downward at an ever-increasing rate. 
CEMEX’s earnings plummeted, hindering its ability to 
pay down debt as planned. CEMEX’s current debt covenants 
required the company to keep the Net@Debt@to@EBDITA
ratio below 2.5. Rinker pushed the Net-Debt-to-EBITDA 
ratio well over 2.5, but CEMEX was granted a temporary 
waiver of the covenant by its banks until August 2008. But 
August came and went without significant improvement.

short-term debt to long-term and committed to achiev￾ing a Net@Debt@to@EBITDA ratio of 2.7 or lower by the 
middle of 2009.4
 This added to the complexity of the com￾pany’s cash flow planning for 2009, as it would have re￾quired the company to allocate more of its free cash flow
(operating cash flow - capex) to debt repayment. Few 
believed that 2.7 was achievable.
Now at the end of 2008, two of the three major cred￾it rating agencies—Moody’s and Fitch—downgraded 
CEMEX to speculative grade, with S&P expected to 
soon follow. The lowest investment grade rating is Baa3 
(Moody’s) and BBB@1S&P and Fitch2. The next rat￾ing downward is speculative grade, Ba1 (Moody’s) and 
BB + 1S&P and Fitch2.
Credit rating downgrades had two immediate impacts 
on corporate borrowers: (1) reduced capital availability to 
borrowers, as many lenders either reduced their loan of￾ferings or eliminated them; and 2) increased cost in the 
form of higher interest rates, often accompanied with 
elimination of fixed rate offers. These forces were ampli￾fied when the downgrade was from investment grade to 
speculative grade.
Much of CEMEX’s existing debt had been floating rate 
debt, typically priced in U.S. dollars at six-month LIBOR 
plus a credit spread. The credit spread reflected CEMEX’s 
perceived credit risk and quality. If CEMEX was indeed 
downgraded, the spread could increase, but even with that, 
it might be only 50 basis points (one-half of 1%). One of 
the more fortunate characteristics of the current finan￾cial crisis was that the U.S. Federal Reserve had pumped 
so much money into the system, interest rates collapsed. 
Now, at end of year 2008, six-month LIBOR was trading 
at 2.2165%.
Cash Flow Planning
As anyone facing growing debt obligations knows, the first 
and foremost priority is cash flow: Will the organization 
have the cash flow to service the debt as scheduled? As 
2008 came to a close, a review of CEMEX’s cash flows for 
the current year revealed indications of growing financial 
distress.
In 2008 the company had generated a small net income 
of US$167  million. Exhibit D illustrates the company’s 
cash flows for 2008. Unfortunately, the dominant sources 
of cash and operating cash flow in 2008 were depreciation 
and a reduction in net working capital (receivables and 
inventories less payables). The company still managed 
US$1.727 billion in capital expenditure.5
 It had also paid 
down US$1.040 billion in debt and distributed US$0.476 
billion in dividends to its stockholders. It partially funded

CEMEX separated capex into two categories, maintenance capex (“investments incurred with the purpose of ensuring the company’s 
operational continuity”) and expansion capex. Expansion investments were considered discretionary.

these actions by selling US$0.747 billion in assets and issu￾ing US$0.461 billion in new shares. From end to end, the 
company’s cash balance improved to US$1.156 billion. But 
2009 posed new cash flow challenges.
A Financial Plan for 2009
CEMEX was scheduled to repay US$5.5 billion in debt 
by the end of 2009, US$3 billion of which was due at the 
end of the calendar year in December. If all values in 2008 
were repeated in 2009 (those values shown in Exhibit D but 
debt repayment was US$5.5 billion as scheduled for 2009, 
CEMEX was in serious trouble, as illustrated in Exhibit E).
Elements and Alternatives
CEMEX needed a financial plan for 2009 that would al￾low it to continue to operate and appease its creditors. This 
meant restructuring the cash flows shown in Exhibit E to 
survive the year—to end it with a positive cash balance. 
If that was not possible, it would have to determine what 
amount of debt repayment was not possible in 2009 and 
work diligently with its creditors to refinance that debt—
restructure the obligations so that the amount of repay￾ment due in 2009 was reduced, with the maturity of some 
part of the total obligation maturing in later years. A suc￾cessful refinancing plan would be one that found a balance 
in allowing the company to continue to operate and to 
continue to service its debt obligations—simultaneously.
CEMEX’s first task was to review every cash flow ele￾ment shown in Exhibits D and E, from net income to divi￾dends, to forecast their value and explore how they might 
be managed in 2009 to stay solvent.
Net Income. As illustrated previously core earnings 
(EBITDA) had repeatedly been revised downward for 
the future. Even with drastic cuts in expenses, 2009 was 
not expected to be much better than 2008’s net income of 
US$166 million.
Depreciation. Depreciation reflected scheduled deduc￾tions from previous year investments. Depreciation had 
been rising only gradually over time, so 2009 would not be 
much different. It had averaged US$1.2 billion over recent 
years but had risen to US$1.5 billion in 2008.
Changes in Net Working Capital (NWC). Net 
working capital was not a large component of CEMEX’s 
cash flows. The fall in sales in 2008 had contributed to a 
reduction in NWC and therefore a net cash inflow to the 
firm, but it was not expected to contribute regularly unless 
sales continued to fall.

Capex. There would be no expansionary capex in 2009, 
although anyone with capital would find it a time of plen￾tiful and attractive buying opportunities. Maintenance 
capital expenditures, however, were required to sustain 
the business. Internally, leadership at CEMEX esti￾mated that the company could get by investing between 
US$700 million and US$800 million per year for the next 
year or two.
Asset Sales. Divestment of assets was a common ac￾tivity by most firms as part of their ongoing business ac￾tivities. But the sale of assets to raise cash in times of cash 
shortages meant sacrificing part of the firm’s future to sur￾vive the present.
CEMEX had already divested a number of units, 
selling operations in Hungary and Austria to Austria’s 
Strabag (Europe’s largest firm) for US$480  million 
(€310  million). The transaction was still awaiting ap￾proval by European Union (EU) authorities. In August 
2008, the Venezuelan government had expropriated all 
of CEMEX’s operations in the country. CEMEX had not 
been alone, as both Holcim and Lafarge, two of its largest 
global competitors, had also suffered the same fate. But 
as opposed to CEMEX, they had already agreed upon a 
settlement price with the Venezuelan government. CE￾MEX had argued with Venezuela that its operations were 
worth at least US$1.6 billion, but analysts believed the 
company would do well to receive US$1 billion. In early 
December, CEMEX agreed to sell its Canary Islands op￾erations to Spain’s Cimpor Inversiones for US$226.8 mil￾lion (€162 million). It was also still waiting for final regu￾latory approvals to close the sale.
Additional asset sales in 2009 were possible, but the 
challenge was receiving fair market value for construc￾tion material assets during a global recession. This was the 
worst possible time for selling construction assets. One 
asset on the potential chopping block was the company’s 
Australian operations, the ready-mix business acquired as 
part of the Rinker deal. It had never been the true tar￾get of the acquisition, and its sale might yield US$400 to 
US$500 million.
Dividends and Equity Issuance. CEMEX’s divi￾dend in 2008 absorbed US$476 million in cash flow, down 
from over US$608 million in 2007. (The dividend had been 
cut in the first quarter of the year.) Reducing or eliminat￾ing the dividend was always a possibility, but clearly a very 
unpopular one with shareholders. One alternative in discus￾sion was to replace the cash dividend with an equity share 
dividend, where shareholders would receive some propor￾tional additional shares in the company instead of cash.
New equity issuance was also a possibility. CEMEX had 
consistently issued between US$400 and US$500 million 
in new equity every year, a common practice in firms of its 
size growing rapidly. Most of these issuances had been in 
the form of rights issues, where existing shareholders were 
given the choice of buying new issuances before the public 
market, allowing them to retain their proportional owner￾ship interest if they desired. Like asset sales, this was not 
good timing for new equity issuance. Economic conditions 
were down, construction materials sales were down, and 
CEMEX’s sales and profits were down.
Creditor Interests
Creditors have three basic concerns when working with 
borrowers experiencing difficult times:
1. Keep the loan in performing status. Banks do not want 
to classify an outstanding loan as non-performing
and then proceed, as required by law, to start writing 
down the loan’s value. Whatever the debt covenants 
and repayment requirements, the bank needs to be 
able to classify the loan as performing.
2. Continue to earn a market rate of interest. Banks, like 
all businesses, must earn a risk-adjusted return on 
their business activities. If a borrower’s credit quality 
has declined, meaning they are now considered risk￾ier, interest payments on the loans should be adjusted 
to reflect this as would be the case if the borrower 
went directly to the market now to raise funds.
3. Have a realistic plan for full repayment. Banks need 
to be able to believe in the future business and cash 
flow prospects of the borrower. Has the borrower put 
together a strategy and financial plan that seems rea￾sonable and provides adequate cash flow generating 
potential to repay the debt?
Whatever CEMEX formulated as a financial plan for 
2009, it would have to meet creditors’ needs.
CEMEX needed a plan for 2009. Hard choices would 
have to be made, and if the company did not make them 
soon, the markets—and creditors—might do it for them. 
Regardless of specific actions taken, one was clearly need￾ed immediately—the renegotiation of the US$5.5 billion 
due to mature in 2009. It was time to start talking with the 
bankers.
MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. Why do you think CEMEX overpaid for Rinker? 
What was the result of this overpayment?
2. How had the decline in both CEMEX’s and Rinker’s 
operations’ EBITDAs altered the debt-carrying ca￾pacity of CEMEX?
3. What combination of actions—what plan—would 
you recommend CEMEX undertake to meet the 
company’s debt service obligations for 2009?

Petrobras of Brazil: Estimating Its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras is the national oil company of Brazil. It is publicly traded, but the government of 
Brazil holds the controlling share. It is the largest company in the Southern Hemisphere by market capitalization and the 
largest in all of Latin America. As an oil company, the primary product of its production has a price set on global mar￾kets—the price of oil—and much of its business is conducted in the global currency of oil, the U.S. dollar. The following 
problems examine a variety of different financial institutions’ attempts to estimate the company’s cost of capital.
14.10 JPMorgan. JPMorgan’s Latin American Equity 
Research department produced the following

Multinational companies have many choices as to where they invest, how they structure their 
multinational operations, and how they financially manage their global businesses. Multina￾tional tax management is a key component in all three areas. Business, and specifically capital, 
is more mobile and more digital than ever. As a result, countries “compete” with other coun￾tries to attract corporate investment. A competitive tax code is one important dimension to a 
country’s competitiveness. But to reassert a principle introduced in Chapter 1, each country’s 
tax regime is different.
Tax planning and management for multinational operations is an extremely complex 
but vitally important aspect of international business. To plan effectively, multinational firms 
must understand not only the intricacies of their own operations worldwide but also the dif￾ferent structures and interpretations of tax liabilities across countries. That said, the primary 
objective of multinational tax planning is very clear: to minimize the firm’s worldwide tax 
burden and, to minimize total taxes paid globally.
This objective, however, must not be pursued without full recognition that decision-making 
within the firm must always be based on the economic fundamentals of the firm’s line of busi￾ness and not on convoluted policies undertaken purely for the reduction of tax liability. As 
evident from previous chapters, taxes impact corporate net income and cash flow through 
their influence on foreign investment decisions, financial structure, cost of capital, foreign 
exchange management, and financial control.
This chapter provides an overview of how taxes are applied to multinational firms and 
how those firms manage their global tax liabilities. The first section acquaints the reader with 
the principles and practices of taxation in its various forms across the world. The second 
part examines how a multinational firm manages its global tax liabilities, specifically the 
Over and over again courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging one’s 
affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible. Everybody does so, rich and poor, and all do 
right, for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands: taxes are 
enforced extractions, not voluntary contributions. To demand more in the name of morals 
is mere cant.

U.S.-based multinational. Although our intention is not to make this chapter U.S.-centric, we 
do need to illustrate how fundamentally different U.S. taxation of multinational corporations 
is. The third section explores how countries are now competing among themselves to attract 
global business and investment using taxes. The fourth and final section describes the mul￾titude of U.S. tax law changes that went into effect in 2018. The chapter concludes with the 
mini-case The Google Tax, which explores the controversies surround multinational digital 
service providers and diverting of profits to low-tax countries, a challenge partially solved by 
the recent move by the G7 to support a global minimum tax.
15.1 Tax Principles and Practices
The sections that follow explain the most important aspects of the international tax environ￾ments and specific features that affect MNEs. Before we explain the specifics of multinational 
taxation in practice, however, it is necessary to introduce two fundamental tax principles: 
tax morality and tax neutrality.
Tax Morality
The MNE faces not only a morass of foreign taxes but also an ethical question. In many coun￾tries, taxpayers—corporate or individual—do not voluntarily comply with the tax laws. The 
decision to comply with tax laws (or not) is termed tax morality. Smaller domestic firms and 
individuals are the chief violators. The MNE must decide whether to follow a practice of full 
disclosure to tax authorities or adopt the philosophy of “when in Rome, do as the Romans 
do.” Given the local prominence of most foreign subsidiaries, most MNEs follow the full 
disclosure practice. Some firms, however, believe that their competitive position would be 
eroded if they did not avoid taxes to the same extent as their domestic competitors. There is 
obviously no prescriptive answer to the problem, since business ethics are partly a function of 
cultural heritage and historical development.
A number of global business forces in recent years have combined to increase corporate 
concerns over tax morality. The growth of the digital economy, the increasing value of intel￾lectual property, and the growing aggressiveness of multinational companies to lower their 
global tax liabilities have combined to create a debate as to whether multinationals should be 
more than “compliant.” Advocates of corporate social responsibility (detailed previously in 
Chapter 4) believe MNEs have social or national responsibilities and should be more patriotic 
or socially responsible to “pay their fair share in taxes.” Companies like Google and Apple, 
although fulfilling all legal requirements of tax law, are increasingly criticized for their aggres￾sive tax minimization strategies. The result in some cases is damage to corporate reputations.
Tax Neutrality
When a government decides to levy a tax, it must consider not only the potential revenue 
from the tax and how efficiently it can be collected but also the effect the proposed tax can 
have on private economic behavior. The ideal tax should not only raise revenue efficiently 
but also have as few negative effects on economic behavior as possible. Some theorists argue 
that the ideal tax should be completely neutral in its effect on private decisions and com￾pletely equitable among taxpayers. This is tax neutrality. However, other theorists claim that 
national policy objectives such as balance of payments or investment in developing countries 
should be encouraged through an active tax incentive policy, as opposed to requiring taxes to 
be neutral and equitable. Most tax systems compromise between these two viewpoints.
One way to view neutrality is to require that the burden of taxation on each dollar, euro, 
pound, or yen of profit earned in home-country operations by an MNE be equal to the burden 
Multinational Tax 
Management
M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 475 12/05/23 6:37 PM476 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
of taxation on each currency-equivalent of profit earned by the same firm in its foreign op￾erations. This is called domestic tax neutrality. A second way to view neutrality is to require 
that the tax burden on each foreign subsidiary of the firm be equal to the tax burden on its 
competitors in the same country. This is called foreign tax neutrality. The latter interpretation 
is often supported by MNEs because it focuses more on the competitiveness of the individual 
firm in individual country markets.
Tax neutrality is not to be confused with tax equity. In theory, an equitable tax is one that 
imposes the same total tax burden on all taxpayers who are similarly situated and located in 
the same tax jurisdiction. In the case of foreign investment income, the U.S. Treasury argues 
that since the U.S. uses the nationality principle to claim tax jurisdiction, U.S.-owned foreign 
subsidiaries are in the same tax jurisdiction as U.S. domestic subsidiaries. Therefore, a dollar 
earned in foreign operations should be taxed at the same rate and paid at the same time as a 
dollar earned in domestic operations.
National Tax Environments
Despite the fundamental objectives of national tax authorities, it is widely agreed that taxes 
do affect economic decisions made by MNEs. Tax treaties between nations and differential 
tax structures, rates, and practices all result in a less than level playing field for the MNEs 
competing on world markets. Different countries use different categorizations of income (e.g., 
distributed versus undistributed profits) and different tax rates and have radically different tax 
regimes, all of which drive different global tax management strategies by multinational firms.
Nations structure their tax systems along two basic approaches: the worldwide approach 
or the territorial approach. Both approaches are attempts to determine which firms, foreign 
or domestic by incorporation, or which incomes, foreign or domestic in origin, are subject to 
the taxation of host-country tax authorities.
Worldwide Approach. The worldwide approach, also referred to as the residential ap￾proach, levies taxes on the income earned by firms that are incorporated in the host coun￾try, regardless of where the income was earned (domestically or abroad). An MNE earning 
income both at home and abroad would therefore find its worldwide income taxed by its 
host-country tax authorities.
The U.S. was a longtime user of the worldwide approach, taxing the income earned by 
firms based in the U.S. regardless of whether the income earned by the firm was domestically 
sourced or foreign sourced. Historically, ordinary foreign-sourced income was taxed only as 
remitted to the parent firm. As with all questions of tax, however, numerous conditions and 
exceptions exist. The primary problem is that this does not address the income earned by for￾eign firms operating within the United States. Countries using the worldwide approach then 
apply the principle of territorial taxation to foreign firms within their legal jurisdiction, taxing 
all income earned by foreign firms in their country.
Territorial Approach. The territorial approach, also termed source approach, focuses on the 
income earned by firms within the legal jurisdiction of the host country, not on the country 
of firm incorporation. Countries like Germany, which follow the territorial approach, apply 
taxes equally to foreign or domestic firms on income earned within the country, but in prin￾ciple not on income earned outside the country. The territorial approach, like the worldwide 
approach, results in a major gap in coverage if resident firms earn income outside the country 
but are not taxed by the country in which the profits are earned (operations in a so-called tax 
haven). In this case, tax authorities extend tax coverage to income earned abroad if it is not 
currently covered by foreign tax jurisdictions. Once again, a mix of the two tax approaches is 
necessary for full coverage of income.
M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 476 12/05/23 6:37 PMCHAPTER 15 Multinational Tax Management 477
Most of the countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) currently utilize a territorial tax system. There are only a few countries 
that still use the worldwide approach—Chile, Israel, Korea, and Mexico. The United States, 
as a result of tax law changes in 2017, moved from worldwide toward territorial (more on that 
later). The predominance of territorial systems has grown rapidly, as more than half of these 
same OECD countries used worldwide systems only 10 years ago. In 2009 alone, both Japan 
and the United Kingdom switched from worldwide to territorial systems. And as we will detail 
later in this chapter, the countries continuing to use worldwide taxation are considered to have 
the relatively least competitive tax regimes—for attracting and hosting global business.
Tax Deferral. If the worldwide approach to international taxation were followed to the let￾ter, it would end the tax-deferral privilege for many MNEs. Foreign subsidiaries of MNEs pay 
host-country corporate income taxes, but many parent countries defer claiming additional 
income taxes on that foreign-source income until it is remitted to the parent firm—this is 
called tax deferral. For example, U.S. corporate income taxes on some types of foreign-source 
income of U.S.-owned subsidiaries incorporated abroad are deferred until the earnings are 
remitted to the U.S. parent. However, the ability to defer corporate income taxes is highly 
restricted and has been the subject of many of the tax law changes in the past three decades.
Tax Treaties
A network of bilateral tax treaties, many of which are modeled after one proposed by the 
OECD, provides a means of reducing double taxation. Tax treaties normally define whether 
taxes are to be imposed on income earned in one country by the nationals of another and, if 
so, how. Tax treaties are bilateral, with the two signatories specifying what rates are applicable 
to which types of income between the two countries.
Individual bilateral tax jurisdictions as specified through tax treaties are particularly im￾portant for firms that are primarily exporting to another country rather than doing business 
in that country via a “permanent establishment” (for example, a manufacturing plant). A firm 
that only exports would not want any of its other worldwide income to be taxed by the im￾porting country. Tax treaties define what is a “permanent establishment” and what constitutes 
a limited presence for tax purposes. Tax treaties also typically result in reduced withholding 
tax rates between the two signatory countries.
Controlled Foreign Corporations
One long-standing challenge faced by U.S. tax authorities (and other countries utilizing ter￾ritorial tax regimes) was that U.S. tax liabilities on foreign source income enjoyed deferral 
(postponement) until the profits were remitted to the U.S. The problem was that many multi￾nationals restructured the ownership of their foreign subsidiaries, creating subsidiary holding 
companies in low-tax countries or tax havens. This allowed the profits to be remitted or posi￾tioned in a low-tax environment without those profits being remitted to the U.S.
That rule was amended in 1962 for controlled foreign corporations by the creation of 
special Subpart F income. A controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is any foreign corporation 
in which U.S. shareholders, including corporate parents, own more than 50% of the com￾bined voting power or total value.1 The U.S. parent company therefore “controls” or dictates 
remittance decisions of the foreign subsidiary. The revision was designed to prevent the use 
1
A U.S. shareholder is a U.S. person owning 10% or more of the voting power of a controlled foreign corporation. 
A U.S. person is a citizen or resident of the United States, a domestic partnership, a domestic corporation, or any 
non-foreign trust or estate. The required percentages are based on constructive ownership, under which an indi￾vidual is deemed to own shares registered in the names of other family members, trusts, and so on.
M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 477 12/05/23 6:37 PM478 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
of constructed companies in tax havens as a means of deferring U.S. taxes and to encourage 
greater repatriation of foreign incomes. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 retained the concept of 
Subpart F income but made a number of changes that expanded categories of income subject 
to taxation, reduced exceptions, and raised or lowered thresholds.
Under these definitions, a more-than-50%-owned subsidiary of a U.S. corporation would 
be a controlled foreign corporation (CFC), and the U.S. parent would be taxed on certain 
undistributed income—Subpart F income—of that CFC. Subpart F income, which is subject 
to immediate U.S. taxation even when it is not remitted, is income of a type otherwise eas￾ily shifted offshore to avoid current taxation. It includes (1) passive income received by the 
foreign corporation such as dividends, interest, rents, royalties, net foreign currency gains, 
net commodities gains, and income from the sale of non-income-producing property; (2) in￾come from the insurance of U.S. risks; (3) financial service income; (4) shipping income; (5) 
oil-related income; and (6) certain related-party sales and service income.
Exhibit 15.1 illustrates the mechanics of how a U.S. corporation attempting to use a fi￾nancial subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands (one which has no economic function other 
than to own for tax purposes) would be treated under Subpart F income principles. CFC 
rules vary across countries, including the definition of what constitutes “control.” Where the 
U.S. defines a foreign company having 50% U.S. ownership to be a CFC, others, for example 
Australia, consider a foreign company that is 50% controlled by four or fewer Australian resi￾dents or 40% controlled by a single Australian resident to be a CFC.
Tax Types
Taxes are classified as direct taxes if they are applied directly to income or indirect taxes if 
they are based on some other measurable performance characteristic of the firm.
Direct Taxes. Many governments rely on direct taxes—income taxes, both personal and 
corporate—for their primary sources of revenue. Corporate income tax rates differ widely 
across the globe, as illustrated in Exhibit 15.2, and may take a variety of different forms. Some 
countries, for example, impose different corporate tax rates on distributed income (often

lower) versus undistributed income (often higher) in an attempt to motivate companies to 
distribute greater portions of their income to their owners (who would then pay personal 
income taxes on those earnings).
Statutory income tax rates—the specific legal income tax rates that companies are ex￾pected to pay prior to possible deductions and adjustments—have been declining for more 
than a decade. That decline, however, now seems to have leveled off. Many governments are 
now expanding the use of indirect taxes.
These differences reflect a rapidly changing global tax environment. Corporate income 
taxes have been falling rapidly and widely over the past two decades. On average, the non￾OECD countries have relatively lower rates on average. The highly industrialized world, for 
better or worse, has been reluctant to reduce corporate income tax rates as aggressively as 
many emerging market nations.
Corporate income tax rates, like any burden on the profitability of commercial enterprise, 
have become a competitive element used by many countries to promote inward investment 
from abroad. And if corporate tax rates are indeed an element of competition, as illustrated 
in Exhibit 15.3, the U.S. was clearly losing this competitive battle until the 201792018 tax law 
change. In 2017 the U.S. had the highest corporate tax rate among the 30 OECD countries 
shown. (The U.S. rate of 40% results from state and local taxes added to the 35% statutory 
corporate income tax rate.) With the new U.S. tax rate beginning in 2018 of 21%, it is now one 
of the lowest tax rate countries.
Another form of direct taxes comes in the form of withholding taxes. Passive income
(such as dividends, interest, and royalties) earned by a resident of one country within the tax 
jurisdiction of a second country is normally subject to a withholding tax in the second coun￾try. The reason for the institution of withholding taxes is actually quite simple: governments 
recognize that most international investors will not file a tax return in each country in which 
they earn income. The government, therefore, wishes to ensure that a minimum tax payment 
is received. As the term implies, taxes are withheld by the corporation from the payment 
made to the investor, and those withheld taxes are then turned over to tax authorities. They 
are the subject of most bilateral tax treaties and generally range between 0% and 25%.

Indirect Taxes. Indirect taxes take a variety of different forms and include value-added tax, 
goods and service tax, consumption tax, excise duties, and custom duties.
One type of indirect tax that has achieved great prominence is the value-added tax 
(VAT). The value-added tax is a type of national sales tax collected at each stage of produc￾tion or upon the sale of consumption goods in proportion to the value added during that 
stage. In general, production goods, such as plant and equipment, have not been subject to 
the value-added tax. Certain necessities such as medicines and other health-related expenses, 
education, and religious activities are usually exempt or taxed at lower rates.
The value-added tax has been adopted as the main source of revenue from indirect taxa￾tion by all members of the European Union (EU), most non-EU countries in Europe, a num￾ber of Latin American countries, Canada, and scattered other countries. The U.S. remains one 
of the few countries that does not impose a VAT, although most states do impose sales taxes. 
The use of value-added taxes is currently expanding rapidly.
There are a multitude of other indirect taxes, which vary in importance from country to 
country, including goods and service tax, consumption tax, and a variety of excise taxes.
■ Goods and service tax (GST) is a value-added tax applied to the sales of most goods and 
services. In Australia, for example, GST is levied on transactions in the production process 
but then refunded to all parties in the chain of production other than the final consumer.
■ Consumption taxes are taxes charged to individuals when they spend money on goods 
and services. Like GST, it is a tax imposed at the point in time when money is spent 
rather than earned. Sales taxes in the U.S. are a form of consumption tax. They are usually 
charged as a percentage of the sale price.
■ Excise taxes are taxes levied on individual items—targeted items—and are often charged 
as a set money amount on the individual item. Often referred to as user fees, excise taxes

on gasoline, cigarettes, trucking, and airline travel are quite common internationally. They 
may be charged to generate funds to support the underlying activity such as airport op￾erations or highway maintenance. They are also often charged to act as a deterrent to use 
as taxes imposed on cigarettes and alcohol.
There are many other indirect taxes used internationally, such as financial turnover taxes, 
tax on the purchase or sale of securities, and property and inheritance taxes—taxes imposed 
on the transfer of asset ownership. The primary purpose of these taxes is either a social redis￾tribution of income and wealth, revenue generation, or both. Whereas direct taxes (corporate 
income taxes) have fallen over time to their current record low levels, the same is not the 
case with indirect taxes. Indirect tax obligations appear to be on the rise and are making up 
greater proportions of government revenues globally.
15.2 Multinational Tax Management
The operational goal of the multinational enterprise is the maximization of consolidated 
after-tax income—earnings or earnings per share (EPS). This requires the MNE to minimize 
its effective global tax burden. Since multinational firms, incorporated in a worldwide tax 
country like the United States, are taxed on their worldwide income—and not just their in￾come in-country (territorial taxation)—they will devise and pursue tax structures and strate￾gies to minimize tax payments across all countries in which they operate. This section will 
focus on these tax management strategies and focuses specifically on strategies employed by 
U.S. multinational firms.
The following tax structures and strategies are not illegal, but rather may be considered 
extremely aggressive efforts to reduce tax liabilities—tax avoidance. Whereas illegal activities 
are termed tax evasion, tax avoidance is used to describe extremely aggressive strategies and 
structures used by business to reduce taxes far below what most governments expect. This 
latter category would include the use of offshore tax havens. The question that remains, how￾ever, is whether the MNEs are also pursuing the nonfinancial interests or responsibilities of 
the firm equitably or ethically.
A number of different strategies, structures, and practices are used for tax avoidance. 
Most methods are premised on shifting taxable profits to low tax environments while mini￾mizing taxable income in higher tax jurisdictions. We will focus our discussion on five in￾ternational tax management practices: allocation of debt, foreign tax credits, transfer pricing, 
cross-crediting, and check-the-box.
Allocation of Debt and Earnings Stripping
A multinational firm may allocate debt differently across its various foreign subsidiaries to 
reduce tax liabilities in high tax environments. Units in high tax environments may be as￾signed very high debt obligations in an attempt to maximize the interest deductibility pro￾visions offered in that country. This is termed earnings stripping. This tax tactic is typically 
limited by host government requirements for minimum equity capitalizations or interest de￾ductibility limits—so-called thin capitalization rules.
The U.S. defines thin capitalization as anything above a 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio, with net 
interest exceeding 50% of adjusted taxable income (taxable income plus interest plus depre￾ciation). Interest expenses that exceed 50% paid to a related corporation are not deductible 
toward U.S. taxes. Unfortunately, this rule has also limited the ability of multinationals to use 
debt over equity in many cases unrelated to tax.

Foreign Tax Credits and Deferral
To prevent double taxation of the same income, most countries grant a foreign tax credit for in￾come taxes paid to the host country. Countries differ on how they calculate the foreign tax credit 
and what kinds of limitations they place on the total amount claimed. Normally foreign tax cred￾its are also available for withholding taxes paid to other countries on dividends, royalties, inter￾est, and other income remitted to the parent. The value-added tax and other sales taxes are not 
eligible for a foreign tax credit but are typically deductible from pre-tax income as an expense.
A tax credit is a direct reduction of taxes that would otherwise be due and payable. It differs 
from a deductible expense, which is an expense used to reduce taxable income before the tax 
rate is applied. A $100 tax credit reduces taxes payable by the full $100, whereas a $100 deduct￾ible expense reduces taxable income by $100 and taxes payable by $100 * t, where t is the tax 
rate. Tax credits are more valuable on a dollar-for-dollar basis than are deductible expenses.
If there were no credits for foreign taxes paid, sequential taxation by the host govern￾ment and then by the home government would result in a very high cumulative tax rate. For 
example, assume the wholly owned foreign subsidiary of an MNE earns $10,000 before local 
income taxes and pays a dividend equal to all of its after-tax income. The host-country in￾come tax rate is 30%, and the home country of the parent tax rate is 35%, assuming no with￾holding taxes. Total taxation with and without tax credits is shown in Exhibit 15.4.
If tax credits are not allowed, sequential levying of both a 30% host-country tax and then 
a 35% home-country tax on the income that remains results in an effective 54.5% tax (as a 
percentage of the original before-tax income). Such a high cumulative rate would make many 
MNEs uncompetitive with local firms. The effect of allowing tax credits is to limit total taxation 
on the original before-tax income to no more than the highest single rate among jurisdictions.
In the case depicted in Exhibit 15.4, the effective overall tax rate of 35% with foreign tax 
credits is equivalent to the higher tax rate of the home country (and is the tax rate payable if 
the income had been earned at home—domestically sourced income). The $500 of additional 
home-country tax under the tax credit system in Exhibit 15.4 is the amount needed to bring 
total taxation ($3,000 already paid plus the additional $500) up to but not beyond 35% of the 
original $10,000 of before-tax foreign income.
The problem, however, is that if this company repatriates the profits of its foreign busi￾nesses to the parent company, it owes more taxes. Period. If it leaves those profits in that for￾eign country, it enjoys what is referred to as deferral—it is able to defer incurring additional 
parent-country taxes on the foreign-source income until it does repatriate those earnings. As 
shown in Global Finance in Practice 15.1, this has motivated some countries, like the U.S., to 
periodically provide tax incentives for repatriating profits.

Transfer Pricing
The pricing of goods, services, and technology transferred to a foreign subsidiary from an af￾filiated company—transfer pricing—is the first and foremost method of transferring funds 
out of a foreign subsidiary. These costs enter directly into the cost of goods sold component 
of the subsidiary’s income statement. This is a particularly sensitive problem for MNEs. Even 
purely domestic firms find it difficult to reach agreement on the best method for setting prices 
on transactions between related units. In the multinational case, managers must balance con￾flicting considerations. These include fund positioning and income taxes.
Fund Positioning Effect. A parent firm wishing to transfer funds out of a particular coun￾try can charge higher prices on goods sold to its subsidiary in that country—to the degree that 
government regulations allow. Payments made by the subsidiary for imports from its parent 
or from another foreign subsidiary transfer funds out of the subsidiary. A multinational firm 
can therefore charge a higher transfer price to accumulate funds in the selling country and to 
lower the funds (profits) remaining in the purchasing country subsidiary. The financing of for￾eign subsidiaries may also be altered through transfer pricing and fund repositioning. If the 
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 15.1
requires complex documentation and approvals from the 
government authorities.
Similar issues were faced by several Turkish compa￾nies who established their subsidiaries in Pakistan. Several 
Turkish companies were stopped from repatriating their 
profits to their parent companies by Pakistani authorities. 
The matter is still one of the points of discussion between 
the representatives of the two governments.
Profit repatriation and the policies around the same 
are one of the key aspect of treaties and agreements be￾tween the governments.
Profit Repatriation and Policies
When a foreign investor tries to repatriate their profits—they 
may be subjected to significant delays, controls, and even 
outright political interference. The Nigerian government has 
put significant restrictions of repatriation of dividends to for￾eign investors as a measure to reduce the domestic demand 
for U.S. dollars. In 2022, Nigerian Breweries Plc. had a signifi￾cant foreign ownership proposed a “share-for-cash” scheme 
through which investors can be issued new shares in lieu 
of dividend payments. This scheme was designed to avoid 
the difficulties associated with repatriation of profits which

parent company lowers transfer prices on goods sold to a subsidiary (again to the degree that 
government regulations allow), funds are accumulated in the subsidiary. This is effectively a 
funds transfer from the parent company to the subsidiary.
Income Tax Effect. A major consideration in setting a transfer price is the income tax effect. 
The firm’s global profits can be influenced when transfer prices are set to minimize taxable 
income in a country with a high income tax rate and to maximize taxable income in a country 
with a low income tax rate. A parent wishing to reduce the taxable profits of a subsidiary in 
a high-tax environment may set transfer prices at a higher point to increase the costs of the 
subsidiary, thereby reducing taxable income.
The income tax effect is illustrated in the hypothetical example presented in Exhibit 15.5. 
Aidan Turkey is operating in a relatively high-tax environment, assuming Turkish corporate 
income taxes of 22%. Aidan Ireland is in a significantly lower tax environment, assuming an 
Irish corporate income tax rate of 12.5%, motivating Aidan to charge Aidan Turkey a higher 
transfer price on goods produced in Ireland and sold to Aidan Turkey.
If Aidan Corporation adopts a high-markup policy by “selling” its merchandise at an 
intracompany sales price of €1,700,000, the same €800,000 of pre-tax consolidated income 
is allocated more heavily to low-tax Aidan Ireland and less heavily to high-tax Aidan Turkey. 
(Note that it is Aidan Corporation, the corporate parent, that must adopt a transfer pric￾ing policy that directly alters the profitability of each of the individual subsidiaries, not the

subsidiary itself.) As a consequence, total taxes drop by €29,000 and consolidated net income 
increases by €28,000 to €681,000, all while total sales remain constant.
Aidan would naturally prefer the high-markup policy for sales from the Ireland to 
Turkey. Needless to say, government tax authorities are aware of the potential income dis￾tortion from transfer price manipulation. A variety of regulations exist on the reasonable￾ness of transfer prices, including fees and royalties as well as prices set for merchandise. 
Government taxing authorities obviously have the right to reject transfer prices deemed 
inappropriate.
Ireland’s IRS regulations provide three methods to establish arm’s length prices: compa￾rable uncontrolled prices, resale prices, and cost-plus calculations. All three of these methods 
are recommended for use in member countries by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs 
and in some cases a combination of all three.
Part 35A, Section 835A to Section 835H of the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act contains 
Ireland's newest domestic laws covering transfer prices. Under this authority, the IRS can 
reallocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between related corporations in 
order to prevent tax evasion or to more clearly reflect a proper allocation of income. The bur￾den of proof is on the taxpaying firm to show that the IRS has been arbitrary or unreasonable 
in reallocating income. This “guilty until proved innocent” approach means that MNEs must 
keep good documentation of the logic and costs behind their transfer prices. The “correct 
price” according to the guidelines is the one that reflects an arm’s length price—a sale of the 
same goods or service to a comparable unrelated customer.
Managerial Incentives and Evaluation. When a firm is organized with decentral￾ized profit centers, transfer pricing between centers can disrupt evaluation of managerial 
performance. This problem is not unique to MNEs; it is also a controversial issue in the 
“centralization versus decentralization” debate in domestic circles. In the domestic case, 
however, a modicum of coordination at the corporate level can alleviate some of the distor￾tion that occurs when any profit center suboptimizes its profit for the corporate good. Also, 
in most domestic cases, the company can file a single (for that country) consolidated tax 
return, so the issue of cost allocation between affiliates is not critical from a tax-payment 
point of view.
For the multinational, coordination is often hindered by less-efficient channels of com￾munication, the need to consider the unique variables that influence international pricing, 
and separate taxation. Even with the best of intent, a manager in one country finds it difficult 
to know what is best for the firm as a whole when buying at a negotiated price from related 
companies in another country. If corporate headquarters establish transfer prices and sourc￾ing alternatives, one of the main advantages of a decentralized profit center system disap￾pears: local management loses the incentive to act for its own benefit.
Exhibit 15.5 illustrated a transfer pricing example where an increase in the transfer 
price led to a worldwide income gain: Aidan Corporation’s income rose by €28,000 (from 
€653,000 to €681,000) while Aidan Turkey’s income fell by €234,000 (from €390,000 to 
€156,000), for a net loss of €206,000. Should the managers of the Turkish subsidiary lose 
their bonuses (or their jobs) because of their “subpar” performance? Bonuses are usually 
determined by a company-wide formula based in part on the profitability of individual 
subsidiaries, but in this case, Aidan Turkey “sacrificed” for the greater good of the whole.
Strategic transfer pricing manipulation can create measurement challenges. Transferring 
profit from high-tax Aidan Turkey to low-tax Aidan Corporation in Ireland affects a multi￾tude of cash flows and performance metrics for one or both companies:
M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 486 12/05/23 6:37 PMCHAPTER 15 Multinational Tax Management 487

■ Operating efficiency as measured by the ratio of gross profit to either sales or to total 
assets
■ Income tax payments to individual countries
■ Profitability as measured by the ratio of net income to either sales or capital invested
■ Dividend payout ratio as net income changes

equity
Effect on Joint-Venture Partners. Joint ventures pose a special problem in transfer pricing 
because serving the interest of local stockholders by maximizing local profit may be subopti￾mal from the overall viewpoint of the MNE. Often, the conflicting interests are irreconcilable. 
Indeed, the local joint-venture partner could be viewed as a potential “Trojan horse” if they 
complain to local authorities about the transfer pricing policy.
Cross-Crediting
One of the most valuable management methods available to companies in a worldwide tax 
system like that of Ireland is the ability to cross-credit foreign tax credits with foreign tax 
deficits in the same period. Say an Irish multinational remits profits from two different coun￾tries—one in a high-tax environment (relative to Ireland) and the other in low-tax environ￾ment (relative to Ireland). If the income is from one of the two major “baskets” of foreign 
source income (active or passive), the excess foreign tax credits from one can be cross-cred￾ited against the foreign tax deficits of the other.
Exhibit 15.6 summarizes how our Irish multinational, *Aidan, may manage dividend 
remittances from two of its foreign subsidiaries using cross-crediting. Aidan’s dividend re￾mittances from its two foreign subsidiaries create two different and offsetting tax credit 
positions.
■ Because corporate income tax rates in Turkey (22%) are higher than those in Ireland 
(12.5%), dividends remitted to Irish parent from Aidan Turkey result in excess foreign tax 
credits. Any applicable withholding taxes on dividends between Turkey and Ireland only 
increase the amount of the excess credit.
■ Because corporate income tax rates in Qatar (5.0%) are lower than those in Ireland 
(12.5%), dividends remitted to the Irish parent from Aidan Qatar result in deficit foreign 
tax credits. If Qatar applies withholding taxes to the dividends remittances to Ireland, this 
will reduce the size of the deficit but not eliminate it.
Aidan’s management would like to manage the two dividend remittances in order to 
match the deficits with the credits. The most straightforward method of doing this would be 
to adjust the amount of dividend distributed from each foreign subsidiary so that, after all ap￾plicable income and withholding taxes have been applied, Aidan’s excess foreign tax credits 
from Aidan Turkey exactly match the excess foreign tax deficits from Aidan Qatar. There are 
several other methods of managing the global tax liabilities of Aidan. These include so-called 
repositioning of funds, by which firms strive to structure global operations to record their 
profits in a low-tax environment, as shown in the mini-case on The Google Tax at the end of 
this chapter.
M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 487 12/05/23 6:37 PM488 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
Check-the-Box and Hybrid Entities
The U.S. Treasury’s attempt to stop the repositioning of profits by U.S.-based multination￾als in low-tax jurisdictions took a major step backward in 1997 when Treasury introduced 
what is called check-the-box subsidiary characterization. In an attempt to allow simplifica￾tion of taxation, the U.S. Treasury changed its required filing practices to allow multina￾tional firms to categorize subsidiaries for taxation purposes by simply “checking the box” 
on a single form.
One of the box choices offered, a disregarded entity, allowed the unit to “disappear” for 
tax purposes, as its results would be consolidated with those of its parent company. These 
combined units are termed hybrid entities. In the end, it allowed U.S. multinationals that 
have tiered ownership of offshore units to once again begin repositioning profits in low-tax 
environments and gain essentially permanent deferral for those earnings. In 2007, the U.S. 
Treasury codified this process in what is now referred to as the look-through-rules on this tax 
treatment of disregarded entities.
Tax Havens and International Offshore Financial Centers
Many MNEs have foreign subsidiaries that act as tax havens for corporate funds awaiting 
reinvestment or repatriation. Tax-haven subsidiaries, categorically referred to as international 
offshore financial centers, are partially a result of tax-deferral features on earned foreign in￾come allowed by some of the parent countries. Exhibit 15.7 provides a map of most of the 
world’s major offshore financial centers.

Tax-haven subsidiaries are typically established in a country that can meet the following 
requirements:
■ A low tax on foreign investment or sales income earned by resident corporations and a 
low dividend withholding tax on dividends paid to the parent firm.
■ A stable currency that allows easy conversion of funds into and out of the local currency. 
This requirement can be met by permitting and facilitating the use of eurocurrencies.
■ The facilities to support financial services; for example, good communications, profes￾sional qualified office workers, and reputable banking services.
■ A stable government that encourages the establishment of foreign-owned financial and 
service facilities within its borders.
The typical tax-haven subsidiary owns the common stock of its related operating foreign 
subsidiaries. There might be several tax-haven subsidiaries scattered around the world. The 
tax-haven subsidiary’s equity is typically 100% owned by the parent firm. All transfers of 
funds might go through the tax-haven subsidiaries, including dividends and equity financ￾ing. Thus, the parent country’s tax on foreign-source income, which might normally be paid 
when a dividend is declared by a foreign subsidiary, could continue to be deferred until the 
tax-haven subsidiary itself pays a dividend to the parent firm. This event can be postponed 
indefinitely if foreign operations continue to grow and require new internal financing from 
the tax-haven subsidiary. Thus, MNEs are able to operate a corporate pool of funds for for￾eign operations without having to repatriate foreign earnings through the parent country’s 
tax machine.

For U.S. MNEs, the tax-deferral privilege enjoyed by foreign subsidiaries (it is considered 
a privilege because they do not pay tax on the foreign income until they remit dividends back 
to the parent company) was not originally a tax loophole. On the contrary, it was granted by 
the U.S. government to allow U.S. firms to expand overseas and to place those firms on even 
footing with foreign competitors, which also enjoy similar types of tax deferral and export 
subsidies of one type or another.
Unfortunately, some firms distorted the original intent of tax deferral into tax evasion. 
Transfer prices on goods and services bought from or sold to foreign affiliates were artificially 
rigged to leave all the income from the transaction in the tax-haven subsidiary. This manipula￾tion was accomplished by routing the legal title to the goods or services through the tax-haven 
subsidiary, even though physically the goods or services never entered the tax-haven country. 
One purpose of the U.S. Internal Revenue Act of 1962 was to eliminate the tax advantages of 
these “paper” foreign corporations without destroying the tax-deferral privilege for those for￾eign subsidiaries that were established for business and economic motives rather than tax mo￾tives. A number of tax law changes in the 1990s gave new life to these offshore financial centers.
Basis Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
The increasingly aggressive structures and strategies used by multinational firms all over the 
world to avoid or delay paying taxes has led to a call by the finance ministers of the G20 in 
conjunction with the OECD to create an action plan to stop basis erosion and profit shifting
(BEPS). This is not an effort to stop illegal activity—for most of the repositioning of profits 
and reduction in tax liabilities in total is legal—but to explore new initiatives to change tax 
laws and practices globally to reassert taxing powers.
The debate that has raged in recent years about Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and many 
other multinational companies is that they are generating massive profits around the world 
and often paying few corporate income taxes—anywhere to anyone. All the while many other 
multinationals continue to pay effective tax rates in the high 20s to low 30s (percentage of 
consolidated pre-tax income). If that is indeed the case, it is not a level playing field, and one 
that many traditional manufacturers who cannot move their products and property digitally 
around the globe feel is biased against them.
Corporate Inversion
These expropriations aren’t illegal. But they’re sure immoral.
—Senator Charles E. Grassley, U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, 2002.
In a corporate inversion, a company changes its country of incorporation. The purpose is to 
reduce effective global tax liabilities by reincorporating in a lower-tax jurisdiction, typically a 
country using a territorial tax regime. Although the company’s operations may be completely 
unchanged and its corporate headquarters may remain in the original country of incorpora￾tion, it will now have a new corporate home, and its old country of incorporation will now be 
only one of many countries in which the firm operates foreign subsidiaries.
The typical transaction is one in which a U.S. corporation and its foreign subsidiary in an￾other country, like Bermuda, exchange ownership shares. As a result of the exchange, the U.S. 
company becomes the U.S. subsidiary of a Bermudian corporation. There is no change in the 
control of the corporation, only its place of incorporation. This is colloquially referred to as a 
“naked inversion.” Such inversions enjoyed a short period of popularity in the late 1990s and 
early 2000s (Ingersoll Rand, Tyco, Foster Wheeler, and others successfully reincorporated 
outside the U.S.), but after one particularly tumultuous attempt—that of Stanley Works in 
2002, which was not completed—the U.S. passed the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) of 
2004, which altered the rules governing inversions in two important ways:
M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 490 12/05/23 6:37 PMCHAPTER 15 Multinational Tax Management 491
1. If the new foreign parent corporation is still 80% or more owned and controlled by the 
former parent company’s stockholders, the company would continue to be treated as a 
domestic or U.S. incorporated company. This means that it would continue to be taxed 
on its worldwide income, and its U.S. “subsidiary” would be treated as its effective parent 
company. This is referred to as the 80% rule.
2. If the new foreign parent corporation is still at least 60% controlled by former parent 
company shareholders but less than 80%, the new company is not allowed any tax credits 
on gains (toll taxes) on the legal transfer of assets from the old company to the new. This 
made many naked inversions financially unattractive, even when there was a substantial 
change in ownership structure.
Today there are three basic types of corporate inversions in use: the substantial business 
presence, merger with a larger foreign firm, and merger with a smaller foreign firm.
Substantial Business Presence. Elements of the AJCA addressing corporate inversions 
are specifically structured to stop corporate inversions undertaken purely for tax reduction 
purposes. The act, however, does not hinder inversions when the reincorporation takes place 
in a country in which the company does indeed have a “substantial business presence,” de￾fined as the company having 25% of its assets, income, and employees in the country to which 
it is moving. This will, therefore, rarely include a traditional tax haven.
Merger with a Larger Foreign Firm. The second major form of inversion is when a U.S. 
company is merged with a large foreign firm and the new combined entity is incorporated 
in the foreign country. The added stipulation is that the previous U.S. ownership must have 
a minority position (less than 50% ownership) in the new combined entity. One high-profile 
example of this was the combination of two major deep-water oil drilling firms, Pride (U.S.) 
with Ensco (UK) in 2011.
Merger with a Smaller Foreign Firm. The third form of corporate inversion is when a 
U.S. corporation merges with a smaller foreign firm, often one incorporated in Ireland, the 
UK, or Luxembourg. The control of the newly created company remains with the previous 
U.S. stockholders, so it does not fulfill the 80% rule. However, because the new corporate 
home is still often a low-tax jurisdiction, the ability of the U.S. to impose worldwide tax prin￾ciples to the new firm is limited. Combining Easton (U.S.) and Cooper Industries (Ireland) in 
2012, thereby creating a new Irish corporation, is one such example.
The rapid evolution of corporate inversions for U.S.-based multinationals over the past 
20 years has heightened the awareness of the relatively high U.S. corporate tax rates, includ￾ing its worldwide regime, and corporate concerns over global competitiveness. That more 
inversions are resulting in movements of newly merged incorporations to other major devel￾oped countries like Ireland and not to tax havens like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, or the 
Bahamas has increased tensions over worldwide treaty shopping and political debate over a 
corporate race to the bottom of the corporate tax environment. The merger between Applied 
Materials (U.S.) and Tokyo Electron (Japan) in 2013, in which the two merged and reincor￾porated in the Netherlands, is one such complex example. The debate came to a head in late 
2015 when the U.S. government moved aggressively to halt the $150 billion merger of Pfizer 
(U.S.) and Allergan (Ireland), imposing new rules that made it impossible for Pfizer to be 
considered a foreign company after the merger.
As long as there are taxes there will be tax reduction strategies. The mini-case at the end 
of this chapter examines the famous or infamous Google tax structure employed for many 
years. Global Finance in Practice 15.2 describes yet another aggressive tax strategy, this one 
based on intra-company loans and cash balances.

and Compaq Cayman Holding Corporation (CCHC), a finan￾cial subsidiary in the Cayman Islands used for collecting off￾shore profits from rest of world operations. (CCHC was ac￾quired when HP acquired Compaq Computer in 2001.) Both 
were classified as controlled foreign corporations , or CFCs. 
 For more than a decade HP pursued an aggressive 
“staggered loan program” using these offshore cash bal￾ances. One foreign subsidiary, say CCHC (Cayman Islands), 
would loan HP U.S. billions of dollars in funds for a 45-day 
period. On that loan’s maturity date, BCC (Belgium Center) 
would make a similar loan to HP U.S., the proceeds of which 
were to repay the other loan. As seen here, this resulted in a 
continuous simulated long-term alternating loan of offshore 
profits to HP without paying additional U.S. taxes. As long as 
the two financial subsidiaries and their loan programs were 
held separate and the loans were initiated and repaid before 
the end of the CFC’s quarterly reporting period, they were 
considered conforming by HP’s auditor and U.S. tax authori￾ties. (HP had set the fiscal quarters for the two CFCs to be 
overlapping in order to conform.) During this period the stag￾gered loan program provided nearly all of the debt financing 
required by all of HP’s U.S. operations. 
 HP’s Offshore Cash and Staggered Loan Program 
 The U.S. worldwide corporate tax regime has motivated a 
number of aggressive structures and strategies to avoid pay￾ing additional U.S. taxes on foreign source income. U.S. tax 
law has traditionally allowed deferral of U.S. tax liabilities on 
foreign source income until it is repatriated to the U.S. This 
often resulted in large growing cash balances offshore, as the 
profits of foreign subsidiaries are held offshore. 
 One early strategy utilized by U.S. multinationals was to 
have a company’s own foreign subsidiaries loan the parent 
company—in the U.S.—money. Initially these were extremely 
long maturities with very favorable interest rates. U.S. tax 
authorities concluded that these were, in effect, dividends. 
Section 956 of the U.S. Tax Code expressly prohibited these 
long-term loans being considered loans for tax purposes. 
They were re-designated as dividends, with associated U.S. 
tax liabilities, as if repatriated. 
 Hewlett-Packard Company (U.S.) was one of these U.S. 
multinationals with accumulating cash offshore, cash that 
was badly needed to fund U.S. operations. HP’s cash was 
held in two specific subsidiaries, HP’s Belgium Coordination 
Center (BCC), a clearing bank for all European operations,

15.3 Global Tax Competitiveness
There are three distinct forces changing the global tax environment today for multinational 
firms. The first force is the rapid expansion of the global digital economy, requiring a redefini￾tion of how and where a taxable event occurs. The second force is aggressive actions taken by 
many governments globally to increase their individual tax competitiveness to attract foreign 
investment. Third, and finally, many of these same governments are scrambling to replace or in￾crease their tax takes from the same multinational business taxes affected by the first two forces.
The Digital Economy
Concerns over tax morality have recently become more multinational in context as the digital 
economy has pushed the boundaries of tax laws and tax authorities. Digital commerce has 
challenged the traditional definition of where—in what tax environment—a taxable transac￾tion takes place. A traditional manufacturing activity is physically defined, and where the 
production and value creation process take place is observable. Digital services, however, are 
less easily defined.
Google’s business in Great Britain serves as one example. Google’s primary operations 
in Great Britain are located in Ireland, a low-tax environment, but much of its business is 
made up of customers in England, a relatively higher tax environment. A Google “consul￾tant” will visit potential customers in London and aid in their understanding of Google’s 
services. The customer will then go online, connecting with Google’s operations in Ireland, to 
purchase desired services. The services are purchased from an Irish business, subject to Irish 
taxes. Through this structure Google generated hundreds of millions of dollars in business 
in England while generating few English tax liabilities—much to the chagrin of English tax 
authorities. As a result, many tax authorities are redefining the location of a taxable transac￾tion from the country of the supplier to the country of the buyer. On January 1, 2015, the 
European Union implemented new value-added tax rules for business-to-customer (B2C) 
business services to make services taxable in the country of residence of the customer.
Country Tax Competitiveness
My advice to this committee is straightforward: lower the corporate rate as much as you 
can, make the tax base as broad as you can, and move to a territorial system as quickly as 
you can.
—Mike Duke, Walmart CEO, Testimony to Senate Finance Committee, July 26, 2011.
The global economy today is characterized by mobility and competitiveness. And in an econ￾omy when “healthy” corporate profits may be only 8% or 9% of sales and country corporate 
tax rates vary between 12% and 40% of earnings before tax, “tax shopping” is a very real 
practice. Governments worldwide are very aware that they compete for global investment 
on many grounds—availability of skilled labor, labor cost, infrastructure, regulatory require￾ments, to name a few—and they also know that a competitive tax code can be critically im￾portant. As a result, countries with few exceptions have continued to reduce corporate tax 
rates for more than three decades. Yet differences remain, and as illustrated by Exhibit 15.8, a 
territorial tax regime (e.g., Chile or Mexico) is clearly a burden.
Governments and Tax Sources
Governments do not tax people and companies out of spite—they need the money. Tax rev￾enues are the primary source of revenue and cash flow for governments globally to fund their 
activities. And needless to say, there is never enough to go around.
M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 493 12/05/23 6:37 PM494 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
But different countries generate their tax revenues very differently. For example, the 
United States depends on individual income taxes for a very large part of its tax proceeds, 
while many less-developed countries do not impose personal income taxes (primarily be￾cause of the difficulty of reporting and collection—some countries do not have an effective 
census of their people).
Exhibit 15.9 provides a comparison of the U.S. and the average sources of tax revenue 
for the OECD countries. Whereas the U.S. depends on individual taxes for 37.7% of its tax 
revenues, the OECD averages only 24.5% and depends heavily on consumption taxes (VAT) 
for 32.8% of tax revenues. In both cases, however, corporate taxes—the focus of this chap￾ter—surprisingly serve as only a minor source of tax revenue for both entities. Global tax 
analysts and authorities, however, all agree that in the years ahead, most of the world will 
move toward increased use of indirect taxes, like consumption taxes.
15.4 U.S. Tax Law Change in 2017–2018
Highlights include ... Fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational entities, includ￾ing a shift from the current system of worldwide taxation with deferral to a hybrid territorial 
system, featuring a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign 
income, a minimum tax on low-taxed foreign earnings, and new measures to deter base ero￾sion and promote U.S. production.

On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, became 
law in the United States. The act constituted the most significant change in U.S. corporate tax￾ation since 1986. The changes impact any company subject to U.S. taxation, including foreign 
companies operating in the U.S. as well as U.S.-based multinationals operating worldwide. 
The changes moved the U.S. toward a territorial taxation country.
Although the changes in U.S. tax laws went into effect on January 1, 2018, it will take a 
number of years to really see the total impact of these changes on U.S. multinational enter￾prises. By all indications, the impacts will be seismic in scope.
U.S. Taxation of Corporate Income
The act of 2017 has a multitude of provisions, but the following are likely of most significance 
to all U.S. companies.
■ Corporate Income Tax Rate. The U.S. corporate income tax rate is reduced to 21%. On 
an effective basis, including state and local tax averages in the U.S., to 25.8% (2018) from 
38.9% (years previous). This 25.8% effective rate is the most relevant when comparing to 
tax liabilities in other countries.
■ Corporate Interest Deductibility. The new tax structure limits the net interest deduction 
toward tax liabilities to 30% of EBITDA through the year 2022.2 After 2022, it reverts to 
30% of EBIT. This means that more heavily indebted companies may lose a portion of 
their interest tax deductions.
■ Transition Tax. U.S. multinationals that have unrepatriated profits in cash or marketable 
securities sitting outside the United States may repatriate those profits at a gross tax rate 
of 15.5% in the 2018 tax year. If those profits have been invested in non-cash assets, they 
will be deemed remitted at a tax rate of 8%.3 This tax is based on deemed repatriation, 
meaning that regardless of whether the actual profits are remitted to the U.S. parent com￾pany, U.S. taxes are due on those past-year foreign profits.

This applies to companies operating in the U.S., whether U.S.-based or U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations, 
above $25 million in gross receipts (gross revenue) as measured over a three-year period. The provision does allow 
carry-forward credits for current year exclusions of net interest deductions.
3
This tax liability on previous year unremitted earnings may be paid over an eight-year period, with 8% of the tax 
paid in each of the first five years, 15% in the sixth year, 20% in the seventh year, and 25% in the eighth year.
M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 495 12/05/23 6:37 PM496 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
■ Full Depreciation. For the 2018–2022 period, the new tax code allows companies to de￾duct the entire cost of equipment purchases from their taxable income. This means that 
instead of spreading out the depreciation on a capital investment for tax purposes over 
a multiyear period (e.g., three years), the company may deduct the entire cost in the cur￾rent period. This, however, applies only to tax liabilities (tax accounting) and does not 
affect reported taxes and earnings (financial accounting).
Taxation of Foreign Source Income
The taxation of foreign subsidiary earnings that has for many years been deferred until re￾patriated is now changed to what is now described as a participation exemption system. An 
additional set of new provisions are aimed at anti-basis erosion.
■ Deduction for Dividends Received (DDR). All dividends declared by the foreign sub￾sidiaries of U.S. companies to their U.S. parent companies will receive a 100% dividend 
deduction—the so-called Deduction for Dividends Received (DDR).4 This dividend de￾duction is what is meant by the phrase “participation exemption.” This means that for￾eign source earnings declared as dividends to the U.S. parent will not be taxed beyond 
those taxes paid in their host foreign country. No tax credits or deficits are created from 
this remitted income. This is the provision that has led many to describe the U.S. as mov￾ing toward a more territorial tax regime.
■ Undeclared Foreign Earnings. Those earnings in foreign subsidiaries that are not de￾clared as dividends to their U.S. parents in the period in which they are earned will be 
taxed as deemed dividends in the current period. Their current U.S. tax liabilities will be 
based on a gross-up procedure similar to that used previously, where taxes deemed paid 
in the host country plus any additional withholding taxes are credited against the new 
lower theoretical U.S. tax statutory rate of 21%. Given that the global average effective 
tax rate is under 23%, this means that in effect little additional U.S. tax will be due.
■ Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII). Companies operating in the U.S. that de￾rive income from the sale of property (including licenses, leases, patents, etc.) to foreign 
persons for use outside the U.S. or for services performed outside the U.S. are generating 
FDII. Although complex, the basic tax rate applicable to FDII is 10.5% of the aggregate 
adjusted basis of the subject U.S. assets.
■ Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). A newly created category of foreign 
income, GILTI effectively sets a minimum current tax on current foreign income earned 
by a U.S. corporation operating anywhere in the world. Specifically targeting U.S. foreign 
subsidiaries subject to Sub-Part F income, hybrid entities, or subsidiaries just operating in 
extremely low-tax environments, GILTI establishes a minimum tax rate on them.5
The tax liability is based on the “net deemed tangible income return” of the foreign unit. 
In principle, what it means is that any income by the unit that exceeds a 10% rate of return 
on the tangible assets of the business is subject to an additional minimum tax.6 This means 
that income earned by intangible assets like intellectual property and patents that is held 
4
This applied to all foreign entities in which a U.S. company owns a deemed 10% interest or more. Although the 
new tax law highlights this 10% interest rule repeatedly, the vast majority of foreign affiliates of U.S.-based compa￾nies are more than 90% owned or are wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.
5
This is also referred to as a base erosion minimum tax or base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT).
6
The tangible assets of the foreign business for U.S. tax purposes have their own acronym, QBAI, or qualified busi￾ness asset investment.
M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 496 12/05/23 6:37 PMCHAPTER 15 Multinational Tax Management 497
by these foreign businesses would become fully taxable. Since these business units typically 
have few tangible assets, any income above 10% rate of return on these small tangible asset 
bases (likely nearly the whole of the returns of the unit) is currently taxable in the U.S. under 
GILTI.
The effective tax rate is intricate. Starting with the corporate income tax rate of 21% 
and assuming most of this income would also be classified as FDII, the effective tax rate on 
GILTI income would be 10.5%. Since tax credits on GILTI income are limited to 80% of any 
taxes actually paid by the business to host country authorities, the effective tax rate on GILTI 
income rises to 13.125%. (Yeah, we know.)
As we noted previously, it is far too early to see how these many complex U.S. tax law 
changes will alter multinational financial management practices. The changes are clearly tar￾geted at ending the practice of holding foreign profits offshore, shifting intellectual prop￾erty (intangible assets) ownership to low-tax environments, and avoiding taxation of offshore 
profits in general through hybrid entities. Time will tell to what degree those goals will be 
achieved.
Summary Points
■ Nations structure their tax systems along one of two 
basic approaches: the worldwide approach or the ter￾ritorial approach. Both approaches are attempts to 
determine which firms and which incomes, foreign or 
domestic by incorporation and origin, are subject to 
the taxation of host-country tax authorities.
■ Tax treaties normally define whether taxes are to be 
imposed on income earned in one country by the na￾tionals of another and, if so, how. Tax treaties are bilat￾eral, with the two signatories specifying what rates are 
applicable to which types of income between the two 
countries.
■ Transfer pricing is the pricing of goods, services, and 
technology between related companies. High or low 
transfer prices have an effect on income taxes, funds 
positioning, managerial incentives and evaluation, and 
joint-venture partners.
■ The U.S. differentiates foreign source income from 
domestic source income. Each is taxed separately, and 
tax deficits/credits in one category may not be used 
against deficits/credits in the other category.
■ If a U.S.-based MNE receives income from a foreign 
country that imposes higher corporate income taxes 
than does the United States, total creditable taxes will 
exceed U.S. taxes on that foreign income, resulting in 
excess foreign tax credits.
■ MNEs have foreign subsidiaries that act as tax havens 
for corporate funds awaiting reinvestment or repa￾triation. Tax havens are typically located in countries 
that have a low corporate tax rate, a stable currency, 
facilities to support financial services, and a stable 
government.
■ Many U.S.-based companies have used corporate in￾versions in an effort to reduce their effective tax rates 
by reincorporating offshore in lower tax environments. 
An alternative to a corporate inversion is acquiring a 
firm incorporated within one of these low-tax environ￾ments and then adopting its incorporation for the new 
combined company.
■ Governments today compete globally for the business 
and investment of multinational companies using dif￾ferent tax structures and strategies.
■ Three forces are driving changes in corporate tax rates 
globally: (1) the rapid expansion of the digital econ￾omy; (2) actions taken by many governments glob￾ally to increase their individual tax competitiveness 
to attract foreign investment; and (3) the scramble by 
many of these same governments to increase their tax 
takes from the same multinational business taxes af￾fected by the first two forces.
■ The tax law changes enacted by the U.S. at the end 
of 2017 will have a dramatic impact on the multina￾tional tax management strategies and structures for 
U.S.-based companies. Although it is too early to tell 
in much depth, it appears the long period in which U.S. 
multinationals could avoid paying U.S. taxes on large 
quantities of foreign profits left outside the U.S. are 
over.

MINI-CASE 
The Google Tax7
“It’s called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic. I’m not 
confused about this. We pay lots of taxes; we pay them in 
the legally prescribed ways,” he said. “I am very proud of 
the structure that we set up. We did it based on the incen￾tives that the governments offered us to operate.”
—Eric Schmidt, chairman, Google, 2012.
Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Inc., a U.S.-based mul￾tinational company, was the dominant Internet search 
engine. Known for encouraging all employees to “Do 
no evil” in the company code of conduct, it has been the 
subject of intense scrutiny over its global tax strategy for 
more than a decade. Google’s ability to structure its global 
operations and reported profits to position them (others 
describe it as “reposition” or “divert” or “avoid”) in low￾tax environments was well known and in many circles not 
appreciated. But as Google’s Chairman Schmidt noted at 
the time, the company was simply following the law and 
tax requirements laid out by various national authorities. 
This practice is known as “legal avoidance.”8
But government tax authorities are not willing to stand 
by and allow Google and others like it, including Apple and 
Diageo, to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of sales 
and profits in some countries, tax-free. They are moving 
to change both how taxes are calculated by residence and 
eliminate the multitude of loopholes and structures that 
the many different national tax authorities have inadver￾tently created through national focus and lack of interna￾tional cooperation. They are in search of a “Google tax.”
Digital Basics
While the digital economy does not create Base Erosion 
and Profit Shifting (BEPS) issues, it “exacerbates the ex￾isting ones.” Digital goods are highly mobile or intangible, 
physical presence of a company in the market country is 
often not needed in the digital sector, rendering it substan￾tially different from traditional brick-and-mortar busi￾nesses. New digital business models (subscription, access 
or advertisement models) and new technologies such 
as robotics or 3D printing are not confined by national 
boundaries and can easily escape their tax liabilities by 
channeling their royalty payments towards a tax haven.
—“Tax Challenges in the Digital Economy,” Study for the
Taxe 2 Committee, European Parliament, June 2016.
One way to understand the tax problem governments face 
is to explore two elements of any digitally based business—
its intellectual property and how it delivers its services. In￾tellectual property can be sold and licensed. But that sale 
and license can be to different incorporated subsidiaries 
of the same company. And at what price or at what roy￾alty rate is this intellectual property sold or licensed? In 
Google’s case, at very high prices and very high rates.
The second element is how and where the service is 
provided and delivered. Google’s business in Great Britain 
serves as an example of this debate, as it has been the sub￾ject of much discourse.9 Google’s primary operations in 
Great Britain are located in Ireland (Google Ireland, Ltd). 
But most of Google’s customers are in England. A Google 
consultant will visit potential customers in London and 
aid in their understanding of Google’s services. Google 
describes these employees as “marketing leaders” and not 
salespeople. The customer will then go online, connecting 
with Google’s operations in Ireland, to purchase desired 
services. The services are purchased from an Irish business, 
subject to Irish taxes. Through this digital delivery struc￾ture Google generated hundreds of millions of dollars in 
business in England while generating few English tax li￾abilities—much to the chagrin of English tax authorities.10
To avoid UK corporation tax, Google relies on the deep￾ly unconvincing argument that its sales to UK clients 
take place in Ireland, despite clear evidence that the vast 
majority of sales activity takes place in the UK.
—“Tax Avoidance–Google,” House of Commons 
Committee of Public Accounts, June 10, 2013, p. 3.
In hearings held in the House of Commons in 2013, Matt 
Brittin, Google’s vice president for Northern and Central 
Europe, explained that Google’s employees in England 
were not salespeople or conducting sales activities: “No￾body (in the UK) is selling.” At this time, Google UK, Ltd 
employed 1,300 people in London, of whom 720 were pro￾viding marketing services, not sales.11

11Ireland is not the only regional sales-tax structure used by Google. In south Asia, Google uses Singapore and its tax regime and series 
of bilateral tax treaties in the same way it uses Ireland. For example, Google has significant sales of digital services in Indonesia, but 
only has a representative office in-country, booking all sales in Singapore.

Exhibit A is one illustration of this potential digital 
distortion between revenues and likely customers. This 
analysis compares where Google’s sales are booked in Eu￾rope versus the number of Internet users in those same 
countries. This same research study presented similar re￾sults for how Facebook conducts its business in Europe, 
also booking all sales in Ireland.
Double Irish Dutch Sandwich
Google’s critical offshore tax strategy, the Double Irish 
Dutch Sandwich, is based on using two different Irish sub￾sidiaries to execute ownership and sales, as illustrated in 
Exhibit B. All of the ownership of its intellectual property 
is assigned to one Irish subsidiary, while all of its European 
sales are assigned to another Irish subsidiary. Both enjoy 
Ireland’s lower corporate income tax rate, lower than rates 
in other European countries like the United Kingdom or 
France. Google’s Irish subsidiaries also benefit from a 
quirk in Irish tax law that stipulates that companies con￾trolled from a foreign tax environment, including from a 
tax haven like Bermuda, only pay tax in that foreign coun￾try, not Ireland..
Key to Google’s tax structure is the subject of 
permanent establishment (PE). Tax rules allow firms such 
as Google to fix a tax base in a low-tax country like Ireland 
while generating lots of business in a country where tax 
rates are higher, like the United Kingdom. Companies in 
principle are taxed not on “where they do business” but 
on “where they finalize their business deals with custom￾ers”—the country or jurisdiction where the final contract 
is signed. In the case of Google, that means most sales 
throughout the European Union are finalized in Ireland, 
where the corporate income tax rate is only 12.5%. If 
Google’s employees in the United Kingdom were actually 
conducting sales activities, UK offices would have been in￾terpreted under tax law as a permanent establishment. It 
is estimated that 75% of the top 50 U.S. software, Internet, 
and computer hardware companies use similar PE struc￾tures that help them avoid taxes.
In 2015 a new twist on the use of permanent establish￾ment designations (or lack thereof) was unveiled in the 
multinational tax reporting of Pfizer, the pharmaceutical 
giant. U.S. tax rules say companies must include the poten￾tial U.S. tax cost of foreign earnings in their consolidated 
earnings, but most multinationals avoid this by designating 
the foreign earnings as “permanently” or indefinitely re￾invested overseas, gaining deferral on the taxes and post￾poning recognizing additional tax obligations.
Companies that can’t or don’t declare their offshore 
profits to be permanently or indefinitely reinvested abroad 
record a deferred tax expense. They appear to be paying 
higher taxes now because the effective tax rate includes 
both current-year and deferred taxes. But the deferred 
taxes are just that—not yet paid. Pfizer reported that in 
2014 it had a 25.5% global tax rate. If it had reported earn￾ings the same way as most U.S. multinationals and not 
included deferred tax expense, its actual global tax rate 
would have been 7.5%.

The Google Tax
While some have raised concerns about where Google 
pays taxes, Google’s overall global tax rate has been over 
23 percent for the past 10 years, in line with the 23.7 per￾cent average statutory rate across the member countries 
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD).
—Karan Bhatia, vice president, Government Affairs & 
Public Policy, Google, blogpost, June 27, 2019.
Frustration has been growing with tax authorities all over 
the world with Google and other digitally based busi￾nesses like it for years.12 That frustration has resulted in a 
number of new tax laws focusing on eliminating or under￾mining the permanent establishment principle, allowing 
tax authorities to tax companies on the basis of whether 
it appears they are intentionally repositioning or diverting 
profits. Australia passed one such structure, the Multina￾tional Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL), the United King￾dom another, the diverted profits tax (DPT). Both have 
been called the “Google tax.”
In 2015 pressure mounted to such a degree that 
Ireland revoked the ability of companies to execute the 
Double-Irish. Although companies would have till 2020 
to unwind their structures, the famed Double-Irish was 
bound for the scrap heap. Google itself announced in an 
Irish filing on New Year’s Even 2019 that 2019 would be 
the last year it used the tax structure.
There has not, however, been international consen￾sus on the best way to move forward on the taxation of 
digital services. In 2019 President Emmanuel Macron of 
France signed into law France’s own digital services tax 
(DST), much to the displeasure of the United States. The 
DST imposed a 3% levy on gross revenues generated from 
providing two types of digital services “in France,” digital 
interface services and targeted advertising services. The 
U.S. opened a Section  301 investigation that such a law 
was targeting U.S. digital services providers, and in July 
2020 imposed retaliatory tariffs.13 Those tariffs, scheduled 
to go into effect in January 2021 were suspended under the 
Biden administration.14

M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 500 12/05/23 6:37 PMBut eliminating that one structure did not solve the 
fundamental problem of profit positioning globally. As 
long as there are differences in corporate taxation across 
countries, there will be multinational companies attempt￾ing to devise schemes or structures—legally—to take 
advantage of those differences. One of the most promis￾ing developments was the G7 agreement in June 2021 to 
pursue the implementation of a global minimum tax rate 
of 15%. (Ireland grudgingly supported it in the end.) Nar￾rowing differences in corporate tax rates to something 
along the lines of 15% to 30% would help reduce profit 
and tax distortions greatly.
But this solution solves only one of the principle prob￾lems, strategies to reposition profits. It does not solve the 
problem with where the taxes are paid in digital commerce. 
Google has repeatedly noted that it supports changes to 
international tax rules so that digital transaction are paid 
where the products are consumed, not produced. 
Many tax authorities are redefining the location of a 
taxable transaction from the country of the supplier to the 
country of the buyer. This may prove to be the most likely 
(but contentious) path to a solution on a global basis.
MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. What makes taxation of digital commerce so differ￾ent and complicated?
2. Why has it been legal for companies like Apple and 
Google to structure their global operations to posi￾tion where profits are recorded for tax purposes?
3. Many tax analysts have always considered the 
Double Irish Dutch Sandwich the result of a series of 
very special circumstances. Why is that?
4. What is the most likely future direction of digital 
business taxation?
CHAPTER 15 Multinational Tax Management 501
EXHIBIT C Apple’s No Different
Although Apple produces products and not just services like Google, its global value chain and tax strategy are very 
similar.
■ Approximately 99% of Apple’s R&D is conducted in Cupertino, California, where it has its corporate headquarters.
■ All microprocesessor used in all Apple products, a major core element of Apple product value, are manufactured in 
Austin, Texas.
■ Apple then uses contract manufacturers, mostly in China, to produce their products.
■ Those products are then shipped directly to Apple distributors in the Americas, Europe, and Singapore.
■ All of Apple’s global sales outside the U.S. are booked through (Apple Sales International), an Apple subsidiary in 
Ireland. Since it receives much higher prices on product than it pays for the goods, large profits are positioned in ASI.
■ ASI then pays its profits as dividends to another Irish company, its own parent company, in a Double Irish.

leading beauty, fashion, and home products in more 
than 100 countries. As part of the training in its corpo￾rate treasury offices, it has its interns build a spread￾sheet analysis of the following hypothetical subsidiary 
earnings/distribution analysis. Use the spreadsheet 
presented in Exhibit 15.6 for your basic structure.

tax rate to income depending on whether it is re￾tained (45%) or distributed to stockholders (30%).
a. If Kraftstoff planned to distribute 50% of its net 
income, what would be its total net income and 
total corporate tax bills?
b. If Kraftstoff was attempting to choose between 
a 40% and 60% payout rate to stockholders, 
what arguments and values would management 
use in order to convince stockholders which of 
the two payouts is in everyone’s best interest?
15.4 Gamboa’s Tax Averaging. Gamboa, Incorporated is 
a relatively new U.S.-based retailer of specialty fruits 
and vegetables. The firm is vertically integrated with 
fruit- and vegetable-sourcing subsidiaries in Central 
America and distribution outlets throughout the 
southeastern and northeastern regions of the U.S. 
Gamboa’s two Central American subsidiaries are in 
Belize and Costa Rica. Maria Gamboa, the daugh￾ter of the firm’s founder, is being groomed to take 
over the firm’s financial management in the near 
future. Like many firms of Gamboa’s size, it has not 
possessed a very high degree of sophistication in 
financial management simply out of time and cost 
considerations.
 Maria, however, has recently finished her MBA 
and is now attempting to put some specialized 
knowledge of U.S. taxation practices to work to 
save Gamboa money. Her first concern is tax aver￾aging for foreign tax liabilities arising from the two 
Central American subsidiaries. Costa Rican opera￾tions are slightly more profitable than Belize, which 
is particularly good since Costa Rica is a relatively 
low-tax country. Costa Rican corporate taxes are 
a flat 30%, and there are no withholding taxes im￾posed on dividends paid by foreign firms with op￾erations there. Belize has a higher corporate income 
tax rate, 40%, and imposes a 10% withholding tax 
on all dividends distributed to foreign investors. The 
current U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35%.
Belize Costa Rica
Earnings before taxes $1,000,000 $1,500,000
Corporate income tax rate 40% 30%
Dividend withholding tax rate 10% 0%
a. If Maria Gamboa assumes a 50% payout rate 
from each subsidiary, what are the additional 
taxes due on foreign-sourced income from Belize 
and Costa Rica individually? How much in addi￾tional U.S. taxes would be due if Maria averaged 
the tax credits/liabilities of the two units?
was 45% and there were no withholding taxes 
on dividends?
15.2 Pacific Jewel Airlines (Hong Kong). Pacific Jewel 
Airlines is a U.S.-based air-freight firm with a 
wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. The subsid￾iary, Jewel Hong Kong, has just completed a long￾term planning report for the parent company in San 
Francisco, in which it has estimated the following 
expected earnings and payout rates for the years 
2011–2014.
Jewel Hong Kong Income Items (millions US$)
2011 2012 2013 2014
Earnings before 
interest and 
taxes (EBIT) 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000
Less interest

Earnings 
before taxes 
(EBT) 7,200 9,000 10,800 12,600
The current Hong Kong corporate tax rate on this 
category of income is 16.5%. Hong Kong imposes 
no withholding taxes on dividends remitted to U.S. 
investors (per the Hong Kong–U.S. bilateral tax 
treaty). The U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35%. 
The parent company wants to repatriate 75% of 
net income as dividends annually.
a. Calculate the net income available for distribu￾tion by the Hong Kong subsidiary for the years 
2011–2014.
b. What is the amount of the dividend expected to 
be remitted to the U.S. parent each year?
c. After gross-up for U.S. tax liability purposes, 
what is the total dividend after tax (all Hong 
Kong and U.S. taxes) expected each year?
d. What is the effective tax rate on this foreign 
sourced income per year?
15.3 Kraftstoff of Germany. Kraftstoff is a German￾based company that manufactures electronic 
fuel-injection carburetor assemblies for several 
large automobile companies in Germany, includ￾ing Mercedes, BMW, and Opel. The firm, like many 
firms in Germany today, is revising its financial poli￾cies in line with the increasing degree of disclosure 
required by firms if they wish to list their shares 
publicly in or out of Germany. The company’s earn￾ings before tax (EBT) are €483,500,000.
Kraftstoff’s primary problem is that the German 
corporate income tax code applies a different income 
M15_EITE5960_16_GE_C15.indd 503 12/05/23 6:37 PM504 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
b. With the same payout rate from the Belize 
subsidiary of 50%, how should Maria change 
the payout rate of the Costa Rican subsidiary in 
order to most efficiently manage her total for￾eign tax bill?
c. What is the minimum effective tax rate that 
Maria can achieve on her foreign-sourced 
income?
Chinglish Dirk
Use the following company case to answer Problems 15.5 
through 15.7. Chinglish Dirk Company (Hong Kong) ex￾ports razor blades to its wholly owned parent company, 
Torrington Edge (Great Britain). Hong Kong tax rates are 
16%, and British tax rates are 30%. Chinglish calculates 
its profit per container as follows (all values in British 
pounds).

Less taxes (336,000) (769,500)
Profit, after-tax £1,764,000 £1,795,500
15.5 Chinglish Dirk (A). Corporate management of Tor￾rington Edge is considering repositioning profits 
within the multinational company. What happens to 
the profits of Chinglish Dirk and Torrington Edge, 
and the consolidated results of both, if the markup 
at Chinglish was increased to 20% and the markup 
at Torrington was reduced to 10%? What is the 
impact of this repositioning on consolidated tax 
payments?
15.6 Chinglish Dirk (B). Encouraged by the results from 
the previous problem’s analysis, corporate manage￾ment of Torrington Edge wishes to continue to re￾position profit in Hong Kong. It is, however, facing 
two constraints. First, the final sales price in Great 
Britain must be £20,000 or less to remain com￾petitive. Secondly, the British tax authorities—in 
working with Torrington Edge’s cost accounting 
staff—has established a maximum transfer price al￾lowed (from Hong Kong) of £17,800. What combina￾tion of markups do you recommend for Torrington 
Edge to institute? What is the impact of this repo￾sitioning on consolidated profits on after-tax and 
total tax payments?
15.7 Chinglish Dirk (C). Not to leave any potential tax 
repositioning opportunities unexplored, Torrington 
Edge wants to combine the components of Problem 
15.6 with a redistribution of overhead costs. If over￾head costs could be reallocated between the two 
units but still total £5,000 per unit and maintain a 
minimum of £1,750 per unit in Hong Kong, what 
is the impact of this repositioning on consolidated 
profits after-tax and total tax payments?

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
16.1 Discover the key elements of an import or export business transaction that define 
the trade relationship
16.2 Explore how the three key documents in import/export combine to finance both 
the transaction and to manage its risks
16.3 Describe the variety of government programs to help finance exports
16.4 Examine the major trade financing alternatives
16.5 Evaluate the use of a specialized technique, forfaiting, for medium- to long-term 
trade financing
The purpose of this chapter is to explain how international trade—exports and imports—is 
financed. The topic is of direct practical relevance both to domestic firms—that simply import 
and export—and to multinational firms—that trade with related and unrelated entities. The 
chapter opens with an exploration of the basic flows (goods, money, and documents) between 
importer and exporter and a discussion of the trade dilemma. The dilemma, that exporters 
want to be paid before they export and importers do not want to pay until they receive the 
goods, is at the center of trade finance. The second section then describes the three key trade 
documents—the letter of credit, draft, and bill of lading —and how they are used to manage 
the various risks of international import and export. The third section of the chapter describes 
government export financing programs, followed by a fourth section examining the alterna￾tive trade financing vehicles and instruments. The fifth and final section explores the use of 
forfaiting for the financing of medium- to long-term receivables. The mini-case at the end of 
the chapter, Crosswell International and Brazil, illustrates how an export requires the integra￾tion of management, marketing, and finance.
16.1 The Trade Relationship
As we saw in Chapter 1, the first significant global activity by a domestic firm is importing 
and exporting goods and services. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze the international 
trade phase for a domestic firm, when it begins to import goods and services from foreign 
suppliers and to export to foreign buyers. Let’s consider the case of a firm similar to our firm 
in Chapter 1, this trade phase began with suppliers from Mexico and buyers from Canada.
Trade financing shares a number of common characteristics with the traditional value 
chain activities conducted by all firms. All companies must search out suppliers for the many 
What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.

goods and services required as inputs for their own goods production or service provision 
processes. The firm’s Purchasing and Procurement Department must determine whether each 
potential supplier is capable of producing the product to required quality specifications and in 
a timely and reliable manner and whether the supplier will work with the firm in the ongoing 
process of product and process improvement for continued competitiveness. All must be at an 
acceptable price and payment terms. This same series of issues applies to potential customers, 
as their continued business is equally critical to any company’s operations and success.
The Fundamental Dilemma
International trade must work around a fundamental dilemma. Imagine an importer and an 
exporter who would like to do business with one another. Because of the distance between the 
two, it is not possible to simultaneously hand over goods with one hand and accept payment 
with the other. Trade therefore uses a three-channel movement to execute trades. Exhibit 16.1 
provides an overview of the three movements between an importer and an exporter: the flow 
of goods, the flow of funds, and the flow of documents. The first two, goods and funds, are 
obviously the objective of the trade relationship. The flow of documents, however, is com￾posed of a series of different arrangements, contracts, loans, or commitments which assure the 
two parties of contractual fulfillment.
Understanding the interests of the relationship between the exporter and the importer is 
critical to understanding the methods for import-export financing utilized in industry. If we 
assume for the moment the primacy of the exporter (standing in the shoes of the exporter), 
we can see three basic trade relationships based on affiliation and information.
1. Affiliated parties. This is another unit, another subsidiary, of the same company as the 
exporter. As siblings, knowledge and trust is at the highest level. This export relationship 
may not require a contract and may or may not require protection.
2. Unaffiliated known party. This is another company, unrelated but known to the exporter. 
That knowledge is the foundation for trust in terms of paying for the goods in a timely man￾ner. This will require a contract and possibly some type of protection against nonpayment.
3. Unaffiliated unknown party. This is another company that is not only unaffiliated, but one with 
no previous dealings with the exporter. The company may in fact be completely unknown to the 
exporter. This will require a contract as well as some form of protection against nonpayment.

M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 506 03/05/23 3:00 PMCHAPTER 16 International Trade Finance 507
A foreign importer, which is a subsidiary business unit of the exporter, would be an affili￾ated party (and transactions between the two would be referred to as intrafirm trade). Because 
both businesses are part of the same MNE, the most common practice would be to conduct the 
trade transaction without a contract or protection against nonpayment. This is, however, not 
always the case. In a variety of international business situations it may still be in the exporter’s 
best interest to detail the conditions for the business transaction and to possibly protect against 
any political or country-based interruption to the completion of the trade transaction. (This is 
particularly useful for gaining passage through ports or other logistical facilities.)
A foreign importer with which the exporter has previously conducted business successfully 
would be considered unaffiliated known. In this case, the two parties may still enter into a detailed 
sales contract, but specific terms and shipments or provisions of services may be significantly 
looser in definition. Depending on the depth of the relationship, the exporter may seek some 
third-party protection against noncompletion or conduct the business on an open account basis.
A foreign importer with which the exporter has not previously conducted business would 
be considered unaffiliated unknown. In this case, the two parties would need to enter into a 
detailed sales contract, outlining the specific responsibilities and expectations of the business 
agreement. The exporter would also need to seek out protection against the possibility that 
the importer would not make payment in full in a timely fashion.
Payment Risk
Exhibit 16.2 provides an array of different possibilities for an importer and exporter to man￾age payment risk. For the exporter, the safest and most secure arrangement would be for 
complete payment beforehand, cash-in-advance. That, in turn, is exactly what the importer 
does not want to do, having no ability to stop or withhold payment if the merchandise is not 
as promised. A compromise zone does exist between the extreme ends, including letters of 
credit or simple documentary collections. As we will describe in later sections, this requires 
contractual provisions for turning the goods over from exporter to importer and for payment.

M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 507 03/05/23 3:00 PM508 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
For the exporter, selling on open account, meaning no contract assuring payment, and con￾signment, getting paid only when the importer actually sells the merchandise and realizes 
cash settlement, are by far highly risky alternatives.
There is of course an unlimited number of different forms of possible transactions. 
Something as simple as an advance payment of, say, 10% can alter the trust factor completely. 
Regardless, it is always important to remember that the exporter has capital at risk having 
already invested in the manufacture of the merchandise. As a result, the exporter will try to 
retain control over the merchandise as long as possible until it is satisfied of getting paid.
The fundamental dilemma of being reluctant to trust a stranger in a foreign land can be 
resolved by using a highly respected bank as intermediary, as illustrated in Exhibit 16.3. In a 
greatly simplified view of this intermediary role, the importer obtains the bank’s promise to 
pay on its behalf, knowing that the exporter will trust the bank. The bank’s promise to pay is 
called a letter of credit (L/C). The exporter ships the merchandise to the importer’s country. 
Title to the merchandise is given to the bank on a document called a bill of lading (B/L). The 
exporter asks the bank to pay for the goods, and the bank does so. The document requesting 
payment is called a sight draft. The bank, having paid for the goods, now passes title to the 
importer, whom the bank trusts. At that time or later, depending on their agreement, the im￾porter reimburses the bank.
Financial managers of MNEs must understand these three basic documents because their 
firms will often trade with unaffiliated parties and also because the system of documentation 
provides a source of short-term capital that can be drawn upon even when shipments are to 
sister subsidiaries.
Benefits of the Documentary System
The three key documents and their interaction are discussed in detail later in this chapter. 
They constitute a system developed and modified over centuries to protect both importer 
and exporter from the risk of noncompletion and from foreign exchange risk as well as to 
provide a means of financing.
Protection against Risk of Noncompletion. As stated previously, once importer and ex￾porter agree on terms, the seller usually prefers to maintain legal title to the goods until 
paid or at least until assured of payment. The buyer, however, will be reluctant to pay before 
receiving the goods or at least before receiving title to them. Each wants assurance that the

other party will complete its portion of the transaction. The letter of credit, bill of lading, and 
sight draft are part of a system carefully constructed to determine who bears the financial loss 
if one of the parties defaults at any time.
Protection against Foreign Exchange Risk. In international trade, foreign exchange risk 
arises from transaction exposure. If the transaction requires payment in the exporter’s cur￾rency, the importer carries the foreign exchange risk. If the transaction calls for payment in 
the importer’s currency, the exporter has the foreign exchange risk.
Transaction exposure can be hedged by the techniques described in Chapter 10, but in 
order to hedge, the exposed party must be certain that payment of a specified amount will be 
made on or near a particular date. The three key documents described in this chapter ensure 
both amount and time of payment and thus lay the groundwork for effective hedging.
The risk of noncompletion and foreign exchange risk are most important when the in￾ternational trade is episodic, with no outstanding agreement for recurring shipments and no 
sustained relationship between buyer and seller. When the import/export relationship is of a 
recurring nature, as in the case of manufactured goods shipped weekly or monthly to a final 
assembly or retail outlet in another country, and when the relationship is between countries 
whose currencies are considered strong, the exporter may well bill the importer on open ac￾count after a normal credit check.
Financing the Trade. Most international trade involves a time lag during which funds are 
tied up while the merchandise is in transit. Once the risks of noncompletion and of exchange 
rate changes are disposed of, banks are willing to finance goods in transit. A bank can finance 
goods in transit, as well as goods held for sale, based on the key documents without exposing 
itself to questions about the quality of merchandise or aspects of shipment.
Noncompletion Risks
In order to understand the risks associated with international trade transactions, it is helpful 
to understand the sequence of events in any such transaction. Exhibit 16.4 illustrates, in prin￾ciple, the series of events associated with a single export transaction.
From a financial management perspective, the two primary risks associated with an in￾ternational trade transaction are currency risk (discussed previously in Chapter 10) and risk

GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 16.1
operating in a world where 30% of the people, their docu￾ments, and their approvals had disappeared. Settling trans￾actions suddenly took longer as documents moved more 
and more slowly. Exporters were waiting longer and longer 
for cash settlement during a period in which they needed the 
money to pay their own bills and hopefully stay afloat. Banks 
saw rising default rates, causing them to add even more care 
to the paper-based and detail-based credit analysis needed 
between importer and exporter. And those rising failure rates 
and declining bank interest caused fees and financing costs 
to rise.
Then something changed. Innovation finally stepped 
in the form of supply chain finance (SCF). Import facilitators, 
freight forwarders, and trade finance banks, all moved to 
cut steps and documents out of the trade finance process, 
automating more and more along the way. Banks improved 
their risk-taking ability to assess credit quality of importers, 
earning larger fees along the way. Fewer documents, fewer 
steps, faster payment. It seems that old dogs can learn new 
tricks.
Trade Finance Gains and Losses from the 
Global Pandemic
Roughly 80% of all international trade requires some form of 
trade financing. That means that somewhere around $15 tril￾lion of trade transactions, contracts and agreements between 
importers and exporters, need some form of external or third￾party financing in order to happen each year. And of that 
$15 trillion, roughly 80% of that is funded by 10 banks in 
London, New York, and Singapore, which make very slim 
margins on the business. The average trade transaction re￾quires the exchange of 36 documents and 240 copies, all 
executed under the intensity of a magnifying glass for detail 
and accuracy. And as noted by The Economist, trade finance 
is “notoriously paper-based.” Yet despite looking like the larg￾est low-hanging fruit in the “waiting-to-be-digitized” fintech 
world, trade finance has been very slow to change. Until now.
It took a pandemic. The 2020 global pandemic shut 
down a large part of the global economy, and that meant 
international trade. That trade that did continue found itself 
of noncompletion. Exhibit 16.5 illustrates the traditional business problem of credit manage￾ment: the exporter quotes a price, finalizes a contract, and ships the goods, losing physical 
control over the goods based on trust of the buyer or the promise of a bank to pay based on 
documents presented. The risk of default on the part of the importer—risk of noncomple￾tion—is present as soon as the financing period begins, as depicted in Exhibit 16.4.
In many cases, the initial task of analyzing the creditworthiness of foreign customers is 
similar to procedures for analyzing domestic customers. If the exporter has had no experience 
with a foreign customer but the customer is a large, well-known firm in its home country, the ex￾porter may simply ask for a bank credit report on that firm. The exporter may also talk to other 
firms that have had dealings with the foreign customer. If these investigations show the foreign 
customer (and country) to be completely trustworthy, the exporter would likely ship to them 
on open account, with a credit limit, just as they would for a domestic customer. This is the least 
costly method of handling exports because there are no heavy documentation or bank charges.
However, before a regular trading relationship has been established with a new or unknown 
firm, the exporter must face the possibility of nonpayment for its exports or noncompletion of 
its imports. The risk of nonpayment can be eliminated through the use of a letter of credit is￾sued by a creditworthy bank. Risks of noncompletion skyrocketed during the global pandemic 
inducing change to this ancient industry, as described in Global Finance in Practice 16.1.
16.2 Key Documents
The three key documents described in the following pages—the letter of credit, draft, and bill 
of lading—constitute a system developed and modified over centuries to protect both importer 
and exporter from the risk of noncompletion of the trade transaction as well as to provide a 
means of financing. These three key trade documents are part of a carefully constructed system 
to determine who bears the financial loss if one of the parties defaults at any time.
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 510 03/05/23 3:00 PMCHAPTER 16 International Trade Finance 511
Letter of Credit (L/C)
A letter of credit (L/C) is a document issued by a bank at the request of an importer (the ap￾plicant/buyer) by which the bank promises to pay an exporter (the beneficiary of the letter) 
upon presentation of documents specified in the L/C. An L/C reduces the risk of noncomple￾tion because the bank agrees to pay against documents rather than actual merchandise. The 
relationship between the three parties can be seen in Exhibit 16.5.
Parties to a Letter of Credit (L/C). A beneficiary (exporter) and an applicant (importer) 
agree on a transaction and the importer then applies to its local bank for the issuance of an 
L/C. The importer’s bank issues an L/C and cuts a sales contract based on its assessment of 
the importer’s creditworthiness, or the bank might require a cash deposit or other collateral 
from the importer in advance. The importer’s bank will want to know the type of transaction, 
the amount of money involved, and what documents must accompany the draft that will be 
drawn against the L/C.
If the importer’s bank is satisfied with the credit standing of the applicant, it will issue an 
L/C guaranteeing to pay for the merchandise if shipped in accordance with the instructions 
and conditions contained in the L/C.
The essence of an L/C is the promise of the issuing bank to pay against specified docu￾ments that must accompany any draft drawn against the credit. The L/C is not a guarantee 
of the underlying commercial transaction. Indeed, the L/C is a separate transaction from any 
sales or other contracts on which it might be based. To constitute a true L/C transaction, the 
following elements must be present with respect to the issuing bank:
1. The issuing bank must receive a fee or other valid business consideration for issuing 
the L/C.
2. The bank’s L/C must contain a specified expiration date or a definite maturity.
3. The bank’s commitment must have a stated maximum amount of money.
4. The bank’s obligation to pay must arise only on the presentation of specific documents, 
and the bank must not be called on to determine disputed questions of fact or law.
5. The bank’s customer must have an unqualified obligation to reimburse the bank on the 
same condition as the bank has paid.
Commercial letters of credit are also classified based on whether they are revocable and 
confirmed.

EXHIBIT 16.6 Essence of a Letter of Credit (L/C)
Irrevocable versus Revocable L/C. An irrevocable L/C obligates the issuing bank to 
honor drafts drawn in compliance with the credit and can be neither canceled nor modified 
without the consent of all parties, including in particular the beneficiary (exporter). A revo￾cable L/C can be canceled or amended at any time before payment; it is intended to serve as 
a means of arranging payment but not as a guarantee of payment.
Confirmed versus Unconfirmed L/C. A confirmed L/C is issued by one bank and can 
be confirmed by another bank, in which case the confirming bank can honor drafts drawn 
in compliance with the L/C. An unconfirmed L/C is the obligation only of the issuing 
bank.
An exporter is likely to want a foreign bank’s L/C confirmed by a domestic bank 
when the exporter has doubts about the foreign bank’s ability to pay. Such doubts can 
arise when the exporter is unsure of the financial standing of the foreign bank or if politi￾cal or economic conditions in the foreign country are unstable. The essence of an L/C is 
shown in Exhibit 16.6.
Most commercial letters of credit are documentary, meaning that certain documents 
must be included with drafts drawn under their terms. Required documents usually include a 
bill of lading (discussed in more detail later in the chapter), a commercial invoice, and any of 
the following: consular invoice, insurance certificate or policy, and packing list.
Advantages and Disadvantages of L/Cs. The primary advantage of an L/C is that 
it reduces risk; the exporter can sell against a bank’s promise to pay rather than against 
the promise of a commercial firm. The exporter is also in a more secure position as to the 
availability of foreign exchange to pay for the sale, since banks are more likely to be aware 
of foreign exchange conditions and rules than is the importing firm itself. If the importing 
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 512 03/05/23 3:00 PMCHAPTER 16 International Trade Finance 513
country should change its foreign exchange rules during the course of a transaction, the 
government is likely to allow already outstanding bank letters of credit to be honored 
for fear of throwing its own domestic banks into international disrepute. Of course, if the 
L/C is confirmed by a bank in the exporter’s country, the exporter avoids any problem of 
blocked foreign exchange.
An exporter may find that an order backed by an irrevocable L/C will facilitate ob￾taining pre-export financing in the home country. If the exporter’s reputation for delivery 
is good, a local bank may lend funds to process and prepare the merchandise for shipment. 
Once the merchandise is shipped in compliance with the terms and conditions of the L/C, 
payment for the business transaction is made and funds will be generated to repay the 
pre-export loan.
Another advantage of an L/C to the importer is that the importer need not pay out 
funds until the documents have arrived at a local port or airfield and unless all conditions 
stated in the L/C have been fulfilled. The main disadvantages of L/Cs are the fees charged 
by the importer’s bank for issuing its L/C and the possibility that the L/C reduces the 
importer’s borrowing line of credit with its bank. It may, in fact, be a competitive disad￾vantage for the exporter to demand automatically an L/C from an importer, especially if 
the importer has a good credit record and there is no concern regarding the economic or 
political conditions of the importer’s country. In balance, though, the value of the L/C has 
been well established since the beginning of commerce, as detailed in Global Finance in 
Practice 16.2.
Draft
A draft, sometimes called a bill of exchange (B/E), is the instrument normally used in interna￾tional commerce to effect payment. A draft is simply an order written by an exporter (seller) 
instructing an importer (buyer) or its agent to pay a specified amount of money at a specified 
time. Thus, it is the exporter’s formal demand for payment from the importer.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 16.2
Merchants conducted their trade on a bench—a banco—
which gave rise to the term for the safe place in which to 
keep one’s money.
But the coins were heavy, and if a merchant were 
traveling from one city or country to another to conduct 
trade, the weight was substantial, as was the chance 
of being robbed. So the merchants created the first fi￾nancial derivative, a draft on the banco—a letter of ex￾change—which could be carried from one city to another 
and was recognized as a credit for florins on account at 
their home banco. Payment was guaranteed within three 
months. Of course, with the creation of banks came the 
first failures—bankruptcies.
From the very beginning, whether it was the loaning of 
money, the validity of a letter of exchange, or even the value 
of a currency, all were instruments or activities that involved 
risk, or risque in the Italian of the time.
Florence—The Birthplace of Trade 
Financing
Merchant banking for international trade largely began in 
a landlocked city, Florence, Italy. In the late thirteenth and 
early fourteenth centuries as commerce grew throughout 
Europe and the Mediterranean, banking began to develop 
in both Venice and Florence. It was a time in which com￾merce was still in its infancy, with the Catholic Church pro￾hibiting many aspects of commerce, including the loaning 
of money in return for interest usury. Although usury has 
come to mean the illegal activity of charging excessive rates 
of interest, the term originally referred to charging interest 
of any kind.
The florin is a small gold coin first minted in Florence in 
1252. Named after the city, the florin flourished as a means 
of transacting trade across Europe in the following century. 
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 513 03/05/23 3:00 PM514 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
The person or business initiating the draft is known as the maker (also known as 
the drawer or originator). Normally, maker is the exporter who sells and ships the mer￾chandise. The party to whom the draft is addressed is the drawee. The drawee is asked 
to honor the draft, that is, to pay the amount requested according to the stated terms. In 
commercial transactions, the drawee is either the buyer, in which case the draft is called a 
trade draft, or the buyer’s bank, in which case the draft is called a bank draft. Bank drafts 
are usually drawn according to the terms of an L/C. A draft may be drawn as a bearer 
instrument, or it may designate a person to whom payment is to be made. This person, 
known as the payee, may be the drawer itself or it may be some other party such as the 
drawer’s bank.
Negotiable Instruments. If properly drawn, drafts can become negotiable instruments. As 
such, they provide a convenient instrument for financing the international movement of the 
merchandise. To become a negotiable instrument, a draft must conform to the following re￾quirements—Uniform Commercial Code, Section 3104(1):
1. It must be in writing and signed by the maker or drawer.
2. It must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a definite sum of money.
3. It must be payable on demand or at a fixed or determinable future date.
4. It must be payable to order or to bearer.
If a draft is drawn in conformity with the above requirements, a person receiving it with 
proper endorsements becomes a “holder in due course.” This is a privileged legal status that 
enables the holder to receive payment despite any personal disagreements between drawee 
and maker because of controversy over the underlying transaction. If the drawee dishonors 
the draft, payment must be made to any holder in due course by any prior endorser or by 
the maker. This clear definition of the rights of parties who hold a negotiable instrument as 
a holder in due course has contributed significantly to the widespread acceptance of various 
forms of drafts, including personal checks.
Types of Drafts. Drafts are of two types: sight drafts and time drafts. A sight draft is payable 
on presentation to the drawee; the drawee must pay at once or dishonor the draft. A time 
draft, also called a usance draft, allows a delay in payment. It is presented to the drawee, 
who accepts it by writing or stamping a notice of acceptance on its face. Once accepted, the 
time draft becomes a promise to pay by the accepting party (the buyer). When a time draft 
is drawn on and accepted by a bank, it becomes a bankers’ acceptance; when drawn on and 
accepted by a business firm, it becomes a trade acceptance (T/A).
The time period of a draft is referred to as its tenor. To qualify as a negotiable instrument, 
and so be attractive to a holder in due course, a draft must be payable on a fixed or deter￾minable future date. For example, “60 days after sight” is a fixed date, which is established 
precisely at the time the draft is accepted. However, payment “on arrival of goods” is not 
determinable since the date of arrival cannot be known in advance. Indeed, there is no assur￾ance that the goods will arrive at all.
Bankers’ Acceptances. When a draft is accepted by a bank, it becomes a bankers’ ac￾ceptance. As such it is the unconditional promise of that bank to make payment on the 
draft when it matures. In quality, the bankers’ acceptance is practically identical to a mar￾ketable bank certificate of deposit (CD). The holder of a bankers’ acceptance need not 
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 514 03/05/23 3:00 PMCHAPTER 16 International Trade Finance 515
wait until maturity to liquidate the investment but may sell the acceptance in the money 
market, where constant trading in such instruments occurs. The amount of the discount de￾pends entirely on the credit rating of the bank that signs the acceptance or another bank 
that reconfirmed the bankers’ acceptance for a fee. The total cost or all-in cost of using a 
bankers’ acceptance compared to other short-term financing instruments is analyzed later 
in this chapter.
Bill of Lading (B/L)
The third key document for financing international trade is the bill of lading (B/L). The bill of 
lading is issued to the exporter by a common carrier transporting the merchandise. It serves 
three purposes: as a receipt, a contract, and a document of title.
As a receipt, the bill of lading indicates that the carrier has received the merchandise 
described on the face of the document. The carrier is not responsible for ascertaining that 
the containers hold what is alleged to be their contents, so descriptions of merchandise on 
bills of lading are usually short and simple. If shipping charges are paid in advance, the bill of 
lading will usually be stamped “freight paid” or “freight prepaid.” If merchandise is shipped 
collect—a less common procedure internationally than domestically—the carrier maintains a 
lien on the goods until freight is paid.
As a contract, the bill of lading indicates the obligation of the carrier to provide 
certain transportation in return for certain charges. Common carriers cannot disclaim 
responsibility for their negligence by inserting special clauses in a bill of lading. The bill 
of lading may specify alternative ports in the event that delivery cannot be made to the 
designated port, or it may specify that the goods will be returned to the exporter at the 
exporter’s expense.
As a document of title, the bill of lading is used to obtain payment or a written promise of 
payment before the merchandise is released to the importer. The bill of lading can also func￾tion as collateral, against which funds may be advanced to the exporter by its local bank prior 
to or during shipment and before final payment by the importer.
The bill of lading is typically made payable to the order of the exporter, who thus re￾tains title to the goods after they have been handed to the carrier. Title to the merchandise 
remains with the exporter until payment is received, at which time the exporter endorses 
the bill of lading (which is negotiable) in blank (making it a bearer instrument) or to the 
party making the payment, usually a bank. The most common procedure would be for pay￾ment to be advanced against a documentary draft accompanied by the endorsed order bill 
of lading.
After paying the draft, the exporter’s bank forwards the documents through bank clear￾ing channels to the bank of the importer. The importer’s bank, in turn, releases the docu￾ments to the importer after payment (sight drafts); after acceptance (time drafts addressed to 
the importer and marked D/A); or after payment terms have been agreed upon (drafts drawn 
on the importer’s bank under provisions of an L/C).
Documentation in a Typical Trade Transaction
Although a trade transaction could conceivably be handled in many ways, we shall now turn 
to a hypothetical example that illustrates the interaction of the various documents. Assume 
that an exporter in the U.S. receives an order from a Canadian buyer. For the exporter, this 
will be an export financed under an L/C requiring a bill of lading, with the exporter collecting

EXHIBIT 16.7 Steps in a Typical Trade Transaction
via a time draft that was accepted by the Canadian buyer’s bank. Such a transaction proceeds 
as follows, illustrated in Exhibit 16.7.
1. The Canadian buyer—the Importer in Exhibit 16.7—places an order with the Exporter 
in Exhibit 16.7, asking if the exporter is willing to ship under an L/C.
2. The exporter agrees to ship under an L/C and specifies relevant information such as 
prices and terms.
3. The Canadian buyer applies to its bank, North Bank in Exhibit 16.7, for an L/C to be is￾sued in favor of the exporter for the merchandise it wishes to buy.
4. North Bank issues the L/C in favor of the exporter and sends it to the exporter’s bank, 
South Bank in Exhibit 16.7.
5. South Bank advises the exporter of the opening of an L/C in the exporter’s favor. South 
Bank may or may not confirm the L/C to add its own guarantee to the document.
6. The exporter ships the goods to the Canadian buyer.
7. The exporter prepares a time draft and presents it to its bank, South Bank. The draft 
is drawn (i.e., addressed to) North Bank in accordance with North Bank’s L/C and ac￾companied by other documents as required, including the bill of lading. The exporter 
endorses the bill of lading in blank (making it a bearer instrument) so that title to the 
goods goes with the holder of the documents—the holder being South Bank at this point 
in the transaction.
8. South Bank presents the draft and documents to North Bank for acceptance. North Bank 
accepts the draft by stamping and signing it (making it a bankers’ acceptance), takes 
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 516 03/05/23 3:00 PMCHAPTER 16 International Trade Finance 517
possession of the documents, and promises to pay the now-accepted draft at maturity—
say, 60 days.
9. North Bank returns the accepted draft to South Bank. Alternatively, South Bank 
might ask North Bank to accept and discount the draft. Should this occur, North 
Bank would remit the cash less a discount fee rather than return the accepted draft 
to South Bank.
10. South Bank, having received back the accepted draft, now a bankers’ acceptance, may 
choose between several alternatives. South Bank may sell the acceptance in the open 
market at a discount to an investor, typically a corporation or financial institution with 
excess cash it wants to invest for a short period of time. South Bank may also hold the 
acceptance in its own portfolio.
11. If South Bank discounts the acceptance with North Bank (mentioned in Step 9) or dis￾counts it in the local money market, South Bank will transfer the proceeds less any fees 
and discount to the exporter. Another possibility would be for the exporter itself to take 
possession of the acceptance, hold it for 60 days, and present it for collection. Normally, 
however, exporters prefer to receive the discounted cash value of the acceptance at once 
rather than wait for the acceptance to mature and receive a slightly greater amount of 
cash at a later date.
12. North Bank notifies the Canadian buyer of the arrival of the documents. The Canadian 
buyer signs a note or makes some other agreed upon plan to pay North Bank for the mer￾chandise in 60 days. North Bank releases the underlying documents so that the Canadian 
buyer can obtain physical possession of the shipment at once.
13. After 60 days, North Bank receives funds from the Canadian buyer to pay the maturing 
acceptance.
14. On the same day, the 60th day after acceptance, the holder of the matured acceptance 
presents it for payment and receives its face value. The holder may present it directly to 
North Bank or return it to South Bank and have South Bank collect it through normal 
banking channels.
Although this is a typical transaction involving an L/C, few international trade transac￾tions are probably ever truly typical. Business, and more specifically international business, 
requires flexibility and creativity by management at all times. The mini-case at the end of this 
chapter presents an application of the mechanics of a real business situation. The result is a 
classic challenge to management: When and on what basis should typical procedures be com￾promised in order to accomplish strategic goals?
16.3 Government Programs to Help Finance Exports
Governments of most export-oriented industrialized countries have special financial insti￾tutions that provide some form of subsidized credit to their own national exporters. These 
export finance institutions offer terms that are better than those generally available from the 
private sector. Thus, domestic taxpayers are subsidizing sales to foreign buyers in order to 
create employment and maintain a technological edge. The most important institutions usu￾ally offer export credit insurance and an export-import bank for export financing.
Export Credit Insurance
The exporter who insists on cash or an L/C payment for foreign shipments is likely to 
lose orders to competitors from other countries that provide more favorable credit terms. 
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 517 03/05/23 3:00 PM518 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
Better credit terms are often made possible by means of export credit insurance, which 
provides assurance to the exporter or the exporter’s bank that, should the foreign cus￾tomer default on payment, the insurance company will pay for a major portion of the loss. 
Because of the availability of export credit insurance, commercial banks are willing to 
provide medium- to long-term financing (five to seven years) for exports. Importers prefer 
that the exporter purchase export credit insurance to pay for nonperformance risk by the 
importer. In this way, the importer does not need to pay to have an L/C issued and does 
not reduce its credit line.
Competition between nations to increase exports by lengthening the period for which 
credit transactions can be insured may lead to a credit war and to unsound credit decisions. 
To prevent such an unhealthy development, a number of leading trading nations joined 
together in 1934 to create the Berne Union (officially, the Union d’Assureurs des Credits 
Internationaux) for the purpose of establishing a voluntary international understanding on 
export credit terms. The Berne Union recommends maximum credit terms for many items 
including, for example, heavy capital goods (five years), light capital goods (three years), and 
consumer durable goods (one year).
In the United States, export credit insurance is provided by the Foreign Credit Insurance 
Association (FCIA). This is an unincorporated association of private commercial insurance 
companies operating in cooperation with the Export-Import Bank (discussed in the next sec￾tion). The FCIA provides policies protecting U.S. exporters against the risk of nonpayment 
by foreign debtors as a result of commercial and political risks. Losses due to commercial risk 
are those that result from the insolvency or protracted payment default of the buyer. Political 
losses arise from actions of governments beyond the control of buyer or seller.
Export-Import Bank and Export Financing
The Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) is an independent agency of the U.S. government, es￾tablished in 1934 to stimulate and facilitate the foreign trade of the U.S. Interestingly, the 
Eximbank was originally created primarily to facilitate exports to the Soviet Union. In 1945, 
the Eximbank was re-chartered “to aid in financing and to facilitate exports and imports 
and the exchange of commodities between the United States and any foreign country or the 
agencies or nationals thereof.”1
The Eximbank facilitates the financing of U.S. exports through various loan guarantee 
and insurance programs. The Eximbank guarantees repayment of medium-term (181 days 
to five years) and long-term (five years to ten years) export loans extended by U.S. banks 
to foreign borrowers. The Eximbank’s medium- and long-term, direct-lending operation is 
based on participation with private sources of funds. Essentially, the Eximbank lends dollars 
to borrowers outside the United States for the purchase of U.S. goods and services. Proceeds 
of such loans are paid to U.S. suppliers. The loans themselves are repaid with interest in dol￾lars to the Eximbank. The Eximbank requires private participation in these direct loans in 
order to (1) ensure that it complements rather than competes with private sources of export 
financing, (2) spread its resources more broadly, and (3) ensure that private financial institu￾tions will continue to provide export credit.
The Eximbank also guarantees lease transactions; finances the costs involved in the prep￾aration by U.S. firms of engineering, planning, and feasibility studies for non-U.S. clients on 
large capital projects; and supplies counseling for exporters, banks, or others needing help in 
finding financing for U.S. goods.

16.4 Trade Financing Alternatives
In order to finance international trade receivables, firms use the same financing instruments 
that they use for domestic trade receivables, plus a few specialized instruments that are only 
available for financing international trade. Exhibit 16.8 identifies the main short-term financ￾ing instruments and their costs.
Bankers’ Acceptances
Bankers’ acceptances, described earlier in this chapter, can be used to finance both domestic 
and international trade receivables. Exhibit 16.8 shows that bankers’ acceptances earn a yield 
comparable to other money market instruments, especially marketable bank certificates of 
deposit. However, the all-in cost to a firm of creating and discounting a bankers’ acceptance 
also depends upon the commission charged by the bank that accepts the firm’s draft.
The first owner of the bankers’ acceptance created from an international trade transac￾tion will be the exporter, who receives the accepted draft back after the bank has stamped 
it “accepted.” The exporter may hold the acceptance until maturity and then collect. On an 
acceptance of, say, $100,000 for three months the exporter would receive the face amount less 
the bank’s acceptance commission of 1.5% per annum:
Face amount of the acceptance
Less 1.5% per annum commission for three months
Amount received by exporter in three months
$100,000
- 375
$ 99,625
(.015 * 3/12 * $100,000)
Alternatively, the exporter may “discount”—that is, sell at a reduced price—the accep￾tance to its bank in order to receive funds at once. The exporter will then receive the face 
amount of the acceptance less both the acceptance fee and the going market rate of discount 
for bankers’ acceptances. If the discount rate were 1.14% per annum as shown in Exhibit 16.8, 
the exporter would receive the following:
Face amount of the acceptance
Less 1.5% per annum commission for three months
Less 1.14% per annum discount rate for three months
Amount received by exporter at once
$100,000
- 375
- 285
$ 99,340
(.015 * 3/12 * $100,000)
(.0114 * 3/12 * $100,000)

GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 16.3
Face Amount of Receivable ¥40,000,000
Non-Recourse Fee -400,000
Factoring fee (2% per month x 3 months) -2,400,000
Net proceeds on sale (received now) ¥37,200,000
If HSL decides to go ahead with factoring, they will re￾ceive ¥37.2 million immediately (93% of the face amount). 
Although this may appear expensive, it may be needed to 
service their debt obligations. Sometimes, firms include the 
cost of factoring in their quoted price based on client’s pay￾ment terms. Alternatively, the firm might offer an upfront 
discount to the buyer if they pay quicker. For example, 5% 
discount if paid within 10 days of the invoice.
Factoring in Practice
A Chinese manufacturer of high-definition LCD screens, 
Hubei Screens Ltd (HSL), had been facing a short-term 
cash crunch. HSL also has significant amount of debt that 
need regular cash inflow to service these debts. They have 
received a large order worth ¥40 million. The receivable is 
due in 90 days. The directors of HSL have estimated that 
they cannot wait for 90 days to receive this cash. Their bank 
has offered a factoring service. They have quoted that this 
will cost HSL a one-time 1% non-recourse fee and then 
a 2% per month factoring fee till the payment is received 
from the buyer. Their accountant has prepared the following 
calculations:
Therefore, the annualized all-in cost of financing this bankers’ acceptance is as follows:
Commission + discount
Proceeds
:
360
90 = $375 + $285
$99,340
:
360
90 = .0266 or 2.66%
The discounting bank may hold the acceptance in its own portfolio, earning for itself the 1.14% 
per annum discount rate, or the acceptance may be resold in the acceptance market to portfolio 
investors. Investors buying bankers’ acceptances provide the funds that finance the transaction.
Trade Acceptances
Trade acceptances are similar to bankers’ acceptances except that the accepting entity is a com￾mercial firm, like General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), rather than a bank. The 
cost of a trade acceptance depends on the credit rating of the accepting firm plus the commission 
it charges. Like bankers’ acceptances, trade acceptances are sold at a discount to banks and other 
investors at a rate that is competitive with other money market instruments (see Exhibit 16.8).
Factoring
Specialized firms, known as factors, purchase receivables at a discount on either a non-recourse 
or recourse basis. Non-recourse means that the factor assumes the credit, political, and for￾eign exchange risk of the receivables it purchases. Recourse means that the factor can give 
back receivables that are not collectable. Since the factor must bear the cost and risk of as￾sessing the creditworthiness of each receivable, the cost of factoring is usually quite high. It is 
more than borrowing at the prime rate plus points.
The all-in cost of factoring non-recourse receivables is similar in structure to accep￾tances. The factor charges a commission to cover the non-recourse risk, typically 1.5%–2.5%, 
plus interest deducted as a discount from the initial proceeds. On the other hand, the firm 
selling the non-recourse receivables avoids the cost of determining the creditworthiness of 
its customers.
It also does not have to show debt borrowed to finance these receivables on its bal￾ance sheet. Furthermore, the firm avoids both foreign exchange and political risk on these 
non-recourse receivables. Global Finance in Practice 16.3 provides an example of the costs.
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 520 03/05/23 3:00 PMCHAPTER 16 International Trade Finance 521
Securitization
The securitization of export receivables for financing trade is an attractive supplement to 
bankers’ acceptance financing and factoring. A firm can securitize its export receivables 
by selling them to a legal entity established to create marketable securities based on a 
package of individual export receivables. An advantage of this technique is to remove the 
export receivables from the exporter’s balance sheet because they have been sold without 
recourse.
Receivables are normally sold at a discount. The size of the discount depends on four 
factors:
1. The historic collection risk of the exporter
2. The cost of credit insurance
3. The cost of securing the desirable cash flow stream to the investors
4. The size of the financing and services fees
Securitization is more cost-effective if there is a large value of transactions with a known 
credit history and default probability. A large exporter could establish its own securitiza￾tion entity. While the initial setup cost is high, the entity can be used on an ongoing basis. 
Alternatively, smaller exporters could use a common securitization entity provided by a fi￾nancial institution, thereby saving the expensive setup costs.
Bank Credit Lines
A firm’s bank credit line can typically be used to finance, up to a fixed upper limit, say 80%, 
of accounts receivable. Export receivables can be eligible for inclusion in bank credit line 
financing. However, credit information on foreign customers may be more difficult to collect 
and assess. If a firm covers its export receivables with export credit insurance, it can greatly 
reduce the credit risk of those receivables. This insurance enables the bank credit line to 
cover more export receivables and lower the interest rate for that coverage. Of course, any 
foreign exchange risk must be handled by the transaction exposure techniques described in 
Chapter 10.
The cost of using a bank credit line is usually the prime rate of interest plus points to re￾flect a particular firm’s credit risk. As usual, 100 points is equal to 1%. In the U.S., borrowers 
are also expected to maintain a compensating deposit balance at the lending institution. In 
Europe and many other places, lending is done on an overdraft basis. An overdraft agreement 
allows a firm to overdraw its bank account up to the limit of its credit line. Interest at prime 
plus points is based only on the amount of overdraft borrowed. In either case, the all-in cost 
of bank borrowing using a credit line is higher than acceptance financing, as shown in Exhibit 
16.8.
Commercial Paper
A firm can issue commercial paper—unsecured promissory notes—to fund its short-term 
financing needs, including both domestic and export receivables. However, it is only the large, 
well-known firms with favorable credit ratings that have access to either the domestic or euro 
commercial paper market. As shown in Exhibit 16.8, commercial paper interest rates lie at 
the low end of the yield curve.

EXHIBIT 16.9 Typical Forfaiting Transaction
16.5 Forfaiting
Forfaiting is a specialized technique to eliminate the risk of nonpayment by importers in 
instances where the importing firm and/or its government is perceived by the exporter to be 
too risky for open account credit. The name of the technique comes from the French à forfait, 
a term that implies “to forfeit or surrender a right.”
Role of the Forfaiter
The essence of forfaiting is the non-recourse sale by an exporter of bank-guaranteed 
promissory notes, bills of exchange, or similar documents received from an importer in 
another country. The exporter receives cash at the time of the transaction by selling the 
notes or bills at a discount from their face value to a specialized finance firm, called a for￾faiter. The forfaiter arranges the entire operation prior to the execution of the transaction. 
Although the exporting firm is responsible for the quality of delivered goods, it receives a 
clear and unconditional cash payment at the time of the transaction. All political and com￾mercial risk of nonpayment by the importer is carried by the guaranteeing bank. Small 
exporters, who trust their clients to pay, find the forfaiting technique invaluable because it 
eases cash flow problems.
During the Soviet era, expertise in the technique was centered in German and Austrian 
banks, which used forfaiting to finance sales of capital equipment to eastern European, 
“Soviet Bloc” countries. British, Scandinavian, Italian, Spanish, and French exporters have 
now adopted the technique, but U.S. and Canadian exporters are reported to be slow to use 
forfaiting, possibly because they are suspicious of its simplicity and lack of complex docu￾mentation. Nevertheless, some American firms now specialize in the technique, and the 
Association of Forfaiters in the Americas (AFIA) has more than 20 members. Major export 
destinations financed via the forfaiting technique are Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, 
and Latin America.
A Typical Forfaiting Transaction
A typical forfaiting transaction involves five parties and seven steps, as shown in Exhibit 16.9.
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 522 03/05/23 3:00 PMCHAPTER 16 International Trade Finance 523
Step 1. Agreement. Importer and exporter agree on a series of imports to be paid for 
over a period of time, typically three to five years. However, periods as long as 10 years and 
as short as 180 days have been financed using the technique. The normal minimum size for a 
transaction is $100,000. The importer agrees to make periodic payments, often against prog￾ress on delivery or completion of a project.
Step 2. Commitment. The forfaiter promises to finance the transaction at a fixed discount 
rate, with payment to be made when the exporter delivers to the forfaiter the appropriate 
promissory notes or other specified paper. The agreed-upon discount rate is based on the cost 
of funds in the euromarket, usually on LIBOR for the average life of the transaction, plus a 
margin over LIBOR to reflect the perceived risk in the deal.
This risk premium is influenced by the size and tenor of the deal, country risk, and the 
quality of the guarantor institution. On a five-year deal, for example, with 10 semiannual pay￾ments, the rate used would be based on the 2.25-year LIBOR rate. This discount rate is nor￾mally added to the invoice value of the transaction so that the cost of financing is ultimately 
borne by the importer. The forfaiter charges an additional commitment fee of from 0.5% per 
annum to as high as 6.0% per annum from the date of its commitment to finance until receipt 
of the actual discount paper issued in accordance with the finance contract. This fee is also 
normally added to the invoice cost and passed on to the importer.
Step 3. Aval or Guarantee. The importer obligates itself to pay for its purchases by 
issuing a series of promissory notes, usually maturing every six or twelve months, against 
progress on delivery or completion of the project. These promissory notes are first deliv￾ered to the importer’s bank where they are endorsed (that is, guaranteed) by that bank. 
In Europe, this unconditional guarantee is referred to as an aval, which translates into 
English as “backing.”
At this point, the importer’s bank becomes the primary obligor in the eyes of all subse￾quent holders of the notes. The bank’s aval or guarantee must be irrevocable, unconditional, 
divisible, and assignable. Because U.S. banks do not issue avals, U.S. transactions are guar￾anteed by a standby letter of credit (L/C), which is functionally similar to an aval but more 
cumbersome. For example, L/Cs can normally be transferred only once.
Step 4. Delivery of Notes. The now-endorsed promissory notes are delivered to the 
exporter.
Step 5. Discounting. The exporter endorses the notes “without recourse” and dis￾counts them with the forfaiter receiving the agreed-upon proceeds. Proceeds are usually 
received two days after the documents are presented. By endorsing the notes “without 
recourse,” the exporter frees itself from any liability for future payment on the notes and 
thus receives the discounted proceeds without having to worry about any further pay￾ment difficulties.
Step 6. Investment. The forfaiting bank either holds the notes until full maturity as an 
investment or endorses and re-discounts them in the international money market. Such sub￾sequent sale by the forfaiter is usually without recourse. The major rediscount markets are in 
London and Switzerland, plus New York for notes issued in conjunction with Latin American 
business.
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 523 03/05/23 3:00 PM524 PART 4 Financing the Global Firm
Step 7. Maturity. At maturity, the investor holding the notes presents them for collection 
to the importer or to the importer’s bank. The promise of the importer’s bank is what gives 
the documents their value.
In effect, the forfaiter functions as both a money market firm (e.g., a lender of short-term 
financing) and a specialist in packaging financial deals involving country risk. As a money 
market firm, the forfaiter divides the discounted notes into appropriately sized packages and 
resells them to various investors having different maturity preferences. As a country risk spe￾cialist, the forfaiter assesses the risk that the notes will eventually be paid by the importer 
or the importer’s bank and puts together a deal that satisfies the needs of both exporter and 
importer.
Success of the forfaiting technique springs from the belief that the aval—the guaran￾tee of a commercial bank—can be depended upon. Although commercial banks are the 
normal and preferred guarantors, guarantees by government banks or government min￾istries of finance are accepted in some cases. On occasion, large commercial enterprises 
have been accepted as debtors without a bank guarantee. An additional aspect of the tech￾nique is that the endorsing bank’s aval is perceived to be an “off balance sheet” obliga￾tion—the debt is presumably not considered by others in assessing the financial structure 
of the commercial banks.
Summary Points
■ International trade takes place between three catego￾ries of relationships: unaffiliated unknown parties, un￾affiliated known parties, and affiliated parties.
■ International trade transactions between affiliated 
parties typically do not require contractual arrange￾ments or external financing. Trade transactions be￾tween unaffiliated parties typically require contracts 
and some type of external financing, such as that avail￾able through letters of credit.
■ The basic procedure of financing international trade 
rests on the interrelationship between three key docu￾ments: the letter of credit (L/C), the bill of lading, and 
the draft.
■ In the L/C, the bank substitutes its credit for that of 
the importer and promises to pay if certain documents 
are submitted to the bank. The exporter may now rely 
on the promise of the bank rather than on the promise 
of the importer.
■ The exporter typically ships with a bill of lading, at￾taches the bill of lading to a draft that orders pay￾ment from the importer’s bank, and presents these 
documents, plus any of a number of additional 
documents, through its own bank to the importer’s 
bank.
■ If the documents are in order, the importer’s bank ei￾ther pays the draft (a sight draft) or accepts the draft 
(a time draft). In the latter case, the bank promises to 
pay in the future. At this step, the importer’s bank ac￾quires title to the merchandise through the bill of lad￾ing and releases the merchandise to the importer.
■ The total costs to an exporter of entering a foreign 
market include the transaction costs of the trade fi￾nancing, the import and export duties and tariffs ap￾plied by exporting and importing nations, and the 
costs of foreign market penetration.
■ Trade financing uses the same financing instruments 
as does domestic receivables financing, plus some 
specialized instruments that are only available for fi￾nancing international trade. A popular instrument for 
short-term financing is a bankers’ acceptance.
■ Other short-term financing instruments with a domes￾tic counterpart are trade acceptances, factoring, secu￾ritization, bank credit lines (usually covered by export 
credit insurance), and commercial paper
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 524 03/05/23 3:00 PMMINI-CASE
Crosswell International and Brazil2
Crosswell International is a U.S.-based manufacturer and 
distributor of health care products, including children’s 
diapers. Crosswell has been approached by Leonardo 
Sousa, the president of Material Hospitalar, a distributor 
of health care products throughout Brazil. Sousa is inter￾ested in distributing Crosswell’s major diaper product, 
Precious Diapers, but only if an acceptable arrangement 
regarding pricing and payment terms can be reached.
Exporting to Brazil
Crosswell’s manager for export operations, Geoff Ma￾thieux, followed up the preliminary discussions by putting 
together an estimate of export costs and pricing for discus￾sion purposes with Sousa. Crosswell needs to know all of 
the costs and pricing assumptions for the entire supply and 
value chain as it reaches the consumer. Mathieux believes 
it critical that any arrangement that Crosswell enters into 
results in a price to consumers in the Brazilian market￾place that is both fair to all parties involved and competi￾tive, given the market niche Crosswell hopes to penetrate. 
This first cut on pricing Precious Diapers into Brazil is pre￾sented in Exhibit A.
Crosswell proposes to sell the basic diaper line to 
the Brazilian distributor for $34.00 per case, FAS (free 
alongside ship) Miami docks. This means that the seller, 
Crosswell, agrees to cover all costs associated with getting 
the diapers to the Miami docks. The costs of loading the 
diapers onto the ship, of the actual shipping (freight), and 
of the associated documents is $4.32 per case. The running 
subtotal, $38.32 per case, is termed CFR (cost and freight). 
Finally, the insurance expenses related to the potential loss 
of the goods while in transit to final port of destination, 
export insurance, are $0.86 per case. The total CIF (cost, 
insurance, and freight) is $39.18 per case, or 97.95 Brazilian 
real per case, assuming an exchange rate of 2.50 Brazilian 
real (R$) per U.S. dollar ($). In summary, the CIF cost of 
R$97.95 is the price charged by the exporter to the import￾er on arrival in Brazil, and is calculated as follows:
CIF = FAS + freight + export insurance
= ($34.00 + $4.32 + $0.86) * R$2.50
= R$97.95
The actual cost to the distributor in getting the dia￾pers through the port and customs warehouses must also 
be calculated in terms of what Leonardo Sousa’s costs are 
in reality. The various fees and taxes detailed in Exhibit 
A raise the fully landed cost of the Precious Diapers to 
R$107.63 per case. The distributor would now bear storage 
and inventory costs totaling R$8.33 per case, which would 
bring the costs to R$115.96. The distributor then adds a 
margin for distribution services of 20% (R$23.19), raising 
the price as sold to the final retailer to R$139.15 per case.
Finally, the retailer (a supermarket or other retailer 
of consumer health care products) would include its ex￾penses, taxes, and markup to reach the final shelf price to 
the customer of R$245.48 per case. This final retail price 
estimate now allows both Crosswell and Material Hospi￾talar to evaluate the price competitiveness of the Precious 
Ultra-Thin Diaper in the Brazilian marketplace and provides 
a basis for further negotiations between the two parties.
The Precious Ultra-Thin Diaper will be shipped via 
container. Each container will hold 968 cases of diapers. 
The costs and prices in Exhibit A are calculated on a per 
case basis, although some costs and fees are assessed by 
container. Mathieux provides the export price quotation 
shown in Exhibit A, an outline of a potential representa￾tion agreement (for Sousa to represent Crosswell’s prod￾uct lines in the Brazilian marketplace), and payment and 
credit terms to Leonardo Sousa. Crosswell’s payment and 
credit terms are that Sousa either pay in full in cash in ad￾vance or remit a confirmed irrevocable documentary L/C 
with a time draft specifying a tenor of 60 days.
Crosswell also requests from Sousa financial state￾ments, banking references, foreign commercial references, 
descriptions of regional sales forces, and sales forecasts 
for the Precious Diaper line. These last requests allow 
Crosswell to assess Material Hospitalar’s ability to be a 
dependable, creditworthy, and capable long-term partner 
and representative of the firm in the Brazilian marketplace. 
The discussions that follow focus on finding acceptable 
common ground between the two parties and on work￾ing to increase the competitiveness of the Precious Diaper 
product line in the Brazilian marketplace
Crosswell’s Proposal
The proposed sale by Crosswell to Material Hospitalar, 
at least in the initial shipment, is for 10 containers of 968 
cases of diapers at $39.18 per case, CIF Brazil, payable in 
U.S. dollars. This is a total invoice amount of $379,262.40. 
Payment terms are that a confirmed L/C will be required 
of Material Hospitalar on a U.S. bank. The payment will 
be based on a time draft of 60 days, presentation to the

bank for acceptance with other documents on the date of 
shipment. Both the exporter and the exporter’s bank will 
expect payment from the importer or the importer’s bank 
60 days from this date of shipment.
What Should Crosswell Expect?
Assuming Material Hospitalar acquires the L/C and it is 
confirmed by Crosswell’s bank in the United States, Cross￾well will ship the goods after the initial agreement—say, 
15 days—as illustrated in Exhibit B. Simultaneous with 
the shipment, when Crosswell has lost physical control 
over the goods, Crosswell will present the bill of lading 
(acquired at the time of shipment) with the other needed 
documents to its bank requesting payment. Because the 
export is under a confirmed L/C, assuming all documents 
are in order, Crosswell’s bank will give Crosswell two 
choices:
1. Wait the full time period of the time draft of 60 days 
and receive the entire payment in full ($379,262.40).
2. Receive the discounted value of this amount today. The 
discounted amount, assuming U.S. dollar interest rate 
of 6.00% per annum (1.00% per 60 days):

Because the invoice is denominated in U.S. dollars, 
Crosswell need not worry about currency value changes 
(currency risk). And because its bank has confirmed the 
L/C, it is protected against changes or deteriorations in 
Material Hospitalar’s ability to pay on the future date.
What Should Material Hospitalar Expect?
Material Hospitalar will receive the goods on or before 
day 60. It will then move the goods through its distribu￾tion system to retailers. Depending on the payment terms 
between Material Hospitalar and its buyers (retailers), 
it could either receive cash or terms for payment for the 
goods. Because Material Hospitalar purchased the goods 
via the 60-day time draft and an L/C from its Brazilian 
bank, total payment of $379,262.40 is due on day 90 (ship￾ment and presentation of documents was on 30 + 60 day 
time draft) to the Brazilian bank. Material Hospitalar, be￾cause it is a Brazilian-based company and has agreed to 
make payment in U.S. dollars (foreign currency), carries 
the currency risk of the transaction.
Crosswell/Material Hospitalar’s Concern
The concern the two companies hold, however, is that the 
total price to the consumer in Brazil, R$245.48 per case, or 
R$0.70/diaper (small size), is too high. The major competi￾tors in the Brazilian market for premium quality diapers, 
Kenko do Brasil (Japan), Johnson and Johnson (U.S.), and 
Procter and Gamble (U.S.), are cheaper (see Exhibit C).

Problems
16.1 Nakatomi Toyota. Nakatomi Toyota buys its 
cars from Toyota Motors (U.S.), and sells them to 
U.S. customers. One of its customers is EcoHire, 
a car rental firm that buys cars from Nakatomi 
Toyota at a wholesale price. Final payment is due 
to Nakatomi Toyota in six months. EcoHire has 
bought USD200,000 worth of cars from Nakatomi, 
with a cash down payment of USD40,000 and the 
balance due in six months without any interest 
charged as a sales incentive. Nakatomi Toyota will 
have the EcoHire receivable accepted by Alliance 
Acceptance for a 2% fee, and then sell it at a 3% per 
annum discount to Wells Fargo Bank.
a. What is the annualized percentage all-in cost to 
Nakatomi Toyota?
b. What are Nakatomi’s net cash proceeds, includ￾ing the cash down payment?
16.2 Motoguzzie (A). Motoguzzie exports large-engine 
motorcycles (greater than 700cc) to Australia 
and invoices its customers in U.S. dollars. Sydney 
Wholesale Imports has purchased $3,000,000 of 
merchandise from Motoguzzie, with payment due 
in six months. The payment will be made with a 
bankers’ acceptance issued by Charter Bank of 
Sydney at a fee of 1.75% per annum. Motoguzzie 
has a weighted average cost of capital of 10%. If 
Motoguzzie holds this acceptance to maturity, what 
is its annualized percentage all-in cost?
16.3 Motoguzzie (B). Assuming the facts in Problem 
16.3, Bank of America is now willing to buy 
Motoguzzie’s bankers’ acceptance for a discount of 
M16_EITE5960_16_GE_C16.indd 528 03/05/23 3:00 PMCHAPTER 16 International Trade Finance 529
with the forfaiter, Bank of Zurich, receiving the full 
$200,000 principal amount. Bank of Zurich will sell 
the notes by re-discounting them to investors in the 
international money market without recourse. At 
maturity, the investors holding the notes will pres￾ent them for collection at Lagos City Bank. If Lagos 
City Bank defaults on payment, the investors will 
collect on the notes from Bank of Zurich.
a. What is the annualized percentage all-in cost to 
Umaru Oil of financing the first $200,000 note 
due March 1, 2011?
b. What might motivate Umaru Oil to use this 
relatively expensive alternative for financing?
16.7 Sunny Coast Enterprises (A). Sunny Coast 
Enterprises has sold a combination of films and 
DVDs to Hong Kong Media Incorporated for 
US$100,000, with payment due in six months. 
Sunny Coast Enterprises has the following alterna￾tives for financing this receivable: (1) Use its bank 
credit line. Interest would be at the prime rate of 
5% plus 150 basis points per annum. Or (2) use its 
bank credit line but purchase export credit insur￾ance for a 1% fee. Because of the reduced risk, 
the bank interest rate would be reduced to 5% per 
annum without any points. In both cases Sunny 
Coast would need to maintain a compensating 
balance of 20% of the loan’s face amount, and no 
interest will be paid on the compensating balance 
by the bank.
a. What are the annualized percentage all-in costs 
of each alternative?
b. What are the advantages and disadvantages of 
each alternative?
c. Which alternative would you recommend?
16.8 Sunny Coast Enterprises (B). Sunny Coast 
Enterprises has been approached by a factor that 
offers to purchase the Hong Kong Media Imports 
receivable at a 16% per annum discount plus a 2% 
charge for a non-recourse clause.
a. What is the annualized percentage all-in cost of 
this factoring alternative?
b. What are the advantages and disadvantages of 
the factoring alternative compared to the alter￾natives in Problem 16.7?
16.9 United Sports (A). United Sports is considering 
bidding to sell $100,000 of ski equipment to Phang 
Family Enterprises of Seoul, South Korea. Payment 
would be due in six months. Since United Sports 
cannot find good credit information on Phang, 
United Sports wants to protect its credit risk. It is 
considering the following financing solution.
Phang’s bank issues a letter of credit on behalf 
of Phang and agrees to accept United Sports’s draft 
6% per annum. What would be Motoguzzie’s annual￾ized percentage all-in cost of financing its $3,000,000 
Australian receivable?
16.4 San Mateo Servers (A). San Mateo Servers (U.S.) 
has sold Internet servers to Telecom España for 
EUR700,000. Payment is due in three months and 
will be made with a trade acceptance from Telecom 
España Acceptance. The acceptance fee is 1.0% per 
annum of the face amount of the note. This accep￾tance will be sold at a 4% per annum discount. What 
is the annualized percentage all-in cost in euros of 
this method of trade financing?
16.5 San Mateo Servers (B). Assume that San Mateo 
Servers prefers to receive U.S. dollars rather than 
euros for the trade transaction described in Problem 
16.4. It is considering two alternatives: (1) sell the 
acceptance for euros at once and convert the euros 
immediately to U.S. dollars at the spot rate of ex￾change of USD1.000 = €1.00 or (2) hold the euro 
acceptance until maturity but at the start sell the 
expected euro proceeds forward for dollars at the 
3-month forward rate of USD1.02 = EUR1.00.
a. What are the U.S. dollar net proceeds received 
at once from the discounted trade acceptance in 
alternative 1?
b. What are the U.S. dollar net proceeds received 
in three months in alternative 2?
c. What is the break-even investment rate that 
would equalize the net U.S. dollar proceeds from 
both alternatives?
d. Which alternative should Nikken Microsystems 
choose?
16.6 Forfaiting at Umaru Oil (Nigeria). Umaru Oil of 
Nigeria has purchased $1,000,000 of oil drilling 
equipment from Gunslinger Drilling of Houston, 
Texas. Umaru Oil must pay for this purchase over 
the next five years at a rate of $200,000 per year due 
on March 1 of each year. Bank of Zurich, a Swiss for￾faiter, has agreed to buy the five notes of $200,000 
each at a discount. The discount rate would be ap￾proximately 8% per annum based on the expected 
3-year LIBOR rate plus 200 basis points, paid 
by Umaru Oil. Bank of Zurich would also charge 
Umaru Oil an additional commitment fee of 2% 
per annum from the date of its commitment to fi￾nance until receipt of the actual discounted notes is￾sued in accordance with the financing contract. The 
$200,000 promissory notes will come due on March 
1 in successive years. The promissory notes issued 
by Umaru Oil will be endorsed by their bank, Lagos 
City Bank, for a 1% fee and delivered to Gunslinger 
Drilling. At this point, Gunslinger Drilling will en￾dorse the notes without recourse and discount them

versus selling the banker’s acceptance today in 
the money market?
b. What would you recommend Inca Breweries do?
16.12 Sézane Footware (A). Sézane Company, Paris, has 
received an order for 50,000 cartons of athletic 
shoes from Southampton Footware, Ltd. (SFL), 
England, payment to be in British pounds sterling.
The shoes will be shipped to SFL under the terms 
of a letter of credit issued by a London bank on 
behalf of SFL. The letter of credit specifies that 
the face value of the shipment, £400,000, will be 
paid 120 days after the London bank accepts a 
draft drawn by SFL in accordance with the terms 
of the letter of credit. The current discount rate in 
London on 120-day bankers’ acceptances is 12% 
per annum, and SFL estimates its weighted aver￾age cost of capital to be 18% per annum. The com￾mission for selling a banker's acceptance in the 
discount market is 2.0% of the face amount.
a. Would Sezane gain by holding the acceptance to 
maturity, as compared to discounting the bank￾ers’ acceptance at once?
b. Does Sezane incur any other risks in this 
transaction?
16.13 Sézane Footware (B). Assume that Great Britain 
charges a duty of 10% on shoes imported into the 
United Kingdom. Sezane, in Problem 16.12, dis￾covers that it can manufacture shoes in Northern 
Ireland and import them into Britain free of any 
import duty. What factors should Sezane con￾sider in deciding to continue to export shoes from 
France versus manufacture them in Northern 
Ireland?
for $100,000 due in six months. The acceptance fee 
would cost United Sports $500, plus reduce Phang’s 
available credit line by $100,000. The bankers’ 
acceptance note of $100,000 would be sold at a 2% 
per annum discount in the money market. What 
is the annualized percentage all-in cost to United 
Sports of this bankers’ acceptance financing?
16.10 United Sports (B). United Sports could also buy 
export credit insurance from FCIA for a 1.5% pre￾mium. It finances the $100,000 receivable from 
Phang from its credit line at 6% per annum interest. 
No compensating bank balance would be required.
a. What is United Sports’s annualized percentage 
all-in cost of financing?
b. What are Phang’s costs?
c. What are the advantages and disadvantages of 
this alternative compared to the bankers’ accep￾tance financing in Problem 16.9? Which alterna￾tive would you recommend?
16.11 Inca Breweries of Peru. Inca Breweries of Lima, 
Peru, has received an order for 10,000 cartons of 
beer from Alicante Importers of Alicante, Spain. 
The beer will be exported to Spain under the terms 
of a letter of credit issued by a Madrid bank on be￾half of Alicante Importers. The letter of credit speci￾fies that the face value of the shipment, $720,000 
U.S. dollars, will be paid 90 days after the Madrid 
bank accepts a draft drawn by Inca Breweries in ac￾cordance with the terms of the letter of credit.
The current discount rate on 3-month bankers’ 
acceptance is 8% per annum, and Inca Breweries 
estimates its weighted average cost of capital to 
be 20% per annum. The commission for selling a 
bankers’ acceptance in the discount market is 1.2% 
of the face amount.
a. What is the difference, in present value terms, 
between holding the acceptance to maturity

17.1 Demonstrate how key competitive advantages support a strategy to sustain direct 
foreign investment
17.2 Explore the decision process of the multinational in its choices of markets and 
structural choices for market entry
17.3 Define and classify the political risks faced by multinational firms when investing 
abroad
17.4 Examine the financial impacts of political risk on the multinational firm
17.5 Discuss the many different methods employed by multinationals to mitigate 
political risks
A multinational firm investing in other countries is executing its corporate strategy with for￾eign direct investment (FDI). This chapter first explores the theoretical foundations of the 
decision to undertake FDI. This is followed by an exploration of how the multinational may 
choose a country or market and then what form of entry it chooses to utilize. In each of these 
we focus on the financial risks and returns associated with these decisions. The third section 
of the chapter introduces, defines, and provides a classification scheme for political risk. The 
fourth section examines the potential financial impacts of political risk, with the fifth and final 
section providing an overview of the multitude of mitigation strategies used by multinationals 
when confronting these political risks. The chapter concludes with the mini-case Argentina 
and the Vulture Funds, an exploration of a unique series of legal and political risks in global 
financial markets and the sovereign borrowers who depend on them.
17.1 The Foreign Direct Investment Decision
The strategic decision to undertake foreign direct investment (FDI) by a multinational firm 
is an expansion of its global strategy. The OLI Paradigm helps to explain the decision by 
a multinational firm to undertake FDI.1 The OLI Paradigm creates an overall framework 
to explain why multinational enterprises choose foreign direct investment (FDI) rather than 
choosing to serve foreign markets through alternative modes, such as licensing or exporting.

Foreign Direct Investment 
and Political Risk
In this world, shipmates, Sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without passport; 
whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers.
—Herman Melville, Chapter 9, The Sermon, in Moby Dick, 1851
17
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 532 10/07/23 4:37 PMCHAPTER 17 Foreign Direct Investment and Political Risk 533
The OLI Paradigm states that a firm must first have some competitive advantage in its 
home market —“O” for ownership advantages—that can be transferred abroad if the firm is 
to be successful in foreign direct investment. Second, the firm must be attracted by specific 
characteristics of the foreign market—“L” for location advantages—that will allow it to ex￾ploit its competitive advantages in that market. Third, the firm will maintain its competitive 
position by attempting to control the entire value chain in its industry—“I” for internaliza￾tion advantages. The satisfaction of these three conditions can lead the MNE to select foreign 
direct investment over licensing or outsourcing.
Ownership Advantages. As described earlier, a firm must have competitive advantages in 
its home market. These advantages must be firm specific, not easily copied, and in a form that 
allows them to be transferred to foreign subsidiaries. For example, economies of scale and fi￾nancial strength are not necessarily firm specific because they can be achieved by many other 
firms. Certain kinds of technology can be purchased, licensed, or copied. Even differentiated 
products can lose their advantage to slightly altered versions, given enough marketing effort 
and the right price.
Location Advantages. These factors are typically market imperfections or genuine com￾parative advantages that attract FDI to particular locations. These factors might include a 
low-cost but productive labor force, unique sources of raw materials, a large domestic market, 
defensive investments to counter other competitors, or centers of technological excellence.
Internalization Advantages. According to the OLI Paradigm, the key ingredient for 
maintaining a firm specific competitive advantage is possession of proprietary information 
and control of the human capital that can generate new information through expertise in 
research. Needless to say, once again, large research-intensive firms are most likely to fit this 
description. Minimizing transactions costs is a key element in a successful Internalization 
strategy. Wholly owned FDI reduces the agency costs that arise from asymmetric information, 
lack of trust, and the need to monitor foreign partners, suppliers, and financial institutions. 
Self-financing eliminates the need to observe specific debt covenants on foreign subsidiaries 
that are financed locally or by joint venture partners. If a multinational firm has a low global 
cost and high availability of capital, why share it with joint venture partners, distributors, li￾censees, and local banks, all of which probably have a higher cost of capital?
The Financial Strategy. Financial strategies are directly related to the OLI Paradigm in ex￾plaining FDI, as shown in Exhibit 17.1. The MNE’s financial managers can proactively formulate 
financial strategies in advance. These include strategies necessary to gain an advantage from lower 
global cost and greater availability of capital. Other proactive financial strategies include nego￾tiating financial subsidies and/or reduced taxation to increase free cash flows, reducing financial 
agency costs through FDI, and reducing operating and transaction exposure through FDI.
Reactive financial strategies, as illustrated in Exhibit 17.1, depend on discovering market 
imperfections. For example, the MNE can exploit misaligned exchange rates and stock prices. 
It also needs to react to capital controls that prevent the free movement of funds and react to 
opportunities to minimize worldwide taxation.
17.2 Structural Choices for Foreign Market Entry
A multinational firm’s decision to invest abroad is followed by choices of which markets and 
how to enter them—through which business forms and structures. Ultimately, the choice of 
both target markets and entry structures will establish what types of political risk (the subject 
of the following section of this chapter) the firm then faces.
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 533 10/07/23 4:37 PM534 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
Selecting Target Markets
The decision about where to invest abroad for the first time is influenced by behavioral fac￾tors. A firm learns from its first few investments abroad, and the lessons learned influence 
subsequent investments. Theoretically, the MNE will search worldwide for market imperfec￾tions and comparative advantage until it finds a country in which it expects to enjoy a com￾petitive advantage large enough to generate an acceptable risk-adjusted rate of return on 
new investments.
In practice, firms follow a sequential pattern in their search for target markets. This logi￾cal pattern of rational thought lies behind two behavioral theories of FDI described next, the 
behavioral approach and the international network theory.
The Behavioral Approach to FDI. The behavioral approach to analyzing the FDI deci￾sion is typified by the so-called Swedish School of economists.2 The Swedish School has rather 
successfully explained not just the initial decision to invest abroad but also later decisions to 
reinvest elsewhere and to change the structure of a firm’s international involvement over time.
Based on the internationalization process of a sample of Swedish MNEs, economists 
observed that these firms tended to invest first in countries that were not too far distant 
in psychic terms. Countries having close psychic distance were defined as those with a cul￾tural, legal, and institutional environment similar to Sweden’s, such as Norway, Denmark, 
Finland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Initial investments were modest in size, mini￾mizing the risk of an uncertain foreign environment. As Swedish firms learned from their

initial investments, they became willing to take greater risks with respect to both the psychic 
distance of the countries and the size of the investments.
MNEs in a Network Perspective. As the Swedish MNEs grew and matured, so did the na￾ture of their international involvement, what is often termed the network perspective. Today, 
each MNE is perceived as being a member of an international network, with nodes based in 
each of the foreign subsidiaries, as well as the parent firm itself. Centralized (hierarchical) 
control has given way to decentralized (heterarchical) control. Foreign subsidiaries compete 
with each other and with the parent for expanded resource commitments, thus influencing 
the strategy and reinvestment decisions.
Many of these MNEs have become political coalitions with competing internal and ex￾ternal networks. Each subsidiary is embedded in its host country’s network of suppliers and 
customers. It is also a member of a worldwide network based on its industry. Finally, it is a 
member of an organizational network under the control of the parent firm. Complicating 
matters still further is the possibility that the parent itself may have evolved into a transna￾tional firm, one owned by a coalition of investors located in different countries.
Choosing Entry Structures
The multinational investor has a number of different alternatives for penetrating a foreign 
market. In principle, the greater the depth of market penetration desired with greater ex￾pected returns, the greater the investment required with higher potential risks. The globaliza￾tion process includes a sequence of decisions regarding where production is to occur and who 
is to own and control assets, both production facilities and intellectual property. Exhibit 17.2 
provides a road map to explain this FDI sequence. Again, our interest and focus throughout

M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 535 10/07/23 4:37 PM536 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
The first and most fundamental of choices is that between choosing to change the firm’s 
competitive advantage or to pursue a foreign market expansion of its existing competitive 
advantage. Our subject here is the latter, the selection of the preferred entry structure abroad 
in concert with the firm’s existing competitive advantage. The choice to change competitive 
advantage is the subject for courses in global strategy.
Exporting versus Production Abroad. There are several advantages to limiting a firm’s 
activities to exports. Exporting has none of the unique risks facing FDI, joint ventures, stra￾tegic alliances, and licensing. Political risks are minimal. Agency costs, such as monitoring 
and evaluating foreign units, are avoided. The amount of front-end investment is typically 
lower than in other modes of foreign involvement. Foreign exchange risks remain, however. 
The fact that a significant share of exports (and imports) is executed between MNEs and 
their foreign subsidiaries and affiliates further reduces the risk of exports compared to other 
modes of involvement.
There are also disadvantages of limiting a firm’s activities to exports. The firm’s abil￾ity to leverage its competencies, its product and services sales reach, is more limited than if 
it invested directly. The firm also risks losing markets to imitators and global competitors 
that might be more cost efficient in production abroad, as well as having deeper distribution. 
Allowing competitors to gain strength, competency, and reach in foreign markets may expose 
the firm in its own home market. Defensive FDI is often motivated by the need to prevent 
this kind of predatory behavior as well as to preempt foreign markets from competitors.
Licensing and Management Contracts. Licensing is a popular method for domestic 
firms to profit from foreign markets without the need to commit sizeable funds. Since the 
foreign producer is typically wholly owned locally, political risk is minimized. In recent years, 
a number of host countries have demanded that MNEs sell their services in pieces (“un￾bundled form”) rather than only through FDI. Such countries would like their local firms to 
purchase managerial expertise and knowledge of product and factor markets through man￾agement contracts and purchase technology through licensing agreements.
The main disadvantage of licensing is that license fees are likely to be lower than FDI 
profits, although the return on the marginal investment might be higher. Licensing income is 
often much steadier as an income stream, as licensing fees are normally calculated as a per￾centage of sales (the top line, typically large and relatively stable) versus FDI profits based on 
business returns (the bottom line, which can be negative). Other disadvantages to licensing 
include possible loss of control, specifically quality control; the potential to create a new com￾petitor at home and abroad; and the possibility that the technology will be stolen.
MNEs have not typically used licensing of independent firms. On the contrary, most li￾censing arrangements have been with their own foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures. The 
returns to licensing, license fees, are a way to spread the corporate research and development 
cost among all operating units and a means of repatriating profits in a form more acceptable 
to some host countries than dividends.
Management contracts are similar to licensing insofar as they provide for some cash flow 
from a foreign source without significant foreign investment or exposure. Management con￾tracts probably lessen political risk because repatriation of managers is easy. International 
consulting and engineering firms traditionally conduct their foreign business based on a man￾agement contract.
Whether licensing and management contracts are cost-effective compared to FDI de￾pends on the price host countries will pay for the unbundled services. If the price were high 
enough, many firms would prefer to take advantage of market imperfections in an unbundled 
way, particularly in view of the lower political, foreign exchange, and business risks. Because 
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 536 10/07/23 4:37 PMCHAPTER 17 Foreign Direct Investment and Political Risk 537
we observe MNEs continuing to prefer FDI, we must assume that the price for selling un￾bundled services is still too low, as managerial expertise is often dependent on a delicate mix 
of organizational support factors that cannot be transferred abroad efficiently.
Joint Venture versus Wholly Owned Subsidiary. A joint venture (JV) is a business 
entity with shared ownership, sharing both risks and returns in the business. A foreign busi￾ness unit that is partially owned by the parent company is typically termed a foreign affiliate. 
A foreign business unit that is 50% or more owned (and therefore controlled) by the parent 
company is typically designated a foreign subsidiary. A JV would therefore typically be de￾scribed as a foreign affiliate, but not a foreign subsidiary.
There are three primary motivations for using a JV to share control, ownership, and ex￾pected returns: (1) a requirement for entry into the host country; (2) joining with a partner 
that brings unique and valued qualities or capabilities to the business; and (3) as a way to 
mitigate the political, business, and capital risks associated with the investment.
Developing countries see FDI as a major contributor to economic and income develop￾ment. But these nation-building benefits are potentially more rapidly and effectively cap￾tured if the JV includes a domestic partner (from the host country). Domestic partners often 
have substantially less experience and capital to contribute to the JV yet bring extensive and 
rare knowledge of doing business in their home country (including business and political 
relationships) and the ability to contribute more mid-level managers of competence. This last 
element, the ability to contribute skilled management on multiple levels to the JV business, 
is invaluable in many cases.
Many FDI investments require unique combinations of skills, technology, and competen￾cies that many firms, even multinational firms, do not possess on their own. A JV partner, do￾mestic or foreign, that brings those skills to the partnership may make the difference between 
success and failure.
The third motivation for using a JV structure, risk mitigation, is particularly valuable 
in infrastructure and natural resource development projects in emerging economies. First, 
the capital requirements for such projects are of such a scale, they may constitute a “bet 
the ranch” proposition for any one firm on its own. Secondly, many host country govern￾ments find it politically appealing that the JV represents a multilateral investment in their 
country. Without playing favorites, the host country in many cases gains additional bargaining 
strength in and amongst the partners themselves.
Most joint ventures, despite the “sharing” elements that make them desirable to begin with, 
still often establish one partner as the operator for efficiency of leadership and control. The de￾sire for singular control, however, is also why JVs are still not as common as wholly owned sub￾sidiaries. MNEs fear interference by the partner in certain critical decision areas. Indeed, what 
is optimal from the viewpoint of the local venture may be suboptimal for the multinational 
operation as a whole. The most important potential conflicts or difficulties are these:
■ Local and foreign partners may have divergent views about the need for cash dividends 
or about the desirability of growth financed from retained earnings versus new financing.
■ Transfer pricing on products or components, bought from or sold to related companies, 
creates a potential for conflict of interest.
■ Ability of a firm to rationalize production on a worldwide basis can be jeopardized if 
such rationalization would act to the disadvantage of local joint venture partners.
■ Financial disclosure of local results might be necessary with locally traded shares or a 
local partner, whereas if the firm is wholly owned from abroad such disclosure is not 
needed.
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 537 10/07/23 4:37 PM538 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
■ Valuation of equity shares is difficult. How much should the local partner pay for its 
share? What is the value of contributed technology, or of contributed land in a country 
where all land is state owned?
■ It is highly unlikely that foreign and host country partners have similar opportunity costs 
of capital, expectations about the required rate of return, or perceptions of appropriate 
premiums for business, foreign exchange, and political risks.
■ Insofar as the venture is a component of the portfolio of each investor, its contribution to 
portfolio return and variance may be quite different for each.
In the end, depending on the size and capital required for project development, the typical 
joint venture lasts only five to seven years. JVs between a multinational partner and a domestic 
partner do, however, have a history of longer effective business lives. Global Finance in Practice 
17.1 describes one such example where Honda, a Japanese conglomerate used joint venture to 
gain access to a new market in India.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 17.1
following year’s Hero Honda wanted to export its two wheel￾ers to lucrative southeast Asian market, where Honda already 
had subsidiaries. In 1999, Honda established its fully owned 
subsidiary, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, Pvt Ltd. 
(HMSI) in India and started manufacturing scooters in 2001 
and motorcycles in 2004. In 2011, Honda and the Hero group 
separated their ways when Hero bought out Honda’s shares 
in the joint venture. Hero group owned Hero MotoCorp and 
Honda owned HMSI respectively remained the first and sec￾ond largest manufacturer of two wheelers in India in 2023. 
Joint Venture to Wholly Owned Subsidiary
To enter India’s two-wheeler market, automobile company 
Honda started a joint venture with Hero group of India in 1984 
to create Hero Honda and provided INR 40 million or 25% of 
the equity in the venture. At that time, Honda needed local 
expertise to enter the Indian market which hero group pro￾vided. This joint venture proved very successful and became 
world’s largest motorcycle manufacturer by 2001. However, in 
Honda’s strategy in the Indian two-wheeler market is a 
good example of use of joint venture to get a foothold in a 
new market and then use that to establish a fully owned 
subsidiary.

Greenfield Investments and Foreign Acquisitions. A wholly owned foreign investment 
maximizes both the risks and potential returns to the multinational parent company. Whether 
it is a greenfield investment, a project built from the ground up anew (hence, from a green 
field), or via an acquisition, the purchase of an existing business in-country, the MNE would 
maximize its effective control over its investment future (at least to the level that host coun￾try authorities will allow). The disadvantages, however, may be substantial, and the multi￾national parent would likely miss out on the many benefits enjoyed by having a domestic 
partner as described above.
Strategic Alliances. A final mode of foreign investment that can apply to a number of the 
forms described in Exhibit 17.2 is the strategic alliance. A strategic alliance may take a variety 
of different forms depending on its primary objective. Common forms include joint market￾ing and servicing agreements, cross-ownership swaps, and more comprehensive partnerships 
and joint ventures.
A first level of cooperation might be in the form of a joint marketing and servicing agree￾ment in which each partner represents the other in certain markets. This is a very common 
form used by companies with consumer product industries, in which different firms or part￾ners have different regional or national presence advantages. In some cases, however, this 
form of cooperation has often been criticized as resembling the industrial cartels prevalent 
in several industrial markets in the 1920s and 1930s. Because they reduce competition, these 
agreements—if deemed a cartel—have been banned by international agreements and by 
many national laws.
A second level of alliance is when two firms exchange a share of ownership with one 
another. This form of strategic alliance can serve the purpose of being a takeover defense, 
particularly if the prime purpose is for a firm to place some of its stock in stable and 
friendly hands. If that is all that occurs, then it is in reality just another form of portfolio 
investment.
A third level of strategic alliance is more comprehensive. In addition to exchanging stock, 
the partners establish a separate joint venture (or a number of joint ventures) to develop and 
manufacture a product or service. Numerous examples of these alliances can be found in the 
automotive, electronics, telecommunications, and aircraft industries. Such alliances are par￾ticularly suited to capital-intensive and high-technology industries where the cost of research 
and development is high and timely introduction of improvements is important.
Foreign investment, however, is not always a purely enterprise-based concept. As de￾scribed in Global Finance in Practice 17.2, the largest global investment in terms of total capi￾tal has been that under the auspices of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
17.3 Political Risk: Definition and Classification
Political risk is the possibility that political events in a particular country or involving that 
country through international law will influence the economic well-being of a firm oper￾ating in that country. Multinational firms need to anticipate and manage political risk. In 
order to do that, the firm must understand the differing types of risks and their likelihood of 
occurrence.
The political risks facing a multinational firm can be categorized as firm-specific or 
country-specific, both occurring within a global context—global-specific risks—as described 
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 539 10/07/23 4:38 PM540 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis

diplomacy” to entrap developing countries with debt, leaving 
them with little choice but to follow China’s political directives.
The debt-trap criticism has been the subject of much 
debate. Host countries have enjoyed massive capital proj￾ects and investments sponsored and supported by Chinese 
capital and capabilities but are often saddled with legacies 
of debt obligations and operating entanglements far into the 
future.
The BRI Project Development Path
BRI projects follow a fundamentally distinct and different 
development process than traditional infrastructure proj￾ects. This difference, detailed in the exhibit, arises from 
the dominant role of the Chinese government, its banks, 
and its engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) 
firms, in project development. Because the BRI’s activities 
are largely infrastructure investments, they are not invest￾ments—in principle—for profit. These types of projects are 
developed for the public good rather than private gain since 
they are traditionally investments made by governments or 
multilateral development organizations like the World Bank. 
Projects are typically identified by a government itself or in 
consultation with a multilateral development bank. Once 
approved, they are funded largely through development 
bank loans.
The Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and 
Debt-Trap Diplomacy
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), formally launched by the 
Chinese government, is the largest agglomeration of global 
investments in the developing world in history. Under the aus￾pices of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), this collection 
of Chinese organizations has negotiated the development of 
infrastructure projects in more than 60 countries. The BRI 
has two parts, the belt—which theoretically recreates the old 
Silk Road land trade route, and the road—a patchwork water 
route across oceans.
The BRI has focused on infrastructure projects includ￾ing dams, roads, ports, power plants, airports, and hospitals. 
These projects clearly increase Chinese national and corpo￾rate interests across the developing world. But the true scope 
of Chinese capital in this space is difficult to measure and 
complex in form. Despite essentially all BRI projects being 
state-sponsored, there is no ready disclosure of the invest￾ments and loans across countries. Adding to that complexity 
is that each project is unique in scope and scale, requiring 
differing forms of capital commitments and arrangements. 
Yet the BRI continues to be highly controversial, labeled ev￾erything from “man’s largest concerted effort for global co￾operative economic development” to China using “debt-trap

in Exhibit 17.3. Also note that as opposed to the traditional theoretical definition of risk in 
finance, where it is often defined statistically such as the standard deviation of returns over 
time, our definitions and classification of political risks are one-sided. Political risks are al￾ways seen as negative in their impact on the operations and prospects of the multinational 
firm.
Firm-Specific Risks. Firm-specific risks, also known as micro risks, are those that affect 
the multinational at the project or corporate level. These firm-specific risks can be further 
subdivided into those risks arising from the national government and its possible interven￾tion in legal contracts, government risks, and the possible impacts of other external interests 
like sabotage or boycotts, instability risks. The most frequently experienced government risks 
are breach of contract, regulatory changes, and expropriation (particularly creeping expro￾priation, explained further below).
All nations, highly industrialized and emerging markets alike, experience regulatory 
changes over time. That is inevitable and is to be expected by a multinational firm operat￾ing in a national environment. But when those regulatory changes single out the MNE’s 
activities, treating it differently compared to similar firms in the domestic market, the mul￾tinational is clearly suffering discriminatory treatment. As will be described in detail later 
in this chapter, multinational firms actively work to mitigate these risks, in both prevention 
and treatment.
Country-Specific Risks. Country-specific risks, also known as macro risks, are those that 
affect the MNE at the project or corporate level but originate at the country level. As was the 
case with firm-specific risks, these two can be further subdivided into government risks and 
instability risks.
The most frequently seen government risks are expropriation (nationalization when expe￾rienced on a country level), regulatory changes, and fund transfer restrictions (blocked funds). 
Instability risks on a country level include mass labor movements or strikes, civil unrest, and 
near war-like conditions. Examples of these are, unfortunately, too long and too easy to list.

Global-Specific Risks. Global specific risks are those that can impact both domestic and 
multinational enterprises at the project or corporate level but originate at the global level. 
Examples are terrorism, the anti-globalization movement, environmental concerns, poverty, 
and cyberattacks. Although originating at the regional or global level, the impacts are felt at 
the domestic level, and that is where we will focus our discussion.
At the macro level, firms attempt to assess a host country’s political stability and atti￾tude toward foreign investors. At the micro level, firms analyze whether their firm-specific 
activities are likely to conflict with host country goals as evidenced by existing regulations. 
The most difficult task, however, is to anticipate changes in host country goal priorities, new 
regulations to implement reordered priorities, and the likely impact of such changes on the 
firm’s operations.
One final note bears highlighting before proceeding. Political risks such as war, civil un￾rest, and politically motivated acts of violence—including terrorism—clearly constitute enor￾mous risks to all people and organizations anywhere. The seriousness of these risks always 
supersedes our subset of business-based political risks. Protecting the health and safety of 
workers, no matter citizenship or employer, should always be considered to be the highest of 
priorities. Regardless of the sanctity of profits, there are higher causes.
17.4 Financial Impacts of Political Risk
The financial impacts on the multinational firm of political change in foreign countries cov￾ers the full gamut of business finance—from earnings to operating cash flow to asset owner￾ship. On a purely elemental level, these risks change both how multinational firms operate 
in a host country and, more importantly, their willingness to continue to invest—or, in the 
extreme, invest at all. This section focuses on the various micro or firm-based political risks 
directly linked to the conduct of business, by a business, in a host country.
Exhibit 17.4 provides a brief overview of these financial impacts ranging from low to high 
in financial severity. Although expropriation—the taking of private assets for public purposes 
by the state—has historically been the most “feared” of political risks, it is still relatively in￾frequent. The more common form today is the creeping expropriation, where a government 
imposes a variety of the various forms of commercial interference described in Categories 1 
and 2, eventually culminating in an effective expropriation. It is, in fact, the multitude of poli￾cies and regulations in the first two categories of political risks that have the most common 
and often somewhat insidious impact on financial performance.
The specific financial costs and losses associated with a variety of the causes in Exhibit 
17.4, however, are not always so neat. A breach of contract for a multinational construction 
management firm developing infrastructure facilities in Mozambique, a Category 1 risk, could 
prove more costly than any specific state seizure of the multinational’s property or assets, a 
Category 3 risk. As we dig deeper into the variety of risks, it will become increasingly obvious 
how they are often intertwined in incidence.
Category 1: Losses in Operating Profitability
The most common political risks that multinationals face are changes in the various regula￾tions, restrictions, and requirements for operating in the host country. The two most often 
cited causes of financial harm according to MNEs are breach of contract and adverse regula￾tory changes.
Financial harm typically comes in the form of lost business and sales opportuni￾ties, discriminatory treatment—being treated differently than other domestic or foreign 
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 542 10/07/23 4:38 PMCHAPTER 17 Foreign Direct Investment and Political Risk 543
competitors—required staffing or procurement practices in the host country, and broken 
promises as a whole. Since most multinational firms see political risk arising primarily in 
emerging markets or low-income countries, the risks tend to align with or accompany spe￾cific sectors, such as infrastructure development and major natural resource development 
projects. Both sectors, infrastructure construction and natural resource development, are 
now suffering disruptive change following years of privatization. These businesses are often 
public-private collaborations, a characteristic common in the developing world where the 
state has historically owned industries and assets, but less so in the industrial country markets 
that many multinationals call home.
Adverse Regulatory Change. Adverse regulatory change, also termed regulatory risk, re￾fers to changes in host country regulations that alter operating conditions of investments. As 
noted, we refer to “adverse” changes, as few multinationals enjoy changes that reduce cost or 
operating requirements once the investment has been made and the investor has lost much of 
its negotiating strength. There are few limits to the nature of these regulation changes, though 
many in the past decade have fallen in the environmental, human health, and local content/
sourcing areas.
Breach of Contract. Breach of contract refers to losses arising from a government or 
state-owned enterprise breaking or breaching of a business contract with the foreign private 
investor.
A frequently cited cause of harm is either a change in host country law or a failure to com￾ply with principles of the rule of law. And as opposed to projects and investments in the 1960s 
or 1970s, host government entities today are often quite sophisticated in their ability to navi￾gate these legal changes and environments. They are also no longer in the weaker negotiating

EXHIBIT 17.4 Categorizing Potential Finance Losses and Political Risk
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 543 10/07/23 4:38 PM544 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
position common 50 years ago. Today host country governments are well aware of their ability 
to demand balanced contracts that share both the risks and returns of business ventures.
A short list of deal-specific issues leading to breach of contract would include the follow￾ing: (1) how the contract was awarded, bid or no-bid; (2) what contractual payment structure 
is used, cost-plus, fixed price, or other; and (3) whether the contract is still relevant, the obso￾lescing bargain principle. Political risk studies in recent years have found that the probabil￾ity of a material contract breach increases rapidly with contract and business maturity. The 
obsolescing bargain premise is that with time, business and social and political forces change, 
undermining the relevancy of the contract and business. Other forces also contribute to this 
obsolescence, including the deterioration of foundational relationships (the “connections” 
that gave rise to the contract) and shifts in negotiating strength (host countries gain relative 
bargaining strength after the foreign investor has put bricks and mortar and capital on the 
ground).
Local Content Requirements. Host governments may require foreign firms to purchase 
raw material and components locally as a way to maximize value-added benefits and to in￾crease local employment. From the viewpoint of the foreign firm trying to adapt to host coun￾try goals, local sourcing reduces political risk, albeit at a trade-off with other factors. Local 
strikes or other turmoil may shut down the operation and such issues as quality control, high 
local prices, and unreliable delivery schedules become important. Often, through local sourc￾ing, the MNE lowers political risk only by increasing its financial and commercial risk.
Category 2: Transfer and Convertibility Risk
Transfer and convertibility risk, often abbreviated in industry to T&C risk, is the risk that 
a host country will restrict the ability of the multinational firm to move money in or out of 
the country—transfer risk—and possibly restrict its ability to exchange local currency for 
foreign currency—convertibility risk—in an expeditious manner. This restriction of access 
and exchange is referred to as blocked funds. T&C risk can be extremely costly for some 
multinationals, as delayed payments may result in financial charges, penalties, exchange rate 
losses, and, in some cases, insolvency. Financial impacts need not be confined to the foreign 
subsidiary itself, as in some cases sister affiliates or even the parent company may be in criti￾cal need for expected cash flow transfers.
In theory, these limitations do not necessarily discriminate against foreign-owned firms 
because they apply to everyone; in practice, however, foreign firms have more at stake be￾cause of their foreign ownership. Depending on the size of a foreign exchange shortage, the 
host government might simply require approval of all transfers of funds abroad, thus reserv￾ing the right to set a priority on the use of scarce foreign exchange. In very severe cases, 
the government might make its currency nonconvertible into other currencies, thereby fully 
blocking transfers of funds abroad. In between these positions are policies that restrict the 
size and timing of dividends, debt amortization, royalties, and service fees.
Many countries have been known to restrict convertibility in an effort to stop capital 
flight and the depletion of foreign exchange reserves (when attempting to maintain a fixed 
exchange rate regime in the face of pessimistic expectations). Both Argentina and Venezuela 
are examples of countries that have in recent years allowed conversion of local currency to 
hard currency, typically to the U.S. dollar, but only to approved parties for specific transac￾tions (e.g., a toy importer requesting approval for payment to a Chinese exporter for a spe￾cific purchase, an invoice for a toy purchase). These approvals rarely include multinational 
firms operating in-country. Sovereign debt obligations, often requiring payment in a hard 
currency earned only through export, also sometimes drive governments to withhold access 
by private investors to foreign exchange.
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 544 10/07/23 4:38 PMCHAPTER 17 Foreign Direct Investment and Political Risk 545
Category 3: Expropriation and Nationalization
Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be 
diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized 
some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power. 
But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits or the contract and due process 
clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the 
diminution. When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not in all cases there must be an 
exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act.
—Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon et al., No. 549, Decided 
December 11, 1922 [260 U.S. 393].
The most extreme form of political risk is expropriation, the seizure of the multinational 
company’s business, assets, or license to operate in the country by the government—the pub￾lic taking of private assets. Technically, if the seizure or transfer of ownership is made on 
a statewide or industry-wide basis and not a singular or specific firm, the action is termed 
nationalization (the “evil twin” of expropriation).
The state, any state, has the sovereign right under international law to take property held 
by private entities, domestic or foreign, through expropriation for economic, political, or so￾cial reasons. (The taking of domestic property is referred to as eminent domain.) But in order 
to be “lawful” under international law, the expropriation needs to meet four criteria:3
1. Property has to be taken for a public purpose
2. On a nondiscriminatory basis
3. In accordance with due process of law
4. Accompanied by compensation
Direct versus Indirect. Direct expropriation is the transfer of title or outright seizure of 
property. This was the customary form of expropriation seen in the early twentieth century 
in countries like Russia and Mexico. Property was seen as purely physical in nature and in￾cluded land, buildings, capital equipment, and other physical assets in addition to any ongoing 
business activity. Worldwide attention to and criticism of these unilateral actions were severe.
In the era beginning after World War II, partially in response to widespread criticism of 
direct expropriation, some nations began using a variety of other measures of commercial 
interference (many of those described in the previous categories) that incrementally and cu￾mulatively begin to permanently destroy the economic value of the investment. These mea￾sures typically revolve around the ability of the investor to manage or control the business or 
property in a meaningful manner and are collectively termed indirect expropriation. At the 
same time the definition of property was expanded from physical to include “non-corporal” 
or intangible property, specifically rights held by the investor that possess monetary value.
An additional form of indirect expropriation is creeping expropriation, when a vari￾ety of seemingly small or individual restrictions and interventions are considered in sum. 
This includes increased regulations, confiscatory taxes, limits on the repatriation of currency, 
changes in exchange rates, and forced renegotiation of licenses or contracts. This has led to 
considerable debate in both the courts and boardrooms around the globe as nations have 
argued that these individual actions do not constitute “takings” yet multinationals argue that 
considered in total they are effective seizures. In some instances the largest loss in value to

the multinational investor is when the host government imposes so many restrictions or costs 
upon the venture without expropriation that the investment is a loss without compensation.
There is also a vaguely defined third category of material interference by the state that 
is based on the state’s right to regulate in the public interest. Nations argue that when they 
intervene in this manner, in their sovereign role of policing, they are not required to compen￾sate investors for their losses. Of course in the eyes of many multinational investors, these are 
still forms of indirect expropriation.
Compensation. A “lawful expropriation” must be accompanied by compensation. Most 
international investment agreements require compensation that meets three conditions: 
prompt—paid without delay, adequate—a value with a reasonable relationship with a market 
value of the investment, and effective—paid in a convertible or freely useable currency.
What is adequate or appropriate compensation is a highly contentious debate depending 
on the case and whether the party is the company or country. There are three basic valuation 
approaches used globally for determining compensation that any student of finance will rec￾ognize: (1) market valuation, (2) net book valuation, and (3) net present value of discounted 
cash flow valuation. Although different treaties and agreements use differing terminologies 
of what compensation is to be paid—“fair value” or “just” or “appropriate” or “what a willing 
buyer would pay to a willing seller”—many governments frequently pay less than what most 
valuations call for.
The largest arbitration award resulting from an illegal expropriation of assets of all time 
is that of OAO Yukos Oil Company, the Russian oil and gas company seized by the Russian 
Federation in 2007. In 2014 a tribunal awarded the former shareholders of Yukos, which 
was at the time of expropriation the largest oil company in Russia, more than $50 billion. 
Interestingly, this was the amount after it had been reduced by 25% as a result of the tribu￾nal’s assessment that the claimants themselves (the stockholders) also had “unclean hands.” 
Global Finance in Practice 17.3 provides a number of examples of how one of the world’s 
largest and most global of industries, oil and gas development, has been the subject of fre￾quent expropriations, particularly in Latin America. Note also how host governments have 
employed a number of interference instruments and strategies of their own to execute a 
creeping expropriation in some cases.
17.5 Political Risk Mitigation
Despite more than two decades of high-speed globalization, all indications are that political 
risk is rising. That challenge combined with multinational firms that grow more risk-averse 
every day has fueled efforts of political risk mitigation. More multinational enterprises than 
ever before actively monitor political risk threats in an effort to protect their people, their 
assets, and their business brand/reputation. They are also taking more proactive steps earlier 
in the foreign direct investment process to reduce and manage their own exposure. Here 
we explore seven of the most common political risk mitigation techniques: stakeholder en￾gagement, use of domestic partners, international investment agreements, gradual investing, 
blocked funds management, dispute resolution, and political risk insurance.
Stakeholder Engagement
Prior and early engagement with key FDI stakeholders—host governments, key political 
leaders, and impacted communities—is often seen as “an ounce of prevention.” The most fre￾quently cited risk mitigation strategy by multinationals, developing and nurturing relationships 
with key host country stakeholders, is seen as a way to both prevent individual firm exposure

GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 17.3
India had a nationalized Banking Industry for most part 
of the four decades after its independence since 1945. 
However, in 1991 India shifted the direction of its eco￾nomic policy and allowed private sector and foreign capi￾tal participation in several industries including financial 
services and airlines. This resulted into several private 
banks entering India, financed by both investors in India 
and abroad. India has privatized several industries and 
have very actively pursuing a policy to privatize railways, 
mining, airline, and even several public services—a com￾pletely opposite direction for the policy from where it was 
a few decades ago. 
United Kingdom. The history of nationalization and 
privatization of assets is a very interesting one in United 
Kingdom. It started way back in 1850s when the United 
Kingdom nationalized the East India Company because 
of political unrest in India in 1858. Since then, the govern￾ment has nationalized railways, airlines, banks, and public 
utility companies. In 2008, the government decided to na￾tionalize several banks to save them from going bankrupt. 
A few times the government also decided to nationalize 
specific businesses that were critical for national security. 
Rolls Royce’s aero engine division in 1971 and Sheffield 
Forgemasters in 2021 are example of such nationalizations. 
However, more recently government has started to priva￾tize public services. Royal Mail, parts of railways, some 
banks, and several water companies have been priva￾tized by transferring them back to private ownership in the 
United Kingdom over the last decade or so.
In all the examples presented above, it was only the Sri 
Lankan authorities that expropriated the assets of private 
owners more than once with no or very inadequate compen￾sation. In all other cases the owners/shareholders of national￾ized entities were compensated adequately. 
Selective Examples of Expropriation and 
Nationalization across the Globe
Governments across the world have used expropriation and 
nationalization of private companies and assets for various 
reasons. Some key factors to determine the chances of both 
expropriation and nationalization include a dominant political 
philosophy, status of the organization, and their importance 
to provide a critical service of product to the country. The fol￾lowing are a few historical examples that provide a balanced 
picture of political risk across the globe.
Sri Lanka. The history of Sri Lanka’s policy started way 
back in 1957 when they nationalized the air and naval air 
bases and decreed the British Air Force and British Navy to 
hand them over to Sri Lankan authorities. Immediately after 
this, the authorities nationalized the bus transport in 1958, 
the Bank of Ceylon in 1961, and then the whole of Insurance 
Industry by creating Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. It is 
important to note that these businesses were owned mostly 
by foreign capital who were made to hand over their owner￾ship to the Sri Lankan authorities. This was then followed 
by nationalization of Oil companies, mines, plantations, and 
even newspapers. The reason behind these nationalizations 
was mainly to ensure a widespread coverage of provision 
of goods and services provided by these businesses. The 
same policy approach continued when they passed an 
Expropriation Act in 2011 to take over assets of 37 different 
companies. This was unprecedented and created significant 
issues for Sri Lanka to attract foreign capital. The govern￾ment finally repelled it in 2018.
India. India, like most of the newly independent 
countries in commonwealth also went on a nationaliza￾tion spree and nationalized Banks, Airlines, Insurance 
Companies, and Coal mines between 1940s and 1970s. 
and to serve as an early warning device for trouble. Possibly the most critical of stakeholders 
is the host country government. Recent studies have shown that greater government involve￾ment is associated with the business venture’s high likelihood to survive a breach event.
Use of Domestic Partners
Either as a result of true public policy or preferential domestic politics, all host country gov￾ernments would prefer that new capital projects and business developments in country be 
undertaken by domestic companies. If, however, the business initiative is coming via a for￾eign multinational, if that firm partners with in-country interests, the goals of the country are 
partially met. Domestic partners, once having a formal business interest in the project, act as 
both a champion and a potential “shield” in potentially preventing government from imple￾menting additional interference in the conduct of the business.
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 547 10/07/23 4:38 PM548 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
Many governments have in the past required a domestic equity partner—requiring in ef￾fect a joint venture with a domestic company—as an explicit requirement for entry. This was 
the case in all pillar industries in mainland China in the 1980s and 1990s. A specific intention 
is that by working in collaboration, much of the multinational firm’s experience, knowledge, 
and technology will also pass to the domestic partner.
International Investment Agreements
The best way to mitigate political risk is to anticipate the risks, negotiate a priori agreement 
with host country authorities—international investment agreements (IIAs)—and, in addi￾tion, be prepared. Different cultures apply different ethics to the question of honoring con￾tracts, especially when they were negotiated with a previous administration. Nevertheless, 
prenegotiation of all conceivable areas of conflict provides a better basis for a successful 
future for both parties than does overlooking the possibility that divergent objectives will 
evolve over time.
Prenegotiation often includes negotiating IIAs, buying investment insurance and guaran￾tees, and designing risk-reducing operating strategies to be used after the foreign investment 
decision has been made. An IIA spells out specific rights and responsibilities of both the for￾eign firm and the host government. In many cases the operating presence of specific multina￾tionals not only is desired by the country but may be actively “recruited” or requested by the 
government to bid for entry. All parties have alternatives and so bargaining is appropriate.
Today most IIAs begin with a standard clause to assert the four criteria defined previ￾ously in regard to expropriation:
Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly, measures of 
expropriation, nationalization or any other measures having the same nature or the same 
effect against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, unless the measures 
are taken in the public benefit, on a non-discriminatory basis, and under due process of law, 
and provided that provisions be made for effective and adequate compensation.
—Agreement between Swiss Confederation and Republic of Chile on the promotion and reciprocal 
protection of Investments, UNCTAD, 1999.
These criteria and similar legal clauses have been widely used for the past century in an 
attempt to find some balance between investor protection and state sovereignty. Other stan￾dard components of an IIA include the following financial and management issues:
■ The basis on which dividends, management fees, royalties, and loan repayments may be 
remitted
■ The basis for setting transfer prices
■ The right to export to third-country markets
■ Obligations to fund, build, or support social infrastructure such as schools and hospitals
■ Methods of taxation, including the rate, type, and means by which the rate base is 
determined
■ Access to host country capital markets, particularly for long-term borrowing
■ Permission for 100% foreign ownership versus required local ownership (joint venture) 
participation
■ Price controls, if any, applicable to sales in the host country markets
■ Requirements for local sourcing versus import of raw materials and components
■ Permission to use expatriate managerial and technical personnel with limited 
intervention or charges
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 548 10/07/23 4:38 PMCHAPTER 17 Foreign Direct Investment and Political Risk 549
■ Provision for arbitration of disputes
■ Provision for planned divestment, should such be required, describing an exit or 
windup process
Although political changes can and may render existing agreements null and void on 
occasion, a carefully negotiated IIA prior to entry has been shown to consistently increase 
the probability of a longer and healthier business venture. Global Finance in Practice 17.4
describes how international sanctions against Iran have largely taken all choices away from 
multinational enterprises of all countries.
Gradual Investing
A multinational firm entering a problematic country may choose to follow a “prudent invest￾ment” policy. This is often applicable to a country that either has a history of significant inter￾vention in the activities of foreign investors, for example a history of expropriation, or has a 
current governance regime that does not instill confidence in the investor’s ability to operate 
for any term without intervention. A prudent investment policy invests capital in stages, often 
starting with only core activities on a smaller scale than what the long-term investment objec￾tive calls for. The multinational will then, assuming limited interference, rely primarily upon 
retained earnings from the business itself for additional capital and expansion.
This gradual investment approach is, however, often not well received by host countries, 
and in the case of the business being a joint venture with a domestic private or public insti￾tution (such as a state owned enterprise), this can lead to significant friction between the 
partners over time. The mini-case at the end of this chapter illustrates one example in which 
gradual investment proved a double-edged sword in protecting the rights and investment of 
the foreign firm.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 17.4
1979, in October 2020 the U.S. imposed new sanctions that 
specifically targeted Iran’s financial sector.
These most recent sanctions prohibit all U.S. financial 
institutions from conducting business with 18 Iranian banks 
and also impose penalties on any businesses or financial 
institutions from third-party countries for conducting any 
business with them. Previously the U.S. had focused its fi￾nancial sanctions on the Iranian Central Bank and any third￾party banks conducting business with it. The Iranian Central 
Bank maintains accounts with banks and central banks all 
over the world, partly for the settlement of international finan￾cial and exchange rate settlements but also for settlement 
of payments for Iranian oil exports. U.S. sanctions against 
the Iranian Central Bank were intended to shut down most 
Iranian oil exports.
The 2020 sanctions are believed to effectively cut off 
most of the Iranian economy from the international financial 
system. European nations have opposed the U.S. “blanket 
sanction” against financial activities, as a number of European 
and European Union members continue to maintain an open 
relationship with Iran.
U.S. Financial Sanctions On Iran
Sanctions are used by nations and multilateral organizations for 
a variety of purposes. Economic, political, and military sanc￾tions are by far the most serious, although sports sanctions 
and environmental sanctions have gained substantial notoriety 
in recent years. Trade sanctions, the imposition of tariffs, quo￾tas, or other commercial trade restrictions are considered a 
subcategory of economic sanctions. The primary motivations 
for sanctions are to force adherence to international law and to 
contain perceived threats to peace in a region. That motivation 
is specific to the United Nations Security Council’s condemna￾tion of actions of a specific member nation.
A series of successive U.S. administrations have used 
economic sanctions to try to alter Iran’s purported sup￾port of regional armed factions and conflicts as well as its 
development of missiles and nuclear arms. U.S. sanctions 
against Iran are classified as secondary sanctions, applying 
to any organization attempting to conduct business with Iran. 
Although U.S. sanctions in some form have been in effect 
against Iran since its seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 549 10/07/23 4:38 PM550 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
Blocked Funds Management
Multinational firms can react to the potential for blocked funds at three stages:
1. Prior to investing, a firm can analyze the effect of blocked funds on expected return on 
investment, the desired local financial structure, and optimal links with subsidiaries.
2. During operations, a firm can attempt to move funds through a variety of repositioning 
techniques.
3. Funds that cannot be moved must be reinvested in the local country in a manner that 
avoids deterioration in their real value because of inflation or local currency depreciation.
The first management alternative, including the likelihood of blocked funds in the capital 
budgeting process, results in a lower expected net present value and would often eliminate 
the proposal as an acceptable investment. If after inclusion the project is still considered ac￾ceptable, preinvestment analysis allows the potential to minimize the impact of blocked funds 
by financing strategies such as use of local borrowing (in-country) instead of parent equity, 
swap agreements (back-to-back loans are one example), and other techniques to reduce local 
currency exposure.
The second management alternative is the use of any number of techniques to move 
blocked funds after operations begin. This includes fronting loans and the creation of un￾related exports. A fronting loan is a parent-to-subsidiary loan channeled through a finan￾cial intermediary, usually a large international bank. Fronting loans differ from “parallel” or 
“back-to-back” loans discussed in Chapter 12. The latter are offsetting loans between com￾mercial businesses arranged outside the banking system. Fronting loans are sometimes re￾ferred to as link financing. In a fronting loan, the “lending” parent or subsidiary deposits 
funds in, say, a London bank, and that bank loans the same amount to the borrowing subsid￾iary in the host country. From the London bank’s point of view, the loan is risk-free because 
the bank has 100% collateral in the form of the parent’s deposit. In effect, the bank “fronts” 
for the parent—hence the name.
Another approach to blocked funds that benefits both the subsidiary and host country is 
the creation of unrelated exports. Because the main reason for stringent exchange controls is 
usually a host country’s persistent inability to earn hard currencies, anything a multinational 
firm can do to create new exports from the host country is considered helpful and provides a 
potential means to transfer funds out. Some new exports can often be created from present 
productive capacity with little or no additional investment, especially if they are in prod￾uct lines related to existing operations. Other new exports may require reinvestment or new 
funds, although if the funds reinvested consist of those already blocked, little is lost in the way 
of opportunity costs.
If funds are indeed blocked from transfer into foreign exchange, they are by definition 
“reinvested.” Under such a situation, the firm must find local opportunities that will maxi￾mize the rate of return for a given acceptable level of risk. If blockage is expected to be tem￾porary, the most obvious alternative is to invest in local money market instruments.
Unfortunately, in many countries, such instruments are not available in sufficient quan￾tity or with adequate liquidity. In some cases, government Treasury bills, bank deposits, and 
other short-term instruments have yields that are kept artificially low relative to local rates of 
inflation or probable changes in exchange rates. Thus, the firm often loses real value during 
the period of blockage. Investment in additional production facilities may in some cases be 
the only alternative. Often, this investment is what the host country is seeking by its exchange 
controls, even if exchange controls is counterproductive to additional foreign investment.
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 550 10/07/23 4:38 PMCHAPTER 17 Foreign Direct Investment and Political Risk 551
Dispute Resolution
A multinational firm knows, prior to investing in any specific country, that it will bear the 
risk that its contracts or agreements will not be enforceable by the host country court and 
judicial system. A common mitigation strategy is therefore to require all disputes to go to 
international arbitration. There are a number of established bodies solely for this purpose—
the American Arbitration Association, the International Chamber of Commerce, the London 
Court of International Arbitration, to name a few.
International arbitration is also facilitated as a result of more than 100 countries being 
signatories to the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 
a program run by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNICTRAL). 
A second approach of value to multinationals is to contractually require all disputes to be 
resolved according to the rules of the International Center of the Settlement of Disputes 
(ICSID). About 130 countries have signed the ICSID Convention on the Settlement of 
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States. One key outcome of either 
of these strategies is that signatory countries agree to enforce arbitration awards. Therefore a 
monetary judgment awarded via international arbitration may be more likely to be collected.
Political Risk Insurance
Political risk insurance, as it sounds, is insurance acquired by the multinational to serve as some 
financial protection against losses arising from select forms of political risk. Governmental 
and private insurers offer policies designed to manage political risks, including the risk of ex￾propriation and nationalization. Many countries have governmental or quasi-governmental 
entities that provide political risk insurance for companies from that country when investing 
internationally.
Providers. Most political risk insurance is provided—written—by members of the Berne 
Union, the International Union of Credit & Investment Insurers, an international organization 
of export credit agencies made up of multilateral trade groups and private insurers. Founded 
in 1934, its first meetings were held in Berne, Switzerland; it is estimated that 10% of all world 
trade is covered by Berne Union members. Those members are both public and private. For 
example, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), an agency of the World 
Bank Group, “promotes foreign direct investment by providing political risk insurance and 
credit enhancement to investors and lenders against losses caused by noncommercial risks.”
An additional benefit of MIGA is that recent studies indicate that the greater the par￾ticipation of an international financial institution (IFI) like the World Bank, such as credit 
provisions, project guarantees, or equity participation, the greater the likelihood of project or 
business success. There are a multitude of other country-based insurance providers:
■ Australia: Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EXIC)
■ Canada: Export Development Canada (EDC)
■ France: Compagnie Franc arise d’Assurance pour le Commerce Extevieure (COFACE)
■ Germany: German State Export Guarantee Scheme, managed by HERMES
■ Japan: Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI)
■ United States: Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)
■ United Kingdom: Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD)
There are also several semi-governmental organizations that offer political risk insur￾ance like the U.S. Export/Import Bank as well as private insurers like Chubb and Zurich. 
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 551 10/07/23 4:38 PM552 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
Multinational Use. MNEs can also sometimes transfer political risk to a host country pub￾lic agency through an investment insurance and guarantee program. Many developed coun￾tries have such programs to protect investments by their nationals in developing countries.
For example, in the United States, the investment insurance and guarantee program is 
managed by the government-owned Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). An 
OPIC’s purpose is to mobilize and facilitate the participation of U.S. private capital and skills 
in the economic and social progress of less-developed friendly countries and areas, thereby 
complementing the developmental assistance of the United States. An OPIC offers insurance 
coverage for four separate types of political risk, which have their own specific definitions 
for insurance purposes including: (1) business income coverage from asset damage resulting 
from political violence; (2) inconvertibility of profits, royalties, fees, or other income into U.S. 
dollars; (3) expropriation; and (4) losses of physical property values resulting from war, revo￾lution, insurrection, and civil strife. Depending on the nature of the project, OPIC will insure 
up to $400 million of an individual project.
Foreign direct investment and political risk are inevitably intertwined, but with considerable 
preparation and planning, the multinational may be able to navigate often very difficult and 
contentious political environments. And as illustrated in Global Finance in Practice 17.5, the rela￾tionship between the multinational enterprise and a host country need not always be adversarial.

16% to bring its total ownership to 51% (35% + 16%), 
but that had changed.
3. Inclusion of a five-year put option to the Indonesian gov￾ernment to sell its remaining shares to Cemex at a base 
price of $1.38/share plus an 8.2% annual premium.
4. A one-off payment of $130 million to the Indonesian 
government in 2006 if Semen Gresik’s performance, 
as measured by earnings before interest and taxes 
(EBIT), surpassed specific hurdles in the coming 
years.
5. A contribution of approximately $50  million to the on￾going port facilities upgrade and capacity expansion of 
Semen Gresik.
Of course this was a lot more intricate than what the 
Indonesian government had envisioned as a “bid.” Years 
later, the author had a chance to discuss the bidding strat￾egy with the chief negotiator for the Cemex team, Mr. Javier 
Boffarull. The first component constituted a minimum bid—a 
price, and one with a significant premium. The second ele￾ment was a clear message to the Indonesian government of 
Cemex’s commitment and intentions—to gain greater inter￾est and possibly control. The third element, the put option, 
was to make it very clear that if in the future the government 
needed to liquidate more shares for capital, it had a mini￾mum guaranteed income already on the table. Fourth, the 
one-off payment, was an incentive for the government to not 
take any actions post-sale that would prevent Cemex from 
expanding the profitability of the business. This was a lesson 
Cemex had learned the hard way in a number of acquisitions 
in a number of countries over the years. Cemex also knew 
Structuring Incentives in Foreign Direct 
Investments
Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex) is one of the leading firms in 
the world in its industry. It has made dozens of acquisitions in 
a multitude of countries. So when it constructed its bid for PT 
Semen Gresik of Indonesia in 1998, it knew what it was getting 
into. The Indonesian government was under pressure to priva￾tize, largely by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), following 
the Asian Crisis. PT Semen Gresik was a crown jewel, a large, 
new, state-of-the-art set of cement manufacturing facilities.
The Indonesian government owned 65%, with the other 
35% free float (traded on the Jakarta Stock Exchange). At 
first the government said it would sell 35% of the total to the 
highest bidder, but after management and workers alike took 
to the streets to oppose the sale, the government backed 
down to selling only 14%. Now Cemex could, at best, gain a 
minority interest of 49%.
So when Cemex constructed its final bid, it put together 
a set of pieces that were intended to provide a series of in￾centives for the government of Indonesia to work with the 
company in expanding the business post-sale. The bid had 
five elements:
1. Share price bid. A bid of $1.38/share for 35% of 
Semen Gresik held by the Indonesian govern￾ment. Given a current share price of Rp 9,150
($0.63/share at Rp14,500 = $1.00), this represented 
nearly a 100% premium.
2. An announced intention to purchase additional shares 
on the open market. Originally this had been stated at

Summary Points
■ The strategic decision to undertake foreign direct in￾vestment (FDI) by a multinational firm is an expan￾sion of its global strategy.
■ The OLI Paradigm is an attempt to create an overall 
framework to explain why multinational enterprises 
(MNEs) choose FDI rather than choosing to serve 
foreign markets through alternative modes, such as 
licensing, joint ventures, strategic alliances, manage￾ment contracts, and exporting.
■ A multinational firm’s decision to invest abroad is fol￾lowed by choosing markets to enter and choosing the 
business forms and structures by which to enter those 
markets. Ultimately, the choice of both target markets 
and entry structures will establish what types of politi￾cal risk and exposure the firm then faces.
■ The financial risks borne by multinational firms in en￾tering foreign markets are separable into three catego￾ries: operating results, transfer risk, and expropriation 
risks.
■ Political risks can be defined on three levels: firm￾specific, country-specific, or global-specific.
■ The seven most common political risk mitigation 
techniques are stakeholder engagement, use of do￾mestic partners, international investment agreements, 
gradual investing, blocked funds management, dispute 
resolution, and political risk insurance.
By including all five elements in the bid, Cemex gave 
the Indonesian government every opportunity—before the 
sale—to state any opposition to the plan. The Indonesian 
government did not have any opposition—Cemex won 
the bid and gained its minority interest. As the saying 
goes, it is sometimes more useful to use carrots rather 
than sticks.
from experience that regardless of what percentage owner￾ship it gained, 25%, 49%, 65%, it would never have complete 
control of a company so large and so important to Indonesia. 
The fifth and final element, a major capital contribution to￾ward infrastructure and expansion, was an added entice￾ment for the government itself to continue to invest in the 
industry itself.

Argentina and the Vulture Funds4
Argentina’s default on its foreign-currency-denominated 
sovereign debt in 2001 had proved to be a never-ending 
nightmare. Now, in June 2014, 13 years after the default, 
the U.S. Supreme Court had confirmed a lower-court rul￾ing that would force Argentina to consider defaulting on its 
international debt obligations once again. But the story was 
a tangled one, which included investors all over the world, 
international financial law, courts in New York State and 
the European Union, and a battle between hedge funds and 
so-called vulture funds—funds that purchased distressed 
sovereign debt at low prices and then pursued full repay￾ment through litigation. Time was running out.
The Default
Argentina’s currency and economy had nearly collapsed in 
1999. The rising sovereign debt obligations of the Argentine 
government, debt denominated in U.S. dollars and European 
euros, could not be serviced by the faltering economy. In late 
December 2001, Argentina officially defaulted on its foreign 
debt: $81.8 billion in private debt, $6.3 billion to the Paris 
Club, and $9.5 billion to the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF).
The debt had been originally issued in 1994 and regis￾tered under New York State governing law. New York law 
was specifically chosen because Argentina had become 
known as a serial defaulter. The bonds were issued under a 
specific structure, a Fiscal Agency Agreement (hence FAA 
Bonds), which would require all debt service to be made 
through escrow accounts in New York.
The normal process following default is for the debtor 
to enter into talks with its creditors to restructure its debt 
obligations. Reaching consensus on sovereign debt restruc￾turing, however, can be difficult because there is no inter￾national statutory regime for sovereign default similar to 
domestic bankruptcy codes. This leaves three options: (1) 
a collective solution, (2) a voluntary exchange of old debt 
for restructured obligations, or (3) litigation.

M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 553 10/07/23 4:38 PM554 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
The first option, the collective solution, is usually ac￾complished via the use of collective action clauses (CCAs) 
that impose similar reorganization terms on all creditors 
once a specific percentage of creditors, 75% to 90%, have 
agreed to the restructuring terms. These CCAs prevent a 
small number of creditors—holdouts—from blocking re￾structuring. Unfortunately, the Argentine bonds did not 
have collective action clauses.
Given the absence of a collective action clause, Ar￾gentina was left with the second option, a voluntary ex￾change of old debt for new debt. Debt restructuring itself 
normally includes four key elements: (1) a reduction in the 
principal of the obligation, (2) a reduction in the interest 
rate, (3) an extension of the obligation’s maturity, and (4) 
capitalization of missed interest payments. The total result 
is a reduction in the net present value of the debt obli￾gation, the so-called haircut, which may range anywhere 
from a reduction of 30% to 70%.
A second common clause included within sovereign 
debt, the pari passu clause (Latin for “equal steps” and 
read as “equal among equals”), calls for all creditors to be 
treated equally, ensuring that private or individual deals 
are not made in preference to some creditors over others. 
Argentina’s sovereign debt did include a pari passu clause 
(Argentine Fiscal Agency Agreement (1994), Clause 1c):
The Securities will constitute. . . direct, unconditional, un￾secured and unsubordinated obligations of the Republic 
and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any 
preference among themselves. The payment obligations 
of the Republic under the Securities shall at all times 
rank at least equally with all its other present and future 
unsecured and unsubordinated External Indebtedness 
(as defined in this Agreement).
Restructuring
Following the December 2001 default, Argentina initiated 
restructuring discussions with its creditors. From the very 
beginning, it took a hard line. Nearly every dimension of the 
proposed restructuring was in debate, but the 70% haircut 
Argentina proposed was the single biggest problem. What 
followed, as shown in Exhibit A, was a long and twisted path 
toward debt resolution. It is important to note that many 
buyers of these bonds in the secondary markets were not 
original investors—they were intentionally buying default￾ed debt. After three years of contentious talks and two un￾successful proposals, Argentina moved forward with a uni￾lateral reorganization offer to all creditors in early 2005. In 
preparation for the offer, Argentina passed the Lock Law, 
Ley cerrojo. The Lock Law prohibited Argentina from mak￾ing any arrangement to pay the unexchanged bonds:
The national State shall be prohibited from conducting 
any type of in-court, out-of-court or private settlement 
with respect to the FAA [Fiscal Agency Agreement] 
bonds.

M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 554 10/07/23 4:38 PMThe Lock Law was meant to provide additional incen￾tive for all creditors to exchange old debt for new debt—
immediately. Characterized as a “take it or leave it” offer, 
creditors were offered 26% to 30% of the net present val￾ue of the original face value of bond obligations, and as a 
result of the Lock Law, it was a one-time only offer. The of￾fer was accepted by 75% of Argentina’s creditors, reducing 
outstanding private debt from $81.8 billion to $18.6 billion. 
The offer was executed by exchanging the original bonds 
for new Argentina bonds.
The following year Argentina repaid the $9.5 billion 
in debt owed to the IMF. In 2010, in an attempt to elimi￾nate the remaining outstanding private debt, Argentina 
temporarily suspended the Lock Law to allow the same 
bond exchange terms to be offered once again to private 
debt holders. This second offer reduced the outstanding 
private debt principal to $8.6 billion. A full 92% of all 
original creditors had now exchanged the original debt for 
the reduced value new debt instruments. But a number of 
holdouts still refused the exchange and instead pursued 
litigation.
In the prospectus associated with the 2005 and 2010 
exchange offers (Exhibit B summarizes both offers), Ar￾gentina made it very clear that it did not intend to ever 
make further payments on the original FAA bonds:
[FAA Bonds] that are in default and that are not 
tendered may remain in default indefinitely ... 
Argentina does not expect to resume payments on any 
[FAA Bonds] that remain outstanding following the 
expiration of the exchange offer... there can be no 
assurance that [holders of unexchanged FAA Bonds] 
will receive any future payments or be able to collect 
through litigation ...

Dueling Hedge Funds
Distressed sovereign debt is not a rarity, and so it is not 
surprising that a number of hedge funds have made the 
buying and selling of publicly traded distressed debt a 
business line. There was, however, a fundamental differ￾ence between hedge fund investing in corporate distressed 
debt and sovereign distressed debt. A fund purchasing a 
substantial portion of distressed corporate debt may be￾come integrally involved in turning around the company; 
that was not the case with distressed sovereign debt.
Gramercy. One sovereign debt investor of note was 
Gramercy. In Gramercy’s promotion of its distressed debt 
fund shown in Exhibit C, it highlighted its investments in 
the debt of Argentina. Note that the stated target return 
greatly exceeds the yield to maturity (the rate of return ex￾pected by a prospective investor at issuance who holds the 
security to maturity). The higher target return is based on 
the highly discounted purchase price of the securities rela￾tive to the price at which Gramercy hopes/expects to sell 
the securities at a future date. Gramercy reportedly held 
$400 million in Argentine bonds in 2012 and still in 2014.
In addition to its purchase of distressed sovereign 
debt, Gramercy also aggressively protected its investments 
on the downside through the use of credit default swaps 
(CDSs). The CDS is a derivative contract that derives its 
value from the credit quality and performance of any spe￾cific asset. A CDS allows an investor to bet on whether a 
specific security will either fail to pay on time or fail to pay 
at all. In some cases, CDSs provide insurance against the 
possibility that a borrower might not pay. In other instanc￾es, CDSs allow a speculator to bet against an increasingly 
risky security. In contrast to traditional insurance where an 
owner of an asset purchases insurance for that asset, an in￾vestor in CDSs need not own the asset (like your neighbor 
purchasing fire insurance on your house).

Gramercy’s chief investment officer was Robert Koe￾nigsberger, formerly the manager of the sovereign debt 
restructuring team at Lehman Brothers. Koenigsberger 
had acted as an advisor to Argentina in its arguments in 
U.S. and European courts. It was, in fact, Gramercy that 
had persuaded Argentina to reopen the 2005 restructuring 
negotiations in 2010.
As Gramercy championed the 2010 restructuring of￾fering, it argued that the markets were mispricing Argentine 
debt on the basis of government debt as percentage of GDP. 
Argentina’s credit default swap (CDS) spread was a full 
700 basis points—7.00%—above U.S. Treasuries, although 
Argentina’s debt/GDP ratio was a moderate 46.4%. At the 
same time, Brazil had a CDS spread of 119 basis points with 
a 61.7% debt/GDP ratio, and Turkey had a CDS spread of 
150 basis point with a 49.0% debt/GDP ratio. If Gramercy 
was correct and if the market “corrected its error,” the pric￾es of the Argentine bonds would rise dramatically.
Elliot. A second hedge fund, Elliot Management Corp, had 
waged war on Argentina and its debt for years. Elliot, led 
by Paul Singer, a 68-year-old billionaire and a high-profile 
supporter of the U.S. Republican Party, was one of the 
chief litigants against Argentina. Singer had been called 
the father of vulture funds and in recent years had used 
this same investment strategy in Peru, the Democratic Re￾public of Congo, and Panama.
Elliot’s fund, NML Capital Ltd., had first invested 
in Argentine bonds before the 2001 default but had pur￾chased most of its holdings as late as 2008, in the midst of 
the global financial crisis, at rock-bottom prices. (One sto￾ry reported that Elliot paid $48.7 million for $832 million 
in bonds—$0.06 on the dollar.) Elliott now claimed it was 
due $2.5 billion. As the lead holdout, Elliot had refused 
the offered exchange in both 2005 and 2010. Elliot was 
known for hard-knuckle tactics, actually having detained 
an Argentine naval training vessel, the ARA Libertad, in a 
Ghanaian port for more than two months in an attempt to 
attach collateral.
NML Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina
Because the distressed debt was under the jurisdiction 
of New York State law, specifically the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement (FAA), the case was eventually heard in U.S. 
District Court. The FAA stipulated that the repayments 
on the bonds were to be made by Argentina through a 
trustee based in New York, giving U.S. courts jurisdiction. 
On October 25, 2012, Judge Thomas P. Griesa for the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern District of New York, in 
NML Capital, Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, found in favor 
of the plaintiff:
[T]he judgements of the district court (1) granting sum￾mary judgment to plaintiffs on their claims for breach of 
the Equal Treatment Provision and (2) ordering Argen￾tina to make “Ratable Payments” to plaintiffs concurrent 
with or in advance of its payments to holders of the 2005 
and 2010 restructured debt are affirmed.
The impact of the court’s decision was dramatic. Ar￾gentina immediately announced that it would not honor 
the court’s decision. One month later Argentina lost its 
appeal, with Judge Griesa instructing Argentina to move 
forward quickly to comply with the Court’s judgment. 
Again, Argentina refused to comply. Fitch, one of the 
three major global sovereign credit rating services, then 
downgraded Argentina’s credit rating (long-term foreign 
currency) from B to CC, noting that “a default by Argentina 
isprobable.”
The markets closely followed the case. As illustrated 
by Exhibit D, the value of the outstanding Argentine ex￾change bonds plummeted in the days and months follow￾ing the rulings. For example, the Argentine 2017 Global 
Bond (exchange bond from 2005) carrying an 8.75% 
coupon fell 9.9% in the one day following the court judg￾ment and fell a cumulative 24% by the following week. 
In subsequent hearings Judge Griesa cautioned Argentina 
on altering the payment processes on the bonds. This was 
in response to Argentina’s newest strategy to circumvent 
the U.S. courts by processing payments to the exchanged 
bondholders through financial institutions outside the 
United States. The FAA bonds and their governing law 
expressly required processing through New York financial 
institutions.
On appeal Argentina argued that the District Court 
had misconstrued the pari passu clause, but the Second 
Circuit court was not persuaded. The court noted that the 
combination of the issuance and service on the exchange

bonds, without making equal payments to the holdouts 
and simultaneously stating under the Lock Law that the 
holdouts would not ever be paid, was in effect ranking or 
subordinating the original debt. The court went on to note 
the particularly critical role the pari passu clause plays:
When sovereigns default they do not enter bankruptcy 
proceedings where the legal rank of debt determines the 
order in which creditors will be paid. Instead, sovereigns 
can choose for themselves the order in which creditors will 
be paid. In this context, the [Pari Passu Clause] prevents 
Argentina as payor from discriminating against the FAA 
bonds in favor of other unsubordinated, foreign bonds.
To its credit, Argentina had made substantial efforts 
at repairing its relationship with the outside world. By late 
May, it had committed to repaying the $9.7 billion owed 
to the Paris Club and had agreed to pay Repsol of Spain 
$5 billion in Argentine bonds for its seizure of Repsol’s 
Argentine subsidiary earlier in 2013.
On Monday, June 25, 2014, Argentina deposited 
$832 million in a New York bank in preparation for pay￾ment of interest on its exchange bonds. This would be in 
direct conflict with the ruling of the courts. According to 
Argentina’s economic minister: “Complying with a ruling 
doesn’t exempt us from honouring our obligations. Argen￾tina will meet its obligations, will pay its debt, will honour 
its promises.” A full-page official communique was placed 
in the Financial Times explaining the country’s position. 
But the court order prevented the banks from dispensing 
payments on the restructured debt unless holdout credi￾tors were also paid. Argentina argued that because it had 
deposited the money in the transfer accounts for payment, 
the bondholders had been paid. The courts disagreed.
What Now?
Argentina’s response to the latest U.S. court rulings was 
outrage. Within days, Argentina announced a plan to swap 
existing bonds governed by U.S. law for debt issued under 
Argentine law. Although unprecedented in sovereign debt 
markets, the move had been anticipated by market ana￾lysts. If investors were willing to undertake the exchange, 
they would receive some of the highest interest yields in 
the world—foregoing default—but they would give up all 
legal rights and protection provided under U.S. law.
Judge Griesa released a statement that any attempt 
by Argentina to proceed with payments on its restruc￾tured debt, without settling with holdouts first, was illegal. 
Argentina continued to argue that this was impossible. 
According to the Argentine finance minister, if Argen￾tina settled with the holdouts, the exchange bondhold￾ers could possibly sue for equal treatment—the RUFO 
(Rights Upon Future Offer) clause—and total claims 
could reach $120 billion. The RUFO clause, contained in 
all of the exchange bonds issued in 2005 and 2010, guaran￾teed exchange bondholders the same rights and payments 
that might possibly be provided the holdout bondholders. 
Given the renewed currency crises the country was 
suffering, Argentina’s hard currency reserves were esti￾mated at only $30 billion, inadequate to settle potential 
RUFO claims.
On June 30, 2014, Argentina failed to make payments 
on its outstanding exchange bonds. The country now had 
a single 30-day grace period before entering into selec￾tive default. In early July, representatives of the Argentine 
Finance Ministry and the Elliot Group met to see if they 
could find an acceptable solution.

Questions
17.1 Evolving into Multinationalism. As a firm evolves 
from purely domestic into a true multinational en￾terprise (MNE), it must consider (1) its competitive 
advantages, (2) its production location, (3) the type 
of control it wants to have over any foreign opera￾tions, and (4) how much monetary capital to invest 
abroad. Explain how each of these considerations is 
important to the success of foreign operations.
17.2 Market Imperfections. MNEs strive to take advantage 
of market imperfections in national markets for 
products, factors of production, and financial assets. 
Large international firms are better able to exploit 
such imperfections. What are their main competitive 
advantages?
17.3 Competitive Advantage. When firms decide to in￾vest in foreign countries, their decision is based on 
the competitive advantage of the firm as well as 
those of the host country. What are some of com￾petitive advantages enjoyed by both the firms and 
host nations?
17.4 Economies of Scale and Scope. It is recognized that 
economies of scale and scope reduce the average 
costs of firms. Should firms avoid excessive expansion 
to avoid potential diseconomies of scale and scope? 
17.5 Competitiveness of the Home Market. One method 
by which multinational firms can increase profitability 
and competitiveness is to operate in competitive home 
markets. What are the factors that can enhance a home 
country’s competitive advantage?

foreign market entry. Explain how the financial strate￾gies of firms are directly related to the OLI Paradigm. 
17.7 Financial Links to OLI. Financial strategies are di￾rectly related to the OLI Paradigm.
a. Explain how proactive financial strategies are 
related to OLI.
b. Explain how reactive financial strategies are 
related to OLI.

abroad is influenced by behavioral factors.
a. Explain the behavioral approach to FDI.
b. Explain the international network theory expla￾nation of FDI.
17.9 Investing Abroad. What are the factors that lead 
a firm to expand its investment and production 
operations into new foreign markets?

that require tight control over technological know￾how? Explain. 
17.12 Greenfield Investment versus Acquisition. What 
are the advantages and disadvantages of serving 
a foreign market through a greenfield FDI com￾pared to an acquisition of a local firm in the target 
market?
17.13 Strategic Alliance. What are the main advantages 
and disadvantages that parties should consider be￾fore forming strategic alliances? 
17.14 Governance Risk. Explain the methods by which 
MNEs can tackle issues of governance as they ex￾pand into new nations. 
17.15 Host Government Investment Duties. Host gov￾ernments often engage investment advisers to assist 
them with investments, investment agreements, and 
investment insurance. What are advisors’ responsi￾bilities for each of these matters? 
17.16 Common Forms. Define the following types of po￾litical risk:
a. Adverse regulatory change
b. Breach of contract
c. Expropriation
17.17 Lawful Expropriation. What criteria have to be 
met for a government’s seizure of a company’s 
business to be considered “lawful” by interna￾tional law?
17.18 Political Risks. What are the various micro and 
macro political risks that MNEs have to assess be￾fore deciding to invest in a foreign country? 
17.19 Blocked Funds. Why do MNEs operate in coun￾tries that impose transfer restrictions and how can 
they manage impending transfer risks? 
17.20 Emerging Market Cultural Risks. Give examples 
of the cultural risks specific to emerging markets 
that MNEs could encounter?
17.21 Emerging Market Institutional Risks. It is com￾monly argued that many cultural risks in emerging 
market economies can be reduced by institutional 
development. Do you agree? 
M17B_EITE5960_16_GE_C17.indd 558 10/07/23 4:38 PMCHAPTER 17 Foreign Direct Investment and Political Risk 559
17.22 Sovereign Credit Risk. Is sovereign credit risk an 
example of a micro or macro risk? How can it im￾pact multinational companies?
17.23 MNEs and Protectionism. What are the main 
reasons that emerging economies protect their do￾mestic markets? What are some of the arguments 
against protectionism? Is it advisable that multina￾tionals operate in protected markets?
17.24 Types of Political Risks. Should multinational firms 
worry more about micro, country-specific, or global 
political risks?
17.25 Mitigating Risks. Explain whether it is more fea￾sible for multinational firms to manage or mitigate 
micro, country-specific, or global political risks. 
17.26 Reputation Risk. Multinational firms are forbid￾den to engage in unethical transactions by the 
local anti-bribery, anti-child-labor law, and anti￾corruption laws of the countries in which they 
operate and those of their home country. With 
the rise in global ethical concerns, the multina￾tional firms can develop reputational risks if it 
outsources some of its operations to corruption￾prone suppliers. How can multinational firms 
limit these risks?
17.27 Blocked Funds. Explain the strategies used by an 
MNE to counter blocked funds.

18.5 Introduce the principles of cross-border mergers and acquisitions
This chapter describes in detail the issues and principles related to investment in real pro￾ductive assets in foreign countries, generally referred to as multinational capital budgeting. 
The chapter first describes the complexities of budgeting for a foreign project. Second, we 
describe the insights gained by valuing a project from both the project’s viewpoint and the 
parent’s viewpoint using an illustrative case involving an investment by Cemex of Mexico in 
Indonesia. The illustrative case is followed by an exploration of the use of real option analysis
for a foreign project. Next, the use of project financing today is discussed, and the final section 
describes the stages involved in affecting cross-border acquisitions. The chapter concludes 
with the mini-case Mittal’s Hostile Acquisition of Arcelor, one of the most famous cross￾border acquisitions in European history.
Although the original decision to undertake an investment in a particular foreign coun￾try may be determined by a mix of strategic, behavioral, and economic factors, the specific 
project should be justified—as should all reinvestment decisions—by traditional financial 
analysis. For example, a production efficiency opportunity may exist for a U.S. firm to in￾vest abroad, but the type of plant, mix of labor and capital, kinds of equipment, method of 
financing, and other project variables must be analyzed with traditional discounted cash flow 
analysis. The firm must also consider the impact of the proposed foreign project on consoli￾dated earnings, cash flows from subsidiaries in other countries, and the market value of the 
parent firm. Multinational capital budgeting for a foreign project uses the same theoretical

framework as domestic capital budgeting—with a few very important differences. The basic 
steps are as follows:
■ Identify the initial capital invested or put at risk.
■ Estimate cash flows to be derived from the project over time, including an estimate of the 
terminal or salvage value of the investment.
■ Identify the appropriate discount rate for determining the present value of the expected 
cash flows.
■ Apply traditional capital budgeting decision criteria such as net present value (NPV) 
and internal rate of return (IRR) to determine the acceptability of or priority ranking of 
potential projects.
18.1 Complexities of Budgeting for a Foreign Project
Capital budgeting for a foreign project is considerably more complex than the domestic case. 
Two broad categories of factors contribute to this greater complexity, cash flows and manage￾rial expectations.
Cash Flows
■ Parent cash flows must be distinguished from project cash flows. Each of these two types 
of flows contributes to a different view of value.
■ Parent cash flows often depend on the form of financing. Thus, we cannot clearly separate 
cash flows from financing decisions, as we can in domestic capital budgeting.
■ Additional cash flows generated by a new investment in one foreign subsidiary may be in 
part or in whole taken away from another subsidiary, with the net result that the project 
is favorable from a single subsidiary’s point of view but contributes nothing to worldwide 
cash flows.
■ The parent must explicitly recognize remittance of funds because of differing tax systems, 
legal and political constraints on the movement of funds, local business norms, and differ￾ences in the way financial markets and institutions function.
■ An array of nonfinancial payments can generate cash flows from subsidiaries to the par￾ent, including payment of license fees and payments for imports from the parent.
Management Expectations
■ Managers must anticipate differing rates of national inflation because of their potential 
to cause changes in competitive position, and thus changes in cash flows over a period 
of time.
■ Managers must keep the possibility of unanticipated foreign exchange rate changes in 
mind because of possible direct effects on the value of local cash flows as well as indirect 
effects on the competitive position of the foreign subsidiary.
■ Use of segmented national capital markets may create an opportunity for financial gains 
or may lead to additional financial costs.
■ Use of host-government subsidized loans complicates both capital structure and the par￾ent’s ability to determine an appropriate weighted average cost of capital for discounting 
purposes.
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 561 03/05/23 3:02 PM562 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
■ Managers must evaluate political risk because political events can drastically reduce the 
value or availability of expected cash flows.
■ Terminal value is more difficult to estimate because potential purchasers from the host, 
parent, or third countries or from the private or public sector may have widely divergent 
perspectives on the value to them of acquiring the project.
Since the same theoretical capital budgeting framework is used to choose among com￾peting foreign and domestic projects, it is critical that we have a common standard. Thus, all 
foreign complexities must be quantified as modifications to either expected cash flow or the 
rate of discount. Although in practice many firms make such modifications arbitrarily, readily 
available information, theoretical deduction, or just plain common sense can be used to make 
less arbitrary and more reasonable choices.
Project versus Parent Valuation
Consider a foreign direct investment like that illustrated in Exhibit 18.1. A U.S. multinational 
invests capital in a foreign project in a foreign country, the results of which—if they occur—
are generated over time. Similar to any investment, domestically or internationally, the return 
on the investment is based on the outcomes to the parent company. Given that the initial 
investment is in the parent’s own or home currency, the U.S. dollar in this case, then those 
returns over time need to be denominated in that same currency for evaluation purposes.
A strong theoretical argument exists in favor of analyzing any foreign project from the 
viewpoint of the parent. Cash flows to the parent are ultimately the basis for dividends to 
stockholders, reinvestment elsewhere in the world, repayment of corporate-wide debt, and 
other purposes that affect the firm’s many interest groups. However, since most of a project’s 
cash flows to its parent or sister subsidiaries are financial cash flows rather than operating 
cash flows, the parent viewpoint violates a cardinal concept of capital budgeting, namely, that 
financial cash flows should not be mixed with operating cash flows. Often the difference is 
not important because the two are almost identical, but in some instances a sharp divergence 
in these cash flows will exist. For example, funds that are permanently blocked from repa￾triation, or “forcibly reinvested,” are not available for dividends to the stockholders or for 
repayment of parent debt. Therefore, shareholders will not perceive the blocked earnings as

contributing to the value of the firm, and creditors will not count on them in calculating inter￾est coverage ratios and other metrics of debt service capability.
Evaluation of a project from the local viewpoint—the project viewpoint—serves a num￾ber of useful purposes as well. In evaluating a foreign project’s performance relative to the 
potential of a competing project in the same host country, we must pay attention to the proj￾ect’s local return. Almost any project should at least be able to earn a cash return equal to 
the yield available on host government bonds with a maturity equal to the project’s economic 
life if a free market exists for such bonds. Host-government bonds ordinarily reflect the local 
risk-free rate of return, including a premium equal to the expected rate of inflation. If a proj￾ect cannot earn more than such a bond yield, the parent firm should buy host government 
bonds rather than invest in a riskier project.
Multinational firms should invest only if they can earn a risk-adjusted return greater 
than locally based competitors can earn on the same project (and of course above their cost 
of capital). If they are unable to earn superior returns on foreign projects, their stockholders 
would be better off buying shares in local firms, where possible, and letting those companies 
carry out the local projects. Apart from these theoretical arguments, surveys over the past 
40 years show that in practice MNEs continue to evaluate foreign investments from both the 
parent and project viewpoint. The attention paid to project returns in various surveys may 
reflect an emphasis on maximizing reported earnings per share as a corporate financial goal 
of publicly traded companies. It is not clear that privately held firms place the same empha￾sis on consolidated results, given that few public investors ever see their financial results. 
Consolidation practices, including translation, as described in Chapter 11, remeasure foreign 
project cash flows, earnings, and assets as if they are “returned” to the parent company. And 
as long as foreign earnings are not blocked, they can be consolidated with the earnings of 
both the remaining subsidiaries and the parent.1 Even in the case of temporarily blocked 
funds, some of the most mature MNEs do not necessarily eliminate a project from financial 
consideration. They take a very long-run view of world business opportunities.
If blocked funds can be reinvested in the country and earn a rate of return at least equal 
to what they would have earned when repatriated to the parent company, the impacts on the 
firm’s capital investments—its capital budgeting income—are roughly equal. This assumes 
that the forced reinvestment in the country and in the business will yield higher returns from 
that investment. Since large multinationals hold a portfolio of domestic and foreign projects, 
corporate liquidity is not impaired if a few projects have blocked funds; alternate sources 
of funds are available to meet all planned uses of funds. Furthermore, a long-run historical 
perspective on blocked funds lends support to the belief that funds are almost never per￾manently blocked. However, waiting for the release of such funds can be frustrating, and 
sometimes the blocked funds lose value while blocked because of inflation or unexpected 
exchange rate deterioration, even though they have been reinvested in the host country to 
protect at least part of their value in real terms.
In conclusion, most firms appear to evaluate foreign projects from both parent and proj￾ect viewpoints. The parent’s viewpoint gives results closer to the traditional meaning of net 
present value in capital budgeting theoretically but, as we will demonstrate, possibly not in 
practice. Project valuation provides a closer approximation of the effect on consolidated 
earnings per share, an effect that all surveys indicate is of major concern to practicing manag￾ers. To illustrate the foreign complexities of multinational capital budgeting, we now analyze 
a hypothetical market-seeking foreign direct investment by Cemex in Indonesia.

 U.S. firms must consolidate foreign subsidiaries that are over 50% owned. If a firm is owned between 20% and 49% 
by a parent, it is called an affiliate. Affiliates are consolidate with the parent owner on a pro rata basis. Subsidiaries 
less than 20% owned are normally carried as unconsolidated investments.

18.2 Illustrative Case: Cemex Enters Indonesia2
Cementos Mexicanos, Cemex, is considering the construction of a cement manufacturing fa￾cility on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The project, Semen Indonesia (the Indonesian 
word for “cement” is semen), would be a wholly owned greenfield investment with a total in￾stalled capacity of 20 million metric tonnes per year (mmt/y). Although that is large by Asian 
production standards, Cemex believes that its latest cement manufacturing technology would 
be most efficiently utilized with a production facility of this scale.
Cemex has three driving reasons for the project: (1) the firm wishes to enter the Southeast 
Asian market, a new market for Cemex; (2) the prospects for Asian infrastructure develop￾ment and growth appear very good over the longer term; and (3) Indonesia has become an 
attractive produce-for-export site as a result of the depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah 
(Rp) in recent years.
Cemex, the world’s third-largest cement manufacturer, is an MNE headquartered in an 
emerging market but competing in a global arena. The firm competes in the global market￾place for both market share and capital. The international cement market, like markets in 
other commodities such as oil, is a dollar-based market. For this reason, and for comparisons 
against its major competitors in both Germany and Switzerland, Cemex considers the U.S. 
dollar to be its functional currency.
Cemex’s shares are listed in both Mexico City and New York (OTC: CMXSY). The firm 
has successfully raised capital—both debt and equity—outside Mexico in U.S. dollars. Its in￾vestor base is increasingly global, with the U.S. share turnover rising rapidly as a percentage 
of total trading. As a result, its cost and availability of capital are internationalized and domi￾nated by U.S. dollar investors. Ultimately, the Semen Indonesia project will be evaluated—in 
both cash flows and capital cost—in U.S. dollars.
Overview
The first step in analyzing Cemex’s potential investment in Indonesia is to construct a set 
of pro forma financial statements for Semen Indonesia, all in Indonesian rupiah. The next 
step is to create two capital budgets, the project viewpoint and parent viewpoint. Semen 
Indonesia will take only one year to build the plant, with actual operations commencing in 
year 1. The Indonesian government has only recently deregulated the heavier industries to 
allow foreign ownership.
All of the following analysis is conducted assuming that purchasing power parity (PPP) 
holds for the rupiah-to-dollar exchange rate for the life of the Indonesian project. This is a 
standard financial assumption made by Cemex for its foreign investments. Thus, if we assume 
an initial spot rate of Rp10,000 = $1.00 and Indonesian and U.S. inflation rates of 30% and 
3% per annum, respectively, for the life of the project, forecasted spot exchange rates follow 
the usual PPP calculation. For example, the forecasted exchange rate for year 1 of the project 
would be as follows:
Spot rate (one 1 year now) = [Rp10,000 per$] *
1 + .30
1 + .03 = Rp12,621 per$
The financial statements shown in Exhibits 18.2 through 18.5 are based on these assumptions.
Capital Investment. Although the cost of building new cement manufacturing capacity 
anywhere in the industrial countries is now estimated at roughly $150/tonne of installed 
2
 Cemex is a real company. However, the greenfield investment, Semen Indonesia, described here is hypothetical.
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 564 03/05/23 3:02 PMCHAPTER 18 Multinational Capital Budgeting and Cross-Border Acquisitions 565
capacity, Cemex believed that it could build a state-of-the-art production and shipment facil￾ity in Sumatra at roughly $110/tonne (see Exhibit 18.2). Assuming a 20 mmt/y capacity and 
a year 0 average exchange rate of Rp10,000 = $1.00, this cost will constitute an investment 
of Rp22 trillion ($2.2 billion). This figure includes an investment of Rp17.6 trillion in plant 
and equipment, giving rise to an annual depreciation charge of Rp1.76 trillion if we assume a 
10-year straight-line depreciation schedule. The relatively short depreciation schedule is one 
of the policies of the Indonesian tax authorities meant to attract foreign investment.

Financing. This massive investment would be financed with 50% equity, all from Cemex, and 
50% debt—75% from Cemex and 25% from a bank consortium arranged by the Indonesian 
government. Cemex’s own U.S. dollar-based weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was cur￾rently estimated at 11.98%. The WACC for the project itself on a local Indonesian level in rupiah 
terms was estimated at 33.257%. The details of this calculation are discussed later in this chapter.
The cost of the U.S. dollar–denominated loan is stated in rupiah terms assuming purchasing 
power parity and U.S. dollar and Indonesian inflation rates of 3% and 30% per annum, respectively, 
throughout the subject period. The explicit debt structures, including repayment schedules, are pre￾sented in Exhibit 18.3. The loan arranged by the Indonesian government, part of the government’s 
economic development incentive program, is an eight-year loan, in rupiah, at 35% annual interest, 
fully amortizing. The interest payments are fully deductible against corporate tax liabilities.

The loan by Cemex to the Indonesian subsidiary is denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the loan will have to be repaid in U.S. dollars, not rupiah. At the 
time of the loan agreement, the spot exchange rate is Rp10,000 = $1.00. This is the assumption used in calculating the “scheduled” repaying of principal 
and interest in rupiah. The rupiah, however, is expected to depreciate in line with purchasing power parity. As it is repaid, the “actual” exchange rate will 
therefore give rise to a foreign exchange loss as it takes more and more rupiah to acquire U.S. dollars for debt service, both principal and interest. The 
foreign exchange losses on this debt service will be recognized on the Indonesian income statement.
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 566 03/05/23 3:02 PMCHAPTER 18 Multinational Capital Budgeting and Cross-Border Acquisitions 567
The majority of the debt, however, is being provided by the parent company, Cemex. 
After raising the capital from its financing subsidiary, Cemex will re-lend the capital to Semen 
Indonesia. The loan is denominated in U.S. dollars, five years maturity, with an annual in￾terest rate of 10%. Because the debt will have to be repaid from the rupiah earnings of the 
Indonesian enterprise, the pro forma financial statements are constructed so that the expected 
costs of servicing the dollar debt are included in the firm’s pro forma income statement. The 
dollar loan, if the rupiah follows the purchasing power parity forecast, will have an effective 
interest expense in rupiah terms of 38.835% before taxes. We find this rate by determining the 
internal rate of return of repaying the dollar loan in full in rupiah (see Exhibit 18.3).
The loan by Cemex to the Indonesian subsidiary is denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, 
the loan will have to be repaid in U.S. dollars, not rupiah. At the time of the loan agreement, 
the spot exchange rate is Rp10,000 = $1.00. This is the assumption used in calculating the 
“scheduled” repaying of principal and interest in rupiah. The rupiah, however, is expected to 
depreciate in line with purchasing power parity. As it is repaid, the “actual” exchange rate will 
therefore give rise to a foreign exchange loss as it takes more and more rupiah to acquire U.S. 
dollars for debt service, both principal and interest. The foreign exchange losses on this debt 
service will be recognized on the Indonesian income statement.
Revenues. Given the current existing cement manufacturing in Indonesia and its currently 
depressed state as a result of the Asian crisis, all sales are based on export. The 20 mmt/y facil￾ity is expected to operate at only 40% capacity (producing 8 million metric tonnes). Cement 
produced will be sold in the export market at $58/tonne (delivered). Note also that, at least 
for the conservative baseline analysis, we assume no increase in the price received over time.
Costs. The cash costs of cement manufacturing (labor, materials, power, and so forth) are 
estimated at Rp115,000 per tonne for year 1, rising at about the rate of inflation, 30% per 
year. Additional production costs of Rp20,000 per tonne for year 1 are also assumed to rise at 
the rate of inflation. As a result of all production being exported, loading costs of $2.00/tonne
shipping of $2.00/tonne and shipping of $10.00/tonne must also be included. Note that these 
costs are originally stated in U.S. dollars, and for the purposes of Semen Indonesia’s income 
statement, they must be converted to rupiah terms. This is the case because both ship loading 
and shipping costs are international services governed by contracts denominated in dollars. 
As a result, they are expected to rise over time only at the U.S. dollar rate of inflation (3%).
Semen Indonesia’s pro forma income statement is illustrated in Exhibit 18.4. This is 
the typical financial statement measurement of the profitability of any business, whether 
domestic or international. The baseline analysis assumes a capacity utilization rate of only 
40% (year 1), 50% (year 2), and 60% in the following years. Management believes this is 
necessary since existing in-country cement manufacturers are averaging only 40% of ca￾pacity at this time.
Additional expenses in the pro forma financial analysis include license fees paid by the 
subsidiary to the parent company of 2.0% of sales, and general and administrative expenses 
for Indonesian operations of 8.0% per year (and growing an additional 1% per year). Foreign 
exchange gains and losses are those related to the servicing of the U.S. dollar-denominated 
debt provided by the parent and are drawn from the bottom of Exhibit 18.3. In summary, the 
subsidiary operation is expected to begin turning an accounting profit in its fourth year of 
operations, with profits rising as capacity utilization increases over time.
The loan by Cemex to the Indonesian subsidiary is denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, 
the loan will be repaid in U.S. dollars, not rupiah. At the time of the loan agreement, the spot 
exchange rate is Rp10,000 = $1.00. This is the assumption used in calculating the “sched￾uled” repaying of principal and interest in rupiah. The rupiah, however, is expected to de￾preciate in line with purchasing power parity. As it is repaid, the “actual” exchange rate will

EBITDA = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBIT = earnings before interest and taxes; EBT = earnings before taxes.
Tax credits resulting from current period losses are carried forward toward next year’s tax liabilities. Dividends are not distributed in the first year of 
operations as a result of losses and are distributed at a 50% rate in years 3–5.
All calculations are exact but may appear not to add due to reported decimal places. The tax payment for year 3 is zero and year 4 is less than 30% as a 
result of tax loss carry-forwards from previous years.

therefore give rise to a foreign exchange loss as it takes more and more rupiah to acquire U.S. 
dollars for debt service, both principal and interest. The foreign exchange losses on this debt 
service will be recognized on the Indonesian income statement.
Tax credits resulting from current period losses are carried forward toward next year’s 
tax liabilities. As a result of losses, no dividends are distributed in the first year of operations; 
in years 0–3, dividends are distributed at a 50% rate.
Project Viewpoint Capital Budget
The capital budget for the Semen Indonesia project from a project viewpoint is shown in 
Exhibit 18.5. We find the net cash flow, free cash flow as it is often labeled, by summing (1) 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), (2) recalculated 
taxes, (3) changes in net working capital (the sum of the net additions to receivables, invento￾ries, and payables necessary to support sales growth), and (4) capital investment.
Note that EBIT, not EBT, is used in the capital budget, which contains both depreciation 
and interest expense. Depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses of the firm and 
therefore contribute positive cash flow. Because the capital budget creates cash flows that 
will be discounted to present value with a discount rate and the discount rate includes the 
cost of debt—interest—we do not wish to subtract interest twice. Therefore, taxes are recal￾culated on the basis of EBIT.3 The firm’s cost of capital used in discounting also includes the 
deductibility of debt interest in its calculation.
The initial investment of Rp22 trillion is the total capital invested to support these earn￾ings. Although receivables average 50 to 55 days sales outstanding (DSO) and inventories 
average 65 to 70 DSO, payables and trade credit are also relatively long at 114 DSO in the 
Indonesian cement industry. Semen Indonesia expects to add approximately 15 net DSO to 
its investment with sales growth. The remaining elements to complete the project viewpoint’s 
capital budget are the terminal value (discussed below) and the discount rate of 33.257% (the 
firm’s weighted average cost of capital).
The terminal value (TV) of the project represents the continuing value of the cement 
manufacturing facility in the years after year 5, the last year of the detailed pro forma fi￾nancial analysis shown in Exhibit 18.5. This value, like all asset values according to financial 
theory, is the present value of all future free cash flows that the asset is expected to yield. We 
calculate the TV as the present value of a perpetual net operating cash flow (NOCF) gener￾ated in the fifth year by Semen Indonesia, the growth rate assumed for that net operating 
cash flow (g), and the firm’s weighted average cost of capital (kWACC):
Terminal value = NOCF5 11 + g2
Kwacc - g = 7,075,05911 + 02
.33257 - 0 = Rp21,274,102
or Rp21,274,102 trillion. The assumption that g = 0, that is, that net operating cash flows will 
not grow past year 5, is probably not true, but it is a prudent assumption for Cemex to make 
when estimating future cash flows. (If Semen Indonesia’s business was to continue to grow in 
line with the Indonesian economy, g may well be 1% or 2%.) The results of the capital budget 
from the project viewpoint indicate a negative net present value (NPV) and an internal rate 
of return (IRR) of only 19.1% compared to the 33.257% cost of capital. These are the returns 
the project would yield to a local or Indonesian investor in Indonesian rupiah. The project, 
from this viewpoint, is not acceptable.

 This highlights the distinction between an income statement and a capital budget. The project’s income statement 
shows losses the first two years of operations as a result of interest expenses and forecast foreign exchange losses, so 
it is not expected to pay taxes. But the capital budget, constructed on the basis of EBIT, before these financing and 
foreign exchange expenses, calculates a positive tax payment.
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 569 03/05/23 3:02 PM570 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
Note that net working capital (NWC) is not included in the terminal value. This is an item 
of considerable debate. Traditional capital budgeting typically recaptures NWC as part of the 
final year cash flows, others argue that the project is continuing and will not recapture work￾ing capital as if the project were shutdown. In business, however, if the business were sold, 
NWC would be separately estimated and included (as if part of terminal value).
Parent Viewpoint Capital Budget
The first step to the creation of the parent viewpoint capital budget is to collect all incremental 
earnings to Cemex from its prospective investment in Indonesia. As described in the section 
preceding this illustrative case, Project versus Parent Valuation, a foreign investor’s assessment 
of a project’s returns depends on the actual cash flows that are returned to it in its own currency 
via actual potential cash flow channels. For Cemex, this means that the investment must be 
analyzed in terms of the actual likely U.S. dollar cash inflows and outflows associated with the 
investment over the life of the project, after-tax, discounted at its appropriate cost of capital.
The parent viewpoint capital budget is constructed in two steps:
1. First, we isolate the individual cash flows, cash flows by channel, adjusted for any withhold￾ing taxes imposed by the Indonesian government and converted to U.S. dollars. (Statutory 
withholding taxes on international transfers are set by bilateral tax treaties, but individual 
firms may negotiate lower rates with governmental tax authorities. In the case of Semen 
Indonesia, withholding taxes will be imposed by the Indonesian government of 15% on 
dividend payments, 10% on interest payments, and 5% on licensing fees.) Mexico does not 
tax repatriated earnings since they have already been taxed in Indonesia. (The U.S. does 
levy a contingent tax on repatriated earnings of foreign source income.)
2. The second step, the actual parent viewpoint capital budget, combines these U.S. dol￾lar after-tax cash flows with the initial investment to determine the net present value 
of the proposed Semen Indonesia subsidiary in the eyes (and pocketbook) of Cemex. 
This is illustrated in Exhibit 18.6, which shows all incremental earnings to Cemex from 
the prospective investment project. A specific peculiarity of this parent viewpoint capital 
budget is that only the capital invested into the project by Cemex itself, $1,925 million, is 
included in the initial investment (the $1,100 million in equity and the $825 million loan).

The Indonesian debt of Rp2.75 billion ($275 million) is not included in the Cemex parent 
viewpoint capital budget.
Finally, all cash flow estimates are now constructed to form the parent viewpoint’s capital 
budget, detailed in the bottom of Exhibit 18.6. The cash flows generated by Semen Indonesia 
from its Indonesian operations, dividends, license fees, debt service, and terminal value are 
now valued in U.S. dollar terms after-tax.
In order to evaluate the project’s cash flows that are returned to the parent company, 
Cemex must discount these at the corporate cost of capital. Remembering that Cemex consid￾ers its functional currency to be the U.S. dollar, it calculates its cost of capital in U.S. dollars. As 
described in Chapter 12, the customary weighted average cost of capital formula is as follows:
kWACC = ke
E
V
+ kd (1 - t)
D
V
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 571 03/05/23 3:02 PM572 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
where ke is the risk-adjusted cost of equity, kd is the before-tax cost of debt, t is the marginal 
tax rate, E is the market value of the firm’s equity, D is the market value of the firm’s debt, 
and V is the total market value of the firm’s securities (E + D).
Cemex’s cost of equity is calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM):
ke = krf + (km - krf)bCemex = 6.00% + (13.00% - 6.00%) 1.5 = 16.50%
This assumes the risk-adjusted cost of equity (ke) is based on the risk-free rate of interest 
1krf2, as measured by the U.S. Treasury intermediate bond yield of 6.00%, the expected rate 
of return in U.S. equity markets (km) is 13.00%, and the measure of Cemex’s individual risk 
relative to the market (bCemex) is 1.5. The result is a cost of equity—required rate of return on 
equity investment in Cemex—of 16.50%.
The investment will be funded internally by the parent company, roughly in the same debt￾to-equity proportions as the consolidated firm, 40% debt (D/V) and 60% equity (E/V). The cur￾rent cost of debt for Cemex is 8.00%, and the effective tax rate is 35%. The cost of equity, when 
combined with the other components, results in a weighted average cost of capital for Cemex of
kWACC = ke
E
V
+ kd(1 - t)
D
V = (16.50%)(.60) + (8.00%)(1 - .35)(.40) = 11.98%
Cemex customarily uses this weighted average cost of capital of 11.98% to discount prospec￾tive investment cash flows for project ranking purposes. The Indonesian investment poses a 
variety of risks, however, which the typical domestic investment does not.
If Cemex were undertaking an investment of the same relative degree of risk as the firm 
itself, a simple discount rate of 11.980% might be adequate. Cemex, however, generally re￾quires new investments to yield an additional 3% over the cost of capital for domestic invest￾ments, and 6% more for international projects (these are company-required spreads and will 
differ dramatically across companies). The discount rate for Semen Indonesia’s cash flows re￾patriated to Cemex will therefore be discounted at 11.98% + 6.00%, or 17.98%. The project’s 
baseline analysis indicates a negative NPV with an IRR of -1.12%, which means that it is an 
unacceptable investment from the parent’s viewpoint.
Most corporations require that new investments more than cover the cost of the capital 
employed in their undertaking. It is therefore not unusual for the firm to require a hurdle rate 
of 3% to 6% above its cost of capital in order to identify potential investments that will liter￾ally add value to stockholder wealth. An NPV of zero means the investment is “acceptable,” 
but NPV values that exceed zero are literally the present value of wealth to be added to the 
value of the firm and its shareholders. For foreign projects, as discussed previously, we must 
adjust for agency costs and foreign exchange risks and costs.
Sensitivity Analysis: Project Viewpoint
So far, the project investigation team has used a set of “most likely” assumptions to forecast 
rates of return. It is now time to subject the most likely outcome to sensitivity analyses. The 
same probabilistic techniques are available to test the sensitivity of results to political and 
foreign exchange risks as are used to test sensitivity to business and financial risks. Many 
decision makers feel more uncomfortable about the necessity to guess probabilities for un￾familiar political and foreign exchange events than they do about guessing their own more 
familiar business or financial risks. Therefore, it is more common to test sensitivity to political 
and foreign exchange risk by simulating what would happen to net present value and earn￾ings under a variety of “what if” scenarios.
Political Risk. What if Indonesia imposes controls on the payment of dividends or license 
fees to Cemex? The impact of blocked funds on the rate of return from Cemex’s perspective 
would depend on when the blockage occurs, what reinvestment opportunities exist for the 
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 572 03/05/23 3:02 PMCHAPTER 18 Multinational Capital Budgeting and Cross-Border Acquisitions 573
blocked funds in Indonesia, and when the blocked funds would eventually be released to 
Cemex. We could simulate various scenarios for blocked funds and rerun the cash flow analy￾sis in Exhibit 18.6 to estimate the effect on Cemex’s rate of return.
What if Indonesia expropriates Semen Indonesia? The effect of expropriation would de￾pend on the following factors:
1. When the expropriation occurs, in terms of number of years after the business began 
operation
2. How much compensation the Indonesian government will pay and how long after expro￾priation the payment will be made
3. How much debt is still outstanding to Indonesian lenders and whether the parent, Cemex, 
will have to pay this debt because of its parental guarantee
4. The tax consequences of the expropriation
5. Whether the future cash flows are forgone
Many expropriations eventually result in some form of compensation to the former own￾ers. This compensation can come from a negotiated settlement with the host government or 
from payment of political risk insurance by the parent government. Negotiating a settlement 
takes time, and the eventual compensation is sometimes paid in installments over a further 
period of time. Thus, the present value of the compensation is often much lower than its 
nominal value. Furthermore, most settlements are based on book value of the firm at the time 
of expropriation rather than the firm’s market value.
The tax consequences of expropriation would depend on the timing and amount of capi￾tal loss recognized by Mexico. This loss would usually be based on the uncompensated book 
value of the Indonesian investment. The problem is that there is often some doubt as to when 
a write-off is appropriate for tax purposes, particularly if negotiations for a settlement drag 
on. In some ways, a nice clear expropriation without hope of compensation, such as occurred 
in Cuba in the early 1960s, is preferred to a slow “bleeding death” in protracted negotiations. 
The former leads to an earlier use of the tax shield and a one-shot write-off against earnings, 
whereas the latter tends to depress earnings for years, as legal and other costs continue and 
no tax shelter is achieved.
Foreign Exchange Risk. The project investigation team assumed that the Indonesian rupiah 
would depreciate versus the U.S. dollar at the PPP “rate” (approximately 20.767% per year in 
the baseline analysis). What if the rate of rupiah depreciation is greater? Although more rapid 
rupiah depreciation would make the expected cash flows to Cemex worth less in dollars, operat￾ing exposure analysis would be necessary to determine whether the cheaper rupiah made Semen 
Indonesia more competitive. For example, since Semen Indonesia’s exports to Taiwan are de￾nominated in U.S. dollars, a weakening of the rupiah versus the dollar could result in greater 
rupiah earnings from those export sales. This serves to somewhat offset the imported components 
that Semen Indonesia purchases from the parent company that are also denominated in U.S. dol￾lars. Semen Indonesia is representative of firms today that have both cash inflows and outflows 
denominated in foreign currencies, providing a partial natural hedge against currency movements.
What if the rupiah appreciates against the dollar? The same kind of economic expo￾sure analysis is needed. In this particular case, we might guess that the effect would be 
positive on both local sales in Indonesia and the value in dollars of dividends and license 
fees paid to Cemex by Semen Indonesia. Note, however, that an appreciation of the ru￾piah might lead to more competition within Indonesia from firms in other countries with 
now lower cost structures, lessening Semen Indonesia’s sales. Global Finance in Practice 
18.1 examines the changes in capital control strategy of China and its impact on forex risk 
management practices on local Chinese companies.

companies (both listed and private) hedge against adverse 
currency movements in (Credit Suisse, 2022). 
The regulators in China plan to slowly loosen the controls 
on the yuan to make it more acceptable as one of the primary 
currencies by the foreign exchange markets. However, doing 
so will also expose the Chinese companies to increased forex 
risk, something that the existing risk management practices 
in China does not seem to be ready for. 
Since June 2022, Chinese authorities have undertaken 
educating companies, bankers, and other finance profes￾sionals in the country on management of forex risks. They 
have conducted lectures, used social media prompts, and 
have occasionally asked senior officials to emphasize the 
importance of foreign currency hedge. Some commercial 
banks, like the OCBC Bank, have conducted special lessons 
for their clients to introduce currency hedging.
Such fundamental changes in the regulatory strategy 
towards capital controls in China will significantly modify the 
prevalent practice and the combination of tools used by com￾panies to manage their foreign exchange risk in the future.
Regulatory Strategy Towards Capital Controls
China has traditionally had a strict regulatory control on its 
currency. The yuan, unlike other major currencies, does not 
trade freely and allows market forces to determine the ex￾change rates. China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China 
(PBOC) dictates a “band,” and the value of the yuan is allowed 
to move up or down within 2% of that band on any given day. 
The PBOC also uses several other measures to ensure that 
the value of yuan remains stable over time. There are also sug￾gestions that this policy has strategically undervalued the yuan 
against global currencies, making Chinese exports cheaper. 
This is one of the major factors that has helped China become 
a global export powerhouse over the last couple of decades. 
However, it appears that this structural protection pro￾vided to domestic companies against foreign exchange 
(or forex) exposure has some unintended consequences. 
According to Reuters, in 2020, of around 4,400 publicly 
traded companies in China, less than 600 use any form 
of forex hedging tools for protection against adverse cur￾rency movements. In comparison, in Europe, over 44% of 
Other Sensitivity Variables. The project rate of return to Cemex would also be sensitive 
to a change in the assumed terminal value, the capacity utilization rate, the size of the license 
fee paid by Semen Indonesia, the size of the initial project cost, the amount of working capital 
financed locally, and the tax rates in Indonesia and Mexico. Since some of these variables 
are within the control of Cemex, it is still possible that the Semen Indonesia project could be 
improved in its value to the firm and become acceptable.
Sensitivity Analysis: Parent Viewpoint
When a foreign project is analyzed from the parent’s point of view, the additional risk that 
stems from its “foreign” location can be measured in two ways, adjusting the discount rates or 
adjusting the cash flows.
Adjusting Discount Rates. The first method is to treat all foreign risk as a single prob￾lem, by adjusting the discount rate applicable to foreign projects relative to the rate used for 
domestic projects to reflect the greater foreign exchange risk, political risk, agency costs, 
asymmetric information, and other uncertainties perceived in foreign operations. However, ad￾justing the discount rate applied to a foreign project’s cash flow to reflect these uncertainties 
does not penalize net present value in proportion either to the actual amount at risk or to pos￾sible variations in the nature of that risk over time. Combining all risks into a single discount 
rate may thus cause us to discard much information about the uncertainties of the future.
In the case of foreign exchange risk, changes in exchange rates have a potential effect 
on future cash flows because of operating exposure. The direction of the effect, however, can 
either decrease or increase net cash inflows, depending on where the products are sold and 
where inputs are sourced. To increase the discount rate applicable to a foreign project on 
the assumption that the foreign currency might depreciate more than expected is to ignore 
the possible favorable effect of a foreign currency depreciation on the project’s competitive 
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 574 03/05/23 3:02 PMCHAPTER 18 Multinational Capital Budgeting and Cross-Border Acquisitions 575
position. Increased sales volume might more than offset a lower value of the local currency. 
Such an increase in the discount rate also ignores the possibility that the foreign currency 
may appreciate (two-sided risk).
Adjusting Cash Flows. In the second method, we incorporate foreign risks in adjust￾ments to forecasted cash flows of the project. The discount rate for the foreign project is 
risk-adjusted only for overall business and financial risk, in the same manner as for domestic 
projects. Simulation-based assessment utilizes scenario development to estimate cash flows 
to the parent arising from the project over time under different alternative economic futures.
Certainty regarding the quantity and timing of cash flows in a prospective foreign invest￾ment is, to quote Shakespeare, “the stuff that dreams are made of.” Due to the complexity 
of economic forces at work in major investment projects, it is paramount that the analyst 
understands the subjectivity of the forecast cash flows. Humility in analysis is a valuable trait.
Shortcomings of Each Method. In many cases, however, neither adjusting the discount 
rate nor adjusting cash flows is optimal. For example, political uncertainties are a threat to 
the entire investment, not just the annual cash flows. Potential loss depends partly on the 
terminal value of the unrecovered parent investment, which will vary depending on how the 
project was financed, whether political risk insurance was obtained, and what investment 
horizon is contemplated. Furthermore, if the political climate were expected to be unfavor￾able in the near future, any investment would probably be unacceptable. Political uncertainty 
usually relates to possible adverse events that might occur in the more distant future, but that 
cannot be foreseen at the present. Adjusting the discount rate for political risk thus penalizes 
early cash flows too heavily while not penalizing distant cash flows enough.
Repercussions to the Investor. Apart from anticipated political and foreign exchange 
risks, MNEs sometimes worry that taking on foreign projects may increase the firm’s overall 
cost of capital because of investors’ perceptions of foreign risk. This worry seemed reason￾able if a firm had significant investments in Iraq, Iran, Russia, Serbia, or Afghanistan in recent 
years. However, the argument loses persuasiveness when applied to diversified foreign invest￾ments with a heavy balance in the industrial countries of Canada, Western Europe, Australia, 
Latin America, and Asia where, in fact, the bulk of foreign direct investment is located. These 
countries have a reputation for treating foreign investments by consistent standards, and em￾pirical evidence confirms that a foreign presence in these countries may not increase the cost 
of capital. In fact, some studies indicate that required returns on foreign projects may even be 
lower than those for domestic projects.
MNE Practices. Surveys of MNEs over the past 35 years have shown that about half of 
them adjust the discount rate and half adjust the cash flows. One recent survey indicated 
a rising use of adjusting discount rates over adjusting cash flows. However, the survey also 
indicated an increasing use of multifactor methods—discount rate adjustment, cash flow ad￾justment, real options analysis, and qualitative criteria—in evaluating foreign investments.4
Portfolio Risk Measurement
The field of finance has distinguished two different definitions of risk: (1) the risk of the 
individual security (standard deviation of expected return) and (2) the risk of the individual 
security as a component of a portfolio (beta). A foreign investment undertaken in order to

enter a local or regional market—market seeking—will have returns that are more or less cor￾related with those of the local market. A portfolio-based assessment of the investment’s pros￾pects would then seem appropriate. A foreign investment undertaken for resource-seeking
or production-seeking purposes may have returns related to those of the parent company or 
business units located somewhere else in the world and have little to do with local markets.
Cemex’s proposed investment in Semen Indonesia is both market-seeking and 
production-seeking (for export). The decision about which approach is to be used by the 
MNE in evaluating prospective foreign investments may be the single most important analyt￾ical decision it makes. An investment’s acceptability may change dramatically across criteria.
For comparisons within the local host country, we should overlook a project’s actual fi￾nancing or parent-influenced debt capacity, since these would probably be different for local 
investors than they are for a multinational owner. In addition, the risks of the project to local 
investors might differ from those perceived by a foreign multinational owner because of the 
opportunities an MNE has to take advantage of market imperfections. Moreover, the local 
project may be only one out of an internationally diversified portfolio of projects for the 
multinational owner; if undertaken by local investors, it might have to stand alone without 
international diversification. Since diversification reduces risk, the MNE can require a lower 
rate of return than is required by local investors.
Thus, the discount rate used locally must be a hypothetical rate based on a judgment as 
to what independent local investors would probably demand were they to own the business. 
Consequently, application of the local discount rate to local cash flows provides only a rough mea￾sure of the value of the project as a stand-alone local venture rather than an absolute valuation.
18.3 Real Option Analysis
The discounted cash flow (DCF) approach used in the valuation of Semen Indonesia—and 
capital budgeting and valuation in general—has long had its critics. Investments that have 
long lives, cash flow returns in later years, or higher levels of risk than those typical of the 
firm’s current business activities are often rejected by traditional DCF financial analysis. 
More importantly, when MNEs evaluate competitive projects, traditional discounted cash 
flow analysis is typically unable to capture the strategic options that an individual investment 
option may offer. This has led to the development of real option analysis. Real option analysis 
is the application of option theory to capital budgeting decisions.
Real options present a different way of thinking about investment values. At its core, it is 
a cross between decision-tree analysis and pure option-based valuation. It is particularly use￾ful when analyzing investment projects that will follow very different value paths at decision 
points in time where management decisions are made regarding project pursuit. This wide 
range of potential outcomes is at the heart of real option theory. These wide ranges of value 
are volatilities, the basic element of option pricing theory described previously.
Real option valuation also allows us to analyze a number of managerial decisions, which 
in practice characterize many major capital investment projects:
■ The option to defer
■ The option to abandon
■ The option to alter capacity
■ The option to start up or shut down (switching)
Real option analysis treats cash flows in terms of future value in a positive sense, whereas 
DCF treats future cash flows negatively (on a discounted basis). Real option analysis is a 
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 576 03/05/23 3:02 PMCHAPTER 18 Multinational Capital Budgeting and Cross-Border Acquisitions 577
particularly powerful device when addressing potential investment projects with extremely 
long life spans or investments that do not commence until future dates. Real option anal￾ysis acknowledges the way information is gathered over time to support decision-making. 
Management learns from both active (searching it out) and passive (observing market condi￾tions) knowledge-gathering and then uses this knowledge to make better decisions.
18.4 Project Financing
One of the more unique structures used in international finance is project finance, which 
refers to the arrangement of financing for long-term capital projects, which are large in scale, 
long in life, and generally high in risk. This is a very general definition, however, because there 
are many different forms and structures that fall under this generic heading.
Project finance is not new. Examples of project finance go back centuries and include 
many famous early international businesses such as the Dutch East India Company and the 
British East India Company. These entrepreneurial importers financed their trade ventures 
to Asia on a voyage-by-voyage basis, with each voyage’s financing being like venture capi￾tal—investors would be repaid when the shipper returned and the fruits of the Asian market￾place were sold at the docks to Mediterranean and European merchants. If all went well, the 
individual shareholders of the voyage were paid in full.
Project finance is used widely today in the development of large-scale infrastructure 
projects in China, India, and many other emerging markets. Although each individual project 
has unique characteristics, most are highly leveraged transactions, with debt making up more 
than 60% of the total financing. Equity is a small component of project financing for two rea￾sons: first, the simple scale of the investment project often precludes a single investor or even 
a collection of private investors from being able to fund it; second, many of these projects 
involve subjects traditionally funded by governments—such as electrical power generation, 
dam building, highway construction, energy exploration, production, and distribution.
This level of debt, however, places an enormous burden on cash flow for debt service. 
Therefore, project financing usually requires a number of additional levels of risk reduction. 
The lenders involved in these investments must feel secure that they will be repaid; bankers 
are not by nature entrepreneurs and do not enjoy entrepreneurial returns from project fi￾nance. Project finance has a number of basic properties that are critical to its success.
Separability of the Project from Its Investors
The project is established as an individual legal entity, separate from the legal and financial 
responsibilities of its individual investors. This not only serves to protect the assets of equity 
investors but also provides a controlled platform upon which creditors can evaluate the risks 
associated with the singular project and the ability of the project’s cash flows to service debt 
and can rest assured that the debt service payments will be automatically allocated by and 
from the project itself (and not from a decision by management within an MNE).
Long-Lived and Capital-Intensive Singular Projects
Not only must the individual project be separable and large in proportion to the financial re￾sources of its owners, but also its business line must be singular in its construction, operation, 
and size (capacity). The size is set at inception and is seldom, if ever, changed over the project’s 
life. A prime example of this would be an oil pipeline, such as the 1,768-kilometer-long Baku￾Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline extending between Baku, Azerbaijan, and Ceyhan, Turkey. The 
BTC’s size, its length and capacity, were established with its construction and would obviously 
not change over its life span (at least not without a major reconstruction effort).
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 577 03/05/23 3:02 PM578 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
Cash Flow Predictability from Third-Party Commitments
An oil field or electric power plant produces a homogeneous commodity product that can 
produce predictable cash flows if third-party commitments to take and pay can be estab￾lished. In addition to revenue predictability, nonfinancial costs of production need to be con￾trolled over time, usually through long-term supplier contracts with price adjustment clauses 
based on inflation. The predictability of net cash inflows to long-term contracts eliminates 
much of the individual project’s business risk, allowing the financial structure to be heavily 
debt-financed and still be safe from financial distress.
The predictability of the project’s revenue stream is essential in securing project financ￾ing. Typical contract provisions that are intended to ensure adequate cash flow normally in￾clude the following clauses: quantity and quality of the project’s output; a pricing formula 
that enhances the predictability of adequate margin to cover operating costs and debt service 
payments; and a clear statement of the circumstances that permit significant changes in the 
contract, such as force majeure or adverse business conditions.
Finite Projects with Finite Lives
Even with a longer-term investment, it is critical that the project have a definite ending point 
at which all debt and equity have been repaid. Because the project is a stand-alone invest￾ment in which its cash flows go directly to the servicing of its capital structure and not to re￾investment for growth or other investment alternatives, investors of all kinds need assurances 
that the project’s returns will be attained in a finite period. There is no capital appreciation, 
only cash flow.
Examples of project finance include some of the largest individual investments under￾taken in the past three decades, such as British Petroleum’s financing of its interest in the 
North Sea and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was a joint venture 
among Standard Oil of Ohio, Atlantic Richfield, Exxon, British Petroleum, Mobil Oil, Philips 
Petroleum, Union Oil, and Amerada Hess. Each of these projects was at or above $1 billion 
and represented capital expenditures that no single firm would or could attempt to finance. 
Yet, through a joint venture arrangement, the higher-than-normal risk absorbed by the capi￾tal employed could be managed.
18.5 Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions
The drivers of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, summarized in Exhibit 18.7, are both 
macro in scope—the global competitive environment—and micro in scope—the variety of 
industry and firm-level forces and actions driving individual firm value. The primary forces 
of change in the global competitive environment—technological change, regulatory change, 
and capital market change—create new business opportunities for MNEs, which they pursue 
aggressively.
But the global competitive environment is really just the playing field, the ground upon 
which the individual players compete. MNEs undertake cross-border mergers and acquisi￾tions for a variety of reasons. As shown in Exhibit 18.7, the drivers are strategic responses by 
MNEs to defend and enhance their global competitiveness.
As opposed to greenfield investment, a cross-border acquisition has a number of signifi￾cant advantages. First and foremost, it is quicker. Greenfield investment frequently requires 
extended periods of physical construction and organizational development. By acquiring an 
existing firm, the MNE shortens the time required to gain a presence and facilitate competitive 
entry into the market. Second, acquisition may be a cost-effective way of gaining competitive 
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 578 03/05/23 3:02 PMCHAPTER 18 Multinational Capital Budgeting and Cross-Border Acquisitions 579
advantages, such as technology, brand names valued in the target market, and logistical and 
distribution advantages, while simultaneously eliminating a local competitor. Third, specific 
to cross-border acquisitions, international economic, political, and foreign exchange condi￾tions may result in market imperfections, allowing target firms to be undervalued.
Cross-border acquisitions are not, however, without their pitfalls. As with all acqui￾sitions—domestic or cross-border—there are problems of paying too much or suffer￾ing excessive financing costs. Melding corporate cultures can be traumatic. Managing the 
post-acquisition process is frequently characterized by downsizing to gain economies of scale 
and scope in overhead functions. This results in nonproductive impacts on the firm as indi￾viduals attempt to save their own jobs. Internationally, additional difficulties arise from host 
governments intervening in pricing, financing, employment guarantees, market segmentation, 
and general nationalism and favoritism. In fact, the ability to successfully complete cross￾border acquisitions may itself be a test of competency of the MNE when entering emerging 
markets. Global Finance in Practice 18.2 illustrates a number of these potential acquisition 
challenges.
The Cross-Border Acquisition Process
Although the field of finance has sometimes viewed acquisition as mainly an issue of valua￾tion, it is a much more complex and rich process than simply determining what price to pay. 
As depicted in Exhibit 18.8, the process begins with the strategic drivers discussed in the 
previous section.
The process of acquiring an enterprise anywhere in the world has three common elements: 
(1) identification and valuation of the target, (2) completion of the ownership change—the 
tender, and (3) management of the post-acquisition transition.
Stage 1: Identification and Valuation. Identification of potential acquisition targets re￾quires a well-defined corporate strategy and focus. The identification of the target market 
typically precedes the identification of the target firm. Entering a highly developed market

offers the widest choice of publicly traded firms with relatively well-defined markets and 
publicly disclosed financial and operational data. In this case, the tender offer is made pub￾licly, although target company management may openly recommend that its shareholders 
reject the offer. If enough shareholders take the offer, the acquiring company may gain suf￾ficient ownership influence or control to change management.
GLOBAL FINANCE IN PRACTICE 18.2
shares in some product lines could yield a potential market 
share of 40%). But the Justice Department did not like the 
growing consolidation in the U.S. appliance market, and it 
pushed Electrolux to promise to sell off a number of segments 
to prevent anti-competitive impacts. In September 2015, 
Electrolux refused to offer any business sales or compro￾mises to the agreed-upon acquisition. Finally, in December 
2015, after continued objections by the U.S. Department 
of Justice, Electrolux and GE canceled the sale. GE did re￾ceive a $175  million agreement termination payment from 
Electrolux that the two parties had included in the original 
sales agreement.
GE renewed its search for a buyer of the appliance unit 
immediately, and rumors of a potential sale to Haier (China) 
rapidly grew. Haier had only a very small, specialized product 
line in the U.S., so gaining GE Appliances would make it an 
instant player in the large U.S. market. On January 15, 2016, 
less than two months after the Electrolux agreement was ter￾minated, GE announced that it was selling its appliance unit 
to Haier for $5.4 billion, an enormous improvement over the 
previous $3.3 billion agreement with Electrolux. This new deal 
was with a company that had a relatively small presence in 
the U.S. market and that clearly would not enjoy the cost 
synergies that Electrolux had expected to leverage. Value is 
indeed in the eyes of the beholder.
Values Change: GE Appliances and Electrolux
GE math. Consider: Let’s assume GE mispriced Appliances 
when it tried to sell it six years ago (a safe assumption, since 
it didn’t sell). So, let’s say the Appliances business was 
worth not $8 billion back then, but rather just half that—
$4 billion. Add the $1 billion spent spiffing up the busi￾ness, and divide the resulting $5 billion value into the best￾case price GE is expected to get for the unit today: $2.5 
billion. That works out to a 50% loss for GE shareholders.
—”Is General Electric Company About to Make Its Biggest 
Mistake Ever?,” The Motley Fool, July 19, 2014.
General Electric (GE) first tried to sell its appliance busi￾ness in 2008. GE had placed an $8 billion price tag on 
the century-old business, but amid a financial crisis, there 
were no takers. Six years later, it tried again. This time 
Electrolux of Sweden, one of the world’s largest appliance 
makers, was very interested. After months of negotiations, 
the two parties agreed in July 2014 upon a sale price of 
$3.3 billion—a dramatic drop from the previous price GE 
had asked.
Completion of the sale was expected in 2015, after re￾ceiving the approval of the U.S. Justice Department regarding 
antitrust concerns (combining GE’s and Electrolux’s market

During this rather confrontational process, it is up to the board of the target company to 
continue to take actions consistent with protecting the rights of shareholders. The board may 
need to provide rather strong oversight of management during this process to ensure that the 
acts of management are consistent with protecting and building shareholder value.
Once identification has been completed, the process of valuing the target begins. A vari￾ety of valuation techniques are widely used in global business today, each with its own merits. 
In addition to the fundamental methodologies of discounted cash flow (DCF) and multiples 
(earnings and cash flows), there are also industry-specific measures that focus on the most 
significant elements of value in business lines. The completion of various alternative valua￾tions for the target firm aids not only in gaining a more complete picture of what price must 
be paid to complete the transaction but also in determining whether the price is attractive.
Stage 2: Completion of the Ownership Change. Once an acquisition target has been 
identified and valued, the process of gaining approval from management and ownership 
of the target, getting approvals from government regulatory bodies, and finally determin￾ing method of compensation—the complete execution of the acquisition strategy—can be 
time-consuming and complex.
Gaining the approval of the target company has been the highlight of some of the most 
famous acquisitions in business history. The critical distinction here is whether the acquisition 
is supported by the target company’s management. Although there is probably no “typical 
transaction,” many acquisitions flow relatively smoothly through a friendly process. The ac￾quiring firm will approach the managers of the target company and attempt to convince them 
of the business logic of the acquisition. (Gaining their support is sometimes difficult, but as￾suring target company managers that they will not be replaced is often quite convincing!) If 
the target’s management is supportive, management may then recommend to stockholders 
that they accept the offer of the acquiring company. One problem that occasionally surfaces 
at this stage is that influential shareholders may object to the offer, either in principle or 
based on price, and may therefore feel that management is not taking appropriate steps to 
protect and build shareholder value.
The process takes on a very different dynamic when the acquisition is not supported 
by the target company management—the so-called hostile takeover. The acquiring company 
may choose to pursue the acquisition without the target’s support and instead go directly to 
the target shareholders. In this case, the tender offer is made publicly, although target com￾pany management may openly recommend that its shareholders reject the offer. If enough 
shareholders take the offer, the acquiring company may gain sufficient ownership influence 
or control to change management. During this rather confrontational process, it is up to the 
board of the target company to continue to take actions consistent with protecting the rights 
of shareholders. As in Stage 1, the board may need to provide strong oversight of manage￾ment during this process to ensure that the acts of management are consistent with protecting 
and building shareholder value. Regulatory approval alone may prove to be a major hurdle 
in the execution of the deal.
An acquisition may be subject to significant regulatory approval if it involves a company 
in an industry considered fundamental to national security or if there is concern over major 
concentration and anti-competitive results from consolidation.
The proposed acquisition of Honeywell International (itself the result of a merger of 
Honeywell U.S. and Allied-Signal U.S.) by General Electric (U.S.) in 2001 was something 
of a watershed event in the field of regulatory approval. General Electric’s acquisition of 
Honeywell had been approved by management, ownership, and U.S. regulatory bodies when 
it then sought approval within the European Union. Jack Welch, the charismatic chief execu￾tive officer and president of GE, did not anticipate the degree of opposition that the merger 
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 581 03/05/23 3:02 PM582 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
would face from EU authorities. After a continuing series of demands by the EU that spe￾cific businesses within the combined companies be sold off to reduce anti-competitive effects, 
Welch withdrew the request for acquisition approval, arguing that the liquidations would 
destroy most of the value-enhancing benefits of the acquisition. The acquisition was canceled. 
This case may have far-reaching effects on cross-border M&A for years to come, as the power 
of regulatory authorities within strong economic zones like the EU to block the combination 
of two MNEs may foretell a change in regulatory strength and breadth.
The last act within this second stage of cross-border acquisition, compensation settlement, 
is the payment to shareholders of the target company. Shareholders of the target company 
are typically paid either in shares of the acquiring company or in cash. If a share exchange 
occurs, the exchange is generally defined by some ratio of acquiring company shares to tar￾get company shares (say, two shares of acquirer in exchange for three shares of target), and 
the stockholder is typically not taxed—the shares of ownership are simply replaced by other 
shares in a nontaxable transaction.
If cash is paid to the target company shareholder, it is the same as if the shareholder sold 
the shares on the open market, resulting in a capital gain or loss (a gain, it is hoped, in the 
case of an acquisition) with tax liabilities. Because of the tax ramifications, shareholders are 
typically more receptive to share exchanges so that they may choose whether and when tax 
liabilities will arise.
A variety of factors go into the determination of the type of settlement. The availability 
of cash, the size of the acquisition, the friendliness of the takeover, and the relative valuations 
of both acquiring firm and target firm affect the decision. One of the most destructive forces 
that sometimes arises at this stage is regulatory delay and its impact on the share prices of the 
two firms. If regulatory body approval drags out over time, the possibility of a drop in share 
price increases and can change the attractiveness of the share swap.
Stage 3: Post-Acquisition Transition Management. Although the headlines and flash 
of investment banking activities are typically focused on the valuation and bidding process in 
an acquisition transaction, post-transaction management is probably the most critical of the 
three stages in determining an acquisition’s success or failure. An acquiring firm can pay too 
little or too much, but if the post transaction is not managed effectively, the entire return on 
the investment is squandered. Post-acquisition management is the stage in which the motiva￾tions for the transaction must be realized. The goals of acquisition—such as more effective 
management, synergies arising from the new combination, or the injection of capital at a cost 
and availability previously out of the reach of the acquisition target—must be effectively 
implemented after the transaction. The biggest problem, however, is nearly always melding 
corporate cultures.
The clash of corporate cultures and personalities poses both the biggest risk and the big￾gest potential gain from cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Although not readily measur￾able as are price/earnings ratios or share price premiums, in the end, the value is either gained 
or lost in the hearts and minds of the stakeholders.
Currency Risks in Cross-Border Acquisitions
The pursuit and execution of a cross-border acquisition poses a number of challenging for￾eign currency risks and exposures for an MNE. As illustrated by Exhibit 18.9, the nature of 
the currency exposure related to any specific cross-border acquisition evolves as the bidding 
and negotiating process itself evolves across the bidding, financing, transaction (settlement), 
and operational stages. The assorted risks, in both the timing and information related to the 
various stages of a cross-border acquisition, make the management of the currency exposures 
difficult. As illustrated in Exhibit 18.9, the uncertainty related to the multitude of stages de￾clines over time as stages are completed and contracts and agreements reached.
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 582 03/05/23 3:02 PMCHAPTER 18 Multinational Capital Budgeting and Cross-Border Acquisitions 583
The initial bid, if denominated in a foreign currency, creates a contingent foreign currency 
exposure for the bidder. This contingent exposure grows in certainty of occurrence over time as 
negotiations continue, regulatory requests and approvals are gained, and competitive bidders 
emerge. Although a variety of hedging strategies might be employed, the use of a purchased 
currency call option is the simplest. The option’s notional principal would be for the estimated 
purchase price, but the maturity, for the sake of conservatism, might possibly be significantly 
longer than probably needed to allow for extended bidding, regulatory, and negotiation delays.
Once the bidder has successfully won the acquisition, the exposure evolves from a con￾tingent exposure to a transaction exposure. Although a variety of uncertainties remain as to 
the exact timing of the transaction settlement, the certainty over the occurrence of the cur￾rency exposure is largely eliminated. Some combination of forward contracts and purchased 
currency options may then be used to manage the currency risks associated with the comple￾tion of the cross-border acquisition.
Once consummated, the currency risks and exposures of the cross-border acquisition, 
now a property and foreign subsidiary of the MNE, changes from being a transaction-based 
cash flow exposure to the MNE to part of its multinational structure and therefore part of 
its operating exposure from that time forward. Time, as is always the case involving currency 
exposure management in multinational business, is the greatest challenge to the MNE, as il￾lustrated by Global Finance in Practice 18.3.

Svenska Esso, although Swedish by incorporation, was the 
wholly owned subsidiary of a U.S.-based MNE, Exxon, and 
the final bid and cash settlement on the sale were therefore 
U.S. dollar-denominated.
On March 26, 1985, Statoil and Exxon agreed upon the 
sale of Svenska Esso for USD260 million, or NOK2.47 bil￾lion at the current exchange rate of NOK9.50 = USD1.00. 
(This was by far the weakest the Norwegian krone had ever 
been against the dollar; many analysts believed the dollar to 
be significantly overvalued at the time.) The sale could not 
be consummated without the approval of the Swedish gov￾ernment. That approval process—eventually requiring the 
approval of Swedish Prime Minister Olaf Palme—took nine 
months. Because Statoil considered the U.S. dollar as its 
true operating currency, it chose not to hedge the purchase 
price currency exposure. At the time of settlement, the krone 
had appreciated to NOK7.65 = USD1.00, for a final acqui￾sition cost in Norwegian kroner of NOK1.989 billion. Statoil 
saved nearly 20% on the purchase price, NOK0.481 billion, 
as a result of not hedging.
Statoil of Norway’s Acquisition of Esso of Sweden
Statoil’s acquisition of Svenska Esso (Exxon’s wholly owned 
subsidiary in Sweden) in 1986 was one of the more uniquely 
challenging cross-border acquisitions ever completed. First, 
Statoil was the national oil company of Norway and therefore 
a government-owned and operated business bidding for a 
private company in another country. Second, if completed, 
the acquisition’s proposed financing would increase the fi￾nancial obligations of Svenska Esso (debt levels and debt 
service), reducing the company’s tax liabilities to Sweden. 
The proposed cross-border transaction was characterized 
as a value transfer from the Swedish government to the 
Norwegian government.
As a result of the extended period of bidding, nego￾tiation, and regulatory approvals, the currency risk of the 
transaction was both large and extensive. Statoil, being 
a Norwegian oil company, was a Norwegian krone (NOK)-
based company with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency 
as a result of the global oil industry being dollar-denominated. 
Summary Points
■ Parent cash flows must be distinguished from project 
cash flows. Each of these two types of flows contrib￾utes to a different view of value.
■ Parent cash flows often depend on the form of financ￾ing. Thus, cash flows cannot be clearly separated from 
financing decisions, as is done in domestic capital 
budgeting.
■ Remittance of funds to the parent must be explicitly 
recognized because of differing tax systems, legal and 
political constraints on the movement of funds, local 
business norms, and differences in how financial mar￾kets and institutions function.
■ When a foreign project is analyzed from the project’s 
point of view, risk analysis focuses on the use of sen￾sitivities as well as consideration of foreign exchange 
and political risks associated with the project’s execu￾tion over time.
■ When a foreign project is analyzed from the parent’s 
point of view, the additional risk that stems from its 
“foreign” location can be measured in at least two ways, 
adjusting the discount rates or adjusting the cash flows.
■ Real option analysis is a different way of thinking 
about investment values. At its core, it is a cross be￾tween decision-tree analysis and pure option-based 
valuation. Real option analysis allows us to evaluate 
options, such as whether to defer, abandon, alter the 
size or capacity of, or start up or shut down a project.
■ Project finance is used widely today in the develop￾ment of large-scale infrastructure projects in many 
emerging markets. Although each individual project 
has unique characteristics, most are highly leveraged 
transactions, with debt making up more than 60% of 
the total financing.
■ The process of acquiring an enterprise anywhere in 
the world has three common elements: (1) identifica￾tion and valuation of the target, (2) completion of the 
ownership change transaction (the tender), and (3) 
the management of the post-acquisition transition.
■ Cross-border mergers, acquisitions, and strategic alli￾ances all face similar challenges: they must value the tar￾get enterprise on the basis of its projected performance 
in its market. This process of enterprise valuation com￾bines elements of strategy, management, and finance.

Therefore, the [Arcelor] Board of Directors has 
resolved that it:
1. unanimously rejects Mittal Steel’s unsolicited proposal 
which it considers hostile,
2. recommends to Arcelor’s shareholders not to tender 
their shares into the proposed offer, if and when sub￾mitted,
3. mandates the Management Board to present to the 
Board of Directors all actions and options that are in 
the best interests of all stakeholders.
—“Arcelor Board of Directors Unanimously Rejects 
Mittal’s Hostile Proposal,” press release, Luxembourg, 
January 29, 2006.
The European Union (EU) rarely saw hostile corporate 
takeovers. The structure of corporate ownership and gov￾ernance across most of Europe made gaining control—
without the cooperation of the target firm—exceedingly 
difficult. Despite the challenge, Mittal Steel, the world’s 
largest steel producer, was determined to acquire Arcelor, 
the world’s second-largest steel maker.
Global Steel Consolidation
[There is] a strong relationship in the value created by 
an industry and its degree of consolidation. The steel in￾dustry is very fragmented, much more fragmented than 
some key suppliers like iron ore companies. And much 
more fragmented than some key customers, automotive 
companies for example. It’s very important for us to be 
much more consolidated in the future, not just on a re￾gional basis but also on an intercontinental basis.
—Guy Dollé, CEO, Arcelor.6
The global steel industry in 2006 was surprisingly uncon￾centrated. Mittal Steel and Arcelor were the two largest 
steel manufacturers in the world, Mittal moving into the 
number-one position in 2005. Together the two companies 
produced 110 million tons of steel in 2005, a remarkably 
small 10% of global production.
But consolidation was underway. Arcelor (Luxem￾bourg) itself was the result of a merger of three major 
steel companies from within the EU in 2002—Aceralia of 
Spain, Usinor of France, and Arbed of Luxembourg. That 
merger made it the largest steel maker in the world. And 
Arcelor had also exemplified one of the key drivers for 
consolidation—the capture of cost synergies. In its first 
three years of operation Arcelor reduced global head￾count from 100,000 to under 90,000. Other cost synergies 
of consolidation included overhead, procurement, opera￾tions, and a variety of marketing and logistic functions.
Mittal Steel (Netherlands) too was the result of consoli￾dation. The company’s founder, Lakshmi Mittal, born in In￾dia, started working in his family’s steel business in Indonesia 
when he was only 21 years old. The company grew steadily 
through opportunistic acquisitions of previously state-owned 
and operated steel makers in need of new investment and 
technology. The opportunities were recessions, and Mittal 
seized every opening to acquire. Markets included Canada, 
Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, and Eastern Europe.
Lakshmi Mittal favored aggressive growth. He had 
combined two of his firms, one private (LNM Holdings) and 
one public (Ispat), into a single publicly listed firm, Ispat In￾ternational. In the process, he gained much attention when 
he paid himself a £1 billion pound dividend. In 2005 he ac￾quired a major North American steel company in bankrupt￾cy, ISG. The newly formed firm, Mittal Steel, became the 
largest steel maker in the world, making Mittal the world’s 
third-richest person behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
In 2005, both Arcelor and Nucor (U.S.) began bidding 
to acquire the Canadian steelmaker Dofasco. Dofasco was 
an attractive target: a major producer in the North Ameri￾can market and a non-union workforce, carrying little 
debt. The bidding started at $43 a share and increased, with 
Nucor withdrawing after the entry of ThyssenKrupp (Ger￾many) into the fray. These were unsolicited offers, hostile
offers, as Dofasco was not interested in being acquired and 
would not cooperate with either bidder. Dofasco’s stance 
changed when Arcelor’s offer reached $56. Fearing that 
Arcelor’s offer might be too enticing for shareholders to 
turn down, Dofasco aligned itself with ThyssenKrupp in a 
friendly offer. Both firms continued to raise their bids un￾til Arcelor’s bid of $71. Market analysts believed Arcelor 
would suffer the “winner’s curse”—it had won by paying 
more than the company was worth.
Mittal Bids for Arcelor
This is a great opportunity for us to take the steel indus￾try to the next level. Our customers are becoming global; 
our suppliers are becoming global; everyone is looking 
for a stronger global player.
—Lakshmi Mittal, London, January 27, 2006.

CHAPTER 18 Multinational Capital Budgeting and Cross-Border Acquisitions 585
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 585 03/05/23 3:02 PM586 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
On Friday, January 27, 2006, Mittal Steel shocked global 
markets with an unsolicited offer to acquire Arcelor, the 
largest steel company in Europe and the second-largest 
steel maker in the world. Mittal offered Arcelor share￾holders four Mittal shares plus €35.25 in cash for every five 
shares of Arcelor. The offer valued each Arcelor share at 
€28.21, a 27% premium over Arcelor’s closing share price 
of €22.20 the day before.
Mittal Steel was registered in the Netherlands with 
headquarters in both London and Rotterdam. Mittal’s 
core sales were in basic steel products generating vol￾ume growth at relatively low margins. Although publicly 
traded in Amsterdam and New York, the company was 
controlled by the Mittal family with its 88% interest. Lak￾shmi was CEO and chairman, his son managing director 
and CFO. Mittal had a major presence in America, Cen￾tral Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa, Kazakhstan, and a 
share of Western Europe.
Arcelor was headquartered in Luxembourg City. Its 
current CEO was Guy Dollé, with Joseph Kinsch as chair￾man. Employing 110,000, Arcelor specialized in high￾margin, high-grade steel products for the construction 
and automobile industries. The company’s major markets 
were Western Europe and America, with a small pres￾ence in Eastern Europe and Asia. The company was listed 
on stock exchanges in Brussels, Luxembourg, Paris, and 
Madrid. Exhibit A provides a brief overview of the two 
firms’ financials.
Lakshmi Mittal first approached Guy Dollé of Ar￾celor at a private dinner at Mittal’s mansion in Lon￾don on January 13 at the suggestion of Lakshmi’s son. 
Mittal suggested looking into combining the two com￾panies. According to Dollé, “There was no discussion, 
there was no offer. There was a discussion of four min￾utes at the end of an aperitif. A company worth up to 
€40 billion in revenues deserves more than a four-min￾ute conversation.”7 Dollé did relay to Mittal that, in his 
opinion, 75% to 80% of all mergers fail because of cul￾tural differences. Two weeks later Mittal called Dollé to 
inform him Mittal would be announcing a public tender 
offer for Arcelor.
What makes this deal unique is that this is the steel sec￾tor. Until very recently, this business was protected by the 
governments and no one thought that companies could 
make hostile takeover offers on this scale, despite the fact 
that the sector was in the process of consolidation.

champion (a message they pushed with all European gov￾ernment leaders in the weeks following the offer). Mittal 
saw great opportunities for cost synergies, potentially re￾ducing combined operating costs by more than $1 billion.
The Mittal team’s experience with acquisitions al￾lowed it to anticipate deal barriers. The most common 
political barrier was job losses; Mittal promised to deliver 
all cost reductions without plant closures or job losses in 
Arcelor’s plants. The second-most common hurdle was 
regulatory concern over growing monopoly power. Mittal 
believed the two companies had little overlap in products 
or markets. There was one possible problem: Arcelor’s ac￾quisition of Dofasco. So on the same day he announced 
Mittal’s bid for Arcelor, he offered to sell Dofasco to Thys￾senKrupp at the last price Thyssen had bid, $68 per share.
EU Takeover Law
The market for corporate control has always operated un￾der different sets of rules across countries. The U.S. and 
the UK have long enjoyed very open and unrestricted 
markets, in which creeping acquisitions and hostile take￾overs are commonplace. These are markets in which the 
ownership of publicly traded companies is relatively wide, 
with few individual investors or organizations holding 
large and influential shares of the companies. Sharehold￾ers in these markets may be described more as investors 
than owners, as their primary interest is in their financial 
returns.
Continental Europe is characterized by companies that 
are heavily led by concentrated power—singular owners, 
families, groups linked through shareholder agreements, or 
even pyramid structures of indirect influence. Governments 
keep a watchful eye on acquisitions and restructurings that 
might possibly reduce employment or competition. Con￾centrated ownership and nationalistic tendencies made 
creeping acquisitions and hostile takeovers rare. Concen￾trated ownership also meant that owners valued control, 
something that shareholders in the U.S. or UK placed less 
value on as they generally held less influence.
The EU had struggled to foster an active cross-border 
market for corporate control for years. A new effort resulted 
in the EU Takeover Directive of 2004. The directive was in￾tended to harmonize EU takeover law and kick-start con￾solidation of EU companies in pursuit of greater internal effi￾ciency and external competitiveness. Modeled after the UK's 
takeover code, it suffered massive change and dilution in its 
path to adoption. In the end, it contained three provisions 
fundamental to takeover laws globally: (1) equal treatment 
of shareholders, particularly minority shareholders; (2) access 
to information to allow informed decisions on bids; and (3) 
restrictions and prohibitions on market manipulation.
The final EU framework focused on the mandatory 
bid rule. The EU believed it would ensure fair and equita￾ble treatment for all shareholders in the event of a change 
in control. The directive failed, however, to gain EU-wide 
agreement on two other principles, the board neutrality 
rule and the breakthrough rules. The board neutrality rule
prohibits the supervisory board of a target firm from tak￾ing any “frustrating actions” against a potential acquirer 
once a bid has been announced. (The rule does allow 
boards to seek out alternative bids.) In theory it requires 
the target board to remain neutral. The breakthrough rules
prohibit clauses in corporate articles of association that 
restrict the ability of target company shareholders from 
tendering their shares or voting at shareholder meetings.
Those EU members that did not have existing take￾over codes were now to adopt the principles of the EU 
Takeover Directive. France and Belgium already had 
codes; Luxembourg—Arcelor’s home—did not. Luxem￾bourg had until the end of May to adopt its own version of 
the EU directive.
Arcelor—and Europe—Fights Back
It’s not an Indian company per se, it’s a company of In￾dians, in particular by Mr Mittal’s family; most of the 
positions on the management committee are held by 
Indians, and the company’s specialty; when it makes an 
acquisition, is generally to send in a dozen or so Indians 
to improve plant operations.
—Guy Dollé, CEO, Arcelor
Arcelor’s immediate reaction to Mittal’s bid was a clear 
no, as seen in Arcelor’s press release (page 1). Within days 
the hostile bid, or “unsolicited offer” as Lakshmi Mittal 
preferred to call it, sparked pan-European debate. With 
80% of Arcelor’s shares in free float, Mittal had a very 
good chance of convincing at least 50% of Arcelor’s share￾holders to back the deal at an attractive price.
As opposed to Lakshmi Mittal’s low-key, unassuming 
personality, Guy Dollé was known to be both emotional 
and unpredictable. In Dollé’s first interview following the 
announcement he described Mittal Steel as a “company 
full of Indians” seeking to buy Arcelor with monnaie de 
singe, a French term for monopoly money, small change, or 
peanuts as in “monkey money.”8 He went on to character￾ize Mittal as a crude maker of commodity steel, plebeian 
eau de cologne compared to Arcelor’s aristocratic perfume.
If this raid succeeds, it will bring down one of the rare 
edifices of industrial Europe, proving that no position is 
secure any longer in a world of global competition.
—Le Monde, January 29, 2006.

 Mittal Steel did indeed depend on a strong engineering core recruited from India that was willing to work hard for lower wages. 
Management, however, was not all from India. Of Mittal’s 17 regional managers, nine held Indian passports. Mittal Steel had no opera￾tions in India.
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 587 03/05/23 3:02 PM588 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
Dollé saw the proposed combination as an impos￾sible force fit of two very different business cultures. He 
described Arcelor as the “embodiment of the European 
social model,” as opposed to “the Indians” being like “the 
Airbus of the steel industry.” The French minister of fi￾nance believed that Arcelor should have a “European 
character” although acknowledging that steel was not one 
of France’s protected strategic industries despite Arcelor 
employing 30,000 people in France.9
 Dollé believed Mit￾tal to be out of step with European governance practices. 
Under Mittal’s proposal, since Lakshmi Mittal’s shares 
held two votes per share, he would maintain control of the 
combined company with more than 50% of the owner￾ship rights and 64% of the voting rights. But Arcelor was 
a Luxembourg company, a country prohibiting dual voting 
shares.
It is not about the money. . . . No, we want to remain a 
strategic partner in a European company with a Europe￾an social dimension, in a European environment and a 
European concept of governance, with its headquarters 
in Luxembourg.
—Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, 
January 30, 2006.
Governments Respond. Within hours of the unsolicited bid, 
governments responded. The French minister of finance 
explained directly to Lakshmi Mittal that “this is not how 
things are done in continental Europe.” He did not be￾lieve that Mittal respected what the French call la gram￾maire des affaires—normal business practices. A large part 
of that grammar was a detailed explanation of the take￾over—before the bid. The Luxembourg, French, and Bel￾gian governments could also be seen as walking a fine line 
between the past, in which hostile acquisitions were not 
tolerated, and the present, an integrated set of countries 
that espoused the benefits of globalization but still strug￾gled to free up the movement of capital and opportunity.
France, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg were hosts 
to most of Arcelor’s operations but had limited powers 
to stop the hostile acquisition. The primary barrier to EC 
approval would be on competition grounds. Technically, 
the proposal would have to be approved by the European 
Commission (EC) before Mittal could offer it to share￾holders. The EC committed to evaluating the proposal 
only on the basis of competition.
There were five key events in the coming months in￾strumental to the takeover approval: (1) earnings releases 
for both companies—February 15; (2) the EC’s ruling on 
the bid—probably in April; (3) Arcelor’s annual share￾holder general meeting, including the reelection of the 
board—April 28; and (4) Luxembourg’s adoption of a 
takeover code—by May 20. Arcelor believed it would have 
the upper hand in each.
Arcelor’s Defense Strategy. Arcelor began gathering a 
massive defense team. The team proposed a value-based 
defense, one based on how the two businesses could not 
thrive under one roof. The company’s consultants pro￾posed a regulatory arbitrage defense, to leverage the many 
regulators across countries that needed to approve the 
deal. Arcelor’s legal counsel, however, cautioned Arcelor’s 
leadership that it could not take any direct action to stop 
the takeover attempt; that would be seen as management 
acting against the interests of shareholders.
Corporate Governance. Unlike most European multina￾tionals, 88% of Arcelor’s shares were in free float, traded 
on the open market. The two single largest shareholders 
were the Luxembourg government with 5.6% and the 
Aristrain family of Spain with 3.6%. Given that part of 
the Mittal offer was in shares, Mittal’s record in growing 
share prices came into question. Mittal had grown rapidly 
through acquisitions, generating returns for Mittal family 
members but minor returns for shareholders. Arcelor’s 
own share price performance was similarly underwhelm￾ing. In fact, Mittal’s offer had caused the largest increase 
in the share price in years. Arcelor was also tight with divi￾dends; shareholders were described as “cash-starved.”
Arcelor was widely held, Mittal was not. Mittal used a 
two-tier voting structure of A and B class shares. A shares, 
those held by the public, had one vote per share. B shares, 
67% of which were held by the Mittal family, had 10 votes 
per share. The Mittal family controlled 98% of the votes. 
Lakshmi Mittal was told he would have to give ground 
on governance and control. He now countered with new 
promises: the headquarters of the merged group would be 
kept in Luxembourg, and there would be no layoffs.
Arcelor believed the company was protected by its 
corporate charter requiring offers to be all cash. But when 
the legal team examined the code, they discovered a very 
important condition. If a predator had accumulated 30% 
of Arcelor’s shares in a creeping acquisition, then it was 
required to make an all-cash offer. But Mittal had not ac￾cumulated any significant shareholdings in Arcelor.
Luxembourg allowed companies to undertake de￾fensive measures like poison pills without the approval of 
shareholders. A spokesman for the EC did not find it sur￾prising or significant: “We don’t believe this really changes 
anything on the ground. Already there is a certain leeway 
to use national laws for poison pill defenses.”10 Nationalist 
concerns had always been strong in Europe, even across EU 
members. For example, France had identified certain indus￾tries as being “strategic assets” including yogurt-making.

On February 15, Arcelor released its earnings for 
2005, all of which was good news. Total turnover was up 
8% to €32.6 billion, but group profits were up 68% to €3.85 
billion. In a surprising move, the company doubled the 
dividend, from €0.65 to €1.25 per share. The next day Mit￾tal reported 2005 results, showing large gains in turnover, 
from $22 billion to $28 billion, but a decrease of 28% in 
profits, to $3.36 billion.
Arcelor Goes on the Defensive. On April 4, Arcelor an￾nounced a new series of defensive actions.
■ First, it transferred control of the recently acquired 
Dofasco of Canada to a newly formed Dutch foun￾dation, Strategic Steel Stichting. The stichting trust, 
a unique organizational creation under Dutch law, 
would control any ownership changes for five years. 
Its three-member Arcelor-appointed board held sole 
discretion over any ownership changes.11 Mittal’s 
plan to sell Dofasco to ThyssenKrupp of Germany to 
avoid antitrust issues in the U.S. now appeared moot.
■ Secondly, Arcelor increased its dividend—again. With 
Arcelor’s high free float, it knew that the acquisition 
premium offered by Mittal would be attractive. Ar￾celor announced it would increase its dividend from 
€1.25/share to €1.85/share for 2006, an 85% increase.
■ Third, the company committed to returning more cash 
flow to shareholders via a proposed share buyback 
program totaling €6.6 billion. This would theoretically 
increase Arcelor’s share price and simultaneously 
reduce the number of shares and votes outstanding. 
This would require shareholder approval.
By late April, it appeared that management’s ac￾tions were gaining traction with shareholders. On April 
28, shareholders voted to retain Arcelor’s current board. 
This was not overly surprising since fewer than 35% of its 
shareholders attended or sent representatives to share￾holder meetings. Arcelor was confident in its ability to 
manage its shareholders. But then the tide started turning.
On May 4, Luxembourg adopted its new takeover law, 
choosing to take a very pro-open approach to takeovers, 
wishing to retain its image as an open financial center 
rather than a restrictive, protectionist, anti-takeover duchy. 
Arcelor would gain no protection from the directive. The 
EC’s analysis of the combination yielded only minor ob￾jections, allowing Mittal to proceed with its offer. The next 
day the U.S. SEC found that the Dofasco stichting struc￾ture was not an issue as far as it was concerned.
On May 18, Mittal formally launched its takeover 
bid. The bid would remain open for 35 working days, until 
June 29. The following day Mittal increased its bid, offer￾ing shareholders a choice—either one share in the new 
combined company plus €11.10 in cash for each Arcelor 
share or €37.74 in cash for each Arcelor share. The offer 
constituted a 70% premium over Arcelor’s closing share 
price the day before the first Mittal offer on January 27. 
The offer value was now €22.7billion. Lakshmi Mittal 
also agreed to lower his interest in the combined com￾pany to less than 50%. Belgium now openly supported 
the Mittal bid, while both Luxembourg and France said 
that it was up to Arcelor’s shareholders to decide. Arce￾lor still had one tool at its disposal: the right to issue an 
additional 30% in shares to the market without share￾holder approval.
The Russian White Knight. On May 26, Arcelor unexpect￾edly announced that it would merge with the largest steel 
and mining firm in Russia, OAO Severstal. The company 
was controlled by Alexei Mordashov, a Russian oligarch, a 
Russian businessman who gained power and wealth dur￾ing the post-Soviet privatization of the 1990s.12 His politi￾cal ties were strong; he had already consulted with Russian 
President Putin.
Under the Severstal proposal, Arcelor would pur￾chase the 90% share in Severstal held by Mordashov, who 
would use that money (plus additional debt) to take a 32% 
share of Arcelor. He could not acquire additional shares 
for a minimum of four years. This prevented the deal from 
triggering Luxembourg’s definition of a corporate take￾over. And he was restricted for five years from selling any 
of his shares. Severstal would have six of the 18 board seats 
and included a €140 million breakup fee to Mordashov if 
the deal failed. Arcelor’s CEO and chairman would both 
keep their jobs under the merger agreement.
Arcelor’s board formally rejected Mittal’s revised 
offer on June 11. The following day Arcelor’s board rec￾ommended to shareholders that they accept the Severstal 
merger proposal. Arcelor’s press release stated:
“[H]aving consulted Morgan Stanley on the financial 
aspects of Mittal Steel’s revised offer, the board has 
unanimously concluded that Mittal Steel’s current of￾fer is inadequate as it continues to undervalue Arcelor; 
the Severstal transaction is a more attractive alternative 
from a strategic, financial and social point of view.”
Arcelor’s planned share buyback plan now became 
much more significant. Arcelor would buy back 150 million 
11 A stichting (foundation in English) is a Dutch special purpose legal entity with limited liability but possessing no share capital. The 
structure separated ownership and control. During the World War II Dutch companies transferred ownership to stichtings based in the 
Netherlands Antilles (Caribbean) in an effort to protect them from German occupiers.
12 Mordashov often used an analogy to characterize his meteoric rise to power. “I was at the rear of the camel train heading across the 
desert when the train turned on itself and I found myself at the front.”
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 589 03/05/23 3:02 PM590 PART 5 Foreign Investments and Investment Analysis
of its own shares from current shareholders (the open 
market) at €44 each, a substantial premium over Arcelor’s 
current share price of €33. Mordashov’s share of Arcelor 
would, as a result, rise to 38%. This would be above the 
33.3% mandatory bid threshold under Luxembourg law. 
Luxembourg quickly waived its mandatory bid rule on the 
Severstal merger.
Arcelor scheduled the shareholder vote on Severstal 
for June 19. The vote would be unusual. Instead of asking 
shareholders to approve the merger, shareholders would 
have to explicitly vote no on the deal to stop the deal, a 
veto-vote. Arcelor shareholders found the Severstal pro￾posal difficult to understand, suggesting that it was an 
“anti-Mittal” strategy and not a strategy for growth. Sev￾erstal now revised its offer to reduce its share in Arcelor 
from 32% to 25%. Mordashov promised not to go over 
33% in the future without making a tender offer for the 
entire firm.
Shareholders had until July 5 to tender their shares 
to Mittal Steel. The shareholder vote on Severstal was re￾scheduled from June 19 to June 30. A Luxembourg court 
then declared Arcelor’s share buyback plan illegal, cancel￾ing the buyback vote on June 21. Shareholders would vote 
on the Mittal offer on June 26.
The Deal
Arcelor and Mittal continued their discussions, now in ear￾nest, as shareholder and governmental pressures increased. 
Mittal, in a final push to secure an agreement, increased its 
offer to €40.37 per share. Mittal’s final accepted offer was a 
combination of cash and shares: 13 Mittal shares + €150.60 
in cash in exchange for 12 Arcelor shares, or €40.37 per 
share. Mittal’s share price at that time was €25.68. On June 
25 an agreement was announced. Arcelor’s board would 
recommend shareholders approve the Mittal offer.
MINI-CASE QUESTIONS
1. What is the core value proposition that Mittal Steel

Questions
18.1 Capital Budgeting Theoretical Framework. Capital 
budgeting for a foreign project uses the same 
theoretical framework as domestic capital budgeting. 
What are the basic steps in domestic capital 
budgeting?
18.2 Foreign Complexities. Capital budgeting for a foreign 
project is considerably more complex than the domes￾tic case. What are the factors that add complexity?
18.3 Sensitivity Analysis. What is sensitivity analysis? 
How do firms use sensitivity analysis to assess vari￾ous types of risks inherent in investment decisions? 
18.4 Viewpoint and Net Present Value. Which viewpoint, 
project or parent, gives results closer to the tradi￾tional meaning of net present value (NPV) in capi￾tal budgeting?
18.5 Viewpoint and Consolidated Earnings. Which view￾point gives results closer to the effect on consoli￾dated earnings per share?
18.6 Operating and Financing Cash Flows. Capital proj￾ects provide both operating cash flows and financial 
cash flows. Why are operating cash flows preferred for 
domestic capital budgeting but financial cash flows 
given major consideration in international projects?
18.7 Risk-Adjusted Return. Should the anticipated in￾ternal rate of return (IRR) for a proposed foreign 
project be compared to (a) alternative home coun￾try proposals, (b) returns earned by local companies 
in the same industry and/or risk class, or (c) both? 
Justify your answer.
18.8 Blocked Cash Flows. When evaluating a potential 
foreign investment, how would inflation in the host 
country affect a multinational firm’s decision to in￾vest in that nation? Would blocked cash flows also 
affect the firm’s decisions? 
18.9 Host Country Inflation. How does host country in￾flation impact the operations of MNEs? How can 
MNEs mitigate these effects?
18.10 Cost of Equity. A foreign subsidiary does not have 
an independent cost of capital. However, in order 
to estimate the discount rate for a comparable host￾country firm, the analyst should try to calculate a 
hypothetical cost of capital. How is this done?

18.1 Finisterra, S.A. Finisterra, S.A., located in the state of 
Baja California, Mexico, manufactures frozen Mexican 
food, which enjoys a large following in the U.S. states 
of California and Arizona to the north. In order to be 
closer to its U.S. market, Finisterra is considering mov￾ing some of its manufacturing operations to southern 
California. Operations in California would begin in 
year 1 and have the following attributes.

The operations in California will pay 80% of its 
accounting profit to Finisterra as an annual cash div￾idend. Mexican taxes are calculated on grossed up 
dividends from foreign countries, with a credit for 
host-country taxes already paid. What is the maxi￾mum U.S. dollar price Finisterra should offer in year 
1 for the investment?
18.2 Schism Systems. Schism Systems Inc. manufactures 
design components for personal computers. Until 
the present, manufacturing has been subcontracted 
to other companies, but for reasons of quality con￾trol Schism has decided to manufacture itself in Asia. 
Analysis has narrowed the choice to two possibili￾ties, Penang, Malaysia, and Manila, the Philippines.
At the moment only the summary of expected, 
after-tax, cash flows displayed below is available. 
Although most operating outflows would be in Ma￾laysian ringgit or Philippine pesos, some additional 
U.S. dollar cash outflows (expenses) would be nec￾essary, also shown in the table. The Malaysia ringgit 
currently trades at MYR4.20 = USD1.00 and the 
Philippine peso trades at PHP50.00 = USD1.00. 
Schism expects the Malaysian ringgit to appreciate 
2.0% per year against the dollar, and the Philippine 
peso to depreciate 5.0% per year against the dollar. 
If the weighted average cost of capital for Schism 
Systems is 14.0%, which project looks most promis￾ing on the basis of present value?

18.3 Grenouille Properties. Grenouille Properties (U.S.) 
expects to receive cash dividends from a French 
joint venture over the coming three years. The 
first dividend, to be paid one year from now on 
December 31, is expected to be €720,000. The divi￾dend is then expected to grow 10.0% per year over 
the following two years. The current exchange rate 
is $1.1940 = €1.00. Grenouille’s weighted average 
cost of capital is 12%.
a. What is the present value of the expected euro 
dividend stream if the euro is expected to appre￾ciate 4.00% per annum against the dollar?

18.4 Natural Mosaic. Natural Mosaic Company (U.S.) 
is considering investing INR50,000,000 in India to 
create a wholly owned tile manufacturing plant to 
export to the European market. After five years, 
the subsidiary would be sold to Indian investors for 
INR100,000,000. A pro forma income statement 
for the Indian operation predicts the generation of 
INR7,000,000 of annual cash flow, is listed in the fol￾lowing table.

The initial investment will be made on December 
31, 2021, and cash flows will occur on December 
31 of each succeeding year. Annual cash dividends 
to Natural Mosaic from India will equal 75% of 
accounting income. The U.S. corporate tax rate is 
21% and the Indian corporate tax rate is 25%. Be￾cause the Indian tax rate is greater than the U.S. 
tax rate, annual dividends paid to Natural Mosaic 
will not be subject to additional taxes in the United 
States. There are no capital gains taxes on the fi￾nal sale. Natural Mosaic uses a weighted average 
cost of capital of 14% on domestic investments but 
will add six percentage points for the Indian invest￾ment because of perceived greater risk. Natural 
Mosaic forecasts the Indian rupee to U.S. dollar ex￾change rate for December 31 on the next six years

18.5 Carambola de Honduras. Slinger Wayne, a U.S.-based 
private equity firm, is trying to determine what it 
should pay for a tool manufacturing firm in Honduras 
named Carambola. Slinger Wayne estimates that 
Carambola will generate a free cash flow of 13 million 
Honduran lempiras (Lp) next year (2022) and that 
this free cash flow will continue to grow at a constant 
rate of 8.0% per annum indefinitely.
A private equity firm like Slinger Wayne, how￾ever, is not interested in owning a company for long, 
and plans to sell Carambola at the end of three years 
for approximately 10 times Carambola’s free cash 
flow in that year. The current spot exchange rate is, 
Lp23.90=$1.00, but the Honduran inflation rate is 
expected to remain at a relatively high rate of 16.0% 
per annum compared to the U.S. dollar inflation rate 
of only 2.0% per annum. Slinger Wayne expects to 
earn at least a 20% annual rate of return on interna￾tional investments like Carambola.
a. What is Carambola worth if the Honduran lem￾pira were to remain fixed over the three-year 
investment period?
b. What is Carambola worth if the Honduran lem￾pira were to change in value over time according 
to purchasing power parity?
18.6 Wenceslas Refining Company. Privately owned 
Wenceslas Refining Company is considering in￾vesting in the Czech Republic so as to have a re￾finery source closer to its European customers. The 
original investment in Czech korunas (CZK) would 
amount to CZK250 million, or USD11,627,907 at the 
current exchange rate of CZK21.50 = USD1.00, all 
in fixed assets, which will be depreciated over 10 
years by the straight-line method. An additional 
CZK100,000,000 will be needed for working capi￾tal. Wenceslas does not believe it can forecast ex￾change rates so assumes they will remain fixed at 
the current spot rate over the entire period.
For capital budgeting purposes Wenceslas as￾sumes sale as a going concern at the end of the third 
year at a price, after all taxes, equal to the net book 
value of fixed assets alone (not including working 
capital). All free cash flow, basically net income, will 
be repatriated to the United States as a dividend 
each year. In evaluating the venture, the U.S. dollar 
forecasts are shown in the following table.
M18_EITE5960_16_GE_C18.indd 592 03/05/23 3:02 PMCHAPTER 18 Multinational Capital Budgeting and Cross-Border Acquisitions 593
Variable manufacturing costs are expected to be 50% 
of sales. No additional funds need be invested in the U.S. 
subsidiary during the period under consideration. The 
Czech Republic imposes no restrictions on repatriation of 
any funds of any sort. The Czech corporate tax rate is 19% 
and the United States rate is 21%. Both countries allow a 
tax credit for taxes paid in other countries. Wenceslas uses 
12% as its cost of capital, and its objective is to maximize 
present value.
Is the investment attractive to Wenceslas Refining?
Hermosa Beach Components (U.S.)
Use the following information and assumptions to answer 
Problems 18.7–18.10.
Hermosa Beach Components, Inc., of California ex￾ports 24,000 sets of low-density light bulbs per year to Ar￾gentina under an import license that expires in five years. 
In Argentina, the bulbs are sold for the Argentine peso 
equivalent of $60 per set. Direct manufacturing costs in 
the United States and shipping together amount to $40 per 
set. The market for this type of bulb in Argentina is stable, 
neither growing nor shrinking, and Hermosa holds the ma￾jor portion of the market.
The Argentine government has invited Hermosa to 
open a manufacturing plant so imported bulbs can be 
replaced by local production. If Hermosa makes the in￾vestment, it will operate the plant for five years and then 
sell the building and equipment to Argentine investors at 
net book value at the time of sale plus the value of any 
net working capital. (Net working capital is the amount 
of current assets less any portion financed by local debt.) 
Hermosa will be allowed to repatriate all net income and 
depreciation funds to the United States each year. Her￾mosa traditionally evaluates all foreign investments in U.S. 
dollar terms.
■ Investment. Hermosa’s anticipated cash outlay in 
U.S. dollars in 2012 would be as follows:
Building and equipment $1,000,000
Net working capital $1,000,000
Total investment $2,000,000
All investment outlays will be made in 2012, and all 
operating cash flows will occur at the end of years 
2013 through 2017.
■ Depreciation and Investment Recovery. Building and 
equipment will be depreciated over five years on a 
straight-line basis. At the end of the fifth year, the 
$1,000,000 of net working capital may also be repa￾triated to the United States, as may the remaining net 
book value of the plant.
■ Sales Price of Bulbs. Locally manufactured bulbs 
will be sold for the Argentine peso equivalent of $60 
per set.
■ Operating Expenses per Set of Bulbs. Material pur￾chases are as follows:
Materials purchased in Argentina 
(U.S. dollar equivalent)
$20 per set
Materials imported from Hermosa 
Beach (U.S.)
10 per set
Total variable costs $30 per set
■ Transfer Prices. The $10 transfer price per set for raw 
material sold by the parent consists of $5 of direct and 
indirect costs incurred in the United States on their 
manufacture, creating $5 of pre-tax profit to Hermosa 
Beach.

■ Taxes. The corporate income tax rate is 28% in both 
Argentina and the United States (combined federal 
and state/province). There are no capital gains taxes 
on the future sale of the Argentine subsidiary, either 
in Argentina or the United States.
■ Discount Rate. Hermosa Components uses a 15% 
discount rate to evaluate all domestic and foreign 
projects.
18.7 Hermosa Components: Baseline Analysis. Evaluate 
the proposed investment in Argentina by Hermosa 
Components (U.S.). Hermosa’s management wishes 
the baseline analysis to be performed in U.S. dol￾lars (and implicitly also assumes the exchange rate 
remains fixed throughout the life of the project). 
Create a project viewpoint capital budget and a par￾ent viewpoint capital budget. What do you conclude 
from your analysis?
18.8 Hermosa Components: Revenue Growth Scenario.
As a result of their analysis in Problem 18.7, 
Hermosa wishes to explore the implications of 
being able to grow sales volume by 4% per year. 
Argentine inflation is expected to average 5% per 
year, so sales price and material cost increases of 
7% and 6% per year, respectively, are thought rea￾sonable. Although material costs in Argentina are 
expected to rise, U.S.-based costs are not expected 
to change over the five-year period. Evaluate this 
scenario for both the project and parent viewpoints. 
Is the project under this revenue growth scenario 
acceptable?
18.9 Hermosa Components: Revenue Growth and Sales 
Price Scenario. In addition to the assumptions em￾ployed in Problem 18.8, Hermosa now wishes to eval￾uate the prospect of being able to sell the Argentine 
subsidiary at the end of year 5 at a multiple of the 
business’s earnings in that year. Hermosa believes 
that a multiple of six is a conservative estimate of the 
market value of the firm at that time. Evaluate the 
project and parent viewpoint capital budgets.
18.10 Hermosa Components: Revenue Growth, Sales Price, 
and Currency Risk Scenario. Melinda Deane, a new 
analyst at Hermosa and a recent MBA graduate, be￾lieves that it is a fundamental error to evaluate the 
Argentine project’s prospective earnings and cash 
flows in dollars, rather than first estimating their 
Argentine peso (Ps) value and then converting cash 
flow returns to the United States in dollars. She be￾lieves the correct method is to use the end-of-year 
spot rate in 2012 of Ps3.50 = $1.00 and assume it 
will change in relation to purchasing power. (She 
is assuming U.S. inflation to be 1% per annum and 
Argentine inflation to be 5% per annum.) She also 
believes that Hermosa should use a risk-adjusted dis￾count rate in Argentina which reflects Argentine cap￾ital costs (20% is her estimate) and a risk-adjusted 
discount rate for the parent viewpoint capital budget 
(18%) on the assumption that international projects 
in a risky currency environment should require a 
higher expected return than other lower-risk proj￾ects. How do these assumptions and changes alter 
Hermosa’s perspective on the proposed investment?
