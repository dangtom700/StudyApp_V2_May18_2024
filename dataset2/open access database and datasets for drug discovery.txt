Series Editors Preface
The work of natural scientists in all scientific disciplines has changed a lot in the
recent decade. Access to information and data in scientific databases has become
essential for effective and efficient work. In addition to the commercial databases
from professional providers, open access databases from associations and institutes
have also become increasingly popularfor medicinal chemistsin academia and phar￾maceutical industry.
The latest volume of our book series entitled “Open Access Databases and Datasets
for Drug Discovery” provides an exemplary overview of some of the most important
databases and applications that should be of great help to the medicinal chemistry
community as information source and motivation to explore the growing and exist￾ing field of open access databases and useful datasets. The book surely will support
all type of scientists working in the field of drug discovery and medicinal chemistry
who need information from databases to support their work.
It allstarted in the late 2010s when Raimund Mannhold suggested thistopic in our
annual editor meetings as a long-cherished heart’s desire. And in 2019 he was suc￾cessful to convince Antoine Daina and Vincent Zoete, who are well-known scientists
in this field, to edit such a book.
After industrial practice as computational chemist for agrochemical research and
academic experience as lecturer and researcher in drug discovery, Antoine joined
the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in 2012. He is now senior scientist in
the Molecular Modeling Group in charge of methodological developments in the
SwissDrugDesign program, of supporting drug discovery projects and of teaching
computer-aided drug design.
Vincent joined the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in 2004. He was the asso￾ciate group leader of the SIB Molecular Modeling Group until 2017 and then group
leader from 2017 until now. Besides this, Vincent is Associate Professor in molecu￾lar modeling at the University of Lausanne since 2022 and coordinator/developer
of SwissDock.ch, SwissParam.ch, SwissBioisostere.ch, SwissTargetPrediction.ch,
SwissSimilarity.ch, and SwissADME.ch.
The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics hosting the Click2Drug Webpage provides
the most comprehensive collection of worldwide available databases and application
tools in the field of drug discovery.xiv Series Editors Preface
At the same time Helmut Buschmann remembered his old colleague Michael
Przewosny from ourtime together at Grünenthal GmbH located in Aachen. Michael
has over 20 years of experience in pharmaceutical research and drug discovery.
He held several positions as laboratory manager in medicinal chemistry and
process development. Michael has created a competitive intelligence department at
Grünenthal in Aachen, where he was responsible for such database and application
tools as service for the entire research organization. It took some time to convince
Michael for such a book assignment, but finally he was motivated to join the group
of Antoine and Vincent.
Together they brought many years of experience in the development of such
databases, reinforced by many years of experience in using such databases in the
field of drug discovery.
Jointly Antoine,Vincent, and Michaelstarted in late 2019 with a collection of ideas
and agreed after long discussions on a useful structure of such a broad research area
with an enormous rapid development.
After a successful start, there was now a long, rocky, and chaotic road ahead of
them accompanied by the Covid pandemic. There were many disappointments, but
they never gave up. They worked very hard and were always successful to find a way
forward. Then another major setback followed. Raimund died unexpectedly after a
short illness on October 14, 2022, and was not able to see the successful completion.
We, the series editors and the publisher, are all the more pleased that the editors
have dedicated this volume to his memory. Raimund accompanied the book series
from the first volume published early as 1993 until his death and was able to enjoy
the publishing of volume 81 in June 2022 “Flow and Microreactor Technology in
Medicinal Chemistry” edited by Esther Alza, shortly before he passed away.
The editors managed to edit a book with the support of the best authorsin the field
to provide the interested reader with a detailed overview of open-access databases
and datasetsfor drugsfrom early to late phases of the lengthy drug discovery process.
In such rapidly growing research field, the picture of open databases and datasets
remains always incomplete.
It is all the more important that the authors managed to edit a volume that depicts
a wide variety of resources from the most generalist to most specialized ones. Such a
volume can never be a complete and encyclopedic collection of all existing databases,
but it acts much more like guidance and motivation to deal with such databases and
the resulting possibilities. In different chaptersthe mostrelevant tools and databases
and apps are described by explaining case studies and examples to get an easy and
direct introduction to use these tools.
Antoine, Vincent, and Michael have managed with great passion to persuade
and encourage the authors to provide as much practical advice as possible with
step-by-step guides and helpful use cases for the interested reader of all disciplines
involved in drug hunting, bringing new, powerful, and safe medicines to the
patients. The selected and compiled data collection of databases and apps provides
a strong comprehensive basis as a kind of guided tour through the very dense jungle
of public available scientific information.Series Editors Preface xv
The editors have structured the guidance book in 3 thematic sections and
10 chapters. Antoine, Vincent, and Michael have not only edited the book but
also contributed with their long experience and great knowledge as authors and
co-authors of some of the chapters.
As a general introduction to the volume edited by Antoine andVincent themselves
with the support of their coworkers, a comprehensive overview to the topic and a
rich annotated list of data sources entitled “Open Access Databases and Datasets for
Computer-Aided Drug Design. A Short List Used in the Molecular Modelling Group
of the SIB” is provided. The core of the book presented in part I and II consists of
seven diverse and high-quality resources presented by their developers, categorized
in small molecules or macromolecular targets and diseases.
Part I is dedicated to small molecules and contains three chapters describing the
most popular databases in this field:
● PubChem: A Large-Scale Public Chemical Database for Drug Discovery, edited by
Sunghwan Kim and Evan E. Bolton.
● DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide, edited by Christen M. Klinger, Jordan Cox,
Denise So, Teira Stauth, Michael Wilson, Alex Wilson, and Craig Knox
● Bioisosteric Replacement for Drug Discovery Supported by the SwissBioisostere
Database, edited by Antoine Daina, Alessandro Cuozzo, Marta A.S. Perez, and
Vincent Zoete
Part II focuses on macromolecular targets and diseases comprising the following
chapters:
● The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting
Computer-Aided Drug Design, edited by David Armstrong,John Berrisford, Preeti
Choudhary, Lukas Pravda, James Tolchard, Mihaly Varadi, and Sameer Velankar
● The SWISS-MODEL Repository of 3D Protein Structures and Models, edited
by Xavier Robin, Andrew Waterhouse, Stefan Bienert, Gabriel Studer, Leila T.
Alexander, Gerardo Tauriello, Torsten Schwede, and Joana Pereira
● PDB-REDO inComputational-Aided Drug Design (CADD), edited by Ida deVries,
Anastassis Perrakis, and Robbie P. Joosten

Raimund Mannhold – A Personal Obituary from the Series
Editors
Source: http://www.raimund-mannhold.de/curriculum-vitae/
Raimund Mannhold died on October 14, 2022, after a short and serious illness at
the age of 74. Nevertheless, the news of his death came as a great surprise to his
immediate family and to us. Raimund accompanied the book series “Methods and
Principles in Medicinal Chemistry” from the first volume published as early as 1993
until his death and was able to enjoy the publishing of volume 81 in June 2022 enti￾tled “Flow and Microreactor Technology in Medicinal Chemistry” edited by Esther
Alza, shortly before he passed away.
Established in 1993, the series “Methods and Principles in Medicinal Chemistry”
has become a crucial source of information within the medicinal chemistry com￾munity and beyond. Authors and editors of the series come from pharmaceutical
industry as well as from academic institutions, fostering a more active exchange
between these domains.
Over time, Raimund found support from a number of internationally renowned
experts and entrepreneursin medicinal chemistry. Povl Krogsgaard-Larsen, Hendrik
Timmerman, Hugo Kubinyi, and Gerd Folkers asretired series editors had a decisive
influence on the book series and, like Raimund, have contributed to it becoming a
figurehead for medicinal chemistry worldwide.
The following picture shows Raimund (middle) with Gerd Folkers(left) and Hugo
Kubinyi during the celebration of the 25th volume of the book series in 2005.xviii Raimund Mannhold – A Personal Obituary from the Series Editors
Source: Wiley-VCH
From the very beginning, the series focused on topical volumes covering hot con￾cepts and technologies, and the reader will not miss any important topic in the
field. The range of topics is as diverse as are the challenges facing modern drug
developers, spanning the fields of organic chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, life
science, and analytics, the latter also including bioinformatics, chemoinformatics,
and proteomics.
Raimund’s heart beat for his book series, and he was now the only founding editor
since the publication of the first volume 30 years ago (1993); now it must live on
without Raimund, not as before, but it will continue to live on in order to preserve
his legacy. That is the obligation of the current series editors Christa Müller, Jörg
Holenz, and Helmut Buschmann.
Our common goal was to be able to celebrate volume 100 together; we were just
able to publish volume 81 together, but without Raimund, without his commitment,
and without his strong will to document the knowledge of medicinal chemistry of
our time, it will be not an easy task to continue as usual. Without him there is a hard
road ahead of usto fulfill his legacy and with greatsadness to continue without him.
But we see at the same time it as a great obligation to continue the book series in his
spirit.
Raimund’s life was shaped by pharmaceutical science. He was born in 1948 in
Haltern (North Rhine Westphalia, Germany). From 1970 to 1973 he studied phar￾macy at the Frankfurt University, received his doctorate in 1977 from the Univer￾sity of Düsseldorf, and in 1982 Raimund received the Venia Legendi for the subjectRaimund Mannhold – A Personal Obituary from the Series Editors xix

A Personal Foreword
When we think about computers to assist drug discovery, what comes to mind for
most of us are the algorithms and graphics to calculate and visualize all sorts of
molecular properties. What is less obvious is the knowledge that can be produced
from the data itself. Today, a large amount and a vast diversity of data related to
medicinal chemistry and drug discovery are available. With a few clicks, anyone can
freely access downloadable raw datasets or browse more sophisticated structured
databases.
This book aims to provide the reader with a detailed overview of open-access
databases and datasets for drug discovery. While the picture is inevitably incom￾plete, it depicts a wide variety of resources from the most generalist to the most
specialized. The volume begins with a rich annotated list of data sources consid￾ered of importance for (computer-aided) drug discovery and concludes with argued
user perspectives. The core of the book consists of seven diverse and high-quality
resources presented by their developers, categorized in Small molecules or Macro￾molecular targets and diseases. We have encouraged the authors to provide as much
practical advice as possible with step-by-step guides and helpful use casesfor medic￾inal chemists. Here we would like to express our deep gratitude to all the expert
contributors for their remarkable commitment and admirable patience.
It all started in 2019 when the late Professor Raimund Mannhold contacted us for
this project. The book is dedicated to his memory.
The process itself has been a long and chaotic journey through the COVID-19
pandemic.
Let us warmly thank the series editor, Dr. Helmut Buschmann and people at
Wiley-VCH without whom this would not have been possible, in particular, Dr.
Frank Weinreich, Stefany Volk, Satvinder Kaur, and Aswini Murugadass.
We wish you a pleasant and instructive reading!

The role of computer-aided drug design (CADD) in modern drug discovery [1–15] is
to support its various processes, including hit finding, hit-to-lead, lead optimization,
and the activities preluding to preclinical trials, through numerous in silico predic￾tors and filters. These tools have a wide variety of objectives, such as enriching the
families of molecules that will be submitted to experimental screening with poten￾tially active compounds, identifying moleculesthat may be problematic such astoxic
moieties or those with nonspecific activities, generating ideas on the chemical mod￾ifications to be made to the compounds to increase their affinity for the therapeutic
target or to improve their pharmacokinetics [16–19], or finally assisting in the var￾ious selection processes aimed at identifying and promoting the most promising
molecules. These approaches are generally divided into two main families [20].
Structure-based approaches [8, 21–23] use the three-dimensional structure of the
targeted protein, for example, to estimate via the use of a docking software how
and how strongly a small molecule will bind to it. Avoiding the necessity to resort
solely to an experimental method (e.g. X-ray crystallography, NMR, or cryo-electron
microscopy) to obtain this information makes it possible to process a large num￾ber of molecules very quickly and at a moderate cost. In turn, this information can
be used to determine how to modify the chemical structure of a small molecule to
optimize rationally the intermolecular interactions with the protein target. It is then
possible to select the most promising compounds for experimental validations, cre￾ating a cyclic optimization process, thanksto thisfeedback loop between in silico and
in vitro approaches.
Ligand-based approaches take advantage of already known molecules with cer￾tain bioactivities or physicochemical properties, in order to derive the information
necessary to predict the bioactivity or properties of other compounds, real or virtual.
Indeed, CADD has been a pioneering research area in the development and appli￾cation of machine learning methods [24–32], with the emergence, as early as the
Open Access Databases and Datasets for Drug Discovery, First Edition.

1960s [33], of quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR [34]) or quantita￾tive structure–property relationships (QSPR).
To perform these tasks, CADD benefits from numerous databases and datasets
of small molecules, bioactivities and biological processes, 3D structures of small
compounds and biomacromolecules, or molecular properties – some of which being
related to pharmacokinetics ortoxicity [13, 35–38]. Created in 1971, the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) [39], which stores the three-dimensional structural data of large bio￾logical molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, is a precursor in the field of
freely and publicly available databases with possible applications in CADD. Cur￾rently managed by the wwPDB [40] organization and its five members, RCSB PDB
[41], PDBe [42], PDBj [43], EMDB [44] and BMRB [45], the PDB continues to provide
the CADD community with numerous valuable 3D structures of therapeutically rel￾evant proteins in the apo form or in complex with small drug-like molecules, which
can be used to nurture structure-based approaches. Several subsets involving such
structures have been created over time, for instance, to provide reference sets to
benchmark docking software, such as the Astex [46] or the Iridium [47] datasets.
For a very long time, ligand-based approaches were generally limited to the use of
small datasets, collected on a case-by-case basis during specific drug design projects,
thus precluding their application beyond the building of focused models with lim￾ited scope. This situation dramatically changed during the 2000s with the rise of
large-scale databases created specifically for the benefit of drug discovery in gen￾eral and CADD in particular. ChEMBL [48, 49] released in 2008 or PubChem [50]
in 2004, which collect molecules and their activities in biological assays systemati￾cally extracted from medicinal chemistry literature, patent publications, or experi￾mental high-throughput screening programs, are certainly among the forerunners
of this trend. Such databases paved the way for CADD approaches addressing, for
instance, the prediction of bioactivities on a very large scale, including ligand-based
methods. ZINC [51], freely accessible from 2004, is another large-scale database of
small molecules, this time prepared especially for virtual screening. This important
resource focuses on the compilation and storage of commercially available chemical
compounds. DrugBank [52], whose first version dates back to 2006, is an example of
a database gathering numerous curated and high-quality information about a group
of molecules of biological interest, in this case mainly but not exclusively, approved
or developmental drugs. Although smaller than ChEMBL or PubChem for instance,
this type of resources, because of the quality, the structure and the practicality of the
information provided, also plays an critical role in the development of new CADD
techniques and filters, or for more direct applications in virtual screening.
Researchers working in CADD can be considered to have two main activities:
one consists in designing, validating, and benchmarking new in silico approaches,
the other is applying existing tools to support drug descovery projects. The nature
of the databases reflects this duality. Some are clearly oriented toward an applica￾tive usage. With virtual screening in mind, this is the case for resources gathering a
large amount of commercial or virtual molecules,such as ZINC [51] or GDB-17 [53],
whose main purpose is to be used as a source of molecules to feed virtual screening
campaigns. At the opposite end of the spectrum, we find molecular sets constructed
specifically for benchmarking screening methods, such as DUD-E [54] or DEKOIS
[55]. These contain a limited number of compounds, known to be active or inactive1 Open Access Databases and Datasets for Computer-Aided Drug Design 3
on certain protein targets, and carefully chosen to avoid any bias in many molec￾ular properties that would allow a screening software to identify the active ones
too easily. Between these two extremes, we can find databases, such as ChEMBL,
PubChem, or TCRD/Pharos [56], containing a large number of known bioactive
molecules. These generalist databases can not only be used to develop a large range
of CADD methods, including screening or reverse screening approaches, such as
Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) [57, 58] or SwissTargetPrediction [59, 60], but
also constitute a source of real molecules to be virtually screened.
By definition, the interest for many CADD-related databases lies in their capacity
to store a possibly large quantity of molecules, along with useful annotations, and
in their efficient diffusion to the public. This was made possible by the development
and dissemination of widely accepted specific file formats. The most common file
for representing molecules as strings are in SMILES [61, 62] and InChI [63, 64] for￾mats. These one-line formats have the great advantage of using little disk or memory
resources, facilitating the storage, and rapid transfer of large numbers of molecules.
It should be noted, however, that several SMILES strings can represent the same
molecule. This can be problematic and potentially generate redundancy when
compounds from different sources are gathered. To avoid this kind of situation, it
is possible to produce canonical SMILES by a well-chosen software, which are by
definition unique for each molecule, or to use the UniChem [65] database that pro￾vides pointers between the molecules of most common databases. Structure-based
approaches, such as molecular docking, 3D fingerprinting [66], or pharmacophores
[67, 68], require a spatial representation of small molecules. The most frequently
employed file definitions, including tridimensional atomic coordinates, are the
Structural Data File (SDF), the MDL Mol, and Tripos Mol2 formats. Compounds
are often available in such formats in the major small-molecule databases, such
as ZINC [51], Chemspider [69], or DrugBank [52], which allow their direct use
in 3D-based approaches. Other formats are available to store 3D structures of
biomacromolecules, taking advantage of the fact that large biomolecules are based
on the repetition of a small number of residues. The PDB and mmCIF [70] formats
are among the standards and provided by the wwPDB consortium, and by other
major databases of 3D structures of macromolecules, including PDB Redo [71, 72],
as well as the SWISS-MODEL [73], MODBASE [74], and AlphaFold [75, 76]
repositories of structural models.
To be valuable in the context of CADD, a database should meet several criteria in
addition to the nature of its content. These criteria are very close to the findability,
accessibility, interoperability, and reuse (FAIR) principles [77].
First, a database must be maintained and made available for the long term,
ideally via a persistent URL, so that it can be employed for sustainable projects
and developments. Unfortunately, a large fraction of new databases and datasets
disappear only a few years after their initial release, due to lack of resources to
maintain them or lack of interest. Attwood and colleagues studied the 18-year
survival status of 326 databases published before 1997 and found that 62.3% were
dead, 14.4% were archived (and not updated), and only 23.3% were still alive under
their original identity or after rebranding [78]. This first analysis was independently
confirmed by Finkelstein et al. who found that of the 518 original databases
published in the journal Database between 2009 and 2016, 35% were already no4 1 Open Access Databases and Datasets for Computer-Aided Drug Design
longer accessible in 2020 [79], and by Imker who observed that among the 1727
databases published between 1991 and 2016 in Nucleic Acids Research’s “Database
Issue,” 40% were dead in 2018 [80]. They found that databases with higher citation
counts and from researchers with higher h-index within renowned institutions
were more likely to survive. In addition to straightforward online accessibility over
the long term, databases should ideally be regularly updated to include the latest
useful information. In order to make this process efficient and compatible with
the reproducibility of the research projects that need the databases, these updates
should be clearly versioned and previous releases archived for the long term. In
addition, unique identifiers should be assigned to individual database entries and
maintained persistently across all versions.
Second, the database should be easily searchable and retrievable. Most of those
mentioned in this chapter can be accessed via a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
developed to browse and search data easily, for instance by typing keywords in a
search box, providing a query molecule in SMILES format or as a file, or by draw￾ing compounds or molecularfragments within a molecularsketcher. Such interfaces
are particularly efficient to search for information about a few given molecules and
to display them in a well-designed graphical representation. However, such inter￾faces become inefficient when a project requires a large amount of data, which will
eventually have to be analyzed by the user through dedicated scripts and programs.
In these cases, the information should be searchable and massively retrievable by
command lines, for example, with an API through specific search and download
commands. Ideally, the whole database content should be downloadable for local
use by classic database management systems, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, in
order to be easily deployed and managed on the computers of advanced users.
Third, CADD databases and datasets should use renowned and well-accepted for￾matsto store and deliver moleculesto the users. As mentioned above,severalstrings
and file formats are already available for this purpose, including SMILES, InChI,
SDF, Mol, Mol2, PDB, and mmCIF. These formats are readily processed by most
CADD software, making the use of the databases or datasets contentstraightforward.
Fourth, to make the interoperability between databases easier, they should include
as much as possible well-accepted unique identifiersfrom long-standing key players
in the field. For instance, the UniProt [81] ID provides a valuable solution to identify
proteins. In addition, small molecules can be identified in many cases by one of the
identifiers present in UniChem. This does not prevent the authors of new databases
to create their own unique identifiers, for more flexibility. For example, ChEMBL
uses its own unique identifier for proteins and ensures interoperability with other
resources by providing a file mapping these ChEMBL IDs with UniProt [81] IDs.
Fifth, accurate information regarding the origin of the data stored in the database
or dataset should be provided, as well as a detailed description of the manual or
automatic curation processes applied to it.
Sixth, databases and datasets should have a clear usage license. Free- and
open-access resources are often favored in academic environment, where funding
may be limited, because they increase the visibility, maximize the use and impact of
data, and facilitate the reuse of research results (Table 1.1).Table 1.1 List of databases and datasets, along with their main usage and URL. When appropriate, the key purpose is reminded: training and validation
of new approaches, or applicative usage. VS: virtual screening.

2.1 Introduction
Advances in combinatorial chemistry (CC) and high-throughput screening (HTS)
technologies have made it possible to rapidly test the biological activity of mil￾lions of chemicals at a very low cost. In addition, computational approaches for
named-entity recognition [1–5] and optical structure recognition [6–11] are now
commonly used to extract chemical information from various documents, such as
scientific articles, patents, and government reports. These technological advances
have significantly increased the amount of chemical data available in the public
domain, creating a demand for public information resources that can collect,
organize, and disseminate this data. It led to the development of many public
databases, such as PubChem [12–17], ChEMBL [18], DrugBank [19], BindingDB
[20], ZINC [21], and IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology [22].
PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (Figure 2.1) is a public chemical
database at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) [12–17]. It collects chemical
information from hundreds of data sources and disseminates it to the public free of
charge. With more than 110 million unique chemical structures (as of 30 January
2022), PubChem is considered as one of the largest chemical databases in the pub￾lic domain. Visited by millions of unique users every month [12], PubChem serves a
wide range of users, including scientists, chemicalsafety officers, patent agents, edu￾cators,students, and many others. Especially, PubChem is an importantresource for
biomedicalresearch communitiesin the areas of cheminformatics, chemical biology,
medicinal chemistry, and drug discovery.Importantly, PubChem data are commonly
used to build machine-learning models to predict various chemical properties and
biological activities [23–48].
This chapter provides an overview of PubChem, including its data contents rele￾vant to drug discovery as well asthe tools and servicesthat use these data. The chem￾ical space of PubChem is compared with those of other popular chemical databases.
Important characteristics of bioactivity data archived in PubChem are discussed.

Figure 2.1 PubChem home page (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The user can search
PubChem by providing a keyword query in the search box (1 ). A chemical structure query
can be provided using the PubChem Sketcher (2 ). It is also possible to provide a list of
PubChem record identifiers using the “Upload ID List” button (3 ). The PubChem
classification browser (4 ) allows users to get records that belong to a particular class or
have a particular annotation. Clicking the “About” link (5 ) directs to PubChem’s help
documentation site (called PubChem Docs), where the user can also access additional tools
and services.
2.2 Data Content and Organization
PubChem provides a wide range of chemical information. It contains computation￾ally generated 3D structures of chemicals [49, 50] as well as links to experimentally
determined 3D structures of chemicals available at the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
[51] and the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [52]. Various kinds of molecular
properties are available in PubChem and many of them are pertinent to drug
discovery (e.g. molecular weight, solubility, octanol–water partition coefficient
(log P), Caco2 permeability, acid dissociation constant (pKa), carcinogenicity, and
mutagenicity). In addition, a large amount of bioactivity data submitted by data
depositors are archived in PubChem. Substantial quantities of annotations on
approved and investigational drugs are integrated into PubChem, such as drug
labeling, indications, target genes and proteins, mechanisms of action, absorption,
distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties, and clinical
trials carried out in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Moreover, PubChem has
spectral information, including mass spectrometry (MS), infrared (IR), ultraviolet
(UV), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data. It also provides2.2 Data Content and Organization 43
information on synthesis and chemical vendors, as well as scientific articles and
patent documents that mention chemicals.
The PubChem Data Sources page (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sources)
provides an interactive overview of organizations contributing data to PubChem.
As of 30 January 2022, the data contained in PubChem are from more than 800
data sources, including U.S. government agencies, international organizations,
academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies, chemical vendors, and other
chemical biology databases. PubChem plays a dual role as an archive, which
stores original chemical data provided by individual sources without any mod￾ification, and as a knowledgebase, which provides users with well-organized,
high-quality information about chemicals. This dual role is reflected in the data
organization in PubChem. PubChem data is organized into multiple data col￾lections, including Substance, Compound, BioAssay, Gene, Protein, Pathway,
Taxonomy, and Patent (Figure 2.2). Substance archives chemical descriptions
submitted by individual data providers. Compound contains unique chemical
structures extracted from Substance through chemical structure standardization
[53]. BioAssay stores biological assay descriptions and test results, provided by assay
data providers. The Gene, Protein, Pathway, and Taxonomy collections provide
information on chemicals related to a given gene, protein, pathway, and taxon,
respectively [17]. The Patent collection contains chemicals mentioned in a given
patent document. Among these data collections, Substance and BioAssay are

boxes) are knowledgebases.44 2 PubChem: A Large-Scale Public Chemical Database for Drug Discovery
archives that store depositor-provided data, while the other collections serve as
knowledgebases.
It is noteworthy that, because of their archival nature, the data in Substance
and BioAssay are kept as they were at the time of data submission by the sources.
In essence, these data are owned and controlled by the data contributors. When
necessary, the data source, not PubChem, may correct or update a record in
Substance or BioAssay: the record will be versioned, and both the new and original
ones will be retained and accessible. PubChem does, however, facilitate corrections
to the data by working with the data submitter, when errors are made known to
PubChem.
Each record in the Substance, Compound, and BioAssay collections is assigned
a numeric identifier called Substance ID (SID), Compound ID (CID), and Assay
ID (AID), respectively. Records in the Substance and Compound collections are
called substances and compounds. It is worth mentioning that users are often
confused with these two PubChem-specific terms. Simply put, while substances
are depositor-provide descriptions of chemicals, compounds are unique chemical
structures extracted from substances, meaning that a compound may be associated
with multiple substances. Currently, PubChem contains 110 million compounds,
extracted from 277 million substances (Figure 2.3). Detailed discussion about the
substances and compounds is given in our previous paper [14] and blog post (http://
go.usa.gov/x72qw).

definition of substances and compounds in PubChem. The data underlying this chart were
generated on 30 January 2022.2.3 Tools and Services 45
2.3 Tools and Services
PubChem provides various tools and services to assist users in exploiting PubChem
data, and they can be accessed through the PubChem homepage or the PubChem
Help site (https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (5 in Figure 2.1). This section
provides a brief overview of some of these tools and services, while more details can
be found at the PubChem Help site. In addition, step-by-step instructions on how
to explore PubChem data through web browsers are given in our recent protocol
paper [15].
2.3.1 PubChem Search
PubChem data can be searched from the PubChem home page (https://pubchem
.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (Figure 2.1), which also serves as the entry point to various
tools and services. A simple keyword search can be initiated by providing the
query keyword in the search box (1 in Figure 2.1). PubChem accepts various
types of keywords, including chemical names, chemical abstract service (CAS)
registry numbers, PubChem record identifiers (SID, CID, and AID), gene/protein
names and symbols, and disease names. When a keyword query is provided,
PubChem searches all data collections simultaneously and returns hit records
for individual collections (Figure 2.4). It also tries to identify the most relevant
record and presents it at the top of the search result page (1 in Figure 2.4). The
hits from a given collection can be viewed by clicking the corresponding tab
(2 in Figure 2.4). Users can refine this hit list based on some select attributes
using filters (3 in Figure 2.4). The buttons available on the right column of
the search result page (4 in Figure 2.4) allow users to perform additional tasks
with the hit records, such as downloading them on a local machine, saving
them for later use, or getting other records related to the hits. Clicking one of
the returned hits leads to its Summary page, which displays all information
available in PubChem for a given record (to be discussed in 2.3.2 Summary pages
section).
The Compound collection can also be searched using a chemical structure query.
The input structure can be provided using a simplified molecular-input line-entry
system (SMILES) [54–56] or International Chemical Identifier (InChI) string [57].
Alternatively, it can be drawn using the PubChem Sketcher [58], which is accessible
from the PubChem homepage (2 in Figure 2.1). When a chemical structure input
is provided, multiple types of structure searches are simultaneously performed,
including identity searches, 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) similarity
searches, and sub- and superstructure searches. The result for each search type can
be accessed through the corresponding tab (1 in Figure 2.5). Users can customize
the structure search by changing the parameters and options used for the search
through the Settings button (2 in Figure 2.5).
It is noteworthy that PubChem supports two types of similarity search, based on
fingerprint-based 2D similarity and Gaussian-shape overlay-based 3D similarity
methods [59–61]. The 2D similarity between molecules is calculated by using46 2 PubChem: A Large-Scale Public Chemical Database for Drug Discovery
Figure 2.4 Search result page for a text query (ascorbic acid as an example) (https://
pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#query=ascorbic%20acid). The best hit (1 ) will be presented at
the top, and the hits from each data collection can be accessed by clicking the
corresponding tab (2 ). The search result can be refined using the filters (3 ), and
additional tasks can be done through the buttons on the right column of the page (4 ).
the PubChem subgraph fingerprints in conjunction with the Tanimoto equation
[62–64]:
Tanimoto = NAB
NA + NB − NAB
(2.1)
where NA and NB are the respective counts of fingerprint bits set in molecules A
and B, and NAB is the count of bits set in common. On the other hand, 3D molecular
similarity is quantified with the shape-Tanimoto (ST) [15, 59, 60], which evaluates
steric shape similarity, and color-Tanimoto (CT) [15], which quantifies functional
group similarity. They are defined as:2.3 Tools and Services 47

ascorbic acid as an example) (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#query=C([C@@H]
([C@@H]1C(=C(C(=O)O1)O)O)O)O). PubChem performs multiple types of structure searches
against the Compound collection, and the results for each search type can be accessed
through the corresponding tab (1 ). The parameters and options used for structure searches
can be adjusted using the Settings button (2 ). The search result can be refined using the
filters (3 ), and additional tasks can be done through the buttons on the right column of the
page (4 ).

where VAA and VBB are the self-overlap volumes of molecules A and B, respec￾tively, and the VAB is the overlap volume between them. In Eq (2.3), the index f
indicates any of six functional group types (i.e. hydrogen-bond donors and accep￾tors, cations, anions, hydrophobes, and rings), represented by fictitious “feature”
or “color” atoms. Vf
AA and Vf
BB are the self-overlap volumes of A and B for feature48 2 PubChem: A Large-Scale Public Chemical Database for Drug Discovery
atom type f , respectively, and Vf
AB is the overlap volume of molecules A and B for
feature atom type f .
The ST and CT scores can be combined to create a Combo-Tanimoto (ComboT)
score, which simultaneously considers both steric shape similarity and functional
group similarity:
ComboT = ST + CT (2.4)
Because both ST and CT scores range from 0 to 1, the ComboT score ranges
from 0 to 2 (without normalization). The ST, CT, and ComboT scores between
molecules can be evaluated in two different molecular superpositions: the ST- or
shape-optimized superposition and the CT- or feature-optimized superposition. In
the shape-optimization, the superposition of two molecules is optimized to have a
maximum ST score. In the feature-optimization, both shapes and features of the
molecules are simultaneously considered to find the best superposition.
By default, 2D similarity search returns compounds whose Tanimoto score relative
to the query molecule is equal to or greater than 0.90. For 3D similarity searches,
compounds with ST≥0.80 and CT≥0.50 are returned. More detailed information
on 2D and 3D similarity searches is given in our previous paper [15].
2.3.2 Summary Pages
The Summary page for a given PubChem record displays all information avail￾able for that record. For the records in the Substance and BioAssay collections,
which are archival in nature, their Summary page shows the current version of
depositor-provided data by default. An older version of data can be displayed by
selecting the desired version from the dropdown menu (1 in Figure 2.6). For the
records in the other data collections, which serve as knowledgebases, the Summary
page contains not only relevant depositor-provided data but also annotation
data collected by the PubChem crew from external authoritative sources. These
annotations are regularly updated to provide up-to-date information.
The Summary page for a given record has links to other related records (in the
same or different collections), providing users with quick access to information
about them. In addition, the annotation data are presented with the data sources,
allowing users to go to the original data source to check the context of the data and
obtain additional information. Users can quickly access the desired information
by using the Table of Contents available in the right column (2 in Figure 2.6). The
data presented on the Summary page are downloadable using the Download button
available at the top of the right column (3 in Figure 2.6). It is also possible to down￾load the data presented under an individual (sub)section of the Summary page.
Because each (sub)section of the Summary page is widgetized, it can be embedded
within the user’s web page. More information on PubChem Widgets is available in
its help document, available at: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/widgets.2.3 Tools and Services 49
Figure 2.6 Summary page for SID 46505070 (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sub￾stance/46505070). The dropdown menu (1 ) allows users to view the older version of this
substance record. The Table of Contents on the right column (2 ) helps navigate the
Summary page. The data presented on this page can be downloaded by using the
Download button (3 ) above the Table of Contents.
2.3.3 Literature Knowledge Panel
PubChem contains a great deal of information on scientific articles and patent doc￾uments that mention chemicals and their bioactivity data [65]. Users often desire to
explore these articles to learn about the relationships among chemicals, genes, pro￾teins, and diseases, which is not trivial given the size and scope of PubChem data. To
assist users in this task, the Literature Knowledge Panels [66] are presented on the
Summary page of a compound, gene, or protein. The Literature Knowledge Panels
for a given entity (i.e. a chemical, gene, or protein) display a few of its most rele￾vant, nonredundant “neighbors,” which are defined as other entities co-mentioned
in scientific articles (e.g. chemicals, genes, proteins, and diseases). The panels also
provide a sample of PubMed records co-mentioning the entity and its neighbors.50 2 PubChem: A Large-Scale Public Chemical Database for Drug Discovery
For example, the following uniform resource locators (URLs) are for the Literature
Knowledge Panels for morphine (CID 5288826):
● Chemical–chemical co-occurrences: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/com￾pound/5288826#section=Chemical-Co-Occurrences-in-Literature
● Chemical–gene co-occurrences: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/
5288826#section=Chemical-Gene-Co-Occurrences-in-Literature
● Chemical-disease co-occurrences: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/
5288826#section=Chemical-Disease-Co-Occurrences-in-Literature
The development and implementation of the Literature Knowledge Panels are
described in detail in our previous paper [66]. The Knowledge Panels facilitate the
quick discovery of important relationships between chemicals, genes, proteins, and
diseases, as evidenced by peer-reviewed journal articlesthat co-mention the entities.
A sample of PubMed records presented in the Panels helps understand the nature
and reliability of the relationships. The underlying data presented in the Knowledge
Panels can be downloaded, allowing users to gain a deeper understanding of the
relationships between entities.
2.3.4 2D and 3D Neighbors
PubChem contains more than one hundred million compounds. A great deal
of information is available for some of these compounds (e.g. U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, dietary supplements, and common
solvents). In contrast, other compounds (e.g. those synthesized for HTS screening
purposes) have little-to-no information except for some computed properties. To
deal with this uneven degree of available information, PubChem precomputes the
“neighboring” relationship between compounds based on their structural similar￾ity. For each compound, the PubChem neighboring process identifies structurally
similar compounds, which may have similar molecular properties and biological
functions. Note that these “structural” neighbors should not be confused with the
neighbors presented in the Literature Knowledge Panel (which refers to entities
commonly mentioned together in literature).
During the neighboring process, structural similarity between compounds is
evaluated using the 2D and 3D similarity methods previously described in 2.3.1
PubChem Search section, resulting in two sets of neighbors, called 2D and 3D
neighbors, respectively. If two compounds have a Tanimoto score of 0.9 or greater,
they are considered to be 2D neighbors of each other. On the other hand, if two
compounds have an ST score of ≥0.8 and a CT score of ≥0.5, they are considered to
be 3D neighbors of each other. More detailed information on 2D and 3D neighboring
is explained in our previous papers [67, 68].
The precomputed neighbors of a compound can be accessed in the “Related
Records” section of its Compound Summary page (Figure 2.7). The neighbors with
annotations are displayed in the “Related Compounds with Annotation” section,
which allows users to quickly go to the Summary pages of the neighbors and check
what information is available for the neighbors (1 in Figure 2.7). The lists of 2D2.3 Tools and Services 51
Figure 2.7 Structural neighbors are presented in the “Related Records” section of the
Summary page of morphine (CID 5288826) (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/
5288826#section=Related-Records). Neighbors with annotations are displayed in the
“Related Compounds with Annotation” subsection (1 ). The lists of 2D and 3D neighbors are
accessible through the “Similar Compounds” (2 ) and “Similar Conformers” links (3 ),
respectively, available in the “Related Compounds” subsection.
and 3D neighbors are accessible through the “Similar Compounds” and “Similar
Conformers” links, respectively, available under the “Related Compounds” section
of the Compound Summary page (2 and 3 in Figure 2.7).
2.3.5 Classification Browser
The PubChem Classification Browser (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/classifi￾cation) displays classification or ontological terms in a list or a tree structure, along
with the counts of PubChem records annotated with them. It supports various
classifications and ontologies, many of which are relevant to medicinal chemistry52 2 PubChem: A Large-Scale Public Chemical Database for Drug Discovery
and drug discovery. These include the FDA Pharmacological Classification, World
Health Organization (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Code,
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), Gene Ontology (GO), National Cancer Insti￾tute Thesaurus (NCIT), Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Enzyme Classification,
ChEMBL Target Tree, Guide to Pharmacology Target Classification, and many
others. The Classification Browser is very useful for quickly finding PubChem
records annotated with a given term (e.g. compounds annotated with the MeSH
term “antihypertensive agents” or bioassays annotated with the ChEMBL target tree
term “kinase”). Importantly, this tool also supports the PubChem Table of Contents,
allowing users to quickly find and retrieve compounds that have a particular kind of
annotation data (e.g. those with experimental solubility data, those with 3D crystal
structure information, those which appear in the FDA orange book, those which
have been tested in a clinical trial, and so on). The Classification Browser can also
be accessed from the PubChem homepage (4 in Figure 2.1).
2.3.6 Identifier Exchange Service
The Identifier Exchange Service (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/idexchange/)
converts one type of identifier for a given set of chemical structures into a different
type of identifier for identical or similar chemical structures. Supported identifiers
are PubChem CIDs and SIDs, SMILES [54–56], InChI [57], InChIKey [57], and
chemical names (synonyms). External identifiers used by PubChem’s data sources
are also supported. This tool provides users with several options to specify what
“identical” or “similar” structures mean, which affects the resulting identifiers.
In PubChem, the context of structural identity may vary depending on whether
to ignore stereochemistry and/or isotopism and whether to consider salt forms
and mixtures. Accordingly, the Identifier Exchange Service has multiple options to
specify the meaning of structural identity. In addition, it has two additional options,
“Similar 2D Compound” and “Similar 3D Conformer”, which allow users to get
the identifiers for chemical structures similar to the input structures (i.e. 2D and
3D structural neighbors, described in 2.3.4 “2D and 3D neighbors” section). When
one of the two options is selected, it returns the identifiers for the precomputed
structural neighbors of the input structures.
In the initial stage, the Identifier Exchange Service tries to map them with exist￾ing compound recordsin PubChem, and then the mapped compounds are subject to
the requested operation (i.e. getting identical,related, orsimilar compounds), which
uses precomputed relationships between compounds. Therefore, if an input identi￾fier fails to map with any compound in PubChem, the subsequent operation cannot
be performed and the input identifier will be ignored. For this reason, the Identifier
Exchange Service can only work with the input identifiers that can be mapped with
existing compounds.
2.3.7 Programmatic Access
PubChem provides multiple programmatic accessroutes[69], including Entrez Util￾ities(E-Utilities), Power User Gateway (PUG), PUG-SOAP [69], PUG-REST [69–71],2.3 Tools and Services 53
and PUG-View [72]. Among them, PUG-REST [69–71] and PUG-View [72] are the
simplest to learn and use. Both areRepresentational State Transfer(REST)-like inter￾faces, meaning that (almost) all information necessary to make a data accessrequest
through PUG-REST or PUG-View can be encoded into a single URL, which can be
readily incorporated into a third-party computer program or script.
It is noteworthy that the two programmatic interfaces are designed to serve differ￾ent kinds of data in general. While PUG-REST is used to access data that can be read￾ily structured (e.g. computed properties of compounds and activity data for assays),
PUG-View provides access to unstructured, textual annotation data (e.g. excerpts
about the ecotoxicity of a compound). Another important difference between the
two interfaces is that PUG-View cannot access multiple records in a single request,
as opposed to PUG-REST. For more details about the comparison between these two
interfaces, see our previous paper [72].
PubChem has a standard time limit of 30 seconds per web service request. Both
PUG-REST and PUG-View are intended to handle short requests that can be com￾pleted within this time limit. In addition, PubChem also employs request volume
limits, which are dynamically adjusted based on the web traffic status for the Pub￾Chem servers and the extent to which the user is approaching limits. Under normal
circumstances, these limits are:
● Not more than five requests per second.
● Not more than 400 requests per minute.
● Not more than 300 seconds of running time per minute (across all running
requests on PubChem)
However, at times of excessive demand, these limits may be tightened through
dynamic web request throttling [70]. The user should moderate the speed at which
requests are sent to PubChem based on the throttling information provided in the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) header response. Violation of usage policies
may result in users being temporarily blocked from accessing PubChem resources.
See our previous paper [70] for more details about dynamic web traffic control.
2.3.8 PubChem FTP Site and PubChemRDF
PubChem data can be freely downloaded in various formats (e.g. CSV, SDF, XML,
JSON, and PNG) from a search result page (Figures 2.4 and 2.5) or the Summary
page of each PubChem record (Figure 2.6).It is also downloadable through program￾matic access interfaces, including PUG-REST [69–71] and PUG-View [72]. In addi￾tion, the PubChem FTP site supports bulk downloads for a wide range of PubChem
data. Importantly, the FTP site hosts PubChemRDF (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih
.gov/rdf/) [73], PubChem data encoded using the RDF. RDF is a World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) standard model for data interchange on the web (https://www
.w3.org/RDF/). PubChemRDF is very useful for integrating PubChem data with
in-house data or data from other resources across scientific domains.
RDF expresses knowledge into a directed, labeled graph by breaking it down into
so-called triples, each of which consists of the subject, object, and predicate. For54 2 PubChem: A Large-Scale Public Chemical Database for Drug Discovery
example, the phrase “alcohol may cause liver cirrhosis” can be broken into three
pieces: “alcohol” (subject), “liver cirrhosis” (object), and “may cause” (predicate).
Note that the predicate defines the semantic relationship between the subject and
the object.
The technical details of PubChemRDF are described in our previous paper [73]
as well as the PubChemRDF Help page (https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
rdf). As of 30 January 2022, PubChemRDF has more than 97 billion triples, which
encode semantic relationships among various entities contained in PubChem, such
as compounds, substances, bioassays, proteins, genes, pathways, and endpoints.
Up-to-date and more detailed RDF triple statistics are available at the PubChemRDF
Statistics page (https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rdf-statistics). PubChem￾RDF data also contains direct links to RDF-formatted data in other community
resources, including MeSH RDF [74, 75], UniProtRDF [76], PDB RDF [77, 78],
Reactome RDF [79], ChEMBL RDF [79], and WikiData RDF [80], making it easier
to share and integrate PubChem data with data across scientific domains.
The PubChemRDF data on the FTP site are partitioned by subdomain. A sub￾domain refers to all RDF triples that have the same type of entity as subjects. For
example, the Compound subdomain contains all triples whose subject is a com￾pound record in PubChem. The RDF data for each subdomain is stored in its own
subdirectory. This allows users to download only the desired data (rather than get￾ting all RDF data).
The downloaded RDF data can be loaded on a local computing machine and
exploited using Semantic Web Technologies. For example, the RDF data can be
imported into an RDF triple store (e.g. Apache Jana TDB or OpenLink Virtuoso) and
accessed using the SPARQL query interface. Alternatively, the data can be loaded
into an RDF-aware graph database (e.g. Neo4j), and the graph traversal algorithm
can be used to query PubChem knowledge graphs. In addition to bulk downloads
via FTP, PubChemRDF can also be accessed through a REST-full interface. More
detailed information on PubChemRDF can be found in our previous paper [73]
as well as at the PubChemRDF help page (https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih
.gov/rdf).
2.4 Drug- and Lead-Likeness of PubChem Compounds
Large chemical databaseslike PubChem often contain tens of millions of molecules,
which cover various chemical classes. It would be fairly expensive to screen all these
molecules during the drug discovery campaign. Therefore, in the early stage of drug
discovery, it is common to filter out molecules that do not have good properties as
drug candidates, based on a set of molecular properties. Examples of such filters are
Lipinski’s rule of five [81], the Ghose filter [82], Veber filter [83], Rapid Elimination
Of Swill(REOS) filters[84], and QuantitativeEstimate of Drug-likeness(QED) filters
[85]. PubChem provides molecular properties that can be used to apply these filters
to subset compounds. Especially, these properties are very useful for refining the
search result from a query by filtering out the compounds without desired properties.2.4 Drug- and Lead-Likeness of PubChem Compounds 55
One of the most popular molecular property filters is Lipinski’s rule of five (Ro5)
for drug-likeness [81], which is used to determine if a chemical has good solubility
and permeability as a candidate for an orally administered drug in humans, based
on four molecular properties: molecular weight, log P, the number of H-bond
donors, and the number of H-bond acceptors. As shown in Figure 2.8, 86% of the
PubChem compound records meet all four criteria or violate only one of them
(68.9% and 17.2%, respectively), indicating that most compounds in PubChem are
drug-like. Figure 2.8 also showsthat 4.85 million compounds(4.39% of all PubChem
compounds) are fragment-lead-like, satisfying all criteria of Congreve’s rule of three
(Ro3) [86]. There are 10.4 million compounds (9.39% of all PubChem compounds)
that violate only one of the criteria of Ro3.

data underlying this chart was generated on 30 January 2022.56 2 PubChem: A Large-Scale Public Chemical Database for Drug Discovery
2.5 Bioactivity Data in PubChem
PubChem contains 293 million biological activity data points from 1.4 million
biological assays (as of 30 January 2022). Most of these assays are small-molecule
assays, with 185 RNAi screenings. Among the 110 million compounds in PubChem,
3.6 million compounds have been tested in at least one bioassay archived in Pub￾Chem, and about half of them (1.5 million compounds) have been declared active
in at least one bioassay. In addition, 75,000 compounds have shown subnanomolar
activity in at least one assay.
Most PubChem’s bioassay data were generated through HTS from the
now-concluded Molecular Libraries Initiatives at NIH and other large-scale
HTS projects. On the other hand, PubChem also has biological activity data
extracted from scientific articles and patent documents through text mining and/or
manual curation. These literature-extracted data are contributed by several data
sources, including ChEMBL [18], BindingDB [20], and the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to
PHARMACOLOGY [22]. More information on the literature-extracted bioactivity
data in PubChem is available in our previous paper [65].
PubChem’s bioactivity data vary in their quality. Typically, HTS data contain
many compounds, with most of them being inactive and only a handful of them
being active. Currently, the largest assay in PubChem is AID 1508602, which tested
642,701 compounds (636,062 inactive and 6746 active) against G-protein-coupled
receptor 151 (GPCR-151). Many HTS assays are “primary” screens, performed
at a single concentration to check whether molecules have a signal greater than
a predefined threshold. Therefore, there is no guarantee that active compounds
from these assays would interact with their targets in a dose–response way. In
addition, because HTS data usually have many false positives and false negatives
for various reasons, the hit molecules from HTS experiments are typically tested
in secondary screens to confirm their activities. These “confirmatory” screens are
normally done in a dose–response fashion and remove false positive compounds
(and often toxic compounds). In contrast, literature-extracted bioactivity data are
dominated by active compounds because researchers usually report results from
successful experiments in which active compounds are identified. Therefore, assay
data extracted from scientific articles do not have many compounds, and it is not
uncommon to build a data set from different assays derived from different studies,
ignoring differences in experimental conditions among the studies. However, care
should be taken when using such a data set, especially for developing predictive
models for the biological activities of small molecules.
When the user searches PubChem for bioassay records, it is possible to refine the
search result according to the bioassay type and data source. For example, as shown
in Figure 2.4, the keyword search for “ascorbic acid” returns relevant records in all
data collections, and clicking the “BioAssay” tab (2 in Figure 2.4) displaysthe list of
hit assays. This list can be refined by using the “Filters” button available under the
tabs (3 in Figure 2.4), which allows the user to select only those assays with desired
attributes (e.g. whether an assay is primary or confirmatory screening, or whether it
is literature-extracted). Using the “Filters” button, it is also possible to retrieve only2.6 Comparison with Other Databases 57
those assays provided by a particular data source or only those assays performed
in vivo.
PubChem users often want to get all bioactivity data for a given target (e.g. a pro￾tein, gene, or organism),scattered across multiple assaysfrom different data sources.
To meet this demand, PubChem organizes bioactivity data by target and storesthem
in the Protein, Gene, and Taxonomy data collections (see Figure 2.2) [17]. Users can
quickly access target-specific bioactivity data through the corresponding Summary
page of the target, as shown in these examples:
● Chemicals and their bioactivities against the human hypoxia-inducible factor 1
subunit α (HIF1A) (NCBI Protein Accession: Q16665) https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm
.nih.gov/protein/Q16665#section=Chemicals-and-Bioactivities
● Assay experiments targeting the human peroxisome proliferator-activated recep￾tor δ (PPARD) gene (NCBI Gene ID: 5467) https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

● Whole organism bioactivities against Plasmodium falciparum (NCBI Taxonomy
ID: 5833) https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/5833#section=Whole￾Organism-Bioactivities
These Summary pages present the target-specific bioactivity data, along with addi￾tional information on the target, collected from authoritative sources. This target
information helps users to better understand the bioactivity data. In addition, the
target-specific data presented on these Summary pages can be downloaded for fur￾ther analysis. More details on the PubChem Protein, Gene, and Taxonomy data col￾lections can be found in our recent paper [17].
2.6 Comparison with Other Databases
Table 2.1 shows the overlap of the chemical structure coverage between Pub￾Chem and popular chemical databases, including ChEMBL [18], CompTox [87],
BindingDB [20], ChEBI [88], PDB in Europe (PDBe) [89], DrugBank [19], Rhea
[90], IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY [22], ClinicalTrials.gov (https://
clinicaltrials.gov), and DailyMed (https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov). These overlap
data were obtained from UniChem [91, 92], which is a free online chemical identi￾fier mapping service. They were computed based on structural identity defined as
FULIK (e.g. identity of the full InChIKey), meaning that two chemical structures
were considered identical if their full InChIKey strings were the same as each other.
Most compounds contained in the databases listed in Table 2.1 were also found in
PubChem, indicating a substantial overlap between PubChem and these databases.
PDBe had the smallest overlap, with only 92% of PDBe ligands also being contained
in PubChem.
PubChem data sources include all information resources listed in Table 2.1, and
their data are integrated within PubChem. Therefore, most chemical structures
in these resources are expected to be contained in PubChem. However, a small
percentage of their structures are not found in PubChem. It is primarily due to58 2 PubChem: A Large-Scale Public Chemical Database for Drug Discovery
Table 2.1 Comparison of popular chemical databases with PubChem. For a given
database, Ntotal indicates the total number of chemical structures contained in that
database. Noverlap are the numbers of chemical structures that also exist in PubChem, and
Nexclusive is the number of chemical structures contained only in the given database but not
in PubChem. Numbers in parentheses are the percentages of Noverlap and Nexclusive with
respect to Ntotal. This overlap data, obtained from UniChem [91, 92] was calculated on the
basis of structural identity defined as FULIK (i.e. identity of the full InChIKey).

a lag time between when new structures are added to a data source and when
those additions are reflected in PubChem. This lag time ranges from a few days to
several weeks, depending on the amount of new data and the update schedule. In
addition, some molecules are too big for entry into PubChem. With the primary
focus on small molecules, PubChem only considers chemical structures with fewer
than 1000 explicit atoms. This limit excludes large molecules contained in other
databases (such as biologics and chemically modified biopolymers).
2.7 Use of PubChem Data for Drug Discovery
PubChem is commonly used as a reference tool, enabling users to quickly find
desired information on a chemical. Our recent paper [15] provides an overview of
how to explore the wealth of chemical information contained in PubChem through
web browsers. PubChem also serves as a resource for virtual screening in drug
discovery projects, as discussed in another paper [16].
Importantly, bioactivity data contained in PubChem BioAssay are now routinely
used in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to develop computational
models for the identification of potential drug candidates [23–48]. It is noteworthy
that these data are applied to predict not only drug-target interaction but also various2.8 Summary 59
properties that a good drug candidate should have. As an example, PubChem’s HTS
data have been used to develop computational models to predict small-molecule
activities against human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes [23–27] and human
Ether-a-go-go Related Gene (hERG) proteins [28–30], which are involved in
drug-induced hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity, respectively. Svensson et al. [31]
developed prediction models for cytotoxicity of chemicals using cytotoxicity data
for 440,000 compounds extracted from 16 HTS assays. Russo et al. [32] extracted
bioassay data for 7385 compounds from PubChem BioAssay and developed a com￾putational approach to predict the acute oral toxicity of chemicals. Rodríguez-Pérez
et al. [33] used PubChem HTS data to predict the bioactivity profiles of chemicals
against 53 targets.
In addition, PubChem’s bioactivity data have been used to develop algorithms
to identify potential false positives in assay experiments. For instance, Matlock
et al. [34] and Stork et al. [35] developed machine-learning-based models for the
prediction of frequent hitters (also referred to as promiscuous molecules). Su et al.
[36] developed classification models to identify autofluorescent compounds, which
often result in false-positive signals in assays that use fluorescence-based detection
methods.
Information contained in other PubChem data collections can also be used
for drug discovery-related research. For instance, there have been several studies
that developed computational algorithms to identify metabolites from MS data in
metabolomics experiments [37–39]. Another example is the study by Meyer et al.
[40], in which PubChem compounds annotated with MeSH therapeutic use classes
were used to develop computational models that predict the therapeutic functions
of a chemical only from its structure.
2.8 Summary
PubChem is one of the public chemical databases that contain a large amount
of chemical information. As a data aggregator, PubChem collects a wide range
of chemical information from hundreds of data sources, including molecular
structures and properties, spectral information, bioactivities, drug labeling, clinical
trials, chemical vendors,synthesis, journal articles, patents, and many others. These
data are organized into multiple data collections (Substance, Compound, BioAssay,
Gene, Protein, Pathway, Taxonomy, and Patent) and each record in these collections
has a Summary page, which presents all information available in PubChem for that
record.
PubChem’s search interface supports various types of text queries, such as chem￾ical names, PubChem record identifiers (SIDs, CIDs, and AIDs), CAS registry num￾bers, gene/protein names and symbols, disease names, and so on. The Compound
collection can also be searched using a chemicalstructure input, which can be speci￾fied with line notationslike SMILES and InChIstrings or drawn using the PubChem
Sketcher. Multiple types of chemical structure searches are supported, including
identity search, 2D and 3D similarity searches, and sub- and super-structure60 2 PubChem: A Large-Scale Public Chemical Database for Drug Discovery
searches. Using the PubChem Classification Browser, it is possible to quickly
retrieve records that are annotated with a classification or ontological term. In
addition, the Identifier Exchange Service allows users to convert identifiers for a
given set of chemical structures into different types of identifiers for identical or
similar chemical structures.
PubChem records are highly interlinked with each other. The Literature Knowl￾edge Panels, which are embedded in the Summary page of a PubChem record, help
users explore the relationship between entities contained in PubChem (e.g. chem￾icals, genes, proteins, and diseases). In addition, for a given compound, PubChem
provides a precomputed list of 2D and 3D neighbors. These neighbors help users to
predict the molecular properties and biological activities of a compound that does
not have much information.
PubChem data are accessible through multiple programmatic interfaces, includ￾ing PUG-REST and PUG-View. Bulk data download via FTP is also supported.
Especially, the PubChem FTP site hosts PubChemRDF data, which helps users to
integrate PubChem data with in-house data or data from other resources across
scientific domains.
PubChem contains more than 110 million compounds, and the majority of them
are drug-like, satisfying all criteria of Ro5 or violating only one criterion of Ro5.
Because data from many public chemical databases(Table 2.1) are integrated within
PubChem, a substantial number of compoundsin these resources are also contained
in PubChem. In addition, 3.6 million compounds have been tested in at least one
bioassay in PubChem, and about half of them (1.5 million compounds) have been
declared active in at least one bioassay. While the majority of bioactivity data in
PubChem are generated from HTS, a substantial amount of data are extracted from
literature through text mining and manual curation. PubChem’s bioactivity data can
be used to build predictive models for the bioactivities of chemicals.

3.1 Introduction
The process of discovering new drugs has undergone substantial changes from the
historical paradigm of directly using natural products to high-throughput screening
(HTS) to the modern state-of-the-art that melds HTS and computational approaches
[1, 2]. Despite these advancements, drug discovery remains challenging; high attri￾tion rates and costs remain barriers to entry for smaller biotech companies and aca￾demic institutions[3].In addition, the promise of HTS as a meansfor overcoming the
practical limitations of smaller-scale molecular interaction studies has fallen short.
Antibiotics remain an illustrative example where, despite expansive library screen￾ing, few truly novel chemical scaffolds have been discovered since the 1960s [4].
Modern drug discovery follows a “target-centric” paradigm, wherein both a drug
candidate and at least one validated target will be identified prior to proceeding to
clinicalstudies[5]. This not only ensures a conceptual mechanistic rationale for drug
action but also facilitatesrefinement of the candidate molecule through the iterative
application of structure–activity relationship studies [6, 7]. Regardless of the exact
technologies used, the process of identifying both candidate molecules and targets
can be conceptually divided into two schemes, depending on the orderin which they
are sought [2].
In so-called “target-based” discovery [2], the firststep isthe identification of one or
more putative targets, whose properties may be manipulated through the addition of
specific molecules in order to achieve a therapeutic effect. These targets may be pri￾oritized based on previous data, by genetic signalslinking the target to the condition
in question (e.g. in genome-wide association studies), or may represent promising
hits identified in large-scale screening efforts [5]. Each putative target might then
serve as the basis for the development of one or more candidate molecules.

In contrast, “phenotypic-based” (sometimes referred to as “molecule-based”)
discovery [2] takes advantage of biological screening platforms with a well￾characterized phenotypic readout to screen large compound libraries. High-scoring
hits are then deconvoluted to identify the putative target(s) prior to more direct
target validation [8].
As the end result, a set of candidate molecules and known targets, remains
unchanged between these schemes, the choice of which approach to use is largely
contextual. More recent advances in the last approximately two decades have
also seen an increasing dependency across both schemes for computational tools.
The ability to investigate intermolecular interactions between putative candidate
molecules and proteins (e.g. by molecular docking) and to simulate these interac￾tionsin a temporal manner(e.g. by molecular dynamics) have significantly increased
the size of screening libraries from ∼106 compounds to virtual libraries of ∼1013
compounds [9]. More recently, artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)
tools that assist in target prediction, compound identification/design, high-content
screening, candidate retrosynthesis, and other areas have been developed [10, 11].
The potential for computational methods to revolutionize drug discovery
is undoubtedly exciting, but it brings new challenges with it. Computational
approaches require highly structured and accurate data in order to work effectively.
However, data within the biomedical space are often unstructured and diffuse,
being scattered across a collection of publications and databases, each with its own
specific schemas and formats.
In this chapter, we present an updated view of the DrugBank database. We
explore the nature and kinds of data within DrugBank, with an emphasis on the
structured nature of the data. Protocols are provided for the use of the free online
data and tools available through our website. Some examples of published research
using DrugBank are provided for further context and as starting points for further
exploration of the myriad ways in which this resource may assist those working
in the drug discovery field. Lastly, we discuss our current outlook and possible
avenues for future development.
3.2 DrugBank
3.2.1 Overview of DrugBank
DrugBank maintains a comprehensive database of drugs and related information,
which we will explore further in Section 3.2.2. Data within DrugBank are a mixture
of data imported from relevant databases, novel content authored by an in-house
curation team of pharmacists, doctors, and biomedical experts, and insights gener￾ated from proprietary ML-based workflows (Figure 3.1). Regardless of the source,
data within DrugBank are highly structured, such that they can be used to train ML
models or form the basis for novel algorithms and pipelines.
Although commercialized in 2015, DrugBank started as an academic research
project and is committed to supporting the research community through access3.2 DrugBank 69

Proprietary ML tools scour literary resources such as publications, monographs, public data
resources, and others to bring relevant content to an in-house curation team (top). This
team then vets the content, synthesizes multiple pieces, and authors novel information for
inclusion in the knowledgebase. Concurrently, recognized external datasets in the
biomedical space, such as ontologies related to drug products and their possible medical
effects, are imported and processed for inclusion into the knowledgebase (left). All of these
data together provide the potential for cyclical knowledge augmentation, wherein the
combination of information can yield new insights that are “larger than the sum of their
parts” (right). The combined information from all of these sources is provided to users in a
highly structured and usable format (bottom).
to free datasets and tools. Public-facing content is available as part of DrugBank
Online (https://go.drugbank.com/) and will form the bulk of this chapter. Further
support for academic (through our Academic+program) and commercial users,
including structured data downloads in a variety of formats, will not be discussed
in detail here but may be obtained through the “Solutions” tab at the top of this
webpage.
3.2.2 DrugBank Datasets
DrugBank contains a wide variety of datasets for use in both clinical and scientific
applications, not all of which will be discussed here. The primary purpose of this
section is to provide an overview of key datasets within DrugBank, including their70 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide
attributes and connections. Navigating to, and practical use of, these datasets will be
covered in Section 3.3.
3.2.2.1 Drug Cards: An Overview and Navigation Guide
The heart of DrugBank data is the drug entry, which in this context is synonymous
with active ingredient. At the time of authoring this chapter, there were 15,234 such
entries in the DrugBank database, each with a unique identifier prefixed by the
letters “DB” (referred to within this chapter as a “DBID”). One such example is
DB00316, corresponding to acetaminophen, one of the most commonly used anal￾gesics worldwide. These entries contain a variety of information, described below,
but also act as key hubs linking various other datasets within DrugBank.
Each drug entry has an associated drug card, analogous to gene or protein cards
in other biomedical databases, which summarizes information linked to the drug
(Figure 3.2a). Drug cards are divided into sections, which are navigated via a side
bar (Figure 3.2a). The majority of these sections contain further divisionsinto fields.
In these cases, clicking on the section name in the side bar will move the user to
the beginning of the section and will also expand the fields under that section in
the side bar (Figure 3.2b); field names can be selected to move to the corresponding
field. Each section represents a single unifying concept associated with a drug. These
sections are summarized in Table 3.1 and several are described in detail below.
3.2.2.2 Identification
The Identification section is the first information a user will see when navigating to
a drug card. As the name implies, this section is primarily concerned with providing
an overview of the drug and the various ways in which it may be referred to. The
Summary field provides a one- ortwo-sentence overview appropriate for a clinician
orscientist while the Background field provides a more in-depth explanation of the
drug, including its primary use and approval information; both fields are authored
in-house.
Below the Background field, there are several important identifiers associated
with the drug, such as the chemical structure, formula, and external identifiers
in other databases. The Type field categorizes the drug based on its chemical
properties and source, and its value will be either “Small Molecule” or “Biotech.”
Similarly, the Groups field summarizes the approval status of the drug, either
“Approved,” “Investigational,” “Experimental,” “Illicit,” “Vet Approved,” “Nu￾traceutical,” or “Withdrawn.” Investigational drugs are those that have not yet
been approved but are currently in clinical trials, whereas experimental drugs have
not yet reached clinical trials. The remaining field values are less common but
correspond to drugs that are approved for veterinary use, those that are primarily
based on natural products(nutraceutical), and those for which approved indications
do not exist (illicit/withdrawn). As approved drugs may also be investigated for
other indications, it is possible for a drug to have multiple values in this field.
The last notable field is Synonyms, which provide alternative names for the drug
in question. One obvious application of these is to assist in regional localization by
language, but drugs will often have several English synonyms as well. As an example,3.2 DrugBank 71

DB00316 (acetaminophen). (a) The view a user would see after navigating to the drug card.
Note the side navigation bar containing the drug card sections (also see Table 3.1). The
search widget at the top of this side bar allows users to search for specific sections or fields.

the view is centered on the first field within the section (ATC Codes) and that the four fields
available within Categories are shown in the side bar; these may be selected directly.
acetaminophen is usually referred to as paracetamol in the United Kingdom and
Europe. Searching any of these synonyms within DrugBank will retrieve the same
entry.
3.2.2.3 Pharmacology
The Pharmacology section contains a combination of unstructured text and links
to related structured data surrounding a drug’s pharmacodynamic and pharmacoki￾netic properties. The pharmacodynamic properties include the drug indication(s)
along with linked structured entries of the conditions for which the drug is indi￾cated (under Associated Conditions). If the drug is used in specific therapies or72 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide

pathways as well as a graphical depiction of the possible routes from starting
compounds to excreted metabolites (Figure 3.3). The final two fields in this section,
Pathways and Pharmacogenomic Effects/ADRs, provide links to structured
entries describing known pathways the drug is involved in and known genetic
associations related to drug action or safety, respectively.
3.2.2.4 Categories
The Categories section is primarily concerned with the ways in which the drug can
be classified. All relevant ATC codes [12] are provided; each listed code is a hyper￾link that, when clicked, will navigate to a representation of the ATC code hierarchy
focused on the code in question.
The Drug Categories field contains a tabular list of associated DrugBank cate￾gories, each of which has a unique identifier prefixed with “DBCAT.” These cate￾gories are a union of external sources, including ATC [12], MeSH [13], and EPC
[14], with our own proprietary in-house curation. Navigating to the individual cat￾egory page yields more detailed information for each, including a description, a list
of drugs categorized into the category, and targets (see Section 3.2.2.6) for each of
these drugs. In this way, it is possible to easily discern, which targets represent pos￾sible drug targets for a given category of drugs.
The Chemical Taxonomy field provides a classification on the basis of chemical
structure, powered by the ClassyFire tool [15]. In keeping with the output of Classy￾Fire itself, the first four levels of taxonomy, “Kingdom,” “Super Class,” “Class,” and
“Sub Class,” are provided, together with the direct parent and alternative parents.
These categories are hyperlinked to the relevant entry within the ClassyFire website
[15] and a description of each is provided as hover text. Links to the classification
in other taxonomies/ontologies are provided, when available. In addition, a full list
of the extracted substituents, including functional groups, is provided under the
Substituents field, which may be useful in grouping or comparing chemicals (see
Section 3.3.2.2).
3.2.2.5 Properties
The Properties section compiles experimental and predicted properties. The State
and the Experimental Properties fields are curated based on Material Safety
Data Sheets (MSDS) and other relevant literature. A number of chemical prop￾erties are predicted using ALOGPS [16] or ChemAxon (https://chemaxon.com/;
Figure 3.4a), and a selection of ADMET properties are predicted using admetSAR
[17] (Figure 3.4b).
3.2.2.6 Targets, Enzymes, Carriers, and Transporters
Four (possibly absent) sections of a drug card include the associated targets,
enzymes, carriers, and transporters. The Targets section contains entries for each
biomolecule that the drug is known to directly bind; the type of biomolecule
is denoted by the Kind field, which may hold a value of “protein,” “protein74 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide

group,” “nucleotide,” “small molecule,” or “group.” Proteins are the most common
kind of target and include information pulled from UniProt [18]. More detailed
information can be obtained by clicking on the hyperlinked UniProt ID. Protein
groups are a collection of proteins; target entries of this kind have an additional
table, “components,” that lists the constituent proteins. Protein groups are used
in cases where the drug targets a protein complex, where experimental evidence
cannot adequately discern between specific members of a protein family, or where
the presumed target is deduced on the basis of phenotype rather than detailed
molecular studies. Nucleotides, small molecules, and groups have different sets of
included information, but will not be discussed in detail here.76 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide
Each target will be associated with an organism. This is usually humans but, in
other cases such as anti-infectives, may correspond to a different organism. The
Pharmacological Action field will hold one of three possible values: “yes,” “no,”
or “unknown.” A value of “yes” indicates that this drug–biomolecule interaction is
known to contribute to the drug’s therapeutic effect while “no” indicates the oppo￾site; a value of “unknown” indicates that there is insufficient evidence to either
demonstrate or rule out a therapeutic effect. If the value is “yes,” the target will also
be mentioned in the MoA field underthe Pharmacology section (see Section 3.2.2.3).
The Actions field contains one or more entries capturing the effect of the drug on
the biomolecule. This can be as simple as “binder,” but is often more specific. A list
of common possible actions is given in Table 3.2.
The Enzymes section captures information for enzymes known to participate
in the drug’s metabolism. If an enzyme is the target of a drug action (e.g. suicide
inhibitors), it will be listed in the Targets section instead. Similar to protein
Table 3.2 List of common actions within DrugBank.
Action Description
Agonist The drug promotes the activity of the target (usually a
receptor).
Antagonist The drug reduces the activity of the target (usually a
receptor).
Partial Agonist As above, but the drug does not fully promote the activity.
Activator The drug activates the target, increasing its ability to induce
a given effect or promote a specific process.
Inhibitor The drug inhibits the target, preventing it from carrying out
its normal function.
Inducer The drug induces the target, either directly or by increasing
its transcription or translation (usually relevant with
enzymes).
Binder The drug binds to the target.
Ligand The drug forms a complex with the target.
Cofactor The drug serves as a cofactor for the target.
Potentiator The drug does not directly activate the target but alters its
activation threshold for another molecule.
Antibody The drug is an antibody (or derivative) that specifically
binds the target.
Modulator The drug alters the activity of the target.
Positive Allosteric
Modulator
The drug increases the activity of the target by binding to a
site removed from the main active site.
Product of The drug is a product of the target (usually an enzyme).
Regulator The drug regulates the target.
This table lists the most frequent (used at least 50 times) actions between drugs and biomolecules
within DrugBank and a description of their meaning.3.3 Protocols 77
targets, enzyme entries contain additional information associated with the relevant
UniProt entry. The Pharmacological Action field for an enzyme is usually either
“no” or “unknown,” but maybe “yes” in some cases, such as if an enzyme is
known to activate a prodrug. Common actions include “substrate,” “inducer,”
and “inhibitor.” Induction and inhibition of common metabolic enzymes, or the
identification of the drug as a substrate of such enzymes, including those of the
CYP superfamily, are usually mirrored with corresponding DBCAT category entries
(see Section 3.2.2.4).
Carriers and Transporters are additionalsectionsthat relate to blood protein bind￾ing and cross-membrane transport of the drug, respectively. Both sections will sim￾ilarly relate to UniProt entries. The Pharmacological Action field for carriers and
transporters is usually either “no” or “unknown.” Rare exceptions may be found
though, such as when induction/inhibition of a transporter is the intended mecha￾nistic action of the drug, or when a drug requires a transporter to reach its intended
therapeutic target.
3.2.2.7 References
An important trait for all data within DrugBank is the presence of associated refer￾ences. These references may correspond to published literature indexed in PubMed,
other published literature such as textbooks, or links to online resources. The Syn￾thesis Reference field provides either a patent or other literature reference that
describes in detail how to synthesize the drug. The General References field con￾tains references that are cited throughout the drug card. Each in-text reference call￾out is formatted to match this section and is available as hover text on the callout
itself. Also included in this section are external links to related page entries and any
related protein structures in the PDB [19, 20].
3.3 Protocols
3.3.1 General Workflows
Described below are several general protocols for utilizing DrugBank Online. Read￾ers will be shown how to conduct both a basic and advanced search of DrugBank
and how to browse drugs via DrugBank’s drug categories. These protocols and their
accompanying descriptions are intended to provide users with a practical guide for
a handful of DrugBank Online’s numerous functionalities, with a focus on features
useful in the realm of drug discovery.
3.3.1.1 Using DrugBank Online’s Search Functionality
The landing page of DrugBank Online has search functionality allowing users to
search across more than 15,000 drugs and 500,000 drug products. Entering the name
of a drug, or a branded drug product, will pull up the relevant drug card and all
of its associated data (described in Section 3.2.2). Searching via unique chemical
identifiers (e.g. CAS or UNII) is also supported. Additionally, users can search via78 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide

(c)
Figure 3.5 Using DrugBank Online’s basic search functionality. This figure shows a
screenshot of the landing page search bar (a) and the smaller search bar accessible below
the upper navigation bar (b). Searches that return a single match will jump the user directly
to the relevant page, while searches with multiple results (c) will display in list format.
keywords – for example, “tricyclic” or “glycopeptide” – to find any drugs relevant
to those terms. The search bar also allows users to search through DrugBank’s drug
targets, pathways, and indications (Figure 3.5).
In this first protocol, we will perform a simple search for a drug molecule. To begin,
navigate to the DrugBank Online search barfound centered in the landing page near
the bottom of the window (Figure 3.5a) or in the top right of the window beneath
the navigation bar (Figure 3.5b). Next:3.3 Protocols 79
1. Enter a drug, drug product, or keyword for which to search. Ensure the filter is
set appropriately (in this case to “Drugs”) and click the magnifying glass or press
“Enter” to run the search.
a. As discussed above, DrugBank Online’ssearch function also supportssearches
using unique chemical identifiers, e.g. CAS numbers, DBIDs, or UNIIs.
2. Searchesreturning an exact match will direct the userimmediately to the relevant
drug card (Section 3.2.2.1). If an exact match is not found, or if the user is search￾ing via keyword, any relevantresults will be displayed in list format (Figure 3.5c).
a. Each result will display the name of the drug, an excerpt from its Background
data (see Section 3.2.2.2), and a list of drug card sections within which the
search term was matched.
b. Thislist can be further filtered by market availability and/or Group (discussed
in Section 3.2.2.2) using the buttons at the top of the page.
3. Individual drug cards can be viewed by clicking the name of the desired drug
from the list of search results.
a. See Section 3.2.2 of this document for detailed information regarding the con￾tent of each section of the drug card.
4. The search bar additionally allows users to search through DrugBank’s targets,
pathways, and indications data.
a. Targets, as described in Section 3.2.2.6, are proteins or other biomolecules
with which a drug may interact to exert its pharmacologic effect(s). After
selecting the “Target” filter under the search bar, users can enter the name
of a protein (e.g. “Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)”) to return a list of
targets matching that name. Each result will display the name of the matched
target and the specific sections of the target’s data to which the search term
was matched. Clicking the hyperlinked name of the target will direct the user
to a page containing more detailed information about the target in question,
including the Kind of the target (e.g. “protein”), the organism in which it is
present, its UniProt ID, and a list of drugs with which it is known to interact.
b. Pathways are visual representations of physiologic or pharmacologic pro￾cesses. DrugBank Online allows users to search through the Small Molecule
Pathway Database (SMPDB) [21, 22], which contains more than 48,000
pathways comprising drug-specific pathways illustrating the metabolism and
MoA of a given drug, as well as various biological processesinvolved in disease
pathogenesis, signaling, and metabolism. After selecting the “Pathways” filter
under the search bar, users can search for relevant pathways by entering the
name of a drug, disease, or other physiological phenomena. For example,
searching for the term “Insulin” returns a pathway illustrating endogenous
insulin signaling, and also returns several results illustrating mechanistic
pathways for drugs affecting insulin secretion and production. Each search
result displays a truncated description of the pathway along with a list of drugs
and enzymes relevant to that pathway. Clicking the hyperlinked pathway
name will open a new window wherein the pathway and its description can
be viewed in full.80 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide
c. Indications, discussed briefly in Section 3.2.2.3, are the diseases or condi￾tions for which a given drug may be used. After selecting the “Indications”
filter under the search bar, users can enter the name of a condition (e.g. “mi￾graine”) to return a list of matching conditions. Each search result displaysthe
name of the condition, the section of the condition’s data within which the
search term was matched, and a list of drugs indicated for the given condition.
Clicking the hyperlinked condition name will direct the userto a page contain￾ing additional information about the condition, including potentialsynonyms,
additional information about any indicated drugs, a list of targets for the indi￾cated drugs, and a list of clinical trials examining the condition in question.
i. Alternatively, users can search through “Indications” data by searching for
a drug of interest rather than a condition. Selecting the “Indications” filter
and searching for the name of a drug will return a list of conditions for
which the queried drug may be used.
DrugBank Online’s basic search functionality provides a simple and intuitive means
ofsearching through DrugBank data.It issimple enough for a member of the general
public to use, while simultaneously providing enough detail and flexibility to meet
the needs of healthcare practitioners, academics, and other professionals requiring
detailed and comprehensive drug data. For users wanting to build more complicated
queries, DrugBank Online has an advanced search functionality discussed in detail
below.
3.3.1.2 Using DrugBank Online’s Advanced Search Functionality
The advanced search function provides an additional means of searching Drug￾Bank’s data. Users can build powerful queries using search conditions, predicates,
and operators to fine-tune their search criteria and the displayed results. The
advanced search function supports searches of both drug and target data and allows
for the use of wildcard matching (using * or ?) and exact matching (using quotation
marks) in addition to the built-in search conditions and predicates (Figure 3.6).
In this protocol, we will perform an advanced search of DrugBank’s data.
From the DrugBank Online landing page, navigate to the advanced search page
(https://go.drugbank.com/unearth/advanced/drugs) by clicking the Search button
in the navigation bar at the top of the window and selecting Advanced Search.
Next:
1. To start building our advanced search query, scroll down to the Search Condi￾tions section and select Add Search Condition. Users can input as many search
conditions as required to achieve the desired results.
a. By default, the search will be set to match all of the specified search conditions
(i.e. condition 1 and condition 2). Alternatively, selecting the “all” dropdown
and changing it to “any” will search for drugs or targets matching any of the
specified search conditions (i.e. condition 1 or condition 2).
2. For this exercise, we will use the advanced search to generate a list of approved
ACE inhibitor drugs along with the CAS number, UNII, and average mass for
each. ACE inhibitors are a class of antihypertensive drugs used in the treatment3.3 Protocols 81
(a)
(b)
Figure 3.6 Using DrugBank Online’s advanced search functionality. This figure shows the
process of conducting an advanced search. (a) The completed advanced query includes
multiple search conditions and display fields. (b) Search results are displayed in list format,
with each result containing the fields used in the search conditions and requested in the
display fields.
and management of cardiovascular diseases. As per World Health Organization
(WHO) guidance around International Nonproprietary Names (INN), inhibitors
of ACE are given the suffix “-pril” [23]. Forthe firstsearch condition, the field and
predicate can remain in their default state (“Name” and “matches”) – this will
search through drug names in DrugBank and return any results that match the
query entered in the “search drug name” textbox. To complete the firstsearch con￾dition, type *pril into the textbox – because the asterisk can be used as a wildcard
matching any number of characters, this search term will find any drug names
that end with the string “pril.”82 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide
a. The first dropdown box for a given search condition specifies the field in
which the user wishes to search. The advanced search function supports a
number of search fields, including drug identifiers and chemical properties
(e.g. brands/products, CAS number, InChI, chemical formula, and predicted
logP) as well as drug type and availability (e.g. small molecule, approved, and
withdrawn; see Section 3.2.2.2), among others.
b. The second dropdown box for a given search condition specifies the predicate,
which simply tells the search how to query the chosen field for the inputted
text. Predicates provide additional search flexibility by allowing users to build
more complex queries – for example, the predicate in the above exercise may
be set to “does not match” to generate a list of drugs that do not contain the
string “pril.” Supported predicates are dependent on the selected search field,
and in general include functions like “does not equal,” “starts with,” and “is
present,” among others.
i. Manipulating the predicate in the above example allows us to run a similar
search without using the wildcard (*) character. With the search field set
to “Name,” we can set the predicate to “ends with” and type “pril” in the
textbox, this anchors the search to the end of the string and will find any
instances in which a drug name ends with the suffix “-pril.”
ii. Wildcard searching issupported when the predicate isset to either “match￾es” or “does not match.” Users can input an asterisk (*) to match any num￾ber of characters or a question mark (?) to match a single character.
3. After completing the first search condition, select Add Search Condition to
include another. For this exercise, we want to search only for approved ACE
inhibitor drugs, so click the search field dropdown and select “Approved.”
a. When the selected search field can only evaluate to true or false (i.e. the drug
is either approved or is not), the available predicates will also change to reflect
this. After selecting “Approved,” leave the predicate set to its default state, “is
true.”
4. With our search conditions set, we next need to set display fields. These are addi￾tional fields that will appear alongside our search results, which are not part of
the actual query. Click the Add Display Field button to create our first display
field.
a. Display fields can be selected from the same list available for search fields (e.g.
Name, CAS number, and InChI). They do not require a predicate or the input
of a query, as they are simply additional pieces of data that we would like to
display alongside our search results.
5. We will set three display fields: one each for CAS number, UNII, and average
mass. First, create two more display fields by clicking the Add Display Field
button two more times. In the first display field, select “CAS Number.” In the
second, select “UNII,” and in the third select “Average mass.”
a. Similar to creating search conditions, users can add as many display fields as
necessary to achieve the desired results.
6. Once the appropriate search conditions and display fields are set (Figure 3.6a),
clicking the Search button will generate the search results below the search3.3 Protocols 83
widget. Each result will first display the data found by the search conditions – in
this case, “Name” and whether the drug is “Approved” – followed by the
specified display fields. By default, each returned drug will also populate with its
approval status (e.g. approved, withdrawn, and investigational) in its top-right
corner (Figure 3.6b).
7. Users with a free DrugBank Online account can export the results of an advanced
search as a CSV file.
a. To create a new DrugBank Online account, click the Sign Up button near the
top of the advanced search page and follow the instructions provided. If you
have an existing DrugBank Online account, click Login and enter your user￾name and password.
b. Once signed in, users can export theirsearch resultsin CSV format by clicking
the Export button found at the top-right of the search results.
8. The advanced search function also supports searches of DrugBank’s drug tar￾get data. To search through targets instead of drugs, click the Target Advanced
Search button in the top-right of the advanced search page.
a. The functionality of the target advanced search is essentially identical to that
of the drug search. Users can add one or more search conditions, specifying a
search field and, if necessary, a predicate and text query for each. Display fields
can also be added to target searches, and search results can be exported using
the method described in Step 7.
b. Rather than returning a list of drugs, target searches return a list of
biomolecules that may interact with drugs (e.g. receptors and enzymes). The
available search fields for this dataset are different than those available for the
advanced drug search, with more focus on target-specific data like UniProt
ID and taxonomy.
DrugBank Online’s advanced search functionality serves to illustrate the power
and potential of DrugBank data. The flexibility afforded by this advanced search, as
well as the ability to export its results, means that users can generate highly focused
and specific datasets for use in a variety of applications, such as ML (see Section
3.3.3). A less focused exploration of drugs and compounds with similar traits can be
achieved by browsing through DrugBank Online’s drug categories as described in
the following section.
3.3.1.3 Browsing Drugs Using DrugBank Online’s Drug Categories
As described in Section 3.2.2.4, drugs in DrugBank are assigned categories that
serve to group similar drugs together based on shared characteristics. Drugs may
be grouped into categories based on mechanistic similarities (e.g. “Proton Pump
Inhibitors”), pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. “CYP3A4 Substrates”), structural
similarities (e.g. “Catecholamines”), or clinical use (e.g. “Antifungal Agents”).
Grouping like drugs together within drug categories can help to elucidate common￾alities between member drugs, for example, a common target that might represent
an MoA or a common metabolic pathway through which member drugs may be
metabolized.84 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide
1. From the DrugBank Online landing page, navigate to the drug category browser
(https://go.drugbank.com/categories) by clicking the Browse tab in the naviga￾tion bar at the top of the page and selecting Categories.
a. Individual categories can also be accessed directly from a drug card by clicking
the hyperlinked title of the category of interest from the “Categories” section
of the drug card (see Section 3.2.2.4).
2. Drug categories are presented as a searchable table that can be filtered by the
approval status and/or market availability of the drugs within them.
a. Each category in the table contains the name of the category, a truncated
description of the category, the number of drugs within the category, and the
total number of targets associated with those drugs.
i. The category table can be additionally filtered via these columns. Users can
search through category names and descriptions by inputting their search
term(s) in the text boxes at the top of each column. Inputting a value into
the text box at the top of the “# of drugs” or “# of targets” column will filter
the table to show only the categories, which contain a number of drugs or
targets greater than or equal to the value input at the top of the column.
b. Clicking the hyperlinked category name will direct the user to a category￾specific page with additional information about the selected category.
3. For this exercise, we will navigate to the “ACE inhibitors” category in order to
view the same drugs returned in the advanced search query outlined in Section
3.3.1.2. In the textbox at the top of the category column, type “enzyme inhibitors”
and click the magnifying glass or hit “Enter” to filter the list down to a handful
of categories (Figure 3.7a). Navigate to the category page for “ACE inhibitors” by
clicking the hyperlinked category name in the leftmost column.
4. Every category in DrugBank has a number of data fields that can be viewed
from the page of that specific category. Information about the category as a
whole includes its name, accession number (a 6-digit number prefixed with
“DBCAT”), a description of the category, and its equivalent ATC classification
[12] (Figure 3.7a).
a. Some categoriesin DrugBank are associated with multiple accession numbers,
which will be indicated by additional bracketed accession numbers following
the first. This meansthat two (or more) categories were, atsome point, deemed
synonymous and merged together.
b. Within each category, users can browse through its member drugs and their
associated targets, or search through drugs and targets using the search bar in
the top right of the respective sections. In the “Drugs” section of the page, each
drug contained within the category will populate with its name (hyperlinked
to the relevant drug card) and a brief description of the drug. In the “Drug
& Drug Targets” section, the targets for each drug will display alongside the
name of the drug and the type of relationship between the drug and its target
(see Section 3.2.2.6 for more information on types of drug–target interactions).
Both the drug name and the target names in this section are hyperlinked to
their respective pages on DrugBank Online.3.3 Protocols 85

Categories can be broadly filtered by group or market availability (of the drugs within
them), or more specifically searched via the text boxes at the top of each column.
(b) DrugBank’s drug category page for ACE inhibitors. Note that both the “Drugs” and “Drugs
and Drug Targets” lists can be searched using the search box to the upper-right of each list,
and can be reordered using the up-down arrow icons at the top of each column.
Organizing drugsinto categories allows usersto examine groups ofsimilar drugs at a
higher level of abstraction. Previously hidden relationships might become apparent
when browsing drugs in this way – for example, we may notice a target or enzyme
common to several members of a given drug category that can provide clues or
additional context in the process of drug discovery or in the evaluation of a newly
synthesized molecule.86 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide
3.3.2 Identifying Chemicals and Relevant Sequences
Text searching, including both basic (Section 3.3.1.1) and advanced (Section 3.3.1.2)
searching, was covered in Section 3.3. It is also possible to query DrugBank using
richer data structures including chemical structures and nucleic acid or protein
sequences.
3.3.2.1 Searching Using Chemical Structure Search
DrugBank Online’s chemical structure search, powered by ChemAxon (https://
chemaxon.com/), allows users to search for drugs based on their similarity to a
specified chemical structure. This type of search functionality is particularly useful
for chemists who are interested in finding similar molecules to newly synthesized
or identified compounds. It is also useful for searching for compounds that have
the same parent molecule or belong to the same drug class.
1. From the DrugBank Online landing page, navigate to the chemical structure
search (https://go.drugbank.com/structures/search/small_molecule_drugs/
structure) by clicking on the Search tab in the navigation bar and selecting
Chemical Structure (Figure 3.8a).
a. By default, the search parameters are set to find drugs based on their “Similar￾ity” with a similarity threshold of 0.7 and will return a maximum of up to 100
results. These parameters can be adjusted as described in the next step.
b. Structures can be manually drawn into the MarvinJS drawing applet using the
provided tools in the drawing box. If a SMILES, InChI, or similar identifier is
known, it can also be pasted into the canvas. For a complete explanation of the
MarvinJS drawing applet, refer to its official documentation [24] or click the
MarvinJS Tutorials button at the lower-right of the window.
c. To view an example of a pre-drawn structure, click the “Load example” button
located on the lower right side of the window.
2. To modify orrefine a structure similarity search, users can edit the search options
located to the right of the drawing canvas.
a. Users can use radio buttonsto specify that a query structure be searched based
on its “Similarity” to other molecules, whetherit is a “Substructure” contained
within other drugs, orto specify thatit must be an “Exact” match to other drugs
in DrugBank.
b. Additionally, users can adjust query parameters to specify a similarity thresh￾old, a minimum and maximum molecular weight, the maximum number of
displayed results, and the types of drugs returned.
c. The similarity threshold allows usersto set a minimum similarity score for the
results of a chemical structure similarity search. A similarity score is a value
between 0 and 1 that represents the degree of similarity between the queried
structure and each returned structure, with a greater value indicating greater
similarity. These scores are generated by first creating a chemical hashed
fingerprint – a bit string encoding structural features – of the structure
being queried, which by default is a 1024-bit fingerprint with a maximum
pattern length of seven. Using this fingerprint, the Tanimoto similarity3.3 Protocols 87

metric between the queried structure and other structures in the database
is calculated. A more technical explanation of similarity scores is available
via ChemAxon’s documentation [25]. Note that the minimum allowable
similarity threshold is 0.3 – attempting to set it any lower will instead run the
search using the default value of 0.7.
3. For this exercise, we will assume the role of a researcher interested in developing
a novel anabolic steroid. We will draw the structure of testosterone, a simple
anabolic steroid, directly in the MarvinJS canvas in order to examine previously
synthesized testosterone derivatives and identify potential novel derivatives
that have yet to be tested. We will leave the stereochemistry of our molecule
unspecified – when the queried structure does not contain stereo information, the
search results will include molecules both with and without stereo information.88 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide
a. To start, we will draw the four-ring steroid nucleus common to all steroid
compounds, which comprises three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane
ring. Select the cyclohexane ring from the bottom of the canvas and attach
two along their vertical axis, with the third attached to the top-right face of
the rightmost ring. Select the cyclopentane ring and attach it to the right side
of the third cyclohexane ring.
i. At this stage, it is useful to index (i.e. number) the atoms for ease of refer￾ence. Click the “View settings” button at the top of the canvas, represented
by a cogwheel icon, check the “Index atoms” checkbox, then hit “Ok.”
b. Next, we need to add some functional groups. Select the bond tool from the
left side of the canvas and add a single bond to carbons 3, 6, 12, and 17 by
clicking on each carbon. Note that, by default, the addition of a single bond
to an atom will attach a methyl group to the other end of that bond. Carbons
6 and 12 require methyl groups, but carbons 3 and 17 require a ketone and
hydroxyl group, respectively.
c. Select the oxygen atom from the right side of the canvas, and click on the
methyl group attached to carbons 3 and 17. This action will substitute the
carbon atom at these positions with oxygen and results in a hydroxyl group
attached to both carbons 3 and 17.
d. Finally, we will add a double bond between carbons 4 and 5, and to the
hydroxyl group at carbon 3 to create a ketone. Select the bond tool again and
click on the existing bond between carbons 4 and 5 to make it into a double
bond. Similarly, click on the single bond between carbon 3 and its hydroxyl
group to convert it into a double bond and the hydroxyl group into a ketone.
i) The complete structure should look identical to the one shown in
Figure 3.8b.
4. Prior to executing the search, click the “Approved” checkbox to limit the results
to only compounds, which have been approved for use in humans. The remain￾der of the search options can stay in their default setting. After confirming your
structure and search options, click the “Search” button to run the search.
5. The list of search results will appear below the MarvinJS structure editor and
will be organized in descending order of similarity to the queried structure
(Figure 3.8c). Each result will display along with a number of data points,
including the DrugBank ID, a similarity score (with higher scores indicating
better matches), a vector image of the matched structure, the name and CAS
number of the matched drug, its approval status, and its formula and molecular
weight.
a. Clicking the DrugBank ID will direct you to the DrugBank drug card entry for
that compound.
b. Clicking the vector image of the returned structure will open a new window
with a larger image.
6. The abovementioned protocol has described the stepsinvolved in drawing a struc￾ture for which to search in MarvinJS. As mentioned previously, the structure
search can also generate structures to query based on certain chemical notation
formats like SMILES or InChI. If a compound already has a known SMILES or3.3 Protocols 89
InChI string, copying and pasting this string directly into the canvas is generally
much easier and faster than drawing a structure from scratch.
7. A structure similarity search can also be performed from directly within a
DrugBank drug card. In the “Identification” section of the drug card, next to the
“Structure” heading, is an image of the drug’s structure (Figure 3.8d). Clicking
the button labeled “Similar Structures” directly below will immediately run a
structure similarity search using all of the default search options and return a
list of similar structures and their similarity scores.
This kind of chemical structure-based searching has a number of potential applica￾tions in regard to drug discovery. In the example above, our search returned a list of
approved drug molecules with a structure similarto testosterone. One potential next
step might be to examine structural differences in these testosterone derivatives as
compared to their relative potencies in order to determine the importance of certain
functional groups and their position within the molecule. Even thisrelatively simple
approach can provide the context required to guide further research and narrow the
focus of future drug discovery efforts.
When the structure is determined for a newly discovered or synthesized bioactive
compound, it can often provide clues as to the compound’s potential actions – in
other words, structural similarity to an existing compound might imply a similar
mechanism. Taking our admittedly simplified example from above,suppose we were
unaware that our starting compound was testosterone. By running a structure sim￾ilarity search and looking at the results, we could immediately identify our mystery
compound assome type ofsteroid, and could then make inferences about thingslike
its MoA and pharmacokinetics based on known properties of similar compounds.
Thissearch can also be used to identify potential protein targets(viewable by clicking
the hyperlinked DrugBank ID), predict side effects, and predict unexpected interac￾tions with unintended protein targets.
3.3.2.2 Using Sequence Search to Find Similar Targets
It is possible to search DrugBank forsimilar protein sequencesto a known sequence,
including targets, enzymes, carriers, and transporters. This can be useful to under￾stand the types of molecules that are known to interact with your sequence (in cases
of an exact match) or sequences similar to your sequence. The similarity search is
powered by BLAST [26].
As an example, assume you have identified a putative target sequence based
on in silico or in vitro means, and wish to understand the chemical nature of
drugs that may bind to it. Navigate to the search page (https://go.drugbank.com/
structures/search/bonds/sequence), either by selecting Search -> Target Sequences
from the main navigation bar or manually entering the URL; you should see an
input form (Figure 3.9a). Next:
1. Enter one or more DNA or protein sequences to search in the main text input
box at the top of the form. These sequencesshould be in FASTA format (hovering
over the small question mark icon at the top right provides a full explanation of
this input format).90 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide
(a)
(b)
Figure 3.9 Using the DrugBank Online sequence search. This figure provides an overview
of using the DrugBank Online sequence searching tool. (a) The sequence input form, which
accepts one or more FASTA-formatted nucleic acid or protein sequences. Users can adjust a
subset of BLAST parameters using the entry fields and radio buttons. The filters allow users
to restrict the search to sequences associated with subsets of drugs based on approval
status and to specific types of sequences (target, enzyme, carrier, or transporter; see Section
3.2.2.6). (b) The first result displayed after searching using the human C-X-C chemokine
receptor type 5. Note the hit metrics in the top right and the BLAST output alignment
present below; exact matches are denoted by the one-letter code between sequences, while
similar residues are denoted with a plus symbol (“+”). The bottom table lists the drugs with
which the identified sequence has known interactions in DrugBank.
2. Adjust the BLAST parameters, if desired. Note that not all parameters available
in BLAST, such as the choice of substitution matrix, are available to change. The
“Expectation value” controls the cutoff for returning hits; increasing this value
will result in more hits but many more will be only slightly similar to the target
sequence. The default gap opening cost is set at one (as opposed to the normal
BLAST default of 11); this may result in hits with more gaps than otherwise3.3 Protocols 91
expected. For a full explanation of BLAST parameters, see the official manual
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/).
3. Adjust the “Drug Types” filter. Only sequences associated with drugs of the
selected type will be considered when searching. This is useful if, for example,
you wish to consider only approved drugs, whose protein binding and MoA are
more likely to be known in considerable detail. Alternatively, filtering to all but
approved drugs provides insight on scaffolds currently under investigation.
4. Adjust the “Protein Types” filter. Setting this can narrow the search to the most
relevant type of sequence, given the starting query (see Section 3.2.2.6 for a full
explanation of each protein type).
5. Run the search (press the “Search” button).
Continuing the scenario from above, you run a search with your unknown sequence
using the default BLAST parameters, including approved, withdrawn, investiga￾tional, and experimental drugs, and limiting the protein types to targets. BLAST
returns 73 matches, the first of which is shown in Figure 3.9b. Each hit contains
the name of the hit, together with the hit E value, bit score, and alignment length.
Briefly, BLAST identifies small local matches between query and target sequence,
which it attempts to extend in either direction while obeying set cutoff parameters.
The longest such alignment is used to score the hit, and is also provided as part
of the hit itself; in the view here, the alignment is shown on a single line and may
be scrolled to the left or right if it does not fully fit within the hit table. Lastly, all
relevant drug–protein interactions that fit the protein types filter are included.
Inspecting the hitsforthe unknown sequence, it is clearthat the top hits all belong
to the CXC and CC chemokine receptor families, with E values ranging from e−48 to
e−33. Indeed, the unknown query is the human C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5
(UniProt ID P32302). Although the next hit, the type 1 angiotensin II receptor, has
a good E value (e−27), it represents a clear departure from the cluster of top hits and
will not be considered.
To get a sense of what kinds of chemical scaffolds can effectively target CXC/CC
chemokine receptors, we can more closely investigate the hits. There are nine small
molecules in the top hits, which are listed as either antagonist or inhibitor and for
which a fullstructure complete with chemical classification (provided in the Chem￾ical Taxonomy field of the Categoriessection in the relevant drug card) is present in
DrugBank (Figure 3.10a). Although some similarities are apparent across scaffolds,
such as a generally extended conformation and the presence of phenyl groups and
amines, the scaffolds appear diverse.
It is possible to conduct a rudimentary chemical similarity analysis using
data extracted directly from DrugBank. For all nine structures identified, the
“Substituents” provided as part of the chemical taxonomy were extracted and
used to produce a 9 × 94 matrix of one-hot encoded features. The most common
chemical features across all molecules (present in at least three drugs) are shown
in Figure 3.10b. Confirming the visual inspection of the compounds, the various
nitrogen-containing functional groups make up a large proportion of the results,
together with heteroaromatics, various oxygen-containing groups, and alkyl
fluorides.92 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide

Figure 3.10 A simple structural analysis of sequence search results. This figure shows an
example of how searching for similar sequences to a putative target can help to inform
compound design. (a) Molecules identified within DrugBank to interact with top hits in a
resulting search (see text for more details). (b) A histogram showing the prevalence of
chemical features in the molecules identified in (A). For ease of visualization, features
present in two or fewer molecules are not included. (c) 3D visualization of the full
constituent feature matrix following PCA projection onto three components. It is clear that
there are two clusters, which may serve as starting points for further analysis.
Furthermore, by using principal component analysis to project the full chemical
feature matrix onto three components, it is possible to visualize the relation￾ships between these drugs (Figure 3.10c). The resulting image reveals separation
between most drugs, though INCB-9471 and vicriviroc are similar, as antici￾pated based on their structures. There is a single larger cluster of cenicriviroc,
plerixafor, AMD-070, and MSX-122, which is not immediately apparent from
a visual inspection of their structures. Furthermore, all but cenicriviroc inter￾act with the most similar hit in the original BLAST search, C-X-C chemokine
receptor type 4. This suggests that focusing on these structures, and similar ones
to them, might be a reasonable place to start when identifying a new bioactive
compound.3.3 Protocols 93
Although small-scale and highly simplistic, this example provides insight into
how sequence searching may assist in the discovery of targets and the prioritization
of potential scaffolds for downstream discovery work.
3.3.3 Extracting DrugBank Datasets for ML
Machine learning (ML) is increasingly applied across healthcare, from the analysis
of imaging data to a myriad of applications within drug discovery pipelines [10, 27].
Although model development in these relatively new and exciting areas remains an
important consideration, we argue that data quality is crucial, as health informat￾ics represents a high-stakes domain [28]. Combined with the generally recognized
“unreasonable effectiveness of data” [29], assuming a data-centric approach [30] to
model training and continuous deployment practices may reap significant benefits
to organizations and patients alike.
Although we do not aim to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant ML
techniques here, we do highlight several ways in which public users may obtain
large, focused datasetsfor use in building and evaluating their models. These may be
used in model training, in validation of models trained on experimental or in-house
datasets, or in some combination of training and testing. The datasets discussed
below require a free account to access, which academic users may request using a
simple form (available at: https://go.drugbank.com/public_users/sign_up; account
requests require approval, which may take up to two business days to process).
The Advanced Search functionality discussed in Section 3.3.1.2 provides a pow￾erful mechanism for querying and filtering the complete sets of drugs and targets
within DrugBank. The results of a search may be exported as a CSV file, by clicking
on the “Export” button at the top of the search results list (Figure 3.6b). By combin￾ing search filtering with a number of display field selections it is possible to create
a focused custom dataset that can easily be loaded into an ML system or relational
database system as tabular data.
Whole datasets may also be accessed underthe “Downloads” tab of the main menu
bar (or by navigating to https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest). The “Complete
Database” provides a wealth of information for all current DrugBank drugs in XML
format with an associated schema. Relevant attributes for drug discovery include
drug approval status, structural information including classifications, experimen￾tal and predicted properties, and detailed target and metabolism information; other
information is also provided, which may be useful depending on the desired use case.
Simplified scientific data extracts are available through the headings at the top of
the download page in SDF, CSV, and FASTA formats. These datasets have the advan￾tage of being presorted into various categories, such as those based on the drug type
and approvalstatus.In addition to their potential use in ML applications, these other
formats provide additional compatibility with existing software. Drug structures in
SDF format may serve as the basis for cheminformatic studies or for in silico struc￾tural work. Sequences in FASTA format are easily used in comparative methods to
find similar sequences (e.g. Section 3.3.2.2) or to study target relationships using
phylogenetics.94 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide
A key advantage of the DrugBank datasets is the combination of breadth, depth,
and accuracy, made possible by the combination of automated and curated data
intake within DrugBank (Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.7, Figure 3.1). Studies have con￾sistently demonstrated the importance of data completeness and accuracy in the
performance of a wide variety of ML models (e.g. see [31]). The highly structured
nature of these datasets allows users to easily experiment with the addition of new
features to their models, while our commitment to depth (completeness) and accu￾racy of data, and the inclusion of valid scientific references (Section 3.2.2.7) ensures
data quality and transparency (accuracy).
3.4 Research Using DrugBank
Asthe pace of data and studies being released continuesto grow at a breakneck rate,
researchers are struggling with time-consuming work and an increasingly compet￾itive environment. In order to stay ahead of the competition, many are turning to
DrugBank for reliable, high-quality data.
Recently, a large team of researchers from Wuhan, Beijing, and Shenzhen
developed a virtual screening tool using DrugBank’s database to help accelerate the
drug discovery process relating to COVID-19 [32]. The team used DrugBank to filter
out FDA-approved drugs as well as stage 3 clinical trial drugs. Several active sites
of viral proteins were then chosen to use as ligand targets for a screening process.
Compounds with high binding affinities to these viral proteins were identified
through in silico molecular docking experiments. The results included a number
of drugs that were already being studied as treatments for COVID-19, but also
identified a number of new possible candidates. The list included drugs that are
used to treat HIV, HCV, cancer, and asthma, as well as influenza virus antagonists.
Through in silico screening such as this, researchers can quickly identify candidate
treatments for emerging diseases such as COVID-19.
Turning to Sweden, a research team there has identified lead drug compounds
using DrugBank to screen against viral targets responsible for COVID-19 [33]. They
compiled lists of approved, investigational, and experimental drugsto screen against
four COVID-19 targets: 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro),
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the spike (S) protein. For this study,
structures of drugs identified as having high binding affinities were retrieved from
DrugBank and were computationally docked to these four protein targets. The
compounds were validated through a double-scoring approach using molecular
dynamics and a molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA)
strategy. They found drugs that were already under review in COVID-19 clinical
trials, confirming their methodology. To widen the pool of candidates, they also
screened for compounds that could potentially act on multiple targets. DrugBank
captures many different categorizations of drugs (such as approved, investigational,
and experimental; see Section 3.2.2.2) allowing the user to filter down to those most
important to their research. This is an optimal way to repurpose drugs given a vast
database and known targets; researchers can readily identify leading compounds to
accelerate the drug discovery process.3.5 Discussion and Conclusions 95
Another instance where DrugBank helped to speedup drug repurposing strate￾giesinvolved gene networking and bioinformatic analysis. Researchersfrom Taiwan
and Indonesia uncovered potential treatmentsfor atopic dermatitis(AD) by integrat￾ing genetic and drug information using open data sources [34]. They gathered and
mapped drug target genes to DrugBank and used parameters to filter out potential
candidates based on pharmacological activity, approval status, as well as the pres￾ence of clinical and experimental drugs. After running the data, the results showed
dupilumab as an effective treatment for AD. As dupilumab is already approved for
thisindication, this finding provided evidence forthe accuracy of their methodology.
The researchersfound 10 more potential candidatesthat had preclinical and clinical
trial evidence linking them through genetic interactions with AD.
Another important step in discovery and repurposing studies is the experimental
validation of predicted drugs, however, it is not always performed due to resource
constraints or a variety of otherfactors. In one illustrative example,researchersfrom
Argentina trained 1000 linear classifiers on random subsets of independent vari￾ables (molecular descriptors) to discriminate between known active and inactive
inhibitors of the Plasmodium falciparum protease falcipain-2 [35]. Ensemble learn￾ing was used to improve the predictive power over individual models, which was
subsequently applied to the DrugBank and SWEETLEAD [36] databases to identify
putative falcipain-2 inhibitors based on their positive predictive value (PPV). Of the
157 hits, four were tested for in vitro activity against purified falcipain-2. Methacy￾cline, a tetracycline antibiotic, and odanacatib, an abandoned cathepsin K inhibitor
investigated for use in osteoporosis, both inhibited the ability of falcipain-2 to cleave
the peptidic substrate Z-LR-AMC and inhibited P. falciparum growth in culture.
Interestingly, only odanacatib was able to inhibit proteolysis of the physiological
substrate hemoglobin, highlighting the nuance of drug MoA vs. therapeutic effect.
As highlighted in this section, the accessibility of DrugBank’s extensive database
can offer different solutions to accelerate the drug discovery pipeline. Researchers
are able to use it for in silico research by identifying potential drug candidates as
well as for repurposing molecules. Our vast range of interconnected information
creates an ideal environment for streamlined drug discovery and continues to be
a strong resource for researchers to use and validate drug prediction strategies.
These examples represent just a few use cases, where DrugBank provided reli￾able data to help find treatments for a particular disease, some of which can be
emerging.
3.5 Discussion and Conclusions
The increasing importance of in silico methodology across healthcare, and specif￾ically within the domain of drug discovery, has the potential to revolutionize the
manner in which we deliver care. To fully realize these benefits it is necessary to
have complete, well-structured, and accurate data.In this chapter, we have discussed
the DrugBank database, highlighting several key datasets, providing workflows to
accomplish common tasks, and discussed several research studies that demonstrate
the value of this data.96 3 DrugBank Online: A How-to Guide
The datasets discussed herein represent useful resources for drug discovery work,
but do not represent an exhaustive set of those within DrugBank. Clinical trial data,
as an example, can be used effectively to interrogate drug repurposing opportunities
and identify underserved areas within the scope of druggable targets. Though these
data are available as part of DrugBank Online (Table 3.1), expansion of this dataset
and the construction of tools to assist with its interrogation are current focus areas
for improvement. Similarly, although the pharmacology (and specifically pharma￾cokinetic) information provided in drug cards (see Section 3.2.2.3), is exceptionally
detailed, it is largely in the form of unstructured text. Future efforts to create struc￾tured entries from this dataset may assist in the use of these parameters as input to
various algorithms and ML models.
As mentioned in the introduction section, drug target identification is often
conducted through the use of genetic associations, or is strengthened by such
findings [37]. In general, the integration of genetic information in clinical diag￾nosis and care, though challenging, remains a source of great interest [38, 39].
The association of genomic changes with an alteration in the safety, efficacy, or
other properties of a drug with respect to the individual is usually referred to as
pharmacogenomics/pharmacogenetics (PGx) [40]. Although the utility of PGx data
in a clinical setting has been demonstrated, the exploration of its use in other fields,
such as drug discovery [41], remains to be fully evaluated. In keeping with this
exciting potential, DrugBank will be investing in expanding our PGx dataset to
empower new discoveries in the area of genomic medicine (see Section 3.2.2.3).
The importance of evolutionary context in drug discovery is largely limited to the
use of homology searching and phylogenetic methodsto ensure orthologues of puta￾tive targets are present within an animal model of choice [42]. With the recent break￾through in in silico protein structural prediction [43, 44], increasing power of in silico
structural analysis methods, and a firm emphasis on validated drug–target interac￾tions, it is likely that this conversation will expand from a purely sequence-focused
view to include important structural elements. Assisting users with analytic work￾flows centered around sequence and structural homology represents a fascinating
possibility for future work.
Critically, though there are numerous avenues currently under development to
expand DrugBank’s offering, our existing data and infrastructure already represent
an invaluable resource for the drug discovery community. Although commercial
licensing is available, we provide many important datasets for drug discovery free
of charge; by making these data freely available to researchers, we aim to empower
health informatics research and democratize the research process such that an indi￾vidual’s ability to discover novel insights is not tied to resourcing. Future efforts to
expand on these data and tools will continue this motivation, and ensure the con￾tinued success of health informatics research.

4.1 Introduction
4.1.1 Concept of Isosterism and Bioisosterism
Isosterism is one of the oldest and most established conceptsin medicinal chemistry
but is also a trusted, powerful, and efficient practice to foster successful drug discov￾ery to this day. The history of bioisosterism is long, and detailed presentations can
be found in the book of the same series dedicated to the subject [1] and in other
substantial reviews [2–4].
However, here is a swift journey of milestones and definitions around the
important notions. Origins are certainly to be found in 1919 with the work of
Irving Langmuir [5], who studied the similarities of various properties between
atoms, groups, radicals, and molecules. The “isosteres” were strictly defined as
chemical entities that have the same number of atoms and arrangement of elec￾trons. This definition was then broadened in 1925 by applying Grimm’s “Hydride
Displacement Law” and the pseudoatom notion. In the 1930s, the experiments
of Erlenmeyer brought crucial inputs by (i) relaxing the isosteric classification to
chemical entities sharing identical peripheral layers of electrons and thus including
those having different numbers of atoms and (ii) relating isosterism to biology
through experiments showing antigens bearing isosteric fragments binding equally
to antibodies [6].
The term “bioisostere” appeared in 1951 and is attributed to Friedmann, who
pioneered very important aspects for future application in drug research [7]. In
particular, he emphasized that bioisosteric chemical entities must show similar
biological activity and comply with the broadest definition of isosteres. In other
words, isosteres are not necessarily bioisosteres if they do not share the same
bioactivity. Reversely, bioisosteres are not always isosteres if restricted to the strict

classical definition. Later definitions are going even further in practical sense, such
as the one of Thornber, who defined a form of non-classical isosterism characterized
by chemical and physical similarity and roughly similar biological effects [8].
4.1.2 Classical vs. Non-classical Bioisostere and Further Molecular
Replacements
The most recent definitions of bioisosterism relate to drug discovery in a pragmatic
sense, with the idea that all depend on the biological and chemical contexts of the
field explored. Regarding biological context, the same pair of similar compounds
can display comparable pharmacological properties on a given protein target or
assay while showing divergent bioactivities on othertargets orin other experimental
setups.
In addition, the effect produced by exchanging a molecularfragment in a molecule
is very dependent on the chemical context. For instance, replacing a methyl group
with a halogen atom can have different impacts on molecular and physicochemical
properties if it takes place as an aromatic substitution or at the end of a long alkyl
chain.
Echoing such ordinary problems of daily medicinal chemistry routine, experts in
the field have clearly softened the criteria for alikenessin terms of both biological and
chemical contexts. Among the refined vocabulary employed, the distinction between
classical and non-classical bioisosteres is noteworthy.
As the name suggests, classical bioisosteres come from the initial definitions
of isosterism focusing on strict comparison at the atomic and electronic levels.
Atoms or groups are typically classified as monovalent, divalent, or trivalent
bioisosteres. Medicinal chemists apply such classical bioisosteric replacements
routinely. Typically, this definition applies, for example, between fluorine and
hydrogen; amino and hydroxyl; thiol and hydroxyl; hydroxyl, amino, and methyl
groups (comply with Grimm’s Hydride Displacement Law); chloro, bromo, thiol,
and hydroxyl groups (relaxed criteria according to Erlenmeyer) [3]. Some modest
extensions of the concept can reasonably be seen as classical bioisosteres like
tetrasubstituted atoms (tetravalent carbon, tetrasubstituted silane, ammonium
exchanges) or very similar ring replacements (e.g. pyridine for phenyl).
Further extensions of the concept enter the territory of non-classical bioisosteres,
which can differ in molecular structures and properties, for instance in terms of
the number of atoms, or steric or electronic considerations. Well-known examples
include the replacement of carboxylic acid by tetrazole, as successfully applied for
designing nonpeptide oral angiotensin receptor antagonists and resulting in the anti￾hypertensive drug Losartan (Figure 4.1a). In general, the tetrazole moiety shows an
acidity similar to carboxylic acid while improving other properties important for a
drug [13, 14]. In this biological and chemical context, the bioisosteric exchange also
produced stronger in vitro and in vivo activities due to better pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics [9].
Although less strict than classical bioisoteres, such non-classical bioisosteric trans￾formations still aim at mimicking some properties of a molecular fragment to be4.1 Introduction 103

replaced, even by a different means than sticking to an identical number of atoms
and electrons.
Conceptually, it is possible to go even further and apply molecular replace￾ments of fragments without necessarily trying to mimic any property a priori.
The objective of retaining bioactivity is perforce linked to molecular recognition
at the target, and hence, any modification of small molecule ligand should be
meant not to alter the position in space of chemical features essential for the
recognition, a.k.a. the pharmacophore. Keeping the pharmacophoric points at
the correct location can be achieved by more subtle and sophisticated means
than exchanges of similar moieties as described previously. For instance, taking
advantage of intramolecular interactions to mimic a ring with a noncyclic moiety104 4 Bioisosteric Replacement for Drug Discovery Supported by the SwissBioisostere Database
is exemplified by the internal hydrogen bonds in amlodipine [10] or sildenafil
[11] (Figure 4.1b, c, respectively). The reverse, i.e. cyclization, is also a valid
strategy, as described in a recent paper detailing the rational design of inhibitors
of TRAF2 and NCK-interacting protein kinase (TNIK) [12]. Different fused ring
systems were evaluated as bioisostere of o-methoxybenzamide that can form an
internal hydrogen bond between the methoxy oxygen and the amide nitrogen. The
tetrahydro-1,4-benzoxazepin-5-one was selected as a replacement, improving both
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles (see Figure 4.1d).
Furthermore, not all regions of druglike compounds are part of a pharmacophore.
Some chemical groups are not making specific intermolecular interaction or even
not making any interaction at all with the targeted macromolecule. As an example,
physicochemical properties of kinase inhibitors were optimized by modifying a
long side chain attached by an ether to an aminoquinazoline core [15]. While the
latter is known nowadays as a typical scaffold making specifically interactions
with the hinge domain of kinases, the side chain is not part of the pharmacophore
stricto sensu and was used to modulate physicochemical properties while keeping
bioactivity. Terminal polar heterocycles were particularly effective in increasing
the solubility of the inhibitors. Morpholine was finally selected for the molecule,
which was ultimately developed as Gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor and first-line
therapy to treat non-small cell lung carcinoma. Resolved structures of Gefitinib
cocrystallized with different kinases have confirmed the position of morpholine
in the solvent (Figure 4.2, e.g. Gefitinib bound to an EGFR mutant, PDB entry:
Figure 4.2 Crystallized complex of EGFR with inhibitor Gefitinib. Screenshot of Mol*
Viewer [16] as embedded on Protein Data Bank in Europe portal (PDB ID: 2ITO, https://www
.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/). EGFR is displayed as mauve cartoon and Gefitinib ligand in ball-and-stick
with carbon atoms in grey. The orange arrow points to the morpholine in the solvent.4.1 Introduction 105
2ITO). Grippingly, morpholine is the second most queried fragment inputted by
SwissBioisostere users (refer to Section 4.4.2).
Regardless of the medicinal chemistry strategy followed (if any), the fact remains
that replacing one part of a molecule only, while keeping the rest unchanged
generates a couple of compounds. In case of similar biological activity, we consider
the compounds as bioisosteres and the exchange of fragments as a bioisosteric
replacement.
To support medicinal chemists in choosing effective bioisosteric replacements,
this very pragmatic generalization of the concept stresses the need for tools not
limited to molecular or physicochemical descriptions but based on bioactivity
knowledge. Nowadays, the wealth of bioactivity data is sufficient, both in qual￾ity and quantity, to enable such knowledge-based tools. The SwissBioisostere
database and its web interface are the examples we want to describe in this chapter.
4.1.3 Bioisosteric Replacement in Drug Discovery
Drug discovery can be defined as all the strategies and techniques aimed at finding
small molecules active on a defined biological target (i.e. hit compounds), select￾ing leads with most appropriate properties for chemical modifications enabling
optimization, and ultimately promoting the drug candidates with the best chance
of success into the development phases. It is a long and costly workflow involving
trial-and-error paths and empirical feedback loops – in fact, much more complex
than the idealized scheme often presented. For decades, substantial efforts have
been put to lower the attrition rate and accelerate the generation of hypotheses,
knowledge, or evidences to support decisions and finally to reduce the risks
associated with the even more time-consuming and expensive drug development
phases.
Such decision-making support can be successfully achieved by a bioisosteric
replacement strategy, routinely followed by medicinal chemists. The approach
consists in defining and applying the chemical modifications that improve one or
severalsub-optimal properties while keeping the bioactivity at least at the same level
[17]. Drug discovery is highly multi-objective, hence the large variety of properties
to be potentially corrected: toxicity or lack of specificity for the target, synthesis
or intellectual property issues, improper Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism,
and Excretion (ADME) or pharmacokinetic profiles, to name the most obvious
ones [18].
In this section, we propose to describe and exemplify bioisosterism practices
applied to hit finding and lead optimization.
When a pharmacologically relevant target has been selected, chemical entities
showing activity must be identified with procedures grouped under the term hit
finding. In usual workflows, high-throughput screening as well as literature and
patent analysis are the primary sources for hits. The most promising hits have to
be clearly detected, unambiguously defined chemically, biochemically validated
in diverse assays, and further evaluated as suitable or not for promotion as lead
compounds. These activities are of utmost importance to promote the best possible106 4 Bioisosteric Replacement for Drug Discovery Supported by the SwissBioisostere Database
start of demanding medicinal chemistry programs. During hit finding, experts must
obviously addresstechnical points,such assynthetic accessibility of a given scaffold,
for instance, but also, more broadly, questions regarding the freedom to operate.
Intellectual property to avoid conflict with already protected fields is critical.
The objective is to escape a given chemotype to overcome the specific issues of a
given chemical series. Consequently, one can expect the chemical space to be vast
and distant from the first molecular hits. An efficient approach to explore new areas
of this broad space consists in exchanging the whole central core of a hit compound
but keeping the pharmacophoric points at the periphery of the molecule to retain
bioactivity [19]. In this methodology conceptualized and called scaffold hopping by
Gisbert Schneider[20], bioisosteric replacements concern “linker” or “scaffold” frag￾ments, including multiple connection pointsto the constant part of bioisostere com￾pounds (for technical aspects, see Section 4.2.3 and Figure 4.4).
Upon successful completion of all the hit-related processes described above, the
chemical entities are termed “lead compounds” and enter optimization, for which
bioisosteric replacements are also routinely and efficiently conducted. During lead
optimization, a validated chemotype issubject to numerous modeststructural modi￾fications [21]. The exploration of the chemical space allows to consider the relation￾ship between the structure and the properties that need to be optimized to design
a drug candidate. Compared to the hit-finding step, the exploration of the space
remains within the vicinity of the lead compound. Structural modifications are prin￾cipally made at the periphery of the molecules, such as at the end of a chain or
at a substituent position. The bioisosteric replacement is mainly applied on “side
chains,” with exchanged fragments having a single connection point with the rest of
the molecule (for technical aspects, see Section 4.2.3, and Figure 4.4).
The motivation for proposing SwissBioisostere and the way it has been designed
was to meet the needs of medicinal chemists’ practice. This is exposed in detail in
Section 4.2.
4.2 Construction and Dissemination of SwissBioisostere
4.2.1 Intention and Requirements
As introduced in Section 4.1, bioisosterism is routinely used for drug discovery.
This intuitive approach cannot follow a generalized logical path since it depends
on the biological and chemical contexts of the explored domain. There are neither
universally applicable rules nor guidelines to support the important and daily
task of replacing parts of a template molecule with new chemical moieties. Often,
the practice of bioisosteric replacement relies solely on the expertise of medicinal
chemists.
The likelihood of success of bioisosteric replacement approaches increases when
applied in a systematic and rational manner [2, 3]. Medicinal chemists can benefit
from computationalsupport for bioisosteric drug design. However, the usefulness of
such tools depends on some requirements. First, the bioisosteric knowledge should4.2 Construction and Dissemination of SwissBioisostere 107
Figure 4.3 Construction of the SwissBioisostere database and web interface.
be primarily rooted in bioactivity data linked to the structure of compounds and
processed with an unbiased technique, without considering other molecular param￾eters like physicochemical properties, for instance (refer to Section 4.2.3). Second,
the bioactivity data itself should be of high quality and broad in terms of chemical
and biological spaces (refer to Section 4.2.2).
The physicochemical and molecular descriptors are not included in the definition
of molecular replacements, but, reversely, they are of great importance for the users
to estimate the impact of these replacements on such properties. This, together with
the difference in bioactivity, should be organized for easy access to enable a global
assessment of the consequences ofselected molecularreplacements(referto Section
4.2.4 and Section 2.5).
The general workflow for the construction of SwissBioisostere is displayed in
Figure 4.3.
4.2.2 Bioactivity Data
The major data source for building SwissBioisostere is ChEMBL (https://www
.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/), a manually curated high-quality bioactivity database relying
mainly on medicinal chemistry literature and secondarily other sources, like
publicly available screening campaigns [22, 23]. It provides the possibility to
download the entire database in different formats. This allows to efficiently link
the chemical context (molecular structure and descriptors) and the biological
context (bioactivity, target, and target class) to assays and publications, for a large
set of bioactive compounds. For the needs of SwissBioisostere, ChEMBL data were
filtered to keep only small molecules (molecular weight <800 g/mol), active in vitro108 4 Bioisosteric Replacement for Drug Discovery Supported by the SwissBioisostere Database
(IC50, EC50, Ki
, or Kd <10 μM) in a binding or functional assay on a defined protein
target with enough curation confidence (score >7). This dataset is first organized
by classifying compounds tested on the same target in the same assay.
4.2.3 Nonsupervised Matched Molecular Pair Analysis
The bioactivity dataset organized by assay, obtained as described in Section 4.2.2,
is processed by a Matched Molecular Pair (MMP) algorithm. Such intuitive,
easy-to-use approach, proposed more than 40 years ago, heavily developed and
diversified [24], has demonstrated its value for analyzing public chemical databases
and especially in finding bioisostere molecules [25] by individualizing pairs of com￾pounds that differ by a single structural fragment. For building SwissBioisostere
and defining truly unclassical bioisosteres, a single structural change is related to
variation in bioactivity and only to this property, without any bias of any kind.
One well-known example of such unbiased, unsupervised MMP [26] is the
fragment-based method described by Hussain and Rea [27]. We employed a
custom-made implementation of this algorithm, in particular by defining addi￾tional fragmentation rules (for details, please refer to [28]). In brief, the algorithm
cuts molecules tested in the same experimental assay into fragments with respect
to their bond types. Only single bonds may be cut if linking at least one carbon, no
hydrogen, and not being part of any cycle, chemical function, or simple sugar pat￾tern (e.g. glucose or fructose). To generate fragments, no more than three bonds can
be cut at the same time. As such, three kinds of fragments are considered: side chain
fragments with one attachment point; linker fragments with two attachment points;
and scaffold fragments with three attachment points (Figure 4.4a). All remaining
(one, two, or three) moieties are tagged “R-groups” and correspond to the constant
part of the molecule (Figure 4.4b). This allows finally to define an occurrence as two
molecules tested on the same assay (and thus on the same target) differing only by
one fragmental exchange with the rest of the structure constant (R-groups). This
fragmental exchange is defined as the replacement (Figure 4.3).
4.2.4 Database
The MMP analysis on bioactivity data as described above enables the user to find
possible bioisosteric replacements, for instance, if the majority of occurrences (pairs
of molecules) for a given replacement are showing similar bioactivity when tested
in the same assay. The analysis can be further refined thanks to attached data, such
as physicochemical properties, or biological and chemical contexts not employed to
guide the MMP but important for design actions to be applied in lead optimization
or hit finding. A relational database was built using MySQL (https://www.mysql
.com) with the aim of structuring the extensive wealth of knowledge and making
it straightforwardly searchable through a large variety of languages, including
web-oriented programs. As an example, the main and largest table contains more
than 65 million data points, corresponding to all replacement occurrences. These
base data are linked to all additional knowledge, like molecular and physicochemical
properties or target classes, through several other interconnected tables.4.2 Construction and Dissemination of SwissBioisostere 109

allows (b) to define matched fragments (here replacements of linkers boxed in red) among
pairs of molecules tested on the same target in the same assay (here, two occurrences for
the same replacement from two different assays); all remaining (one, two, or three)
chemical moieties correspond to the constant part of the molecule (blue dashed boxes).
4.2.5 Web Interface
The SwissBioisostere database is openly accessible on the Web, freely browsable
and searchable by reaching www.swissbioisostere.ch. This login-free website has
been online since 2012 [29] and has undergone a major update (both frontend and
backend) in 2021 [28]. Users can perform their own requests and analyses within
the graphical web interface; they can also export results, access to related ChEMBL
and PubMed entries, and interoperate with other CADD web tools. Use cases and
examples are given in Section 4.4.3. Please refer to the reference [28] for the details
on how to take full advantage of all capabilities.
Importantly, like for our CADD web tools, the results generated by Swiss￾Bioisostere are under CC-BY license. This extends the freedom to operate, including
for commercial and for-profit usages. The current website is optimized for Firefox
(www.mozilla.org) or Google Chrome (www.google.com/chrome/). The best user
experience is obtained by using a recent version of either browser.
Detailed support to the user on all options regarding input, output, visualization,
analysis, filtering, export, access to databases of origin, and interoperability with
other CADD toolsis obtained directly on the website through the main menu. Apart
from frequently asked questions(FAQ), the items “Tutorials” and “Help” give access110 4 Bioisosteric Replacement for Drug Discovery Supported by the SwissBioisostere Database

to video tutorials and static help pages (see Figure 4.5). Particularly useful are the
short screen capture videos of about 1 to 2 minutes, which cover comprehensively
the most technical aspects of the graphical interface. As of today, the tutorials show
how to: (i) input a side chain fragment; (ii) analyze results of possible replace￾ments of a fragment; (iii) analyze results of specific replacement occurrences;
(iv) input linker and scaffold fragments; and (v) input a specific replacement.

environment interoperability: (vi) send any compound from SwissBioisostere to
other SwissDrugDesign tools in order to perform additional analyses (vii) send any
molecule from another SwissDrugDesign tool to SwissBioisostere. The static help
page acts as a checklist summarizing the input/output requirements and available
options. If a user has other concerns or a specific question, a contact form is also
provided.
The following few basic points are noteworthy. Users can input molecular
fragments directly from the input page using either one or both molecular sketch￾ers. Two types ofrequests are available: (option 1)requestsfor possible replacements
of a molecular fragment with input in the left-hand sketchers; (option 2) requests
for occurrences of a specific replacement with input in both left- and right-hand
sketchers. Request options and display/undisplay of the right-hand sketcher are
available by clicking on the corresponding grey tabs above sketchers. When a query
of possible replacements (request type 1, see Figure 4.10a) is completed, results
are returned in a new browser tab as a first output page containing the list of
candidate fragments sorted by default according to the difference of bioactivity (see
Figure 4.10b). If the user clicks on a given candidate fragment, a second request is
performed for occurrences of the specific replacement. Upon completion, a new
browser tab displays a second output page, listing all occurrences for the specific
replacement (i.e. all pairs of molecules differing by this replacement and tested
in the same assay, see Figure 4.10c). As mentioned before, such a request for
occurrences can also be performed directly from the input page with an input in
both sketchers (request type 2).
4.3 Content of SwissBioisostere
4.3.1 Global Content
At the time of writing this chapter (early 2022), the chemoinformatic pipeline
described in Section 4.2 was applied to data extracted and filtered from ChEMBL
version 28 to analyze a total of 1,124,168 datapoints representing 483,927 com￾pounds tested for bioactivity on 2036 protein targets of 35 classes through 61,199
assays. The workflow that generated the database behind the production website
www.swissbioisostere.ch was able to describe 25,305,017 unique replacements,
implying 1,216,118 unique fragments [28]. Overall, the browsable replacement
space of SwissBioisostere is as vast as 65 million datapoints, of which more than
36 million are directly linked to a publication and straightforwardly accessible
in one click through a PubMed link (see Figures 4.10 and 4.11). The rest of the
replacement information originates from assays not published but curated by
ChEMBL, as well. Most are part of large high-throughput screening (HTS) public
campaigns, targeting neglected diseases or COVID-19, for instance. It is important
to understand that addition of new data in SwissBioisostere depends on ChEMBL
releases and SwissBioisostere updates. As such, SwissBioisostere must be seen as a
CADD tool to support drug discovery and certainly not as a means to track the very
latest communications in medicinal chemistry.112 4 Bioisosteric Replacement for Drug Discovery Supported by the SwissBioisostere Database
4.3.2 Biological and Chemical Contexts
An important asset of SwissBioisostere is to support the user by providing both
the biological and chemical contexts for the replacements under investigation.
The underlying idea is that if a replacement has already been successfully applied
to many similar molecules active on the same target or on similar targets from the
same class, confidence in the bioisosteric nature of the replacement is higher.
The number of unique fragments and of unique replacements broken down by
the target classes are shown in Figure 4.6. Please note that the replacements are
more numerous than the fragments because a given fragment can be replaced by
several ones. The most populated target classes are by far the G-protein coupled
receptors, especially the GPCR of family A, with 6,400,517 replacements involving
385,018 fragments; the kinases with 6,960,300 replacements involving 237,918

(b)
Figure 4.6 A picture of the biological space described by SwissBioisostere. Distribution of
unique fragments (a) and unique replacements (b) as a function of the 35 target classes.4.3 Content of SwissBioisostere 113
fragments; and the proteases with 3’503’920 replacements involving 250,152
fragments. This appears intuitively to be a true picture of the recent history of
medicinal chemistry. Obviously, the likelihood of finding relevant and accurate
information on molecular replacements is particularly high among the massive
data accumulated on these extensively studied drug targets. However, a strength of
SwissBioisostere is that it also contains data on much less popular niches with the
same level of confidence. Finding validated examples of bioisosteric small molecules
active on target classes like, for instance, surface antigens or transcription factors
can impact very positively speculative early-phase drug discovery projects. This is
even more true if the chemical context of the molecular replacement is similar.
For the chemical context, the output pages of the SwissBioisostere web interface
provide analyses and selection tools to estimate which replacements are most rele￾vant for specific needs. As described in Figure 4.12, the user can interactively select
the physicochemical space of interest or refine the chemical context as properties of
the attachment points.
As quantified in detail in Section 4.4.3.4.1, aromatic groups have a tremendous
influence on organic chemistry and in particular on medicinal chemistry [37].
This trend is clearly observable in Figure 4.7a, where it can be seen that about 75%
of all fragments in SwissBioisostere contain at least one aromatic ring. The rest
excludes any aromatic moieties, with 14% involving nonaromatic cycles and 11%
being linear moieties. Similarly, the relative proportion of side chains decreases
according to the order: aromatic, nonaromatic cycles, and linear fragments. Both
the scaffolds and the linkers follow the reverse trend.
Moreover, when looking at the composition of fragments, one can appreciate that
only 0.7% are purely carbon moieties, whereas more than 76% contain heteroatoms,
excluding halogens (Figure 4.7b). This is an important wealth of information for
efficient drug design, both allowing optimization of physicochemical and phar￾macokinetic properties of the desired compounds (please refer to Section 4.4.3.3)
as well as exploration of pharmacophores for better molecular recognition by the
targeted binding sites. The proportion of fragments containing at least one halogen
atom, more than 22%, is also significant and reflects the importance of these ele￾ments in medicinal chemistry. Indeed, many halogenated molecules have reached
the clinical phases and the market as a result of a long-time strategy to exploit
the special nature of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and to a lower extent, iodine
[38]. While originally used primarily to optimize physicochemistry and stabilize
metabolism, halogen atoms are nowadays known for their subtle but very specific
intermolecular interactions, which enable refined strategies for structure-based
design [39].
4.3.3 Fragment Shape Diversity
Closely related to aromaticity and molecular “flatness,” it has been observed that
increasing the tridimensional nature of the molecules improves the chance of drug
candidatesto successfully progressthrough development phases[37]. Besides, it has
long been shown that molecular shape is strongly associated with bioactivity and114 4 Bioisosteric Replacement for Drug Discovery Supported by the SwissBioisostere Database

that diversity in shape will increase the ability of chemical collections to address
multiple protein targets in HTS [40]. We analyzed the content of SwissBioisostere
using the method based on normalized ratios of principal moments of inertia (NPR)
developed by Sauer and Schwartz [41]. It allows visualization of distinct shapes in
a triangular space defined by the two principal components, as on the scheme in
Figure 4.8a, where purely rod-shaped molecules are at the top left corner, the purely
spherical molecules are at the top right corner and the purely disc-shaped molecules
are at the bottom corner. Classification as “rod,” “sphere,” or “disc” is possible when
dividing geometrically the triangular space into three zones of equal surface defined
by connecting the three midpoints of each side to the geometric center of the triangle,
as depicted in Figure 4.8b. The same picture shows the result of the NPR analysis of
1.2 million fragments included in SwissBioisostere, spread over the space, with the
majority of them being rods, then discs. Essentially spherical fragments are much
rarer.
Remarkably, the global molecular shape distribution for fragments is very compa￾rable to that of full small molecules. The reader may refer to the respective articles
for the NPR analysis of bioactive compound collections (e.g. MDDR or GOLD-set
[41]) or of vendor catalogs recorded in the ZINC database [42].
The NPR analysisstratified by side chains, linkers, and scaffolds(Figure 4.8c) indi￾cates small differences in the shape repartition, among which the most significant is
certainly the overrepresentation of rod-like shaped side chains compared to linkers
and scaffolds.
Overall, as seen in Figure 4.8d, the fragments queried by users via the Swiss￾Bioisostere Web interface follow a very similar trend, demonstrating a good match
between user demands and the content of our knowledgebase.
Using the triangle space divided into three zones allowed to inspect the replace￾ments as switching between or staying in the same shape class. Interestingly,
whereas the “sphere” fragments are less numerous in SwissBioisostere, the replace￾ments involving spherical moieties (either staying in the same class or moving
from/to “rod” or “disc”) are overrepresented (data not shown). This might indicate
that medicinal chemistry habits have included the importance of synthesizing and
assaying more tridimensional compounds.
4.4 Usage of SwissBioisostere
4.4.1 Website Usage
In 2021, SwissBioisostere received about 11,200 unique users,showing an increase of
35% since 2020 and 79% since 2019. These users, who came from 163 different coun￾tries, opened 18,500 web sessions (+42% since 2020 and +87% since 2019) totalizing

4.4.2 Most Frequent Requests
The requests of users through the web interface were briefly discussed in
Section 4.3.3, to indicate the match with the content of the database. In addition,
we analyzed the most frequent users’ inputs on the website. In Figure 4.9, the most
frequent fragments when searching for all possible replacements of a molecular
fragment are represented (option 1 in Section 2.5). Strikingly, all fragments are
side chains (with only one attachment point), except the amide linker (with two
attachment points) ranked #7. While this chemical group is massively studied [43],
the fact that it is one of the examples provided in the input page of SwissBioisostere
probably artificially increases the number of submissions. Intuitively, all other
fragments most frequently queried for replacement make total sense. These moi￾eties are very common in druglike molecules (e.g. pyridine and phenyl), represent
well-known medicinal chemistry options to fine-tune a property (e.g. morpholine
to increase solubility, refer to Figure 4.2), or belong to a group of problematic
fragments (e.g. nitro substituents toxified by metabolism).
4.4.3 Examples Related to Drug Discovery
4.4.3.1 Use Cases
Several cases of typical search and analysis with SwissBioisostere are provided
in the methodological article [28] describing the database and the interface, in
particular, hit-finding examples, carboxylic acid bioisosteres, and amide bioisosteres
thorough investigations. Whereas replacements and occurrences are numerous for
side chains and linkers, less data regards fragments with three attachment points.
By scanning the literature, it becomes clear that the three-attachment moiety
exchanges, certainly more synthetically complicated, are less frequently attempted
and that scaffold hopping is often limited to modification of linkers. Consequently,
only 16.7% of SwissBioisostere data involve scaffolds [28]. Nevertheless, remarkable
information about scaffolds is just a few clicks away. We can take the example of
the small molecule drug that generated the biggest revenue in 2021, Apixaban, an
inhibitor of factor Xa administered as anticoagulant (Figure 4.10a). Searching in
SwissBioisostere for replacements of its pyrazolopyridinone central core, four pos￾sible scaffold fragments relying on six datapoints of pairs of molecules can be found
(user can perform this request through the scaffold example found at the bottom
of the submission page, see Figure 4.10b). All compounds were experimentally
evaluated on coagulation factor X and published in two research articles [30, 44],
Figure 4.9 Most frequent
fragments inputted by users
on www.swissbioisostere.ch.118 4 Bioisosteric Replacement for Drug Discovery Supported by the SwissBioisostere Database
which describe the medicinal chemistry milestones leading to the discovery and
optimization of what will become a blockbuster medicine. Figure 4.10b shows the
submission web page of the SwissBiosisostere interface (including links to input
examples). Upon request completion, all possible candidate fragments to replace
the inputted moiety are provided in a tabular fashion in a first result page, together
with analysis, filtering, and export options (Figure 4.10c). Clicking on the chemical
structure of a fragment makes another tab open in the web browser to display all
occurrences of molecule pairs (Figure 4.10d). This page enables further analyses,
including compound and assay descriptions, by accessing directly related entries
in ChEMBL [22] as well as the publication of origin (if any) through PubMed
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Importantly, interoperability icons (below all
molecules) allow to submit any molecule to other CADD web tools developed by us
at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. In one click, SwissBioisostere users can
execute ligand-based virtual screening through SwissSimilarity [31], estimate the
most probable protein targets with SwissTargetPrediction [45], evaluate physico￾chemical, pharmacokinetic, and other related parameters with SwissADME [33], or
submit as another SwissBioisostere query. Conversely, any molecule generated by
these tools can be submitted equally to SwissBioisostere [46]. Simple web searches
of chemical knowledge bases such as SwissBioisostere can not only provide
global pictures and figures on decades of drug discovery but also allow to observe
significant focused successful moves in the history of medicinal chemistry.
A recent article describes the successful usage of SwissBioisostere to design
inhibitors of the NorA efflux pump, a protein responsible for antibiotic resistance
in Staphylococcus aureus [34]. The study started with a known inhibitory boronic
chemotype as a template. The bioisosteric strategy was conducted to generate
more druglike, equipotent inhibitors. Among the 77 candidate fragments to replace
boronic acid provided by SwissBioisostere, 42 were selected to be further evaluated in
silico through molecular docking and ADME predictions. Finally, a nitro analog was
synthetized and evaluated in vitro. It exhibited improved bactericide potentializa￾tion of antibiotic ciprofloxacin by higher efflux inhibition. This result together with
reduced cytotoxicity on host cells, qualified 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropoxy)pyridine
as a lead compound for resistance breaker to resensitize S. aureus (Figure 4.11a).
This fruitful example confirmed that, although SwissBioisostere does not contain
many bioactivity data on antibiotics, because of some filtering criteria, the method
can be applied to other species targets such as for antibacterial drug discovery. This
extends to agrochemistry, as for instance reported in a recent article [35] describing
how SwissBioisostere supported efficiently heterocyclic replacements to further
optimize the biological properties of the insecticide tyclopyrazoflor (Figure 4.11b).
4.4.3.2 Replacing Unwanted Chemical Groups
The 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropoxy)pyridine lead compound described in Section

generate highly reactive nitrenium ions that bind nucleophilic macromolecules
covalently, ultimately resulting in mutagenicity and carcinogenicity [47]. Such
unwanted chemical groups are nowadays routinely either filtered out, for instance
using medicinal chemistry filters [48–50] at the hit-finding steps or exchanged by
other molecular fragments during lead optimization. Unwanted chemical groups
are not limited to toxic moieties but include unstable, reactive, promiscuous,
aggregator, or dye-related fragments or compounds with other properties known to
perturb experimental assays. In such context, bioisosteric strategies are instinctively
followed by medicinal chemists, who decide by which fragments the problematic
group must be exchanged for the best chance to keep bioactivity. SwissBioisostere,
as a knowledge-based tool, can efficiently support such endeavor. For example, by
querying the database for 5-nitro-2-substituted pyridine, the possibly toxic fragment
described above (SMILES: [O−][N+](=O)C1=CC=C([*])N=C1), 285 candidate
fragments for replacement are returned with a broad physicochemical spectrum
(Δlog P from −2.57 to +2.97; ΔtPSA from −56.03 to +43.14 Å2, refer to the graph
on Figure 4.12a). Interestingly, only four potential candidate fragments contain a
nitro group. Moreover, only 17 fragments are flagged with a Brenk structural alert
[48] and none are predicted as PAINS [50] by using SwissADME [33] with SMILES
obtained through the export of the SwissBioisostere table into a CSV file. The two
most frequent replacements are the nitrile and the trifluoromethyl pyridine analogs
with 24 and 18 occurrences, respectively. Those moieties show very different
impacts on physiochemical parameters but a clear majority of them lead to similar
or increased bioactivity (see color bars in Figure 4.12a, red for decreased, orange for
similar, and green for increased activity). This demonstrates how simple searches
can efficiently support bioisosteric design by proposing numerous, diverse, and
meaningful possible replacements.
Further analysis is provided by the occurrence pages opened in a new tab by
clicking on a fragment structure. For example, all 24 pairs of molecules for the first
replacements are in a pretty broad biological context with activities tested on 10(a) (b)

targets of 6 different classes, whereas the chemical context is limited to aliphatic
ring and linker attachment points (Figure 4.12b). The datapoint with the largest
increase in bioactivity refers to inhibitors of HIV proteases. In the research article
directly accessible through the PubMed link [36], both molecules belong to the
final series for optimization of the CF3 analog, further developed as Tipranavir, an
approved drug used in AIDS treatment.
4.4.3.3 Optimization of Passive Absorption and Blood–Brain Barrier Diffusion
Pharmacodynamics optimization aiming at increasing potency or selectivity at the
target often involves adding chemical groups to molecules, e.g. to make additional
specific intermolecular interactions or to open a side cavity of a binding site. This
typically generates larger, more lipophilic, and polar molecules. Such compounds
are in general not compatible with proper ADME, which is mandatory to achieve
sufficient bioavailability and for a bioactive molecule to reach its target, and finally
for the expected pharmacological event to occur. Several studies linked physico￾chemical properties with optimal ADME, for comprehensive reviews please refer to
[51, 52]. For example, the BOILED-Egg is a simple predictive classification model
for gastrointestinal absorption and central nervous system (CNS) distribution, two
important pharmacokinetic properties to control during the steps of discovery for
an oral drug [53]. Figure 4.13a schematizes the main steps of optimization from
a BCR–ABL kinase inhibitor lead to Ponatinib, an oral anticancer drug described
elsewhere by the discovery team [54]. Each chemical modification shows distinct
variations (dashed arrows) of both descriptors (WLOGP [55] and tPSA [56]).
The general trend is the typical decrease of both the lipophilicity and the apparent
polarity (semi-transparent arrow) to reach the inside of the “egg;” the “white” for
passive absorption and the “yolk” for permeation through the blood-brain barrier
(BBB). Lowering simultaneously the lipophilic and polar natures of a molecule is
not an obvious medical chemistry move, since lipophilicity and polarity are mostly
anti-correlated. This can however be obtained by removing non-pharmacophoric
regions of the molecule, like the terminal cyclopropylbenzene-1,4-diamine, crossed
in Figure 4.13b. Another strategy is to perform bioisosteric replacement by selecting
potential candidate fragments based on the desired properties, in our case lower
partition coefficient (log P) and reduced polar surface area (tPSA).
The distribution of more than 36,400,000 replacements (those of SwissBioisostere
linked with a PubMed ID) as a function of the corresponding variations of log P
(ΔWLOGP) and of polar surface area (ΔtPSA) is shown in Figure 4.13c. The most
populated regions of this heatmap are forreplacements producing small variations of
polarity and lipophilicity (central zone). Reversely, at the periphery of the heatmap,
the larger the variations of physicochemical properties, the fewer the replacements.
Moreover, the upper-left and lower-right quadrants are more populated than the
upper-right and the lower-left quadrants. This echoes the greater difficulty of vary￾ing log P and tPSA in the same direction than to select a fragment able to modify
lipophilicity and polarity in an opposite manner. In particular, the dash-lined circle
indicates grossly variations that are expected for bioisosteric replacements aiming at
increasing passive absorption and CNS penetration by lowering log P and tPSA at(a) (c)

interest (here ΔtPSA<0 and ΔWLOGP<0). This analysis pointed out only 11 fragments able to decrease lipophilicity and apparent polarity at the same
time, including Ponatinib dimethylpiperazine.124 4 Bioisosteric Replacement for Drug Discovery Supported by the SwissBioisostere Database
the same time. This zone is clearly less populated than its symmetric counterparts
in other quadrants. Of note, the discontinuities in the heatmap simply originate
from the fact that these properties are calculated using fragmental models, so that
values of log P and tPSA can only vary by a few possible discrete changes between
molecules.
The methylimidazole fragment in the lead compound (circled in blue in
Figure 4.13b) – which was ultimately exchanged by the dimethylpiperazine
in Ponatinib – can be linked to 644 possible replacing fragments in SwissBioisostere.
Among them, 223 fragments show lower tPSA values, and 148 show lower log P
values, but only 11 fragments decrease both lipophilicity and apparent polarity
simultaneously. These interesting replacements are easy to retrieve and analyze in
the interactive graph of SwissBioisostere web interface by selecting the region of
interest (as described in Figure 4.13d). The dimethylpiperazine moiety of Ponatinib
is included in this short list of 11 fragments, as well as 10 other ideas to guide
medicinal chemists in the optimization of ADME properties.
4.4.3.4 Reduction of Flexibility
Apart from being associated with a possible loss of entropy that can impact the
binding to the target, high molecular flexibility is also strongly linked to suboptimal
ADME. Different studies have associated flexible small molecules with reduced
bioavailability in rats, and demonstrated this by impaired biological or artificial
membrane permeation. Therefore, several drug likeness rules have been defined
with various upperlimits ofrotatable bonds[37, 57–59]. Consequently, a bioisosteric
replacement approach to reduce the number of such rotatable bonds constitutes
a valid strategy when addressing a flexible molecule with poor pharmacokinetic
profile. The 36,400,000 replacements of SwissBioisostere associated with a PubMed
ID were analyzed with this structural rigidification strategy in mind. Criteria
were defined as follows: a rigidification replacement is considered when (i) both
fragments have at least five bonds between heavy atoms and (ii) the decrease in
fraction of rotatable bonds is at least 75%.
With these purposely strict criteria, 3839 replacements found in SwissBioisostere
lead to severe rigidification. Strikingly all exchanges are cyclic, without exception
(Figures 4.14–4.16), testifying that cyclization isindeed an efficient bioisosteric strat￾egy when pointing to rigid molecules. 2229 such replacementsregard side chains. In
Figure 4.14a, the most frequently replaced flexible fragments are displayed,showing
that aliphatic side chains are primarily subject to rigidification. n-hexyl is overrep￾resented with 145 proposals of rigid/cyclic fragments. Of note, the replacements of
n-hexyl for more rigid fragments constitute only 8% of all the 1823 proposed replace￾ments of n-hexyl. Of all side chain rigidifying exchanges, the top three points to
n-hexyl to cyclohexyl, phenyl, or cyclopropyl, with 276, 266, and 104 pairs of example
molecules, respectively (Figure 4.14b). For those three proposed modifications of
n-hexyl, respectively, 216 (78%), 182 (68%), and 76 (73%) show higher or similar
bioactivity and can thus be considered as genuine bioisosteres. Figure 4.14c displays
the most frequent rigid replacements for n-hexyl and confirms the all-carbon nature(a)

of the cyclic fragment with the few exceptions ofsome halogen aromatic substituents
(p-chloro and p-fluorophenyl) and heteroaromatic rings (pyridine). Again, most of
those are validated bioisosteric fragments since keeping or increasing the biological
activity.
Similar conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the 1331 linker-rigidifying
exchanges.
1,6-hexyl isthe moiety mostsubject to rigid replacements(Figure 4.15a). However,
the rigidification of n-hexyl is much more frequently tackled when it is considered as
a linkerratherthan as a side chain,since the 128 proposed cyclic replacements of the
n-hexyl linker constitute 15% of all its replacements in SwissBioisostere. Also, look￾ing at the most frequent replacements for all linkers (Figure 4.15b), rigid fragments
are mainly aromatic. This is illustrated by the most frequent rigid moieties proposed
to replace 1,6-n-hexyl, which are different isomers of disubstituted phenyl or benzyl
(Figure 4.15c). For example, the most frequent replacement, 1,6-hexyl to 1,4-phenyl,
counts 46 pairs of compounds, of which 31 cases are linked with increased or simi￾lar bioactivity (67%). Again, such fragments provided by SwissBioisostere are useful
bioisosteric moieties.
For scaffolds, the most replaced fragments follow the same trend, i.e. flexible
aliphatic fragments are mainly exchanged by aromatic rings. However, the number
of flexible fragments with three attachment points is not sufficient to draw general
conclusions (refer to Figure 4.16a,b). Nevertheless, SwissBioisostere also provides
access to less frequent fragmental replacements that may reveal interesting and
useful bioisosteres. For example, in the course of the optimization of sulfonylalkyl￾hydroxamate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [60], the exchange of an
alkyl fragment by more complex rigid moieties, in particular 1-[(4-methoxyphenyl)
methyl]piperidine, was reported (see Figure 4.16c). The impact on bioactivity can
be easily retrieved in SwissBioisostere, which returns three occurrences consisting
of the same pair of bioisosteric potent inhibitors with an increased in vitro potency
on two matrix metalloproteinases and similar potency on the tumor necrosis
factor-alpha converting enzyme (ADAM-17) (Figure 4.16d).
4.4.3.5 Reduction of Aromaticity/Escape from Flatland
As shown in the previous section on rigidification, aromatic moieties are mas￾sively present in bioactive molecules and consequently in the SwissBioisostere
database. A major reason is the advances made in sp2 coupling chemistry and
related parallel synthesis schemes involving aromatic blocks [61]. However, as
suggested by Lovering et al. [37], this could reduce developability of discovery
molecules by impacting both pharmacodynamic aspects (e.g. less target selectiv￾ity) and physicochemical or pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. poor solubility or
permeability).
We analyzed the content of SwissBioisostere with the escape from flatland strategy
in mind, by focusing on replacements of aromatic fragments by nonaromatic rings.
The following criteria were applied to the 36,400,000 replacements associated with a
PubMed ID: a replacement reducing flatness is considered when (i) the decrease in
fraction of aromatic atomsis at least 75%; (ii) the increase in fraction of aliphatic ring4.4 Usage of SwissBioisostere 129
atomsis at least 75%; and (iii)the fraction of double bond in the replacing atom isless
than 10%. These strict criteria allowed to spot 9967 ring replacements with substan￾tially increased tridimensionality, the vast majority (8345) are side chains with 1392
aromatic cycles possible to be exchanged by 535 nonaromatic rings. Expectedly, the
most replaced aromatic moieties are phenyl (substituted or not), benzyl, and iso￾mers of pyridine (Figure 4.17a). The most frequent replacements, as described in
Figure 4.17b, point to purely carbon cycles. Interestingly, the second most frequent
aliphatic ring exchange to phenyl is cyclopropyl (1291 occurrences, Figure 4.17c),
a ring system of unique nature that makes carbons resemble to sp2 hybrids and
orbitalsto π-cloud. 75% of the occurrences of the phenyl-to-cyclopropyl exchange led
to molecules with similar or even better activity than the initial ones, which makes
this replacement a bioisostere of interest. The first nonaromatic heterocycle replac￾ing phenyl is morpholine (291 occurrences, Figure 4.17c), a medicinal chemistry
classic to increase solubility of druglike compounds that can be found in differ￾ent FDA-approved drugs, e.g. Gefitinib (refer to Figure 4.2). Another remarkable
example is given by the presence of adamantyl among the most frequent phenyl
replacements (255 occurrences, Figure 4.17c). Such very lipophilic and tridimen￾sional bioisosteres have been heavily studied in medicinal chemistry for their ability
to improve metabolic stability and access to CNS targets in different therapeutic
areas. [62–64].
1502 replacements of aromatic linkers to less flat nonaromatic rings can be found
in SwissBioisostere. These exchanges happen between 373 aromatic fragments and
310 nonaromatic rings. As for side chains, the most replaced aromatic moieties
involve phenyl or pyridine (Figure 4.18a). Again, the most frequent replacements
in Figure 4.18b illustrate that the majority of replacing fragments are purely carbon
linkers, apart from 1,4-phenyl replaced by 1,4-piperidine, with 64% of the 57 occur￾rences showing similar or higher bioactivity. The other most frequent replacements
of 1,4-phenyl involve cyclohexyl and other piperidines (Figure 4.18c). The ability to
easily browse less recurrent replacements through the SwissBioisostere interface
allows to spot real nuggets, such as small bicyclic bridged compounds. Nowadays,
bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane is a known useful phenyl mimic [66]. For example, the bicy￾clo[1.1.1]pentane analog of Darapladib, a lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2
(LpPLA2) inhibitor developed against atherosclerosis, resulted in slightly lower
in vitro potency – yet still at a subnanomolar level – but also allowed to reduced
lipophilicity and aromaticity, leading to enhanced permeability and solubility
(see Figure 4.18d) [65]. Another recent example reported an improvement of
physicochemical properties and a great improvement of the metabolic stability of
indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors, useful for cancer immunother￾apy, by replacing the 1,4-phenyl linker of the lead compound (see Figure 4.19) [67].
The bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane analogs were experimentally found to have excellent
potency, selectivity, and much-improved pharmacokinetics due to lower metabolic
hydrolysis of the amide moiety. As well, the three-dimensional overlap of both
bioisosteres in the IDO1 binding pocket was confirmed by X-ray crystallography.
Of note, the most recent literature is included in the next version of ChEMBL and
consequently in further updates of SwissBioisostere (see Section 4.3.1).(a)

Figure 4.19 Reducing aromaticity to increase metabolic stability. Replacing phenyl with
bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane bioisostere was successfully applied to reduce amide hydrolysis
liability of IDO1 inhibitors [67].
The amount of available data is much smaller for scaffolds, but the trends
observed for linkers and side chains are again followed. 120 replacements lower
flatness, involving a total of 51 aromatic moieties exchanged by 58 nonaromatic
rings. The most frequently replaced aromatic scaffolds include phenyls, pyridines,
and thiophene (Figure 4.20a). The 1,3,4-phenyl and 1,3,5-phenyl replacements (in
Figure 4.20b, c, respectively) are purely carbon cycles and bridged systems, with the
exception of 2,5,5-trisubstituted oxane.

4.5 Conclusive Remarks
SwissBioisostere consists in a knowledge and structural database of molecular
replacements built on highly curated data extracted from ChEMBL. The MMP
engine was used to define molecular replacements in pairs of relevant small
molecules based on chemical structure and bioactivity only. Although not part
of the definition of replacements, other related informations have been stored in
the database, like molecular and physicochemical properties, which are important
to assist medicinal chemists and other drug discovery experts in their hit finding
and lead optimization endeavors. Because universal rules cannot be applied to
guarantee a replacement to be bioisosteric, well-defined chemical and biological
contexts of the replacement are critical to selecting the most appropriate molecular
exchangesfor a distinct objective in each setting. With these practical considerations
in mind, a user-friendly web interface was developed and made accessible at www
.swissbioisostere.ch. This free website does not require any login information, and
the output is provided under CC-BY license to ensure anyone can benefit from this
broad wealth of accurate information and to enable freedom to operate in various
environments, including for for-profit or commercial applications.
The examples and use cases described in this chapter illustrate how Swiss￾Bioisostere can support drug discovery complementarily to other web tools
developed under the umbrella of the SwissDrugDesign project (https://www
.molecular-modelling.ch/swiss-drug-design.html).

5.1 Introduction
The Protein Data Bank (PDB) [1], managed by the global Worldwide PDB (wwPDB)
consortium [2], is one of the oldest scientific databases in life sciences. The PDB
archivesstructural models of biological macromolecules, derived from experimental
data. The wwPDB partners, the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformat￾ics (RCSB) [3], Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) [4], Protein Data Bank Japan
(PDBj) [5], Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) [6], and Bio Mag Res Bank
(BMRB) [7], manage the PDB archive based on the FAIR principles [8], ensuring
structural biology data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.
The PDB archive contains over 200,000 structures of proteins, DNA, and RNA, and
their complexes with small molecules, such as cofactors and inhibitors. This data,
along with related metadata and experimental data, are stored in the PDB archive in
PDBx/mmCIF formatted files [9]. Since 2019, it has been mandatory for X-ray crys￾tallographic structures to be deposited in the PDBx/mmCIF format [10], ensuring
maximum capture and validation of metadata for these structures.
The PDB is a vital resource for computer-aided drug design and contains struc￾tural information for large numbers of drugs, with 5494 unique ligands in the PDB
mapped to entries in DrugBank [11]. Additionally, there are numerous potential
drug targets as well as structures containing macromolecular drug targets. This data
are of paramount importance in determination of key drug binding sites in macro￾molecules [12], and in understanding existing binding modes to support designs of
novel compounds to target these binding sites.
In addition to the three-dimensional (3D) coordinate information archived in
the PDB, standardization of polymer sequences and chemical identifiers in PDB
entries facilitates the integration of additional metadata from external resources

[13, 14]. This additional biological and chemical information is vitally important in
understanding the scientific context of the structures in the PDB, which is required
to determine functional information.
As part of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the PDBe [4] is
uniquely placed to integrate macromolecular structure data from partner resources
at EBI and beyond. This allows the integration of relevant biological and chemical
data to better demonstrate the functional importance of structures in the PDB. The
PDBe-Knowledge Base (PDBe-KB) [15] builds upon this, with partnerships extend￾ing acrossthe structural bioinformatics community, allowing the integration of even
more data related to macromolecular structure and function. This includes a large
number of partners involved in cheminformatics who provide data relating to small
molecules and their macromolecular binding sites, including canSAR [16], 3DLi￾gandSite [17], P2Rank [18], and many more, detailed at pdbe-kb.org/partners.
The wwPDB, by adhering to the FAIR principles, ensuresthat all PDB data are pro￾vided freely, with no limits upon its use. All PDBe and PDBe-KB tools and resources
are also free to use, with scripts and software pipelines made open source wherever
possible. In addition to access through the PDBe [4] and PDBe-KB [15] websites, all
PDBe data are made available through publicly accessible APIs [19, 20], while much
of this data is also available via a distributed PDBe knowledge graph [20].
This chapter will introduce the type of data available in the PDB, how it is orga￾nized and curated, and how it can be used to support drug design. It will also give
an overview of the tools and resources at PDBe and PDBe-KB, highlighting how
these can support understanding of drug binding and function in PDB structures to
improve research within this area.
5.2 Small Molecule Data in Protein Data Bank (PDB)
Entries
5.2.1 What Data are in the PDB Archive?
The PDB is the single global archive of experimentally determined 3D structure
data of biological macromolecules. Each PDB structure must contain a polymeric
entity, i.e. protein or nucleic acid, however, information can also be included for all
non-polymeric ligands within the structure.
The atomic coordinates of a PDB entry are built with a specific hierarchy, ensuring
that each molecule and its constituent parts can be clearly identified. The smallest
component of the hierarchy is at the atomic level, with each separate coordinate line
in the archive file describing the specific position of an atom in 3D space. Each atom
is defined as part of a larger chemical component orresidue, defined by a 3-character
ID code.
These chemical components can be either individual bound ligands in the struc￾ture or individual residues within a polymeric molecule, with each defined by a
unique identifier (asym or chain ID) and numbering for clear identification. Beyond
each specific polymeric chain ID, each unique and individual molecule in the struc￾ture is also given a specific “entity” identifier, which is used to link all the metadata5.2 Small Molecule Data in Protein Data Bank (PDB) Entries 143
Figure 5.1 A sample of the atomic coordinates from a PDBx/mmCIF format file (PDB entry
2yi7) is shown on the left. The individual items in the “atom_site” category are listed first,
highlighting the data present in each column for the subsequent data. A subset of the
atomic coordinates is displayed below, with graphical representation of these coordinates,
displayed on the right of the image, only selected atoms are labeled for clarity.
relating to this molecule. More information about ligand molecules in the PDB will
be discussed in Section 5.3 (Figure 5.1).
As previously mentioned, the PDB is an archive of experimentally determined
structures and, as such, is limited to a subset of accepted experimental struc￾ture determination techniques. Depending on the experimental method used,
the archive PDB entry file will contain information specific to the technique,
while additional experimental data files are also collected to allow assessment
of experimental data in the context of the derived coordinate models. The three
main methods accepted for PDB depositions are diffraction techniques such as
X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR). A summary of the PDB deposition data requirements for each of
these techniques is given in Table 5.1.
The oldest and most common technique for determining structures in the PDB is
X-ray crystallography, which involves the generation of crystalline structures of the
biological sample. These crystals are then exposed to a high-powered X-ray beam,
often at a synchrotron facility, and the specific diffraction pattern from these X-rays
is collected by a detector. Before this diffraction pattern can be used for structure
calculation, first the phases must be determined, using techniquessuch as molecular
or isomorphous replacement.
Using the intensities and phases of the spots (or reflections) in the diffraction
pattern, crystallographers can calculate a map of electron density for the biologi￾cal specimen, into which the atomic model can be built. In addition to coordinates,
since 2008, submission of PDB structures solved by X-ray crystallography must also
include submission of the structure factor files defining the experimental reflec￾tions data.144 5 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting Computer

The first cryoEM structure in the PDB wasreleased in 1991, however, it hastaken a
long time forthe technique to establish itself as a routine method for high-resolution
structure determination. The technique involvesthe imaging of biological molecules
and complexes under cryogenic conditions, using a transmission electron micro￾scope. The sample is flash-frozen in a thin layer with electrons passing through the
sample to a detector, where images of each particle are captured. These images are
then sorted and processed computationally to generate a 3D map of the sample, to
allow fitting of a molecular model.
The use of cryoEM has allowed the determination of larger and more heteroge￾neous complexes than was previously possible with X-ray crystallography, however
until recently, was not able to reach resolutions sufficient to interpret atomic-level
details. However, recent advances in the technique, including improved software
and hardware including free-electron detectors, have led to cryoEM becoming the
fastest-growing experimental method for studying macromolecular structure [21].
This is due to the determination of high-resolution structures in conditions that5.2 Small Molecule Data in Protein Data Bank (PDB) Entries 145
better represent the native environment of the sample. Since 2016, submission of
cryoEM structures to the PDB has also required submission of the experimental
maps to the EMDB [6].
The third main technique used for solving structures in the PDB is NMR. This
method involves the use of powerful magnetic fields to discern minor differences in
the resonance frequencies, also known as chemical shifts, of atoms in the macro￾molecule. These chemical shifts are used to determine interactions among atoms in
the molecule and generate atomic restraints, which can be used to build the structure
of the macromolecules.
In solution-state NMR, the biological macromolecules can move freely in the sol￾vent, allowing these experiments to capture the range of structural conformations
adopted by these molecules. These structures are therefore deposited as multiple
models in the PDB, highlighting an ensemble of potential structural conformations
adopted by the macromolecules. An alternative technique is solid-state NMR [22],
which usessimilar underlying principles, however, is used to determine structures of
molecular structures within solid or semisolid materials, including macromolecules
within biological membranes.
Though the three experimental methods mentioned above account for the vast
majority of PDB entries, there are also additional variations in diffraction methods
that can be used to solve structures in the PDB. Firstly, neutron crystallography [23]
is a similar technique to X-ray crystallography, however, it relies upon neutron scat￾tering to determine the macromolecular structure. The benefit of this technique is
that the neutronsinteract with atomic nuclei,ratherthan electrons, which improves
observation of hydrogen atoms in the structure. Neutron and X-ray crystallography
are often used in conjunction to provide both high-resolution data and to determine
positions of hydrogen atoms.
There are also methodsthat utilizeX-ray crystallography to allow high-throughput
determination of ligand binding in macromolecules. Fragmentscreening [24] exper￾iments involve the “soaking” of various small molecule fragments into crystals
of the sample. Determining how these different fragments bind within the pro￾tein structure can help to improve the mechanistic understanding of a protein
and the identification of suitable drug candidates. Pan-Dataset Density Anal￾ysis (PanDDA) experiments [25] can be used to compare multiple fragment
screening datasets to identify weak signals of bound small molecules within the
noise of the data and can further improve the determination of small molecule
binding sites.
5.2.2 Definition of Small Molecules in OneDep
In the PDB archive, ligands are defined as any molecule that is not part of a larger
polymeric molecule, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, or branched carbohydrates [26].
In the case of peptide-like ligands, if these contain at least two standard peptide
bonds, then these are classed as polymeric entities. Small molecule ligands in the
PDB can have a range of distinct functions, for example, as substrates, products, and
inhibitors.146 5 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting Computer
Each distinct ligand in the PDB archive is assigned its own unique 3-character ID
code, to support easy identification acrossthe full archive [26]. Each of these ligands
includes a detailed chemical description, which is contained within the wwPDB
Chemical Component Dictionary (CCD), and discussed in more detail in the next
section.
5.3 Small Molecule Dictionaries
5.3.1 wwPDB Chemical Component Dictionary (CCD)
The wwPDB maintains a reference dictionary containing chemical descriptions
of each unique chemical component present in the whole PDB archive. These
components are the building blocks for PDB entries and include amino acids,
nucleotides, metal ions, and other nonpeptide small molecules. These chemical
component descriptions are stored in the wwPDB’s CCD (https://www.wwpdb.org/
data/ccd) [26].
Each component is given a unique identifier and has a CCD definition that
describes the molecule. As of July 2022, there are around 37,000 unique definitions
in the wwPDB CCD. The unique identifier is currently limited to a maximum
of three characters. Most definitions contain a three-character unique identifier,
with one- or two-character identifiers mostly used for identification of DNA and
RNA bases or for components containing individual elements. Some examples of
chemical components include manganese (Mn), adenosine-triphosphate (ATP),
and glutamate (GLU). Previously, these identifiers were assigned with some
meaning to their chemical definition, however, due to the high number of chemical
components in the dictionary, these CCD identifiers are now randomly assigned for
any new ligands.
If the CCD definition is defining a standard amino acid or nucleotide, the IUPAC
protein one-letter code [27] is also provided, for example, Glutamate has the
unique identifier GLU and the one-letter code E. Small modifications of standard
amino acids or nucleotides, generally, where the modification contains fewer than
10 atoms, have their own CCD definitions, for example, phospho-serine has the
identifier SEP. These modified amino acids or nucleotides have the same one-letter
code as their standard amino acid parent, therefore SEP, which is a modified serine
amino acid, also contains the one-letter code S.
Peptide-based chromophores provide a more complex example. In proteins,
chromophores typically comprise three amino acids condensed into one molecule.
In the CCD component, the one-letter code lists all amino acids that make up the
chromophore. For example, the CCD definition for the chromophore CR2, which
comprises the amino acids GLY-TYR-GLY and has the corresponding one-letter
code GYG.
In addition to providing a unique identifier, each CCD definition describes the
chemistry of the molecule. This includes the name of each atom in the molecule,
the order of bonds between atoms, stereochemistry of chiral atoms, and any charges5.3 Small Molecule Dictionaries 147
on individual atoms or the whole molecule. There are two sets of 3D coordinates
included in the CCD definition: the model coordinates, extracted from the PDB entry
from which the CCD was initially generated, and idealized coordinates (from the
lowest energy conformation), generated using the expected geometry of the ligand
from the CCD definition.
Additional metadata are also included in the CCD definition, including the name
of the molecule and any synonyms. If a common name is known for the compound,
then it is provided either as the name or as one of the synonyms, otherwise, system￾atic names are provided. The systematic name is the default name generated by the
OpenEye [28] software at the time of creation of the compound. Chemical descrip￾tors in InChI and SMILES formats are provided and are automatically generated by
OpenEye during creation of the compound.
Every molecule in the PDB must have a corresponding CCD definition. During
deposition and biocuration of PDB entries, each compound in the deposited file is
compared to existing CCD definitions using a graph match algorithm [29]. If refine￾ment restraints are provided in the uploaded coordinate file, then this information
is used for comparing the molecule to entriesin the CCD, otherwise, the coordinates
are used for searching. If a molecule fails to find a match in the CCD, then deposi￾tors are asked for further details of the molecule so that a new CCD definition can
be made. A new CCD definition is then defined during biocuration and added to
the CCD. The name of the molecule is either defined by the depositor, if a common
name is available, or a systematic name is generated based on the chemistry of the
molecule.
5.3.2 The Peptide Reference Dictionary
The PDB archive also contains examples of complex ligands, which comprise
combinations of amino acid and amino acid-like components. These peptide-like
molecules commonly possess important biological functions, such as antibiotic
or inhibitory activity, however, a description of their global chemistry does not fit
within the classic PDB definitions of polymers and ligands. Therefore, to support the
curation of this important class of molecules, their chemical and biological descrip￾tions are described in a separate dictionary. The “Peptide Reference Dictionary”
(PRD) resource [30] provides a standardized framework for these definitions so
that each PRD entity can be described in a way that outlines both its subcomponent
composition and global characteristics. These PRD definitions are stored in the
wwPDB Biologically Interesting Molecule Reference Dictionary (BIRD) (https://
www.wwpdb.org/data/bird).
The process of defining a new PRD molecule, or matching connected CCDs to
an existing PRD, occurs during the biocuration process. Any atomistic information,
such as reference coordinates, bonding, and chemical descriptors are then listed
in PRD-chemical definition files, whereas subcomponent sequence, CCD-linking,
and any related biological details, such as biological function, are stored in
PRD-molecular definition files. By using the PRD dictionary to standardize biocura￾tion, it allows for the precise interrogation, comparison, and retrieval of global and148 5 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting Computer

sugar components (cyan and grey in a 3D representation of the SNFG notation). The PRD

subcomponent-specific data, which would otherwise not be possible. Links to PRD
definition files can be found on relevant PDB entry pages and references to key PRD
identifiers (ID, name, type, and function) are stored in PDB entry PDBx/mmCIF
files under the pdbx_molecule_features category (Figure 5.2).
5.4 Additional Ligand Annotations in the PDB Archive
In addition to the standard chemical and biomolecular definitions already described,
where possible, the PDB biocuration pipeline generates additional ligand-related
information to best describe ligand complexity and intramolecular connectivity and
to do so with a consistent and objective methodology [31]. Many software packages
rely upon these data for purposessuch as molecular refinement and accurate molec￾ular visualization.
5.4.1 Linkage Information
The most common ligand-associated annotations found in PDB entry files refer
to intermolecular bonding. These refer to all nonstandard linkages between and
among polymer components and CCD ligands. This information was historically
found in PDB-format LINK, SSBOND, and CONECT records, however, the current
PDBx/mmCIF archive format provides additional data, including leaving group
information, atomic descriptions, and author numbering for up to three chemical
component partners per interaction [9]. At present, to ensure standardization across
the whole PDB archive, all link records and bonding distances are calculated and
validated during the biocuration process [31]. The PDBx/mmCIF dictionary cur￾rently supports covalent, hydrogen, covalent–metal, and disulfide-bond interaction
“types” [32] (Figure 5.3).5.4 Additional Ligand Annotations in the PDB Archive 149

N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) ligands (NAG2-NAG1) and covalent N-Glycosylation between

5.4.2 Carbohydrates
The most recent development concerning PDB ligand definitions relates to
the annotation of polymeric carbohydrates [33]. These new “branched poly￾mer” descriptions (entity_type item “branched”) are composed of multiple and
sequential CCD monosaccharides. The description of polymeric carbohydrates is
outlined within the PDBx/mmCIF model file for a given PDB entry, under the
new pdbx categories entity_branch, entity_branch_descriptor, entity_branch_link,
entity_branch_list, and branch_scheme (Figure 5.4a). Whilst chemically distinct

for PDB accession 5ofx; https://pdbe.org/5ofx.150 5 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting Computer
from the peptide-like PRD molecules, carbohydrates of biological significance may
also be described by the PRD dictionary files where they hold functional classifica￾tions such as “nutrients” or “inhibitors.” The annotation of carbohydrate-branched
polymers occurs within the automatic processing of the biocuration pipeline.
Different carbohydrate visual representations may now also be found on wwPDB
partner websites, using the community standard SNFG notation [34, 35], both as
2D images on each entry page, and 3D-SNFG [36] units within the Mol* viewer
(Figure 5.4b).
5.5 Validation of Ligands in the Worldwide Protein Data
Bank (wwPDB)
Currently, PDB contains over 34,000 unique small molecules bound to over 133,600
protein structures. Numerous groups have highlighted the need for standardized
validation in structures in the PDB archive [37–44]. Several errors have even led to
the retraction of the respective publication(s) and subsequent obsoletion of the PDB
entry [43]. A Validation Task Force (VTF) was set up to centralize and standardize
validation acrossthe wwPDB archive, which included metricsto judge the reliability
of the ligand-bound macromolecular structures as they play a pivotal role in many
computational methods like ligand docking and structure-based drug design. This
resulted in development of the wwPDB validation reports (VR), first introduced in
2012.
wwPDB validation pipeline (VP) generates detailed wwPDB VR comprising
an assessment of structure quality using widely accepted standards and criteria
recommended by various method-specific VTFs [45–47]. To enhance ligand vali￾dation, in 2015, wwPDB, CCDC (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center), and
D3R (Drug Design Data Resource) co-organized the ligand validation workshop
(LVW) [48] whose recommendations were recently implemented in VP [14]. VP
is an integral part of the unified OneDep system for structure deposition [13],
validation [49], and biocuration [31]. Before depositing the structure in the wwPDB
archive, the depositor can generate a wwPDB VR using the standalone validation
server (validate.wwpdb.org) or API (wwpdb.org/validation/onedep-validation￾web-service-interface ) to find and fix any issues highlighted in the VR. At the
time of deposition, a “preliminary” VR is issued to the depositor, followed by the
“official” VR after the completion of biocuration process. Once the structure is
released, the VR is made public and is provided as both human-readable PDF files
and machine-readable mmCIF and XML files. In the next section, we will further
discuss various criteria and software used for validation of ligands in the VR.
5.5.1 Various Criteria and Software Used for Validating Ligand
in Validation Reports
wwPDB validation criteria for ligands can be broadly divided into two categories (I)

5.5.2 Identification of Ligand of Interest (LOI)
Since 2017, the depositors are required to identify the ligand(s)in the structure that is
eitherthe focus of theirstudy oris considered biologically important. This LOI infor￾mation is recorded during the deposition of structure in the OneDep system [13].
All its details can be found in the “Entry composition” section of the VR. In the VP,
Maxit [50] extractsthe atomic coordinates of ligand(s),reorder and rename its atoms
according to the CCD after which geometric quality of these is assessed further.152 5 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting Computer
5.5.3 Geometric and Conformational Validation
Following the recommendation of wwPDB X-ray VTF, ligand geometry is validated
against the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) of high-quality small molecule
organic structure [45]. Firstly, CSD structures with similar bond order are identified
and then a distribution for the observed values for each bond length, bond angle,
torsion angle, or ring in the ligand is built using the program Mogul [51]. It then
computes the Z-score, which quantifies deviation from the observed values. Bond
lengths and bond angles with absolute Z-score >2.0 are flagged as “outliers” in the
VR. The normalized Z-scores (RMSZ) of bond lengths/angles are calculated to facil￾itate the overall assessment of the ligand. RMSZ scores are expected to lie between
0 and 1. For low-resolution structures, geometry should be tightly restrained and
small values are expected. For very high-resolution structures, values approaching 1
may be attained. Values greater than 1 generally indicate over-fitting of the data. For
acyclic torsion angles, Mogul computes the local density measure [52], which is the
ratio of incidencesin the CSD within 10∘ of the torsion angle in question, to the num￾ber of total incidences of the torsion angles in the CSD. The torsion angle is flagged
as an outlier if the local density measure is <5%. For isolated rings, Mogul compares
the given ring with comparable rings in small molecule structures in the CSD and
calculates an RMSD value based on corresponding constituent torsion angles for
each comparable ring. If both the mean and minimum of these RMSDs are >60∘,
the ring is flagged as an outlier. Chirality outliers are calculated by Validation-pack
[14] and are assessed based on chiral volume. If the sign of the computed volume
is incorrect, the handedness is wrong. If the absolute volume is less than 0.7Å3, the
chiral center is as a planar moiety, which is highly likely to be erroneous. All these
geometric outliers are listed in the “Ligand geometry” section of the VR.
Apart from merely identifying the geometric outliers, it is also important to know
the extent of distortion from the Mogul expectation. After the latest update of VP
[14], this information is now clear in 2D colored images generated by Buster-report
[53]. This image depicts Mogul quality analysis of bond lengths, bond angles, tor￾sion angles, and ring geometry [43] and is added to the “Ligand geometry” section
of VR. Color scheme used in these images is coded according to validation results
with green indicating commonly observed values, magenta indicating unusual val￾ues, and grey indicating that there was insufficient data to derive a validation score
(see Figure 5.5b). Unusual values include model quality and electron density fit.
For model quality, individual bond lengths or angles with absolute Z-score >2, the
torsion angle with <5% of local density measure, or RMSD >60∘ are considered
unusual and colored in magenta. These images can be helpful for depositorsto iden￾tify any putative incorrect restraint values used during refinement before depositing
the structure.
5.5.4 Ligand Fit to Experimental Electron Density Validation
Apart from validating the geometric quality of the ligand, it is also crucial to
inspect local agreement of a structure model with the observed electron density and5.5 Validation of Ligands in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) 153

determine the accuracy of ligand placement. wwPDB validation pipeline uses the
REFMAC5 program [54] from CCP4 suite to calculate electron density maps based
on the coordinates in the entry and deposited experimental X-ray structure factors
using a procedure adapted from EDS [55]. To quantify how well the observed and
calculated electron density matches, VP computes Real-Space R (RSR) value for
each residue/ligand in structure using the MAPMAN program [55]. Lower the value
of RSR, more closely the observed and calculated electron density matches, thus
the residue/ligand fits better to experimental data. RSR value of 0 indicates “perfect
agreement” and RSR>0.4 indicates poor fit or low data resolution. MAPMAN also
computes another alternative to RSR, called the Real Space Correlation Coefficient
(RSCC). RSCC ranges from 1.0 to −1.0 indicating “perfect correlation” to “perfect
anticorrelation”. The RSR and RSCC values can be found in the “Fit of model
and data” section of VR. RSR computation requires the two density maps to be154 5 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting Computer
scaled together; this limitation can be overcome by using RSCC. However, RSCC
is insensitive to the density level. Thus, VR uses a combination of RSCC and RSR
to assess the goodness of fit. Ligands with RSCC<0.8 and RSR> 0.4 are flagged as
poorly fitted to electron density and are highlighted in yellow in VR.
Apart from these quantitative measures for goodness of fit, visual inspections of
the ligand–protein coordinates with electron-density maps are immensely useful to
judge the ligand placement, especially for nonspecialist users of biomolecular struc￾tures. The 3D views of the atomic-level structure model fit to experimental electron
density [43] generated by buster-report are now added in VR [14]. For the color
scheme, the 2mFo-DFc density map isshown in grey, while the positive and negative
mFo-DFc difference density maps are shown in green and magenta,respectively (see
Figure 5.5d). Figure 5.5 comparesthe above discussed ligand quality metrics/images
for PDB entries 7c83 and 5b1y, which represent higher and lower ligand quality,
respectively. It should be noted that the outliers flagged during the validation do not
necessarily indicate errors in the model. These can also be genuine unusual cases,
which may be functionally relevant too. To capture these genuine cases, wwPDB
is constantly improving OneDep deposition system to facilitate depositors to add
explanatory comments.
5.5.5 Accessing wwPDB Validation Reports from PDBe Entry Pages
The wwPDB VRs are made available at all PDB sites, as well as directly from the
wwPDB website. Each PDB entry is assigned a unique DOI, allowing direct access
to the coordinates and VRs at the wwPDB website. Therefore, you can access the
wwPDB page for a specific PDB entry by using the following URL, where [PDB_ID]
is the PDB entry ID: https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb[PDB_ID]/pdb. This page contains
minimal information about the entry and download links, which includes the VR in
either PDF or XML format.
You can also access the VRs from the PDBe entry pages, either by navigating to
the specific entry page or directly from the PDBe search results. On the PDBe entry
pages, there are options to “view” or “download” files relating to that specific entry.
These options include the option to view or download the VR in either PDF or XML
format. Furthermore, there isthe option to “download files” for an entry in the PDBe
search results and this includes download of VR files (Figure 5.6).
5.5.6 Other Planned Improvements to Enhance Ligand Validation
wwPDB validation is being improved continuously with the help of valuable feed￾back from wwPDB VTFs, depositors, and our diverse community of users. As perthe
recommendations for LVW, percentile scores for the overall ligand quality will soon
be incorporated into the VR [14]. The wwPDB OneDep system was recently mod￾ified to record the restraints for ligands used by depositors during the refinement
process. Furthermore, these restraint values will be included in VR, where these
will be compared with Mogul target values helping users to identify the outliers that
do not accord with Mogul assessment. Additionally, the EDS program of VP is being5.6 PDBe Tools for Ligand Analysis 155

only as components of the experimental sample buffers. Biologically important
small moleculesin PDB entriesinclude drugs, cofactors, metabolites, carbohydrates,
and lipids. Pipelines developed at PDBe help to distinguish biologically important
ligands and provide functional annotations to place them in their biological context
(see Section 5.7 for details).
5.6.1.1 Classifying Ligand Interactions
It is important to identify the protonation state of a ligand in order to accurately
define and classify its interactions with other molecules. However, the resolution of
most PDB structures is not sufficient to support the modeling of hydrogen atoms.
Therefore, a process must add hydrogen atoms before the identification of ligand
interactions. For protonation of molecular structures, PDBe uses ChimeraX, [56]
which supports the input of assembly mmCIF files, representing the whole molecu￾lar complex, rather than only the asymmetric unit for crystallographic entries.
After protonation, the PDBe process uses the Arpeggio software [57] to identify
ligand interactions. There are four main categories of interactions determined
by Arpeggio: (I) atom–atom interactions; (II) atom–plane interactions; (III)156 5 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting Computer

atoms and bonds shown in grey by default. The colored atoms represent the following
different examples of interactions between the ligand and neighboring amino acids: in red,

plane–plane interactions, and (IV) plane–group interactions. Examples of each of
these interactions are displayed in Figure 5.7. For a more comprehensive overview
of the molecular interactions identified by Arpeggio, along with their description,
please see the supplementary information of the Arpeggio manuscript.
5.6.1.2 Data Availability
Details on molecular interactions are available through the PDBe API (https://pdbe
.org/aggregated-api). The API provides atomic-level information for individual
ligand instances in a particular PDB entry and residue-level information aggregated
for all PDB entries for a specific protein of interest. The protonated biological
assemblies are also available through the PDBe ModelServer (https://www.ebi
.ac.uk/pdbe/coordinates/index.html), a service, which allows dynamic access to
atomic coordinatesfrom PDB entries. Arpeggio usesthese assembliesfor computing
interactions.
5.6.2 Ligand Environment Component
While a trained eye can often intuitively recognize significant partners of the
molecular interactions within a binding site, it is helpful to visualize these inter￾actions both in a 2D schematic way, and in a 3D viewer, particularly for less
experienced users of PDB data. PDBe provides a schematic interactive visualization
of ligand-binding sites in atom-level and residue-level detail that corresponds to
the 3D conformation of the binding site. There are two levels of visualization,5.6 PDBe Tools for Ligand Analysis 157

with the aromatic stacking interaction highlighted between tyrosine’s side chain and phenyl

one for residue-level interactions of polysaccharides and another for atom-level
interactions of ligands defined in the wwPDB CCD. This information is available
for all PDB entries (Figure 5.8).
The ligand interactions component is interactive and seamlessly communicates
with the 3D viewer Mol*[58] to better depict the spatial distribution of the residues
forming a binding site. Users can export the underlying interactions from the 2D
component in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format and the depiction in SVG
format. All the ligands with atom-level information are displayed in the same con￾formation and orientation to support a straightforward comparison of the similar
ligands across varying binding sites and PDB entries. Residues forming the binding
site are color-coded. This color-coding is consistent with the PDBe-KB aggregated
views of proteins pages and follows the Clustal X [59] scheme. Finally, the ligand
interaction component depicts known glycans following the recommendations of
the SNFG [34].158 5 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting Computer
5.6.3 Chemistry Process and FTP
At the PDBe, there is a weekly process to generate 2D images of the small molecules
defined in the wwPDB CCD. This process also produces representations of these
small molecules in community-used data formats, which are not available directly
from the PDB archive. Additionally, PDBe processes continuously update wwPDB
CIF files with further annotationsto better place these ligandsin their broader chem￾ical and biological context. These additional annotations include:
● Mapping of molecular identifiers to many other popular resources (e.g. ChEMBL
[60] and PubChem [61])
● Regenerated “idealized” conformers (lowest energy conformation) using RDKit
● Physicochemical properties
● Murcko scaffolds
● Substructures (fragments) found in a ligand with pointers to three different frag￾ment libraries
● Known synonyms
● Details of the ligand classification, properties, and possible known targets from
the DrugBank database [11]
All the files generated by the PDBe chemistry process are available from the PDBe
FTP area (http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/msd/pdbechem_v2). The data are
organized hierarchically in a tree-like directory structure (e.g. A/ATP/…). A list of
example files for the CCD ID ATP is given in Table 5.3.
5.6.4 PDBeChem Pages
The long-established PDBeChem service (https://pdbe.org/chem) offers a generic
browsing interface for all the ligands defined in the wwPDB CCD. A wide range
of search options is available from the main page, including search by (I) CCD ID;
(II) molecule name; (III) chemical formula; (IV) nonstereo SMILES, and (V) set of
predefined fragments.
If the user provides a search input that is not specific to a single ligand ID,
PDBeChem returns all results that match the search input as a list of ID codes, with
the name, formula, and chemical image displayed. If the user searches for an exact
CCD ID or molecule name, or clicks on a specific ligand ID in the search results,
the page redirects to an entry page for that ligand.
5.7 Ligand-Related Annotations in the PDBe-KB
5.7.1 Introduction to PDBe-KB
The PDBe-KB (https://pdbe-kb.org) is a collaborative data resource established in
2018 [62]. It is developed and maintained by the PDBe team at EMBL-EBI. The
mission of PDBe-KB is to place macromolecular structure data in their biological
context, mapping biochemical-, biophysical-, and functional annotations to the5.7 Ligand-Related Annotations in the PDBe-KB 159

structural models that are archived in the PDB [1]. It is a collaborative effort
between PDBe and an ecosystem of specialist data resources and scientific software
that provides pieces of the biological context for proteins and nucleic acids. As of
2021, 31 data providers contribute over 800,000 annotations for over 170,000 PDB
entries. These annotations are crucial to understanding the role and mechanism
of small molecules that interact with proteins and nucleic acids (Table 5.4). Data
providers deposit curated annotations, such as catalytic sites [63] and biologically
relevant metal ions [64], and predicted annotations, such as druggable pockets [65]
and predicted ligand binding sites [17, 18].
5.7.2 Data Access Mechanisms for Ligand-Related Annotations
Data contributors rely on the PDBe-KB deposition system, which consists of three
main components(Figure 5.9): (I) a data exchange format; (II) an FTP area provided
by EMBL-EBI; and (III) the data validation and conversion process responsible for
the seamless integration of annotations with the core PDB data.
The data exchange format is a schema implemented as a JSON specification devel￾oped and maintained by the PDBe-KB consortium of data providers and software
developers.It aimsto capture the commonality ofresidue-level annotations by focus￾ing on the minimally necessary amount of meta-information that users require to
utilize the deposited annotations. The format captures the annotations of residues,
their corresponding probabilities and confidence measures, the underlying evidence
as defined by the Evidence Code Ontology [68], and links to where users may find
more comprehensive datasets and meta-information that is specific to a given data
provider. The schema is open access and is freely available at https://github.com/

Figure 5.9 Mechanism of data transfer to PDBe-KB: the PDBe-KB consortium members
prepare JSON files that record their annotations in a format that complies with the data
exchange schema. Depositors transfer these files via File Transfer Protocol (FTP). A set of
computational processes parse, validate, and convert the files in preparation for the
integration with the core PDB data in the PDBe knowledge graph. The data are publicly
accessible via the distributed graph database, the programmatic access points of the PDBe
aggregated API, and the PDBe-KB web pages.
Data providers convert their annotations to comply with the data exchange for￾mat and transfer them via FTP. PDBe-KB then makes these raw JSON files con￾taining the annotations available to the public at http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/
pdbe-kb/, together with standardized benchmarking datasetsthat the PDBe-KB con￾sortium collates. The deposited data are used to regenerate the PDBe knowledge
graph weekly, ensuring that PDB entries are up-to-date and integrated with the lat￾est PDBe-KB annotations. This process validates the deposited JSON files, converts
them into CSV format, and imports them into the PDBe knowledge graph.
The PDBe knowledge graph is a Neo4j (https://neo4j.com/) graph database that
stores the core PDB data and PDBe-KB annotations. Users may download the
database from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/graph-download to install it
locally and mine the PDBe knowledge graph for macromolecular structures and
their ligand molecules, together with their functional annotations. The schema of
the graph database is also openly accessible at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe￾kb/schema through an interactive schema explorer.
Users can access data from the graph database via a set of 80+ Application
Programmatic Interface (API) endpoints. These API endpoints cover all the
aspects of the information integrated into the knowledge graph. The endpoints are
grouped into categories, such as those related to compounds, proteins (i.e. UniProt
accessions), PDB entries or data validation. Specifically, the compound-related162 5 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting Computer
API endpoints provide information about (I) all the PDB entries that contain a
particular compound; (II) all the atoms and bonds of the molecule; (III) all the
similar compounds found in the PDB; (IV) substructures of the ligand molecule;
(V) annotations of the ligand molecule as cofactor-like, reactant-like or drug-like;
and (VI) summary information of the molecule containing a variety of descriptors
like InChI, InChIkey, SMILES, systematic names, synonyms, physicochemical
properties, and many more. The complete set of API endpoints is documented at
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/graph-api/pdbe_doc.
5.7.3 Ligand-Related Annotations on the Aggregated Views of Proteins
The PDBe-KB aggregated views of proteins[62] are the first of a set of novel data visu￾alizationsthat display all the available structural information for an entity otherthan
a single PDB entry. These web pages show all the available molecular structures,
functional-, biochemical-, and biophysical annotations, and all the small molecules
that interact with a protein identified by a UniProt accession. The aggregated views
rely on the aggregated API to retrieve both the core PDB data and the PDBe-KB
annotations. These pages include (I) a gallery of all the small molecules that inter￾act with a protein of interest; (II) annotations for these ligands, such as cofactors
or reactants; (III) residue-level annotations of the binding sites (both experimen￾tally observed/predicted), and (IV) an interactive 3D visualization of all the ligands
superposed on all the available PDB structures for a protein of interest.
The “Ligands and Environments” section of these aggregated views contains
ligand-related information (Figure 5.10). It has a gallery that displays all the small
molecules found directly interacting with the protein of interest or observed in
the PDB entry of the protein of interest but interacting with a different protein
chain or nucleic acid (Figure 5.10a). The gallery displays a chemical structure of
the compound, its 3-letter code (“HET” code in PDB nomenclature), its recom￾mended name, and any available annotations, such as cofactor-like, reactant-like,
or drug-like [62, 69]. The ligands are also clustered based on their scaffold, so that
similar ligands are grouped together, making visual comparisons more convenient.
Users can download all the PDB entries containing a specific small molecule
by clicking on the “download” button from the gallery. Clicking on any 2D
representations will open an interactive 3D viewer, Mol* [58], to investigate the
binding sites and the ligands in 3D. This section also includes a 2D sequence feature
viewer (ProtVista [70]) that displays all the residues of the protein of interest that
interact with a specific small molecule (Figure 5.10b). The more frequently and
consistently interacting residues have a darker shade of blue, distinguishing them
from other nonspecifically interacting residues (shown in light shade of blue). This
view enables researchers to identify patterns in the binding events and elucidate
common key binding residues at a glance. Finally, users can also download these
annotations in CSV or JSON formats.
In addition to displaying individual binding sites using Mol* in the ligand gallery,
the aggregated views also provide the option to display a superposed view of all the
small moleculesfrom all the PDB entriesfor a specific protein segment (Figure 5.11).5.7 Ligand-Related Annotations in the PDBe-KB 163

displays all the small molecules that interact with any of the processed proteins of the
Replicase polyprotein 1ab of SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/proteins/
P0DTD1). It allows the users to download all the PDB entries that contain both the protein
and a particular small molecule. Biologically relevant small molecules, such as cofactors,
are displayed in green boxes. The gallery also displays a chemical structure of the ligand,
and clicking on these images opens an interactive 3D molecular viewer, Mol*. The sequence
feature viewer, ProtVista (panel b), displays all the protein residues, which directly interact
with ligands.
This superposed view is available from the summary section of the web page by
clicking on the “View all ligands” button. A representative PDB structure from each
superposition cluster is displayed by default, together with all the small molecules
found in any PDB entries for that segment (residue range). This view is most
helpful for proteins where fragment screening experiments identified high numbers
of interactions as superposition view can conveniently highlight all the binding
pockets.
All the information on the PDBe-KB webpages is powered by the PDBe-KB graph
API. Users can use these API endpointsto obtain variousligand-related data in a pro￾grammatic manner. For instance, users can get a list of all the ligands similar to the
LOI using https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/graph-api/compound/similarity/:hetcode.
This API endpoint returns stereoisomers, ligands with the same scaffold, and
ligands with similarity of over 60% defined by PARITY method [71]. Other API

5.8 Case Study: Using PDB Data to Support Drug
Discovery
There are many cases of PDB data being used to support drug discovery [12].
One of the most high-profile, recent cases is the COVID Moonshot consortium,
an open-science collaboration aiming to use structure data for drug discovery of
antiviral drugs to combat COVID-19 and potential future viral pandemics [72–77].
This worldwide consortium integrates several approaches to support the drug
discovery process, based on data from structural biology, biochemistry, and molec￾ular simulations, leading to identification of compounds that could be suitable for
advancing into clinical trials.
The COVID Moonshot campaign focusesspecifically on collecting data relating to
the main protease protein (Mpro)from SARS-CoV-2, the virusthat causesCOVID-19
[74, 75]. This protein is required for processing of polyproteins and thus generation
of all mature proteinsin all coronaviruses. Thisistherefore a key target for disrupting
viral activity and hasthe potential for generation of broad-spectrum antivirals acting
across a number of different organisms.
Furthermore, the structure of Mpro was the first from SARS-CoV-2 to be made
available in the PDB archive in early 2020, solved by Zihe Rao’s group and col￾leagues in China [78]. This availability of experimental structural biology data, and
the shared knowledge of how to effectively generate crystals of Mpro, allowed further
structural biology, including fragment screening experiments, to proceed at pace5.9 Conclusions and Outlook 165
Figure 5.12 Aggregated structure data from PDBe-KB for a single protein chain of Mpro
from SARS-CoV-2. Protein chain is displayed as ribbon and colored green, with a selection
of bound ligands from fragment screening experiments displayed as ball and stick and
colored pink. Data from pdbekb.org/proteins/P0DTD1.
[73]. Thisled to the identification of numerous chemical fragmentsthat were further
assayed to identify binding affinities (Figure 5.12).
After the identification of this host of chemical fragments that bound to Mpro, a
number of other methods were used to enhance the compounds and support faster
drug development. This included creation of an online crowdsourcing platform to
allow worldwide participantsto submit their own compound designs, based on these
fragment screening hits [77]. The consortium also leveraged the use of machine
learning techniquesin orderto design new compounds optimized for activity against
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [74]. In addition, another computational pipeline, covalentizer,
was developed and used to identify modification to compounds that would allow
covalent attachment to nearby cysteine residues to cause inhibition [75].
All these efforts have led to the rapid identification of a number of promising
antiviral therapeutics, with the first of these now progressing to preclinical evalu￾ation [77]. Despite this success, the consortium continues to pursue other potential
compounds across differentstructural groups. Furthermore, they are making all data
freely available, and allrelevant compounds can be purchased from consortium part￾ners. The hope is that this method of open data and collaboration in drug discovery
will open up development of new drugs across more diseases, faster and more afford￾ably than ever before [77].
5.9 Conclusions and Outlook
Asthe PDB archive continuesto expand, both in quantity and diversity ofstructures,
it becomes an increasingly valuable resource for drug design [12]. Furthermore,166 5 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Macromolecular Structure Data Supporting Computer
in addition to knowledge being derived directly from macromolecular structures
in the PDB, this data are also being used to improve prediction of novel struc￾tures [79, 80]. Prediction of protein folds has improved dramatically in recent
years, thanks to the use of machine learning approaches, which are increasingly
successful thanks to the quality and quantity of training datasets available in the
PDB [81, 82]. Thousands of these high-quality protein structure predictions are now
publicly available from the AlphaFold Database at EMBL-EBI (https://alphafold.ebi
.ac.uk) [83].
Despite these improvements in protein structure prediction, there is still a long
way to go before large, novel protein complexes can be predicted with any con￾fidence, though improvements are being made to the prediction of small protein
complexes [84]. In addition, even the most accurate computational predictions are
not precise enough to confidently model ligand binding sites, therefore, making this
improvement of limited use for drug design. Therefore, it isstill critical that the PDB
provide high-quality, accessible structures to support the computational chemistry
community and support drug discovery.
The data and tools provided by PDBe and PDBe-KB support researchers by pro￾viding a means to easily interpret binding sites in macromolecules, and validate
thisinformation based on experimental data. The standardization ofsmall molecule
information allows the easy comparison of binding sites across multiple structures
and comparison of interactions between related small molecules. The visualization
tools developed at PDBe and PDBe-KB allow users to easily interpret the data, guid￾ing future research and developments in drug design.
5.9.1 Upcoming Features and Improvements
The team at PDBe-KB is currently working on the development of the PDBe-KB
aggregated views of ligands. Following the same principles as the aggregated views
of proteins, these pages will collate all the available data in the PDB for specific lig￾ands of interest. This will allow users to easily find all the structures containing a
specific ligand and view common interactions made by that ligand across multiple
PDB entries. These pages will also highlight similar, related ligands in the PDB that
share common scaffolds, while also providing a host of ligand properties and links
to additional resources for even more in-depth analysis. The first iteration of the
aggregated views of ligands is due to be released in late 2023.
Another project that is underway and aims to support the drug design commu￾nity is the BioChemGraph project. This project is a collaboration between PDBe [4],
ChEMBL [54], and Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC) [45], and aims
to improve the integration of data between these three vital chemistry resources.
This collaboration will help to increase the coverage of ligand information beyond
what is available in the PDB, while also adding even more functional annotations
for small molecule ligands. Through the BioChemGraph project and the aggregated
views of ligands, we aim to greatly improve access and interpretation of chemistry
data in the PDB.References 167

6.1 Introduction
Computer-Aided Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) is the branch of
Computer-Aided Drug Design, where the three-dimensional (3D) structure of
a target protein is used to guide the computational design of drug-like molecules
that strongly interact with it [1, 2]. Experimental structure determination has been
the prime method for acquiring 3D structural information of targets for SBDD
and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [3] has been the major source of experimentally
determined structures of proteins and their complexes. Since its origins in 1971,
it archives and provides access to 3D macromolecular structures resulting from
various biophysical methods such as X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or Electron Microscopy (EM). The continuous
development of such techniques, together with the availability of high-throughput
methods for large-scale protein structure determination [4–6], promoted a rapid
increase in the number of protein structures deposited in the PDB, with more than
192,000 available as of July 2022.
Despite this rapid increase, this number only represents a small fraction of all
naturally occurring proteins. The rate by which protein sequence data becomes
available is much higher than the rate by which proteins can be experimen￾tally characterized, and computational structural modeling is the method of
choice to cover this knowledge gap [7]. More recently, computational structure
prediction methods became commonly applied in SBDD [8–10]. Over the last
decades, two different computational structure prediction approaches emerged:
(i) comparative methods based on homology [11] and (ii) ab initio techniques [12].
While homology-based modeling relies on the identification of a protein of known

structure that is evolutionarily related to the desired target and using it as a template
for modeling, ab initio methods exploit the sampling ofstructural fragments[13, 14],
molecular dynamics [15], distance predictions from coevolution signals in deep
multiple sequence alignments [16], or deep learning-based techniques [17, 18], to
infer protein 3D models.
As the PDB is dedicated solely to archiving experimentally determined struc￾tures [19], published computational models generated by such approaches are
usually stored in dedicated repositories, such as ModelArchive (https://www
.modelarchive.org/) [20]. The increasing availability of high-performance comput￾ing facilities in both the academic and industrial sectors, as well as algorithmic
improvements, considerably shortened computation time and allowed for the
construction of high-throughput protein structure prediction pipelines whose
results have extensive applications, including virtual screening. To make better
use of computing time and provide easy access to high-quality, precomputed, and
annotated models, the results of such large-scale efforts have typically been made
available through dedicated databases, including the Genomic Threading Database
(http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/GTD/) [21, 22], ModBase (https://modbase.compbio
.ucsf.edu/) [23], Genome 3D (http://www.genome3d.net/) [24], GPCRdb (https://
gpcrdb.org/) [25], and the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AlphaFold DB;
https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) [26].
In this chapter, we review the SWISS-MODEL Repository (SMR: https://
swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/) [27, 28], which provides access to annotated 3D
protein models created by different modeling pipelines. Initially, SMR contained
models generated by the SWISS-MODEL pipeline [29–31], and later included
available experimental structures from the PDB. Recently, it evolved into a general
database of annotated protein models for most sequences in the UniProt Knowl￾edgebase (UniProtKB) [32] from multiple sources, including the AlphaFold DB and
ModelArchive. UniProtKB is the major database of protein knowledge and gathers
sequence and functional information for over 230 million entries, including those
manually curated in Swiss-Prot and those automatically annotated in TrEMBL.
The main goal of SMR is to provide life scientists with an up-to-date and annotated
collection of high-quality protein structure models, both experimental and com￾putational. Sequence-based and structural annotations, such as domains, variants,
ligands, and transmembrane segments, help researchers to better analyze, and
interpret those structures. SMR provides access to this information for every entry
in UniProtKB. Proteins can be queried based on several criteria such as UniProtKB
accession code (AC), protein name, or full-text search. Through a user-friendly web
interface, SMR provides cross-referencing to the respective annotation databases,
and the ability to transfer specific features from templates, such as protein–ligand
interactions, allowing for the analysis and interpretation of structural models and

SMR, how they help complement the structural coverage of the database, their6.2 SMR Database Content and Model Providers 177
characteristics, respective strengths, and weaknesses, as well as aspects to watch
out for before using them in SBDD projects. The list of data providers in SMR is con￾tinuously updated to reflect the latest method developments in structural biology.
As of July 2022, SMR includes experimental structures from the PDB, homology
models from SWISS-MODEL, predicted models from the AlphaFold Database,
and a number of manually selected model sets from ModelArchive. The SMR
team manually curates the list of model providers to have a set of well-established
complementary methods and defines automatic filters to only include predictions
of sufficiently high quality.
6.2.1 PDB
The PDB [3] contains experimentally derived models, including homo and het￾eromeric protein complexes and complexes of proteins with other types of biological
macromolecules, including nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and ligands such as
metal ions,small organic molecules, and peptides. The PDB isthe gold standard that
is used for the training of computational methods and is one of the major sources
of structural information for SBDD [33]. Proteins in the PDB do not necessarily
correspond directly or exactly to sequence entries in UniProtKB. Therefore, the
“Structure Integration with Function, Taxonomy, and Sequence” (SIFTS) resource
[34, 35] provides mappings between these structures and different databases,
including UniProtKB. SMR uses this mapping to include and display experimental
structures. In total, over 477,000 UniProtKB entries (including more than 47,000
Swiss-Prot entries) are currently covered, at least partially, by the experimental
structures through the SIFTS mapping. This corresponds to more than 52,000
nonredundant sequences (including more than 30,000 in Swiss-Prot).
Although structures are generally of high quality and have undergone curation,
they may still contain errors or inaccuracies driven by multiple factors, such as the
quality or resolution of the experimental data. The PDB makes a significant effort
in assessing the quality of the structures it publishes, as well as making this pro￾cess transparent in the form of validation reports [36, 37]. Key quality metrics, the
R values, assess the goodness-of-fit between the model and the underlying electron
densities at the local and global levels, but these metrics can be challenging to inter￾pret. The electron density score for individual atoms (EDIA) metric [38–40] is not
included in SMR, and users must manually query this data from the ProteinsPlus
server (https://proteins.plus), with a special focus on the desired binding sites. As
SMR includes all PDB entries mapped via SIFTS and does not apply quality filtering,
users are advised to assess the data quality independently, including the experi￾mental data support of the protein and ligand atom coordinates, either through the
ProteinsPlus server or the corresponding PDB validation report.
6.2.2 SWISS-MODEL
SWISS-MODEL is a fully automated protein structure modeling server, which
implements a homology modeling pipeline [31]. The workflow encompasses
six main steps: (i) homologous proteins with known structures to be used as178 6 The SWISS-MODEL Repository of 3D Protein Structures and Models
templates are searched with BLAST [41] and HHblits, which is more sensitive
and predicts better alignments for templates with low sequence identity [42], and
the resulting alignment is retrieved; (ii) the oligomeric state is predicted from the
target sequence(s) and the templates; (iii) one or more templates are selected,
maximizing the length of the modeled region in the target sequence(s); (iv) a
model is built for each selected template using the default homology modeling
pipeline in the ProMod3 modeling engine [43], with additional models being
progressively generated if new segments can be covered or if alternative models
with different conformations (e.g. corresponding to different closed/open states)
can be generated; (v) final models are then refined by energy minimization using
the OpenMM molecular mechanics library [44]; and (vi) their quality evaluated
with QMEANDisCo [45] so that only high-quality models are gathered in SMR.
A local QMEANDisCo score is provided for each residue and ranges from 0 to 1
with a higher score indicating higher accuracy. The scores are trained to predict
the all-atom lDDT score [46], which is described further below. SMR only includes
models from SWISS-MODEL with a global QMEANDisCo (average of local scores)
of at least 0.5.
In order to complement the PDB, SMR defines a set of species whose full
proteomes are updated weekly with the SWISS-MODEL pipeline to consider
new structures released in the PDB. The set of species is manually curated by
the SMR team together with Swiss-Prot based on how often they get accessed in
UniProt and on user requests. Currently, the set includes the following 13 species:
Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Escherichia coli, Arabidopsis
thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces
pombe, Caulobacter vibrioides, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aerugi￾nosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Plasmodium falciparum. In addition, models for
the remaining sequences of Swiss-Prot are regularly updated, and the results of
automated modeling jobs requested by users for any protein from UniProtKB are
also imported into SMR. This continuous update helps to ensure that (i) the target
coverage is as complete as possible given the currently available templates, (ii) the
models are built using the most recent sequence and template structure databases,
and (iii) the continuous improvements of the underlying modeling pipeline
are fully applied. Homology models allow increasing the structural coverage of
UniProtKB significantly. SWISS-MODEL provides models for more than 3.4 million
entries (1.2 million nonredundant sequences). Almost 90% of all Swiss-Prot entries
(505,000), and 74% of the entries in the proteomes of the 13 “core” species (104,000)
are, at least partially, covered. More than 385,000 high-quality models built by
SWISS-MODEL contain ligands, and 483,000 are quaternary structure assemblies
based on annotations from the PDB, both of which can be of relevance in SBDD.
Untilrecently, the highest prediction accuracy wasreached fortargets with homol￾ogous proteins of known structure, where template-based methods worked best
[47, 48]. But with the latest developments in deep neural networks, high-accuracy
models are now also available for targets without homologous template struc￾tures [48, 49]. Still, template-based methods remain widely used in SBDD and are
very accurate for cases with high sequence identity to a known template. On average,6.2 SMR Database Content and Model Providers 179

side-chain placement is unreliable when the sequence identity to the template is
lower than 70%, and overall model accuracy drops sharply when it is lower than
30% [50, 51]. However, sequence identity is a poor proxy for quality, and users
should carefully check global and local quality scores before using these models.
Figure 6.1 shows a selection of models for the estrogen-related receptor gamma
(P62508, ERR3_HUMAN) ligand-binding domain (Interpro: IPR000536), built from
different templates and showing decreasing levels of predicted quality from left
to right starting from the reference structure (PDB entry: 6I62, Figure 1.1a). The
models built from PDB entry 3D24 (Figure 6.1b) and PDB entry 2A3I (Figure 6.1c),
display very high QMEANDisCo global scores, and very high local quality scores
(0.8 and above) in the binding site region (green circle). The remaining models
(Figure 6.1d–f) show lower QMEANDisCo global scores, and in particular, the local
qualities in the binding site start to deteriorate (around 0.6 or lower). These models
should be used with caution for SBDD, like molecular docking, for instance.
6.2.3 AlphaFold Database
Recently, DeepMind and the EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)
launched the AlphaFold DB [26]. It is an archive of protein models automatically
generated by the AlphaFold modeling engine [18], a deep neural network, which
was able to outperform all other participants at the CASP14 experiment, and in
some cases even detected errors in the experimental structures [49].
So far, the AlphaFold DB provides models for proteins with 16 to 2700 residues.
For human proteins with more than 2700 residues, models are made available for
overlapping, 1400-residue-long fragments. AlphaFold DB does only provide one
isoform per protein. For each Cα atom in each model, AlphaFold estimates the
corresponding lDDT-Cα score, denoted predicted lDDT (pLDDT). The per-residue
pLDDT scores are stored in the model file (B-factor column for PDB files or
_ma_qa_metric categories for the ModelCIF files) and indicate the expected local180 6 The SWISS-MODEL Repository of 3D Protein Structures and Models
confidence in the structure. The scores vary between 0 and 100, with higher values
expressing an expected higher accuracy of the models. The average pLDDT over
the entire model provides a general measure of the overall expected backbone
accuracy. So far, no quality measure for side chains is given, but highly accurate
side chains are expected when the backbone is highly accurate [18, 49]. Each
model in the AlphaFold DB is also accompanied by a Predicted Aligned Error
(PAE) matrix, which indicates the expected positional error at residue i when
the model is superposed on residue j of the actual, real structure and thus can
be used to assess the confidence in the relative orientation of different regions
of the predicted model. The PAE matrix helps, for example, to assess the relative
orientation, and corresponding modeled contacts, of different domains in the same
chain, complementing the pLDDT scores.
As of August 2022, the AlphaFold DB contains models for over 200 million pro￾teins, covering a large proportion of all catalogued protein sequences. This includes
models for most entries in Swiss-Prot, most non-viral entries in UniProt, and the
full proteomes of 48 species of particular scientific relevance, as model organisms
or those related to global health. The AlphaFold DB allows for single-entry or bulk
download of models, for example, those for specific proteomes. It also provides pro￾grammatic access through an API. SMR automatically retrieves the models with
the 3D-Beacons API (https://3d-beacons.org) and displays them alongside the other
computational models and experimentalstructures. All modelsin the AlphaFold DB
meet the quality criteria for the inclusion in SMR.
AlphaFold models only include single proteinsin their monomeric form, although
research is actively ongoing to extend these possibilities, in particular, to model
heteromers. Therefore, users that use these models should be aware that certain
properties, like surface accessibility, might differ from those observed in a biological
setting. In addition, disordered loops and regions are included in AlphaFold
models, however the biological context, such as the presence of ligands or cofactors,
is ignored. In the case of the Human B-raf kinase (P15056, BRAF_HUMAN), for
instance, the protein contains a nucleotide binding site, and the corresponding bind￾ing pocket can be targeted by inhibitors, as shown in PDB entry 4E26 (Figure 6.2a).
In the AlphaFold model of this protein (Figure 6.2b), careful inspection of local qual￾ity scoresshowsreduced accuracy of the nucleotide-binding site, with pLDDT values
down to around 60. In addition, a disordered loop with pLDDT values at or below
30 is in close proximity and is modeled to pass through the binding site. Molecular
recognition of inhibitors by the binding pocket becomes impossible if this loop is
wrongly kept inside. The PAE matrix displayed in the AlphaFold DB (Figure 6.2c)
also suggeststhat while the domains are modeled with high confidence, theirrelative
orientation is uncertain and particularly so for the position of the disordered loop
with respect to the rest of the protein. Reviewing these confidence metrics and care￾ful visual inspection are critical before using AlphaFold models in SBDD projects.
6.2.4 ModelArchive
Finally, the SMR provides some manually selected, large-scale model sets from
ModelArchive [20, 52, 53]. ModelArchive is an archive for theoretical models of6.3 Protein Feature Annotation and Cross-References to Computational Resources 181

macromolecular structures and complements the PDB for experimental structures
and the PDB-Dev [54] for integrative structures, where experimental and computa￾tional methods are combined. Any researcher can deposit models in ModelArchive
to make them available and supplement manuscripts for which the models were
generated. As of July 2022, it contains more than 2800 models deposited on behalf
of more than 110 researchers in computational structural biology worldwide. The
modelsin the archive are automatically validated fortheir data format and manually
checked by the ModelArchive team to ensure that they include a minimal level of
method and quality annotations. However, their quality varies widely, and they rep￾resent a snapshot in time of the depositor’s best effort to predict the protein structure.
Being generated by many different researchers using various methods, often these
models do not fit the “high-quality” definition for model inclusion in SMR. How￾ever, some studies provide high-quality models with reliable quality metrics and are
included on a case-by-case basis according to manual checks by the SMR team. For
instance, the methods used to generate the set of models of protein–protein inter￾actions across the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome deposited in ModelArchive by
Humphreys et al. [55] have been thoroughly reviewed to ensure high quality and
reliable quality estimates. They are therefore included in SMR.
6.3 Protein Feature Annotation and Cross-References
to Computational Resources
6.3.1 Structural Features, Ligands, and Oligomers
To facilitate the interpretation of the structural models, SMR is cross-referenced
with UniProtKB and InterPro [56], and users can manually add sequence features182 6 The SWISS-MODEL Repository of 3D Protein Structures and Models
to any of the models. This allows different sequence and structure annotations to
be mapped into the models and to provide a more detailed understanding of their
molecular features. Annotations include protein domains and families, transmem￾brane segments and signal sequences, catalytic and binding sites, as well as natural
variants. These are mapped at the sequence level and transferred into the structural
model for visualization.
Properties of templates used to build models with SWISS-MODEL are also
transferred where possible, which includes transmembrane annotations and orien￾tation, and protein–ligand interactions. Transmembrane proteins are automatically
identified in the weekly integration of PDB structures in SMR, and such structures
are automatically displayed with dummy atoms that delimit a putative membrane
region. This prediction is carried out based solely on structural information, by
estimating the optimal membrane location for each biounit in the structure and
classifying it based on energetic and geometric criteria as in Lomize et al. [57]. This
membrane annotation is transferred to a model if at least 80% of all transmembrane
residues in the template are aligned with the target sequence.
The relative coordinates of biologically relevant ligands, including not only small
molecules but also metals and cofactors, are transferred from the template if the
binding site is fully conserved and the resulting atomic interactions in the model
are within the expected range for van der Waals interactions and water-mediated
contacts. If this conservative homology transfer approach is too restrictive, the user
can use an appropriate ligand docking tool such as SwissDock [58, 59] to predict
the molecular interactions between the model and a ligand. When ligands are
present in the model, seven types of noncovalent protein–ligand interactions are
annotated with the Protein–Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) [60] (i.e. hydrogen
bonds, hydrophobic contacts, π–stacking, π–cation interactions, salt bridges, water
bridges, and halogen bonds).
In biological settings, proteins do rarely operate in isolation. Many proteins
will oligomerize by forming homo-oligomers, or assemble with other proteins
into hetero-oligomeric complexes. SMR provides ways to visualize and navigate
the partners when the information is available. Structures from the PDB often
include such information. However, the automatic prediction of interaction part￾ners still remains a challenge for automated methods, such as SWISS-MODEL
or AlphaFold. Therefore, only a handful of experimentally supported or thor￾oughly validated heteromeric models are currently available in SMR, and cover
pathogen–pathogen and human–pathogen interactions for SARS-CoV-2 proteins
and multiple protein-interacting pairs from the S. cerevisiae interactome.
6.3.2 SWISS-MODEL associated tools
SMR is functionally linked with other parts of the interactive SWISS-MODEL
workspace. The main link isto the SWISS-MODEL modeling engine, allowing users
to submit modeling jobs for any UniProtKB entry, independently of whether there
is a high-quality model already in SMR or not. Interactive remodeling can be useful
to investigate the presence of ligands in the templates, to assess conformational6.3 Protein Feature Annotation and Cross-References to Computational Resources 183
changes of the protein (see Section 6.5 below), or to evaluate the presence of
new templates for organisms, which are not part of the 13 regularly updated core
species. The page of an entry provides a first-glance view of the model, showing the
annotations described above, as well as global and local quality summaries, and
target–template sequence alignment. Further insights can be gained by forwarding
the model to the “Structure Assessment” and “Structure Comparison” tools.
The “Structure Assessment” page (Figure 6.3, https://swissmodel.expasy.org/
assess) provides detailed structural information about the model. Together with
the local and global quality estimates computed with QMEANDisCo, this page
also displays the Ramachandran Plot (i.e. the distribution of Φ/Ψ dihedral angles,
Figure 6.3a) for the model, as well as relevant scores provided by Molprobity [61],
highlighting where residues of low quality are located in the model (Figure 6.3b).
Additionally, amino acid residues from all protein polypeptide chains in the model
are visualized in an interactive 3D view (Figure 6.3c) and a sequence display
(Figure 6.3d), with each residue represented by its one-letter code below a bar chart
displaying the QMEANDisCo local quality estimation value.
The “Structure Comparison” page (Figure 6.4a, https://swissmodel.expasy.org/
comparison/), on the other hand, displays multiple models in a single view, auto￾matically comparing them and highlighting structural variations. A model can be
compared to other models for the same or similar proteins with a structural super￾position based on the aligned sequences. The page showsthe structure and sequence
alignments and also performsthe following analyses which allow forthe detection of
structural variations: (i) Ensemble Consistency, which measures the local deviation
of a protein structure (or model) from the consensus established by all other struc￾tures being compared, similar to classical consensus approaches in protein model
quality estimation [62] and (ii) Ensemble Variance, which assesses the variance of
interatomic distances in the full ensemble [63].
6.3.3 Web and API Access
To enable a variety of usages in SBDD and other fields, SMR provides several ways
to navigate, access, visualize and download its data: by (i) a web interface and ded￾icated per-entry pages, (ii) bulk downloads for any of the 13 SWISS-MODEL core
proteomes, and (iii) programmatic access using a REST API.
The main entry point to the Repository is the web interface (https://swissmodel
.expasy.org/repository/). A search bar at the top of every page (Figure 6.5a)
allows direct access to an entry by entering its UniProtKB accession (for instance
P9WJM9) or UniProtKB entry name (MSHC_MYCTU). In addition, the search bar
enables free-text searches for protein names, descriptions, and keywords, as well
as mnemonic protein identification codes and descriptions. The search results are
sorted based on various criteria (e.g. the presence of the entry in Swiss-Prot or in
one of the 13 core species), and show the ranges of the full-length protein that are
structurally elucidated by experimental structures or computational models.
Each entry in UniProtKB has its own detailed page in SMR. A typical example
page is shown in Figure 6.5b, corresponding to one entry identifier with links184 6 The SWISS-MODEL Repository of 3D Protein Structures and Models

This will highlight the interacting residues in the model (Figure 6.5b (5)). The
appearance of the protein model can be changed with the options in Figure 6.5b (6),
which includes representation (e.g. cartoon or surface) and coloring mode (e.g.
amino acid properties or local quality estimates, accessible with the cogwheel

Figure 6.5b (7) lists all models and experimental structures available for the target
entry, and controls what is displayed in the viewer. The initial selection is based
on several criteria: type of model (experimental or computational), oligomeric
state, coverage range, experimental method, resolution, and model quality. Finally,
Figure 6.5b (8) displays alignments between the target and the template (for
homology models) or the alignment between the experimental structure and the
UniProtKB sequence, or between the model and the UniProtKB sequence for other
models. Here, the residues are colored according to the display in the 3D viewer
(Figure 6.5b (4)) and their sequence numbering can be shown by hovering the
alignment.
For users who require structural information for a large number of proteins, the
repository providestwo downloadable filesfor each of the 13 core species covered by
SWISS-MODEL. They are available from the landing page of the repository (https://
swissmodel.expasy.org/repository) and are updated shortly after every UniProtKB
release. The first corresponds to the metadata, which contains an index of all the
homology-based models and experimental structures available for that organism. It
(i) lists information on the part of the protein that each model covers, (ii) provides
a link for the download of the structure’s atomic coordinates file, and (iii) provides
template and model quality information for homology-based models. The same data
are also available in tab-separated and JSON formats. The second file contains the
atomic coordinates of all the homology-based models for the organism in PDB for￾mat. It does not contain experimental structures or models built by AlphaFold, but
modelsthat can be built with templates mapped via SIFTS are included. Those mod￾els can be useful even if the protein is covered in the PDB: (i) template selection aims
to pick a high-quality structure if multiple exist; (ii) gaps will be filled; (iii) target
sequence will be aligned with the UniProtKB sequence; and (iv) sidechains may be
adjusted when sequence identity is below 100%. Users who require a large number
of homology models for an organism that is not part of the 13 core species are free
to contact the SWISS-MODEL help desk, who can generate a bulk download with
recently updated homology models.
Programmatic accessto the repository via the SMR REST API (https://swissmodel
.expasy.org/docs/repository_help#smr_api) provides most flexibility, including
detailed access to per-residue information on homology models and experimental
structures. It follows the OpenAPI specifications (https://www.openapis.org/),
and its full documentation is available on the Repository Help page. In addition,
the 3D-Beacons (https://3d-beacons.org) API provides summary information per
UniProtKB entry for several model providers, including those in SMR.188 6 The SWISS-MODEL Repository of 3D Protein Structures and Models
6.4 Quality Estimates and Benchmarking
SMR aims to only include high-quality models in its database. But what does high
quality mean, especially in the context of SBDD? To answer such questions, the
CAMEO benchmarking effort has been providing blind, weekly, automated bench￾marking services for structure prediction methods since 2012 [63–66]. Based on the
PDB pre-release data, which is part of the PDB release cycle, CAMEO participants
are provided with a selection of sequences of proteins whose structures are going to
be published in the following PDB release. The predictions are then compared to the
newly released experimental structures, which are considered the gold standard.
To perform this comparison, several different metrics are used. Calculating the
root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions between the reference
structure and the model is a straightforward approach, but is strongly influenced
by outliers in poorly predicted regions, is insensitive to missing parts of the model,
and is strongly dependent on the superposition of the model with the reference
structure [46]. Another approach that has been developed in the context of CASP
is the Global Distance Test (GDT) score [67, 68], which quantifies the number of
corresponding atoms in the model that can be superposed within a set of prede￾fined tolerance thresholds to the reference structure. Although it is not sensitive
to outliers and accounts for missing parts of the model, it is still dependent on
superposition. In the case of flexible proteins composed of several domains, which
can naturally change their relative orientation with respect to each other, a global
rigid-body superposition is typically dominated by the largest domain, and as a
consequence, the smaller domains may not correctly match, which can result
in artificially unfavorable scores. In CASP, the effects of domain movement are
mitigated by splitting the target into the so-called assessment units (AUs), which
are evaluated separately. However, this process is based on visual inspection and
remains mostly manual and often based on subjective criteria [46].
Superposition-free scores such as the local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) [46],
which is a measure forthe conservation of interatomic distances between the predic￾tion and the reference structure, or the Contact Area Difference (CAD) score [69],
based on differencesin residue-residue contact area using Voronoi tessellation, have
solved these problems. Both methods calculate a “local” (per-residue)score, which is
often averaged into a “global” score representing the overall confidence in the model.
The lDDT score and several field-specific variants have been developed. Of particu￾lar note in the context of SBDD is the lDDT-BS score, which assesses the accuracy
of binding sites of biologically relevant ligands [64].
However, at the time of modeling, structure prediction methods do not know the
correct answer, which preventsthem from providing a direct metric of model quality.
Thus, they typically report an estimation instead, which representstheir expectation
of the accuracy of the model. Of course, such estimations should be accurate, which
is also assessed by CAMEO. Even for very good prediction methods, the quality of
predictions can vary from one model to another, and even between regions within
a single model. Therefore, CAMEO participants are tasked to provide reliable esti￾mates of the quality of their predictions at a per-residue level, also known as “Model6.5 Binding Site Conformational States 189
Confidence” scores. The accuracy of the model confidence scores is evaluated by
assessing the ability of those scoresto distinguish between high-quality (lDDT≥0.6)
and low-quality (lDDT<0.6) residues using an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (ROC AUC) metric, which shows how sensitivity and speci￾ficity change as the decision threshold of local quality changes. Higher ROC AUC
indicates more accurate predictions. Over the years, benchmarking of model qual￾ity estimation methods resulted in significant improvements in the performance of
those methods [65], and has impacted internal model quality estimates too. Predic￾tion of local lDDT scores has become a standard way to report internal model quality
predictions, with both AlphaFold (pLDDT, which predicts lDDT-Cα, a variation of
the lDDT score restricted to Cα atoms) and SWISS-MODEL (with QMEANDisCo
which predicts the all-atom lDDT score) using comparable scores.
All computational models in SMR provide such a local confidence measure, with
a method that has been critically benchmarked in CAMEO [65] and CASP [70].
Although all computational models are of high global quality (with criteria depend￾ing on the model provider), users should carefully review local quality information
before attempting to use the model for SBDD. Docking a compound in a low-quality
region is likely to produce wrong or misleading results. While there is no exact cut￾off, users should be particularly cautious with any region where residues show local
lDDT scores below 0.6.
6.5 Binding Site Conformational States
Most experimental structures and computational models are a snapshot in time and
do not account for conformational changes and flexibility. However, proteins are
dynamic in nature and their conformation can change, e.g. upon substrate bind￾ing. The aspartyl proteases [71], adenylate kinases [72], and cytochrome P450 [73]
are three examples. In other cases, allosteric effects due to binding of a molecule
outside the active site trigger structural changes in the binding site [74]. Thus, for
computer-aided SBDD applications, it is essential to make sure that the predicted
model or experimentalstructure representsthe conformationalstate that is adequate
for the specific downstream application.
With experimental structures from the PDB, such assessment is a relatively easy
task and can be directly derived from the description and presence or absence
of ligands in the structure. This can be illustrated in the example of the Human
Beta-secretase 1 (P56817, BACE1_HUMAN). A wealth of experimental structures
for this member of the aspartyl protease family is available for the bound (e.g.
3TPL) and unbound (e.g. 3TPR) states in both the PDB and SMR. The Structure
Comparison tool (Figure 6.4a), available by clicking on the “compare” icon in the
list of structures (Figure 6.5b 9), carries out a superposition, which highlights the
structural differences to better inform the selection of a structure in the adequate
conformation.
On the other hand, the homology models from SWISS-MODEL listed in SMR are
built from automatically selected templates. They undergo minimal postprocessing190 6 The SWISS-MODEL Repository of 3D Protein Structures and Models
and will adopt the binding site conformational state of the template regardless of
the presence of a ligand in the final model. Because of its strict ligand transfer rules,
SWISS-MODEL may produce a model of a bound state without the relevant ligand,
even when the model is based on a template with relatively high sequence identity.
Therefore, the absence of a ligand in a predicted structure is no guarantee that a
conformation in the unbound state was built. Instead, users need to check whether
ligands were present in the template used for modeling. They can do so by following
the link to the template used for modeling (Figure 6.5b 3).
In cases where ligand binding causes significant structural changes, SWISS￾MODEL can produce models for several of the conformations of the protein if corre￾sponding template structures are available. The adenylate kinase from P. aeruginosa
(Q9HXV4, KAD_PSEAE) is an illustrative example: since the conformational
changes on ligand binding are rather large (more than 10Å after a superposition
based on the target–template alignment), SWISS-MODEL built two models of the
protein, one in each state (open and closed).
However, in other cases, the conformational changes may also be more subtle
and not picked up automatically by the algorithm. Since there is no preferential
conformation, models may represent either open (as in Dictyostelium discoideum,
Q54QJ9, KAD2_DICDI) or closed (as in S. cerevisiae, P07170, KAD2_YEAST) states.
Alternative conformational states of the target protein can be remodeled directly
from within SMR by using the “Interactive Modeling” button above the 3D view
(Figure 6.5b 3) and clicking on the “Search For Templates” button in the next win￾dow. In the resulting page (Figure 6.4b, which shows interactive template search
results for D. discoideum, Q54QJ9, KAD2_DICDI), a selection of templates is pre￾sented which attempts to balance structural diversity with the predicted quality of
the resulting model. Using the template descriptions (Figure 6.4b, left), bound lig￾ands and 3D viewer (Figure 6.4b, right), users can explore the diversity of the tem￾plate conformations and choose an appropriate selection of templates for modeling.
Once that is done, clicking on the “Build Models” button (Figure 6.4b, top) will start
the modeling process. If needed, models based on other templates can always be
built at a later time point.
With AlphaFold models, the exact conformationalstate of a protein cannot be con￾trolled.It has been shown that AlphaFold predictsthe holo (bound)state of a protein
in 70% of the cases [75] and users should exercise extra caution when using these
models for docking studies.
6.6 SMR and Computer-Aided Structure-based Drug
Design
Despite the recent astonishing results in protein structure prediction by the appli￾cation of deep-learning-based methods [76, 77], homology-based modeling remains
the most commonly used technique in SBDD due to its short response time, its
direct relation to experimentally determined structures and well-established track
record. One of the most recent applications of the SWISS-MODEL infrastructure6.7 Conclusion and Outlook 191
was the generation of models for proteins from SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike
protein for which a model was produced to accompany the publication of the
sequenced genome of the virus [78]. To respond to the demand for such models,
SMR introduced a dedicated page (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/
species/2697049) to make models for all single proteins and relevant protein
complexes of SARS-CoV-2 publicly available. These models are generated and
annotated following the same procedures and summary formats as regular SMR
entries and are frequently updated. In addition, annotations for most “Variants of
Interest” and “Variants of Concern” are available.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the SWISS-MODEL infrastructure and these
models have been explored by multiple teams worldwide in the quest for a ther￾apy, including the mapping of druggable cavities in diverse, therapeutically relevant
SARS-CoV-2 proteins [79, 80], the search for possible drugs by virtual screening
[81, 82] or drug repurposing [83–85], the design of vaccines by antibody [86, 87],
and the analysis of variant effects [88–90]. In these studies, researchers used SMR
as a source of protein structure models and their quality estimations and also uti￾lized the SWISS-MODEL pipeline for the identification of ligand-binding sites or
the modeling of specific targets or antibody scaffolds.
But the use of SMR and SWISS-MODEL predictions for SBDD goes beyond
COVID-19. For example, in a study about the toxic effect of curcumin, a flavonoid
derived from the traditional medicinal plant Curcuma longa L, on female repro￾duction and embryo development, high-quality structure predictions of several
key curcuma-binding proteins of unknown structure were collected from SMR
and used for molecular docking in order to analyze the curcuma-binding mode
and estimate its affinity [91]. Watanabe et al. followed a similar approach in a
recent study on the possible anticancer effect of rabdosianone I, a bitter diterpene
extracted from the oriental herb Isodon japonicus Hara, but in this case, the authors
opted to predict 3D structural models using their own selection of templates [92]. In
another study, Kwarteng et al. used SWISS-MODEL and its quality estimation tools
to obtain a single high-quality structural model of 5′
-aminolevulinic acid synthase
from the Wolbachia bacteria (wALAS) and used it for virtual screening over 3200
FDA-approved drugs in the quest of treatment of neglected tropical diseases caused
by these endosymbionts and endemic in African and Latin American countries[93].
Finally, in a study about the unexpected secondary effects of two azole antifungals
by the overseen, potential inhibition of human 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
2 (11β-HSD2), Inderbinen et al. predicted structures for the human and mouse
proteins with SWISS-MODEL using multiple user-selected templates and used
different predicted models to inspect the effects of species-specific variations in the
binding of the two ligands [94].
6.7 Conclusion and Outlook
SMR is a source of high-quality, experimental, and computational structural mod￾els of proteins from UniProtKB. These models come from various providers: the192 6 The SWISS-MODEL Repository of 3D Protein Structures and Models
PDB, ModelArchive, the AlphaFold DB, and the homology modeling pipeline imple￾mented in SWISS-MODEL. The repository is updated frequently in order to assure
a comprehensive, high-quality snapshot of the current experimental and computa￾tional structural knowledge is provided. The cross-references to protein sequence
and structural feature annotation databases, the mapping of transmembrane seg￾ments, and the inclusion of ligand information transferred from templates of known
structure allow for an integrative analysis of the models, which may aid and inform
different approaches in SBDD.
Deep-learning-based methods,such as AlphaFold [18] and RoseTTAFold [17], are
revolutionizing the field of protein structure prediction [48, 95], impacting various
fields of research, and could have ripple effects on many others, including SBDD
[96]. The high accuracy ofsuch modelsfor both proteins with and without homologs
of known structure, accompanied by their increasing speed, allows researchers and
companies to not only produce a model of their favorite protein in a timely manner
but also the generation of large sets across entire proteomes. The availability of these
models in online repositories such as ModelArchive or the AlphaFold DB makes it
possible for a fast bridging of the protein sequence–structure gap, which was out of
the reach of biophysical methods and homology modeling.
However, when it comes to SBDD, the impact of deep-learning-based methods is
still unclear. While the accuracy of these methods is high, it is higher for the protein
backbone than forthe side chains[49], which may result in low-quality binding sites.
Downstream methodsthatrequire a highly accurate binding site and do not account
for conformational changes will fail [97]. It is thus imperative to inspect local qual￾ity estimates in binding sites and, especially for full-length protein models from the
AlphaFold DB, watch out for predicted disordered regions and uncertain domain
orientations. When homologs of known structure exist, homology modeling users
can hand-pick their templates, which allows for some control over the orientation
of side chains and overall conformational changes. Hence, our recommendation is
to always check first if a template-based method can provide a high-quality model
and possibly refine the model with a manually selected template, and then extend
the structural coverage with models from AlphaFold if this is needed. For SBDD to
make full use of the extended structural coverage provided by AlphaFold, docking
tools able to better account for inaccurately modeled and flexible binding sites are
needed.
Additionally, users must bear in mind that current structure prediction methods
are not able to include and consider post-translational modifications (PTMs), such
as phosphorylations and glycosylations, which may affect conformational states
or surface accessibility. There are ongoing efforts to use deep neural networks
for PTMs [98], as well as for reliably and accurately predicting and modeling
protein–protein interaction pairs [55], and for the prediction and annotation of
functional regions [99], ligand-binding sites [100] and variant effects [101]. We
expect that the fast-paced development of structural and annotation methods will
continue in the coming years, which will drive a rapid and continuous adaptation
of model repositories and model quality estimators.References 193
When using any model for downstream SBDD applications, such as docking,
the most critical parameter is model accuracy [102], especially at the all-atom and
side-chain conformation levels. SMR displays all PDB structures and AlphaFold
DB models available for a given UniProtKB AC, and only high-quality homology
models or manually curated models from ModelArchive. Quality is measured based
on quality estimation metrics, such as QMEANDisCo, which predict the average
conservation of interatomic distances in the neighborhood of a residue (lDDT)
when compared to the “correct” structure. The integration of protein assemblies
and the modeling of complexes with ligands and other macromolecules will likely
require the development of quality estimation metrics beyond those currently
employed to better account for protein interfaces. Future scores should also be
able to distinguish regions with disorder and flexibility from modeling inaccuracies
since currently both would be represented by low lDDT values. In addition, the
development of clearer and comparable quality estimates is a must. We expect
that the CASP experiment [48] and CAMEO [63] will act as major forces in that
direction.
The field is developing rapidly, and significant developments will occur in the
coming years. We expect that computational model repositories and automated
method benchmarking will help researchers along this path and, by providing
state-of-the-art annotated models to everyone, remain useful tools for those who
are not directly involved in structure prediction method development.

PDB-REDO is both a pipeline that aims to optimize crystallographic macromolec￾ular structure models and a databank offering optimized versions of Protein Data
Bank (PDB) models. The automated decision-making system refines, rebuilds, and
validates the models available in the PDB or provided by users, based on their origi￾nal experimental diffraction data. It returns a new structure model with rich meta￾data on model quality and structural changes. Optimized PDB models are saved to
the PDB-REDO databank, which contains “redone” structure models with their elec￾tron density maps and associated validation data. The PDB-REDO databank is a good
resource for structure models in a computer-aided drug design (CADD) project.
7.1 History and Concepts
7.1.1 X-ray Structure Models
The most commonly used technique to obtain macromolecular structure models is
X-ray crystallography (Figure 7.1).In the crystallographic process, the protein, DNA,
RNA, or complex is crystallized and irradiated with X-rays. This results in a set of
2D diffraction images, which undergoes a series of complex operations to determine
the intensity and the associated error of diffracted X-rays constrained by the sym￾metry of the crystal. This results into what we will refer to here as “experimental
data,” a list of intensities and their estimated errors. After the experimental data
are available, crystallographers need to retrieve the missing phases of the diffracted
X-rays by computational methods that involve prior knowledge about the nature of
the macromolecularstructure, often by collecting additional experimental data. The
experimental data and the phase estimates allow the construction of a 3D electron
density map, which is to construct an initial structure model [1]. Next, this atomic
model is refined using refinement software [2–4] and validated against targets based
on independent knowledge of the macromolecular structure [5]. Important steps in
this process are defining the parametersforthe refinement and judging the quality of

the newly obtained model based on the validation. There are various software pack￾ages available for the refinement and validation [6–8], each with its own strengths
and weaknesses. The rebuilding,refinement, and validation stepsshould be repeated
because, due to the intricacies of the crystallographic process we briefly explained
above, better estimates of the phases are computed and thus better electron density
maps when the atomic model improves. After many iterations, the structure model
cannot be improved any further and isthen considered “optimal” [9]. This end-point
remains highly subjective to date [10].
For several decades (50 years at the moment of writing [11, 12]), crystallographers
have uploaded their structure models obtained from crystallography experiments
to the PDB [13]. This databank contains over 180,000 structure models and has
become a key resource for (computational) structural biology, biochemistry, and
drug design with 1.3G downloads in 2020 alone. Experimental techniques and also
the software used to analyze the diffraction data continue to develop and improve.
This has resulted in overall more accurate models of macromolecular structures
that were mostly deposited more recently [14]. Usually, crystallographers continue
with other projects and do not update the deposited structure models after PDB
deposition. As a result, especially older structure models are not as accurate as they
could be with the current computational methods. Researchers interested in such
a structure may choose to optimize the structure themselves when experimental
data are available. The latter is not always the case, as only since 2008 the PDB has
made it mandatory to upload the experimental data when depositing a new struc￾ture model to this database [5]. Nevertheless, 86% of all X-ray diffraction entries have
their experimental data available. As crystallographic skills do not necessarily belong
to the expertise of researchersin CADD, judging the quality of a structure model can
become problematic. For such structural biology research purposes, but also to help
active crystallographers determine better structures, the PDB-REDO procedure and
the associated databank have been developed [15].
7.1.2 PDB-REDO Development
The PDB-REDO databank contains alternative versions of the X-ray crystallographic
structure models deposited in the PDB that were updated with the PDB-REDO
software pipeline using the original experimental data that is also deposited with
most PDB entries. PDB-REDO entries (>155,000) are generally of better quality
than their PDB counterparts in terms of fit to the experimental data and molecular
geometry [15]. An additional and crucial benefit for CADD approaches is that the7.1 History and Concepts 203
(methodological) uniformity of the structure models is substantially improved, as
all models are generated using the same pipeline and validated against the same
targets. Both overall model quality and model uniformity have made considerable
steps forward over the course of PDB-REDO development.
7.1.2.1 First Uniformity
The first version of the PDB-REDO databank contained optimized coordinates of the
structure models as well as the model parameters used in refinement for structures
with a resolution of 2.70 Å or better [15]. R-free was used as a model quality indica￾tor and the quality of the model coordinates was verified using WHAT_CHECK [8].
An important aspect of the process wasthat PDB-REDO optimized in a uniform way
the relative weight of the experimental data and the so-called “geometric restraints.”
The latter consists of a priori expectations of the covalent geometry of amino acids
and other chemical moieties that are found in macromolecular structures and in
molecular simulations terminology can be thought of as a basic “force field.” At
least at that time, finding the optimal weight between these two factors, “experi￾ment” and “geometry,” has been often up to each user of each software package.
Crucially, PDB-REDO was not only choosing the software package for optimization,
but was also proposing an objective algorithm for determining this weighting factor.
A key in the re-refinement process that was done for each entry was the uniform
use of translation, liberation, and screw (TLS) displacement models [16] during the
refinement [17]. The TLS models work on groups of atoms that behave as rigid bod￾ies and provide a layer of information to the atomic displacement parameters. These
parameters describe anisotropic movement by adding only 20 model parameters per
group and without changing the characteristics of the input PDB entry in terms of
e.g. ligands, rotamers, and amino acids. This was then followed by general model
refinement that finetuned the atomic positions and B-factors. Although the structure
models improved in terms of fit to the X-ray and to other model quality indicators,
more gross modeling errors (e.g. side chains out of density) were not handled in this
first version of the PDB-REDO databank. Manual inspection and adjustments were
still required to resolve these errors [18].
7.1.2.2 Automatic Rebuilding of Protein Backbone and Side Chains
In further development of PDB-REDO, the programs pepflip and SideAide were
adapted from the ARP/wARP package [19] and implemented in the pipeline [20].
These two were the first fully automated tools to systematically check, correct, and
improve the protein with respect to the electron density maps if the electron density
mapsindicate that thisis needed. Asthe name implies, pepflip systematically checks
for all peptide planes (i.e. the planes consisting of the Cαi
, Ci
, Oi
, Ni+1, and Cαi+1
backbone atoms) outside the cores of α-helices and β-strands whether alternative,
flipped orientations improve the fit to the electron density as well as the position of
the two involved residues on the Ramachandran plot. If so, the adjustment is kept,
as it is considered to be an improvement of the model. SideAide was implemented
to optimize amino acid side chain conformations. This tool searches for the rotamer
conformation of a side chain that shows the best fit to the electron density map.204 7 PDB-REDO in Computational-Aided Drug Design (CADD)
During this process, the correctly modeled parts of the structure model are kept
rigid,so that no interference occurs. Furthermore, the Cα atoms are allowed to shift,
increasing the sampled search space and thus the detection rate. The best rotamer is
selected for each amino acid, after which refinement of the structure model against
the electron density map is performed. Subsequent validation indicates whether
the change in rotamer have indeed improved the structure [20]. Additionally, side
chains of histidine, glutamine, and asparagine are flipped if this improves the local
hydrogen bonding network.
It should be noted that PDB-REDO by default completes missing side chains in
structure models even when the electron density is relatively poor. Although other
methods of dealing with poor side chain density are also used by crystallographers
(e.g. side chain truncation or manipulation of the occupancy of side chain atoms),
the completion of side chains in the most plausible conformation has the advan￾tage that interpretation is still possible even without having the complete structural
model. The positional uncertainty of the added side chain atoms is, to a large extent,
captured in the atomic B-factors.
7.1.2.3 Automated Model Completion Approaches
The addition of missing side-chains was a first step toward making structure
models more complete. In further PDB-REDO development, Loopwhole was
added to complete loops in protein models. When Loopwhole detects an unmod￾eled loop in the protein model (based on the deposited sequence), it looks for
homologs of the protein that do contain a modeled loop at that position in the
protein. If “homologous loops” are found, they are transferred to the structure
model of interest by local structural alignment. After real-space optimization,
the loop with the best fit to the electron density is retained when it is of suf￾ficient quality in terms of geometry and fit to the density map [21]. Besides
auto-completion of the protein part of structures, PDB-REDO also works on
carbohydrates from N-glycosylation. Carbohydrates are often added to proteins
as post-translational modifications and are important recognition parameters in
several biological processes (e.g. protein folding). Modeling of the carbohydrates
in protein structure models is often done relatively poorly [22, 23] because it
has received little attention in the past, and interactive tools for handling car￾bohydrates were not well-developed (that is, handling polysaccharides required
expertise far beyond normal use of the software available) and also because the
task contains particular challenges. The experimental data are commonly less
informative for carbohydrates than for protein and the tools for model building
of carbohydrates are not as well established as those for proteins. Additionally,
many carbohydrates present in structure models are often not the research inter￾est of the depositor [24]. Carbivore was written and added to the PDB-REDO
pipeline to overcome these challenges by automating the extension of existing
carbohydrate trees [25] using, at that time, newly introduced functionality in the
popular model-building software COOT [26, 27]. Carbivore is also able to build
new trees at asparagine residues that are part of the so-called N-glycosylation
sequon Asn-X-Ser/Thr [28]. Additionally, carbohydrates that do not fit any known7.1 History and Concepts 205
glycosylation tree added in vivo, are deleted from the protein structure model
and rebuilt.
7.1.2.4 Systematic Integration of Structural Knowledge
Besides the use of homologous proteins to complete loops in a protein, homolog
structures are also used as an additionalsource of geometric restraintsforthe refine￾ment of models with low-resolution experimental data [29]. Thisinformation is cap￾tured by comparing hydrogen bonds in the structure model to equivalent hydrogen
bondsin close homologs(70%sequence identity or better). The mean hydrogen bond
length in the homologsis used to set a distance restraint between the hydrogen bond￾ing partnersin the model. The standard deviation is used to set the relative weight of
the restraints so that low standard deviations resulting from strong structural con￾servation and impose tight restrains, while large standard deviations cause loose
restraints. The use of such restraints improves the geometric quality of the struc￾ture models [29]. Additionally, the use of such homology-based restraints increases
the consistency of structural homologs, unless there is strong signal in the exper￾imental data for structural differences. This makes it easier for users to assess the
structural effect of moving a protein from one functional state to another, e.g. by
binding different ligands.
The addition of new structural knowledge when refining structure models in
PDB-REDO is not limited to proteins. Other specialized restraints are added for
structural zinc binding sites [30] and for base pairs in nucleic acid structures [31].
7.1.2.5 Overview of PDB-REDO Pipeline
The input for the PDB-REDO pipeline (Figure 7.2) is an atomic coordinate file, the
experimental data file, and the sequence. The pipeline checks if all required data
are provided and determines various parameters that are used for the refinement
with REFMAC [2]. Next, several parallel refinements of the structure model are
executed with different combinations of parameters, and the best parameters for
refinement are chosen. Then, the new model and electron density map are used for
structure rebuilding with the tools we described above. The rebuilt model is refined
once more, while fine-tuning the parameters from the previous round to obtain the
final structure, i.e. the PDB-REDO model. This model is validated on overall struc￾ture parameters, e.g. R-free and Ramachandran Z-score. Nucleic acids are validated
against their specific parameters and ligands are validated separately as well. The
parameters, tools and software, the PDB-REDO model, maps, and validation data
are all saved in the PDB-REDO databank for existing PDB entries. As a result of the

PDB-REDO pipeline, more accurate descriptions of the structure models supported
by the experimentally obtained electron density are obtained.
In order to optimize structure models in an effective and efficient manner,
all the steps in PDB-REDO are fully automated. The tools in the PDB-REDO
pipeline that enable the functionalities described above are tied together with many
decision-making algorithms that together form a so-called “expert system,” i.e. a
framework that tries to mimic what a human expert would do [32]. Of course, the
complexity of this system comes at a price in terms of speed and therefore many
steps use parallel computing. As a result, a typical PDB-REDO calculation takes less
than 30 minutes on a modern workstation whereas any manual approach might
cost hours or even days.
7.2 Structure Improvements by PDB-REDO
To showcase the benefits of using PDB-REDO models, thissection discusses specific
examples that illustrate how updated macromolecular structure models can change
the biological interpretation of a structure model. These cases are, therefore, inter￾esting examples of the benefits that PDB-REDO can bring to CADD projects.
7.2.1 Parametrization and Rebuilding Effects on Small Molecule
Ligands
Many macromolecular structures contain (small molecule) ligands, (metal) ions,
or cofactors that are involved in protein function or structural integrity. Also,
small molecules can be used to modulate the protein’s function or to mediate
protein–protein interactions. Such compounds are found in X-ray structure
models and are treated distinctly during parameterization and refinement in
the PDB-REDO pipeline [33]. Here, we illustrate how the specific and uniform
treatment of such compounds, as well as the possible consequences of rebuilding in
their proximity, can affect biochemical conclusions and thus CADD projects.
7.2.1.1 Re-refinement Improves Ligand Conformation
Type IIA DNA topoisomerases are ATP-dependent enzymes involved in cell growth
and division by changing the coiling of DNA helices. These enzymes are the
targets for antibiotics and antitumor agents. To obtain structural insights into
the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis that is coupled to the topoisomerase function,
the crystal structure of the human type IIA DNA topoisomerase was determined
with AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, and with ADP [34]. The authors
describe conformational differences of the ribose groups in AMP-PNP and ADP
leading to differences in interactions with the protein, notably through hydrogen
bonding. However, re-refinement of both structure models in PDB-REDO leads
to conformational changes in the nucleotide, particularly in the ribose of ADP
(Figure 7.3). The PDB-REDO procedure removed most of the differences in the
ribose conformations and resulted to highly similar binding modes for ADP and7.2 Structure Improvements by PDB-REDO 207

show the importance of proper refinement parameterization as used in PDB-REDO.
7.2.1.2 Side Chain Rebuilding Improves Ligand Binding Sites
Glycogen synthase-2 is involved in the biosynthesis of glycogen, which is one of
the most important energy sources in eukaryotes. The basal state of this enzyme
in complex with UDP was crystallized, which provided new structural insights
into the activation of glycogen synthase-2 [36]. Inspection of the binding site
in the PDB-deposited model shows that the uridine base is held in place by a208 7 PDB-REDO in Computational-Aided Drug Design (CADD)

hydrogen bond to the protein backbone and π–π interactions with Tyr492. The
side-chain rebuilding in PDB-REDO has moved the side-chain of Phe480 such that
its contribution to UDP binding is also apparent. It has additional π–π interactions
with UDP causing the base to be sandwiched between the aromatic side-chains
(Figure 7.4). The change in π–π interactions for UDP is recorded in the ligand
validation data of PDB-REDO (3o3c_ligval.json (see Section 7.3.1 for downloading
details)). In chain A of the protein, the number of π–π interactions increased from
3 to 6, with a π–π strength improvement of 0.69 (2.75 in the PDB model, 3.44 in
the PDB-REDO model) as measured from the knowledge-based potential used
in YASARA [37].
Besides changing the rotamers of amino acid side chains, PDB-REDO also com￾pletes residues in which the side-chains were left unmodeled. This is illustrated by
the binding site of BRAF V600E mutant co-crystallized with vem-bisamide. This
kinase is an oncoprotein in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathway that isfound mutated in several forms of cancer. In melanoma for instance,
the V600E pathogenic mutant is observed regularly and is often targeted in drug dis￾covery. Vemurafenib is one of the compounds that resulted from such studies but
can lead to so-called transactivation of wild-type BRAF. By chemical linkage of two
vemurafenib molecules, vem-bisamide was developed to overcome this transactiva￾tion by forcing BRAF into an inactive dimeric conformation. One of the key residues
in potency of inhibitors based on linked vemurafenib-moieties is Gln461 [38]. The
interaction with this residue is nicely modeled in chain A of the crystal structure of
BRAF-V600E in complex with vem-bisamide. However, in chain B the side-chain of
Gln461 is not modeled, hiding a key protein–ligand interaction (Figure 7.5). In the
PDB-REDO model, thisresidue Gln461 has been completed and the interaction with
the ligand is made obvious (Figure 7.5).

belongs to class I aldolases, which are involved in maintaining bacterial expression
of specific genes by catalyzing the formation or cleavage of C–C bonds [39]. The
HSSP multiple sequence alignment [40] of LsrF shows that the binding pocket is
highly conserved with His58 fully conserved among species. Therefore, it is most
likely that this histidine is involved in binding of R5P. However, in the crystal
structure of the autoinducer-2 as deposited in the PDB, His58 does not form any
specific interaction with the ligand (Figure 7.6). As a result of the hydrogen bond
optimization module in PDB-REDO, this histidine residue has been flipped to form

the PDB-REDO parameterization improves the overall ligand conformational
fit to the density of the R5P ligand. Notably, the parameterization used in the
refinement made the B-factor of atoms in R5P more similar to the surrounding
protein atoms. This has resulted in negative difference density indicating that the
ribose-5-phosphate binding site is only partially occupied.
Although PDB-REDO can improve ligand binding sites and ligand geometry auto￾matically, it cannot reinterpret the ligand to the level of providing an alternative
compound. However, De Souza and co-workersshowed that PDB-REDO models are
a suitable starting point for manual reinterpretation of ligands [41].
7.2.2 Building of Protein Loops and Ligands into Protein Structure
Models
Loops are the more flexible parts of a protein and tend to give weaker diffraction
in crystallographic experiments. This results in poorer local quality of electron den￾sity maps and therefore loops are harder to model than other secondary structure
elements such as α-helices and β-sheets. Incomplete protein structure models are
deposited to the PDB, mostly for good reasons: when the experimental data do not
support the modeling of explicit atoms, those should not be added to the model.
However, the decision not to model a loop is invariably a personal one, and some
unmodeled loops can be built with reasonable reliability into poor electron density if
some prerequisites are met. PDB-REDO triesto solve thisissue in two ways. First, the
refinement steps in PDB-REDO typically lead to an improved atomic model, which
in turn leads to better electron density maps than previously available. Second, the
program Loopwhole reduces the vast number of possible loop conformations to the
ones observed in experimental structures of the same or closely related proteins,
which have a high probability of being correct. Combining both techniques allows
PDB-REDO to add thousands of previously missing loops to PDB models. These
more complete models can then enrich downstream functional or mechanistic inter￾pretations of protein structure. Eventually, this could lead to a better description of
potential binding sites to be targeted in drug discovery [21].
7.2.2.1 Loop Building Completes a Binding Site Region
In the crystal structure of galactokinase from Pyrococcus furiosus, PDB-REDO
builds a substantial part of a loop surrounding the ADP binding site. While this
structure was obtained in complex with ADP, magnesium, and galactose [42],
the surroundings of the ADP binding site in the model as deposited in the PDB
were left unmodeled. There is, however, density observed for this region of the
protein (Figure 7.7). The automatic loop-building algorithm in the PDB-REDO
pipeline improved this part of the protein structure by building the missing loop
(residues 48–72) (Figure 7.7) with a good fit to the experimental data. Although
new interactions between the built residues with ADP are not observed in the
PDB-REDO model, the description of the protein is more complete, which is
relevant for structure-based CADD.7.2 Structure Improvements by PDB-REDO 211

Loop rebuilding in PDB-REDO can improve binding sites asshowcased for the mag￾nesium binding site of the geranyl diphosphate methyltransferase in complex with
geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and sinefungin. This protein was used to provide insights
in the methyl-group transfer mechanism, which is a common regulatory process in
living organisms [43]. In the original model, magnesium interacts with the phos￾phate groups of GPP and with Glu89. However, the magnesium ion lacks an addi￾tional coordination ligand (Figure 7.8). This missing interaction could be explained
by the unmodeled residues Val44 and Asn45, which are located in the magnesium

binding site. The PDB-REDO loop building adds the two missing residues, lead￾ing to a proper magnesium binding site. In addition to the interactions with Glu89
and the phosphates of GPP, the magnesium atom is now also coordinated to Asn45
(Figure 7.8).
7.2.2.3 Building new Compounds into Density
The cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes (CYPs) are important in
post-polyketide modifications and thereby cause molecular diversity during
metabolism. Insights into the mechanism of the CYP450 proteins provide valuable
information for drug design, given the involvement of such enzymes in many
metabolic processes, both physiological and xenobiotic [44]. Filipin is often used
as probe for cholesterol binding sites in studies regarding this enzyme. One of
such CYP450-filipin complex obtained by X-ray crystallography is the model
of CYP105P1. Besides filipin, the structure also contains SO4 ions and glycerol
molecules that were used during the crystallization process [45]. When inspecting
the model of this structure as deposited in the PDB, some well-defined density
regions have no atoms modeled. Although this is not a feature that is employed by
default, PDB-REDO can build missing compounds if provided a list of candidates.
In the case of the CYP450-filipin complex, glycerol molecules and SO4 were fitted
(data not shown). Furthermore, one of the modeled water networks in the original
structure (Figure 7.9) indicates that it might be replaced by a different compound
present in the crystal and was indeed replaced by this compound in the PDB-REDO
model (Figure 7.9).
These results show that, provided the input model has machine-readable meta￾data that describes other possible compounds, a model can be made more complete
by automatically fitting compounds into the density. This becomes particularly
important if a compound directly influences the binding pose of a ligand of interest.
An example of this issue was described by Dym et al. [46], who showed that
binding position of methylene blue in acetylcholinesterase was shifted outward by
a poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) molecule sitting at the bottom of the binding pocket.
This effect was overlooked in an early experimental structure model because the

PEG was not fitted in the electron density, which caused conflicting results in
downstream structural analyses.
Although crystallization additives and a buffer were used as examples, this
approach can be used for ligands and fragments in experimental high-throughput
(lead) drug discovery. This is available as a feature in the PDB-REDO software,
which is currently being tested in real-life experimental settings.
7.2.3 Nucleic Acid Improvements by PDB-REDO
PDB-REDO also applies nucleic acid restraints and validation targets for nucleic
acid-containing structure models. These parameters are limited to the most com￾mon structural features: Watson–Crick base pairs [31]. Overall nucleic acids are
improved in both protein–nucleic acid complexes, as well as (mostly) nucleic acid
structures such as ribosomal subunits. One of the first ribosomal structures that
were deposited in the PDB is the 30S subunit that was used to study its interactions
with antibiotics [47]. The antibiotic paromomycin is bound in such a way that it
is surrounded by nucleotides, among which is G1494 (Figure 7.10). PDB-REDO
restraints improve the orientation of this C–G base pair without changing the
interactions of the nucleic acid structure with the ligand (Figure 7.10). The ZbgG,
a metric describing the relative orientation of the bases, is 3.63 in PDB and 2.04
in PDB-REDO, which is closer to an “ideal” C–G base pair with ZbpG =0.0.
The strongest contribution to this improvement comes from reduced shearing
between the bases. Additionally, the negative difference density on the ligand has
disappeared.

7.2.4 Glycoprotein Structure Model Rebuilding
Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification of proteins. The modi￾fications are important in recognition of other proteins, stability, and formation of
protein complexes [48]. In PDB models, the glycosylated parts of proteins are not
always resolved properly, which indicates that there is sufficient room for model
improvement. Initially, PDB-REDO worked on carbohydrates by improving model
annotation and thereby helping model refinement to improve the atomic coordi￾nates [49], but much more substantial improvements were achieved when auto￾mated (re)building of N-glycans wasintroduced [25]. The latterisillustrated through
the crystal structure of the binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike, which contains a
glycosylated Asn53 [50]. However, the electron density map suggests that the gly￾can tree can be extended (Figure 7.11). The PDB-REDO model indeed contains an
additional NAG (Figure 7.11).
7.2.5 Metal Binding Sites
Description of metal binding sites is challenging in X-ray modeling software, espe￾cially at low resolution. The fact that metal binding sites have an enormous vari￾ety in geometries and possible interactors is one of the underlying causes. Many
site geometries are too context-sensitive to reliably predict and restrain in model
refinement, but there are common structural motifs around e.g. zinc, magnesium,
and sodium, that are amenable to automated model improvement. The PDB-REDO
pipeline includes a tool (platonyzer) that defines geometric restraints for structural
zinc sites (i.e. ZnCysxHisy sites as found in zinc fingers and other motifs) and octa￾hedral sodium and magnesium sites. The restraints impose regular geometry dur￾ing refinement, especially when the experimental data are weak. These restraints
can even recover the right configuration of initially extremely poorly modeled zinc
atoms[30]. The latterisreasonably often present in proteinsthat are targeted in drug

discovery research. One such protein is the aspartate transcarbamoylase found in
E. Coli [51], which in humans is an interesting drug target for malaria [52] and can￾cer [53]. The four cysteine side chains that are supposedly ligands for a zinc atom
are apparently not, but instead, form an irrelevant “trisulfide” bond in the struc￾ture as deposited in the PDB (Figure 7.12). Platonyzer detects that this zinc binding
site is not chemically correct, and generates restraints that will remodel the site dur￾ing refinement. In this process, the model annotation describing incorrect disulfide
bridges is removed. As a result, the zinc atom in the transcarbamoylase has the
four cysteine side chains as ligands and thereby shows a correct coordination state
(Figure 7.12). Additionally, the fit to the electron density maps has improved and
both the positive and negative difference density disappeared.

Besides structural zinc sites, platonyzer also evaluates magnesium and sodium
binding sites with six-fold coordination. If these sites form (distorted) octahedrons,
angle restraints are generated to clean up the site in refinement. Revisiting the DNA
topoisomerase described in Section 2.1.1/Figure 7.3, but focusing on the magne￾sium site, which incorporatesthe ADP. The magnesium is coordinated to ADP phos￾phate groups (ADP O3B at 2.09 Å and ADP O2A at 2.01 Å), Asn91 OD1 at 2.01 Å,
and two water molecules (H2O 902 at 2.03 Å and H2O 958 at 2.24 Å). The sixth lig￾and, H2O 960, is improbably far away at 2.87 Å (Figure 7.12). In the PDB-REDO
model, this water moves closer to the magnesium (1.99 Å), which makes the site
more chemically realistic (Figure 7.12). This example illustrates the advantages of
the PDB-REDO pipeline comprehensiveness: because both the ADP binding site and
the magnesium coordination are improved, the user gets a clearer perspective on the
structure–function relationship of DNA topoisomerase.
The identification of metal binding sites and metals is still a work in progress.
Especially for sodium and magnesium whose binding sites are hard to distinguish
in X-ray diffraction data as these ions have the same number of electrons. The
coordination distances can help, if not directly used as restraints in refinement. The
octahedral restraints from platonyzer help to unbias coordination distances, but
the PDB-REDO pipeline does not change modeled ion identities yet. The decision
about the ion identity thus still lies with the user.
Overall, there is a lot of room for improvement in the refinement of metal
binding sites, and using metal validation tools such as CheckMyMetal [54] and
MetalPDB [55, 56] is strongly recommended. Nevertheless, the way the PDB-REDO
pipeline takes care of (transition) metal atoms, can provide better structural starting
points for CADD projects.
7.2.6 Limitations of the PDB-REDO Databank
In the examples above, we discussed different structural aspects that are addressed
by the very efficient PDB-REDO pipeline, which can have a substantial impact
on the total structure model. Nevertheless, the PDB-REDO comes with some
limitations. The automation of the decision-making pipeline is a “means to an
end” but it is not the solution to all problems. No systematic manual curation is
performed, which means that not all model errors are removed and new errors
may be introduced by PDB-REDO. The software is designed to be conservative
and to make only few mistakes, but with more than 150,000 structure models with
tens of millions of residues in total, problems are unavoidable. The metadata of
each PDB-REDO entry is designed to allow users to make an informed choice on
which models are most suitable for their downstream studies. For detailed studies
involving a few structure models, we recommend that users inspect the models
carefully in the context of the provided electron density maps. For large-scale
studies, filtering models by overall quality indicators such as R-factors and possibly
local density fit metrics such as RSCC is important to construct the most suitable
dataset [57].7.2 Structure Improvements by PDB-REDO 217
Apart from the general problems linked to automation, there are few issues that
need to be addressed separately. Firstly, some are regarding model annotation.
PDB entries carry a lot of information that affects the way they are dealt with in
PDB-REDO. Examples are descriptions of which (macromolecular) compounds
were crystallized, which parts are modeled, residue and atom nomenclature,
alternate conformers, R-factors, space groups, data quality indicators, et cetera.
When these annotations are severely incorrect, the PDB-REDO process will
either fail completely or will give very poor results. During PDB-REDO databank
maintenance, errors like these are analyzed and if they can be solved by model rean￾notation, update requests are sent to wwPDB annotators. This process developed
into a fruitful collaboration with the wwPDB by which many small and large issues
in structure models have been solved at the source (i.e. the PDB) so that everyone,
not just PDB-REDO users, can benefit.
A second issue isthat not only new macromolecularstructures but also new small
molecule compounds are added to the PDB every week. Refinement of such com￾pounds requires restraint targets that are not immediately available in the CCP4
monomer library [58], which is the key restraint source of the PDB-REDO pipeline.
In such cases, restraints are generated “on the fly” based on the current atomic coor￾dinates. This can lead to suboptimal restraints, which in turn lead to suboptimal
molecular geometries. We collaborate with CCP4 developers to regularly update the
CCP4 monomer library so that improved restraints become available to PDB-REDO
users [59]. When users notice compounds with poor geometry in the PDB-REDO
databank, brought on by poor restraints, they can request an update of the affected
entry by clicking a link on the PDB-REDO entry page. Alternatively, they are wel￾come to contact the PDB-REDO developers directly.
A third issue that combines the problems of model annotation and geometric
restraints is related to intermolecular linkages. Although the polymeric linkages
between amino acids, nucleotides, and recently also saccharides [60] are well
standardized by model annotation at the wwPDB and in the CCP4 monomer library
[59], covalent bonds between ligands and the macromolecule are still a significant
challenge. Generating the correct geometric restraints requires more information
than is currently stored in structure model files. Currently, only which atoms are
bound is stored, but not how they are bound. Changes in chemistry of the parent
compounds, i.e. deleted atoms, changes in atom hybridization, and changes in
bond orders, are not stored. This makes it challenging to generate correct restraints
for covalent linkages without manual intervention [61]. Unfortunately, this phe￾nomenon can be observed in some PDB-REDO entries and therefore users are
advised to be vigilant when dealing with structure models that have such covalent
linkages. Improvements to the standard data model used for macromolecules, the
mmCIF format [62], are required to solve this issue permanently.
A final issue of note is technical. Due to the many practical limitations of the PDB
file, this most commonly used data format for structure models, is being replaced
by mmCIF. Most notably the size restrictions for models (99,999 atoms in one file,
with 62 chains) and the limited extensibility to capture new metadata have led to
this replacement. The mmCIF file format does not have these limitations and has218 7 PDB-REDO in Computational-Aided Drug Design (CADD)
been therefore chosen as the current standard for model handling in the PDB [63].
At the same time, the legacy of structural biology software, including software for
CADD does not (fully) support the mmCIF format yet. This is also true for some of
the software in the PDB-REDO pipeline. This means that even though PDB-REDO
can use mmCIF formatted files asinput and output, models are still described in PDB
format within the pipeline. Because of this, 400 very large structure models could not
be processed and are currently missing from the PDB-REDO databank. These will be
added once all the software in the PDB-REDO pipeline becomes mmCIF compliant.
7.3 Access the PDB-REDO Databank and Metadata
7.3.1 Downloading and Inspecting Individual PDB-REDO Entries
All the models that are parsed through the PDB-REDO pipeline are stored in a data￾bank that can be accessed at https://pdb-redo.eu/. The whole databank can be down￾loaded, but conveniently it is also possible to download a single entry. The latter can
be done either through the website, or users can open the desired structure model
directly in molecular graphics software YASARA [37], COOT [26], or CCP4mg [35].
These software packages have the utility to download and show the PDB-REDO
model and corresponding density maps from their interface [64].
When using the PDB-REDO website, an entry page visualizing the metadata of
the structure model is provided. An example for PDB entry 1lf2 [65] is shown in
Figure 7.13. On top of the entry page, a table (Figure 7.13) provides crystallographic
data such as space group, resolution, and R-factor of the structure model. Also, the
links to download the PDB-REDO data for the structure are provided in this table.
An additional table (Figure 7.13) containing metrics about the validation of the
crystallographic refinement and model quality is provided. This table also indicates
significant improvements or deteriorations of the PDB-REDO model compared
to the model as deposited in the PDB, conveniently marked in green or red,
respectively. Next, a Kleywegt-like plot is provided (Figure 7.13), showing changes
in model geometry before and after PDB-REDO in terms of ϕ- and ψ-angles.
The Ramachandran Z-scores are provided for both the PDB and PDB-REDO
models, as well as details regarding residues in the preferred regions, allowed
regions and outliers. In the subsequent panel (Figure 7.13) boxplots comparing
the Z-score of the Ramachandran plot for both the PDB and PDB-REDO model
with at least 1000 other structures that were obtained at similar resolutions are
shown. This comparison is also provided for R-free and the rotamer quality as box
plots. Additionally, a table (Figure 7.13) containing the significant model changes
caused by PDB-REDO is provided. This table provides the counts of these changes,
among which the number of rotamers changed, the number of side chains that
were flipped, chiralities that were fixed, and also the improvement or deterioration
of fit to the density. When a PDB-REDO entry is loaded into COOT, a button list is
provided to users to quickly inspect all the changes in the structure model in 3D.7.3 Access the PDB-REDO Databank and Metadata 219

7.3.2 Data Available in PDB-REDO Entries
A PDB-REDO entry comes with the new model coordinates, maps, and validation
details, but also contains all the metadata that describes the model in the original
state, the re-refined model, and the final (rebuilt and re-refined) model. All files
available for one entry are shown in Table 7.1. This data are uniform throughout the
whole databank, asthe same pipeline has been used to generate all entries. Addition￾ally, the data are formatted in findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible
(FAIR) file formats. Both these features are advantages of the PDB-REDO databank.
A PDB-REDO entry contains files with the atomic coordinates for both the origi￾nal model (as deposited in the PDB) and the PDB-REDO model. In addition to the
PDB format for describing atomic coordinates, PDB-REDO also provides mmCIF
coordinate files of the “redone” structure model. Additionally, the electron density
maps for both the original and the redone structure models are provided. Valida￾tion data are available for both structure models. The WHAT_CHECK reports [8]
provide comprehensive model validation data and the JSON files contain valid data
for the macromolecular structure model that can be easily used in data mining for
structure selection. If ligands are present in the entry, a ligand validation file is pro￾vided that contains the validation metrics for each ligand in both the original and
the PDB-REDO structure models. If homologous structure models are available, the
PDB identifiers and chain identifiers of the homologs are reported in the available_
homologs.json file. Furthermore, a Define Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP)
analysis of the PDB-REDO model is provided [40, 66] as well as a separate file con￾taining the model change scores that are used at the PDBe entry pages [67]. For
convenient visualization of a PDB-REDO structure model, a COOT [26]script is pro￾vided, which also indicates the model changes made by the PDB-REDO pipeline.
Finally, a PDB-REDO entry comes with some descriptive data of the PDB-REDO
parameters (data.json) and, for the sake of provenance tracking, versions of all the
software used during the process (versions.json).
7.3.3 Usage of the Uniform and FAIR Validation Data
Uniform data are an advantage for selecting multiple models for a CADD project,
e.g. for homology modeling or investigation of a protein family. The models are all
generated with the same pipeline and parameters can easily be extracted from the
(meta)data provided. The JSON format respects FAIR data requirements. For each
JSON formatted file, the corresponding schema is provided on the PDB-REDO web￾site, which includes detailed information about the descriptors. The filesthemselves
are user-friendly regarding data analyses. Desired values are easily extracted, after
which analyses such as calculating differences or sorting data can be performed
using any computer scripting language. For example, one could extract the number
of cation–π interactions for all ligands found in the PDB-REDO databank. In the lig￾val.json file, these counts are stored for each ligand in the model as deposited in the
PDB and forthe corresponding PDB-REDO model. Once the valuesfor a PDB-ligand
and PDB-REDO ligand are compared, the difference between the two values canTable 7.1 All data files for a PDB-REDO entry.

be calculated and sorted in descending order to rank the ligands based on gained
cation–π interactions. One of the ligands on top of this list is the AO8 ligand of the
protein kinase A catalytic subunit from Criteculus griseus (PDB-ID 5otg). Thisligand
binds in the ATP binding site of the kinase, most likely to inhibit its function [68].
The AO8 ligand shows no cation–π interactions in the original model (Figure 7.14),
whereas in the PDB-REDO model 7, such interactions are reported. This increase
is due to the completed Arg22 side chain that is present in the binding pocket. The
guanidinium cation is interacting with the π–electrons in the phenyl moiety of the
ligand improving the binding mode with an interaction between protein and lig￾and (Figure 7.14) that was overlooked. For the sake of completeness, note that, the
boronic acid of AO8 is not visible in the electron density. As boronic acids are known
to be oxidatively unstable, most likely oxidation occurred during the experimental
process [69].
7.3.4 Creating Datasets from the PDB-REDO Databank
Next to listing close homologs, PDB-REDO has a more in-depth way of creating
datasets for CADD and method development for structural biology. At https://pdb￾redo.eu/archive users can search the PDB-REDO databank based on all the model
descriptors, validation scores, and crystallographic parameters stored in the data￾bank, via program and property filters. The versions of all the programs used are also
documented and stored to make a specific entry searchable. Complex queries can be
built to perform successive filtering steps on the data. The final result can be down￾loaded as JSON file describing the dataset. To facilitate reproducible research, the
description includes a persistent, version-specific identifier for each model so that
even when a PDB-REDO model is updated (e.g. because of an algorithmic improve￾ment) the exact model used in the study is referenced. Old versions of PDB-REDO
databank entries are now archived to allow long-term access.7.4 Conclusions 223
7.3.5 Submitting Structure Models to the PDB-REDO Pipeline
Besides the PDB-REDO databank, the PDB-REDO server is available, and also
accessible through https://pdb-redo.eu/ [64]. The server provides the user with
the ability to request an update for an existing PDB entry, or to upload their
own structure model and diffraction data to the PDB-REDO pipeline. The server
returns a new structure model with rebuilt parts, electron density maps, optimized
refinement parameters, models-specific restraints, and a wealth of validation data.
7.4 Conclusions
The PDB-REDO databank contains optimized PDB entries that were obtained from
X-ray crystallography. The underlying PDB-REDO pipeline refines, rebuilds, and
validates the PDB models based on the original experimental data and returns the
optimized structure models. PDB-REDO attemptsto correct modeling errors, includ￾ing the addition of missing side chain atoms, entire protein loops, or missing sugars
in glycosylation sites. Besides model changes, a significant advantage of PDB-REDO
entries is that they are uniformly treated. This is in sharp contrast to their counter￾part entries in the PDB archive, which all reflect the idiosyncrasies of the software
and the crystallographers that constructed them. Importantly, metadata and refine￾ment, and validation parameters are provided for all entries, in FAIR data formats.
Also, secondary structure information (DSSP analysis), ligand validation, and avail￾able homologousstructures are provided. Eitherthe entire databank or a single entry
can be downloaded from https://pdb-redo.eu/. Single entries can also be directly
opened in COOT, YASARA, or CCP4mg software packages.
Therefore, the PDB-REDO databank is a convenient starting point for structure
selection in a CADD research project. For example, one of the key residues mutated
in various subtypes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, Asp501, is flipped in the
PDB-REDO model compared to the model as deposited in the PDB. This residue is
located in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and the flip results in a
hydrogen bond with Tyr41 in ACE2, spotting the importance of this residue in the
protein complex [70]. Anotherstudy using structures available from the PDB-REDO
databank involved docking in the ligand-binding pocket of β-lactoglobulin. The
PDB-REDO models were selected for this study because of their improved fit to
experimental X-ray data and overall model quality score compared to the models
as deposited in the PDB [71]. Hydrogen bonding between a tryptophan and the
ligand has been characterized in the hydrophobic binding pocket, which can be
helpful in further investigation of this biopolymer involved in the transportation of
hydrophobic nutrients. Similarly, in research describing the conformational flexi￾bility of estrogen receptor α, the PDB-REDO structure of the monomer was selected
as this model has been completed with several side-chains that were not present in
the model as deposited in the PDB [72]. Besides using the models available from the
PDB-REDO databank, the PDB-REDO pipeline can also be used during refinement
and validation of an X-ray structure model as e.g. done by Min et al. and Musak et al.224 7 PDB-REDO in Computational-Aided Drug Design (CADD)
in their works for designing inhibitors of programmed cell death-1/programmed
death-ligand 1 [73] and the estrogen receptor [74], respectively.
Here, we have shown how PDB-REDO can contribute to CADD. At the moment
this is limited to structures from X-ray crystallography, which represent the vast
majority of experimental structure models, particularly those suited as drug targets.
Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) is an increasingly popular method for provid￾ing experimental structure models including those with bound ligands. This opens
new possibilities for drug discovery including CADD. Developing new methods for
Cryo-EM-based drug discovery is an active research field and will be for the foresee￾able future. It is also part of the PDB-REDO research topics.

8.1 Introduction
The current focus of translational and biomedical research tends to be dominated
by a relatively small number of well-studied proteins. According to one estimate,
around 10% of human proteins receive 75% of the focus of research [1]. Another
study reported that at least one-third of the human proteome is understudied, based
on mined information from PubMed or the granted patent corpus, antibody count,
NIH-funded R01 grants, and other criteria [2].
A recent analysis found that much of the reason for this bias can be attributed
to the publication history of a target and the availability of chemical probes for tar￾gets [3]. As such, there is a need to incentivize more diversity in the range of targets
under investigation, such that more novel targets are featured in publications, and
to develop molecular probes (e.g. chemicals or antibodies) and genetic constructs
for them. This process of illumination can have a ripple effect – as more targets are
studied and data are generated, similar understudied targets may receive additional
focus. To address this bias and expand our knowledge of understudied proteins,
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiated the Illuminating the Druggable
Genome (IDG) Consortium [4] in 2013 to shed light on these understudied targets,
oftentimes referred to as the “dark genome.”
In this chapter, we use the term target to generically refer to both the charac￾teristics of the gene and the protein in a drug discovery context: drug targets are
macromolecules to which the drug (or its bioactive derivative) binds to exert the
intended therapeutic effect [5].
As a primary step in guiding research toward understudied targets, the IDG Con￾sortium defined a categorical metric called the Target Development Level (TDL) [6].
Each target protein is classified into one of four categories, which describe the degree

of progress and available knowledge for these targets in terms of their chemistry,
biology, and clinical activity. The four categories and their requirements are:
● Tdark proteins satisfy two or more of the following requirements:
○ A PubMed score [7] less than five
○ Three or fewer documented GeneRIFs (Reference Into Functions)
○ No more than 50 commercially available antibodies[2]
● Tbio proteins satisfy one of the following requirements:
○ Fail to satisfy two or more of the criteria for Tdark
○ Have a documented Gene Ontology Molecular Function or Biological Process
with an experimental evidence code
● Tchem proteins must have:
○ At least one active small molecule documented by ChEMBL [8] or DrugCentral
[9] that must be one of the following measures: IC50, Ki
, Kb, Kd, EC50, AC50,
XC50, and Km. Depending on the target type, the activities must also satisfy the
following potency cutoffs:
◾ GPCRs and nuclear hormone receptors: 100nM
◾ Kinases: 30nM
◾ Ion Channels: 10μM
◾ All others: 1μM
● Tclin proteins must have:
○ A documented activity for an approved drug, with a known mechanism of
action (MoA).
Figure 8.1 shows the yearly distribution of the number of targets at each TDL, and
how the generation of new knowledge has changed the distribution of the TDLs over
time. Specifically, the number of Tdark proteins dramatically decreased from 9199
(December 2013) to 5932 (July 2022), indicating an increased awareness of the dark
genome and the need to further study associated proteins (see also Figure 8.1).
As part of the IDG program, the Target Central Resource Database (TCRD) and
Pharos were created to provide free, public accessto information on targets and asso￾ciated annotations [6, 10]. TCRD, accessible at http://juniper.health.unm.edu/tcrd/
download/, is an aggregating database of 79 data sources and Pharos(https://pharos
.nih.gov/) is the interactive web-based frontend that allows users to browse, search,
filter, and analyze the rich information contained within TCRD. Users can log in
via pre-established social media credentials, such as Google, Twitter, and GitHub,
to save lists of targets, diseases, or ligands that are available upon return. Other
than the ability to save custom lists, all functionalities are available without regis￾tration. Since its first publication, TCRD has had 27 new releases, and Pharos has a
bimonthly release cycle. TCRD has had approximately 22,000 database downloads
as of 31 March 2022. Pharos receives more than 2500 new visitors every month.
TCRD and Pharos are tailored to a broad range of user types, from those that need
full access to the data available to others that may only be interested in a specific
dataset for a select group of targets. Other types of users may generate tools or other
web components that query Pharos’ GraphQL API.8.2 Methods 233

● The last two-digit number indicates the year. An additional category, “Tvoid,” was intro￾duced for this plot to trace target transition for protein identifiers that have been obsoleted
(e.g. pseudogenes) or more recently introduced in UniProt.
While many primary resources within TCRD already have a web portal where the
data can be accessed, there is a clear benefit in database aggregators such as Open￾Targets [11], GeneCards [12], or Pharos. These tools display detailed information
about a target on a single page, allowing a user to learn about different aspects of tar￾get biology at once, a role that is also filled by Pharos’ details pages (Section 8.2.3.2).
In addition, the visualizations and analysisfunctionality offered by Pharos’ list pages
(Section 8.2.3.1) opens up a range of new possibilitiesforresearch questionsthat cap￾italize on the wide breadth of knowledge in the database. The use cases (Section 8.3)
illustrate how generating lists in different ways, performing calculations, and con￾structing visualizations can help address different scientific questions, and reveal
patterns in the data.
This chapter provides details on the methods(data organization, analysis, and pro￾grammatic access), gives an overview of the content and navigation, and exemplifies
the utility and usage of Pharosthrough use cases. Our goal isto highlight and demon￾strate how Pharos empowers users to gain chemical, biological, and clinical insight
on targets, with the ability to analyze and visualize lists of targets, diseases, or lig￾ands, and the ability to generate those lists in interesting and relevant ways.
8.2 Methods
8.2.1 Data Organization
TCRD is a relational database compiled from 79 datasets from various knowledge
domains. Further details about each resource can be found in previous publications234 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets
[6, 10] and on the Pharos About page (https://pharos.nih.gov/about). Those include
eight sources for target–disease associations, three for target–ligand activities,
three for protein–protein interactions, five for pathway annotations, five for protein
expression data, GeneRIFs and publications from NCBI, GO Terms from Gene
Ontology, and more.
This section summarizes our approach to aligning information on targets, dis￾eases, and ligands across these complementary primary resources. In general, these
primary resources use a variety of ontologies describing targets, diseases, ligands,
and associations between them, and so require a systematic approach to align data
from the different sources.
8.2.1.1 Target Alignment
The primary framework for data related to targets comesfrom the “reviewed” (man￾ually curated) human proteins described by UniProt [13]. TCRD maps protein and
gene-related data to this dataset given the target identifiers used by each dataset,
i.e. gene symbols, ENSG IDs, and UniProt IDs, and mapped to the synonyms that
UniProt provides for each target.
8.2.1.2 Disease Alignment
Eight data sources [7, 9, 14–19] provide target–disease associations for TCRD and
use seven different ontologies, including DO, UMLS, MESH, OMIM, Orphanet,
AmyCo, and NCBIGene [20–25]. Pharos relies on the MONDO Disease Ontology
(DO) [18] to align disparate input source types into a common disease anno￾tation. For example, when one source reports an association between APP and
“Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, APP-related (OMIM:605714),” and another source
reports an association between APP and “APP-related cerebral amyloid angiopathy
(DOID:0070028),” Pharos correctly reports those two associations as the same
disease.
Overall, the eight data sources provide data for 26,418 unique disease IDs and
17,989 unique disease names among the set of documented target–disease associ￾ations. By aligning equivalent terms through the MONDO mappings, Pharos has
been able to consolidate data down to 13,704 unique disease entities.
8.2.1.3 Ligand Alignment
Three data sources for activity data on ligands are used, including ChEMBL [8],
DrugCentral [9], and Guide to Pharmacology [26]. Each source could represent a
given ligand using a different SMILES string. To standardize molecules, Pharos uses
Layered Chemical Identifier (LyChI – https://github.com/ncats/lychi), a hierarchi￾cal hash key representation for chemical structures. LyChI is a lexicographically
meaningful four-layered hash key that is generated after standardization of the
chemical structure, which involves valency check, kekulization, tautomerization,
salt/solvent removal, protonation (or deprotonation), followed by perception of
mobile charges and stereochemistry. Briefly, the hash keys are generated from
SMILES, and all activities associated with each ligand across different targets are
grouped based on that unique hash key.8.2 Methods 235
8.2.1.4 Data and UI Updates
TCRD and the Pharos web portal are living resources that are constantly being
updated. TCRD releases occur approximately twice a year. The list of data sources
is constantly changing to meet the research community’s needs and to track new
trends and advances in methods and technologies. New data sources are chosen
based on the quality and utility of the data source, with the focus on data sources
that will help in the project’s main focus, which is to illuminate less well-studied
areas of the proteome. Pharos follows a bimonthly release cycle that incorporates
new changes from TCRD and adds new functionality and analysis methods.
8.2.2 Programmatic Access and Data Download
Pharos queries TCRD using a Node.js server (https://nodejs.org/) running a
GraphQL API (https://graphql.org/). GraphQL is a powerful tool for generating
easily extensible queries that are ideal for hierarchical data. For example, top-level
information about a ligand can be fetched alongside a list of targets for which
the ligand has an activity. The query can easily retrieve further information about
targets, such as affected pathways, protein classes, or associated diseases for those
targets. External developers can use GraphQL to fetch only data they are interested
in, making lighter payloads instead of a traditional REST API where the Pharos
developers would dictate what data are returned from a request.
Users can query our GraphQL API directly through the website (https://pharos
.nih.gov/api) or programmatically (https://pharos-api.ncats.io/graphql). Pharos’
API page has several Example Queries to help get started querying the API.
Beyond querying the API, users can also download data through the UI, or down￾load complete dumps of the SQL database TCRD from http://juniper.health.unm
.edu/tcrd/download/.
The Pharos web application constructs GraphQL queries based on user input. The
web server component is currently written in Angular 13 (https://angular.io/), using
Server Side Rendering and pre-rendering for slow-loading pages. Each details page
and list page provides a link to download data for offline analysis. Users can build a
download query that includes any related data fields, such as Pathways for a target
list or GWAS data for a disease list. The download builder can also help SQL users
of TCRD to understand the table structure of the underlying database, as it presents
the SQL query that will be used to execute the download query. The downloaded zip
file will also contain a metadata file that reviews the version information at the time
of the download, a summary of the downloaded fields, and the SQL query used to
generate the download. Downloads are limited to 250,000 rowsforthisfunctionality.
Users, who need more data, should download a full version of TCRD as described
above.
8.2.3 UI Organization
This section provides a broad overview of the information layout in Pharos without
going into detail about the data and functionality of each component. Many of the236 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets
components and features will be introduced during the course of the use cases that
will follow in Section 8.3. Regardless, each component has a help panel that provides
those details to users as they need them (Figure 8.2 panel L and Figure 8.3 panel D).
There are two main types of pages that contain the bulk of biological data from
TCRD, those being list pages (Section 8.2.3.1), which provide pageable lists of enti￾ties for browsing and population analysis, and details pages (Section 8.2.3.2), which
present detailed data and source information for a single entity. List pages and details
pages are available for all targets, diseases, and ligands in the database.
All Pharos pages contain a top menu with links to the homepage, the main list
pagesfortargets, diseases, and ligands, as well asthe About page, FAQ page, and Use
Case page (Figure 8.2 panel A). Also from the toolbar, users can search the database,
which will be discussed in more detail in Section 8.2.3.3. Rounding out the top menu
are buttons to submit feedback to the Pharos development team and to Sign In via
a number of social authentication providers (e.g. Google and GitHub). Signing into
Pharos is optional, but is useful for users who will be saving their own custom lists
(see section 8.3.2 “Uploading a Custom Ligand List”)since they will be able to return
to Pharos and access those lists later.
8.2.3.1 List Pages
List pages are browsable listings of targets, diseases, or ligands, that can be filtered
by a number of data fields. The example in Figure 8.2 shows a list filtered to include
only the 683 targets that have a TDL of Tclin. List pages can be toggled between
Table View, where results are shown in a table, and List Analysis View, which offers
functionality to show visualizations and perform calculations at the population
level. More details on the functionality provided in the List Analysis tab are shown
in context in Section 8.3.
The filter panel (Figure 8.2 panel E), shows the counts of entries in the list that
have each filter value. Each list page provides the ability to upload a custom list and
download data for all entries currently on the list.
The lower right quadrant, labeled Figure 8.2 panel K, is where the entries of the
list are shown. Target list pages show each entry in a card view, which highlights
some summary data for each target in the list. Disease list pages show a more sim￾plified table of data, while ligand list pages show a card view including the chemical
structure of each compound. The lists are pageable, and each entry will link to a
details page for the entry. A popup information panel will explain the data behind
each data point on the cards.
8.2.3.2 Details Pages
As mentioned above, each entry on the list pages will link to a corresponding details
page. Figure 8.3 shows an example of a target details page. This example page, as well
as all disease and ligand details pages, will have a header that includes the name of
the entry, and a link to download data forthe given entry. The left panel is a clickable
table of contents that highlights, which sections have data and which do not, while
the right panel showsthe primary data in distinct components. All headers and data
labels will show a tooltip on hover that helps the user understand the data and its
context. A popup information panel can also be accessed for this information. There8.2 Methods 237

are many types of data on the details pages, especially the target details components,
and many of them will be explained in more detail in the context of the use cases in
Section 8.3.
8.2.3.3 Search
The search bar from either the top menu or the home page (Figure 8.4), will
auto-complete partial queries with common searches. Users can navigate directly
to matching details pages when the autocompletion match is to that of a name or
common symbol for a target, disease, or ligand. When the autocompletion match
is to that of a common filter value, such as a GO Term or a pathway, an option
will be presented to navigate directly to a listing page filtered to entries that match
that filter value. The bottom of Figure 8.4 shows the result of a general text search,
which occurs when the user does not select an autocompletion match, or selects8.2 Methods 239
Figure 8.4 Search functionality.
● Top: Autocomplete suggestions based on the user’s input will take the user directly to a
details page, or a relevant list page. The user input, in this case, is “acetylcholine” and the
suggestions include the ligand “acetylcholine” and the target “Acetylcholinesterase.”
● Bottom: By selecting the “Search Pharos…” option, the search will be done for the term in
many locations of the database. Matching targets, diseases, and ligands are profiled, as well
as matching text within a variety of filters, such as the PANTHER Class for “acetylcholine
receptor.”240 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets
the “Search Pharos for…” option. That search page provides the results for a search
for the term as a target, disease, or ligand, as well as for any of the filter value fields
that Pharos searches. Selecting one of the Donut Charts on the search result page
will take the user to the respective target, disease, or ligand list page where those
specific matching entries can be investigated.
8.2.3.4 Tutorials
Pharos has several tutorials available for users to become familiar with some of the
tool’s more advanced features. These can be found on the top menu, alongside but￾tonsto accessthe variouslist pages. There is always a “What’s New” tutorial for each
new Pharos release to highlight new features. Tutorials and use case walkthroughs
are made with the shepherd.js framework (https://shepherdjs.dev/).
The Use Cases page, found under the Tutorials Menu, walks the user through the
use of Pharos and illustrates how different functions can be used together to address
a high-level goal. Some of those use cases will form the basis of Section 8.3 of this
chapter.
8.2.4 Analysis Methods Within Pharos
One of the biggest assets within Pharos is the flexibility in searching and analyzing
targets, diseases, and ligands, as well as their interconnectedness.
8.2.4.1 Searching for Ligands
Users can search for ligands based on a starting chemical structure in the TCRD.
Pharos accepts several different input formats, including SMILES, compound
names, ChEMBL ID, and more, by utilizing an ID resolver service. This resolver
service accepts a variety of inputs that are listed here: https://opendata.ncats
.nih.gov/resolver/_options. By selecting the data that we wish to return, we
are able to generate a query to fetch a standardized SMILES string: https://
opendata.ncats.nih.gov/resolver/pt/lychi/smiles/inchikey/smilesParent/unii/cas?
structure=CC1CC(O)(CCN1CCCC(%3DO)C1%3DCC%3DC(F)C%3DC1)C1%3DCC
%3DC(Cl)C%3DC1. This service will then display the two-dimensional (2D) struc￾ture of the matching compound in the integrated MarvinJS widget (version 22.11.1)
from ChemAxon (https://chemaxon.com/). Users can also modify that structure,
load their own structure via a MOL file, or draw a structure from scratch. The
SMILES from the MarvinJS Widget are used as the query for all subsequent struc￾ture searches. Once the query is specified, users can search for matching ligands
in TCRD based on an Apache Lucene-based structure index of all TCRD ligands.
The structure index is based on an internally developed inverted index of chemical
graphs that enables rapid structure searching. The source code for a self-contained
implementation of this structure indexer is available at: https://github.com/ncats/
structure-indexer.
Similarity Search finds ligands that are similar to the query, whereas substructure
search finds all ligands that contain the query as a substructure. In both cases,
the search results are sorted according to Tanimoto coefficient [27] between
ChemAxon’s Chemical Hashed Fingerprints.8.2 Methods 241
8.2.4.2 Finding Targets by Amino Acid Sequence
Targets can be searched based on protein sequence alignment with a query sequence
using the BLAST (blastp) algorithm [28]. Specifically, NCBI’s dockerized BLAST
image (https://github.com/ncbi/docker/tree/master/blast version 2.12) is used to
query the UniProt human protein database [13] using default parameters. Search
results are displayed within Pharos as a target list. A density plot of matching
amino acid residues is constructed for matching targets in the list against the
query sequence. Users can navigate to each matching target to view primary
documentation, utilize the list analysis capabilities of the list pages highlighted in
Section 8.3.1.2 and Section 8.3.2.2, or download data for the target list, including
details of the alignments from blastp [28].
8.2.4.3 Finding Targets with Similar Annotations
The “Find Similar Targets” links generate target list pages consisting of other targets
in TCRD that have overlapping annotations with the target of interest. For example,
for a target with ten associated diseases, the list of similar targets will consist of all
targets that are associated with any of those ten diseases. The sorting of the resulting
list is based on the Tanimoto coefficient calculated between the two sets of associated
diseases. Specifically J(A,B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B| [29].
As such, identical sets of diseases correspond to a Tanimoto coefficient of 1.
Decreasing the overlap between the two sets or increasing the size of either
set will result in a lower Tanimoto coefficient. Compared to itself, the target
of interest will have a Tanimoto coefficient of 1 and be sorted to the top of the
list, followed by other targets with a high degree of overlap in the selected data
field.
8.2.4.4 Finding Targets with Predicted Activity
Starting with a ligand structure, as described in Section 8.2.4.1, users can search
for targets predicted to have an activity similar to that of the query structure. These
results are based on a set of Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) mod￾els provided by NCATS Predictor [30]. See https://predictor.ncats.io/predictor/ for
details or to download datasets and models.
8.2.4.5 Enrichment Scores for Filter Values
When a listing page is showing a filtered list, i.e. not the full list of all targets, dis￾eases, or ligands, it makes sense to calculate enrichment scores for values returned
after filtering. This functionality is featured in the use case in section “Filter Value
Enrichment”.
Enrichment scores are calculated using Fisher’s Exact Test [31]. Significance is
determined according to the adjusted p-value, using the Benjamini–Hochberg pro￾cedure to limit the False Discovery Rate to 𝛼 =0.05 [32], For example, the degree of
overrepresentation for an associated disease in a target list can be calculated to help
users understand whether the count of targets associated with a particular disease
is due to random chance [32].242 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets
8.3 Use Cases
We present these use cases to introduce the reader to some of the many data sources
underlying Pharos, as well as the powerful visualizations and population analysis
tools. These walkthroughs are intended to illustrate how a new Pharos user could
navigate through the tool and accomplish common scientific tasks. The three use
cases center around the three main Pharos entities: targets, ligands, and diseases.
8.3.1 Hypothesizing the Role of a Dark Target
The first step in learning about a dark target would be browsing the details page
for primary documentation (https://pharos.nih.gov/targets/ATP1B4). For dark tar￾gets, information tends to be sparse, and finding ways to expand the search for rel￾evant documentation is one way to generate hypotheses for what the target may be
involved in. When data are sparse, the user can change the line of inquiry from “what
does this target do?” to “what do similar, or related, targets tend to do?”
To exemplify this functionality, we focus on the ATP1B4 target, a dark target that
has very little direct documentation, as will be discussed in Section 8.3.1.1. Unless
mentioned otherwise, screenshots for this use case using data for ATP1B4.
8.3.1.1 Primary Documentation
Components of the target details pages are divided into sections that group com￾ponents into similar types of data. The Descriptive Data section provides basic
information about a given protein and where it is expressed. The section “Behavioral
Data” provides information related to low-level questions about what the protein
binds to, and to what pathways it belongs. The Phenotypic Data section includes
the data from TCRD that addresses the higher-level questions of what cellular
functions it is involved in, and what traits or diseases it has been associated with.
Descriptive Data
The Protein Summary component (Figure 8.3 panel C) presents general information
and descriptions of the target. These descriptions are retrieved from UniProt and
NCBI, as are the many other terms by which a target is known. The Illumination
Graph is a high-level visual representation of the information available for a target
across multiple knowledge domains, as categorized by and quantified by the Har￾monizome Project [33]. For ATP1B4, the user learns from the description that the
target has some ancestral relation to Na,K-ATPase beta-subunits but may no longer
function in that capacity. There are a number of links to external sites for follow-up.
When annotations are available, the Protein Classes (Figure 8.3 panel C bottom)
component includes classifications of a target from PANTHER [34] or Drug Target
Ontology (DTO) [5]. The documented classes in this section are all links that bring
the userto a target list page, consisting of all targetsthatshare that annotation.In this
example, PANTHER has annotated this target as a cation transporter, and following
that link will show all targets that have been deemed to be cation transporters.8.3 Use Cases 243
Figure 8.5 IDG development level summary.
● This component summarizes criteria that led to a given target’s TDL classification.
● The colored TDL is the assigned classification for this target, and the highlighted criteria
are the ones that led to this classification.
Next, users will find the IDG Development Level Summary component (Figure 8.5),
which briefly outlinesthe target’s TDL. This explicitly shows which criteria pass and
fail for the TDL assignment. Interpreting this component, we can see that ATP1B4
satisfies the Tdark criteria by having only three GeneRIFs, and less than 50 antibod￾ies available. It fails the third criterion, having a PubMed score of less than 5, so this
target is actually on the cusp of Tbio.
The Expression Data component is included as Descriptive Data and is aggregated
from four primary data sources and one aggregating data source (Figure 8.6). Two
of the primary datasets provide RNA expression data: GTeX [35] and HPA-RNA [36]
datasets, which provide high throughput measurements ofRNA expression in a wide
variety of tissues. The other two primary datasets provide Protein expression data:
HPA Protein [36], which measures protein expression through antibody labeling,
and HPM Protein [37], which measures protein expression through massspectrome￾try. Lastly, the JensenLab TISSUES resource [38] provides an aggregated view of data
from many sources, including text mining, to provide a third avenue for understand￾ing the expression patterns of targets. Tissues are aggregated based on the UBERON
ontology [39], and details of each tissue and data source can be fetched by interacting
with the heat map, circle plot, or anatomogram.
Continuing the review of primary documentation, the Protein Sequence and
Structure component displays a density plot of amino acid counts in the protein
sequence, as well as an interactive view of sequence and structure information.
This component is built using EBI’s Nightingale Web Components (https://ebi￾webcomponents.github.io/nightingale/#/) [40]. The widget loads and displays all
available structures from PDB [41] and AlphaFold [42, 43], and selecting different
annotated domainsin the sequence viewer will highlight the corresponding residues
on the structure viewer. For our example protein, the user learns that there are no
experimentally determined structures. There is an AlphaFold structure prediction244 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets

that claims high confidence for a large portion of the protein, and moderate/low
confidence for another region.
Behavioral Data
Pharos displays an Approved Drugs component for targets that have appro￾priate drugs and an Active Ligands component where ligands are known
(Figure 8.7 – Example CACNA2D1). These sections differ only in the approval
status of the active compounds. Each component contains a pageable card list of
the active compounds, a summary of the activity, and an image of the chemical
structure. Buttons in these sections allow the user to switch from the target details
page to a ligand list page, which allows the user to browse and analyze the list
of compounds in a filterable list page. For our example dark target, we find no
approved drugs or active ligands, asit has no compound activities above the potency
threshold described in Section 8.1.
Protein–Protein Interactions are aggregated from STRING [44], Reactome [45], and
BioPlex [46] and are shown in a pageable card list (Figure 8.8), showing some rele￾vant features of the interaction. This component also includes a button to show the
list of interacting proteinsin a target list page, which opensthe doorto the same anal￾ysis and visualization options available for all list pages. For our example target, there8.3 Use Cases 245

are 70 targets with documented physical interaction ortext-mined interaction. These
70 targets will be the basis of the target list analysis presented in Section 8.3.1.2.
For the Pathways component, data are aggregated from five data sources: Reac￾tome [45], KEGG [47], PathwayCommons [48], UniProt [19], and WikiPathways
[49]. The Reactome Pathway tab includes an interactive widget showing a graphi￾cal representation of each annotated pathway, which highlights other targets in the
pathways according to their TDL. All pathway annotations can be used as a start￾ing point to generate a target list page that includes all the targets in each pathway.
With pathway data users can generate a target list page of similar targets, a list of
all targets that share any pathway annotation with the chosen target, sorted by the
degree of overlap in their pathway annotations. Details on that calculation are in
Section 8.2.4.3.
Phenotypic Data
Gene Ontology (GO) [50, 51] defines terms for Molecular Functions, Biological
Processes, and Cellular Components that represent the normal function of gene
products. From the Gene Ontology Terms component, Pharosshows each annotation
that has been assigned to the target and can generate filtered lists of targets for any
annotation.
The Disease Associations component (Figure 8.9 – Example GPR68) includes
data from eight sources, including CTD [14], DisGeNET [15], DrugCentral [9],
eRam [16], Expression Atlas [17], JensenLab [7], Monarch [18], and UniProt [19].
Users can pivot from a target details page showing a list of associated diseases to a
disease list page where there are more analysis capabilities and visualizations for
the list of diseases. Our example target has no entries for direct disease association
annotations.
The Disease Novelty component (Figure 8.10 – Example DRD2) highlights data
from Tin-X [52] which discovers target–disease relationships through natural
language processing of PubMed abstracts. Tin-X quantifies two metrics represent￾ing the Importance, the strength of the association between the target and the
disease, and the Disease Novelty, the relative scarcity of publications about a disease.
Target–disease associations that have high Importance, and high Target Novelty,
are promising areas for following up. Figure 8.10 shows the Tin–X associations
found for DRD2, with highlights on diseases related to substance-related disorders.
Note the tendency for target–disease associations for DRD2 and substance-related
disorders are high-scoring associations in both Importance and Novelty.
The GWAS traits component (Figure 8.11 – Example DRD2) shows traits identi￾fied through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [53]. GWAS traits are sorted
according to an Evidence Score (Mean Rank Score), which is a ranking of the traits
based on the number and power of the GWAS studies that found the association.
These rankings of GWAS traits are calculated by Target Illumination GWAS Analyt￾ics (TIGA) [54] before being ingested into TCRD.
Similar to the Pathways data, a list of Similar Targets can be generated based on
GO Terms, Associated Diseases, or GWAS Traits, as well as many other data points
from this section. For example, a user could generate a target list that shares any
of the associated diseases as the target of interest. Presenting the list in order of the8.3 Use Cases 247

● The Find Similar Targets button will construct a target list that shares any associated dis￾eases with the target of interest, and sort them by the degree of overlap in the sets of
diseases, as described in Section 8.2.4.3.
degree of overlap allows them to easily find other targets that have the most similar
sets of those associated diseases, or whichever data field the similarity calculation
was based on.
Resources and Publications
Researchers can learn which typical experimental models (17 species supported)
have orthologous versions of the target. Additionally, resources, such as genetic
constructs, cells, mice, chemical tools, or data resources, generated by IDG grant
awardees may be possible to acquire for research. The last section of the target
details pages contains temporal plots of bibliometric scores [7, 55] and patent
counts that inform users about the popularity of research into a particular target.
Text-mined references from JensenLab, and manually curated GeneRIFs (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/about-generif) are available to review.
8.3.1.2 List Analysis
So far in this use case, as a researcher investigating the role of the dark tar￾get ATP1B4, we learned that there is some data for the target, but notably no
known associated diseases. Next, we will continue our search for possible disease
associations by expanding the search to related targets. One promising idea is to248 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets

● This component highlights data from Tin-X [52] which discovers target–disease relation￾ships through natural language processing of PubMed abstracts.

look for consistent documentation for the 70 documented protein–protein inter￾actions mentioned in section “Behavioral Data”. The Protein–Protein Interactions
component (Figure 8.8) presents a link to “Explore Interacting Targets,” which
takes the user to a list of 71 targets, including the 70 interacting targets plus ATP1B4
(the target of interest).
Filter Value Enrichment
As introduced in Section 8.2.3.1, the filters in the filter panel (Figure 8.2 panel E)
will tell us how many of the targets in the list have each filter value. Since ATP1B4
did not have any direct disease associations, we used the Associated Disease filter to
discover, which diseases may be associated with the set of interacting targets.
Figure 8.12 top-right shows the counts of targets in this list that are associated
with each disease. At first glance, it might seem significant that 35 of the 71 (49%)
targets in the list are associated with ovarian cancer, but knowing that ovarian
cancer and many other cancers are associated with changes in the function and
expression of many targets should lead us to be skeptical. In fact, in the unfiltered
target list (Figure 8.12 top-left), 8589 of the 20,412 (42%) targets in TCRD have a
documented association with ovarian cancer, meaning that even a randomly chosen8.3 Use Cases 249

list of proteins would include a large number of targets associated with ovarian
cancer.
Pharos allows users to calculate enrichment scores using Fisher’s Exact Test [31]
(Section 8.2.4.5), to determine the significance of finding a given count of filter val￾ues in a filtered list. In our example, Fisher’s Exact Test calculates a p-value of 0.13,
which can be interpreted asthe probability of finding 35 (or more) targets associated
with ovarian cancer in a randomly selected list of 71 targets. The implication is that
finding so many targets associated with ovarian cancer in thislist is not very surpris￾ing.Calculating the enrichmentscoresforthe entire list(Figure 8.12 bottom)reveals,
which diseases are significantly overrepresented in the filtered list. The top values
in thissorted list would be more promising for further investigation, especially since
three out of the top four overrepresented diseases are forms of heart failure.
A similar example is given on Pharos in the “Filter Value Enrichment” tutorial.
In that example, enrichment scores are calculated for the list of interacting targets
for a very well-understood target, the D(2) dopamine receptor (DRD2). In that
example, the enrichment scores reveal many neurological and substance-related
diseases that are commonly known to be associated with DRD2. That proof of250 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets

● Top left: In a target list, the filters show the counts of targets that have each annotation.
In this example, the counts of targets associated with each disease are shown for the
complete unfiltered target list. Some diseases are associated with a very large number of
targets.
● Top right: In a filtered list, these value counts are often affected by this bias in the data
toward heavily documented filter values. In this example, this list is filtered to targets that
interact with ATP1B4. Many of the top diseases in this filtered list are the same diseases
as top diseases in the unfiltered list. The “calculate enrichment” button here will calculate
the probability that the measured counts are explainable by random chance.

controlling the False Discovery Rate to 0.05.8.3 Use Cases 251
concept helps validate the method and lends credence to the idea of discovering
relevant annotations for less well-studied targets.
8.3.1.3 Downloading Data
Easy data extraction is a key requirement for many researchers. Researchers study￾ing ATP1B4 may build a download query and select the “Associated Disease” fields
to download all the associated disease data for targets in the list. Users wanting to
compile a list of approved drugs or active ligands for targets in the list would select
the “Drugs and Ligands” fields. Heat maps and the Sequence Alignment component
also contain shortcuts for initiating a data download with the appropriate fields.
8.3.1.4 Variations on this Use Case
Other Ways to Expand the Dataset
The path chosen in this use case was to expand the search for documentation from
one dark target to a list of related targets by compiling a list of interacting targets via
the “Explore Interacting Targets” button in the Protein–Protein Interactions compo￾nent of the target details page.
Another way to expand the dataset would be to compile a list of targets that share
one or more of the annotationsthat exist on thissparsely documented target. Beyond
simply clicking what annotations are there (i.e. PANTHER Class for cation trans￾porter) to generate a list of targets, users can also compile lists of targets based on
having any overlap in documentation through the “Find Similar Targets” buttons
(Section 8.2.4.3) that are available on a number of components including GO Terms
and Pathways.
Alternatively, the Protein Sequence and Structure component allows usersto easily
initiate a search for targets with a homologous protein sequence (Section 8.2.4.2).
A Sequence search can also be initiated from a target list page via a button high￾lighted in Figure 8.2 panel J. Figure 8.13 shows the resulting Sequence Alignment
component on the resulting List Analysis page that illustrates, which regions of the
sequence are matching in each entry in the target list.
It should also be noted that these expansions can be compounded, for example
by finding a list of targets with a homologous sequence, and then filtering that list
by PANTHER Class or GO term, thereby finding targets with multiple points of
similarity.
Other Filters to use for Enrichment Calculation
In addition to looking for Associated Diseases that are enriched in the target list,
other interesting filters to try might be IDG Family, PANTHER Class, DTO Class,
Pathways, GO Functions, or GO Processes. There are no restrictions on which fil￾ters are available to calculate enrichment, beyond the requirement that the filter is
categorical (i.e. not numerical).
8.3.2 Characterizing a Novel Chemical Compound
This use case is for a researcher who would like to explore the potential effects of
a novel chemical compound. For the sake of the example, we will use a “novel”252 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets
Figure 8.13 Sequence search.
● Sequence Search Results in the List Analysis tab of the resulting target list. The top plot is
a density plot of aligned residues for all the aligning sequences. Below is a representation
of each matching target’s region of alignment, color-coded by the percent identity of the
alignment.
compound represented by the following SMILES: CC1CC(O)(CCN1CCCC(=O)C1=
CC=C(F)C=C1)C1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1. Note that this is a slightly modified version of
haloperidol that is just for the purposes of this example, to help illustrate the con￾cepts. Ourresearcher hastwo main questions: What targets might be affected by this
compound? What effects might it have on the human body?
8.3.2.1 Finding Predicted Targets
Since this is a novel chemical compound, there would be no primary documenta￾tion to review, as was the case with the dark target in Section 8.3.1. The researcher
would begin on the ligand list page, and follow the link for “Structure Search” or
navigate to https://pharos.nih.gov/structure. Starting on the Structure Search page
(Figure 8.14), the user can paste in the SMILES to attempt to resolve the structure to
a known compound and render the compound in the MarvinJS widget.
Following the search link in the “Find Predicted Targets” card will fetch the list
of targets from NCATS Predictor [30] as described in Section 8.2.4.4. The ensuing
target list (Figure 8.15) is a compilation of proteins predicted as targets of the query
structure, and the targetsthat have a known activity to the compound in the database
if a matching compound was found. Since our example is a novel compound, only
predicted data are available. Predicted data are highlighted in the Target Card, and
in the filter panel with a shaded background.
Details about the prediction are shown in the Table View of the list pages, which
includesthe predicted activity, the activity forthe nearest compound from the model
training set, and a measure of the Applicability Domain. Prediction applicability is
quantified by the Tanimoto similarity between the query structure and the nearest8.3 Use Cases 253
Figure 8.14 Searching by chemical structure.
● Pharos’ Structure Search page allows users to initiate a search based on any chemical
structure. Many types of inputs are used to resolve into a SMILES string to load into the
Marvin JS Sketcher. The Sketcher can then be used to edit the query structure, upload a
file, or draw a compound from scratch.
● Options are available to find similar ligands to the query structure or find targets predicted
to interact with the query structure.
compound from the training set. Users can filter the list based on the numeric filter
for prediction applicability, or based on the numeric filter for the predicted activity.
For our example compound, NCATS Predictor found 25 targets with predicted
activity. There are several target filters to consider when the list consists of targets
with activity against a given compound. Calculating filter value enrichment, as
described in more detail in section “Filter Value Enrichment”, yields some interest￾ing results. Figure 8.16 shows the top five GO Functions, and the top five Associated
Diseases, for this list of predicted targets. The presence of serotonin-related GO
Terms, and depression-related diseases, are what we should expect from this
“novel” compound that is so closely related to haloperidol.254 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets
Figure 8.15 Predicted targets.
● Sample results from a target list consisting of targets with predicted activity to the query
structure.
● The Target Prediction Details panel shows the predicted activity the query structure will
have for the target. The nearest activity for this compound from the training set determines
the prediction applicability, which is quantified by the Tanimoto coefficient shown over the
≈ between the query structure and the nearest structure from the training set.
● The list can be sorted by a number of different fields. This list has been sorted according
to the potency of the predicted activity to the query structure.
● Experimentally determined activity will also be shown here for targets with a known activ￾ity to the query structure.
8.3.2.2 Analyzing Similar Ligands
Another method of investigating the potential targets or target families for a novel
compound isin the analysis of the effects of a set ofsimilar compounds. Asin the pre￾vious search for predicted targets, a Similarity Search is initiated from the Structure
Search page (Figure 8.14 bottom). Section 8.2.4.1 describes how this functionality
works.
Pharos will display a list of all compoundsfrom TCRD that are structurally similar
to the query structure (Figure 8.17). In the Table View of the ligand list, the 2D struc￾tures are presented in order of decreasing similarity for users to browse and choose
the best similarity cutoff. A Tanimoto coefficient of 0.6 is by default used to cast a
wide net for matching compounds. It is usually prudent to restrict the similarity fur￾ther using the numeric filter for the similarity score. Figure 8.17 shows the resulting
ligand list page after searching for similar compounds to our query structure, and
subsequently filtering the result list to those ligands with a Structure Similarity (i.e.
Tanimoto coefficient on molecular fingerprints) greater than 0.8. This results in a
list of 66 ligands from TCRD.8.3 Use Cases 255

Figure 8.18 Enriched filter values in a list of similar compounds.
● In a list of compounds found through a Similarity Search to a methylated analog of
haloperidol, filter value enrichment is calculated for the PANTHER Class filter and the
Target filter.
● The PANTHER Class filter in a ligand list represents the count of ligands in the list that
have activity for a target in each class. The enrichment scores show that G-protein coupled
receptors are highly overrepresented in the list, suggesting that the query structure may
also have activity for some G-protein coupled receptors.
● The Target filter in a ligand list represents the simple count of ligands in the list that have
an activity to each target. The enrichment scores show that several dopamine receptors
are overrepresented in the list, suggesting that the query structure may also have activity
for dopamine receptors.
There are several filters in this ligand list that can help understand the poten￾tial effect of the query compound. Similar to the workflow in Section 8.3.2.1, filter
value enrichment for the PANTHER Class filter, and for the Target filter, show that
G-protein coupled receptors, and specifically, dopamine receptors, are overrepre￾sented in the list of similar compounds to our query structure (Figure 8.18).
8.3.2.3 Ligand Details Pages
As always for the listing pages, clicking entries in the list will take the user to the
corresponding details page. Ligand details pages (Figure 8.19) show all data com￾piled for each compound and primarily consist of a rendering of the 2D structure of
the compound, a listing of known synonyms or other identifiers for the compound,
and a listing of associated targets and all measured activities against those targets.
The ligand details page can also serve as a jumping-off point for performing either a
Substructure Search, a Similarity Search for other compoundsin TCRD, or Exploring
the targets in a target list page.
A table of target activities is displayed (Figure 8.19 bottom), along with a button to
translate the list of targets into a more interactive target list page. That list page will
also include predicted activities, based on functionality described in Section 8.2.4.4.8.3 Use Cases 257
Figure 8.19 Ligand details.
● Top, Ligand Summary – This component shows the 2D structure and equivalent IDs. A
button allows users to initiate either a Similarity Search or a Substructure Search, of the

● Bottom, Target Activities – All experimentally determined target activities are shown here.
A button allows users to translate this view into a target list page, which will include targets
this compound that is predicted to have activity for.
8.3.2.4 Variations on this Use Case
Other Ligand List filters
Ligand lists have filters that can help users find compounds that meet their
requirements. Some of those filters were introduced in Section 8.3.2.2. Additionally,
Figure 8.17 includes the Type filter, which reports whether or not the compounds
have achieved FDA approval. In this example, three compounds are approved
drugs, while 63 are other active ligands.
The number of targets each compound has an activity for, a measure of target
specificity, is reflected in the Target Count filter (Figure 8.20). This can be used to
filter the list based on how selective the compounds are.258 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets
Figure 8.20 Target selectivity filters in a ligand list.
● Top: The Target Count filter in a ligand list represents the number of ligands in the list that
have documented activity to different numbers of targets. Compounds with a high number
are more promiscuous, while compounds with only one or two known target activities may
be selective or less well-studied. The sliders at the bottom of the histogram can be used
to filter the ligand list to only compounds that meet the requirements the user sets.
● Bottom: An UpSet Chart is constructed for the Target filter on a ligand list. The counts of
compounds in the list with each combination of active targets are represented. Clicking
on the bars or circles will filter the list to only those compounds that have the required
combination of active targets.
Using the UpSet Plots
Another useful method to dive into the specificity is to build an UpSet plot [56] for
the Target filter. On the List Analysis tab of the list pages, the Filter Visualizations
component shows Donut Charts and UpSet Charts for the different filters, depend￾ing on how many values an entry in the list can have for that filter. If an entry can
have multiple values (e.g. one compound can have activity for multiple targets), an8.3 Use Cases 259
UpSet plot is shown to help the user understand the overlap of different filter values
present in the list.
Figure 8.20 bottom shows an UpSet plot for the Target filter in this ligand list.
This was constructed by selecting the Target filter from the list of buttons along the
top, then selecting the targets that correspond to dopamine receptors using the “Se￾lect Filter Values” button, appearing below the first generated graph (for all targets).
Interpreting the UpSet chart tells us how many compounds in the list have activity
for each combination of filter values. For example, Figure 8.20 tells usthere are four￾teen compounds that have activity for the D2, D3, and D4 dopamine receptors, and
not D1A, D1B, or the dopamine transporter. Furthermore, clicking the appropriate
bar on the graph can filter the list to those fourteen compounds for follow-up.
Using the Heat Maps
The List Analysis tab will also display buttons to create heat maps (Figure 8.21).
Target list pages can construct heat maps of targets in the list vs. their associated
diseases, active ligands, or protein–protein interacting partners. Disease and ligand
list pages can construct heat maps of the elements in the list vs. their associated
targets. Heat maps are interactive in their sorting and can be used to drill down into
the details of each cell in the heat map. Figure 8.21 showsthe heat map of the average
reported activities between compounds in the list and the associated targets for the
current use case. A Details View is shown as would appear when the user clicks a
cell of the heat map. Links within the Details View will navigate to the appropriate
details pages for the corresponding clicked cell of the heat map.
Generating a Ligand List Based on a Target
The target details pages have Drugs and Ligands components (See Sections 8.2.3.2
and “Behavioral Data”) that display all the active compounds that TCRD has for a
given target. Those components have a link to explore the list of compounds on a lig￾and list page (See Figure 8.7). Ligand lists based on a target are an obvious use case
for finding selective compounds, using the Target Count filter (see section “Other
Ligand List filters”), or using the UpSet plot (see section “Using the UpSet Plots”). A
special feature of ligand lists based on an associated target is the potency filter that
becomes available. Figure 8.22 shows how the Target Count filter and the Potency
filter can be used togetherto filterthe list to only compounds with the required speci￾ficity and potency for the given target.
Uploading a Custom Ligand List
The functionality provided by a ligand list page can be used to explore common￾alities among a set of ligands identified to be active against a target in a biological
assay. From a ligand list page, the Upload button (Figure 8.2) can be used to resolve
compounds by a number of chemical identifiers (see Section 8.2.4.1), and the List
Analysis features such as filter value enrichment, and heat maps are useful for this
task as well.
Given a chemist who has screened thousands of compounds in a cell-based phe￾notypic assay, the resulting hit list would be loaded into Pharos. The workflows260 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets

● Top: A heat map showing the common targets that are associated with each compound in

potency of the measured activities.

● Bottom: The Details View of one cell of the heat map, opened by clicking on the cells.
described in Sections 8.3.2.2 and 8.3.2.4 show how the Target filter, PANTHER Class
filter, and DTO Class filter, can help understand the roles of the targets that are at
work in the screening assay. Similarly, the Target Count (Figure 8.20 left) filter and
the Target filter UpSet plot(see section “Using the UpSet Plots”) can help understand
the selectivity profile of the ligands in the list as well.
8.3.3 Investigating Diseases
The same types of analyses that are possible for targets and ligands are available
for diseases. This includes filtering a disease list based on values in the filter panel
(Section 8.2.3.1), calculating filter value enrichment (see section “Filter Value
Enrichment”), and generating UpSet plots (see section “Using the UpSet Plots”)
and heat maps (see section “Using the Heat Maps”).8.3 Use Cases 261
Figure 8.22 Finding appropriate ligands.
● Left: Target Count filter for a ligand list based on a target with many active compounds.
● Right: EC50 filter for the same ligand list.
● Filtering the list using these two filters can help find a compound with the required speci￾ficity (using the Target Count filter) and potency (using the EC50 filter).
● Note that the potency filters (like EC50 and IC50) are only available (and only make sense)
on ligand lists based on a single target.
One thing to highlight is that disease lists can be constructed based on association
with a given target. As pictured in Figure 8.9, the Disease Association component on
target details pages has a link to generate that list. From there, the Disease Ances￾try filter presents a listing of the common nodes in the disease hierarchy, for which
enrichment scores can be calculated, as in section “Filter Value Enrichment”.
Disease details pages are constructed for all MONDO disease terms and any dis￾ease name that could not be resolved to a standardized MONDO term. Basic descrip￾tions from MONDO, DO, and UniProt are shown in the summary panel, as are the
equivalent IDs from other ontologies (Figure 8.23). When data are available, results
of GWAS studies, sorted and ranked by the TIGA algorithm, as described above, are
shown for all targets associated with the disease.
The MONDO disease ontology is also informative in the hierarchical structure
in which diseases are defined. This hierarchy is captured in TCRD and leveraged
in Pharos. For example, asthma is a parent term for allergic and intrinsic asthma.
A Pharos user browsing the disease details page for asthma can navigate up and
down the hierarchy to the related disease details pages (Figure 8.24). Furthermore,
when a user clicks the “Explore Associated Targets” button on each disease details
page, the resulting list of targets associated with asthma will include targets with a
documented association to the child terms and all descendent terms.
Lastly, the disease details pages show a plot of two bibliometric scores from TIN-X
[52], analogous to the disease association data on a target details page (Figure 8.10).
As described in section “Phenotypic Data”, the Importance captures the strength
of an association between a target and a disease. The Novelty metric measures the
scarcity of publications about a target. Targets that score highly on the Importance
metric, and at the same time,remain relatively novel,such astargets above the noise
on both axes, are more likely to play a role in the disease.262 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets

8.4 Discussion
Aggregating and displaying data from multiple locationsis useful in its own right, as
it allowsfor easier accessto a wide range of knowledge. We note that Pharos as a data
aggregation tool was successfully leveraged in drug discovery research to prioritize
potential biomarkers using the novelty and protein class data within Pharos [57].
The TDL levels within Pharos are often used to prioritize druggable targets that do
not have known active ligands(Tdark and Tbio)[58] orthose that do have active [59].
The CSV download functionality is often used to easily download a specific type of8.4 Discussion 263
data for a list of targets[60]. Generally, it isstandard practice to allow a userto search
for an entity, present matches in a list format, and subsequently, allow users to dive
into details about entries in the list. As such, most database browsing websites will
have an equivalent of a listing page and a set of details pages.
The power of Pharos’ list pagesliesin the interesting waysin which the lists can be
generated, and the visualization and analysis options available. As an example, any
target list page will display the counts of targets in the list that match in a Reactome
Pathway, such as “Interferon Gamma Signaling.” When the target list has been gen￾erated based on an association with a rare disease, having a number of those targets
be a part of the same Reactome Pathway could be enlightening. Enrichment anal￾ysis for those Reactome Pathways can reveal the degree to which those hits can be
explained by random chance. Similarly, generating a target list based on sequence
alignment or protein–protein interactions enables a degree of illumination for dark
targets based on population analysis of the group of similar, or related targets.
Behind the scenes, Pharos is written in a modular fashion allowing developers
to readily expand or modify features related to fetching or processing data without
affecting the rest of the functionality. As a result, the same code is used to calculate
the top filter values for all filters in all models (targets, diseases, and ligands). The
only difference between filters is the table and column of the data being processed.
Furthermore, when new data processing functionality is added, such as the UpSet
Plots [56] (see section “Using the UpSet Plots”) starting from Pharos version 3.7,
the plots were available for all categorical filters at once. This allows the user to
generate UpSet Plots for specific use cases like viewing targets overlapping in dif￾ferent pathways. At the same time, less obvious use cases are also supported, such
as examining target overlap from each Data Source, or the overlap of targets in the
different IDG target lists. A user may want to know, which targets were found in
the ProKinO [61] dataset, AND NOT the Dark Kinome Knowledgebase [62], and
could use the UpSet plot for the Data Source filter for that. Similarly, a user may
be interested in which targets were highlighted in the 2020 IDG target list but was
removed from the 2022 IDG target list. The modular nature of the codebase supports
these unexpected use cases, which might satisfy questions from a program officer,
or someone thinking about quality control of different data sources, rather than a
typical biologist or chemist.
In a similar way, when support for calculating Filter Value Enrichment was added
in Pharos version 3.9, calculating enrichment became possible for all filters, not
just for “traditional” filters like pathways. The guiding principle at work here is to
develop functionality in a general way that applies to all data annotations, so as not
to restrict researchers to use cases that were planned for in advance.
In the future, TCRD will continue expanding to include new and interesting
datasets, while pruning some less useful, outdated ones. Additionally, efforts will be
made to automate the TCRD generation and harmonization scripts. Pharos is look￾ing toward developing a framework to easily incorporate new predictions, such as
predicted effects of inhibiting kinases on cancers [63], or predicted off-target effects
for ligands [64]. Incorporating more single-cell data, and developing informative264 8 Pharos and TCRD: Informatics Tools for Illuminating Dark Targets
visualizations to help users understand patterns in the data is another promising
area of development.

9.1 Introduction
An important goal of drug-discovery researchersisto determine which moleculesin
chemical compound databases have a specific bioactivity. This goal can be achieved
either by experimentally testing compound libraries to find molecules that show the
desired bioactivity (a process known as high-throughput screening; HTS) [1, 2] or
by computationally predicting the bioactivity of interest in files containing the struc￾ture of hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of chemical compounds encoded in
the form of electronic archives (a process known as virtual screening; VS) [3, 4]. In
VS, the researcher does not need to physically have the chemical compounds since
their description in electronic format is sufficient. The cost of VS is therefore much
lower than the cost of HTS, where the bioactivity of a large number of compounds
is measured experimentally.
Like all screening techniques, VS is sometimes compared to looking for a needle
in a haystack. However, using VS to find molecules that exhibit the desired activity
is much easier than finding the needle since VS is a targeted search (unlike search￾ing for a needle, where there is no privileged direction and all search directions are
equally possible). Thistargeted search can be guided by the characteristics of existing
drugs for the same target or by the structure of the macromolecular target itself.
Figure 9.1 shows an example of a typical VS workflow that is frequently used
in our laboratory [5–7] (other VS pipelines may also be successfully employed
[8, 9]). This VS workflow consists of several sequential filters (i.e. ADMET/PAINS,
protein–ligand docking, pharmacophore, and shape/electrostatic) where the output
molecules of one filter are the input molecules of the next filter, and so on. The
inverted pyramid shape in Figure 9.1 also shows that, as the VS progresses, the
number of available molecules decreasessince moleculesthat do not pass a filter are
discarded and not evaluated by the remaining filters. If the VS is designed correctly,
it is expected that, as the molecules pass through the various filters, the resulting

Figure 9.1 Overview of a typical virtual
screening (VS) workflow previously used in our
laboratory. The shape of the funnel is related to
the number of molecules evaluated at each
stage of the VS. Since these are elimination
stages in which compounds that do not pass a
filter are discarded and therefore not evaluated
by the subsequent filters, the number of
available molecules becomes smaller and
smaller.
molecular sample will be enriched in compounds with the desired bioactivity. In
other words, the probability that a randomly chosen molecule is an active one must
be lower in the starting database than at the end of the VS.
In this chapter, we describe the main methods used during a VS, determine which
open databases are useful during this process, and explain how to validate the accu￾racy of the bioactivity predictions made by the VS. All the resources mentioned
in this chapter are listed in Table 9.1, which also contains information on how to
access them.
9.2 Main Tools for Virtual Screening
VS have traditionally been classified as either Ligand-Based VS (LBVS) or
Structure-Based VS (SBVS) depending on whether the 3D structure of the target
is used (SBVS) or not used (LBVS) during the VS workflow [3]. However, ligand￾and structure-based methods can also appear combined in the same VS pipeline
[10–12]. Interestingly, if the experimental 3D structure of the target is unavailable
but the structure from a homologous protein is known, then a homology model of
the target can be built and SBVS methods can be used to find new active compounds
in chemical databases [5, 13]. With the AlphaFold program, [14–16] it is currently
possible to predict the structure of almost any protein (even if no experimental 3D
structure of homologous proteins of the target of interest is known) with a high
degree of accuracy. This means that almost all the technologies used in the VS
(SBVS or LBVS) are applicable to any target (though the application of AlphaFold
results in the field of drug discovery is still at a very early stage and rather uncertain
[17–19]). The following sections describe the filters in Figure 9.1.
9.2.1 ADMET and PAINS Filtering
To be effective as a drug, a bioactive molecule must be able not only to reach its
target in the organism at a sufficient concentration but also to remain there in bioac￾tive form long enough for the expected biological events to occur [20]. ADME, the9.2 Main Tools for Virtual Screening 273

acronym for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion [21], describes how
pharmacokinetic behavior is simplified into discrete parameters to be addressed in
the drug discovery/preclinical phases. All four criteria influence the levels and kinet￾ics of drug exposure to tissues and thus the performance and pharmacological activ￾ity of the compound as a drug. When, in addition to ADME properties, the potential
or actual toxicity of the compound is taken into account, the acronym ADME-Tox,
ADME/T, or ADMET is used instead [22]. PAINS, the acronym for Pan Assay Inter￾ference Compounds, on the other hand, refers to compounds that interfere with
assay read-out or that can also react nonspecifically with numerous targets in such
a way that they often generate false positives [23].
Filters to remove from the initial database those molecules that are predicted to
be PAINS or that have unfavorable ADMET properties are not part of the VS work￾flow itself but part of the initial pretreatment phase of the molecules on which the
screening of bioactive compounds will be performed (being a PAINS or having unfa￾vorable ADMET properties is an intrinsic characteristic of the molecule itself and
independent of the target against which the VS will be performed). Open access
servers such as SwissADME [20, 24] and FAFDrugs4 [22, 25] can predict which
input molecules (in SMILES format for SwissADME and SDF/SMILES format for
FAFDrugs4 [26, 27]) may be PAINS or have bad ADMET properties.
9.2.2 Protein–Ligand Docking
Protein–ligand docking predicts the coordinates of the complex between a protein
and a drug from their individual structures [28]. During this process, the protein
structure is usually considered rigid (or small conformational changes are allowed
in a very localized part of itsstructure), while the small molecule is considered able to
change its initial conformation to adapt to the protein-binding site. However, since
some targets show significant flexibility in their binding site, considering them as9.2 Main Tools for Virtual Screening 275
rigid during protein–ligand docking is a too strict approach. To overcome this limi￾tation,severalstrategies have been developed, including induced fit docking [29–33]
and ensemble docking [34, 35]. The most important difference between these two
approaches is that, while induced docking attempts to directly simulate the coupled
motion of the receptor and ligand, ensemble docking uses a set of different target
structures(either experimental orfrom molecular dynamicssimulations)to perform
calculations. AutoDock Vina [36, 37] is often used for protein–ligand rigid docking
whereas SLIDE [32] and Edock-ML [35] are examples of induced fit and ensemble
protein–ligand docking, respectively.
9.2.3 Pharmacophore Search
A pharmacophore is a 3D abstract description of molecular features (i.e. pharma￾cophoric sites) that are necessary for molecular recognition and biological activity
of a ligand by its target. A pharmacophore may also contain exclusion volumes that
indicate the positions of the binding site that the ligand cannot fill because they are
already occupied by the atoms of the target itself [3].
The simplest way to obtain a pharmacophore is from the three-dimensional (3D)
structure of a complex between the target of interest and a drug that has the desired
activity on this target (referred to as a structure-based pharmacophore).
When several drugs are known to be bioactive with respect to the same target but
the 3D structure of the target is not known, a ligand-based pharmacophore can be
obtained (assuming that all these ligands also share the target binding site and the
binding mode). Here, it is assumed that the combination of conformers (one per
ligand) with the maximum number of common pharmacophoric sites corresponds
to the way all these ligands bind to the 3D structure of the target (the common
sites are also assumed to represent the intermolecular interactions responsible for
their recognition and bioactivity with respect to the target). If inactive compounds
are also known, they can be used to add exclusion volumes to the ligand-based
pharmacophore.
Once a pharmacophore has been obtained, it can be used to search for small
molecules that occupy the maximum number of pharmacophore sites and at the
same time do not occupy exclusion volumes. Molecules that fit the pharmacophore
will be candidates for having the same bioactivity for the target as the molecule (or
molecules) from which the pharmacophore was obtained.
PharmaGist [38, 39] is a free resource for constructing ligand-based pharma￾cophores, while Pharmit (see Figure 9.2) [41–43] and ZINCPharmer [44, 45] are
free resources for building structure-based pharmacophores. Moreover, all three
resources can be used to screen small molecule databases.
Pharmacophores can also be used to examine the poses resulting from a previ￾ous protein–ligand docking step. In this way, it is possible to assess whether the
ligands, once oriented within the target binding site, are able to establish the inter￾molecular interactions needed to show high activity toward the drug target. In fact,
this is another way to exploit the main strength of protein–ligand docking algo￾rithms (i.e. their ability to find the bioactive pose) and obviate their main weakness276 9 Mining for Bioactive Molecules in Open Databases
Figure 9.2 The Pharmit web interface for a pharmacophore search. A pharmacophore
query for SARS-CoV-2 M-pro in complex with a perampanel derivative (PDB 7L10 [40]) is
shown on the Pharmit web interface [41].
(i.e. their inability to correctly calculate the affinity of each pose for the target). To
do this, one would only need to make sure that, for each ligand, the output of the
docking program provides a sufficient number of poses to ensure that the correct
one is among them (regardless of whether the scoring function places it at the top
of the predicted affinity ranking for the target). This strategy has been successfully
used to identify bioactive compounds for different targets [10, 11] and is similar
to using constraints during protein–ligand docking (though, in our opinion, using
pharmacophores allows greater flexibility in the VS strategy than using these con￾straints because, among other things, pharmacophore site types are more diverse
than protein–ligand docking constraints).
9.2.4 Shape/Electrostatic Similarity
Two moleculesthat, upon binding to a given target,share a 3D shape and an electro￾static charge distribution on their surface (even though they have a different chem￾ical structure) may have similar bioactivity for that target [46, 47]. It is therefore
possible to compare the shape and electrostatic surface area of the poses that have
passed through the previous filters (these would be the pharmacophore-compliant
docking poses; see Figure 9.1) with the experimental poses of drugs that are cocrys￾tallized with the target of interest. However, care must first be taken to superimpose
the structure of all these complexes onto the structure of the target used to obtain the
docking poses and the pharmacophore. Only in this way can it be guaranteed that
the comparison is made between molecules with the same relative orientation in
the target binding site. Moreover, if more than one complex between a highly active
drug and the target of interest is available, each docking pose must be compared
with each experimental pose, and the highest similarity must be chosen. Then, if
more than one docking pose is available forthe same ligand, only the one thatshows
the greatest similarity to one of the experimental poses to which it is compared will
be kept (while the rest will be discarded) [6, 7, 11]. Finally, poses with a similarity9.2 Main Tools for Virtual Screening 277

below a certain threshold will be discarded. Thisthreshold must be selective enough
to reduce, as much as possible, the number of false positives during VS validation
(even if this means increasing the number of false negatives) [11].
Figure 9.3 shows the comparison between two poses, one of which is experimen￾tal (corresponding to the H11 ligand in the 3BYZ structure [48]), and the other
corresponds to the docking pose of the ZINC03851930 ligand in the same structure.
The shape similarity between the two poses is 0.560 (where 1.0 corresponds to
a perfect overlap, i.e. the same shape), and the Poisson–Boltzmann electrostatic
similarity is 0.640 (where 1.0 corresponds to an identical electrostatic potential
overlap).
ESP-Sim [49] and ElectroShape [47] are examples of free resources for shape/
electrostatic similarity searches.
9.2.5 Protein-Structure Databases
Many tools used during a VS require the 3D structure of the target to which the drug
is to bind. These 3D structures may have been obtained experimentally (using tech￾niques such as X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR], or electron
microscopy) or may result from predictions obtained directly from their sequence
(using techniques such as homology modeling or protein threading). Several public
databases exist from which these 3D structures can be obtained. The most important278 9 Mining for Bioactive Molecules in Open Databases
ones are the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [50] and the PDB-REDO Databank [51] for
experimentally obtained structures and the SWISS-MODEL Repository [52] and the
AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AlphaFold DB)[15]for computationally pre￾dicted structures.
9.2.6 The Protein Data Bank
The PDB, which was created in 1971 at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton,
NY), originally contained seven structures [53]. Its purpose was to act as an interna￾tionalrepository in which to deposit the coordinates of proteins determined by X-ray
diffraction and make these data available on request. Since then, it has also included
protein structures determined by other techniques (NMR and electron microscopy)
and the 3D structures of other biomolecules (nucleic acids, oligosaccharides,
and their respective complexes with proteins). A PDB entry, which contains all
the information relating to a particular 3D structure deposited in the PDB, is
designated by a 4-character alphanumeric identifier called a PDB identifier or PDB
ID, which always begins with a number from 1 to 9 (e.g. 6LU7). There are currently
over 193,000 entries in the PDB, of which 168,000 correspond to proteins, 10,600
correspond to protein–nucleic acid complexes, 10,200 to protein–oligosaccharides
complexes, 3900 to nucleic acids, and 22 to oligosaccharides. Of these 193,000
entries, 167,000 were determined by X-ray diffraction, 13,700 were determined by
NMR, and 12,000 were determined by electron microscopy [54]. The coordinates of
the PDB structures are contained in text-only files (one file for each PDB entry) in a
PDB-specific format [55] that is soon to be replaced by the mmCIF format [56]. All
PDB files can be downloaded without restriction from the PDB or PDBe websites
[57, 58].
9.2.7 The PDB-REDO Databank
The PDB-REDO databank [59] contains optimized versions of existing PDB entries
that simultaneously satisfy two criteria: (i) the entry has been obtained by X-ray
diffraction; and (ii) the author deposited the corresponding structure factor files
along with the coordinates. All PDB entries that satisfy both criteria are treated with
a consistent protocol that reduces effects due to differences in age, software, and
depositor, thus making PDB-REDO a great dataset for large-scale structure analysis
studies [51, 60]. For example, an evaluation of the goodness of fit of the coordinates
of 39,820 protein/ligand complexes to the electron density map using the VHELIBS
program showed that both binding-site and ligand coordinates were much more
reliable if they were obtained from PDB-REDO than if they were obtained from
PDB [61]. Specifically, while VHELIBS rated 14,304 binding sites and 25,350 lig￾ands obtained from PDB-REDO as “Good” (the other categories were “Dubious”
and “Bad”), these values decreased by 50% when the data were obtained from PDB
[62] and EDS [63] (7671 and 12,419, respectively). It is therefore recommended that,
whenever possible, priority should be given to working with structures obtained
from PDB-REDO rather than those obtained directly from PDB.9.2 Main Tools for Virtual Screening 279
9.2.8 The SWISS-MODEL Repository
The purpose of the SWISS-MODEL Repository is to provide access to an
up-to-date collection of annotated 3D protein models generated for all UniProtKB
sequences [64] for which no experimental structures are available [52]. Since the
structures in this repository were obtained by homology modeling (and these types
of models can only be obtained by the automated SWISS-MODEL pipeline for those
proteins that have a minimum of 30% sequence identity with at least one protein
of known 3D structure that acts as a template during model construction), this
repository contains only structural models for a fraction of the UniProtKB proteins.
Interestingly, in cases where templates corresponding to the same sequence seg￾ment exhibit significant conformational differences, several models are generated
to reflect structural diversity.
To inform users about the expected local accuracy, the quality of the various
models is evaluated and annotated using the QMEAN tool (only high-quality
models – i.e. those with an overall QMEANDisCo score above 0.5 – are imported
into the SWISS-MODEL repository) [65]. If the homology-modeled structure
for a sequence is unavailable, the user can build it interactively through the
SWISS-MODEL workspace [66, 67]. Currently, the repository contains 2,258,794
homology models that can be freely downloaded [68].
9.2.9 The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database
AlphaFold DB was released in July 2021 [15, 69]. This database contains the 3D
structures predicted by the AlphaFold program (CASP14 winner) for proteins
of experimentally unknown 3D structure [16]. Since, unlike the SWISS-Model,
AlphaFold does not need homologous protein structures to make its predic￾tions [14], AlphaFold DB contains structural models of proteins that are not
in the SWISS-Model Repository. The first release of this database covered the
human proteome and the proteomes of 20 other key organisms (e.g. Arabidopsis
thaliana, Escherichia coli, and Oryza sativa), while the second release added the
majority of manually curated UniProt entries (e.g. Swiss-Prot) [70]. AlphaFold DB
currently contains over 200 million entries that include the human proteome and
the proteomes of 47 other key organisms that are important in research and global
health [69].
Regarding the quality of the predicted 3D structures, AlphaFold produces a
per-residue estimate of their confidence on a scale from 0 to 100. This confidence
estimate, called pLDDT, corresponds to the score predicted by the model on the
lDDT-Cα metric. This value isstored in the B-factor fields of the AlphaFold database
files in PDB format, but, unlike the B-factor, the higher the value of pLDDT, the
better the quality of the prediction. Regions with pLDDT>90 are thus expected to
be modeled with high accuracy, while those with pLDDT between 70 and 90 are
expected to be modeled well, and those with pLDDT between 50 and 70 are of low
confidence and should be treated with caution.
In theory, it would be advisable to use only AlphaFold DB structures during
drug discovery or development if their binding sites have a pLDDT value between280 9 Mining for Bioactive Molecules in Open Databases
90 and 100. In general, however, the current version of AlphaFold is considered not
yetsufficiently accurate forits modelsto be used in drug discovery or design [17–19].
It has been argued, for example, that the current AlphaFold implementation cannot
predict all the relevant conformations of a target because its main assumption
is that, based on the sequence alone, a unique 3D structure of a protein can be
described (whereas proteins can exist in multiple conformationsthat are all relevant
for their functional role) [17]. This inability to control the output conformation of
the predicted 3D structure (which, forinstance, can be controlled if the predicted 3D
structure is obtained via homology modeling by selecting the appropriate template
structure) is therefore an important limitation when using these predicted protein
structures for drug discovery and design.

9.3 Validating Binding Site and Ligand Coordinates
in Three-Dimensional Protein Complexes
One could assume that all PDB files corresponding to experimentally known struc￾tures are of high quality. However, we should not forget that these models are derived
from the interpretation of experimental data and that the accuracy of atom coordi￾nates is not homogeneous between different PDB entries or even within the same
PDB entry [71]. Before using a PDB file for drug discovery and design, therefore,
the accuracy of the drug binding site coordinates should be validated because, for
example, they are crucial for the proper behavior of protein–ligand docking pro￾grams. With proteins obtained by X-ray diffraction (the method of choice for study￾ing the structure of macromolecules complexed with small molecular ligands [18]),
this can be done simply by using the Validation HElper for LIgands and Binding
Sites (VHELIBS) program [61, 72]. VHELIBS is a software that facilitates the val￾idation of binding site and ligand coordinates for users of protein structures with
little or no knowledge of crystallography. Using a graphical user interface for PDB
entries (see Figure 9.4), VHELIBS checks how well the ligand and binding-site coor￾dinates match the electron density map. The user can thus specify threshold values
for numerous properties related to the fit of the coordinates to the electron den￾sity (Real Space R, Real Space Correlation Coefficient, and average occupancy are
used by default), and the program will automatically classify residues and ligands
as “Good,” “Dubious,” or “Bad” based on the specified limits. The default values
used for the parameters have been carefully chosen (and are valid for most situa￾tions) but advanced users can easily adjust them if necessary. VHELIBS takes as
input a user-supplied list of PDB or UniProtKB codes (which are mapped to their
corresponding PDB codes) that can be entered directly from the GUI or provided
in a text file. Finally, once the automatic classification is finished, the user can also
visually check the quality of the fit of the residues and ligandsto the electron density
map and reclassify them if necessary (see Figure 9.4).9.4 Databases for Searching New Drugs 281

the coordinates of the HVB ligand and its binding site to the 5RF2 structure [73] are

9.4 Databases for Searching New Drugs
Three main types of databases can be used to screen for new drugs using VS: (i) those
containing molecules that are either physically available in a commercial catalog
or can be isolated from a natural source; (ii) those containing “virtual” molecules;
and (iii) those containing molecules that are either physically available or available
on-demand. An example of the first group is the COlleCtion of Open Natural Prod￾UcTs(COCONUT) [74] while GDB-11 [75] is an example of the second, and ZINC20
[76] is an example of the third.
9.4.1 COCONUT
COCONUT is a good example of a database containing moleculesthat can be isolated
from naturalsources[74].COCONUT is a generalistic natural products database that
gathers data from over 50 open natural product resources (e.g. AfroDB [77], Marine
Natural Products [78], NPAtlas [79], Super Natural II [80], TCMDB@Taiwan [81],
and UNPD [82]). As well as the molecular structure, each entry in the database
is associated, if available, with its known stereochemical forms, literature, organ￾isms that produce them, and natural geographical occurrence. The latest version of
COCONUT (January 2022) contains 407,270 different molecules that can be down￾loaded free of charge, without restriction, and in several formats that are ready for
use in VS pipelines [83].282 9 Mining for Bioactive Molecules in Open Databases
9.4.2 GDBs
Databases grouped under the acronym Generated DataBases (GDBs) aim to pop￾ulate all the chemical space that molecules known so far have not yet occupied
[75, 84, 85]. The authors have therefore assembled various databases while estab￾lishing an upper limit on the number of nonhydrogen atoms they can contain.
For example, the GDB-11 database contains the 26.4 million molecules (including
110.9 million stereoisomers, three- and four-membered rings and triple bonds) that
can be built by using a maximum of 11 C, N, O, and F atoms and following simple
rules of chemical stability and synthetic feasibility [75]. The GBD-13 database,
which was constructed in a similar manner to GBD-11 but uses a maximum of 13
atoms of C, N, O, S, and Cl, contains 977,468,314 small drug-like molecules [84].
GBD-17, on the other hand, was constructed using a maximum of 17 atoms of C, N,
O, S, and halogens and contains 166.4 billion molecules [85]. Unlike known drugs
and bioactive compounds, GDBs contain a plethora of nonaromatic molecules
with a 3D shape. These are extremely useful for drug discovery because they
generally have more desirable ADMET properties than the mostly aromatic and
planar structures of known drug molecules [86]. Using GDB-17 as raw material,
the same research group also obtained GDBMedChem [87]. This is a collection
of 10 million small molecules from GDB-17 that were selected by applying rules
inspired by medicinal chemistry to exclude problematic functional groups and
complex molecules and further sampling the resulting subset uniformly in terms
of molecular size, stereochemistry, and polarity. GDBMedChem molecules, which
are more diverse and very different from known molecules in terms of substruc￾tures, represent an excellent source of diversity for drug discovery. The GDB and
GDBMedChem databases can be downloaded free of charge in several formats
suitable for use in a VS (however, GDBs should not be used as part of or in patents,
and large sections of them should not be redistributed without the express written
permission from the authors) [88].
9.4.3 ZINC20
ZINC20 is a free database containing over 230 million purchasable compounds (as
well as nonpurchasable ones) in ready-to-dock, 3D formats sourced from 310 cata￾logs from 150 companies/institutions [76]. The database is organized in such a way
the moleculesfrom some or all of these catalogs(and also forspecific subsets of them
[89]) can be downloaded for local use. For example, anyone interested in doing a VS
of natural molecules can select the biogenic subset that contains all the molecules of
natural origin dispersed in these 310 catalogs[90]. The current number of molecules
available for download in the biogenic subset is 135,335, of which 61,592 are com￾mercially available [89].
9.5 Databases of Bioactive Molecules
Collections of bioactive small molecules that exhibit the desired activity against
a target are important for discovering new bioactive molecules that share the9.5 Databases of Bioactive Molecules 283
same activity against the same target. For example, the characteristics of these
already-known bioactive small molecules can be used to guide the search at some
stages of a VS. However, another important application of these collections of
bioactive molecules is that they facilitate validation (from a theoretical point of
view) of the extent to which the designed VS strategy is able to identify them when
they are mixed with other molecules that do not show bioactivity for their target.
Fortunately, several open access databases, such as BindingDB [91, 92], PubChem
[93, 94], and ChEMBL [95, 96], contain these collections.
9.5.1 The BindingDB Database
BindingDB, which has been operating since 2001, is a public, online database of
binding affinities focused primarily on the interactions of proteins considered to
be drug targets with drug-like small molecules [91, 92]. It includes data extracted
from the literature and selected confirmatory bioassays from PubChem and
ChEMBL entries for which a well-defined protein target is provided. BindingDB
contains 2.5 million binding data for 1.1 million compounds and 8821 protein
targets [91]. To search for compounds that show activity against a certain target,
several search methods are available. First, the sequence or name of the target can
be used. Much more complex requests can also be performed via the advanced
search, which not only includes the identity of the target (via its accession code
in UniprotKB) but also filters the results using, for example, bioactivity ranges or
the article or patent where the bioactivities have been published. Small molecules
that satisfy the search criteria can easily be compiled in 2D or 3D SDF format
[27] for download and local use. In addition, BindingDB has a Chrome/Firefox
extension (i.e. BDBFind) that, once installed, enables users to know automatically
when BindingDB has the data for an article, PubMed entry, or US patent they
are searching for online. Moreover, BDBFind provides direct links to enable users
to view or download these data. Data curated by BindingDB are made available
under a Creative Commons Attribution License [97] as long as BindingDB is
cited [98].
9.5.2 PubChem
PubChem is a chemical database of the National Institute of Health (NIH).
Launched in 2004, it contains mainly small molecules (as well as larger molecules
such as nucleotides, carbohydrates, lipids, peptides, and chemically modified
macromolecules). For all these molecules, PubChem collects information on
their chemical structure, chemical and physical properties, biological activities,
patents, health, safety, toxicity data, etc. [93, 94]. PubChem contains 293 million
bioactivities for 110 million compounds and 184,481 protein targets. To search
for compounds that show activity against a given protein target, PubChem has a
simple search tool on its home page from which, based on the target’s UniProtKB
access code, users can access different pages with full information about it (this
information can also be accessed from https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/284 9 Mining for Bioactive Molecules in Open Databases
XXX, where XXX should be replaced by the above-mentioned UniProtKB access
code). Specifically, information about all compounds whose activity has been
measured with respect to the target of interest can be found in the “Chemicals
and bioactivities” section of these pages. This information can be exported in
different file formats for local use. The simple CSV format shows the PubChem
code (i.e. CID) but not the structure of the various compounds (e.g. in SMILES
format [26]) to which each experimental bioactivity corresponds. XML and JSON
formats include more identification types like IUPAC and common chemical
names. An external tool such as ChemmineR [99] can then be used to obtain the
structuresfrom the corresponding CIDs or chemical names. As well asforrecruiting
compounds with bioactivity against a specific target, PubChem can be used for
other chemoinformatics-related tasks such as developing bioactivity and toxicity
prediction models, discovering polypharmacological (multi-target) ligands, or iden￾tifying new targets (for drug repurposing or predicting off-target side effects) [100].
PubChem is an open access database from which most data can be downloaded free
of charge, though exceptions may exist when the licensing agreements of the origi￾nal sources of the information collected prevent the bulk downloading of certain
datasets.
9.5.3 ChEMBL
ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like
properties. It is obtained, for example, from the primary scientific literature and
public screening campaigns and is hosted at the European Bioinformatics Institute
(EBI). For each molecule in the database, ChEMBL contains data such as: (i) its
two-dimensional (2D) structure; (ii) calculated properties (e.g. logP, molecular
weight, Lipinski parameters, etc.); and (iii) various measures of its bioactivity (e.g.
binding constants, pharmacology data, and ADMET) [95, 96]. The ChEMBL v31
contains 19.7 million bioactivities for 2.3 million compounds and 15,072 targets.
The best way to search for compounds that show activity against a given protein
target is to use the target’s UniProtID with the Simple Search tool and identify the
ChEMBL ID for that target (e.g. CHEMBL2842 for human mTOR). The Target
Report Card will then show which drug-like molecules have measured experimental
bioactivity data for it. The bioactivity information on that report card contains data
for: (i) drugs and clinical candidates; (ii) activity charts (how available activity data
are distributed among the various ways of measuring it; e.g. IC50, Ki
, or Kd); (iii)
the distribution of associated bioassays (i.e. binding, functional or ADME); (iv) the
ligand efficiency distribution (i.e. a plot of the binding efficiency index relative to the
surface efficiency index); and (v) drug-like molecules with experimental bioactivity
for that target and distributed according to their molecular weight (where the 2D
SDF file of each set of molecules can be easily downloaded). Interestingly, molecules
with quantitative bioactivity in a specific range can also be downloaded in several
formats for each molecular weight range. ChEMBL data are made available under
a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License [101].9.6 Databases of Inactive/Decoy Molecules 285
9.6 Databases of Inactive/Decoy Molecules
When theoretically validating a VS, as well as having molecules with the desired
bioactivity, it is essential to have molecules that are known (or presumed) not
to be active with respect to the target of interest. This will make it possible to
evaluate whether the VS is capable of distinguishing active compounds from
inactive ones when they are mixed (a situation that is similar to what occurs when
we apply the VS to a database of chemical compounds to search for new active
molecules).
9.6.1 Collecting Experimentally Inactive Compounds from PubChem
Some bioactivity compound databases(especially PubChem) are a good place to find
compounds with no activity for a specific target. In many cases, these inactive com￾pounds come from HTS assays. One way to obtain these inactive compounds from
PubChem is to use the PubChem BioAssay Advanced Search Builder and search for
the UniProtKB code of the target (UniProt Accession field) with the word “Inactive”
in all fields [102]. For example, the search for human mTOR inhibitors (accession
number P42345 in UniProtKB) yields 15 results. The first is entitled “InCell qHTS
Assay for Inhibitors of the mTORC1 Signaling Pathway in WT MEF Cells: Hit Val￾idation.” Accessing the main page of this assay shows that of the 796 compounds
tested for mTOR inhibitor activity, 516 are inactive [103]. Finally, after viewing the
data table of the 796 compounds, the section of the data table corresponding to the
inactive compounds can be exported for local use (and the structures of those com￾pounds can be obtained from their CID by using tools such as ChemmineR [99] or
by translating common/IUPAC names into structures).
9.6.2 Collecting Presumed Inactive Compounds from Decoy Databases
If it is impossible to obtain compounds that have been experimentally shown to be
inactive against a given target(orfew are available with these characteristics), decoys
can be used. Decoys are molecules that are assumed to be inactive against a target
(i.e. they are unlikely to bind to the target) [104]. In addition, the physical properties
of the decoys must be sufficiently similar to those of the active compounds so that
enrichment during VS validation is notsimply a matter ofseparation by trivial phys￾ical characteristics leading to artificial enrichment [105, 106]. Some databases con￾tain sets of decoys for certain selected targets. The most widely used decoy database
is DUD-E [107, 108] (though others such as DEKOIS [109, 110] and VDS [111, 112]
are also used for benchmarking/validation studies).
The Directory of Useful Decoys Enhanced (DUD-E) contains sets of actives and
decoys for 102 protein targets [107, 108]. For each active molecule, DUD-E provides
50 decoys that, relative to it, have (i) similar physical properties (i.e. molecular
weight, calculated logP, number of rotatable bonds, net molecular charge, and
hydrogen bond donors and acceptors); and (ii) a different topology (i.e. 2D fin￾gerprints were used to minimize the topological similarity between the decoys286 9 Mining for Bioactive Molecules in Open Databases
and its corresponding active). DUD-E also tries to: (i) avoid potential false decoys
(i.e. hidden actives) by using a stringent topological dissimilarity filter; and
(ii) include, when possible, experimentally inactive molecules in the corresponding
DUD-E decoy-target sets.
9.6.3 Building Custom-Based Decoy Sets
If there are no inactive compounds for the target of interest or there are no decoys
for that target of interest in any of the databases mentioned above [105, 107, 109],
programs exist that enable users to obtain them from a set of known actives of the
target [104, 113]. The tool that enables decoys to be generated using the selection
criteria employed by DUD-E, which is available on DUD-E’s own website, obtains
the decoys from the purchasable subset of the ZINC database [113].
DecoyFinder is a graphical tool that helps users to find sets of decoy molecules
for a given group of active ligands [104]. To do so, it uses one of two methods:
(i) the fast method (the default method used by the current version of the program),
which finds decoys with similar molecular weights to those of the corresponding
target active set; or (ii) the slow method, which searches for decoy molecules
that physically resemble the active set of the target (i.e. have a similar num￾ber of rotational bonds, hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, logP value, and
molecular weight) but are chemically different from the active one (defined by
a Tanimoto coefficient threshold between the MACCS fingerprints of the active
ligand and the decoy molecule). Optionally, with the latter method a Tanimoto
coefficient threshold can be set between decoys to ensure chemical diversity in the
decoy set.
9.7 Main Metrics for Evaluating the Success of a Virtual
Screening
Clearly, the best way to evaluate the success of aVS isto evaluate biological activity in
vitro, in cellulo, or in vivo [3]. However, this is not always possible. A computational
validation, which can be performed during the development of the VS process to set
up various parameters, is always useful. This essentially involves applying the VS
process to a set of molecules (active molecules) with the activity we are looking for
and that are mixed with inactive molecules (or decoys) for the same target. The VS
is then expected to selectively predict the active molecules.
Several metrics can be used to quantify the success of the validation of a VS. These
can be applied to the entire VS process or to individual steps of the VS. The enrich￾ment factor (EF) measures the fraction of active molecules that survive the VS (i.e.
the ratio between the proportion of actives at the end of the VS process and their pro￾portion in the starting database that is being screened) or one of its steps [114]. An
EF>1 indicatesthat we are enriching the set of compoundsselected byVS (ortheVS
step) with active molecules while inactive molecules or decoys are being discarded.
An EF of 1 indicatesthat the VS (or the VS step) is not enriching the dataset in active9.7 Main Metrics for Evaluating the Success of a Virtual Screening 287
molecules. When the output of a VS step consists of a score (such as a docking score)
that can be sorted, the ratio of active molecules found in a specific percentage of the
validation dataset can be used. Thisis useful because in aVS, a key objective isto find
active molecules as highly ranked as possible. For example, “EF at 1%” represents
the EF within the top 1% of the molecules ranked by decreasing values of predicted
affinity for the target or molecular similarity to the reference active compounds, for
instance, depending on the chosen approach.
ROC curves can be used in sorted datasets to evaluate the performance of a VS or
one of its steps. ROC curves represent true positive rates (active molecules) vs. false
positive rates (inactive molecules or decoys predicted as active molecules), while
the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which measures the ability of a classifier to
distinguish between classes, is used as a summary of the ROC curve. AUC values,
which range from 0 to 1, represent the probability that a random active molecule
is ranked higher than a random inactive molecule or decoy. An AUC value of
1 is obtained if all active molecules are ranked higher than inactive ones (for
example, when the docking scores of all active molecules are more negative than
any inactive molecule or decoy). An AUC value of 0.5 means that the VS approach
is not better at identifying active molecules than random selection. However,
identical AUC values for two different VS steps do not mean that they have the
same performance (see Figure 9.5). One VS step may find an inactive molecule in
the initial part of the ranking, while the other may find some active molecules in the
lower part. To prioritize performances in which active molecules are found first,
the Boltzmann-Enhanced Discrimination of ROC (BEDROC) [115] metric can be
used. BEDROC assigns more weight to early-ranked molecules. However, datasets
with different ratios of active/inactive molecules cannot be compared directly with
this metric.

9.8 Concluding Remarks
Open databases containing the bioactivity data of small molecules have become
an essential part of any VS project because, as well as guiding the construction of
the VS workflow itself (e.g. establishing pharmacophores based on how they inter￾act – or are supposed to interact – with the target), they can also be used to validate
it. However, the enormous amount of bioactivity data in these databases also has its
downside: different assays and experimental conditions may provide different values
of measured activities for a given compound, and this must be taken into account
when using these data. Bioassay results in these databases also provide informa￾tion on molecules that are not very potent or are even inactive. Inactive molecules
do not usually appear in publications, but, as mentioned above, they are important
for validating a VS process. In addition, including inactive data in machine learning
methods produces models with higher predictive capacity for bioactivity [116].Inter￾estingly, programmatic accessto these databasesthrough an API allows easy remote
access to all these bioactivity data as well as the development of data processing
workflows [117–119].
One clear area for improvement in these bioactivity databases is the time it
takes from when an article describing the activity of a compound is published
until its data appear in one of these databases. Our recent experience in collecting
SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors from the literature [120, 121] has shown us that
sometimes it is not easy to know which compound an article refers to. Sometimes
only a 2D representation, an abbreviation, or a number is available. Ideally, each
compound should be accompanied by a notation describing its structure, such
as SMILES, which also includes its stereochemistry. Also, authors could submit
compounds and their bioactivities directly to the appropriate open databases, or
journals could require all such data to be made public, as is done for proteins,
genes, and protein structures before the authors submit the manuscript describing
them. In relation to SARS-CoV-2 research, another suggested improvement of
the ChEMBL database is that nonstructural proteins, such as the M-pro protein,
could be considered independent targets. Since these proteins are synthesized as
polyproteins, they are currently included in the same target (CHEMBL4523582)
under the name “Replicase polyprotein 1ab.” This target, therefore, contains drugs
and assays for different proteins, which makes collecting M-pro-specific data rather
complicated. In contrast to this situation, the SARS-CoV-1 M-pro protein has its
own target (CHEMBL3927).
Finally, we would like to mention that, as well as collecting the activity of each
molecule, some of these databases (e.g. PubChem and ChEMBL) increasingly con￾tain more experimental and predicted information, such as physical and chemical
properties, and act as de facto hubs for collecting the whole knowledge about the
small molecules they contain. For example, the ChEMBL database even includes
a target prediction, at three different confidence levels, and shows the ChEMBL
targets that are predicted to interact with each compound in the database [122].
Including a section in these databases dedicated to the targets and integratingReferences 289
information from bioassay databases makes it easy to compile all the information
available for a given target.

Open Access Databases – An Industrial View
Michael Przewosny
Borngasse 43, D-52064 Aachen, Germany
10.1 Academic vs. Industrial Research
Since the spread of the Internet, extensive changes have taken place in many areas,
both professionally and private. Modernization took place in many areas of the econ￾omy, new branches of the economy emerged, and communication behavior and the
use of the media changed.
This also led to enormous changes in technical and scientific fields. Until the
mid-1990s, this accumulated knowledge was only available in printed form, mostly
freely accessible in university libraries. Digitization was pushed by institutions and
publishers, not only for commercial purposes but also to create worldwide access to
data and information. Not only are journals and books now available online, but the
inclusion of this content in searchable databases has also been accomplished.
Before these online databases were established, the life ofscientists was character￾ized by time-consuming research in bound data collections. For chemists who were
preparing a research project or a doctoral thesis, it meant disappearing into libraries
for several days to evaluate the current state of knowledge and defining this as the
starting point for their scientific work. The best-known data collections were the
Gmelin for inorganic chemistry and the Beilstein for organic chemistry, in which
structured research was possible [1, 2]. Chemical Abstracts (CA) was also available
across disciplines, provided by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), a subdivision
of the American Chemical Society (ACS) established in 1907. The aim was to bring
together and index all chemistry-related information (journals, books, patents, dis￾sertations, congresses, etc.) in order to make them available [3, 4].
The result of digitization isthe commercial online databasesReaxys and SciFinder.
Reaxys (https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/reaxys) is the successor to Crossfire,
which provided access to the Beilstein, Gmelin, and Patent Chemistry databases
until 2010. The Windows-based version since then has access to the three databases
and allows all chemistry-related searches for structures, substructures, reactions,
and synthesis planning based on journals and patents. Provider is the publishing
house Elsevier (Table 10.1).

SciFinder (https://www.cas.org/solutions/cas-scifinder-discovery-platform/cas￾scifinder) is a database developed by the CAS in which not only chemical but also
biological information can be searched [5, 6].
Reaxys and SciFinder are established for data analysis in academic and industrial
research because of the amount of data and the clearsearch and filter options as well
as the export of search results in form of Excel lists and chemical structure lists as
sdf-files (structure data file).
Academic and industrial research differ fundamentally in their focus. Research
at universities is free, deals primarily with basic research, and is financed by state
funding or industrial cooperation. Industrial research, e.g. materials science, phar￾maceutical research, and others, have the goal of developing new materials, drugs
or dosage forms and bringing them to the market as commercially viable products
and being refinanced through a life cycle process.
In the pharmaceutical industry, the development of a new active ingredient
involves an extensive, time-consuming, and costly process. Not only the indication
but also the selection of a possible chemical or biological agent and its formulation
must be carefully evaluated.
The development of a possible new active ingredient is divided into several devel￾opment phases (Scheme 10.1):
Much information on the individual developmentsteps can be researched in com￾mercial and publicly accessible databases and collections.
At the beginning of a project in pharmaceuticalresearch, there is an assessment of
both the indication and the possible target. In this Target Assessment (TA), a team
of chemists, biologists, biochemists, and pharmacologists is formed, which, based
on the results of research, decides whether it makes sense to deal with a target or
an indication. A large number of scientific sources are available for obtaining this
information; in addition to journals and patents, databases are the most important
resource. The topicality of the information sought is of great relevance in indus￾try because of its financial interests and requires both scientific and economically
reliable data, which is a big difference from university research. In addition, strate￾gic aspects such as contract research organizations (CROs), contract development,10.1 Academic vs. Industrial Research 301

production, manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), in- or out-licensing, outsourc￾ing, offshoring, company takeovers, etc.) must be assessed.
Obtaining this necessary and up-to-date information Competitive Intelligence,
(CI) is time-consuming and costly and can only be provided by the industrial side
with great effort. The alternative isrepresented by commercial providers who search
for all the necessary information from all available sources(Internet, patentservices,
company websites, analyst websites, regulatory institutions, authorities, etc.), com￾pile them and save them in the form of Excel files or SD files. Make files available
for analysis. The best-known and established providers are:

● Regulatory aspects
● Generics, biosimilars
● Alerts
The commercial providers make this data and information available and can be
downloaded as reports for any desired search term.
The problem for small and medium-sized biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical
companiesisthe limited financial possibilitiesto access thisinformation. The estab￾lishment of databases at universities and research institutions was promoted over
several years through private- and state-financed projects in order to generate and
compile general and specific information and make it available for research and
development.
As already mentioned, the TA is the starting point for a new project in which
chemists and biologists collect a large amount of information in order to create a
basis for decision-making.
It is traditionally the task of chemists to create an overview of the patent situation
of biological targets, substances, or pharmaceutical dosage forms, the so-called CI.
The national and international patent offices are state-financed organizations that
decide on the granting of patents after an examination procedure. All information
on submitted invention disclosures, processing status, and patent granting is freely
accessible on the websites of the patent offices.

The disadvantage is that many patents are published in their national languages,
which is a problem with Asian patents in particular. Most patents available as pdf
files are scanned image files, and searching in these filesis only possible after conver￾sion to readable formats; the alternative is a paid translation. Google Patents(https://
patents.google.com/ (accessed 20 April 2022)) offers a free solution whereby the
patents can be downloaded not only in their national language but also in English
translation as a pdf file, which gives access to the information contained in foreign
patents.304 10 Open Access Databases – An Industrial View
The search for a new drug begins with the identification of a suitable targetsuch as
proteins, signaling pathways, genes, and nucleic acid sequences that are associated
with a disease:
● G-Protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
● Ion channels
● Nuclear receptors
● Enzymes
● Transporters
● DNA
● RNA
In order to study the interaction of a possible active substance with a receptor, it
is necessary to find the binding site of the ligand on a protein. Knowledge of the
three-dimensional (3D) structure of the biological macromolecule is helpful for
understanding the function of a protein. The Protein Data Bank (PDB), founded
in 1971, is the largest structural database for proteins, DNA, and RNA (https://
www.rcsb.org/ (accessed 24 April 2022)). The structures are determined by X-ray
structure analysis and NMR spectroscopy and are freely available. The following
sequences and structures of biological macromolecules can be searched [7].
The following sequences and structures of biological macromolecules can be
searched:
● 189,735 protein structures
● 56,800 structures of human sequences
● 14,225 nucleic acid containing structures
Internationalization took place in 2003 with the establishment of the Worldwide
Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) (http://www.wwpdb.org/ (accessed 24 April 2022)
by Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/ (accessed
24 April 2022)), Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj) (https://pdbj.org/ (accessed 24
April 2022)), and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) (https://bmrb.io/
(accessed 24 April 2022).
Another protein database with information on peptide sequences, protein
sequences, and functions can be found in UNI-Prot (Universal Protein Resource,
https://beta.uniprot.org/ (accessed 24 April 2022)) [8].
An analog database for 3D structures of nucleic acidsisthe Nucleic Acid Database
(NDB), founded in 1992, in which sequences, structures, and functions can be
searched freely (http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/ (accessed 24 April 2022)) [9].
The development of a new database with additional information on sequences,
functions, and interactions of nucleic acids was described in 2018 through a col￾laboration between Rutgers University NDB and Bowling Green State University
(RNAhub services). The NDB isto be replaced under the name Nucleic Acid Knowl￾edge Base (NAKB) [10].
Another source for information on nucleosides and nucleotides is the DNA Data
Bank of Japan (DDBJ, https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp (accessed 24 April 2022)) [11].10.1 Academic vs. Industrial Research 305
A European archive is The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, https://www.ebi
.ac.uk/ena/ (accessed 24 April 2022)) in which data can be stored and information
can be searched for [12].
An overview of all existing targets, signaling pathways and ligands can be found
in the DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/ (accessed 24 April 2022)) [13].
Another database on binding affinities, ligand–target interactions, and pathways
is the Binding Database (bindingDB, http://bindingdb.org/bind/index.jsp (accessed
24 April 2022)). BindingDB contains 249,5891 binding data for 8813 receptors and
10,711,154 small molecules [14].
Not only the structure of the receptors is relevant for development, but the struc￾ture of the ligands must also be considered. For drugs with chiral centers, knowledge
of the exact structure of stereoisomers (enantiomers, diastereomers, and racemates)
is extremely important for biological function. Biologically active racemates are com￾posed of two enantiomers that can have different biological effects. The eutomer
represents the active form, and the distomer represents the less active form. The
absolute configuration is determined by X-ray structure analysis, and the results of
these investigations are publicly available.
Established in 1965, the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) contains over
one million 3D structures of small organic and organometallic molecules deter￾mined by X-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction (https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/
solutions/csd-core/components/csd/ (accessed 24 April 2022)) [15]. A total of
50,000 new structures are added to CSD every year.
Another database for organic, inorganic, metal–organic compounds, and min￾erals is the Crystallography Open Database (COD) in which 487,565 structures of
molecules are available (http://www.crystallography.net/cod/ (Accessed 24 April
2022)) [16].
After a successful target validation, it is necessary to establish an appropriate
assay in order to test a large number of compounds in a high-throughput process
(high-throughput screening, HTS) with the aim of identifying biologically active
substances (hit-finding).
The substances that are screened in the substance libraries in the HTS consist of
compounds synthesized in-house, external syntheses from cooperation with CROs,

There is a specific assay for each target to determine the inhibitory or activating
properties of a substance.
The ChEMBL or ChEMBLdb database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/(accessed
April 25 2022) provides an overview of the known and available assays. ChEMBL is
a chemical database of biologically active substances with drug-like properties. Cur￾rently, 299,151 assays can be accessed and downloaded in the form of report cards,
including references and patents [17].
The world’s largest database of information on chemical compounds and their
physical and biological properties, safety data, and toxicological data is PubChem
(https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ (accessed 25 April 2022)) [18]. There are
111 million compounds, 280 million substances, and 295 million bioactivities
available. Biological and toxicological data can be searched at PubChem BioAssays
(https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassays (accessed 25 April 2022)) [19].
Pharos (https://pharos.nih.gov/ (accessed 25 April 2022)) is a National Institutes
of Health (NIH) sponsored Knowledge Management Center (KMC) database for
Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG). It includes 20,412 targets, information
on 13,704 diseases, and 339,220 ligands [20].
Natural products are a reliable source as lead structures for the development of
new drugs. COlleCtion of Open Natural ProdUcTs (COCONUT), https://coconut
.naturalproducts.net/(accessed 25 April 2022)) is a freely accessible database on nat￾ural products [21]. The database lists 407,270 searchable natural substances, which
are also available for download as sd files.
The results of an HTS run are the basis for further procedure in the projects. A
precise analysis of the found active molecules (hits) such as structure, compound
class, and patent status is important in order to develop lead structures. The aim
of lead structure optimization is to improve the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic,
and toxicological properties in order to avoid the risk of possible side effects and to
improve bioavailability.
The most common reason for the occurrence of side effects is the insufficient
drug metabolism, the pharmacokinetic profile (DMPK), and the formation of reac￾tive metabolites [22]. When creating a DMPK profile, absorption, the stability and
structure of formed metabolites, and inhibition or activation of cytochrome peroxi￾dase P450 (CYP) are taken into account [23]. Furthermore, the metabolic enzymes
sulfotransferases (SULTs) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) play an impor￾tant role in the in vivo degradation of drugs. Data and information on the enzymes,
metabolitesinvolved, and their biological and toxicological data can be found in sev￾eral Open-Access databases.
The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) (https://hmdb.ca/ (accessed 25 April
2022)) was established by the Human Metabolome Project and isfunded by Genome
Canada [24]. HMBD contains 220,945 entries for chemical, biological, biochemi￾cal, and molecular biology data and also 8610 enzyme and transporter sequences.10.1 Academic vs. Industrial Research 307

During a research and development project, it is not only important to follow
the preclinical advances, but also the clinical development. After a potential drug
candidate clears the hurdle into the clinic, clinical trials take place to test efficacy,
improved efficacy over known therapies,side effects, and safety in humans. The clin￾ical studies are carried out by pharmaceutical companies and commissioned study
centers [33].
The US National Library of Medicine tracks and documents planned, ongoing,
and completed trialsthatreceive public or private funding (https://clinicaltrials.gov/
(accessed 26 June 2022)). To date, 419,313 studies have been documented in 220
countries. On the homepage, it is possible to perform a simple or an advanced search
for tested substance, indication, therapy, and status of the study (Schemes 10.3
and 10.4).
A European database variant, the EU Clinical Trials Register (https://www

10.2 Scaffold-Hopping
The aim of medicinal chemistry is to synthesize new active ingredients with
improved properties. One method is scaffold hopping or rescaffolding, in which
the basic structure of a known active ingredient is changed or replaced [34]. This
method is very similarto the bioisoster approach, but instead of replacing individual
atoms or functional groups, the central scaffold is replaced. Through this exchange,
a higher activity toward the receptor is to be achieved, the ADME-Tox profile is to
be improved in order to reduce side effects. It is also possible to circumvent existing
patent protection, such as the example of the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor
Sildenafil 1 from Pfizer, which was approved in 1998 under the name Viagra®.
Chemically, sildenafil is a 1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7(4H)-one.

In 2003, Bayer AG received approval for its PDE5 inhibitor Vardenafil,
which was marketed under the name Levitra®. The new core structure is an
imidazo[5,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4(3H)-one, which allowed Bayer to circumvent patent
protection on sildenafil.
Scaffold hopping can be simplified and accelerated by using computer-assisted
methods. The commercial software ReCore was developed by the company
BioSolveIT (https://www.biosolveit.de/ (accessed 27 April 2022)) [35].
When searching for a new scaffold, a drug molecule (e.g. COX2 inhibitor cele￾coxib 3) is imported into ReCore. By designating cleavage sites on the pyrazole
backbone at positions 1 and 5, the two substituents are fixed. ReCore’s algorithm10.3 Virtual-Screening 311

10.3 Virtual-Screening
Another method of computer-aided drug design (CADD)in the search for new active
ingredientsisin-silico or virtualscreening (VS)[36].In this computer-based method,
compound libraries are searched to identify new structures that are suitable for fur￾ther investigation and development [37]. VS is used to:312 10 Open Access Databases – An Industrial View
● Finding substances from in-house databases for a HTS
● to order substances from external suppliers
● to decide which substances are synthesized.
Several open access databases are available for virtual screening [38]. A variety of
programs are used in the drug discovery process [39, 40].
