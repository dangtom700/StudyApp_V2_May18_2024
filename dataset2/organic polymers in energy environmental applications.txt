Preface
Polymers, natural orsynthetic, have changed the lifestyle of each individual through
their immense application in almost every field. The first polymer discovered (early
nineteenth century) was completely natural and derived from “Rubber” plants.
It was known to have been used by the indigenous people in South America for
centuries. Then, in 1839, Charles Goodyear successfully vulcanized the rubber
by cross-linking the polymeric chains that impart strength to it. The year 1907
marked a special achievement in producing the first synthetic polymer that
was resistant to heat and electric current and used in various materials. It was
named after the creator Leo Baekeland as “Bakelite.” Since then, there have been
a series of remarkable discoveries in this budding field: polyethylene (1930s),
nylon (1930s), polyester and PET (1940s), polypropylene (1950s), high-density
polyethylene (HDPE) (1950s), and polycarbonate (1950s), to name a few. Since
the mid-twentieth century, a significant advancement in polymer science and
engineering has occurred, leading to novel and improved polymeric materials and
applications. Although these polymers are of great use to humankind, they also
have an adverse impact on the environment as they are not biodegradable and
have been persistent for centuries. In the late twentieth century, the discovery of
biodegradable polymers revolutionizes polymeric research and science. In recent
years, research has focused on creating advanced polymers with unique properties,
such as conducting polymers for electronics, smart polymers, biodegradable
polymers, biopolymers advanced polymer blends and composites, 3D printing,
polymeric nanoparticles, and polymers for energy storage that respond to environ￾mental changes. The deployment of organic polymers has surpassed the traditional
applications and can be seen in advances in imaging technology such as bioimag￾ing, oil absorption, tissue engineering, and self-healing nanometer coatings in
automobile and domestic housing. The recent advancements in organic polymers
are expanding the range of applications and addressing important challenges,
including environmental sustainability and improved performance across various
industries.
The inception of this book was based on numerous applications and a plethora
of research advancements in this field. The add-on factor of biodegradability toxxii Preface
polymers has motivated us to dive into the depth of the knowledge. With this
view, we attempted to comprehend the subject matter for our audience, includ￾ing students, researchers, academicians, and scientists. The editors Dr. Ramesh
Oraon (Central University of Jharkhand), Dr. Pardeep Singh (Delhi University),
Dr. Sanchayita Rajkhowa (Haflong Govt. College, Assam, India), Dr. Sangita
Agarwal (RCC Institute of Information Technology, Kolkata), and Dr. R.P. Singh
(Central Public Works Dept., New Delhi) were keen to publish a handy material
on this burning topic with elaborate details starting from its history, development,
applications, and future aspects.
Chapter 1 starts with a basic introduction and history of organic polymers. It also
offers a comprehensive summary of the basis of polymerization methodologies for
synthesizing organic polymers, with recent developments describing the various
applications of such materials. Functionalization and characterization of organic
polymers demonstrate that the generation of hydrogels and their rheological
properties were significantly influenced by the alteration of carboxylates in high
molecular mass heparin (HMWH) with various maleimide groups and with
thiol-derivatization of PEG crosslinker. In Chapter 2, the progress of porous organic
polymers (POPs) as a potential catalyst in various applications like water splitting,
CO2 capture, and degradation of organic pollutants, among others, along with
the various synthetic processes of POP catalysts as well as their properties and
potential applications, are broadly discussed. The subsequent chapters 3, 4, 10, 14
and 18 comprehensively understand organic polymers in photodetectors, energy
storage and solar cells, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, drug delivery systems, etc.
There is a great emphasis on green synthesis of organic polymers and their appli￾cation in environmental remediation (Chapter 11). Another chapter (Chapter 22)
provides information about the history, the current research scenario, and the
future scope of organic polymer-based adhesives. Owing to their diverse functions
and utility, there is a blossoming resurgence of modified polymers in science
and technology. In this regard, the methods of polymeric surface modification
and their applications, along with the prospects in the future, are also discussed
(Chapter 5). A few chapters(Chapters 9, 13, 20, 21 and 24) discuss organic polymers’
current and developing trends in various fields, while another includes the future
roadmap of POPs (Chapters 19 and 23). Organic polymers are a fundamental
part of modern society, and their diverse properties and applications make them
a crucial area of scientific and industrial research. Advances in polymer science
continue to drive innovation in various industries, from materials engineering to
medicine.
Through thisjourney, we hope to provide ourreaders with a deeper understanding
of organic polymers, their applications, and recent trendsthat navigate to the future.

1.1 Introduction and History of Polymers
The word polymer is derived from the Greek word “polumeros” where “Polus”
means “many” and “meros” means “units.” Henceforth polymers can be defined
as the complex and giant molecules or “macromolecules” which are supposed
to form by the combination of many small repeating molecules called monomers.
Examples of some commercially important polymers and their practical applica￾tions have been highlighted in Table 1.1. The most practical distinguishing feature
of polymer from its monomer is its huge difference in physical, chemical, and
mechanical properties after the polymerization process occurs (Dorel 2008). For
example, ethene is a gas but when they combine with each other via the polymer￾ization process, a new class of compound, i.e., polyethene, is formed which differs
from its monomer in terms of many physicochemical properties. Monomers being
smaller have low molecular weight, while polymers being much larger have very
high molecular weight. Compared to simple organic molecules, polymers aren’t
composed of identical molecules; hence, a polymer sample generally comprises
chains of different lengths, which is why their molecular weight is always expressed
as an average molecular weight. For instance, the HDPE (high-density polyethy￾lene) molecules are all long-chain carbon chains, but the lengths generally vary by
thousands of monomer units. Depending on the type of monomeric units, polymers
may be of different types such as homopolymers where all the repeating units (RUs)
are same and co-polymers which can be made up of two or more monomer species.
For example, in case of homopolymers such as polythene the monomer unit is
ethylene, in polyvinylchloride (PVC) the monomer unit is vinyl chloride. Important
examples of co-polymers include polyethylene-vinyl acetate (PEVA), nitrile rubber,
and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) which are formed by the combination of
more than one monomer.
Based on the type of backbone chain and composition, polymeric materials
are classified into two types, viz. organic polymers and inorganic polymers

(Currell and Frazer 1969; Gowarikar et al. 2022). Basically, organic polymers are
made of carbon-carbon backbone skeleton (Peng et al. 2017), while inorganic poly￾mers do not have carbon-carbon skeleton, rather they have a skeleton like Si–Si for
polysilanes, Si–O for polysiloxanes, Si–N for polysilazanes, S–S for polysulfides, B–N
for polyborazylenes, and S–N for polythiazyls (Seth 2020; Indra and Shrray 2015).
Cellulose is one of the most abundant organic polymers on Earth, and it is a linear
polymer of as many as 10,000 dextro-glucose units joined with each other. Starch,
belonging to carbohydrates, can be found in grains and potatoes. Starch is a polymer,
also known as a polysaccharide because it is made from glucose as monosaccharide.
Starch molecules include two types of glucose polymers, amylose and amylopectin.
Amylopectin, being a major starch component, is found in many plants. Amylose
belongs to a linear-chain polymer having around two hundred glucose molecules
per molecule.
Based on the existence and method of formation, organic polymers may be fur￾ther categorized as natural or synthetic, and interestingly both of them find equal
attention in our day-to-day life. Natural organic polymers can be found in nature or
living system and important examples of natural organic polymers include proteins
or polypeptides, polynucleotides like DNA and RNA (DNA is a double-stranded
polynucleotide chain, while RNA is a single-chain structure of polynucleotides),
silk, wool, cellulose, natural rubber. Synthetic polymers are man-made polymers
which are being synthesized in the industry or laboratory. Important examples of
synthetic polymers include polyethylene (both low-density polyethylene – LDPE
and high-density polyethylene – HDPE), polypropene (PP), polyacrylonitrile (PAN),
polyaniline (PANI), polystyrene (PS), polyvinylchloride (PVC), tetrafluoroethene
(Teflon), polyacetylene, nylon, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and Bakelite.
Most of the synthetic polymers possess enhanced lifetime and improved mechanical4 1 Organic Polymers: Past and the Present
properties. However due to the absence of a functional group in most of them,
they do not have some important physical and chemical properties which limit
their synthetic utility in many practical applications. To address this problem
post-synthetic functionalization and further modification of polymers have been
done in recent times to achieve multinational properties.
During the fifteenth century, Christopher Columbus was involved in the discov￾ery of rubber by isolating it from trees, and later Joseph Priestly observed that the
material is helpful for erasing pencil marks on paper. This observation launched
the rubber industry. Combining the latex of rubber tree with the morning glory
plant juice in various proportions helped to achieve rubber’s distinct properties for
designing selective products like bouncing balls, various kinds of rubber bands,
etc. To gain the advantages and properties of both natural and synthetic polymers,
researchers across the globe were always in search for the development of improved
semi-synthetic organic polymers. For example, vulcanization of rubber was intro￾duced for enhancing the quality of natural rubber where a small amount of sulfur
is added as a cross-linking agent which can enhance the quality and stability of
rubber. Vulcanized rubber is comparatively stronger, elastic, more resistant to
abrasion and temperature change, and most importantly inert with respect to
chemicals and electric current as compared to untreated natural rubber (Brown
and Poon 2005).
Likewise, natural resources polymeric materials like cellulose and proteins
have been extensively used for making improved polymers via copolymerization
techniques.
Henri Braconnot’s Braconnot, Christian Schönbein, and coworkers in 1830s
first developed the derivatives of cellulose for constructing novel semi-synthetic
materials, known as celluloid and cellulose acetate. Later the term “polymer”
was introduced in 1833 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius, even though Berzelius could not
provide significant contribution for the development of modern polymer science.
In 1909, Leo Baekeland developed Bakelite from cheap and readily available
chemicals such as phenol and formaldehyde which opened the door of emerging
technology for designing many innovative polymeric products (Baekeland 1909;
Wallace 1945).
In spite of the noteworthy developments in polymer synthesis, the molecular
nature of polymers was not clear until the concept was introduced by Hermann
Staudinger in the year 1922. Earlier formation of polymers was explained via aggre￾gation theory proposed by Thomas Graham in 1861. According to Graham, cellulose
and other polymers were supposed to have colloidal nature where aggregation of
small molecules having smaller molecular masses was joined by some unknown
intermolecular force. Later, Hermann Staudinger first anticipated that polymers
consist of long chains of atoms held together by some covalent bonds. Staudinger,
for his immense contribution in providing concepts to understand about polymeric
structure, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in the year 1953.
During the period of World War II there had been an increased demand of natural
polymers such as silk and rubber. But due to their limited supply, alternative syn￾thetic polymers such as nylon were introduced to meet the essential requirements.1.1 Introduction and History of Polymers 5
Then, the invention of advanced polymeric materials like Kevlar and Teflon became
eye-catching to launch the robust polymer industry.
The most important properties of a reactant to be a monomer or to take part in
polymerization reaction are (i) presence of reactive functional group and (ii) the
minimum requirement of bifunctionality. Depending upon the nature of function￾ality, for example, bi- or tri-functionality, the polymers may be designed as chain
polymers, blocked or cross-linked polymers, respectively. For the synthesis of poly￾mers, various methods such as addition polymerization, condensation polymeriza￾tion, and co-ordination polymerization have been employed.In most of the synthetic
procedures use of catalyst, initiator, application of high pressure and temperatures
are the important requirements to assist rapid polymerization process.
Due to the great demand of polymeric materials in day-to-day life, many
researchers across the globe are working in this field, and hence Nobel Prize
has been awarded to many scientists for the development of this particular field.
Karl Ziegler (1898–1973) and Giulio Natta (1903–1979) independently developed
catalysts which smoothly assist polymerization under ambient condition with high
stereospecificity to furnish isotactic polypropylene (i-PP) and HDPE. In the year
1963, Giulio Natta and Karl Ziegler were jointly awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry
for their immense contributions in the area of polymer science. Next, Flory was
awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 for his important contribution in both
theoretical and experimental development of polymer science. In the year 2000,
Alan G. MacDiarmid, Alan J. Heeger, and Hideki Shirakawa were jointly awarded
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on conductive polymers which provide
significant contributionsin the advancement of molecular electronics.John Bennett
Fenn, Koichi Tanaka, and Kurt Wüthrich were awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry in
the year 2002 for their innovative methods in identification and structural analysis
of biological macromolecules. Robert Grubbs, Richard Schrock, and Yves Chauvin
were awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry in the year 2005 for the development of
olefin metathesis also known as ring-opening metathesis polymerization reaction
(ROMP). The use of Ru-based Grub’s catalyst for polymerization gained significant
popularity in recent past. Some of the major breakthroughs that evolved during the
development of polymer science have been depicted in Table 1.2.
Even though polymeric materials have important applications, their non-bio￾degradability always poses a threat to the surroundings. For example, polyethene
compounds cannot be broken down by the bacteria present in the soil, and
due to constant accumulation of these materials soil and water pollution arises.
To solve this particular problem, extensive study is going on around the world
for the development of biodegradable polymers which are also considered as
green polymers. One important example of biodegradable polymers is poly
β-hydroxybutyrate-co-β-hydroxy valerate (PHBV) which can be prepared by the
combination of 3-hydroxy butanoic acid and 3-hydroxy pentanoic acid.
Recently polymer matrix composites (PMCs) have been introduced which
possess a wide range of potential applications (Tewatia et al. 2017; Ramakrishna
et al. 2001). PMCs are polymers reinforced with additives such as glass fibers,
carbon fibers, carbon nanofibers, graphene, and carbon nanotubes. They have been6 1 Organic Polymers: Past and the Present

widely employed because of the magical enhancements of mechanical, thermal,
and electrical properties associated with this special type of material. Presently,
researchers are looking for intelligent polymers which are specially designed
materials that can extend the scope of polymer science.
1.2 Classification of Organic Polymers
Polymers are divided primarily into organic polymers and inorganic polymers based
on the nature of backbone chain. Primarily, organic polymers are made up of carbon
backbone structures, while inorganic polymers do not have carbon atoms in their
backbone. Organic polymers are suitable for several applications because of their
simple structures and biodegradable nature, which make them environmentally
friendly. Nevertheless hybrid polymers like “silicones,” which are organosilicon
polymers or polysiloxanes, are also well known because of their potential industrial
applicability. Silicones found wide applications because of the presence of strong1.2 Classification of Organic Polymers 7
carbon-silicon (C—Si) bonds. The formation takes place in a few steps,starting from
the alkylation/arylation of a silicon tetrachloride and finally resulting in silicones,
R2(SiO)n. Here “R” represents an alkyl/aryl group. Silicones found commercial
applications mainly under three category namely fluids, elastomers, and resins
(Zielecka et al. 2002).
It is well known that most of the polymers are built up via two organic-chemistry￾based mechanisms. One is addition/chain and the another is condensation/
step-growth polymerization mechanism. Both of these mechanisms involve a
combination of small monomers or repeating units. The mechanism of polymer
formation results in either addition or chain polymers. Apart from this, polymers
are broadly classified based on their source, structure, molecular forces operating,
and thermal behavior (Kariduraganavar et al. 2014).
(a) Originally polymers were classified as either “natural or synthetic polymers.”
Natural polymers occur naturally, whereas synthetic polymers can be synthe￾sized artificially. Natural polymers are obtained from animals and plants. A few
examples include
(i) Proteins: Wool and naturalsilk are protein-based products. Proteins are the
building blocks of animal cells. The proteins are formed by the repetition
of α-amino acids (Figure 1.1).

(ii) Carbohydrate polysaccharides: Repetition of smaller monosaccharides
like “glucose” leads to the formation of macromolecules like cellulose and
starch, which constructs the plant cell. These biological molecules also
supply energy to animal cells (Figure 1.1).
(iii) Nucleic acids: “RNA” and “DNA” are the bio-polymers formed by the rep￾etition of nucleotides. These are the primary constituents of all living cells
(Figure 1.1).
(iv) Natural rubber: This is a well-known plant-extracted component. It is
present in the latex of rubber plant. It is also known as cis-polyisoprene,
which is a polymer of isoprene. However the trans-isomer is known as
“gutta-percha” (Figure 1.1).
On the other hand, most of the daily-use polymers are synthetic ones. This
covers a series of polyvinyl-based chain polymers like “polyvinylchloride”
and functional-group-based condensed polymers like “polyethyleneterephtha￾late.” A few examples are PVC, polyethylene, polystyrene, Teflon, synthetic
rubber, nylon-6, and nylon-66. Most of these are organic polymers. Moreover
“semi-synthetic polymers” also do exist. These are obtained by chemical
modification of natural polymers. For example, one of the important materials,
cellulose diacetate, is synthesized from cellulose by reacting with acetic
anhydride in the presence of sulfuric acid (Kamide 2005). It is formed by the
acetylation reaction. Some of the hydrogen atoms in cellulose are substituted
by acetyl (–COCH3) groups.
(b) Polymers are divided into three structural categories, namely, linear, branched,
and cross-linked polymers.
(i) Linear polymers are long straight-chain molecules with highly ordered
structures. Importantly, the randomness is comparatively less as the
monomers are linked together in linear fashion. Because of the linear
arrangement theirstructure is densely packed. Some of the characteristics,
like high densities, melting temperatures, and mechanical strengths, are
the result of this. Polyester and polyethylene belong to this category.
(ii) Branched one possessessecondary polymer chains connected to a primary
backbone, resulting in a branching-tree-like structure. The chains are
less well packed due to branching, which results in much lower melting
temperatures, densities, and mechanical strengths (Abuzreda 2023).
Branch-chain polymers can be created via condensation or addition poly￾merization methods. Examples include amylopectin, glycogen, LDPE,
and any rubbers that have been vulcanized.1.2 Classification of Organic Polymers 9
(iii) Network or more specifically the cross-linked polymers are formed by con￾necting two or more chains by cross-linking agents. The initially formed
linear polymeric chains are joined together to form a three-dimensional
network structure. The chain linkages give these polymers their hard,
stiff, and brittle characteristics. Condensation polymers are invariably
cross-linked polymers. A group of cross-linked polymers is known as
resins.
(c) Depending upon the mechanism of formation, polymers are classified into
addition and condensation polymers. Addition or chain reaction polymers
are formed by successive addition of monomers (small molecules). The
linked monomers are called “repeating units” (RUs). The RUs are joined
predominantly by covalent bonds. Their mechanism of formation is primarily
dependent upon the three steps: initiation, propagation, and termination. The
propagation step is responsible for getting high-molecular-weight polymers.
The molecular weight is an important property in polymer characterization.
“Polyethylene” is a chain polymer formed by the repetition of ethylene10 1 Organic Polymers: Past and the Present
monomers.
n(CH2=CH2) → (CH2 − CH2)n
Alternatively, condensation reaction between monomers bearing typical
functional groups like hydroxyl (–OH), carboxyl (–COOH), ester (–COOR),
and amide (–CONH2) results in the formation of condensed polymers. During
condensation reaction some small molecules like water or mineral acids are
released from the monomers by condensation. Polymerization proceeds by
successive formation of dimers, trimers, and tetramers. However the extent of
polymerization between them isimportant for having a high-molecular-weight
condensation polymer (Kariduraganavar et al. 2014). Nylon-6,6 is a common
example of condensation polymer. It is formed by the condensation of hexam￾ethylene diamine, NH2–(CH2)6–NH2, and adipic acid, COOH–(CH2)4–COOH.
The reaction takes place between a diamine and a dibasic acid. The two
monomers are linked by a peptide bond as shown in Figure 1.1. One of the
advantages here is that no initiator is required for the reaction.
(d) Elastomers and fibers are two subcategories of polymers that are determined
by the molecular forces between individual chains.
An elastomer is plastic and its polymeric chains are bounded by very weak van
der Waal forces. Because of such weak operating molecular forces, these poly￾mers are stretchable as well as compressible. They can be reverted back to their
earlier form. It is a randomly oriented amorphous polymer. Vulcanized rubber
is an elastomer that exhibits cross-linking by sulfur atoms. Such cross-linking
prevents the chains from slipping over one another.
However, due to the highly organized geometry and potent intermolecular
forces of attraction, fibers possess the highest tensile strength and negligible
elasticity. Fibers have a high melting point and low solubility, and are crys￾talline in nature. Fibers include polymers like cellulose, nylon, wool, and silk
(Abuzreda 2023).
(e) Polymers are divided into thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics based on
heat treatment. Interestingly most of organic macromolecules belong to these
categories.
Thermoplastics are a type of polymer that softens when heated and may take
on any shape when cooled. Thermoplastic polymers can undergo transition
from hardness to softness and vice versa. At normal temperature conditions,
they are hard. With increase in temperature, hardness decreases and they
become soft and viscous. The polymeric chains can slip over one another
during heating. When cooled, this material stiffens up after being soft and
viscous. Hence depending on temperature, thermoplastic polymers can be
molded into various shapes and products. Without affecting the chemical
identity and mechanical merits of the plastic, the heating, softening, and
cooling procedures can be performed as frequently as needed (Carothers
1929). They have highly ordered crystalline as well as less ordered amorphous
regions. Polyethylene, polycarbonate, polypropylene, Teflon, and PVC are a
few typical examples.1.2 Classification of Organic Polymers 11
When thermosetting polymers are heated, they undergo chemical transfor￾mation and cross-linking takes place, and when they are cooled, they become
permanently hard and infusible. Repeating heat treatment doesn’t cause them
to soften; instead, they degrade. These polymers undergo setting to only one
form during heat treatment. It cannot be converted back to the original form.
They become hard on heating and turn into a solid that cannot be re-melted
by changing the temperature (Carothers 1929). These polymers set into a
solid structure because of the existence of cross-linking. With rise in the
degree of cross-linking the rigidity also increases. Upon heating the hardness
increases due to extensive cross-linking. Moreover, cross-linking reduces the
mobility of the polymer chains, causing them to be relatively brittle. Common
examples of thermosetting polymers are phenol-formaldehyde resin and
urea-formaldehyde resin (Figure 1.2).
(f) In addition to these, organic polymers also categorized as conducting polymers
as they found promising applications in organic light-emitting diode (OLED),
semiconductors, and superconductors. Interestingly, the first conducting
polymer is an organic polymer, polypyrrole, as reported by Donald Weiss and
coworkers in 1960. Polypyrrole is a heterocyclic polymer containing carbon
and nitrogen atoms in its rings. Because of the conjugation of electrons in
their rings, they can act as conducting polymers. Conducive polymers’ most
important benefit is their processability, which is mostly attained through
dispersion (Saldívar-Guerra and Vivaldo-Lima 2013).
Conducting polymers can be further classified into intrinsically conducting
polymers, extrinsically conducting polymers or doped polymers.
Intrinsically conducting polymers: This class of polymers conducts electricity
due to the presence of delocalized electron pairs or conjugated π–bonds in

the structural frame. In a polymeric material with an electric field, the delo￾calized electrons can move across it. Coupled bands, valence bands, and
conduction bands are produced as a result of overlapping orbitals.
Semiconducting or impure polymers: Doping is a process by which conductivity
of materials can be enhanced by adding or doping some impurity. Impurity
means certain elements in their chemical form. Doping creates charge car￾riers in the polymer chain by either oxidation or reduction processes. The
common doping processes are p-doping and n-doping. Both involve creation
of positive holes and negative excess electrons by the redox processes.
1.3 Synthesis and Properties of Polymers
Polymer can be synthesized by two ways: (i) polymerization of the monomeric units
and (ii) chemical modification of monomeric side chain of the polymer. Through
the first method molecular weight can be increased, whereas the second method
will change the structure of the molecule without molecular weight variation.
The chemical process which converts molecules into polymer macromolecules
is known as polymerization. This process is the combination of different reactions
which determine the features of the product. The properties of the obtained macro￾molecules are also dependent on the chemical composition of the starting materials.
This chapter will mainly cover the synthesis of polymers by using different polymer￾ization processes. Basically there are two types of polymerization processes: viz. step
growth or condensation polymerization and addition polymerization.
Step Growth Polymerization is one type of polymerization process in which
bi-functional or multifunctional monomers react to form first dimers, then trimers,
longer oligomers, and eventually long-chain polymers. Through this step growth
polymerization, many naturally occurring as well as synthetic polymers can be
obtained. For example, polyamides, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyurethanes,
epoxy resin, and phenol formaldehyde resin.
1.3.1 Polyamides
Nylon is a generic designation for a family of synthetic polyamides. Nylon, silk-like
thermoplastics have significant applicationsin fabric, fibers,shapes, films, etc. Many
synthetic polyamides, including nylon-6,6, nylon-6, nylon-6,10, and nylon-11, are
well-known. The synthetic methods of some of the polyamides are discussed below.
1.3.2 Nylon-6,6
Hexamethylene diamine and adipic acid (Hexan-1,6-dioic acid) are co-polymers in
it. Benzene, a byproduct of petroleum refining and cracking, is the primary raw
material used in the manufacture of nylon-6,6. Adipic acid serves as the precursor
once more in the creation of hexamethylene diamine. The synthesis of nylon-6,6 is
shown in Scheme 1.1 (Gowarikar et al. 2022).1.3 Synthesis and Properties of Polymers 13

forces give these fibers a more crystalline structure and provide them great
strength, flexibility, and a high melting point.
➢ Nylons are chemically stable and resistant to abrasion.
➢ The yarn is smooth, long lasting, and can be spun into fabric.
➢ The fabric can withstand heat and steam and is strong, glossy, moisture￾resistant, simple to dye, and retains color.
1.3.4 Polyesters
Polyester is a class of polymer in which an ester functional group is present in
every repeating unit of the polymer chain. Some polyesters are naturally occurring
compounds found in plants and insects, some are synthetic compounds like poly￾butyrate. But it most frequently refers to a type of substance known as polyethylene
terephthalate as a specific material (PET). Biodegradable polyesters include some
synthetic as well as some natural varieties; however, the majority of synthetic
polyesters are not biodegradable. Synthetic polyester is extensively used in cloth
industry.
1.3.5 Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)
The most popular thermoplastic polymer of the polyester family is PET. This is used
in clothing fibers, food and liquid storage containers, thermoforming for manufac￾turing, and in combination with glass fiber for engineering resins (Cann and Con￾nelly 2000). There are two strategies for the synthesis of PET. The first method is the
direct reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol which is mentioned
below in Scheme 1.3a. PET is commercially known as Terylene.

exchange of a diester and a diol. This is a transesterification reaction in which one
ester is transformed into another.
By this method, PET issynthesized by the reaction between dimethylterephthalate
and ethylene glycol as shown in Scheme 1.3b (Gowarikar et al. 2022).
Terylene’s properties:
➢ It offers excellent mechanical strength and stability in its dimensions.
➢ It has a very high strength and will only slightly lose strength when wet.
➢ It is elastic by nature, stable in the temperature range of −40 to 100 ∘C, and has
good insulating qualities as well as creep and abrasion resistance.
➢ It exhibits little water absorption and is resistant to water, diluted acids, salts,
aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, and alcohols at room temperature.
1.3.6 Polycarbonates
Polycarbonates are a type of thermoplastic polymers featuring a carbonate group
in their structure. As this type of polymer can be worked, molded, and thermo￾formed easily, so it has a variety of applications. The very important polycarbonate
Lexan is produced by the reaction of bisphenol A (BPA) and phosgene COCl2 in
dichloromethane by using phase transfer catalyst as shown in Scheme 1.4. High
impact and tensile strength, tough translucent polymer Lexan retains its shape over
a wide temperature range.It is utilized in athletic goodslike catcher’s masksfor base￾ball and hockey as well as bicycle, football, and snowmobile helmets. Moreover, it is
employed in the manufacture of safety and unbreakable windows.

1.3.7 Polyurethanes
An immensely versatile class of polymers known as polyurethanes is used in insu￾lators, foams, elastomers, synthetic skins, coatings, adhesives, and other products.
Polyurethanes have improved the quality of modern life. The building blocks
of polyurethanes alternate between hard urethane units and flexible polyester
or polyether units. The more flexible urethane blocks are made from low-MW
polyesters or polyethers that include –OH groups at the ends of each polymer chain,
whereas the rigid urethane blocks are made from a diisocyanate. Dr. Otto Bayer and
his coworkers first synthesized polyurethane by simple diisocyanate polyaddition
procedures (Janik et al. 2014). It achieved industrial-scale synthesis in 1937, and
by the 1950s, it had become a market staple. A urethane linkage distinguishes
polyurethanes, and they are easy to synthesize via an addition reaction between
alcohol and an isocyanate. The synthesis of polyurethanes is shown in Scheme 1.5.16 1 Organic Polymers: Past and the Present

1.3.7.1 Properties of Polyurethanes
Molecular weight between cross-links and the number of segments in a stiff
sequence are the key factors affecting polyurethanes’ thermal characteristics. Long
alkyl chains, aromatic groups, branching and cross-linking, as well asthe strength of
the secondary bonding forces, all have a significant impact on mechanical qualities
like elongation break, rip strength, and tensile strength. The types of polyols and
isocyanates that are used to create polyurethane have a significant impact on its
chemical characteristics.
Some key properties of polyurethanes are mentioned below:
➢ Good abrasion resistance
➢ Good impact resistance
➢ Good toughness
➢ Low viscosity
➢ High elongation
➢ Good flexibility
➢ Good tear strength
➢ Low shrinkage
➢ Hydrolytically stable
1.3.8 Epoxy Resin
Epoxy resins, a very significant group of thermosetting polymers, are extensively
used in aircraftstructures because of their low shrinkage and low release of volatiles
during curing, high strength, and good durability in hot and moist environments
(Januszewski et al. 2021). Thistype ofresins can be produced in different formsrang￾ing from low-viscosity liquids to high-melting solids. The most widely used epoxide
monomer, diepoxide, is prepared by the treatment of 1 mol of bisphenol A with 2 mol
of epichlorohydrin. This on further reaction with diamine gives the resin. The syn￾thetic route is depicted below in Scheme 1.6.
1.3.8.1 Properties of Epoxy Resin
Epoxies are compatible with the majority of substrates. They are particularly well
suited for composite applications since they have a tendency to moisten surfaces
easily. Epoxy resin can also be used to modify some polymers like polyurethane or
unsaturated polyesters in order to improve their physical and chemical properties.
Some other properties are listed below:

1.3.9 Phenol Formaldehyde Resin
The condensation polymer phenol-formaldehyde resins can be synthesized by
the polycondensation reaction between phenol and formaldehyde in the presence
of acidic or basic catalyst. These are thermosetting polymers. They were the first
commercialsynthetic resins prepared by Baekeland, an American chemist who gave
the name Bakelite. Electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction between phenol and
formaldehyde in the presence of a mineral acid like HCl produces o-hydroxymethyl
phenol and p-hydroxymethylphenol, which are the actual monomers. This is
the initial stage of the mechanism of polymerization. A linear (straight-chain)
polymer known as Novolak is produced when only one type of monomers, such
as o-hydroxymethylphenol, react together in a head-to-tail fashion. However, if
cross-polymerization occurs with a certain amount of polysubstituted phenol,
Bakelite – a strongly cross-linked polymer – is produced. The reaction for preparing
Bakelite is depicted in Scheme 1.7
1.3.9.1 Properties of Phenol Formaldehyde Resin
Phenol formaldehyde is a synthetic resin made from phenol and formaldehyde. It
is thermosetting in nature. It is used to make products such as adhesives, coatings,
and molded products. Some of the key properties of phenol-formaldehyde resin are
high strength,resistance to chemicals and solvents, low flammability, and good ther￾mal stability. Novolak is a solid and stable resin. It has good solvent and chemical
resistance. It is electrically insulated with good dielectric resistance.
Chain growth or addition polymerization is a type of polymerization pro￾cess which involves adding monomers sequentially that are either unsaturated or
have additional reactive functional groups. Carbocations, carbanions, radicals, and
organometallic complexes are just a few examples of the reaction intermediates that
are produced during this kind of polymerization. This chain growth polymerization
proceedsthrough chain initiation, propagation, and termination steps. The synthesis
of some of the important addition polymers is mentioned below.18 1 Organic Polymers: Past and the Present

Polyethene, a simple and extensively used homopolymer, is synthesized by the addi￾tion polymerization of single monomer ethylene. The reaction for preparation of

used to explain the mechanism. The ethene monomer produces a π-complex by first
attacking the catalyst surface (Ti). It then produces a transition state by partially
using its π-electrons and interacting with the alkyl group. In the end, the Ti-alkyl
link breaks, leading to the formation of bonds between the monomer and the alkyl
group and between the monomer and Ti. Schemes 1.9 and 1.10 describe the process
and mechanism of synthesizing polyethylene utilizing Ziegler–Natta catalysts.

Polyethenes can be broadly categorized into two types
(i) LDPE
(ii) HDPE
Very-LDPE is produced using a free radical process at 80–350 ∘C, high pressures
of 1000–3000 atm, and the presence of oxygen or peroxide.
Properties:
➢ It is a transparent waxy substance with superior electrical insulating qualities, a
low brittleness temperature, film transparency, and strong impact strength.
➢ It is chemically inert and has good resistance to acids and alkalis. However, it
swells and is permeable to oils.
➢ It melts in temperature range of 107–120 ∘C. Its glass transition temperature (Tg)
value is −120 ∘C.
➢ It is flexible over a wide temperature range.
HDPE can be prepared by the coordination polymerization using Ziegler–Natta
catalyst, but it can also be prepared by the ionic mechanism at low temperatures of
60–70 ∘C and very low pressures of 6–7. HDPE is a linear polymer with little to no
branching.20 1 Organic Polymers: Past and the Present
Properties:
➢ It is opaque and haslessimpactstrength, but better barrier propertiesthan LDPE.
➢ It has better chemical resistance than LDPE.
➢ It melts in temperature range of 130–138 ∘C. Its glass transition temperature is
−20 ∘C.
➢ It exhibits better stiffness, toughness, tensile strength, and heat resistance.

PVC can be classified into two classes:
(a) Unplasticized PVC
(b) Plasticized PVC
PVC-R or PVC-U, often known as rigid or unplasticized PVC, is a strong, rigid
material that is also chemically resistant and naturally flame retardant. To make
plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC-P) more flexible, several chemical substances
known as plasticizers have been added to the polymer.
Properties:
➢ It is a substance that is chemically inert, colorless, odorless, and very resistant to
acids and alkalis. Plasticized PVC is less chemically resistant than unplasticized
PVC, nevertheless.
➢ PVC is now replacing conventional building materialslike wood, metal, and con￾crete because of its versatile properties, including its lightweight nature, durabil￾ity, and ease of processing. It is also resistant to atmospheric oxygen or oxidation.
It also has greater stiffness and rigidity than polyethene.
1.3.13 Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), also known as Teflon, is a homopolymer and its
monomer unit is tetrafluoroethylene. It is also a thermoplastic polymer. This is typ￾ically synthesized through the use of peroxide or ammonium persulfate as initiators
in the emulsion polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene. The procedure for preparing
Teflon is depicted in Scheme 1.12.1.3 Synthesis and Properties of Polymers 21
Properties:
➢ It is a polymer with a high degree of crystallinity (93–98%).
➢ It is extremely resistant to chemicals.
➢ Almost none of the solvents can dissolve it, and neither water nor oil can
moisten it.

General applications of organic polymers are discussed in the following section.
1.3.14 Application of Natural Polymers
Organic polymers, either synthetic or natural, are crucial for everyday life. The nat￾ural polymers primarily belong to proteins and polysaccharides. Both categories are
either plant based or animal based. The existing polysaccharides however are also
bacteria based (e.g., Dextran), fungi based (e.g., pullulan), and algae based (e.g., algi￾nate) (McChesney et al. 2007) (Figure 1.3).
Natural polymers are the building blocks of most of the living things providing
basic structural materials and participating in vital life processes. For example, the
polymers cellulose and starch are the primary construction units of a plant. Natural
fiberssuch as cotton are made up of cellulose.Cellulose is a linear polymer of glucose
units, an abundant organic polymer on Earth.Cellulose has gained immense techno￾logical importance in recent days.Cellulose assuch being waterinsoluble findssome
technological barrier in applications (Guo et al. 1998). So numerous chemical mod￾ifications have been carried out upon cellulose, resulting in cellulose derivatives.

These derivatives found good industrial importance because of their water-soluble
properties. As an example, etherification results in cellulose ethers, which are water
soluble in nature. Cellulose ethers are important materialsin pharmaceutical indus￾try because of their hydrophilicity and good swelling properties. Apart from this,
cellulose and its derivatives are versatile components in many industries such as
veterinary foods, wood and paper, fibers and clothes, body care, cosmetics, paint, and
coatings(Dumitriu 1996).Cellulose ethers and cellulose esters, which are derivatives
of cellulose, exhibit different physicochemical and mechanical properties. Informa￾tion about a few important semi-synthetic derivatives like methyl cellulose, cellu￾lose nitrates, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and ethyl (hydroxyethyl) cellulose is
noteworthy to mention here because of their tremendous applications.

The carbohydrate, starch, is a natural polymer formed by the repetition of glucose
units. The breakdown ofstarch in our body releases energy. At the same time,starch
is a raw material for bioplasticsin industry. Processing ofstarch with plasticizers can
increase its mechanical strength ((Gajre)Kulkarni et al. 2012). In general, starch is
an important gradient of food/bakery industry, paper, and textile mills. Polysaccha￾rides are important analogues of cosmetic industries. Starch nanoparticles possess
anti-inflammatory properties, which are essential in drug designing.
Natural-polymer-based hydrogels seek research attention for their applications in
food industry and agriculture. Hydrogels that can absorb large amount of water can
exist either naturally or synthesized. Natural-polymer-loaded drugs find effective
treatment of various kinds of diseases. As an example, chitosan-loaded ascorbic
acid was found effective against cervical cancer. Polymeric nanoparticles especially
derived from natural polymers are mostly used in controlled drug-delivery systems
because of their certain pharmaceutically acceptable properties like biocompat￾ibility, bioadhesion capacity, low cost, availability, and lack of toxicity (Pandey
and Khuller 2004). The polymeric nanoparticles can act in controlled drug-release
systems in addition to drug carriers. Proteins, for example, collagen and gelatin
are suitable candidates for development of drug-delivery systems because of their
stability under different conditions of pH and ionic strength.
Our food primarily consists of the natural polymers, polysaccharides, and
proteins. A small amount of polynucleotides (DNA and RNA) is also involved
in the cellular part. Proteins are the source of amino acids in our body and have
high water-holding capacity. The creation and stabilization of food structures is1.3 Synthesis and Properties of Polymers 23
dependent upon the polymers used. Moreover the physiological and biological
function of food also relies upon the nature of polymer used. Most of the emulsifiers
and stabilizers used in food industry are natural polymers (Adelmann et al. 2012).
During food formulation, they stabilize the emulsion droplets and foams. Polymers
are also applied as thickeners in food processing to increase the viscosity of the
food. A few of the natural polymers can act as gelling agents or can form gels. A
gel is a 3D network formed by cross-linking of polymer chains, trapping the water
molecules and making them flow resistant. The textural properties of food (such as
chewy or creamy) depend on the type and concentration of gel-forming polymers
used during food formulation. Interestingly, natural polymers can also develop the
bioavailability of vitamins (Guo et al. 1998). Essential nutrients undergo degrada￾tion by the action of heat, light, and oxygen. Polymers in this context can protect
those by enhancing stability and strength. The antioxidative and antimicrobial
functions of certain natural polymers place them in food formulations.
One of the important natural polymers is “natural rubber” that finds enormous
application in our daily life. The polymerization of isoprene results in natural rub￾ber. Isoprene is chemically 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene. Its polymerization resultsin two
geometrical isomers. One is “cis” and the otheris “trans.” These are chemistry terms.
The “cis” isomer is known as “natural rubber” or cis-1,4-polyisoprene (Flory 1953).
Interestingly one another isomer “neoprene” is a synthetic rubber.
Commonly natural rubber is also known as latex, which is cultivated across the
producers. The modern application of naturalrubberin refrigeration seals, freon/air
conditioning, motor mounts, engine coolants, automotive gaskets, and seals origi￾nates from the elastic nature of their molecular chains (Abuzreda 2023).
1.3.15 Application of Synthetic Polymers
Synthetic organic polymers are synthesized in laboratories by various chemical
modifications. The modification results in different compositions of the polymeric
chains. This in turn helps in improvement of the polymeric properties. Proper￾ties like tensile strength, gelation, and chain stiffness are important for possible
industrial application of synthesized polymers (Flory 1953). They are commonly
found in a variety of consumer products. They find technological use as adhesives,
fibers, paints, plastics, and rubbers. We have mentioned about cellulose as natural
polymer; at the same time cellulose derivativeslike hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose
(HPMC), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose fall under synthetic category (Dumitriu
1996). So derivatives of natural polymers belong to synthetic category. Generally
organic polymers are flexible, have a low density, and are stable over a wide pH
range.
Most of the synthetic polymers are classified based on their mechanism of forma￾tion. Some of them are chain polymers, and others are condensation polymers. One
of the simplest but highly utilized synthetic chain polymers is polyethylene (PE).
This is formed by the repetition of ethylene units. However, two important varieties
of PE are LDPE and HDPE which found very good industrial applications. HDPE24 1 Organic Polymers: Past and the Present
is more rigid than LDPE due to higher crystallinity (Felgel-Farnholz et al. 2023).
A linear polyethylene is a HDPE, whereas a branched polyethylene is a LDPE.
A series of other polymers like PVC, polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS),
PTFE or Teflon, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), polymethyl
acrylate (PMA), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and PAN can be also formed
in a similar fashion. A vinyl group CH2=CH– undergoes substitution with several
atoms/groups like –chloro, phenyl, cyano, and alcohol to yield these polymers
(Flory 1953). For example, the polymer PVC was formed by the repetition of vinyl
chloride monomers. “PVC” is a strong plastic that can be made softer and more
flexible by adding plasticizers.
n(CH2=CH − Cl) Vinyl chloride → (−CH2 − CHCl) − n PVC
Nevertheless, the polymer Teflon is widely used because of its non-reactive and
hydrophobic nature. It does not interact with water as well as water-containing
materials, so it is used mostly in cookware like non-stick pans. Non-reactivity arises
from the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond (Hanford and Joyce 1946).
On the other hand, a range ofsynthetic polymersfall underthe condensation poly￾mer category. For example, polyester or PET, a synthetic fiber, is a condensation
polymer of ethylene glycol (alcohol) and terephthalic acid. These polymers found
application based upon their broad classification asthermosets, thermoplastics, elas￾tomers, and synthetic fibers. Thermosets are mostly used in adhesives as they don’t
undergo structural change after getting set. An elastomer being a flexible polymer
found severalsuitable applications. Apart from polyester, a few otherimportantsyn￾thetic condensation polymers include nylon, Bakelite, melamine, polyurethanes,
polycarbonates, and epoxies (Carothers 1929).
Most of the synthesized organic polymers have carbon backbone in theirstructure.
The insertion of the heterochain (e.g., oxygen, sulfur) in the polymeric structure can
change the polymeric propertiesfor achieving required applications. Some examples
of heterochain polymers are polyamides, polyesters, polyurethanes, polysulfides,
and polycarbonates that have other elements in their chain (Flory 1953).
A few common applications of some synthetic polymers are presented in the
following table.

16. Polycarbonates Used to make a variety of lenses, such as those for automobile
headlights, safety glass lenses, SCUBA masks, and sunglasses
or eyeglasses. Windscreens of small motorized vehicles such
as motor cycles, helicopters, small airplanes are made up of
polycarbonates. The light-weight polycarbonates used as
displays include some LCD screens, mobile screens, plasma

to create nanomedicine materials with increased
biocompatibility and degradability.
17. Polyamides Synthetic polyamides are commonly used in textiles,
automotive industry, carpets, kitchen utensils, sportswear, etc.
In industry, it is used to synthesize different kinds of
substances such as tents, fishing nets, ropes, and tennis

hoses, machine parts due to its waterproof properties and
nylon-6 is widely used in gears, fitting, and bearings in
automotive industry. Kevler, another synthetic polyamide, is
widely used in the manufacturing of motorcycle helmets,

supersonic aircraft.
19. Bakelite Bakelite is used in industrial electrical applications such as
electronics, power generation, and aerospace industries as
well as for wire insulation and other automobile components
like brake pads. Bakelite also finds its use as non-conducting
components of phones, radios, and other electrical
equipment, including insulators, bases, and sockets for light
bulbs and electron tubes.
20. Epoxy resins Epoxy resins are extensively used because of their excellent
adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent
mechanical properties, and good electrical insulating
properties. Epoxy adhesives are used in the construction of
aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, snowboards,
etc. It is used in the electronic industry for printed wire
boards, insulators, switchgear, motors, generators, and
transformers. Nevertheless, for embedding electron
microscopes, water-soluble epoxides, named “durcupan,” are
frequently utilized.
21. Silicones Used in surface coatings, manufacture of laminates, as
foaming agents in airplanes and missiles, as elastomers, and
as a filler to reinforce silicone rubbers. Used in many products
such as electrical (e.g., insulation), electronics (e.g., coatings),
household (e.g., sealants and cooking utensils), textiles and
papers (e.g., coating), automobile (e.g., gaskets), and office
machines (e.g., keyboard pads).1.3 Synthesis and Properties of Polymers 27
Polyurethane, which is a thermoplastic, is also considered as one of the most appli￾cable polymers due to some of its inherent properties like elasticity, transparency,
and resistance to oil, grease, and abrasion. It is a hydrophilic polymer that can react
with water. Thisthermoplastic elastomer consists of urethane groups(–NH–CO–O–)
in the main polymer chain (Akindoyo et al. 2016). However incorporation of some
other groups like ester, ether, amide, and urea produces some copolymers with suit￾able industrial applications.
Due in large part to their excellent tensile strength, synthetic co-polymers have
found a wide range of uses. Because two or more distinct monomers are combined,
co-polymers are able to withstand pressure. The atoms of different monomers can
form strong bond between them because of electronegativity differences. They are
generally categorized into linear, alternate, block, and graft co-polymers depending
upon the arrangement of chains (Saldívar-Guerra and Vivaldo-Lima 2013). Several
types of acrylic, vinyl acetate, and styrene-based co-polymers have found extensive
applications in industries.
1.3.16 Recent Advances in Organic Polymers
In the modern era, with the advancement of technology, polymeric materials have
potential countless applications. These include applications in electronics (Shaw
and Seidler 2001), water treatment (Donga et al. 2019), hydrogen storage (Kato and
Nishide 2018), drug-delivery systems (Liechty et al. 2010), solar cells (Brabec et al.
2003),sequestration of carbon dioxide (Wang et al. 2017), and energy storage capaci￾tors(Feng et al. 2022). Due to their diverse applications, many efforts have been made
recently in the design and study of novel polymeric materials. The classification of
polymers falls under various categories because of their structures, broad applica￾tions, and varying properties. Thus instead of classifying them under one category
they are classified as synthetic, semi-synthetic, or natural; organic and inorganic;
linear, branched, and cross-linked polymers; homomer and co-polymers; addition
and condensation polymers; and elastomers, fibers, thermosetting, and thermoplas￾tics. This section gives a brief account of the recent developments in the field of
polymer science particularly organic polymers.
Clean energy has become a necessity of modern society, and organic polymers may
play a pivotalrole in the design of novel materialsto harvest clean energy. The major
challenge in the sustainable development of society is the increasing population
which invariably puts pressure on natural resources. The ever-increasing popula￾tion results in an increase in the consumption of fossil fuels and hence increases air
pollution and global warming. There has been an exhaustive effort to pave the way
toward clean energy either by using solar cells or designing novel photocatalysts for
water splitting (Takanabe 2017).
Although photolysis of water is considered to be the holy grail approach for
hydrogen production toward sustainable energy, there was very limited success in
the field until the employment of graphitic carbon nitride polymers (g-C3N4) (Wang
et al. 2021). Conjugated organic polymers due to their tunable properties have
attracted much attention in the pursuit of sustainable hydrogen production from28 1 Organic Polymers: Past and the Present
water as compared to their inorganic counterparts. One such organic polymer is
graphitic carbon nitride, a layered conjugated organic polymer, which has become
the center of attraction since the last decade due to its various unique properties
such as ease of synthesis, being metal-free, and having an environmentally benign
nature, and a band gap of 2.7 eV. These properties make the polymer the most suit￾able candidate for hydrogen production. Despite the abovementioned properties,
the pristine g-C3N4 has some bottlenecks such as limited active sites, high charge
carrier recombination, and low specific surface areas which have to be overcome
before it is used as catalyst in full scale for water splitting. Engineering the g-C3N4 is
one of the many possibilities to make the material more efficient for water splitting.
Elemental doping is one of the engineering techniques where a heteroatom is
incorporated in g-C3N4. In one such study, the bulk g-C3N4 was doped with
elemental cobalt and it was observed that the incorporation of Co not only results in
the narrowing of the band gap but also increases the specific surface areas, thereby
making the separation of photoinduced carriers more efficient (Chen et al. 2017).
In another attempt g-C3N4 was doped with elemental iron and it was observed
that the Fe-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets have a broader absorption spectrum than
the bulk g-C3N4. Moreover, the prepared material is more efficient than the bulk
g-C3N4 in case of hydrogen-evolving reaction (Gao et al. 2017). Non-metal-doped
g-C3N4 has also been observed to be more efficient than the pristine g-C3N4. In one
such study, Jiang et al. (2019) observed that the photocatalytic performance was
significantly increased after it was doped with oxygen. Apart from g-C3N4 there are
porous organic polymers that can be a platform to carry out photocatalytic water
splitting. Porous organic polymers are generally defined as a group of covalently
connected polymer materials with high porosity and specific surface area. They are
made of different light elements (carbon, boron, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen)
and strong covalent bonds. Porous organic polymers gained popularity due to their
versatile properties such as being tunable, i.e., their geometry and dimensions
can be controlled during the synthesis process. Since porous organic polymers are
connected through strong covalent bonds they have high chemical and thermal
stability. There have been continuous efforts to prepare porous organic polymers
to carry out the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (Xu et al. 2018). Porous
organic polymers can be grouped into three classes: conjugated microporous
polymers (Jiang et al. 2008), covalent triazine frameworks (Jiang et al. 2018)
and covalent organic frameworks (Cote 2005). The application of porous organic
polymers for water splitting is still in the infancy period, and the material has to
compete with the state-of-art materials such as metal oxides and graphitic carbon
nitrides. There is no doubt that the addition of porous organic polymers into the
family of photocatalysts will give us more options to explore the myriad landscape
of photocatalysts and help the scientific community to design environmentally
benign novel photocatalysts.
Hydrogen storage is another area where the organic polymer has tremendous
potential. Hydrogen (H2) due to its properties such as energy density and clean
combustion, an abundance in the form of water is going to become the major
energy source and will replace the non-renewable petroleum energy resources.1.3 Synthesis and Properties of Polymers 29
The major bottlenecks in using H2 as energy source are its storage and production
(Cousins and Zhang 2019). Hydrogen can be stored using highly porous organic
polymers through adsorption. These approaches have various advantages such as
low cost, easy to scale up, metal-free, and environmentally friendly. In this case
four groups of highly porous polymers have been extensively used for hydrogen
storage: (i) hyper cross-linked polymers (HCPs) (Wood et al. 2007), (ii) Polymers
of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs), (iii) Conjugated Microporous Polymers (CMPs),
and (iv) Porous Aromatic Frameworks (PAFs) (Germain et al. 2009).
Ease of functionalizing pore environments, large accessible surface areas, and
high porosities make solid-state porous materials promising materials for hydrogen
(Chen et al. 2022). Similarly amorphous POPs, because of their ease of processibility
and good mechanical stability, make them viable candidates for hydrogen storage.
The processing cost is relatively low and free of heavy metal making the materials
and processes friendly to the environment.
Conducting polymers have been extensively investigated as a potential hydro￾gen storage due to the low cost, ease of synthesis, and processability to achieve
the desired morphological and microstructural architecture, ease of doping and
composite formation, chemical stability, and functional properties.
Organic polymers are being extensively used for targeted drug-delivery systems
and controlled drug-delivery systems (Mahato et al. 2020). Drug delivery refers
to a combination of methods, technologies, formulations, or processes used to
deliver the therapeutic agent into the body to achieve the desired therapeutic
effect (Aimetti et al. 2009). When a drug is administered to the body because of
various factors only a small amount reaches the sites of action. The various factors
include metabolism of the therapeutic agent or the drug while en route to the
site, reaching wrong sites (tissues or organs), or quick removal of the drug from
the site. This affects the efficiency of any drug greatly. The above shortcomings
can be overcome if targeted drug-delivery approaches or smart drug-delivery
approaches or controlled drug-delivery approaches are applied. In this method,
to minimize the side effects and to attain the maximum efficacy of the drugs,
the drugs are administered at an appropriate time, dosage, and location (Zishan
et al. 2017). Recently, in medicine organic polymers have become an inseparable
and indispensable part as drug-delivery systems. The objective of a sustainable
drug-delivery system is to control drug release, reduce drug frequency, thereby
increasing the efficiency and decreasing the side effects of the drug (Allen and
Cullis 2004). Considering the efficiency of the targeted drug-delivery system over
the conventional systems many studies were done on carriers of the drug. The
vesicular carrier systems, microparticulate systems, monoclonal antibodies and
fragments, and polymeric carriers are the most commonly used carriers for targeted
drug delivery. The advancement in polymeric science helped scientists and phar￾macologists to design new drug carriers, thereby making polymers an inseparable
part of drug-delivery systems. The development of novel drug-delivery systems or
controlled drug-delivery systems depends on the carriers that are used to deliver
the drugs to the specific site. It is observed that polymer-based drug nanocarriers
can increase the solubility of hydrophobic drugs, decrease their cytotoxicity toward30 1 Organic Polymers: Past and the Present
normal tissue, prolong drug availability, favorably alter biodistribution, improve
utilization efficiency (Mahajan et al. 2007) and thereby may show promising phar￾macokinetics both at the cellular and whole body levels, e.g., polymeric nanocarrier
poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide). Various organic polymers utilized in drug delivery
are poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), polyglycolic acid, poly-L-glutamic acid, polylactic
acid, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), dextran, dendrimers, chitosan, and so on
(Mathiowitz et al. 1997). Amphiphilic polymers such as micelles, dendrimers,
and nanomicelles, containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, have been
extensively studied as they are thought to be good candidates as polymeric carriers
in drug delivery (Srivastava et al. 2016). Smart polymers are another class that
changes their properties according to the environment such as pH. In summary, it
can be concluded that the future of drug delivery is very bright, and the inclusion
of technologies in treating diseases will become more and more efficient.
In general, when the term good conductors comes to our mind, we generally
picture metals, salt solutions, and fused salts and usually treat organic solids
and liquids as good insulators. However, this notion is changing since the dis￾covery of conjugated organic polymers capable of conducting electricity. In 2000
Heeger, MacDiarmid, and Shirakawa were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chem￾istry for their work on the discovery and development of conductive polymers
(Yang and Pierstorff 2012). The two branches of materials science which have
witnessed exponential growth in the twentieth century and almost touched
all aspects of modern life are semiconductors and polymers. The history of
conjugated polymers dates back to polypyrrole and PANI. Synthetic metals are
defined as organic polymers which possess both the properties of metals (such
as electronic, electric, magnetic, and optical) and those of polymers (such as
mechanical properties and processibility). Moreover, with the discovery that the
conductivity of conjugated organic polymers can be easily tuned or controlled,
there has been exponential growth in the application of conjugated organic
polymers in organic photovoltaic devices, light-emitting diodes, sensors, and field
effect transistors (MacDiarmid 2001). The most commonly studied conjugated
organic polymers are polyacetylene, polythiophene, polyphenylene-vinylene,
polypyrrole, polyfuran, polyphenylene, and PANI. It is observed that synthetic
metals exhibit high electrical conductivity in their oxidized and reduced states.
Porous organic polymers have a very large surface area and as a result, make
them an ideal candidate for gas trapping and hence can be used as chemical
sensors for heavy metals, explosives, biological molecules, sensors for volatile
organic compounds and solvents, and sensors for anions (Bao and Lovinger
1999). Engineering polymers represent another class of organic polymers that can
withstand high temperatures and have high physical and mechanical properties
which make them good candidates for their use in aerospace electronics and robotic
systems (Mittal 2011). Stretchable electronics are another area where organic
polymers have potential applications. Stretchable polymers, because of their unique
physicochemical properties, are envisioned as the future of electronic devices.
Stretchable electronics consist of electronic materials integrated with an elastomer
or stretchable material. Stretchable polymers have the potential to be applied inReferences 31
biomedical engineering, healthcare, and human–machine interface (Lim et al.
2015).
Thus it is seen that in the near future polymers will become the epicenter of
research and development. Moreover, it is believed that organic polymers will play
an important part in deciphering the solutions to the problems that arise after the
indiscriminate use of resources.
1.4 Conclusion and Future Scope
It is well known that nature from the beginning selected biopolymers for survival
and growth. Likewise, humans also started their journey from Stone Age and passed
through several stages to reach the present age where polymer material is always
one of the best choices of interest. Polymer technology is a branch of science where
extensive research is going on for the introduction of novel material which can meet
our daily requirements in a sustainable fashion. Presently, researchers are looking
for intelligent polymers which are specially designed materials having multidimen￾sional applications that can extend the scope of polymer science. In this chapter, a
thorough development in the field of polymer science has been nicely described in
a concise manner. Starting from the origin of polymers, their history and discovery,
types and mode of classification, the recent advancements in polymer sciences, and
their important practical applications have been properly incorporated with suit￾able examples. This book also explains about the scope and limitations of various
techniques used in the synthesis and study of properties of various types of organic
polymers. In addition, important applications of polymers in material science such
as in OLEDs, semiconductors, superconductors, and PMCs have been presented.
The modification of polymers and the research involved for the same will definitely
help mankind in future.

2.1 Introduction
Since the earth’s origin, elements like carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen have been
uniting to form composite polymer molecules. A polymer served as the material
basis for the origin of life, which is the most exciting and intriguing process that
could have ever been brought about by such a combination. In nature, this polymer
known as protein was created from straightforward chemical constituents like CO2,
CH4, and NH3 (Errahali et al. 2014). However, despite being a fundamental compo￾nent of the natural world and having appeared in everyday items like starch, wood,
cotton, cellulose, and natural rubber, humanity did not fully understand polymers
until almost the end of World War II. In nineteenth century, Leo Baekeland (1935)
developed a resin from two very common chemicals phenol and formaldehyde,
which was later named after him as Bakelite. Bakelite was a forerunner of many
synthetic polymers. For instance, Jacques Brandenburger developed a famous
transparent material called cellophane (Hisano 2017). Within a decade, several new
forms of polymers with better properties had emerged from laboratories in different
parts of the world.
In recent times, the applications of polymers have gained much attention in
diverse areas of chemistry and industry. Contemporary applications of polymer
material extend from electronic devices, adhesives, foams, coatings, and packaging
materials to industrial fibers, silicone heart valves, textile, Teflon-coated cookware,
and composites (Namazi 2017). They have also massive application in optical
devices and biomedical devices, and they are considered as precursors for many
high-tech ceramics. The list is practically never-ending. These assorted practices
of polymers have enormously aided to advance our living standards. Polymers are
attained via chemical reaction of monomers. The polymer chain is formed by the

reaction of monomer molecule with alternative molecule from a similar type or
another kind in the appropriate condition (Namazi 2017). This practice in nature
has led to the development of natural polymers, whereas the synthetic polymers
are man-made. Natural and synthetic polymers comprise inorganic and organic
polymers; elastomer, blends, fibers, ceramics, coatings, plastics, and composites
(Patil et al. 2017). Herein, in this chapter we will emphasize only about the basis
and application of organic polymer.

Organic polymers are made up of carbon backbone structure. Some common
examples of organic polymers are polyamides, polycarbonates, polyesters, and
polyurethanes (Patil et al. 2017). Organic polymers have found their immense
applicationsin some of the exciting areas like water purification, molecular recogni￾tion, holography, biomedical applications, drug delivery system, biosensor devices,
tissue engineering, cosmetics aircraft, aerospace, and sports equipment (Patil et al.
2017). Bio-based polymers are also included in this category, e.g. polylactic acid,
polyhydroxy alkanolate, and polypropylene which are mainly made up from renew￾able resources (Babu et al. 2013). Bio-based polymers have the benefit of reducing
carbon footprint, since the former are degraded into their component monomers
with the aid of fungi and bacteria (microorganisms) and produce CO2, CH4, and
water without creating any toxic material (Laurichesse and Avérous 2014). On the
other hand, plastics/materials which are petroleum based like polyethylene, PVC,
polystyrene, and poly-butyrene have very destructive effects on the environment as
they are nonbiodegradable (Avella et al. 2009; Nakajima et al. 2017). To solve this
matter, bio-based polymers have arose as an auxiliary to traditional (petroleum)
plastics. In current years the chemistry of porous organic polymer (POP) is consid￾ered as a fascinating area of research. POPs are a type of organic macromolecules
which are constructed by strong covalent linkages of different organic moieties
(Zhang and Riduan 2012). On the ground of their structural uniqueness and degree
of long-range order, POPs can be classified into different categories, e.g., polymer of
intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), hyper
cross-linked polymers (HCPs), covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), covalent
organic frameworks (COFs), and porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). All the
mentioned POPs are amorphous materials, with the exception of CTFs and COFs,
which are crystalline having ordered structures and synthesized under thermody￾namic control (Zhang et al. 2017a,b). POPs feature high surface area expectedly
between 100 and 1000 m2 g−1 which are greater than those of porous carbons,2.2 Preparation of Covalent Organic Framework (COF) 39
MOFs. A 3D-COF-103 with a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of
4210 m2 g−1 was reported by Yaghi and coworkers in 2007 (El-Kaderi et al. 2007;
Ahn et al. 2006). Ben and coworkers developed a PAF (PAF-1) with a high specific
area (4210 m2 g−1) using the Yamamoto reaction. POPs also display greater chemical
and thermal stabilities, extended π-conjugations, light weight and high contents
of C, H, N. The said excellence of POPs contributes to it becoming an emerging
material (Li and Yang 2017). Additionally, POPs-based catalysts also exhibit high
degree of polymerization, poor solubility in organic solvent, and rigid chemical
bonds, making them easier to separate from reaction medium and recycle (Wong
et al. 2016). Their surface areas pore size and porous structure can be designed
and easily modified by introducing definite functional components. Owing to the
aforementioned characteristics, POPs are used in amazing potential applications in
diverse areas like gas storage/separation, photocatalytic reactions, energy storage,
chemical and bio-sensing, degradation of organic pollutants, and H2 evolution
(Zhang et al. 2017a,b). In addition to these, POPs have a tremendous application in
the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Incorporation of active catalytic species into
POPs via metal–ligand coordination or covalent bonding and adjusting pore struc￾tures of the solids improves the catalytic properties of POPs (El-Kaderi et al. 2007).
Hence, this process makes the heterogeneous catalytic system of POPs suitable for
diverse applications. On the contrary, COF, which represents crystalline POP, has
been receiving widespread application in the field of heterogenous catalysis as it
experiences uniform nanopores along with extended and ordered skeleton which
enables specific incorporation of functional units (El-Kaderi et al. 2007). Quite a lot
of COFs with various topologies have been thoroughly investigated in catalysis, gas
storage and separation, and energy storage since the pioneering work reported by
O.M. Yaghi and coworkers (El-Kaderi et al. 2007; Fontanals et al. 2015). Moreover,
CTFs, a distinct subclass of COFs, have triazine rings that are often synthesized
via the trimerization reaction of aromatic nitriles (Zhao et al. 2017; Planells et al.
2013; Ghosh et al. 2015). Due to low crystallinity, greater chemical stability, and
high nitrogen content, most reported CTFs are hence well suited for photocatalysis
applications. Nevertheless, the harsh reaction conditions for synthesis (such as
use of high temperature of over 400 ∘C) and irreversible production of aromatic
1,3,5-triazine rings restrict the development of CTFs in comparison to COFs
containing imine, azine linkage, boroxine, or boronate ester (Kuhn et al. 2008).
Recently, polycondensation approach under low temperature was established by B.
Tan and coworkers which was a great success (Wang et al. 2017).
In this chapter, we offer an overview of preparation of POPs (including COFs,
CMPs, CTFs, and HCPs), their synthesis methodologies, and various applications
in the construction of organic materials and future development.
2.2 Preparation of Covalent Organic Framework (COF)
Organic polymers are gaining attention due to their innumerable advantages.
Organic polymers are the macromolecules that are composed of carbon backbone40 2 Basics of Polymerizations and Application Toward Organic Materials
structures, with the repetition of monomer units. We can synthesize polymers
on the basis of their applications. The various types of organic polymers that
can be synthesized are COF, HCPs, POPs, organic polymeric membranes, etc.
Polymerization is a process in which three-dimensional networks or polymer
chains are formed, by combining reactant monomers together under suitable
reaction conditions. Though we can prepare organic polymers by different methods
the basics of polymerization are mainly classified into two types: (i) addition
polymerization and (ii) condensation polymerization. In addition polymerization,
the monomers combine with each other without loss of any atom or molecules
whereas in condensation polymerization, condensation polymers are formed by
the combination of two different monomers, with the loss of small molecules like
water. The reversible condensation of building blocks containing light elements
and connected by covalent bonds resulted in the formation of a new type of porous
crystalline organic polymers which were called COF (Cote et al. 2005). It resulted
in the long-range-order crystalline structures due to their thermodynamically
controlled covalent bonding and self-healing ability. Their crystallinity and ordered
structures are maintained because of the ability to withstand harsh condition
and chemical stability in organic solvents (Diercks and Yaghi 2017; El-Kaderi
et al. 2007). The reason for the good strength of the framework is pi stacking
interactions and hydrogen bonding which can further protect them from solvation
and hydrolysis (Lohse and Bein 2018; Ding and Wang 2013).
The preparation of certain light elements containing COFs is described below.
2.2.1 Hydrazone-Based COF
The co-condensation of hydrazides and aldehydes in the presence of a catalyst,
i.e., acetic acid, results in the formation of COF that are hydrazone linked
(Figure 2.1a). The ethoxy unit at the ortho position of the building units has
been integrated to form the essential hydrazine-linked COF which includes the
formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The construction of the 2D confor￾mation using the solvothermal conditions has also been attempted which results
in the enhancement of thermal stability and crystallinity (Abuzeid et al. 2021).
For example COF42 and COF43 were synthesized using aromatic aldehydes and
2,5-diethoxyterephthalohydrazide (Wang et al. 2020).
2.2.1.1 Boron-Containing COF
Boronated anhydrides and boronated esters have been used for the formation of
a wide range of boron-containing COF. Based on the condensation process two
categories of COF are formed (i) through co-condensation of catechol derivatives
and boronic acids to yield a five-membered ring boronate esters (Figure 2.1b). For
example, solvothermal co-condensation of 4,4-diphenyl butadiynebis(boronic acid)
(DPB) and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) yielded HHTP-DPB
COFP which wassynthesized by Feriante et al.(2020),(ii)through self-condensation
of a single building block leading to the formation for cyclic six-membered
boroxine-linked COFP (Figure 2.1c). For example, 2D COF was synthesized(a) +

through self-condensation of 1,4-benzenediboronic acid, and the self-condensation
of TBPS resulted in the synthesis of 3D COF (Spitler et al. 2011).
2.2.1.2 Imide-Based COF
At high temperatures, the condensation of an acetic acid with amine yields
imide linkages (Figure 2.1d) Under the solvothermal condition in methylene/
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone mixture and isoquinoline as catalyst, the reaction between
triamine building units and aromatic anhydrides leads to the formation of 2D
polyimide COFs (Fang et al. 2014). The 3D COF were formed at lower temperature
for over five days (Fang et al. 2015). Further, synthetic methods such as ionothermal
conditions and catalyst and solvent-free methods have been used for the synthesis
of such polymer (Wu et al. 2015; Abuzeid et al. 2021).
2.2.1.3 Imine-Based COF
The Schiff base reaction results in the formation of imine-based COFs. This takes
place by means of co-condensation of aldehydes and aromatic amines in the pres￾ence of a catalyst which can be either an organic acid or a Lewis acid (Figure 2.1e).
These imine-based COF are categorized into five classes based on their topology
(i) hexagonal, (ii) trigonal, (iii) tetragonal, (iv) rhombic, (v) kagome structures
(Abuzeid et al. 2021).
2.2.1.4 Azine-Based COF
A large number of azine (Figure 2.1f)-based COF are synthesized because the
two aldehydes are connected by the short hydrazine monomer resulting in the
formation of polygon structures. Triphenyl triazine, substituted benzene, and a
number of knots have been explored which leads to diverse topologies (Stegbauer
et al. 2015; Alahakoon et al. 2017; Li et al. 2019; Lu et al. 2019; Guan et al. 2019;
Alahakoon et al. 2016).
2.2.1.5 sp2-Hybridized Carbon-Conjugated COF
The Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes and benzyl cyanides in the presence
of a base results in the synthesis of fully pie conjugated COF (Figure 2.1g). The
condensation of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile
in mesitylene/1,4-dioxirane in the presence of aqueous NaOH as catalyst resulted
in the formation of C=C linked COF which was first proposed by Jiang and
coworkers (Jin et al. 2017). The condensation 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile and
1,3,5-tri(4-formylphenyl)benzene with cesium carbonate as the catalyst in the
formation of a 2D poly(phenylenevinylene) framework polymer (Feng et al.
2016). A mixture of CHCl3 and 1,4-dioxirane was used to construct a 2D COF
which constituted triazine central planar units bridged by sp2-hybridized car￾bon linkers (Zhao et al. 2019). The reaction of linkers of various lengths with
tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene resulted in the synthesis of various sp2-hybridized
carbon-conjugated COF (Jin et al. 2018).2.2 Preparation of Covalent Organic Framework (COF) 43
2.2.2 Preparation of Covalent Triazine Framework (CTF)
The first examples of CTF-containing triazine molecules and aromatic rings were
reported by Thomas and his coworkers (Mohamed et al. 2020). These polymers
are amorphous porous partially crystalline containing layered and conjugated
structures (Qian et al. 2021). CTF has captivated attention due to its promising
implementation in organosynthesis, reduction of carbon dioxide, hydrogen gas, and
hydrogen peroxide production, degradation of pollutant, organic semiconductor
devices, and splitting of water (Li et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2018,2019; Jiang et al.
2015; Xu et al. 2020; Puthiaraj et al. 2016). CTF has been prepared by a number
of methods which include superacid-catalyzed trimerization, catalysis of P2O5 at
400 ∘C, Suzuki cross-coupling, cyclotrimerization of nitrile groupsin the presence of
zinc chloride, and nickel-catalyzed Yamamoto coupling as described in Figure 2.2
(Qian et al. 2021). For the preparation of highly crystalline structures of CTF,
monomers with planar characteristics are used. If nonplanar monomers are used,
it leads to the formation of semicrystalline or amorphous polymers (Bojdys et al.

2D CTF structure was prepared within 10 minutes at 25 ∘C by Xu. There was a
TfOH-catalyzed interfacial reaction with refining techniques applied after the
trimerization reaction (Abuzeid et al. 2021). Using this approach AB-staggered
crystalline CTF were formed, whereas AA stacking crystalline CTF were formed by
the ionothermal method.
2.2.3 Preparation of Hyper Cross-linked Polymers (HCP)
The porous polymers that have fascinated much curiosity are the HCP for prop￾erties like high surface area, high hydrothermal, mechanical, and chemical stabil￾ity, extended conjugation, variation in synthetic methods, and tunable porosities.
To establish their configuration, characteristics, structure, and stabilities, a number
of methods have been used. The Friedel Crafts reaction containing a reaction sol￾vent, Lewis acid catalyst, electrophile, and nucleophile that is arene based resulted
in the construction of HCP (Gu et al. 2021). The reactions were carried out under
inert atmosphere to eliminate the formation of by-products and obtain pure poly￾mer (Gu et al. 2021). The HCP-containing metal species can be formulated through
post alteration, i.e., either by using a metal complex as a monomer in the knitting
process or by adding a metal complex orsalt(Gu et al. 2021). For example, the Friedel
Crafts alkylation of polystyrene results in the formation of HCP through crosslink￾ing as shown in Figure 2.3a (Davankov and Tsyurupa 1990; Jiang and Cooper 2009).

bis(chloromethyl) anthracene (BCMA) yields HCP (Figure 2.3b (Jiang and Cooper
2009; Wood et al. 2007).
2.2.4 Preparation of Nitrogen-Containing Porous Organic Polymers
Synthesis of nitrogen-containing POPs takes place by the following methods (i) the
porous carbon polymers are made to react with nitrogen-containing materials,
(ii) N-containing materials having nitrogen-free precursors are co-carbonized with
POPs containing carbon (Wu et al. 2017).
2.2.5 Preparation of Melamine-Formaldehyde (MF) Spheres
In the synthesis of melamine formaldehyde spheres, melamine was allowed to react
with formaldehyde solution followed by addition of lysine (Liu et al. 2017a,b).
2.2.6 Preparation of Nitrogen-Rich Microporous Carbon
Melamine formaldehyde was mixed with water and ethanol. After that, hexam￾ethylenetetramine (HMT), resorcinol, and citric acid were added. The formed
nitrogen-rich microporous polymer was washed to remove impurities (Liu et al.
2012, 2017a,b). It can also be synthesized by using resorcinol and HMT in water,
followed by adding citric acid (Liu et al. 2017a,b).
2.2.7 Preparation of Conjugated Microporous Polymer (CMP)
Because of the diversity, modularity, large surface area, and outstanding physio￾chemical stabilities, CMP is making an appearance in this field. These polymers
are extensively used for photocatalysis, luminescent materials, absorbents, and
light-harvesting materials. The engrossing properties of these polymers are mainly
due to two reasons. First, their highly cross-linked polymeric network structures
and high surface area; second, their expanded conjugated structures along the
chains. The most widely used methods for the preparation of CMP are electropoly￾merization, Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira–Hagihara cross-coupling, Schiff base
formation, phenazine ring fusion, and alkyne metathesis. These approaches allow a
range of different substrates, polysynthetic modification, good selectivities, suitable
reaction condition, and high yield production (Luo et al. 2021; Sheng et al. 2021;
Abuzeid et al. 2021; Chaoui et al. 2017).
2.2.8 Synthesis of Organic Polymeric Membranes
Using trimesoylchloride (TMC) with the addition of bisfunctional or multi￾functional phenol monomers in water medium, cross-linked polyarylates are
synthesized which is a porous membrane and a good example of polymers of
intrinsic microporosity (Jimenez-Solomon et al. 2016; Ulbricht 2020).46 2 Basics of Polymerizations and Application Toward Organic Materials
2.3 Application Toward Organic Materials
2.3.1 Application of Porous Organic Polymers for Separation
of Organic Gas
POPs have been broadly utilized for the storage adsorption of gases like hydrogen,
methane as well as carbon dioxide with enhanced capacity and selectivity. Among
the three gases, hydrogen is considered as an ideal fresh energy carrier because of
its carbon-free nature, emission of only water as byproduct during its application
in engine or fuel cell. Besides these, the efficiency of the fuel cell can be enhanced
compared to internal combustion engine. Despite so many advantages, the lack of
suitable, safe, and low-cost method causes limited application of hydrogen as fuel.
In this regard, porous materials with high surface area have been considered as
potential applicant in the sorption of H2. These POPs are considered owing to their
suitable composition of light element, available binding sites for hydrogen, and pos￾sibility of large-scale production value.
Similarly POPs could be utilized in the adsorption of carbon dioxide gas which
is discharged into the atmosphere due to the increasing consumption of fossil fuels.
Thisincreasing amount ofreleased carbon dioxide becomes a majorissue of concern
in prospect of global warming. Despite so many efforts, the practical solution of
this problem is yet to be completed. To avoid the energy-exhausted CO2 capture,
the physisorption methods are more reliable as compared to chemical adsorption.
But these techniques are suffering from low CO2 selectivity, interference by tuned
functional groups, and missing link in improving postcombustion process. In this
aspect, porous materials are considered as dynamically efficient and precise. Till
date a number of POPs have been described forthe adsorption of CO2 undersuitable
pre- and postcombustion capture. Due to the high porosity and pore surface func￾tionality, the CO2 uptake capacity is increasing making it a potential applicant for
this purpose. Among the recently reported literature, the work of Yavuz and Coskun
on azobridged nanoporous covalent organic polymers, work of Hani and his group
on POPs and Dai group on heaxaaztriphenylene-based CFTs has been considered as
significant for CO2 adsorption.
The primary component of natural gas methane is considered as plentiful
energy resource. The application of POPs for CH4 gas adsorption and storage
is quite less as compared to other gases, though organic porous materials are
promising candidates for the same. The work of Cooper and coworkers is con￾sidered for storage of methane by utilizing series of HCPs. Among the developed
series, 4,4′
-bis(chloromethyl)-1,10-biphenyl (BCMBP) showed highest methane
adsorption capacity.
In recent development, POPs are utilized in the separation of ethylene from
ethane, one of the most efficient feedstock molecules used in petrochemical
industry. For the large-scale chemical separation, similar volatility and molecular
size create major problem. Utilization of cryogenic distillation method under high
pressure and low temperature is being developed recently; still it is not efficient
owing to the high cost and energy consumption. Organic-solvent-based adsorbent2.3 Application Toward Organic Materials 47
and porous absorbents are considered as potential usersin thisseparation technique
owing to their low cost and low-energy consumption value. On the other hand,
POPs with strong covalent character can show high chemical and physical as well
as moisture stability. Adornment of metal-like copper (catecholate) can improve
the ethane-ethylene adsorption selectivity. One recent development of organic
complexation with pops can not only provide suitable adsorption site but also
enhance the stability and separation (Zhang et al. 2017a,b).
2.3.2 Catalytic Application of POPs
POPs and their functionalized derivatives like metal-free POP, chiral POP, and POP
supported nano-particles, metal-free POPs establish as a new dimensional nanore￾actor in recent development owing to their unique skeleton and pores. Molecules
like amine, catechol, and pyridine groups have high affinity for metal ions. POPs
are manufactured with a high density organic content in their framework, thus
providing a high potential for metal ion. This property provides a high demand of
this POPs functionalized material in the field of heterogeneous catalysis (Zhang
et al. 2017a,b) which are summarized in following section.
2.3.2.1 Porphyrin-Based Functionalized POPs for Catalytic Application
Metal-porphyrin and their co-compounds can provide a large number of important
biological processes which have a numerous number of catalytic applications.
Macrocyclic porphyrin can fit in the organic framework through their interlinks to
form POPs. This framework is adequate for metal ions to utilize in heterogeneous
metalloporphyrin catalysis. The development of metal–organic CMP with Ir was
reported in 2011. The metal–organic CMP was utilized in the catalytic reduc￾tion of amine. The catalyst showed high catalytic activity with 90% yield of the
product. In 2009, Deng and his coworker developed a class of cobalt-aluminum
coordinated CMP which can show excellent CO2 capture at atmospheric pressure
and room temperature. The cobalt-coordinated microporous polymers can also
act as heterogenous catalyst for the reaction of CO2 and propylene oxide at room
temperature (Zhang et al. 2017a,b).
2.3.2.2 Application of Chiral Porous Organic Polymer in Asymmetric Catalysis
Only minimum numbers of reports are there to address the application of chiral
POP catalysts. There are some criteria for the potential application of POP catalysts.
To fulfill the criteria, the synthesis should be cost effective; the catalyst should be
reusable with maximum catalytic efficiency. The development of chiral cross-linked
polymer network by utilizing 1,10-binaphthyl and titanium ions is one example of
this application. The developed network shows fair stability and different enantios￾electivity for asymmetric catalysis, synthesis of three chiral porous through cross
coupling polycondensation of diene. Herein they have utilized porous polymer
as chiral stationary phase (CSP) in the chromatographic separation of race mates
(Zhang et al. 2017a,b).48 2 Basics of Polymerizations and Application Toward Organic Materials
2.3.3 Application of POPs as Adsorbent for Volatile Organic
Compounds
Volatile organic compounds, emitted from different kinds of industries, can be
harmful to human health and environment. Owing to its low cost and high
efficiency, adsorption method can be used for the treatment of VOCs. Activated
carbons and mesoporous materials are mostly used to remove VOCs because of
their plentiful porosity and surface area. Despite these advantages, the hydrophilic
nature and low desorption value can cause limiting commercial application of
these materials which should be more advanced. In this regard, =POPs structure
possess high specific area, fair stability, and high degree of hydrophobicity and
have emerged as excellent adsorbing materials for VOC. In this purpose, different
kinds of POPs materials are utilized. HCPs, CMPs, PAFs are commonly used POPs
materials for VOC adsorption. The abundant porosity in the surfaces of the POPs
plays a crucial rule in adsorption. An example included in the recent development
is the synthesis of a new kind of PAF material, by Ullmann’s reaction which has
excellent adsorption capacity toward methanol, benzene, and toluene at saturated
vapor pressure showing the values of 29.16, 11.74, and 11.53 mmol g−1, respectively.
Construction of porphyrin-based porous covalent porphyrin network with large
surface area and great hydrophobicity shows excellent adsorption capacity toward
saturated hydrocarbons like n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, cyclopen￾tane, and cyclohexane. In 2015, Wang and his group synthesized hydrophobic HCPs
with large surface area through Friedel Crafts alkylation reaction by utilizing benzyl
chloride monomer. The prepared polymer was selective for benzene adsorption
when water is present. In their work, benzene adsorption capacity was 86% in dry
condition and 80% in the presence of humidity (Lu et al. 2021).
The application of composite material of POP and other material can be more
advantageous for the adsorption of volatile organic compounds. Recently Liu
and his group have prepared grapheme-based hyper cross-linked porous carbon
composite which shows outstanding adsorption capacity for 2,4-dichlorophenol.
During this application, low yield of production and poor structural density of POPs
led to lengthy production leading to limited application (Lu et al. 2021).
2.3.4 Application of POPs for Chemical Sensor
Π-Conjugated POPs with light-emitting properties are utilized as attractive
materials in the construction of chemical sensor for the detection of various
chemicals. The photo physical and electronic properties of POPs can be tuned by
modifying the optical band-gap as they possess large surface area which helps them
to provide large interface for analyte interaction. The first example of development
of chemosensing CMP was reported by Jiang and his group. The synthesized
CMP exhibits blue florescence behavior with large surface area by condensation
reaction of carbazole derivative TCB utilized to detect the arene vapors. Compared
to linear polymer, the porous TCB-CMP showed not only advanced detection sen￾sitivity toward arene vapors but also provided faster detection capability. Another2.3 Application Toward Organic Materials 49

application of COPs as chemical sensor was to detect nitroaromatic explosives
which are considered as one of the serious pollutants. Among all the forms,
2,4,6-trinitrophenol (PA) has become popular as it is widely used in many industries
like glass, dye, fireworks, and leather industries. In the period of commercialization,
PA could be released into the environment, leading to contamination of soil and
aquatic bio systems. Considering their major threats toward environment, the
development of an efficient and consistent sensor for their detection is very serious
issue of concern. In this regard is the work of CaO and his group to synthesize
two porous luminescent COPs by copolymerization. The developed sensor showed
good detection capability with high sensitivity toward nitroaromatic explosives
with a limit of detection 1 ppm. The development of light-emitting CMP/poly(lactic
acid) nanofibrous films by electrospinning method was reported by Copper and his
group. The fabricated nanofibrous filmsshow high flexibility and high porosity with
large surface area. The prepared CMP-based nanofibrous films were then utilized
to detect nitroaromatic vapors. The sensor could detect benzoquinone vapors as
well. The application of porous CMP-based hybrid materials in super capacitor
construction has also been reported. In this aspect porous two-dimensional carbon
nanosheets sandwiched with grapheme were developed by Zhang and his group.
The synthesis nanomaterial showed outstanding supercapacitor behavior capacity
with 48% increased capacitance as compared to porous carbons without grapheme
(Zhang et al. 2017a,b) (Figure 2.4).
2.4 Conclusions

in various developments of organic materials. POPs have numerous advantages like
amazing tailorability in terms of internal structures, compositions, and properties
which make conceivable their rational design for any kind of precise application.
The synthesis and application part of POPs are interdisciplinary with the integration
of different fields like chemistry, physics, engineering as well as material science,
while in the design of products for particular probable application is included.
From this chapter the basic knowledge of useful POPs, their synthetic method￾ologies as well as applications in various fields have been discussed. Future work
should be continued to develop methodologies that allow ascendable synthesis of
POPs through environmental-friendly and low-cost method since large amount of
production is necessary for many emerging applications in future.

3.1 Introduction
Increasing trends in global warming and the energy crisis have demanded
alternative sources of energy supply. The limited sources of fossil fuels as well as
carbon emissions are other associated issues (Delucchi 2010). Hence, in the aspect
of the environment, the paradigm has shifted toward green energy. Continuous
investigations are ongoing to find superior solutions or make the existing methods
greener(Dincer and Acar 2015).Various alternatives are explored (Li et al. 2018a,b,c;
Singhania et al. 2020), out of which solar cells are one of the currently trending
research areas (Kannan and Vakeesan 2016). To generate electricity, scientists have
put continuous efforts into designing and developing new materials that can be
used in large-scale production and effectively convert light energy into electricity or
solar fuels at a cheaper cost while maintaining sustainability (Muñoz-García et al.
2021). There is space for significant growth in the use of renewable energy sources
because they now make up just 10% of the overall energy supply (29% of the total
electricity supply) (Hannah et al. 2022).
The sun isthe core energy source for nature, providing the world with 173,000 TW
of energy each year (Archer 2011). The research in the energy sector has been
moving toward finding sustainable renewable energy sourcesthat could be achieved
by developing efficient, low-cost photovoltaic devices. The world’s fastest-growing
energy technology is photovoltaic electricity generation, which has increased
by more than, on average, 34% annually during the past 10 years (Newell and
Raimi 2020). But barely 1% of the world’s electricity is produced by solar cells.
Between 2019 and 2025, renewable electricity output is expected to increase by 50%,
according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). With the consumers’ ability to
manufacture their own energy increasing rapidly, new opportunities are presented.
The solar cell is one of the effective ways to harness the available light energy,
and organic polymer as a component of solar cells makes it easier by providing a

simple method and more affordable by lowering the cost. Organic-polymer-based
materials are used practically in every element of modern civilization due to their
ability to chemically alterthe material properties of polymers and theirseveral quick
and inexpensive processing methods (Osaka 2015).
3.1.1 Parameter that Describes the Effectiveness of Solar Cells
We discuss several accounts on the performance advancement of photovoltaics
where organic polymers are fabricated and also the latter’s role in solar devices.
Hence the functionality of solar cells is described with some quantified parameters;
thereby, we here define those parameters, mainly with two quantified parameters
- the current–voltage (J–V) measurement and power conversion efficiency (PCE)
(Furkan and Mehmet Emin 2010). The current–voltage (J–V) measurement is the
foremost tool for determining the solar cell’s performance as it demonstrates
the various fluctuations in power and voltage generated by a photovoltaic device.
The second factorthat affects how well a solar cell performsisits PCE, defined asthe
proportion of power generated by the solar cell to the optical power of incident
light. The graph of J–V of a solar cell is plotted between the current density J–V
curves by changing the external load under sun irradiation. Notably, this parameter
includes energy loss owing to the difference in externally applied voltage and that of
the emitted photons, where internal voltage drop is also considered. Thus, PCE will
always be less than 100%. Another term, power density or flux, tells us about the
power generation of each square meter of a cell, whereas PCE describes the solar
cell’s total power. The output energy of the solar cells is described in terms of three
other parameters, namely short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage
(VOC), and fill factor (FF). The active layer’s ability to absorb photons, the efficacy of
free charge carrier creation, and the charge collection all affect the JSC or the device
photocurrent at zero bias. The difference between the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) of the donor material and the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) of the electron acceptor fullerene derivative, known as the VOC or
photovoltage at zero current density, determines the photovoltage (Mi et al. 2014).
Moreover, the parameter FF determines the maximum power from a solar cell with
respect to VOC and JSC, which hence, determines the maximum power from a solar
cell (Jain and Kapoor 2004; Green 1981). The FF can be described as the ratio of
the maximum power from the solar cell to the product of VOC and JSC. The active
layer’s balanced charge transport and recombination characteristics are necessary
for the FF to function. The standard illumination has an intensity of 1000 W m−2
(AM1.5 G).
3.1.2 Generation of Solar Cells
Solar cell devices are technological marvels that generate free charges when moving
through semiconductors by means of sunlight, converting the light energy into elec￾tricity (Bagher et al. 2015). In literature, various forms of solar cells are reported
depending on the materials used to manufacture them (Soga 2006). First-generation3.2 Organic Solar Cells 57
solar cells are silicon-based crystalline devices. The method was first identified in
1839, and later in 1954, Chaplin, Fuller, and Pearson manufactured the first solar
cell (Perlin 2004) and introduced it to the world. This generation of solar cells was
created using monocrystalline or polycrystalline silicon crystals on silicon wafers.
However, high manufacturing and process costs are the main drawback of this type
of solar cell type (Razykov et al. 2011). In terms of cost, the polycrystalline form
was cheap but less efficient among single-crystal, amorphous, and polycrystalline
silicon. These silicon-based photovoltaic devices are long-lasting compared to other
non-silicon-based solar devices. As with the rise in temperature, the solar panels
lose some of their efficiency, so, as a necessary consequence, these panels are being
arranged in such a way that they get better air circulation. Monocrystalline silicon
solar cells exhibit maximum efficiency of up to 25.6% (Masuko et al. 2014; Jošt et al.
2022), whereas polycrystalline ones show conversion of up to 19.3%.
In 1970, second-generation solar cells were introduced; these were thin films
composed of layers of semiconductor materials having only a few micrometers of
thickness, mainly composed of cadmium telluride (CdTe) (Hubbard et al. 2008) and
copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) (Chirila˘ et al. 2011) and on coupling with
n-type materials they resulted in p-n junctions (Shah et al. 1999). CdTe exhibits a
bandgap of 1.5 eV, allowing in a matching solar spectrum absorption. According
to a report, the maximum power conversion of CIGS cells was 22.6%, whereas the
GaAs solar cells obtained 28.8% (Ren et al. 2017) in all single-junction solar cells
containing a bandgap of 1.42 eV (Green et al. 2018, 2021).
Recently, third-generation solar cells have been reported based on new materials
besides silicon, such as organic polymers and dyes. Under this generation, organic
solar cells (OSCs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), quantum dot solar cells
(QDSCs), and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are included (NREL 2019). These
photovoltaic devices have been explored extensively owing to their several ben￾eficial properties such as low manufacturing cost, light weight, flexibility, and
large area; features that allow them to be applied in wearable devices, calculators,
building photovoltaics, and other domains. According to a report, PSCs have
obtained a PCE of 24.2% (Jung et al. 2019) and still progressing (25.8%) (George
et al. 2022; Kratzenberg et al. 2019). OSCs comprised polymer donor moieties, and
non-fullerene acceptors obtained PCE of more than 19%, but their poor absorption
below 550 nm limited the functionality (Cui et al. 2021). Herein, we will focus on
the OSCs or polymer OSCs, also known as plastic solar cells, due to the plastic
nature of polymeric materials.
3.2 Organic Solar Cells
3.2.1 General Considerations
OSCs or organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells are the technologies used in
third-generation solar cell systems on which extensive research and development
are being carried out (Wöhrle and Meissner 1991; Li et al. 2018a,b,c). They are58 3 Organic Polymers Fabrication for Solar Cells
named as such because, unlike traditional crystalline solar cells that use silicon
as an absorber of sun rays, OSCs make use of carbon-based organic polymers
or small molecules and organic electronics having desirable semiconducting
properties. These compounds are printed onto thin plastic sheets (thickness less
than 100 nm) by typically dissolving in ink. As a result (Clarke and Durrant 2010),
these solar cells are much superior to the former silicon photovoltaics in terms of
greater mechanical flexibility, lesser weight, more color variations, compactness,
and capability to generate high power even under low light intensities. Various
future applications of the OPVs can be envisioned owing to these properties, such
as generating energy by incorporating them in sunroofs of hybrid and electric
cars, on the windows of our homes and offices, achieving small tasks of lighting
and charging cell phones by integrating them in fabrics of tents and bag packs,
generating electricity to power up a medication and vaccine refrigerator in remote
areas with no access to electricity (Khan et al. 2018; Badea et al. 2018). In contrast
to large silicon solar panels occupying the entire length of a terrace or that of a large
solar field, the thin and flexible OPVs thus have the potential to generate power in
places that is otherwise quite impossible.
Additionally, they have cheap manufacturing costs and can also pay back the
energy consumed during their manufacture in much lesser time. The fundamental
core of OSCs involves using light-sensitive organic compounds such as conjugated
polymers, dyes, or small organic moieties as semiconductors operating through the
photovoltaic effect to generate solar power (Lu et al. 2021). Although the power
generation ability of the OSCs is not at par with the crystalline silicon solar cells,
improvements are being made (generating efficiency of up to 19%) by altering
the polymer’s geometry, absorption properties, and synthetic and self-assembly
protocols (Green et al. 2018, 2021).
Heeger, MacDiarmid, and Shirakawa, in the year 2000, received the Nobel Prize
(Rasmussen 2018) in Chemistry for the “discovery and development of conducting
polymers,” a completely new class of conducting organic material having great
potential of being fabricated into organic optoelectrical systems like photovoltaics
and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Semiconductors based on organic
compounds (Chen 2018; Sariciftci et al. 1992) have several benefits and attractive
properties in modern days because of their numerous appealing qualities, such as
their availability, lightweight design, low cost of production, processing at lower
temperatures, along with mechanical flexibility. This chapter mainly discusses solar
cells designed and manufactured using organic polymers. The several roles played
by various organic polymers in photovoltaic performance will be elaborated, as well
as their preparation strategies.
What makes these materials applicable in solar cells for power generation is
that the conducting polymers comprise the sp2-hybridized conjugated carbon
chain, and the conjugation renders the π-electronic cloud of these materials
highly delocalized and polarized. This, in turn, provides the materials with visible
light-absorbing capability in addition to transporting electrical current – two
fundamental requirements for materials to be fabricated in solar cells (Hoppe
and Sariciftci 2007). The alternating electron-donating and -accepting interactions3.2 Organic Solar Cells 59
within the molecules decrease their bandgap energy resulting in intense and broad
absorption bands with high absorption coefficients. The bands, therefore, cover
an array of wavelengths, encompassing those of the visible spectrum. Hence, they
can easily harvest visible light even with a thickness of 100–200 nm only (Brédas
et al. 2009). Conjugated polymers with dissolvable side chain derivatives are soluble
in water or other organic solvents and can be used as ink to deposit over thin,
homogeneous, and flexible films (Günes et al. 2007; Hoppe and Sariciftci 2007).
Some examples of polymers commonly used in PSCs are diketopyrrolopyrrole
(DPP) (Li et al. 2016), B ← N bridged bipyridine systems like P-BNBP-fBT (Long
et al. 2016, 2019), indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) (Li et al. 2019a,b), and
bithiophene derivatives such as 3,3′
-difluoro-2,2′
-bithiophene (Figure 3.1).
3.2.2 Working Mechanism
In general, the OPVs operate by the photovoltaic effect of transforming the radiant
light energy captured from sun rays directly into electric power. First, the absorp￾tion of sunlight by the organic absorber takes place. Through light absorption, the
OPV knocks electrons loose from the organic semiconductor. Electron acceptors
used together with the absorber accept these free electrons and transfer them into
the electrode to generate direct current from light radiation. A detailed four-step
mechanism of polymer-fabricated solar cells is described below:
(a) Photogeneration of exciton: Light energy in packets of energy called pho￾tons is absorbed by the OSCs, which comprise an electron-donating and an
electron-accepting compound in conjunction with each other. Upon absorbing
a photon, an electron belonging to the HOMO of the donor polymer gets excited
to its LUMO, leaving behind an electron-hole. Thus, an electrically neutral
exciton is created.
(b) Migration of exciton: The bound electron–hole pair or exciton moves to the
donor–acceptor interfacial region.
(c) Charge separation: Atthe juncture of the donor–acceptorsystem, the exciton gets
separated into the individual charges – free electron and hole. Dissociation of
the electron–hole pair occurs only at the heterojunction owing to their contrast￾ing electron-accepting and -losing tendencies. Here, the electron on the donor’s
LUMO gets transported to that of the acceptor, while the hole stays back in its
original site of generation, i.e., the donor’s LUMO.
(d) Collection of charge: The charge carriers formed now move toward their
respective electrodes by the influence of an internal field produced by the
variation in the work function of the electrodes and get accumulated.
Hence, in conclusion, the excited hole–electron pairs, or excitons, created in
solar cells split apart into free carriers at the electrical junction between the
electron-accepting and -donating layers before moving through charge separation,
all of which are controlled by an existing electric field (Figure 3.2) (Zhu et al. 2009;
Andersson 2020). The free charges then accumulate in the respective anode and
cathode, which are finally transferred to an external circuit to generate electricity
from solar light.N

3.2.3 Architecture of OSCs
Solar cells that perform well need to be developed, and in this regard, the architec￾tural designs of OSCs are essential to address their issues. The design improvements
of solar cells can provide better charge transfer, absorption, stability, and high PCE
(Venkataraman et al. 2010). In addition, the module design and processing tech￾nologies need to be explored for large-scale application of OSCs (Liao et al. 2010)
(Figure 3.3): (a) single or monolayer, (b) bilayer heterojunction, (c) bulk heterojunc￾tion (BHJ), and (d) tandem solar cells. In addition, the design of graded heterojunc￾tion and continuous heterojunction solar cells have also been reported.
The era of polymersolar cells began with just a single-layer architecture where the
organic layer was stuffed in between a layer of Indium tin oxide (ITO), used as the
anode, and a layer of Al, Mg, or Ca metal, performing as the cathode. Here, a
conductor connects the two electrodes to an external circuit, and an electrical field
is created in the layers of the OSCs due to the difference in the electrode’s functions.
The PCE of single-layer OSCs is limited owing to the lesser diffusion length of the
photogenerated excitons, which hence causes greater electron–hole recombination.
However, the <1% quantum efficiency as well as <0.1% PCE achieved by these
devices paved the way for better devices with bilayer planar heterojunction and BHJ
architectures. These second generations of polymeric solar architectures incorpo￾rate electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) materials in their device structure.

The electrostatic force generated at the heterojunction between the two materials,
as a result of the variation in their ionization potentials, causes the excitons to
dissociate much more efficiently than that achieved in the homojunction of a
single-layer solar cell (Nelson 2002).
Bilayer heterojunction solar cells were the first photovoltaic systems to have
incorporated this concept in 1986 (Tang 1986). A CuPc/PV bilayer heterojunction
photovoltaic device was synthesized with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) as the
D and a perylene tetracarboxylic derivative (PV) as the A, sandwiched amidst an
anodic ITO electrode and Ag cathode resulting in PCE of approximately 1%. The
charge separation induced at the heterojunction provided a distinct advantage of
not having to rely on an external electric field for the same (Tang 1986). Many more
bilayer devices were synthesized over the years, but they suffered the limitation
of exciton diffusion length (Menke and Holmes 2014). This exciton diffusion
length is related to the distance between the excitons and the heterojunction. Since
the excitons need to travel to the junction within their lifetime to get separated
into their charges, only those excitons get successfully dissociated, which are
photogenerated near the donor-acceptor interface of the bilayer heterojunction,
while the others recombine. As excitons generated in organic polymers live for a
very limited amount of time, their maximum diffusion length is confined to only
20 nm. Correspondingly, an extremely small percentage of the excitons generated
gets converted into their charge carriers (Li et al. 2018a,b,c). The outcome of this
limitation was the BHJ polymeric solar cells in which both A and D are blended
such that the junction of exciton creation is not confined to a particular position.
Charge separation can thus effectively occur at any position of the photoactive layer,
thereby leading to a more electric current generation.
3.2.4 Preparation Techniques
Different strategies are adopted to produce organic polymer solar cells based on
thin films. One of the most commonly used tactics is vacuum evaporation which
is for low molecular-weight polymers; however, solution processing is used for
higher molecular-weight materials (Hoppe and Sariciftci 2004). It can be attributed
to the fact that higher molecular weight materials or polymers decompose at high
temperatures, resulting in the formation of greater molar masses, which makes
evaporation difficult. Hence solution processing is advantageous as it performs
under low temperatures. The standard fabrication techniques with examples are
discussed below.
3.2.4.1 Spin Coating
This laboratory solution-based technique is a low-cost method that deposits a
homogeneous layer on the surface of a solid through the application of centrifugal
force while also necessitating a liquid–vapor interface (Mammeri 2019; Yilbas et al.
2019). Generally, a drop of the material is placed at the center of a circular surface,
and upon rotation, the drop turns into a uniform thick film of 1–10 μm (Liu and
Kelly 2014). The centrifugal force upon rotation induces the liquid to spread into a3.2 Organic Solar Cells 63
film, and the solvate rapidly evaporates. Depending on the required film thickness,
the rotational speed is regulated at a given value. For instance, on 125-mm sili￾con wafers with 0.5–1.5 m thickness, spin coating of poly(1H,1H-perfluorooctyl
methacrylate) solutions has been carried out. The measurement of the thickness of
the film can be investigated by these factors: solvent evaporation rate, the velocity
of the spinning substrate (spin rate), and the viscosity of the coating solution.
Accordingly, controlling or monitoring these parameters is essential for better film
formation. Burmann et al. (2014) described that solvent evaporation affects the film
or membrane casting, and slow evaporation is preferable to defeat free membranes;
however, the rotational time has no significant role. The inexpensive spin-coating
approach is often used to make BHJ filmsfor large-area organic cells. In comparison
to films produced without technology, these function better and are simpler to
duplicate. In 2014, Kelly et al. reported hybrid PSCs that achieved more than
10% PCE upon the solution-processed spin-coated method (Liu and Kelly 2014).
Zhang and co-workers employed a PTB7 polymer in a solution-processed PSC that
obtained a PCE of 13.29% under ambient air compared to its counterparts which
needed a more sophisticated environment (Du et al. 2015a,b). The results suggested
that the spin-coating technique enhanced absorption capacity and maintained the
quality of the film, thus improving its efficiency.
3.2.4.2 Blade Coating
Doctor-blade coating or blade coating is one of the popular fabrication techniques
in which a sharp blade is positioned at a set distance from the substrate surface
(Sankaran et al. 2016; Hsu et al. 2022). In front of the blade lies the ink composi￾tion. After that, a wet film is left on the substrate and is dried as the blade is moved
linearly across it. The gap between the substrate and the blade is smaller than the
final thickness. The viscoelastic characteristics of the solution and the coating rate
impact the wet film’s eventual thickness. Blade coating is more resource-efficient
than spin coating. It can be used for the scaling up of OSCs layer deposition because
the drying conditions are closer to those produced with industrial processing The
reproducibility of the wet layer film’s thickness is, however, weak. This occurs as
a result of the solution’s shearing rate affecting the ultimate film thickness. This
method works well to produce thicker films from a viscous solution as well as coat￾ings on a big scale.Itsrestriction isthat it cannot achieve uniformity at the nanoscale
and in extremely thin layers that spin coating can.
Some reports also suggested that the small-scale laboratory-based device per￾formance could not deliver the same result when implemented on a large scale.
Thus, more investigations need to be done to achieve effective results on a large
scale by improvement in scale-up techniques. Consequently, fabrication techniques
and device stability need to improve, which could cause a substantial increase in
efficiency. These issues are explored from time to time by researchers. For example,
based on this spin-coating method and upon scaling-up using blade coating,
Son et al. described the mechanism of PBDB-T (poly[2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)
thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′
]dithiophene)-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis
(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′
] dithiophene-4,8-dione)]) based BHJ solar cells64 3 Organic Polymers Fabrication for Solar Cells
with fullerene or non-fullerene acceptor using the blade-coating technique (Park
et al. 2020). This polymer with PC71BM in another BHJ film-based solar cells
obtains similar morphology with an active surface area of 1.35 cm2 irrespective of
coating temperature. However, the processing affected non-fullerene ITIC-based
BHJ films, which was evident by the increase in the blade coating’s processing
temperature, which increased their efficiency by around 4% at 50 ∘C. Because of
the ITIC’s extensive aggregation and its resulting slow evaporation, there was a
substantial decrease in the power conversion when the coating was performed
at room temperature. This outcome which ranks among the best of large-area
Perovskite cells offers research requirements for a smooth transfer from small-area
coverage spin-coating technology to big-area (here active area 58.5 cm2) covering
roll-to-roll technology.
Spin-coating techniques to integrate OSC are limited in the laboratory and
unsuitable for industrial scale (Diao et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2017; Hoang et al. 2016).
The doctor blade coating was used for large-scale production that can monitor the
morphology of the film. In comparison to spin-coating techniques, blade coating
offers a better rate of bleeding, higher crystallization, and greater molecular orien￾tation, resulting in improved photovoltaic performance. Reports on blade-coating
methods being adopted in semitransparent OSCs (Zhang et al. 2018a; Gu et al. 2016)
can be found. Zhu et al. used two fabrication methods to study semitransparent
OSCs using low-bandgap polymer and a non-fullerene moiety (Zhu et al. 2020a).
They employed the ternary process by introducing a third component resulting in a
PCE of 12.86% via spin coating. The spin-coating method of semitransparent OSCs
was 10.46%, while that obtained through blade coating was 9.52% PCE.
The small-molecule-based solar cells offer potential advantages over PSC;
however, the hurdle is to regulate the solution viscosity and film thickness. Thus,
adding a third component could possibly erase these issues. Based on blade-coating
work on ternary BHJ solar cells in 2017, Guo et al. outlined a work where a polymer
was presented as the third component to regulate the viscosity, morphology, and
function of the small molecule (Wu et al. 2017). The work mainly described the
effect of coating speed as well as the role of the third component. The polymer
p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 with PCPDTBT employed as the third component increased the
absorption range and enhanced external quantum efficiency. Two regimes are
identified that are affected by coating speed. The film thickness increases upon
an increase in speed that could be categorized as Landau–Levich regime blade
coating. Additionally, the surface morphology improves with increased coating
speed as crystal size increases in both binary and ternary blends. This could
be attributed to the third component that enables better connectivity of small
crystals with better drying. Subsequently, this results in the improvement of exciton
dissociation and hole transport. Moreover, the phase segregation of the acceptor
was improvised with the coating speed with the inclusion of a third component.
Overall, the work depicted the effect that the blade-coating method, with its speed,
has on nanoscale morphology, along with the addition of a conjugated polymer
that could enhance photovoltaic performance. In another report based on the
same strategy, Wei Ma and coworkers created printed OSCs that could achieve3.2 Organic Solar Cells 65
a PCE of 12.02% in an ambient environmental setting (Zhang et al. 2018a). This
blade-coating method demonstrates excellent compatibility in printing large areas
by the roll-to-roll process while assisting in slot-die coating as a prototype tool.
When manufactured through this blade-coating strategy, the ternary organic solar
devices of PBDB-T:PTB7-Th:FOIC provided one of the highest PCE (12.02%) ideals
for printed organic solar panels in the ambient environment. Using blade coating
could accelerate the crystallization and charge carrier mobility of the non-fullerene
acceptor polymer FOIC and the polymer donors PBDB-T and PTB7-Th; however,
their degree of induction varied in the order: FOIC>PBDB-T>PTB7-Th. As such,
the FOIC devices manufactured through blade coating yield greater crystalline
behavior than that of spin-coated FOIC films, but this crystallinity combined with
the electron mobility displays a decreasing behavior on increasing the amount of
PTB7-Th in the PBDB-T:FOIC polymer blends, owing to the fact that PTB7-Th
is much more miscible with FOIC compared to PBDB-T. The method of adding
PTB7-th boosts the photocurrent while still sustaining the crystalline phase very
well. The manufacturing of greatly efficient OSCs to cover large areas has a lot of
potential, all thanks to the excellent synergism in shape optimization provided by
the combined techniques of blade coating with the ternary strategies. The PCE
might be improved to the results shown here, and the whole fabrication procedure
represents a valuable new strategy for making highly efficient perovskite-based
photovoltaic systems.
3.2.4.3 Inkjet Printing
It is ideal to transfer the lab-scale spin-coating method to bulk-scale industrial
processes like roll-to-roll coating and printing since polymers and other necessary
components for solution processing are readily available (Peng et al. 2017). Among
all the different kinds of fabrication processes, inkjet printing has attracted a lot
of attention in both academic research and industrial applications and is thought
to be one of the most promising ways to achieve these needs (Karunakaran et al.
2019). Inkjet printing is a flexible approach to deposit functional layers of organic
semiconductors made of homogeneous molecular or colloidal liquid-phase dyes.
The working mechanism relies on the exact deposition and fixation of ink droplets
with regulated properties that are ejected from the nozzle onto a target substrate.
Inkjet printing uses two most frequently used methods to create ink droplets, i.e.,
continuousinkjet printing and drop-on-demand inkjet printing (Basaran et al. 2013).
Conjugated organic polymers have a given advantage of getting easily dissolved
in water and other solvents when engineered with soluble side chains. This unique
property enables them to be put in service as “ink” for depositing in solar films
through an inkjet printer (Schlisske et al. 2021). The inkjet printing technique
surpasses the limitation of device geometry as it can print the polymer “inks”
at every layer of the solar device. The science behind this technique depends on
releasing tiny droplets from the printer nozzle by overcoming the intermolecular
forces of attraction between the cartridge and ink and also on the drying procedure
of the solvent in which the polymer is dissolved. Using this printing technique,
ultrathin, lightweight, and flexible OSCs were developed for harvesting light energy.66 3 Organic Polymers Fabrication for Solar Cells
The preparation techniques control the solar panel’s transparency, which can open
up greater opportunities for the future. For instance, controlled digital printing
of photopolymerizable N-vinylcaprolactam monomers at desired areas of a PSC
appeared as translucent holes and resulted in a semitransparent PSC that showed a
PCE of about 11.2% (Pendyala et al. 2021). Producing solar cells by inkjet printing
technique is remarkably cheap as the desired polymer solutions can be filled in
refillable printer cartridges; the substrates on which the polymer is to be deposited
are fabricated on a compact disc. This disc is then inserted in the printer, and the
polymer inks are printed out on the desired substrate using the original printing
software. This method thus enables the printing of multiple solar films at a time
and allows the reprinting of a single film to result in a multilayer solar structure.
Apart from being cheap, inkjet printing boasts several other advantages, including
being non-contact, requiring no photomask, employing more material, and being
scalable and in accordance with roll-to-roll printing (Karunakaran et al. 2019).
The advantage of not using a photomask is reflected in the liberty obtained in the
solar cell. For example, different artistic shapes of OSCs were demonstrated on
large areas of solar panels through industrial inkjet printing, which confirms that
this technique allows product customization by giving desired shapes and sizes
(Eggenhuisen et al. 2015). Overall, creating an ink formula with the right viscosity,
wettability, and stability is the main problem encountered while using inkjet
printing to create solar cells. Due to the variation in solubility, solvent engineering
is necessary to filter out a suitable solvent or a combination of solvents for a better
ink formula. The requirement of a smaller nozzle for printing in high-resolution
becomes another significant barrier to the widespread usage of inkjet printing as
it causes nozzle clogging. Hence, the optimization of inkjet printing parameters
needs to be done to resolve these issues.
Here, we have discussed only three deposition techniques of organic materials for
the solar cell’s device. However, several other printing techniques, including screen
printing, Gravure printing, slot-die coating, and spray coating, are also available. We
refer to some dedicated literature reports (Gutoff and Cohen 2006; Krebs 2009b) for
more detailed studies.
3.3 The Role of Organic Polymers in Solar Cells
and Their Recent Progress
Various polymeric semiconducting materials are designed and developed, further
investigating their conducting properties in the solar energy sector. The poly￾mers are incorporated with different functionalized groups or molecules such as
DPP, isoindigo (IID) units, naphthalene diimide (NDI), perylene diimide (PDI),
and thieno[2′

Some reported organic polymersthat have remarkable solar performance are shown
in Figure 3.4 (Zhou et al. 2021; Hou et al. 2019). Based on the properties or design
of organic polymers, they are named differently, for instance, conjugated organic
polymers, asymmetric organic polymers, and porous organic polymers. Depending3.3 The Role of Organic Polymers in Solar Cells and Their Recent Progress 67

upon the bandgap, two types of polymers are found that are implemented in solar
cells; wide bandgap and low-bandgap organic polymers. The prime goal of these
polymers in solar cells is to maximize the solar cells’ efficacy or improvise VOC, FF,
etc., among other factors.
DSSCs are constructed using a TiO2 (titanium dioxide) membrane that promotes
electron transfer to the conductive layer and onto the electric circuit. The smaller
size of these nanoparticles provides more significant benefit, yet these systems are
agglomerated or poorly dispersed owing to the van der Waals forces, resulting in
poor performance. Thus, tremendous research on developing more efficient TiO2
nanoparticles with a combination of various organic polymers has been found.
According to certain reports, polymers are used as templates or dispersants (Lee
et al. 2017). For instance, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used as a dispersant. In
a report, the two different molecular weight-bearing PEG chains were used as
a binder with TiO2 to prepare bi-layered electrodes to improve the efficiency of68 3 Organic Polymers Fabrication for Solar Cells
DSSCs (Lee et al. 2006). The low-molecular-weight P1 (20,000) and P2 with higher
molecular weight (200,000) of the PEG chain is combined with itself or each other
to make four systems, among which P1/P2 system shows better performance in
ideal condition. The greater surface area, along with extra-large pore size, results
in better electron transport, which thereby helps in maximizing energy conversion
(up to 9.04%).
Li et al. reported a method for the nanoporous film preparation by using a copoly￾mer consisting of styrene and butyl acrylate. When these films were employed in
solar cells (Li et al. 2009), the device performed better by a factor of 2.7 in terms
of per weight. In another report, the PEG polymer gel with molecular weights
1000 and 4000 was used as an electrolyte to overcome the disadvantages associated
with a liquid electrolyte, such as stability in the long term. In addition to these
polymeric gels, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) 60,000 was also used, which showed
better performance (0.083%) among all, with a FF of 59.84.
Moreover, these polymeric electrolytes enhance the current density-voltage of
DSSC compared to other liquid electrolytes (Seni and Puspitasari 2017). Never￾theless, the dispersion issue of TiO2 can be resolved with PEG polymer, yet the
reports suggested that it can also trap the photo-excited electron, which could be
another issue. Apart from this, polymers are also used with mesoporous TiO2 film
to prepare an organized film that enhances the light-scattering effect of metal oxide
(Ahn et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2013). For instance, polystyrene (PS), PVC-g-POEM
(comprising poly(vinyl chloride) backbone and poly(oxyethylene methacrylate)),
and PLMA-POEM (comprising poly(lauryl methacrylate) [PLMA] and hydrophilic
poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) [POEM]) (Figure 3.5).
Another novel class of solar cells generated from quantum dots, termed
quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), were the utmost regular polymer is
polysulfide/sulfide (Sn2−/S2−), was used as an electrolyte (Chakrapani et al. 2011).
This electrolyte offers high stability to QDs and increases the high open-circuit
voltage, but it requires high redox potential that decreases the overall VOC. Other
alternatives were investigated but failed to match the expectations. Afrooz et al.

modified the polysulfide electrolyte by incorporating aromatic or linear amine as
additives to enhance the functionality of QDSCs (Beiraghdar et al. 2021). The same
group also employed thiourea and urea moiety in the electrolyte. The investigation
revealed that among all aromatic amines, 1,8-naphthalenediamine shows better
results, and diethylamine and thiourea are other moieties that present better power
conversion. Polymers are exploited as additives with polysulfide electrolytes. These
polymer additives in polysulfide electrolytes are one of the better methods that
control charge recombination occurring at the interface between the photoanode
and electrolyte, yielding greater PCEs (Dürr et al. 2006). The additives are adsorbed
on TiO2 nanoparticles and lower the charge recombination by protecting surface
traps of TiO2. Zhong and coworkers utilized a method in which PEG polymer in
combination with polysulfide was adopted to suppress the charge recombination in
the surface of TiO2/QDs/electrolyte compared to polysulfide electrolyte (Du et al.
2015a,b). Due to the steric factor, the recombination of charges did not occur, and
it subsequently improvised the PCE from 5.80% to 6.74%. This work is not efficient
apart from CdSe-sensitized QDSCs. Thus, more exploration will be needed. Later, in
another report, the same group used a functional polymer, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
(PVP), increasing the FF and the VOC. Also, this additive was compatible with a
wide range of QDSCs. This is because PVP provides a barrier to the photoanode that
hinders the surface defect of TiO2, along with suppressing charge recombination.
Overall, the PCE in CdSexTe1−x of 9.77% was afforded with PVC additive (Jiang et al.
2016). Xinhua Zhong (Sun et al. 2018) evaluated the effect of different PEG polymers
having molecular weights ranging from 300 to 20,000 in CdSe, and Zn–Cu–In–Se
QDSCs. The polymers mentioned above have shown affirmative response on VOC;
however, the higher generation PEG exhibits an unfavorable impact on FF and
short-circuit density (JSC).
Electrolytes made from gel polymer work as a replacement for the usual
electrolytes in QDSCs owing to their minimal cost, lightness, and flexible nature.
Poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PAAm-PAA) is compatible with the electrolyte;
hence, Buraidah and his team employed this polymer in QDSC (Lee et al. 2020).
In 2020, when Dassanayakee and his group infused PbS QDs in polymeric gel
electrolytes to investigate their role in solar cells (Dissanayake et al. 2020), they
found that the polysulfide liquid, when incorporated with CdS QD, increased the
solar cell’s efficiency from 1.19% to 1.51%, whereas PbS QD-based nanofiber gel
exhibited enhancement in PCE from 0.94% to 1.46%. The reason is that the conduc￾tivity ofsulfide anion increased owing to indirect ionic dissociation facilitated by the
quantum dots. Improving hole-extracting capacity by the better redox electrolyte
could be another way of boosting the power conversion in QDSCs. In this regard,
Maitia et al. demonstrated a negatively charged polyurethane gel electrolyte that
can transmit ions, which is explored in 3-sulfanylpropanoic acid functionalized
CdS QDSCs (Kumar et al. 2022). Generally, polyurethanes consist of hard and
soft segments, and here aliphatic polyurethanes with pedant groups are used. The
system’s oxidized hole was trapped with the electrolyte’s redox active group. The
nature of polyurethane chains controlled the electrical conductivity as well as
thermal stability, and this conductivity could further increase upon an increase in70 3 Organic Polymers Fabrication for Solar Cells
negative ion concentration. Hence, the photovoltaic conversion was investigated
by changing chain composition (by varying soft segment and pedant moiety), and
urethane moiety achieved a maximum conversion of about 1.16%. Besides organic
polymers, natural biopolymers or modifications of these polymers are also used to
modulate polysulfide electrolytes (Rasal et al. 2021).
A new type of organic polymer, porous organic polymers or POPs, has attracted a
great deal of attention due to their excellent pore size and surface area (Zhang et al.
2020; Lee et al. 2020) with other excellent properties such as thermal and chemical
stability. The electrical tunability and the host–guestsystem of these polymers could
be advantageous for charge transport as well as separation. These porous systems
are composed of linkers and nodes to form networks of monomeric building blocks,
resulting in various topologies. Also, thanks to their high dimensional geometric
structures, they can actively participate in electron/hole transportation irrespective
of direction, subsequently finding applications in a broad disciplinary range. One
such role is their use in a diversity of solar cells. Different types of POP materials
are reported based on their amorphous or crystalline nature. The amorphous
POPs include microporous (pore size <2 nm) hyper-crosslinked polymers (HCPs),
conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) where an extended π-conjugation and
three-dimensional microporous skeleton are in combination, porous aromatic
frameworks or PAFs that are constructed with aromatic building blocks linked
by carbon-carbon bonds, and polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) where
microporosity can be seen without any covalently linked network. While on the
other hand, covalent organic frameworks or COFs represent the crystalline POPs.
The robustness, tunable topology, and pore size are a few of the advantages that
make POPs exploited in photovoltaic devices. Better charge transport and ultra-long
charge carrier lifetime are used in the advancement of solar cell technology that
leads toward green energy. On that account, the photovoltaic applications by solar
energy harnessing via POPs need a better understanding of photophysical properties
and device design.
PSCs are another group of photovoltaic cells that has sparked a lot of interest
as they can provide a maximum of 25.2% conversion efficiency, compared to
OSCs, which give 20% (Jeong et al. 2021; Cui et al. 2021). In 2013, Bein and
his coworkers reported crystalline COFs that exhibit donor–acceptor frame￾works when used with electron-accepting fullerene molecules and light-directed
charge transfer exhibited by [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyricacid methyl ester (PCBM).
In 2011, Wang et al. reported an inverted polymer solar cell (IPSC) com￾prising a buffer layer of transition metal oxide with poly[N-9′′-hepta-decan
yl-2,7-carbazolealt-5,5-(4′

butyric acid methyl ester (PCDTBT:PC70BM) serve like photoactive layer (Liu et al.
2012). The cathode buffer layer is MoO3-Al, and a dual layer of this serves as an
anode. The Al quantity in the composite controlled the photovoltaic performance
by adjusting interfacial property at cathode buffer/BHJs resulting in an increase
in VOC to 55% Al content. Overall, the device exhibits 0.88V of VOC, with a 70.7%
FF and a maximum PCE of 6.77% under light irradiation of 49.8 mW cm−2. Jiang
et al. developed a technique for obtaining a π-extended CMP on an electrode3.3 The Role of Organic Polymers in Solar Cells and Their Recent Progress 71
interface. Their film’s conducting properties are investigated with fullerenes for
energy conservation (Gu et al. 2015). This electropolymerization method mainly
used thiophene-based monomers which were employed as a photoactive layer with
different concentrations of C60 molecule. The results were a PCE of 5.02% with
VOC = 0.732V and FF = 0.682.
Many other groups have designed, synthesized, and explored several polymers in
terms of charge-selective separation, wide band gap, etc. (Wang et al. 2022; Cai et al.
2016; Li et al. 2019a,b; Ma et al. 2017; Huo et al. 2017). The wide-bandgap polymers
show low PCE owing to a finite absorption window. To tackle this hurdle, Xiaobo
Wan and coworkers developed a building block of dibenzonaphthyridinedione
(DBND) that could be used to synthesize polymers with efficient PCE. The resultant
two polymers were mixed with phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)
in OSCs to achieve a PCE of up to 5.75% and 6.32% (Cai et al. 2016). In another
report, the same group reported the role of fluorine in a different position (para and
ortho-) in a conjugated polymer backbone, which overall affects the PCE in solar
cells (Cai et al. 2017). In a similar type of report, the group investigated the O- and
N-alkylation of the polymer donor tetracyclic lactam in OSCs.
Improvementsin the PCE of the OSCs have been achieved by improving the donor
polymers in BHJ structure, which is an intermix of two types of system – donor and
acceptor. The donor participates in the processes of excitation and dissociation, and
hence, by increasing donor substances’ functionality, the OSCs’ efficiency could
be enhanced. One way to achieve high-performance donor/acceptor polymer is
by tuning energy levels via engineering electron-rich or -deficient molecules in a
polymer chain. Benzodithiophene (BDT) is used as donor moiety in OSCs owing
to their excellent π–π stacking capacity and hole mobility. However, the available
two types of symmetrical BDTs, one-dimensional (1D) BDT and two-dimensional
(2D) BDT, exhibit some disadvantages. Thus, researchers came up with a solution
to address these disadvantages by combining these two together, known as the
“symmetry-breaking” strategy resulting in asymmetric organic polymers (Liu
et al. 2016), introduced by Yang et al., termed asymmetric organic polymers, have
garnered attention in the field of OSCs in recent decades (Zhao et al. 2022).
In recent times, different asymmetric backbone-bearing polymers have been
reported (Lin et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2016; Qin et al. 2017; Fan et al. 2014; Qiu et al.
2015; He et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2016). The alkyl and alkoxy groups offer different
benefits; as for the tuning energy level, alkyl side chains are preferable, but JSC
and FF values are prominent in alkoxy side chains. Thus, Hoang et al. (2015)
reported and developed asymmetric BDT derivatives bearing polymers for the
BHT solar cells that omitted the issue created by the alkyl group. Basically, the
BDT moiety was modified with alkyl and alkoxy chains on two sides, resulting in
a suitable HOMO energy level and effective JSC and FF. An efficiency of 7.64%
was achieved with 4-octyl-8-octyloxy-BDT moiety based on this strategy outper￾forming counterparts containing symmetric dioctyl-BDT showing PCE of 6.48%
(Figure 3.6). Further structural changes in side chains subsequently afford an 8.12%
PCE owing to the improvement in hole mobility and balance of hole/electron
mobility.S

Figure 3.6 Reported various types of polymer with their PCE values.3.3 The Role of Organic Polymers in Solar Cells and Their Recent Progress 73
Cirpan and coworkers have modified conjugated polymers composed of BDT and
benzothiadiazole with selenophene and fluorine units for the BHJ solar cells (Aslan
et al. 2021). The fluorine substitute polymers showed greater negative homo energy
and achieved PCE of 2.63% with JSC of 7.24 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.72V, and FF of 50.6%.
In a report, a PCE of 3.41% was achieved under AM1.5 G illumination was achieved
with a difluoroquinoxaline and diketopyrrolopyrrole-based conjugated polymers in
OSCs. These low-bandgap polymers consist of electron-deficient difluoroquinoxa￾line and diketopyrrolopyrrole substrates and electron-rich thiophene or bithiophene
units that result in a push–pull system with an increase in HOMO energy level. Fur￾ther, the effective polymer was blended with the synthesized copolymers with the
fullerene PC71BM resulting in high-performance PSCs (Keum et al. 2022). In terms
of the low band gap or low-energy HOMO of a conjugated polymer, the group of
Youngeup Jin introduced a fused phenylring in the polymer, with 2-fluorophenazine
serving as an acceptor moiety (Lee et al. 2022).
The hydrophobic alkyl side chains are vividly used in active materials for solar
cells because of their controlled self-assembly and strong ability to increase sol￾ubility. However, recently hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chains have
been widely employed owing to their flexibility and less steric factor. The work
reported by Wang et al. revealed that the integration of the OEG side chain in
the conjugated polymer (Meng et al. 2015), poly[2,7-fluorene-alt-5,5-(4,7-di-2-
thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] results in lowering the distance of π–π stacking in
addition to increasing hole mobility. Additionally, the film showed a bathochromic
shift spectrum and low bandgap compared to the side chains of alkyl groups.
A PCE of 4.04% was achieved from this PSC device upon performing with a
polar nonhalogenated solvent that was ascribed to the polar nature of the OEG
chain. However, increasing the OEG chain’s length limited the hole mobility; that
being the case, a suitable length of the OEG chain with a higher charge carrier,
crystallinity, and narrower bandgap are critical features that call for maintenance
in high-performance device development. Mainly, the OEG side chain in polymer
donor are exploited with fullerene blends; however, limited investigations are
found with non-fullerene. You et al. examined the role of the OEG chains with
non-fullerene molecular acceptors and compared them to the alkyl chain. The
authors used triethylene glycol (TEG) and decyl chain in a conjugated polymer
DICTF with a non-fullerene acceptor blended with a polymer donor, resulting in
PCE of 3.09% and 6.93%, respectively (Zhang et al. 2018b). The decrease in PCE for
the TEG side chain is unexpected, which was accounted for by the difference in the
system’s morphology. Thus, the effect of the OEG chain on the polymer backbone
with a non-fullerene acceptor needs investigation with more suitable engineering.
Incorporating hydrogen-bonding units in the side chain of the polymer for solar
cells could effectively improve the orientation and morphology. Effective hole
mobility is a way to develop high-performance solar cells. In these regards, Zhang
et al. demonstrated that urea containing alkyl chain and branching alkyl chain
in diketopyrrolopyrrole-quaterthiophene conjugated polymer offered higher hole
mobility than without urea-functionalized polymers (Yao et al. 2016). The three
polymers with three different ratios of urea-based alkyl chains vs branching alkyl74 3 Organic Polymers Fabrication for Solar Cells
chains were prepared, which could lead to 13.1 cm2 (Vs)−1 and, when intermixed
with PC71BM, results in a maximum of 6.8% PCE. These outcomes are due to the
lamellar packing arrangement of the alkyl chain, which enhances the interlayer
packing and thin-film morphology. A report by Gu et al. suggested that careful
selection of hydrogen bonding in a conjugated polymer is necessary as it offers a
strategy to enhance mechanical performance, whereas it could be unfavorable for
device performance (Galuska et al. 2022). Rondeau-Gagné et al. have introduced
amine moiety in the alkyl chain capable of showing hydrogen bonding which gov￾erns the conjugated polymers’ solid-state structure and self-assembly (Ocheje et al.
2018). This diketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymer is incorporated with 5−30 mol%
of amides that advance the charge carrier’s mobility up to 2.46 cm2 (Vs)−1 owing
to the formation of lamellar packing at the expense of intramolecular hydrogen
bonding without hampering conjugation. The account on the conjugated polymer
that consists of carbazole and cyanoacetic acid results in donor–acceptor type
system employed in DSSCs and OPV cells are demonstrated. This multifunctional
system achieved PCE with a value of 4.11% in DSSCs (Chang et al. 2011).
Some of the lactam, imide-functionalized, and asymmetric polymers are shown in
Figure 3.6 that hold remarkable conversion efficiencies(P5: Abdulahi et al. 2019; P6:
Shi et al. 2020; P7: Liao et al. 2019; P8: Zhao et al. 2020; P9: Huang et al. 2015; P10:
Liu et al. 2020a; P11: Chai et al. 2021). An exceptional photovoltaic work reported
in 2010 by the team of Luping Yu described that benzodithiophene polymer reached
PCE up to 7.4% upon blending with PC71BM in polymer BHJ solar cells (Liang et al.
2010). These innovative semiconducting polymers exhibit a low bandgap of about
1.6 eVthatshows absorption at the red-lightregion. The good structural design of the
polymer offered various advantages, such as decent hole mobility, good solubility,
and worthy VOC (Sharma et al. 2021). Lee and coworkers created a material with
a hole-transporting ability for use in PSCs. The material was based on a diketopy￾rrolopyrrole system, which was further engineered with different side chains. As a
result, the PCE could be enhanced from 8.32% to 17.64%, and this maximum value
could be increased to 20.19% with an FF of 73.87% upon adding a dopant (P12–P15,
Figure 3.6).
The negative electronic moieties are explored in side chains of the polymer that
are found to be synchronized with the aggregation ability and energy level. The
literature report revealed that such structural modification on the donor part (for
instance, in the BDT unit) improved the functionality of PSC (Hou et al. 2008; Zhang
et al. 2015; Huang et al. 2018; Jia et al. 2019; Hoang et al. 2015; Vohra et al. 2015). A
table with other PV parameters (Table 3.1) is shown. Recently, in 2020, a polymer
fluorinated donor polymer was synthesized and explored in solar cells. The sys￾tem was designed based on fluorination and sulfurization on BDT-composed phenyl
chainsresulting in a new polymer PBDB-PS2F thatshowed a PCE of 13.56%. The role
of fluorine was supported by the fact that the non-fluorinated polymer exhibited a
PCE of 10.36%. The fluorinated PBDB-PS2F system lowers the HOMO energy level
and provides a perfect phase separation film morphology.
The electronic band gap (Eg) of organic semiconductors materials is an essential
parameter that could be investigated for advanced device performance (Scharber3.3 The Role of Organic Polymers in Solar Cells and Their Recent Progress 75

et al. 2021). These band gaps are explained with the help of the HOMO and LUMO.
Hence, molecular engineering in semiconducting materials designing is necessary to
tune the band gap by keeping other parameters in mind. While tuning the band gap,
other factors often become inefficient, affecting the device’s performance. A lot of
attention and research is growing in organic and polymer electronics due to variables
other than electrical and optical characteristics, such as light weight, mechanical
flexibility, and low manufacturing costs. Pomerantz et al. categorized that low band
gap polymer as having a band gap lessthan 1.5 eV using polyacetylene as a reference
point. However, a band gap with 2 eV can be considered low band gap material in
solar cells (references). The D-A-based conjugated polymer with a narrower band
gap (Eg <1.6 eV) allows exploring the NIR range wavelength in solar cells. How￾ever, these polymers usually exhibit low open-circuit voltage (VOC), which hampers
the device’s performance. Thus, the challenge is to develop a low band gap conju￾gated polymer with high VOC that could retain an effective absorption range. The
most widely used low-bandgap polymersfall under the NIR regime, having between
1.59 and 0.4 eV. For the structural designs of better conjugated polymer for solar
cells, it needs to address a few factors such as donor–acceptor role, alternation of
bond length, conjugated structure’s planarity, the effect of different substituents,
intermolecular interactions, and length of π-conjugation.
The conjugated polymers function as donor moieties in photovoltaic applications
and are mixed with acceptor units, resulting in photoinduced electron transfer.
This is known as bulk heterojunction (BHJ). Yang et al. developed an efficient76 3 Organic Polymers Fabrication for Solar Cells
method to develop the polymers PTBTz-Cl and PTBTz-Me by thiazole-induced
method to afford high-performance solar cells materials (Kang et al. 2019). The
chlorine or methyl group-based thiazole unit was attached to the backbone of
the quinoid polymer, increasing the π–π stacking along with a decreased HOMO
energy gap that could assist in retaining redshift absorption. However, owing to the
electron-pulling effect of the Cl unit in the PTBTz-Cl polymer better results in terms
of a reduced HOMO, greater crystallinity, and PCE of 10.35% could be achieved.
Owing to the noncovalent interaction between –Cl and –S, the planarity of the
backbone is enhanced; interestingly, the VOC of 0.94V was achieved compared to
other synthesized polymers that could be beneficial in semitransparent PSCs and
tandem solar cells. Many efforts have been made to develop the advancement of
various materials with these features. Queisser et al. have calculated and found
that a maximum PCE of around 33% could be afforded by using optimum bandgap
polymers under standard conditions. Zhu et al. reported another low-bandgap
polymer based on cyclopentadithiophene and benzothiadiazole (≈1.5 eV) gave
PCE of >5%. Due to enhanced charge-transport properties and energy level, this
efficiency was achieved with PC71BM (Mühlbacher et al. 2006). The literature data
shows that PCE increased from ≈ 4.8% to ≈17.4% along with short-circuit voltage in
the last two decades in BHJ solar cells. Fullerene and non-fullerene-based acceptors
are generally used in BHJ solar cells. The tuning of the HOMO of the donor and
LUMO energy level of the acceptor is important, as well as morphology in the nan￾odomain. Various reviews are available in the literature that describes the progress
and mechanism of low-bandgap solar devices (Parida et al. 2011; Polman et al.
2016). Organic materials are a promising candidate as PCE values are increased in
a short period of time; however, compared to inorganic photovoltaic performance,
organic-based solar cells are still lagging behind (Scharber and Sariciftci 2021; Xiao
et al. 2017; Yoshikawa et al. 2017). The main reason for this might be the low charge
mobility of organic systems that limit sunlight absorption (Würfel et al. 2015). In
the year of 2018, Meng et al. developed and reported a remarkable photovoltaic
work to achieve a conversion efficiency of 17.3% in tandem solar cells (Meng
et al. 2018). Apart from this, various strategies have been developed to increase
conversion efficiency (Zhu et al. 2020a,b; Liu et al. 2020a,b). Gang Li and coworkers
lowered the electronic energy level of HOMO of the PBDTTT-based polymer by a
structural modification that enhanced conversion efficiency. The introduction of
ketone instead of an ester unit results in a PCE of 6.58%, VOC of 0.70V, a JSC of
14.7 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.64 (Hou et al. 2009). Jianhui Hou and coworkers
explored the 2D conjugated BDT-based polymer with different functionalization
for photovoltaic applications (Huo et al. 2011). The introduction of 2-alkylthienyl
groups in the side chain of the aforementioned polymers results in wider absorption
bands and higher hole units compared to alkoxyl substituted units, which results
in conversion efficiency up to 7.59% and 8.79% with advancement in VOC and JSC.
In 2014, the same group introduced three different side units, furan, thiophene,
and selenophene, in the polymer composed of BDT and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene
moieties (Zhang et al. 2014). The absorption band, crystallinities, and aggregation
sizes of the polymers were affected by the dihedral angles between the BDT unit and3.3 The Role of Organic Polymers in Solar Cells and Their Recent Progress 77
the aforementioned side chain. The thiophene- and selenophone-based polymers
exhibit PCEs of 9.0% and 8.78%, respectively. The steric factor of the side chain and
that of the polymer participates in tuning the performance of the solar cells.
According to a report published by Jin et al., the synthesis of π-conjugated
polymers by introducing 2D conjugation was studied. The conjugation was a
consequence of using 4,8-dithienylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′
]dithiophene (DTBDT) as
the donor unit (Chakravarthi et al. 2015). This divinylbenzene-directed polymer
achieved a maximum PCE of 7.10% by inducing intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT) and maintaining HOMO energy levels (−5.21 to −5.28 eV). The ternary
techniques are used to obtain high-performance solar devices. Based on this, Uddin
et al. reported that the ternary device consists of two conjugated polymer donor
systems and non-fullerene acceptor material, IEICO-4F (Duan et al. 2020). A PCE
of 12.1% was obtained, which is 16% more than its binary counterpart. Yang et al.
described a semi-empirical method with a combination of available materials to
achieve a PCE of around 20% (Chen et al. 2020). Conductive organic polymers are
exploited in PSCs as a hole transfer material; for example, the polymer PEDOT:PSS
are employed for this purpose owing to their better film-forming abilities. Another
example is polyaniline (PANI) which requires a relatively lesser price and exhibits
multiple oxidation states, which is why they are employed in solid DSSCs (Xiao
et al. 2014).
Apart from TiO2, zinc oxide (ZnO)is another potential alternative that findsits use
as an electron transport layer (ETL) in solar cells (Chen et al. 2012; Li et al. 2014),
especially in IPSCs.It is environmentally sustainable, possesses good electron mobil￾ity, and is greatly transparent in the Vis as well as near-IR regions (Eg = ∼3.3 eV).
As electron entrapment leads to higher mobility of holes compared to electrons in
most organic semiconductors, it leads to poor electron mobility. But the higher VB
energy level and lower CB energy level of ZnO overcome this limitation by block￾ing holes (Ryu et al. 2017). The simple solution-based deposition process and high
natural abundance also provide an added advantage to this material. Even so, cer￾tain conditions limit the performance of ZnO as an ETL. One such obstacle is the
below-par interlayer connectivity between the ZnO film and the solar cell’s active
layer, which in turn causesresistance in electron mobility. This causeslowerJSC and
FF values. The oxygen surface defectsin the ZnO layerfurthersubstantially decrease
the stability of the device; hence PCE decreases, as it plays the main role in charge
recombination. Methodslike sol–gel used to prepare these filmsresult in their lower
conductivity, further degrading the material’s electron-transporting ability.
Addressing these issuesis crucialto increase theirimpact as ETL and consequently
increase the solar device’s performance for their large-scale applications. In
this context, both organic and inorganic dopants have been used. Inorganic
Li2CO3 doping on ZnO ETL has achieved the highest reported PCE of 10.08% in
PTB7:PC71BM-based IPSC (Qiu et al. 2018a,b). The XPS study also concluded that
doping alkali metal fluorides mitigate the oxygen defects in the ZnO structures.
Comparison between fluorides of sodium (NaF), potassium (KF), and cesium
(CsF) showed that NaF is the most suitable dopant for ZnO in accordance with
the PCE order of 8.64%, 8.39%, and 8.28% achieved in the ZnO:NaF, ZnO:KF, and78 3 Organic Polymers Fabrication for Solar Cells
ZnO:CsF systems, respectively. Doping ZnO thin films with organic water-soluble
materials has proved beneficial in blocking holes and yielding much better electron
transportation. When dye molecules of perylene bisimide functionalized with
sulfonic acid (PBI–SO3H) were incorporated into ZnO thin films, a homogeneous
hybrid ZnO: PBI–SO3H thin film was produced having electrostatic bonds between
the Zn atom of inorganic ZnO and the SO3H groups of the organic dye molecules.
These electrostatic forces of attraction between the two facilitate electron con￾ductivity and a higher hole-blocking ability of the hybrid film. On being used as
a cathode interlayer in IPSCs, an efficiency of 13.6% could be accomplished with
PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F and 15.4% with PM6:Y6 as the active layers (Luo et al. 2020).
Increasing the interfacial area has also proved to be valuable in increasing the PCE
of inverted solar cells with ZnO asthe ETL. Forinstance, the use of nano-ridged ZnO
structures, also termed ZnO-R, results in increased efficiency of 8.38% from 7.41%
and also causes a reduction in electric power leakage (Beek et al. 2005). Another
example is employing nanowire structures of ZnO (ZnO NW), which addressed the
photogenerated electron–hole recombination and increased electron transport effi￾ciency due to its highly organized structure and large surface area (Lee et al. 2019).
Massive groups of hydroxyl ions on the surface of ZnO-NPs are to be blamed for
their insufficient contact with the active layer, decreasing the overall PCE of the
IPSCs. This can be combatted by acid treatment of the ZnO thin films. By treating
the inverted PM6:Y6 solar cell with 2-phenylethylmercaptan or PET, the efficiency
of the solar cell could be increased up to 16.46% (Han et al. 2021). Another way to
decrease surface defects in the nanoparticle film is through surface modification of
the same by silane compounds such as 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS)
to form ZnO@APTMS nanoparticle wherein the hydroxyl groups of ZnO film are
capped by APTMS (Wei et al. 2018). This reduces the oxygen defects to increase
device stability and efficiency.
ITO is employed as a transparent conductive electrode (TCE) (Schmidt et al.,
2009), yet due to a few limitations (for example, chemically unstable, availability),
graphene has become an alternative choice for researchers (Xu and Liu 2016).
Graphene is a promising material that serves as TCE in OSCs (Ma and Zhi 2019;
Rana et al. 2014). The novel properties of graphene electrode, such as excellent
optical, electrical, and mechanical, offers great opportunities to develop flexible
optoelectronic devices (such as wearable devices). For this kind of flexible device,
an annealing-free fabrication process is explored that inhibits or reduces the chance
of damaging the substrate or active component of the device. This carbon material
has been widely explored in OSCs, and PCE is more than 8% achieved (Liu et al.
2015; Park et al. 2014). For instance, Park and coworkers described an approach
of an inverted OSCcomprising a poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b,4,5-b′
]-
dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene
diyl]] (PTB7) as well as a hybrid material graphene/annealing-free ZnO-NP, where
ZnO serve as electron-transporting layers (Jung et al. 2018a,b). Here, n-doped
graphene electrodes resulted from integrating the NPs in the hydrophobic surface
of graphene. The effective charge transfer by ZnO to graphene electrode results
in a PCE of 8.16% on the glass, whereas on a flexible substrate (polyethylene3.4 Conclusion 79
terephthalate) a PCE of 7.41% was achieved. This low-cost and low-temperature
processing approach was based on hybrid material beneficial for OSCs. The same
group reported another work based on the modification of graphene with a thin
layer of polynorepinephrine derivative resulting a PCE of 7.93% in OSC (Jung
et al. 2018a).
To obtain high-performance OSCs with graphene, suitable deposition techniques
that depend on processing conditions need to be developed (Garg et al. 2017).
Among various techniques, chemical vapor deposition is one of the promising
techniques. The silver nanowires (AgNWs) electrode exhibits remarkable prop￾erties in OSCs; however, some issues, like the rough surface, hamper device
performance. These disadvantages are overcome by developing hybrid material
with graphene as TCE exhibiting good mechanical flexibility (Lee et al. 2013).
Zhang et al. (Zhang et al. 2019) synthesized a hybrid electrode comprising
graphene and AgNWs. Graphene: AgNW compos, which was further modified with
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PH1000). This electrode
was employed with non-fullerene flexible OSCs that achieved a PCE of 13.44%
with VOC of 0.829V, JSC of 23.20 mA cm−2, and FF of 69.82%. Notably, this device
retains 84.6% of the initial PCE after bending multiple times. Ion migration of
PSCs hampers the device performance. In this regard, graphene derivatives have
been exploited in PSCs by providing better stability (Su et al. 2020). Wang et al.
described various sizes of amino-functionalized graphene quantum dots that serve
as cathode interfacial layers in OSCs with fullerene and nonfullerene (Wang et al.
2019). Among all, the medium-sized QDsresult in a PCE of 11.87 % and 12.81% with
PBDB-T:ITIC and J71:ITIC. Capilla and coworkers reviewed the role of graphene
materials in OSCs (Velasco Davoise et al. 2022). In 2020, the group of Park reported
a PCE of more than 15% with polyimide-integrated graphene electrodes in OSCs
(Koo et al. 2020). Here, polyimide plays the dual role of carrier film and substrate,
resulting in a thermally stable electrode exhibiting high optical transmittance of
over 92%. The graphene or its derivative played various roles in OSCs, such as an
active layer, electrode, and transport layers. However, the PCE of graphene-based
OSCs still needs to increase to match conventional OSCs.
3.4 Conclusion
The OSCs, DSSCs, and PSCs are just a few solar technologies that have extensively
utilized polymers in their structures. We have discussed the various roles of the
aforementioned polymers in solar cells. Polymers are widely applied as active layers
in OPVsto affect light harvesting effectiveness and performance characteristics. The
polymers are used as dispersants, additives in mesoporous film perpetration, and
also in some solar cells exploited as hole transport layers owing to excellent hole
mobility. The various designing approaches by introducing various moieties in poly￾mer could be one of the ways to make them better-performing agents in solar cells.
In DSSC, polymers can be employed to provide flexibility as pore- and film-forming
photoanode materials and film materials. In addition, because of their high catalytic80 3 Organic Polymers Fabrication for Solar Cells
activity, conductive polymers and their derivativesserve in generating platinum-free
counter-electrode materials.
The polymer with a long chain and suitable functional groups can solidify a liquid
electrolyte resulting in a quasi-solid state of the electrolyte. In perovskite films, the
organic semiconducting materials generate nucleation, govern the crystallization,
and improvise device stability. However, the low conductivity of quasi-solid-state
electrolytes is one issue that needs to be addressed. Symmetry-breaking approaches
in designing novel donor polymers that adjust energy levels and improve solar
absorption range are some key features that assist in high-performance OSCs.
However, the synthetic route might be complex and expensive, which needs to
be solved. The advantages of polymers in OSCs are that they have improvised
device performance by serving various roles. However, the PCE value needs to be
improvised more, keeping in mind the disadvantages associated with the polymer,
such as degradation at high temperatures. Moreover, large-scale production needs
to be done as laboratory results are not matched upon bulk-scale production.

4.1 Introduction
The pressing demand for uninterrupted power supply and to mitigate the use of
fossil fuels and minimize the CO2 emissions ensures considerable research inter￾est for the scientific community to develop renewable sources of an energy storage
system (Fan et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2018; Costa et al. 2021; Akcil 2019). The use of
petroleum products leads to a negative impact over the environment, causing severe
issues of global warming by polluting the air and water (Mohamed and Allam 2020;
Zeng et al. 2015). In the year 2020, global CO2 emission from fossil fuels combus￾tion was around 30.6 Gt CO2 which is almost 8% lower than 2019 (IEA U 2020). It
is expected that the earth will run into petroleum catastrophe in the coming decade
due to the excessive depletion of fossils. To mitigate the use of the above-mentioned
fossils, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a vital role as an alternative energy source
from small portable devices to large-scale electric vehicles (from an electric vehi￾cle to a microchip) (Xiao et al. 2019; Yao et al. 2018; Zhan et al. 2020; Chen et al.
2018). As a result, there is an urgent need for high-energy storage and specific power
devices,such as batteries and supercapacitors. Supercapacitors(also known as ultra￾capacitors or electric double-layer capacitors) are energy storage devices with high
efficiency and low internalresistance that can deliver more energy than batteries due
to their energy storage mechanism. It entails a straightforward charge separation
between the electrode and the electrolyte (Stoller et al. 2008; Raj et al. 2020). Super￾capacitors function as a link between batteries and traditional electrolytic capac￾itors. Supercapacitors are broadly classified into two types based on their charge
storage mechanism, namely electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseu￾docapacitors. Pseudocapacitors store charge at the interfaces using the redox pro￾cess, whereas EDLCs work on the nonfaradaic surface interface of the electrode
and electrolyte (Sarkar et al. 2017; Yu et al. 2011). EDLCs, in particular, operate in a

short time span, and their power densities are determined by their physical energy
storage mechanism and the dynamics of thisstorage process(Leistenschneider et al.
2020). This can then be tuned by selecting an electrode with versatile electrode prop￾erties and adjusting the applied voltage to the device in relation to the chemical
stability of the electrolyte. Research has shifted its attention toward the microp￾orous structural moiety because it provides more active sites for electron transfer
and other physicochemical reaction. As conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs)
have extended polymeric structures, homogeneous micropores, good thermal and
chemicalstability, the ease of functionalization with various organic groups are more
feasible. In lieu of this many researchers and scientific community developed the
composite material for supercapacitor application. Jiang and coworkers (Kou et al.
2011) reported first ever utilization of CMP as a promising material for energy stor￾age application, although previously conjugated polymers are reported to be a good
cathode material for the LIBs (Han et al. 2007).
Supercapacitors are energy storage devices which possesses high-power density
and low-energy density as compared to battery. But if optimization should be
done in a systematic way conjugated microporous materials could be the potential
candidate to possess high-energy density like supercapacitors and high-power
density like battery. Jiang and coworkers (Kou et al. 2011) ionothermally synthe￾sized Aza-CMPs that have suitable pore size, high surface area, and low interfacial
resistance which facilitate the charge accumulation between the electrode and the
electrolyte which in terms provide outstanding capacitive property, high-energy
density, good cycle life, and better stability. The material they prepared turned out
to be an encouraging material for the formation of electrostatic charge separation
layer. They observed that the fused aza-microporousframework conducts electricity
faster, the high surface area and the porosity helped the fast diffusion of ions during
the charge–discharge cycles. It delivered the capacity of 947 F g−1 which seems to
be the best capacity for any material.
4.1.1 Challenges
Although the popularity of CMPs has been increasing linearly in the field of energy
storage application due to their numerous captivating properties, there are many
challenges which restrict their commercial applications. Some of these difficulties
are thoroughly discussed below.
● Because of their limited theoretical capacity, CMPs face significant challenges. As
a result, the researcher or scientific community faces a significant challenge in
designing a porous system with high theoretical capacity.
● The energy density as well as redox potential is low as compared to the inorganic
electrode material. The inorganic electrode material possesses potential 4V vs
Li/Li+, but in case of organic maximum potential confined to 2.5V vs Li/Li+.
So, it is another important challenge for the researcher to develop new materi￾als/methods to compete with inorganic electrode.
● CMPs are mostly an insulator or have very wide bandgap semiconductor that pos￾sesses very little electronic conductivity with poor conductivity.4.2 Microporous Polymer Material 95
● Another significant challenge for conjugated porous organic materials is low
active material utilization because of low conductivity.
● Another significant challenge is the issue of solubility. The majority of CMPs are
not dispersed in NMP or other electrode-processing solvents containing other
additives. As a result, achieving high-quality and uniform distribution of active
materials is still a challenge for the scientific community.
4.2 Microporous Polymer Material
The solids that contain interconnected pores or void having the molecular dimen￾sions of size less than 2 nm and high surface area are termed as microporous
material (Budd et al. 2004). As per International Union of Pure and Applied Chem￾istry (IUPAC) the porous materials are categorized in terms of the size of pores:
microporous materials (pore size: d<2 nm), mesoporous materials (pore size:
2<d <50 nm), and macroporous materials (pore size: d>50 nm). High surface area
and microporosity of these materials play a vital role in the science of adsorption
as well as catalysis, gas storage, sensing, and energy storage applications. There
structures are similar to zeolites, covalent organic framework, and metal organic
framework. Microporous polymers are polymers ranging from highly crosslinked
networked structures to linear contorted ones (Chaoui et al. 2017). CMPs are a class
of porous materials whose structural moiety is similar to that of covalent organic
framework and molecular organic framework having extended π-conjugation
(Xie et al. 2011). Triphenylamine derivatives are good electrode materials for SC
devices as they have high charge mobilities, unique electronic properties, and high
redox activity (Samy et al. 2023). Various researchers have tried to develop some
of the microporous polymers for the supercapacitor application. In this regard
Ahmed Abdel Nazeer et al. (2020) have demonstrated the hydroxyl-functionalized
microporous polymer with twisted carbazole units by FeCl3-faciliated chemical
oxidation for enhanced CO2 uptake and efficient super-capacitor energy storage.
The synthesized material was further characterized with various physicochemical
techniques. They have reported that the material exhibited high surface area of
1015 m2 g−1, rich nitrogen content, presence of polar CO2-philic hydroxyl groups
in the polymeric network, and remarkable porosity of 0.8 nm. The electrochemical
properties of the material were analyzed by employing conventional three-electrode
system. The graphite sheet (1 cm × 1 cm) coated with the slurry was used as working
electrode, Pt and saturated calomel electrode as counter and reference electrode,
respectively. To evaluate the electrochemical performances techniques like cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and charge discharge were carried out with the potential
range of 0–1V using 1 M H2SO4 as electrolytic solution. The material revealed
excellent electrochemical properties of specific capacitance 434 F g−1 at scan rate of
2 mV s−1 and 367 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1, respectively. They have also
found 91% retention after the 2000 charge/discharge cycle at a current density of
10 A g−1. Piyali Bhanja et al. (2018) demonstrated the preparation of new porous
polymer TPDA-1, by taking the precursor 2,4,6-trihydroxyisophthalaldehyde and96 4 Supercapacitor Energy Storage Incorporating Conjugated Microporous Polymer
1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)triazine by using solvothermal Schiff base condensation
reaction. The successful synthesis of material was characterized by using various
physicochemical techniques. The phase analysis and purity of the sample was
done by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The presence of functional group was
analyzed by FTIR and was validated by the UV-Visible spectroscopic techniques.
The surface morphology by FESEM and surface area of 545 m2 g−1 and pore volume
(0.2546 cm3 g−1) was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area.
Due to well-organized distribution of pores in 2D layer of covalent organic polymer
and presence of interstitial space for transportation of electrolytic ions thereby
creating more surface-active sites, they suggested EDLC charge storage mechanism
for the material TPDA-1. According to the report the porous material possesses
excellent electrochemical properties of capacitance of 469.4 F g−1 at 2 mVs−1. At
5Ag−1, 95% retention properties were observed after 1000 cycles. The graphical
representation of synthetic route and its electrochemical properties is shown in
Figure 4.1.
Muhamad Gamal et al. (2022) demonstrated the synthesis of two pyrene-4,5,9,10-
tetraone (PT)-linked conjugated microporous polymers (PT-CMPs) as organic
electrode precursors as shown in Figure 4.2 as probable electrode in energy storage
applications. The materials were prepared through the Sonogashira polycondensa￾tion reaction of ethynyl pyrene (Py-T)/tetraphenylethene (TPE-T) as common units
with brominated pyrene tetraene (PT-Br2) as a redox-active unit. The electrochem￾ical properties of both the synthesized materials were done by using conventional
three-electrode system in which glassy carbon was used as working electrode,
platinum and Hg/HgO as counter and reference electrode, respectively. It was
evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge
(GCD) profiles with different scan rate ranges from 2 to 200 mVs−1 within the
potential window −1.0 to 0.0V using 1 M KOH as electrolytic solution. The elec￾trochemical results high cycling stability of up to 80% and specific capacitance of
440 F g−1 due to its interesting suitable porosity properties, presence of PT moiety,
and rod-shaped morphologies. They have also fabricated the symmetric coin cell
and found excellent electrochemical properties.
Mostafa Ahmed et al. (2022) demonstrated the successful preparation of two
carbazole-tethered CMPs, BC-Py-CMP and BC-BF-CMP, through the coupling
reaction of the novel BC-4Bpin with Py-4Br and BF-4Br, respectively. The chemical
structure of the prepared CMPs was evaluated by FTIR and solid-state NMR
spectroscopy which had excellent thermal stabilities up to Td10 values of around
694 ∘C and char yields of 85.50%. The electrochemical performances of these two
synthesized materials were evaluated by conventional three-electrode system using
1 M KOH as electrolytic solution. The cyclic voltammetry was measured with
different scan rate ranges from 2 to 200 mVs−1 within the potential window of
−1 to 0V and charge discharge as well. The material possess optimum specific
capacitance of 260 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with excellentspecific retention of about 89.60%
after 600 cycles. The electrochemical capacitance of as prepared sample could be
due to the high surface area and greater aromaticity of molecules. The schematic
diagram and electrochemical performances is shown in Figure 4.3.OHC CHO

Maha Mohamed Samy et al. (2023) prepared two triphenylamine-linked CMPs
TPA-TAB and TPA-TBN by single-step Suzuki coupling. The structure of the polymer
was characterized by solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, and functional group was
determined by FT-IR. The thermal stability was measured by thermo-gravimetric
analysis. TGA shows exceptional thermal stability of more than 400 ∘C by applying
a heating rate of 20 ∘C min−1 under a nitrogen environment. The high surface
area of 490 and 100 m2 g−1 was determined by BET surface area analyzer. The
morphology of the synthesized material was characterized by SEM, TEM, and EDS.
Electrochemical studies were carried out in the potential range of 0 to −1.0V. CV

rectangular area that shows its EDLC behavior. Galvanometric charge discharge
was carried out within the current density of 0–0.5 A g−1. It also indicates pseudo￾capacitive and EDLC properties from its bent-triangular shape. The TPA-TAB CMP
exhibited high specific capacitance of 684 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and with the capacitance
retention 99.5% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. They also demonstrated the practical
application TPA-CMPs cells in the lighting of light-emitting diode. Jie Tong et al.
(2023) developed low-cost electrode material for the supercapacitor application.

(SPMA-BQ)-derived material with monomer units combined through C—N single
bondsis developed. At the required temperatures(700–900 ∘C), the SPMA-BQ mate￾rials were further carbonized and activated. They evaluated the electrochemical
performance using a conventional three-electrode system after successfully forming
the required electrode material. They reported that the optimum specific capaci￾tance measured at 800 ∘C was 414.6 F g−1 in a three-electrode system. They have also4.2 Microporous Polymer Material 99

fabricated solid-state supercapacitor using PVA and KOH and found capacitance of
254 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The SSCs also reveal high-energy density, long-term cycling
stability, and good rate capability, suggesting their application potential in energy
storage fields. Thus, it was proposed that it can be used as a potential electrode
material for the supercapacitor in near future. Nan Meng et al. (2022) developed100 4 Supercapacitor Energy Storage Incorporating Conjugated Microporous Polymer
self-templating pyridyl-functionalized conjugated microporous polytriphenylamine
for supercapacitor application. Nitrogen-enriched pyridyl CMPs were creatively
designed and synthesized as self-templates for the fabrication of nitrogen-doped
porous carbon materials (NCs) via a one-step pyrolysis. The synthesized NCs have a
high nitrogen content (4.6–11.5 wt%) and a large surface area (400–1059 m2 g−1). As
a result, the NCs have an efficient CO2 capture capacity of 14.0–17.0 wt% at 273 K
and 1 bar, as well as excellent electrochemical energy storage properties with a high
specific capacitance (up to 238 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and good cyclability (retained
almost 100% after 1000 cycles). Furthermore, the NCs were used to build symmetric
supercapacitors with a high-energy density (27.7 Wh kg−1) and power density
(7000 W kg−1). Tzu-Hsin Weng et al. (2022) demonstrated three-dimensional (3D)
CMPs (Try-Ph-Th, Try-Ph-Py, and Try-Ph-TPE) containing triptycene (Try) moieties
connected to thiophene (Th), pyrene (Py), and tetraphenylethene (TPE) units
were prepared using one-pot polycondensation via Suzuki cross-coupling. Thermal
stabilities of Try-Ph-Py CMP (Td10 =605 ∘C; char yield = 80 wt%) and Try-Ph-TPE
CMP (Td10 = 517 ∘C; char yield = 71 wt%) were higher than those of Try-Ph-Th CMP
(Td10 = 471 ∘C; char yield = 65 wt%) and other CMP materials, according to TGA.
Based on N2 adsorption/desorption analyses, the Try-Ph-TPE CMP sample had a
high specific surface area (up to 700 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.45 cm3 g−1), as
well as superior electrochemical performance, with a specific capacity of 245 F g−1
at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The high-capacity retentions of the Try-Ph-Th,
Try-Ph-Py, and Try-Ph-TPE CMPs were 75.00%, 85.71%, and 92.85%, respectively.
When used as real supercapacitors, these CMPs provided high specific capacitances
(53, 84.2, and 166 F g−1, respectively) in addition to their exceptional three-electrode
performance. Deok-Ho Roh et al. (2021) demonstrated sono-cavitation and
nebulization-based synthesis (SNS) of conjugated microporous polymers for energy
storage applications. The SNS allowsfor the scalable fabrication of microporous and
redox-active CMP films via oxidative CC coupling polymerization of the monomer
precursor. Surprisingly, the ultrasonic frequency used during SNS has a strong
influence on the synthesis of CMP films, with a 30% improvement in reaction yields
and 1.3–1.7 times increased surface areas (336–542 m2 g−1) at 180 kHz compared
to 120 kHz. Furthermore, we layer CMP films and CNTs via SNS to create highly
conductive, three-dimensional porous electrodes (CMP/carbon nanotube [CNT]). 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
(CP-MAS NMR) was used to examine the crosslinked structures of the CMP films.
Following material confirmation, the electrochemical performances were evaluated
using a standard three-electrode system. A working electrode of 1.0 × 1.0 cm2 CMP
film on ITO glass, Pt wire as counter electrode (CE), Ag/AgCl as reference electrode
(RE), and degassed 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile were used as electrolyte. The
optimal specific capacitance value was observed around 251 F g−1. Finally, an
asymmetric supercapacitor with a CMP/CNT cathode and a carbon anode exhibits
a high specific capacitance of 477 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a wide working potential window
(0–1.4V), and robust cycling stability with 94.4% retention after 10,000 cycles.

Figure 4.4 SNS reaction process and mechanism. (a) Chemical structures of the monomers
and the synthesis of CMP film via the SNS method. (b) Schematic of the three-step SNS
process is as follows: (1) Cavitation: the monomer precursor (0.40 mM monomer and 8.0 mM
FeCl3 in chloroform/ethanol [v/v = 1 : 1]) is injected into the ultrasonic nozzle using a
syringe pump (0.20 ml min−1), where acoustic cavitation occurs in the ultrasonic nozzle
(120 or 180 kHz). The high energy of cavitation implosion accelerates the reaction of
monomers with oxidizing agents (FeCl3). (2) Nebulization: the activated precursor is
nebulized to atomized droplets (8.3−12 μm diameter) at the ultrasonic nozzle tip.
(3) Deposition: the atomized droplets are deposited on the target substrate using N2 carrier
gas (3.0 psi), and the deposited CMP films are further polymerized on the substrate by
thermal energy (140 ∘C). (c) Synthetic scheme for CMPs using either the conventional
synthetic method of producing CMP powders or the SNS method yielding CMP films.
Similarly Siyu Liu et al. (2023) proposed p-phenylenediamine (PPD) as a bridging
agent to encapsulate redox p-benzoquinone (PBQ) into microporous carbon frame￾works. Due to synergistic effects with redox PBQ species, PPD diamine groups can
not only covalently link PBQ molecules to the carbon surface, greatly simplifying
quinone grafting but also contribute additional pseudocapacitance and accelerate
charge transfer. Taking advantage of these appealing properties, the as-synthesized
carbon electrodes (i.e., AC-PPD-PBQ) provided an extremely high specific capac￾itance of 377 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and retained 276 F g−1 with
superior rate performance at 100 A g−1. Furthermore, they demonstrated a maxi￾mum energy density of 70.9 Wh kg−1 with a wide voltage window of 1.8V and good
cycling stability with 84.4% initial capacitance after 5000 cycles using AHS with
NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide/carbon nanotubes (NiCoAl-LDH@CNT) and
AC-PPD-PBQ as positive and negative electrodes.

nitrogen-containing CMP-based composite materials for energy storage applica￾tion. They put forward a solution to the low electrical conductivity and poor redox
activity of CMPs by grafting a nitrogen-containing porous polymer (spirobifluorene
bromide core and p-phenylenediamine [SACMP]) onto amino-functionalized
multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) by in situ polymerization. The porous
polymer MWNT@SACMP was prepared by using Buchwald–Hartwig coupling4.2 Microporous Polymer Material 103
reaction. The existence of imine functionality was done by FTIR which was
further validated by RAMAN spectroscopic techniques. The surface areas and
microporosity of prepared material were characterized by N2 adsorption and
desorption isotherm at 77 K. The BET surface area was found to be 660 m2 g−1.
The electrochemical performance was first carried out by using conventional
three-electrode system by using 0.5 M H2SO4 as electrolytic solution. Techniques
like CV, EIS, and GCD show the pseudo-capacitive nature of the material. At
1.0 A g−1 the galvanometric charge–discharge curve reveals a maximum specific
capacitance of 594 F g−1. Furthermore, they have fabricated a symmetric superca￾pacitor device with two-electrode configuration to evaluate the practical application
of as-synthesized composite. The specific capacitance calculated from GCD was
found to be 254 F g−1. The authors concluded that the porousstructure of nanotubes
provides a diffusion channel for the efficient transportation of electrolyte ions
and is the major reason of high capacitance beside the π-stacking interactions
between the SACMP and the MWNT, the high redox activity of the porous polymer
(SACMP), the high conductivity of the carbon nanotubes, and the surface area
of the composite which are the major advantages for the prepared material to be
a promising candidate for energy storage devices having high conductivity and
stability. Yu-Jen Shao et al. (2023) developed non-conjugated triarylamine-based
intrinsic microporous polyamides for electrochromic supercapacitor (ECS). They
incorporated the TB scaffolds into the backbone of triarylamine-based polyamides
(TPPA-TB and TPPA-Me-TB) to generate microporous structure in the resulting
highly transparent polymer thin films cast on ITO-coated glass substrate electrode.
The successful formation was confirmed by XRD, BET measurement, and density
testing kit. In addition to the conjugated polymers mentioned in the ECS materials,
the triarylamine-based polyamides, the non-conjugated polymers, are solution
processable and exhibit excellent charge–discharge ability with two-stage color
change (green to blue), demonstrating that the intrinsic micropores are caused by
carefully incorporating TB scaffolds and the methyl substituents (TPPA-Me-TB).
The electrochemical performance of synthesized material was reported by using
0.1 M TBABF4/MeCN as electrolytic solution with a scan rate of 50 mVs−1. The
material revealed the excellent charge–discharge ability with a high specific
capacitance of 165.3 F g−1 at current density of 1.0 A g−1. Based on the above
finding, triarylamine-based polyamides are considered as a suitable and potential
candidate for ECS materials. Hua Wang et al. (2019) demonstrated the successful
fabrication of MWNT@CMPs and carbonized MWNT@CMPs for supercapacitors
application asshown in Figure 4.6. Forthe formation of MWNT@CMPs, conjugated
mesoporous/microporous polymers (CMPs) were incorporated onto the surfaces of
MWNTs. The morphologies of MWNT@CMP composites changed as the starting
monomers for polymer preparation were changed. The surface morphology of
as-synthesized material was evaluated by the SEM, TEM spectroscopic techniques.
The existence of functional group was confirmed by the FTIR analysis and was fur￾ther validated with RAMAN spectroscopic techniques. The purity of the sample was
analyzed by powder XRD and the confirmation of the oxidation state and relevant
binding energy of elements was done by XPS analytical techniques. The material104 4 Supercapacitor Energy Storage Incorporating Conjugated Microporous Polymer

possesses high surface area of 1000 m2 g−1 and pore volume of these core–shell
MWNT@CMPs composite materials is large (1.3 cm3 g−1) which directly influences
the electrochemical properties of the material. For electrochemical studies they
have analyzed in conventional three-electrode system where glassy carbon coated
with material was taken as working electrode, platinum as reference electrode,
and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode. The cyclic voltammetry was measured in
the potential range from −0.8 to −0.2V at different scan rates and galvanometric
charge–discharge with different current density by using 6 M KOH electrolytic
solution, and the highest specific capacitance of these composite materials is
248.4 F g−1. It was 269% greater than the control porous carbon. Carbonization of
CMPs moieties on MWNT@CMPs resulted in N- and S-doped MWNT@CMP-C
composite materials. The carbonization treatment significantly increased capac￾itance due to an increase in electrochemical sites during calcination. This study
proposes a method forimproving the electric performance of CMPs-based materials,
as well as a supercapacitor mechanism.
Yuyu Dai et al. (2023) reported the synthesis of three porous imide-based
polymeric composites with carbon nanotubes (pNTCDA-TAPB@5–50%CNT,
pNTCDATAPM@5–50%CNT, pNTCDA-TAPT@5–50%CNT) by condensation
reaction for energy storage application. The porous polymeric materials
(pNTCDA-TAPB, pNTCDA-TAPM, pNTCDA-TAPT) have different pore size
as well as different central moiety of triphenyl benzene, tetraphenyl methane, and
triphenyl triazine. The structure of the composite with corresponding polymer
was characterized by FTIR and powder XRD. The result of XRD reveals that
the polymer having the core moiety of triphenyl benzene exhibits a better crys￾tallinity property. Further the surface area of these three is determined by nitrogen4.2 Microporous Polymer Material 105
adsorption–desorption test and the high surface area of 453.46, 9.87, and 4.50 m2 g−1
was calculated, respectively. The morphology of the polymer and the composite
was illustrated by SEM and TEM. The HR-TEM reveals no distinct morphology for
the three polymers. Tube-type structures with smooth outer surface morphology of
composite were confirmed by SEM. The electrochemical performance was firstly
studied by conventional three-electrode system by using 1 M Na2SO4 solution as
the electrolyte, platinum sheet as counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as reference
electrode. The galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) technique was applied to
evaluate the energy storage capacitance. From GCD the highest specific capacitance
of 217.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 for pNTCDA-TAPT polymer was calculated among the
three polymers. Further to know the mechanism FT-IR analysis was done for
pNTCDA-TAPT at varying voltages. From the FT-IR analysis the author concluded
that along with imide units of the polymer, the triazine units of the central moiety
also participate in the reduction energy storage, electron transport, ion migration
and gives a better capacitance than pure polymeric material. The synthetic approach
and electrochemical analysis are presented in Figure 4.7a–e.
Ahmed F. Saber et al. (2022) reported the synthesis of three conjugated
carbazole-based microporous polymer by making carbazole-based crosslinker
(Cz-3BO) react with monomer of 3,6-dibromo-9-(4-bromophenyl)-9H-carbazole
(Cz-3Br) tris(4-bromophenyl) amine (TPA-3Br) and 5,7-dibromothieno[3,4-b]
pyrazine (TP-2Br). Polymer of Cz-Cz CMP, Cz-TPA CMP, and Cz-TP CMP was
synthesized through Suzuki–Miyaura chemical reaction. The structure of the
synthesized polymers was affirmed through FTIR and NMR techniques. The
structure concluded the presence of high degree of cross-linking and stiffness
which resulted in the reduction of solubility and enhancement of thermal stability.
The thermal stability of the as-synthesized polymers is determined by thermo￾gravimetric analysis under the nitrogen atmosphere temperature ranging from
ambient temperature to 800 ∘C. Cz-TP CMP turns out to be the most thermally
stable polymer with negligible weight loss of 10% up to 616 ∘C as a consequence
of organic groups decomposition, whereas Cz-Cz CMP and Cz-TPA CMP have
a thermal stability of around 560 and 597 ∘C, respectively. The surface area was
determined by BET surface area analyzer. The surface area of developed polymer
Cz-TP CMP, CzTPA CMP, and Cz-Cz CMP was found to be 412, 618, and 623 m2 g−1,
respectively. The morphology of the synthesized material is studied by SEM and
TEM; both the microscopic techniques displayed the microporous structure of the
polymer with the internal diameter range of 100–500 nm with high cross-linkage.
The result of HR-TEM also suggested both the amorphous and porous properties
of the as-synthesized material. Electrochemical properties were studied by the
conventional three-electrode system taking 1M H2SO4 as an electrolytic solution.
The CV was taken in the potential range of 0.1–0.6V at various scan rates ranging
from 5 to 200 mVs−1. The rectangular shape of voltagram suggests a typical electric
double layer. The specific capacitance was thus calculated for the three materials.
The highest capacitance was found to be 271.82 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with a capacitance
retention of 99% for 2000 cycles at the current density of 10 F g−1 for Cz-TPA CMP,
whereas a low capacitance of 43.70 and 67.38 F g−1 was calculated for Cz-Cz and106 4 Supercapacitor Energy Storage Incorporating Conjugated Microporous Polymer

Cz-TP CMPs. The author concluded that as Cz-Cz CMP has the highest surface
area of 623 m2 g−1, the largest pore size of 1.40 nm than the other, the penetration
of ions to the electrode surface facilitates, as a result of which N-rich electroactive
CMP material comes out to be the best material for energy storage applications.
4.3 Conclusion
The incorporation of conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) into supercapacitor
energy storage systems presents a promising avenue for advancing energy storage
technologies. Through their unique properties such as high surface area, tunable
pore size, and excellent electrical conductivity, CMPs offer significant advantages
in enhancing the performance and efficiency of supercapacitors. The synthesis and
optimization of CMPs for tailored applications in energy storage have demonstrated
remarkable progress, showing great potential for addressing challenges associated
with traditional energy storage devices. Moving forward, continued research efforts
aimed at further understanding the structure–property relationships of CMPs, along
with advancements in fabrication techniques and device integration, will be crucial
for realizing the full capabilities ofsupercapacitor energy storage incorporating con￾jugated microporous polymers, thus paving the way toward sustainable and efficient
energy storage solutions for diverse applications.

5.1 Introduction
Polymers are a class of natural or artificial compounds that are made up of massive
molecules known as macromolecules, which are multiples of monomers. These
monomers are the smaller chemical building blocks. Whether a polymer is natural
or man-made depends on the source and the synthesis process. Polymers can be
crosslinked networks of monomers in two or three dimensions, or they can be
lengthy chains of unbranched or branched monomers. They might have flexible
or stiff backbones. Polymers are being frequently utilized and explored in several
technical fields. Natural polymers which are highly degradable, for example,
collagen and chitosan, also find their use in biomedical applications (Paul et al.
2016) and in engineering. The role of polymers in the evolution of technology,
applied sciences, and engineering is quite noteworthy. They have replaced their
metallic equivalents in electrical, medicinal, building, and energy applications. This
is because they are inexpensive to produce and to buy. They have a broad range of
strength, conductivity, degradability, and elasticity and are adaptable to changing
production methods, and it is very simple to modify their properties (Govindarajan
and Shandas 2014). Although polymer has a vast range of uses in both the chemical
and everyday worlds, its future development has been constrained by their low
surface hydrophilicity and wearresistance. The polymer’ssurface hasto be modified
in order to enhance its surface qualities. Surface modification in polymers is the
process of altering a polymer’s surface at the nanoscale level while leaving the
material’s core qualities unaffected and introduce properties which are new and
beneficial on its surface. Some newly introduced properties are hydrophilicity and
scratch resistance which are of prime importance on the surface of the polymers.
The main purpose behind the surface treatment of polymers is modification at
the outermost layer of the polymer to improve its wettability, sealability, printabil￾ity, barrier properties, dye uptake, adhesion to other materials, and resistance to

glazing or interaction with the biological environment, while preserving the desired
important properties of the polymer. This is accomplished by adding certain func￾tional groups to the surface of the polymer.
There are many techniques for altering the surface of polymers. Some of
such important methods, namely, physical, chemical, mechanical, thermal, and
photolytic processes are extensively studied to generate various products with
particular morphologies and structural compositions. The physicochemical prop￾erties are also of importance in pharmaceuticals, electronics, microsensing, and
bioengineering industries. There are also some other common surface modification
techniques which include solution processing, plasma treatment, irradiation
treatment, surface grafting. Here, a detailed introduction of the particular polymer
material, modification method, and modification mechanism is provided. Due to
their increased ability to be altered for specific needs, which frequently involves
modification of their surface properties, polymers have successfully entered
advanced application fields over the past 15 years. As a result, surface modification
techniques have drawn growing interest and now make up more than half of
the worldwide scientific output relevant to polymers and polymer modifications,
as demonstrated by an examination of the scientific output from 2000 to 2016.
The stable bulk characteristics of polymers, including resistance to heat degra￾dation, solvent treatments, and unaltered mechanical strength after undergoing
treatment, make them practical substitutes for traditional metal-based devices.
Polymer surfaces, however, prevent their vast variety of planned applications,
necessitating modification through a number of means. For instance, the presence
of hydroxyl groups causes surfaces to be hydrophilic, which is not always the case
with polymeric surfaces. Therefore, it is essential that surfaces that are naturally
nonconforming undergo treatments to enable their usage in a variety of industrial
applications and to compensate for their inherent limitations.
Surfaces are frequently modified using polymersto provide desirable effects which
are beneficial in the long run for their effective functionality. Due to the adjustable
bulk material characteristics of polymers, such as elasticity, tensile strength, and
density, surface treatments not only increase the efficacy of the present material but
also expand the application range of the material. These surface-enhanced polymers
are widely used in microfluidics (Sinton 2014), biomedical applications (Menard
et al. 2007; Goddard and Hotchkiss 2007; Ikada 1994), textiles (Nikolaev et al. 2014;
Hu 2016), electronics (Behl et al. 2002), water-treatment (Saqib and Aljundi 2016),
and energy industries (Yang et al. 2013).
When the polymer is subjected to chemical, ionic, or light-based treatment
processes that can adjust the surface energies by adding functional groups to the
material (Chen et al. 2016), the most popular route is to modulate the surface
energy of the material (Ferrero and Periolatto 2015) to alter its adhesive (Sojoudi
et al., 2018), absorbing, wetting, or releasing properties for the better. Another
route is to mold the surface roughness (Encinas et al. 2010) of the polymer by
chemical or mechanical abrasion processes in which the topmost layers are
altered by being treated with different types of abrasives. Additionally, the polymer
surface is subjected to nano- and micro-scale roughness, which allows for the
manipulation of antifouling and anti-wetting capabilities. Surface energy of the5.2 Physical Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification 113
polymer and its roughness can be managed by a range of non-invasive techniques
such as ultra-violet (UV) radiation, patterning induced by laser, and corona/plasma
treatment. In this chapter, we want to highlight the differences between property
modification approaches that alter the chemical structure of the polymer without
changing its intrinsic properties. Due to the wide variety of chemical and physical
properties offered by many families of polymeric materials, choosing and modifying
polymers for each specific application is made easier. For instance, certain polymers
are used more frequently in cardiovascular stents (Yakacki et al. 2007) because they
have a lower density than metals and are more flexible than many other materials.
Owing to its cheaper rate, simplicity of manufacture, oxygen permeability, and
optical transparency (Zhou et al. 2010; Boxshall et al. 2006), poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) is frequently utilized in microfluidic devices. The biodegradable aliphatic
polyesters are employed in tissue engineering (Morent et al. 2011) owing to their
least toxicity, high mechanical characteristics, and low immunogenicity. Due to
the many polar hydroxyl groups that are found in cotton fiber’s polymers, it is
particularly absorbent when used in textiles. By preferentially treating the polymer
surface with fluorine-based chemical reagents that may produce functionalsurfaces
because of theirlow surface energy, the hydrophilicity which is extreme forthe cellu￾lose structures can be changed. Classes ofsilanes have been used to modify cellulose
nanofibers so that they function as hydrophobic materials (Baidya et al. 2017).
This chapter explores the benefits and drawbacks, longevity, and durability of
induced characteristics for each approach in order to highlight and offer a thorough
overview of the various ways for treatment of polymer on their surfaces with an
equal emphasis on their field of application.
5.2 Physical Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification
Surface modification using physical techniquesinvolvesstraightforward, affordable,
and scalable pathways. They involve no chemicals and hence they are environ￾ment friendly. They are intended to give preferred surface requirements and also,
durability of the polymer surface is essential for manufacturing purposes (Li et al.
2007; Yao et al. 2011). When compared to other types of treatments, this method
provides polymer surfaces that are stronger and more adverse to abrasion. This
physical modification is carried out as a step in the surface manufacturing process,
unlike other surface treatment techniques where the variation is applied to a
polymer surface that has already been produced. As mentioned before, physical
modification is done prior to the manufacture of polymer. It can done using
injection molding, (Weng et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2018; Maghsoudi et al. 2020)
(Figure 5.1) extrusion (Okulova et al. 2017; Sollogoub et al. 2011) (Figure 5.3), and
lamination template technique (Figure 5.2) (Xu et al. 2011).
Although the physical alteration of surface does not change its in-built chemical
composition, it can influence the wettability of the surface by generating roughness
onto the polymer on micro- and nanolevels. Scientists have tuned the roughness
of the polymer surface for achieving superhydrophobic and omniphobic qualities.
The polymer surface can be simply made more hydrophobic by increasing the114 5 Modification of Surface Properties of Polymeric Materials

surface roughness (Liu and Kim 2014). Using the lamination template approach, Xu
et al. (2011) created superhydrophobic polymer surfaces with exceptional abrasion
resistance by laminating polyethylene (PE) films beside mesh templates. The mesh
was then removed from the PE films, leaving a 3D pattern of orderly microposts on
the polymer surface that matched the mesh’s pitch and apertures.
Correspondingly, with microinjection compression molding technique, Chen and
Huang had given a quick, adaptable approach for replicating polypropylene (PP)
surfaces with producing T-shaped micropillars (Chen and Huang 2016). They used
the roll-to-roll extrusion coating (R2R-EC) technique by simultaneously examining
the replication of the pillars under various conditions (Chen and Huang 2016). The
temperature of the cooling zone had a significant impact on the replication process,
followed by the extruder output, stripper roll, and pressure.
For commercial purpose, there are several ways to create sustainable, superhy￾drophobic, antifouling, and ice-phobic surfaces (Xue et al. 2010; Sojoudi et al. 2016).
The fundamental benefit of physical methods over other techniques for creating
superhydrophobic surfaces, aside from its low cost, is that the use of hazardous
fluorine-based polymersis not a requisite. Furthermore, because the created surface
roughness occasionally affects the polymer surface chemistry, polymers reformed
through physical means remain durable and do not age or degrade.
The physical modification techniques are always preferred, unless otherwise
necessary. The method is only applicable to thermoplastic polymers that are able5.3 Chemical Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification 115

to be treated when solid or molten without losing their inherent qualities like
mechanical power and elasticity.
5.3 Chemical Treatment for Polymer Surface
Modification
Chemical surface modification of polymeric material is very useful in biomedical
applications such as enhancement of the polymer properties without modifying
the surface roughness, where standard physical approaches are insufficient. In this
wet chemical approach, the polymers are treated with chemicals to improve their
surface qualities and to remove microbes and debris to create a sterile environment
on the surface, ideal for biomedical applications. Wet chemical treatments comprise
several techniques for changing the surface of textile fibers, such as dissolving,
swelling, etching, and the creation of adhesion-promoting layers. In polymer
fiber material, surface modification through the wet chemical method is mainly
subdivided into halogenation, oxidation, hydrolysis, complexation, and the creation
of adhesion-promoting layers (Gleissner et al. 2022).
The halogenation method is based on substitution or addition of hydrogen atom
by halogen atoms such F, Cl, Br, and I. For the activation of fibers material by
this method, chlorination is mostly preferred. Chlorinating agents such as sodium
hypochlorite and sodium dichloroisocyanurate solutions are often used for this
treatment (Sun and Sun 2004; Barassi and Borrmann 2012). For example, when
polyamide (PA) is treated with sodium hypochlorite solution, an O-chlorinated
intermediate is formed which further follows rearrangement resulting in a
N-chlorinated stable product (Hardy and Robson 1967). The mechanistic pathways
involved in this reaction are shown in Figure 5.4.116 5 Modification of Surface Properties of Polymeric Materials

The next crucial method for fiber surface modification under wet chemical
treatment is oxidation. In this method, various oxidizing agents such as chromic
acid (H2Cr2O4), nitric acid (HNO3), phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and potassium
permanganate (KMnO4) are widely used (Steven and Burke 2003). Out of these,
KMnO4 shows excellent potential for high-performance fibers surface activation.
These oxidizing agents mainly employed for the oxidation of polymer material
contain weak bonds such as π-bonds in alkynes and alkenes, weak C—C bonds in
glycols, weak C—H bonds present in aldehydes, alcohols, and substituted aromatic
rings (Montazer and Komeily Nia 2015). This method results in the formation of
new functional moieties such as carboxyl, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups on the
polymer surface.
In the hydrolysis method, the polymeric material is treated with alkali to separate
individual fiber from the bundles of fibers. This process creates roughness in the
fiber material by increasing the aspect ratio of the individual fiber particle, and this
technique improves the interfacial bonding of fiber material with the matrix site
(Jones et al. 2017). This technique is best suited for materials that contain ester
bonds. The breakdown of the polymeris accelerated by harsh circumstances and ris￾ing levels of alcohols or certain amines as by products, which weakens the substrate
(Tavanai 2009; Musale and Shukla 2017). The hydrolysis of poly(lactic acid) (PLA)
by alkali treatment is shown in Figure 5.5 (Abdul Hamid 2014).
Out of all alkaline agents, NaOH is widely used for modifying the surface
properties of polymer fiber material, for example, polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) (Han et al. 2016; Vecchiato et al. 2017). The mechanistic pathway leads to
the formation of an anion as intermediate, which further facilitates the scission
of chain length followed by the formation of hydroxyl and carboxylic end group
(Zeronian and Collins 1989). The formation of surface carboxylic groups is directly
proportional to the NaOH concentration. Another route of hydrolysis is treating
polymeric fibers with enzymes. Enzyme proteins are more appropriate method
for the hydrolysis since they act as bio-catalyst which may modify and completely
degrade polymer material. This is a controlled degradation method for surface mod￾ification of fiber material as well as increased roughness and formation of desirable

functional groups on the surface. There are various enzymes are being used for
the treatment. For example, proteases and peptidases are used for the cleavage
of amide bonds in polyamide for the formation of carboxyl and amino groups on
the surface. The mechanistic pathway is shown in Figure 5.6 (Begum et al. 2016;
Kanelli et al. 2017; Kim and Seo 2013). The activity of enzyme can be optimized by
varying different parameters such as pH value, treatment time, concentration, and
temperature (Begum et al. 2016; Kanelli et al. 2017; Kim and Seo 2013).
Another crucial method under wet chemical treatment for surface modifica￾tion of polymer fibers is complexation. In this method the interaction between
complexation agents with polymer material is Lewis acid–base interaction, so, the
polymer which is appropriate for this method must contain a specific Lewis base
site. Generally, polymer chains with non-bonding electron pairs or side groups with
nitrogen, phosphorous, oxygen, or sulfur moieties are suitable for this treatment
(Jenekhe and Roberts 1993). However, these groups should be involved in the inter￾or intramolecular hydrogen bonding or any kind of dispersive forcesfor the effective
surface activation through complexation. Several moderate-to-strong Lewis acids
are used for this method. For example, in case of aromatic or aliphatic polyamides
AlCl3, CaCl3, and GaCl3 are used as a complexation agent (Vasanthan et al. 2004;
Roberts and Jenekhe 1990, 1991).
And the last and most common approach for surface modification of polymer
fibers by wet chemical approaches is the layer deposition method. In this method,
most commonly, the grafting of siloxane and silanes is used to increase adhesion
between aromatic polyamide (PA) fibers and in composites or functional coatings
(Jia et al. 2020). There are several reports published to improve the adhesion
capacity of aromatic PA fibers. Recently Jia et al. reported a grafting process in aro￾matic PA initiated by gamma irradiation using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and
1,4-dichlorobutane. They observed the formation of siloxane bonds between
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and substrate as a result of the grafting of
1,4-dichlorobutane and its hydroxylation (Jia et al. 2020). Another process
suitable for direct silane grafting is the sol–gel method (Landsiedel et al. 2020).
For example, the sol–gel method in an aqueous solution using acidic prehydrolysis118 5 Modification of Surface Properties of Polymeric Materials
of alkoxysilane (TESPSA: (3-triethoxysilylpropyl)succinic anhydride) leads to the
formation of a layer of porous polysiloxane with evenly dispersed hydroxyl and
succinic acid end groups (Landsiedel et al. 2020). The layer deposition is also
achieved via a reaction between polymer fibers with different types of amines, for
example, chitosan, ethylenediamine, or dopamine (Yu et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2013).
Several reports also focus on self-polymerization and deposition of dopamine on
the surface of the polymer to improve the adhesion property. For example, Wang
et al. reported a successful method for polydopamine deposition on the aromatic
PA, which was further verified by comparing the experimental nitrogen-to-carbon
(N/C) ratio (0.11) with theoretical N/C ratio (0.125) (Wang et al. 2013).
In the case of plastics, the sol–gel method is mainly utilized for the formation of
organic–inorganic hybrid coating and UV-curable coating. This method has many
advantagesincluding the requirement of milderreaction conditions and flexibility in
terms of formulation. UV-curable coating presents many advantageousfeatures over
traditional solvent-based coating systems in terms of eco-friendly and energy-saving
curing methods since it is a solvent-free treatment (Schwalm 2006). Various
types of coating material with diverse properties such as antibacterial, antistatic,
corrosion resistance, and antifouling can be obtained from the sol–gel method
(Sangermano et al. 2015). Hybrid organic–inorganic material is an interesting
material where an organic phase and an inorganic phase are interconnected. There
is a two-step method, which is hydrolysis and condensation reaction, involved
in the formation of organic–inorganic hybrid coating, illustrated in Figure 5.7
(Malucelli 2016). This is a conventional bottom-up approach, where a metal alkox￾ide, M(OR)x (e.g., tetraethoxysilane), acts as starting reagent. The experimental
conditions play an importantrole in the synthesis of these materialsforthe synthesis
of composite structures with dispersed phase dimensions under 100 nm (nanocom￾posites). The morphology of these hybrid materials highly depends on various
factors such as molecular weight, the number of the reactive functional moieties

present in the organic polymer/monomer/oligomer, and polymer’s solubility in the
sol–gel medium.
5.4 Plasma Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification
Plasma treatment has attracted considerable attention due to its straightforward
methodology; additionally, this method doesn’t require any solvent or hazardous
chemicals. An inert gas, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, is used in the
surface plasma technique to dissociate and interact with the substrate to modify
its characteristics like adhesion, wettability, and printability (Yasuda and Gazicki
1982; Zhou et al. 2010). A plasma is produced when a gaseous mixture comprising
particles like neutral particles, UV photons, vacuum ultra-violet photons (VUV),
radicals, ions, and free electrons interacts with an electric field or radiation with
a low-to-high electric field of energy. Some of these particles got excited due to
this collision, and when they move back to their ground energy state by photon
emission, it causes plasma luminosity. Based on the gas temperature, plasmas can
be divided into two categories, one is thermal and other one is non-thermal or
cold plasma (Fridman 2008; Desmet et al. 2009). Since polymers are heat-sensitive
materials, thermal plasma cannot be used for this method. So, in the case of
polymer surface modification by plasma treatment generally nonthermal plasma is
employed (Denes and Manolache 2004). Based on the plasma operation there is a
wide range of electron densities and electron temperature (Fridman and Kennedy
2004). There are two types of plasma techniques mainly employed for surface
modification of polymers; one is plasma polymerization and the other one is plasma
ablation (Luo and Van Ooij 2002). In plasma polymerization polymeric coating is
applied on the surface and in plasma ablation, the polymeric layer is removed from
the surface. These two methods are described in Figure 5.8.
When the elementary particles present in the plasma (i.e., ions and radicals)
interact with the polymer surface, different phenomena may occur. The interacting
particles can be modulated by various factors like plasma operating parameters,
reactor design, polymer substrate, and gas chemistry (Kulkarni 2019). The polymer
surface is continually bombarded by excited plasma species, changing the chemistry
and properties of the surface morphology and/or structure (Latag and Vasquez
2018). The interaction between the plasma particles and polymer surface may lead
to a variety of surface phenomena, including surface functionalization, rough￾ness/etching, and crosslinking. These surface phenomena are shown in Figure 5.9.
All of these processes have an impact on how well the polymer adheres to different
substrates, whether they occur in isolation or a synergistic manner (Kulkarni 2019).
In this section, various methods associated with surface modification by plasma
treatment are discussed (Yoshida et al. 2013).

ammonia, oxygen, or with air can produce amine or carboxyl groups onto the
polymer surface (Kull et al. 2005; Sanchis et al. 2006; Lai et al. 2006). So, in order
to introduce various functional moieties on the surface of the polymer, it is very
important to carefully choose the type of plasma source to change various properties5.4 Plasma Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification 121
like surface adhesion properties, biocompatibility, and wettability of the polymer
material (Grace and Gerenser 2003; Hegemann et al. 2003). Further, this method
can be used for the subsequent covalent immobilization for a different type of
bio-polymers (Sathish et al. 2019). For example, it was discovered that plasma
treatments could immobilize a variety of extracellular matrix protein components
including laminin, gelatin, fibronectin, and collagens onto the polymer surface.
This significantly increased the proliferation rate and adhesion force of the cells
(Nardulli et al. 2010; Huang et al. 2007). Additionally, air or argon-based plasma
treatment increases the hydrophilicity of various biopolymers (Luque-Agudo et al.
2021; Mozeticˇ 2020).
5.4.2 Introduction of Roughness on the Polymer Surface
When the polymers are treated with plasma, it is well known that plasma etching
and plasma cleaning occur on the surface of the polymer. Plasma etching is
mainly employed for the microfabrication of integrated circuits. It is now a
most popular and demanding area of plasma-assisted modification technique
for scaling up the usage of polymeric material and applications of circuits.
Plasma etching has also been explored specifically for improving the adhesion
between organic and material surfaces, such as the surface of the cell by altering
the biological surface’s roughness and wettability, which is in direct contact
with the surface of the material (Mirmohammadi et al. 2012). Furthermore,
plasma etching would be a good contender for biomedical material surface
modification since it allows for efficient surface micro-fabrication. In order
to investigate the connection between surface topography and cell adhesion
and proliferation, to date several specific surfaces were developed (Zhu et al.
2021).
5.4.3 Formation of Crosslinking
When a polymer material interacts with highly energetic particles like ions or
radiations, that is, ultra-violet (UV), VUV, X-ray, and γ-rays, that could produce
crosslinking on the polymer surface (Clark and Dilks 1977). When polymers, for
example, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), interact with activated plasma
particles, which results in the formation of radicals on the polymeric surface. This
leads to the radicals-induced crosslinking of the polymer chains and eventually
the molecular weight of the polymer chain increases (Chapiro 1995). Moreover,
crosslinking formation leads to the formation of a 3-D network structure on
the polymer surface, making the polymer layer an insoluble substance (Molnar
et al. 2020; Kolarova Raskova et al. 2018). Additionally, this molecular network
further increases the mechanical strength of the polymer surface (Taaca et al.
2022). The plasma-initiated crosslinking during hydrogel synthesis is illustrated in

5.5 Corona Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification
The corona discharge is an immensely utilized technique to modify the top layer
of polymeric materials before employing it for adhesive laminating, coating, print￾ing, and metalizing. Surface treatment is used to create a functional group that has a
high binding capacity. This allowsinteraction with variousfunctional groupsto form
bindings (Gooch 2011b; Tuominen et al. 2010; Zenkiewicz 2008). Corona discharge
is a process of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) plasma that can be com￾menced in the atmosphere and air ofseveral active and inert gases where it generates
polar groups that are responsible for improving the wettability, adhesive properties,5.5 Corona Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification 123

and surface energy (Tendero et al. 2006). The surface roughness is affected by the
improvement of surface energy unintentionally. The surface energy alters surface
morphology by varying the surface roughness (Zenkiewicz 2008; Tuominen et al.
2010; Gooch 2011b). Corona treatment has many applications in various fields of
science. Applications include disinfection and sterilization of packaging materials
in medicalscience,resin adhesivesin the fabric industry (Brzezinski et al. 2009), and
separation of emulsions (Sadeghi et al. 2013; Moghimifar et al. 2014), where ozone
is used as a gaseous material. Applications of corona discharge are limited not only
to two-dimensional materials but also to three-dimensional objects such as polymer
fibers, pipes, and plastic materials (Zenkiewicz 2008). In the 1960s, the first corona
discharge wasimplemented to modify polymersurface. It was employed in the mod￾ification of polyethylene (PE) surfaces (Kim 1996; Stepczynska ´ 2014; Zenkiewicz ̇
2001).
The surface modification of the upper layer of polymers with corona discharge
is a physical method mostly used in the industrial sector. The setup of the corona
treatment consists of a transformer, a set of electrodes, and a generator, all these
devices are known as activators (Figure 5.11). To furnish resistance to heat and
ozone obtrusions, the electrode is coated with insulating materials such as ceram￾ics, vulcanized rubbers, polyesters, glass fiber or resin, and epoxy coatings (Chan
et al. 1999; Zenkiewicz ̇ 2001). The electrode is mainly a grounded electrode and
a high-voltage electrode. High-frequency discharge serves as the basis for corona
discharge. Corona discharges release oxygen atoms, oxygen free radicals, and ozone
(Figure 5.12). These oxidants form oxidizing groups with the free radicals of the
surface materials. They create oxidizing groups like ester, carboxyl, carbonyl, and
hydroxyl. These electrodes have different potentials and are filled with gas under
atmospheric pressures, similar to a partial discharge phenomena. The atmosphere
becomes ionized as a result of discharges between the electrodes. As a result of the
formation of ionized air (plasma), a blue mist, and light are emitted (Figures 5.11
and 5.12b). The emission of a source of light in the form of a single point and
a frustum cone having a tiny cone close to the edge might also be attached to124 5 Modification of Surface Properties of Polymeric Materials

the corona radiation in a single point (Koller et al. 2004). High-speed electrons
are discharged at the substrate, which is in an area between the grounded and
high-voltage electrodes. The surface modification results from the breaking of the
chemical bonds of material by hitting the material with the electrons having higher
energy than its binding energy. The low-molecular-weight oxidized materials
(LMWOM) can appear over the top layers of various polymers. If this is not firmly
bonded to the substrate, this can result in issues in blocking and adhesion when the
material is printed (Kusano 2014; Chan 1999; Tuominen et al. 2010). The breakage
of the polymer chains is caused by the very active electrons (more powerful than
ions). This disturbance generates chemical reactions that lead to crosslinking,
degradation, and oxidation. It is because of the insertion of the polar groups,
producing pits, and formation of electrets while removing infirm border layers. The
Fiber and film breakages can be avoided by the little heat capacity (Zenkiewicz
2008; Ding et al. 2014). Studies on the pulsed corona demonstrate that corona
discharge strongly relies on the polarity of the pulse and generates various sizes and
forms of pennants. In the corona, a sizable portion of pennant fills the gap between
the two electrodes. As a result, the streamers’ length rises in an increase in the
voltage, which might cause a glimmer (Stishkov et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2008).
Some of the primary objectives of corona discharges are mentioned in the points
below (Brzezinski et al. 2009; Ozdemir et al. 1999; Pekárek 2009; Ragoubi et al. 2012;
Sparavigna and Wolf 2006; Stepczynska ´ 2014; Zenkiewicz 2008).
1. Oxidation of the top layer of the polymer surface and the emergence of the polar
groups on the surface of the polymer.
2. Polishing the material’s surface and enhancing the surface roughness and modi￾fication of the structure of the material owing to high surface energy.
3. Production of a suitable surface without affecting the mechanical characteristics
of the entire material.
4. Creating a polymer suitable for graft polymerization.
5. In disinfection and sterilization of packaging materials in medical science.
The effectiveness of corona discharges on various polymers has been discussed in
recent years. The polymers are mainly PLA, polypropylene (PE), PET, ethylene vinyl5.5 Corona Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification 125
acetate (EVA), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PE and PP are the two
polyolefins most commonly implemented in the commercial sector. Surface energy
for PP increases rapidly at 1.2< E <4 kJ m−2 and chemical bonds begin to dissolve
at 4< E <5 kJ m−2. Following this, the structures start to change, causing roughness
from ablation and the emergence of LMWOM (Cáceres et al. 2012; Guimond et al.
2002). LMWOM dissolves in inks with polar liquids to enhance the adhesiveness of
the polymer films, while it becomeslower with nonpolarsolvents(Zenkiewicz 2008;
Strobel et al. 2003). The low surface energy of PE needsto be increased energy before
printing (Novak and Florián 2001).
5.5.1 Modification in the Top Layer
The polymer’s top surfaces are chemically modified because of corona treatment.
During this corona treatment chemical and physical engraving occurs. Engraving
leads to ablation and cleans the surface to remove the pollutants. Cleaning up
enhances the adhesiveness of the material’s surface. Moreover, ablation increases
surface roughness and eliminates the elements that are weak in nature. (Kusano
2014; Marat-Mendes et al. 1992). After the corona discharge impulse the electrons
are responsible forthe conversion of particles of oxygen and waterinto O− and OH−.
These negative ions interrelate with the positive ions to form a neutral substance
(Strobel et al. 2003; Strobel and Lyons 2003).
The relative humidity in the air, the gas amount, and the corona discharge polarity
all affect in formation of ozone (Kusano 2014). Ozone affects the surface by cre￾ating cuts or fractures, which are released during the discharges (Gooch 2011a).
Chemical bonds of the polymer chain (C–H and C–C) break because of electron col￾lision (Figure 5.13) and generate free radicals. These free radicals participate in the
crosslinking, unsaturation, recombination, and branching. This crosslinking results
in the enchantment of the bond strength of the polymer chain (Kusano 2014).
Figure 5.13 Breakage of chemical bonds in the chain of polymer because of corona
treatment causes a change in the material’s top layer. Source: Adapted from Izdebska (2016)
and Kusano (2014).126 5 Modification of Surface Properties of Polymeric Materials
5.5.2 Factors Affecting the Course and Effectiveness of Corona
Treatment
5.5.2.1 Parameters Controlling Optimum Treatment
The quantity of energy carried by ions significantly impacts the corona’s effec￾tiveness. These ions are the function of the speed of material shifts, the function
of power, and the length of discharge electrodes (Moraczewski et al. 2014). Nev￾ertheless, having fewer free electrons, positive corona discharges are favored over
negative discharge forsurface treatments because they produce less ozone regarding
polarity (van Veldhuizen and Rutgers 2001). The thickness of the polymeric films
has a notable effect in the treatment of polymers containing lubricant, thickset
materials demanding high energy and endeavor to go through significant surface
transformations. Less susceptible to surface treatment are materials with increased
surface energy as a result of more stretch. Another essential aspect affecting the
efficiency of the treatments is humidity. The polymer’s roughness varies even at
low applied voltages with increased humidity (80%), highlighting the significance
of moistness regulation in the surface corona treatment (Chan 1999).
5.5.2.2 Remedies and Causes of Treatment by Reverse Lateral
The polymers are in porous essence, and the air may become trapped between the
corona roller and the polymer films. That subsequently experiences ionization at
both high and low levels of power. The corona rollers are glazed in silicone latex,
have a small range of elasticity, and are prone to dents and grooves. It is because
of the venture effect, which is rapidly operating film carriage air multitudes with a
lower and upper side at low power. On account of localized heating brought on by
high temperatures, non-oriented polypropylene (PP)is observed to exhibit persistent
teardrop fluctuations at higher power. The treatmentroller can be cooled by dispers￾ing the power acrossthe sizable surface areas, and the overwarming of the substrates
may be constructively controlled.
5.5.2.3 Effects of Additives in Corona Treatment
In corona treatment, various stabilizers are incorporated into polymers for
inhibiting the oxidation, preserving the tincture, and maintaining the melting
indexes like biphenylene-diphosphonite (P-EPQ), irganox-1010, and tris-nonyl
phenyl-phosphite (TNPP). Where irganox-1010 and butylate hydroxy toluene
(BHT) are free radical scavengers’ primary antioxidants while P-EPQ and TNPP are
used to decompose hydrogen peroxide (Sun et al. 1999). Irganox-1010 films have no
carbonyl groups, while P-EPQ films have relatively few carboxyl groups.
5.5.2.4 Treatment Time
The production of carbonyls occurs throughout the corona treatment initially in
an excessively rapid reaction, and then, in a subsequent long reaction, these car￾bonyls are converted to the ether groups. The issue of warmth fastening on the mate￾rial will result from immoderate treatment, which will result in nonpolar ethers
with low surface tension. Additionally, it has been observed that excessive treatment5.6 UV Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification 127
degrades polyolefin’s wettability and adhesion because of bumps. However, very lit￾tle treatment is not enough to get suitable surface energy (Kim et al. 1971).
5.5.2.5 Aging
The rate of degradation of the treated film’s surface energy with storage relies on
the mobility of the polar groups, the ambient temperature, and humidity. This
degradation is most likely caused by their reversion and diffusion. In contrast to
PP, which aged the fastest, polyimide (PI) and PE were shown to be more resistant
to aging, while polystyrene and PET exhibited modest stability (Klemberg-Sapieha
et al. 1993).
5.6 UV Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification
Light-sensitive polymers are cured using UV treatment. It is because it enhances
the surface adhesiveness (Kraus et al. 2016; Heitz et al. 1996) and functionalization
of the surface by photosensitizer/photoinitiator (Shin et al. 2016). A photochemical
reaction isinstigated by UV light onto the surface of the photo-polymers. This photo￾chemical reaction creates a crosslinked chain of polymers (Figure 5.3) (Carroll et al.
2011). The main objective of UV treatment is to solidify the substance during the
course of fabrication. It is not to change its surface properties. The UV treatment on
a polymer surface is only useful for the already-hardened surface of the polymer to
vary the properties of adhesiveness and wettability.
In UV treatment, polymerization is responsible for curing the surface instead of
evaporation since this is a solvent-free, low-temperature, and high-speed process
(Figure 5.14). It is a phase in the fabrication process for polymer networks (Decker
2002), imprint lithography (Fader et al. 2012), and polymer composites (Decker
2002). In UV treatment, the photoinitiator plays a crucial role in the rise in con￾centration. The intensity of irradiation increases the degree of the conversion of
Figure 5.14 UV light treatment for the modification of the surface of the polymer with the
photoinitiator. Source: Adapted from Nemani et al. (2018a), Fader et al. (2012), and
Decker (2002).128 5 Modification of Surface Properties of Polymeric Materials
polymerization. It is because of the existence of free radicals on the upper layer of
the polymer. The polymer surface having thick layers shows a low polymerization
conversion rate because of the lower penetration of the UV light into the layer. The
depth of the polymer surface and intensity of UV light have a crucial role in the
last luster of UV treatment. The material is cured at high intensities of UV light
and leads to a higher value, but this can be lowered by enhancing the thickness
of the surface. The conversion rate of polymerization is decreased by increasing
the oxygen in the air. This is because the creation of peroxy radicals results from
the scavenging of free radicals by the oxygen molecules. These peroxy radicals
are not reactive enough to activate the double bonds of acrylate to participate in
polymerization (Studer et al. 2003).
Once the sample is unveiled in front of UV light, it releases free radicals by oxi￾dizing the polymer. These interact with the ozone or oxygen in the air resulting in
hydrophilic carboxyl and carbonyl species. The degree of modification of the sur￾face may be managed by maintaining the solvent, the photoinitiator, the irradiation
period, and the concentration of the monomer (Liu et al. 2016). Polymers’ low sur￾face energy leads to poor adhesive quality, which restricts their usage. Enhancing
the adhesive property (hydrophilicity) of polymers using a UV-ozone (UVO) or UV
oxidation process has been proven to be successful (Liu et al. 2016; Mathieson and
Bradley 1996). UV treatments are utilized to promote cell adhesion and prolifer￾ation in the biological aspect (Formosa et al. 2008). To increase the adhesiveness
between the metal films and the polymersubstrates at the nanoscale, Liu et al.(2016)
employed the UV-ozone treatments. They were able to create metal–polymer com￾posite films, which could bear prolonged liquid penetration forthe extended periods
of time (Figure 5.15). Grafting is the technique of covalently bonded monomers on
the polymer’s surface. Wang (2006) used UV grafting to enhance adherence to PE.
Hu et al. (2002) described a single-step process for modification of PDMS surface
using UV grafting.
For biomaterial usage, Yang and Rubner (2002) employed thermal/UV curing
to stabilize polyacrylamide (PAAm) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) multilayers at
high pH. At high pH levels to make the PAA/PAAm multilayers more stable,
heat energy is employed for creating thermal crosslinking inside them via a

thermal imidization reaction. UV light is employed for generating photo-crosslinks
inside the PAA/PAAm multilayers. It is accomplished by the existence of a
photoinitiator-labeled poly(acrylic acid) copolymer (PI-PAA) (Figure 5.15). Its
controlled and targeted stability enables water-based subtractive patterning method
such as photolithography and inkjet printing for producing multilayer patterned
thin films. These films may be utilized for regulating the adherence of cells of
mammalian and building light-emitting patterned devices.
5.7 Surface Patterning Treatment for Polymer Surface
Modification
Patterned surfaces of the polymers are used widely in the domains of optics,
electronics and biomedicine. An organic display was developed that showed lumi￾nescent character on applying electric current. They used structured, light-emitting
conducting polymers for displaying this vivid full-color visuals (Shimoda et al.
2003). Compared to the original polymer surface, laser-induced periodic surface
structures (LIPSS) exhibit better gluing capabilities. Some researchers created
inexpensive polymer substrates for optical sensors using the LIPSS approach to
lessen the amount of metal required (Rebollar et al. 2012). On the other hand
scientists have also demonstrated that stable ink solutions may be used to print
higher resolution, structured, and multicolored thin films of luminous colloidal
quantum dot (QD) polymer composites, adding to the development of a reliable and
effective device architecture (Wood et al. 2009). Their attributes can be adjusted via
tuning the thickness of the composite layer of the QD polymer. The polymer surface
has showed improvised photoluminescence efficiency, but its electrical capabilities
were intact (Aldred et al. 2005).
Block copolymers can be utilized to construct patterned polymerstructures as well
as magnetic and metallic pillars or arrays for data storage devices (Park et al. 2001).
Printed polymeric surfaces with patterns are used in organic light-emitting diodes
(OLEDs) and organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). Likewise, structured nanocrys￾tals are used in memory devices because of their promising durability and longevity
features. Patterned polymers have also been used in optics, creating masks, and
templates (Julthongpiput et al. 2007; Valkama et al. 2004).
5.7.1 Instability-Induced Polymer Patterning
This patterning technique utilizes the in-built qualities of the polymers that
are classified into two kinds: the metastable films and the unstable films. The
unstable films have instability mainly because of their inherent chemistry. The
metastable films have instability mainly because of external forces like thermal,
electrical, and some forms of automated forces (Müller-Buschbaum et al. 2005;
Rodríguez-Hernández 2015). Spinodal dewetting is one type of instability that
is triggered by electrostatic forces or van der Waals forces. Homogeneous and
heterogeneous nucleated dewetting are the two types of the instabilities caused130 5 Modification of Surface Properties of Polymeric Materials
by substrate deformations. When external forces act on thin liquid polymer films,
they can cause changes in charge density, surface tension, or buoyancy that lead
to instability in the metastable films (Bodenschatz et al. 2000). These cause the
surface to get deformed and cause localized liquid flow. The thin film gets ruptured
and causes patterning. The different types of molecular interactions or forces along
with surface properties rule the morphology and amount of patterning (Mukherjee
et al. 2011).
5.7.2 Patterning by Dewetting
The free energy of the system controls the propagation of unstable (or metastable)
films to a steady state, which typically results in dewetting which means breaking
of the film generating random patterns (Xie et al. 1998; Higgins and Jones 2000;
Peter 2003). Whenever this unwanted phenomenon manifests itself on uniform
surfaces, bi-continuous structures, droplets, random holes and polygons have been
seen, among other things (Reiter 1992). Thin-film polymers subjected to dewetting
processes have demonstrated morphological growth, self-organization with subse￾quent pattern generation (Xing et al. 2007; Bäumchen and Jacobs 2010; Xu et al.
2017) (Figure 5.16). The polymersthat have the property of interconverting between
liquid and solid states can undergo dewetting process. They interchange between
the states by merely adjusting the temperature above or below the glass transition
point. This process, which begins with the production of holes, eventually enlarge,
merge, and produce isotropic droplets, is controlled by the initial conditions of the
film-like film thickness (Hyun et al. 2016).

Society of Chemistry/CC BY 3.0.5.7 Surface Patterning Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification 131
The uneven distribution of structures, short-range order, and poor resolution of
generated structures are some of the drawbacks of the polymer-patterning approach
(Hyun et al. 2016). Another drawback is that the spontaneous dewetting method is
plausible in extremely thin, thermodynamically unstable polymer films (Mukherjee
et al. 2011). Over these years, patterned structures have found applicationsin optics,
electronic devices and storage devices etc.
5.7.3 Patterning by Evaporation
It is possible to create distinctive patterns by letting non-volatile substances
assemble after solvents from thin polymer films have evaporated (Bodenschatz
et al. 2000; Khanal and Zubarev 2007). Large-scale evaporation has been used to
create hierarchically built amphiphilic diblock copolymer micelles (Li et al. 2014).
Like the dewetting process, nonuniform dispersion in the evaporation procedure
may result in uneven formations (Watanabe and Yanagisawa 2022) (Figure 5.17).
Rigid geometry has been applied to pattern the polymer surface in order to get
around this problem (Tao et al. 2008). Biodegradable polymers have been utilized to
create honeycomb-like porous polymer films by means of an evaporation-induced
self-assembly technique in a humid environment (Kawano et al. 2012). The micro￾topography of these honeycomb polymer films for particular diameter encourages
adhesion and managed cellular shape.

5.7.4 Patterning by Electric Field Gradient
Whenever an external electric potential is employed to the polymer film sandwiched
amid two electrodes, the film will be disrupted, leading to the creation of patterned
structures (Hyun et al. 2016; Cargill et al. 2011) (Figure 5.18). Patterned electrodes
with regulated electric fields are used for highly ordered arrays (Deshpande et al.
2004). Further, if higher electric field with high temperature is used across the poly￾mer film, then it can produced micro- or nanosized patterned features (Schaeffer
et al. 2000). Also, electrostatic forces acting between polymer and air interfaces
can cause capillary and thermal variations. This can create sideways pressure and
form protrusions. The ultimate outcome depends on the electric field, film width,
air–polymer interface, and the film surface (Mukherjee et al. 2011; Schaeffer et al.
2000). The viscosity has a considerable impact on how long it takes to generate a
patterned structure (Wu and Russel 2009). Some research show that the difference
in viscosity in polymeric bilayers can cause instability in the electric field which
results in uneven patterning (Xu et al. 2016).
This process of patterning technique using electric field is a very popular and
is industrial friendly (Liu et al. 2013). Using this method, polymeric organo-rods
that resemble gecko nanohairs in terms of hydrophobicity and improved adherence
have been produced (Northen and Turner 2005). Due to the electric halt, the pattern
resolution produced from variation of electric-field instability is constrained (Liu
et al. 2013; Dickey et al. 2008).
5.7.5 Patterning by Thermal Gradient
For electric field patterning, electric filed is used. Similarly, for thermal gradient
patterning, heat gradient is used to destabilize the surface of the polymers (Schäffer
et al. 2003). In this procedure, polymer film is placed amid the substrate and the top
plate having different temperatures with little air spacing dividing them. This gradi￾ent between them resultsin a surface deformation with a distinctive wavelength that
givesrise to various morphologies. The exact morphology is determined by the initial
film conditions, including the film thickness, the air spacing, the temperatures of
the two plates, and the degree of the thermal gradient (Mukherjee et al. 2011).

5.7.6 Photolithography
Photolithography is currently an economically advantageous fabrication technique
that can be utilized to generate surface relief features on micro- and nanoscale level
in polymer industries without actually losing their inbuilt characteristics. As the
name suggests, this technique uses light to transfer geometric pattern on polymer
films which has chemical, electrical, and other response to light (Handrea-Dragan
and Botiz 2021) (Figure 5.19). This process then dissolves a chosen portion of
the film in the right solvent and removes it from the film. The radiation causes
photo-crosslinking, functionalization, photopolymerization, and decomposition
(Nie and Kumacheva 2008). Nevertheless, large areas with high resolution cannot
be patterned by this technique (Acikgoz et al. 2011). For the fabrication of textured
surfaces via photolithography, a polymeric film or a template is required, and the
setup is costly.
Light-emitting displays (LEDs) (Müller et al. 2003), sensors and actuators
(Hoffmann et al. 1999), polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) (Penter￾man et al. 2002; Kato et al. 1994), three-dimensional photonic crystals (Campbell
et al. 2000; Moon et al. 2006), and optical components (Wu et al. 2002), and are
all made using photolithographically patterned polymers. It is evident that one of

the key prerequisites for innovative creation of applications in different areas of
nanotechnology is the production of comparatively tiny structured features and
customized properties with good picture clarity. Patterned surfaces made using
this method find applications in biomedical devices (Tian et al. 2014), cell growth
(Castillejo et al. 2012), or organic optoelectronics (Su et al. 2019; Yun et al. 2019) to
name a few examples.
5.7.7 Patterning by Block Copolymers
Block copolymers (BCPs) are made through carefully controlling polymerization
of one monomer, then extending the strand with a discrete monomer to gener￾ate copolymers (Matyjaszewski 2002). Correspondingly, blocks of two or more
polymeric chains that remains chemically distinct and covalently bonded to one
another are created side by side (Segalman 2005). Instead of being distributed
randomly or alternately across the polymer chain, distinct monomers are clustered
in different homogeneous regions of the polymer strand (Kim and Hinsberg 2008).
The simplest method to direct pattern alignment in a BCP thin film it to equalize
domain surface energy which is achieved by spin-coating a random copolymer
with identical monomer units between substrate and BCP (Figure 5.20). Phase
separation occurs, producing micro- and nanoscale patterned patterns, as a result
of the different affinities of these block copolymers toward the interface (Xue et al.
2012). The film thickness and composition, its temperature and level of block
incompatibility (such as the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter) all affect the
patterned features (Kim and Hinsberg 2008; Nie and Kumacheva 2008). After the
patterns are created, mostly annealing is conducted. The size of these copolymers is
customizable and can be organized into ordered displays of lines and dots. BCPs are
utilized as blueprints for the creation of high-density information storage medium,
ceramic nanodots and wires, and nanoscale metal (Lodge 2003). The BCP method’s
use is constrained by its high cost and low likelihood of producing a sizable region
of defect-free patterns (Xue et al. 2012).
5.7.8 Microcontact Printing
It is a very successful method for patterning large polymer surfaces and small
pattern range (Qiu et al. 2021) (Figure 5.21). Microcontact printing is a simple

and economical process where the polymer is transferred to the substrate using
an elastic or rigid polymeric stamp with relief features. Due to its transparency,
elasticity, and capacity to create conformal contact with difficult surfaces, PDMS
is the most used microcontact stamp (Kaufmann and Ravoo 2010). The benefits of
this technique are shorter processing periods, minimal ink consumption, and the
potential to produce high-resolution patterns on large surface areas. The fabrication
of organic electronics, LEDs, circuits, electronic sheets, and computer chips mostly
uses the microcontact printing technology (Li and Guo 2006; Menard et al. 2007).
5.7.9 Nanoimprinting Lithography
Nanoimprinting lithography is another patterning technique that creates patterned
structures using mechanical deformation of the resist materials. This technique is
processed underregulated temperature and pressure. Later, curing method is carried
out either by heating thermally or by exposing to UV radiations(Hongbo 2013). One
of its major advantage is that it involves a simple equipment with short process￾ing period which makes it a cost-effective approach and provides high-resolution
patterns (Chou et al. 1997; Hua et al. 2004). Nevertheless, high viscous polymers
pose a challenge for this technique because high temperature can make the polymer
shrink during curing process. Recentreportsshow that thistechnique was used onto
curved lens which made it waterproof and antireflective without altering its inher￾ent chemical composition (Dickson et al. 2017; Handrea-Dragan and Botiz 2021)
(Figure 5.22).
5.7.10 Laser Surface Texturing (LST)
A quick and ecologically responsible way to alter the surface of polymers, laser
surface texturing (LST) offers good control over the size and shape of the details136 5 Modification of Surface Properties of Polymeric Materials

which enables the production of ideal patterns (Garrison and Srinivasan 1985;
Riveiro et al. 2018) (Figures 5.23 and 5.24). In order to perform LST, a targeted laser
beam must be directed at the polymer’s surface, where radiation hits the upper
layer and produces heat. The surface is altered as an outcome of the heat. Moreover,
this heat causes melting and vaporization of the surface. Additionally, if the laser
beam is very intense, the chemical bonds on the surface will be disrupted. Even
such high-intensity beam also causes modification of the polymer surface. Compar￾atively, UV radiation is chosen for LST operations over IR radiation. It is because
the IR light can cause ionization and breakdown polymers without melting. LST
may polarize polymers and change their surface properties, considerably improving
the polymer’s hydrophilic or hydrophobic character (Garrison and Srinivasan
1985).
One of the best methodsfortexturing polymers with excellent quality, throughput,
and flexibility at the nanoscale scale is direct laser interference patterning (DLIP)
(Alamri and Lasagni 2017). As soon as two or more coherent laser beams collide on
the polymer surface, DLIP results. This phenomenon can be controlled by adjusting
the pitch, sample geometry, and period. The use of DLIP could improve the for￾mation of nanorods, pattern graphene oxide, create organic solar cells, and many
other things (Alamri and Lasagni 2017; Müller-Meskamp et al. 2012). For consistent
findings when employing the DLIP approach, it is crucial to carry out studies under
standardized, controlled settings (Alamri and Lasagni 2017).5.8 Thermal Annealing Treatment for Polymer Surface Modification 137

Laser surface modification is a low-cost method that can be employed in mass
production (Zhai et al. 2011). LST has the ability to alter the qualities of a mate￾rial in order to advance its adhesion properties (Kromer et al. 2018), increase its
load-carrying capacity (Brizmer and Kligerman 2012), modify itsfriction coefficients
(Schille et al. 2015), and lower its wear rate (Jones and Schmid 2016).
5.8 Thermal Annealing Treatment for Polymer Surface
Modification
Thermal annealing is a typical procedure for strengthening a solid, such as glass or
a metal by increasing, maintaining, and then gradually lowering its temperature.
Though it is common, it is an equally important method for improving the surface
properties in interwoven polymeric fibers and thin-film polymers. Surface modifi￾cation through annealing finds its uses in the electrical, clothing, and packaging
industries. Additionally, its utility as a post-processing step to stop polymer matrix138 5 Modification of Surface Properties of Polymeric Materials

surface rebuilding and degradation (Yagüe and Gleason 2013) is worth mentioning.
The material needs to be subjected to annealing to increase the mechanical strength
of polymers. Electrospinning in polymers increases its mechanical strength (Li et al.
2013; Gu et al. 2017) (Figure 5.25).
In annealing, the substrate is put in the oven and undergoessome baking processes
where the constant heating causes the polymer fibers to go through morphological
changes in their structure. Due to the fusing and overlaying of the delicate fibers,
this causes a vital change in the structural qualities,such asthe integrity of the mem￾brane (You et al. 2006; Burger et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2008). Additionally, annealing
can change the molecular structure and result in high crystallinity (Migliaresi et al.
1991), which raises the elasticity of Young’s modulus (Cho et al. 2011; Tan and Lim
2006). Annealing also prevents partial dewetting of the polymer films and induces
crosslinking of fluorinated polymer species. In conductive polymers annealing
enhances the stability of the host species (Nemani et al. 2018b) by increasing the
conductivity during the stabilization of the wettability of chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) polymer films (Zhao et al. 2017; Sojoudi et al. 2017). The bulk characteristics
of the polymer are significantly altered by annealing, which is a significant negative
for applicationslike bioimplant devices and tailored drug-delivery systems. Thermal
annealing has been used to modify conductivity in photonic, optoelectronic, and
electronic devices with success, although its usefulness is limited to circumstances
in which property changes at the bulk are not as important.

In the beginning, the primary application of polymer composites was as stable
building elements. Modern times, however, are witnessing a rise in interest in5.9 Conclusion 139
sophisticated polymer materials with much improved surface properties. Lately,
various surface modification approaches have been coming to light with the
advancement in conventional techniques. This clears the way for strong and
durable polymer surfaces. UV and laser methods focus on activation of the polymer
surface and surface polymerization to attain modified surfaces. However CVD
techniques adopt a more complex approach by generating thin coatings of polymer
to address surface modification. Primarily, owing to its affordability factor, corona
discharge methods remain most popular surface treatment techniques in the
packaging sector.
Even though complex surface modification techniques like lithiographic
patterning treatments are technically conceivable, their commercial viability is
typically determined by economic concerns. The financial and technological should
be kept in mind while selecting a suitable surface treatment technique for the
desired purpose. The basic research and knowledge regarding a particular method
is advantageous, but its economic advantages typically depend on industry.
Herein we have discussed popular surface modification treatments like physical,
chemical, and optical methods. We have tried to emphasize on the strategies that
modify the surface characteristics and morphologies of polymer surfaces. Nano￾and micropatterning has also been studied as a considerable surface modification
technique. For every method, a general explanation of the surface techniques,
their strategies, and the influence of these processes on polymer surface have been
covered. In most cases, we analyze these methods from application standpoint,
whereas their mechanisms also require a lot of attention. A comparative study of
these methods is also covered in this chapter. Alternative methods can also modify
the surface with comparable properties, but the pace with which the modification
occurs, varies. Moreover the disadvantages of each method are discussed, and ways
to mitigate them are being addressed. This chapter summarizes overall techniques
related to surface modification with a spotlight of the main purpose.

6.1 Introduction
Numerous chemical processes depend on catalysis, and the choice between
homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts can have a substantial effect on how
a reaction turns out. Catalysts are materials that speed up chemical reactions
without being consumed. A reaction is said to be homogeneous if both the catalyst
and the reactants are in the same phase. On the other hand, the reaction is said
to be heterogeneous if the catalyst and the reactants are in two separate phases.
The choice of catalyst relies on the particular requirements of the process. Both
homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis have benefits and drawbacks. Selecting
the optimum catalytic system for a particular reaction requires consideration of
a number of elements, including required reaction rate, product yield, and the
viability of catalyst recovery and reuse. In this chapter, we emphasize the use of
porous organic polymers (POPs) containing active sites, and how they are applied
as catalysts for various transformation reactions such as photocatalysis, coupling
reactions, oxidation reactions, and reduction reactions.
6.1.1 Organic Polymer Photocatalysis (OPP)
To address different issues such as environmental pollution, greenhouse effect,
energy storage devices, the researchers of the planet have been engaged in
making an alternative solution for clean and sustainable energy and technology.
Among them, solar energy to chemical energy converted to visible-light-driven
photocatalytic technique is a unique one.

In order to accelerate a chemical reaction, the techniques of photochemistry and
catalysis are combined in a process known as photocatalysis(Saravanam et al. 2017).
Fujishima and Honda (1972) made the first observation in 1972 about the photocat￾alytic phenomenon by splitting of water on TiO2 electrode under ultraviolet (UV)
light. The photocatalysis process is subdivided into two types: one is homogeneous
and the other is heterogeneous photocatalysis process (Fujishima and Honda 1972;
Rajeshwar et al. 2008). Most frequently, metal complexes (transition metals like
iron, copper, and chromium) are used as catalysts in homogeneous photocatalytic
processes. In this process, under the photon and thermal condition, the higher
oxidation state of metal ion complexes is generated hydroxyl radicals. Then, these
hydroxyl radicals react with organic matter which leads to destruction of toxic
matters (Tahir et al. 2020) In order to carry out a desired reaction, heterogeneous
photocatalysis uses a light-activated catalyst at room temperature. Methane, ethane,
ethylene, propylene, and carbon monoxide are examples of simple hydrocarbons
that can be completely oxidatively destroyed by hydroxyl radicals produced when
the n-type semiconductor oxide titanium dioxide (TiO2) is illuminated in the
presence of molecular oxygen (Ollis 1996). Because of its better stability, ease
of separation, low cost, and capacity to reuse photocatalysts the heterogeneous
photocatalysis typically exceeds than homogeneous photocatalysis (Tahir et al.
2020). The key advantages of photocatalysis are:
(i) Because it can use clean, renewable solar energy, it is a better alternative for
current technologies that consume a lot of energy.
(ii) It can be employed in various wastewater management processes to destroy a
number of dangerous chemicals.
(iii) A less amount of chemical input is needed, the reaction conditions for
photocatalysis are mild, and the reaction period is brief.
6.1.2 The Mechanism of Photocatalysis
As shown in Figure 6.1, an intrinsically semi-conductive POP will be activated
to produce photoexcited charge carriers, such as photogenerated electrons in
the conduction band (CB) and holes in the valence band, when visible light
with energy equal to or greater than the bandgap falls on the POPs (VB). Then
a surface redox reaction occurs between POPs and substrates by efficient charge
separation/migration and appropriate band potential alignment. The majority of
photoinduced electrons and holes may merge, which lower the photocatalysis’s
effectiveness. A number of techniques have been investigated for POPs to increase
the separation of charges and prevent recombination, including the use of noble
metals, asymmetrical structures, high crystallinity polymers, high coplanarity
polymers, and structural designs with electron donor–acceptor systems (Byun and
Zhang 2020). Both excellent photostability and high activity are maintained by
metal-free POPs in prolonged reactions. The lack of metal reduces the material’s
cost and removes the possibility of metal contamination, but the research effort is6.1 Introduction 155

hampered by the need to design and optimize structures and reaction conditions
(Wang et al. 2020).
The holes and electrons that are generated after striking the light on the semi￾conductive POPs could undergo successive oxidation and reduction reactions with
any species, which might be adsorbed on the surface of the semiconductor to give
the necessary products. The oxidation and reduction mechanism of photocatalysis
is given below:
(i) Oxidation mechanism: Water molecules which are present on the photocata￾lyst’s surface are oxidized by positive holes formed in the valence band as a
result of the electron’s shift to the conduction band, which produces hydroxyl
(OH) radicals (agents which have strong oxidative decomposition power). The
hydroxyl radicals react with organic matter present in the dyes. If oxygen is
present when this process happens, the intermediate radicals in the organic
compounds along with the oxygen molecules can experience radical chain reac￾tions and consume oxygen in some cases. In such a case, the organic matter
finally decomposes ultimately becoming carbon dioxide and water (Rajeshwar
et al. 2008). In these conditions, organic molecules can interact directly with the
positive holes leading to oxidative decomposition.
(ii) Reduction mechanism: Since oxygen is a material that can be reduced simply,
it is reduced instead of being converted into hydrogen. Superoxide anions are
produced when the conduction band electrons react with dissolved oxygen
species, which causes material breakdown. These superoxide anions bind
to the oxidative reactions of intermediate products, producing peroxide or
transforming to hydrogen peroxide before becoming water. With organic156 6 Organic Polymers as Potential Catalysts
stuff as opposed to water, the decrease is likely to happen more quickly. As a
result, there are more positive holes when there is a higher concentration of
organic stuff. As a result, the photocatalytic activity is increased and carrier
recombination gets decreased.
6.2 Recent Development of Porous Organic Polymer
(POP)
POPs, a new class of porous materials, have recently gained attention as a promising
platform for heterogeneous photocatalysis. It has many applications which include
gas and water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, water purification, visible-light
photocatalyst, high porosity H2, and CO2 device.
Due to the rapid consumption of fossil fuels in industries, the carbon dioxide
concentration is increased from 280 to 415 ppm (1750–2020) in our atmosphere
which led to rise in the average temperature of the planet (Shen et al. 2021). It needs
to be reduced by using a CO2 photoreduction reaction (CO2PRR). The CO2PRR is
an energy-efficient mechanism that converts CO2 value-added chemicals and fuels
using solar energy which is achieved by developing a highly active and selective
photocatalysis by using various material catalysts like TiO2, MoS2, and MXene
(Cheng et al. 2021).
The diverse uses of functional materials with a clearly defined pore structure
were further enhanced by the development of metal organic frameworks. The POPs
are highly stable both thermally and hydrothermally because they have strong
C—C covalent bonds. S. Bandyopadhyay et al. (2016) designed and fabricated
a novel series of 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacenes (BODIPY)-based
POPs exhibiting high carbon dioxide and hydrogen uptake. A 10-fold increase in
surface area from 73 m2 g−1 in BDT1a to 1010 m2 g−1 in BDT3 was achieved by
judicious tuning of reaction conditions and monomer structures. They found the
gas adsorption behavior of the polymers revealed a high uptake capacity of CO2 (up
to 16.5 wt%) at 273 K and 1 bar.
Generating POPs for photocatalytic water splitting is a tough but new potential
effort in the area of research. When semiconductors are used as photocatalysts, the
minimal band gap necessary for thermodynamic watersplitting is 1.23 eV, assuming
that all of the energy used to split the water came from electrical activity. Splitting of
waterinto hydrogen and oxygen also requires a change in standard Gibb’sfree energy
(ΔG∘
). The fundamental principle behind photocatalytic water splitting is that the
electrons in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), or valence band (VB)
are peacefully moved to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)when an
energetic photon (h𝜈) stimulates the semiconductor and overcomes the band gap’s
barrier (CB). During this process, the electron (e−) would emerge in the LUMO,
while the hole (h+) would remain in the HOMO. The majority of the electron–hole
pairs merge quickly in the “photo-excited” state. A portion of the electron–hole pairs
move to the surface and are absorbed by water, which causes the water splitting
effectively (Xu et al. 2018).6.3 Metal–Organic Framework (MOF)-Based Heterogeneous Catalysis 157

6.3 Metal–Organic Framework (MOF)-Based
Heterogeneous Catalysis
6.3.1 MOFs Chemistry
MOFs are a family of compounds formed by the coordination of metal ions or metal
clusters to organic ligands (Figure 6.2). This class of compounds shows promising
propertiessuch as adjustable pore structure, high porosity, crystallinity, high surface
area, variety of chemical compositions, and versatile functionality (Zhou et al. 2012;
Furukawa et al. 2013; Kitagawa et al. 2004). These properties have sparked intense
research attention in a number of disciplines, particularly catalysis.
MOFs as catalysts possess unique benefits over conventional porous materials
(such as mesoporous silicon, clays, or zeolites), most notably the following (Li et al.
2019a):
(1) Clearly defined structures of MOFs help to understand the chemical reactions
at the molecular level.
(2) It is possible to develop MOF-based catalysts by introducing multiple catalytic
sites into a single MOF due to the structural diversity and tunability of all MOF
components (nodes, linkers, and pores).
(3) The numerous catalytic sites and cooperative microenvironments provide
evidence for synergistic catalysis.158 6 Organic Polymers as Potential Catalysts
(4) The tunable pore environments(hydrophilic and hydrophobic)support the iden￾tification and transportation of substrates and products.
According to recent studies, MOFs show extremely useful properties as
heterogeneous catalysts for many chemical reactions. The strengths of MOFs as
heterogeneous catalyst lie in their homogeneous and customizable pore shape
and size, which are very important for size-selective catalysis. Most MOFs are
microporous, having pores sizes in the range of 0–9.8 nm, appropriate for the
majority of the reaction substrates that are used in industry. Again, because of the
large surface area and porosity, substrates can be adsorbed on the surface of MOFs,
which improves the interaction between the reactants and the catalytic sites and
increases the catalytic efficiency. In order to understand the underlying catalytic
mechanism, it is very important to understand the link between the well-defined
tunable structure of MOFs and catalytic performance (Li et al. 2019b).
6.3.2 Active Sites of MOFs for Heterogeneous Catalysis
The MOFs containing metal nodes or clusters show excellent catalytic behavior
compared to conventional catalysts. MOF-based single-metal sites catalysts have
many benefits because of the complete isolation and dispersion of the metal sites.
Metal site in different topological MOFs with tunable spatial positions and orienta￾tions enables synergistic catalysis and cascade reactions. Organic linkers and other
potential terminal ligands like water and solvent molecules are coordinated with
the metal ions in the metal nodes of MOFs. These molecules can be eliminated by
thermal or vacuum processing without disturbing the host framework structures.
As a result, the metal ions in the metal nodes/clusters that are exposed have vacant
orbitals that can interact with substrates or other molecules through lone-pair
electrons. Thus, these exposed metal sites can function as Lewis acid sites which
can absorb and energize the reactant molecules to facilitate charge transfer as
they transform into products (Jiao et al. 2018). Férey et al. (2005) reported a MOF
named MIL-101(Cr) with chemical formula (Cr3X(H2O)2O(1,4-bdc)3; X = F, OH;
bdc = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate). Due to its Lewis acid activity, it is a suitable MOF
for use in heterogeneous catalysis. The water ligand gets easily eliminated under
vacuum at a higher temperature. The exposed Cr(III) metal ions are available for
potential reactants providing a significantly higher catalytic activity. Over the last
10 years, zirconium-based metal–organic frameworks have become a cutting-edge
catalyst for detoxifying nerve agents. Farha, Hupp, and coworkers reported
zirconium-based metal–organic framework MOF (NU-1000) for the catalytic
hydrolysis of organophosphorus nerve agents and their stimulants (Mondloch et al.
2015). These MOFs have strong Zr(IV)—O bonds, which contribute to their excep￾tional chemical and thermal stability. The Lewis acidic behavior of Zr(IV) active
sites facilitates the faster hydrolysis of organophosphorus substrates. The phospho￾ryl oxygen of the organophosphorus substrate coordinated to the Zr(IV) active site
in the first step of the mechanism, as shown in Figure 6.2 (Kirlikovali et al. 2020).
In the second step, the hydroxyl group attached to the Zr-MOF acts as a nucle￾ophile and attacks the phosphorous atom of the organophosphorus substrate. This6.3 Metal–Organic Framework (MOF)-Based Heterogeneous Catalysis 159
nucleophilic attack can also occur from the attack of the water molecule coming
from solvents. Step three involves the elimination of a leaving group from the
organophosphorus substrate. Then in the final step, the hydrolyzed product gets
removed from the catalystsurface by one hydroxo and one aqua ligand, and catalytic
cycles get completed. It can be easily understood from the catalytic cycle that the
rate of hydrolysissignificantly depends on the accessibility of the organophosphorus
substrate to the Zr(IV) active (Kirlikovali et al. 2020). The advantages of Lewis acid
sites of MOFs are also explored in gas-phase reactions. Xu and coworkers developed
a MOF Cu(mipt) (mipt = 5-methylisophthalate), which is microporous with open
Cu(II) sites on channel walls. This MOF exhibits excellent and consistent catalysis
for the oxidation of CO (Zou et al. 2007).
6.3.3 Active Sites at Organic Linkers
The presence of organic linkers (such as chiral molecules, salens, and metallo￾porphyrin) in MOFs makes the MOFs much more efficient for various catalysis
processes (Cho et al. 2006). The modification of the functional groups present in
organic linkers makes it possible to create various active sites within the MOFs.
Examples ofsuch types of functional groups are sulfonic acid, amide,sulfoxy, amino,
pyridyl, bipyridyl, etc. (Zou et al. 2007). On the other hand, these functional groups
can also be incorporated into the organic linkers by functionalized modification
approach. The acidic or basic nature of functional groups has influenced the
catalytic activity of the MOFs (Zhu et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2013).
Many research groups have tried to functionalize MOFs with strong Bronsted
acids like sulfonic acids (Jiang and Yaghi 2015). For the first time, Zhou et al. (2014)
developed ∼100% sulfonic acid functionalized MIL-101(Cr) by a hydrothermal pro￾cessfollowed by a facile post-synthetic HCL treatment. The resulting MIL-101-SO3H
demonstrated high activity, outstanding selectivity, and recyclability toward the
alcoholysis of epoxides under ambient conditions. On the other hand, basic sites can
also be carefully added onto organic linkers by simply using N-containing ligands
as building blocks (Dong et al. 2013). Hartmann and coworkers demonstrated
the activity of NH2 functionalized MOFs Fe-MIL-101-NH2 and Al-MIL-101-NH2,
by testing in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between benzaldehyde and
malononitrile. The 90% yield of the expected condensation products showed the
high catalytic activity of the NH2-functionalized MOFs (Hartmann, and Fischer
2012). Other N-containing ligands such as pyridyl and amide are also used to
develop MOF basic catalysts (Hasegawa et al. 2007).
Metalloporphyrins and metallosalens are also grafted into MOFs. A porous metal
metalloporphyrin structure PCN-222(Fe) was developed by Zhou and his cowork￾ers, and it shows outstanding peroxidase-like catalytic activity (Feng et al. 2012).
Later, the same group also reported a number of extremely stable Zr-porphyrinic
MOFs, such as PCN-223, PCN-224, and PCN-225, which exhibit promising catalytic
potential (Feng et al. 2014, 2013). On the other hand, metallosalens are potential
starting materials for the synthesis of porous MOF catalysts, which have been
explored for heterogeneous catalytic applications. For example alkene epoxidation,160 6 Organic Polymers as Potential Catalysts
cyclopropanation, and hydrolytic kinetic resolution of epoxides with excellent
shape, size, and enantio-selectivities (Falkowski et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2012).
6.3.4 MOFs-Based Composites for Heterogeneous Catalysis
The catalytic applications of pure MOFs are limited by their poor activity from
having fewer active sites and low thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability from
the fragility of the metal linker coordinative bond (Yuan et al. 2018; Burtch et al.
2018). Many strategies have been put out to improve the catalytic characteristics
of MOFs. One such approach is based on the combination MOFs with a range
of functional materials to develop new MOF composites. The MOF composites
are composed of two parts, viz. MOF molecule and functional material. The
diverse functional materials such as molecular species, metal nanoparticles (NP),
polyoxometalates (POMs), and enzymes have all been combined with MOFs to
form MOF composites (Zhu and Xu 2014; Chen et al. 2017). Following sections
discuss catalytic activities of various reported MOF-composites.
6.3.5 MOF-Molecular Species Composites
Molecular species such as salen complexes, dye molecules, and porphyrin are
reportedly enclosed in MOF pores via covalent or non-covalent interactions.
The encapsulation through non-covalent interactions preserves the structure
and characteristics of molecular species by not disrupting their coordination
sphere. In addition, direct encapsulation can keep the mobility of the molec￾ular species to a certain extent, enabling them to incorporate with the MOF
backbone (Bogaerts et al. 2013). The effective encapsulation of molecular
species in MOFs can lead to better performance in a variety of heterogeneous
catalytic reactions (Juan-Alcaniz et al. 2012). Alkordi et al. (2008) reported
encapsulation of a porphyrin, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(1-methyl-4-pyridinio) por￾phyrin tetra(p-toluenesulfonate) ([H2TMPyP] [p-tosyl]4), in an indium imidazole
dicarboxylate-based rho-ZMOF. An enantioselective MOF-composite was reported
by Speybroeck and his coworkers, consisting of a chiral Mn(III)salen complex
entrapped in the MIL-101 metal–organic framework (Bogaerts et al. 2013).
6.3.6 MOF–Metal Nanoparticle Composites
Metal nanoparticles have received a wide range of interests because of their high
chemical activities. The high surface-to-volume ratio with a high surface energy of
metal nanoparticles leads to aggregation. The incorporation of metal nanoparticles
into the MOFs with large surface area and porosity can restrict the aggregation to a
certain extent(Chen and Xu 2019). Metal NPstypically serve as active centersfor cat￾alytic transformation when MOF–metal NP composites are used in a catalytic pro￾cess, while MOFs serve as a stabilizer to protect metal NPs with improved stability
(Chen et al. 2014, 2015). Yuan et al. reported a MOF-nanoparticle composite where
palladium NPs were supported on MIL-101(Cr). The resulting Pd/MIL-101(Cr) was6.3 Metal–Organic Framework (MOF)-Based Heterogeneous Catalysis 161
used as a heterogeneous catalyst with high catalytic activity and negligible metal
leaching for water-mediated Suzuki–Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of
aryl chlorides (Yuan et al. 2010). Immobilization of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles inside
the pores of a MOF MIL-101 was done by Xu and his coworker using a double solvent
method. They were able to synthesis Pt@MIL-101 composite without aggregation of
Pt nanoparticles on the surface of the MOF. The composite showed higher activity
for catalytic reaction in all three phases:solid-phase ammonia borane thermal dehy￾drogenation, liquid-phase ammonia borane hydrolysis, and gas-phase CO oxidation
(Aijaz et al. 2012).
6.3.7 MOF–Polyoxometalate Composites
POMs are a type of distinct, anionic metal–oxygen clusters, have a variety of features
that make them interesting candidates for prospective use in the field of cataly￾sis. Properties such as tailorable size and shapes, strong acidities, redox potentials
and solubilities offer excellent possibilities for different catalytic transformations,
although the small specific surface area and insufficient stability of POMs restricted
their applications (Chen and Xu 2019). A useful way of optimizing and stabiliz￾ing POMs to improve their catalytic capabilities is immobilizing them into MOFs
(Ye and Wu 2016; Du et al. 2014). Maksimchuk et al. reported POM–MOF com￾posites by inserting polyoxotungstates [PW4O24]
3− (PW4) and [PW12O40]
3− (PW12)
into nanocages of the metal organic framework MIL-101. The composite materials
PWx/MIL-101 (x = 4 or 12) were used as heterogeneous catalysts for the epoxida￾tion of alkenes with aqueous hydrogen peroxide under moderate reaction conditions
(Maksimchuk et al. 2010).
POM–MOF composites also find their applications in heterogeneous asymmetric
catalysis. Han et al. developed POM–MOF composites by encapsulating [BW12O40]
5–
and the chiral group, L- or D-pyrrolidin-2-ylimidazole (PYI), into MOFs, results in
two enantiomorphs Ni-PYI1 and Ni-PYI2 via self-assembly method, respectively.
The resultant composites facilitated the asymmetric dihydroxylation of aryl olefins
with high stereoselectivity by acting as amphipathic catalysts (Han et al. 2013).
6.3.8 MOF–Enzyme Composites
Enzymes are a group of extremely effective biological catalysts, capable of cat￾alyzing a wide range of reactions with high specificity and selectivity under very
moderate reaction conditions. They are made up of linear amino acid chains that
fold into precise and intricate tertiary structures (Benkovic and Hammes-Schiffer
2003; Dongen et al. 2014). These catalysts have undergone thousands of years of
evolutionary fine-tuning and exhibit remarkable efficiency, chemo-, enantio-, and
regioselectivity, although most of the catalytic applications are severely hindered by
their low thermal stability, low tolerance to organic solvents and metal ions, narrow
optimum pH ranges. Furthermore, the contamination of enzymes in the products
necessitates intensive separation and purification procedures. The immobilization
of enzymes on the MOF substrates can protect the enzymes from deactivation162 6 Organic Polymers as Potential Catalysts

reaction conditions, enhance their recyclability, and reduce their contamination
in the desired product (Lykourinou et al. 2011; Drout et al. 2019). The interactions
between the MOF’s functional linker and inorganic nodes with enzymes can sta￾bilize enzymes from leaching (Lian et al. 2017). Enzyme viz. Bacillus subtilis lipase
(BSL2) was immobilized into a Cu-BTC-based hierarchically porous metal–organic
framework HKUST-1 by Liu and his coworkers. The catalytic performance of
the composite catalyst BSL2@HKUST-1 was studied by using the catalyst in the
esterification reaction between lauric acid and benzyl alcohol (Figure 6.3). The
results showed remarkably enhanced enzymatic activity as compared to the free
enzyme in isooctane solvent (Cao et al. 2016).
The effective dispersion of the BSL2 on the mesopores of the MOF HKUST-1
prevents the aggregation of the enzyme and showed a 17 times higher initial rate as
compared to free BSL2. Additionally, the BSL2@HKUST-1 showed higher reusabil￾ity with only an insignificant drop in conversion after 10 cycles (Cao et al. 2016).
An interesting example of MOF-based biohybrid catalyst was reported by Wu
and his coworker. By stepwise immobilization of Pd nanoparticles and Candida
antarctica lipase B (CalB) onto a MOF UiO-66-NH2 they developed the biohybrid
catalyst and utilized it for the synthesis of benzyl hexanoate from benzaldehyde and
ethyl hexanoate (Wang et al. 2019). The resulting heterogeneous biohybrid catalyst
showed excellent catalytic efficiency for one-pot cascade reactions.
6.3.9 MOF-Based Heterogeneous Polymerization Catalysts
For the manufacture of polymers, using MOFs as heterogeneous polymerization
catalysts has been found to be an effective strategy. The ability to make structural
modification and highly tailorable pores of MOFs provides enormous possibilities
for the polymerization reaction. An in-depth understanding of the polymerization
mechanism is also possible because of the clearly defined structures of MOFs
(Goetjen et al. 2020). MOFs act as a promising catalyst in reversible deactivation
radical polymerization (RDRP) as well as coordination polymerization reactions
(Mochizuki et al. 2018).
6.4 Reversible Deactivation Radical Polymerization
(RDRP)
MOFs can act as efficient catalysts for RDRP reactions by replacing small
metal complexes. Use of Fe- and Cu-based MOF as heterogeneous catalyst for6.6 Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)-Based Heterogeneous Catalysis 163
polymerization reactions was found to be an excellent alternative option for metal
catalysts (Schmidt 2019).
Lee et al. demonstrated how to activate [Cu2bdc2DABCO] thermally using
amine compounds, such as added DABCO (bdc, benzene dicarboxylate; DABCO,
diaminobicyclooctane). Cu(II) MOF, DABCO, initiator, and monomer were mixed
and heated to begin the polymerization. The monomers, such as styrene, benzyl
methacrylate (BMA), 4-vinyl pyridine (4VP), or isoprene, were used in the process
along with ethyl α-bromoisobutyrate (EBiB) as an initiator. The catalyst showed
good catalytic activity for synthesis of polymers such as polystyrene, poly(benzyl
methacrylate), poly(4-vinylpyridine), polyisoprene in a controlled way, which was
previously difficult to do using conventional methods (Lee et al. 2016).
6.5 Coordination Polymerization
Another polymerization technique that heavily depends on metal complexes,
particularly metal–monomer complexes, is coordination polymerization. As a
result, MOFs have been used often as coordination polymerization catalysts. The
polymerization mechanism and product characteristics, such as molar mass or
stereoselectivity, can be greatly influenced, particularly by the defined crystal
structure and surroundings of the catalytic center. Ethylene is one of the major
monomers that has typically been polymerized using coordination polymer￾ization (Schmidt 2019). Liu et al. reported ethylene polymerization reaction by
using Cr(III)-based heterogeneous catalyst (IRMOF-3-SI-Cr). Salicylideneimine
was added to the surface of isoreticular metal–organic framework-3 (IRMOF-3,
[Zn4O(ATA)3]; ATA = 2-aminoterephthalate) to instigate a condensation reaction
with the ATA and enable it to bind to Cr(III) ions (Liu et al. 2014). Coordination
polymerization of butadiene is also studied by many research groups. Dinca˘
and coworkers reported a stereoselective polymerization of butadiene using
bis(1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b],[4′
,5′
-i])dibenzo[1,4]dioxin)-based MOFs, Co(II) ion as
metal sites (Dubey et al. 2017). In this approach, poly(1,3-butadiene) was produced
with 99% selectivity for 1,4-cis propagation. The catalyst was also reusable, and little
leaching was observed.
6.6 Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)-Based
Heterogeneous Catalysis
6.6.1 COFs Chemistry
COFs are a family of porous crystalline molecular frameworks that allow the
covalent incorporation of organic groups into an organized polymer skeleton to
construct two (2D)- and three-dimensional (3D) porous structures. The potential of
COFs to integrate various structural characteristics, such as stability, designability,
porosity, and tenability in a single material, makes them significant (Shinde et al.164 6 Organic Polymers as Potential Catalysts
2015; Xu et al. 2016). Again, because of their structural orderings, COFs enable
the precise insertion of molecular catalysts to produce a clearly defined structure
with a unique local interface that includes spatial confinement, electron density,
and orientation. COFs possess distinct structural characteristics over metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) in three main ways. They are as follows (Guo and Jiang 2020):
1. The covalent linkages within the framework maintain sufficient stability for
keeping crystalline porous structures in a variety of solvents, such as dimethyl
sulfoxide, imidazole, coordinative pyridine, strong acids (concentrated HCl),
and bases (NaOH or KOH) (Geng et al. 2020).
2. The intralayer π–π interactions between the layered structures of COFs can only
be exfoliated with significant external power and produces few-layer nanosheets
with retention of the fundamental structural characteristic of COFs.
3. Almost no catalytic sites that are covalently attached to the frameworks degrade.
6.6.2 Structural Origins of COFs for Various Heterogeneous Catalyses
COFs can be constructed as heterogeneous catalysts by utilizing different
chemistries because of the diversity of frameworks and pores. Guo and Jiang
(2020) examined four potential structural origins for designing COFs for hetero￾geneous catalysis, i.e., (i) skeleton design, (ii) pore surface engineering, (iii) pore
confinement, and (iv) systematic organization.
Usually, catalytic active sites are added to the frameworks of porous materials to
design them as catalysts. In fact, the active catalytic centers could also be found in
the skeleton of pure COFs. For some specific catalytic reactions, the linkages of COFs
can function as acidic or basic active sites(Yusran et al. 2020a). The incorporation of
catalytic sites on the pore walls can be done by fixing the side groups of monomers
used to develop the COFs. This method allows pore surface engineering of various
heterogeneous catalytic systems. Since pore size, pore shape, and pore environment
can all be fully designed and controlled, the open pores of COFs allow for the physi￾cal loading of a variety of catalysts, such as metal nanoparticles and enzymes. These
catalysts create catalytic systems by investigating confinement effects in the clearly
defined pores with specific local environments. COFs are also incredibly potent and
can be used to create multielectron catalytic systems for many chemical reactions,
which enables the effective transport of electrons to the reaction centers (Guo and
Jiang 2020).
6.6.3 Classification of COFs-Based Catalyst
COF-based catalysts are classified into four categories based on their structures and
chemical compositions: (i) COFs with reactive skeletons, (ii) COFs with reactive
pendant groups, (iii) COFs with reactive metals (including metal nanoparticles),
and (iv) COFs with molecular catalysts. The skeleton of pure COFs itself can act
as an active catalytic center (Yusran et al. 2020b). COFs can also incorporate reac￾tive pendant groups such as thiophene, methoxy, hydroxyl, sulfoacids, and chiral6.6 Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)-Based Heterogeneous Catalysis 165

pyrrolidine moieties (Peng et al. 2015; Huang et al. 2019) as catalytic sites. Contrary
to MOFs, which are made up of metal clusters that operate as reactive catalytic sites,
adding reactive metals (Ding et al. 2011; Aiyappa et al. 2016; Yan et al. 2019) such
as Mn, Co, Cu, Pd, and reactive metal nanoparticles to COFs involves a particular
design of the COF structure as a scaffold. COFs are considered ideal confinement
materials because of their excellent porosity and extensive capacity to accommodate
incoming groups from small-to-large sizes (Yusran et al. 2020b). This enables excel￾lent opportunities to incorporate various molecular catalysts (such as metal clus￾ters and polyoxometalates) (Kibsgaard et al. 2014) to construct a COF-based porous
catalyst with improved catalytic performance.
6.6.4 Applications of COFs as Heterogeneous Catalyst
6.6.4.1 COFs with Reactive Skeletons for Heterogeneous Catalysis
The active catalytic centers in the skeleton or linkages of COFs can catalyze specific
chemical reactions. For example, in 2014, Yan and other coworkers developed two
3D base-functionalized microporous COFs, namely BF-COF-1, and BF-COF-2,
as heterogeneous base catalysts (Figure 6.4). The imine linkages arose from the
3,5,7-tetraaminoadamantane (TAA) building blocks within the BF-COFs possessed
strong basic sites. On the other hand, the microporous nature of COFs can offer
a platform for size-selective catalysis. The catalytic performance of BF-COFs was
investigated using the conventional base-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation
reactions (Fang et al. 2014).
TheCOFs exhibited promising catalytic performance with significant conversions.
For example, for reactants with relatively small molecular diameters, BF-COF-1 and
BF-COF-2 demonstrated conversion rates of up to 96% and 98%, respectively. On the
other hand, catalysts showed lower conversion rates with reactants with relatively
larger molecular diameters. This work made it clearly evident how highly effective
size-selective catalysis could be carried out using BF-COFs with uniform pores(Fang
et al. 2014).
Another excellent example of a COF catalyst with a reactive skeleton is Py-An
COF, which is a two-dimensional COF with π-frameworks. This COF was prepared
by Jiang and his team and utilized it under ambient conditions in catalyzing
Diels–Alder reactions (Figure 6.5). The catalyst contains anthracene (An) backbone
on the edges and pyrene (Py) backbone at the vertices.
The excellent catalytic activity of Py-An COF promotes the Diels–Alder reaction
between 9-hydroxymethylanthracene and N-substituted maleimide derivatives
under ambient temperature. This finding shows that COFs with reactive skeletons
provide promising chemical catalysts that are simple to prepare without additional
post-synthetic metallation steps (Wu et al. 2015).166 6 Organic Polymers as Potential Catalysts

6.6.4.2 COFs with Reactive Pendant Groups for Heterogeneous Catalysis
In addition to reactive skeletons, COFs with reactive pendant groups have also
been widely developed for heterogeneous catalysis. The pendant groups with prop￾erties like electron-rich and chirality are catalytically reactive to several chemical
reactions. For example, Zhang et al. (2019) developed two chiral COF catalysts
named Tfp2-COF and TPB2-COF (Figure 6.6).
These catalysts were made of chiral pyrrolidine and DHIP moieties, respectively.
The catalyst Tfp2-COF was employed to catalyze the Michael addition reaction,
while the TPB2-COF catalyst catalyzed the asymmetric Steglich rearrangement
reaction. Both the catalysts outperform their amorphous and homogeneous ana￾logues in terms of stereoselectivity and diastereoselectivity (Zhang et al. 2019).
Therefore, these chiral COFs can be considered effective heterogeneous catalysts
for asymmetric catalysis.
Electron-rich organic pendant groups may also function in COFs as a reac￾tive catalytic center to catalyze specific chemical reactions. For example, an
electron-rich organic pendant group squaramide (SQ) was incorporated into a COF
via a bottom-up synthesis method by Li and other coworkers. The synthesized 2D
COF (COF-SQ) was then used as a heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogen-bonding
organocatalysis reactions (Figure 6.7). High catalytic efficiency and good recycla￾bility were achieved while using COF-SQ to catalyze the Michael-addition reaction.

COF-SQ was able to produce 95% yield using toluene as solvent at 50 ∘C for 24 hours
(Li et al. 2019b).
6.6.4.3 COFs with Reactive Metals for Heterogeneous Catalysis
The earliest report of a COF with a reactive-metal-based catalyst for heterogeneous
catalysis was reported by Ding et al. in the year 2011. They intercalated Pd(II) metal
into COF-LZU1 by treating COF-LZU1 with Pd(0Ac)2 using dichloromethane as
solvents at room temperature. The resultant catalyst Pd/COF-LZU1 was then used
to catalyze the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction between the bromobenzene
substrate and phenylboronic acid (Figure 6.8) (Ding et al. 2011). The product yield
of the reaction was 97%, with a very small amount of 0.5 mol% catalyst used. The
catalyst surpassed the Pd-containing MOF analogues with their high catalytic
performance under identical conditions (Llabrés i Xamena et al. 2007).
Metal nanoparticles can also be intercalated into COFs by reduction processing
using strong reducing agents. Nevertheless, intercalation is also possible without
the use of severe reducing agents, making them more effective and environmentally
friendly. For instance, Mullangi et al. reported a triazine(trzn) COF with the loading
of Pd nanoparticles into it. The resultant Pd(0)@trzn-COF catalyst was synthesized
in a single-step approach using alcohol as a mild reducing agent instead of a severe
reducing agent such as NaBH4, LiAlH4, or hydrazine (Figure 6.9) (Mullangi et al.
2015).
Remarkably, Pd(0)@trzn-COF catalyst can catalyze numerous Heck and C–C
coupling reactions with excellent activity. Mullangi et al. reported a Heck coupling
reaction between styrene and 1,4-dibromobenzene using Pd(0)@trzn-COF as a

catalyst. Even at a very low catalyst dosage, the reaction gave 94% product yield,
which shows excellent catalytic activity of the catalyst. Moreover, the catalyst
also demonstrated good recyclability with minimal metal leaching (Mullangi
et al. 2015).
6.6.4.4 COFs with Molecular Catalysts for Heterogeneous Catalysis
The immobilization of molecular catalysts into COFs has proven to be a promising
way of increasing the catalytic efficiency of COF-based catalysts. For instance, Gao
et al. synthesized three COFs composites by immobilization of varying amounts
of phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) onto COF-300. The resultant three composites
were denoted as PMA@COF-300a, PMA@-COF-300b, and PMA@COF-300c. The
catalytic characteristics of these composites were examined in the epoxidation of
olefins with t-BuOOH as the oxidizing agent (Gao et al. 2015).
As mentioned in the above table, PMA@COF-300c, which has higher amounts
of PMA, showed higher catalytic efficiency with 65% and 91% epoxidation of
cis-cyclooctene after three hours at 50 and 60 ∘C respectively, as compared to
the other two composites. However, the homogeneous PMA catalyst showed the
highest catalytic efficiency with 99% conversion after three hours at 60 ∘C. Again,
the relatively inert 1-octene was converted to 1,2-epoxyoctane by PMA@COF-300c
with 77% conversion after nine hours at 60 ∘C. Therefore, these findings indicate
that all three PMA@COF-300 composites are active and selective catalysts for a
variety of olefin epoxidation (Gao et al. 2015).
6.7 Polymer-Based Homogeneous Catalysis
The mainstream homogeneous catalysts have well-defined chemical structures
and have the ability of breaking, formation, and rearrangement of chemical bonds
(Van Leeuwen 2006). Chemical reactions catalyzed by homogeneous catalysts
are selective and specific, producing just the desired product. It is possible to
precisely manipulate the reaction conditions. Additionally, such catalysts can be
used in solution phase which allows for greater mixing and mass transfer. However,
it is reported that homogeneous catalysts are difficult to remove from reaction
mixtures that result into poorer catalyst utilization, catalyst poisoning, and low
efficiency. Other drawbacks of homogeneous catalysts include their susceptibility
to impurities, pH, and other reaction conditions (Ali et al. 2014). There are very
limited number of articles demonstrating the development of polymers that can
act as homogeneous catalysis. Below are a couple of examples of homogeneous
catalysts based on polymers.
Xie et al. have performed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of various
ketones by means of a copolymer of dimethyl aminopropyl acrylamide (DMAPM),
and N-p-styrenesulfonyl-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine (V-TsDPEN). The required
copolymer was synthesized under solvothermal conditions. The monomer required
for the reaction V-TsDPEN was synthesized from 1,2-diphenylethylene-diamine
and p-styrenesulfonyl chloride followed by the coordination of {RuCl2(p-cymene)}2.References 169
The resulting polymer is a pH-responsive soluble polymer and was employed as an
efficient catalyst. The polymer reduced acetophenone using the R-version catalyst
under identical reaction conditions, and enantioselectivity was unaffected (Xie
et al. 2016).
Using a biodegradable, homogeneous, and reusable polymer-supported catalyst
called PEG-SO3H, Paul et al. created a highly effective and affordable synthetic
process for the production of coumarin and uracil-fused pyrrole derivatives. The
Michael addition and intramolecular cyclisation was catalyzed by using PEG-SO3H
in methanol. The catalytic reaction results in the removal of the nitro group.
Additionally, the catalyst can be used for five cycles (Paul and Das 2012).
6.8 Conclusion
In this chapter, an effort has been made to discuss the recent progress in the
development of organic polymers for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous
catalysis. From the aforementioned discussion, it can be stated that polymer-based
catalysis finds a wide variety of chemical reactions that have industrial as well as
small-scale production. One of the advantages of using polymer-based catalyst isthe
ease of separation of the catalyst after the chemical reaction. In general, isolation
of the product after the catalysis does not require sophisticated instrumentation
in the case of polymer-based heterogeneous catalysis. In addition, the catalytic
properties of the polymers can be tuned by preparing composites with different
other materials such as metal oxides and nanoparticles. It is also well known that
polymers provide matrix-like structures or porous network that facilitates the
catalysis. The solubility of network structured polymers is relatively less and hence
can be easily used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, there are some challenges of
using polymers as catalyst from the perspective of synthesizing the polymers as well
as using them as catalysts. The reported polymer catalysts are non-biodegradable
in nature that make a permanent waste. Additionally, the synthesis of polymers
generally requires large quantities of monomers, radicals, and solvents. Therefore,
the production of polymers is not cost-effective. In literature, it was found that
most of the polymer-catalyzed reactions are performed at ambient temperature as
the catalyst cannot withstand higher temperatures and leads to different toxic and
degradation products. A great deal of scientific research and innovation is required
to address these issues in the future on the ground of polymer-based catalysis.

7.1 Introduction
In current days, the usage of polymers plays a vitalrole in every aspect of human life.
Their applications vary from everyday packaging materials, biomedical applications,
adhesivesto variouslarge-scale usessuch asin construction and manufacturing tex￾tiles. The modifiable structure, light weight, weather-resistant properties, low cost
are the key advantages of using the polymers (Godavitarne et al. 2017). Polymer his￾tory started with the development of celluloid in 1850s–1860s (Freinkel 2011). The
term “polymer” was first coined by Swedish chemist J.J. Berzelius (Feldman, 2008).
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was synthesized in 1920s following the development of
Bakelite in 1907 (Geyer 2020). Due to the versatile and durable nature of plastic, it
became the key element for the production of warfare materials during World War
II. The use of newly invented plastics in the postwar period increased to a greater
extent with the global annual production of two million metric tons (Mt) by 1950
(Geyer 2020). Plastic pollution is now emerging as a global crisis which has negative
impactsin every step right from the extraction, disposal till itsincineration (Ramesh
Kumar et al. 2020). The plastic particles being insoluble and toxic are a major marine
pollutant and can be ingested by marine organisms, leading to the accumulation
of microplastics and causing harm to many oceanic ecosystems (Koelmans et al.
2015). The conventional synthetic polymers usually originate from petroleum and
are non-biodegradable (Lu et al. 2009; Hazarika et al. 2015). In the process of poly￾merization including their synthesis, medium of reaction and chemical feedstock
induce toxicity. Petroleum as a resource is limited, and serious environmental issues
are arising due to the excessive use of synthetic polymers which have led to the
research of alternative materials to mitigate such problems (Lu et al. 2009; Haz￾arika et al. 2015). To overcome these drawbacks green routes are adapted for more
efficient modeling of polymeric substances (Erdmenger et al. 2010). Moreover, gov￾ernments around the world have decided to make stringent regulations to control
environmental issues and raise awareness(Hazarika et al. 2015). Therefore, attempts

are being made to generate new authentic and high-performance materials within
a rational budget in the last few years. Simpler chemical processes and innovative
product designs from chemical industries for future generations can assist in cre￾ating a lesser environmental impact. Researches have been going on to produce a
biocompatible alternative to plastic which causes no more threat to the nature and
can be disposed of easily.
The use of biodegradable polymers is a good alternative and more beneficial in
terms of different aspects than synthetic polymers. Biodegradation is the key fac￾tor for considering the utilization of natural polymers in different applications in
place of synthetic-polymeric-based products. Natural polymers are easily available
and have a low cost (Jiang et al. 2020; Rahman et al. 2021). Along with their low-cost
and eco-friendly nature, they are a desirable choice for the development of mate￾rials for replacing synthetic polymers. Naturally available, water-soluble polymers
are given more importance in the recent years to form a substitute for the synthetic
polymers as well as other natural polymers. Water-soluble cellulosic polymers are
easily available, low in cost, easy to synthesize, and more environment friendly as
compared to other polymers (George and Sabapathi 2015).
Water-soluble polymers have the property to dissolve, disperse, or swell in water,
resulting in a physical modification through gelation, thickening, emulsification,
or stabilization (Kadajji and Betageri 2011). The backbone of such polymeric chain
contains hydrophilic groups which may be nonionic, cationic, anionic, or ampho￾teric in nature (Kadajji and Betageri 2011). Water-soluble polymers can be either
synthetic or from a natural source (Kadajji and Betageri 2011). Polymers that are
water soluble when extracted from natural sources are termed as biopolymers, e.g.,
polysaccharides, protein, polynucleotides, and polypeptides. These biopolymers
impart specific biological properties, have distinct microstructures, and exhibit
perfect monodispersity (McCormick et al. 2002). Water-soluble polymers can
be either homo- or co-polymer where properties like selectivity, solubility, and
sorption capacity of metal ions can be controlled or improved by the selection of
comonomers (Rivas et al. 2018).
Solvents play a significantrole in the preparation of different polymeric-based sub￾stances. Various steps like dissolving substances, maintaining viscosity, heat trans￾portation, purification, and separation processes are involved when a solvent is used
in the preparation of a material (Cvjetko Bubalo et al. 2015). According to the green
chemistry principle an ideal solvent eases the transfer of mass but does not solvate
the reactants (Li and Trost 2008). The use of water as a solvent has multiple advan￾tages like being renewable, eco-friendly, and inexpensive compared to the other sol￾vents. Therefore, it is considered as the most ideal solvent available among all the
green solvents (Hazarika et al. 2015). However there are certain issues like water
impurity and insolubility of organic compounds for using water as a solvent.
The applications of water-soluble polymers are immense. Water-soluble polymers
can be applied to a wide range of industrial applications, where pharmaceuticals,
food industries, water treatment, and textiles are few to mention but are not limited
to these alone. They have found variety of applicationsin oilfield treatments, coating
agents, cosmetic products, medical products, gel formations, textile industries, etc.7.2 Starch: A Widely Known Water-Soluble Polymer 177
In watertreatment, water-soluble polymers are used with ultrafiltration membranes
in a technique called LPR (liquid-phase polymer-based retention). This technique is
used for the removal of metal or metalloid ionsin water (Rivas et al. 2018). However,
limitations are faced due to the poor mechanical properties, heatresistivity, and easy
moisture absorption properties of natural polymers. Several studies have been done
for enhancing the properties of natural polymers.
In this chapter, we have tried to focus on the future aspects of two naturally avail￾able water-soluble cellulosic polymer, starch and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC),
which can be a preferable keystone substitute to synthetic polymers.
7.2 Starch: A Widely Known Water-Soluble Polymer
Starch is one of the most abundant plant polysaccharides. It is also a major source
of carbohydrates and energy. Cassava (Manihot esculenta), potato (Solanum tubero￾sum), corn/maize (Zea mays), wheat(Triticum aestivum), and sweet potato (Ipomoea
batatas) are the majorsources ofstarch (Ratnayake and Jackson 2009). It is naturally
regenerated in plantsthrough photosynthesis. Starch can be hydrolyzed into glucose
by the action of microorganisms and enzymes, through which it isthen metabolized
into water and carbon dioxide. It isthen recycled into starch again in plants(Lu et al.
2009). It is a suitable substance for developing completely biodegradable,renewable,
and low-cost sustainable materials. There has been an effort to lower the utilization
of plastic and solve the problem caused by non-biodegradable materials. Starch is a
good alternate material that can replace the non-biodegradable material.
Starch has numerous applications and can be used in synthesizing biodegradable
packaging materials for their odorless, non-toxic, and physiologically inert proper￾ties. They are widely used in hybrid materials suitable for pharmaceutical applica￾tions such as food grade thickeners, wound dressing, tissue engineering, emulsion
stabilizers, moisture binders in food products, and drug delivery (Jiang et al. 2020;
Shah et al. 2016; Hemamalini and Dev 2018). Starch films are used for protecting
food. Starch can be used as an alternative polymeric film for packaging of food mate￾rials which is environment friendly (Molavi et al. 2021). Starch films keep the food
fit for consumption for longer periods of time. Starch films are obtained from native
starch or from any of its component. With appropriate modifications and improve￾ments, natural polymers become a favorable material for any commercial, industrial,
or other required purposes. They can be obtained either by solution casting or by
thermoplastic processing, i.e., wet method and dry method, respectively (Jimenez
et al. 2012). Pareta and Edirisinghe (2006) have developed a novel method for the
preparation of starch films and coating.
7.2.1 Structure of Starch
Starch is mainly stored as carbohydrates in plants in the form of insoluble,
semi-crystalline granules (Copeland et al. 2009). It is the second most abundant
polysaccharide after cellulose found in plants. It isfound deposited in different parts178 7 Environmental Fate of Water-Soluble Cellulosic-Polymer-Based Composites
of the plant such as the stem, tuberous tissues, seeds, and even in different algae
(Hemamalini and Dev 2018). The molecular structure of starch is mainly composed
of amylose and amylopectin which are two different polymers of D-glucopyranose.
Amylose is made up of α (1,4)-linked glucopyranose units with a molecular
mass ranging from 105 to 107 g mol−1. While generally amylose is considered as
a linear chain molecule, most amylose molecules when prepared contain two to
five branches (Whistler and Daniel 2000). Amylopectin contains a backbone of α
(1,4)-linked glucopyranose units with α (1,6) branch points at every 20–30 glucose
units. Its molecular mass ranges from 107 to 109 g mol−1. The degree of polymer￾ization of amylose and amylopectin is found to be around 6000 and 2,000,000,
respectively. Amylose mostly forms the amorphous region, while amylopectin
constitutes the crystalline region of the starch granule (Hemamalini and Dev 2018;
Thakur et al. 2019). The percentage of amylose and amylopectin content basically
depends on the source of starch. However, approximately 10–20% of amylose and
80–90% of amylopectin are generally found to be present in any natural source of
starch. Amylose is water soluble and has a helical structure. Amylopectin forms a
helical structure and due to its crystalline nature, starch forms discrete granules
(Lu et al. 2009).
The presence of numerous hydroxyl groups on the starch chain results in the
strong hydrophilic nature of the starch molecule. In the structure of amylose
(Figure 7.1), two secondary hydroxyl groups are attached each at the C-2 and C-3
position of the glucose residue, and the C-6 position contains one non-bonded
primary hydroxyl group. These free hydroxyl groups can be easily reduced, oxidized,
form hydrogen bonds, and also take part in ether and ester formation (Lu et al.
2009). Variation in size, chemical composition, shape, and structure of starch
granules can be observed depending on their source of origin (Molavi et al. 2021).
The structure of amylose and amylopectin is given in Figures 7.1 and 7.2.
7.2.2 Advantages and Drawbacks of Starch as a Polymer
Starch is an attractive alternative to conventional plastics due to its inherent
biodegradability, high availability, easy renewability, low cost, etc. (Jiang et al.
2020). Non-sustainable, disposable plastic products available are problematic for
creating large amounts of plastic waste and environmental problems. Therefore,
new biodegradable-starch-based polymeric substances are being researched and
developed seeking for a better alternative. Starch-based materials demand a very

low material cost and can be processed easily by utilizing green routes giving rise to
eco-friendly and biodegradable materials (Jiang et al. 2020).
Various properties and characteristics of starch are utilized for creating films,
packaging, and coating materials. Starch is easily available, biodegradable, and
biocompatible and gives a high yield on extraction. Safe edible materials have also
been made possible due to the functional properties ofstarch. It is odorless, tasteless,
and generally non-toxic with nutritional values (Shah et al. 2016; Abe et al. 2021).
Starch can form coatings and films due to the linear nature of amylose. Starch-based
films are semi-permeable to gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide, lipids, moisture
as well as flavor components (Shah et al. 2016). Depending on the application,
color and transparency are other important features of starch-based polymers.
During modification of starch, color and transparency should be considered as
an important term as it reflects the utilization, consumer acceptance, and overall
appearance of the material (Abe et al. 2021).
However the poor physical properties of starch such as high hydrophilic nature,
low temperature of decomposition, and elevated recrystallization behavior limit the
use of native starch forthe preparation of end products(Baishya and Maji 2014). The
products prepared from native starch are brittle in character. Native starch shows
inadequate mechanical strength, dimensional firmness, and processability (Lu et al.
2009). Thus, modifying starch with proper chemical and physical treatment is neces￾sary forimproved applications and to achieve a broaderrange of functionality. Starch
can be modified by chemical or physical treatment.
7.2.3 Modification of Starch
Many of the naturally occurring polymers are not suitable enough to be used for
applications directly due to their low thermal stability, low water resistance, poor
mechanical properties, and chemical resistance properties of their end products.
Thus, it is necessary to modify starch in order to obtain the desired properties for180 7 Environmental Fate of Water-Soluble Cellulosic-Polymer-Based Composites
advanced applications(Baishya et al. 2017). The different chemical or physical mod￾ifications methods include blending, grafting, and use of crosslinkers to improve
the properties (Lu et al. 2009). Polylactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable polyester
that can be used to develop PLA/starch blends to improve their mechanical and
thermal properties (Zhang and Sun 2004). PLA, being hydrophobic, interacts
poorly with hydrophilic starch granules. To increase the compatibility between
hydrophilic starch and hydrophobic PLA different compatibilizers were used (Lu
et al. 2009; Zhang and Sun 2004). Introducing plasticizing agents such as glycerol
to the PLA/starch blend can convert the blend into thermoplastic starch (TPS)
which improves their dispersion and interfacial affinity (Lu et al. 2009; Ribba et al.
2017). TPS is prepared by heating at a temperature between 140 and 160 ∘C at high
pressure and high shear. TPS can be repeatedly softened and molded in the desired
shape (Carvalho 2008). The starch obtained from natural source has to undergo
gelatinization process in the presence of excess water where it becomes irreversible
change. Swelling of granules depending on the quantity of water is known as starch
gelatinization (Jimenez et al. 2012). Yam starch films is one of the examples of TPS
produced by gelatinization (Mali et al. 2002). In cold water, strong hydrogen bonds
(intermolecular and intramolecular) hold the starch chain together causing it to
be insoluble. When starch gets converted to TPS the hydrogen bonds of the starch
molecule are broken down which results in the degradation of the crystallinity of
the starch granule (Lu et al. 2009; Ribba et al. 2017). This allows the reaction of
water molecules with the hydroxyl groups of the starch granules making it partially
soluble in water (Ribba et al. 2017). Modification of starch chemically can improve
the barrier and physiochemical properties, but at the same time it reduces its
biodegradation property to a certain level. The key factor for lower biodegradation
rate is due to the reduced degree of hydrophilicity of the modified starch. When
starch is treated through chemical derivatization, it becomes less soluble in water as
the interactions between the starch chain and water molecule reduce. Moisture is
important for microorganisms to multiply and break down a starch bioplastic (Abe
et al. 2021). One of the best and encouraging products is to manufacture products
that are eco-friendly and less dependent on fossil fuels. Few of the ways by which
the properties of polymers can be modified are grafting, blending, crosslinking, etc.
(Hazarika et al. 2015).
7.2.3.1 Grafting
Grafting is often considered a very important technique to alter the chemical as well
as the physical properties of starch. Different functional groups are incorporated in
the polymers for improving the properties of the final products. Various techniques
are used to graft copolymerize depending on the monomer of the polymeric back￾bones (Baishya and Maji 2016a). In grafting, the monomers are bonded covalently
onto the main long chain of the polymer, and further polymerization takes place on
this chain (Haroon et al. 2016). Grafting can be carried out by different techniques
such as free radical polymerization, coupling reactions, and controlled radical poly￾merization (Meimoun et al. 2018;Chen et al. 2017).In orderto graft, an active site has
to be formed in the mid of the polymeric chain, where the grafting of the polymer7.2 Starch: A Widely Known Water-Soluble Polymer 181
takes place when exposed to the monomer that can bind to it rather than its end
point. Starch is more reactive as more number of hydroxyl groups are attached to
it. Grafting of renewable polymers like starch, cellulose, and polysaccharides with
synthetic polymers are able to produce hybrid products with induced control proper￾ties. Djordjevic et al. in their paper reported how grafting of starch with acrylic acid
in the presence of various initiators like AIBN, KSP, and BPO gives different results
(Haroon et al. 2016; Djordjevic et al. 2013).
Naturally occurring polymers are not water repellent and do not have good
mechanical strength to make use of them for better applications. Thus it is essential
to modify their native structure by grafting with synthetic polymer to achieve
molded innovative products with controlled properties and structure. Novel
renewable-based products have been designed through ring-opening polymeriza￾tion, controlled radical polymerization, and click chemistry giving interesting new
opportunities (Meimoun et al. 2018; Uliniuc et al. 2013). Radical polymerization is
often opted to produce graft copolymers. The chain transfer reactions are initiated
by the elimination of hydrogen atoms in most of the cases. Lately, graft copolymers
synthesized from natural polymers have been significantly increasing in the
industrial applications. Therefore, grafting has become a potential technique in the
modification of the properties of natural polymers by using different monomers
(Hazarika et al. 2015). Principally, there are three techniques used for grafting to
synthesize co-polymers, viz., grafting onto, grafting from, and grafting through.
Grafting onto process takes place between two different polymers’ functional
groups. In grafting from, the grafting takes place within the specific functional
group which triggers the polymerization of vinyl monomers. Whereas grafting
through takes place in the copolymerization of macromolecules. Among these three
types of technique the most preferred one is the grafting from, as it produces high
yield. The reaction pathways that grafting follows are free-radical, ionic path, and
living polymerization (Haroon et al. 2016).
7.2.3.2 Blending
Blending is another method used for the modification of starch which improves
the properties of starch to an utmost level. Blending is a physical method carried
out to modify the physical properties of starch. Blending is preferable more perti￾nently used asit is chemically safer and low in cost. Starch of various concentrations
can also be blended with urea formaldehyde (UF) resin by esterification and oxida￾tion. The produced blend of UF-starch shows improved water resistant properties,
good insulation, low brittleness, higher temperature resistivity, chemical stability,
oil resistance, mildew resistance, slower aging, and also non-toxic to the environ￾ment (Gadhave et al. 2017). The wheat gluten protein and modified potato starch
(70/30 ratio) were used to prepare the composites using extrusion method, and it
exhibited excellent gas barrier properties for packaging applications (Muneer et al.
2015). Starch can be blended with petrochemical-based polymers to improve their
biodegradability (Bien et al. 2001). Naturally occurring starch found in potatoes is
modified with allylglycidyl ether (AGE), which is used in the crosslinked compo￾sites preparation (Baishya et al. 2017). One of the techniques used in blending is182 7 Environmental Fate of Water-Soluble Cellulosic-Polymer-Based Composites
heat-moisture treatment (HMT) (da Rosa Zavareze et al. 2012). By this technique,
the functional properties of starch improve exceedingly and so also its durability
(Goel et al. 2020).
PLA is another eco-friendly polyester which is used for various purposeslike pack￾aging of food (Muller et al. 2017), agriculture films, and medical devices. However,
the rate of its biodegradability is very low and gets delayed for recycling into the
ecosystem. To overcome this challenge, PLA can be blended with starch and wood
flour to increase the rate of its biodegradability and reduce its cost. Blending of
PLA with starch has shown to improve tremendously in accelerating the rate of
its biodegradability without generating any toxic substances that are harmful to the
environment (Gadhave et al. 2017). The blending ofstarch with other polymers with
proper ratio in the preparation of composites may provide some new alternatives
to the development of bio-based composites with enhanced properties. Starch was
physically blended with polyolefin as a filler by Griffin with low concentrationsrang￾ing from 6% to 15% to induce the degradation rate of the vinyl polymers through the
introduction ofstarch to the carbon-carbon matrix (Griffin 1977; Bikiaris et al. 1998).
7.2.3.3 Crosslinking Agent
Crosslinking is the chemical modification of starch which is carried out to improve
its performance for different applications (Baishya and Maji 2016a; Reddy and Yang
2010). Crosslinking agents are best used for the treatment of two incompatible or
semi-compatible materialsto improve their propertiesforthe advanced applications.
The agents are mostly bifunctional compounds, in which one functional is attached
to polymer and the other component is the reinforcing agent. Crosslinking alters
the intra- and interhydrogen bond of starch chains with stronger and permanent
covalent bonds.
The functional group plays an important role in deciding the properties of mod￾ified starches. Various crosslinking agents like dimethyloldihydroxy-ethyleneurea
(DMDHEU), epichlorohydrin, N-methylol acrylamide (NMA), and 2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate (HEMA) are used to enhance the properties of the starch-based com￾posites (Baishya and Maji 2014; Moad 2011; Hazarika and Maji 2013). DMDHEU is
widely used as crosslinking agent in the cotton and wood industries(Emmerich et al.
2019). N,N-dimethylformamide also shows high degree of crosslinking (Haroon
et al. 2016). Epichlorohydrin (EPI) is the most commonly used crosslinking agent
of starch. Jyothi et al. (2006) in their work on cassava starch reported using EPI as
crosslinking agent. The modified starch showed better water-resistance capacities
than native starch. Starch is also modified by AGE which gives several crosslinked
matrixesthatreduce the excessive motion of macromolecules and the hydrophilicity
of starch (Duanmu et al. 2007a). Crosslinking agents also play an immense role in
improving the viscoelasticity and increasing the strength of composites (Zeng et al.
2019). Baishya et al. (2018) have synthesized a nanocomposite blended with methyl
methacrylate-grafted starch and wheat gluten using citric acid asthe crosslinker and
reported the improved properties of the starch-based composites. The mechanism
of modification starch with the crosslinker and grafting is explained in Figure 7.3

7.2.3.4 Plasticizers
The brittle character of starch and starch-based composites restrict their applica￾tions in numerous areas. The properties of starch composites can also be improved
by incorporating plasticizer. Incorporation of plasticizer helps to improve the
properties of starch (Baishya and Maji 2014, 2016a). Plasticizers increase the
flexibility and toughness of the starch-based composites by internal modification
of the polymeric molecule. Plasticizer improves the flexibility and toughness of
the starch-based composites by modifying the internal molecular structure of the
polymer. Glycerol, sorbitol are most used plasticizers to modify the starch. Müller
et al. (2014) have prepared the starch-based wood compositesfrom starch plasticized
with 36% glycerol which notably improved the tensile strength of the composites. De
Carvalho et al. (2002) have prepared the composites from 30% glycerol plasticized
corn starch containing 10–15% wood pulp fiber which exhibited tensility of 10 MPa.
Chang et al. (2010) have prepared the glycerol-modified starch/cellulose composite
by casting process. Muller et al. prepared wood composites from plasticized starch
and the water adsorption properties, tensile strength, structure of the composite,
and shrinkage were observed. The modified polymer was shown to have increase in
strength and stiffness, whereas the shrinkage decreases at low level with 15–20 vol%
wood content. The strong interfacial adhesion makes it less water absorbable
maintaining the water uptake even in the presence of wood particle (Müller et al.
2014).
7.2.3.5 Use of Nanofillers
The use of nanotechnology in the field of composites to develop high-quality mate￾rials is one of the exciting techniques in recent days. Nanoscience and technology
is widely used for manufacturing of multifunctional products with supreme qual￾ity (Candan and Akbulut 2013; Montanari et al. 2021). The nanoparticles can be of
different dimensions like one dimension, two dimensions, three dimensions, and
even spherical or polyhedral. Nanocomposites properties differ based on the prepa￾ration technique used and the nature of the nanofiller. Addition of nanoparticles
into the polymeric matrix induces the chemical as well as physical characteristics
of the composite as compared to the one incorporated with microparticle (Baishya7.3 Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) 185
and Maji 2017). Nanofillers like SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, graphene oxide, and carbon nan￾otube (CNT) are widely used with the polymeric matrix to improve properties like
mechanicalstrength, thermalstability, flame resistance properties, water and chemi￾calresistance properties of compositesfor advanced applications.Incorporating SiO2
nanoparticles has improved the mechanical strength and thermal stability of poly￾mer composites (Deka et al. 2014; Deka and Maji 2013). Wang et al. (2013) have also
reported that SiO2 nanofillers have improved the mechanical and the thermal prop￾erties of nanocomposites. Yang et al. (2005) in their work used ZnO, SiO2, and Al2O3
as photo stabilizer with the polymer and reported the improvement in UV stability
and the thermalstability of polymer nanocomposites. TiO2 are used as photocatalyst
to decompose organic pollutants in water and are also used extensively in industries
like solar cells and catalysis (Etgar et al. 2012; Subramanian et al. 2004). Saraç et al.
(2019) reported the beneficial use of nano-TiO2, nano-SiO2 on composites which
shows improvement in the mechanical properties.
Graphene polymeric material has been used for many polymer matrixes, like
epoxy, polystyrene, polypropylene, nylon in many applications. Graphene oxide
gives outstanding properties because of its higher surface area. These graphene
fillers make the material mechanically tougher. Graphene and TiO2 are used
extensively as fillers for the purpose of improving the functionality of polymers
(Kavimani et al. 2020). CNTs are long, cylindrical shaped nanostructures (Hazarika
et al. 2015; Ebbesen 1994). The length of the CNT varies from nanometers to micron
to millimeters and radius can be in the size of nanometer (Dresselhaus et al. 2000).
The awesome physical and the chemical properties of CNT nanocomposite have
made many interested to work on the wood nanocomposite for the advancement
in applications (Hazarika et al. 2015). Cao et al. prepared CNT nanocomposites
from starch with MWCNTs as fillers and reported that with the presence of
MWCNT it decreased water sensitivity and gives better mechanical properties to
the nanocomposite (Hazarika et al. 2015; Cao et al. 2007).
7.3 Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC)
CMC is one of the most widely used anionic and water-soluble derivatives of cel￾lulose (Pettignano et al. 2019). Etherification of cellulose results in the production
of CMC which is used predominantly in the manufacturing of biodegradable prod￾ucts (Basta et al. 2016). In 1918, CMC was manufactured for the first time; however,
the commercial manufacturing of CMC was approved in the early 1920s in Ger￾many (Paria and Rai 2022). Its flexile characteristics include bio-adhesive nature,
pH sensitivity, non-toxicity, hydrophilicity, thermal gelation, and viscosity due to
which CMCs are given higher importance than the other derivatives of cellulose
(Pettignano et al. 2019; Paria and Rai 2022). CMC is mainly obtained from its pre￾cursor, cellulose (Rahman et al. 2021). Cellulose is highly abundant in wood and
other plant-based sources which contain naturally a high amount of cellulose, some
of the examples being corn cobs, husk, and stalks, sugarcane bagasse, maize stalks,
and banana pseudo-stems. Alternatively, many researchers were able to introduce186 7 Environmental Fate of Water-Soluble Cellulosic-Polymer-Based Composites
some waste materials like waste textiles, knitted rags, cotton gin wastes, wastepaper,
and waste cotton linters from textile industries as raw materials of cellulose for the
production of CMC (Rahman et al. 2021). CMC is also present in itssodium salt form
or Na-CMC, and can be prepared by carboxymethylation of cellulose obtained from
banana stem, sago waste, paper sludge, and many other natural resources (Adinu￾graha and Marseno 2005; Pushpamalar et al. 2006). Cellulose undergoes etherifica￾tion reaction with anionic carboxymethyl groups(CH2COO−) and produces CMC or
its sodium salt which is capable of forming films with improved physico-chemical
properties.
CMC when used in its raw form shows inadequate mechanical, thermal, and opti￾cal properties. The substitution of carboxymethyl groups into its structure induces
the hydrophilic nature which is indeed an essential quality for its solvation in aque￾ous medium but also difficult to handle in some cases. The modifiable nature of
CMC makes it easier to manufacture CMC-based products with enhanced physical
and chemical properties. Various researches have been carried out for modification
of CMC and CMC-based substances via grafting, blending, and crosslinking pro￾cesses (Pettignano et al. 2019; Paria and Rai 2022). These modification processes
proved to be advantageous for the future application of CMC-based materials in dif￾ferent fields. The application of CMC and CMC-based hybrid materials relies on the
uniformity, purity, degree of substitution, and degree of polymerization which con￾stitutes the basic criteria for the improved performance of the products like size of
the particle, surface properties, thermal stability, mechanical strength, and viscosity
(Rahman et al. 2021). Several wound-healing CMC-based materials like hydrogels,
antimicrobial composites, films, 3D printing materials, and nanofibers have also
gained importance in the recent years (Kanikireddy et al. 2020).
7.3.1 Structure and Synthesis
CMC is an anhydrous polysaccharide of glucose where the repeating units are con￾nected by the – 1,4-glycosidic linkages and oriented in a linearfashion. At the molec￾ular level, the key distinction between the structure of CMC and cellulose is that in
the case of CMC anionic carboxymethyl groups are attached to the hydroxyl groups
of the glucopyranose chain of cellulose (Paria and Rai 2022). Being the derivative of
cellulose CMC possesses inherited structural properties such as (i) the glucose units
in CMC are rigid; (ii) backbone is fully extended in nature owing to restricted rota￾tion around the C—O—C bond between the glucose units because of strong steric
hindrance; (iii) orientation of the bulkier groups (–OH, –CH2OH, –OCH2COOH)
toward outside of the equatorial plane of the saccharic ring (Zhivkov 2013). The
three hydroxyl groups present in the cellulose monomer unit can be substituted by
–CH2COOH groups to reach the maximum value of degree of substitution to 3, but
generally it reaches up to 2 (Zhivkov 2013).
Williamson ether synthesis is usually carried out to prepare CMC which involves
two steps (Kanikireddy et al. 2020). At first, the cellulose obtained from various
natural resourcesistreated with sodium hydroxide which resultsin the formation of
alkali cellulose. The alkali cellulose is then allowed to react with monochloroacetic7.3 Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) 187
acid (Pettignano et al. 2019). In the final step, the anionic carboxymethyl groups
are adjoined to the cellulose molecule with the replacement of the three hydroxyl
groups with the varying degree of substitution ranging between 0.4 and 1.5 (Pet￾tignano et al. 2019; Wong and Ramli 2014). The degree of substitution determines
the availability of CMC with various molecular weights between the range of
90,000–2,000,00 g mol−1 (Kanikireddy et al. 2020).
The length of the CMC polymer is generally shorter as compared to cellulose,
and it consists of some regions throughout the molecule where uneven distribu￾tion of carboxymethyl group isfound. In lower concentrations CMCsshow extended
nature, while at higher concentrations overlapping and coiling of the molecules are
found which is followed by formation of thermo-reversible gel when the concentra￾tion is higher (Mishra and Kumar 2012).
7.3.2 Advantages of CMC
The presence of innate properties like hydrophilicity, bio-adhesiveness, stabilizing
power, odorless and non-toxic nature, viscosity, and pH sensitivity in CMC proved
to be advantageous for its application in many fields, e.g., biomedicines, cosmetic
appliances, drilling fluids, cleansing soaps, and toothpaste (Li et al. 2016).
The hydrophilic CH2COO− groups present in CMC increase the water absorption
capacity and formation of complex hydrogen bonding occurs due to the uneven sub￾stitution of the carboxymethyl groups. Thermogravimetric tests of CMC molecule
revealed that it is highly hydrophilic in nature as it contained water molecules even
after drying at 50 ∘C in a vacuum oven for 24 hours(Javanbakht and Shaabani 2019).
The presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the structure of CMC proved to be
a good absorbent of heavy metal ions (Abdulsahib et al. 2020).
CMCbeing polyionic in nature shows bioadhesive character and easily gets bind to
biological membranes as compared to other derivatives of cellulose and thus can be
used as filling agent for the preparation of transdermic and transmucosal medicines
(Paria and Rai 2022; Jiménez-Castellanos et al. 1994). It can be used as biopolymer
carriers as it decreases the toxicity of therapeutic agents. CMC is biodegradable and
it is broken down by the enzyme glycosidase inside the body. The 1,4 bond of the
CMC is broken down to simple sugar units by glycosidase (Aboagye 2015). When
present in the form of hydrogel which is an anionic polyelectrolyte, CMC exhibits
pH sensitivity due to the presence of carboxylic groups (Qiu and Park 2001). The
water uptake capacity of CMC is 5.11 g g−1 which makes it ideal for pharmaceutical
and food additives. Low viscous CMC can be used as moisture adhesive agent in
various food businesses, while the CMC having high viscosity are used in gelation
purposes. The solution of polymeric CMC is viscous in aqueous solution due to its
high solubility in water (Paria and Rai 2022).
The solubility of CMC is temperature independent and it is hydrated rapidly due
to its hygroscopic nature. The rapid hydration of CMC creates lumps when intro￾duced to water, which can be removed by high agitation or blending CMC with dry
substances like sugar before dissolving in water (cellulose).188 7 Environmental Fate of Water-Soluble Cellulosic-Polymer-Based Composites
7.3.3 Drawbacks of CMC
In spite of having versatile physico-chemical properties, CMC in its raw form
shows poor mechanical properties, acts as non-conductive polymer (Ampaiwong
et al. 2019), and is a poor shale inhibitor (Mishra and Kumar 2012). Moreover,
the single-electrode polymers of CMC are highly stiff, possess low electrochemical
stability, and reduced elongation at break (Arefian et al. 2020). The swelling
property of CMC-based adsorbents limits its application in various fields (Chen
et al. 2019). CMC-based films have low water resistance and are soft in nature (He
et al. 2020). The sodium salt of CMC is unstable in aqueous environment due to its
high water solubility which restricts its medicinal use (Lee et al. 2015).
Viscosity also plays a crucial role for the application of CMC in different fields
(Rahman et al. 2021). The high viscosity-type CMC is used in gelating purposes,
while the CMC of low viscosity is used in moisture-binding applications (Theeuwen
and Dijk 2006). Sodium bentonite acts as viscosity modifier when added to low
viscosity-type CMC which helps in drilling mud system. Adding CMC induces the
viscous nature of bentonite, and thus loss of fluid in drilling system can be reduced
(Abu-Jdayil and Ghannam 2014). Although Na-CMC has excellent properties for
its use in medicines, its water-soluble nature cannot be handled in wet processes
(Lee et al. 2015).
7.3.4 Modification of CMC
CMC is given more preference than other cellulose derivatives because of its wide
range of properties and its ability to undergo further modifications(Basta et al. 2016).
The drawbacks of raw CMC and CMC-based materials can be eliminated by its sur￾face modificationslike grafting, blending, and introducing crosslinking agents.CMC
backbone when grafted with synthetic polyacrylamide (PAM) forms good floccu￾lating agent as the copolymerization of the two polymer increases shear stability
(Dahlan et al. 2018).
Grafting of CMC backbone with acrylic acid and acrylamide modifies the sur￾face and enhances the adsorption of dyes and helps to eliminate toxic trace metal
ions (Radwan et al. 2018). CMC when blended with PVC forms a composite which
is hydrophilic in nature and helps in producing biomaterials and in drug-delivery
system (Arefian et al. 2020). The modified CMC with gelatin when crosslinked by

iron produces ibuprofen-encapsulated beads which are helpful for oral sustained
delivery of drug, which is not suitable for CMC alone (Javanbakht and Shaabani
2019). Blending of CMC with polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer (PVP) and doped with
SeO2 results in the production of CMC/PVP nanocomposite which shows improved
thermal, optical, and dielectric propertiesfor its use in device applications(Gaabour
2020).
7.4 Properties of Water-Soluble Polymer-Based
Composites
7.4.1 Mechanical Properties
The most important properties of the prepared water-soluble polymer-based com￾posites are their high mechanical strength for their end uses. The mechanical prop￾erties of water-soluble polymer depend on the use of crosslinking agents, treatments
of fibers, and the content of fiber (Hazarika et al. 2015). Also, the other parame￾ters which influenced are the tensile strength, flexural strength and their modulus,
the nature of crosslinkers, polymer–fiber ratio, effects of nanofillers, etc. The inter￾actions among polymer, crosslinker, and reinforcing agent plays a pivotal role for
improving the mechanical properties of the water-soluble polymer-based compos￾ites. Addition of nanofiller significantly enhances the interactions which improve
the mechanical properties. The content of fiber in the polymeric matrix plays a sig￾nificant role in enhancing the mechanical properties of a polymer. The modulus of
a polymer is affected by the properties of the fiber content polymer.
Baishya and Maji (2014) studied the crosslinking of methyl-methacrylate-grafted
starch with wood flour using three different crosslinkers NMA, glutaraldehyde (GA),
and DMDHEU and compared their change in mechanical properties. The DMD￾HEU crosslinked composites have showed maximum improvement in mechanical
strength. Incorporation of montmorillonite clay further improved the properties of
starch-based composites (Baishya and Maji 2016a). The mechanical properties of
the composites are depicted in Table 7.1. Fillers like mineral clay also improve the
mechanical properties (Wilhelm et al. 2003). Liu et al. (2013) in their finding have
shown that mechanical properties of the polymer improve by the reinforcing agents.

The more the hydrophobic high degree of substitution, the superior is the mechani￾cal properties (Duanmu et al. 2007b). Mali et al. (2005) tested the mechanical prop￾erties of starch by puncture test and tensile test. Modified thermoplastic starch with
the inclusion of wood particles enhanced the stiffness and strength properties of the
composite (Fekete et al. 2018).
CMC film developed from the H2O2-bleached palm bunch and bagasse with con￾trolled amount of H2O2 incorporation shows strong mechanical properties, high
solubility, and viscosity (Suriyatem et al. 2020). The films produced by combina￾tion of polyethylene glycol and sodium-based clay nanofillers induce the mechan￾ical strength of the CMC film which suggests the applicability of these films for
food packaging (de Melo Fiori et al. 2019). Several studies have also been made
where incorporation of CMC has led to the improvement of other cellulose and
starch-based films. Soy protein isolate when combined with CMC in the presence
of an antioxidant like catechin induces the tensile strength as well as water solubil￾ity of the film. The stress–strain curve obtained from the uniaxial tensile strength
tests validated the results (Han et al. 2015).
7.4.2 Thermal Resistance Properties
The most desired characteristics of the water-soluble polymer-based composites are
their thermal stability. The thermal resistance characteristics of the composites are
studied by DSC and TGA (LeCorre et al. 2012). The incorporation of nanoparticles
like SiO2, TiO2, and CNT in the polymeric matrix improves thermal properties like
initial decomposition temperature (Ti
) and maximum pyrolysis temperature (Tm).
Baishya et al. (2018) have reported that the addition of TiO2 in the starch-based
composites increased the thermal stability significantly compared to untreated
one. The multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were used to prepare highly
thermal-resistant starch-based natural fiber composites (Baishya and Maji 2016b).
LeCorre et al. (2012) reported that starch with amylose content shows less influence
on the thermal stability. Surface modifications of the composites are often carried
out to improve the thermal properties (Rosa et al. 2009). The nature of crosslinkers
also plays an important role on the thermal stability of starch-based composites.
Baishya and Maji have reported that DMDHEU crosslinked wood starch com￾posites showed better thermal resistivity than the NMA and glutaraldehyde (GA)
crosslinked composites (Baishya and Maji 2014; Baishya et al. n.d.). Reddy and
Yang (2010) have reported that starch films that are crosslinked have much higher
strength and thermal stability than those that are not crosslinked.
For the facile application of the CMC-based substances thermal stability is often
considered as a key factor. Incorporation of carbon dots into the hybrid film of
CMC-Na salt and sodium alginate produces a fluorescent film which is sensitive to
Ag+ and Fe3+. The produced film possesses low elongation at break (23.54%), higher
tensile strength of 52.38 MPa, and good thermal stability (da Silva Junior et al.
2021). CMC when crosslinked with collagen (COL) nanofibers produced CMC/COL
composites which has been able to exert low- and high-temperature stability better
than native COL nanofibers. The hydrogen bonds between carboxyl or hydroxyl7.4 Properties of Water-Soluble Polymer-Based Composites 191
groups of CMC and amino or carboxyl groups of COL resulted in the crosslinking
of CMC and COL nanofibers (Tian et al. 2021). Mallikajurna and Rajender have
reported the metal ion incorporation effect into the CMC film. The nanocomposites
of CMC with metals like Cu, Ag, Fe and In are found to provide enhanced thermal
stability, decompose at higher temperatures, exhibit luminescence, and show
antibacterial, antifungal properties (Nadagouda and Varma 2007).
7.4.3 Water Resistance and Dimensional Properties
The hydrophilicity of starch has been a major concern, and the main drawbacks
of starch-based composites and thus limiting it to be applied directly for many
applications (Duanmu et al. 2007b). Starches are/can be blended with various
synthetic polymers to make better resistance to water. Water resistance property
can be improved by converting the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups to a large number
and less polar group. It can also be improved by adding crosslinking agents like
glyoxal, which create network structures within the polymer. It has been shown that
blending ofstarch with hydrophobic polymers, like latex or cassava foams, increases
the water resistance of starch (Soykeabkaew et al. 2015). The grafting of starch
with methyl methacrylate improved the water resistance properties as reported by
Baishya and Maji (2014). The incorporation of nanoparticles like SiO2, TiO2, CNT,
and graphene oxide also induces the water resistance properties of starch-based
composites (Baishya and Maji 2017, 2018). Deng and Catchmark (2014) prepared an
insoluble bio-composite by crosslinking potato starch and chitosan by microwave
treatment and showed that the uptake behavior of the solution depends both on
the pH and content of the chitosan. Introducing functionalized-MWCNT in the
starch composites shows in the reduction of the water vapor permeability rate of the
composites as the voids present inside the molecular structure of the composites
were filled up by the MWCNT (Baishya and Maji 2016b).
Incorporation of cotton nanofibril obtained from cotton linter pulp with CMC
forms an edible nanocomposite film which shows excellent water vapors resistance
at 5 wt% along with high mechanical stability. The water vapor diffusion rate can
be decreased by cellulose nanofibril incorporation, but at 10 wt%, permeability of
water vapor is reduced due to agglomeration of nanofibrils (Oun and Rhim 2015).
Cassava starch when modified to form CMC starch by etherification process at
atmospheric pressure followed by the incorporation of waterborne polyurethane
forms a polymeric film which shows better water resistivity due to the substitution
of the –OH group of cassava starch with the ether CMC starch. Polyurethane induces
the water-resistant property of the film as it acts as surface sizing material. It fills
up the interspaces and forms a continuous layer (Rusman et al. 2017).
7.4.4 Chemical Resistance Properties
The chemical resistivity of water-soluble polymers is crucial for the enhanced qual￾ity and longevity of the desired polymer. Most of the starch composites are used in
our daily life for food packing and medical applications (Gürler et al. 2021). There192 7 Environmental Fate of Water-Soluble Cellulosic-Polymer-Based Composites
is a chance that these biocomposites may come in contact with moisture or water or
any chemical like solventsthere by degrading and losing itsfunction. In recent times
there have been many researches on starch biocomposites to improve the chemical
resistance and so that they can be used without any problem (Benito-González et al.
2019; Wan et al. 2009). Though many articles are available, a few reports are avail￾able about the chemical resistivity of starch biocomposites. Starch biocomposites
are excellent materials for applications, if their chemical resistivity properties are
advanced.
The films prepared by CMC blending with polysaccharides are found to exhibit
barrier against various lipids and gases, are resistant to microbial growth and there￾fore can be used for the application of food packaging (Varaprasad et al. 2011). Aulin
et al. studied the O2 permeability rate and oil-resistant nature of carboxymethylated
microfibrillated cellulose films. The oxygen permeability of the film was found to
be lower than other natural polymeric films made up of starch and whey proteins.
Incorporation of fibrilsreduced the surface porosity asinvestigated by scanning elec￾tron microscopy, which explains the excellent oil barrier property of the film (Aulin
et al. 2010). Composite films made up of natural rubber and eucalyptus microcel￾lulose fiber incorporated with Na-CMC are proved to be insoluble in solvents like
toluene. Toluene being a non-polar solvent does not solubilize the polar cellulose
matrix (Supanakorn et al. 2021).
7.5 Conclusion and Future Prospects
In recent years, researchers are more focused on the use of water-soluble polymers
in the designing of new environmental friendly composites. The use of water as a
solvent has multiple advantages, e.g., it reduces the use of chemically hazardous
organic solvents responsible for long-lasting diversified affect in eco-system and
environment, inheritably eco-friendly, easily accessible, and economically feasible.
Use of naturally available sources of polymers for our everyday use is growing enor￾mously due to their biocompatibility, easy synthesis, and benign nature. Natural
polysaccharides like starch and CMC proved to be two most flexible water-soluble
polymers for application in packaging, cosmetics, textiles, coating, adhesives, 3D
printing, pharmaceuticals, etc. Starch is economically cheap, abundant in nature,
easy to process, and does not require intensive purification; above all, they are
eco-friendly making it more advantageous than other polymers. Starch in its
native form can only be use for minimum purposes. One reason being that starch
is sensitive to moisture and water, and hence loses its functionality and starts
degrading once it come in contact. However, modified starch polymer can be used
for advanced applications as they show more resistance to moisture, chemical, heat,
micro-organism, etc., and also in their durability or long-time performance as their
mechanical and thermal properties are improved. Similarly, CMC also possesses
advantages like easy availability, biodegradation, and non-toxicity due to which
CMC has been able to substitute synthetic polymers in recent times. Modified CMC
products including CMC hydrogels, films, nanocomposites, and other bio-hybridsReferences 193
exhibit better properties which induces its application in food, cosmetics as well
as in pharmaceutical industries. These two polymers show a great tendency to
substitute synthetic polymer in the future.

8.1 Introduction
Porous organic polymers (POPs), a particular sort of porous substance, have pores
that are connected by covalent bonds. The principal connecting factors among the
frameworks are light elements like C, H, N, O, and B. This creates a structure with a
low density, exceptionalstability, and a high specific surface area. POPs are used in a
wide range of industries, including gas adsorption, gas partition, catalysis, synthetic
sensors, and energy storage. The concavities in the component molecules result in
inefficient molecular packing, which givesrise to the porosity of the synthetic porous
organic materials (Taylor et al. 2016). The manufactured porous organic materials
achieve their porosity through ineffective molecular packing, which happens when
the component molecules exhibit concavities (Taylor et al. 2016). POPs can be clas￾sified into the accompanying gatherings.
8.1.1 Hypercross-linked Polymers (HCPs)
In order to stop polymer chains from clustering tightly, HCPs belong to polymers
created through intensive cross-linking (Wood et al. 2007). Scholars devote more
attention to them because of their high specific surface area, simple response, and
inexpensive preparation. HCPs are mostly synthesized using Friedel–Crafts chem￾istry (Wood et al. 2008) which proceeds swiftly to produce strong connections and
results in a densely cross-linked network with high porosity. For example, through
the Friedel–Crafts self-condensation of bischloromethyl (BCM) monomers such as
dichloroxylene (DCX) and 4,40-dichlorobenzene, a number of hyper-cross-linked
polymer networks have been created (Wood et al. 2008). HCPs are mostly made using
the resulting techniques (Li et al. 2021):
The storage and adsorption of gases, catalysis, the elimination of aromatic
chemicals from water, and other applications are all possible uses for HCPs.

Three techniques are employed to create HCPs: direct one-step polycondensation,
post-cross-linking of polymers, and external cross-linkers. The third synthesis
method development has increased the diversifiable of HCPs (Das et al. 2017).
● One-step self-condensation of small-molecule functionalized monomers after
post-cross-linking functional-group-containing polymer precursors.
● By using brittle aromatic monomers weaved into diplomatic liaison officer’s
uniform.
In addition, the range ofsynthesistechniques, exceptionalstructural qualities, and
simple synthesis process of HCPs make them viable adsorbents for volatile organic
components (VOC) adsorption (Vallano and Remcho 2000).
8.1.2 Aromatic Frameworks with Pores (PAFs)
Over time, the aromatic frameworks with pores (PAFs) family has grown signifi￾cantly. It is a brand-new kind of material composed of micropores throughout. The
covalent bonds that bind the aromatic molecules that make up the open skeletal
structures can serve as carriers for small-molecule visitors.
PAFs can quickly be functionalized to increase their utility. PAF-3 leads the
way in this area in terms of PAFs’ outstanding ability in the selective adsorption
of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane. PAFs have had good
results in other areas as well (Das et al. 2017).
PAFs originally attracted the attention of scientists in 2009 with the discovery
of PAF-1, which has a stunning Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of
5600 m2 g−1. Materials with exceptional H2 and CO2 storage capacity and excep￾tional stability were generated using the Yamamoto coupling. With the help of
this reaction, which provides a simple synthetic method for the homocoupling of
monomers, large networks like PAFs conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs)
and other structures can be created. PAFs lose their framework conjugation because
the center atom of the tetrahedral monomers breaks the conjugation, but CMPs
retain the conjugation that arose from the monomers (Ben et al. 2009). The design
of PAF-1 was inspired by the crystalline structure of diamond, and it was logically
hypothesized that maintaining the stability (comparable to diamond) in the struc￾ture of PAF-1 and allowing for sample exposure of the phenyl groups, which might
help increase the internal surface area of PAF-1, would maintain the C—C covalent
bonds of diamond with phenyl groups. PAF-1 was characterized using theoretical
models, which led to the discovery of a previously unheard of BET surface area of
5640 m2 g−1 and a density as low as 0.315 g cm−3 (Ben et al. 2009).
PAFs can be viewed as pure benzene-ring-structured conjugated microporous
organic polymers (Lu et al. 2021). Different building blocks and coupling reactions
have been used to create PAFs with variable specific surface areas, pore volumes,
and pore sizes. PAFs can tolerate extreme environments that are acidic, alkaline,
and humid, which is crucial for their industrial uses. PAFs often have a hydropho￾bic structure because they contain benzene rings and covalent bonds between
carbon atoms. PAFs’ hydrophobicity aids in improving the ability of more aromatic
chemical molecules, including benzene and toluene, to adsorb (Ben et al. 2009).8.2 Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity 203
8.1.3 Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)
CMPs, the first microporous natural materials with tunable pore qualities, are built
from a formed skeleton, and the whole organization is formed on the other hand
with – formed or – joints. There are various CMPs materials that have formed
ethynyl network models. Specialists’ advantage in CMPs materials (Jiang et al.
2007) has developed because of their unbending designs with formation, high
unambiguous surface regions, and excellent substance dependability. One of the
interesting assortments of hugely formed macrocycles that have been utilized
as building blocks to make high-porosity CMPs is porphyrins with 18-electron
frameworks. The porosity of CMP networks is fundamental for adsorption, and
earlier investigations exhibited that it was feasible to definitively control the CMP
organizations’ gap size by differing the length and size of the primary structure
monomer (Xu et al. 2013).
CMPs are the major naturally occurring microporous materials with tunable pore
characteristics. On the other hand, the entire organization is made up of conjugated
or linked bonds. Several CMPs materials’ conjugated ethynyl network architectures
are obtained. Researchers’ interest in CMPs materials has grown significantly due
to their rigid, conjugated structures, large explicit surface areas, and exceptional
synthetic security. Porphyrins with 18-electron frameworks are one of the fascinat￾ing types of large produced macrocyclesthat have been used asthe building blocksto
create high-porosity CMPs. A previous study discovered that altering the length and
size of the primary structure monomer may precisely alter the opening size of the
CMP organizations, which is important for adsorption given that CMPs networks
should be permeable.
8.2 Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity
Polymers of intrinsic microporosities (PIMs) are amorphous microporous polymers
with stiff polymer chains. They resemble an interlocking network of aromatic
rings with twisted or irregular locations. As a result, they are unable to pack
efficiently. Some PIMs can be used to make membranes for gas separation
because of their solubility in organic solvents and film-forming properties.
Four years prior, they published the design of a porous polymer made of
phthalocyanines connected to Spiro cyclic groups (Mckeown 2012, 2017).
In 2002, a technique for synthesizing phthalocyanine-based network poly￾mers was devised by a number of researchers using the phthalocyanine dye
(Mckeown and Budd 2002). Metal ion templates help the process. Spirobisin￾dane is a monomer that is created when 4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile reacts with
5,5′
,6,6′
-tetrahydroxy-3,3,3′
,3′
-tetramethyl-1,1′
- (Mckeown and Budd 2006). In
2003, the group disclosed the synthesis of a PIM based on hexaazatrinaphthylene.
This PIM may serve as both a catalyst and an adsorbent, and its surface area is
equivalent to that of the PIMs mentioned above (Budd et al. 2003). Recent studies
have focused on identifying applications for these porous polymers as well as204 8 Future Roadmap of Organic Polymers
enhancing their apparent qualities. One example is the electrospun reformation of
PIM-1, which offers increased surface area in the form of polymer fibers rather than
powder (Zhang et al. 2016). The most recent advancement in the tactical synthesis
of PIMs is the mechanochemical synthesis approach, which provides benefits
including fast synthesis and solvent-free reaction (particularly for PIMs with high
molecular weight) (Yu et al. 2016) PIMs, in summary, differ significantly from
other porous polymers. Despite having designed frames, they are microporous. The
porosity of these materialsis a property of the flexibility of the polymer chainsrather
than connected linkages within the substance itself. PIMs have large surface areas
in addition to special properties that make these porous polymers liquid, increasing
their industrial usage and allowing for the production of porous membranes.
In the adsorption of unstable natural atoms, POPs offer distinct advantages
over inorganic or inorganic-natural mixture permeable adsorbents, including an
engaging skeletal structure, a sizable explicit surface area, a flexible pore structure,
and super hydrophobicity. These characteristics lead to their common use in a few
applications.
8.2.1 Water Purification
● Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are structures made of permeable natural
atomsthat have covalent bonds between their monomers. Owing to their minimal
cost, reusability, potent characteristics, and considerable gas particle selectivity,
they have lately been identified as being brand-new, widely available, and
functionalized adsorbents, making them an anticipated adsorbent for wastew￾ater treatment, particularly for hazardous metals. Additionally, COPs remain
remarkably stable throughout a variety of testing circumstances, including high
temperatures and, in any case, boiling water. They have been used successfully
for natural applications like groundwater remediation, carbon dioxide capture,
and soluble take-up.
● Mines et al. have demonstrated composites of nano zero-valent iron impregnated
within various COPs (water miscible [COP-1, COP-19], and immiscible [COP6,
COP-60, and COP-61]) for decolorization of azo dye.
● Ko et al. created disulfide-connected polymer organizations (COP-63) and
connected them as an adsorbent for the expulsion of weighty metal particles
from storm water. They showed that COP-63 shows Cd2+ evacuation proficiency
identical to that of incredibly permeable AC in spite of its moderate surface
region. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are intricate polymers using
microbial totals as their framework. These macromolecules, which surround
the microbial cell in a three-layered grid and have a high subatomic weight,
include a mixture of polysaccharides, proteins, uronic acids, lipids, DNA, and
compounds that resemble humic substances. Similar to natural wastewater
treatment methods including membrane bioreactors (MBRs), activated sludge
processes, and fixed-film processes, EPS plays a crucial role.
● Thiol-functionalized POP was made using simple free radical polymerization
techniques. It is a cheap substance that is designed to capture mercury and then8.2 Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity 205
clean up the environment. The resultant POP had absorption capabilities of
1216 mg g−1 for aqueous mercury removal and 630 mg g−1 for airborne mercury
deletion. The substance exhibits quick kinetics and may reduce the mercury
concentration from 5 ppm to 1 ppb in less than 10 minutes, which is below the
drinking water limit set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (2 ppb)
(Aguila et al. 2017).
● Dai and associates disclosed a mesoporous polymer for recovering uranium from
seawater. Vinyl benzyl chloride (VBC) and divinyl benzene were used to create
the copolymer supports using 2,2′
-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and traditional
free radical polymerization Divinyl benzene (DVB). The poly(DVB: VBC surface’s)
region and pore geographies were adjusted as part of the DVB: VBC percentage.
The revolutionary polymerization atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)
of acrylonitrile (AN), which was later converted into amidoxime by the use of
hydroxylamine, was sparked by the chloride present in the poly(VBC-co-DVB).
When tested in a saltwater solution that was coupled with uranyl, the resulting
sorbents demonstrated an enormous retention of 80 mg U/g Ads (c. 6 ppm, pH 8).
Five gallons of genuine seawater were sent in for 27 days, and the result was a
take-up of 2 mg U/g Ads, exceeding the capability of the light-connected nonwo￾ven polyethylene benchmark material’s (0.75 mg U/g Ads) texture (Cheong et al.
1997; Sun et al. 2019).
● A new family of hexaazatriphenylene-based conjugated triazine frameworks
(CTFs) for efficient CO2 collection was recently created by the Dai group using
an in situ doping technique (Zhu et al. 2016).
● Through the Friedel–Crafts self-condensation of 50 bischloromethyl mono￾mers, including DCX and 4,4′
-bis(chloromethyl)-1,10-biphenyl (BCMBP),
Cooper and coworkers have investigated the methane storage capacity of a
number of hypercross-linked polymers (Wood et al. 2008).
● The El-Kaderi group developed a new POP known as BILP-101, which was
produced utilizing a cost-effective Schiff-based polymerization method with
simple, readily available monomers. BILP-101 has a greater capacity for
CO2 adsorption compared to other sorbents because of its high porosity and
imidazole functionalities, and its all-organic structure improves compatibility
with a polymeric matrix (Arab et al. 2014).
8.2.2 Catalysis
One huge area of POP application is drawing attention toward catalysis applica￾tion. POPs can integrate an assortment of usefulness into their skeletons. POPs have
synergist locales coordinated into them on account of the expansion of reactant
destinations to the skeletons. POPs are a sophisticated type of nanoreactors that,
because of their 3D open systems, enable the correlative usage of skeletons and
pores (Arab et al. 2014). According to a few POP types, the synergist properties of
POPs and theirfunctionalized offspring are assessed in the section below. Permeable
natural polymers without metals, chiral permeable natural polymers, permeable206 8 Future Roadmap of Organic Polymers
natural polymers supported by nanoparticles, and permeable natural polymers that
are photoactive are just a few examples.
In their combined study, Farha, Hupp, and Nguyen demonstrated how to insert
catalytically active Al(porphyrin) moieties into an all-organic porous network for
use in the methanolysis breakdown of a nerve agent mimic (Arab et al. 2014).
● Cooper and coworkers have developed a coordinated metal-organic conjugated
microporous polymer that catalyzes a reductive amination process. CMP-CpIr-3
is efficient for a range of alkyl, aromatic, and cyclic substrates and has a yield of
90% and high catalytic activity (Arab et al. 2014).
● The Coskun group revealed that a new family of nanoporous polymers contain￾ing sterically limited N-heterocyclic carbenes (NP-NHCs) had the greatest CO2
capture fixation efficacy for materials assessed as carbene-based materials in the
solid state, 97% at ambient temperature (Talapaneni et al. 2015).
The aforementioned polymeric adsorbents have a few benefits over other
conventional adsorbents, such as synthetic ion-exchange resins and commercial
activated carbons, including being more reasonable, suitable for removing a variety
of (hydrophobic) impurities, high adsorption and rate limits, high selectivity for
various concentrations, a large surface area, high strength, and ease of recovery.
8.2.3 Supercapacitors
● Recent research has shown that glass-like covalent natural structures (COFs)
and randomly generated microporous polymers (CMPs) in permeable natural
polymers (POPs) might provide attractive terminal materials for energy capacity
frameworks like supercapacitors and battery-powered batteries. Permeable
natural polymers (POPs) with nano-, micro-, or mesoporous underlying prop￾erties stand out for their true ability to be used in optoelectronics, catalysis,
gas capacity, and partition, among other fields, due to the uprightness of their
enormous available surface regions, magnificent warm soundness, and variety of
functionalities. Indistinct formed miniature/mesoporous polymers (CMPs) and
POPs made of covalent natural structures (COFs) have distinguished themselves
by fusing the benefits of conductive polymers with the high unambiguous surface
area of carbon materials, making them rather alluring candidates as dynamic
materials.
● The 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol with phenylenediamine moieties reversible
Schiff base reaction and irreversible enol-to-keto tautomerization were combined
in 2012 to produce two chemically stable COFs. A BET surface area of 535 m2 g−1
is present in the COFs that are produced (Segura et al. 2016).
● On to 3D graphene the author a noncovalent method to combine anthraquinone￾based COFs COFDAAQ-BTA with the conjugated surface (Zhang et al. 2021;
Mulzer and Shen et al. 2016) altered redox-active 2D COFs films by electropoly￾merizing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) inside COFs pores (Mulzer and
Shen et al. 2016)8.2 Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity 207
● By producing a series of aza-CMP utilizing an ion thermal condensation of
1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine with triquinoyl hydrate at 300–500 ∘C, Jiang and
coworkers investigated the potential of aza-CMP for energy storage (Xu et al.
2013)
● Wei and colleagues grew TpPa-COF on MWCNTs under solvothermal conditions
to create a unique core-shell COF/multi-walled (MWCNTs) nanocomposite
(TpPa-COF@MWCNTs) (Liu et al. 2020).
8.2.4 Removal of Organic Pollutants from Water
Porous organic materials are crucial for applications like wastewater treatment
because they have proven to be effective in identifying and removing pollutants
and impurities from water and other liquids. The HCPs work as potent catalysts for
the conversion of the adsorbed compounds when they are functionalized with gold
nanoparticles. They are able to efficiently adsorb aromatic molecules from water
(Yu et al. 2016). The bipyridinium cations display affinity for anionic organic dyes,
confirming the COF’s aptitude for the adsorption of anionic dyes from water. This
is the first report of a 2D polycationic COF. The COF-thioether LZU8’s functional
groups facilitate the removal of Hg2+ from water (Luo et al. 2016). The presence of
fluorine atoms and the significant specific surface area of the porous polymer are
responsible for PFCMP-0’s remarkable performance (Berton et al. 1999). PFCMP-0
has a great capacity for adsorption that makes it possible to remove different
types of impurities from water. PAF-45 may efficiently remove pollutants from
water because it has a positively charged surface and attracts negatively charged
perfluorooctanesulfonate molecules.
8.2.5 Template Synthesis Methods of Porous Organic Polymers
● Molecular imprinting: In contrast to the casting of macroscopic objects, colloid
crystal imprinting does not include any self-organization. Micellar aggregates are
the most basic self-assembling form, and it is advised to use them before imprint￾ing since it is the next degree of complexity (Cooper and Holmes 1999). To create
porous polymer monoliths, ethylene trimethyl acrylate (TRM) was polymerized
in supercritical scCO in the presence of AOT micelles that were swelled with
water. No extra stabilizers were required to create a single-phase system prior to
polymerization since the high monomer concentration of 50% prevented them
from being needed. BET tests revealed that the radical polymerization-produced
gels had a median pore width of 25 nm and a specific surface area of 260 m2 g−1.
Purified scCO without AOT micelles allowed polymerization, which resulted
in substantially bigger pores with 100 nm diameters. Acrylamide and bisacry￾lamide were copolymerized in the continuous aqueous phase of a sodium
dodecylsulfate-stabilized macroemulsion. Therefore, compared to micellar
imprinting, the final polymer had much greater pore widths of 1 mm (Imhof
and Pine 1998). By polymerizing water-miswollen reverse AOT micelles in the
continuous phase, gels with closed pore topologies are created. Open porous208 8 Future Roadmap of Organic Polymers
polymers can be produced by polymerizing within additional self-organized
media, such as bi-continuous microemulsions.
● Colloid crystal templating: Micellar engraving is a transcriptive templating
strategy, much as sub-atomic engraving and colloid gem templating. On a
mesoscopic level, colloid gems show gigantic order, which could prompt different
captivating qualities, including especially high porosities at ideal mechanical
strength and photonic band holes. Greatest pressing thickness is accomplished
by means of the helpful crystallization process that makes colloidal gems. Colloid
gems display unprecedented request at the mesoscopic level, which might bring
about various amazing properties, like exceptionally enormous porosities at the
ideal mechanical strength and photonic band holes, for instance. The helpful
crystallization technique used to create colloidal precious stones takes into
account the greatest pressing thickness. Utilizing extraction, disintegration, or
calcination to eliminate the format after polymerization makes a permeable,
consistently requested polymer. The accompanying models exhibit how the col￾loid gem-templating approach, which was first produced for inorganic materials,
likewise applies to natural polymer gels (Xia et al. 2000; Velev and Lenhoff 2000).
Latex crystals formed by injection and buildup between two solid plates were
molded into porous polyurethane membranes. Following UV polymerization,
toluene was used to selectively extract the polystyrene lattices.
● Micellar imprinting: A method for creating polymers having molecularly
organized pores is called molecular imprinting (Wulff 1995). Thus, it is possible to
create synthetic polymers with complementary holes and molecules. Therefore,
exceptionally specific acknowledgment capacities similar to those seen in natural
frameworks are to be anticipated (for example enzymatic catalysis). Regularly,
a sub-atomic format (engrave particle) and additional solvents going about as
porogenes are available while utilitarian and cross-connecting monomers are
copolymerized. A few surveys on the production of microscopically engraved
polymers (MIPs) and their utilization in separation (Vallano and Remcho 2000)
and sensing (Takeuchi and Haginaka 1999) have been released. The templates
used in the majority of molecular imprinting techniques are smaller molecules
such as amino acids (Lin et al. 1998), sugars (Mulzer and Shen et al. 2016; Mayes
et al. 1994), oligo-peptides (Klein et al. 1999), or steroids (Cheong et al. 1997).

Despite the fact that there has been critical headway in the improvement of dif￾ferent applications for permeable natural polymers, like gas stockpiling/partition,

of work to be finished as far as pore structure customization and pore surface
customization are concerned. Permeable natural polymers have the advantage of
being entirely versatile concerning pieces, inside designs, and qualities, empowering
their coherent plan for a specific application. The scope of highlights and applica￾tions for permeable natural polymers, which are dependent on their utilization for
useful applications, will without a doubt be extended by future review, which will
include specialists from a wide range of areas. Then, making permeable natural
polymers with generally scattered dynamic destinations addresses a huge trouble.
Subsequently, making permeable natural polymers with exceptionally scattered
dynamic destinations and better than the ones that as of now exist is a huge test.
Doing so will empower the making of surface locales with a known coordination
circle, working with structure–action relationship studies. As enormous scope cre￾ation is a necessity for the vast majority potential applications, endeavors ought to
be made to keep creating methods that permit the versatile readiness of permeable
natural polymers using reasonable and environmentally harmless innovations.

Covalent–Organic Frameworks (COF): An Advanced
Generation of Reticular Organic Polymers for Energy and
Environmental Applications

9.1 Introduction
A growing curiosity in renewable and clean energy, such as splitting of water for the
production of hydrogen, cells and supercapacitors for the storage of energy, and fuel
cells for the generation of emission-free electricity, is largely driven by the serious
environmental problems brought on by increased emissions of greenhouse gases and
pollutants (COx, NOx, SOx, and fine particulates) as well as the rising global energy
demand.
The production of innovative materials is a crucial step for improving the equip￾ment and proceduresrequired forthe generation, conversion, and storage ofsustain￾able energy in the future.
Recently, a family of porous materials with fine-tuned morphologies has been
created; these materials have been dubbed covalent organic frameworks (COFs).
The concept of COFs was introduced by Omar. M. Yaghi and team in 2005 (Côté
et al. 2005). Porous organic frameworks known as COFs are created from lighter
periodic elements such as C, H, O, N, and B. Strong covalent bonds such as borosili￾cate bonds are then used to form the overall frameworks, thus giving them excellent
chemical stability (Wang et al. 2021a).
From then onward, the frameworks were tuned to fit the criteria for numerous
applications such as:
● Energy storage
● Elimination and detection of heavy metals and various industrial pollutants
● Electrochemical applications
● Supercapacitors and Batteries
● Energy production.
Although research on COFs and their electrochemical applications is still in its
preliminary stage, intrinsic properties like tuneable skeletons, large surface areas,
and almost perfect crystallinity have made them exemplary candidates to advance
electrochemical processes.

COFs are made up of lower mass elements including hydrogen, carbon, boron,
nitrogen, and oxygen as opposed to metal-based nodes and organic structures. Fur￾thermore, COFs can create both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional constructs. COFs
are made solely of covalent bonds, as opposed to MOFs.
Reversible covalent linkages exist inCOFs. WhenCOFs were still a relatively novel
idea, it was expected that this property would lower the stability. However, after
extensive study done specially to improve the stability, COFs are now much more
stable thermally than MOFs, which were first believed to be much more stable than
COFs. Often, MOFs are heavier than COFs. However, since only specific materials
and conditions may be used to build COFs, the number of MOFsthat have been pro￾duced significantly exceeds the number of COF structure moieties that have so far
been constructed (Li et al. 2020a).
9.2 Synthesis
COFs are generally produced by solvothermal condensation. It is the first technique
forsynthesizing COFs and enables a proper construction of the COF with acceptable
crystallinity and porosity. Usually, this synthesis is performed at appropriate tem￾peratures (80–160 ∘C) for specific days in a sealed airtight container under an inert
atmosphere. The monomers are added in presence of a catalyst under these condi￾tions. Parameters like temperature and nature of the solvent significantly affect the
quality of the product formed. On top of these, parameters such as type of catalyst
used and time is also monitored.
Other synthesis methods include microwave-assisted synthesis, mechanical
grinding, ionothermal synthesis, interfacial polymerization, and microfluidic
synthesis.
9.3 COFs as Thin Films
In addition to the COF films being developed on conventional electrodes to enable
adequate transport of e− and control of structure, developing COF films is essential
to building other vital components of various devices, such as the thin membranes
that separate the electrodes.
The bottom-up strategy, which is frequently linked to functional coatings on
selected surfaces, has been heavily utilized for the production of COF thin films
(Wang et al. 2021a). This method relies heavily on controlling the film’s growth ori￾entation and avoiding random extension. Numerous oriented COF thin films have
been synthesized using the bottom-up approach so far on a variety of interfaces.
Solvothermal synthesis can be defined as the process of coating the powder of
the frameworks on any type of support by drenching suitable substrates in the reac￾tion mixture, rinsing them with required solvents (organic), and then drying them
under a stream of nitrogen gas.9.5 Pore Engineering 217
Interfacial synthesis is a common approach of producing graphene nanosheets
and polyamide nanofilms. In this approach, reaction between the monomers takes
place at the point of contact. The confining of the COF development to the contact
area results in the formation of said thin films. In order to create COF thin films
by this method two interfaces have been used: the liq–air and the liq–liq (Dey et al.
2017; Feldblyum et al. 2015).
Bein and co-workers developed the mild process known as room-temperature
vapor-assisted conversion synthesis in order to compensate for the instability of
building blocks which are delicate to the harsh conditions utilized in solvothermal
synthesis (Medina et al. 2015).
This excellent technique enables the creation of COF films using delicate precur￾sors and on delicate substrates.
Although not as popular as the above methods, the top-down method, which is
another way to make COFs, includes making free-standing, one- ortwo-layered COF
thin films.
9.4 Polygon Skeletons
A special topology diagram that is based on reticular chemistry can be used to deter￾mine the structure of COFs. These are categorized as two-fold, three-fold, four-fold,
and six-fold axes of symmetry. Thus, the final structures of the COFs are just com￾binations of the building blocks (Figure 9.1a,b).
Depending on which two building blocks are combined, the structure of the COF
can be classified as: 2D COFs or 3D COFs (see Figure 9.1). Depending upon the
structural arrangements, COFs could exert extended conjugation in two different
directions found in 3D COFs or weak chemical interactions like hydrogen bonding
or van der Waal’s interaction between two layers of 2D sheets arranged along one
axis of the structural arrangement (Figure 9.1e). COFs offer several ways to design
structural motifsleading to cationic COFs having anionsseating within their pore or
vice versa anionic COF having cation neutralizing the framework charge. They can
have different functional guest species occluded inside the porosities playing major
role in overall functioning of the structure. As COFs are purely organic building
blocks, they can be easily modified synthetically even after their structural motif
gets synthesized (Figure 9.1f)
9.5 Pore Engineering
COFs have a high degree of molecular flexibility, enabling atomically precise inte￾gration of their constituent parts into porous structures.
The crystalline nature of the structure and ordered monomer units dictate the
porosity of these frameworks, which display surface areas of up to 4000 m2 g−1 (Med￾ina et al. 2015). Chemicalstability and its property to remain stable even at high tem￾peratures(greaterthan 400 ∘C) is a result of the high strength of its bonds, which can218 9 Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COF)

endure challenging circumstances including hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, and
pH range variations. Additionally, its reduced density permits a superior gravimet￾ric performance by virtue of the homogeneous composition and lightweight parts.
In order to modify the structural and functional features of COFs, it is necessary to
change the tuneable pore size of the pristine frameworks utilizing well-established
molecular organic chemistry.9.5 Pore Engineering 219
Nagai et al. published a method for pore engineering of COFs (Nagai et al. 2011).
A synthetic phenylene block with an azide added to it was employed as the wall
component in a 2-component condensation technique to fabricate frameworks with
azide-integrated walls. The click reaction and a 3-component condensation system
were combined to create a method that allows for control of the density and compo￾sition of groups within the porous sites. It has been established that employing this
technology makesit incredibly advantageousto build variousspecialized surfacesin
COF pores.
By using thisstrategy,several COFs with micro- or meso-scale tetragonal or hexag￾onal pores have been created. Despite the availability of numerous COF skeletons,
regulating the pore surface is still challenging since it has proven difficult to develop
a technique that allows for the systematic engineering of COF pore walls. COFs
would have a unique interface by customizing the pore surface to meet the require￾ments of each application.
The importance of creating reticular frameworks with a variety of connections
and their application in frameworks with different pore sizes, pore volumes, and
dual pores have been extensively discussed in recent years in a number of theme
viewpoints and reviews. Some highlighted linkages and pore geometry throughout
the years are being discussed below.
● BO linkage: Yaghi and co-workers described the self-condensation of a boroxin
building unit (COF-1, COF-102) and the same base building block was condensed
with catechol for creating the primary class of boronic acid frameworks (COF-5,
COF105) (Côté et al. 2005) hydrolyzed in moisture because of the B—O linkage
susceptibility. A further point made by Dichtel and co. wasthe rapid dissociation of
HHTP-DPB COF in aqueous solution (Spitler et al. 2011). Yaghi’s group modified
the framework created by the reaction of silanols with RB(OH)2 in order to boost
stability.
● CN linkage: Yaghi synthesized a framework employing dynamic imine linkage,
which was more stable than boron-linked frameworks (Uribe-Romo et al.
2009). By reacting 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol, p-phenylenediamine, and
2,5-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, Banerjee and co-workers produced TpPa-1
and TpPa-2, which further increase the stability of imine-based frameworks
(Chandra et al. 2013). Aldimine condensation led to stability and was then
followed by irreversible tautomerism from enol-imine to ketoenamine. The
crucial significance of C–N links has also reportedly been highlighted in recent
years by COFs based on squaraine and violagen (Nagai et al. 2011).
● CC linkage: The Hecht and co-workers published the pioneer C–C single bond
framework made by utilizing the Ullmann coupling reaction followed by
Knoevenagel condensation for constructing framework (Grill et al. 2007). By
combining a formyl-substituted monomer with a nitrile-functionalized precursor
like 1,4-phenylenediactonirtrile, Jiang and colleagues were able to create a sp2
carbon-conjugated framework (Jin et al. 2017). Yaghi’s team recently reported
the creation of a –C–C double bonded framework utilizing Aldol condensa￾tion of 2,4,6-trimethyl 1,3,5-triazine and 4,4’-biphenyldicarbaldehyde, which220 9 Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COF)

showed exceptional stability in Brønsted acid or base (Lyu et al. 2019) (refer to
Figure 9.2).
In addition to the commonly used connections in COF building, azodioxide-,
and hetero-linked frameworks were reported (Jackson et al. 2012; Beaudoin et al.
2013; Chen et al. 2015). Synthetic techniques such as solvothermal, ionothermal,
microwave, mechanochemical, interfaces, and room temperature enhance prop￾erties like surface area of synthesized frameworks and crystallinity. In addition to
the linkage used, these techniques are employed to construct the framework (Kuhn
et al. 2008; Campbell et al. 2009; Dogru et al. 2011).9.5 Pore Engineering 221
9.5.1 Pore Design
Porous material chemistry revert to the discoveries of complexeslike β-Co(4-methyl￾pyridine)4(NCS)2 and the first crystallographic coordination networks with
metal–neutral ligand coupling published in 1959, both of which were the work of
Nobel winner Alfred Werner (Werner 1893). In COFs, the reticular chemistry is
implemented from two perspectives: first, the support structure of the framework,
and second, the space that the structure takes up. The systematic pore network in
COFs facilitates the inclusion of numerous guest molecules under non-covalent
interaction; therefore, the geometrical structure of the building blocks is of utmost
importance to translate the shape and size selective entry of molecules. As Jiang’s
group demonstrated the connection between the pore structure and creating units
in a topological diagram, hexagonal, tetragonal, trigonal, and rhombic architectures
have been used extensively (Werner 1893). As per the reports, COF-6 has the
smallest pore (0.87 nm) (Côté et al. 2007) and PC-COF shows the largest pore
(5.8 nm) (Yu et al. 2016).
In addition to this, HHTP-DPB COF39 (4.7 nm) (Spitler et al. 2011), BTP-COF64
(4.0 nm) (Dogru et al. 2011), DTP-ANDI COF75 (5.3 nm) (Jin et al. 2013) have the
significant large pores synthesized so far. The Lavigne research team saw significant
reductions in surface area and pore size to 1.6, 1.4, and 1.1 nm, respectively, after
adding methyl, ethyl, and propyl functionalities to a framework with variable pore
size (Tilford et al. 2008).
This suggests that size of substituents (–Me, –Et, –Pr) has a direct relationship
with the decrease in pore size. Jiang and colleagues further emphasize the observed
reduction in pore size compared to pure frameworks and alkynyl-, alkenyl-,
and azide-decorated frameworks (Nagai et al. 2011). Using the D2h symmetric
4,4′
,4′′,4′′′-(ethane-1,1,2,2-tetrayl) tetraaniline building block, Zhao study group
also reported a dual pore and three different types of pores (ETTA). Yaghi, Wang,
and other research teams have also noted heterogeneous pore structure and
variations in pore shape with changes in building block concentration (Dalapati
et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2015).
9.5.2 Increasing the Vulnerability of the Active Sites
The functional groups in COFs occupy inner surfaces of the long-range ordered
porosities (see Figure 9.1f). The active sites present in those groups are buried deep
inside the 1D pore since there isstrong π-π interaction acting between the molecules.
This causes a decrease in rate performance and reactivity toward alkali metal ions.
Through pore engineering,the accessible exposure of active sitesisincreased thereby
increasing the efficiency of COF.
9.5.3 Pore Surface Engineering for Environmental Application
Porous frameworks play a crucial part in the fight against pollution because of
the adjustable pore size, extensive surface area, and by significantly increasing222 9 Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COF)
the adsorptive capacity, kinetics, and selectivity. The character and virtue of the
host molecules are crucial; for example, the tiny pore size of amorphous hosts
prevented the access to grafting groups, whereas the high pore size and other
crucial characteristics of COFs resulted in easy capturing of heavy metal ions. More
significantly, the COFs’ inclusion of binding groups that have been evenly dispersed
through pore surface engineering or de novo method places COFs at the forefront
of this problem.
Although various binding molecules have been shown to bind uranium,
amidoxime-adorned β-ketoenamine frameworks beat amorphous substances
in terms of affinities, kinetics, and absorption abilities (Sun et al. 2018). The
embellished framework was successful in lowering the water’s uranium content
(408 mg g−1) to 0.1 parts per billion, which issubstantially lowerthan the limitations
specified by the UEPA (Sun et al. 2018).
Hg (Mercury) is a significant metal that has an impact on public health. To rid
water of contamination, selective mercury collection is a pressing necessity. The
fluorescent LZU8 COF was made by condensing the 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and the
thioether-functionalized scaffold. The LZU8 COF was then uniformly and densely
decorated with thioether functionalities in a 1-dimensional porous channel for
greater affinity toward Hg ions. It also demonstrated a 300 mg g−1 uptake capacity,
a detection limit of 25 ppb, and high recyclability. Jiang research team generated
TAPB-BMTTPA-COF, which was designed to remove mercury from aqueous
solutions (Ding et al. 2016). The framework that functionalized using thioether
has been richly embellished with sulfur functionalities, resulting in an absorption
capacity of 734 mg g−1, almost two and a half times greater than LZU8 COF (Huang
et al. 2017a).
Qiu and co-developed two distinct 3D-ionic-COF-1 and 3D-ionic-COF-2 via
condensation of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl) CH4 with diiridium bromide and ethid￾ium bromide (Huang et al. 2017b). High levels of crystallinity, porosity, stability,
and the ability to remove permanganate specifically were all displayed by both
ionic frameworks. Signature materials like PVBTAH-ZIF-8 and LDHs are super￾seded by the measured kinetics with outstanding recyclability (Medina et al.
2015).
The Trabolsi research team initially reported a COF which was linked with
viologen with good stability, porosity, and controlled shape, by employing the
Zincke reaction (Das et al. 2017). In order to efficiently extract iodine from both
solutions and vapors, 1,1′
-bis(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-[4,4′
-bipyridine]-1,1′
-diium
dihydrochloride and 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene must be combined. The
5,6-bis(4-formylbenzyl)-1,3-dimethylbenzimidazolium bromide (BFBIm) is an
ionic building block with a BET surface area of 1532 m2 g−1 which was synthesized
by the Jiang research group via dynamic imine linkage of PyTTA (Huang et al.
2017a).
The reverse AA stacking mode’s decoration of benzimidazolium cations on each
end of the porous sites produced the best absorption capacity of negatively charged
methyl orange dye among various porous materials (553 mg g−1), expected to be a
result of the great electrostatic force of interactions (Huang et al. 2017b).9.8 Backbone Modifications 223
SA-COF was investigated as a size-dependent organic pollutant separation due to
the existence of well-organized pore channels and reversible proton tautomerism
(Ning et al. 2017). Size exceeds the host pore size, the framework’s ability to bind
a variety of dye molecules decreases with increasing molecular size and becomes
impassable. Notably, the type of dye and how sensitive it is to pH affect the pore
chemical environment and, thus, the selectivity of separation of charged molecules
(Xia et al. 2022).
9.6 Thermal Stability
As COFs are covalently bonded frameworks, their natural stability is much greater
than conventional polymers. This stability only increases when the strong aromatic
units and crystalline nature of COFs are taken into consideration making them ther￾mally stable up to 450 ∘C under an inert atmosphere (Song et al. 2014).
The strength of the chemical bonds determines its stability. Linkages are critical
to the framework’s stability. A stable link, however, limits the crystallinity of COF
formation, reducing its reversibility.
FrameworkslikeCS-COF andCTFs are exceptionally stable due to theirformation
of highly stable ring-fused phenazine and triazine units, respectively (Evans et al.
2021).
9.7 Advantages Over Conventional Polymers
For a relatively recent class of porous materials or materials in general, COFs have
proven to be outstanding alternatives to everything from catalysts to mitigating
pollutants. COFs are superior to conventional polymers as they are more mod￾ifiable compared to said polymers. Conventional polymers are mostly found in
amorphous conditions with partial crystalline nature. This relates directly to its
physico-chemical behavior in the bulk form of material. For applicationslike energy
harvesting, facile ionic/charge conduction, selective molecular separation material
needs to possess peculiar characteristics like ordered molecular arrangements with
tailored chemical struts having greater degree of flexibility in terms of pore size and
chemical functionality. Needless to say, conventional polymers have been of great
use in the scientific world as well as for daily life usage in the form of different tools
and appliances. However, with the advent of smart generation of porous materials,
COFs as an advanced class of polymers may serve better for chemically complex
and challenging problems.
9.8 Backbone Modifications
9.8.1 Linkage Conversion
Reversibility plays a vital role in obtaining COFs as it helps in error correction
and defect healing, in other words everything from the inherent properties (both224 9 Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COF)
physical and chemical) to the limitations of the COFs can be determined by just the
linkages.
This reversibility sometimes limits some inherent properties of the COFs like
crystallinity or even stability toward chemical solvents. For example, imine-based
COFs (C=N) which are the most well-studied COFs as they are highly stable
hydrothermally. Now although they are extremely stable, imine-based COFs can
still go through hydrolysis under an acid medium or even exchange with amines as
imines are reversible.
Yaghi and his colleagues came up with a technique to keep molecular cages made
of dynamic covalent bonds stable. The amide-linked COFs are created using this
method from the corresponding imine-COFs. The imine-based COFs were treated in
the presence of dioxane with sodium chlorite (eleven equivalents perimine function￾ality), CH3COOH (ten equivalents), & 2-methyl-but-2-ene (100 equivalents) (Waller
et al. 2016).
Asimine-basedCOFs undergo hydrolysis under acidic conditions, when subjected
to an acid the COF loses its crystallinity and almost if not completely dissolves.
Contrary to this, if the imine is converted into an amide linkage the COFs retains
its crystallinity even under a strong acidic medium. Thus, the COF obtained from
linkage conversion is more stable and shows great performance (Kandambeth et al.
2021).
9.8.2 Linker Changing
As mentioned above, dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is based on breaking and
making of covalent bonds within the same reaction under thermodynamic condi￾tions, i.e. a reversible chemicalreaction.It is crucial forthe production of COFssince
it facilitates COF formation by enabling self-correction which directly increases the
crystallinity of the COF. However, DCC is predominantly used in synthesis rather
than post-synthesis in COFs. Similarly, in metal–organic frameworks or MOFs the
method of linkage conversion has been used extensively to synthesize MOFs which
are generally harder to prepare.
It is possible that this linker modification process can also be used with COFs
because this reversible bond formation is analogous to both MOFs and COFs. Zhao
and his colleagues demonstrated how this dynamic character can facilitate the
exchange of COF linkers post-synthetically.
In order to show this, 2 distinct frameworks were synthesized and the subsequent
linker change was investigated. Firstly, for the synthesis [1,1′
:3′
,1′′-terphenyl]-3,3′′,
5,5′′-tetracarbaldehyde in which a core benzene and two aldehyde groups are intro￾duced to the ends.
Secondly, 1,4-diaminobenzene and benzidine were chosen as the linkers to
produce
TP-COF-DAB and TP-COF-BZ.
Let the DAB-based COFs be termed as(A) and the BZ-based COF be termed as(B).
[B] is more thermally stable and shows higher crystallinity in comparison
with [A].9.9 Functional Group Changes 225
In comparison with benzidine, 1,4-diaminobenzene is more active as it contains
amine group in the para position (electron-donating group). Upon understanding
this concept, Zhao and co-workers attempted to substitute benzidine units in [B]
with 1,4-diaminobenzene. Thus, this transformation increases the crystallinity of
[B] significantly.
9.9 Functional Group Changes
9.9.1 Inverse Vulcanization
Vulcanization is a process of heating rubber in presence ofsulfur, an accelerator and
an activator.
Pyun and co-workers developed a synthesis called inverse vulcanization primarily
to synthesize a polymer with high sulfur content to be used as cathode materials in
sulfur-based batteries like Li–S batteries (Simmonds et al. 2014; Chung et al. 2013).
These lithium batteries, according to analysis, have one of the finest performances
of any known COF-based sulfur cathodes, retaining 959 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at
0.2C while having an initial capacity of 1400 mA h g−1.
Sulfur loading and robust carbon-sulfur binding are made possible by this
method’s utilization of thermally driven radical polymerization between vinyl and
sulfur groups. Thus, Xu, Chen, and associates have recently trapped sulfur inside
the pores of the vinyl-functionalized COF-V utilizing the inverse vulcanization
approach. By grinding, elementalsulfur and COF-V are combined evenly during the
operation (Jiang et al. 2018). Molten sulfuris able to enterthe pores with subsequent
heat treatment at 155 ∘C while under vacuum in a sealed tube. In order to allow the
ring-opening polymerization of sulfur-8 and complete co-polymerization between
the poly-sulfur diradicals and vinyl groups, additional heat treatment at a greater
temperature of 200 ∘C is required.
9.9.2 Thiol-ene Rx
The thiol-ene reaction, as the name suggests, comprises addition of a thiol to C=C
under mild conditions. This method is especially useful in the field of coatings as
it supports greater spatial control which starts UV initiation and is insensitive to
oxygen.
In 2018, Ma and co-workers utilized this to post-synthetically modify COFs via
thiol-ene reaction to successfully remove mercury (Sun et al. 2017). The COF was a
vinyl-based COF which was synthesized by condensing 2,5 divinylterephthalalde￾hyde with 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl) benzene. In addition to this, thiol-ene reac￾tion was carried out with 1,2-ethanedithiol in the presence of azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN) as a radical indicator. This material shows incredible potential in environ￾mental remediation as mercury is extremely toxic and is one of the most prominent
industrial pollutants.
Dong and co. added thiol-functionalized polysiloxane to an allyl-decorated COF
that has previously supported Pd nanoparticles (Ma et al. 2020). An effective226 9 Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COF)
technique to create a self-standing and elastic membrane is through the interaction
between the allyl-decorated COF with Pd nanoparticles and the thiol-functionalized
polysiloxane. This membrane is consistently porous, strong, workable, homoge￾neous, and permeable to water. The dechlorination of chlorobenzene in water at
ambient temperature may also be catalyzed using it (Waller et al. 2016).
9.10 COFs on Different Scales
As already stated, a fascinating benefit of COFs in electrochemical purposes is that,
at least in theory, their structure and nanostructure are completely understood
and can be controlled with high accuracy, but there are still a few issues with the
microstructure that need to be resolved. It is challenging to transform the majority
of COFs into bulk electrodes or films since they are often found as bulk powders
that cannot be melted or dissolved.
The structural properties of COF materials on a macroscopic level, i.e. from a few
hundred angstrom to centimeters, should also be taken into consideration in COF
design in addition to a focus on microscopic length scales. The goal is to improve
the properties of COFs by combining their chemical as well as crystalline structures
with the ability to manufacture larger physical forms (thin films or coatings) with
specified sizes, carefully defined morphologies, and/or hybrid components.
9.11 Terracotta Process
Because COFs are polycrystalline, it is extremely challenging to convert COF pow￾ders into the necessary physical forms without utilizing a binder or plasticizer. In
recent times, a method known as the “terracotta process” has been used to shape
the COFs into distinct forms and create hierarchical porosity in the COF matrix.
Since the reagent mixture maintains the properties of the fabric, these COFs can
be processed into a variety of shapes without the addition of additives or binders,
enabling the construction of numerous COF sculptures. Using baking soda through￾out the initial phase of COF synthesis, a hierarchical porosity was added with a
network of interconnected pores to the COF matrix.
In recent times, a method known as the “terracotta process” has been used to
shape the COFs into distinct physical forms and create hierarchical porosity in the
COF matrix. Grinding diamine linkers with p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA), water,
and multitopic aldehydes, followed by brief heating, yielded significant amounts of
ketoenamine COFs with improved porosity (Karak et al. 2017).
9.12 Pyrolysis of COFs
Carbonaceous electrode materials have been made using a wide range of organic pre￾cursors. Such precursors must be cheap, accessible, and plentiful for use in practical9.13 COFs in Mitigation of Pollutants and Organic Dyes 227
applicationssince they can increase the surface areas of carbon compounds orintro￾duce heteroatomsinto them. Since COFs barely meet these latterrequirements, they
don’t seem to be the best precursors for carbon-based materials. However, there has
recently been an increase in interest in crystalline porous materials as carbon pre￾cursors, partly because of the notion that their crystalline structure, which contains
organized carbon sheets, may be a suitable area to direct the carbonization process
(Zhang et al. 2016a).
Since the framework frequently breaks when carbonized, the widely held belief
that the crystalline structure acts as a scaffold for the carbon elements is severely
damaged. For the synthesis of porous carbonaceous materials from COFs, tem￾plates are often required. COF-derived carbon compounds outperform similar
monomer-derived carbon compounds.
By simply carbonizing already-formed carbon-rich tubular and fiber-like
polyphenylene precursors under argon, Feng et al. were able to create 1-D C fibers
and tubes (Feng et al. 2009).
Improved electrodes constructed of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers with
areas up to nine hundred m2 g−1 were tested. Xiang et al. created a graphitic porous
carbon that was N-doped (Xiang et al. 2014) using 2D covalent organic polymer pre￾cursors, allowing for precise control over the heteroatom’s placement. These materi￾als demonstrated a strong relationship between the electrocatalytic activity and the
properties of N-doped carbon.
9.13 COFs in Mitigation of Pollutants and Organic Dyes
COFs can analyze and eliminate various industrial pollutants [(heavy metals
As, Cd, Cr, Cu etc.), radionuclides (UO2
2+ TcO4
−, Nd3+), organic waste (dyes,
pharmaceutical waste, organo-phosphorous retardants)].
Due to their porous structure, COFs are fantastic candidates for eliminating
dye molecules. Afshari and colleagues created a brand-new imine-linked COFA
as a highly effective sorbent for eliminating hazardous dye (Afshari and Dinari
2020).
Heavy metals are significant environmental contaminants, and their toxicity is a
concern that has grown in importance due to ecological, evolutionary, dietary, and
environmental factors. The heavy metals are found in wastewater, all of which are
hazardous to both human health and the environment. Toxic metals can cause a
variety of ailments, such as cancer, mutation, and allergies. It is necessary to get rid
of the organic contamination hydrazine, which is particularly dangerousforsoil and
water. Liang et al. developed redox-active COF to effectively recognize and eliminate
hydrazine (Liang et al. 2020). The prepared COF showed astounding crystallinity
and stability.
Cai et al. treated copper ions (Cu2+) by preparing a Q-graphene-scaffolded
COF which were used as adsorbents which showed a high ability to remove
Cu2+ ions (Cai et al. 2019). Further, a C3N4 component was integrated into
the COF backbone and the obtained COF can degrade dyes like methyl orange228 9 Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COF)
and organic compounds like phenol. The triazine moieties present in this COF
act as photoactive sites with the cyclic ketone constituents and the conjugated
structure acting as electron-withdrawing groups and electron-shift platform,
respectively.
Zhao et al. mechanochemically synthesized TpMA to produce COFs with thread
and ribbon-like morphology by further controlling the solvent and catalysts during
the preparation (Kumar et al. 2021). This ribbon-like COF shows much greater effi￾ciency when compared to its solvothermally synthesized counterparts.
9.14 COFs for Energy Applications
9.14.1 Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)
Among all renewable energy alternatives, hydrogen (H2) is one of the most promis￾ing. The most effective way to create high-purity H2 via HER is through water elec￾trolysis.
Adsorption, reduction, and desorption reactions are all involved in the multi-step
electrocatalytic HER process:
(H+ + e− → Hads)
(Hads + H+ + e− → H𝟐)
Or
(2Hads → H2).
At present, platinum (Pt) is regarded as the top HER catalyst for fuel cells but
due to scarcity and poor long-term stability COFs act as great catalysts (Hu et al.
2018).
9.14.2 Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)
OER is produced as a reaction at the anode during splitting and also during the
charging process of metal–air cells. The procedure can be carried out in either an
acidic or alkaline medium.
pH < 7: Acidic medium
2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−
pH > 7: Basic medium
4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−
Materials based on iridium (Ir) and ruthenium (Ru) are thought to be the
main catalysts for OER (Kumar et al. 2021), but their limited storage and poor
availability of these noble-metal based electrocatalysts hinder the commercial
use. As a result, COFs are a fantastic substitute for Ru/Ir-catalysts (Zhang et al.9.14 COFs for Energy Applications 229
2021). Since COFs can be precisely built with only desired components, they
offer a straightforward but effective method for analyzing the makeup of active
sites.
9.14.3 Oxygen reduction Reaction (ORR)
The reaction:
O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O
plays a crucial part in storage and conversion of energy, such as fuel cells and
metal–air batteries.
Continuously pumped into the cathode as the reactant to conduct ORR, oxygen
from the surrounding air’s oxygen content has a significant impact on the battery’s
voltage and energy density. Similarto HER, in fuel cells platinum isthe ideal catalyst
but due to scarcity and poor long-term stability carbon nanohybrids prepared by
pyrolysis act as a great replacement to Pt catalysts (Li et al. 2020b).
9.14.4 Bifunctional OER/ORR Catalysts
High activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) is displayed by bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.
Frameworks, which have ordered pores and high-precision functionaliza￾tion, have been used in electrochemical energy and conversion systems due to
their fast ion transport channels and precisely defined electrochemical active
sites.
Even though the development of active sites in COFs toward ORR and OER is
rarely studied, their electroactivities were hampered by the limited electron transit
along the frameworks (Zhang et al. 2020).
9.14.5 Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction (CO2RR)
The use of fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which could be dan￾gerousforthe world’s climate. Therefore, turning CO2 into a useful carbon feedstock
is a crucial objective for a sustainable economy.
CO2 can be transformed into a variety of compounds depending on the number
of migrating H+ and e−. Using electrocatalysis, CO2 can be transformed into com￾pounds of higher value, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and methanol (CH3OH), or
chemical energy can be converted into electricity (Hu et al. 2018).
Three fundamental stages for heterogeneous catalysis are:
1. Carbon dioxide is adsorbed on the sites that are active.
2. e− transfer or migration of protons in the carbon-oxygen bonds can be formed,
as well as carbon-hydrogen bonds.
3. Product formation by rearranging the configuration.230 9 Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COF)
A few obstacles remain to attain perfect conversion of CO2
- To produce CO2 – an immense overpotential is required, due to its high-energy
barrier
- Slow kinetics
- High cost.
Efficient electron transport is made possible by COFs having phthalocyanine (Pc)
centers in the framework.
The first cobalt-COFs were created by Gao et al. Due to the improved Co-Pc￾integration PBBAs of a storage function, the electrocatalytic reduction was con￾ducted in the CO2 gas phase, resulting in a nearly 100-fold increase in CO2
concentration above the typical aqueous phase (Wang et al. 2018a).
The ultra-large surface area and easy accessibility of modifying surface func￾tions by adding heteroatom doping are two features of the covalent triazine
frameworks. Later, Huang, Cao, and colleagues also developed copper nanopar￾ticles (Cu NPs) immobilized on the imidazolium-functionalized covalent triazine
framework (Cu/ICTF) to produce C2H4 in electrochemical CO2RR because
Cu-based catalysts have frequently been used to produce multiple electron trans￾fer C2
+ products with relatively high selectivity (Mao et al. 2020; Yusran et al.
2019).
9.15 COFs in Batteries and Supercapacitors
In order to address the unsustainable depletion of fossil fuels and the accompa￾nying energy problem, renewable energy sources, as well as ecologically benign
energy technology, are necessary. Such technologies include solar energy and new
electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. The main focus of energy
research has been the advancement of supporting infrastructure for converting
and storing energy that improves transfer of mass and e− mobility. COFs have
showcased great potential in energy-related industries such as supercapacitors and
batteries.
The sheet-like structure of anode materials allows ions to be accommodated
between layers depending on how they are introduced. The shorter paths for
diffusion of ions and greater accessibility active sites of nanosheets result in
better rate performance in battery electrodes and supercapacitors (Wang et al.
2021a).
Post-synthetic modification: COF synthesis with high electrical conductivity as
a first-stage is challenging. Post-synthetic alteration has made it possible to increase
the conductivity of COFs. To improve the electrical conductivity, new functional
groups or specific point alterations are made chemically following the synthesis of
COF. The original structural framework of the COF is maintained throughout this
process. That is, post-synthesis modification keepsthe structural integrity of the pore
surface while functional groups are added to or linked to it.9.16 Batteries 231
Yusran et al. functionalized azide-appended N3-COF-5 series into RTrz-COF-5
series through triazole bond. They also synthesized hydroxyl-decorated square-like
2D porphyrin COFs by functionalization via ester bond (Kim and Choi 2019). This
functionalization allowstheCOF to preserve itsrigid structure with a well-organized
functional group in the pores.
Surface doping: Another significant method for increasing conductivity is
surface-doping modification of COF crystals. Organic linkers that are more
adaptable and positively charged, and contain additional components can suc￾cessfully coordinate with coordination functional groups. By establishing a
continuous delocalized charge route, these organic linkers can improve energy
matching using ligand orbital overlap. Particularly, azo ligand-containing com￾pounds, which include nitrogen, have high electrical conductivity (Xia et al.
2022).
Bein and colleagues investigated the inherent conductivity of the two
Wurster-COFs that formed. Dopants included iodine, a chemical dopant commonly
used in COFs, antimony pentachloride (SbCl5), and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-tetracyano￾quinodimethane (Rotter et al. 2020).
In order to determine whether a comparable improvement in conductivity can
also be seen, WTA was also doped along with F4TCNQ in bulk. In this instance, the
doping increased the conductivity [4.91*10−6 Sm−1 to 1.51*10−5 Sm−1] (Sugawara
et al. 2022).
9.16 Batteries
The majority of the world’s energy needs are still being met by conventional energy
sources, whose extensive use raises a number of environmental concerns. Security
in the environment and rising energy uses have been two of the biggest problemsfor
human civilization. Since the last few decades, non-conventional energy sources,
such as sun, wind, and sea tides, have been investigated for sustainable develop￾ment. The intermittent nature of these renewable resources, however, limits their
immediate use.
Scientists worldwide are attempting to create systems that effectively contain
the power generated by renewable resources. When compared to conventional
charge storage technologies, rechargeable metal ion batteries (MIBs) have improved
redox reactivity, increased safety, and continuing device sustainability (Figure 9.3).
Among these MIBs, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are one of the most advanced and
well-explored energy storage technologies. In addition to LIBs, numerous battery
types, including Li–S batteries, sodium-ion (SIBs), are being studied for improved
futures.
The four major components of a battery system are the electrolyte, cathode,
anode, and separator. Which of these materials is employed to transmit charge
carriers as electrodes or other electrode-like structures will determine the storage
device’s capacity values. In most situations, the active species is a single-phase sub￾stance or a composite material that directly alters electrodes. In batteries, between232 9 Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COF)

the cathode and the anode, a porous membrane serves as a separator to insulate
the electrons while permitting ions to pass through, preventing short circuits. High
ionic conductivity liquid or solid electrolytes are used in conjunction to improve ion
transfer.
Because COFs are rectifying devices, rechargeable metal-COF batteries have
been studied. The ability of COFs metal batteries to behave as electrodes depends9.16 Batteries 233
on their reversible redox-active behavior in a charged state. Currently, liquid
electrolytes pose safety issues, whereas solid electrolytes have restricted ion
conductivity. The requirement for matching the supply and releasing energy
whenever and wherever it is needed still cannot be satisfied by the capacity,
rate performance, and lifetime of electrode materials. COFs are highly porous
crystalline polymers that have a high ion storage capacity and can metrically
change their inner surfaces with redox-active sites. Therefore, COFs could be
utilized as battery electrode materials. COFs are also a preferred alternative in solid
electrolytes and separators because of their open channels and electrical insulating
properties.
9.16.1 COFs as Electrode Materials
(a) Carbonyl-containing electrode materials: As a sodium-ion battery anode, a novel
vinyl polymer was developed and tested. It has a good electrochemical perfor￾mance and terphenyl side chains. There was a significant improvement in elec￾trochemical performance when compared to the vinyl polymer with disodium
terephthalate. The discharge potential, in particular, dropped by roughly 0.12 to
0.27V (vs. Na/Na+).
(b) Nitrogen-containing electrode materials: As a carbon-based electrode for Na-ion
batteries, Kaskel’s team discovered microporous (14 angstroms) bipolar frame￾works having dynamic tri-azine rings and dormant benzene rings in the skele￾tons.
(c) Lithium-sulfur batteries: Wang and colleagues employed tetraaminoben￾zenequinone (TABQ) and dimethyl benzene anhydride (PMDA), two different
types of active small molecules, to develop a COF. They then used the graphene
solvent hot approach to in situ synthesize poly(imide benzoquinone) (PIBN),
a two-dimensional microporous structure with an organic skeleton. As a
result, PIBN-G exhibits excellent amplification and high reversibility in the
electrochemical reaction (Chen et al. 2021).
9.16.2 Battery Additives and Functional Separators
A number of lithium-ion battery substitutes have been developed as a response of
the limited supply and growing demand for Li capitals. The issue is slow intercala￾tions of big ions (such as Na+, K+, or anions), which leads to poor capacity, confined
cyclability, and primarily performance loss at a rapid rate when the majority of the
material is utilized as electrodes. The COF is known as polypyrene sulfide (PPYS),
and its use in the negative-ion storage was initially described by Wang et al. (2011).
The novel theory also suggests that anions may be more easily transported by the
electropositive COFs because of their potential to adsorb anions through electro￾static attractions.
This unique method acts as a proof-of-concept for PPYS cathodes by enhancing
the intercalation kinetics of larger anions. Small amounts of COFs are added to234 9 Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COF)
PPYS, significantly improving its capacity, rate capability, and cyclability (Yusran
et al. 2020). Because of its electron-rich structure, the PPYS repeating unit can
lose electrons, resulting in stable +1 charged states and the beginning of anions
storage. To study the potential use of PPYS in anions storage, a half-cell is con￾structed with PPYS cathodes and Li metal as the counter electrode (Xia et al.
2022).
9.17 Supercapacitors
Rapid advancements in the electronic industries in recent years have increased
the need for energy storage materials. The usage of coal, oil, natural gas, and
other non-renewable resources seriously damages the environment, making the
creation of new green energy storage technologies essential. Due to their excellent
qualities of high charging and discharging effectiveness, extended cyclic life, and
environmental friendliness, supercapacitors, as an electrochemical energy storage
unit, aid a wide range of application possibilities in pocket-sized electronics, hybrid
cars, etc.
Porous structural frameworks frequently have large area, which enhances the
capability of the supercapacitor devices by speeding the movement of charge
possessing ions in the electrolytes. Excellent supercapacitor performance and
lengthy cycle lifetimes are provided by the crystalline porous MOF and COF
structures. Additionally, their pore diameters are easily visible. As opposed to
MOFs, which are made completely of heavy metallic components bound together
by unstable covalent bonds, COFs showcase more stability and are not that
heavy.
By possessing a discrete 1D channel that is aligned perpendicularly and an eclipsed
layer stacking pattern, the typical 2D COF configuration resembles the structural
core of graphene. Effective mass transfer and ion or charge mobility are made possi￾ble by this COF structural feature in an aligned diffusion tube. The development of
EDLC (electric double-layer capacitors) electrode systems makes high surface area
2D COFs among the best materials for electrochemical energy storage applications.
The samples below contrast modern COF supercapacitor capabilities. The molecu￾lar structure of COFs, including its shape, porosity, and so on, has a considerable
impact on the efficiency and performance of supercapacitors (Kandambeth et al.
2021).
The effect of redox sites on the electrical and chemical functions of 2-dimensional
COFs, a possible material for pseudo capacitors, has made substantial development
in recentstudy. Nitrogen atoms have a significant impact on the transmission rate of
e− via the electrode material by increasing the electroactive surface area and mak￾ing the system more wettable. By exfoliating a succession of three 2-dimensional
mesoporousframeworks while maintaining the parent COFs’ pore size, Yusran et al.
demonstrated the impact of thin-layered 2D structure on electrochemical perfor￾mance (Wei et al. 2018).9.18 Electrochemical Sensors 235
Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) based on COFs materials may hold promise
for next-generation miniaturized electronics by temporarily supplying the
necessary power and energy. Flexible integrated assemblies can achieve sig￾nificantly higher power densities in a smaller volume, which is usually
sufficient for their purposes. Xu et al. used SWCNTs (single-walled carbon
nanotubes) and a nanofibrous COF to create a flexible thin-film electrode for
micro-supercapacitors (MSC) (An et al. 2021). The MSC, which is COF-based,
provided an astonishing viewpoint on the growth of wearable & portable electronic
systems.
Because they are stable and have porous properties that can be depended upon
to provide COFs a high capacitance, SCs have a lot of potential for COFs. Despite
the advances, it should be emphasized that COFs have a very low capacitance. Their
entire organic makeup is to blame for this, which also affects their poor conduc￾tivity and slow charge transfer rate. Additionally, the bulk of electrode materials
are currently made using COF powders, which has limited potential (Chen et al.
2020).
9.18 Electrochemical Sensors
Electrochemical sensors have garnered a lot of interest in the study of species
with biological, environmental, and industrial importance. A working electrode,
a counter electrode, and an electrolyte are generally used in electrochemical
sensors. By observing how the working electrode interacts with the analytes,
electric signals corresponding to the analyte concentrations can be determined.
Only a small number of COFs have been used as electrochemical sensors, in
contrast to their application in electrocatalysis and energy storage. COFs may
be thought of as the optimal platform for adsorption/separation, detection, and
sensing due to their low density and high surface areas. Furthermore, COFs’
modular construction allows for the independent modification of both their pore
topologies and functional groups. This enables the incorporation of electroactive
sites and groups with the capacity to bind and detect particular species into COF
channels.
Dynamic covalent chemistry is used to achieve periodicity in COF structures.
When substantial crystallinity is observed in COFs, the newly generated covalent
bonds are always guaranteed to be reversible. The bonds are logically implied to be
easily reopenable by this, which is bad for stability (Zhao et al. 2021).
Generally, COFs are used to detect harmful organic compounds like hydrazine,
catechol, nitrophenol, and hydroquinone (Liang et al. 2020). Further, metals like
lead mercury also pose a threat to the environment as harms of elevated lead
levels in the environment range from lower yield in crops to permanent damage
to the neuro- and cardiovascular system. TAPB-DMTP-COF was synthesized by
Kumar et al. (2021). The above COF acts as an excellent tool to remove lead by
deposition.236 9 Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COF)
Mercury (Hg) can affect cell function and proliferation by interfering with inter￾nal metabolic processes, which may also result in cell necrosis. Hg2+ is capable of
making stable covalent bonds with functional groups containing elements such as
oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Because of its potent soft–soft interaction, mercury has a
strong attraction forsulfur compounds. As a result, COFs andCOF-based substances
with high levels of O, N, or S have a positive impact on the detection and adsorption
of Hg (Cukierman 2006).
9.19 Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC)
The only ion without its own electron shell is the proton. As a result, it has a consid￾erable interaction with the environment’s electron density. Proton-exchange mem￾brane’s crucial characteristic, proton conductivity, has a direct impact on how well a
fuel cell functions. On the basis of the observed resistance, it is possible to determine
the proton conductivity [ohm, cm−1] according to
𝜎 = l∕A.1∕R
where l is the electrode distance (in cm), R is the membrane resistance, A is the
membrane’s cross-sectional area (cm2).
The discovery of protonic species dates back to 1806 (J.T. Von Grotthuss) (Litster
and McLean 2004). In 1877, Bjerrum and Eigen worked on the proton conduction
of ice; however, neither pure nor doped water was found to be a good conductor of
protons (Cukierman 2006).
91 years later, in 1968 Nafion – A perflourinated sulfonated polymer was devel￾oped by Du Pont (Das et al. 2022). Nafion displayed high proton conductivity
(10−1–10−2 S cm−1) while being extremely stable physically as well as chemically.
Although Nafion displayed excellent properties, its commercial use was limited due
to two major flaws:
9.19.1 Low-Temperature Conductivity
When the temperature exceeds 100 ∘C, conductivity rapidly drops as a result of the
membrane’s loss of the adsorbed water molecule.
9.19.2 Degradation
COFs overcome the poor hydrolytic stability and lesser tolerance to acidic guest
doping of other porous materials which have been exploited in the field of proton
conductivity throughout the years at higher operating temperatures.
9.20 Conclusion
Due to their many useful characteristics, such as high crystallinity, low density,
tuneable porosity, wide surface area, and distinctive molecular architecture,References 237
the developing organic crystalline porous polymer materials called covalent
organic frameworks (COFs) have been receiving more attention. Solvother￾mal condensation is a common method for creating COFs since it results in
the formation of covalent bonds between lighter atoms including C, N, H, O,
and B. COFs can be either 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional COFs, depending
on the combination of the units and the type of weak interactions that result.
Energy generation, energy storage, and pollution detection are just a few of
the diverse applications of COFs. Through pore engineering, in which the pore
surface is created by various linkages, such as B–O, C–N, and C–C linkages and
functional groups, the structural and functional characteristics of COFs can be
changed.
Metal atoms can also be added into them in order to improve the backbone
properties. COFs play a vital role in environmental application by the mitigation
of dyes and heavy metals. COFs like LZU8, TAPB-BMTTPA were developed
through pore surface engineering to show high selectivity toward mercury. A
Q-graphene-scaffold-COF was used as Cu2+ absorbent. COFs like imine-linked
COFA are a highly efficient sorbent for hazardous dye elimination.
COFs have increased thermal stability compared to conventional polymers
because of the strength of chemical bonds and linkages. In the energy pro￾duction reactions like HER, OER, ORR, bifunctional OER/ORR and CO2RR,
COFs can act as good catalysts replacing the metals like Pt, Ir, and Ru. COFs
are also an environment-friendly energy storage source used in batteries and
supercapacitors after post-synthetic modification and surface doping. High surface
area 2D COFs are the best for electrochemical energy storage applications like
EDLC. They show high conductivity and excellent storage capacity, and thus
“rechargeable metal-COF batteries” are a topic of interest for researchers across the
globe.
In conclusion, unlike other crystalline porous materials, COFs are the promising
reticular chemistry area for energy and environmental applications.

A Multifunctional Polymer – POLYOX – and Its Uses as a
Novel Drug-Delivery System

10.1 Introduction
Oral dosage forms have historically been the most common and widely used kind
of formulation. The majority of traditional oral pharmaceutical preparations, also
known as instant-release preparations, are designed to start releasing the active
ingredient as soon as the tablet or capsule is taken. This includes both tablets and
capsules. When typical drug preparations are made, the pace at which the medica￾tion is released into the body is not particularly adjusted. With immediate-release
medications, the onset of the pharmacodynamic effects and the absorption of the
medication often occur quite rapidly. It is possible that the pharmacodynamic
effect will be delayed as a result of the conversion of prodrugs in traditional
oral preparations to the active treatment. This conversion might take place via
hepatic or intestinal metabolism or chemical hydrolysis. In contrast, the absorption
of medication from traditional oral formulations that contain poorly soluble
medicines (lipid-loving medicines) may be prolonged due to steady dissolution in
or selected absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in a similarly
late inception time. This is because these formulations contain poorly soluble
medications. In the pharmaceutical industry, medications with modified release
are referred to by a number of names depending on their specific formulation.
The pharmaceutical business is always developing fresh and cutting-edge methods
of drug administration in order to modify the drug’s release profile. This has a
one-of-a-kind influence not only on the pharmacodynamic effect but also on the
plasma drug conc vs time profile. The use of modified-release dosage forms rather
than regular ones has a variety of advantages, including the following:
● Blood levels are less likely to vary when the rate of release is regulated, and peaks
and troughs in blood levels are minimized when this is done.
● A reduction in the number of times daily that the drug has to be taken, which,
given that extended-release medications typically include more than one serving,
increased both convenience and adherence.

● Lessening of negative side effects.
● A general reduction in the expense of receiving medical care.
Polymers having a range of molecular weights are put to use in the process of mod￾ifying the release of drugsin dosage form. The utilization of polymers hasresulted in
the development of dosage forms that exhibit particular qualities. In the beginning,
polymers were utilized for the purpose of solubilizing, stabilizing, and providing
mechanicalsupport for drugsin order to achieve a delayed release. However, during
the course of time, the functionalities of polymers have progressed. Polymers were
manufactured by synthetic processes in order to fulfil specific prerequisites or, to be
more specific, to provide solutions to specific challenges that were associated with
the production of drug-delivery systems. The first and most important parameters
to consider are the source, kind of polymerization, chain growth polymerization,
and degradability of the material. The method in which water and other polymers
interact with one another. Numerous sectors, including those dealing with food and
medicine, varnishes, clothes, paper, construction, gums, coating material, and water
treatment, make extensive use of polymers that are soluble in water.
POLYOX, one of the types of polymers, is swiftly becoming more well known for
its capacity to gently release medications over a long period of time. As a direct con￾sequence of this, the presentresearch provides a comprehensive analysis of POLYOX
as a polymer for modifying drug release. It all depends on how a polymer and water
interact with one another. Polyethylene oxide (PEO) is an example of a water-loving
polymer. It is a homopolymer of ethylene oxide that does not include any ions. It’s
also known as POLYOX in some circles.
POLYOX, sometimes referred to simply as poly, is a water-soluble resin (ethylene
oxide). They are crystalline powders that are hydrophilic, white, and free-flowing.
The typical particle size of these powdersis around 150 mm, and they are available in
a wide variety of molecular weight gradesranging from 100,000 to 80,000. PEO is uti￾lized for usage in the matrix materials. Because of the use of high-molecular-weight
PEO, the dissolution of drugs that were both liquid and insoluble was successfully
prevented in matrix tablets that were created by the use of direct compression. In
addition to this, it acts as a polymer that is mucoadhesive. POLYOX water-soluble
resins can be utilized in a variety of different applications, including pharmaceutical
products, coating materials, TDDS, rapid-release dosage forms, and gastro-retentive
dosage forms (Chandel & Kapoor 2013; Shah et al. 2014). They are capable of
producing films and retaining water in their cells. In addition to being non-toxic, it
has a high solubility in water (Kojima et al. 2008). POLYOX resins have the ability
to create related compounds with a number of different substances, including
polystyrene, poly-caprolactone, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polylactides.
These related compounds can then result in distinctive blends and a variety of other
useful formulation characteristics. Typical skeletal (–O–CH2–CH2–)nOH. They
share the same chemical structure as PEG, although having molecular weights that
are far higher. The usual number of oxyethylene groups is denoted by the letter n
(British National Formulary 2009). The structure of the ethylene oxide monomer is
that of an epoxide ring.10.3 Physical and Chemical Constituents 245
POLYOX is made as NF and other official-grade compounds, and it is also available
in a variety of molecular weight classes. The different grades of POLYOXare given as:
10.1.1 Grades of POLYOX
POLYOX(tm) Water-Soluble Resin NF Products are WSR N, WSR N-80, WSR N-205,
WSR-301, WSR-303, WSR N-750, WSR N-1105, WSR N-12K, WSR N-60K, and WSR
Coagulant.
10.2 Advantages of Using POLYOX
Additionally, POLYOX has the following benefits to offer:
● The ability to formulate in a variety of ways is made possible by the presence of a
broad molecular weight range.
● Versatility in applications including granulation and direct compression.
● Quick hydration and swelling, essential for the development of osmotic pump
technology.
● Efficient generation of gel and hydration for use in applications involving
hydrophilic matrices.
● In terms of bio adhesion, POLYOX films fared better than HPC films. This is due
to the fact that POLYOX hydrates more quickly, absorbs a lot of water, and swells
better than HPC does.
● POLYOX can be used in place of HPMC asthe binding agent when direct compres￾sion is used. Under circumstances of testing that were both acidic and neutral, the
swelling ratio of PEO was almost double as high as that of HPMC.
● PEO hydrogels’ swelling behavior is pH independent. Despite the fact that Car￾bopol displays pH-dependent bioadhesion and swelling behavior.
● POLYOX has evolved into a reliable polymer that can be used for bio-adhesion in
the GIT.
● Meets the needs of both the United States Food Chemicals Codex and the USP.
10.3 Physical and Chemical Constituents
POLYOX has a high binding efficiency for powders, giving it the name “high bind￾ing efficient.” The capacity to cross-link POLYOX may result in the formation of
extremely water-retentive gels when used in the process of cross-linking.
POLYOX releases a substantial quantity of lubricity into the system when it
comes into contact with water. At various temperatures, POLYOX easily solubilizes
and will become thick in a wide range of solvents which are organic, including
halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, and esters. Due to this
quality, POLYOX may be employed in a variety of applications. In general glycols,
diols, aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, and aliphatic ethers are insoluble in POLYOX.246 10 A Multifunctional Polymer – POLYOX – and Its Uses as a Novel Drug-Delivery System
Thermoplasticity: It allows POLYOX to be easily extruded, injection molded, or cast
despite its status as a thermoplastic. This material is capable of being heat-sealed
into sheets and films, and it can also be orientated to create high levels ofstrength.
Films naturally possess the characteristics of being flexible, durable, and imper￾vious to the majority of oils and greases. These resins may be used in conjunction
with a wide variety of polymers, both natural and manufactured.
Wet tack: POLYOX have a high degree of wet tack and are thus suitable as wet adhe￾sives due to this property. The residue, after it has dried, does not have a sticky
texture. Reduced resistance to forward motion is achieved by very low quantities
of heavier molecules. POLYOX may cut down on the turbulent frictional drag of
the water by as much as 80% when it is dissolved in the water.
Viscosity: The viscosity of the solution quickly rises when the concentration of polyol
water-soluble resin is raised. A POLYOX solution will have a pH between 8 and
10. At pH levels ranging from neutral to slightly alkaline, POLYOX solutions will
exhibit the greatest degree of stability. When the pH is higher than 12, POLYOX
resins will begin to precipitate. As ethers are susceptible to acidic hydrolysis, the
polymer will deteriorate when the pH falls below 2. Viscoelasticity is produced
in solutions when the adaptability of ether bonds is paired with the extraordinar￾ily large molecular weight of POLYOX, which results in the molecules having an
elastic behavior.
Glass transition temperature: For the class of products manufactured from
poly(ethylene oxide), the glass transition temperature (Tg) ranges from −50 to
−57 ∘C. In the context of this class of products, the molecular weight has little
bearing on the Tg.
10.3.1 Pharmaceutical Property
Very quick hydration and the production of gels: POLYOX are the most water-soluble
polymers that are utilized in pharmaceutical formulationsthat hydrate the quick￾est and form gelsthe quickest. They produce hydrogels very fast, which begin and
control the release of active chemicals.
Emollient: The application of POLYOX to the skin and hair results in a feeling that is
both smooth and velvety. Both thermoplastic processing and casting procedures
may be used in order to shape POLYOX into flexible films. These films can then
be used for a variety of applications.
Flocculent activity: Increased molecular weight types of POLYOX are able to effi￾ciently adsorb onto a wide variety of colloidal materials and function as potent
flocculating agents.
POLYOX are non-ionic and entirely aqueous soluble at all types of temperatures.
They are also exceptionally efficient agents which can make other substances
dense in both fresh and salty water. Water-soluble solutions are pseudo plastic. The
flowability characteristics of the various grades of POLYOX are comparable to one
another. POLYOX has a small amount of silica (about 1.5%), which contributes to its
flowability. POLYOX is an excellent option for formulations requiring timed release
due to its exceptionalswelling capabilities, which, when combined with its carefully10.3 Physical and Chemical Constituents 247
regulated rate of dissolution, make it a perfect alternative. POLYOX may be used to
extrude components for devices that give a timed release of a variety of substances,
including fragrance, colors, surfactants, and reagents, among other things.
Concernsrelating to the risks: POLYOX demonstratesjust the lowest possible order of
toxicity in animal experiments, and this isthe case regardless of the route of expo￾sure. When administered orally, the maximum safe dose is equivalent to about
2 g kg−1 of body weight. These gums do not irritate the skin in any way, nor do
they sensitize the skin, and neither the dry powder nor the aqueous solutions of
these resins cause irritation to the eyes.
Non-hazardous and biodegradable nature: POLYOX products are non-hazardous
and have been granted FDA certification for a variety of uses in the food and
medicine industries. Due to oxidation and aerobic biodegradation, aqueous
solutions of POLYOX are capable of being degraded in the natural environment.
Casting, extrusion, injection molding, and blown film are some of the techniques
that work especially well with POLYOX because of the numerous exceptional
qualities that it has.
10.3.2 Characteristics
Both Physical and Chemical High efficacy in binding: POLYOX has a high level of
effectiveness when it comes to binding to powders. Capability to form crosslinks
POLYOX possesses the capability to form crosslinks, which enables it to form very
water-storing gels. POLYOX bestows a high power of lubricity upon itssurroundings
when it comes in close contact with water.
Organic solvent solubility and thickening: POLYOX are easily soluble in a wide range
of organic solvents, including aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, halogenated
hydrocarbons, ketones, and esters, at a variety of temperatures. Additionally,
POLYOX may thicken in organic solvents. POLYOX is not made soluble by
aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, glycols, or aliphatic ethers in most cases.
Thermoplasticity is the property that allows POLYOX to be readily extruded,
injection molded, or cast as a material. This material is available in the form of
sheets and films, and it may both be heat-sealed and oriented in order to achieve
high levels ofstrength. Films, by their very nature, are extremely durable, flexible,
and resistant to the vast majority of oils. These resins are unanimous with a good
range of chemical and natural polymers, and they perform very well with them.
POLYOX is a kind of adhesive that is particularly useful for wet applications
because of the high wet tack qualities it possesses. Stickiness is not seen in the
dried residue. Low concentrations of molecules with a higher-molecular weight
help to minimize friction. POLYOX, when dissolved in water, has the potential to
lessen the turbulent frictional drag of the water by up to 80%.
Viscosity: The amount of POLYOX aqueous-soluble resin in the solution has a direct
correlation to the rate at which the solution’s viscosity increases. A solution
of POLYOX has a pH that ranges between 8 and 10. The most effective and
long-lasting POLYOX solutions will have a pH that falls anywhere between248 10 A Multifunctional Polymer – POLYOX – and Its Uses as a Novel Drug-Delivery System
neutral and slightly alkaline. When the pH is greater than 12, POLYOX resins
will begin to precipitate out. Since ethers hydrolyze into an acidic form when
exposed to pH 2, the polymer will degrade at that value.
Viscoelasticity is achieved in solutions by combining the extremely high-molecular
weight of POLYOX with the flexibility of ether bonds, which results in the for￾mation of solutions that exhibit elastic behavior. The glass transition tempera￾ture (Tg) for the poly(ethylene oxide) product family ranges from −50 to −57 ∘C.
The molecular will not matter to the Tg across the board for this class of goods.
Pharmaceutical Qualitative Extremely Rapid Hydration and the Formation of a
Gel: Polymers that are water-soluble and used in pharmaceutical systems, like
POLYOX, have one of the fastest hydration rates. This is one of its advantages.
They quickly produce hydrogels, which can both initiate and regulate the release
of active compounds. After usage, POLYOX makes both the skin and the hair feel
silkier and smoother. It is an emollient. POLYOX may be treated with thermo￾plastics or cast to generate flexible films, making it an ideal ingredient for use in
film formers. Varieties of POLYOX with a high-molecular weight perform very
well as flocculating agents because they adhere to a wide range of colloidal sub￾stances in an effective manner. Thickening capability (aqueous) – POLYOX are
particularly effective thickening agents in both fresh and salty water since they
are nonionic, completely soluble in water, and soluble at all temperatures. This
makes them ideal for use in thickening aqueous solutions. Pseudoplastic aqueous
solutions (i.e., shear thinning). In terms of flow properties, there is not much of a
difference between the various grades of POLYOX.
POLYOX has a little amount of silica (1.5%), which helps the material flow more
easily. POLYOX’s unique swelling capabilities and sustained rate of dissolution
make it a perfect component for time-release formulations. This property makes
POLYOX the ideal element for time-release formulations. Extrusion techniques
can be employed with POLYOX to create devicesthat, over time, gradually release
a scent, color, surfactant, reagents, etc. Concerns about the safety POLYOX has
been shown to have poor levels of toxicity in animal studies, regardless of the
method of exposure. At oral dosages of around 2 g kg−1 of body weight, which is
the maximum amount that may be safely administered by mouth. The usage of
these resins in any form, including dry powder, aqueous solutions, skin irritants,
or sensitizers, does not result in eye discomfort under any circumstances. In addi￾tion to being safe and biodegradable, the FDA has given its blessing for the use
of POLYOX in many types of applications including food and medicine. Aqueous
solutions of POLYOX are ecologically biodegradable because they may be broken
down by oxidation and aerobic biodegradation. As a result of their extensive range
of distinguishing characteristics, POLYOX is ideally suited for a variety of manu￾facturing processes, including casting, extrusion, injection molding, and blown
film production.
Below shows the various physical features of POLYOX.
● Having the look of powdery off-white.
● Crystals will begin to melt between 62 and 67 ∘C.10.4 Release Mechanism 249
● A whiff of nitrate can be detected in the odor.
● 1.0% by weight of volatile substances (at 105 ∘C).
● One point 1% by weight of alkaline earth metals.
● 19–37 pounds per cubic foot is the bulk density of powder.
● 1% moisture content.
● Fusion heat – 33 calories per gram.
● Alternate forms of pH 8–10.
10.4 Release Mechanism
The POLYOX component is evenly distributed over the whole tablet. It hydrates
and creates a gel coating on the exterior tablet surface when it comes into con￾tact with water. The rate at which the active ingredient diffuses out of the gel
layer and the rate at which the tablet is eroded both control the rate at which
the active ingredient is distributed and the total dissolving rate. The molecular
weight (MW) of the POLYOX employed in the formulation should be taken into
account in order to achieve the correct release profile. In comparison to higher MW
grades, lower-molecular-weight polymers often have a faster rate of release. The
percentage of POLYOX in the pill should range from 20% to 90% in order to have
a predictable and repeatable release profile. The drug release from high-molecular
weight POLYOX tablets is controlled by swelling rather than by the breakdown
of the polymer, which leads to abnormal release kinetics. The key mechanism
controlling the release of drugs from low-molecular-weight POLYOX, however, is
the swelling and erosion of the polymer, which encourages front synchronization
and a consistent release rate. It has been demonstrated that the amount of medicine
released from low-molecular-weight POLYOX tablets is unaffected by the drug’s
solubility or drug loading. There is no relationship between the molecular weight
of POLYOX and the dissolving medium’s pH or between the speed of stirring and
the release of the medication. In drug-delivery systems that have been described
for oral, mucosal, and transdermal administration, POLYOX has also been used
as a component or carrier. Pharmaceutical Industry Application Areas POLYOX
has previously achieved success with osmotic pump technologies, hydrophilic
matrices, gastro-retentive dosage forms, and other drug-delivery systems such as
transdermal and mucoadhesive technologies for sustained-release applications.
Additionally, POLYOX has utilized transdermal and muco-adhesive technology.
Currently, POLYOX is a popularly utilized, efficient component in the creation of
instant-release dosage forms, such as films. Drug dosage formulations known as
controlled-release drug-delivery systems are designed to release an active compo￾nent at rates that are much slower than those of their comparable conventional
dose forms. From a few milligrams to several hundred milligrams per hour, these
speeds are possible. The purpose of the controlled release drug-delivery systems is
to regulate the pace of drug administration, increase the therapeutic effect, and/or
target drug delivery to a specific tissue. There are several approaches to achieve
these aims Chowdary et al. (2009). High-molecular-weight linear PEO, or POLYOX,250 10 A Multifunctional Polymer – POLYOX – and Its Uses as a Novel Drug-Delivery System
has been demonstrated to have a large amount of potential and is employed in
controlled drug-delivery systems. The manufacture of matrix tablets based on
POLYOX is a relatively simple procedure because of the remarkable compressibility
of this polymer Yang et al. (1996). If POLYOX’s polyether chains come into contact
with water or stomach secretions, they may generate strong hydrogen bonds with
it. This causes POLYOX to quickly hydrate and expand, creating hydrogels with
properties that make them perfect for controlled drug-delivery systems. As a result,
different release patterns may be achieved depending on the molecular weight
of POLYOX and the drug’s physicochemical characteristics. Maggi et al. (2000)
developed hydrophilic matrix tablets using POLYOXWSRN 1105 (MW = 0.9106)
and POLYOXWSRN 301 (MW = 4106), two distinct PEOs with two different
molecular weights. A controlled release was established by doing this. The results
indicate that the higher-molecular-weight PEO develops more quickly than the
lower-molecular-weight PEO. The different degrees of success that the two poly￾meric products have had in controlling the delivery rate of the medicine that is
water-soluble may be due to these differences in erosion behavior. The medication
mebeverine hydrochloride was created as a sustained-release tablet Deshkar et al.
(2013). By mixing the necessary excipients with Methocel K15M, K100M, and
POLYOX WSR 303 at concentrations of about 11%, 21%, 31%, and 41% of the tablet
weight, respectively. The tablet was then compressed using a method known as
direct compression. Drug release may be postponed for up to 12 hours by Methocel
K15M formulations (20% w/w), Methocel K100M formulations (10% w/w), and
PEO-303 formulations (20% w/w). Verapamil-hydrochloride-containing controlled￾release matrix tablets were created by Vidhyadhara et al. (2013) by the use of
POLYOXWSR 303 and the direct compression method. The rate of drug release
was seen to decrease as the amount of polymeric material in the matrix increased.
The extended release of verapamil hydrochloride from matrix tablets was able to
maintain the therapeutic action for up to 24 hours, according to the results of an in
vivo pharmacokinetic trial. POLYOX is a binder that is used in direct compression
tablet-binding processes. They usually exhibit improved flow and compaction
properties in comparison to other binders, and the lubricity they provide facili￾tates the tableting process. Because of their large molecular weight, pills release
verapamil hydrochloride slowly. Dimitrov and associates investigated POLYOX
Dimitrov & Lambov (1999). The quantity of PEO detected in molecules controls
how quickly the drug is released, which happens through a mechanism known as
controlled diffusion. In all alkali mediums, PEO releases comparatively completely
when hydrophilic polymers (Eudragit L, Eudisperthv, and Carbopol 934) with
pH-dependent solubility (at concentrations ranging from 10% to 50%) are added.
A relaxation-controlled diffusion on the matrix takes the role of a normal aberrant
diffusion at lower drug doses. A study was conducted to examine the drug release
from compressed tablets made from a powdered combination of the medication
POLYOX and magnesium stearate by Kim et al. (1995). The anomalous release
kinetics of the medication from high-molecular-weight PEO tablets (MW = 2106
and 4106) are regulated by swelling of the polymer rather than erosion of the
polymer. However, the main factor controlling the drug release from the PEO with10.5 Ocular Drug Administration 251
a low-molecular-weight (MW = 0.9106) is the swelling and erosion of the polymer,
which leads to front synchronization and a consistent release rate. Neither the
molecular weight of the PEO nor the drug release, nor the pH of the dissolving fluid
nor the stirring rate, are correlated with one another. Adhering to the mucosa are
bioadhesives: POLYOX’s water solubility, hydrophilicity, high-molecular weight,
hydrogen bonding activity, and strong biocompatibility make it a fantastic option
for mucoadhesion. These are just a few of the many advantages it provides. These
resins may mix with mucus and create a strong interpenetrating network because of
their vast linear chain structure. The statistics indicate that the strongest adhesion
appears to occur at molecular weights of 4,000,000 or more. Cappello et al. (1994)
conducted study on monolithic devices to look at their release behavior and matrix
properties. The intended outcome of changing the release mechanism has been
achieved by combining PEOs with different molecular weights. Both the pace of
dissolution and the expansion of the tablet’s outer swelling layer have attracted
a considerable lot of attention. The numerous various matrix parameters were
connected to the numerous diverse drug-delivery behaviors that were found.
Additionally, studies on the matrices’ viscoelastic characteristics have been done.
Regarding excellent release, viscoelastic, and mucoadhesive qualities, the two
polymer fractions that were used in combination produced the greatest results.
The weight ratio of the mixture was set at 50% (600,000 and 4,000,000 molecular
weight). In order to buccally administer the medication carvedilol (CAR), which
has a low solubility, Cappello et al. (2006) developed a tablet that used PEO as
a bioadhesive sustained-release substrate and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin
(HPbetaCD) as a drug release modifier. The tablet was then encapsulated in an
enteric coating. First, the CAR and HPbetaCD release properties of PEO tablets that
included CAR/HPbetaCD binary systems with a variety of dissolving capabilities
were examined and compared to PEO tablets that just contained CAR. In order
to determine whether or not the buccal administration of CAR is a viable option,
permeation tests were conducted with the mucosa of pigs that had been surgically
removed. More CAR was able to penetrate from the PEO tablet when the tablets
contained HPbetaCD, and the CAR/HPbetaCD freeze-dried system achieved the
maximum value. Rama Bukka et al. (2012) used a 23 factorial design to make
buccal mucoadhesive films of felodipine by casting PEO with either hydroxy propyl
cellulose (HPC) or ethyl cellulose. This process created felodipine films that adhere
to the mucosa of the buccal cavity. Both dichloromethane and ethanol were used
as the solvent in this experiment (1 : 1 ratio). The films’ ex vivo mucoadhesive
effectiveness, in vitro residence time, drug release, and percentage swelling were
all assessed. The non-Fickian, zero-order release theory of kinetic release was
scrupulously followed in every formulation.
10.5 Ocular Drug Administration
In order to control the ocular delivery of ofloxacin (OFX) via powder compression,
Di Colo et al. (2001) examined a unique usage of high-molecular-weight (400 kDa)252 10 A Multifunctional Polymer – POLYOX – and Its Uses as a Novel Drug-Delivery System
linear PEO in gel-forming erodible inserts. This was done in order to control the
ocular administration of ofloxacin via powder compression. Alterations were made
to the erosion time scale by the use of PEO in conjunction with Eudragit L100 (EUD),
17% neutralized (EUDNa17), or 71% neutralized (EUDNa71). As soon as they were
injected into the lower conjunctival sac of the rabbit eyes, the mucoadhesive gels
produced by the inserts based on plain PEO, PEO-EUDNa17, were well tolerated
by the animals. These inserts were built using PEO-EUDNa17, PEO-EUDNa71, or
ordinary PEO. Aftersome time had passed, the gels dispersed themselvesthroughout
the corneal surface and disintegrated. The sequence in which PEO-EUDNa71, PEO,
and PEO-EUDNa17 were used to describe the gel’s residence time in the precorneal
region is as follows:
10.5.1 POLYOX in Osmotic Pump Systems
Patel et al. built push–pull osmotic pumps(PPOP) using POLYOX in orderto admin￾ister a model drug that is practically insoluble at a constant pace (zero order release)
over the course of a considerable amount of time. In order to evaluate the effect
that the material has, many grades of POLYOX were tested. The formulations for
the pull layer used POLYOXWSR-80 NF or N-750 NF, while the push layer used
POLYOXWSR-301 NF, Coagulant NF, or 303 NF. According to the findings of an
investigation into the effects of utilizing various grades of POLYOX in the push layer
(2>70), the grade of POLYOX utilized did not have a major impact on the release of
the medication. Using a higher viscosity grade (N750) forthe pull layerinstead of the
control formulation increased the lag time and delayed the drug release (2 = 32–34).
This was in comparison to the formulation that served as the control. A developed
an osmotic, oral, controlled-release capsule that releases pharmaceuticals at prede￾termined delivery rates (T80% = 6 or 14 hours) Waterman et al. (2011). This was
accomplished in spite of drug characteristics (such as solubility) or drug loading.
The osmotic capsule comprises both the active tablet and the push tablet. The active
tablet is formed when the drug and PEO are mixed together. In addition, the body
of the capsule is stuffed with a “push” tablet that is composed of sodium chloride,
microcrystalline cellulose, and high-molecular-weight PEO. The results show that
the capacity of the API to dissolve is unaffected by medication loadingsranging from
65 to 375 mg of the active component. The pH did not have any effect on the rate of
dissolution anywhere in the biorelevant range (2–6.8).
10.6 Drug Delivery for the Gastroretentive System
Developed and optimized bisoprolol drug-delivery systems that consisted of a core
tablet that contained the active ingredient and an erodible outer shell that included
a gas-generating agent Jagdale et al. (2013). These systems were constituted of a
bisoprolol drug-delivery system. POLYOXWSR205 and POLYOXWSR N12K were
utilized throughout the process of press coating the optimized RRCT. In a 32-way
full factorial design, the independent variables that were chosen to investigate were10.7 Film with a Fast Turnaround Time 253
the amount of POLYOXWSR205 and POLYOXWSR N12K. The lag time, the rate
at which medicine was released, and the swelling index were selected to be the
dependent variables. The floating pulsatile release formulation F13 showed a lag
time of four hours with more than 90% of the medication being released at level
0 (55 mg) for POLYOXWSR205 and level +1 (65 mg) for POLYOXWSR N12K. The
release kinetics of the optimized formulation were the ones that offered the greatest
match for the zero-order models. An in vivo investigation provides evidence that
the burst effect can last for up to four hours, which suggests that the dose form
has been perfected. In their study of sustained-release floating tablets containing
cefuroxime axetil, Bomma & Veerabrahma (2013) utilized HPMC K4M and HPMC
K100M polymers both independently and in conjunction with POLYOXWSR 303.
Every formulation was able to support a medication release that lasted for 12 hours.
After putting the dissolution profiles through their paces with a variety of kinetic
release models, it was found that the drug release mechanism corresponded to
Peppas’ model. In vivo radiography investigations revealed that the pills were
broken down and digested in the stomach over a period of 225–230 minutes. An
asymmetric triple layer pill was presented by Yang et al. (1999) as a potential method
for treating Helicobacter using the three medications tetracycline, metronidazole,
and bismuth salt. PEO and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose were the two primary
rate-controlling polymeric excipients that were utilized in this study. Tetracycline
and metronidazole were injected into the core layer of the triple-layer matrix in
order to provide controlled delivery. However, bismuth salt might be added to one
of the outside layers of the matrix in order to achieve quick release. According
to the findings, the continuous administration of metronidazole and tetracycline
lasted for between six and eight hours. To distribute both water-soluble and
water-insoluble compounds in the stomach, Mahalingam et al. (2009) produced
compacts with specific bioadhesive polymers, fillers, and binders. Compacts made
of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and PEO in ratios of 90 : 10, 75 : 25, and 60 : 40 were
investigated for swelling, dissolving, bioadhesion, and in vitro gastric retention. In
vitro gastric retention was also evaluated. Compacts with more PEO demonstrated
increased swelling (110.99%) and bioadhesion (0.620,03 N cm−2) under in vitro
conditions. These compacts also retained their integrity and adherence to stomach
mucosa for around nine hours. Compacts comprising 58.1% PVP, 39.9% PEO, and
2.1% of water-soluble or water-insoluble marker compounds were able to display
gastroadhesive and retentive characteristics in vivo. It has been established that the
combination of PEO and PVP resultsin the production of a bioadhesive dosage form
of the non-disintegrating type that is suitable for use in gastroretentive applications.
10.7 Film with a Fast Turnaround Time
Particularly in the creation of fast-dissolving films, low-molecular-weight linear
PEO (POLYOX) has demonstrated tremendous potential as a substance for rapid￾release medication administration. Producing film from this material is a straight￾forward process since POLYOX possesses exceptional film-forming capabilities.254 10 A Multifunctional Polymer – POLYOX – and Its Uses as a Novel Drug-Delivery System
POLYOX has a high water absorption capacity; as a result, when its film comes
into contact with aqueous medium, it immediately dissolves, leading to fast disin￾tegration. This is because to POLYOX’s high water absorption capacity. Numerous
research have been conducted on low-molecular-weight POLYOX-based rapidly
dissolving filmsfor oral administration. These films have been shown to be effective.
Using a variety of grades of POLYOX, including POLYOXN10, N80, N750, and N205,
Chaudhary et al. (2012) were able to produce films that dissolve in a short amount
of time. With the use of CCD design, the concentration of the plasticizer and the
polymer in the film may be made to work better. It was agreed that the tensile
strength, folding endurance, percentage of medication released at 10 minutes (Y10),
and disintegration duration would be used as the dependent variables in this study.
According to the findings, using 2% POLYOXN 750 and 15% PEG 400 resulted in a
great film-forming property and 100% drug release in 15 minutes.
10.8 Extended Duration of Effect
The feasibility of utilizing a counter polymer in PEO/polyethylene glycol (PEG)
polymeric matrices to achieve the prolonged release of a sizeable quantity of a
very water-soluble medication was examined by Kiss et al. (2006). Their goal was
to do this in a manner that was more controlled. Tablets known as CR-A have a
PEO/PEG matrix in addition to four other drugs, each of which dissolves differently
in water. In addition, the medicine diltiazem hydrochloride (DTZ), which is
water-soluble, was included in the formulation of the cross-linked carboxyvinyl
polymer (CVP)/PEO/PEG matrix tablets (CR-B), and the in vitro characteristics
of these tablets were compared to those of the CR-A formulation. The diffusion of
DTZ was effectively reduced, resulting in sustained release for 24 hours or more,
as part of an effort to regulate the drug release of more water-soluble medications.
This was accomplished with the use of a polymer that possessed a charge that was
opposite to that of the drug.
Disadvantages of using POLYOX
● They can endow the finished product with lubricity and water solubility. Craz￾ing and tensile failure, on the other hand, are possibilities if even a moderately
consistent force is given to POLYOX materials.
● Crystallization may also occur with polymers, and it doesso more easily and more
rapidly with decreasing molecular weight because there is a correlation between
the decreasing molecular weight and an increase in water absorption.
● Due to LMW POLYOX’s strong water absorption, a glassy rubberized transi￾tion may be visible on SEM photomicrographs; as a result, it must be more
noticeable. This is because it is a result of the high water absorption of LMW
POLYOX.
● Both the dosage form and the pure substance are impacted by these structural
changes that are carried on by the natural ageing process.10.10 The Consistency of POLYOX 255
● There is a possibility that the mechanical qualities and drug release properties
will shift over time, which may result in stability problems. Future issues must be
avoided; thus, it’s critical to keep an eye out for any potential structural changes
(Kiss et al. 2006; Madhar and Saini 2011; Alcantor et al. 2010; Arunachalam et al.
2010; Sharma et al. 2011; Easterbrook et al. 2011; Tang, 2011).
10.9 Regulatory Aspects of POLYOX
Adherence to FDA and other regulatory agencies’ regulations: The USP PEO NF
monograph is satisfied by POLYOX Water-Soluble Resins, NF Grade. The American
National Formulary, the International Codex Alimentarius, and the Food Chemi￾cals Codex (NF) have all established standards for these goods. The majority of the
countries that make up Europe have approved the usage of these components in
their various medicinal products. It is predicted that the usage of this product will
be permitted in Japan Shah et al. (2014).
10.10 The Consistency of POLYOX
The oxidative breakdown of POLYOX polymers can lead to chain cleavage and
a decrease of viscosity during storage if it does place. All polymers developed by
POLYOX for use in the pharmaceutical industry contain butylated hydroxyl toluene
(BHT) as an antioxidant, at quantities ranging from 300 to 500 parts per million
(ppm). However, by making the protons on carbon atoms more labile, oxygen
significantly improves the process in the molecules. This is accomplished by the
following mechanism: There are a lot of striking parallels between the degrading
process of POLYOX and that of hydrocarbon chains (Tang 2011; Nisato and Baret
2010; Heiati and Weimann 2010; Vinod et al. 2012). A number of different types of
metal ions, such as ferrous, cuprous, cupric, and silver, have the potential to speed
accelerate the decomposition of POLYOX. In general, catalysts containing ions
with a lower valence are more efficient. Increasing the polymer’s stability may be
accomplished in a number of ways, one of which is by applying an oxygen barrier
film layer to the final dosage form. BHT and vitamin E are the two antioxidants that
are utilized with POLYOX the vast majority of the time. Although BHT is already
present in polymers designated for medical use of POLYOX in a concentration of
approximately 301–501 ppm (0.03–0.05% w/w), it is recommended that an addi￾tional 101–1001 ppm (0.01–0.10%) be added to the formulation of POLYOX tablets.
Vitamin E is utilized not only in preventative but also in curative applications due
to its antioxidant properties. The typical range for application is between 501 and
1001 ppm. In order to guarantee that the POLYOX(tm) powder is properly mixed,
Vitamin E is first diluted with a very little amount of isopropyl alcohol and then
stirred into the powder. Industrial applications may call for the usage of sodium
thiosulfate at a concentration of 0.1% weight-per-volume as a solid stabilizer.
The processes that gain the most from sodium thiosulfate’s capacity to scavenge256 10 A Multifunctional Polymer – POLYOX – and Its Uses as a Novel Drug-Delivery System
chlorine are those that use municipal (treated) water as their source of water (Shah
et al. 2014). POLYOX does not have a predetermined shelf life; nonetheless, it is
recommended that the material be routinely retested in order to guarantee that it is
suitable for any use. Batches of the material are retested in order to make certain
that they adhere to the viscosity criteria.
In order to evaluate the resiliency of POLYOX, the following grades of the mate￾rial are available (Yoon 2010; Zerbe and Paiement 2011; Sambasivam 2010; David
et al. 2009; Gupta et al. 2011; Patel et al. 2012; Nghiem and Jackson 2009; Patel 2008;
Kidane and Bhatt 2007):
● Six months for grades ranging from moderate-to-high molecular weight (WSR N
all)
● Two years for grades ranging from moderate-to-low-molecular weight (WSR N-10
and N-80). Because of its safety, processing convenience (possibility of direct com￾pression), and the potential to control drug release, a biocompatible eroding poly￾mer called poly(ethylene oxide) is gaining popularity as a sustained-release and
immediate platform.
10.11 Conclusion
PEO comes in a variety of molecular weights, and it is gaining popularity as
a sustained-release and immediate platform because of its versatility. HMW
POLYOX, which releases substances by swelling rather than erosion, is the root
cause of anomalous release kinetics. LMW both erosion and the development of
POLYOX hydrate take place at a faster pace. POLYOX has been used to make oral
sustained-release tablets, gastroretentive tablets, extended release, buccal films,
ocular inserts, colon-targeted tablets, osmotic tablets, and quick dissolving films
based on the variable molecular weight and release rate that it generates. Polymers
are currently being used extensively in the development of innovative drug-delivery
strategies for therapies that are either highly or weakly soluble (Kumar et al. 2011;
Saraf 2010; He et al. 2008; Rane and Prabhakar 2009; Godin and Touitou 2004;
Youfang et al. 2009; Shimada 2012).

11.1 Introduction
The term “green” polymer synthesis is a newer approach in the field of polymer
chemistry that revolves around the fact of biodegradable aspect to make the entire
process ecologically sustainable. This approach has been encouraged by the scien￾tists owing to the disadvantages incurred by the synthetic materials due to their
chemical and physical degradation while used biomedically. Their biodegradability
and biocompatibility with lower amount of toxicity is a major advantageous fea￾ture rendering them to be more convenient for use in human-health-related areas,
agriculture, environment, etc. Plant-based renewable source of synthesis is gaining
lots of attention worldwide so that the hazards due to the non-degradable chemi￾cals induced into the environment could be minimized. To improve the standard of
human health this research has provided right set of circumstances (Satyanarayana
et al. 2009). Transition from the non-biodegradable to biodegradable materials is a
greater achievement in itself which helps in the reduction of harmful chemicals to
percolate into the environment. The composite materials of polymerinclude various
applicationsthat are used in transportation, packaging of food, pharmaceuticals, etc.
Certain limitations of the polymers were overcome by use of intractable materials.
Nanocomposites of polymers comprise nanoparticles and nanofillers distributed all
overin the matrix of polymer matrix. Nanoparticles and nanofillers mostly have var￾ious shapes (fibers, spheroids, and platelets) where the size ranges from 1 to 50 nm.
The nanoparticle implementation improvised the basic polymers propertiesin terms
of permeability and mechanical (water and gases) properties with (elastic modu￾lus, strength, and dimensional stability). Composites of polymers have opened new
opportunities in the industries like rubber and thermoplastic having strengthened
properties.

The intriguing fact about the polymers is their green variants having an environ￾ment sustainable side to it. Features of green polymer nanocomposites are their
properties should encompass renewable and biodegradable genre since the incep￾tion of polymer formation on earth took place. Artificially and naturally in both the
cases the polymers play important role. Polymers involve superstructures modern
processing technologies and polymerization processes. In everyday life the involve￾ment of developmental scientific technologies has a key role, and the difficulty level
would have reached summit if polymers were not used which has one major role
in pacemaker that aids life for those suffering from cardiovascular diseases. In ear￾lier times chemically modified biopolymers were used. The abundant organic com￾pounds produced by the organisms are sugar-based cellulose, organic biomass, and
various other components. The incorporation of 20 amino acids under controlled
condition in biotechnological labs helps in producing polypeptides thereby produc￾ing variety of synthetic proteins for instance insulin, which has both industrial and
biomedical applications. On a large-scale basis synthetic polymers in the twentieth
century are obtained and procured industrially. Indiscriminate use of fossils and
natural source raw materials by the chemical industries expedites production of
polymersthereby reducing manufacturing cost. Recycling of those polymer products
which have completed their shelf life, therefore the by-products and the waste from
polymers, has become an important source of energy and raw materials. Due to the
advancement in polymer manufacturing processes, they are optimized to be insulat￾ing, conducting, stiff, rubbery or soft, biodegradable or stable, etc. Simply the most
important polymer applications are mostly found to be in medical and food pack￾aging, lightweight packaging, aerospace industries, automotive industries, modern
architecture, high strength fibers, textile industries, microelectronics, electrical cir￾cuits, in paints, corrosion protection, drug-delivery system, dental filings, implants,
and many more. Plastics are the most essential part of any consumer product.
11.2 Polymer
“Polymer” word originated from the Greek word “poly” which denotes “many” and
“mer” means “parts.” Polymers are long-chain molecules that comprise identical
or similar building blocks covalently bonded. Polymers are macromolecules and
mostly large molecules. Due to their respective characteristics polymer molecules
are bonded accordingly in different manner. Rubber and polyesters are stretchable
and flexible polymers, while glass and epoxies are resistant and tough.
Polymers have become a considerable part of everyday life, for example tires, elec￾tronic gadgets, and water bottles. Monomers are the single molecular units which
combine and help in the formation of polymers. Consecutive units create repeat￾ing units. The repeating unit is the one that is enclosed in square brackets. But
even though both of them contain identical atoms in the same relative position, the
repeating unit’s structure is a bit different from the monomers. Electrons must be
rearranged in order for the monomer to become a polymer. The structural unit is
the leftover from the monomer that was used to create the polymer. The polystyrene11.2 Polymer 263
chain is the identical repeating unit with its structural unit since its polymer in the
instance of polystyrene was created from a single monomer (styrene). Polyethylene,
polyacrylonitrile, and polypropylene are more examples of this kind of polymer.
Many factors may be used to characterize polymers. The classification depends on
the polymer’s origin,structure, mechanism of polymerization, preparative methods,
or thermal behavior.
11.2.1 Naturally Occurring Polymer
Natural polymers are mainly found in nature (in animal and plants). These are
nucleotides and nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, etc. Essentially a polymer is
made up of chemically joining multiple smaller molecules or substances to build
bigger molecule. Since naturally occurring polymers are formed in the environment
on its own, they are formed by either condensation or addition polymerization.
11.2.1.1 Natural Polymer Examples
In nature, there are several instances of natural polymers. Often, their structures are
highly conspicuous. As compared to proteins or enzymes, which have rather com￾plex structures, natural rubber, starch, and cellulose are some examples of polymers
that originate from plant (natural). This is a list of some of them, along with a brief
description:
Polypeptides and proteins: Proteins form the rudimentary class of organic polymers
that creates up the majority of living things. Proteins are the most adaptable; also,
they act as catalysts. Enzymes are the name for several proteins. The biochemical
processes occurring inside are due to the presence of enzymes inside the cells in
our bodies. Hemoglobin, a particular class of protein found in blood, transports
oxygen from the lungs to the body’s cells.
A naturally occurring polyamide is often a protein. This amide group in polymer
forms the body’s backbone chain.
Cellulose ((C6H10O5)n): It is an organic polysaccharide comprising chain (Scheller
et al. 2007). In plants, cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectin form the cell wall
mostly (Nishiyama et al. 2002).
Applications:
● In the pharma industry, cellulose in microcrystalline form is readily used as
diluent or binder in tablet manufacturing for direct compression and granula￾tion process (Hon et al. 1996).
● Starches: The primary stored form of carbohydrates in plants, starch is mostly
obtained from seeds and subterranean organs. Granules of starch can be found
in nature (starch grains). A multitude of starches, including those from potato,
rice, wheat, and maize (Zea mays), are approved for use in pharmaceuticals
(Solanum tuberosum) (Kokate et al. 2003).
A carbohydrate known as starch or amylum is made up of many units of glucose
units bonded together by glycosidic linkages (Te-Wierik et al. 1997).264 11 Green Synthesis of Polymers and Its Application in Industry
11.2.2 Synthetic Polymer
They are artificially created by humans. Polymers are the amalgamation of repeat￾ing units known as monomers. Polyethylene is made up of ethene and ethylene
monomeric units which are the simplest form of polymer and is also known as the
high-density polyethylene-HDPE. Many of the polymeric materials have chain-like
structures which resemble polyethylene. Synthetic polymers contain polyvinylchlo￾ride, polystyrene, etc.
11.2.3 Types of Synthetic Polymers with Examples
Different polymers have been created so far. Let us take a quick look at a few of the
synthetic polymers that are utilized on a daily basis.
11.2.3.1 Nylon
Nylon, commonly known as polyamides, is a member of synthetic polymers. It was
created on 28 February 1935, at the DuPont research facility by Wallace Carothers.
A frequently used polymer is known as nylon. Its amide-based structure makes it
more hydrophilic than other polymers. Contrary to the pure hydrocarbon polymers
that are used to create the majority of plastics, nylon engages in hydrogen bonding
with water.
11.2.3.2 Polyvinyl Chloride
Polyvinyl chloride isthe most common plastic after polyethylene and polypropylene.
Since its inexpensive unlike copper or iron they are used in buildings and construc￾tions. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) replaces rubber in several places including clothing
and electrical wire insulation.
11.2.3.3 Low-Density Polyethylene
Most common type ofsynthetic polymerislow-density polyethene, a polymer widely
used in households. Ethylene is the basis of LDPE (low density polyethylene) which
is the monomer.
11.2.3.4 Polypropylene
Polypropylene is a type of thermoplastic which is used in the plastics, reusable con￾tainers labeling, packaging, stationery, laboratory equipment, etc.
Other examples are neoprene, Teflon, polystyrene, high-density polythene, etc.
Synthetic polymers are formed by the following methods:
Polymerization is a chemical process by which monomeric units get added and
linked to form a polymeric chain; hence, the process linked to form a polymer
is called polymerization. The process of polymerization begins with monomers
reacting to create a dimer, which then combines with some other monomer to
create a trimer, and so on. Any chemical species present in the reaction medium
may react with other molecules to generate dimers, trimers, or even larger
molecules. Regardless of the situation, a network of connections is created in11.2 Polymer 265
between consecutive units and the final polymer molecule, also known as a poly￾mer chain. Oligomer’s polymerization is with low-molecular-weight by-products
like dimers, trimers, and tetramers. They often have unfavorable mechanical and
thermal qualities. A substance often has to be highly polymerized before it can
develop useful characteristics and be correctly referred to be a polymer (Zhou
et al. 2020). There are two types:
1) Addition
2) Condensation
Addition Polymerization This is a process which involves coupling of monomeric
units utilizing their multiple bonds known as addition polymerization. For
instance, the formation of polyethylene from ethylene molecule is the most com￾monly observed chemical reaction process. In this type of reaction, the double bond
opens up in each of ethylene molecules, and each of the two electrons previously
present in this bond was used to form carbon-carbon new single bonds with the
other two ethylene molecules. The formation of addition polymers takes place
by repetitive addition of monomer molecules possessing triple or double bonds.
For instance, the formation of ((C3H6)n) polypropene and ((C2H4)n) polythene is
produced from (C3H6) propene and (C2H4) ethene, respectively.
Homopolymers: Homopolymers are created when one polymeric species is polymer￾ized to create other polymers. As an illustration polythene ((C2H4)n).
Copolymers: A copolymer is created when addition polymerization takes place
between two distinct monomers, forming addition polymers as a result. For
example, Buna-N, Buna-S, etc.
Condensation Polymerization The chemical reaction mechanism used to make and
break polymers inside the cells is mostly the same in all cases.
11.2.4 Natural Polymer
Natural polymers are proteins, cellulose, wool,silk, DNA andRNA, chitosan, natural
rubber, starch.
1) Polynucleotides are those types which is formed of large chain of nucleotides.
2) Polyamides are those types which are formed of large molecules of proteins.
3) Polysaccharides are those types which are formed from large chain of sugar
molecules.
Need for biodegradable polymers:
1) Since polymer plays a significant part in everyday life and has various other uses
and advantages in every sphere.
2) If the polymeric by products are deleterious which will account to a huge haz￾ardous effect into the environment? Therefore, its biodegradable property will
make it more eco-friendly.266 11 Green Synthesis of Polymers and Its Application in Industry
3) Hence a large amount to waste from the polymers should be curbed to bring
down the detrimental effects, so biodegradable polymers uses are nowadays
encouraged.
11.2.5 The Strategic Green Synthesis and Their Application
11.2.5.1 Developing Polymer Raw Materials
Polymeric raw material production is also moving toward becoming more envi￾ronmentally friendly. Several polymer chemical materials may be created during
the chemical synthesis process in a single step using catalysis, and the conversion
utilization rate can reach 100%. Also, this method modifies the conventional
operation mode and avoids the usage of hazardous chemical catalysts (Li et al.
2018). For instance, biosynthetic technology will be used to entirely green, safely,
and operationally produce adipic acid. Chlorine gas is added in the middle of the
usual two-step process to produce propylene oxide.
This particular gas has a specific level of toxicity and will harm the environment.
But today, both locally and globally, this manufacturing technique has been altered,
and the catalytic oxidation method is used to fully utilize raw materials in the indus￾trial reaction system without generating certain compounds that contaminate the
environment. Several synthetic chemical compounds now being created are steadily
reducing the amount of hazardous waste or emissions produced during material
synthesis, moving in the direction of green ecology, and protecting the environment
(Fu 2019).
11.3 The Difference Between Degradable and
Biodegradable Polymer
11.3.1 Degradable Polymer
The term “degradable” means “that which is easily breakdown able.” Mostly
plastics are degradable type in nature. When an additive is administered to any
petroleum-based plastic it becomes photodegradable becomes brittle. We can add
an additive to normal, petroleum-based plastic that will make it become brittle.
Sometimes when the plastics are subjected to oxidation it becomes easily breakable
such is known as oxo degradable plastics. By involving this method the bulk amount
seems to reduce in the process of degradable plastic manufacturing. It’s a long
process and takes several years to get reduced to small pieces by assimilation with
the help of microorganisms and degrade. Hence whether a polymer is degradable
or biodegradable should be verified quite consciously since plastic materials do
not easily get degraded easily whatsoever back into the earth. In the environment,
biodegradable polymers entirely decompose into CO2, methane, water, biomass,
and inorganic chemicals that microbes may readily mineralize through a thermo￾chemical process. Both renewable and nonrenewable resources can be used to
make a biodegradable polymer. Biobased polymers include organic carbon from11.3 The Difference Between Degradable and Biodegradable Polymer 267
sustainable feedstock, albeit they are not necessarily biodegradable. Furthermore,
it is possible to make biobased polymers using components that are found in
nature.
11.3.2 Biodegradable Polymer
In case of biodegradable polymers, the breakdown into the simpler forms is brought
about by the microorganisms. The biodegradable plastics are broken into simpler
forms and the carbon chains take part in the formation of organic molecules. Some￾times, they become a part of organic livings things; thus, it gets back to the nature
taking part in the carbon cycle maintaining the ecological balance of the earth.
Within a time frame only biodegradable plastics degrade. Sometimes with the help
of microorganisms the petroleum-based plastics simply could not be decomposed
easily, or otherwise it will take several years to degrade slowly. Recent insights
into this area have focused upon oxo degradable approach which in turn will be
more convenient. There are certain plastics which are formed from the renewable
resources that are non-biodegradable. Even if they are degradable, they do not
sublime into the earth and they cannot be decomposed by microorganisms; hence,
there are significant differences between biodegradable and non-biodegradable
plastics. Most frequently referred to as “biopolymers,” biodegradable polymers are
made primarily from different natural sources. The most often utilized biopolymers
that have little to no impact on the environments expanding carbon footprint
includes plastics like PLA (Polylactic acid), PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoate), and
starch. It is crucial to know that biodegradability is a polymeric property which
is nondependent upon its place of origin and may be changed by the molecular
mechanism. As a result, certain polymers made from the petroleum feedstock can
be broken by nature (Mohanty et al. 2005).
11.3.3 Biodegradable Polymers Classification (shown in Figure 11.1)
1) Sugar-based biopolymers: Poly lactic acid (PLA), mostly found, is adaptable and
an exclusively studied sugar-based biopolymer with enormous promise for sev￾eral uses, including the automobile industry. Lactic acid, a naturally occurring
sugar found in milk and other foods including wheat, sugarcane, and potatoes,
serves as the monomers primary raw material. Another type of biopolymer cre￾ated by microbes is polyhydroxybutyrate or (PHB), which is used as an energy
store molecule when the microorganisms access to nutrients is constrained. The
bacterium produces PHB as a polymer by assimilating carbon from glucose.
2) Starch-based biopolymers: A biopolymer which is a form of carbohydrate known
as starch is exclusively found in plants and stored in tissues. Although glucose
makes up the majority ofstarch may be produced by applying heat or other chem￾ical stimulants, it may be derived from many different foods such as corn, wheat,
and tapioca.268 11 Green Synthesis of Polymers and Its Application in Industry

3) Cellulose-based biopolymers: Cellulose is found abundantly and in surplus inside
plant cell wall. The most abundant biopolymer found in the plant cell walls. Glu￾cose is majorly found in cellulose. They are widely used as fillers and plasticizers
in biopolymers.
11.3.4 Compostable Plastic
Compostable plastics means it biodegrades at a stipulated time under favorable
conditions. Mostly bioplastic breakdown easily, but once it gets placed in a vacuum
room it takes the prolonged years to breakdown. To eliminate plastics from the
landfills newer biodegradable materials could be engineered. Since the name
biodegradable means upon subjecting to degradation with the help of microorgan￾isms it could be broken down to simpler forms. Natural polymers like cellulose
and starch are the biopolymers that are obtained extracted from plants and again
gets combined with the synthetic polymers to produce biodegradable polymers.
Different properties of plastics could be obtained by varying uses of cellulose and11.3 The Difference Between Degradable and Biodegradable Polymer 269
starch. The uses are for instance toothbrush handles and adhesive packing. When it
reaches the municipal waste collection site, they are subjected to degradation by the
treatment with microorganisms to release carbon dioxide, water biomass which are
useful nutrients for growth of plants. The sunlight plays the key role in the process
of plant growth which produces a set of biodegradable polymers repeating the cycle
consecutively.
Criteria of any material to be a compostable plastic:
1) Fragmentation and loss of transparency and disintegration, particularly in the
final compost, is determined in a pilot decomposition test in which samples of
the test substance are composted with biodegradable garbage for three months.
The mass of the test material leftovers must be less than 10% of the original mass
after this period (Sin and Bee 2019).
2) Biodegradability or the capacity of the biodegradable substance to break down
into carbon dioxide when subjected to microbial activity. The standard specifies
a minimum biodegradation threshold of 90%, which must be met in fewer than
six months (Rudeekit et al. 2008).
3) Adverse impacts on the composting process are not seen.
4) The number of heavy metals must be less than the specified limit values, and the
final compost cannot be adversely impacted (no reduction of agronomic value
and no ecotoxicological effects on plant growth). The “Seedling” emblem may be
used to identify plasticsthat have received EN13432 certification, making it easier
for customers to decide whether to buy and dispose of a product. Products made
of certified biodegradable polymers, including PLA, are disposed of at commer￾cial composting facilities together with other organic waste. Contrary to what is
commonly claimed in the gray literature, PLA, which is already manufactured at
a rate of more than 100,000 t year−1 and is a very versatile material that makes a
great alternative with polystyrene and polypropylene in demanding applications,
is in fact compostable and biodegradable.
For examples, a 2008 study conducted in Thailand on the deterioration of
PLA(Polylactic acid) sheets in composting plants revealed that after eight days, the
sheets were brittle and began to shatter into little pieces due to the relatively high
temperature and humidity (50–60 ∘C and RH(Relative humidity 60%). As a result,
water molecules may pass through the disordered polymer chains at a land com￾posting facility’s average temperature, which is higher than PLA’s glass transition
temperature and so facilitatesthe hydrolysisreaction. Even at home, PLA(polylactic
acid) that is not home compostable becomes home compostable when combined
with polycaprolactone (PCL). In other words, depending on the intended use of the
commercially produced bioplastic items, PLA(polylactic acid)-based plastic blends
may be created to be biodegradable at home or in the workplace and to biodegrade
more or less quickly (Narancic et al. 2018).
As a result, food waste and biodegradable tableware and cutlery made of
PLA(polylactic acid) or PHA that were used, for instance, at big events (sports,
concerts, ceremonies, etc.) and in restaurants could be disposed of in the same
stream. But waste will be converted using the principles of the circular economy270 11 Green Synthesis of Polymers and Its Application in Industry

into valuable biogas, high-quality compost, and fertilizer that will enrich the land.
The same composting facilities, which are common in countries like Germany or
Italy, and areas where food and other organic waste is converted into compost and
biogas, are were composting takes place (Table 11.1).
Biocatalysis requires utilization of the microorganisms, enzymes, micro￾organisms, and sometimes involvement of higher form of organism that facilitates
and propels the biochemical reactions. In the absence of a solvent most of the
biochemical reactions take place thereby inducing a lower temperature of around
(60 ∘C or lower) resulting into production of reduced by products. The exceptional
green method is the production of polymer and the polymerization processes.
Recent studies in this field by the exemplary group of scientists (Gross et al. 2001;
Kobayashi et al. 2001; Kobayashi and Makino 2009; Cheng and Gu 2012; and books
Loos 2011; Cheng and Gross 2008; Cheng and Gross 2010; Cheng et al. 2015) are
available. Biobased materials involve the use of agriculture-based and natural-based
building blocks of polymers and their derivatives. Article reviews by Roach et al.

(2005), Cheng et al. (2013), and Greene (2022) based upon this topic. The favorable
use of these materials is supported by various factors:
1) Reduction of dependence upon petroleum raw materials.
2) Price stability between petroleum-based products and agriculture-based
products.11.3 The Difference Between Degradable and Biodegradable Polymer 271

The flowchart mentioned above the source could be a monomeric unit or might
be an agricultural raw material (e.g. triglyceride, starch, and cellulose). Polymeriza￾tion is a process which occurs with or without involvement of a solvent or catalyst.
It is an organic biocatalysts, acid or base, containing metal. The solvent could be
organic, supercritical CO2 aqueous, perfluorinated medium, ionic liquid, or none.
The process of polymerization process involves extraction, separation, purification,
waste removal with several other operations. The key considerations are processing,
yield, efficiency, and compliance with environmental and energy usage. The ulti￾mate product development and improvement aims toward compounding, formulat￾ing, stabilizing, packaging with evaluation.
11.3.6 Green Reactions
Broadly bio-catalysis and other conventional green efficient solvent-free media
make it systematic. Based upon other studies as we all know bio-catalysis is an
illustrative example of green reactions. For Puskas et al. (2015) and Barrera-Rivera
et al. (2015) used lipases, Kadokawa (2015) phosphorylase, Côté and Skory (2015)
glucan sucrose, and Nduko et al. (2015) lactate polymerizing enzyme for numerous
polymerization and modification reactions. The treatment for wastewater an
important point by Maloney et al. (2015) was use of oxidase and peroxidase. The
non-biocatalytic catalysts applications were also disseminated in several chapters by
MacDonald and Shaver (2015), Romain and Williams (2015), O’Leary Havelka and
Gerhardt (2015), Hernández et al. (2015), Hong et al. (2015), Re et al. (2015), Cheng
and Biswas (2015), and various others like Wu et al. (2019). The “evolutionary
molecular engineering” is supposedly another new avenue to green synthesis
reaction; hence Tada et al. (2015) demonstrated in vitro selection method for
production of functional protein.
11.3.7 Green Processing
Owing to environmental hazards and huge energy consumption industries are try￾ing to curb the chemical waste to minimize biohazards thereby propelling the yield.
Newer process design and planning may expedite improvement with reduction in
logistical difficulty. From agricultural point of view the biobased starting materi￾als like proteins, carbohydrates, and other natural products are more advantageous272 11 Green Synthesis of Polymers and Its Application in Industry
and with almost minimal toxicity, so they may be considered for safe handling of
reactants and products. Three papers in this book may be highlighted in this regard.
Significant example is a paper by Toyama et al. (2015) which works on the novel cel￾lulosic derivative synthesis with reduced solvent and energy consumption without
affecting the properties of the product formed. The dimer acid epoxide preparation
method followed of Li and Li (2015) does not involve organic solvents or toxic chem￾icals and is therefore more eco-friendly. Ideal eco-friendly and green polymers rep￾resent the polymers whose raw materials, polymerization process, processing, and
final products are all harmless to the environment and human health. Our labora￾tory has been applying the principles of green chemistry and chemical engineering
to all the areas of polymer production. On the basis of the use and transformation
of renewable resources as well as the developments of eco-friendly polymerization,
catalysis, processing, and polymeric materials, we are aiming to establish the new
theories and technologies for the eco-friendly polymerization, processing, and mod￾ification of polymeric materials.
11.3.8 Greening of Synthetic Raw Materials
Raw materials created by polymers are used to create many living things. Certain
materials, particularly medical ones, must not be hazardous when in use, be
biodegradable, and be acceptable to the human immune system. As a result,
environmentally friendly and secure standards for synthetic raw materials are
necessary. Many successes have been realized both domestically and internationally
recently.
Studies on polylactic acid network elastomersthat could be biodegraded and were
produced from green raw materials were conducted in a similar manner in Holland
in 1988. They added lysine diisocyanate vinegarto the star-shaped prepolymer chain
made of inositol, L-lactide, and other molecules. Because the ultimate breakdown
products of LDI (lysine diisocyanate) chain extender include ethanol and lysine,
LDI can be referred to as a “green” diisocyanate chain extender. These breakdown
byproducts are completely biodegradable and non-toxic. In addition to being safe
and favorable to the environment, this polymer’s basic ingredient, inositol, is one of
the vitaminsrequired by the human body. In biomedicine,substanceslike lactic acid
and 6-alkyl caproic acid are often used. They are also among the safest and “green￾est” substances. This technique may be termed as “almost completely green.” On
this basis, Strey and other researchers performed more research in 1994 and used
this green reagent to create LDI polylactic acid derivatives. Orthopedic fixing com￾posites were made using high crystalline polyglycolic acid fiber as the reinforcing
ingredient.
11.3.9 Green Catalyst
The utilization of safe catalysts may be overlooked in the research process for poly￾lactic acid materials, despite the fact that conventional polymer raw materials and
polymers are largely eco-friendly and non-toxic. To speed up the chemical process,11.3 The Difference Between Degradable and Biodegradable Polymer 273
stannous octoate, for instance, is frequently utilized as an intermediate catalyst.
Yet, because it includes tin salt, this catalyst could be physiologically harmful and
poisonous if ingested by humans. Biological enzymes can be used as reliable and
safe catalysts in comparison (Wang and Ma 2019).
The insufficient availability of suitable biological enzymes for catalysis in various
chemical processes is the bottleneck of employing biological enzymes for catalysis
due to the restricted range of enzymes. The employment of various catalysts and
compounds has an influence on the safety situation, even though some polyaddition
processes among the present high-molecular polymers have an atomic utilization
rate that may exceed 100%. The efficacy of these materials has to be investigated and
evaluated, particularly in medical papers. It would be good to learn more about the
creation of the green catalytic road.
11.3.10 Application of the Synthetic Polymer Materials
Synthetic polymer materials might be environmentally harmful; hence, the issue
of eco-friendly and non-toxic waste disposal should be considered. To use these
biodegradable polymers securely, the appropriate technique must be adopted.
Synthetic materials made of biodegradable polymers can be put into landfills for
disposal. Wastes made from non-biodegradable polymer materials are divided into
recyclable and non-recyclable wastes. Materials made of recyclable polymers are
categorized and processed to facilitate recycling and minimize resource waste. It is
possible to burn incinerable polymer materials, and the heat energy created during
rubbish incineration may also be used (Song and Li 2018).
1) While processing ecologically inert plastic waste, landfills should be avoided
wherever feasible in favor of recycling and reusing environmentally inert
polymer materials including PP, PE, PET, Nylon 66, PMMA, and PS, among
others.
2) Polyolefins, such as PP and PE, burn safely and have high calorific values,
which are comparable to fuel oil. In order to minimize heat energy pollution,
the enormous heat energy produced by the burning of these polymer materials
can instead be turned into electric energy or other kinds of energy. Nowadays,
removing PVC and avoiding combining it with PP, PE, etc. is essential for the
efficient conversion of municipal solid waste into energy and avoid to waste the
energy due to difficulty in energy recovery.
3) Reasonable usage of PVC is required. Environmental issues arise throughout the
production, processing, usage, and waste disposal of PVC, with the disposal of
PVC waste being the most hazardous. PVC is processed using a variety of addi￾tives, and inappropriate handling will allow any harmful componentsto leak out.
As a result, contact with food and medical items should be avoided as much as
possible. While handling PVC trash, combustion should be avoided as much as
possible since this polymer material will generate harmful compounds during
incineration, which will seriously affect the environment. As quickly as feasible,
PVC should be eliminated from packaging, toys, plastic film, and other appli￾cation industries with short service lives. Additional study should be put into274 11 Green Synthesis of Polymers and Its Application in Industry
the investigation of PVC manufacturing, processing, usage, and waste treatment
in consideration of the advantages of minimizing environmental impact, wide
applicability, cheap cost, non-flammability, good blood compatibility, etc.

12.1 Natural Polymers: Inorganic and Organic
Organic polymers play a significant role in life processes pertaining to formation
of basic structure, for instance a plant’s structural parts are made up of poly￾mers and they are of different types of resins, lignin, cellulose, etc. Cellulose is
polysaccharides composed of complex sugar molecules, while lignin which is a
complex three-dimensional polymeric network forms the very basis. Wood resins
and rubber are simple polymers of hydrocarbon isoprene. Other important natural
polymers as biomolecules include the nucleotides, proteins, amino acids, nucleic
acids – nitrogen-containing complex molecules composed of sugars, bases, and
phosphoric acid. The coding of genetic information is stored inside these nucleic
acids inside the cell structure. Another important natural polymer which forms
the food energy source present in plants includes starches which are composed of
glucose biomolecules
12.2 Synthetic Organic Polymers
(Synthetic) polymers are artificial polymers. Synthetic polymers are mainly cate￾gorized into four types: fibers, elastomers, thermoplastics, and thermosets. Ther￾moplastics are a type of polymers; they are malleable at a particular temperature
and hence upon cooling they solidify and easily moldable. On the other hand,
thermosets are rigid and once shaped they are unchangeable; therefore, they are
mostly used as adhesives. Elastomer is a flexible polymer, for example rubber. Syn￾thetic fibers are obtained from plant and animal origin by constant improvement of
polymers.

Polyacrylatesform the very basic structure forsynthetic polymerslike polystyrene
and polythene. They are composed of carbon-carbon bonds; on the other hand,
hetero chain polymers for example, polycarbonates, polysulfides, polyesters,
polyamides, and polyurethanes, having other intrinsic elements (e.g. nitrogen,
sulfur, oxygen), are included along the foundation structure. In the presence of
non-covalent bonding the coordination polymers contain an extensive range of
metals in their backbone structure. On account of variations in their side chain and
main chains a vast range of synthetic polymers are available.
12.3 Synthetic Polymers in Everyday Use
There are certain regular synthetic polymers used in household include nylons.
Teflon and polyvinyl chlorides are mostly used in pipes and in non-stick cook￾ware, respectively. Whereas common PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles
are usually synthetic polymer manufactured from (polyethylene terephthalate).
Numerous plastic covers and kits are predominantly made of polythene, and Buna
rubbers are used in the manufacture of tires. Due to environmental concerns
non-biodegradable synthetic polymers pose hazards; therefore, alternative methods
of obtaining polymers are more encouraged, for instance bioplastics even if they are
expensive. Since the polymers are made up of hydrocarbon, they have a tendency of
hydrophobicity which means they do not easily absorb water; otherwise, it would
have been a misfit phenomenon.
12.4 Synthetic Polymers Types
12.4.1 Polyethylene (Low Density)
Polyethylene (low density) is a common source of organic polymers (synthetic in
nature) often used in everyday households activities. Low-density polyethylene is
a common thermoplastic formed out of ethylene monomer. The first polymer was
produced in the year 1933 by Imperial Chemical Industries using the technique of
polymerization of free radical under high pressure. LDPE (low density polyethy￾lene) is usually recycled and depicted by number 4 owing to its recycling symbol.
Despite other modern replaceable polymers in market, LDPE has retained its own
importance.
12.4.2 (Polyethylene of High Density)
High-density polyethylene is obtained from petroleum which is also a polyethylene
(thermoplastic). Approximately 1.75 kg of petroleum (based upon raw materi￾als and energy) is required to manufacture a kilogram of HDPE (high-density
polyethylene).12.4 Synthetic Polymers Types 281
12.4.3 (Polypropylene)
Polypropylene (PP), which is usually called polypropene, is also a thermoplastic
polymer widely used in various labeling and packaging, stationery, plastic parts,
textiles, and sometimesin varioustypes ofreusable containers.It is also used to make
automobile equipment, laboratory equipment, polymer banknotes, loudspeakers,
etc. Additionally, a new set is made up from monomer of propylene which is quite
durable and non-reactive to acids bases and chemical solvents.
12.4.4 (Polyvinyl Chloride)
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is considered third widely obtained plastic material next to
polypropylene and polyethylene. PVC forms the core of foundations in construction
due to its cost effectiveness and durability other than the conventional alternative
like copper and iron. With the addition of plasticizers, it can reform into more soft
and flexible structures phthalates being the most popular. Polyvinyl chloride has a
usage in upholstery and clothing, insulation inside the electrical cable, inflatable
products with wide applications where it can be used as alternative to rubber.
12.4.5 Polystyrene
Polystyrene (PS), a polymer aromatic in nature, is obtained from styrene monomer
which is a liquid form of petrochemical. Popularly known plastic, it is a solid in
nature and used in colorless plastic model, DVD, CD cases, disposable cutlery,
and smoke detector inside multi-storied housings. Foamed form of polystyrene
encompasses insulation, drinking cups, and packing materials. The biodegradation
process of this polymer is slower and is quite controversial, and often found littered
along seashore.
12.4.6 Nylon
It is a synthetic polymer popularly belonging to a polyamide and was produced by
Wallace Carothers at DuPont’s research facility. Nylon is one of the regularly and
usually used polymers. The presence of amide in the main structure makes nylon
hydrophilic in nature. That is the reason why nylon clothing absorbs water because
nylon material forms a unique hydrogen bonding with water in contrast to the other
hydrocarbon polymers.
12.4.7 Teflon
Teflon is synthetic in nature (fluoropolymer) of tetrafluoroethylene, and has
various applications. It has high-molecular structure compound, solid in nature,
consists totally of fluorine and carbon. It is non-hydrophobic in nature; therefore,
water-containing substances interact with Teflon. Teflon is mostly used in manufac￾turing cookware (non-stick) coated pans and other cookware due to its less friction
with other compounds. Due to its inactive nature use of PTFE it is mostly found in
making containers and pipework where corrosive and reactive chemicals would not282 12 Organic Polymers and Their Role in Pharmaceutical and Chemical Industries
create any untoward impact. Often used as a lubricant, Teflon diminishes abrasion
wear and tear, lowers energy exhaust of machinery. Teflon is also used by NASA in
space project peripherals.
12.4.8 Thermoplastic (Polyurethane)
Thermoplastic polyurethane belongs to the family of compounds polyurethane
plastic. Polyurethane has many utilities which includes transparency, elasticity,
and resistance to abrasion, grease, and oil. Hydrophilic nature of thermoplastic
polyurethane (TPU) attributes and propels it to reaction involving water. Techni￾cally, it is an elastomer which is thermoplastic in nature comprising long-chain
fragmented components of soft and hard segments of copolymer.
12.5 Addition Reactions
In addition reactions, combination of two molecules creates a bigger molecule.
In organic chemistry, an addition reaction means where two or more molecules
combine togetherto form a bigger molecule. Addition reactionsform chemical com￾pounds due to multiple bonds between carbon-carbon double bonds (form alkenes)
or with triple bonds (form alkynes). Molecules having carbon-carbon double bonds,
like carbonyl (C=OC=O) groups or imine (C=NC=N) groups, are subjected to
addition reaction. An addition reaction is basically the inverse of an elimination
reaction.
Two most important types of polar addition reactions are nucleophilic addition
and electrophilic addition with the presence of two (non-polar) addition reactions
also present in free radical addition pertaining to other cycloadditions. In case
of addition–elimination reaction, mostly an addition reaction is followed by an
elimination reaction; consequently, this chemical reaction helps in the addition to
carbonyl compounds in nucleophilic acyl substitution process. The best example
of addition elimination reaction is hydrolysis of nitriles into respective carboxylic
acids.
12.5.1 Electrophilic Addition
Most alkene chemical reaction goes with electrophilic addition reaction. For
instance, in the Prins reaction a carbonyl group is an electrophile. In halogenation
reaction, addition of elementary chlorine or bromine to alkenes yields dichloro￾and dibromo-alkanes, respectively.

In above addition reaction of chlorine to ethane both chlorine and ethene they
form a single molecule of 1,2-dichloroethane.12.5 Addition Reactions 283
12.5.2 Nucleophilic Form (an Addition Reaction)
An electron pair in nucleophilic addition reaction is donated by a nucleophile to the
electrophile (in the double bond single atoms are present). It is the halogen in hydro
halogenation reaction. The electron pair gets donated by the halogen to double-bond
carbons. This is followed by addition of hydrogen to the another carbon which was
previously double bonded. When hydrohalic acids like HCl or HBr are added to
alkenes they yield the corresponding haloalkanes, respectively. Chemical reaction
is given as:
CH3CH = CH2 + HBr → CH3 − CHBr − CH3CH3CH
= CH2 + HBr → CH3 − CHBr − CH3
12.5.3 Free Radical
In case of free radical additions of any halogens to alkanes or any alkenes a radical
halogen attacks an alkane in order to produce a radical; therefore, radical form of
the alkane is formed. Similarly, the radical alkane has the ability to attack another
compound generating a series of radicals which continue to attack eventually and
this process continues.
Polymerization of alkenesis quite feasible and is a significantreaction which helps
in the production of polymers in larger scale of high-throughput industrial value
like plastics polypropylene and polyethylene. Polymerization proceeds either with
anionic mechanism or with free radical generation mechanism, respectively.
12.5.4 Condensation Reactions
In a condensation reaction the chemical reaction occurs where one new molecule
is created with a loss of another molecule (usually water is lost). Releasing a small
molecule by combination of two molecules occurs here. When water is lost in the
process of condensation reaction it is usually called dehydration reaction. The other
molecules lost in the process could be chloride, methanol, acetic acid, and hydro￾gen chloride. When the chemical reaction takes place between the two separate
moleculesthen the reaction isintermolecular. A common example ofsuch chemical
reaction is when two amino acids combine to form a peptide. Hydrolysis inverse is
condensation reaction where two entity splitsto give rise to hydroxide and hydrogen
ions formation.

In peptide bond, for example, the condensation with dehydration of two partic￾ular amino acids forms a peptide bond in red, while water molecule is eliminated
(blue).284 12 Organic Polymers and Their Role in Pharmaceutical and Chemical Industries
Condensation reaction occurs in between different parts of the same molecule,
which itself is known asintramolecularreaction therefore leading to ring formation.
For instance, in Dieckmann condensation from a single diester molecule two ester
groups react with each other to lose one small molecule of alcohol to form a product
called β-ketoester. Condensation reactionsfollow an aldol condensation mechanism
or a nucleophilic acyl substitution. Other condensations reactions are triggered by
radical conditions like acyloin condensation.
12.5.5 Condensation Polymerization Reactions
The polymerization condensation reaction forms a continuous series of step occurs
where monomer gets added consecutively to form longer chains. Hence such
reaction is known as “condensation polymerization or step growth polymerization”
which occursthrough similar processeslike nylon or polyesters. Nylon is a repeating
unit linked by amide bonds which is a silky material often known as polyamide. It
is a silky material most often used in clothes formed by consecutive repeating units
linked by amide bonds, mostly attributed as polyamide. This reaction is known as
homopolymerization or copolymerization having a single monomer A-B with two
different end groups or co-monomers A-A and B-B. Small molecules generally get
eliminated in condensation steps in contrast to poly addition reactions.

Condensation polymers require heat and are quite slower than addition polymers
with very lower molecular weight. Many important polymers are formed by such
reactions, for example polyester, various epoxies, and nylon; laboratory chemicals
like polyphosphates and silicates; various biological modifications like terpene syn￾thesis, polyketide synthesis, glycosylation, and phosphorylation are condensation
polymerization.
12.6 Polymerization Method
12.6.1 Homogeneous Polymerization
Often the question arises on how polymers are made up from the monomers.
Chemical reactions between homogeneous and heterogeneous compounds in a
large scale lead to the formation of polymers. The previous system includes solution
and bulk polymerizations, whereas the former encompasses dispersed system, for
example emulsions, suspension with their reverse-phase counterpart, are inverse
suspensions and emulsions. The reason behind the occurrence of homogeneous and
bulk polymerization is because no other materials are used except monomer which
acts as an initiator. When the monomer is water soluble a formation theoretically
can be made of a linear water-soluble polymer. On the other hand, only oil-soluble
monomers make oil-soluble polymers. Astonishingly, sometimes water-swellable12.6 Polymerization Method 285
polymer is prepared from olefinic water-soluble polymer. It causes excessive
exothermic chemical reactions producing heat, resulting in hydrogen detachment
from the polymer backbone, which propels cross-linking chemical reactions at the
incomplete site. The intervention of the cross-linked polymer without using any
chemical cross-linker is popularly known as popcorn polymer and the reaction is
called “popcorn polymerization.”Crospovidone in a solid-dose formulation that
forms a super disintegrant and is a cross-linked polymer of vinyl pyrrolidone which
is obtained from popcorn polymerization. Under certain circumstances when
the monomer is temperature sensitive popcorn polymerization occurs without
the interference of an initiator. The monomer acrylic melting point of monomer
acrylic acid is glacial around 13 ∘C. While storing the monomer at freezing temper￾ature polymerization stabilizer gets unequally distributed between the liquid and
defrost phases. This results in generation of tremendous amount of heat leading
to poor protection of the polymer. On account of the exothermic heat production
alternatively the chemical reaction can be conducted in solution. Owing to the
monomer stability organic solvents or water could be used as solvent or a diluent.
An oil-soluble or a water-soluble polymeris obtained if monomers are water-soluble
or oil-soluble, respectively. In between the neighboring monomer molecules, the
solvents or the diluents reside and they decrease the interactions, respectively.
Therefore, lesser amount of heat gets generated and less exothermic reactions
take place with sustained effects. Polymers are usually soluble in their respective
solvents, but they swell if any crosslinker is incorporated during polymerization.
The cross-linker can be either oil-soluble or water-soluble. Swellability of a polymer
solely depends upon simultaneous interchange ability between oil-soluble and
water-soluble crosslinkers.
12.6.2 Dispersion Polymerization
This type of polymerization occurs mostly in suspensions, inverse emulsions, emul￾sions, and inverse suspension. This type of polymerization involves miscibility of
two contradictory phases like oil and water dispersed into each other. It is divided
into two phases: one is minor (dispersed) another one is critical (continuous). The
active component (monomer) can be either oil-soluble or water-soluble. In a dis￾persed system polymerization is carried out, and the monomer gets dispersed into
the continuous phase using a surfactant. Based upon the nature of the surfactant
the continuous phase is selected. For the dispersion polymerization to be compati￾ble surfactant should be in continuous-phase soluble one. Hence if the continuous
phase is water, then the surfactant is hydrophilic in nature. Similarly, if the contin￾uous phase is oil, then the surfactant nature should by more lipophilicity oriented
for miscibility. Two basic factors govern the dispersion system: one is surface active
agents’ concentration and the other is surface tension parameter. Polymer particle
size is determined by the surfactant concentrations. The system will be an inverse
suspension orsuspension with particle sizesranging from 0.2 to 0.8 mm below CMC
(critical micelle conc.). Above the critical micelle concentration (CMC), sizes rang￾ing from10 to 100 μm particles are formed above the critical micelle concentration.286 12 Organic Polymers and Their Role in Pharmaceutical and Chemical Industries
Sufficient surfactant is required in order to make nanosized particle. In pharmaceu￾tical industry inverse nano emulsion is rarely used due to their stability issue of the
system.
12.7 Polymers and Their Uses in Pharmaceutical
and Chemical Industry
In a conventional process of tablet manufacturing, mostly polymers are used as
binders to bind the excipients. Modern techniques have evolved to such extent
that polymers are used drug delivery, taste masking, controlled release of drugs,
increased bioavailability, and so on. Not only in solid dosage forms but in liquid
dosage forms also polymers play an important role. Polymers help in maintaining
viscosity, stabilize the suspension, and help in the process of granulations for the
solid dosage forms. The enormous application of polymers is usually found in
controlled drug release. In the biomedical field polymers are used as implants for
long-lasting activities. Customized use of polymers is carried out in the pharmaceu￾tical as well as chemical industries. Generally, the desired properties of polymers
are barrier protection, adhesion, gelling, thickening, film forming, pH-dependent
solubility, etc.
Polymers are broadly of two types: water-soluble and water-insoluble ethers with
methyl and hydroxypropyl substitutions are generally water soluble; on the other
hand, cellulose butyrate or phthalate are organic soluble. Hydrocolloid gums are
used when water solubility is desired. Synthetic water-soluble polymers are also
used extensively, for example polyvinyl pyrrolidine, polyethylene glycol, polyethy￾lene glycol vinyl, polyacrylate or polymethacrylate esters, etc. Water-soluble syn￾thetic polymers are polyacrylic, for example in cosmetic, pharmaceuticals, cationic
drug immobilization, and carbopol polymer base. Polyethylene oxide is flocculant,
coagulant, has high molecular weight upto few millions. Polyvinyl pyrrolidine, used
in the manufacture of betadine, has less toxicity, plasma replacement process.
12.8 Polymeric Hydrogels
Polymeric hydrogels consist of self-supporting, water-swollen three-dimensional
(3D) structures and possess viscoelastic network (Omidian et al. 2005). These
materials have the capability of imbibing water or biological fluids up to several
thousand % and swell readily without dissolving due to the presence of hydrophilic
functional groups (carboxyl, amide, amino, and hydroxyl) in their polymeric
chains (Titow et al. 2012). Hydrogels have existed for more than half a century,
providing one of the earliest reports in the literature “by Wichterle and Lim” in
1954–1960, which described a flexible crosslinked structure of poly-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate (pHEMA)-based hydrogel (Hovgaard and Brondsted 1996). Since
then, hydrogel technology has diversified at a large scale, exhibiting good scope for
their applications in the field of biomedical sciences (Basit 2005). Thus, the term12.9 Conclusion and Future Scope 287
hydrogel is self-explanatory in terms of their structure, properties, and applications.
Hydrogels have fascinated materials scientists and biomedical researchers in
terms of their formulations and applications (Omidian et al. 2006; Vandamme
et al. 2002). The swelling properties of hydrogels can be attributed to their higher
thermodynamical affinity toward solvents (Chan et al. 2002), which can be adjusted
as per the requirement through the introduction of various crosslinkers via covalent
bonds or physical interactions through intramolecular and intermolecular attrac￾tions (Dusseault et al. 2006). In addition, these hydrogels show a good capillary
action, osmotic pressure, and water diffusion. Biopolymer (such as chitosan,
starch, guar gum, alginate, etc.)-based hydrogels show desirable biodegradability
and biocompatibility. For example, Vashist et al. (2012) developed biocompatible
interpenetrating network using chitosan, methyl methacrylate (MMA), and oleo
polyol for drug-delivery system. Later, they also reported chitosan, acrylonitrile,
oleo polyol, and MWCNT-based Page 2 nanocomposite hydrogel films, which
exhibits good mechanical strength, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. Noori
et al. (2018) reported clay-dispersed poly(vinyl alcohol) –chitosan-honey based
novel nanocomposite hydrogels for wound dressing applications. These hydrogels
are biocompatible and show antibacterial activity. The concept of smart hydrogels is
associated with their response toward external stimuli including temperature, pH,
ionic concentration, light, magnetic fields, electrical fields, and chemicals. These
features result in an enormous potential for their various advanced technological
applications, for instance, the controlled drug-delivery application, which has
been an area of active research. Many novel hydrogel-based delivery systems
have been fabricated to fulfill the ever-increasing demands of the pharmaceutical
industries. Hydrogels are classified based on their constituents, physical and
chemical structures, various polymeric forms (like homo and co-polymers), blend,
interpenetrating network (IPN), and composites. Their advantages, drawbacks, and
applications are further discussed in proceeding chapters.
12.9 Conclusion and Future Scope
Polymorphism of the molecules can be defined as molecules having the same struc￾ture and varying in the lattice arrangement of crystal solids. Most of the drug sub￾stances are known to exhibit polymorphism. Various polymorphs exhibit chemical
and physical properties, for example chemical reactivity, melting point, and solu￾bility. The solvates/hydrates of the molecules are obtained quite often when the
drug substances encapsulate solvent molecules during crystallization. These sol￾vates/hydrates are referred to as pseudo polymorphs. The main attributes that vary
due to different polymorphic forms, which need to be controlled for the pharmaceu￾tical preparations, are solubility, thermal and kinetic stability ofthe molecules. These
can influence pharmaceutical properties like dissolution rate and bioavailability.
Thereby choosing a polymorphic form of a drug substance that has a desirable solu￾bility,stability, and also circumventing the infringing of patentsis challenging forthe
product development scientist. A few examples of pharmaceutical drug substances288 12 Organic Polymers and Their Role in Pharmaceutical and Chemical Industries
are Cefdinir, Finasteride, Sertaline HCl, Lamivudine, and Nateglinide which exhibit
the polymorphism. Hence a suitable analytical technique should be adapted to iden￾tify/evaluate the different polymorphic forms to get a required polymorphic form
of the drug substance. Different analytical techniques like FT-IR spectroscopy and
X-Ray powder diffraction, FT-Raman spectroscopy, and thermal analysis(DSC/TGA
and hot-stage microscope) have been used to evaluate the different polymorphic
forms of the drug substances.
All the techniques mentioned herein are complementary to each other and to
establish the identity of polymorphic forms, each technique has to be used within
its scope and depends upon the nature of the molecule. Using the techniques
mentioned herein and the proper interpretation of the test results, the identity of
different polymorphic forms of a drug substance can be evaluated and undesirable
polymorphic forms can be quantified. Nowadays Raman spectroscopy has gained
popularity and is among the mostly used technique since past three decades and
with an unbelievable 103 applicationsin the analysis of biological, pharmaceuticals,
and environmental samples. This is the most important aspect of the deficient
Raman scattering property of waterthat makes one to choose it overIR spectroscopy
for analyzing the APIs in the formulation whenever the drug concentration is low.
Different analytical techniques like X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), FT-IR spec￾troscopy, FT-Raman spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (DSC, TGA, and hot-stage
microscope) have been used to evaluate the different polymorphic forms of the
drug substances. X-Ray powder diffraction, both powder diffraction (XRPD) and
single-crystal XRD and X-Ray, were employed for the polymorphism detection;
however, single-crystal XRD demonstrates the crystal structure of certain form and
the XRPD can demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative information. It is not
possible to study the purity of the powder sample using single-crystal XRD which
is very important for the pharmaceutical industry.
In addition, XRPD is unable to demonstrate information at molecular level
and also cannot differentiate the isomorphous solvates, for instance neotame,
erythromycin and aspartame etc. In Antonio et al. (2014) finasteride polymorphic
forms (forms I and II) were identified and investigated in mixtures using the
analytical method Rietveld method (RM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD)
data. With anhydrous polymorphs of finasteride drug, the binary mixture samples
were prepared and analyzed and were assessed in four diffractometers with various
experimental conditions. For drug analysis XRPD is usually used and equipment
represent the foremost resolutions. By subjecting to heat treatment batch of form I
was obtained in pure state and later pure form II was obtained.
Generally, form A is usually found in a polymorphic mixture with form B,
and hence authors 104 studied and characterized using X-ray powder diffraction
(XRPD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermal analysis.
It was found that XPRD method had a broad quantitative range (0–100%), good
linear relationship (R2−0.999), excellent repeatability and precision, low limits
of detection (0.15% (w/w)), and quantification (0.5% (w/w)). Synchrotron X-Ray
powder diffraction (Synchrotron XRPD) was used by Egusa et al. (2017) to deter￾mine the polymorphic differences of pure substance even if the substance is in12.9 Conclusion and Future Scope 289
low concentration in the formulation. Spiriva® inhalation powder (Boehringer
Ingelheim) was used that contains nearly 0.4% (w/w) of the active pharmaceutical
ingredient tiotropium bromide monohydrate in a matrix of α-lactose monohydrate
as excipient. After investigation using XRPD and Synchrotron XRPD, it was known
that the detection limit was around 2–5% (w/w) for tiotropium bromide by the
laboratory XRPD and hence, detection of 0.4% (w/w) tiotropium bromide was
impossible.
Hence, X-Ray powder diffraction is conventional, popular, and most used tech￾nique in the pharmaceutical industry to distinguish the different polymorphic
forms. X-Ray powder diffraction has some limitations like preferred orientation
effect, more sample quantity for analysis, 105 high limits of detection and quan￾tification and same diffraction pattern for different hydrate forms having same
unit cells. FT-IR spectroscopy is a most lucid analytical technique to identify the
different polymorphic forms as it uses the spectral vibration of the molecules. It
could not be used always because of its limitations like the sample preparation
involved and the resolution of peaks. Lin et al. (2010) and Paul et al. (2018) studied
the gabapentin polymorphic transformation involving hot-stage methods of FTIR
microspectroscopy and well demonstrated the one-step polymeric interconversion
induced thermally of gabapentin polymorphic forms (polymorphs I, II, III, and IV)
solids in the three-step temperature ranges. FT-IR spectra for the polymorph forms
I and II of finasteride at room temperature were recorded. After the background
spectrum got recorded, the samples were placed on the particular crystal and data
were recorded 32 scans for each sample with a respective resolution of 4 cm−1 were
observed. The results were well correlated and the IR spectra showed characteristic
bands, respectively. Paczkowska et al. (2018) studied the benzocaine’s physico￾chemical properties and reported their analysis of the polymorphic form utilizing
(C9H11NO2) X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) mediated by FT-IR spectroscopy
combined with DFT calculations. The polymorphs were assembled using cryogenic
grinding, ball milling, and micro milling. The polymorphic forms of benzocaine
bands vibrate and lie between 500 and 2000 cm−1.
In comparison to forms I and II, polymeric form III (FT-IR spectra) exhibits
two bands with intense activity falling in the range 1280–1300 cm−1 pertaining
to C–O, C–C, and C=O stretching vibrations, C–H wagging vibration at 773 cm−1
shows immense low intensity analogous to out-of-plane bending vibration of
the O–C=O bond. Similarly, in our published research work for FT-IR spectra of
lamivudine, similar peaks pattern was observed for both forms I and II and mixture
containing 4% (w/w) the latter, and at the same time no characteristics peaks of
form II were observed in the IR spectrum under (106) pattern. Hence, identification
of form II becomes difficult due to low limit of detection mechanism by FTIR
spectroscopy in 7.3 FT-Raman spectroscopy FT-Raman spectroscopy is emerging as
a powerful technique to identify/quantify and distinguish the different polymorphic
forms. Using laser light excitation method chemical compounds are characterized;
therefore, elastically scattered lights are produced (Rayleigh) and on the other
hand in elastically scattered lights are produced (Raman). The molecular bonding
mechanism is provided and obtained by the spectrum regarding the sample. The290 12 Organic Polymers and Their Role in Pharmaceutical and Chemical Industries
sample required for the analysis of FT-Raman spectroscopy is less in quantity
and reusable. The beta form of mannitol, being a polymorphic excipient, usually
renders a major part in pharmaceutical products, although the alpha and delta are
considerable contaminants.
Roberts et al. (2002) prepared binary mixtures of beta and delta mannitol using
FT-Raman spectroscopy to assess the concentration of the beta form. The spectral
results of IR indicated that 2% low levels of beta form were estimated using this
innovative, harmless approach. Dandeu et al. (2006) well demonstrated the Raman
spectroscopy technique as a dynamic tool for the assessable determination of
polymorphic mixtures of CaCO3 composition, because it exerts excellent spectral
specificity to each crystal structure. Further it is well documented that Raman
spectroscopy has gained much attention among various spectroscopic techniques,
and is an extensively used method for discerning the polymorphic structures owing
to non-invasiveness, for lesser quantity of sample requirement, and respective
specificity. Hence this method involved here helps to recognize numerous physical
forms like tablet, powder, cream, emollient etc. although there are exceptions where
this procedure does not cause Raman scattering in case of some medicines. This
methodology impelled, therefore, polymorphism of Finasteride and Lamivudine
drugs were experimentally studied and compared using Fourier Transform-Raman
spectroscopy in order to exemplify the beneficial aspect of this technique over the
methods. A characteristic peak is observed at 697 and 107 cm−1of lamivudine using
Raman spectroscopic method of analysis, and no significant peaks were detected at
463 and 798 cm−1 which establishes the fact that absence of lamivudine form II at
those peaks.
At certain point 6% (w/w) drug mixture was examined at various time intervals,
for instance 5-, 10-, 15-, and 30-minutes using grinding method to study the
observable effect of grinding on polymorphism and exhibits same peak strength at
798 cm−1 showing Raman shift which suggests the fact that grinding methods do
not necessarily involve polymorphic conversion either for the mixture containing
6% (w/w) of form II in form I or polymorphic forms as well. Hence no observable
differences were concluded by the grinding process for the polymorphic ground
and the mixtures which were prepared using mortar and pestle. Following this
process again form I mixture of components comprising this concentration 4%
(w/w) of form II was studied further using FT-Raman spectra. Various patterns
were observed at 798 cm−1 (Raman Band) attributing to the form II in polymorphic
mixture containing 4% (w/w) of form II in form I. Distinguishable Raman shifts
were observed between the two polymorphic forms of finasteride. When two
polymorphs of finasteride (Antonio et al. 2014) were studied using FT-Raman
analysis the results exhibited due to the Raman shift were visible and distinct
between the two forms. The finasteride forms I, II tablets and placebo were
recorded with Raman spectral analysis. The exceptional difference of the two
polymorph forms showed striking difference in the Raman shift region between
1750 and 1550 cm−1 where placebo interference was not noticed in this region,
and hence this region is profoundly appropriate for discerning and detection of the
polymorphic forms of finasteride in tablets. The form I has a characteristic peakReferences 291
found at 1670 and 1695 cm−1, while form II polymorph peaks were detected at 1656
and 1677 cm−1.
The Raman spectral peak was detected at 1598 cm−1 which was usual for finas￾teride polymorphic forms, and the major characteristic peak of the polymorphic
form I was noted at 1670 cm−1, while the minor characteristic peak was found
at 1695 cm−1. The vital peak of polymorph forms I in form II tablets is used for
detection of the same. The minor form II of polymorph was found at 1677 cm−1,
while the major peak was observed at 1656 cm−1; concomitantly, the major peak
was observed of polymorphic form II in form I tablets. In addition to the above
techniques, differentialscanning calorimeter(DSC) is useful to identify the different
polymorphic forms as it measures the heat flow and temperature of transition of
sample under the controlled temperature. We have studied 108 the differential
scanning calorimeter for finasteride drug and the polymorphic form I exhibits at
around 233 ∘C a solid-solid transition and ultimately melts at 258 ∘C. Therefore,
the polymorph form II melts at around 258 ∘C. Hence the DSC values of the
two forms were well equated with their published values. Thermo gravimetric
analysis (TGA) is useful to identify the different hydrate forms, the loosely bound
water, and the decomposition of the molecules as it measures the weight loss
with respect to temperature. Hot-stage microscope is also used to find out the
thermal behavior of the molecules. It can be used to confirm the thermal events
like melting, evaporation, and decomposition that were obtained from DSC/TGA
studies. All the techniques mentioned herein are complementary to each other
and to establish the identity of polymorphic forms, each technique has to be used
within its scope and depends upon the nature of the molecule. The most significant
aspect is using FT-Raman spectroscopic method to detect the polymorphism in
the final dosage form and is highly suggested due to their advantageous nature;
they are of very less use of analytical sample, lucid sample preparation method,
universally accepted sharp spectral method (Raman), and no sampling problems
were observed in Raman spectroscopy unlike the cumbersome process involved in
X-ray powder diffraction. It is evident that polymorphism in various pharmaceutical
ingredients using FT-Raman spectroscopic methods in lower concentration level
was investigated and correlated accordingly.
12.10 Future Scope
Future studies will corroborate further experiments in the analysis of the specific
polymorphs which will directly help in the drug development thereby enhancing the
efficiency in the manufacturing process by endorsing robust quality and stability of
drug products.

13.1 Introduction
13.1.1 Nutraceutical and Its Global Progression
The Rig Veda says, “For a knowledgeable healer, the herbs rally together akin to an
army of kings” (Saini 2016). There were many historical civilizations,such as ancient
Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and othersthat used herbal products and plantsin treating
and preventing diseases.
In 1989 “The term ‘nutraceutical’ was coined by the Foundation for Innovation,
to describe The realm of biomedical investigation that combines elements of nutri￾tion and pharmaceuticals.” This educational foundation, based in New York, was
established to promote discoveries in medicine (Sharma 2017).
A nutraceutical refers to a substance that can be categorized in the form of food
or as a constituent of food. It is known for its medical or health advantages, such as
preventing and treating illnesses (van Boekel 2022).
The approximately calculated value of the worldwide nutraceuticals market was
determined at USD 454.55 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach USD 493.06 billion
in 2022 (Grand View Research 2021). It is projected that the nutraceuticals market
will experience significant growth over the period from 2021 to 2030. This growth
is anticipated to be at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.0%. By the year
2030, the market is expected to achieve a value of approximately USD 991.09 billion.
Functional food dominates the nutraceuticals market, representing 44.89% of its
total value in 2021. It is projected to grow significantly at a robust CAGR of 9.3%
until 2030.

Not only Cargill but also Incorporated as well as Nestle S. A are the prominent
players available in the market. Along with them, Company of Archer Daniels Mid￾land as well as Amway Corporation are also present in the market.
The growth of the nutraceutical market is primarily fueled by several key factors.
One of these factorsisthe positive perception and outlook toward medical nutrition.
Additionally, the rising utilization of nutraceuticals for addressing cardiovascular
disorders and malnutrition also contributes to market expansion. Sports drinks
are becoming increasingly popular among athletes and other individuals who are
physically active and engaged in strenuous activities. The sports drinks market is
propelled by the millennial generation, who possess significant purchasing power,
a strong inclination toward health products, a keen interest in sports, and an
increasing preference for fitness-related activities.
There is an anticipated substantial growth in the functional foods category of
11.4% between 2021 and 2030. This is primarily due to an increasing desire for
healthy food choices and a shift in preference toward solutions for managing
weight. The functional food sector is predicted to see rapid growth, driven by its
potential to enhance immune system and serve as a preventative health supplement
(Grand View Research 2021).
13.1.2 Classification of Nutraceuticals
Nutraceuticals can be classified in various ways, based on their source, mode of
action, and chemical nature (Zaki 2014). For instance, natural food products are
a common source of nutraceuticals, whereas pharmacological mechanisms are
employed to categorize nutraceuticals according to their mode of action. Addition￾ally, nutraceuticals may be classified as water-soluble or lipid-soluble, depending
on their chemical nature. More recently, a further classification has been proposed
to further characterize nutraceuticals illustrated in Figure 13.1 (Sharma 2017; Helal
et al. 2019; Kalia 2005; Kokate et al. 2002).
13.1.3 Nutraceutical and Its Challenges in Delivery
Nutraceuticals possess a multitude of therapeutic benefits and play a signifi￾cant role in the prevention or postponement of various age-related conditions.
These conditions include osteoporosis, cancer, metabolic disorders, heart-related
disorders, cataracts, and neurological disorders. Notably, nutraceuticals exhibit
exceptional anti-fatigue properties, further enhancing their effectiveness in com￾bating these ailments (González-Sarrías et al. 2013). Creating effective delivery
methods for additives and dietary supplements is a complex task with various
obstacles. Properly delivering specific types of food components necessitates the
development of solutions that relies on a thorough understanding of the essential
properties of the active core, enabling the formulation of comprehensive and
effective solutions. This involves examining its interactions with the surrounding
environment and its role within food throughout the stages of processing, storage,
consumption. Additionally, it entails assessing how the delivery format, such as13.1 Introduction 295

powder, solution, or emulsion, affects its functionality (Augustin and Sanguansri
2012). Most nutraceutical products are taken orally; however, there are apprehen￾sions regarding the development, absorption into the body, and targeted delivery
of these substances. The primary challenges to delivering nutraceuticals orally
are their unstable nature, poor absorption, and the difficulty of targeting them
to the desired location. To overcome these obstacles, researchers have developed
a variety of broad strategies tailored to each specific nutraceutical, and the most
frequently used technique involves enhancing their solubility. Recently, nanosiz￾ing techniques have been employed to improve nutraceutical delivery, showing
encouraging results in protecting and stabilizing these substances on the shelf
and in the body, increasing their solubility and ability to dissolve, improving their
permeability in the intestines, and targeting them to intracellular and subcellular
organelles while also prolonging their circulation half-life. The primary focus of
this chapter is on the progress and obstacles in orally delivering nutraceuticals,
emphasizing the potential of polymeric strategies to overcome these challenges
(Zaki 2014).296 13 Current Trends in Organic Polymers and Nutraceutical Delivery
13.2 Current Advancements in the Polymeric Delivery
System for Nutraceuticals
13.2.1 Polymers Used in Different Nutraceutical Delivery
13.2.1.1 Synthetic Polymers
Poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) PCL is a potential biodegradable polymer for devel￾opment of extended-period delivery systems of medicines due to its flexibility,
production simplicity, relatively slow breakdown rate, and biocompatibility. The
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval for the utilization of
PCL in various applications within the human body, such as sutures, adhesion
barriers, and drug-delivery devices. PCL can be described as a partially crystalline
polyester possessing a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 54 ∘C, a melting point of
55–60 ∘C, and high solubility in organic solvents (Patlolla et al. 2010). In particular,
when compared to other polymers, PCL exhibits a slower rate of biodegradation, it
hasthe potential to produce implantable drug-delivery systems capable of delivering
medications over prolonged durations. A commercial implantable contraceptive
pill called CapronormTM uses PCL to release levonorgestrel slowly over the course
of a year before being removed from the body by bioerosion in two to three years
(Sinha et al. 2016). Curcumin, also known as diferuloylmethane, is a naturally
occurring yellow compound obtained from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, which
is typically known as turmeric and belongs to the Zingiberaceae plant family.
Curcumin has an anti-inflammatory activity, it can scavenge free radicals as well
as reactive oxygen species (ROS). This capability is significant as these harmful
substances are associated with the development of various diseases, including
cardiovascular diseases (CVD), neurological disorders, and diabetes. Bioavailability
of curcumin is low due to its lipophilic nature, extensive metabolism, low water
solubility, and chemical instability. Using nanocarriers could be a way to overcome
the aforementioned difficulties. Nanocarriers might increase the bioavailability
and therapeutic potency of curcumin. Resveratrol is an inherent polyphenolic
compound that occurs naturally, is prominently present in grapes, peanuts, and red
wine (Nair et al. 2010). These are some of the benefits: it can prevent or fight cancer,
kill or prevent the growth of microbes, protect the nervous system, slow down the
aging process, reduce inflammation, shield the heart from damage, and regulate
blood sugar levels (Salehi et al. 2018). In vivo, its efficacy is compromised due to
unfavorable biopharmaceutical attributes like limited solubility, rapid metabolism,
and chemical instability, rendering it ineffective (Zupanciˇ cˇ et al. 2015). PCL has
its advantageous properties, including biodegradability, a slow rate of degradation,
excellent drug permeability, and low toxicity, it is a viable material for designing
nanocarrier-based systems. PCL is a polymer that possesses both biodegradable and
biocompatible properties that has also shown sustained drug release kinetics and is
used to produce nanofibers (Zupanciˇ cˇ et al. 2015). PCL exhibits improved cellular
absorption, regulated payload release, and greater stability in vivo. PCL seems
to be an appropriate option for encapsulation purposes of lipophilic compounds
like curcumin due to its increased hydrophobic character (Tinca et al. 2020), and13.2 Current Advancements in the Polymeric Delivery System for Nutraceuticals 297
Resveratrol is also incorporated into PCL. Due to their low gingival fluid flow and
gradual release, the resveratrol-loaded PCL nanofibers will supply resveratrol for
treating periodontal disease for a longer period of time (Zupanciˇ cˇ et al. 2015).
Poly(lactide) (PLA) Drug-delivery systemsfrequently use PLA, a synthetic biodegrad￾able aliphatic polyester. PLA is a non-toxic, thermoplastic polymer with exceptional
strength, modulus, with no harmful side effects. a study by Luzuriaga et al. (2018)
developed microneedles (MNs) for transdermal drug delivery with biodegradable
PLA-based.
A dietary flavonoid called quercetin, is found in many fruits, green leafy vegeta￾bles, seeds, nuts, buckwheat, flowers, barks, olive oil, broccoli, apples, and berries.
It possesses anti-inflammatory properties, helps lower blood pressure, promotes
vasodilation, aids in weight management, reduces high cholesterol levels, and
exhibits anti-atherosclerotic effects. The substance doesn’t dissolve well in hot
water, but it dissolves fairly well in alcohol and fats. However, it doesn’t dissolve
at all in cold water. Before reaching the systemic circulation, quercetin exhibits
low permeability, instability, and significant first-pass metabolism as a result of
these characteristics. So, encapsulating this chemical on suitable nanocarriers is
one of the successful solutions to these issues. PLA is a popular biodegradable
polymeric nanoparticle used to encapsulate a variety of medicinal medicines.
Biodegradability, biocompatibility, high hydrophobicity, great mechanical strength,
and gradual drug release are just a few of the many qualities that PLA possesses.
In order to improve the antioxidant quercetin’s poor water solubility and stability,
the solvent evaporation method has been utilized to encapsulate it within PLA
nanoparticles. A study shows that quercetin-loaded PLA nanoparticles are an
excellent prospect for the ongoing development of nanomedicines due to their high
encapsulation efficiency, tiny size, and steady release (Tefas et al. 2015).
Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) PLGA is a copolymer composed of lactide and gly￾colide, which is both biocompatible and biodegradable. This polymer has obtained
FDA approval for its application in the pharmaceutical field. It finds extensive uti￾lization in the development of drug-delivery systems and is the most commonly
used polymer for this purpose. The composition of the copolymer determines the
shape that PLGA takes, and it is made by copolymerizing lactic and glycolic acid
monomers, which are both aliphatic polyesters (Makadia and Siegel 2011).
PLGA has proven to be an effective drug-delivery medium because of its good bio￾compatibility, physiological degradability, and controlled release.
A formulation of biodegradable nanoparticles comprising poly(lactide-co-gly￾colide) (PLGA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) stabilizer was employed to
encapsulate curcumin with an exceptional bioavailability enhancement, achieving
an efficiency of 97.5%. A study found that in vitro, encapsulated curcumin showed
a significantly higher cellular absorption, suppressed the proliferation of different
types of cancer cells, suppressing NF-kB activation than curcumin (Punfa et al.
2012).298 13 Current Trends in Organic Polymers and Nutraceutical Delivery
One of the most significant plant flavanols is quercetin, which has a variety of
pharmacological and biological applications. Quercetin’s notable biological proper￾ties are hindered by its poor water solubility, limiting its efficacy in treating various
disorders. Due to quercetin’s extreme hydrophobicity and low cell absorption and
retention, its use has been restricted. Alternative methods, including developing
nanoformulations or combining phytochemicals with nanoparticles, can enhance
the water solubility, bioavailability, and targeted delivery of phytochemicals to the
tumor location, which improves their therapeutic potential. A study demonstrated
that PLGA-quercetin nanoparticles have greater efficacy than quercetin on cervical
and breast cancer cells.
Thymoquinone, a lipophilic phytochemical with a benzoquinone base, exhibits
remarkable anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor characteristics. Due to its water
insolubility, its use is restricted. In addition, excessive doses of thymoquinone have
been given to rats, which have led to hypoactivity and breathing difficulties linked
to decrease glutathione levels in the liver and kidney (Ganea et al. 2010). Similarly,
Resveratrol is also more stable, water soluble when it is encapsulated in PLGA
nanoparticle. It reduces lipogenesis and hepatocellular proliferation, and promotes
lipolysis. To treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), RSV-PLGA-NPs can
considerably improve stability, solubility, and bioactivity.
Daidzein (4′
,7-dihydroxylisoflavone) is an isoflavone that is not water soluble
and poor lipophilic compound, used for hypertension, coronary heart disease, and
menopausal syndrome. Daidzein has a very low oral bioavailability, which reduces
its therapeutic impact. Incorporation into PLGA nanoparticle daidzein, showed
improved oral bioavailability (Ma et al. 2012).
Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) PVP, which is also referred to as polyvidone or povidone,
is a biodegradable polymer that originates from N-vinylpyrrolidone monomer. This
water-soluble polymeris hydrophilic and hasremarkable solubility in polarsolvents.
PVP possesses binding properties and can stabilize suspensions and emulsions. As
far as the system of delivery of drugs is concerned, the application of PVP has been
found to be crucial, especially in pharmaceutical as well as biomedicalsectors, where
it has been employed for oral, topical, transdermal, and ocular administration. In
addition, PVP has proven useful in gene delivery.
β-carotene is a molecule that lacks polarity and has a long chain of double bonds
and unsaturated structures, which makes it highly vulnerable to damage from
light and heat. To prevent its degradation, researchers have explored the use of
electrospinning technology to encapsulate β-carotene. In order to create composite
nanofibers, involving PVP as well as β-carotene, researchers have developed a finer
method. These composite nanofibers are exceedingly known for their antioxidant
properties. This electrospinning-based encapsulation method has the potential to
protect β-carotene and preserve its beneficial properties (Kurakula and Rao 2020).
Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC) Those derivatives of cellulose ethers in
which one or greater number of the hydroxypropyl groups available in the cellu￾lose ring have been substituted with hydroxyl groups constitutes hydroxypropyl13.2 Current Advancements in the Polymeric Delivery System for Nutraceuticals 299
methylcellulose or HPMC. Besides being a hydrophilic (water soluble) polymer,
HPMC is not only biodegradable but also biocompatible.
The release kinetics of pharmaceuticals are impacted by their high swellability.
The polymethoxylated flavone (PMF) nobiletin (3′
,4′
,5,6,7 and 8-hexamethoxy￾flavone) is multihydroxylated polyphenolic molecule. They possess numerous
prospective advantages in health, starting from their anti-carcinogenic along
to their anti-atherosclerotic activities. PMFs are also known to possess several
anti-inflammatory actions as well. When utilized as nutraceuticals in various
foods, PMFs have several issues owing to their greater melting points, inadequate
solubility in water, and lesser bioavailability.
HPMC contains polar and non-polar groups on its structure, allowing it to
form both hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds, both within its own molecule and
between other molecules. When HPMC is dissolved, its intramolecular bonds are
broken, which can lead to the creation of new hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds
with drugs, causing a delay in their precipitation. The consequence of HPMC
on the storage and discharge of nobiletin, a hydrophobic nutraceutical, which
is confined within a delivery system based on nanoemulsion, has been explored
in a recent study. In order to stabilize nobiletin’s supersaturated state, HPMC
and thermal treatment were included thereby postponing its crystallization as
well as the precipitation which is obtained from the nanoemulsions (Chen et al.
2015).
Ethyl Cellulose (EC) Additive manufacturing pharmaceuticals have been found to
utilize thermoplastic polymer, like ethyl cellulose (EC), insoluble in water and
derived from cellulose and contains some hydroxyl (–OH) functional groups in
place of ethoxy groups (–O–CH2–CH3). The Tg of EC is roughly 130 ∘C. Depending
on the molecular weight of the polymer, it possesses a melting point of approx￾imately 180 ∘C. Apart from having great mechanical strength, EC has immense
film-forming capacity along with flexibility as well as transparency.
A natural vitamin A derivative known as retinoic acid (RA) is regarded as a
chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic drug. Patients who develop RA resis￾tance compromise the effectiveness of therapy. Additionally, it has been reported
that due to ongoing, recurrent oral RA administration, the concentration of this
retinoid in patients’ plasma has decreased further and their blood RA half-life
has significantly decreased. To improve the treatment of acute promyelocytic
leukemia, it is crucial to include RA into suitable carrier-based modes of delivery
for its slow and continuous release. EC and PEG, two synthetic polymers, were
taken into consideration while formulating microparticle compositions for RA oral
administration and regulated gastrointestinal absorption.
EC-based nanoparticle was formulated to encapsulate gamma oryzanol (GO), an
antioxidant which is notsoluble in water. Without altering the quality of products, it
has been applied several times to fortify liquid food products. On delivering through
3D-hydrogels and core–shell nanoparticles,the bioavailability of two powerfully syn￾ergistic nutraceuticals, i.e. resveratrol as well as curcumin, increases considerably.300 13 Current Trends in Organic Polymers and Nutraceutical Delivery
The co-axial electrospraying method was used to create core–shell nanoparticlesthat
included both bioactive in a zein core that was encased in a shell made of either PEG
or EC (Leena et al. 2021).
13.2.1.2 Natural Polysaccharides
The attributes of natural polysaccharides such as biocompatibility, biodegradability,
low immunogenicity,renewability, and ease of modification make them highly desir￾able as potential optionsfor innovative drug-delivery systems. Polysaccharide-based
nanocarriers are versatile tools with broader applications in different domains such
as therapeutics, diagnostics along with safeguarding/delivering the bioactive sub￾stances or medications. The emphasis of research ought to be on the advancement
of polysaccharide nanoparticles and the encouragement of their utilization in
numerous areas, with a particular emphasis on the field of biomedicine (Qiu et al.
2022).
Chitosan Numerous polymers are found in the cell walls of fungi. Among those,
chitin is a polymer which is found in the cellular walls of fungi as well as the shells,
mainly the outer ones in case of numerous arthropods, such as crustaceans and
insects. Its structure consists of a linear chain with units of 2-acetylamino-2-deoxy￾β-D-glucopyranose interconnected to each other with the help of β-1,4 linkages.
Chitosan, which is a natural cationic polysaccharide that can be easily obtained in
large quantities from chitin, is not only non-toxic but also possesses biocompatible
properties and are enzymatically biodegradable. Owing to the presence of the
amino groups, they can be utilized as a bioadhesive, attaching to those mucosal
cells which are negatively charged in order to increase the retention as well as
their transit into cells. Additionally, chitosan has relatively low immunogenicity. In
addition to promoting epithelial tight junction opening and enlarging paracellular
routes, chitosan’s positive charge facilitates this transport and aids in the delivery
of medicines, particularly hydrophilic and high-molecular-weight compounds
(Elieh-Ali-Komi and Hamblin 2016; Chinnaiyan 2019).
Hyaluronic Acid D-glucuronic acid along with the units of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
are the manufacturing blocks of hyaluronic acid, and is held strongly together by
beta-1,4 and beta-1,3 glycosidic linkages. Typically, this molecule has a high molec￾ular weight and tends to be negatively charged in the body. It has been found to
be effective in treating both acute and chronic forms of gingivitis and periodontitis.
Numerousresearch studies have revealed several beneficial properties of hyaluronic
acid,such asits anti-inflammatory property along with its anti-edematous as well as
anti-bacterial property thereby helping to combat microorganisms found in plaque
located beneath the gums (Alipoor et al. 2022). Extensive research has been con￾ducted on the possibility of hyaluronic acid being a carrier of the drug mainly in
the case of dental care by developing micro- and nanoparticles loaded with drugs.
Therefore, hyaluronic acid has emerged as a promising option for delivering drugs
in dental treatment (Fallacara et al. 2018).13.2 Current Advancements in the Polymeric Delivery System for Nutraceuticals 301
Dextran The polysaccharide known as dextran is composed of D-glucose, where it
is linked by a-(1->6) bonds, as well as branches of D-glucose linked by a-(1->4),
a-(1->3), or a-(1->2) bonds.
It is produced in the presence of sucrose by a type of bacteria or its enzymes,
called the lactic acid bacteria. Dextran nanocarriers have the potential to enhance
the dissolution capacity of various drugs and also improve the GI membrane perme￾ability. Dextran, which can only be broken down by the enzyme dextranase found
mainly in the large intestine, liver,spleen, or kidney, is more resistant to degradation
by enzymes such as salivary amylase or malt amylase than other kinds of polysac￾charides. Owing to this, the delivery systems of drugs which are based on dextrans
provide a promising approach to protect drugs from degradation by stomach acids
or small intestinal enzymes, improving their oral bioavailability and increasing the
likelihood that they will be absorbed by the intestinal epithelium (Hu et al. 2021).
Cellulose Cellulose, a common biopolymer present in a wide range of plants, bacte￾ria, algae, and fungi and connected together by -1,4 glycosidic bonds to form a chain
of D-glucopyranosyl units, serves as a crucial structural component. It is frequently
taken from the main cell walls of these species because it is the most prevalent
biopolymer on the globe (Lynd et al. 2002).Itis well known that chitosan hasremark￾able physical, mechanical, and chemical qualities in the field of medicine, as well
as high biocompatibility, great biodegradability, lower toxicity, and is generally rec￾ognized as safe (GRAS). This makes it a viable option for effectively trapping and
delivering drugs.
For the nanoencapsulation of drugs, numerous modified celluloses such as
cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC) as well as car￾boxymethyl cellulose (CMC) are available. Different disease targets can benefit
from the use of these celluloses. Not only one-dimensional nanofibers micropar￾ticles, two-dimensional films, been made of nanocellulose but three-dimensional
hydrogels as well as aerogels have all been made using nanocellulose for several
different purposes. These structures can be employed for the delivery of drug,
curing of wounds, and also in tissue engineering. Materials, which are created
from nanocellulose, have garnered considerable interest because they are easy to
chemically modify, have a large surface area, are biocompatible, and can naturally
degrade (Liu et al. 2015).
Alginic Acid Alginate is a type of natural, water-soluble polysaccharide that is
obtained from the cellular walls of several varieties of brown algae. This polymer
consists of blocks of mannuronic and guluronic acids, which can be arranged in
a homogeneous or heterogeneous pattern. When in interaction with specific bi￾as well as trivalent cations (such as Al3+, Ba2+, Sr2+, or Ca2+), the carboxylate
groups present on the blocks of guluronate on the backbone of Alginate polymer,
cross-link with each other and form gels. Additionally, gels can be formed through
hydrogen bonding in acidic environments. Alginate is biodegradable, non-harmful,
and biocompatible, making it suitable for the utilization in drug-delivery vehicles
and numerous other oral insulin nanoparticles. The polymers, being flexible, can302 13 Current Trends in Organic Polymers and Nutraceutical Delivery
be molded into biomaterial forms, like fibers, films, sponges, and injectable gels, as
well as nano, micro, and bead particles. Alginate has gained popularity recently as
a material for nanomedicine delivery systems, either on its own or in combination
with other polysaccharides including chitosan, pectin, along with carrageenan to
treat a variety of ailments (Abka-Khajouei et al. 2022).
Pectin Natural polysaccharide pectin can be described as hydrophilic, anionic, and
linearin nature.It is composed of D-galacturonic acid connected to – (1-4)linkages of
glycosidic bonds (Chinnaiyan 2019). An important component that affects the prop￾erties of pectin isthe degree of methylation (DM). According to DM and the number
of methoxyl groups, high methoxyl pectin (HMP), having more than 50% methylated
carboxyl groups, along with low methoxyl pectin (LMP), which has lesser methyla￾tion, are typically divided into two primary categories. Pectin has been thought of
being a potential carrier in the process of nanoencapsulation. It has the property to
prevent pharmaceuticals from proteolysis by enzymes and increases the capacity of
nanoparticles thereby helping them to pass through the upper gastrointestinal sys￾tem intact by acting as a protease inhibitor. In the intestine, pectinolytic enzymes
from the colonic microflora break it down and absorb it as a colon-specific medica￾tion delivery. These features make pectin essential forthe creation of a colon-specific
controlled delivery system.
13.2.2 Different Nutraceutical Delivery Systems
13.2.2.1 Liposomes
Phospholipids are the building blocks of liposomes. They are amphiphilic molecules
with a hydrophilic head along with a hydrophobic tail.In the phospholipid molecule,
two fatty acid chains, each having 10–24 carbon atoms and 0–6 double bonds, make
up its hydrophobic region. The majority of the hydrophilic component is composed
of phosphoric acid bound to a water-soluble molecule. They position themselves in
such a manner so that the polar head group faces the aqueous region and the fatty
acid groups face each other when dispersed in aqueous media, thereby resulting in
spherical and vesicle-like structures called the liposomes (Cheng et al. 2022; Kalepu
et al. 2013).
According to the number as well as the size of the bilayers, liposomes are catego￾rized (shown in Figure 13.2). On the basis of theirsize and structures, liposomes can
be classified as multilamellar vesicles (MLV) as well as large and small unilamellar
vesicles (LUV and SUV).
According to their chemical composition, they can also be categorized as con￾ventional liposomes (CL), pH-sensitive, cationic, immune, and long-circulating
liposomes (LCL) (Sandeep 2013). Quercetin may be able to delay the progress
of several carcinogenic cells, including the cells of many organs like colorectal,
prostate as well as liver. The pancreatic, breast, kidney, and lung cells along with
the ovarian cancer cells are also delayed via altering a number of cellular processes.
Before reaching the systemic circulation, quercetin exhibits low permeability,
instability, and significant first-pass metabolism as a result of these characteristics.
So, encapsulating this chemical on appropriate nanocarriers is a highly fruitful13.2 Current Advancements in the Polymeric Delivery System for Nutraceuticals 303

solution to solve these issues. In vitro, quercetin-containing liposomes in ovarian
cancer models caused cell-cycle arrest, triggered apoptosis, and decreased cell
growth (Vafadar et al. 2020).
Curcumin: When the pH of the solution exceeds 5, curcumin becomes unstable,
and as the pH rises, its rate of disintegration accelerates significantly. The effects of
curcumin-encapsulated liposomes on cancer cells are more pronounced and have
a proapoptotic and growth-inhibitory effect. Numerous malignancies have been
examined using curcumin liposomes (such as cancer of the lung, cervix, breast
along with liver cancer, osteosarcoma). Curcumin’s anticancer and pharmacological
properties can be enhanced by liposomes. By enhancing the pharmacokinetic as
well as the pharmacodynamic outcomes, liposomes lower the doses needed to end
the tumor.
Like other polyphenols, Resveratrol possesses lower bioavailability as a result
of poor absorption, fast metabolism of glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites,
and subsequent excretion of these substances. Many studies showed the viability
and effectiveness of using resveratrol-loaded liposomes to specifically target cancer
cells. On tumor growth and volume, resveratrol-encapsulated liposomes had a
potent inhibitory effect.
Similar to other forms of polyphenols, anthocyanin exhibits anti-inflammatory
and anticancer properties on a range of cancer cell lines. Anthocyanins are affected
by environmental elementssuch as pH, temperature along with light, oxygen as well
as enzymes. Additionally, their bioavailability is low, thereby lowering their effec￾tiveness. A study examined the effects of liposome-encapsulated anthocyanin from
Hibiscus sabdariffa on the A375 melanoma cell line to improve their stability. This
method thus markedly reduced the amount of melanin in the melanocytes of the
cell line.
The most frequent and physiologically active catechin in green tea is
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is an ester of epigallocatechin as
well as gallic acid. The chemopreventive effect of EGCG is well supported by
research on cancers of the breast, duodenum, and prostate. It also supports cancers
of the colon, skin cancer, lung along with cervical and liver cancers. Individuals304 13 Current Trends in Organic Polymers and Nutraceutical Delivery
rarely drink much green tea in daily life, and this substance has a poor bioavail￾ability. Only 0.2–2% of the initial amount of ingested EGCG remains in the body.
Majority of the absorption takes place mainly in the small intestine, and then it
is broken down with the help of several bacteria residing in the large intestine.
Integrating EGCG into liposomes is one way to enhance EGCG’s effects, better
stability, prolonged release, and higher intracellular concentration of EGCG when
it was encapsulated in liposomes, it can also limit enzymatic breakdown (Enaru
et al. 2021).
13.2.2.2 Solid-Lipid Nanoparticle
The solid-lipid nanoparticles(SLNs), which are composed of a lipid matrix and have
ultimate particle sizes ranging from 50 to 1000 nm, were introduced in the early
1990s. They were created to address issues with conventional unstable colloidal
systems like polymeric particles, emulsions, and lipospheres. With advantages like
excellent tolerability, regulated medication release and drug targeting, the ability to
incorporate hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. Because of the reduction in particle
size and the use of harmless materials, SLNs are one of the most commonly used
systems today.
The protection of phytochemical compounds during digestion with enhanced
absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and precise transport to the targeted
sites are all possible benefits of using SLNs to enhance bioavailability.
Many drugs’ high first-pass metabolism is the primary cause of their low oral
bioavailability. According to studies, SLNs may also demonstrate bio-adhesion to the
GIT wall, lengthening their stay there, boosting bioavailability, and diminishing or
eliminating irregular absorption.
Recent experimental bioavailability studies on SLNsshowed promising outcomes.
To improve the bioavailability of phytonutrients such as a substance known as
quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, and puerarin solid lipid nanoparticles have
been employed as drug-delivery medium. Curcumin is poorly soluble in water,
and is less bioavailable, it is rapidly broken down by hepatic enzymes system
(cytochrome P450) in individuals. Curcumin can be encapsulated into SLNs,
nanoemulsions, and PLGA nanoparticles, increasing its oral bioavailability by
more than twofold. Male Wistar rats were given both free and nanoresveratrol
orally (daily for 14 days) in the form of 5 mg kg−1 body weight, and nanoresver￾atrol considerably elevated the rat tissue resveratrol concentrations by more
than double, when compared to free resveratrol. Since puerarin has a poor
solubility and a shorter half-life, its use as a cardioprotective agent is severely
constrained. Oral absorption of puerarin has yet not been formulated, and repeated,
high-dose intravenous administration may cause severe, acute adverse effects.
Puerarin-loaded SLNs had a 300% improvement in oral bioavailability following
a single intragastric dose. The research listed above strongly supports the idea
that SLNs can be effectively employed as drug carriers, notably for phenolic
chemicals, overcoming the disadvantages associated with oral bioavailability
problems.13.2 Current Advancements in the Polymeric Delivery System for Nutraceuticals 305

13.2.2.3 Phytophospholipid
The term “phyto” refers to a plant, whereas “some” refers to a cell-like structure.
The phytosomes method creates a tiny cell that prevents gastric fluids and intestinal
microbesfrom destroying the plant extract or active ingredient. Thisis because phos￾phatidylcholine has gastro-protective properties. The primary distinction between
liposomes and phytosomes is the fact that the active substance in liposomes is dis￾solved in the media contained in the cavity or folds that make up the membrane. In
phytosomes, on the other hand, the therapeutic ingredient is chemically bonded to
the polar head of the phospholipid (shown in Figure 13.3) (Karimi et al. 2015).
A research was conducted on silybin phytosome. This included 232 patients suf￾fering from chronic hepatitis caused by a virus, alcohol, or narcotics. These patients
were provided with silybin phytosome at a dose of 120 mg twice or three times each
day for up to 120 days. The study found that the liver function of treated patients
recovered to normal faster than the control group. Grape seed phytosomes, which
are composed of oligomeric polyphenols complexed with phospholipids of varying
molecular sizes, were prepared and found to increase the total antioxidant capac￾ity, activate physiological antioxidant defenses in plasma, and beyond their strong
antioxidant potency, they considerably protect the cardiovascular system and other
organs via a network of mechanisms.
A study reported that the complex’s antioxidant activity of curcumin phytosome
was noticeably greater than that of pure curcumin at all tested dose levels. On the
other hand, the naringenin phytosome provided stronger free radical scavenging
activity than the free molecule with a longer half-life (Kumar et al. 2009).
13.2.2.4 Biphasic System
The biphasic drug-delivery system is a novel drug-delivery device for oral adminis￾tration with two layers: a fast-release layer and a sustained-release layer. To create306 13 Current Trends in Organic Polymers and Nutraceutical Delivery
formulations for controlled and sustained release, the layered tablet concept is
used, and it is intended to release the medication at two different rates. Traditional
sustained-release dosage forms do not allow for a quick start to action following
oral administration and delayed drug release. Due to the rapid rise in drug plasma
concentration caused by the quick release of the drug from the fast layer, this
layer tablet has a pharmacokinetic advantage over conventional dosage forms.
This is because the sustained-release layer continues to release the drug after the
quick-release layer (Preetha et al. 2015).
13.2.2.5 Self-emulsifying Delivery Systems
Pouton observed SEDS for the initial time back in 1982. He discovered the bright
side of these delivery methods which include bettersolubility, greater bioavailability,
increased absorption by the system of lymphocytes, and increased P-gp efflux. Basi￾cally, these are isotropic combinations of emulsifiers, lipids, and biologically active
substancesthat may or may not also contain cosolvents or co-emulsifiers. These were
basically classified depending upon their dispersion with a diameter of droplets up
to a couple of microns, and SEDS have been broadly categorized. If the droplet size
of the distribution is between 100 and 250 nm, the SEDS are commonly referred to
as SMEDS, and if they are below 100 nm, they are alluded to as SNEDS.
Self-emulsifying delivery systems (SEDS), which are similar to many other
lipid-based delivery systems, are one such innovative successfully implemented
technology evaluated for oral delivery. To ensure their optimal distribution, a
range of nutraceuticals have been created in the form of many different SEDS
using diverse blends of excipients. Taking the self-emulsifying vitamin E formu￾lation only once led to a faster and more significant absorption than the usual
vitamin E formulation, which is marketed as soft gelatin capsules. The antiox￾idant coenzyme Q10, which has poor solubility and bioavailability, is utilized
for the management of heart conditions, such as angina pectoris. Its uses are
therefore constrained. Coenzyme Q10 was delivered using SEDS, and an optimized
formulation made up of Labrasol (50%) and Lauroglycol (10%) was developed
in addition to Myvacet 9-45 (40%). In comparison to the standard formulation,
this formulation’s increased bioavailability indicates that SEDS can be used to
successfully improve the oral absorption of medicinesthat are lipophilic (Kommuru
et al. 2001).
Pueraria lobata isoflavone was developed as SMEDS to make it easier to dissolve
and bioavailable. When using SMEDS to dissolve the bioactive compound in vitro, a
threefold increase in solubility was seen compared to when using tablets. SMEDS
of puerarin, a molecule of protein having advantageous effects on the heart and
against diabetes, were designed to accomplish their oral formulation. After oral dos￾ing, puerarin was found to have a 24.8% absolute bioavailability in beagle dogs. This
demonstrated SEDS’s efficacy in successfully delivering this protein molecule via
oral route. Another study recorded, an in vivo investigation, through passive diffu￾sion across lipid membranes, curcumin from SMEDS was absorbed (Zhongfa et al.
2012).13.3 Scope of Developing New Polymeric Nutraceutical Delivery 307
13.3 Scope of Developing New Polymeric Nutraceutical
Delivery
13.3.1 Enhanced Medication Delivery Method Brought About by the
Presence of Chitosan on Nanoparticle Surfaces
Chitosan possesses the capacity to foster mucoadhesion, open tight junctions, and
induce positive or negative interactions. Due to these properties, researchers have
tried coating lipid as well as polymeric-based nanoparticles with chitosans in order
to enhance drug delivery and nutraceuticals. When the nanoparticles are coated
with chitosan, an improvement is seen in their physiochemical stability. Chitosan
also enhances the interactions between cells and tissues, controlled release of
drugs, and bioavailability of and efficiency of active substances (Elkomy et al.
2022). This can provide very promising results in the upcoming future and will be
effective in ocular, oral, nasal, mucosal, pulmonary, and gene drug delivery (shown
in Figure 13.4) (Garg et al. 2019).
13.3.2 Addition of Protein Nanohydrogels in the Drug-Delivery System
A distinctive three-dimensional interconnected network of polymers is seen in
hydrogels, allowing them to absorb more water and bodily fluids without dissolving.
Protein nanohydrogels function as a storage space for drugs and other bioactive
substances. Bioactive chemical release patterns can be modified by manipulating
various factors such as the type and concentration of protein, interaction with other

polymer systems, pH, ionic concentration, and other physicochemical influences
from outside (Chander et al. 2021).
Nanogels have been utilized in the management of various illnesses, includ￾ing carcinoma. In an investigation, Where recombinant murine interleukin-12
(IL-12) was subcutaneously injected into animals with subcutaneous fibrosarcoma
combined with the nanogel of cholesteryl pullulan. The incorporation of active
substances such as cells, peptides, biomolecules, and drugs into protein hydrogels
shields them from the hostile environment. The use of nanogels that are loaded
with active substances can alter the thixotropic property of the body at physiological
pH and body temperature, leading to a prolonged increase in IL-12 levels and the
inhibition of tumor growth. Protein hydrogels have numerous potential applications
and should be investigated in various fields, including the delivery of bioactive
compounds (Chander et al. 2021; Nandi et al. 2020).
13.3.3 Supersaturating Drug-Delivery System
A supersaturating medication delivery system is a promising idea for improving
oral bioavailability. To achieve intraluminal concentrations above the drug’s
saturation solubility, the drug is in a high-energy form in SDSS (Brouwers et al.
2009).
To amplify the capacity of less water-soluble medication to be absorbed orally,
one can make use of supersaturated drug-delivery systems (SDDSs). Amorphous
solid dispersions (ASDs), nanoparticulate systems, and lipid-based delivery systems
(PWSDs) are a few examples of these systems. When a drug is supersaturated for
a significant duration, its concentration in the gastrointestinal tract remains higher
than its equilibrium solubility, permitting absorption through the intestinal barrier.
The “spring” and “parachute” phenomena support SDDSs that have reached a state
of super saturation (Sharma et al. 2022).
13.3.4 Development of Drug-Delivery System Through Microfluidic
Microfluidics are devices that are utilized for the generation of drug carrier parti￾cles, cell-free protein synthesis, and drug screening approaches. It has attracted a
lot of attention lately. In order to create viable drug-delivery systems for micro- and
nanoparticles, microfluidics has a lot of promise. Utilizing microfluidics to produce
micro- or nanoparticles as drug-delivery vehicles has numerous benefits, includ￾ing efficient material and excipient use, fine control over particle parameters, and
performance metrics. The creation of Janus particles is one instance of utilizing a
microfluidic technology to create a smart medication delivery system (Damiati et al.
2018).
13.4 Conclusion and Future Prospects
The use of polymeric materials for nutraceutical delivery is still in its infancy, but
the potential for these materials to improve the efficacy of nutraceuticals is great.References 309
Polymeric materials have emerged as a promising class of drug-delivery vehicles due
to their ability to protect and deliver drugs to specific sites in the body. Nutraceuti￾cals, which are often poorly absorbed and have poor bioavailability, are a particularly
attractive application for polymeric drug delivery. There are many different types of
polymersthat can be used to deliver nutraceuticals, and each hasits own advantages
and disadvantages. The ideal delivery system would be one that issafe, effective, and
affordable. In addition, polymeric materials can be designed to targetspecific organs
or tissues, and this is essential to the administration of nutraceuticals with a variety
of therapeutic advantages.
However, there is still much research to be done in this area before such a system
can be developed. In the meantime, polymeric nutraceutical delivery systems show
promise as a way to improve the health of people around the world.

14.1 Introduction
Conducting polymers (CPs) are becoming popular as there is an increasing need
for materials that are high performing, lightweight, and inexpensive for electrical
and electronic product components and devices. CPs are less expensive to produce,
lighter than other materials used in current technologies, and take up less space.
They are also adaptable and indestructible. These qualities make them ideal for
use in satellites, spacecraft, and robotic or human exploration. CPs are employed
in molecular electronics, solid-state batteries, light-emitting diodes, and recharge￾able batteries. In rechargeable aluminum batteries that operate at room tempera￾ture. CPs like polypyrrole (PPy) and polythiophene (PTh) serve as active components
for the positive-electrode lithium-ion batteries as hybrid composites (Mishra 2018).
Due to their lightweight nature, which is crucial for aerospace applications, corro￾sion resistance, ease of processing, and tunable conductivities, conducting polymers,
especially polyaniline (PANI) and PPy, are useful for various application including
electromagnetic Interference (EMI) shielding as well. There are numerous possi￾ble uses for CPs in the microelectronics sector also, both in the pristine conducting
state and doped conducting state (Hudak 2013; Angelopoulos 2001; Sengodu and
Deshmukh 2015; Wu et al. 2017; Wang and Jing 2005). CP nanostructures have also
drawn more and more attention in both fundamental research and diverse appli￾cation sectors. They exhibit novel features related to their nanoscale size and have
significantly increased device performance. The conducting polymer nanostructures
have emerged as a fast-expanding topic of research (Huang et al. 2003; Tseng et al.
2005; Long et al. 2005, 2010; Pan et al. 2006; Forzani et al. 2004; Chiou et al. 2007;
Verma et al. 2023).

14.2 Processibility and Sensitivity Issues
Most conductive polymers undergo oxidative doping. Due to their salt-like nature
(polymer salt), these materials are less soluble in organic solvents and water, which
reduces their processability. The charged organic backbone frequently becomes
unstable in the presence of air moisture. Organic conductors can be more expensive
than metals and need a multi-step synthesis process. Many polymers’ poor pro￾cessability necessitates the addition of solubilizing agents or substituents, which
can make the synthesis even more difficult. The non-processibility of the solvent of
conducting polymers is one of their main issues. Most CPs degrade before melting
because they are insoluble in ordinary solvents. Additionally, they are unstable in
the environment and have limited mechanical strength. These issues have been
successfully resolved by numerous researchers, and they are now creating polymer
composites and blends that can demonstrate improved stability and mechanical
strength. The sensitivity of the polymers changes in fabrication, effects that depend
on time and temperature, and nonlinearity of their associated properties present
difficulties. CPs must be able to carry out their tasks in dynamic settings with a wide
variety of temperatures and frequencies (MacDiarmid and Epstein 1994; Waware
and Umare 2003; Ismail et al. 2008; Pant et al. 2006; Mzenda et al. 2002).
14.3 Side Chain and 𝛑-Electron Backbone
CPsin their pristine state are intrinsic semiconductors whose band gap isinfluenced
by both the type of substituents connected to the main chain and the chemical
makeup of the conjugated backbone. Thus, depending on the functionalization, the
optical and electrical properties can be changed. The side chains are significant in
the case of CPs as they are the sites where dopant ions get attached affecting the
optical, mechanical, and electronic properties. Bromine-doped poly(acetylene) has
been found to enhance conductivity by many folds (Inal et al. 2018; Chen et al.
2021; Wu et al. 2019). Being lightweight, flexible, and having ease of production,
portable devices can be made of CPs. The alternate single and double bonds provide
mechanical stability to the structure. The microstructure and surface morphology
of CP used in the form of electrodes can be modified to increase conductivity and
signal sensitivity (Russo et al. 2021; Tao et al. 2020). CPs are found in crystalline and
partially amorphous states. As the delocalization of the π-electrons depends on the
disorder of the system, both localized and delocalized conditions of the π-electrons
exist in CPs. The π-electron backbone of conducting polymers is responsible
for their electrical conductivity, due to which CPs are widely used in sensing as
well as in bioelectronics. They provide routes for electrons or holes to migrate
along a polymer chain and jump from chain to chain. Materials with directional
conductivity are produced by the quasi-infinite system, which spans numerous
recurrent monomer units (Namsheer and Rout 2021; Tadesse et al. 2024).
The conjugated polymer’s extended system is extremely vulnerable to chemical
or electrical oxidation or reduction. Controlling this oxidation and reduction allows14.4 Polarons, Bipolarons, and Solitons 315
for extremely precise systematic control of the optoelectronic properties of the
polymer, which are altered by these processes. The polymer may either lose an
electron from one of the bands during the oxidation process or localize the charge
during a brief period of the chain. The polymer expands some energy as a result of
the local distortion brought on by the localization of the charge due to a change in
geometry. The creation of this local geometry, however, lowers the polymer chain’s
ionization energy and raises its electron affinity, making it more suited to accept
the newly produced charges (Le et al. 2017).
14.4 Polarons, Bipolarons, and Solitons
When PPy is oxidized, polarons and bipolarons are formed. Polarons are negatively
charged particles that are formed due to the interaction of excess electrons with
surrounding ionic vibrations. They are heavier than electrons. Two simultaneous
polarons are called a bipolaron and mainly occurs in CPs. As the ground state in
such a case is twofold degenerate, the charged cations are not connected to each
other and can freely dissociate along the chain. As a result, the charged defects
are independent of one another and can form domain walls separating two phases
with opposite orientations and identical energy. These are known as solitons which
are quasi-one-dimensional quantized wave packets that have only one crest and
can travel long distances. The generation of Solitons leads to the formation of new
localized electronic states in the energy gap. At high doping levels, charged Solitons
interact with one another to produce a Soliton band, which can eventually merge
with the band edges to achieve real metallic conductivity. Solitons in polyaniline are
delocalized over around 12 hydrocarbon units, with the highest charge density near
to the dopant counterion (Karlsson 2014 and Heeger 2001).
An electron is removed from the backbone system during oxidative doping of PPy,
resulting in a free radical and a spinless positive charge. The charge and radical’s
local resonance couples the radical and the cation. In this scenario, a sequence of
quinoid-like rings is utilized. This causes a greater energy distortion than the rest of
the chain. These flaws require a large amount of energy to generate and separate. The
number of quinoid-like rings that can connect these two bound species is reduced
as a result. The lattice distortion in PPy is thought to extend over four pyrrole rings.
A combination of a radical (anion or cation) and charged state, gives rise to Polaron.
As a result, a new localized electronic state forms in the gap, with the lower energy
states inhabited by a single unpaired electron.
The polaron state of PPy is positioned symmetrically at approximately 0.5 eV
from the band boundaries. Further oxidation removes the free radical from the
polaron, resulting in the development of a new spinless defect called a bipolaron.
This requires less energy than creating two distinct polarons (Samwang et al. 2024).
Two polarons can combine to generate a bipolaron at higher doping levels. As a
result, at increasing doping levels, polarons are replaced by bipolarons (Celiberti
et al. 2024). The bipolarons in PPy are symmetrically arranged, with a band gap of
0.75 eV. Repeated doping eventually leads to the formation of continuous bipolaron316 14 Conducting Organic Polymers Used in Biosensors for Diagnostic and Pharmaceutical Applications

bands. As additional bipolarons emerge at the expense of the band edges, their band
gap widens. In a heavily doped polymer, the upper and lower bipolaron bands may
overlap with the conduction and valence bands, resulting in partially filled bands
and metallic-like conductivity (Figure 14.1) (Mishra 2018).
14.5 Doping in CPs
An organic polymer that is either an insulator or a semiconductor with low
conductivity is changed into CP through the doping process. The electronic,
electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural characteristics of the polymer are
drastically altered by doping. The breakdown of the polymer backbone is minimal
or nonexistent when doping is reversed to generate the original polymer (Salzmann
et al. 2016). The first doping agents used were halogens (Br2 and I2), FeCl3, and
arsenic pentafluoride (AsF5) for doping polyacetylene. Other popular doping agents
involve strongly or mildly oxidizing acids like HClO4 and H2SO4 (Mishra 2018).
Doping and undoping operations, which involve dopant counter-ions that
stabilize the doped state, can be performed chemically or electrochemically. It is
also possible to perform transitory doping using no dopant ions. A conductivity
anywhere between that of the non-doped (insulating or semiconducting) and that
of the completely doped (very conducting) version of the polymer can be easily
achieved by controllably altering the doping level (Le et al. 2017). Conducting
blends comprising a (doped) conducting polymer and a normal polymer (insulator)
can be created, and their conductivity can be changed by adjusting the relative
quantities of each polymer. This allows for the best qualities of each type of polymer
to be optimized.
The poly(p-phenylene sulfide, PPS) was the first nonrigid, partially carbon￾backbone connected polymer that became highly conducting after doping. PPS has
been reported to have an orthorhombic unit cell with the space group Pbcn in its
crystal structure. Diffraction investigations revealed that the adjacent phenyl rings
were nearly perpendicular. The bandwidth is only 0.2 eV with a high ionization14.6 CPs for Biosensing 317
potential of 6.3 eV (Rabolt et al. 1980; Chance et al. 1980; Tabor et al. 1971; Edmonds
and Hill 1967). The p-type doping involving electron donation from CP and n-type
doping involving electron capture can be used to control the electrical conductivity
of CPs. CPs like polyacetylene (PA) and polypyrrole (PPy) have been used to this
effect in many electronic devices. Different polymerization methods can be used to
create PPy with various morphologies useful for tissue engineering (Albaaj et al.
2017; Chauhan et al. 2017; Khan et al. 2020). The efficiency of the CPs is enhanced
by blending them with nanomaterials like graphene and iridium oxide to form
composites (Yang et al. 2014; Hassanein et al. 2017; Mao et al. 2018; Noh et al. 2014;
Prajapati and Kandasubramanian 2019; Wongkaew et al. 2019; Zare et al. 2020;
Erkmen et al. 2020).
14.6 CPs for Biosensing
CPs are excellent for use in sensors due to their chemical characteristics. CPs are
widely used in gas sensors because they provide excellent design flexibility. They
can form specific layers in which the transduction mechanism’s primary physical
parameter is changed as a result of the interaction between the analyte gas and
the conducting matrix (Janata and Josowicz 2003; McQuade et al. 2000; Gerard
et al. 2002). Biosensors are devices that are required for quick and accurate medical
diagnosis of a living body. The sophistication of biosensors is increasing day by day
as technology and new materials advance. Biosensors are one of the most important
applications of conjugated conductive polymers (CPs) (Wu et al. 2020; Prabakaran
et al. 2021; Huang et al. 2018; Park et al. 2016). CPs are used in the sensing of
biomolecules like glucose, dopamine, DNA, L-tryptophan, drug detection in foods,
urinary progesterone, as nuclei in human brain organoids, nitrofurantoin, uric
acid, ascorbic acid, micro-RNA (Chen and Luo 2015; Luo et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2020;
Aydogdu et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2019). They are used in detecting
tumor cells and also food spoilage by being used in a wireless sensor (Xu et al. 2019;
Ma et al. 2018). The following section discusses some of the significant applications
of CPs in biosensing and pharmaceutical applications.
The CPs used in biosensing are poly(acetylene), PEDOT, poly(thiophene), PPV,
poly(pyrrole), and PANI (Figure 14.2). Conduction occurs due to delocalized
electrons in the long-conjugated system in the molecular skeleton. They are used
in diagnostics to improve the speed, sensitivity, and versatility of biosensors for
measuring vital analytes (Hsiao et al. 2014; Das and Sarkar 2016).
Some of the well-known CPs in use are polythiophene (PTh), poly sulfur nitride
(PSNx), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and their derivatives. Both PTh
and PEDOT are used in organic electronics like organic light-emitting devices and
field effect transistors asthey do not cause any health hazards. PEDOT furthersolves
the insoluble problem of other CPs by incorporating a water-soluble polyelectrolyte,
poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSS), into the film without sacrificing the electronic
conductivity. PSNx has a metallic gold appearance, has conductivity comparable
to that of metal at room temperature, and shows superconductivity at 0.3 K. The318 14 Conducting Organic Polymers Used in Biosensors for Diagnostic and Pharmaceutical Applications

conductivity in PSNx is more dominant along the molecular chain than perpen￾dicular to it. Several CPs have found widespread application in organic electron￾ics. The flexible mechanical properties of the present CPs being biocompatible are
particularly advantageousfor biomedical applications(Regasa et al. 2020; Singh et al.
2019; Lu et al. 2021; Namsheer and Rout 2021; Guo et al. 2019).
14.7 Oxidation and Charge Transfer
Each of a film’s constitutive polymer chains can be oxidized by extracting or
injecting n consecutive electrons generating p or n doping, respectively. The
counter ions and solvent are exchanged with the electrolyte to maintain the charge
and osmotic balance. The materials are transformed into reactive polyelectrolyte
gels with variable polymer-ion compositions. The distribution of double bonds
in polymer chains changes during these reactions from s bonds and free rotation
among consecutive monomeric units to conjugated bonds with a quinoid structure
along several monomeric units (Figure 14.3) (Yu et al. 2016; Toribio et al. 2013).
14.8 Color Change in PDA Polymers
PDA-based polymers undergo reversible temperature-induced color changes, at a
temperature of 75 ∘C, extended conjugation causes an absorption at 640 nm giving
a blue color that gets shifted to purple at 585 nm. The twisting of the polymer
backbone and changes in the degree of conjugation in the system produces a red

biosensors, building materials, and intelligent screens and have a variety of appli￾cations, including biomedicine, optical storage, sensing, building materials, and
anti-counterfeiting (Kamphan et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2020; Prabakaran et al. 2021;
Huang et al. 2018; Lu et al. 2021).
14.9 Ionic Detection
In potentiometric ion-selective electrodes (ISE), CP is used as a sensor. The first
attempt used poly(4,4-diaminodiphenyl ether) pH sensors. The ion-exchange
characteristics of polymers that have been suitably doped can be used to detect a
specific ion in a solution. The substituent and size of the acid anion utilized as a
dopant during electro-polymerization affect the pH sensitivity of polyaniline and
its derivatives. Tetraphenylborate-doped polyaniline produced in dry acetonitrile
can be employed as a pH potentiometric sensor in both aqueous and non-aqueous
conditions. The pH sensitivity of a poly(1-aminoanthracene) film electrodeposited
on a platinum electrode was also reported without interference from alkali metal
ions. The polymer thickness was found to be important in potentiometric pH
responses for PPy-modified glassy carbon electrodes. By using the template effect of
a non-conducting polymer PVC cast overthe graphite surface before PPy deposition,
the time response of the pH sensitivity of the doped PPy electrode was dramatically
improved (Trojanowicz 2003; Ohnuki et al. 1983; Lindfors and Ivaska 2002; Pandey320 14 Conducting Organic Polymers Used in Biosensors for Diagnostic and Pharmaceutical Applications
and Singh 2001; Faria and Bulhões 1998; Shiu et al. 1999; Masalles et al. 2002;
Michalska et al. 1997).
14.9.1 Cation Detection
Doping CPs with immobile anions results in cationic potentiometric sensitivity
due to the presence of mobile metal ions in the polymer layer. The addition of
a cation-exchanging, ion-conductive Nafion proton-exchange membrane (PEM)
layer on top of PPy increases the cationic response slope by a factor of two. Nafion
membranes have applications in hydrogen fuel cells as well as potentiometric
sensitivity to cations was also discovered in oxidized PPy films, which demonstrated
significantly lower redox interference than PPy electrodes. A calcium potentio￾metric sensor made of PPy doped with the calcium-complexing ligand Calcion
was successfully developed. It can be utilized as an indication for potentiometric
calcium titrations, particularly mixed solvent titrations when traditional PVC-based
electrodes cannot be employed. The adsorption of calcion ions on both the substrate
and the film aids in the deposition of the film. Calcion adsorption on PPy film
is much stronger than on the electrode substrate, and the redox process of cal￾cion is more reversible. Membranes prepared by electro-polymerizing a pyrrole
dibenzo-18-crown-6monomer with pyrrole showed cationic sensitivity to divalent
cations. As an internal sensor, a nitrate-selective PPy electrode was used to create
a NOx gas sensor (Michalska et al. 2002; Ersöz et al. 2002; Blaz et al. 2000; Gan￾dasasmita et al. 2002; Zhu et al. 2022). The enhanced response stability of CP-based
ion-selective electrodes was attributed to the capacity of PPy to transfer both ionic
and electronic charges. PPy film was used as an electric connector support to
create ion-selective electrodes sensitive to potassium ions, as well as sulfate ions
and anionic and cationic surfactants. To make a solid contact calcium-sensitive
electrode, a PVC layer containing an ionophore was cast on a PPy film saturated
in calcium hydroxide solution (Oyama and Hirokawa 1987; Cadogan et al. 1992;
Bobacka 1999; Gyurcsányi et al. 1998; Pandey and Prakash 1998; Berthold et al.
2001; Kovács et al. 2001). PANI was used to fabricate potentiometric calcium
sensors with various ionophores. The chemical sensing of Cr+6 was performed
using a polyaniline-polystyrene composite-modified electrode (Bobacka et al. 1995;
Lindfors and Ivaska 2000, 2001; Alizadeh and Mahmodian 2000; Yang and Huang
2001; Dominguez-Ballart et al. 2000).
14.9.2 Anion Detection
Anions like Fl− and Cl−, although beneficial for human health, become detrimental
when present in excess amounts. PVC membrane containing dodecyl sulfate-doped
PPy was used as an ionophore and demonstrated good selectivity over diverse
inorganic anions (Diniz et al. 1999; Wang et al. 2014). A diketopyrrolo[3,4-c] pyrrole
(DPP)-based polymer with NH units on the polymer backbone has been reported to
be a good anion detector. The functional group NH reacts with the fluoride anions
in the organic solvents, resulting in a color change from red to blue. These CPs not14.11 Enzyme Entrapment 321
only detect the anions but also filter them (Wu et al. 2020; Prabakaran et al. 2021;
Huang et al. 2018). They are used to detect cyanide ions (CN−), found in industrial
and biological wastes in the water, by being used in fluorescence and colorimetric
chemo-sensors (Kumar et al. 2019).
14.10 Conductometry
Conductometric biosensors measure changes in a biological component’s
conductance induced by the interaction of two metal electrodes. Conductometric
detection relies on a process that can change the concentration of ionic species.
This mechanism causes changes in electrical conductivity or current flow. How
changes in ionic composition during biorecognition affect conductance between
electrodes is investigated. They possess speed, usability, specificity, sensitivity, near
real-time detection, and demand for tiny sample amounts. Biosensors for glucose,
urea-neutral lipid/lipase, and hemoglobin/pepsin estimation detect changes in
electronic conductivity caused by changes in the redox potential and/or pH.
Polyaniline Langmuir Blodgett films have been used as a glucose biosensor. The
dielectric spectroscopic measurements of the PPy/glucose biosensor were also taken
into consideration. For penicillin, as well as glucose, urea, lipids, and hemoglobin,
conductivity biosensors based on conducting polymers were developed. Micro￾electronic devices with millimolar sensitivity to urea concentration have been
developed for measurements of conductance, capacitance, and admittance using
urease (Wu et al. 2020; Prabakaran et al. 2021; Huang et al. 2018).
The bio-recognition event changes the concentration of ionic species during
conductometric detection, resulting in a quantifiable change in electrical conduc￾tivity or conductance. Conductometric biosensors are tiny two-electrode devices
that allow current to flow when an alternating current voltage is applied across
the electrodes. Because of its short detection time, sensitivity, and ease of use, this
device is most likely to be employed on-site for pathogen detection. It can detect
pathogens such as Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli present in food. The link
between conductance and bioreceptor approaches serves as the foundation for
establishing conductometric detection employing a CP. The CP converts biolog￾ical impulses into electrical signals by acting as an electrochemical transducer.
Polyaniline, polythiophene, polyacetylene, and PPy are examples of CPs used for
this (Yahaya et al. 2019; Tsai et al. 2021).
14.11 Enzyme Entrapment
Conducting polymers serve as a suitable matrix for enzyme entrapment. A
conductometric biosensor using immobilized Chlorella vulgaris microalgae as
bio-receptors has been used as a bi-enzymatic biosensor. The incorporation
of enzymes into electro-depositable conducting polymeric films allows for
the localization of biologically active molecules on electrodes of any size or322 14 Conducting Organic Polymers Used in Biosensors for Diagnostic and Pharmaceutical Applications
geometry, making it particularly suitable for the fabrication of multi-analyte
micro-amperometric biosensors. The available chemical structure of CPs
is highly flexible and can be modified as needed. The loss of enzymes is
one of the problems associated with the operation of the enzyme system.
Enzyme stability and biosensor shelf life are maintained. Several immobiliza￾tion procedures have been developed to address these issues. Immobilization
of biological molecules on transducers is a critical step in the development
of biosensors, and conducting polymer-made transducers are widely used
for this purpose (Promsuwan et al. 2020; Lian et al. 2016; Kucherenko et al.
2019).
14.12 DNA Sensing
DNA biosensors are used in the electrochemical detection of amino acids,
pharmaceuticals, proteins, and other biomaterials contained in urine and blood.
They provide quick sensing, have good storage as well as cyclic stability, and
can be made at lower expenses, DNA biosensors are regarded as general plat￾forms using CPs as substrates for biosensor applications. These are mainly DNA
hybridization-based biosensors that use enzyme-free nucleic acid amplification
strategies to enhance their responses. The recognition events between aptamers and
analytes cause a change in the surface morphology compared to pristine electrodes,
which may alter the path of electron transport (Rashid and Yusof 2017; Yang et al.
2017; Bizid et al. 2017; Hui et al. 2017; Kulikova et al. 2018; Karimi-Maleh et al.
2015; Bizid et al. 2016). The biochemical signals are converted into an electrical
readout via transducing mechanisms. A transducer surface is an electrode where
CPs can be used to capture targets with selectivity by immobilizing single-stranded
probe oligonucleotides into a self-assembled monolayer. The physicochemical
parameters of the electrode surface have a considerable impact on the performance
of DNA biosensors properties of these electrochemical biosensors (Williamson et al.
2023). The use of PPy has caused improved performance in detecting ds-DNA and
Idarubicin (Foroughi and Jahani 2022).
14.13 Hydrogel-Based Biosensors
Hydrogel biosensors are multifunctional with high flexibility and biocompatibility.
CP-based hydrogels have been widely used in several biomedical applications,
including medication delivery, wound healing by means of tissue regeneration,
and molecular diagnostics (Herrmann and Haag 2021). Wichterle and Lim created
the first hydrophilic gel (hydrogel) in 1960, the objective was to create a plastic
alternative to human tissue (Wichterle and Lím 1960). Hydrogels are made of
biocompatible polymers with reasonable mechanical characteristics. CPs can be
bound with hydrogels utilizing electro-polymerization and hydrogel coating toReferences 323
make hydrogels conductive. PEDOT, PANI, and PPy are mainly used in hydro￾gels. The conductive hydrogel is implantable in live creatures and functions as
a flexible electrode to detect cell impulses from the brain (Ahmed 2015; Feig
et al. 2018; Tavakoli and Tang 2017; Qu et al. 2014; Goh et al. 2017). Sulfonated
lignin-conductive polymer nanoparticles having hydrophilic properties have been
employed for hydrogel bioelectronics (Gan et al. 2020).
14.14 Urea and Melamine Detection
Urea and melamine in milk, if not in property quantity, may cause kidney diseases.
To detect urea and melamine, biosensors based onCP composite materials have been
developed for their detection using electrochemical sensing platforms. To produce a
urea sensor, PANI-based hydrogels were coated with the enzyme urease, which was
immobilized on the working electrode. The hydrogel supplied an extended surface
area, while the PANI increased the sensitivity. When these CP-based nanocompos￾ites are utilized as electrode materials, the signals of biosensors are improved, and
enzyme signaling and activity are preserved (Azad and Ahmed 2016).
14.15 Summary
Conducting polymers (CPs) have significant use in biosensing. They have the
advantages of being lightweight, flexible, and can be produced in large quantities.
CPs like poly(acetylene), PEDOT, poly(thiophene), PPV, poly(pyrrole), and PANI
are the ones most used for biosensing. The sensing is done by a change in con￾duction and in some cases change in color occurring in CPs. Detection of anions,
milk adulteration urea, melamine, enzyme entrapment, and DNA sensing are some
of the major applications of CP-based biosensors. Their sensing properties can be
further enhanced by doping and making nanocomposites.

15.1 Introduction
Optoelectronics is one of the most exciting areas in electronics as well as in material
science. In the last 20–30 years, there have been dramatic developments in this
field (Predeep 2011), and it plays a vital role in almost every aspect, starting from
day-to-day life to national security. Optoelectronics is a very broad term that bridges
optics and electronics and the development of hardware devices that convert
electrical energy into light and vice versa. Optoelectronics is not only limited
to a single area, but it also has plenty of applications such as military services,
telecommunications, and medical equipment. For convenience, we can broadly
classify optoelectronic devices into two categories as shown in Figure 15.1.
Herein, an attempt has been made to emphasize the importance of photodetectors
in optoelectronics that finds many real-world applications (Chee 2018; Miao and
Zhang 2019; Wang and Kim 2017). Advancements in photodetectors play a pivotal
role for their wide range of applications such as in remote sensing, national security,
detecting harmful radiations, and health monitoring (Chen et al. 2020b; Gogoi
and Sen Sarma 2015; Lee et al. 2010). Photodetectors range from simple devices to
receivers on VCR and TV remote controls, to the CCD in a video camera, to photo￾diodes in a fiber optic connection, and to boundless arrays used by astronomers to
detect radiation.

Thermal photodetectors generally absorb infra-red (IR) radiations, and this
radiation increases the temperature of the material used in the photodetector.
Further, some physical properties of the material may change to generate an
electrical output. For example, the temperature changes are converted to changes
in voltage by the use of a thermocouple, the Seebeck effect in a thermopile detector,
changes in electrical polarization by the use of pyroelectric materials in pyroelectric
detectors, and changes in resistance by the use of a barometer in a bolometer
detector. The photonic nature of the incident radiations has no bearing on the
signal. Therefore, thermal effects are wavelength-independent. Thermal photode￾tectors typically have poor sensitivity and response, but photon photodetectors,
another type of photodetector, are more effective than thermal detectors in terms of
sensitivity and response time.
However, after absorbing electromagnetic radiation, photon photodetectors
change the distribution of electronic energy within the substance to produce an
electrical signal. In addition, photon photodetectors depend upon a selective wave￾length of the radiation. It requires cryogenic cooling for preventing the formation
of carriers by thermal energy. Photon photodetectors can be further subdivided into
different categories, but three of them are very common such as photoconductor,
photodiode, and phototransistor (Miao and Zhang 2019).
15.1.2 Mechanism involved in the Photodetection
In photodetection, photoactive materials, semiconducting materials create an
electron–hole pair (exciton) under the influence of suitable light energy. That is, at
the point of a semiconductor exposed to photons with energies greater than or equal
to its bandgap, then electrons are ejected from the valence band to the conduction
band. Under the influence of an external applied electric field, ejected electrons can15.1 Introduction 335
move freely for a long distance. Besides, the positively charged holes move from
one site to another in the valence band that also contribute to electrical conduction
(Omnes 2009).
Instead of the electron–hole pair mechanism, there are some materials that have
their donor–acceptor properties, and via the donor–acceptor mechanism, they can
also produce photocurrent in the photodetector.
15.1.3 Materials
Researchers around the world have been developing many organic, inorganic,
hybrid materials, and nanomaterials for fabricating photodetectors. Such materials
are essentially semiconducting materials. The vast majority of inorganic semicon￾ducting materials are utilized as photoactive materials in photodetectors because of
their better photophysical properties and durability. Photodetectors mainly based
on p-n heterojunctions and some examples of n-type inorganic semiconducting
materials are TiO2 (Chahrour et al. 2019), ZnO (Gedamu et al. 2014), SnO2 (Y. Li
et al. 2018), Zn2SnO4 (Dong et al. 2018), Zn2GaO4 (Huang et al. 2020), Zn2GeO4
(Han et al. 2019), ZnS (Chen et al. 2020a), Ga2In4S9 (Wang et al. 2019a) and p-type
are GaN (Wang et al. 2019b), SiC (Liang et al. 2020), NiO (Zhang et al. 2020)
metal oxides. The synthesis of such materials is not straightforward in spite of
their excellent photophysical properties. Additionally, majority of the inorganic
materials are not flexible and also quite expensive. Such disadvantages could be
addressed by developing organic semiconductors (Miao and Zhang 2019). Organic
semiconductors that include small molecules, polymers, fullerenes, and their
derivatives are the main materials for organic photodetectors. Among them, small
molecules and polymer materials are often used as single-component films as well
as donor materials for bulk heterojunction (BHJ). Organic polymers can be easily
tuned by adjusting their conjugate chain according to different applications. In this
chapter, we will discuss organic-polymer-based photodetectors.
15.1.4 Photodetector Parameters
A brief discussion about the important parameters used for the assessment of
photodetectors is given as follows:
15.1.4.1 Responsivity
Responsivity is the detector output signal in the form of current (Iout) or voltage
(Vout) response to the input optical power (Pin) (Chow and Someya 2020). Mathe￾matically it can be expressed as
Current responsivity Ri = Iout
Pin
unit = A W−1
Voltage responsivity Rv = Vout
Pin
unit = V W−1336 15 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetectors: Mechanism and Device Fabrication
15.1.4.2 Noise-Equivalent Power (NEP)
The input optical power that results in an output signal (voltage or current),
identical to the device’s noise, is known as the noise-equivalent power (NEP) of a
photodetector. Since noise varies with bandwidth (Δf) of the circuit, the bandwidth
must be restricted (Chow and Someya 2020). Mathematically:
NEP = HAVN
VS(Δf)1∕2
where
H =Irradiation on the detector of area A
VN =Root means square noise voltage within (Δf)
VS =Root means square signal voltage
15.1.4.3 Detectivity
Although responsively provides some information about output vs. input signals, it
does not provide any information regarding the detector’s sensitivity. Sensitivity is
defined as the minimum input optical power that a photodetector can detect. This
power is the NEP (Chow and Someya 2020).
Detectivity, D = 1
NEP
unit = W−1
However, D cannot be used for comparing two detectors because it has no idea
about the detector area. In order to solve this problem, the term specific detectivity
is introduced, which can be defined as the square root of the detector area (A) per
unit value of NEP (Chow and Someya 2020).
Specific detectivity, D∗ = A1∕2
NEP
unit = cm W−1
15.1.4.4 Quantum Efficiency
The ratio of the number of electrons that are gathered to the number of photons
that are incident is known as the quantum efficiency (Q) of a photodetector (Chow
and Someya 2020). For example, in the case of photoemissive detectors, Q is equal to
number of electrons emitted to the number of photon incidents. Similarly, for a p-n
junction-based semiconductor device, Q denotes the number of excitons produced
per unit incident photon. Therefore, Q is the fundamental way of expressing the
credibility of the incident optical power to generate an output signal. The quantum
efficiency is related to the responsivity (Rd) by the following relationship:
𝜆 Q = 100 × Rd ×
(1.2395)
where Rd =Responsivity, 𝜆 = Wavelength of light.
15.1.4.5 Detector Response Time
It requires a definite amount of time to produce photo current when light source
turned instantly and illuminate’s detectors. Again, it takes a moment to get back to
the origin value for the photocurrent.15.2 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetector 337
15.1.4.6 Spectral Response
Spectral response refers to the changes in the detector performance (responsivity or
detectivity) with wavelength. The type of detector and the type of substance affect
the precise shape of the spectral response curve.
Out of the many types of detectors available UV, Vis, and IR have the maximum
spectral response curve. Again, the manufacturer also has a pronounced effect on
the shape of the spectral response curve (Yang and Ma 2019).
15.2 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetector
The development of organic polymers and their conjugates with other materials is
a potential alternative to inorganic-chemical-based photodetectors. Polymer-based
semiconductors can be designed to achieve their desired functions (Forrest 2004).
Furthermore, polymersemiconductors have the potential forlarge-area printing and
also, these are solution processable that simplifies the device fabrication process
(Sekitani et al. 2008). The flexibility of the polymer materialsis an important param￾eter to fabricate flexible devices and also possesses a broad spectral range beyond
visible light (White et al. 2013). The molecular structure of some of the polymer and
conjugated polymer used in the organic photodetector for different applications are
mentioned in Figure 15.2.
15.2.1 Working Principle of Organic Photodetector
The working mechanism of organic-polymer-based photodetectors includes the
general steps to convert the optical signal into the electrical signal:
1. Generation of electron-hole pairs, i.e. exciton
2. Production of charge transfer exciton

3. Separation of charge transfer exciton
4. Collection of free charges
In the case of organic-polymer-based photodetectors, the photogeneration of
coulombically bound charge carriers, i.e. electron–hole pairs known as exciton is a
key mechanism for detecting light. Literature revealsthat organic materialstypically
have exciton binding energies between 0.3 and 0.5 eV. The efficient separation of
charges creates a large photocurrent that can be measured and used to detect
light. Therefore, this state can be generated by light absorption in a semiconductor
material. For the diffusion process to effectively separate electron–hole pairs in
organic materials the formation of a heterojunction between an electron-donating
(donor) and an electron-accepting (acceptor) substance is crucial. After that,
the excitons are spread over the interface between donor and acceptor for their
dissociation into free charges. Therefore, to enhance the exciton dissociation, the
exciton diffusion length is an essential factor. Unfortunately, for most organic
materials the exciton diffusion length is typically short, i.e. in the range of 5–20
nm. This challenge is overcome by using materials like C60 that have a long exciton
diffusion length. In general, organic photodetectors use planar heterojunction
(PHJ) or bulk heterojunction (BHJ). The BHJ structure is used by most of the
devices to improve the device performance by reducing the distance that is required
to reach the interface for the excitons and generate a large number of free charges,
since in organic semiconductors, excitons do not spontaneously dissociate into free
electron–hole pairs. The external electric field is used to assist the exciton separation
process. After the successful extraction of the charges at the electrodes, finally a
photocurrent is created without undergoing recombination, which leads to the loss
of the photocurrent. Improving the device designs can optimize the performance
of organic photodetectors for a wide range of applications with respect to spectral
response (Chow and Someya 2020).
15.2.2 Basic Device Architecture of Organic Photodetector
There are mainly three types of organic photodetectors such as photoconductors,
photodiodes, and phototransistors.
One of the most fundamental kinds of photodetectors is the photoconductor. In
these devices, the semiconducting material is placed in between the two ohmic
contact electrodes as shown in Figure 15.3a. Electron–hole pairs (EHPs) are created
as a result of the incident photons being absorbed by the exposed semiconductor
region to increase the conductivity of the photodetector. Photoconductor exhibits
intrinsic photocurrent amplification. It is possible to increase the sensitivity of
photodetectors through photoconductive gain, in which the quantity of charge
carriers that passes through the external circuit in reaction to an optical signal can
be greater than the quantity of EHPs produced by photon absorption (He et al.
2015; Miao and Zhang 2019). Photoconductive detectors are often used for the
detection of IR radiation. The attainable noise performance of the photoconductors
is constrained in the case ofsmall bandgap materials by both the thermal generation15.2 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetector 339

rate and the non-zero dark conductivity. Particularly for low-noise and high-speed
applications, there is another device that can reduce the performance deficiencies
of photoconductive devices and the semiconductor junction photodiode as shown
in Figure 15.3b. In general, photodiodes are intrinsic photodetectors that sense light
by utilizing EHPs, produced in the p-n junction’s depletion region. Both p- and
n-type dopants are available for p-n photodiodes. For example, the production of
the detectors uses silicon, GaAs/AlGaAs, and InGaAs/InAlAs materials. By adding
a lightly doped region in between the p- and n-type regions, which creates a p-i-n
structure, the structure of the p-n junction is improved in order to combat the low
quantum efficiency and slow nature caused by the tiny depletion width. Therefore,
it leads to larger detection bandwidths that improve the quantum efficiency as
well as the junction potential is decreased. Generally, photodiodes are used for UV
photodetection along with a variety of electronic applications (Nasiri and Tricoli
2019). Phototransistors (Figure 15.3c), with a three-terminal configuration, operate
under a normal field-effect transistors (FET) mode where the drain current is
flowing in the accumulated channel by using the gate voltage at a given source to
drain bias. Phototransistors could have a high external quantum efficiency (EQE)
that results in high photocurrent with high responsivity (Wang and Kim 2017).
15.2.3 Advanced Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetectors
Numerous studies have been published in recent years about innovative meth￾ods and electro-optical processes that result in organic photodetectors with
high-performance characteristics like low noise, high speed, high sensitiv￾ity, and selective spectral range (Eggenhuisen et al. 2015; Hazarika et al.
2021; Pierre et al. 2015; Tedde et al. 2009). Various methods and polymers
to enhance their mechanical and photodetector characteristics are outlined
here. A photodetector’s detectivity can be increased by having a low back￾ground current. Various strategies have been devised to lower the noise current.
Using charge-blocking interlayers between the active layer and the electrodes
is one method that can effectively reduce noise current without affecting the340 15 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetectors: Mechanism and Device Fabrication
photodetector’s responsiveness and external quantum efficiency (EQE), claims the
study (Saracco et al. 2013; Valouch et al. 2012). Polystyrene-N, N-diphenyl-N, N￾bis(4-n-butylphenyl)-(1,10-biphenyl)-4,4-diamine-perfluorocyclobutane (PS-TPD￾PFCB) an electron-blocking interlayer was reported by Gong et al. (2009) that
increased the detectivity up to 1013 Jones matching with the silicon detectors
by decreasing dark current about 1 nM cm-2 is one of the very first examples.
Inkjet-printed poly-[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenyl)-thiophene] (poly-PT)
reported by Grimoldi et al. (2016), is one of the polymeric electron-blocking interlay￾ersthat have since been described. The poly(9,9-bis(30-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)
-2,7-uorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-diocty-luorene) reported by Li et al. (2014), and the
alcohol-soluble variety. Even though adding charge-blocking interlayers can
effectively increase the detectivity, the fabrication process is complex because
the blocking interlayers’ processing solvents must be orthogonal. Consequently,
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a conjugated polymer, was reported by Xiong et al.
(2017), to decrease noise current without the need for processing solvents through
the use of transfer printing. It is a dry fabrication technique, so an orthogonal
solvent is not needed during the fabrication process. After depositing the film on the
substrate onto the target, a medium substrate like PDMS is used to transfer-print
the substrate. As a consequence, the photodiode’s detectivity was increased up to
1012 Jones, and it can now detect extremely weak signals of pW cm−2. Recently, a
novel method for the reduction of noise current in organic BHJ without involving
additional charge-blocking interlayers was developed in an effort to streamline the
earlier processes. Layer-by-layer (LBL) solution processing was described by Zhong
et al. (2019). This design is comparable to the planar heterojunction, where the
BHJ morphology is created by a partial mixing of the donor and acceptor layers.
They disclosed a high-performance, all-polymer PTzBI-Ph: N2200 photodiode with
a high detectivity of 5.68 × 1012.
Minor carriertrap sites assist the organic-polymer-based photodetectorto improve
the responsivity and sensitivity of the photodetector. Moreover, the majority of
carrier trap sites can efficiently reduce the noise current and hence the detection
performance is increased. On this concept, Shou and co-workers introduced a
spatially separated electron/hole double trap mode for the phototransistors (Ji et al.
2022). For trapping sites for electrons/holes, they used PC61BM and metallic Ag
nanoparticles, respectively, and achieved spatial separation by using a polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) layer. It gives a high photoresponsivity of 5.26 × 103 A W−1
and ultra-high detectivity rates of about 1016 Jones. A high gain is required for the
fast detection of very weak optical signals to employ in a wide range of applications
such as telecommunications, signal monitoring, and surveillance. Without using
external circuitry like amplifiers, Hiramoto et al. (1994) introduced an organic
perylene pigment film to achieve photoconductive gain via the trapping of holes
for the development of a high-performance photodetector. Recently, Zhou et al.
(2016) reported PDPP3T: PCBM as an interfacial layer with ZnO nanoparticles to
achieve a high photoconductive gain in a photodiode. In addition to the standard
phototransistors and photoconductors, at a low voltage of 1V and also at room
temperature, Nie et al. (2017) recently developed an organic BHJ photodiode with15.2 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetector 341
PBDTT-DPP: PCBM that gives an extraordinary detectivity about 1014 Jones with
high gain (∼30 A W−1 or ∼5000% EQE). The fabrication process for this device
is very simple and on the basis of this design in the recent future, the organic
photodetector may lead to even better photodetection performance for use in
different applications.
A wide variety of material systems are available for organic photodetectors to
achieve broadband detection range, or the full visible and near-infrared (NIR)
range. But with these materials, achieving a narrowband sensing range is very
difficult (Jansen-van Vuuren et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2018a). Narrowband detection
is crucial for many uses, including communications, optical monitoring, color
imaging, and biomedical imaging (Liu et al. 2018b; Park et al. 2018). By sensitizing
the BHJ layer with PbS quantum dots, Rauch and his colleagues were able to create
the first high-performance NIR organic/inorganic hybrid photodiode that extends
absorption up to 1.8 m (Rauch et al. 2009). Following that, Armin et al. (2015)
reported a high-performance organic photodiode for narrowband visible or NIR
detection that was built on the charge collection narrowing (CCN) concept. The
CCN idea makes use of the incident photons’ wavelength-dependent absorption
coefficients inside the thicker photoactive layer. Armin and his colleagues used
PCDTBT:PCBM and DPP-DTT:PCBM blends in dense BHJ films of about 2 m. The
optimized narrowband organic photodiodes achieved a maximum EQE of about
30% and high detectivity of about 1012 Jones by considerably lowering the noise
current. This was made possible by the use of thick active interlayer film. Since then,
a plethora of investigations have documented organic BHJ-based narrowband CCN
photodiodes (Zhong et al. 2017). Shen et al. (2016) produced an organic photodiode
by fusing the CCN idea for narrowband detection with the photoconductive gain
with high EQE in order to get around the low EQE limitation of CCN organic
photodiodes. In order to trigger the photoconductive gain by trapping holes through
which EQE greatly increases by tenfold from before, they added PbS quantum dots
into a thick BHJ layer.
Hence, we can conclude that organic polymers are promising candidates for
high-performance photodetectors from the recent advances in synthetic techniques.
15.2.4 Perovskite/Polymer Conjugate Photodetectors
Spectrally effective photodetectors are used in many applications such as optical
communication, fluorescence microscopy, national security, combating climate
change, early missile detection, environment monitoring, and advanced communi￾cations(Chen et al. 2020c). Si, SiC p-n junction, or GaN isthe photodetector that has
been utilized the most frequently out of all the commercially accessible photode￾tectors. These commercially available photodetectors are expensive and only detect
up to <5 × 1013 Jones of light (Guo et al. 2012; Shao et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2006).
The photomultiplier tube is one of the most used photodetectors (PMT). They have
high detectivity in both UV and visible regions of about ∼3 × 1014 Jones. However,
because of their size, poor UV-to-visible rejection ratio, and high operating voltage,
their application is practically limited. These restrictions prompted researchers342 15 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetectors: Mechanism and Device Fabrication
to create materials and equipment that are innovative and easily resolve the
aforementioned problem. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells with high power
conversion efficiencies above 20%, and highly sensitive photodetectors are just a
few of the high-performance devices that have recently been made possible by
significant advancements in organic and inorganic lead halide perovskite materials
(Shao et al. 2020). Their high carrier mobility, high optical absorption coefficient,
and lengthy carrier recombination lifetime are what give them their fascinating
performance. For photodetector applications, hybrid lead halide perovskite-based
material systems are a good candidate because they can be produced at a low
cost while still being able to achieve excellent detectivity (1013–1014 Jones), a
large linear dynamic range (over 100 db), and quick response times (in the order
of microseconds) (Dou et al. 2014; Fang et al. 2015). However, these spectrally
selective photodetectors involved the detection of a very narrow wavelength. The
residual part should be removed by using a narrow-band photodetector (NPD). The
majority of photoactive materials used nowadays absorb photons in a broad spectral
range; hence, the standard NPD is typically created by fusing optical filters with
photosensitive materials, which increases the cost of the developed photodetectors
(Qin et al. 2020). A typical NPD photodetector device is shown in Figure 15.4.
Evidently, it has a complex architecture and requires hole-transporting material
(PDOT:PSS) and ETL (Bathocuproine-BCP) such as conductive, semiconducting
polymer (PTB7), and C60.
The EQE of these NPDs is, however, comparatively low because a large portion
of the carriers is likely trapped in the thick active layer before being collected by the
electrode due to the low carrier mobility (∼6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1) of the organic mate￾rials (Liu et al. 2014; Xue et al. 2018). Armin et al. (2015) developed a new class of

band pass optical filters (Wang et al. 2019b). It achieves CCN by making use of the
variations in attenuation length of the light of various wavelengths.
Kim and co-workers used highly flexible and effective thin electrospun perovskite
nanofiber materials to construct a photodetector. The pristine perovskite and
polymer/perovskite composite films differ from the poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP)/MAPbI3 composite nanofibers in their distinctive moieties. The core and
shell portions of the nanofibers, respectively, both concurrently displayed swollen
nanoplates and embedded nanoparticles. Both the nanoparticles and nanoplates
showed two wavelengths in PL emission spectra. The flexibility of the fibers has
been evaluated by depositing the nanofibers in a rubbery substrate which can
endure 15% of strain and started to fall apart at about 20% strain. Stress distribution
in such materials can be determined using finite element analysis. Under green
and red light irradiation, the PDs maintained 83.8% of their initial responsivity
and detectivity after 15% strain. Additionally, under continuous green light irra￾diation, remarkable photostability for 720 hours at 35% relative humidity, as well
as outstanding mechanical durability for 500 stretching cycles at 15% strain were
observed (Kim et al. 2022).
Mathur et al. (2021), in their work, have developed a stretchable photodetector
using the MAPbI3 perovskite and polystyrene (PS-MAPbI3). After 10,000 stretching
cycles, 52% of its initial photocurrent value was obtained. However, in comparison
to pristine MAPbI3, the photocurrent after 5 cycles decreases up to 80% and
decreases up to 22% after 10,000 cycles. The stretchability in the detector device can
be achieved by acquainting a wrinkled structure to the device. It is accomplished
by putting the device on a stretched flexible substrate followed by releasing the
tension to create a predictable wrinkled pattern. After only five stretching cycles,
the perfect MAPbI3 device exhibits considerable cracking, which significantly
reduces performance. The PS-MAPbI3, in contrast, exhibits a much lower crack
density and smaller crack size which leads to the stretching that sustained device
performance. The introduction of polystyrene to the MAPbI3 moieties reduces the
film modulus by ∼38%. Apart from this, they also lead to a three-layer structure,
which can resist the migration of ions across the grain boundaries and successively
act as a shield against the ambient environment. This work demonstrates the use of
room-temperature solution-processed platinum-gold (Pt-Au) nanoparticle chains
to address the equally significant issue of fabricating economical electrodes that can
endure considerable stretching, bending, and twisting. In comparison to the typi￾cally employed Ag and Cu nanowire electrodes in flexible electronics, the mesh of
metallic Pt–Au nanochains offers confrontation against good conductivity and oxi￾dation. Stretchable photodetector assemblies made of Pt-Au nanochain electrodes
beneath a PS-MAPbI3 film at a concentration of 1 wt% show high light switching
ratios on the order of ∼103 and can withstand high lateral strains of up to 100%.
15.2.5 Polymer–Metal Oxide-Based Photodetector
There are numerous applications of ultraviolet photodetectors in the field of missile
early warning systems, medical diagnosis, ultraviolet astronomy, communication,344 15 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetectors: Mechanism and Device Fabrication
and other emerging fields because of their potential properties. The most widely
used photovoltaics for such applications include Schottky junction type (Iqbal et al.
2020), metal–semiconductor–metal type (M-S-M) (Lv et al. 2013), and p-n junction
type (Chen et al. 2020c; Sharma et al. 2017). Due to the modest structure and
relaxed construction, p-n junction has garnered a lot of attention. The fundamental
benefit of p-n junctions is that they can function normally even in challenging
circumstances. Both 0 bias voltage and external bias voltage are compatible with
their operation. These junctions are the combination of both p- and n-type materials
with opposite charges and potential differences. This facilitates the parting of photo
generated holes and electrons. This resulted in a decrease in dark current and an
increase in responsiveness, enabling operation even without an external power
source. However, the main challenge of such UV photodetectors is to improve their
performance (Hu et al. 2017; Ouyang et al. 2021). Nowadays researchers are trying
to develop a photodetector based on p-n heterojunctions with high performance
and selectivity.
The choice of material in the development of photodetectors is a crucial part.
Semiconducting materials in this regard play an important role. They have been
used widely because of their wide bandgap. Materials like TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, and
NiO are the most commonly used material that has wide bandgap. Among all,
TiO2 gained a lot of attention due to its good physical and chemical properties
as well as they are very less toxic, cost-effective, and stable to acidic and alka￾line corrosion. They are mostly used in fields like solar cells, electrochemistry,
photodetectors, and water splitting. Among the different morphologies, 1D nano￾materials of TiO2 have a large surface area, strong electron conductivity, and
a high aspect ratio, they perform the best among the various morphologies of
TiO2. One-dimensional TiO2 can appear in a variety of morphologies, including
ribbons, rods, flakes, and tubes, but nanorods are the best option for the creation
of photodetectors (Che et al. 2021). Moreover, among all the semiconducting
materials, organic semiconductors are comparatively easy to process and have good
flexibility. As organic molecules contain different functional groups, modifying
monomer molecules is relatively easy. However, carrier mobility in the case of
organic semiconductors is very low. Therefore, a combination of both organic and
inorganic semiconducting materials can overcome these shortcomings besides
leading to some distinctive advantages. The common organic materials which
have been used so far are poly-3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl (PFH), polyaniline
(PANI), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene),
and 3,4-ethylenedfcioxythiophene: polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS). Among all
the most widely used ones are the PEDOT-based ones as they are conducting in
nature, can undergo reversible electrochemical doping and de-doping capability,
and have high stability (Madhuvilakku et al. 2020). Researchers are trying to modify
the 1D TiO2 in order to achieve good physical and chemical properties. Zhang
et al. (2015) in their work synthesized a modified TiO2 nanorod by coating them
with poly-3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl (PFH) spin-casting method. The developed
device shows low dark current as well as good responsivity. Wang et al. (2015) in
their work developed a heterojunction of polyaniline which is a p-type polymer15.2 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetector 345
and TiO2 nanorod. Under UV irradiation of 365 nm at bias 0V, this heterojunction
displays a high photocurrent of around 3.5 × 10−4. Apart from this, Tsay et al. (2021)
fabricated a photodetector based on p-n junction based on GaN-ZnO nanowires.
They have carried out a systematic study of the synthesized materials and checked
their light response performance at different voltages such as 1, 2, and 0V bias
which corresponds to high sensitivity of about 8.48 × 104 under 0V. In another work
Song et al. (2021) prepared heterojunction of Ti3C2T-GaN. This heterojunction
shows a high responsivity at 0V bias. Che et al. (2021), in their work, developed
a TiO2 nanorod array (NRA) and PEDOT-type polymer composites using simple
electrochemical polymerization. The TiO2 NRAs were allowed to grow on the FTO
substrate by a hydrothermal method where TiO2 NRAs/FTO worked as a working
electrode. The S-atoms present in the monomers can interact with the oxygen
vacancies present in the TiO2 NRAs to facilitate the forming of the polymeric films.
TiO2 NRAs in their respective composite act as a channel for light scattering and
electron transmission, while the polymer acts as the hole transport layer. This
combination constrains the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes,
which can improve the performance of the photodetector.
Tran and co-workers in their work developed a photodetector using ZnO as
a base material. However, low responsivity, complicated fabrication, and slow
speed limit their performance as a suitable photodetector. They have devel￾oped a p-n junction of graphene quantum dot (GQD) decorated on ZnO and
poly(N,N’-bis-4-butylphenyl-N,N’-bisphenyl) benzidine (Poly-TPD). In their work
firstly they have reduced the roughness and size of the ZnO using graphene quan￾tum dot. This led to increase in the transport of photogenerated carriers as well as
the charge lifetime of ZnO. They have checked the efficacy of the synthesized films
using an appropriate GQD concentration and checked the efficiency of various
ZnO:GQD devices based on charge transfer mechanism. Therefore, in comparison
to the other photodiodes, the one based on ZnO:GQD/Poly-TPD exhibits the most
balanced energy structure, improved mobility, and reduced charge recombination.
These ZnO:GQD/Poly-TPD photodetectors display remarkable performance under
365 nm irradiation, have good stability, and can endure for around 10 weeks before
experiencing severe photocurrent degeneration (Tran et al. 2021).
15.2.6 Polymer–Graphene Oxide (GO)/Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO)
Conjugate Photodetectors
Among all the 2D materials graphene can be considered as one of the ideal mate￾rials based on their both physical and chemical properties. It is a mono-elemental
material composed of sp2 hybridized C-atoms in a honeycomb arrangement. The
remarkable properties make them suitable for a variety of applications such as
photodetectors, super capacitors, modulators, and solar cells. Due to their excellent
physical, chemical, optical, electrical, and electrochemical behavior, composites
of graphene can be regarded as one of the most efficient materials. For instance,
anisotropic polymer/graphene nanocomposites provide new ways to alter charac￾teristics by changing their properties; the elements that are impacted include flaws,346 15 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetectors: Mechanism and Device Fabrication
lateral size, and layer number. By creating conductive networks for carriers, it is
possible to significantly enhance the electrical properties of polymer/graphene. By
converting light energy to phonon energy as the composite absorbs the incident
light, it is also possible to change the optical properties of polymer/graphene
composites. However, the fabrication of GO is a bit difficult and destruction can
occur during its transfer which can limit mass production. To overcome such
difficulties, researchers are trying to use reduced graphene oxide (rGO) which can
be synthesized using some easy and economical procedures. The devices based on
rGO and rGO-composite possess high efficiency in different fields due to their large
surface area, easy synthesis method, and cost effectiveness. This can be used for
different fields such as sensing, green energy, and energy storage devices. The main
advantage of rGO is that it has different reduction levels, which can be achieved
by varying the annealing temperature. The performances of optoelectronic devices
such as high selectivity,responsivity, detectivity, prolonged carrierlifetime, and light
absorption can be improved by structure and surface engineering.Just like graphene
composites, the use of rGO can also be beneficial for different applications. The
incorporation of rGO flakes in polymer matrices like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) can
enhance and modify the desirable properties of the rGO-polymer-based films. Apart
from such exceptional properties, the devices based on such membranes are hardly
reported although both covalent and non-covalent approaches ensure the excellent
dispersion of rGO flakes. Shih et al. (2022), in their work, developed a new method
for the fabrication of low-power photodetectors of rGO-PVA films. The surface
modification of such membranes enhances the performance and light response of
such photodetectors which indicates the decrease of aggregation level as well as
defective edges of rGO flakes. By controlling the percentage of PVA in rGO, one can
enhance the detectivity as well asselectivity of the synthesized photodetectors. They
have done surface engineering of rGO/PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) films to enhance the
performance of photodetectors. Even when the photodetector is operated at a low
bias of 0.3V, the PVA/rGO photodetector’s on/off ratio is 3.5 times better than that
of the rGO photodetector, and its detectivity is 53% better.
A photodetector which can convert light into electrical signals has potential
efficacy in different areas like night vision, weather surveillance, missile guidance,
imaging, sensing, communication, and spectroscopy. Photodetectors are of two
categories namely, thermal and photonic detectors.
(i) Thermal or photothermoelectric (PTE) detectors: This type of detector involves
thermoelectric and photothermal conversion processes. They are responsive at
ultra-broad bands without any cooling unit as well as external bias. However,
the efficiency of such detectors mainly depends on the Seebeck coefficient of
the thermoelectric materials and the difference in temperatures of the materials
(Xiong et al. 2021).
(ii) Photonic detectors: These are based on the photoconductive and photoelectric
effects of semiconductors. In the case of conventional semiconductors, only the
photons which have energy >h𝜐 can be detected. The main advantage of such
devicesisthat they are highly sensitive and have narrow responsive bandwidths.15.2 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetector 347
However, they need a cryogenic cooling unit as the dark current of such semi￾conductors is very high at room temperature. This will lead to an increase in the
size and weight of the detector and limits their practical usability. So scientists
are in search of small detectors without any cooling unit (Xiong et al. 2021).
Due to their intriguing properties, semiconductors are the preferred material for
the creation of various optical and electrical devices. The ability to remove both
inhomogeneous properties and crystal defects is a major benefit of small-sized crys￾tal materials. Tiny materials are straightforward to analyze, and excellent material
production makes the optoelectronics applications for these materials clear. They
trap and scatter incident light, for example, and have a greater surface-to-volume
ratio than their bulk counterparts (Graniel et al. 2018; Yildiz et al. 2016; Sharstniou
et al. 2017; Vickers 2017).
In order to build optoelectronics, semiconducting devices must have a broad
band gap in order to detect a variety of wavelengths and energies. This requirement
can be met by two different organic, inorganic, or hybrid materials, as opposed to
some expensive or underwhelming inorganic materials. Heterojunctions created
specifically with nanoscale materials can therefore provide the opportunity to
detect signals of different energies. This desire for electro-optical devices may be
met by inorganic hybrid heterojunctions and rGO-PVP (polyvinyl pyrrolidone)
fibers. Despite the potential for widespread usage of graphene-based materials due
to their intriguing features, photodetectors produced from them have larger dark
currents and higher power consumption.
Graphene or rGO can be combined with the appropriate nanostructured material
to create composites to overcome this drawback. rGO has numerous advantages
over graphene, including the ability to combine with other materials to create
different composites, which makes it more advantageous in many ways. It has
been extensively employed in numerous fields, including electrical devices and
biosensors, due to its exceptional qualities, including ease of processing, scalable
production at low cost, flexibility, and high potential (Kuilla et al. 2010; Herranz
et al. 2010; Shao et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2012). Apart from their advantages, it has
some drawbacks such as poor solubility for the formation of films on a particular
substrate. To overcome such disadvantages, rGO/polymer is recommended which
exhibits higher dispersion stability. PVP works well as a polymer and has excellent
film-forming properties. It is also readily soluble in water. To prepare an appropriate
viscous solution, it is therefore needed a sufficient amount of organic ingredients
at which the uniform dispersion of rGO can be obtained. Additionally, PVP has
frequently been used to improve surface capabilities of rGO and PVP as a stabilizer
encourages the uniform distribution of the rGO because of the potent – interactions
between the molecules of graphene and PVP. It’s evident that for the deposition of
rGO onto the Si substrate utilizing the electrospinning technique a suitably viscous
solution of material must be given (Khalili and Chenari 2020). As a result of PVP’s
excellent film formation, superior compatibility, and big area, it has frequently
been used in the fabrication of nanocomposite polymer films. For this reason, the
electrospinning approach for the deposition of PVP-rGO film on Si substrate for348 15 Organic-Polymer-Based Photodetectors: Mechanism and Device Fabrication
device applications was developed. When used as an interfacial layer in electronic
devices to enhance the electrical properties of metal–semiconductor (MS) Schottky
diodes, PVP, which is an organic substance, offers numerous properties like ease of
processing, cost-effectiveness, high water solubility, and flexibility (Alptekin and
Alt𝚤ndal 2019).
Xiong et al. (2021), in their work, constructed a photodetector with broadband by
coating a uniform photothermal layer on a thermistor. There is a conversion of light
energy to heat due to the photothermal effect, which is then reflected by the voltage
variation of the thermistor. They have synthesized a photothermal layer with high
efficacy via encapsulating rGO film into a PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) layer. The
photodetectors based on rGO/PDMS exhibit high responsivity, broad spectral range
(400–1300 nm), and good response. The simulation of sunlight at 0.8 kW m−2 shows
responsivity up to 176.9V W−1 with a response-recovery time of about ∼80 s. At 473,
532, and 808 nm a laser emission can also be detected with high responsivities of
about 15.6, 14.6, and 19.4V W−1, respectively. These rGO/PDMS films are not only
considered as high-performing photothermal film but also create an effective plan
for broadband photodetectors.
Apart from the advantages of rGO-based materials for the development of
photodetectors, there are still some defects and aggregation in them which can
effectively limit their performances in photodetectors. To overcome such difficul￾ties, one has to control the composition of rGO, which can be considered as one
of the vital factors for the improvement of their performances in different fields.
In this regard, the interconnection of rGO and polymers can effectively modify the
morphologies which can improve the enactment of devices.
15.3 Conclusion
In conclusion, it can be stated that the development of photodetectors from various
organic and inorganic materials is a very important domain of research due to its
wide range of practical applications. In this regard, designing new organic poly￾mers plays a vital role as it offers the versatility of use in fabricating photodetector
device architectures. Therefore, researchers around the globe have been working
in developing polymers and polymer composites with superior photophysical and
mechanical properties. A discussion about the available polymers used in photode￾tector fabrication is demonstrated in the book chapter. However, it is realized that
there isstill a wide scope forimprovement and many other new thingsto be explored.
Forinstance,synthesis of polymersis generally time consuming process and requires
chemicalsin substantial amount.It may lead to the accidentalrelease of chemicalsto
the environment. To be able to solve that, alternative chemicals and greener synthe￾sis routes can be employed for the synthesis of polymers. Another way to minimize
chemical pollution is to use polymeric materials that are abundantly available in
nature which will not only provide the necessary photophysical properties required
for fabricating photodetector but also lower the cost of production.References 349

16.1 Introduction
In various industries like chemical and petrochemical, separation and purification
processes have vital applications like purification of raw materials and removal of
unwanted substances (Nunes et al. 2020). Besides these, separation technology has
also great role in the treatment of pollutants generated from these industries (Li
2019). Membrane technology has been proven superior among the separation and
purification processesin terms of efficient and easy separation.It works under a very
simple permeation procedure which is easy to install and operate, and can reduce
the cost by consuming minimum energy (Lee et al. 2011). Membrane technology has
several other important advantages, e.g. high separation efficiency, ease of scaling,
and avoidance of generating harmful by-products(Adler et al. 2000). A typical mem￾brane separation technique has been depicted in Figure 16.1. Organic solvents are
widely used in the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries which need to be
separated or purified at some point (Zeng et al. 2017). However, the corrosive nature
of the organic solvents for various separating media makes organic solvent separa￾tion very difficult in terms of the selectivity and durability of the separating media.
Polymers and their derivatives play an important role during separation and purifi￾cation process and act as a vital component in the separating media, but most of them
are completely or partially soluble in organic solvents, which hamper the selectivity
and permeability as well as the durability of the separating media. Thus, it is quite
essential to develop organic-solvent-resistant polymers having strong capability to
resist degradation from the organic solvents (Marchetti et al. 2014).
In recent days, membrane technology has been facing lots of challenges due to
rapid industrialization and high requirement in medical technologies. Separation
of organic solvents is a challenge in order to minimize their severe impacts on
environment as well as ecosystems. Organic solvents are commonly used in the
pharmaceutical industry to extract high-value products. However, the processes for

recycling, discarding, and reusing organic solvents are very expensive. To mitigate
these day-to-day problems related to management of organic solvents, develop￾ment of organic-solvent-resistant (OSR) membranes is becoming an important
alternative.
OSR membranes can be efficiently used in nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, for￾ward osmosis, ultrafiltration as well as pervaporation of organic solvents. Also, they
can be extensively used in solvent recovery, separation and purification of solutes in
food industry, pharmaceutical, and other chemical industries. However, designing
an excellent OSR membrane is still very challenging (Marchetti et al. 2014).
Solvent-resistant nanofiltration based on membrane materials was reviewed by
Vankelecom and their group in 2008 (Vandezande et al. 2008). Recent developments
in OSR membrane and various mechanisms behind it were reviewed by Marchetti
and their group (Marchetti et al. 2014). The sustainability issue related to the organic
solvent nanofiltration was accessed by Szekely et al. (2014). Bye et al. in another
review reported about the materials that may have potential application as an
organic-solvent-resistant material. Development of cellulose-acetate-based mem￾branes wasthe first attempt to separate organic solvents(xylene from ethanol-xylene
mixture), and after that it was used as the base polymer in polymeric membranes
for the use in organic separation. Cross-linked Lenzing P84 polyimide-based
membranes are also very much effective for organic separation. Other polymers
which have been extensively used in organic solvent separation and purifications
even in harsh conditions also are polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyacrylates,
perfluorinated polymers, etc. (Galizia and Bye 2018). In this chapter, we have briefly
discussed OSR membranes based on organic polymers and their applications in
separation science.
16.2 Importance of Organic Polymers in Separation
Science
Membrane, a separation barrier, has played an important role in separation science
and technology, which is used in various industries (Geens et al. 2007). Membranes
have been extensively used for separation and purification purposes of chemicals,
biochemicals, water treatment, recovery of valuable components from liquids, gas
streams, etc. (Gould et al. 2001). Separation processes account for 50–90% of capital
investment in most chemical industries. Separating the value-added product from16.3 OSR Membranes: Materials and Classifications 357
the organic solvent is a difficult task. To continue, membrane separation technology
is preferred because of its ability to separate concentrated product without the
use of high temperatures. Aside from these, the food and chemical industries
make extensive use of organic solvent purification, recovery, and separation (Ren
et al. 2021). The main challenge with membrane-based separation in contact with
organic solvents is the membrane’s stability and durability. When the membrane is
in contact with a solvent for an extended period of time, it fouls. This fouling arises
because of the possible interactions between the polymer of the membrane and the
feed liquid. Plasticization and swelling cause pore blockage, which is referred to as
fouling (Ulbricht 2020). Most of the organic solvents can cause swelling in polymeric
membranes which ultimately lead to pore blockage. Common organic solvents that
are responsible for membrane fouling and pore blockage during organic separations
include acetone, chloroform, toluene, benzene, tetrachloroethane, toluene, diethyl
ether, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), methanol, and 1-octene. Petroleum
industry wastewater also contains lots of organic solvents like n-hexane and cresol
which also affect the membrane morphology and hence its performance (Marchetti
et al. 2014; Al-Khalid and El-Naas 2018). To meet this type of complication and
to attain the highest flux as well as selectivity, membrane material should be
selected very carefully. Thus, the manufacture of OSR membranes to avoid fouling
has become a great matter of concern in order to make membrane technology an
irreplaceable one.
16.3 OSR Membranes: Materials and Classifications
Recently, membrane material development with strong resistivity toward organic
solvents has become a growing topic of research. Such materials are specialty
polymers, metal organic frameworks (MOF), covalent organic frameworks
(COF), polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), carbon-based materials, and
conjugated polymers. These can offer a solution to OSR membrane fouling. Based
on the material type, membranes can be classified into different types, such as
inorganic membranes, polymeric membranes, etc.
16.3.1 Inorganic Membrane Materials
Ceramic membrane can be prepared by using inorganic ceramic materials. In this
type of membrane, alumina, titanium oxide, silicon oxide, zirconia, etc. are reported
to be taken and coated on the membrane surface, followed by high-temperature
treatment (Namvar-Mahboub and Pakizeh 2013). The structure of commercial
membranes consists of three layers: a porous support layer, an interlayer, and a
separative layer. Chemical stability: resistivity toward acids/bases/organic solvents,
anti-microbial activity, mechanical strength and thermal stability are the main
advantages associated with a ceramic membrane, which make it more suitable than
a polymeric membrane. However, in comparison to polymeric materials, they are358 16 OSR Polymeric Membranes for Emerging Applications in Separation Science
more brittle, hence difficult to upscale (Omar et al. 2022). It is seen from the litera￾ture that less variation in materials is possible for ceramic membranes as compared
to polymeric materials. Therefore, hybrid composite membranes containing both
polymers and inorganic materials are of great importance, especially for designing
OSR membranes (Ren et al. 2021).
16.3.2 Organic Membrane Materials
The reported polymersforfabrication of(OSR) membranesinclude polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) (Wu et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2020), polyimide (PI) (Omar et al. 2022), polypropy￾lene (PP) (Li et al. 2018), polysulfone (PSf) (Kosaraju and Sirkar 2008) and polyani￾line (PA) (Peyravi et al. 2012) etc. Using an interfacial polymerization reaction, a
thin, dense film can be obtained on the poroussupporting structure of the membrane
(He et al. 2021). This may decrease the flux of the membrane, but the selectivity
increases extensively. The addition of different additives and pore-inducing agents
may also have a huge impact in selectivity and permeability of the membrane (Yang
et al. 2021; Lalia et al. 2013; Buonomenna and Bae 2015).
Due to the presence of high number of polar groups with high biodegradability
and biocompatibility, polyvinyl alcohols (PVA) are widely used in designing (OSR)
membranes (Teodorescu et al. 2018; Gimenes et al. 2007). Polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) is used as a membrane material, especially for the pervaporation separa￾tion approach of organic solvents (Si et al. 2022; Li et al. 2013). Polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) membranes incorporated with FeOOH (Zhang et al. 2019), modified by
tannic acid (Tham and Chung 2020), modified by chitosan (Musale and Kumar
2000), and composites with hyperbranched polyester (Wei et al. 2012) were also
used for the fabrication of membranes with solvent-resistant properties. A nat￾ural polysaccharide, chitosan, blended with cellulose (Thakur and Voicu 2016),
composite of chitosan with 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde on a porous support of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is used as thin-film composite (TFC) mem￾branes (Park et al. 2021). Other polymers used as membrane materials for the
fabrication of OSR membranes include polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) (George et al.
2022), polyethylene (Heidari and Mahdavi 2021), Teflon (Shi and Chung 2020),
polybenzimidazoles (PBI) (Tashvigh and Chung 2019), polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) (Zhang et al. 2020), and poly(ether sulfone) (PES) (George et al. 2022). A
study reported on a PEEK membrane fabricated using the phase inversion method,
controlling its pore size using heat treatment, and the effect of these pore sizes
on the removal efficiency of the membrane toward MB (methylene blue), RB
(rose-Bengal-sodium salt), and BSA (bovine serum albumin). In organic solvents
and even in strong acids, the membrane shows very good reproducibility (Cao et al.
2020).
16.3.3 Conjugated Microporous Polymers (CMPs): Trending Novel
Membrane Materials
CMPs are special category of porous polymeric materials that are formed by
combining an extended π-conjugation with a permanently microporous skeleton.16.4 Types of Membrane Used for the Treatment of Organic Solvent 359
Organic building blocks like CMPs exhibit some important characteristics like
high specific surface area, low molecular density, and strong resistance to organic
solvents, which make them superior as an ideal organic polymer to be used in
organic-solvent separation and purification. Organic building blocks are easy to
functionalize as compared to other novel membrane materials like activated carbon
and graphite. CMPs are microporous materials that have an extended conjugate
system and are connected to each other by multiple C—C bonds or aromatic systems
(Cooper 2009). Copper created the first CMPs in 2009 by combining aryl halides
and two-dimensional aryl alkylde. Due to their exceptional advantages like intrinsic
three-dimensional porous microstructure, considerable specific surface area, varied
synthetic methods, and superior stability, CMPs have gained much attention in the
field of separation and purification (Jiang et al. 2007). In recent years, CMPs have
found extensive application in environmental remediation, energy sources, and
catalysis. CMPs can be used in harsh conditions of temperature, acidity, basicity, and
organic solvent due to their prominentstability. Moreover, CMPs have been showing
potential in pollutant recovery as well as organic solvent purification and separation
as they have insoluble properties and a highly extended conjugated structure (Xu
et al. 2013). The design of a superhydrophobic surface for easy absorption of oil
and non-polar organic compounds was done by Lee et al. where they used superhy￾drophobic open-pore structured CMPs. Lipophilic material was created in thatstudy
by combining hydrophobic CMPs and hydrophilic sponge (Lee and Cooper 2020).
16.4 Types of Membrane Used for the Treatment
of Organic Solvent
Organic solvents with high purity have been extensively used in chemicals, petro￾chemicals, and pharmaceutical industries during synthesis of organic materials,
their separation, and purification. Due to strict protocols for environmental safety,
organic solvents can’t be reused or directly disposed. Conventional methods like
distillation or evaporation often cost a lot, and energy consumption in these
processes is very high. Pervaporation (PV), organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN),
organic solvent reverse osmosis (OSRO), organic solvent forward osmosis (OSFO),
and organic solvent ultrafiltration (OSU) are some advanced membrane-based
separation processes which have been used in the separation of organic solvents.
16.4.1 Pervaporation (PV)
PV refers to a molecular-level liquid separation technology which proceeds through
two mechanisms; evaporation with selective permeation (Yun et al. 2017). By this
membrane-based separation technique a mixture of solvents can be separated on
the basis of difference in their diffusion properties (Rdzanek et al. 2018). In PV
partial pressure of the components that is to be separated is increased on the feed
side whereas in the permeate side, a low partial pressure is maintained by using a
vacuum pump (Paredes et al. 2017). The membrane selectively allows the passes360 16 OSR Polymeric Membranes for Emerging Applications in Separation Science
of components under the pressure difference and the components condense on
the downstream side. Separation of isomeric mixtures can also be easily done by
PV method, which cannot be done by the conventional methods (Santoro et al.
2017). PV membranes should be improved in order to make them organic solvent
resistant. Low permeability is a limitation in PV membrane technique, and it is
only suitable for mixtures where component content is low. After a lots of research
work related to PV many mass transfer models were proposed in order to explain
PV, which includes pore flow model, the irreversible thermodynamic model, and
the solution diffusion model. In designing a suitable selective membrane, the mass
transfer model plays an important role (Van Hecke and De Wever 2017; Cheng et al.
2012).
16.4.2 Organic Solvent Nanofiltration (OSN)
Nanofiltration is the most widely used membrane separation technique used in
various industries during separation of solvents. These types of membranes have
pore size in the range of 0.5–2 nm and are effective in separating molecules of
200–1000 Da molecular weight (Marchetti and Livingston 2015; Tsarkov et al.
2012). OSN membranes has been gradually improved to meet the requirements like
organic solvent and pollution resistance, making it suitable for solvent recovery
as well as developing solvent exchange behavior in chemical synthesis (Xue et al.
2012; Cheng et al. 2012). OSN which is a green separation technique, is an efficient
way in which molecular-level separation of organic molecules can be achieved in a
single operating pressure, is also termed as solvent-resistant nanofiltration (SRNF)
(Sourirajan 1964). Saurirajan, in 1964, used a cellulose acetate membrane for the
separation of short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, and he is first to apply membrane
technology for the separation of non-aqueous systems (Loeb and Manjikian 1965).
Loeb et al. were the first to propose pressure-driven mechanism in membrane
separation for OSN (Marchetti et al. 2014). Many patents have been published by
various research groups as well as commercial laboratories for organic solvent
nanofiltration since 1980. The first commercial membrane was developed by
Grace, Davison, Koch, Solsep, and GMT in the mid-1990s (Liu et al. 2020). OSN
have industrially been highly recognized for their large-scale application in the
dewaxing process in the lubricating oil. However, OSN membrane is a new and
challenging topic as many practical problems have always occurred at the time
of its use which is needed to be solved with proper methodology (Szekely et al.
2014).
16.4.3 Organic Solvent Reverse Osmosis (OSRO)
Reverse osmosis (RO) is a completely inverse procedure to that of osmosis. In RO,
water or organic solvent overcomes the osmotic pressure, and there is a flow from
high concentration to the low concentration side which is separated by membrane
(Li et al. 2016). Pore of the membrane traps the solute particles. RO generally works
on the mechanism of dissolution–diffusion, which involves separation on the basis16.5 Modifications in Designing Membrane for Organic Solvent Purification 361
of difference in dissolution rate and diffusion rate ofsolvent and solutes(Choudhury
et al. 2018; Baroña et al. 2012). RO mostly used in the desalination of salty sea water
to produce drinking water in those areas. Nowadays, application of OSRO is also
gaining importance in the purification and separation of organic solvents (Li et al.
2016; Song et al. 2018).
16.4.4 Organic Solvent Forward Osmosis (OSFO)
It is a pressure-driven membrane separation technique which works on the mecha￾nism of difference in the osmotic pressure in both sides of the membrane. Diffusion
of solvents occurs from the concentrated feed side to the dilute permeate side (Cath
et al. 2006). Smaller flux value is observed than that measured by theoretical calcu￾lation which is due to the concentration polarization effect (Jung et al. 2011). Also,
due to external concentration polarization the difference in osmatic pressure and
flux declines (McCutcheon and Elimelech 2006). This problem can be remediated
by increasing the surface velocity in the membrane and by increasing the cross-flow
(Bai et al. 2011). However, it is difficult to improve the internal concentration gradi￾ent generated in porous layer due to its intrinsic properties. Bai et al. observed that
by reducing the membrane thickness and increasing the porosity in the membrane
the membrane performance could be greatly improved.
16.4.5 Organic Solvent Ultrafiltration (OSU)
It is also a pressure-driven membrane separation technology which works underthe
size exclusion principle. In OSU permeation of the small solute molecules occurs
while large solute molecules are rejected. The pore size range of OSU membranes
is between 1 and 100 nm. Molecular cut-off is in the range 300 and 500,000 Da (Liu
et al. 2020). Though Ultrafiltration (UF) membrane technology is mature enough,
simple, and easy to handle there are various shortcomings like swelling in organic
solvents which limits its applicability in organic solvent purification and separation.
Many studies have proved that organic polymerslike polyimide, polybenzimidazole,
and polyurea are resistant to organic solvents (Polotskaya et al. 2009). Moreover,
polyester-based polymers have also shown very good organic-solvent-resistant prop￾erty (Liu et al. 2020; Yeo et al. 2020; Baker 2012). Development of novel material
impregnated organic-polymer-based membranes is a current trend in the field of
separation and purification of organic solvents.
16.5 Modifications in Designing Membrane for Organic
Solvent Purification
A membrane which is organic solvent resistant should be stable mechanically,
chemically, and thermally. One of the drawbacks of polymeric membranes is
that they often undergo fouling, and hence flux decline occurs. Aging and com￾paction are other problems with these types of membranes. However, in termsCondenser

of mechanical, chemical, and thermal strength, ceramic membranes perform
better, and also aging and compaction are not observed in case of ceramic mem￾branes. Scaling up in this type of membrane is very difficult as it is more brittle
than that of the polymeric membranes. Ceramic membranes on the other hand
have no pores, and risk of leaching is also there. Very low operating pressure is
needed in case of ceramic membranes. But as compared to polymers there are less
variety of materials in case of ceramic membrane; also for separation of apolar
solvents ceramic membrane is not suitable as metal hydroxides are intrinsically
hydrophilic. Modification in polymeric membrane for more efficient separation
organic solvents has always been topic of interest for various research groups.
Mixed matrix membrane (MMM) is one such type of membrane in which properties
of both inorganic and polymeric membranes can be tailored in order to achieve
excellent performance in organic solvent purification and separation. These types of
membrane have been also proven to be less prone to fouling and aging. Sometimes
non-woven supports are also used in order to provide mechanical strength to the
membranes. For OSN, OSFO, OSRO, and OSU, the non-woven support should
also be organic solvent resistant and should have properties that are similar to the
polymeric membrane in order to evade formation of crinkles that often lead to
failure in membrane separation. For organic solvent separation and purification,
the membranes should be stable to the solvent systems and should be competent
to preserve their individualities. The exclusively used polymeric membranes are
(i) Integrally skinned asymmetric (ISA) membranes and (ii) thin-film composite
(TFC) membrane. Schematic representation of these type of membranes has been
given in Figures 16.2 and 16.3a,b.
16.5.1 Integrally Skinned Asymmetric (ISA) Membranes
ISA membranes possess a skin layer on top of a more porous sublayer with the same
composition. The top skin layer is formed simultaneously with the underlaying
support layer. The final membrane performance is greatly affected by the texture
of the top skinned layer. Loeb and Sourirajan used a simple phase inversion
method to create the first ISA membrane. In phase inversion, a casting solution is
precipitated by immersing it in a non-solvent bath. Due to high water absorption
and solvent loss, the casted film precipitates rapidly from the top surface down
(Park et al. 2000). The casting solution, which was originally a one-phase system,
is precipitated into a two-phase system: one is the polymer-rich phase, and the

other is the polymer-poor phase, which forms the pores in the membrane. The
membrane performance is greatly affected by the thermodynamic properties of
the polymers as well as the kinetics of the solvent–nonsolvent exchange process
(Vankelecom et al. 2005). A number of chemically as well as thermally stable
polymeric materials have been used for the preparation of phase-inversion-based
organic-solvent-resistant ISA membranes (Gevers et al. 2006; Cuperus 2005;
Livingston et al. 2013). These include PAN, PI as nanofiltration or UF supports, and
PSf, polyaniline, PBI, and PP as UF supports (Sairam et al. 2010; Li et al. 2008; Ali
et al. 2020).
16.5.2 Thin-Film Composite (TFC) Membranes
TFC membranes are fabricated by the formation of a thin film over a porous
membrane support and are done by the interfacial polymerization method, in
which a polymerization reaction occurs at the interface of two immiscible phases
that contain reactive monomers. In the TFC membrane, the overall membrane
performance can be maximized by optimizing the performance of the barrier
layer and the porous membrane support. PSf, PES, PAN, PVDF, PP, PI, and PBI
are commonly used polymers that have been used as common UF supports in
fabricating TFC membrane. The choice of the polymeric support is to be such that
it will provide mechanical and thermal stability and should be able to form defect
free top layers.
A novel TFC membrane was prepared by Ali, where he used bridged-bicyclic
triptycene tetra-acyl chloride (Trip) and m-phenylenediamine (MPD). The resulting
membrane was reported to be finely tuned microporous. Formation of cross-linked
microporous morphology and free volume in the enhanced sub-microporous region
improves the organic solvent separation efficiency of the developed membrane
(Li et al. 2020). In another study by Li et al., they used sulfothiacalix[4]arene and
sulfocalix[4]arene, which are hollow cup-shaped macrocyclic molecules, with an
aqueous MPD solution for the fabrication of a polyamide layer with trimesoyl
chloride (TMC). The formation of an ionic bond has a significant impact on the for￾mation of molecular sieving, which enhances the organic-solvent-resistant property
of the developed membrane (Li et al. 2020). An organic-solvent-resistant TFC mem￾brane was also developed by Li et al., where they used aramid nanofibers, which
provide a three-dimensionally interconnected hydrogel middle layer for efficient
permeability for methanol and acetone permeance (Li et al. 2019). Goh et al. also
developed a hollow fiber OSR membrane, employing a non-solvent-induced phase
separation technique for membrane fabrication (Goh et al. 2020). Ag/graphene
oxide quantum dots-based composite membrane was developed by Li et al.,
where organic solvent reverse osmosis was performed (Soroko and Livingston
2009).
Cross-linking with hexamethyl diamine gives rise to the substrate named
polyimide, which is responsible for tightening the microstructure. Interfacial
polymerization between polyethylene imine (PEI), piperazine (PIP), and TMC
gives rise to the polyamide (PA) thin film on the inner surface of the polyimide16.6 Application of OSR Polymeric Membranes in Different Industrial Processes 365
substrate. This combination of PEI and PA results in a loosely selective layer that
facilitates the enhancement of the flux of the organic solvent in the separation
process.
16.5.3 Mixed Matrix Membranes (MMMs)
A hybrid membrane system with tuning properties can be developed by combining
organic and inorganic polymers, which allow the formation of new membrane types
with properties of both inorganic and organic materials. These new types of mem￾branes are often termed “mixed matrix membranes”. The addition of nanostructures,
such as carbon nanomaterials, nanofibers, zeolite nanoparticles, clay, layered dou￾ble hydroxides, and fullerenes, in the polymer matrix has been extensively studied
in the field of membrane separation (Vanherck et al. 2012) as well as in organic sol￾vent nanofiltration. Membranes that comprise nanoparticles in a polymer matrix
are termed “nanocomposite membranes.” The use of nanoparticles in membrane
matrices can be done in three different ways: (i) by incorporating nanoparticles into
the membrane matrix prior to casting via phase inversion; (ii) by imbuing nanopar￾ticles onto the membrane surface; and (iii) by using nanoparticles to fill the pores
of the membrane. After incorporation of nanoparticles, the overall properties of the
membrane, like mechanical, thermal, and surface wettability, can be greatly changed
(Vanherck et al. 2012). Various MMMs have been developed by impregnation of
nanomaterialsin the polymer matrix. Common nanomaterials used for the develop￾ment of MMM are TiO2 nanoparticles, transition-metal oxide nanoparticles, cellu￾lose nanocrystal, carbon nanomaterials, etc. (Marchetti et al. 2014). Soroko and Liv￾ingston incorporated TiO2 in polyimide polymer matrix. Addition of TiO2 decreases
the macrovoidsin the membrane, and an increase in hydrophilicity of the membrane
was observed (Vanherck et al. 2011). Among common nanoparticles gold nanoparti￾cles have been extensively used for fabricating mixed matrix membrane for organic
solvent nanofiltration (Li et al. 2013; Vanherck et al. 2011; Li et al. 2019). Vanherck
and their group have developed a mixed matrix membrane where gold nanoparticles
(NPs) were impregnated over a cellulose acetate polymer matrix. They successfully
used the membrane for ethanol and isopropanol permeation. Solvent flux as well
as the membrane stability were increased significantly after impregnation of the
gold nanoparticle (Vanherck et al. 2011). In another work, a novel mixed matrix
membrane was designed where gold NPs were added to a polymer solution of PI.
Addition of gold NPs over the membrane matrix decreases the macrovoids in the
membrane; also, the flux of isopropanol was increased up to 168% (Homayoonfal
et al. 2013).
16.6 Application of OSR Polymeric Membranes
in Different Industrial Processes
OSR membranes have various applications in the pharmaceutical industry, mostly
for drug purification, peptide synthesis, and solvent recovery. Membrane-based366 16 OSR Polymeric Membranes for Emerging Applications in Separation Science
separation aids in drug structure, purity, and product quality retention (Li et al.
2018). Furthermore, the membrane’s energy efficiency and ease of handling aid in
the removal of trace organic pollutants and salt. When titanium carbide nanosheets
(2–4 μm) incorporated into MXene membranes are used for antibiotic separation
from aqueous and ethanol-based solutions, a successful separation performance
has been achieved. Again, for selective concentration of ibuprofen, an Au and
polyaniline-based nanocomposite membrane has been used and found useful.
Since a large quantity of solvents such as ethanol, acetone, methanol, ethyl acetate,
and isopropanol are needed in herb production, OSR membrane can play a very
important role in these processes. A ceramic membrane of varied pore sizes is also
found effective in the removal of impurities from Shuanghuanglian water extract.
Again, nanofiltration membranes can be used for the concentration of Angelica
sinensis extract (Fu et al. 2020). The development of a PI based membrane has been
reported (Marchetti et al. 2014), where the membrane is used for concentration
of the spramycin antibiotic. In comparison to the conventional extraction of this
antibiotic from bacterial broth using butyl acetate, the membrane-based treatment
shows efficient separation with long durability. The membrane shows solvent
resistance, and about 99% rejection is achieved. Also, membrane application in
pharmaceuticals can also help in the recovery and reuse of solvents. In terms
of energy efficiency and in terms of solvent recovery, OSN has been shown to
be less intense than distillation. It is common practice in the pharmaceutical
industry to synthesize important chemicals in organic media, which involves
many steps along the synthetic route. To overcome the solvent resistivity, two
nanofiltration membranes, viz., MPF-50 and MPF-60 (Sheth et al. 2003), are
reported to have been prepared, and their application has been successfully done
in solvent exchange with methanol. OSN membrane technology can also be used
in the pharmaceutical industry for purification. In order to get better purification
performance than conventional processes, membranes or membrane processes
should be highly selective and show better separation. Since the purification step
is a very important step in pharmaceuticals and costs almost half of the capital
investment, improvisation in this step should be given more priority. The sustain￾ability of membrane-based API purification when performed in organic solvents
is a great matter of concern. Membranes outperform traditional purification
processes such as recrystallization and chromatographic techniques in terms of
energy, continuous processing, large scaling up, and so on. Thus, to improve OSN
membranes, fabrication is done with molecular imprinting, which can be used
for three-way ternary system separation (Zhu et al. 2010). However, membrane
technology has been developing day by day to offer high performance at low energy
costs.
16.6.1 Separation of Organic Solvent from Solvent Mixtures
Organic solvent separation from its mixture with water or other solvents is very
common practice in chemical and petroleum industries. The problem arises in
the separation of azeotropes, near azeotropes as well as for the substances that16.6 Application of OSR Polymeric Membranes in Different Industrial Processes 367
are thermally unstable. For organic solvent separation, PV is commonly used
which is a liquid separation technology at molecular level and involves evaporation
and membrane permeability. An OSRO membrane of polyketone support and
grafted with polyamide layer is prepared out to apply in organic liquid mixture
separation. For solvents toluene, pentane, hexane, and heptane, separation factor
obtained with this membrane is 8.4, 11.1, 14.9, and 38.0, respectively (Liu et al.
2020). In fine chemicals, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals, anhydrous organic
solvents are insoluble and hence dehydration of such solvents is very important.
PV has been getting increased interest recently in dehydration of such solvents.
Hydroxyl-polyimide-containing polybenzoxazole membrane can be prepared via
in situ thermally induced transformation, and this membrane shows a separation
factor of 2000 and permeation of 2000 gm−2 h−1 in isopropyl alcohol dehydration
(Xu et al. 2016). Cross-linking can be introduced into membrane. One such example
is the cross-linking between polybenzimidazole-based membrane surface with
polystyrene sulfonic acid chains (Han et al. 2015). This membrane is found to be
stable as well as have rich hydrophilicity and is utilized for 80% tetrahydrofuran
dehydration.
16.6.2 Food Processing
In food processing, OSR membrane have applications in natural ingredients
purification, grain and oil processing, etc. In fruit and vegetable juice processing,
membrane separation techniques such as nanofiltration and PV can be used
with retention of texture as well as freshness of the juice (Conidi et al. 2020).
Membrane can also be used for juice concentration via osmotic distillation with
quality retention (Rehman et al. 2019). Membrane shows efficient sunflower pectin
extraction at a pilot scale using ultrafiltration and microfiltration and results in
greater than 90% pectin concentration with high yield (13.3%) (Muñoz-Almagro
et al. 2020). Polypropylene-based and hybrid ZIF-8/PDMS membranes are being
used for concentration of apple juice (Julian et al. 2020) and for separation of
aromatic volatile component from blackberry juice, respectively (Rao et al. 2020).
In dairy production also membrane technology can be used. Milk fat globule
isolation (Hansen et al. 2020), milk phospholipid extraction and concentration
are some examples of works done with membrane. From soybean milk, peptides
with antioxidant and antibacterial properties can be prepared with the help of
membrane cross-flow separation-assisted membrane bioreactor (Ren et al. 2021).
In manufacturing of beer, wine, and low-alcohol wine production membrane can
be used. PV technique is useful in beer industries for volatile compound separation
(Paz et al. 2017). Recently, attention is focused on healthy drinking with non- or
low-alcoholic drinks.
16.6.3 Wastewater Treatment
Water sources have become more and more polluted day by day, which results in
the deterioration of ecological balance. To maintain the balance, immediate action368 16 OSR Polymeric Membranes for Emerging Applications in Separation Science
must be taken to address urban sewage. For the treatment of municipal waste water,
solvent-resistant membranes have been used and are still progressing. Nanofiltration
membranes can be used for lupanine removal from wastewater via solvent extrac￾tion (Esteves et al. 2020). Membranes can be used for the separation of oily emul￾sion from waste water against oily phases such as hexane, petroleum ether, hex￾adecane, and soybean oil. An ultrathin membrane of polydopamine on a porous
substrate of polyketone has been prepared and found useful for this purpose (Zhang
et al. 2019). Another example of organic wastewater treatment via degradation is a
three-channel Fe3O4/PVDF hollow fiber membrane with catalytic activity. Here, the
membrane is able to remove methylene blue and also has antifouling characteristics
due to the Fenton reaction (Huang et al. 2020). An innovative technology called the
self-forming dynamic membrane bioreactor (SFDMBR) can be an attractive alter￾native for wastewater treatment that includes biological treatment in addition to
membrane separation. This system can remove COD and ammonia up to 70% and
90%, respectively, and nitrogen as well. The passing of an ozone/air mixture can
help in the cleaning of membrane bioreactors as well as waste water. Membrane
bioreactors (MBRs) in conjunction with membrane biofilm reactors are also being
researched for use in organics and nitrogen-containing compounds (Hasar 2009).
This investigation shows the successful oxidation of COD and removal of nitrogen.
The MBR system is very advantageous in terms of low sludge production, small
floor space, and simple processing, which make it environmentally benign and cost
effective.
16.7 Commercial OSR membrane
Due to easily tunable microstructures and ease of processing, polymeric mem￾branes can be used for commercial purposes as OSR membranes. The commercial
membranes available with organic solvent resistance include PI: StarMem 122, PI:
StarMem 240, PI: DuraMem 300, PI: DuraMem 500, PI: DuraMem 900, PI: PuraMem
280, PI: DuraMem 150, PI: PuraMem 600, PI: PuraMem S600, PI: PuraMem 420,
Nanopros S-3011, PI: DuraMem 150, PA: NF-90, PA: NF-270, PA: BW30XLE, PDMS:
MPF-34, PDMS: MPF-44, PDMS: MPF-50, PDMS: PERVAP 4060, and PDMS:
MPF-60 (Tandel et al. 2021).
Different works using these commercial membranes and their potential toward
solvent resistance have been reported. The recovery of solvent from pharmaceu￾tical mixtures was reported using DuraMem 150 and StarMem 122. In the study,
the solvents in which the separation performances were carried out included
methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, ethyl acetate, and ethanol-ethyl acetate, whereas
the pharmaceuticals included alprazolam, imatinib mesylate, donepezil HCl,
riluzole, atenolol, disperse orange 3, and disperse red 19. DuraMem 150 showed
better performance as compared to StarMem 122. A high removal efficiency of 99%
was found for Disperse Red 19, and 95% rejection was found for Disperse Orange
3 mixtures in the case of DuraMem 150. DuraMem 150 membranes were more
stable in organic solvents as compared to StarMem 122, as StarMem 122 possesses16.7 Commercial OSR membrane 369
high swelling tendency as compared to DuraMem 150. Except for the ethyl acetate
solution containing donepezil, DuraMem 150 shows >90% rejection for all the
mentioned pharmaceutical mixtures (Darvishmanesh et al. 2011). Performance
of PI-StarMem 122 was observed against Sudan 408 in the presence of solvents
like ethanol, methanol, acetone, methyl-ethyl ketone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and
toluene (Darvishmanesh et al. 2010). PI: starMem 240 works well as a solvent
against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), IPA, hexane, and ethanol, and performs best
in the separation of methylene blue when IPA is used. But when the used solvent
is ethanol, the membrane gives very low rejection efficiency. The rejection of the
membrane may be affected by the solvent treatment, which was done before the
performance analysis (Zhang et al. 2017). PDMS: MPF-44 membranes showed 93%
removal of Erythrosine B in the presence of methanol as a solvent (Volkov et al.
2009) and good removal of methylene blue in presence of ethanol, IPA, hexane and
CCl4 as solvents, respectively (Zhang et al. 2017). 97% removal of Erythrosine B
was observed for PDMS: MPF-50 in presence of methanol as a solvent. Again, 98%
removal of tetraoctyl-ammonium bromide was observed for PDMS: MPF-60 using
methanol as a solvent (Morshed et al. 2020). In presence of THF, PI: DuraMem
150 showed very high rejection of polystyrene oligomers (approx. 99%) (Solomon
et al. 2012). PI: DuraMem 500, PI: DuraMem 900, PI: PuraMem 280 & PI: PuraMem
380 membranes show removal of methyl vanillate when ethyl acetate is used as a
solvent (Werhan et al. 2012). PuraMem 280 is also effective when toluene is used
as a solvent and shows good rejection efficiency against PS oligomers (Siddique
et al. 2013). In another study of the performance of commercial membranes such
as DuraMem 150, DuraMem 300, DuraMem 500, PuraMem 280, and PuraMem 600
membranes gave good performance by showing rejection of glyceryl trilinolate up
to 100%, 100%, 85.8% (approx.), 96.8% (approx.), and 88.5% (approx.), respectively,
when acetone is used as a solvent (Shi et al. 2019). DuraMem 150 membranes are
effective against atenolol, removing it with 97.5% efficiency in methanol (Shi et al.
2019). DuraMem 500 and PuraMem S600 membranes were used for the removal of
palladium (II) acetate in the solvents IPA, methanol, and toluene, and it is seen that
the effect of the solvent was more prominent in the case of DuraMem 500. On the
other hand, the rejection efficiency of the PuraMem S600 membrane was mainly
governed by the ligand effect (the ligands with which the palladium (II) acetate
combined to form a stable catalyst) (Shen et al. 2020). DuraMem 500 and PuraMem
420 showed good separation performance with rejection efficiencies of 94.6% and
98%, respectively, against acid fuchsin when the solvent used was acetonitrile
(Joseph et al. 2017).
Park et al. reported a polyethylene-incorporated polyamide-based TFC membrane
having better tensile strength, chemical stability, and NaCl rejection performance
as compared to commercial SWC4+ (RO) membranes (Park et al. 2018). The
commercial OSR membranes of the MPF series also show very effective resistance
toward organic solvents like acetone, hexanol, cyclohexanol, 3- propanol, methanol,
3-butanone, and other lower alcohols (Ren et al. 2021). Due to the inexpensiveness
of the commercially available TFC membranes based on PA, they are also used
in organic-solvent-resistant applications but are not as efficient as reported in the370 16 OSR Polymeric Membranes for Emerging Applications in Separation Science
literature. Even commercially available organic-solvent-resistant membranes are
only effective over a limited temperature range, and it is difficult for a membrane to
be resistant to a wide range of organic solvents (Tandel et al. 2021).
16.8 Current Status of OSR Membrane
A high volume of organic solvents is used in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and
other related industries. However, the separation and purification processes of these
solvents are energy intensive, and the reusability rate of these solvents is very low
(resulting in massive waste generation). Being an energy-efficient process with an
easy operating procedure, OSR membrane is a greener approach for separation and
purification of organic solvents as compared to other existing separation methods
(Ren et al. 2021; Joshi and Adhikari 2019; Hermans et al. 2015).
The petrochemical industry’s waste water contains varieties of inorganic elements
as well as hydrocarbonsin dissolved or non-dissolved form. Normal polymeric mem￾branes get swollen easily and cannot tolerate harsh chemical environments. There￾fore, in this case,specially designed OSR membrane are highly needed to recover oil
products, produce quality water, and maintain the high reproducibility and lifespan
of the membrane (Bhuyan et al. 2023; Lim et al. 2017). Similarly, OSR membrane has
the potential for dye separation in the dye industry, processing in the food indus￾try, solvent recovery, and the purification of drugs in the pharmaceutical industry
(Baggio et al. 2021).
PET, being a low-cost material, is widely used for packaging application. The
value addition to the plastic bottles which are composed of PET can be reused for
separation and purification application. A chitosan-modified recycled PET-based
membrane for effective oil–water separation (>95% rejection) (Park et al. 2021).
A TFC membrane with an ultrathin layer of very high selectivity was obtained by
interfacial polymerization of TA (tannic acid) and priamine on the porous support
of recycled PET using p-Cymene (less toxic as compared to most of the organic
solvents) as organic phase (Liu et al. 2019). A composite PET/PTFE (polytetrafluo￾roethylene) membrane combined with dopamine wasreported by Liu et al. for more
than 99% separation of oil and water with good recyclability (Lindman et al. 2010).
Being a widely available natural amphiphilic polymer, cellulose can also be used for
fabrication of hydrophilic membrane applicable for oil water separation (Park and
Barnett 2001). As compared to ultrafiltration, nanofiltration membrane possesses
pores of smaller diameter hence are more selective and can give better separation
of oil–water emulsion even at high pressure to provide quality water (Junaidi et al.
2021). Different new-generation carbon-based nanomaterials/nanocomposites
such as GO (graphene oxide) and CNT (carbon nanotubes) were also been reported
for effective separation of oil and water (Gu et al. 2014; Saththasivam et al.
2018).
Common polymeric materials used in the fabrication of OSR membrane tend to
swell in the presence of organic solvents (Baggio et al. 2021). Therefore, they show
poor organic solvent resistance and tend to get degraded in organic solvents. ToReferences 371
overcome the limitations, a variety of hybrid as well as novel or specialized mem￾brane materials, as well as a membrane fabrication approach, should be used. For
high separation efficiency, researchers have reported cellulose-based, intrinsically
structured-material-based, carbon-based, and other low-cost material-based OSR
membrane (Park et al. 2018). Various studies have been conducted to improve
the separation performance and mechanical strength of the OSR membrane with
improved resistance to a wide range of organic solvents.
16.9 Conclusion
Industrial processes use large amounts of solvents during the production, separa￾tion, and purification of organic compounds. When disposed of in natural systems,
these organic solvents can have a high risk of damaging the sustainability of the
ecosystem.Conventional methodsforseparation and purification of organic solvents
often fail due to various issues like corrosion during separation, swelling of separat￾ing materials, and low selectivity in separation. Membrane separation, despite being
known as the most simple and efficient method for organic solvent separation and
purification, faces numerous challenges such as fouling, swelling caused by organic
solvents, and corrosion caused by organic solvent action. Modification of the poly￾meric membranes to make them superior for organic separation in terms of flux and
separation efficiency as well as resistant to organic solvent systems is a current chal￾lenge for various research groups. Inorganic membranes are one alternative that is
resistant to organic solvents. However, the scalability of inorganic membrane-based
separation isstill a challenging task. On the other hand,some organic polymers have
solvent-resistant properties, whereas others can be modified by means of hybridizing
inorganic and organic membrane systems or by chemical cross-linking. It is nec￾essary to reduce the free volume, inhibiting the inflammation in the membrane
system and improving the solvent-resistant property of the polymeric membrane
so as to make the membrane efficient for organic solvent separation and purifi￾cation. Designing an excellent membrane structure for mitigating the day-to-day
challenges and avoiding the traditional problems in the separation of organic sol￾vents has received more attention. This new research area and its corresponding
applications will definitely advance the evolution of membrane technology.

17.1 Introduction
The main source of environmental pollution is the waste of long-lasting plastics.
Most of these materials are single-use packages. The extent of pollution is unimag￾inable; the debris of plastic is being reported even in the deep oceans. The damage
done to the environment cannot be undone; however, further destruction can be
controlled by replacing the synthetic plastic with bio-based, biodegradable polymers.
17.1.1 Environmental Concerns Raised by Synthetic Materials
The large rise in the production of plastic and the increased usage in daily life have
influenced the environment to a great extent (Pan et al. 2020). The accumulation
of these synthetic materials has endangered life on the earth (Geyer et al. 2017).
Approximately, 390.7 million metric tons of plastic was produced in 2021, which is
4% increase from the previous year (Statista n.d.). Close to 44% of all plastics are
used for packaging consumer goods, with the remainder plastics being utilized for
manufacturing. Only 173 metric ton of the total plastic waste produced afterthe con￾sumption is collected for recycling and landfill use, remaining are either burnt or
disposed of in the environment. The disposed materials, due to lack of management
and segregation, leaks into the ecosystems. Among the leached waste from the dis￾posed plastic roughly 3% is carried to the oceans (Rai et al. 2021). In the ocean water
the mechanical waves and the prolonged UV radiation break down the macroplas￾tic to microplastic (<5 mm), which are potential hazards to aquatic life (Lebreton
and Andrady 2019). The currents disperse these microplasticsthroughout the ocean,
where they accumulate in aquatic life and travel up the food chain. The consumed
plastic continuesto exist in the digestive tract of the animals, which affectstheirfeed￾ing behavior, hormone production and causes the overexudation of gastric enzymes
which leads to gastrointestinal impediment. The accumulation of plastic also affects

The carbon dioxide emissions caused by the burning of the non-biodegradable
polymers like polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polypropylene possess an
increasing risk of global warming. Although the “reuse,reduce, and recycle” strategy
provides a relief from the burdensome problem, it isinsufficient to limit the excessive
use of plastics in society and the environment as a whole (Borrelle et al. 2020).
17.1.2 Biodegradable Polymers: Significance and Prospects
More focus is being given to the growing need for bio-based materials for imme￾diate applications as a substituent to non-biodegradable synthetic polymers. Their
application spans huge areasincluding tissue engineering, wound healing, and drug
delivery. These bioplastics are mostly formed of polysaccharides, proteins, and fibers
which are either naturally occurring,synthetic orsemisynthetic. These biopolymers
lack some of the material properties which enables their wide application as syn￾thetic plastics. In orderto have a widespread application in different fields, extensive
research and development has been done to improve the properties of biopolymers.
The goal is to bring their mechanical and physical capabilities up to par with those
of non-biodegradable polymers(Abioye et al. 2019). These polymers can quickly dis￾integrate into the simple compounds, when discarded into the environment because
of the enzymatic activity of natural microbial flora (Ruggero et al. 2019). As a result
of the breakdown of natural polymers, humic matter, methane, biomass, water, car￾bon dioxide and a number of other natural substances are released (RameshKumar
et al. 2020).
Depending on the source, biopolymers are divided into three categories: microbial
(polyhydroxyalkanoates, levan), animal (chitin, chitosan, keratin), and plant-based
(starch, cellulose) (Siracusa 2019). Unique properties of these polymers allow them
to replace synthetic plastic in a variety of applications.
17.1.3 Waste Valorization, a Crucial Strategy for Sustainable
Production
Biodegradable polymers are an alternative to the synthetic polymers, but their
production is extremely challenging. A waste valorization strategy should be used
to make it more cost-effective. Primary generators of waste which can be used as
substrate for biopolymer production are the agro-industry. The agro-industry alone
generates one billion metric tons of waste (Tiseo 2023). The waste includes solids,
liquids, and slurries generated from the processing of cereals, vegetables, seafood,
dairy, fruits, poultry, and meat. These can serve as a low-cost source for biopolymer
production because of their non-toxic content and abundance (Bolaji et al. 2021;
Tomaszewska et al. 2018).
Applying waste valorization toward the production of bioplastics can significantly
lower the carbon footprint of agricultural biomass like corn stalks, vegetable
trash, jute, wood chips, stubble, grain husks, and banana peels. The raw waste
can be treated chemically to obtain polymers like cellulose, chitin, and gelatin.
By employing microbes for the fermentation of these raw waste materials, they can17.2 Role of Organic Biodegradable Polymers in Environmental Bioremediation 383
be converted into natural polyesters like polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), polyhy￾droxybutyrate (PHB), and poly lactic acid (PLA) (Rai et al. 2021). The biopolymers
after synthesis/extraction are subjected to life cycle assessments in order to deter￾mine their potential application for replacing non-biodegradable plastics and to
minimize their environmental impact. These polymers have a lot of potential since
their properties can easily be manipulated by adding desirable characteristics by
blending with other polymers or chemical modifications (Rijpkema et al. 2020).
17.2 Role of Organic Biodegradable Polymers
in Environmental Bioremediation
The popularity of biopolymersis attributed to the application of biopolymersin vari￾ous industrial sectors such as the medical sector, food and packaging sector, cosmet￾ics, agriculture, automotives, electronics, and construction fields (Balaji et al. 2018).
Apart from these applications, biopolymers are now being extensively studied and
experimented for its usefulness in bioremediation processes. Conventional meth￾ods for the removal of environmental pollutants like metals from the environment
are often expensive and also create secondary pollutants (Ayangbenro and Babalola
2018). Utilization of biodegradable biopolymers for bioremediation is a pragmatic
way, as it not only cleans up the environment but will reduce the pile up.
The competition of biopolymers in regard to the efficiency and scalability is with
synthetic polymers. In regard to this, the work of Prakash et al. (2016) is important
as they prepared a chitosan/starch-based blend which was found to be very much
effective in removing chromium (Cr) from waste. Blending of chitosan and starch
improved the quality of the film and provided a more adsorbable site for heavy metal
(Prakash et al. 2016). Synthetic dyesthat are commonly present in effluentsreleased
from textile and leather industry pose major environmental risks. To remove dyes
from industrial effluents, cellulose, chitin, and chitosan-based biopolymers have
been found to be effective and are now in use (Dassanayake et al. 2021). Forthe treat￾ment of water polluted with heavy metals, dyes and oils, one of the naturally occur￾ring polymers called keratin has been found to be helpful (Liya and Mridul 2022).
The biopolymers are quite flexible to chemical and physical modifications and
versatile products like films, gels, fibers, sponges, nanoparticles (NPs), and biocom￾posites could be designed from their raw structure (Vinod et al. 2020). Being abun￾dantly found in nature, divergent sources of biopolymers include plants, animals,
and microorganisms. Different types of biopolymers and its role in bioremediation
are being discussed further.
17.2.1 Plant-Based Polymers for Environmental Remediation
17.2.1.1 Cellulose and Cellulose Derivatives
Cellulose is an organic biopolymer which is primarily produced by plants as cell wall
material. It is also produced by some forms of bacteria. The basic building block of384 17 Biodegradable Organic Polymers for Environmental Protection and Remediation
cellulose is D-glucose, which is polymerized by β (1 → 4) linkages. In plants cellulose
fibers act as structural support for the cells, they maintain the rigidity of tissues and
make up most of the hard components of the plants. The purest form of naturally
available cellulose is cotton (90%) (Khan et al. 2022). The cellulose microfibrils in
the plant cell wall provide rigidity to the cell; this physical property is derived from
the crystalline nature of cellulose in aqueous state. Such crystallinity is very rare in
polysaccharides, which make cellulose a unique compound (He et al. 2021).
Different chemical modifications can be done on cellulose to obtain derivatives
of cellulose with a wide variety of properties suitable for multiple applications (He
et al. 2021). Oxycellulose derivatives are the derivatives which have a carboxyl group
in the position of the terminal alcohol group. They can be water soluble. It’s used to
prepare gauzes which can be applied on wounds at the time ofsurgery. Ethers of cel￾lulose are used in drug delivery due to their hydrogel-forming ability when comesin
contact with water. The hydrogel will help to protect the drug from water by form￾ing a barrier (Khan et al. 2022). Cellulose ether can be water soluble based upon the
derived chemical structure, as well as degree and arrangement of the substituted
groups. Common cellulose ethers are methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Methyl cellulose is synthesized when cellulose is
treated with methylating agents (methyl chloride, dimethyl sulfate) under alkaline
conditions (Içten et al. 2017). Ethyl cellulose is formed by converting the hydroxyl
groups in cellulose molecules into ethyl ether groups (Jiang et al. 2022). This deriva￾tive is formed by the reaction between alkali cellulose and ethyl chloride. CMC is a
highly stable derivative of cellulose, which is formed by a substitution reaction. The
hydroxyl group gets substituted with the carboxymethyl group when treated with
monochloroacetic acid (Seddiqi et al. 2021).
Among the esters of cellulose acetate is the common one. Cellulose acetate is
synthesized by ring-opening esterification and transesterification of cellulose. The
reaction can take place under heterogeneous or homogeneous conditions (Khosh￾nevisan et al. 2018). Another derivative, nitrocellulose is a nitric ester of cellulose
which is highly reactive; hence, it’s called gun cotton. It is made by treating cotton
with a mixture ofsulfuric acid and nitric acid. The compound is highly explosive and
has a flash point of 4.4 ∘C (El Nemr et al. 2021).Cellulose nitrate is the first semisyn￾thetic cellulose polymer synthesized during the emergence of the plastic industry. It
is produced by the substitution of hydroxyl groups with nitrate groups (Neves et al.
2019). Cellulose sulfate is another unique derivative of cellulose prepared by sulfa￾tion of cellulose. Sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide, and chlorosulfonic acid are used for
the sulfation (Seddiqi et al. 2021).
Cellulose sheets can be prepared from different waste sources like Pistia (water
weed) (Umesh et al. 2022), corn husk, sugarcane bagasse (Bhardwaj et al. 2022).
These sheets can be degraded easily when exposed in environmental soil for about
four weeks, which is much fasterthan the currently used packaging materials. These
findings are a beacon for cellulose sheets to be used as an alternative for plastic in
the packaging industry. In addition to the biodegradable packaging Table 17.1 lists
additional uses for various cellulose types.Table 17.1 Environmental applications of cellulose.

17.2.1.2 Starch and Starch Derivatives
Starch is one of the substantially applied organic biopolymers for bioremediation
due to its uncomplicated structure, its availability, renewability, non-toxicity, and
low cost. Starch is made up of glucose molecules that are efficiently broken down by
amylases and amylase-producing microorganisms. Hence, starch and its derivatives
are employed in bioremediation (Amaraweera et al. 2021).
One of the sole starch-based derivatives used in bioremediation is biosorbentslike
corn starch and potato starch. They effectively remove heavy metals from polluted
water, air, and soil. In a work by Akinterinwa et al. (2020) corn starch cross-linked
with PoCl3 was used in the removal of Pb,Cd, Hg, andCu from water.It was observed
that 1% starch could remove the heavy metals(Pb, Cd, Hg) effectively and reduce the
amount of Cu from the contaminated water. The starch complex was also reusable
after it had undergone weak acid treatment. Another work by (Gao et al. 2022) high￾lights a liquid mulch based on corn starch-sodium alginate which was made as an
alternative to non-biodegradable liquid mulch. It was degraded within 25 days and
thereafter improved soil fertility by increasing organic matter.
Dextrins and maltodextrins are products obtained from partial and complete
hydrolysis of starch, respectively. These products are indirectly employed in
bioremediation by providing them to bacteria as a substrate medium for growth,
and the bacteria will degrade certain unfavorable chemicals like (polychlorinated
biphenyls) PCBs (Jing et al. 2018).
Another starch derivative is starch-based nanomaterials which include nanopar￾ticles, nanogels, and nanomicelles. Starch nanomaterials are utilized as adsorbents
for removal of pollutants from water. Starch hybrid nanomaterials like starch/SnO2,
starch Fe-Pd, starch xanthane, carboxymethyl starch, etc. have application in
water treatment to remove targeted heavy metals like Hg2+, trichloroethane, (Ni2+,
Cu2+, Cr3+) and (Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+), respectively. Modified cassava starch coated
with nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) was used in aqueous nitrate remediation.
Starch/PVA was employed in textile wastewater treatment for both cationic and
anionic dyes. Starch treatment improved the hydrophilicity of CNTs (carbon
nanotubes) efficiently, and it was observed that multi walled carbon nano tube
(MWCNT)–starch–iron oxide was better absorbent that MWCNT–iron oxide for
removing methylene blue and methyl orange dyes (Gamage et al. 2022). A work
by Salam et al. (2018) suggested that corn starch modified with diethylenetriamine
penta-acetic acid (DTPA) along with chitosan improved interfiber bonding of
recycled fiber paper sheets and showed antibacterial properties up to 97%.
Although the applications of starch and starch derivatives are widely being stud￾ied and utilized, these techniques have their limitations. Ingestion of nanomaterials
by humans can harmfully affect our well-being, as nano-sized materials can inter￾act with cells and intracellular structures inside the human body. Comprehensively,
starch and starch derivatives play a critical part in environmental bioremediation.
Being affordable and readily available have uplifted their usage by enzyme producing
microorganisms as a source of energy, therefore reducing the pollutants. Therefore,
starch and its derivatives are valuable toolsfor environmental bioremediation which
in turn benefits human well-being.17.2 Role of Organic Biodegradable Polymers in Environmental Bioremediation 387
17.2.2 Animal-Based Polymers for Environmental Remediation
17.2.2.1 Chitin and Chitosan
Chitin isthe second most common biopolymer on earth after cellulose, and chitosan
is created by deacetylating chitin, where both these biopolymers exhibit specific
chemical, mechanical, optical, and physical properties as a result of their structural
features, which give them adjustable traitslike high porosity, low density,renewabil￾ity, and biodegradability (Shaumbwa et al. 2021). Chitin and chitosan have similar
characteristics, because of their microstructural similarity. These biopolymers can
be a potential replacement for their natural and synthetic equivalents in environ￾mental remediation due to their simplicity in processing, non-toxicity, and intrinsic
antibacterial nature (Sirajudheen et al. 2021).
Chitin is a fibrous material composed of repeating glucose units (acetyl￾glucosamine) connected by β-(1 → 4) glycosidic bonds, which is the primary
component of fungal cell wall and crustacean exoskeletons. The exoskeleton of
crustaceans is abundant in components like protein (20–40%), calcium carbonate
(20–50%), and chitin (15–40%) which are advantageous for industrial purposes (Yan
and Chen 2015). The exceptional properties of chitosan offer extensive applications
in many fields including biotechnology, food industry, chemical industries, textiles,
membranes, wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical, and biomedicine (El Knidri
et al. 2018). Chitin and chitosan can be extracted by chemical and biological
processes, where both methods involve three major steps: demineralization, depro￾teinization, and deacetylation (Mohan et al. 2020). Compared to chitin, chitosan
has higher industrial significance and applications due to the presence of various
functional groups with high reactivity and the polymer chain has higher flexibility.
The free amino groups found in each D-glucosamine unit give chitosan its key
characteristics and the hydroxyl groups present on the polysaccharide chain opens
the possibility of structural modification of chitosan (Joseph et al. 2021). Chitosan
in its pure form has limited applications compared to modified chitosan, where
chitosan is modified through physical and chemical processes in order to enhance
its original qualities and expand the range of applications, with a focus on their
use in environmental remediation. Chitosan can be modified to prepare numerous
adsorbent materials like films, hydrogels, membranes, aerogels, and composites
which have various environmental applications such as removal of environmental
pollutants like herbicides, industrial dyes, heavy metals, insecticide, and fungicides
(Pal et al. 2021). Different methods of modification of chitin and chitosan-based
adsorbents are given in Table 17.2.
Chitin and chitosan are used as environmental remediation agents in both water
and soil treatment. Water pollution is brought on by toxic compounds that are eas￾ily dissolved in water when they come into touch with it from farms, cities, and
factories. The majority of the industry uses dyes for commercial purposes, and the
unprocessed industrial effluents contain large quantities of various organic dyes.
People who live close to industry are in severe danger since they are frequently
exposed to the contaminants, which is why the elimination of such pollutants from
wastewaters is absolutely essential. Dyes are one of the common pollutants found inTable 17.2 Pros and cons of chitin and chitosan modification.

water bodies asthey are widely used in varioussectorsincluding textile, pharmaceu￾tical, food, agriculture, leather tanning, and paper production. In addition to being
exceptionally mutagenic and carcinogenic, these dyes have been discovered to be
deadly wastes (Sirajudheen et al. 2020). Methyl orange (MO), methylene blue (MB),
reactive yellow 145, malachite green (MG), methyl violet (MV), organic dye sunset
yellow (SY), alizarin yellow, and congo red are some common dyes that can have
negative impacts on both the environment and people. Chitin and chitosan’slimited
adsorption capacity in powder or flake form is due to their crystalline structure and
modified chitin and chitosan have shown higher adsorption potential. The interac￾tions between some divalent heavy metals and chitosan/graphene oxide (Cs/GO)
improve the stability of chitosan and its adsorption potential toward heavy metals
like Ni, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb (Menazea et al. 2020). Bioaugmentation, biostimulation,
and degradation of xenobiotic compounds are some methodsinvolved in the remedi￾ation ofsoil. The immobilization property of chitosan makesit an efficient applicant
for bioaugmentation, and this procedure of remediation is quick and effective, and
it can be applied in both in vitro and ex vitro.
17.2.2.2 Keratin and Keratin Derivatives
Keratin is a protein which is found in nature as components of feathers, hair, wool,
claws, nails, horns, hooves, and beaks (Sharma et al. 2019). Keratin is also one of the
most exploited biopolymers for different bioremediation applications. The building
blocks of keratin include various amino acids which have functional and charged
groups in its chemical structure. These functional groups and charged groups are
the major sites where adsorption and sequestration of environmental contaminants
take place (Saha et al. 2019). The tough structure of keratin protein and itsresistance
toward many organic solvents and peptidase enzymes contributed by the recurring
presence of cysteine amino acid and disulfide bonds makes them a good option as a
stable biopolymer. Apart from the structure, the resistance of keratinous materials
against microbial attack and its slow response to natural degradation renders them
to be used for a long time and over several recycling cycles also (Lange et al. 2016).
Many well-studied works on the application of keratin for bioremediation have
been reported in the past like the work of Abba et al. (2020) for removal of heavy
metals from aqueous solution. Two commonly occurring types of chicken feathers,
melanized and non-melanized chicken feathers, were experimented for the removal
of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) from aqueous solutions. The feathers were able to
remove 40% of cadmium (Cd) and 30% of lead (Pb) concentration from the solu￾tion within a time period of seven days (Abba et al. 2020). Similarly, the ability of
guinea fowl feathersto remove copper(Cu) and zinc (Zn) heavy metal from aqueous
solution was studied by Yusuf and Sharu (2022). They used raw feathers as well as
autoclave-pretreated and acetone-pretreated feathers for the removal of heavy met￾als. All three forms of feathers were able to remove heavy metal from aqueous solu￾tion with subsequent degradation of feather-by-feather degrading Pseudochrobac￾trum sp. IY-BUKI (Yusuf and Sharu 2022). Hydrocarbons and oils discharged from
industries, mining practices, and spilled from oil tankers have been polluting both
land and water for a long time. Although activated carbon has been in use for the17.2 Role of Organic Biodegradable Polymers in Environmental Bioremediation 391
removal of oils for the past years, Okoya et al. (2020) were successful in proving
the efficiency of chicken feather waste as an adsorbent for the removal of oil from
aqueous solution with 99.95% of adsorption ability which was 4% higher than com￾mercially used activated carbon (Okoya et al. 2020). Not only chicken feathers but
also dog fur and human hair were experimented over peat moss and polypropy￾lene for adsorption of crude oil and was found to be as efficient as peat moss and
polypropylene for the removal of oil even after recycling also (Murray et al. 2020).
The applicability of keratin can be improved by modifying its functional groups
and side chains and such modified forms of keratin are called keratin derivatives.
Major modification methods for the preparation of keratin derivatives include oxi￾dation,reduction, coupling, using ionic solutions,succinylation, quaternization,sul￾fitolysis, and enzymatic modifications (Maier et al. 2019). The process of keratin
structural modification by oxidation and reduction is depicted in Figure 17.1. Such
modified keratin can be used for the preparation of hydrogels, scaffolds, films, and
fibers (Jaiswar et al. 2022).
Adsorption of oil and naphthalic acid that come up the surface during bitumen
extraction wasremoved by a modified keratin biopolymer as mentioned in one of the
works of Arshad et al. (2016). The modification of keratin was based on opening the
structure of keratin using polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) nanocages
and goethite dopant(Arshad et al. 2016). Similarly, to clean up spilled oil and organic
solvents, keratin/cellulose based cryogel was prepared by adding ionic solvents. This
cryogel efficiently adsorbed oil with the cryogel attaining a weight of 6.9–17.7 times
more than its initial weight. Through adsorption distillation or adsorption desorp￾tion method, the gel could be recycled and used again (Guiza et al. 2021). Separation
of oil and water from oil contaminated water can be brought about by preferentially
absorbing water from oil. In view of this, a study was conducted by Gao et al. (2020)
to increase the wettability of chicken feathers. Through modification of keratin in
chicken feathers by reduction and coupling, they were able to make a keratin deriva￾tive which was hydrophilic and oleophobic in nature. These modified feathers could
act as a surface which can effectively repel oil and thus can be used for oil water sep￾aration (Gao et al. 2020). A well-known method of modification of keratins includes
hydrolysis wherein the bonds of keratin will be broken forming a hydrolyzed ker￾atin as product. Utilizing this method, a study was conducted by Tissera et al. (2020)

where controlled surface hydrolysis of Merino wool fibers resulted in the removal
of cuticle from wool fiber exposing cortical fibers which have exceptionally high
amounts of amino acids. Such modified fibers were able to adsorb carcinogenic Rho￾damine B dye up to 294 mg g−1 of the fiber in presence of 3.5% acetic acid (Tissera
et al. 2020). Likewise forthe absorption of anionic and cationic dyes, keratin sponges
were prepared by freeze drying and chemical cross-linking. The sponges provided
a good absorbing surface for Azure A and methyl orange dye, two of those dyes
which are toxic and are most frequently found in waste waters (Posati et al. 2020).
Wastewater from tannery is one of the most polluted discharges from industries as
it contains a lot of toxic dyes, heavy metals, and harmful microbes (Liya et al. 2023).
It is very important to treat this water before discharging it for disposal. In regard
to this problem, Roy et al. (2022) worked out to prepare a nanocomposite based on
graphene oxide, chitosan, and keratin biopolymer (GO-CS-K) which could reduce
the turbidity and thereby toxin loads of tannery wastewater. Tannery effluent treated
with this nanocomposite was also found to reduce the biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) totalsuspended solids(TSS), and salinity in
wastewater and made the effluent safe to be released to the environment (Roy et al.
2022). Environment pollutant load is increasing day by day. Organic biodegradable
biopolymers and their derivatives can be a promising solution for bioremediation.
17.2.3 Microbe-Based Polymers for Environmental Remediation
17.2.3.1 Polyhydroxyalkanoates
Microorganisms produce microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates asintracellular granules
understress conditions. These biopolyesters are harmless and biodegradable. Micro￾bial polyhydroxyalkanoates are mostly produced by prokaryotic organisms as gran￾ulesinside the cytoplasm. The size of these water-insoluble granulesrangesfrom 0.2
to 0.5 μm (Sedlacek et al. 2019). Most of the microorganisms produce these granular
inclusions as a source of energy when the nutrients are scarce and carbon sources
are abundant (Sagong et al. 2018), and studies have shown that these granules actu￾ally protect the bacterial cell from osmotic stress and other worse conditions(Obruca
et al. 2018).
PHAs are important mainly because of their polymeric properties which make
them environmentally friendly and can be considered as a replacement for the
synthetic plastics (Amelia et al. 2019). These eco-friendly polymers can be used as
biomaterials with zero impact on the environment, in agriculture fields, packaging
materials, medical implants, drug-delivery carriers, 3D printing materials, etc.
When it comes to the industrial sector a major application of PHAs is in using it as a
packaging material. Pollution occurring in the oceans as a result of usage of plastics
can be compensated by the use of bioplastics made using polyhydroxyalkanoates;
these include the use of biodegradable plastic utensils like spoons, cups, and
plates made by using PHAs (Mangaraj et al. 2019). A PHA copolymer named as
“Metabolix” which is actually a blend of PHB and P(3HO) can be used in the
production of food additives and packaging materials and has properties similar to
petrochemical-derived plastics (Mangaraj et al. 2019).17.2 Role of Organic Biodegradable Polymers in Environmental Bioremediation 393
Another field which uses PHA biopolyesters is in the production of biofuels. Here
the used bioplastic products are methyl esterified to produce biofuels. During this
esterification process the short-chain and medium-chain length PHAs can be ester￾ified with methanol in order to produce hydroxyalkanoate methyl esters. This bio￾fuel production using PHA is feasible as the PHA can be produced from activated
sludge and nutrient-rich wastewater (Muneer et al. 2020). PHAs can be used for the
another environmental remediation purposes such as in the removal of heavy met￾als. Hungund et al. (2018) used PHA composites comprising PHB-starch and PHB
polyethylene glycol (PEG) for removing heavy metalsfrom aqueoussolutions, and it
was observed that these compositesshowed better adsorption of Pb2+ ions(Hungund
et al. 2018).
PHA-based nanoparticles and fibers are used in medical applications as well. Stud￾ies have shown that 3HB monomers from PHA can actually fight against Parkin￾son’s and Alzheimer disease which can be done by blocking the neural cell death
(Camberos-Luna et al. 2016). Another application in the medical field isits use as an
anti-osteoporosis agent; here the grooved P(3HB-co-3HHx) film induced osteogenic
initiation in bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. This finding supports
the use of PHAsin the treatment of osteoporosis(Ali and Jamil 2016).Certain studies
have also shown the ability of PHA as an anti-cancerous agent by actually combining
the 3HAs with D peptide (Sangsanoh et al. 2017).
In the agricultural sector PHAs can be used to make agricultural grow bags, neta
and mulch films (Amelia et al. 2019). Mulching crops with PHA-made biofilms
or bioplastics not only increase yield but also protect them. Agriculture mulching
is made with copolymers like P(3HB-co-3HHx) (Kalia et al. 2019). NodaxTM and
MirelTM are two examples of PHA-based agriculture mulch used for commercial
purposes. When buried or burned, synthetic mulch pollutes the environment and
has led to an increase in the number of landfills. As PHAs-based mulch films are
being developed on a research scale and are anticipated to aid in the reduction of
synthetic mulch films, bioplastics have addressed the issue (Amelia et al. 2019). In
nanotechnology, PHA nanomaterialsin the form of microspheres have been studied
to increase herbicide activity by acting as nanocarriers of the herbicides with lower
genotoxicity and higher biodegradability rates (Kalia et al. 2019).
PHAs, as bioplastic materials, can help conserve ecosystems by removing syn￾thetic plastics from the environment. These amazing granular inclusions, which
function as microbial polyesters, can assist usin combating environmental pollution
by addressing current plastic debris and waste mismanagement scenarios.
17.2.3.2 Levan
Levan is a homopolysaccharide generated by a variety of microorganisms as
exopolysaccharides (EPS) and a minor amount of plant species as non-structural
storage carbohydrates. Levan is a β-(2,6)-linked fructose polymer, and this fructose
backbone makes levan a fascinating carbohydrate polymer. Bacterial levan con￾tributes to the formation of the exopolysaccharides matrix and helps in microbial
biofilm formation which prevents the microorganisms from drying out as the
water level fluctuates, aids in influencing the environment of their proximity,394 17 Biodegradable Organic Polymers for Environmental Protection and Remediation
and protects them from other organisms. Levan has key biomedical qualities
including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and hyperglycemic
inhibitor in addition to general qualities like biocompatibility, biodegradabil￾ity, renewability, flexibility, and ecofriendliness. In recent years, scientists have
explored the potential of biopolymers as an applicant in environmental remedia￾tion due to its natural occurrence, non-toxicity, environmental friendliness, and
biocompatibility. Biopolymer-based sorbents have several advantages over other
materials in environmental remediation, and levan is an excellent candidate for
molecular interactions with organic micropollutants due to the furanose rings in its
structure (Hacıosmanoglu˘ et al. 2019). Due to its β-(2,6) linkage, the water-soluble
carbohydrate polymer levan is soluble in both water and oil. However, it does not
immediately settle out in a water suspension and has variable solubility in cold
water but is entirely soluble in hot water. Levan is mostly produced by bacteria
utilizing submerged fermentation processes and for higher yields, environmental
factors including pH, temperature, aeration, and agitation must be developed and
optimized for each organism (de Siqueira et al. 2020) (Figure 17.2).
Levan is different from other exopolysaccharides due to its high-water retention
capacity and it is heat stable, with a glass transition temperature of 141 ∘C and a
decomposition point of about 225 ∘C. Levan is extensively employed as an encapsu￾lating and emulsifying agent, but the modification of levan enhances the naturally
present properties of levan. These modifications involve blending of levan with
other biopolymers such as chitin and chitosan to improve its mechanical properties
(Wang et al. 2022). A study reported by (Loncarevi ˇ c´ et al. 2019) highlights the use
of levan and pullulan as potential bio-detoxification agents for reducing adverse
effects of copper on Daphnia magna and Vibrio fischeri. Phosphonated Halomonas

produced worldwide, showed maximum adsorption capacity of 126.6 mg g−1
(Hacıosmanoglu˘ et al. 2019). Levan have been widely utilized in nanostructured
systems as excipients numerous techniques have been used to create levan-based
nanoparticles (NPs), including flame pyrolysis, co-precipitation, direct enzymatic
synthesis, thermal and chemical reduction, self-assembly, and nanoprecipitation.
Levan synthesized by Azotobacter vinelandii D-08 showed higher capacity for
the binding of Na, Mg, S, Ca, and Fe in the cultivation medium underlines the
usage of levan as sorbents for wastewater treatment to remove heavy metals and
radionuclides (Shutova et al. 2021).
17.3 Conclusion
Despite the versatile material properties and high degree of biocompatibility of
biopolymers, they still fail to compete with their synthetic counterparts majorly due
to the cost associated with their production and recovery. Lack of understanding
among the public and policy makers is the major reason that hinders the com￾mercialization of biopolymers in the market. Although extensive research was
conducted in lab and pilot scale, the industrial level scale up of these polymers
is yet a long journey. Development of cost-effective methods for production and
purification of these biopolymers and integration of waste valorization methods
with biopolymer production can clearly revolutionize this field of eco-friendly
product development.

18.1 Introduction
Agriculture is one of the significant factors in good health, competent nutrition,
environmental pollution, and economic development (Fasusi et al. 2021). Enhanc￾ing productivity per unit of the land utilized for crop production was once the main
driving force for agricultural development around the world. Over time, cultivating,
gathering, and processing food in agriculture have been notably accomplished
by overusing agrochemicals and exploiting natural resources like water and soil
(Tilman et al. 2002; Chopin et al. 2021). The unsustainability of these methods
has been brought to light by factors such as the strong demand for freshwater,
rising agrochemical manufacturing costs, and increased awareness of their negative
environmental effects (Lykogianni et al. 2021). Recently, the globe has started
working toward more sustainable farming methods for a brighter tomorrow in
response to the mounting environmental repercussions (Altabbaa et al. 2022).
Some of the contemporary challenges faced by global agriculture are controlled
supply of agrochemicals, dealing with soil erosion, water pollution, and climate
change. To prevent crop loss, synthetic agrochemicals are frequently utilized
(Tikoria et al. 2022). Both humans and the environment have suffered greatly
as a result of their poisonous leftovers attributed to their uncontrolled release
(Himani et al. 2022). Further, the widespread distribution of heavy metals in the
environment as a result of numerous residential, agricultural, medicinal, industrial,
and technical uses has also raised worries about their possible consequences on
human health, the environment, and agriculture (Ahmed et al. 2022). Furthermore,
global climate change has hastened the flux of various abiotic challenges such as
flooding, drought, extreme temperatures, and salt and biotic stresses including
ever-evolving phytopathogens and diseases that reduce agricultural production
(Zandalinas et al. 2021). Generally, plants have a built-in defense mechanism
that can only withstand certain levels of stress. The increasing environmental

stressors have detrimental effects on plant growth, development, and crop output.
These unfavorable circumstances alter the metabolism of reactive species (Chaki
et al. 2020). High levels of these reactive species, which are more numerous than
antioxidant defense enzymes can handle, disrupt redox equilibrium, which may
cause macromolecules like lipids and proteins of membrane and nucleic acids to be
damaged (Janku˚ et al. 2019). The disruption of the natural defense system under
extreme stress results in damage and abnormal physiological conditionsin the plant
cell, ultimately leading to plant cell death and yield reductions (Raza et al. 2022).
Researchers are attempting to address all of these challenges by utilizing a vari￾ety of environmentally sound solutions, such as the utilization of biological units,
drainage, and water and soil management. Application of polymers can be consid￾ered as one such approach. Polymers play a significantrole in daily life; they are used
to create a variety of high-tech items, including biomaterials(prosthetic hip and knee
joints) and aerospace materials (Guo et al. 2020). Polymers’ enormous popularity
can be attributed to their simplicity in processing. By adjusting the “atomic make￾up” of repetitive component and changing the molecular weight, the properties of
polymers can be adjusted to match particular needs (Puoci et al. 2008). Recent stud￾ies have begun investigating customized and stimulus-responsive smart polymeric
systems for diverse agricultural applications (Stuart et al. 2010). Among different
types of polymers organic polymers are extensively studied as they can be utilized
as soil conditioners, carriers for controlled agrochemical release, and for mitigating

various biotic and abiotic stresses in plants (Figure 18.1). Further, a family of func￾tional polymer materials known as organic super-absorbent polymers (SAPs) has a
superior-water absorption function. It has great water retention capabilities and can
absorb water that is hundredsto thousands of times heftier than it. Even under pres￾sure, it is impossible to separate the water if the water absorption has expanded into
a hydrogel (Ai et al. 2021). Several studies have exploited this property of SAPs for
enhancing the soil water-holding capacity and mitigating drought stress in plants,
thereby increasing agricultural production. In the present chapter, we have concen￾trated on various applications of organic polymers in agriculture.
18.2 Organic Polymers as Soil Conditioners/Stabilizers
The heavy use of fertilizersfrom scarce resourcesin modern agriculture hasresulted
in significant soil degradation due to the loss of soil organic matter and fertility
that raises emission of carbon dioxide (Kopittke et al. 2019). In addition, better crop
development and productivity require soils treatment very frequently with soil con￾ditioners (such as coal fly ash pellets containing extra Ca, Mg, K, S, P, Si, Al, Fe, and
Cu) and soil improvers(such as waste from agriculture). The utilization of fertilizers
and chemicals, however, has received a lot of attention recently, while soil condi￾tioners and soil amendments have received less (Nkebiwe et al. 2016). When these
soil conditioners are used to improve the soil, more precise dosing, a longer-lasting
release of nutrients were observed that are advantageousforsoil health (Sarlaki et al.
2021).
As soil conditioners, natural and chemically synthesized polymers have been
used since the 1950s. To date a variety of organic polymers are available in the
market which is used for soil stabilization. Organic polymers are essentially sub￾stances having necessary nutrients to enhance physical, chemical, and biological
characteristics of soil (Karamina and Fikrinda 2020). Among organic polymers,
alginate, cellulose, chitin, chitosan, collagen, and dextran are natural organic
polymers, whereas polymers like acrylic and methacrylic acid, polyethylene glycol,
polyvinyl alcohol, and vinyl acetate are classified as synthetic organic polymers
(Behera and Mahanwar 2019). Besides these compounds, organic polymers such
as pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose are also used for soil improvement (Roy
et al. 2014). Regarding their effectiveness as soil conditioners, various studies have
been done on the synthetic organic polymers polyacrylamide and polysaccharide.
Identical acrylamide and similar monomers are polymerized to generate the
homopolymer complex known as polyacrylamide (Yu et al. 2003). The anionic form
of polyacrylamide is most frequently employed in soil conditioning. Polysaccharide
is derived from guar, which is categorized as a galactomannan made up of galactose
and mannose and galactose subunits. Cationic density polysaccharide having
low–medium charge is most frequently applied to soil preparation (Graber et al.
2006). Recently, organic polymer substances have been investigated as potential
novel chemical soil stabilizers. Examples include polyacrylamide, polyurethane,
resins, and xanthan gum. Such polymeric substances encompass huge number406 18 Application of Organic Polymers in Agriculture

of macromolecular/chains and hydrophilic groups (Mohsin and Attia 2015). An
elastic film structure is created when soil and an organic polymer stabilizer are
combined, improving the soil’s strength and stability properties. The main benefits
of polymer reinforcements are strong soil–particle bonds and superior structural
stability (Rezaeimalek et al. 2017).
The physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil can both be significantly
influenced by these soil conditioners(Figure 18.2).In addition, itraisesthe availabil￾ity of nitrate while reducing bulk density and extractile salt content of the soil (Babla
et al. 2022). By preventing soil deterioration, enhancement ofsoil–air–waterinterac￾tions and modification ofsoil aggregation and soil drainage to lessen soil compaction
and combat water repellence, these organic polymers aided in the improvement of
soil and production of food (Shinde et al. 2019). This ultimately results in better
growth and development of plants and increased nutrient availability in the soil
(Karamina and Fikrinda 2020). Along with increasing the availability of nutrients
for crops, soil conditioners also promote weed competition and insect and disease
defense. The main elements affecting polymers functions include charge density,
composition, concentration, conformation, molecule size, molecular weight, and pH
(Huang et al. 2021).
Compared to other organic polymers or fiber reinforcement alone, integrating
augmentation of fiber and organic polymer may be thought of as a novel efficacious
approach to enhance soil, providing it with higher solidity and refined structural
stability (Liu et al. 2018). Furthermore, when a polymer is applied along with an
electrolyte source, such as phosphogypsum, its benefits of preserving increased
infiltration rate and decreased runoff and erosion are significantly enhanced.
Furthermore, the presence of electrolytes enhances the flocculation of the soil clay,
which is necessary for the successful cementing and stability of aggregates at the18.3 Organic Polymers and Agrochemicals Delivery 407
soil surface by anionic polymers (Graber et al. 2006). One important method for
polymer stabilization is electrostatic interaction, particularly between clays and
cationic polymers since the clay surfaces often have negative charge. The clay
minerals’ surfaces and edges readily accept the polycations, which alter water
sorption close to the surface of clay and produce big and firm flocculated particles
(Huang et al. 2021). Most of the soils stabilized with polymers show an increase in
strength right away, even though the primary organic polymers under investigation
have different fundamental features.
18.3 Organic Polymers and Agrochemicals Delivery
Providing plants with the nutrients including micronutrients like cobalt, nickel,
molybdenum, boron, chlorine, copper, zinc, iron, and manganese as well as
macronutrients like calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and
sulfur they require, is a crucial aspect of agriculture (Reetz 2016). However, these
nutrients are habitually not present in environment in quantities that are enough
for healthy plant development. As a result, the use of agrochemicals including fer￾tilizers, herbicides, and insecticides is crucial in agricultural sector. On the contrary,
as our understanding of the agrochemical lifecycle has escalated, so too has our
concern over some unfavorable effects on environment like bioaccumulation in the
food chain and potential ecosystem pollution (Puoci et al. 2008).
To relinquish agrochemicals in soil to immediately meet the nutritional demands
of plants without incurring pollution, production and the usage of agrochemicals
mixed with polymeric materials has been a solution to this issue (Puoci et al.
2008). The amalgamation of polymer and agrochemical can be carried out by the
combination of two processes, viz., physical and chemical processes. For instance,
physical processes result in control over the rate of release of agrochemicals in
contrast with a chemical mechanism that is required for chemical stabilization of
agrochemicals within the polymer matrix. The optimum system to release the active
ingredient is chosen based on the drug’s biological and chemical characteristics as
well as on its physiochemical interactions (Puoci et al. 2008). Additionally, there are
two categories for the release profile of agrochemicals: controlled- and slow-release
systems. In contrast to controlled release, which involves the pervasion-controlled
transfer of active components to a targeted surface from a reservoir to sustain
predefined concentration for given amount of time, slow-release fertilizer pertains
to the mechanism itself which remits the release (Trenkel 2010; Pereira et al. 2015).
Since the parameters that affect the release rate and pattern of controlled-release
fertilizer are known, they can be managed (Trenkel 1997, 2010; Shaviv 2001).
Moreover, controlled nutrient delivery is not an entirely new idea. Oertli and Lunt
(1962) published a study on the membrane-encapsulated controlled release of
fertilizer minerals, while Allan and coworkers documented the controlled release
of pesticides in 1971. Their pioneering research has imposed a significant impact on
the industry, and the technology’s advancement has still been increasing steadily.408 18 Application of Organic Polymers in Agriculture
A commonly used material for controlled release is acrylamide (acrylic-based
organic polymer) (Allan et al. 1971). Furthermore, nanotechnology concepts
have recently been used in studies to enhance the release mechanism by using
nanoparticles. In terms of chemistry, this technology is being developed using
organic polymers and inorganic polymers, and composites (Pérez de Luque and
Hermosín 2013).
Naturalrubber, polyethylene, and cyclopentadiene having glyceryl esters of unsat￾urated fatty acid and materials derived from cellulose are examples of other poly￾mers (Puoci et al. 2008). The most widely utilized agrochemicals, i.e. herbicides,
are typically used as pennant groups in polymers. Various categories of agrochem￾icals are pesticides like atrazine, bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos and tebuconazole, various
herbicides including pentachlorophenol, 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid and
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and fertilizers having nitrogen, phosphorus, potas￾sium, urea, potassium nitrate, calcium carbonate and various fertilizer with micro￾and macro-nutrients (Roy et al. 2014; Kashyap et al. 2015). Moreover, numerous
biodegradable polymersthat are used forthe fabrication of agrochemicalsforrelease
into the agriculture sector have been mentioned in Table 18.1.

18.4 Organic Polymer and Heavy Metal Toxicity
Hazardous metals like As, Cd, Cr, Co, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn, valuable metals like Ag,
Au, Pd, Pt, and Ru, and radioactivity metals such as Am, Th, Ra, and U can all be
categorized as metal ions(Wang andChen 2009). They help in supplying micronutri￾ents and macronutrientsto the soil, but intensive agriculture hasresulted in massive
contaminants in the form of metal ions (Singh et al. 2020). Such deposition has led
to environmental degradation and ecological damage to agriculture (Alengebawy
et al. 2021). Since time immemorial, this heavy metal toxification is a major con￾cern. Likewise other bioremediations, organic polymers are utilized (Table 18.2) to
improve soil quality and remove harmful heavy metal ions from the soil and water,
enhancing overall plant growth (Malik et al. 2019).
Among organic polymers, polymeric biosorption is one way of cleaning up dam￾aged regions; among which biosorption is a natural ability of biomass that has been
incorporated into biomimicry kind of procedures for binding heavy metals even
from the much-diluted sample (Shen et al. 2015; Milani et al. 2017). As a strategy
for the elimination of heavy metals, biosorption method of environmental remedi￾ation has been explored for use in soil and water systems for agricultural practices.
Using ionic exchange, this technology may eliminate both organic and inorganic
contaminants (Rangabhashiyam et al. 2014). Findings demonstrate this technique’s
minimal prices and great sorption capability. Extracellular polymeric compounds of
sewage sludge are recovered and converted into bio-based products. A study inves￾tigated the use of extracellular polymeric substances of granular waste sludge from
anammox were used as a biosorbent to remove heavy metals, notably Pb, Cu, Ni, and
Zn (Pagliaccia et al. 2022). Similarly, interpenetrating polymer network hydrogels
based on biopolymeric substances including starch, chitosan, alginate, and other
polysaccharides such as exopolysaccharides were also studied (Dragan 2014). For
sorption of metal ion from an aqueous medium, Chauhan and Mahajan (2002) and
Dragan (2014) demonstrated usage of an interpenetrating polymer network utilizing
a mixture of biopolymers and poly(methacrylamide). They discovered that adding
cellulose compounds to the polymer network significantly enhanced the material’s
sorption capacity (Chauhan and Mahajan 2002).
To clean up water and soilsthat have been contaminated by hazardoussubstances
from agricultural inputs in plants, polymers have also frequently been utilized as
sorbent materials where the functional groups and the chemical affinity in the
sorbent materials are considered for understanding the mechanisms involved in
this process (Hua et al. 2021; Demirbas 2008). Due to the presence of electroactive
amine, amide, and carboxylic acid as functional groups for ionic bonding, polysac￾charides including cellulose, chitin, chitosan, and exobiopolymers derived from
organic sources are the type of polymers that are well-high frequently used for the
aim of metal sorption in the plants (Milani et al. 2017; Udayakumar et al. 2021;
Díez-Pascual 2022). These form complexes with heavy metals and thus help in
alleviating phytotoxicity (Hidangmayum et al. 2019). Green coconut fiber, bamboo
fiber, and natural fibers obtained from sugarcane bagasse have each been used as
adsorbent materials. The fundamental benefit from these materials is that they areTable 18.2 Organic polymer in mitigation of heavy metal toxicity.

frequently leftovers from commercial or agricultural operations, are unrefined and
inexpensive, and are simple to extract. They are mostly made of cellulose and hemi￾cellulose, both of which include acidic groups that allow metal ions to bind to them
(Khoo et al. 2018; Sarker et al. 2017). Research on such type of organic polymers
(such as polysaccharides) as adsorbents is still underway with an emphasis of soil
decontamination from metals by bioremediation and rhizoremediation (Bhatnagar
and Kumari 2013). Polymers suitable for decontaminating impacted areas with
high efficiencies are being developed (Kavamura and Esposito 2010). According to
the findings of Pal and Paul, exopolymer films were used for water treatments in
soil. The metals that were absorbed most effectively by such biofilm-like microbes
through electrostatic interactions were Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, and CrO (Pal and Paul
2008). Furthermore, organic polymers can lessen the burden of heavy metals
in plants growing under stressed conditions. For instance, administration of
exopolysaccharide increased nutrient availability and plant growth parameters
of Linum usitatissimum exposed to heavy metals (Zainab et al. 2020). Similarly,
application of chitosan resulted decrease in the content of malondialdehyde (MDA)
and modulated the enzymatic activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase in Cal￾endula tripterocarpa under Ni stress (Heidari et al. 2020). Another study reported
that Cd-stressed radish plants exhibited enhanced growth and yield after treatment
with humic acid. Another study depicted that humic-acid-treated radish plants also
showed modulation of various physiological activities under Cd stress (Farouk et al.
2011). Similar findings were observed by Mukherjee et al. (2019), who reported that
application of exopolysaccharide enhanced the growth of rice exposed to As stress.
18.5 Organic Polymers and Other Plant Stress
In addition to heavy metal toxicity, organic polymers have the potential to help the
plantsto overcome other abiotic stressorsincluding salinity, temperature, and flood￾ing and biotic stressors such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes stress (Table 18.3).
18.5.1 Salinity Stress
Salinity is one of the significant abiotic stressesturning most of the agricultural lands
into unfruitful wastelands, causing a dearth of food. It influences plant’s ability to
absorb water, which causes an overall decline in growth and development (Bartwal
and Arora 2020). Roots are the first part of the plants to encounter salt stress, which
disrupts the cells’ ionic balance and produces an excessive amount of reactive oxy￾gen species which damages genetic material and significantly oxidizes important
biomolecules like carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins of membrane. This results in
the alteration of redox balance in plant cells and prevents growth of plants at various
stages of stress-prompted deterioration (Hussain et al. 2022). Several reports have
demonstrated that exogenously applied organic polymers like chitosan, xanthan,
and alginate can alleviate the salinity-prompted detrimental effects on plant
growth and metabolism (Hidangmayum et al. 2019; Campobenedetto et al. 2021;Table 18.3 Role of organic polymers in mitigation of abiotic and biotic stresses.

Salachna et al. 2018). Chitosan, a second-generation natural biopolymer, is a linear
polysaccharide that is derived from chitin, which is found in crustaceans shells,
insect exoskeleton, and cell wall of fungus (Younes and Rinaudo 2015) and is
significantly applied for providing resistance against salt stress. For instance, the
exogenously applied chitosan enhanced the salinity resistance in tomato, and
increased growth and yield by refining the quality of photosynthetic pigments and
different morphological characters under salinity stress (Ullah et al. 2020). Another
study conducted by Gu (2012) also investigated the role of chitosan to furnish stress
resistance under salinity stress in tomato seedlings. Gu reported that exogenous
application of chitosan reduced the content of H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) and MDA
and delayed decline of chlorophyll contents. Similarly, exogenously applied chitosan
enhanced the germination rate, root length and weight, shoot length and weight
and protein content but decreased proline, MDA, and H2O2 in sunflowers under
salt stress (Jabeen and Ahmad 2013). Another study demonstrated that exogenously
applied chitosan altered the antioxidative as well as non-antioxidative enzyme
activity and decreased oxidative stress in tomato receiving salinity stress (Attia et al.
2021b). In another experiment, it was observed that treatment of oligo-alginate
mitigates the negative impacts induced by salt stress in Eucomis autumnalis by
increasing plant height, chlorophyll content, activities of antioxidative enzymes,
proline content and stimulating the production of phenolic compound (Salachna
et al. 2018). Application of bio-stimulant-based tannin enhances salt tolerance and
plant growth by upregulating the stress response genes expression and essential
transcription factors (Campobenedetto et al. 2021). Similarly, the application of
humic acid and phosphorus mitigated the salt stress and increased plant growth
parameters including root length, shoot length, shoot weight, and root weight
of pepper plant (Çimrin et al. 2010). Furthermore, organic polymer compounds
regulated biochemical and physiological indicators and maintained the K+ and Na+
homeostasis in the cotton root and leaf by modifying the transport of Na+ and K+
in cotton plants under alkaline and salinity stress (Wang et al. 2021).
18.5.2 Temperature Stress
In the current situation, change in climatic conditions and rise in greenhouse effect
led to variationsin temperature, which is emerging as one of the detrimentalstresses
in the context of continually changing environmental factors (Karwa et al. 2020).
Increase in the temperature by 10–15 ∘C over ambient is considered as heat. From
germination to harvest, heat stress has adverse effects on growth and development
of crops. Sedentary by nature, plants are vulnerable to a wide range of tempera￾tures 60–75 ∘F is the ideal range for plant growth. Extreme temperatures (high as
well as low) can be hazardous to the ecosystem and cause abiotic stress to plants,
which lowers crop productivity. Heat stress has worst impact on plant growth and
metabolism out of all abiotic stimuli including drought, salinity, exposure to heavy
metals, and low temperature (Shaffique et al. 2022). These negative effects of temper￾ature stress can be reduced by the administration of organic polymers. For instance,
seed priming with chitosan increased length and weight and decreased oxidative414 18 Application of Organic Polymers in Agriculture
stress by improving antioxidative system in maize plants under temperature stress
(Guan et al. 2009). Additionally, use of humic acid decreased MDA and H2O2 con￾tent by improving antioxidative system and increasing the endogenous phytohor￾mones content in tomato plants exposed to heat stress (Khan et al. 2020). Similarly,
treatment with chitosan oligosaccharide can mitigate cold stress by enhancing the
activity of enzymatic antioxidants including polyphenol peroxidase and superoxide
dismutase along with levels of chlorophyll in tea plants under cold stress (Li et al.
2020).
18.5.3 Flooding Stress
Flooding is a most prevalent and pervasive abiotic stressor having negative impact on
growth, development, and physiology of various plant species (Sharma et al. 2022).
Flooding causes chlorosis, necrosis, abscission, and foliarsenescence in addition to a
lossin shoot and root biomass and hydraulic conductivity (Lukic´ et al. 2021). Though
flooding is regarded as a complex stress, advanced shoot elongation, alteration in
leaf morphology, adventitious root growth, aerenchyma production, pressurized gas
flow, and deposition of gas coatings on surfaces of leaf are some of the key responses
in escape plants (Bispo and Vieira 2022). Flooding substantially restricts exchange
of gases between the plants and surroundings, which leads to various internal mod￾ifications in plants. Submerged plant parts lack oxygen and/or carbon dioxide and
may build up a lot of the gaseous hormone ethylene. While some crop species can
only survive a brief inundation of the soil, some flood-resistant plants can endure
partial or total flooding for some days or even months (Park et al. 2022). Studies
have proved that the utilization of organic polymers can alleviate the harmful effect
of flooding stress. For example, administration of humic acid increased water stress
resistance and decreased oxidative stress like MDA and H2O2 by improving antiox￾idative enzymes phenolic compounds and proline content in rice seedlings (García
et al. 2012). Similarly, foliar administration of chitosan increased waterresistance by
improving growth, physiological constituents, and yield of cowpea plants exposed to
water stress (Farouk and Amany 2012).
18.5.4 Biotic Stress
Plants have to deal with various types of biotic stressors like bacteria, fungi,
nematodes, insects, parasites, weeds, and viruses. To effectively cope up with these
biotic stressors plants utilize an inducible defense mechanism which is close to the
defense which is affected during abiotic stress (Kaur et al. 2022; Kumar and Ohri
2022). Plant growth regulators including salicylic acid, brassinosteroids, cytokinin,
auxin, ethylene, and jasmonic acid are primarily responsible for regulating the
activation of defense responses and associated signals in plants; in addition to
phytohormones organic polymers such as algal polysaccharides, chitosan, alginate,
humic acid, and xanthan are some of natural inducers that can activate plant
defense mechanisms and promote growth and development. Eco-friendly sub￾stances that can promote plant development while also causing pathogen resistance18.6 Superabsorbent Organic Polymer and Agriculture 415
and activating the expression profiling of defense pathway include polysaccharides
and oligosaccharides (Saberi Riseh et al. 2022). Algal polysaccharides are one of
the common and varied types of organic compounds, which can enhance plant
resistance (Popletaeva et al. 2018). Alginate, a linear biopolysaccharide co-polymer
composed of L-guluronate and β-D-mannuronate, can be organized in blocks that
are both heteropolymeric and homopolymeric. Alginate can promote growth and
development of plant along with induced resistance against biotic and abiotic
stress resistance in plants (González et al. 2013). Lemic et al. (2021) performed an
experiment for the management of pests by using apitoxin-loaded calcium-alginate
microspheres. It has been observed that microspheres laden with apitoxin have
a negative impact on insects and can be used as an eco-friendly method for pest
management. Similarly, application of chitosan and oxalic acid to fungal-stressed
strawberry plants reduced spore germination, linear growth and elongation of germ
tube of fungi, Rhizopus stolonifer and Botrytis cinerea, and enhanced the enzymatic
activity and levels of phenolic compounds of strawberry plants (Thabet 2019). In
another experiment administration of humic acid increased the percent mortality of
infective juveniles, decreased egg masses and population of Meloidogyne incognita;
treatment with humic acid also increased root and shoot length and root and
shoot weight of banana plants exposed to the nematode stress (Seenivasan and
Senthilnathan 2018). Another study reported similar results where it was observed
that chitosan has a crucial role in the activation of defense system along with pro￾tecting tomato plants from the diseases caused by Alternaria solani (Sathiyabama
et al. 2014). Similarly, chitosan oligosaccharide increased the mortality of the
infective stage of M. incognita, enhanced photosynthetic pigments, and altered the
immune system in tomato plants (Fan et al. 2020).
18.6 Superabsorbent Organic Polymer and Agriculture
Superabsorbent organic polymers are polyelectrolytes having 3D structure where
the polymer chains are attached by cross-linking. These hydrophilic polymers
have deep range of implementations and have proved to be an asset in the field
of agriculture. Their popularity in the agricultural sector is attributed to their
biodegradability, high water-absorbing ability, and low-cost production (Sinha
2018; Behera and Mahanwar 2019). Since superabsorbent organic polymers have
very high water-absorption as well as retention properties, they can be utilized,
especially in arid areas, to keep moisture in soil and deal with the issues of water
scarcity for irrigation purposes (Souza et al. 2016; Milani et al. 2017; Thombare et al.
2018). They serve as excellent water-saving and soil-conditioning materials and help
to ameliorate drought stress in water-deficit regions (Dabhi et al. 2014). Along with
revamping the water use proficiency, superabsorbent polymers can also be used in
coalition with fertilizers to attain their controlled release in fields for sustainable
production (Tubert et al. 2018; Li et al. 2018). They enhance growth of the plants by
improving mineral absorption by plants and also reduce environmental pollution
(Chang et al. 2021).416 18 Application of Organic Polymers in Agriculture
18.6.1 Superabsorbent Hydrogels and Water Retention
In agriculture, irrigation plays a central role in the plant growth by supplying essen￾tial nutrients to soil. The high cost of irrigation processes in arid regions has become
a matter of concern. In such water-deficit regions, superabsorbent hydrogels (SAH)
provide a feasible and cost-effective alternative. SAH is a 3D polymer network of
crosslinked chains comprising ionic monomers that tend to swell up when aqueous
solutions are provided and retain moisture in soil (Ullah et al. 2015; Milani et al.
2017). SAH has a vast array of applications in agriculture like reduced consumption
of water and cost of irrigation, improved health and growth of plants, stabilization
of fertilizers in the soil, and prevention of seeping out of essential nutrients into the
groundwater (Behera and Mahanwar 2019).
SAH, owing to the existence of several hydrophilic groups along with a vast quan￾tity of free volume between polymer chains, can soak up and hold large quantities
of water, approximately 10–1000 g/g (Zohuriaan-Mehr et al. 2010). Various reports
have depicted that the water-holding properties of the soil were amplified to a signifi￾cant level by the inclusion of SAH (El-Tohamy et al. 2014; Liao et al. 2016; Mohawesh
and Durner 2019). At the time ofrainfall and/orirrigation after being incorporated in
the moistened soil, SAH granulesswell by soaking up water.In the act ofsoil dryness,
these granulessteadily release water through diffusion, thus preventing evaporation
and loss of irrigation water (Behera and Mahanwar 2019). Moreover, when watered,
SAH can swell up and inflate, thereby increasing the porosity of the clay and aera￾tion capacity of soil and hence supplying better oxygen to the roots of the plant for
their proper growth and development (Figure 18.3).
18.6.2 Superabsorbent Polymers and Drought Stress
Drought has adverse effects on sustainable agriculture. It negatively affects the
plant growth and development ultimately having an impact on the yield. It has
noteworthy effects on plant metabolism and has potential to alter physiological

and biochemical properties of the plant (Khan et al. 2019). Drought decreases the
soil-nutrient-utilizing ability of plants and can induce free radicals. Moreover, it
reduces chlorophyll content and accentuates ethylene biosynthesis. It negatively
affects the subcellular compartments of plants to the tissue and organ levels
(Vurukonda et al. 2016). Plants have various natural inbuilt strategies to survive
under drought stress using various physiological processes like osmotic adjustment,
stomatal regulation, and development of root system. But to enhance their drought
tolerance capability artificially, various strategies are also available like application
of nitric oxide, proline, plant growth-promoting microorganisms, or hormones
(Ilyas et al. 2021). Trending drought-coping strategies to secure agricultural produc￾tion involve several methods like the addition of nutrients, fertilizers, composting,
mulching, giving water to soil, seedbed procedure, shedding, tillage, and maturing
(Azadi et al. 2018). Other strategies include use of integrated rhizosphere manage￾ment that includes association of drought-tolerant microorganisms, nanoparticles,
and plant-growth-promoting microorganisms which alter the effect of drought by
improving morphological characters, physiological characters, adjusting biochem￾ical processes (Zia et al. 2021). Use of organic polymers is one such method that
prevents the adverse effects of drought in agriculture field. These polymers have the
ability to enhance the soil-water-holding capacity. Among various organic polymers
like polysaccharides, proteins, and other molecules, some organic molecules have
a great tendency to hold water in the soil. These are called SAPs. SAP is a 3D
network of polymers which can help in retention of abundant water. These SAPs
can be polyelectrolyte gel. Their molecules can absorb water and swell because of
electrostatic repulsion that takes place between charged chains of polymers and
osmotic imbalance (Ono et al. 2007; Klein and Poverenov 2020). SAP can provide
nutrients and pesticides containing water to the plant via the absorb–release–absorb
process near the roots. The resistance to expansion caused by hydrogen bonds and
crossed-linked structure as well as the expansion due to a repulsive ionic charge
of macromolecular electrolytes determines the major water-absorbing capacity of
SAPs (Bo et al. 2012). Natural as well as synthetic polymers can be used to make
SAPs. Natural polymers include collagen, cellulose, chitosan, dextran, alginate, and
chitin, while synthetic polymers can be vinyl acetate, acrylic and methacrylic acid,
polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and various acrylates. These molecules are
highly flexible enabling their polymers to hold more water (Behera and Mahanwar
2019). One vastly studied example of SAP is superabsorbent resin; the mechanism
behind its water-absorbing capability involves its network-like microstructure
of polymeric chains made of starch or cellulose or any synthetic compound like
polydactyly acid and the osmotic pressure created by hydrophilic groups including
hydroxyl and carboxyl groups that forms the dynamic bases of water absorption
(Ai et al. 2021). In SAP, crosslinking is of two types; bulk crosslinking occurs
in that polymerization in which some co-monomers act as crosslinking agents
having higher functionality than other polymers and surface crosslinking in which
surface treatment is necessary during polymerization that includes post-treatment
of electrophilic polysubstituted compounds or polyvalent metal salts resulting in
super crosslinked shell with higher absorption and water retention capacity of418 18 Application of Organic Polymers in Agriculture
the polymers (Behera and Mahanwar 2019). This helps SAP absorb a thousand
times more water than the weight of its molecule without dissolving itself; they
absorb water and swell to retain water in them (Chang et al. 2021; Esteves 2011).
The addition of these SAP to soil can combat the water scarcity problem in
drought-prone areas enhancing better crop cultivation strategies. SAP present in
soil can help in storing a sufficient amount of water; thus, less amount of water is
required in the field, and it also reduces the loss of soil water via evaporation in
deserted hot areas as it can release water stored in it (Cannazza et al. 2014). SAP can
even release the pre-absorbed water rapidly to the plant roots when required, the
respective water is released up to an equilibrium limit to that of respective molecule
absorbing water from the SAP molecule (Yang et al. 2020a). Moreover, it is a good
soil conditioner and the addition of superabsorbent polymer in the soil increases
biomass, panicle number, grain yield along with relative water amount, and fertility
rate of soil. It also monitors the temperature variations in soil, transpiration rate,
chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, growth attributes of plants and yield (Yang
et al. 2020b; El Idrissi et al. 2023). Use of these polymers is also eco-friendly, the
degradation of superabsorbent polymers in soil in the presence of microorganisms
was investigated, and it was found that these soil microorganisms can solubilize
the polymers followed by their mineralization (Stahl et al. 2000). The outcomes of
using SAP on various plants under droughtstress have been reported during various
studies. For instance, use of SAP for better growth also enhanced water retention
capacity of soil and exhibited no adverse effects on soil microbiota (Li et al. 2013).
Another study demonstrated the positive effects of SAP application in field of green
pepper by increasing the soil porosity and the water-holding capacity from 59.5%
to 81.3% with increased nutrient levels in plants (Fan et al. 2019b). Additionally,
SAP as a soil amendment resulted in improved tolerance of tomato plants toward
drought; it also enhanced the yield of tomato fruit by 16% (Cerasola et al. 2022).
Fruit of mango orchards also showed a gain in fruit quality, and in yield of mango
and soil water content in the presence of superabsorbent polymers which also saved
40% water application to the plants thus reducing irrigation volume to obtain better
fruits (Liu et al. 2019). The use of superabsorbent along with salicylic acid was
also reported to neutralize the consequences of drought in mung bean (Balli et al.
2019). In one study a lab prepared SAP resin and used it under drought conditions
which ensured improved seed germination and seedlings growth with better root
and stem height in Artemisia desertorum (Zhang et al. 2020). Further, SAP as a
mixture is found to be more effective on plants, for example, a mixture of SAP along
with fertilizer was found effective in increasing growth and chlorophyll content
strengthening antioxidant activities and enhancing sugar and protein content
in bamboo species for better development (Fan et al. 2019a). Additionally, SAP
comprising attapulgite, straw biochar, polyacrylamide, and humic acid exhibited
better results in holding soil water and germination of maize seeds (Yu et al.
2019). Even SAP-embedded bacteria are also used for successful establishment and
survival of plants. A study in this regard has been done on eucalyptus seedlings
whose drought tolerance was enhanced due to application of two Pseudomonas
strains embedded in acrylic-hydrocellulosic SAP (Chaín et al. 2020). A combinationReferences 419
of SAP with exopolysaccharides-secreting bacteria in a study was found to improve
the tolerance of maize plant with maize plant; it also improved growth of plant
along with maize yield (Yaseen et al. 2020). Moreover, application SAP (A200),
another kind of water-absorbing SAP along with manure, was found effective
against drought and induced resistance in wheat plants (Gholinezhad and Eivazi
2021).
18.7 Conclusion
It is a deep-rooted fact that excessive use of agrochemicals, soil contamination, and
various environmental stresses, abiotic as well as biotic stress, pose detrimental
impact on the agriculture-based economy by directly lowering the crop production.
Additionally, this drop in crop production is getting worse day by day. The use of
polymers is one of the many ways that have been explored to combat this productiv￾ity drop and may be a workable, ecologically secure substitute. In this continuation,
organic polymers have been reported to act as soil conditioners and carriers for
the controlled release of agrochemicals leading to improved properties of soil and
reduced soil pollution leading to the better growth of plants. Further, organic
polymers also efficiently alleviate different environmental stresses, resulting in
increased crop yield. Furthermore, superabsorbent polymers also aid in increased
productivity by increasing drought resistance in plants, though further research is
required to explore and decode the additional facets of application and functioning
of organic polymers in agriculture.

19.1 Introduction
Humans are facing serious issues due to the scarcity of resources and the quick
consumption of fossil fuels, such as an energy shortage, greenhouse effects, and
environmental damage. Thus, to overcome these obstacles, numerous efforts have
been made to pursue alternate forms of clean, sustainable energy and technology
(Chakraborty et al. 2019). To achieve this goal, the use of recyclable catalysts for
organic synthesis to reduce waste production and maximize catalyst efficiency has
been thoroughly researched during the past few decades. Photocatalyst development
has exploded during the past few decades, with an emphasis on inorganic semicon￾ductors (such as TiO2, CdSe, WO3, ZnS, and ZnO), as well as metal complexes (such
asruthenium and iridium complexes), organic dyes, and others(e.g. fluorescein and
rose Bengal). In any case, the down-to-earth utilizations of homogeneous photocata￾lysts are compelled by the noxious nature, significant expense, and innate disservice
of uncommon metal parts. Also, a significant number ofthem are justinitiated by UV
light, making it hard to use the sun’s energy completely. POPs have in this way turned
into a promising stage for viable photocatalysis. Ongoing advancementsin the blend
of nanoporous polymers, like covalent-natural system (COF), and other permeable
natural polymers (POPs) present new open doors for heterogeneous catalysis.
Large pores, high specific surface areas, superior stability, and durability in a vari￾ety of solvents are characteristics of porous organic polymers (POPs), which are
advantageous for mass transfer, supplying more active sites, and the photocatalytic
recycling process (Liu and Liu 2020).
POPs are a family of multi-dimensional porous network materials made of various
organic building blocks with varying geometries and topologies linked together via
strong covalent bonds (Zhang and Riduan 2012). POPs can be classified into the cat￾egory of amorphous or crystalline POPs. Amorphous POPs mostly incorporate poly￾mers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), hyper-cross connected polymers (HCPs),

and formed microporous polymers (CMPs) which elements expanded pi formation
framework in contrast with other undefined POPs, and permeable sweet-smelling
systems (PAFs), while glasslike POPs are addressed by covalent organic framework
systems (COFs) and covalent triazine structure (CTFs), have requested structure.
The polymers can be synthesized in a variety of particle morphologies, including
nanosphere, nanosheet, and nanotube, by carefully balancing reaction conditions,
monomer structure, and synthesis technique. POPs are analogous to other porous
materials like porous carbon and molecular organic framework (MOFs) in that they
have surface areas per gram thatrange from hundredsto thousands ofsquare meters
(Figure 19.1).
POPs’ advantages of a large specific surface area and structural (morphological,
compositional) tailor ability make them favorable for chemical transformation reac￾tions in terms of locally segregated exclusiveness for particular reactions and cat￾alytic sites. POPs with active mononuclear metal centers work more efficiently than
molecular metal catalysts as single-site catalysts for synthetic organic chemistry.
POPs’ large surface areas, regularly spaced structural components (particularly for
COFs), and generally uniform pore sizes enable the materials to move through and
interact with one another with ease within the channels and networks of POPs dur￾ing the catalytic process. POPs can achieve high catalytic efficiency per unit mass or
specific surface area, serving as more than just heterogeneous substrates for molec￾ular catalysts.
19.2 Synthesis of POP Catalyst
19.2.1 Radical Polymerization
The radical mechanism-assisted polymerization of alkene groups is a popular
technique for creating single-site catalysts. Therefore, for alkene functionalization,
ligands that exhibit the appropriate selectivity and activity in homogeneous catal￾ysis are frequently the initial choice, followed by creating novel heterogeneous
catalysts by polymerization. Free radical chain development polymerization,
which is begun by an extreme initiator, is the system for polymerization. While
utilizing solvothermal union, the polymerization step is as often as possible did
by whirling the monomers and extremist initiator together at room temperature
first. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), are chlorobenzene
is the most often utilized solvents, while different choices incorporate ethyl acetic
acid derivation, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, and blends with benzo trifluoride and19.2 Synthesis of POP Catalyst 435
water. This kind of polymerization regularly utilizes monomers that are roused by
phosphine or nitrogen-based ligands like PPh3, BINAP, or bipyridine. Rather than
most other routinely utilized polymerization strategies, extremist polymerization
has the advantage of occurring without the utilization of metal impetuses. As a
result, this method eliminates the possibility of metal contamination in the final
metal–POP catalyst; hence, no safety measures are necessary. Radical polymeriza￾tion produces polymers that are frequently quite flexible and produce environments
that are practically quasi-homogeneous. The high frequency of benzylic C–H groups
in the polymer backbone, despite the robustness of these polymers, may make them
vulnerable to oxidation or functionalization in the presence of radical-generating
reaction conditions, such as certain oxidations and cross-coupling reactions.
19.2.2 Free Radical Reactions
Another crucial technique for creating single-site catalysts on polymer substrates
is Friedel–Crafts alkylation/acylation polymerization. FeCl3 or AlCl3 is used
in stoichiometric or excess amounts, together with a linker precursor such as
dichloromethane or formaldehyde dimethyl acetal, to perform the polymerizations.
Since the Friedel–Crafts reaction can occur directly on aryl moieties without
any pre-functionalization, it has the advantage of not requiring the same kind of
synthetic alteration on the building blocks as the other approaches described for the
creation of POPs. This implies, however, that if the ligand sites contain nucleophilic
aryl groups, cross-linking may be unselective and may even change the ligand sites.
Despite the low cost of the metals employed for polymerization, the requirement
for stoichiometric quantities during polymerization once again highlights the
significance of efficient strategies for metal removal from POP.
19.2.3 Sonogashira Coupling
Further polymerization reaction that produces POPsforsingle-site catalysisinvolves
the coupling of a terminal alkyne and an aryl halide, or Sonogashira coupling. Usu￾ally, in this process, THF or DMF and PPh3 and NEt3 are present and the process
was catalyzed by a catalyst combination of palladium/copper. A helpful character￾istic in the synthesis of POPs is the coupling of two distinct functions, which gives
complete control over the polymerization process and allows for the formation of
exclusively ABAB-composed polymers. This is different from the polymerization
processes mentioned above, when the building pieces are incorporated into the poly￾mer backbone at random.
Unfortunately, a precious metal catalyst is needed for the polymerization. A trust￾worthy procedure is also required because the Sonogashira coupling involves the
two transition metals.
19.2.4 Miscellaneous
It has additionally been demonstrated the way that polymerization can happen
by build-up, with water discharge going as the driving variable, a method for the436 19 Porous Organic Polymers as Potential Catalysts
polymerization of 1,3,5-triformyl-phloroglucinol and amino-functionalized por￾phyrin by a keto enamine condensation was used. In contrast to the other methods
described above, this sort of polymerization approach does not call for additions in
the form of radical initiators, metal catalysts, or stoichiometric concentrations of
metal. Although theoretically possible, the condensations can be reversed, and the
resulting polymer could not be as strong as those joined by carbon-carbon bonds.
There have also been reports of polymerization using oxidative coupling. In the
study by Han et al., two distinct tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium(III)-complexes were
polymerized to create iridium-based photocatalysts. The related polymer, which had
a high iridium loading, turned out to be ideal for photocatalysis. In contrast to many
of other examples given here, thistype of polymerization approach does not call for a
linker. BET surface areasfor two iridium-based polymers, however, are still between
460 and 480 m2 g−1 and the polymers have a distinct microporous structure even in
the absence of a stiff linker.
Other processes for producing metal-POPs include Suzuki cross-coupling
between bromide-functionalized porphyrins and aryl boronic esters, nucleophilic
aromatic substitution between fluoride-functionalized porphyrins and linkers
containing hydroxy-groups, nickel-catalyzed Ullmann coupling for polymerizing
porphyrin moieties, and oxidative Eglinton coupling for producing Ru-bpy-POPs.
19.3 Advantageous Features of POPs
The area of porous materials has greatly advanced, moving from inorganic zeolites
to coordination polymers or metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and in the present,
POPs and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Heterogeneous catalysts must have
had both chemical and thermal stability. Although MOFs and COFs are known to
have a large surface area and porosity, the majority of these materials frequently
exhibit significant moisture and pH sensitivity, which can cause structural collapse.
POPs, in contrast, have exceptional stability in practically all common solvents,
including water, as well as throughout a wide range of pH values (Kaur et al. 2011).
Additionally, POPs, particularly CMPs, are very stable at high temperature and
hydrothermal conditions and continue to be a good option for catalysts in chal￾lenging circumstances. Zeolites have good thermal and chemical stability as well;
however, they are a poor candidate for catalysis due to their difficulty incorporating
specified functionality into the skeleton for particular applications. However, the
user-friendliness of these materials is further enhanced by the straightforward
synthesis of POPs and structural alterations.
19.4 Principle
The electrons at the valence bands (VB) are typically stimulated to the conduction
bands (CB) and simultaneously depart the VB, resulting in excited electrons and
holes in the CB and VB, respectively, when POPs absorb photons with energy equal19.5 Properties and Functions 437

to or higher than their band gaps (Zhang et al. 2020). They then proceed to the sur￾face of the photocatalyst for a redox reaction. Many reactive chemicals, including
the superoxide radical (O2) and singlet oxygen (
1O2), hydroxyl radical (OH), hydro￾gen peroxide (H2O2), photogenerated hole, and electrons, may be involved in these
photocatalytic processes. Control experiments are typically performed to pinpoint
the likely reactive species and the proper scavenger (Figure 19.2).
19.5 Properties and Functions
The structural, physical, and functional properties of porous organic materials
have a significant impact on how they are used. The initial stage in managing the
structure–property–function of porous organic materials is accurate synthesis of
organic molecules since molecular architectures determine processing strategies,
structures, features, and end functions, including self-assembly. Pore size is the
primary structural component. The relationship between pore size and surface
area and volume ultimately affects end functions including size-based permeability
and selectivity for visitor species. Hard templating and other approaches have been
used to manipulate macropore diameters, which is a very simple process. Similar to
that, soft templates can be used to control mesopore diameters. Through molecular
self-assembly and guided assembly, the successful development of block copoly￾mers over the past few decades has made it possible to have exceptional control
over the size and arrangement of mesopores at the molecular level. However, the
manipulation of the organic polymers’ micropore diameters has largely remained
some art. Organic frameworks with naturally small pore size distributions are one
exception. There have been some accomplishments in manipulating the micropore
diameters of porous polymers thanks to mechanisms that have been discovered to
control the structures, configuration, and conformation of organic molecules. There
is still much potential for improvement when it comes to controlling the spatial
arrangement of the micropores, which affects the gas separation and filtration
performances. It is frequently insufficient to have perfect control over a single438 19 Porous Organic Polymers as Potential Catalysts
pore size for mass movement with high flux and rapidity. Multiple types of pores
must be prepared at various length scales, but more significantly, their intercon￾nectedness must be guaranteed. Reduced structural tortuosity is still a significant
obstacle for porous membranes that transport guest molecules, in addition to pore
interconnectivity.
Interfacial characteristics, one of the many features, control the wettability to liq￾uids, the binding affinity to molecules, and eventually the molecular permeability
and adsorption selectivity. Surface functional groups are primarily responsible for
controlling these features. Surface functions must be adjusted in order to maximize
the capabilities of porous organic materials in separation, gasstorage, and biological
applications. For instance, functional group-decorated pore surfaces in gas separa￾tion membranes can interact with specific gasesin a selective manner. The molecules
that make up the porous matrix’s building blocks can be designed to have surface
functional groups. Atsome time, the organic matrix startsto incorporate these func￾tional groups naturally. As an alternative, surface functional groups can be added
through post-processing, which involves adding moieties to functionalize porous
organic materials and change the surface chemistries. Porous organic materials can
gain functional groups through chemical changes carried out under precise control
of time, temperature, and pressure; however, care must be taken when post-treating
porous organic materials using techniques like thermal annealing. Polymers have
defined thermal stability and working temperature ranges, and handling them out￾side of these limits will permanently change or even damage their molecular struc￾tures. For precise tunability in this regard, techniques that directly alter the surface
functional groups are crucial. Notably, porous organic materials can be used in inno￾vative ways due to functional groups of variable compositions, densities, and spatial
distributions. The use of tacticsfrom other communities may help achieve this objec￾tive. For instance, spatial confinement guides the production of planar N-dopants
(pyridinic- and pyrrolic-nitrogen) over nonplanar quaternary N-dopants to regulate
the makeup of the surface functions of graphene electrocatalysts.
19.6 Porous Organic Polymer as the Catalyst
19.6.1 Degradation of Organic Pollutants
In addition to endangering human health, water pollution has an impact on the
growth of aquatic creatures. The two main categories of water pollution include
organic dyes and heavy metal ionsthat are chemically stable and non-biodegradable.
To date, several techniques, including sorption, ion exchange, photocatalysis, and
sorption, have been used to eliminate or degrade organic colors in an aqueous solu￾tion (Zhang and Riduan 2012). One of the most efficient, economical, and envi￾ronmentally friendly processes is adsorption. Numerous porous substances, such
as zeolites and activated carbon, have been utilized extensively as sorbents, while
CMPs and COFs, which are emerging novel POPs, have just recently been inves￾tigated for the removal of pollutants from water. However, these sorbents usually19.6 Porous Organic Polymer as the Catalyst 439
have poor adsorption capacities. It is advantageous that many CMPs and COFs can
act as sorbents and photocatalysts for the removal of dyes or the photodetoxifica￾tion of heavy metal ions for water clean-up. The huge electron-delocalized network
structure, effective light absorption, and charge carrier movement are advantageous
to them.
Methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB), and Congo Red
(CR) are common organic dyes that are released into the ecosystem by the paper,
leather, and food industries. They are exceedingly dangerous to aquatic life and
present significant environmental dangers. One or more active species, such as
the superoxide radical (O2), singlet oxygen (
1O2), photogenerated hole (h+), and
OH, may be implicated in the photodegradation of dyes in water when CMPs or
COFs are utilized as photocatalysts. The following processes occur when light is
irradiated: (i) the electron in the VB is excited to the CB, leaving holes in the VB;
(ii) Two active oxygen species, O2 and 1O2, are produced through singlet electron
transfer (SET) and energy transfer (ET) from the excited photocatalyst to molecular
oxygen; (iii) O2 reacts with water to form OH, another active species; (iv) the dyes
are degraded by one or more of the reactive oxidative species produced; and (v) the
holes spread throughout the entire polymer and further trap pollutants, facilitating
the separation of exactions. CMPs showed broad UV/vis absorption, which is
necessary for photocatalysis. Because of the fascinating photochemical properties
of polyoxometalates (POMs), the hybrid materials’ superior photocatalytic activity
outperformed that of either of their component parts. This is because CMPs have
a high degree of reusability and high porosity. Due to the powerful electrostatic
interactions between the positively charged Anderson–POMs and the negatively
charged dyes (RhB and MB), these POM–CMPs’ photocatalytic activities were also
comparable to or even greaterthan those of benzothiadiazole-based CMP nanoparti￾cles and porous carbon nitride under the same reaction conditions (C3N4). Because
Bn–Anderson–CMP has a larger BET surface area than Th–Anderson–CMP, it
also exhibits more photocatalytic activity and takes less time to achieve the same
RhB degradation efficiency. This, when exposed to light, gives additional sites
that are receptive for the photocatalytic activity. 1O2 and H2O2 were discovered to
be the principal active species in the photodegradation of RhB, and POM–CMPs
maintained a significant catalytic activity throughout this reaction.
19.6.2 Hydrogen Evolution
As a potential replacement for fossil fuels, hydrogen fuel is anticipated to only cre￾ate safe, pollution-free water and a vast quantity of heat when it is burned. This
makes hydrogen fuel a sort of clean energy. The earth’s plentiful watersupplies offer
a variety of possibilities for the generation of hydrogen.
Catalysts are required to lower the reaction’s activation barrier because the
hydrogen produced from water undergoes an energy-rising (uphill) reaction that
needs 1.23 eV of energy and a high activation barrier to overcome. The majority of
the reported photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution are inorganic semiconductors
like TiO2, and noble metal catalysts; but they have drawbacks such as pricey metal440 19 Porous Organic Polymers as Potential Catalysts

components and limited visible-light catalytic activity. Organic semiconductors
have received much scientific interest due to their various synthesis methods,
customizable electrical structures, extensive visible-light absorption, and high
carrier mobility. As a photocatalyst for the creation of hydrogen, C3N4 has typically
been utilized extensively. However, its structure and energy levels are difficult to
modify, and the synthetic temperature is often high. Contrarily, CMPs and COFs are
readily made and have tunable structural properties, and as a result, an increasing
number of CMPs and COFs have lately been described as effective photocatalysts
for hydrogen evolution (Figure 19.3).
Due to their outstanding stability, adaptable chemical structures, and unique
electron properties, CMPs have been recognized as promising candidates for
hydrogen evolution. Cooper et al. revealed how they used a library of pyrene-based
CMPs with different building block ratios to photocatalyze the production of hydro￾gen. The compositional alterations led to significant changes in their absorbance
(420–640 nm), emission spectra (445–588 nm, from blue to red emission), BET
surface areas (600–1700 m2 g−1), and band gaps (1.94–2.95 eV). Under visible-light
(4420 nm) irradiation using diethylamine as a sacrificial electron donor, the
photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate of CP-CMP1-15 initially increased and
then decreased as the optical gap expanded. This can be explained by the fact that
electron–hole recombination grew easier and gradually took the lead in restricting
the photocatalytic activity of the CMPs as pyrene concentration rose while the
energy level for charge transfer declined. COFs with an organized framework,
excellent photoelectric properties, and varying energy levels have also been used as
photocatalysts for the evolution of hydrogen.
19.6.3 Reduction of Carbon Dioxide
Recently, research has focused more on CO2 Photocatalytic conversion of CO2
into fine C1 compounds such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, and HCOOH as well as C2 or
higher-order hydrocarbons as fuels. Recently, CO2 has been successfully reduced
into CO and H2 using visible-light active POPs. PEosinY-1, -2, and 3 were created
through Sonogashira coupling of eosin Y and the corresponding terminal alkynes
TEB, DEBP, and TEB, respectively, according to Yu et al findings. The resulting
polymers showed significant micro porosity and had a large BET surface area of up
to 610 m2 g−1 and evaluated the VB and CB locations and band gap of the networks,
using electrochemical investigation. The VB potentials for PEosinY-1, -2, and -3
were found at 1.70, 1.77, and 1.68V (vs. NHE), respectively, whereas CB ranged19.6 Porous Organic Polymer as the Catalyst 441
from −0.74 to −0.76V (vs. NHE). Given that the NHE CO2/CO reduction potential
was 0.48V and the NHE H2O/O2 oxidation potential was 0.82V, it is said that all
three POPs would be able to convert CO2 to CO when exposed to water.
19.6.4 Water Splitting
Typically, aromatic nitriles or triazine precursors are used to create covalent tri￾azine frameworks (CTFs), which have a high level of thermal and chemical stability
(Xu et al. 2018). The electron-withdrawing feature of the nitrogen-rich conjugated
unit triazine makes it a potential redox-active site for photocatalytic water split￾ting (Schwinghammer et al. 2015). These characteristics make CTFs useful as het￾erogeneous catalysts and have drawn attention for their photocatalytic properties
when exposed to visible light (Puthiaraj et al. 2016). CTFs with significant photo￾catalytic activity are amorphous. The crystallinity makes it simpler to reveal the
photocatalytic activity of polymeric semiconductors due to their open-pore arrays
(Lan et al. 2018). The potent Bronsted acid catalyst was used to limit carbonization,
although at the expense of CTFs’ crystallinity. Some novel synthesis methods, such
aslow-temperature polycondensation methods, have recently been developed (Jiang
et al. 2018).
19.6.5 Oxidation
The oxidation of alkenesis one of the moststudied reactionsinvolving POPs with an
active mononuclear metal core. In 2011, Hupp, Nguyen, and colleagues successfully
epoxidized styrene using a catalyst consisting of a manganese porphyrin complex
encased in a POP. A similariron catalyst waslikewise found to have less activity after
investigation. The related manganese-porphyrin-role POPs involved in the epoxi￾dation of styrene and divinylbenzene were examined in greater detail by the same
research team in 2015. Tetrabromo-spirobifluorene and bromide-functionalized por￾phyrins underwent an Ullmann coupling to produce the catalyst. A 2017 paper on
the epoxidation of styrene employing a manganese-porphyrin-POP was written by
Gu and colleagues. Although PhIO was used as an oxidant, the polymer’s structural
makeup was very different. Five repeated runs revealed a very slight decrease in
yield, proving that these changes enabled the catalyst to be recycled.
According to Zou, Liu, and colleagues, styrene can be selectively oxidized
to phenylacetaldehyde. The catalyst was constructed of manganese porphyrins
coupled by an organic backbone, similar to the one Hupp, Nguyen, et al. used for
styrene epoxidation. The POP was created using a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling as
opposed to a Sonogashira cross-coupling. While the manganese-free porphyrin-POP
(>99% selectivity for phenylacetaldehyde) displayed significant background activity,
the manganese-metalated POP displayed a higher reaction rate.
19.6.6 Miscellaneous
Numerous additional electrocatalytic processes, such as the oxidation of benzyl
alcohol and the nitrate/nitrite reduction of nitrobenzene and N2, also use POPsTable 19.1 List of other electrocatalytic processes using POP-based electrocatalysts.

as catalysts. The efficient use of clean energy and the reduction of environmental
pollution are both significantly aided by all of these electrocatalytic reactions, which
primarily target the agrochemical industry, hydrogen fuel cells, water purification,
hazardous waste treatment, and the pharmaceutical industry (Yang et al. 2022).
The most important chemical, for example, is ammonia (NH3), which is used to
create chemical fertilizers for use in agriculture. Additionally, it works well as a
hydrogen storage and energy transporter. The electrochemical reduction of N2 to
NH3 is viewed as a potential substitute to the traditional Haber–Bosch process
of manufacturing NH3 due to its mild reaction conditions, obvious energy con￾servation benefits, and environmental protection advantages. Yan and colleagues
demonstrated that a boron-rich COF exhibits very effective activity for N2 reduction
with a faradaic efficiency of 45.43%. The high activity is attributed to the large num￾ber of B sites, whose strong Lewis acidity facilitates N2’s (a weak Lewis base) easier
adsorption in the COF. According to DFT calculations, the enhanced COF electronic
structure greatly decreases the energy barrier for N2 dissociation on B sites at a
sufficient voltage. A collision between B sites and N2 molecules is more likely due to
the concentrated high N2 concentration, which boosts the reaction activity. Su and
colleagues have proposed a potential N2 reduction catalyst, the conductive Mo-COF,
which is composed of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octaamino-metallophthalocyanine and
pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone. It has a high faradaic efficiency of about 100% and a
low over potential of 0.16V. The extraordinary activity is principally due to the
large positive charge and spin moment of the Mo core, as well as to the suitable
adsorption strength for reaction species (Table 19.1).
19.7 Conclusion
A fascinating area of research is the development and use of suitable POPs as pos￾sible photocatalysts. Due to their sustainability, accessibility, and processing abil￾ity, these POPs can frequently be produced at lower costs than other homogeneous
photosensitizers and typical inorganic transition metal-based photocatalysts. This is
particularly accurate when taking into account the ease of POP manufacturing and
potential for long-term impacts. Furthermore, it has been shown that the structure
and morphology of POPs can be dramatically altered by a modest alteration in the
synthetic conditions or the application of templating agents. There is a significant
likelihood that interesting migration and carrier movement over the skeleton will
be feasible for a number of photo-responsive applications because conjugated POPs
have sustained conjugation throughout their three-dimensional structure. This dis￾tinctive electronic arrangement rationally proves its efficient application in solar
energy conversion when combined with simple structural modifications.

20.1 Introduction
Today, polymer chemistry and physics serve as a foundation for modern technol￾ogy, enabling the manufacturing of plastics, rubber, fibers, varnishes, glues, as
well as potential composite materials. They also represent a large autonomous
field of natural science that goes by the name “polymer science.” Energy and
resource availability, food security, human health, mobility and infrastructure,
and communication will be the top issues for people in the future. Without any
doubt, the development of polymers will be essential to overcoming these obstacles.
The producer of polymeric parts that are green, energy efficient, high quality,
reasonably priced, etc. will be a major trend in the coming millennium. Modern
polymer research is very interdisciplinary and integrated, and as a result, it does
not easily fit into the conventional natural science structural models. These days,
organic polymers are used in many different technical applications, including solar
cells, sensors, and LEDs. Typically, natural polymer carriers are weak, safe for
microbes to consume, and quickly degraded by them in anaerobic environments.
Agar, sponges, chitin, carrageenan, alginate, gelatin, and chitosan are examples
of common natural polymer transporters. Synthetic organic polymer gel carriers
provide excellent mechanical strength, resistance to microbiological deterioration,
and chemical stability. Polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamides, light-curing resins,
and polyacrylic acid gel are some of the most used synthetic organic polymer gel
carriers. There are many ways to measure the importance of a specific discipline.
One is to consider its pervasiveness. Proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides
are examples of polymers that are the building blocks of life.
By the end of 2050, the global population is projected to exceed seven billion
people due to the alarming rate of growth. Huge-scale environmental pressures
have been put on our environment as a result of population increase, the growth
of massive, densely populated cities and corresponding global industrialization,
which could jeopardize food security and environmental sustainability. This has

caused the biosphere to warm and the accumulation of chemical and biological
pollutants, particularly in soils and sediments (Novais et al. 2019).
In order to feed the world’s growing population, the primary goal of agricultural
growth during the twentieth century was primarily to increase productivity per area
of land used for food production. Pesticides and fertilizers were used excessively,
which was essentially how it was accomplished, as well as overuse of water and plant
life, as well as other natural resources. Although this method significantly increased
crop production in the near area, the ability of arable land to produce decreased
and natural waterresources was exhausted, contaminated with dangerous pesticides
and artificial fertilizers, endangering the existence and wellbeing of all life forms
on Earth. As a result, the focus of food production in the twenty-first generation is
primarily on the ecological use of plant, water, and land resources in agriculture.
Modern agriculture’s main objective is to safeguard the environment and natural
resources while increasing land and water productivity. Food supply and security
are agriculture’s primary goals, but it also has other crucial roles to play. Emerging
trends, however, point to a growing importance in terms of management and conser￾vation of soil and water. Concerning anomalies in the world’s climate, throughout
human history, droughts of different intensity and duration have occurred in var￾ious regions of the world as a result of prolonged absence, insufficiency, or poor
distribution of precipitation. Mass starvation (and even famines) and a suspension
of economic activity have occurred in many nations as a result of drought events,
especially in the developing world, where agriculture is fundamentally and closely
related to economies. By concentrating on macromolecular substances that are both
naturally occurring and artificially produced, such as proteins, polyacrylates, poly￾acrylamides, and polysaccharides, discussion of these polymers has aided in the
development of polymers for agricultural use. Many commercially available natu￾ral/synthetic polymers have been luckily used as a diverse of agricultural applica￾tions because of the collaborative efforts of polymer chemists.
One of the main issues affecting human health is environmental pollution, which
is caused by the rapid expansion of the chemical, battery, steel, fertilizer, and pesti￾cide industries as well as mining operations. Metal(loid) pollution puts the health
of living things at risk. The ecosystem has undergone major changes due to the
build-up of metal(loids) due to anthropogenic and natural activity (Luna et al. 2016).
Environmentally harmful substances such as cadmium, chromium, lead, and mer￾cury have also been connected to a number of diseases, including birth deformities,
damage to internal organs like the kidney and also liver, specific learning difficul￾ties, a range of different ailments. These metals can be found in wastewater and
soil along with other metal ions. Because of their toxic, mutagenic, genotoxic, or
carcinogenic effects, their presence in the environment puts human health at risk.
Metal(loid) are both naturally occurring parts of the earth’s crust and man-made
products. While some metal(loid)serve as vital micronutrientsforliving things, they
can also be extremely poisonous in high amounts. Because they are not biodegrad￾able, metal(loid) ions stay in the ecosystem. As the surface tension of the water at
polluted areas decreases, they become bioavailable for removal (Ayangbenro and
Babalola 2017; Das 2019; Fashola et al. 2016; Sriram et al. 2011).20.1 Introduction 449

20.1.1 What Are Polymers?
Polymers are organic macromolecules which are essentially composed of a number
of smaller molecules are called as monomer. Polymer is the Greek word for “many
parts.” We see polymers everywhere we turn. From polypropylene, a substance that
is used all over the world, to the human DNA strand, a biopolymer that naturally
occurs.
Natural polymers are those that can be found in animals and plants, while syn￾thetic polymers are those that are created by people. Due to their distinct physical
and chemical characteristics, many polymers are employed in daily life (Table 20.1).
20.1.2 Types of Polymers
Polymers can be classified as
1) Organic Polymers
2) Inorganic polymers
20.1.3 What Are Organic Polymers?
Macromolecules known as organic polymers are made up of many monomer units
that repeat. Both man-made and natural polymers are essential to daily living.
The three primary categories of biopolymers found in living cells are polysaccha￾rides, polypeptides, and polynucleotides. These polymers are created in cells by
enzyme-mediated mechanisms. Synthetic polymers are often made from monomers
that include two or more functional groups, a multiple bond, or a ring with three to
seven members. While the physical characteristics of polymers vary, their chemical450 20 Developing Trend in Organic Polymer Science

characteristics are obtained from their monomer units. The physical characteristics
of polymers determine whether they are thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, or
fibers.
There are numerous uses for polymers. In the biomedical field, biodegradable
polymers are frequently employed for tissue engineering and drug delivery. Wet
suits and shoe soles both contain neoprene. Teflon is utilized in non-stick pans,
polyvinyl chloride is used in pipes, and other polymers are widely employed in tex￾tiles and fabrics. Polyethylene terephthalate, a synthetic polymer, is used to make
the well-known polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. Appliances and house￾hold gadgets are made with polystyrene resins. The textile and plastics industries
both make substantial use of nylon-6. Many consumer goods contain the glass-like
polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (Figure 20.1).
20.1.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of Organic Polymers
Over the past 200 years, the swift rise in the world’s population and consumption
patterns has had a number of negative repercussions on the environment. When
developing a society with more sustainable production/consumption systems, con￾siderations for scenarios like deforestation, water pollution, soil silting, and solid
waste accumulation should be taken into account. In relation to plastic wastes(Kaza
et al. 2018), they account for 12% of the solid waste produced worldwide, and since
1950, their annual output has increased. They generated more than 6 billion tons of
trash between 1950 and 2015 (Geyer et al. 2017).
It is unlikely that synthetic plastics with petrochemical origins can ever totally
replace them in the short or even long term, despite the fact that technology and
bioproducts, such as bioplastics, can help ameliorate these environmental difficul￾ties. However, some applications for bioplastics may eventually be largely replaced
(Tharanathan 2003). Forinstance, because they account for a sizeable amount of the
world’s plastics output, biodegradable polymers for packaging and other short-lived
use sectors are practicable (Hopewell et al. 2009; Li et al. 2016).20.2 Applications of Organic Polymers 451
Bioplastics include, for instance, materials made from cellulose and starch,
polymers created through microbial fermentation, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates
(PHAs), and biomaterials created chemically from renewable raw materials, such as
polylactic acid (PLA), bio-polyethylene (BPE), bio-nylons, and bio-polyurethanes.
The production of BPE involves polymerizing ethylene from bio-ethanol, the
production of bio-nylon involves synthesizing diacids from biomass, and the pro￾duction of bio-polyurethanes involves adding polyols from plants (Queiroz and
Collares-Queiroz 2009). Even oils, though, can serve as a feedstock for the
production of bioplastics (Abe et al. 2021).
Bioplastics are made from agro-polymers, which include proteins (casein, zein,
gluten, and gelatin) and agro-polymers including starch, cellulose, pectins, and
hemicellulose. In order to create the semi-rigid three-dimensional polymeric
network that contains the solvent, these natural polymers often entail intra- and
intermolecular interactions as well as cross-links (crosslinking) between polymeric
elements (Tharanathan 2003; Guilbert et al. 1995).
However, exorbitant costs compared to synthetic polymers made from fossil fuels
and worries about functionality are preventing the large-scale manufacture of bio￾plastics for many uses (Peelman et al. 2013). Numerous biopolymers are used, but
they have disadvantages such as high water vapor permeability, oxygen permeabil￾ity, fragility, low temperature resistance, poor tensile characteristics, sensitivity to
degradation, and poor processability (Cabedo et al. 2006; Joshi 2008; Jamshidian
et al. 2010).
By producing and using bioplastics rather than synthetic plastics, harmful gas
radiation is reduced, raw materials are readily available, and a viable alternative for
disposal of solid biomass leftovers is provided. According to the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), radiation of greenhouse gases, which contribute
to environmental issues like the greenhouse effect, is a growing global concern.
By 2050, emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) must be reduced by 50% in order to
prevent a 2 ∘C rise in the global temperature. One of the ways to combat global
warming is through the use of biomaterials like biofuels and bioplastics (de Paula
et al. 2018; Naik et al. 2010).
20.2 Applications of Organic Polymers
20.2.1 In Biomedical Field
The therapeutic potential of polymers and polymeric self-assemblies in the treat￾ment of a wide range of illnesses and medical requirements has long been
recognized. By encouraging cellular regeneration and medication delivery, safety,
efficacy, and absorption into disease regions, polymer-coated biomaterials, tissue
engineering scaffolds, wound dressings, and drug delivery devices, for instance, can
all improve therapy outcomes. However, as research on this topic has progressed
over the past few decades, it has become clear that the physical characteristics of the
employed polymers, such as chemistry, charges, composition, and biodegradation,452 20 Developing Trend in Organic Polymer Science
as well as the characteristics of self-assembles, such as size, shape, and surface
chemistry, all play a significant role in determining how they behave in biological
environments.
Realizing nanostructures that can explore the body, infect and modify cells, or
find and mend damaged cellsrequires an understanding of how the physicochemical
qualities of polymeric materials affect these interactions. Our general understanding
of how material chemistry and hydrophobicity influence interactions with tissues
is still in its infancy, despite intensive research efforts devoted to studying corre￾lations between polymer molecular weights, mechanical properties, self-assembly,
solubility, and degradation behaviors. Intriguing publications have shown that the
hydrophobicity of drug-delivery systems, implants, or scaffolds for tissue regenera￾tion mediates the interactions of materials with tissues (together with other param￾eters like chemistry and molecular weights). With an emphasis on the attribute of
polymer hydrophobicity, we synthesize studiesfrom the fields of antimicrobial poly￾mers, gene transfer, tissue engineering, and lipid membrane interactions in this per￾spective. In addition to our focus on experimental investigations, we specifically
cover the many computational models of structure–property connections that have
been utilized to verify experimental results. In order to combine existing knowl￾edge and suggest prospective future study fields, we aim to identify concepts that
are shared by these distinct professions.
20.2.1.1 Applications of Polymers in the COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis for Medical
Care
For a very long time, people have recognized the value of chemistry in daily life.
There are numerous instances some of which are even emblematic where this disci￾pline ofscience hassignificantly improved our quality of life. However, occasionally,
even if subtly, concerns regarding its advantages for modern society surface. Envi￾ronmental orsocial activism has questioned the value of this science and of all those
who practice it without giving it adequate thought. We need to promote a thoughtful
and constructive dialogue regarding chemistry’s legacy.
There are countless instances where chemists have contributed to the develop￾ment of science and technology. Since the Curie couple’s (Curie 1904) experimenta￾tion with radioactive elements until Goodyear’s discovery (Korman 2002) of rubber
formulas that would later be utilized in the production of tires – via the professors
Ziegler and Natta’s (Boor 1979) production of catalysts which was used in process
called polymerization there has been chemistry. And in each of those instances, it
makes a mark, demonstrating that science is a force for good in the world. From
this angle, modern society has benefited from polymer chemistry. Many polymers
have been created and/or modified using complex methods of organic synthesis,
becoming adaptable to different uses and circumstances. The pandemic catastro￾phe that began in 2020 has demonstrated the importance of polymers in daily
living, even beyond consumption (Mitra and Wieswg 2020). By investing in mask
producers, the Japanese government was able to guarantee a monthly supply of
more than 600 million masks (Park et al. 2020). In addition, businesses whose core
competencies do not include producing polyphenylene ether (PPE) have instructed20.2 Applications of Organic Polymers 453
their manufacturers to produce masks and other medical supplies. In this instance,
14 mask production lines with a daily output of 1.7 million parts were built up
by the SAIC-GM-Wuling JV of the General Motors Company. A section of their
industrial park in Italy has been put up for this special use by many businesses
that have committed themselves to the creation of masks (Amendola et al. 2020).
The current scenario necessitates concerted action by medical experts, physical
therapists, materials engineers, and the industrial sector to reevaluate techniques
of preparation of accessible supplies, as also mentioned by Dargaville et al. (2020).
There is no denying that the way of life that society currently leads to situations
where pollution and environmental deterioration are visible. It makessense that the
environment is a topic of discussion at conferences and forums where the major
international actors (politicians and business leaders) gather. However, the current
humanitarian crisis has come to a quality of polymers, up until now, had gone unno￾ticed: their potential for diversifying their uses and adapting as necessary. As fairly
extensively discussed by Czigány and Ronkay (2020), there are numerous examples
that show how polymers have aided in the protection of lives on numerous fronts
in the struggle against the invisible foe, the coronavirus. The purpose of the cur￾rent work is to demonstrate how polymers can be employed with already-accessible
techniques to create lab test swabs and personal protective utensils.
The COVID-19 outbreak has had an effect on each productive sector, albeit to dif￾fering degrees. Due to a lack of PPE, especially masks(Corrêa & Corrêa 2020), which
were previously only necessary for health professionals but are now critical for the
general people as a major strategy of preventing the virus’ transmission, efforts are
being made to develop PPE from other materials. Companies and volunteers use
unconventional resources to supply the demand for these products, resulting in a
movement that provides strong evidence of economic circularity. One thing they
had in common was the usage of polymer materials, whether they were employed
as virgin materials (raw materials that had not yet been treated) or as recycled or
used materials.
20.2.2 In Agriculture Field
Population growth, the emergence of huge, densely populated metropolises, and
concurrent global industrialization have all put enormous environmental stresses
on our environment, possibly endangering food security and environmental sus￾tainability. Due to this, the biosphere has warmed and contaminants, particularly
in soils, have accumulated (Yazdani et al. 2007).
In order to feed the world’s burgeoning population, agricultural growth during
the twentieth century placed a major emphasis on enhancing productivity per area
of land used for the food preparation. The majority of this was done by overusing
fertilizers and insecticides, as well as overusing other natural which includes water
and plant life (Bhat et al. 2009).
20.2.2.1 Organic Polymers and Their Applications in Agriculture
In agriculture, synthetic polymers are frequently used as building materials for
mulches, greenhouses, and other structures that work to distribute water and454 20 Developing Trend in Organic Polymer Science
control its movement while fostering a favorable environment for plant growth.
However, the primary requirement for the polymers utilized in these applications
is their physical qualities as inert materials, such as transmission, reliability,
permeability, or weather ability, rather than being active molecules. Reactive
functionalized polymer science and technology is one of the most fascinating fields
of polymer chemistry for the creation of superior materials. Polymeric molecules
have been widely exploited as reactive materials because of the potential advantages
of the numerous active functional groups and the unique characteristics of the
molecules. They are used in a wide range of technological fields, such as solid-phase
synthesis, physiologically active systems, and others (Akelah 1990).
Polymeric Biocides and Herbicides Recently, technology has advanced in the usage of
controlled-release formulations, which are meant to prevent or reduce any poten￾tial negative effects associated with the use of biologically active medications. The
objectives of this method are to maintain the agent supply, enable automatic deliv￾ery of the agent to the target at controlled rates, and maintain the agent concen￾tration within the required ranges for a predetermined period of time. There are
two techniques to combine biological agents and polymeric materials function as a
rate-controlling device and serve as an agent carrier by physical combination (encap￾sulation or heterogeneous dispersion) or chemical combination (Akelah 1990).
The polymeric biocide has numerous advantages, some of which include the
following: it can be applied at lower concentrations than conventional biocides
because it releases the required amount of active agent over a prolonged period of
time; the number of applications is decreased due to the prolonged period of activity
caused by a single application; and it does not require repeated applications. Its
macromolecular design reduces the requirement for extensive dispersion of high
biocide levels in the environment, as well as evaporation and degradation losses
caused by environmental causes orleaching into the soil or waterways. Additionally,
because fewer active substances are required, it reduces the toxicity, duration, and
cost of repeated treatments. It lessens phytotoxicity by reducing the biocides’ high
soil mobility and, as a result, their presence in the food chain. Additionally, regular
herbicide use reduces phytotoxicity by lowering the high mobility of the biocides
in the soil and, as a result, minimizes their residue in the food chain. This increases
the herbicide’s selectivity to other crops. How quickly the active group is released
from the polymer matrix, the chemical makeup of the polymer backbone, and
the rate of breakdown of the connection between the active ingredient and the
polymer by chemical, biological, and physical processes are all influenced by the
chemical properties of the active agent’sstructure, the type of active–agent–polymer
bond (such as esters, amides, ureas, urethanes, or acetals), the distance between
the active agent and the polymer. The commoner content, solubility, degree of
cross-linking, stereochemistry, degree of polymerization, and chemical make-up
with the active site are all factors that affect the polymer molecule’s size, shape, and
composition.
Because they are unstable in waterlife environment, conventional herbicides with
less persistence and greater specificity must be used in larger quantities than are20.2 Applications of Organic Polymers 455
actually necessary to control the plant. Due to their lesser persistence, they also
require multiple sprays, which are costly and very harmful to farm workers. How￾ever, because persistent herbicides are frequently ingested by animals, large-scale
applications of them are not desired.
Attempting to draw a connection between the issues and the use of traditional
herbicides. In order to make certain working polymers with pesticide moieties as
pendant groups, vinyl monomer-type free radical polymerization was used, and the
rates of their hydrolysis under various circumstances were investigated. Its hydroxyl
group also provides a workable way to covalently bind to a variety of units that can
be polymerized.
A number of vinyl monomers with ester linkages that include polychloropene
(PCP) have been created (Sun et al. 1994). Styrene and 4-vinylpridine were used
to homo- and copolymerize these monomers to give the polymers a hydrophobic
and hydrophilic character, respectively (Water, pH = 4; pH = 10, dioxane-water, and
dioxane-water) are the four distinct mediums that were used to study the polymer
rates of PCP release at 30 ∘C. When different polymers’ release rates are compared,
it can be seen that the rates rise as the hydrophilicity rises. This means that copoly￾mers hydrolyze more quickly than homo-polymers, which in turn hydrolyze more
quickly than hydrophobic copolymers.
In order to illustrate the polymers’ responsiveness by altering the chemical
composition of linkage bonds and the chemical properties of the active agent struc￾ture, researchers have studied polymer herbicides with active molecules ionically
attached to ammonium salt groups (Akelah 1990). PCP has been used in con￾junction with conventional herbicides including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid,
2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 2,4-dinitro-6-methyl phenol because
they feature functional groups for binding to the polymer matrix.
The huge number of controls that were used as a means of transporting herbi￾cides and for the removal of the leftover herbicide pose the main obstacles to the
cost-effective use of these polymeric herbicides, which may be hazardous to plants
and soil. The idea of transferring pesticides to biodegradable carriers comprising
polysaccharide-based agricultural wasteslike bark,sawdust, cellulose, and other cel￾lulosic wastes has been put up in various attempts to minimize this issue. The main
disadvantages, however, are the challenges involved in attempted chemical modifi￾cation ofsuch naturally occurring polymers. Large concentrations of these bioactive
polymers, which are normally needed for herb control, will therefore unavoidably
be utilized. The pendant pesticide hydrolyzes more quickly as a result of these poly￾mers’ hydrophilic and cross-linking characteristics. Another factor is their quick
biodegradation in soil, which causes the polymeric matrix to be swiftly dissolved
and reduces the herbicide’s duration of action.
In order to reduce the detrimental effects of using too many inert polymers as car￾riers and the detrimental effects of using dissolved nitrogen fertilizers, the concept
of a controlled emitted herbicide and fertilizer duel application has recently been
used. The foundation of this concept is the use of appropriate polymers as carriers,
where the residual byproducts of polymer degradation act asfertilizerforthe soil and
plant growth. For instance, condensation polymerization has been used to produce456 20 Developing Trend in Organic Polymer Science
and polymerize herbicide derivatives of bifunctional chemicals conditions. The idea
behind the second attempt isto modify the fundamental characteristics ofsandy soil
by connecting herbicidesto polymeric hydrogels. These polymers’ principal purpose
is to regulate the pace at which herbicides are delivered, but they can also be very
helpful in preventing quick leaching, which will improve the amount of water that
sandy soil can hold onto. Because of this, using a combined strategy of water saving
and controlled release herbicides can help transform traditional agricultural irriga￾tion, particularly for sandy soil (Sun et al. 1994).
20.2.3 Bioremediation
Bio-surfactant is one of these microbial polymers that has proven useful for
complexing metal(loids). They are metabolic chemicals with surface activity and
amphiphilicity. This amphiphilic metabolite has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
moieties, and as a result, it induces the formation of micelles or the combination
of these moieties at the interfaces of fluids with different polarities, thereby
lowering the interfacial surface tension (Mazaheri Assadi and Tabatabaee 2010).
Common hydrophilic groups found in bio-surfactants include anions, cations,
mono-, di-, or polysaccharides, amino acids, and peptides. Fatty acids, which can
be branched, unsaturated, saturated, or hydroxylated, make up the hydrophobic
groups (Kitamoto et al. 2009; Singh and Cameotra 2004).
Bio-surfactants are components with varying structural characteristics that are
taken out of yeast or bacterial cell membranes. Both high- and low-molecular-weight
polymers, which are potent emulsifiers and can dramatically lower surface tension,
are present in these secondary metabolites. By emulsifying and dissolving these
hydrophobic chemicals or by changing the cell’s surface properties, hydrophobic
molecules’ bioavailability can be enhanced. Their production is regarded as a
crucial tactic to help microorganisms recover from the stress caused by pollutants
(Bezza and Chirwa 2016). They operate as mediators, increasing the pace at which
hydrophobic chemicals are transferred mass-wise by making them easily accessible
to bacteria. Additionally, they change the characteristics of cell membranes,
increasing microbial adhesion. This mechanism is essential when there are two
immiscible liquids and substrate uptake is likely (Dadrasnia and Ismail 2015),
therefore assist in overcoming the mass transfer limitations brought on by diffusion
(Bezza and Chirwa 2016).
Bio-surfactants, which have different metal(loid) binding capabilities and selec￾tivity, are produced by various microorganisms (Arjoon et al. 2013). Species-specific
selectivity in metal(loid) binding (Miller 1995) is essential to remove the target
metal(loid) since it competes with other metal(loid)s in solution (loid). Ionic radius
and surfactant-metal(loid) complex stability have an impact on selectivity as well
(Yuan et al. 2008). Rhamnolipids from Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found
to have a greater affinity for lead and cadmium than any other soil component to
which they are bonded. When compared to macronutrient cations, rhamnolipids
have a greater affinity for non-essential and necessary metallic cations, which could20.2 Applications of Organic Polymers 457
be dangerous if present in excess in exposure pathways (Torrens et al. 1998; Singh
and Cameotra 2004).
Neutral, cationic, or anionic bio-surfactants are employed as washing agents. In a
washing unit, metalloids from the excavated soils or sediments can be dispersed and
desorb (Dahrazma and Mulligan 2007). It has been proposed that anionic biosurfac￾tants use electrostatic interactionsto bind metal(loid) ions. The apparent metal(loid)
solubility is increased as a result of these complexations (Rufino et al. 2012). This
biopolymer reduces metal(loid)s, resulting in the precipitation of less soluble metal
saltssuch as phosphate and sulfide, which decreasesthe bioavailability of the metals
(Mosa et al. 2016). By sticking to the surface of sediments, drawing metal(loid) ions
from the sediment, and releasing them into the pore water, bio-surfactants produce
complexes with metal(loid) ions. When coupled with surfactant micelles, they can
therefore remove metal(loid)s that have been adsorbed to the soil (Franzetti et al.
2014; Mazaheri and Tabatabaei 2010).
Actinobacteria, bacteria, and fungi of various types all create biosurfactants.
The classifications include particulate and polymeric surfactants, phospholipids,
glycolipids, fatty acids, lipopeptides, lipoproteins, and lipopeptides (Sriram et al.
2011; Singh and Cameotra 2004). With their actions and structural traits, they have
attained a substantial level of importance. It has been observed thatseveral bacterial
species, including Arthrobacter, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas, create surfactants with
metal(loid) binding properties.
The reductive process, rather than the oxidative pathway, is used by the majority
of microbes to convert metal(loid)s. This is because metal(loid)s in their reduced
form are less hazardous. Tolerating exposure to metal(loids) is done by processes
such as accumulation, complexation, the efflux system, and reduction mechanisms.
Gene clustering on plasmids under stressful conditions can also provide resistance
to metal(loid) ions (Gnanamani et al. 2010). Due to their amphiphilic quality,
biosurfactants serve as a bridge between the fluid surfaces and lower surface
tension. Increased metal(loid) mobilization from unsaturated soils is caused by a
decrease in water surface tension, making it feasible to remove metal(loid)s as a
result.
Two key ideas have been offered as a way for biosurfactantsto remove metal(loid)s
from solutions. Through complexation of the free metal ion, biosurfactant-mediated
metal sorption is increased. The Le Chatelier principle is used in this procedure,
and the activity of the metal(loid) ion in the solution phase decreases to encour￾age metal desorption (loid). Direct contact with a metal(loid) is another mecha￾nism that operates at the solid–solution interface, where there is less interfacial
tension. The biosurfactant can then build up at the solid–solution contact, which
facilitates the binding of metal(loid) (Chakraborty and Das 2014; Singh and Cameo￾tra 2004).
The biosurfactant’s method for removing metal consists of ion exchange, counter
binding, and precipitation (loids). As part of the ion-exchange process, negatively
charged anionic biosurfactants interact with positively charged metal ions to
form a stronger bond than the one between a metal ion and soil. The cell surface
receives a negative charge from the bio surfactant. This mechanism supports the458 20 Developing Trend in Organic Polymer Science
electrostatic interaction with the metal ion. The polar head moieties of surfactant
micelles bind the metal ions, making them water soluble. The metal ions are
subsequently transferred into solution by the surfactant micelles, making it simpler
to recover the metal by flushing, washing, or pumping (Mulligan 2005; A¸sç𝚤 et al.
2010). The metal(loid) – biosurfactant complex is removed when the soil is flushed
with water because of its strong link to the soil matrix (Mulligan 2005). The same
charged ions are replaced by cationic biosurfactants, which compete with negatively
charged surfaces. The metalloid ion can then be taken out of the complex and
put to use in a variety of ways. The biosurfactant mono-rhamnolipid, which is
made by P. aeruginosa, favors metals like Cd2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ for its carboxyl
group. The combination of the metal and biosurfactant poses no threat to bacteria.
Biosurfactants are utilized for the precipitation process when cleaning dirt. Due to
the biosurfactants’ ability to create foam, the biosurfactant–metal complex can be
extracted from soil by foaming it with air. The biosurfactant can then be gathered
and produced through precipitation by reducing pH.
Dirt and metal(loids) are closely connected. This reduces the bioavailability of
bacteria. The activities of the biosurfactant–metal(loid) ion complex in the soil are
influenced by the cation-exchange capacity of the soil, its composition and pH, the
size of the particles, the kind and timing of contamination, and the geological pat￾tern. Persistent metal(loid) contamination causes soil bonding and metal(loid) ion
stabilization, which makes remediation challenging. A frequently used product for
removing arsenic and other metals (copper, lead, and zinc) from mine tailings is
the rhamnolipid biosurfactant JBR425 (Wang and Mulligan 2009). They found that
0.1% of the surfactant removed 148, 74, 2379, and 259 mg kg−1 of Pb, As, Zn, and
Cu, respectively, in an alkaline environment. They came to the conclusion that the
presence of another metal in an alkaline environment facilitated the formation of
the biosurfactant–metal complex, which allows metal bridging via the mobilization
of arsenic by the rhamnolipid surfactant (Figure 20.2).

20.3 Purification of Drinking Water
Organic polymers, which are long-chained macromolecules made up of multiple
repeating monomer units, are often utilized in modern water filtration. Theirtypical
application is in the primary coagulants or coagulant aids phases of the purification
of drinking water. In an aqueous suspension, these compounds have a tendency to
strongly adsorb the particles on their surface. A faster rate of settling, cheaper costs,
better-quality treated water, and sludge dewatering capabilities are just a few benefits
of using organic polymers.
The main applications of organic polyelectrolytes in the creation of drinkable
water are coagulation, flocculation, and the dewatering of treatment plant sludge.
Normal water production procedures are followed by sedimentation and filtration,
while the sedimentation stage may be bypassed in the event of water that is only
mildly contaminated. In waterways with a lot of algae, flotation can take the place
of sedimentation. Due to its extremely high water content and requirement to be
further concentrated to cut down on transportation costs, polymers are used in the
conditioning of the sludge after it has been acquired from the various separation
procedures. The following are a few benefits of using polymers in water treatment:
● Less requirements for coagulant dosage,
● Lesser amount of deposit,
● Lesser addition in the treated water’s ionic load
● Reduced aluminum content in water,
● Savings up to 25–30% on costs (Rout et al. 1999; Nozaic et al. 2001).
There are drawbacks, of course; the main ones are environmental factors and
higher costs in specific circumstances. Incorrect dosage can cause more sensitiv￾ity, and in some cases, turbidity and the removal of natural organics can be less
effective.
20.4 Conclusion
As organic polymers more efficiently works than synthetic polymers, the organic
polymers can be obtained in the nature from its pure form and showing a natural
approach with least of their side effects. The organic polymers are designed by the
universe so that they can easily decompose in the environment and do not harm
the ecosystem of that particular area. Despite the various applications of the syn￾thetic or composites, organic polymers are still in priority. Not only in the terms
of easy decomposition abilities, but also numerous fields rely on the organic poly￾mers. There are number of applications of the organic polymerslike bioremediation,
COVID-19 crisis, agricultural field, herbicides, weedicides, and waste water treat￾ment.In conclusion this chapteris quite close enough to explain various applications
of organic polymers over synthetic polymers.460 20 Developing Trend in Organic Polymer Science

21.1 Introduction
Some organic monomers are radically polymerized in an aqueous solution. Some
organic monomers’ functional polymers are converted via ring-opening poly￾merization, particularly ethylene oxide, ethylene imine, and oxazolines. Organic
fuctionalized materials show better properties in comparison to non-functionalized
organic materials like properties as stronger contact, separation, and reactivity.
Well-designed organic polymer with an in-chain or chain-end structure group
or classes may be changed by popular living anion methods (Storey et al. 2013).
Such types of functional organic polymer groups may be controlled by reversible
ionic activity, chain extension, branching, or crosslinking reactions. Function￾alized organic polymers are polymers that have been modified with functional
groups. These functional groups can impart new properties to the polymer,
such as optical, electronic, catalytic, or biological properties. Organic polymer
functionalization is defined by an organic functional polymer synthesis process
consisting of three main categories: direct organic functional polymer synthesis
(in situ), post-functionalization (post-polymer modification), and functional group
transformation.
21.2 Synthesis of Functionalized Organic Polymer
21.2.1 Direct Polymerization
21.2.1.1 End-Functionalized Polymerization
End-functional polymers have been produced through vinyl moieties with function￾alized terminal groups, such as carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, amine, thiol, aldehyde,

and acetyl, epoxy group (Coessens et al. 2001). The following factors can affect the
yield and functionality of a polymer synthesis: Chain-end structure: The structure
of the chain ends can affect the reactivity of the polymer and its ability to interact
with other molecules, Solvent: The solvent can affect the solubility of the polymer
and the rate of the reaction, Temperature: The temperature can affect the rate of the
reaction and the morphology of the polymer, Concentration: The concentration of
the reactants can affect the rate of the reaction and the uniformity of the polymer,
Stoichiometry: The stoichiometry of the reactants can affect the yield of the polymer
and the distribution of its molecular weights, Manner and order in which reagents
are added: The manner and order in which the reagents are added can affect the rate
of the reaction and the morphology of the polymer, Polar additives: Polar additives
can affect the solubility of the polymer and the rate of the reaction. By optimizing
the method of termination, side reaction can be reduced. In the termination pro￾cess, many functional groups may be used without protection because the reaction of
haloalkyl moieties with living chain polymers is more rapid than functional groups.
Halide-functionalized polymers, such as polystyrenes and polyacrylates, can partic￾ipate in nucleophilic substitution reactions. This is because the halide end-groups
are nucleophilic and can be displaced by a nucleophile. Numerous end-functional,
clearly defined polymeric materials have been created using this method. One of the
benefits is the capability to integrate features that cannot be accommodated during
the polymerization procedure. Moreover, when required, it enables the substance to
be characterized prior to further functionalization. Through this process, polymers
can be created, and functionality can be chosen that isideal for additionalspecialized
reactions, such as the attachment of materials to biomaterials or the immobilization
of materials on surfaces (Matyjaszewski et al. 1997; Coessens et al. 2001; Hoskins
and Grayson 2010) (Figure 21.1).
21.2.1.2 In-Chain Functionalized Polymerization
Considering that most functional groupings are harmful to life, so anionic poly￾merization, using a protective group in the production of polymeric materials, has
come to be increasingly more crucial. The protected functionality that monomers
can offer can be converted into reactive or associative pendant groups. The prepa￾ration of anionic poly(methacrylic acid) serves as a highly significant example
(Donini et al. 2002). Since carboxylic acid cannot be created by direct anionic
polymerization of the appropriate monomer (acrylic acid), the carboxylic acid
groups in the backbone are often covered by tert-butyl esters. Instead, carboxylic
acid is synthesized during polymerization hydrolysis (Morton and Fetters 1975).
Similar to this, a variety of design polymers and copolymers can be made by
sulfonating homo-polymers or styrene copolymers (Yang et al. 2002). A separate
protective system takes a different path. A well-designed material is created by an
anionically polymerizing 1-alkoxyethyl methacrylate, and polyacids are created by
acetyl group hydrolysis (Zhang and Ruckenstein 1998). Functional groups with
active hydrogen-containing chemical molecules, such as alcohol and primary and
secondary amines, require protecting groups in particular. Dimethyl-tert-butylsilyl
groups will also provide protection to alcohols (R-OHs), trimethylsilyl groups21.2 Synthesis of Functionalized Organic Polymer 467

commonly function as protective layers for primary and secondary amines, namely
RNH2 and R2NH. Halogen is one example of a reactive polymer site that can be
employed as an attachment point for premade side chains or as an initiation site.
Smart functionalized polymers have been used to create a variety of functionalized
monomers based on methacrylates, styrene, and conjugated dienes with diverse
pendant groups for applications ranging from electronics to biomedicine.
21.2.2 Post-polymerization
When direct polymerization is challenging due to the interference of certain
functional groups, post-polymerization or post-modification, a method that has
been widely employed for many years is preferred (Günay et al. 2013; Gauthier
et al. 2009). To create the appropriate functionalized polymer, the polymer may
undergo thiol-ene click reaction, sulfonation, chloromethylation, carboxylation,
formylation, esterification, alkylation, acylation, or amine functionality. When
monomers containing the desired functionality are incompatible with multiple
components, one approach is to remove protective groups through the utilization of
the polymerization process. The functional groups are protected by polymerization
of functional monomers; when the reaction is complete, the desired functionality
gets deprotected. Some examples of acidic monomers that undergo protonation and
subsequently degrade N-based ligands in transition metal complexes used as ATRP
catalysts include (meth)acrylic acid, isomeric vinylbenzoic acids, and unsaturated
sulfonic or phosphonic acids. Protected acids, such as t-bu(1,2) for the functionality468 21 Functionalization and Characterization of Organic Polymers
of acrylic acid or the TMS group, are preferred for polymerizing methacrylic acid
(MAA) using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).

The formation of copolymers with distributed tetrazole units is by the post
polymerization reaction of functionality-distributed acid. Tetrazoles are both acidic,
resembling carboxylic acids, and coordinating compounds and hence the direct
ATRP of vinyl tetrazoles has not been reported. The preparation of well-defined
tetrazole-containing polymers can be accomplished using ATRP to (co)polymerize
AN followed by a “click” chemistry (Lummerstorfer and Hoffmann 2004; Gissibl
et al. 2007) chemical modification of the produced polyAN to yield the desired
materials (Tsarevsky et al. 2004).
21.3 Transformation of Functional Group
If functionalization of the polymer via direct and post-polymerization techniques
is challenging, functional group transformation may be used. In this process, the
desired functional polymer is first modified utilizing a functional group transforma￾tion, such as oxidation or reduction, and then the undesirable functional polymer is
synthesized using direct or post-functionalization.
It is necessary to establish a network of interconnected channels in order to create
a pore structure that can accommodate guest molecules, such as gases. It is often
necessary to use stiff building pieces that stop the networks from collapsing and, as
a result, fill space more effectively in order for these pores to be stable. At least one
of the monomers (the node) needs to have connectivity greater than two in order for
a three-dimensional network to form. Network creation is conceivable when these
nodes are connected by monomers with at least two functionalities(the struts). Only
if the structure is unable to collapse and seal the pores will the network remain per￾manently porous when the solvent is removed. There are two subclasses of porous
polymer networks: crystalline networks and amorphous networks. The diameters of21.3 Transformation of Functional Group 469
the monomerstruts are related to the pore sizes of crystalline networks because they
feature well-ordered structures and homogeneous pore sizes. While certain amor￾phous polymer networks really have relatively tight pore size distributions, amor￾phous networks often have a statistically chaotic structure and may have a greater
pore size range. Similarto crystalline networks, amorphous networks’ pore size may
likewise be statistically related to the length of the monomer (Jiang et al. 2008). For
example, a series of substances known as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were
created either by the self-condensation of boronic acids or by the condensation reac￾tion of boronic acids with diolsto create boroxine rings. Crystalline porous polymers
are typically created using reversible-bond-forming chemistry.
Characterization of porous polymer networks is more difficult in comparison to
small molecules and linear, soluble polymers because of their inherent insolubility.
The utilization of conventional polymer analysis techniques such as solution NMR,
gel permeation chromatography, or MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy is not possible.
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy can provide qualitative information on the composition
of the materials. IR has been used, for example, to demonstrate monomer conden￾sation and the depletion of the early functionalities in the synthesis of COF, where
a decrease in the O–H band’s strength indicates condensation (Cote et al. 2005).
Similar to this, internal alkynes and a decrease in the intensity of terminal alkynes
are indicators of efficient Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling for conjugated microp￾orous polymers (CMPs) (Jiang et al. 2007). Similar to carbonyl networks, triazine
networks also experience an increase in the triazine ring at 1507 and 352 cm−1 and
a decrease in the carbonyl bond at 2228 cm−1 as a result of the reaction (Kuhn et al.
2008). It is frequently more difficult to evaluate the results of microanalysis of poly￾mer networks. Solid-state NMR (ssNMR) is a crucial analytical tool for insoluble
polymer networks because it can be used to confirm the final material’sstructure and
provide quantitative or semi-quantitative structural information (Jiang et al. 2007).
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a less popular but very useful technique for
determining the porosity in polymer networks (Weber et al. 2008). In comparison
to gas sorption techniques, SAXS can determine surfaces with higher areas for a
given material. SAXS can measure occluded volume, or isolated pores, which can￾not be found by sorption. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and 129Xe-NMR are two other techniques that have been used to calculate the free vol￾ume in microporous materials(Yampolskii 2007). The free volume in PIMs has been
calculated using PALS (Budd et al. 2008). PALS was used to show that the nitrogen
adsorption results were caused by the increased externally accessible surface area
of the powder, rather than its internal pore structure. 129Xe-NMR has been used to
calculate the pore size based on the chemical shift of confined xenon atoms.
21.3.1 Transforming in Conducting Polymers
Intrinsically conducting polymers (ICP), also referred to as “synthetic metals,”
are organic polymers that have the mechanical, processibility, electrical, elec￾tronic, magnetic, and optical properties of metal while retaining those of a typical
polymer. Its characteristics are inherent to the polymer’s “doped” state. Contrary470 21 Functionalization and Characterization of Organic Polymers
to “conducting polymers,” which are essentially a physical amalgamation of a
nonconductive polymer with a conducting ingredient, such as a metal or carbon
powder scattered throughout the material, this class of polymer is entirely distinct
from those “conducting polymers.” Electrical insulators or semiconductors are
both types of conjugated organic polymers. Electronic polymers are polymers
whose conductivity can be increased by several orders of magnitude from the
semiconductor regime. Electronic polymers have been used in light-emitting
diodes since 1990, electronic polymers have gained tremendous scientific and
technological significance (MacDiarmid 2001). To demonstrate the several orders
of magnitude increases in electrical conductivity that can be obtained by doping,
trans-(CH)x and polyaniline in its emeraldine base form are used. The recent find￾ing of superconductivity in regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) has exponentially
boosted the conductivity that an electronic polymer is capable of superconductivity
of an organic polymer constitutes a historical quantum leap (Schön et al. 2001).
The discovery of superconductivity in regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) was
only observed in a very thin layer of the polymer in a field-effect transistor (FET)
arrangement at a very low temperature (∼2 K). All conducting polymers, such as
poly-(para-phenylene), can be chemically or electrochemically doped to modify
the number of electrons attached to the polymer backbone. This process, known
as p- and/or n-redox doping, can significantly change the electrical properties of
the polymer (Kanatzidis et al. 1990). The instances of various forms of doping that
are shown below are only a few. The discovery of p-doping in organic polymers was
made by treating trans-(CH)x with an oxidizing agent, such as iodine. P-doping is a
process that involves the partial oxidation of the polymer backbone, which results
in an increase in the polymer’s conductivity (Chiang et al. 1978).

Polyanilines are a particularly significant class of electronic/conducting polymers.
They can be thought of as being derived from a polymer with the general composi￾tion of aniline, C6H5NH2.
21.4 Characterization of Functional Organic Polymer
An analytical method called chromatography is used to separate molecular mixtures
by distributing them among two or more phases. Chromatography comesin a variety
of forms, including gel-permeation, gas, and high-performance liquid chromatog￾raphy (HPLC), as well as ion-exchange and GC (GPC). Liquid chromatography
(LC) is a powerful analytical tool that can be used to characterize the molecular21.4 Characterization of Functional Organic Polymer 471
weight distribution, chain conformation, chemical content, and microstructure of
functionalized organic polymers (Storey et al. 2013). HPLC is an improved method
of liquid chromatography that uses high pressure to force the mobile phase through
a column packed with chromatographic packing material. Size-exclusion chro￾matography (SEC) and interaction chromatography (IC) are the two main categories
of chromatographic techniques used to analyze macromolecules. These techniques
offer high resolution, speed, and sensitivity (Chang et al. 1997). SEC is the most
widely used method for analyzing the molecular weight distribution of polymers.
The organic polymer molecules have been divided in the SEC method based on
the length of the organic polymer chain. Chain size in chemically homogeneous
linear organic polymers varies with molecular weight. As a result, SEC may not be
regarded as an effective approach for separating organic polymer molecules where
the molecular features, such as chemical composition, molecular conformation,
and functionality, do not simply correlate with chain size (Chang 2005). GPC, a
kind of SEC, is used for analyzing the composition of copolymers as well as for
determining molecular-weight distributions. Branched copolymer analysis often
calls for a variety of characterization techniques. By using the appropriate detectors
and analysis techniques, it is possible to obtain qualitative information about
long-chain branching or identify the distribution of a copolymer’s constituents
(Rowland and Striegel 2012). SEC was used to characterize the thermal degradation
of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), and
their blends before and after reactive extrusion with a chain extension/branching
agent containing nine glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) groups (Hoskins and Grayson
2010). In fact, the decrease in molecular weight is a sign of heat breakdown in PLA
and PBAT. The measurements of the average molecular weight were conducted to
fully understand the chain extension/branching balance that occurs during reactive
processing. The SEC of modified PLA and PBAT shows that the polymers have
developed extended and branched chains, which has increased their molecular
weight. The incorporation of this functionalized epoxy into PLA and PBAT also
significantly increases and improves their Mw and thermal stability (Al-Itry et al.
2012). Donini et al. (2002) used SEC to characterize the derivatization procedure of
poly(caprolactone) (PCL). They discussed the development and characterization of
PCL modified with acrylate and azide functional groups. SEC analysis showed that
the molecular weight of the copolyesters decreased slightly when azide replaced
chloride. The SEC curves also show that the cycloaddition was successful. The SEC
study also showed that the cycloaddition conditions were mild enough to protect
the polymer chains from significant degradation. The polydispersity index (PDI)
increased from 1.5 to 1.6 after the cycloaddition reaction, while the apparent molar
mass (AM) decreased from 20,000 to 18,000 g mol−1 (Riva et al. 2007). GPC was used
to characterize the star polymers and supramolecular structures that were formed
when polystyrene (polySt) and poly(polyethylene glycol) acrylate (polyPEG-A)
were used to make three-armed biodegradable star polymers using a trifunctional
reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) agent. GPC was used to
characterize the star polymers and supramolecular structures that were formed472 21 Functionalization and Characterization of Organic Polymers
when polystyrene (polySt) and poly(polyethylene glycol) acrylate (polyPEG-A) were
used to make three-armed biodegradable star polymers using a trifunctional RAFT
agent (Setijadi et al. 2009).
In 2011, a study was published that established the critical conditions for liquid
chromatography at critical conditions (LCCC) analysis of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)
(PEtOx) (Tsarevsky et al. 2004). Liquid chromatography under critical con￾ditions (LCCC) was successfully used to analyze a number of customized
poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx) homopolymers with end groups of different
polarity, as well as a block copolymer of PEtOx with a fluorinated block. The
results of the study were also supported by combining tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) and liquid chromatography at critical conditions (LCCC). This combi￾nation of techniques provides a powerful tool for the detailed analysis of complex
polymers, such as PEtOx copolymers (Baumgaertel et al. 2011). LCCC was used in
combination with other liquid chromatographic techniques to characterize block
copolymers of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (2EHA) and methyl acrylate (MA) produced
using RAFT-mediated dispersion polymerization. SEC and HPLC are two different
analytical methods used to characterize polymers. These techniques use different
separation concepts and are used for various objectives. In the investigation of the
reaction products, it was observed that both SEC and HPLC techniques revealed
certain characteristics of the polymer samples. SEC analysis displayed a multimodal
molar-mass distribution, indicating the presence of different polymer sizes or
molecular weights within the sample. This could be attributed to the formation of
the predicted block copolymer, as well as the existence of surviving P2EHA and
PMA homopolymer fractions that were not fully reacted or incorporated into the
block copolymer structure. The multimodal distribution suggests the coexistence of
different polymer species with distinct molecular weights.
On the other hand, HPLC analysis provided insights into the chemical composi￾tion distribution of the polymer samples. It showed the presence of the predicted
block copolymer, which confirms the successful formation of the desired copolymer
structure. Additionally, the detection of the surviving P2EHA and PMA homopoly￾mer fractions indicated that the reaction did not go to completion, and some unre￾acted monomers remained in the mixture. This could be due to various factors such
as incomplete reaction kinetics, side reactions, or limitations in the reaction condi￾tions. The combination of SEC and HPLC analyses allowsfor a comprehensive char￾acterization of the polymer samples. SEC provides information about the molecular
weight and size distribution, while HPLC reveals the chemical composition distri￾bution. Together, these techniques enable a deeper understanding of the reaction
products, including the formation of the predicted block copolymer and the presence
of any unreacted homopolymer fractions. LCCC measurements were instrumental
in monitoring the concentration of unreacted macro-RAFT agent during the initial
hours of polymerization. Additionally, LCCC tests allowed for the determination of
the relative molar mass of the PMA blocks in the copolymers, providing valuable
information about the structural characteristics of the copolymersystem (Raust et al.
2010).21.4 Characterization of Functional Organic Polymer 473
21.4.1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
21.4.1.1 NMR-1H
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used to determine the proton envi￾ronment in the molecule. The molecule’s proton exhibits a distinct chemical shift d.
It is typically stated by frequency in parts per million (ppm). Based on the following
equation, it is calculated:
𝛿 = Δ𝜈 × 106
oscillator frequency (cps) (21.1)
where the oscillator frequency is a defining property of the instrument and is the
difference in frequencies of absorption between the sample and the reference in cps.
A combination of chemical shift information and spin–spin splitting, resulting from
proton–proton contact, can be used to identify chemical structures. In order to ana￾lyze stereochemistry of polymer and monomer sequencing, the NMR is helpful. The 1HNMR spectra of a wide variety of substances with known, relatively structures
have been measured in order to determine the chemical shifts of 1H-nuclei in varied
chemical environments. The chemical shifts for several popular forms of 1H nuclei
are provided in Table 21.1.

Currently, polymer scientists have access to very-high-resolution NMR tools
to learn more about the stereochemistry and monomer sequencing of polymers.
For instance, the potential configurations for each repeat unit in pure isotactic
poly(methyl methacrylate) are depicted in Figure 21.2. As illustrated in Figure 21.3,
500-MHz NMR analysis of a poly(methyl methacrylate) sample revealed that it is
primarily (95%) an isotactic isomer.

The sample’s methyl protons can be resolved to the pentad level and the methy￾lene protons to the hexad level. Annotations like erythro and threo are used to
denote the respective placements. Because of the ester group’s deshielding effect,
the erythro resonance of the methylene protons is farther downfield than that of
the ester groups. With the exception of the minuscule pentad at roughly about
1.16 ppm, the spectra at the minimal sensitivity (1×) are almost entirely that for an476 21 Functionalization and Characterization of Organic Polymers

purely isotactic behavior.

High resolution of proton-decoupled 13C spectra of polypropylene with changing
tactility isshown in Figure 21.4. Pentad sequences may once more be associated with
fine structure in the spectra. Crosspolarization, magic angle spinning, and proton
decoupling together produce solids spectra that are close to those obtained with
solutions in terms of resolution. As an illustration, the solid-state 13C-NMR spec￾trum of polycarbonate including the carbonyl and ring carbon resonances is shown
in Figure 21.5 presence and in absence of crosspolarization magic angle spinning.

structures and dynamics of various macromolecular species, NMR is a potent
spectrometric tool. It gives information on the polymers’ stability and degradability,
including their levels of acetylation, amination, and sulfonation (Mulijani et al.
2014; Nuñez and Hickner 2013; Parrondo et al. 2014; Sankir et al. 2004). Because
1H and 13C NMR are sensitive nuclei of the elements in organic materials, they
are the most often investigated nuclei by NMR. NMR has the ability to characterize
a broad range of functional groups that cannot be acquired by any other method,
in addition to providing absolute identification of certain isomers in simple mixes.
Quantitative data is obtained through NMR. The various functions present in
the sample, as well as their contents, can be identified by analyzing a 13C or 1H
spectrum. The structures of several functionalized poly(-caprolactone) copolymers,
including poly(-caprolactone-co-dimethyl vinylphosphonate) (P(MDOVPE)) and
poly(-caprolactone-co-vinylphosphonic acid) (P(MDOVPA)), were determined by
1H and 13C NMR in different study. In this study, two vinyl monomers, dimethyl
vinylphosphonate (VPE) and vinylphosphonic acid (VPA), are copolymerized
with MDO (2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane), through introduction of phosphonic acid
and dimethylphosphonate groups in order to create versatile polymeric inorganic
hybrid materials. Copolymers with a differing ester percentage or of functional
groups were synthesized when the feed ratio of the MDO co-monomers and the
vinyl monomer was changed accordingly. According to this study’s NMR findings,
hydrogen was transferred during copolymerization. The copolymers also developed478 21 Functionalization and Characterization of Organic Polymers
a branching ester structure. The NMR spectra of P(MDOVPE), which have a high
ester content, which have a high 1H and 13C NMR spectra, support this.
The distinctive methyl peaks coming from hydrogen transfer in the ester unit
(0.94 ppm, Figure 17.5a, 13.9 ppm, Figure 17.5b) were seen when these spectra were
contrasted with the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of P(MDO) (Jin and Gonsalves 1998).
The chemical makeup of the surfaces of the substrate in presence of and absence
of vapor-phase grafting of the most commonly used as biodegradable biomaterials,
poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), poly(lactideco-glycolide) (PLGA), poly(-caprolactone)
(PCL), and poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) was studied using FTIR analysis
with an ATR (attenuated total reflectance) probe. The findings are for the original
substrates, PLLA, PCL, and PLGA, respectively, and the characteristic ester CQO
bands are located at 1747, 1718, and 1746 cm−1, while PTMC exhibits a carbonate
CQO at 1734 cm−1. New peaks develop when VP is grafted covalently onto the
surfaces.
21.4.3 FTIR
The varied IR absorption of chemical bonds by polymers (vibrational transition) in
response to IR radiation produces the infrared spectra of polymers (Scheirs et al.
1991). The vibrational transition’s magnitude can be expressed by
𝜈 = 1
2πC
√
k
MxMy∕(Mx + My) (21.2)
where k (force constant) in dynes cm−1; single bond (=5 × 105 dynes cm−1), double
bond (=10 × 105 dynes cm−1), and triple bond (=15 × 105 dynes cm−1); m is the
stretching frequency in cm−1; Mx and My are the masses of two atoms involved
in stretching; C is the velocity of light, 2.998 × 1010 cm s−1; and the number of
waves cm−1 is used to measure infrared frequency, which is often represented in
wavenumber units.
Approximately 700–5000 cm−1 is the scanning range of common instruments.
This frequency range is associated with energies between 2 and 12 kcal mol−1. The
provided energy is more than enough to cause vibrations of bond (motions like
bond bending or stretching), but it is remarkably less than that would be necessary
to dissolve the bonds. Figure 21.6 provides an illustration of these actions.
Certain types of organic molecule bonds typically stretch within specific, very
small frequency ranges, which is highly helpful to ascertain the chemical struc￾ture of the molecule. The stretching frequency ranges for several bonds that are
frequently observed in organic compounds are provided in Table 21.2. Most often,
the distinctive IR absorption frequency of unknown polymers can be used to identify
their chemical structures. However, except they can be compared to experimental
data or from the data of IR spectra of their respective monomers, it is impossible to
determine their precise chemicalstructures only from IR spectra. The p-substituting
linkage between the aromatic structure of monomers and the repeating unit model
is where the IR spectra of polyimide and its repeating unit compound differ.21.4 Characterization of Functional Organic Polymer 479

21.4.4 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman is derived from molecular vibrational transitions, just like IR spectroscopy.
Light is dispersed when visible light strikes molecules. The various modes of vibra￾tion in the scattering molecules affect the frequency of the light that is scattered.480 21 Functionalization and Characterization of Organic Polymers
The Raman effect is used to describe this. Raman effect reacts to the symmetric
modes of vibration, whereas IR spectra reveal un-symmetric bond stretching and
bending modes of vibration. A molecule’s polar groups produce the strongest IR sig￾nals, whereas its nonpolar groups produce the strongest Raman signals.
As a result, IR and Raman spectroscopy complement one another. The interpre￾tation of structural information is enhanced when the same compound’s paired IR
and Raman spectra are used (Kuptsov and Zhizhin 1998).
In case of C—C bonds, symmetrical stretching is what makes Raman most sen￾sitive. By contrasting the spectra of polymer chains with those of bulky-chained
“model” alkanes, it is possible to investigate the structure of conformation in poly￾mer chains. Raman may be used to analyze polymer deformations, sulfur crosslinks
in rubber, and cis–trans isomerism in elastomers since stereoisomers of polymers
are created by rotation around single bonds (Figure 21.7).
Raman spectra is particularly useful in conformational investigations of sev￾eral biopolymers in an aqueous medium since Raman scattering by water is
low in comparison to water’s high IR absorption. The comparison of trans-poly
pentenamer’s IR and Raman is shown in Figure 21.8. Caused by the sym￾metrical structure of alkane (–C–C– at 2900 cm−1) and alkene (–C=C– at
3000 cm−1), the Raman exhibits more features than the IR. Figure 21.9 com￾pares the poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HTIR)’s and Raman spectra. While C–H
stretching prevalent in the IR band spectra, symmetrical C–C stretching domi￾nates the Raman spectrum. According to Figure 21.10, the Grignard metathesis
reaction produces P3HT (as shown in Figure 21.13). The yield might exceed
70%.

21.4.5 UV-Visible Spectroscopy
When matter undergoes the n→π* and π→ π* transition upon light irradiation,
UV-Vis (ultraviolet-visible) spectroscopy (Dyer 1978) is used to discover the
chromophores qualitatively as well as quantitatively. It has proved helpful in
finding contaminants in polymers, similar to residual monomer, antioxidants,
inhibitors, and so on, because to its sensitivity (10-5 mol). For instance, the styrene
at 𝜆max = 292 nm can be used to quantitatively measure the amount of styrene482 21 Functionalization and Characterization of Organic Polymers

vanishes and is replaced by the 𝜆max of benzene for polymer at 203 and 254 nm.
A typical organic compounds UV absorption spectrum is shown in Figure 21.14.
Contrary to infrared spectra (IR), UV-Vis spectra are considerably broader and
typically only exhibit a few peaks. The wavelengths of the maxima are reported
as the peaks. The conjugated, and unsaturated ketone spectrum is depicted in
Figure 21.14 absorbs strongly at 𝜆max = 232 nm and just little at 𝜆max = 330 nm.
While the longer wavelength, weaker intensity band corresponds to a transition
of the nonbonding electrons on the carbonyl oxygen atom, the shorter wavelength
band correlates to a transition of the π* electrons.
A quantitative expression for an absorption band’s intensity is possible. The
specific chemical structure of the band and the quantity of absorbing molecules in
the path of light both affect band intensity. Beer’s law provides the following as an
example of absorbance, which is described as the log of the ratio of light intensities
entering as well as leaving the sample.
A = 𝜀 c l (21.3)21.4 Characterization of Functional Organic Polymer 483
Molar absorptivity location (sometimes called the extinction coefficient), l is the
length in centimeters, and c is the concentration of the solution in moles per liter.
Any peak’s value in a compound’s spectrum is a property (constant) of that specific
chemicalstructure. As an instance, the peak valuesfor the given unsaturated ketone
in Figure 21.11 spectra are 𝜆max = 233 nm (𝜀 = 12,600) and 𝜆max = 331 nm (𝜀 = 78).
The effect of the conjugate length on the wavelength and extinction coefficient is
presented in Figure 21.15.
The mostfrequent method for detecting conjugation uses UV-Visspectra.In exten￾sive, molecules with one double bond or none does not absorb in the UV to visi￾ble spectrum (∼200–800 nm). However, the conjugated systems absorb here, and as
shown in Figure 21.12, the longer the wavelength of maximum absorption, higher
the conjugation.

crucial because chemical structure has a major impact on the physical properties
of polymeric materials. To assess the functionalized biopolymer’s potential for
biomedical applications, it is also required to assess its temperature resistance
in detail. For instance, the thermal characteristics of polymeric materials used
in restorative applications are crucial because they may expand or contract in
response to temperature changes, which may affect their suitability for a particular
application (such as a prosthetic) (Flores-Ramírez et al. 2005). It could be thought
of as a collection of methods that analyze a sample’s physical characteristics in
relation to its temperature profile. Thermal characterization is mostly used to
ascertain the temperature at which polymer melting, crystallization, and glass
transition (Tg) occur in biomedical applications (Parthasarathy and Sethuraman21.4 Characterization of Functional Organic Polymer 485
2014). Widely used thermal analysis instruments for the characterization of
functionalized polymers are differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal
gravimetric analysis (TGA). In DSC, the sample is susceptible to a managed
temperature programme in order to determine the quantity of energy absorbed
and released, but in TGA, the loss of mass is measured instead of raising the
sample’s temperature. The application of DSC and TGA techniques, as well as
how to interpret the findings, are shown in the examples below. In order to study
the thermal characteristics of copolymers with varying functional pendant groups
produced by the ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide (L-LA) and RS-b-benzyl
malate, Zhang and Ruckenstein (1998) utilized DSC analysis (MA). They also
investigated how the thermal characteristics of the copolymers were affected by
hydrogenolysis, which removes the benzyl groups. The findings of the DSC study
(Figure 21.16a) demonstrated that the copolymers’ crystallinity reduced as the
MA concentration rose. As the MA concentration rose, so did the copolymers’ Endo Exo

crystal-melting temperature (Tm) and glass transition temperature (Tg). However,
all of the deprotected (hydrogenolyzed) copolymers had Tg values that were larger
than the comparable protected copolymers (Figure 21.16b). This was explained
by the intermolecular hydrogen connections that developed between the pendant
carboxyl groups (Zhang and Ruckenstein 1998). Thermal analysis techniques were
used in the study by Flores-Ramírez et al. (2005) to analyze the functionalization of
(CTS)/GMA material at two sharp stoichiometric molar ratios, 1 : 1 and 1 : 4. These
hybrid composite functionalized materials are softer than the precursor material
at room temperature, according to DSC analysis of CTS/GMA, which reveals that
Tg in both of the functionalized polymers is lower than the value observed for
pure CTS. Results from TGA show that as functionalization increases, degradation
temperatures likewise fall (Flores-Ramírez et al. 2005).
21.4.7 Mechanical Testing and Rheometric Analysis
Mechanical characteristics of polymeric biomaterials may have an impact on their
biocompatibility (Mamaghani et al. 2018). Tensile testing can be used to assess the
most crucial mechanical properties for biomedical applications, such as tensile
strength, compressive strength, and elastic or Young’s modulus. The impact of
these characteristics will vary depending on how biomaterials are used. Rheometry,
which measures viscosity and storage modulus, can be used to assessthe viscoelastic
behavior and rheological characteristics of polymeric biomaterial.
The degree of polymerization, polymer structure, crosslinking, and functional￾ity are all aspects of polymeric materials that affect their mechanical properties.
Examples are given here to show how functionalizing polymers affect their rheo￾logical and mechanical properties. It was investigated (Cai et al. 2016) how func￾tionalizing nanofillers with their hyperbranched polyglycerol (PG) improved the
mechanical properties of composite nanofibers.In the presentstudy, poly(vinyl alco￾hol) (PVA) was chosen as the model polymer matrix and nanodiamonds (ND) were
used as the nanofillers. By using the electrospinning technique, various unmodified
ND/PVA and PG-modified ND/PVA composite nanofibers are created, and tensile
tests were used to assess their mechanical characteristics. The mechanical proper￾ties of membranes of ND/PVA composite nanofiber were improved by the grafting
of PG on the ND surface, as evidenced by a 60% increased tensile strength, a 51%
increase in Young’s modulus, and a 59% increase in toughness at a 3 weight percent
filler content.Interactions with matrix (Nie et al. 2007).In anotherstudy (Baumgaer￾tel et al. 2011), crosslinking maleimide-functionalized of high-molecular-mass hep￾arin (HMWH) with thiolderivatized PEGs of diverse molecular weights and polymer
structures were used to analyze the gelation time and elasticity of the synthesized
hydrogels. The findings of this work demonstrate that the generation of hydrogels
and their rheological properties was significantly influenced by the alteration of car￾boxylates in HMWH with various maleimide groups and with thiol derivatization
of PEG crosslinker. Elastic moduli (G′
) in hydrogels were measurable impacts of
variations in HMWH functioning, as expected.References 487

22.1 Introduction
Polymer materials are of great use in our daily life for various applications. Among
all others, polymeric materials as adhesives have been in demand due to their broad
range of applicability. Adhesives are a class of essential materialsthat bind similar or
different kinds of items in strong and mostly permanent manners. Most of the adhe￾sives used in daily life need some specific pressure to be applied for binding two
surfaces and hence are also known as pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs). Tapes,
labels, and protective films can also be classified into the class of bonds. Undoubt￾edly, adhesives are among the primary areas of research in the current era. They
are non-metallic, polymeric substances applied to one of the sides of substances to
be bound. They are more advantageous than the other contemporary binding tech￾niques, such as sewing, welding, and fastenings. They are engineered such that they
can perform instant operations, like veneering, jointing, or edge-banding oils, and
plastic films. The adhesives themselves undergo a metamorphosis in the course of
their matchmaking for binding substrates. When applied to the binding materials,
they must be fluidic in nature, so that they can spread rapidly, to achieve molecular
contact. However, on bringing the two substrates together with adhesive, the adhe￾sives must become hard and develop the required strength so that the bonded com￾posite resists disruption. The adhesive is among the fastest-growing sectors in the
world, leading to a highly competitive market. Adhesives render services in design￾ing items, which range from decoratives to automobiles, textiles, electronics, and
space industries (Miller et al. 2013; Barnes and Pashby 2000; Zhang et al. 2008). In
fact, adhesives, both natural and synthetic, are among the many industrial sources
that help in the economic growth of a nation. Natural adhesives are eco-friendly and

less toxic, which might not always be the perfect material of choice, while synthetic
adhesives are designed in the laboratory to fulfill ourrequirements. Among the natu￾ral organic polymers, adhesives are formed by using starch, animal glue, casein, and
rubber, in water or organic solvents. Even the crosslinking of adhesives has ancient
beginnings – the egg albumin coagulation and the drying of blood by heat or light,
the treatment of lime and casein. The earliest human use of adhesives could be esti￾mated at approximately about 200,000 years ago for binding wooden handles and
stone tools, using tar produced by the dry distillation of birch bark (Wadley 2010).
During the early ages, adhesives formulations were derived from eggshells, plant
extracts, lime, etc. for construction, design of hunting tools, and crafts. The first plant
used to obtain animal glue for commercial purposes was produced at the end of the
1600s, and the since then adhesives have been in use for decorative purposes and
joint production (Tout 2000).
Nails and pegs were employed initially to join two substrates, initially. However,
in the nineteenth century, with the enhancement in the quality of animal glue
furniture makers started to depend solely on the glue bonds’ strength to ensure
joint security. The commercially known glue was developed in 1690 initially in
Holland; the casein glue, during the early nineteenth century, was manufactured
in Switzerland (Mittal and Pizzi 2003; Delmonte 1947). The first patent on glue
was issued in Britain in 1750, which reported an adhesive made from fish. The
first US patent (No. 183,024) for glue was published in 1876. Synthetic adhesives
have been in focus since the mid-1900s. In recent years, the adhesive synthesis
is performed using different polymers, like acrylates, epoxy, polyurethanes, and
cyanoacrylates (Tenorio-Alfonso et al. 2020; Jin et al. 2015; Maurya et al. 2018; Raja
2016). Polymerization processes, such as hot melt synthesis, emulsion technique,
radiation curing, and solution-phase synthesis, are employed to obtain adhesives.
Research has been in progress around the globe to formulate efficient adhesives
to meet the growing demands. In addition, continuous efforts have been made
around the globe to formulate adhesives that could contribute toward the future
energy demand, along with safeguarding the environment. This chapter focuses
on the various aspects of adhesives, including their applications in energy and
the environment and their prospects. The past and ongoing research and the
market scenario have also been presented in this chapter. The detailed study of
adhesives will undoubtedly lead to advancements in the research and progress in
adhesives/glues and sealants.
22.2 History and Developments
Adhesives could be estimated to be discovered in the Pleistocene era around
200,000 years back, obtained from the tar obtained from birch bark. The Africans
used glue obtained from tree sap to protect their caves around 75,000 BC. Adhesives
obtained from natural sources were utilized by people to preserve the native
culture and craft tools, weapons, and much more since prehistoric times. The
earliest known adhesive applications date back to 6000 years ago, applied for22.2 History and Developments 493
designing decoration materials. Archaeological investigations have also revealed
the use of adhesives in the Babylonian temples dating to approximately 4000 BC
(Chattopadhyay 2014). Glue became commonplace across central and southern
Europe with the rise of the Greek and Roman empires, when glues were being
used for small daily jobs to massive building constructions that have survived to
this day. Adhesives were used to create laminated woodwork some 3500 years ago,
while they were also used to design the tombs of Egyptian Pharaohs 2500 years ago;
the adhesives used were obtained from animal products, which used extracts from
bones, skins, blood, and brain. The first reference to adhesives in literature has
been traced to approximately 2000 BC; to design artifacts, which include paintings
by wood gluing and caskets using animal glue. The design of bows, arrows, and
furniture using casein-based glues was much favored in ancient times. Wood
marquetry and veneering were developed, followed by the production of animal
and fish glues by the Romans from AD 1 to 500. Egg-based pastes were used via
the incorporation of natural ingredients, which include milk, vegetables, bones,
cheese, blood, and grains to bond materials. Over time, slaked lime was utilized by
the Greeks as mortar, while the Romans mixed sand and volcanic ash with lime,
thus further extending the mortar development. Romans are known to be the first
ones who used beeswax and tar as sealants for wood to be used in boats and ships
(Muhammad et al. 2019). On the other hand, the Mongols in 1100 AD constructed
bows using a new adhesive with laminated lemonwood and bullhorn. Interestingly,
the great Ahoms in 1200–1400 AD used duck-egg shells and yolk, rice husk, Bora
chaul (a special rice variety), and black gram to construct monuments, temples,
and war tunnels, which are still prominent tourist spots in the various locations of
Assam, India (Verma et al. 2014).
In Europe, adhesive use started and subsequently in growth during the period
from AD 1500 to 1700. Thomas Chippendale and Duncan Phyfe, the two renowned
furniture makers, began to use adhesives to bind their products during this period.
With human civilization development, the first-ever adhesive industry was started
in Holland in 1690, termed Horse glue, which became extensively popular (Ander￾son 1990). Old horses were disposed to the glue factories to produce the materials.
The horse glue continued to be used for a more extended period, with different vari￾ations. In 1750, the first British patent was granted on an adhesive that was obtained
from fish. In the following year, casein glue production was started in Germany and
Switzerland.In 1808, the first animal glue factory wassetstarted in the United States.
In 1845, the natural-rubber-based adhesive was developed by Henry Day, which was
later used widely for surgical tapes. In 1847, the first postal stamp was designed,
which required the use of glue.In 1876, the Ross brothersreceived the first US patent
for developing casein glue.
Rubber cement, cellulose nitrate dopes, laminating veneers, and waterproof
adhesives were other prominent developments in the nineteenth century. By 1825,
the PSA tap industry started, which is found in various forms in today’s world, such
as sticky notes, scotch tapes, and fluorescent tapes. The invention of thermosetting
plastics called Bakelite in 1910 was a crucial step in the development of adhesives
(Jewkes et al. 1969). Bakelite-resins-based adhesives were used in plywood as494 22 Organic Polymers for Adhesive Applications: History, Progress, and the Future
coatings. Today, plywood bonding by phenol-formaldehyde resins is the most exten￾sive for adhesive material end-product use. The phenolic resin is cost-effective, and
when applied on the plywood material does not delaminate in the hot dampness of
June–August. The importance of these resins was severely realized in the late 1930s.
Since 1930, urea-formaldehyde resins started to be significantly used as adhesives,
which are still being widely used as bindersin particleboard, and utilized in flooring
and furnishing (Rozelsky 2021). The adhesives sector’s growth reached a great
height with the First and the Second World Wars from the 1920s to 1940s. With the
advancements of civilizations, a substitute for animal-based glue was felt necessary.
America’s leading food and beverages company, Borden, made Elmer’s all-glue in
1932, which used animal products in the formulations, with many restrictions and
precautions. Many countries framed some laws restricting the use of animals for
adhesives. In 1947, the first polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based glue reported was made
of milk protein. The synthetic adhesive composed of PVA was found to be more
effective for multi-purpose applications. In 2003, Borden was acquired by Berwind
Corporation, which started producing Elmer’s all-glue by using PVA, which did not
involve the use of animal products. With the growing interest in nanotechnology,
many adhesive formulations were made, with much improved adhesive efficiency.
For example, Gecko-tape, a nanomaterial-based adhesive tape, was 1000 times more
effective than regular adhesive tapes, with no harmful materials up to cellularlevels.
With further advancements in research, many adhesives have been synthesized,
which are presently available in the markets. Different adhesives are known today
as per the usage and requirements, such as acrylic, polyurethanes, epoxy, and
PVA-based adhesives.
22.3 Classifications of Adhesives
Several methods are known according to which adhesives can be classified. Several
aspects are considered for the classifications of adhesives. Among all, the major cat￾egory is structural and non-structural adhesive classification. Structural adhesives
provide crucialservicesfor daily life utility; they provide shearstrength of more than
6900 kPa and have stable properties that do not alter with aging. Non-structural
adhesives are mostly used as packaging adhesives, pressure-sensitive tapes, or
hot melts. Their shear strength is less than 6900 kPa, and they are durable under
relatively mild environment (Petrie 2007). These adhesives are chemically com￾posed of polyurethanes, resorcinol, phenols, melamine, epoxy, urea-formaldehyde,
acrylates, and polyimides. Non-structural adhesives are chemically composed of
butyl/styrene-butadiene rubbers, polyesters, polyvinyl acetate, silicones, acrylics,
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, cellulosic resins, polyolefins, and naturally
polymers. Considering the chemical/physical behavior, adhesives are categorized
as thermosetting, thermoplastic, elastomeric, or hybrids. Thermosetting adhesives
are crosslinked structures that do not soften in the presence of solvents or heat.
Thermoplastic glues are not crosslinked; they turn to a gel-like state on heating.
Elastomeric adhesives shows low tensile strength and high elongation usually22.3 Classifications of Adhesives 495
and are formulated via natural or synthetic rubbers. Hybrid adhesives are com￾pounds formed via polymeric mixtures, with specific property adjustments, as
required.
Another route to classify adhesives involves application and subsequent curing
methods. Several steps are involved during the process of adhesion: application,
wetting, and setting. The setting up of adhesive proceeds in numerous ways, such
as by cooling, the release of solvent/carrier, or via in situ polymerization reaction
(Jovanovic´ and Dubé 2004).
Below are the classifications of adhesives, discussed briefly.
22.3.1 Based on the Origins
22.3.1.1 Natural Adhesives
As the name suggests, adhesives are obtained from natural sources, viz. vegetable
starch, natural resins, or animal sources. These adhesives are also commonly
referred to as bio-adhesives. Common examples found in daily life include cooking
flour paste in water, boiled rice paste, and plant resins.
Starch-based adhesives, albumen, casein glue, lignin, etc. can be categorized
under this class. Starch-derived glues are used in production of paper sack, wall￾paper adhesives, and paper tube winding. Albumen finds application commonly
in the ply industry and is composed of the blood–protein component. Casein
glue is primarily applied to bind labels of glass bottles. Animal glues were used
traditionally in book-binding, wood joining, and several other fields; however,
synthetic glues have largely replaced them. In certain specific applications, such as
stringed instruments (production and repair), animal glues are still prominently
used.
22.3.1.2 Synthetic Adhesives
The adhesivessynthesized in the laboratory by using different organic precursors are
known as synthetic adhesives. Naturally produced adhesives were extensively used
until, in the 1920s, the first synthetic adhesive was produced by Karlsons Klister.
There are different types of synthetic adhesives, based on the precursors used. Com￾mon types of synthetic adhesives are epoxy, polyurethanes, acrylic, cyanoacrylate,
and polyvinyl-acetate-based adhesives.
Epoxy-based adhesives are highly used for binding different substances, like poly￾meric composites, metals, and concrete structures. They form highly crosslinked
adhesive materials with numerous advantages such as various curing techniques,
low shrinkage during the curing process, high resistance to corrosion, good mechan￾ical strength, and excellent chemical/thermal resistance. The good wettability of
these adhesives provides an excellent joint for most substrates. In addition, epoxy
can be easily conjugated with nanomaterials, thus enhancing the characteristics of
the adhesives. Thus, epoxy-based adhesives are among the most used materials for
multiple purposes (Ahmadi 2019).496 22 Organic Polymers for Adhesive Applications: History, Progress, and the Future
Due to the polar urethane group in polyurethane, the polyurethane-based adhe￾sives form strong adhesion to different substrates. They are obtained by reacting
isocyanates with different polyols, leading to chemically hardened adhesive formu￾lations, due to the availability of reactive terminal groups.
Acrylic-based adhesives have been a topic of discussion in recent times. Copoly￾mers of acrylic acids have been an essential aspect of many researchers around
the globe. Due to their ability to cross-link extensively, acrylic-based adhesives
are widely applicable in applications like drug delivery, wound dressing, and
environment safety. One of the trending fields of interest in acrylic-based polymers
is the development of adhesives. In coatings and furnishing, they are considered
the most suitable adhesives due to their durability, cure speed, strength, and low
toxicity (Smeets 2013). Other major sectors in which acrylic-based adhesives are
widely are construction, dentistry, engineering, and textiles.
Cyanoacrylate or Superglue, also called Krazy Glue, was discovered by Dr. Harry
Coover in 1942, although it was later rejected by Coover as it was too sticky. In 1951,
Coover, while supervising research at the Eastman Company with Dr. Fred Joyner,
rediscovered cyanoacrylate.Coover discovered that cyanoacrylate was a useful mate￾rial to glue together the prisms and finally in 1958, the Eastman compound was
marketed, which later was packaged as Superglue (Baig 2009).
Polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) is formed by the polymerization of vinyl monomers and
is most widely used as an emulsion. The emulsion is the familiar “white glue” used
for household purposes. The PVAc adhesive hasreplaced natural casein-made adhe￾sives due to its low cost and ability to resist the attack by microorganisms. Thus
PVAc-derived adhesives are used in multiple fields, for example, in the manufac￾ture of furniture. Due to the easy diffusion of water into the wood, the adhesive
gets set easily on the substrate and the setting times are much more rapid at room
temperature.
22.3.2 Based on the Dispersion Medium
Based on the dispersion medium, adhesives can be mainly categorized into two
classes: solvent-borne and water-borne adhesives. A medium of dispersion in the
form of a solvent is always necessary for the gelation of the polymeric resins to form
adhesives. Sometimes the water is used as the dispersion medium to form the adhe￾sive gel; in this case, the glue may be termed water-borne adhesive. On the other
hand, in some adhesives, organic solvents are used as a medium of dispersion forthe
formation of adhesives. Such a category of adhesives may be termed solvent-borne
adhesives.
Solvent-based adhesives might be toxic to an extent due to the release of volatile
solvents utilized in adhesives. But at the same time, they provide a wide range of
utilities for different binding types of materials. For PSAs, solvent-borne adhesives
are often ideal, as they take much shorter curing time compared to water-borne
adhesives. On the other hand, water-borne adhesives are most desirable for binding
cellulose-based materials, like wood, paper, ply, and thermocols, which can easily
absorb excess water.22.5 Adhesive Efficiency and Strength Test 497
22.4 Adhesive Characterization Techniques
Adhesives can be characterized using various spectroscopic and analytical tech￾niques. Adhesives are polymeric resins, so the characterization techniques for the
adhesives are those involved in the characterization of polymers, with few additions
(Hon 2003).
Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy: Structural elucidation of adhe￾sives is started with FT-IR analysis. FT-IR spectra determine the presence of dif￾ferent functional groups in the polymeric framework of an adhesive.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis: NMR is a critical tool to analyze the
structure of a synthetic polymeric adhesive. The linkage of C-C bonds and the
environment of the hydrogens present can be studied by the 13C and 1H NMR,
respectively. The type and functionality of an adhesive largely depend on itsstruc￾tural framework, which can be studied with the help of NMR spectroscopy.
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC): GPC is an important technique to determine
the total molecular mass of a polymeric material. The polydispersity index (PDI)
is also calculated by GPC. The total molecular mass and PDI determine the nature
of the adhesive and the overall chain linkage.
X-ray diffraction (XRD): XRD helps us to determine the crystalline and/or amor￾phous characteristics of an adhesive. The overall type of bonding can be analyzed
by determining the miller planes of the adhesives. Interestingly, the analysis of
XRD also gives an idea of the extent of crosslinking in a resin.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC): DSC is an important characterization
technique for the analysis of adhesives. The properties of adhesives are largely
dependent on the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the melting and crys￾talline temperature. With the help of DSC, we can find the Tg, which helps us
analyze the type and utility of a glue. The range of stability and utility can also be
analyzed via DSC.
Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA): TGA is an analytical technique that helps us to
determine thermal stability with respect to the weight of a polymer or resin. The
analysis of the thermal stability of an adhesive helps us to predict the range up to
which an adhesive can be conveniently used. The more the thermal stability of an
adhesive, the more it can withstand the bonding.
Viscosity: The viscosity is a fluid’s resistance to flow. An adhesive is a gel-like poly￾meric resin and hence has lesser fluidity. Viscosity is an important characteristic
for the analysis of an adhesive. The more viscous an adhesive is, the less time
and temperature are required for curing. Viscometer and/or rheometer are used
to determine the viscosity of the glue.
22.5 Adhesive Efficiency and Strength Test
The utmost essential characteristic of an adhesive isthe test forthe adhesive strength
or the tensile strength, which is defined as the total force required per unit cm2498 22 Organic Polymers for Adhesive Applications: History, Progress, and the Future
to detach the adhesive joint applied for the binding material. The force applied is
always perpendicular to the substrate. The lap shear strength, also known as the
tensile strength or adhesive strength, determines the scope of utility of an adhe￾sive, starting from decorative to buildings. The adhesive strength measurements are
based on some set of rules, as laid down by the American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) (ASTM 1958). For every specific material, a different set of rules
and measurements have been designated as per the ASTM to determine the adhe￾sive strength. All the adhesive strength test methods, as per the ASTM standard, are
explained briefly in Table 22.1.
22.5.1 Specimen Failures During Adhesive Strength Tests
Sometimes the samples undergo breakdown during the process of the adhesive
strength test. There are two types of failures that may take place in PSAs, viz.
adhesive failure and cohesive failure. The failure occurs at the interface of the
substrate and the adhesive. On the other hand, cohesive failure takes place within
the center of the adhesive. Both failures depend on the viscoelastic characteristics
of PSAs. Certain chemical compounds, known as tackifiers, are used to formulate
adhesives that can specifically increase the stickiness and the tack of the surface
of the adhesive. Tackifiers are generally aliphatic cyclo-aliphatic or aromatic
resins, hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins, terpenes and modified terpenes, and
terpene-phenol resins.
22.6 Applications of Adhesives
Adhesives are majorly used materials in different applications, starting from minor
household daily use to industrial and medicines. Apart from their role in adhesion,
adhesives are also used for multiple other applications, such as sealing agents, to
nullify the effect of self-loosening due to dynamic loads, to seal certain parts to pre￾vent oxidation and corrosion, waterproofing, etc. Adhesives as sealants can also be
applied as electrical or thermal insulators, barriers to fire, and also as products for
smoothing, filleting, etc. The adhesives and sealants are mainly used to bond sub￾strates such as plastics (thermosets and thermoplastics), wood and wood products,
composites, metals, glass and ceramics, elastomers, and sandwich and honeycomb
structures. Two majorsectors where adhesives are widely used are the industrialsec￾tor and pharmaceuticals and biomedicines, although the application of adhesives is
not limited. The various applications of adhesives are depicted in Figure 22.1.

22.6.2 Application of Adhesives in Medical and Pharmaceuticals
The pressure-sensitive adhesives initially used to develop bandage materials were
composed of natural rubber. With further development, synthetic rubber, and, poly￾acrylic acid ester-derived adhesives have also been significantly used nowadays. A
variety of adhesives are used as medical dressings/tapes/devices for wound healing,
orforsupporting an injured portion of the body. Advanced adhesives are widely used
in various biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, which have been reviewed
in detail by Webster (1997). Adhesives are an integral part of multiple medical pro￾cedures, such as medical apparatus/devices: to treat and restore dental filings, anes￾thetic administration, intravenous delivery of drugs, bypasssurgery of the heart, and
complex surgeries, like urological plastic surgery. Below are the common uses of
adhesives for medicinal purposes.
1) Bioadhesives for drug-delivery applications are emerging systems for deliv￾ering various important biomedical substances, ranging from popular ones
to probiotics, proteins, and herbal medicines. The drug-delivery systems may
exist as solids, semisolids, and/or liquids in the common formulations or as
nanoparticle-based systems designated for different routes such as oral, nasal,
ocular, vaginal, skin, and esophageal routes (Brahmbhatt 2017).
2) Apart from their use as adhesives, bioadhesive polymers are also known to per￾form other pharmaceutical activities, such as disintegrant, diluent, and enhance
viscosity. Their nature, quantity, and association with other excipients highly
influence the final drug product quality.
3) Bioadhesive polymers are suitable for drug-delivery systems, and to design of
medical devices. Transdermal patch technology is an emerging field of biomedi￾cal adhesives, which ensure drug administration to the bloodstream via the skin;
it is a highly efficient process of drug delivery, in which the incorporation of the
drug takes place into an adhesive membrane that binds the patch to the skin and
controls the rate of absorption of the drug. The systems are designed to ensure504 22 Organic Polymers for Adhesive Applications: History, Progress, and the Future

continuous administration of drugsthroughout the day, and thus avoid any alter￾ations in plasmatic concentration, generally linked with oral administration of
drugs (Padula et al. 2007).
4) Surgical adhesives are conveniently used methods for wound dressing that have
multiple advantages, such as minimum pain, no removal of suture material, and
localized release of drugs. Tissue adhesives are those classes of materials with
properties that allow adherence of tissues with other tissue/non-tissue surfaces
via in situ polymerization. They may be applied for various functions, such as
prostheses, and bleeding control (hemostats), and also act as a barrier to liq￾uids and gas (sealants). Over the past 30–40 years, various tissue adhesives and
hemostats have been developed, and the work is still in progress (Duarte et al.
2012).
5) Dental adhesives are designed to help in the retention of composite fillings and
are defined as monomers resin (having hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic enti￾ties) that enable the interaction between the resin and dental substrate. A few of
them are also applied to provide protective against enamel erosion. Most often,
inadequate sealing may lead to the failure of restorations. The recently devel￾oped dental adhesives have dramatically simplified the application procedure,
as compared to classical multistep bonding methods, thus minimizing the tech￾nique sensitivity and application/healing time. Recently, fluorescent adhesives
have been found to do wonders for dental care, owing to the easy visualization of
tooth decay and tooth protection under UV light (Milia et al. 2012).
The most common applications of adhesives in medical fields are depicted in
Figure 22.2.

a simple household material, glue will continuously be considered essential for the
sustained development of the world. The current market size of global adhesives
and sealants is around USD 67.5 billion in 2022 and with the expected compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9%, this value is estimated to reach 107.27 by 2030,
due to the increasing demand from various sectors, such as packaging, furniture
construction, and footwear.
The adhesives are of different types, which find their applications in wide areas,
as depicted in Figure 22.3.
The paper and packaging industry has been found to be the largest segment of the
adhesive market, having a revenue share of more than 29%. Another major sector
occupying the adhesive market is building/construction, which has been increasing
in the last few years, due to architectural and technological innovations (20%).
Consumer and DIY products also include a large share of the adhesive market
(14%). Other important sectors contributing to the growth of the adhesive market
are footwear industries, transportation, medical, etc.
22.8 Advanced Adhesive Formulations for Environment
Sustainability and Applications in the Energy Sector
Adhesives are one of the most important classes of materials, which are an essen￾tial part of many industries. Every sector, including the energy and environment
sectors, directly or indirectly are affected by the adhesives and their market share.
With further enhancements in research and development, the next decade will cer￾tainly see higher growth in the application of adhesivesin energy and environmental
applications.
22.8.1 Use of Organic Adhesives for Environment Sustainability
Environment safety and sustainability have been major concerns for all researchers
around the globe. Biodegradable polymers have been considered important replace￾ments to traditional plastics and polythenes for every sector (Upadhyaya and Sen506 22 Organic Polymers for Adhesive Applications: History, Progress, and the Future

Sarma 2022). Continuous use of synthetic adhesives can have negative impacts on
both humans and the environment. Various regulations have been set up by the
competent authorities for the development of sustainable environment-friendly
adhesives and packaging materials. Efforts are being made to develop eco-friendly
adhesives, without compromising the strength. Considering environmental safety,
a considerable decrease in the use of solvent-based adhesives has been observed
in recent times, to minimize the effect of volatile solvents. The most suitable way
to preserve the environment from the toxic effects of organic adhesives is to use
suitable biopolymer-derived organic adhesives, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates
(PHAs), bio-epoxy resins, and bio-acrylates (Packham 2009). The various aspects
through which environmentally sustainable adhesives can be obtained are depicted
in Figure 22.4.
To obtain adhesives of desired characteristics, without compromising on envi￾ronmental safety, various research groups have made numerous efforts. Few
successful adhesives have been derived from bio-compatible sources, thus safe￾guarding the environment. Among all the bio-derived adhesives, starch-based
biocompatible polymers have been known for their utility as eco-friendly adhesives
for a safe environment. The starch-based eco-friendly polymers are found to be
renewable, non-toxic, and low-solvent emitting, and thus could help safeguard
the environment (Maulana et al. 2022). Further, the use of starch-modified
polymer composites is also known for their application in environment-friendly,
water-resistant, bio-compatible adhesives (Watcharakitti et al. 2022). Thus, starch
can be used as a substitute for harsh chemicals for adhesive development. In addi￾tion, milk-protein-derived polymers are also used to derive environment-friendly
adhesives. Caseins and whey are known to be important milk proteins, which
according to the reports can be potentially used as precursors to eco-friendly adhe￾sives. The polymerization of the milk protein is an important aspect, which leads to
the formation of aggregates to be used as adhesives (Guo and Wang 2016). Another
work by Bhakare et al. reports the development of Arjuna-bark derived reusable
composite for dual applications: as an adhesive and also as a flame retardant, as
a substitute to traditional halogen-based flame retardants (Bhakare et al. 2023).22.8 Advanced Adhesive Formulations for Environment Sustainability and Applications 507
Thus, with progress in research, special focus has been given to green methods of
adhesive development for the protection of the environment.
Interestingly, certain recently invented adhesives have been found to be used for
the separation of waste from the environment. A recent interesting report by Rieland
et al. presents the use of organic pressure-sensitive adhesives for the quantification
of microplastics and their isolation from water bodies, thus helping in the environ￾mental remediation process (Rieland et al. 2023). Other notable works related to the
applications of environment-friendly adhesives include the following:
Applications of silk-fibroin/tannic-acid-based adhesive for underwater use (Kim
et al. 2023), water-borne powder adhesive with additional applications in crafts and
anti-counterfeiting (Upadhyaya et al. 2020), bio-inspired adhesives for environment
safety and next-gen bone repair (Shokri et al. 2022), real-time deployable, high
strength adhesive for application in harsh environment (Cui et al. 2022), etc.
22.8.2 Applications of Organic Adhesives in the Energy Sector
With the development of a wide variety of adhesives, due to the growing demand,
adhesives have also been recently known to be used in energy sectors,specifically for
energy conservation. Although at the very initial stage now, researchers have been
going on to utilize the adhesives, with the viewpoint of energy conservation.
Epoxy adhesives have been in use for large wind turbine blades to obtain maxi￾mum output from a windmill, with minimum energy requirement. The major role
of epoxy adhesives is to fabricate rotor blades, to meet the required mechanical
strength, and to increase the manufacturing speed (Thomas and Ramachandra
2018). Certain bio-compatible adhesives are also used against biofouling, for
environmental remediation (Vinagre et al. 2020). Considering the aspect of energy
minimization, apart from cost and environmental balance, the use of adhesives with
high strength is being considered as a technical alternative to welding, riveting,
soldering, etc. (Wegner 2010). In addition, emerging techniques are being used,
for curing the adhesives applied in electronics packaging. Controlled microwave
frequency can be used in this method, to reduce the time frame of curing (Fathi
et al. 1996). Recently, biomimetic adhesives have been in use for multiple appli￾cations, apart from the bonding substrates, thus bringing the natural adhesion
phenomena to the market. By studying the structural properties, the polymers
were designed in such a way that they provide the characteristics features of being
an adhesive of choice, such as underwater adhesion, minimum toxicity, low cost,
and high strength (Putnam 2020). Fiber-reinforced polymer-based adhesives have
been recently developed for reversible applications. The reversibility helps in
recycling and also contributes towards a circular economy. The bonding/debonding
technology uses mechanical methods, thermal methods, use of foaming agents, etc.
(Goodenough et al. 2023).
Keeping in mind the concern of energy conservation, recently many industries
have started to develop cementitious adhesives, as per the standard of the ETICS
(external thermal insulation composite system). ETICS has been in use for the last
60 years, and it has been found to be suitable for households. The use of ETICS has508 22 Organic Polymers for Adhesive Applications: History, Progress, and the Future

shown a great response toward maximizing efficiency, in addition to energy con￾servation and environment safety (Czernik et al. 2020). The various applications of
adhesives for energy conservation are depicted in Figure 22.5.
Although adhesives are prominently used for bonding various materials, how￾ever with progress in research, many adhesives have been synthesized which can
be used for energy conservation. A special focus has been laid on the development
of adhesives, with minimum energy requirement, thus contributing toward sustain￾able development.
22.9 Disadvantages of Organic Adhesives
1) Most of the advanced adhesive formulations require the use of toxic reagents,
which cause ill effects on the health and environment. The starting materials are
often toxic, and the dispersion medium (organic) often emits vapors, which are
harmful to the environment, and causes various respiratory diseases in humans
and animals.
2) The World Health Organization (WHO) and government agencies have been
emphasizing minimizing the use of organic-solvent-based adhesives. Thus, the
need for water-borne adhesivesisincreasing, owing to safety concerns. Although
safe to use, water-borne adhesives require a much longer time to cure and are
limited to be used only on some specific materials, mainly cellulose-based, such
as paper and wood.
3) The disposal of unused adhesivesis also a matter of concern for both environment
and health. Most of the adhesives come with limited shelf life and are prone to
dry up too soon, thus left unused and dumped.References 509
4) Most of the adhesives available are difficult to carry, as the glue fluid may get
spilled. Although few convenient adhesives have been developed for paper use,
most adhesives with higher strength are often difficult to store or transport.
5) Convenient adhesives would be those, which can be stored in powder form for
a longer time. These adhesives can be mixed with the required solvent medium
and used when needed. But, at the present stage, there has been very little work
done to develop powder adhesives.
6) The necessity of a fluorescent water-borne has been felt for a long time. Fluores￾cent glues find great applications in crafts and designs to easily detect fractured
joints and dentistry. But unfortunately, most of the reported adhesives today are
not fluorescent, and further development in fluorescent adhesive production is
needed.
22.10 Conclusion
Adhesive or glue is essential for our daily use and has been used by humans since
ancient times in different forms. Many advanced synthetic adhesives have been
under various services, characterized by different types and groups. The adhesive
industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the current era. A country’s
economy depends on adhesives’ market prospects and has become a leading
market. The present market value of the adhesive industry can be estimated to be
around 67.5 billion USD. Adhesives are essential for various applications, which
include packaging, transportation, construction, and medicines. Different types of
adhesives are used for different purposes, which are used based on their properties
and the nature of the adherends. Standard testing protocols have been set up by the
ASTM, according to which the adhesive strengths of the materials are determined.
Although a material of utmost necessity, certain ill effects of adhesives cannot be
ignored. Research around the globe has been in progress toward the formulation
of advanced adhesives, which will eventually lead to a boost in the adhesive/glue
industry.

23.1 Introduction
There are so many environmental impacts and effects issues that two of the United
Nations’ sustainable development objectives have been set aside for them: clean
water and excellent health and well-being. Researchers in several disciplines are
working on solutionsto clean up pollution in the environment. By creating materials
that may act as catchers of hazardous chemicals existing in polluted soil, water, or air,
materialscientists have made a significant contribution to this objective. An efficient
adsorbent material must react non-covalently with contaminants to avoid dissocia￾tion throughout adsorption, but the contact must be weak enough to be reversible.
Some of the best prospects in this approach are organic macrocycles (Skorjanc et al.
2021). They offer strength, insolubility, and stability to covalent polymeric struc￾tures, providing additional benefits (Beuerle and Gole 2018). While some of these
systems have been made available for purchase, others are yet to be fully investi￾gated. Air damages soil, and water destroys people’s health and various ecosystems.
Adsorption has been a widely used method for removing pollutants, but modern
substances scientific research is contributed to developing sorbent materials that
are more effective, affordable, and scalable (Zia et al. 2020). Porous organic poly￾mers (POPs) contain functional groups and voids that can build supramolecular
interactions to sequester contaminants (Isaeva et al. 2021). The insolubility of such
compounds greatly enhances their potential for regeneration and recycling.
POPs are penetrable or permeable materials constructed by the process of poly￾merization in which organic building blocks show strong covalent interaction. Due
to their unique stability, POPs hold tremendous interest (Sarkar et al. 2021). They
have attributes including large surface area, and configurable porosity, are simple
to synthesize, and are easy to process for technological applications giving them an
edge compared to all other porous materials (Wang et al. 2020). Advances in organic
synthesis enable the fabrication of a wide range of porous polymers with much
chemical functionality incorporated inside the microporous or on the surfaces. The

application of POPs in several areas, such as selective permeation, catalysis, clean
energy storage, gas storage and adsorption, sensing, molecular motors, and photo￾conductors, is now being extensively investigated (Wang et al. 2021). According to
their pore diameters, POPs are often divided into three classes: macroporous (pores
larger than 450 nm), mesoporous (2–50 nm), and microporous (2 nm) (Ranganatha
2020). The study of porous materials with customized functions generated from
basic molecular building blocks is now a key area of research in material science.
POPs can be classified as either crystalline or amorphous analogs, depending on
the level of crystallinity. The crystalline form of POPs includes covalent organic
frameworks (COFs) that are standard, while amorphous POPs primarily comprise
conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), polymers of intrinsic microporosity
(PIMs), hyper-crosslinked polymers (HCPs), porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs)
(Luo et al. 2020). Usually, in the process of their production, reversible processes
often result in organized framework structures, whereas irreversible reactions
invariably result in amorphous porous polymers due to their advantages of inherent
porosity, low weight, resilience, tunable architectures, and custom functionality as
well as their prospective applications in environmental remediation (Korde and
Kandasubramanian 2019).
POPs are distinctive due to a combination of attributes not present in other
materials:
1) Complaisant production permits uptake performance for compositional
engineering by varying the cluster of composition (Valencia et al. 2020).
2) Stability across a variety of chemical circumstances (such as very reductive or
oxidative environments or acidic or basic environments), leading to long-term
steady performance and possible recycling to streamline workup procedures
(Ushani et al. 2020).
3) The large surface area and adjustable pore size provide high absorption capacity
and controlled mass transfer (Xu et al. 2015).
4) POPs have featured the composition of a lightweight element with the potential
for strong gravimetric performance in terms of energy and molecular absorption
(Liu et al. 2020).
5) They have minimal density. Aslight components(C, H, N, O, B, etc.) comprise the
majority of POPs, the comparatively low density can culminate in a remarkable
gravimetric performance, which raises the adsorption capacity (Ding et al. 2022).
6) POPs show structural adaptability due to the variety of building blocks and the
rise of reticular chemistry, and a wide range of POPs with rational functional
groups may be easily developed and synthesized.
7) POPs are made without the involvement of metal ions, unlike metal–organic
frameworks(MOFs), preventing the danger of metal ion emission and secondary
pollution (Karmakar et al. 2022).
With these characteristics, POPs represent the most recent development
in high-performance adsorbents, showing significant value as potentially
“game-changing” advancements in the area of selective sequestration.23.1 Introduction 515
Polymers have a wide range of applications. Biodegradable polymers are com￾monly used in the biomedical industry for tissue engineering and drug delivery.
As support, organic polymers are frequently used because of their stable, cheap,
nontoxic, and processable qualities. High efficiency and activity are constrained by
limited dispersion in solventssolution, traditional polymers’ active sites are exposed,
and there is an interaction between substrates and catalysts. Single-atom catalysis
may be a feature of hierarchically porous materials made of monomers with coordi￾nation sites or catalytic functional groups.
A straightforward POPs synthesis often yields a network with a high microspore
concentration leading to a broad surface area value. Figure 23.1 is an illustration of
the different applications of POPs. These micropores are restricted to the catalysis
of gaseous molecules and are helpful for gas adsorption applications. However, by
generating steric limitations leading to constraining catalytic efficiency, these pores
frequently lead to ineffective reactant and substrate transport. Meso- and/or macro￾pores are hence more advantageous for superior POP catalytic applications that
achieve broad substrate scopes. POPs are superior porous molecules for wastewater
treatment because of their distinctive crystalline properties, diverse topologies, and
compositions. POPs with configurable functionalization, programmable structures,
and adjustable pore size may be produced as a result of organic chemistry’s adapt￾ability. These characteristics, along with POPs’ outstanding thermal and chemical
stability, have given them the power to survive harsh conditions for future effective
adsorption applications. POPs are also projected to be of significant importance
for wastewater treatment shortly due to their simple separation processes and
low energy needs. It will be appealing to combine with other approaches like

photocatalysis, which converts extremely hazardous pollutants into non-toxic or
less toxic chemicals while also having a high removal efficiency, to achieve effective
wastewater management. Due to the continued efforts of researchers from around
the world, it is projected that POPs will be able to function as adaptive adsorbent
materials for the efficient removal of various metallic ions in actual water samples
in the next years.
Organic polymers are mostly microporous varying with pore sizes. Their design
ability has to be performed in a controlled manner. Amorphous and ionic organic
networks are amorphous, and cannot be crystallized, while metal–organic frame￾works are highly crystalline. Instability trend out of the four, amorphous porous
organic polymer shows the highest, followed by covalent and nanoporous ionic
organic polymer leaving metal–organic framework with the least stability in com￾parison. Metal and covalent organic polymers can be self-assembled based on their
intermolecular interactions and bonding. However, amorphous porous polymer
requires condensation and nanoporous ionic networks require template synthesis
A decrease in micropore concentration and a rise in macropore porosity are typical
causes of a decrease in BET surface area (Kreisberg and Antropova 2014). It should
be mentioned that a considerable surface area is required for catalysis activity
at the interfaces of catalysts, as in the degradation of dyes since it enhances the
interfacial interaction between substrate and catalyst. Therefore, POP substrates
with a considerable surface area and hierarchical porosity are advantageous for
catalytic applications. POPs have advantages over other porous materials. The
exploration of porous materials has significantly advanced, progressing from
inorganic zeolites to coordination polymers or metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),
and more recently covalent organic frameworks (COFs) (Ma et al. 2022). It is
currently needed to analyze the advantages and drawbacks of POPs against all other
porous materials. Heterogeneous catalysts must have both chemical and thermal
stability. Although COFs and MOFs have a high surface area as well as porosity,
they frequently exhibit significant moisture and pH sensitivity, which can cause
structural collapse (Yoon et al. 2021). POPs, in contrast, are extremely stable in
practically all major solvents, including water, and across a wide range of pH values.
Additionally, POPs, particularly CMPs, are very stable under high hydrothermal
conditions, and temperatures and continue to be a great alternative for catalysts
in tough circumstances (Tao et al. 2020). Though zeolites have excellent chemical
and thermal stability as well, they are a poor choice for catalysis due to their
difficulty incorporating specified functionality into the framework for particular
applications (Ding and Wang 2013). While on the other hand, POPs are even more
user-friendly due to their straightforward synthesis and structural modification. As
a result of the growth of contemporary society and industry, metallic ions, organic
micro-pollutants, radioactive elements, and other toxins have significantly affected
our natural environment. Therefore, the question of how to effectively remove these
contaminants is crucial. Because of POP’s advantages such as low cost, easy oper￾ation, and high efficiency, porous materials have been extensively explored for the
separation and absorption of pollutants at this time. The performance of traditional
porous materials, such as activated carbon and molecular sieves, can’t be improved23.2 Parameters of Oxygen-Rich POPs in Dye Adsorption from Water Sources 517
by further enhancement of their segregation and adsorption performance. Even
though MOFs have been studied as potential pollution removers, they exhibit poor
chemical stability, and the hazardous metals produced after the structural disinte￾gration of MOFs cause secondary contamination (Dias and Petit 2016). Therefore,
POPs are exciting alternatives to their traditional equivalents. Due to their porosity
hierarchies, host–guest interactions, ease of structure-and-function tuning, and
high chemical stabilities, macrocycle-based POPs have shown exceptional and great
performance in pollutant removal. Figure 23.2 describes the various applications
in bioremediation with POPs. Here, we focus on the removal of micropollutants,
charged species, metal ions, oils and organic solvents, perfluorinated substances,
iodine, and volatile organic compounds.
23.2 Parameters of Oxygen-Rich POPs in Dye
Adsorption from Water Sources
One of the biggest causes of water pollution is organic dyesin effluent from the paper,
textile, plastic, and food sectors. They are extremely dangerous to the aquatic sys￾tem and may be harmful to human health. The most straightforward and effective
method of purifying water of pollutants is adsorption (Rashid et al. 2021). Activated
carbons, zeolites, and porous organic polymers (POPs), among other porous mate￾rials with high specific surface area and rich porous architectures, have all been
employed as adsorbent materials to effectively remove dyes from wastewater. POPs
are one of the most attractive and interesting fields, because of their distinct benefits,
including ease of functionalization, adjustable porosity, and structural diversity.
When POPs are added to oxygen-containing functional groups it could result in
certain unique features. Firstly, the occurrence of oxygen-containing compounds
can make POPs more hydrophilic and increase the region in which they come into
contact with dye molecules in water (Yang et al. 2021). Because of its notable char￾acteristics, like huge pore size, accurate balance, and broad surface area robust￾ness in various solvents, it recently turned out to be a growing study subject in
porous substances. These features of POPs are favorable for mass transfer, providing
more lively sites, and emerging as a promising platform for the recycling process in
photocatalysis (Zhang et al. 2019). POPs can be fabricated reversibly or irreversibly.
For reversible synthesis, Koil and organic frameworks are utilized. However, for
a reversible we can perform Friedel–Crafts alkylation, coupling of carbon bonds,
imine formation, or cyclotrimerization additionally, the oxygen-rich subunits can
make the functionalized POPs more electronegative, affording additional electro￾static attraction with cationic dye molecules. Adding hydrophilic hydroxyl groups
can increase the ability of CMPs to adsorb dye (Fan et al. 2022) and developed the
novel triterpene and crown ether-based highly permeable copolymer POP-TCE-15,
and they recognized that the methylene blue which is a positively charged cationic
dye, and the crown-ether-15 which contains the lone pair of electrons on O-atom
have electrostatically interacted (Xu et al. 2018). POP-O exhibits a hysteresis loop
and both Type I and Type IV absorption isotherms. The BET model determinesGas adsorption by POPs

that the POP-O’s surface area is 619 m2 g−1. POP-O mostly contains micropores that
are 0.9 nm in size, mesopores that are 2.2 nm in size, and a few mesopores that are
5–40 nm in size (Yang et al. 2021). The outcomes show that the polymer has a hier￾archical pore structure. The hierarchy of pore structure incorporatesthe strengths of
micropores and mesopores, which could accelerate the masstransfer rate of the sub￾stance and make itsimplerfor dye moleculesto enter POP-O, expanding its potential
for application in the adsorption industry. The porosity of POP affects its ability
to adsorb substances, but it also significantly affects both the size of the particles
and the porosity in the solution. The size distributions of the POP-O particles are
100–180 nm and 1000–1700 nm. The large-sized molecules originating from the clus￾tering of POP-B nanoparticles show only one point focused at 1414 nm. The small
particulate matter of POP-O is advantageous for dye molecule adsorption. POPs
soak up more or equal amounts of energy from photons than their gaps between
bands. In gasoline repositories and their detachment, catalysis, photoelectric alter￾ation, energy conversion and storage, and many others, POPs have acquired an inter￾est in research and attention due to their advantages of pre-designable structures,
lightweight, higher essential permeability, and first-rate stability.
POP-O may have effective adsorption properties for organic dye contaminants
from water due to its abundance of oxygen-rich units and hierarchical pore
structure. To investigate the adsorption capabilities of oxygen-enriched POP for
water-soluble contaminants, rhodamine B (Rh B) is utilized as the adsorbate. One
of the most important characteristics of an adsorbent that directly affects its actual
adsorption effectiveness is fast kinetic adsorption capacity. The strong adsorption
capability of oxygen-enriched POP for RH B is primarily attributed to various
aspects. First, the POP-O has strong hydrophilicity because it contains the hydroxyl
and carbonyl groups, which makes it simpler to produce a homogeneous dispersion
in Rh B aqueous solution (Pech-Canul et al. 2020). Second, POP-O becomes
electronegative due to the oxygen-rich units, allowing for even stronger electrostatic
linkage with cationic dye molecules (Rh B). Last, but not least, the huge unique
surface area of POP-O offers a substantial volume for the storage of dye molecules
during adsorption. Thus, the structural characteristics of the POP-O, large surface
area, numerous oxygen-containing groups, and hierarchical pore architectures,
combine to provide good adsorption capability of Rh B dyes extracted from aqueous
solutions. Figure 23.3 describes the artificial pathway of synthesis of polymers.
23.3 TALPOPs Include Reversible Iodine Detection
and Extraction
Numerous adsorbent substances have been investigated and evaluated for the effi￾cientsensing and sequestration of iodine. According to some reports, the adsorbent’s
surface area, particularly high-affinity binding sites, pore size, conjugated units, and
polar groups all have a role in determining how effectively iodine is sequestered
(Yildirim et al. 2022). Thus, in addition to the expanded surface area, boosting the
host’s affinity for iodine may also have a significant impact on iodine collection. It520 23 Remediation of Environmental Toxins with Porous Organic Molecules

has been observed that substances such as silica, activated carbon, silver-doped zeo￾lites, microporous polymers, and chalcogenide aerogels have effective radioiodine
adsorption capabilities (Chee et al. 2020).
Using the metal-independent-Schiff base polycondensation technique, a new
TALPOP (triazene-anthracene-based fluorescent animal-linked porous organic
polymer)is created by combining 2-furaldehyde, 9,10-bis-(4,6-diamino-S-triazin2-yl)
anthracene (DTA), and the core of the envisioned POP. 2-Furaldehyde serves as an
organic linker in this structure. The polymer has excellent porosity and exceptional
thermal and chemical stabilities, with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of
401 m2 g−1 (Sabri et al. 2020). Such porosity combined with the high concentration
of conjugate heteroatom-rich structure allows the polymer molecule to produce a
remarkable vapor of iodine, which is uptake to 314 wt% and also found reversible
adsorption of iodine in solution (Lustig et al. 2017). Due to the presence of
anthracene moieties, the TALPOP shows iodine detection with excellent sensitivity
through fluorescence quenching with 2.9*103 l mol−1 of Kvs value. Because of its
low cost and excellent iodine absorption and sensing, TALPOP is a perfect material
for environmental restoration. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm at 77 K is
used to determine the precise surface area and pore characteristics of TALPOP. The
polymer is generally microporous with some mesoporous pore size distribution,
as evidenced by the steep increase of isotherm in nitrogen gas absorption at a low
relative pressure (P/Po 0.01) and lower uptake at the range of 0.01–0.8 P/Po (Sabri
et al. 2020). Due to their specific characteristics of electron-rich nature and large
surface area, these POPs can acquire a significant quantity of iodine. Figure 23.4 is
an illustration of the synthetic route for the preparation of the synthetic polymers
including TALPOP.

resolve this problem is mercury adsorption removal (Chowdhury et al. 2021). Firstly,
the adsorptive removal of mercury is quite demanding for nitrogen- and sulfur-rich
large surface area POPs, because high surface area improves the adsorption
capacity of Hg(II) and these elements present at the pore structural surface of the
material provide strong linkages with Hg(II) ions (Zhang et al. 2019). Second, TPP-1
(secondary amine-linked, S-containing porous organic polymer), which has a very
large surface area and hierarchical porosity, also removes mercury (Kostova et al.
2013). It was created by combining a monoaldehyde and thiophene-2-carbaldehyde
or tetramine and the tetrapodal amine 6,6-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) with a Schiff
base, and it showed extremely high uptake for organic methylmercury (691 mg g−1)
and Hg2+ (3106 mg g−1) (Chowdhury et al. 2021). Theoretical calculation or DFT
(density functional theory) calculation and AIM analysis support the strong Hg
absorption and mercury connection between the S and N-sites of TTP-1. There is a
very strong bond between the S and N lone pair through noncovalent interactions.
Therefore, the occurrence of strong-to-moderately stronger non-covalent linkages
between the ligand sites of the polymer surface and Hg2+ can cause significant Hg2+
adsorption by this porous organic polymer material (Modak et al. 2020). The great
potential of TTP-1 for the adsorptive elimination of both inorganic and organic
mercury can have considerable positive effects on the environment and promote
the development of a long-lasting adsorbent for the treatment of wastewater.
23.5 Novel N-Enriched Covalent Crystalline POPs
for Efficient Removal of Cadmium
The development of effective adsorbents with highly abundant active sites, to
enable fast absorption and high capacity for pollutants like cadmium, is one of the
rising concerns in environmental remediation (Algarni and Al-Mohaimeed 2022).
Cadmium and its constituents are more soluble than other heavy metals, and they
can easily enter biological systems. In contrast, the high toxicity of Cd(II) promotes
serious illnesses such as hypertension, nausea, skeletal deformation patterns, and522 23 Remediation of Environmental Toxins with Porous Organic Molecules

kidney stone formation. The research of cadmium removal has thus received a lot of
attention over the past decade, and a variety of techniques including nanofiltration,
ultrafiltration, chemical precipitation, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and biological
treatment have all been developed (Awual 2019). However, these systems have
drawbacks such as complicated operations, high-energy consumption, and expen￾sive running costs. The suitable adsorbent for eliminating cadmium from aqueous
solutions is N-enriched crystalline COF, which is generated via condensation of
2,4,6-tris(p-formyl phenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine and 2,4,6-tris(hydrazino)-1,3,5-triazine.
An imine-linked porous COF with sufficient nitrogen that provided greater per￾formance in cadmium removal was rationally developed and synthesized, and it
is shortly referred to as N-enriched COF (Dinari and Hatami 2019). After that, a
flexible coupling block and a monomer are derived from a triazine, which causes
the network resonance following polymerization. Lone pair electrons are so freely
accessible and able to interact with the metal ions. By increasing the pH of the
solution and making the functional centers of the adsorbent accessible, an anionic
form of COF is created. At pH = 7, the optimum option is the maximum elimination
of cadmium (98%) (Pérez-Marín et al. 2007). Figure 23.5 describes the synthesis
of N-enriched covalent crystalline porous organic polymers. The elimination of
cadmium is examined at various intervals between 5 and 60 minutes under 80 ppm
concentration and optimal pH = 7.
23.6 Novel Phenyl-Phosphate-Based POPs for the
Elimination of Pharmaceutical Water Contaminants
Living species depend on clean water systems to survive; thus, removing new toxins
from aquatic systems is a fundamental research concern to restore the equilibrium
of the ecosystem regarding a sustainable society. Due to rising manufacturing
and utilization of synthetic chemicals, water system poses a serious issue to
people and aquatic life. Many pollutants, commonly known as micropollutants,
increase toxicological effects even at a trace level. Besides these, pharmaceuticals
and personal care products (PPCPS) and pharmaceuticals such as antiepileptic
drugs, anti-inflammatory medications, and antibiotics are claimed to be frequently23.6 Novel Phenyl-Phosphate-Based POPs for the Elimination of Pharmaceutical Water Contaminants 523
observed in surface water (Liu and Wong 2013), in fresh vegetables, in wild
animals, and even in sediments. Different types of therapeutic strategies have
been investigated to remediate PPCPs in water. These include membrane filtration,
adsorption, photocatalytic degradation, and enhanced oxidation. To chemically
destroy PPCPs and mineralize them, photocatalytic degradation and advanced
oxidation utilize highly reactive agents such as hydroxyl radicals; however, these
pathways frequently have large energy demands or exhibit deficient effectiveness,
primarily when background organics are abundant (Rosman et al. 2018). The
reaction between 2,3,4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and phenyl trichlorosilane in the
presence of a base and further reacting with benzidine with glacial acetic acid is to
obtain an organic polymer. Various phases of clinical trials have been done to check
the efficacy of therapeutics and determine whether the formulation of organic
polymer is safe or not. Phase 1 is generally associated with the dosage and safety of
polymer for its utilization in the treatment of disease. In this phase, tolerance and
side effects are observed to decide whether it is safe to use or not. Under phase 2,
the effectiveness of the molecule is observed and evaluated in correspondence to
that particular disease. If no side effect is observed, then it is considered as good to
go for the third phase. In the third phase, we determine the efficacy and reactions
of the molecule as a treatment aid, and its long-term effectiveness is measured and
observed. During this undesirable by-product and chemical breakdown could also
develop. Because most PPCPs may move through larger high-porosity membranes,
the elimination of PPCPs via membrane needs reverse osmosis or nanofiltration
membranes (Shin et al. 2022). Because of its convenience in the method design and
ease of usage, adsorption has generated a lot of attention for the removal of PPCP.
POPs have the potential to be an effective adsorbent for the specific elimination
of water pollutants like PPCPs. To maintain structural stability over prolonged
usage, such polymers must be developed with caution so that the functional group
does not disrupt the heterogeneous character of the adsorbent. According to a
prior study, adsorbents containing phosphate functional groups may be useful for
removing pharmaceutical pollutants and Sewage Treatment plants.
Particularly for weakly basic pharmacological or biological pollutants, phosphate
sitesinside the polymerstructure should diffuse a high sorption property. It happens
due to the weakly acidic nature of phosphates. The objective of this study is to
construct phosphate-based POP and examine their function for the extraction of
pharmaceutical components from water. Diphenyl phosphate serves as the primary
functional unit precursor in the synthesis of phosphate-based porous organic poly￾mers (P-POP), whereas 1,3,5-triphenyl benzene and 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethylene
serve as linkers. By utilizing a Friedel–Crafts procedure, two significant
phosphate-based POPs, P-POP-1, and P-POP-2 are produced. Diphenyl phos￾phate as precursors are for P-POP-1 and 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethylene for P-POP-2
(Ravi et al. 2020). The phenyl ring structures in the porous polymer are linked at
various substitution sites. In contrast, one linkage may join two phenyl rings at their
ortho locations, while another would connect them at their para positions. P-POPs
are most likely to be polymeric materials with repeating molecules composed of
phenyl phosphate and aromatic hydrocarbons (Zhou et al. 2022), but they have an
amorphous polymer matrix, according to a combination of NMR, XPS, FTIR, and524 23 Remediation of Environmental Toxins with Porous Organic Molecules

XRD data. N2-adsorption desorption isotherms are used to assess pore volume, sur￾face area, and permanent pore structure (Vinu et al. 2008). N2-adsorption desorption
isotherms are used to evaluate the pore volume, surface area, and permanent pore
structure of the polymer. At relative pressures of 0.1–0.2, P-POP-1 exhibits type IV
N2 adsorption isotherms with steeper gas uptakes and illustrates the microporous
nature of the polymer materials (Ravi et al. 2020). Phosphate-based POP-2 are
further distinguished by type IV isotherms with strong nitrogen absorption at low
pressures and weak nitrogen uptake at high pressures, i.e. 0.7–1.0 exhibits a major
hysteresis loop generated by mesoporous channels of these networks. Moreover,
the P-POP-2 has a mesoporous percentage that is much larger (32.5%) than the
P-POP-1 (19.6%). Such mesoporosity greatly facilitates interaction between target
components and the adsorbate. In contrast, the P-POP-1 adsorbs > 70% of medicinal
compounds within 20 min of contact time, while the P-POP-2 absorbs > 75% over
the same time frame. In the context of common cations (such as Mg2+, Na+, and
Ca2+) in water, P-POP-1 and P-POP-2, both demonstrate great selectivity (more
than 98%) for the medicinal compounds. Figure 23.6 describes the route for the
synthesis of phosphate-based POPs. Additionally, they exhibit excellent chemical
stability upon repeated usage with no reduction of adsorption capability.
23.7 Nano-architecture POPs in the Elimination of Toxic
Metal Ions
POPs are based on strong covalent bonds and have been involved as a potential
class of porous materials. Due to their unique properties, they have been frequently
utilized as adsorbentsforthe elimination ofradioactive/toxic metal ions. Figure 23.723.8 PSM (Post-synthetic Modification) 525

shows the pathway for the synthesis of artificial pathways of functionalized POPs.
Diverse heterotopic atom-doped functional groups have been introduced into the
polymer backbone of POPs using post-synthetic modification (PSM) synthetic and
bottom-up techniques to improve the accumulation of metal ions like chromium
(Cr), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and arsenic (As) (Subramaniam et al. 2019), which
are non-biodegradable, poisonous, and likely to accumulate in aquatic organisms,
living organisms, and human beings.
23.8 PSM (Post-synthetic Modification)
PSM offers a versatile approach for manufacturing functionalized POPs with highly
customizable moieties than straightforward synthesis techniques. This strategy is
also adaptable and very useful forintroducing specialized functional groupings, par￾ticularly for those tough to directly prepare. Through the controlled PSM approach,
many functional groups, including –NH2, –COOH, and –SH, have so far been effec￾tively introduced into POPs (Raza et al. 2019). Generally, the introduction of either
inorganic or organic moieties is frequently used to perform PSM. POPs have under￾gone a reduction reaction, esterification, click reaction, hydrolysis of esters, and
other procedures to include different organic functional groups into their structure
(Liu et al. 2021). Doping inorganic moieties into the host backbone, such as metal
nanoparticles, metals, or metal cations, has also been effective in demonstrating the
PSM approach.
23.8.1 Bottom-Up Method
The “bottom-up” process is utilized for developing heterotopic atom-doped
porous organic polymer, in which functional groups are involved via methodically526 23 Remediation of Environmental Toxins with Porous Organic Molecules
constructing and applying unique building blocks. To fulfill the specific require￾ments of synthetic materials, there are two appealing techniques. One is to
customize pure monomers with numerous functional groups before the high and
effective yielding distillation. This is an excellent method for bottom-up synthesis.
Multiple functional groups, including –OH, –SO3H, and –COOH, have been effec￾tively involved in the skeleton of POPs in this respect (Sun et al. 2015). The most
apparent benefit of this method is the pore characteristics of the well-maintained
source material, avoiding pore blocking. Another wonderful bottom-up method
is to utilize monomer-containing hybrid components like carbazole, thiophene,
and triphenylamine. Due to the enhanced affinities or sensitivity, the inclusion
of several elements (such as S, N, O, and P) not just increases the architectural
complexity of POPs but is also extremely advantageous for the capture of metal
ions. Tetra(thiophene-2-yl) silane is used as a functional monomer to produce a
new sulfur-rich microporous polymer (SMP) with a sulfur content of 31.4 weight
percent. Due to the powerful coordination reaction between soft acid mercury and
soft basic sulfur, the resultant SMP with the evenly distributed sulfur atom and the
extremely porous structure demonstrated a significant adsorption capability toward
Hg2+ (595.2 mg g−1).
23.9 POPs for Gas Extraction, Segregation,
and Transformation
POPs are distinctive because they are conjugated and nonporous, providing for
molecular design and synthetic control over their structures. POPs have evolved
into a novel category of porous material for gas storage and adsorption activities
because of their huge surface areas and microporous properties. For the storage
and adsorption of gases including methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen, POPs
have been extensively investigated (Bae and Snurr 2011). A functional group can
be introduced to the wall surface to change the pore habitat; in contrast, synthetic
processes provide control regarding porosity. The selectivity and capability of
particular gas may be improved by using this surface modification, which is a
significant and efficient method (Low et al. 2017).
23.10 Hydrogen
It has been proven that porous materials’ capacity for hydrogen absorption may be
improved by having a wide surface area, which is good for the material’s capacity
for absorption. Therefore, POPs with wide surface regions have a variety of signif￾icant benefits as sorbents during H2 storage. The first benefit is the ability to build
polymers entirely of light components (Broom et al. 2019). Second, there are several
synthetic pathways available by which a variety of functionality may be added. Third,
polymers are a modular technology, and there are existing instances of systems that23.12 Carbon Dioxide 527
are manufactured on a global scale for use in industry (such as macroporous poly￾mer compositesforseparations)(Savina et al. 2016). The ability to manufacture POPs
in a sculpted “monolithic” configuration has a lesser evident benefit (Salmean and
Dimartino 2019). By performing so, volumetric storage problems with the packaging
of porous particulate components may be avoided.
More endeavors have been made to enhance the heat of adsorption, which is par￾ticularly necessary for potential implementation, to further maximize the hydrogen
absorption of POP materials. One effective strategy to improve hydrogen efficiency
could be to dope metal into the materials. By metalizing POP materials, coordinately
unsaturated metal complexes(Li, Mn, Ni) may be provided. Several POPs, including
F-CTF3, HCP, Ni-Por-1, TNP4, N-PEINK, PCTF-4, and SHCP-3, permit the separa￾tion and storage of H2 (Zhang et al. 2017).
23.11 Methane
Natural gas, which contains mostly methane gas, is a plentiful source of energy
180 cm3 (STP) at 298 K and 35 bar is the DOE’s target range for methane storage
(Knerelman et al. 2022). The investigation of POPs for methane adsorption has
received less attention than that of other gases. Organic porous materials are
indeed very promising because the isosteric sorption temperatures for methane
in carbonaceous materials range within the optimal condition for storage around
room temperature (Thomas et al. 2009). Out of all the materials presented,
Friedel–Crafts self-condensation of 50 bis chloromethyl monomers, including
4,4′
-bis(chloromethyl)-1,10-biphenyl (BCMBP) and DCX (dichlorosilane), pro￾duced several hyper crosslinked polymers in 2008 that Cooper and colleagues
evaluated for their CH4 storage capacity. The BCMBP-based compound exhibits the
estimated Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (1904 m2 g−1) (Makal et al.
2012), and greatest CH4 uptake (116 cm3 g−1, 5.2 mmol g−1). In MOPs (microporous
organic polymer), PPN-4 had the maximum methane absorption. At 55 and 35 bar,
the uptake would approach 28.0 and 21.5 wt%, respectively. PPN-13 recently
showed a very high 3420 m2 g−1 BET surface area. At 77 K and 40 bar, the whole
hydrogen absorption is 52 mg g−1, whereas at 65 bar and 298 K, the overall methane
absorption is 179 mg g−1 (Lu et al. 2014).
Some more POPs contributed to methane uptakes such as CTF-TPC, Ni-Por-1,
FCDTPA-K-700, PIN1, SHCP-3, PCTF-4, BILP-12, and P5-CMP-1 (Zhang et al. 2017).
23.12 Carbon Dioxide
The greater utilization of fossil fuels has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
into the environment, which has a detrimental effect on the attempt to combat
global warming. While ethanol-based hydrophilic amines have not yet been assessed
as a viable choice for CO2 exfoliation, several POPs have lower energy penalties and
provide superior physiochemical properties. Adsorption using porous molecules528 23 Remediation of Environmental Toxins with Porous Organic Molecules
is one of several methods for CO2 collection that is both technically and energet￾ically effective (Zhang 2013). In parameters relevant to either pre-combustion or
post-combustion capture, a variety of POPs have just been identified for the uptake
of CO2. Because of their significant porosity and considerable tenability of pore
interface functioning, POPs are incredibly exciting and can improve interactions
with CO2 significantly.
Several POPs, including PAF-60, CTF-TPC, BILP-2, HCP-BDM, ThPOP-1, HOMP,
BILP-6-NH2, etc., have been observed to absorb CO2. These POPs exhibit greatselec￾tivity and capacity for CO2 uptake. They can contribute to the solution and encour￾age scientists in this sector to use comparable material design techniques to combat
climate change. The materials are ecologically beneficial due to their metal-free com￾position and may be carefully tailored to trap toxic gases using inexpensive catalysts,
like copper(Modak et al. 2020). Yavuz and Coskun have described it as a sequence of
abridged nanoporous covalent organic polymers with exceptional growth in CO2/N2
selectivity with temperature rise (Patel et al. 2014). It also gives the researcher a way
to regulate POPs’ surface characteristics, which may create novel opportunities for
the logical design and synthesis of new nanocomposite materials for CO2 uptake.
This creative alternative not only allows the researcher to attain an astonishingly
high CO2 adsorption capacity but also regulates the surface characteristics of POPs.
23.13 Conclusion
In this chapter, we have outlined the main techniques used to generate POPs and
divided the functions of these POPs into categories for environmental remediation
such as dye adsorption, iodine detection and extraction, adsorption of mercury,
elimination of cadmium, removal of pharmaceutical water contaminants, toxic
metal ion eradication, gas extraction, separation, and transformation. For the
storage and adsorption of gases including methane, carbon dioxide, and hydro￾gen, POPs have been extensively investigated. POPs are penetrable or permeable
materials constructed by the process of polymerization in which organic building
blocks show strong covalent interaction. A thorough analysis of the data suggests
that POP’s extraordinary performance in both chemical adsorptions as well as
heterogeneous catalytic processes is due to the unique host–guest interactions
offered by supramolecular macrocycles. POPs showed much greater efficacy in
comparison to pristine materials. POPs have strong mechanical strength and can
be subsequently manufactured into membranes for non-polar and polar organic
chemicalseparation. Even though surface areas of POPs can periodically be reduced
by the addition of macrocycles, their gas adsorption affinity and sensitivity are
surprisingly increased. Therefore, more studies should have been focused on devel￾oping unique, high-performance POPs using eco-friendly, effective techniques.
In conclusion, we provide a thorough description of the synthetic approaches
and utilization of hierarchical POPs formed from macrocycles. POPs in several
areas, such as selective permeation, catalysis, clean energy storage, gas storage
and adsorption, sensing, molecular motors, and photoconductors, are now being23.13 Conclusion 529
extensively investigated. Simple POPs synthesis frequently results in a network
with a high microspore concentration, which results in a large surface area value.
An instance of the various uses for POPs is shown in Figure 23.1. These micropores
are useful for gas adsorption applications and are only used to catalyze gaseous
molecules. However, these holestypically result in inefficient reactant and substrate
transport because they create steric restrictions that reduce catalytic efficiency.
For better POP catalytic applications that reach large substrate scopes, meso￾and/or macropores are hence more beneficial. A reduction in BET surface area is
frequently caused by an increase in macropore porosity and a decrease in micropore
concentration.
Using the Schiff base reaction, extremely porous polymers rich in nitrogen were
synthesized. One of the highest values for POPs recorded, the extraordinary CO2
absorption of 7.06 mmol g−1, is the result of the large surface area, nitrogen-adorned
pores, and electron-rich aromatic structures. POPs are a fascinating platform for the
conversion, separation, and collection of CO2. Although many POPs have already
been found to absorb CO2, only a small number have now been investigated for
the conversion of CO2 into value-added compounds. POPs for methane adsorption
have received less attention than those of other gases. With our contribution, we
want to inspire the development of novel POPs for the conversion and collection of
CO2. In addition, COFs have proven to be very effective at relocating heavy metals
because of their distinctive characteristics like stability, high porosity, large surface
area, and even more accessible binding sites. With a great substantial adsorption
capacity of 396 mg−1 and outstanding efficacy in the removal of cadmium, the syn￾thetic N-enriched COF performed well. The N-enriched COFs have demonstrated
additional benefits including easy fabrication and no by-products, as well as high
efficiency, cost effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. Hence, it might be
a potential adsorbent in the remediation of environmental contamination. Due to
their distinct crystalline characteristics, varied topologies, and compositions, POPs
are excellent porous molecules for wastewater treatment. POPs with wide surface
regions have a variety of significant benefits as sorbents during H2 storage. The
first benefit is the ability to build polymers entirely of light components. Due to the
adaptability of organic chemistry, POPs with customizable functionalization, des￾ignable architectures, and changeable pore sizes may be generated. These properties
have given POPs the strong capacity to withstand hostile conditions for future effec￾tive adsorption applications, combined with their exceptional thermal/chemicalsta￾bility. POPs are also anticipated to be of great relevance for wastewater treatment
shortly due to their low-energy requirements and straightforward separation pro￾cedures. To accomplish efficient wastewater management, it will be appealing to
combine with other techniques like photocatalysis, which transforms highly haz￾ardous pollutants into non-toxic or less toxic compounds while also having a high
removal efficiency. In the upcoming years, it is anticipated that POPs will be able to
function as adaptable adsorbent materials for the effective removal of diverse metal￾lic ions in actual water samples due to the ongoing efforts of researchers from all
over the world.530 23 Remediation of Environmental Toxins with Porous Organic Molecules

24.1 Introduction
Traditional industrial manufacturing processes entail significant energy consump￾tion and environmental degradation, and synthetic chemicals have greatly benefited
human civilization. Modernizing manufacturing processes and their energy sources
are necessary to address these problems; in this context, photocatalysis, mainly
visible-light-catalysts, is a potent instrument for the transformation of almost
limitless solar energy to chemical energy (Schneider et al. 2014). A polymer, which
is a huge macromolecule, is essentially made up of a lot of smaller molecules. The
Greek term “polymer” means “many parts.” Everywhere we look, polymers are
present – from the widely used biopolymer polypropylene to the naturally occurring
biopolymer found in the human DNA strand. Polymers have a wide range of appli￾cations. Biodegradable polymers are commonly used in the biomedical industry for
tissue engineering and drug delivery. Neoprene is used in both shoe soles and wet
suits. Non-stick pans use Teflon; pipelines use polyvinyl chloride, while textiles and
fabrics frequently use different polymers. The well-known PET bottles as called
as polyethylene terephthalate are produced using synthetic polymer polyethylene
terephthalate. Polystyrene resins are used to manufacture household goods and
appliances. Both the plastics and textiles sectors utilize nylon-6 extensively. The
glass-like polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) is present in many consumer goods.
Due to their porosity and high specific area organic polymers are used widely in
the world. Not only the surface area but the presence of a designable structure,
low density, and easily available for functionalization, organic polymers are usually
the source of applications in numerous of fields. There is another advantage of the
organic polymers to use them in different application is to have metal-free structure
present in them. The metal-free structure of the organic polymer does not let
them interfere during the making derivatives of the synthesis process. Nowadays,
porous organic polymers are taking the attention of several researchers. There is an
advantage of using porous organic polymers due to the ability of biodegradation in

their polymeric chains. They are not persisting in the environment and cause harm
to nature. This article provides an in-depth analysis of natural biopolymer research
and a greater comprehension of the trends that have emerged in the industry over
the past 22 years and can also act as a resource for upcoming studies. Organic
polymers are macromolecules consisting of many monomer units that repeat.
Natural and synthetic polymers are both necessary for daily life. Polysaccharides,
polypeptides, and polynucleotides are the three basic types of biopolymers that are
present in living cells. Organic polymers are frequently utilized in the electronics
sector as packaging materials, insulators, dielectrics, and thermal transfer media,
and to shield delicate joints and components from shock and vibration, mechanical
and thermal damage, and airborne contaminants. Organic polymers are also
necessary for basic structural elements and participation in vital life processes in
living beings. For instance, polymers make up all of the solid parts of plants. Among
them are cellulose, lignin, and different resins. For a very long time, people have
recognized the value of chemistry in daily life. There are numerous instances some
of which are even emblematic where this discipline of science has significantly
improved our quality of life.
Natural polymers can be found in animals and plants, as opposed to synthetic
polymers, which are created by humans. Due to their unique physical and chemical
characteristics, several polymers are used in daily life. Macromolecules known as
organic polymers are made up of many monomer units that repeat. Both natural
and artificial polymers are essential for daily life. The three primary categories
of biopolymers that are present in living cells are polysaccharides, polypeptides,
and polynucleotides. Enzyme-mediated processes in cells produce these polymers.
The producer of polymeric parts that are green, energy-efficient, high-quality,
reasonably priced, etc. will be a major trend in the coming millennium. Modern
polymer research is very interdisciplinary and integrated, and as a result, it does
not easily fit into the conventional natural science structural models. These days,
organic polymers are used in many different technical applications, including solar
cells, sensors, and LEDs. Typically, natural polymer-carriers are weak, safe for
microbes to consume, and quickly degraded by them in anaerobic environments
Monomers containing two or more functional groups, numerous bonds, or rings
with three to seven members are frequently used to create synthetic polymers. While
polymers’ physical properties can vary, their chemical properties can be determined
by the monomer units that make up each polymer. Polymers are classified as
thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, or fibers based on their physical properties.
One of the main issues affecting human health is environmental pollution, which is
caused by the rapid expansion of the chemical, battery, steel, fertilizer, and pesticide
industries as well as mining operations. Metal(loid) pollution puts the health
of living things at risk. The ecosystem has undergone major changes due to the
build-up of metal(loids) due to anthropogenic and natural activity. Environmentally
harmful substances such as cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury have also
been connected to several diseases, including birth deformities, damage to internal
organs like the kidney and also liver, specific learning difficulties, and a range of24.2 Characteristics of Organic Polymer 537
different ailments. These metals can be found in wastewater and soil along with
other metal ions.
Polymers have a wide range of applications. Biodegradable polymers are com￾monly used in the biomedical industry for tissue engineering and drug delivery.
As support, organic polymers are frequently used because of their stable, cheap,
nontoxic, and processable qualities. High efficiency and activity are constrained by
limited dispersion in solventssolution, traditional polymers’ active sites are exposed,
and there is the interaction between substrates and catalysts. Single-atom catalysis
may be a feature of hierarchically porous materials made of monomers with coordi￾nation sites or catalytic functional groups (Singh et al. 2013).
24.2 Characteristics of Organic Polymer
Organic polymer with more than 40 carbons does not exist because large macro￾molecules cannot be crystallized to that extent. The development of organic
polymers has been aided by a variety of techniques overthe years, including coupling
reactions between multi-halogen aromatic and multi-boric acid or multi-alkynyl
compounds, the Schiff base reaction between aromatic multi-amino monomers and
a dialdehyde or tri aldehyde, the Knoevenagel reaction of multi-active methylene
groups and active aldehyde groups, and the cyclo trimerization of multi-ethyls
(Xu and Hedin 2013; Uribe-Romo et al. 2009). New methods that specify the
production of organic polymers in a trustworthy and adaptable approach that are
thought to be the opposite for expanding sustainable cycle for organic polymers
to get over these difficulties. A “two-in-one” method for creating covalent organic
frameworks has recently garnered a lot of interest. The basic idea behind the
process is that two distinct functional groups are combined into a single practical
building block to pre-prepare two-in-one monomers. As a result, covalent organic
framework (COF) films can be produced by self-condensing without considering
solvent adaptability and stoichiometry (Li et al. 2019; Hao et al. 2019). Today, the
purification of water is frequently accomplished using organic polymers, which
are lengthy macromolecules composed of several repetitive monomer units. Their
typical use in the coagulant aids or primary coagulants stages of drinking water
purification. In an aqueous suspension, these chemicals have a propensity to
significantly adsorb the particles on their surface. Increased rate of settling, lower
costs, enhanced quality of treated water, and sludge dewatering properties are
just a few of the benefits of using organic polymers. A family of very porous,
crosslinked materials with a covalent bond between the monomers is referred
to as organic polymers. Metals that are heavy including cadmium, zinc, and
copper can be removed from wastewater using COP-63, a disulfide-linked covalent
polymer that was created. As per report, COPs are a potential sorbent for water
treatment since they exhibit a capacity for cadmium sorption that is seven times
higher and also sixteen times faster than that of activated carbon (Maiti et al.
2021). Porous organic polymers (POPs) are materials that can be penetrated or
are permeable and are created through the polymerization process, in which the538 24 Versatile Applications of Organic Polymer and Their Prospects
organic building blocks exhibit strong covalent interactions. POPs are of great
interest because of their distinct stability. They have advantages over all other
porous materials, including a large surface area, customizable porosity, ease of
synthesis, and ease of processing for technological applications. With numerous
chemical functions included inside the microporous or on the surfaces, a variety of
porous polymers may now be created thanks to advancements in organic synthesis.
It is unlikely that synthetic plastics with petrochemical origins can ever totally
replace them in the short or even long term, even though technology and bio￾products, such as bioplastics, can help ameliorate these environmental difficulties.
However, some applications for bioplastics may eventually be largely replaced.
For instance, because they account for a sizeable amount of the world’s plastics
output, biodegradable polymers for packaging and other short-lived use sectors are
practicable.
POPs are currently the subject of intensive research in several fields, includ￾ing selective permeation, catalysis, sustainable energy storage, gas storage and
adsorption, sensing, molecular motors, and photoconductors, among others (Wang
et al. 2021). POPs are frequently classified into three kinds based on the size of
their pores: macroporous (pores greater than 450 nm), mesoporous (2–50 nm),
and microporous (2 nm). A major field of research in material science today is the
study of porous materials with customized functionality created from fundamental
molecular building blocks. Depending on their degree of crystallinity, POPs can
be categorized as either crystalline or amorphous analogs. COFs are a common
component of POPs in their crystalline form, while conjugated microporous
polymers (CMPs), polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), hyper-crosslinked
polymers (HCPs), and porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) make up the majority
of POPs in their amorphous form. Reversible processes typically lead to organized
framework structures during their formation, but irreversible reactions usually
lead to amorphous porous polymers. Due to their potential uses in environmental
clean-up as well as their benefits of inherent porosity, low weight, resilience,
tunable structures, and customized functionality.
Natural and artificial organic polymer carriers are both types of organic polymer
carriers. Natural polymer carriers typically have low strength, good mass transfer
capability, and are not harmful to microorganisms. They can also be quickly
degraded by bacteria in anaerobic environments. Agar, gelatine, sponges, chitin,
alginate, and chitosan are typical natural polymer carriers. Figure 24.1 shows
various qualities of polymers. Agar-embedding cell procedure is easy to use and
also non-toxic to cells. It also has a wider clearance, permitting the passage of
high molecular compounds, but it has poor mechanical and chemical stability.
These polymers have high catalytic reaction rates per unit volume achieved by
high internal surface areas and active site densities. Possibilities for post-synthesis
modification of MOFs with complementary catalytic groups, enabling catalysis
by a variety of functional groups as well as tandem or bifunctional catalysis;
shape-selective catalysis, confinement effects for stabilizing encapsulated catalytic
species, placement of different catalytic groups next to each other or in separate,24.2 Characteristics of Organic Polymer 539

nearby environments are all possibilities for tailoring MOF pore structures to allow
for these things.
These appealing characteristics and the potential for large-scale catalytic applica￾tions, albeit none have yet been discovered to our knowledge, help to explain in part
the rapid expansion of research on MOF catalysis.
Synthetic organic polymer gel carriers exhibit excellent mechanical strength,
strong chemical stability, and good resistance to antimicrobial degradation.
However, transfer practice is subpar, and the embedding procedure will result in
decreased cell activity. Polyacrylamides, light-curing resins, polyvinyl alcohol, and
polyacrylic acid gel are typical synthetic organic polymer gel carriers (Chen and
Wang 2017). When heated over a particular critical temperature, which in turn
depends on their chemical structures, ORGANIC polymers break to give volatile
flammable compounds. If the gaseous mixture created when deteriorating volatiles
are mixed with air is within the range of flammability and the temperature is greater
than the ignition temperature, combustion will begin. An extremely complicated
process, the combustion of the polymeric substance involves a few interconnected
and/orindependentstepsthat take place in the condensed phase, the gaseous phase,
and at the interfaces between the two phases (Cullis and Hirschler 1981). Fires
utilizing organic polymers present substantially identical risks to those brought on
by fires fueled by other fuels. Other issues exist in addition to flammability and
property damage. Fire fatalities brought on by toxic gases and evolved smokes are
more significant, and they are sometimes made worse by toxic fumes released by
synthetic organic polymers (Levin 1992). To create stationary phases for HPLC,
organic polymers are utilized in a variety of ways.
The polymers can be created as monoliths or used as tiny particles, comparable to
those formed from hydrated silica. Additionally, some polymers can be utilized as
solid support that is further derivative to produce an active stationary phase, or they
can be employed as stationary phases as they are produced. Table 24.1 shows the
application of organic polymers in fuel utilization. The use of organic polymers as
stationary phase is quite prevalent for several particular forms of chromatography,540 24 Versatile Applications of Organic Polymer and Their Prospects

such as size exclusion or ion exchange. The polymers used as the stationary phase
in other HPLC methods, including reversed-phase, are less significant.
24.3 Methods and Preparation
Organic polymers can be prepared with the aid of diverse polymerization tactics. The
synthesis with the aid of mass polymerization includes a uniform system wherein
the testing agents, blended inside the medium of reaction, polymerize with the help
of radical reactions. The process ought to be done in an oxygen-free environment
since the occurrence of oxygen can put off the process of polymerization. The poly￾merization is caused with the aid of UV or heat, within the process it relies on the
employed monomer (da Silva et al. 2019). Numerous units can be used, according to
the desired software and interface with the analyte. Mass polymerization harvests
a stiff inflexible polymer grid, commonly, the product received is softened dehy￾drated, and, depending on its use, isolated with the aid of particle dimensions. Usu￾ally, organic polymers are providing constancy over an extensive pH range and low
density. To avoid the grinding step and firm matrix formation, it is conceivable to
embrace other synthesis procedures consisting of polymerization through suspen￾sion or via precipitation (da Silva et al. 2019). In the “bottom-up” method, func￾tional groups are included in heterotopic atom-doped porous organic polymers by
carefully creating and using special building blocks. There are two enticing ways
to satisfy the particular needs of synthetic materials. One is to add a variety of func￾tional groupsto pure monomers before high-yielding distillation. Thisis a very effec￾tive bottom-up synthesis technique. According to Sun et al. (2015) several func￾tional groups, such as –OH, –SO3H, and –COOH, have been productively impli￾cated in the skeleton of POPs. The well-maintained source material’s pore proper￾ties, which prevent pore clogging, are the method’s most obvious advantage. Utiliz￾ing monomer-containing hybrid components like carbazole, thiophene, and triph￾enylamine is another fantastic bottom-up approach. The addition of various ele￾ments (such as S, N, O, and P) improves the architectural complexity of POPs and
is also very helpful for the capture of metal ions because of the increased affini￾ties or sensitivity. To create a new sulfur-rich microporous polymer (SMP) with a
sulfur content of 31.4 weight percent, tetra(thiophene-2-yl) silane is utilized as a
functional monomer. The resultant SMP with the evenly dispersed sulfur atom and24.4 Properties and Characteristics of Organic Polymers 541
the very porous structure revealed a significant adsorption capability toward Hg2+
(595.2 mg g−1) as a result of the strong coordination interaction between soft acid
mercury and soft basic sulfur.
24.4 Properties and Characteristics of Organic Polymers
Organic polymers have been applied to every aspect of human life and play a cru￾cial role. They are now recognized as critical materials in the modern day, supply￾ing basic structural substances and participating in critical survival techniques. For
instance, the stable components of all plant life are made of polymers. These consist
of lignin, numerous resins, and cellulose. Lignin, a complex organic polymer, plays
a very important role in many biological functions, such as mechanical support, for￾mation of the cell wall, and water transport. Cellulose is a type of homopolysaccha￾ride found in plant cell wallsthat are composed of monosaccharide units containing
oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen atoms. Wood resins are plant materialsthat are highly
viscous and solid. It is a polymer of an easy hydrocarbon, isoprene. Rubber is other
known isoprene polymer.
Different prime natural polymers, including proteins (a polymer composed
of amino acids), serve a wide range of functions in living organisms, such as
transportation, defense, metabolism, and organization. In the nucleic acids
(composed of nucleotides) it is the complicated molecules made up of sugars,
nitrogen-containing bases, and phosphoric acid. Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA)
contains genetic material and plays a very significant role in protein synthesis.
Starch, a carbohydrate, is one of the primary sources of food for humans. For
the conversion, separation, and collection of CO2, POPs provide an intriguing
platform. Only a small number of POPs have so far been studied for the conversion
of CO2 into value-added chemicals, even though numerous POPs have already
been identified to absorb CO2. With our contribution, we hope to stimulate the
creation of fresh POPs for CO2 conversion and capture. Furthermore, due to their
specific qualities including stability, high porosity, vast surface area, and even
more accessible binding sites, COFs have been demonstrated to be particularly
successful at moving heavy metals. The synthesized N-enriched COF functioned
admirably, with a great significant adsorption capacity of 396 mg−1 and exceptional
efficacy in the elimination of cadmium. Additional advantages of the N-enriched
COFs have included ease of manufacturing, the absence of by-products, high
efficiency, cost effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. As a result, it could
serve as a possible adsorbent in the clean-up of environmental contaminants.
POPs are superior porous molecules for wastewater treatment because of their
distinctive crystalline properties, diverse topologies, and compositions. POPs
with configurable functionalization, programmable structures, and adjustable
pore size may be produced as a result of organic chemistry’s adaptability. These
characteristics, along with POPs’ outstanding thermal and chemical stability, have
given them the power to survive harsh conditions for future effective adsorption
applications. POPs are also projected to be of significant importance for wastewater542 24 Versatile Applications of Organic Polymer and Their Prospects
treatment shortly due to their simple separation processes and low energy needs.
It will be appealing to combine with other approaches like photocatalysis, which
converts extremely hazardous pollutants into non-toxic or less toxic chemicals
while also having a high removal efficiency, to achieve effective wastewater man￾agement. Due to the continued efforts of researchers from around the world, it is
projected that POPs will be able to function as adaptive adsorbent materials for
the efficient removal of various metallic ions in actual water samples in the next
years.
Organic polymers are mostly microporous varying with pore sizes. Their design
ability has to be performed in a controlled manner. Amorphous and Ionic organic
networks are amorphous, cannot be crystallized, while metal–organic frame￾works are highly crystalline. In the stability trend out of the four, amorphous
porous organic polymer is highest, followed by covalent and nanoporous ionic
organic polymer leaving metal–organic framework with the least stability in
comparison. Metal and covalent organic polymers can be self-assembled based
on their intermolecular interactions and bonding, However, amorphous porous
polymer requires condensation and nanoporous ionic networks require template
synthesis.
Whereas porous organic polymers have another advantage too,such as being used
in water purification or upgrading the water conditioning, and escalating the tempo
of settlement (Yadav and Sinha 2022).
24.5 Types of Organic Polymers
24.5.1 Porous Organic Polymers (POPs)
Porous organic polymers or porous polymers are multifaceted in nature and
composed of sturdy covalent linkages between various organic building blocks.
Because of their notable characteristics, like huge pore size, accurate balance, and
broad surface area robustness in various solvents, they recently turned out to be a
growing study subject in poroussubstances. These features of POPs are favorable for
mass transfer, providing more lively sites, and emerging as a promising platform for
the recycling process in photocatalysis. Porous organic polymers can be fabricated
reversibly or irreversibly (Figure 24.2). For reversible synthesis, Koil and organic
frameworks are utilized. However, for a reversible, we can perform Friedel–Crafts
alkylation, coupling of carbon bonds, imine formation, or cyclotrimerization
(Figure 24.3).
POPs are generally classified into two categories: amorphous polymers and
crystalline polymers. Further amorphous and crystalline organic polymers include,
under amorphous we have HCPs, CMPs, PIMS, and PAF (Table 24.2).
POPs soak up more or equal amounts of energy from photons than their gaps
between bands (Zhang et al. 2020a). In gasoline repositories and their detachment,
catalysis, photoelectric alteration, energy conversion and storage, and many others,
POPs have acquired an interest in research and attention due to their advantages of24.5 Types of Organic Polymers 543

24.5.2 Covalent Organic Polymer (COPs)
Covalent organic polymers are porous community polymers with permanent pores.
These permanent voids (in general, in a nano-porous place, with pore sizes underTable 24.2 Types of polymer dosage form.

100 nm) convey porous material properties including gasoline seizing and separa￾tion, water treatment, and catalysis (Zhang et al. 2021).
In general, COP grew accustomed to inspecting its multipurpose luminescent
programs. Taking benefit of the excessive permeability and fluorescence, the COP
became utilized as an especially sensitive and selective probe for the uncovering of
MnO4, TNP, and Fe3O4 (Zhang et al. 2021).
24.5.3 Nanomedicines
The convergence of nanotechnology and medicine has led to the interdisciplinary
field of nanomedicine. Improvement in molecular and cellular biology, genetics,
material science, proteomics, and bioengineering, all these sectors have contributed
to this emerging field, which deals on the nanoscale level with physiological pro￾cesses(Sara Soares et al. 2018). Nanoparticles(NPs) are key factors of nanomedicine,
and currently, a giant range of nanoparticle kinds exist.
An extensive style of nanoparticles and substances are utilized in nanomedicine,
the various maximum widely used are polymers, quantum dots (QDs), liposomes,
iron oxide (IO) debris, and carbon nanotubes.
24.5.4 Applications of Organic Polymer
Wide ranges of applications often take place in organic polymers in several fields
(Taheri et al. 2022).
1) Originally, natural polymers were used. For example wood,rubber, cotton, wool,
leather, silk.
2) Oldest known uses: Building materials, amber used forjewelry 13,000 years ear￾lier, clothing, rubber balls used by Mesoamericans 36,000 years earlier.
3) Energy storage film capacitors can also be fabricated from molecular chains or
dielectric polymeric chains of organic polymers. Along with this, these organic
polymers can be used for computerized calculations in concepts like machine
learning and genome materials shows fabrication of energy storage film capac￾itors through organic polymeric chains. These polymers are heat resistant and
hence are suitable for this.
4) Applications for synthetic organic polymers are increasing: Automobiles, jet
engines, when low weight is required, the addition of fibers, composites of glass
or carbon.
5) Nucleic acid organic polymer can be utilized for diagnostics, bio-fabrication of
biomedicines, etc. (Kwak and Herrmann 2010).
6) MOPs: Microporous organic polymer can be used for the application of hydro￾gen storage, methane storage, capturing, and separation of carbon dioxide
(Chang et al. 2013).
7) These have also been reported to be used in the field of agriculture, Massive
environmental strains brought on by population increase, the development of
massive, densely populated metropolises, and concurrent global industrializa￾tion may jeopardize environmental sustainability and food security.546 24 Versatile Applications of Organic Polymer and Their Prospects
8) Bioremediation: One of these microbial polymers that has shown promise
for complexing metal(loids) is bio-surfactant. They are metabolic compounds
that have amphiphilicity and surface activity. The formation of micelles or the
combination of these moieties at the interfaces of fluids with different polarities
is induced by this amphiphilic metabolite’s dual hydrophobic and hydrophilic
moieties, which lowers the interfacial surface tension. Bio-surfactants fre￾quently contain hydrophilic groups such as anions, cations, mono-, di-, or
peptides, amino acids, and polysaccharides. The hydrophobic groups are
made up of fatty acids, which can be branched, hydroxylated, saturated, or
unsaturated.
9) These have also been reported to be utilized in water treatment. Organic poly￾mers, which are long-chained macromolecules made up of multiple repeating
monomer units, are often utilized in modern water filtration. Theirtypical appli￾cation is in the primary coagulants or coagulant aids phases of the purification
of drinking water. In an aqueous suspension, these compounds tend to strongly
adsorb the particles on their surface. A faster rate of settling, cheaper costs,
better-quality treated water, and sludge dewatering capabilities are just a few
benefits of using organic polymers.
10) Nonetheless, the physical properties of the polymers used in these applications
are the main requirement as inert materials, such as transmission, reliability,
permeability, or weather ability, rather than being active molecules. Reactive
functionalized polymer science and technology is one of the most fascinating
fields of polymer chemistry for the creation of superior materials. Polymeric
molecules have been widely exploited as reactive materials because of the var￾ious active functional groups’ potential benefits and the compounds’ distinc￾tive properties. They are used in a wide range of technological fields, such as
solid-phase synthesis and physiologically active systems.
11) The polymeric biocide has numerous advantages, some of which include the
following: it can be applied at lower concentrations than conventional biocides.
The number of applications is reduced as a result of the prolonged duration of
activity brought on by a single application, which releases the required amount
of active agent over a lengthy period; and it does not require repeated appli￾cations. Its macromolecular design reduces the requirement for extensive dis￾persion of high levels of biocides in the environment, as well as degradation
and evaporation losses caused by environmental causes or waterways or leach￾ing into the soil. Additionally, because fewer active substances are required, it
reduces the toxicity, duration, and cost of repeated treatments. The foundation
of this concept is the use of appropriate polymers as carriers, where the resid￾ual by-products of polymer degradation act as fertilizer for the soil and plant
growth. For instance, condensation polymerization has been used to produce
and polymerize herbicide derivatives of bifunctional chemical conditions. The
idea behind the second attempt is to modify the fundamental characteristics of
sandy soil by connecting herbicides to polymeric hydrogels. These polymers’
principal purpose is to regulate the pace at which herbicides are delivered, but24.5 Types of Organic Polymers 547
they can also be very helpful in preventing quick leaching, which will improve
the amount of water that sandy soil can hold onto.
Bio-surfactants are components with varying structural characteristics that are
taken out of yeast or bacterial cell membranes. Both high- and low-molecular-weight
polymers, which are potent emulsifiers and can dramatically lower surface tension,
are present in these secondary metabolites. By emulsifying and dissolving these
hydrophobic chemicals or by changing the cell’s surface properties, hydrophobic
molecules’ bioavailability can be enhanced. Their production is regarded as a
crucial tactic to help microorganisms recover from the stress caused by pollutants.
They operate as mediators, increasing the pace at which hydrophobic chemicals are
transferred mass-wise by making them easily accessible to bacteria. Additionally,
they change the characteristics of cell membranes, increasing microbial adhesion.
This mechanism is essential when there are two immiscible liquids and substrate
uptake is likely.
The huge number of control that is used as a means of transporting herbicides
and for the removal of the leftover herbicide poses the main obstacles to the
cost-effective use of these polymeric herbicides, which may be hazardous to plants
and soil. The idea of transferring pesticides to biodegradable carriers comprising
polysaccharide-based agricultural wastes like bark, sawdust, cellulose, and other
cellulosic wastes has been put up in various attempts to minimize this issue.
The main disadvantages, however, are the challenges involved in the attempted
chemical modification of such naturally occurring polymers. Large concentrations
of these bioactive polymers, which are normally needed for herb control, will
therefore unavoidably be utilized. The pendant pesticide hydrolyzes more quickly
as a result of these polymers’ hydrophilic and cross-linking characteristics. Another
factor is their quick biodegradation in soil, which causes the polymeric matrix to be
swiftly dissolved and reduces the herbicide’s duration of action.
Recently the development of new strategies is made visible for more accuracy in
the quantitative establishment of polyelectrolytes in the range of 0.00002 N–0.005 N
concentrations (Wang et al. 1978). Synthesis of the polymer has key factors toward
CO2 to cancer treatment and vaccines, 3D printing, and non-flammable polymer
electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries (DeSimone et al. 2016). Biomedical appli￾cations involve the identification of tumor cells, and drug delivery using organic
polymer nano- and microparticles. The amalgamation of several modifications
scheme allows the fabrication multifunctional formation which contributes to
performing various chores at a specific time (Krug et al. 2019). Nanotechnology
including nanomedicines formed with organic polymer to help in therapeutic
modalities.
Standard methods of the polymers in drug-delivery system (Harris et al. 2019).
1) Diffusion-controlled system: The system includes the encapsulation, spray, and
dip coating in the pharmaceutical industry from years ago. The polymers used in
the system are rich in cellulose imitative such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and
poly N-vinyl pyrrolidone. To initiate drug delivery different devices swelling or
osmotically controlled devices, monolithic devices come under function.548 24 Versatile Applications of Organic Polymer and Their Prospects
2) Solvent-activated system: The system included two concomitantly moving fronts,
swelling and diffusion in the erosion front using cylindrical hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose (HPMC). The devices operate drug delivery as controlled
swelling under glassy to a rubbery state.
3) Biodegradable system: The important class of drug delivery is represented by
biodegradable and bio-erodible polymers. Surface or bulk processes take place
in both degradation and erosion. Ester derivatives like poly lactic/glycolic acid
or hydrolytic cleavage of ester bonds relied on the maximum biodegradable
synthetic polymers.
Dirt and metal(loids) are closely connected. This reduces the bioavailability of
bacteria; the cation exchange capacity, composition, pH, and particle size of the
soil all have an impact on the bio-surfactant–metal(loid) ion complex’s activities
in the soil, the kind and timing of contamination, and the geological pattern. Per￾sistent metal(loid) contamination causes soil bonding and metal(loid) ion stabiliza￾tion, which makesremediation challenging. A frequently used product forremoving
arsenic and other metals (Cu, Pb, and Zn) from mine tailings is the rhamnolipid
bio-surfactant JBR425. In an alkaline environment, they discovered that 0.1% of the
surfactant eliminated 148, 74, 2379, and 259 mg kg−1 of Pb, As, Zn, and Cu, respec￾tively.
24.6 Polymeric Co-delivery Systems in Cancer
Treatment
Cancer is the second most death-causing disease next to heart disease spread world￾wide with an increase in mortality rates. The pharmacological agents used to treat
disease are chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The issues regarding these therapies
are poor stability which causes rapid blood/renal clearance, low bioavailability, and
damage to the healthy tissues. The non-uniform biodistribution, difference in injec￾tion schedules, pharmacokinetic properties are involved to take benefit of drugs to
form molarratios(Pan et al. 2019). The activated moietiesinclude stimuli-responsive
drugs to increase the efficacy of the therapeutic system (Mahira et al. 2019).
The interconnection between neurons and external devices performs the function
of the nervous system which is diffused during disease. The rigidity of Parkinson’s
disease is used to implant basal ganglia for the treatment of brain blockage (Fat￾tahi et al. 2014). The nervous system contains neurons, extracellular matrix (ECM),
and glial cellsincluding nanoscale dimensions; the new intrinsic properties of nano￾materials show efficiency with the features and function of neural tissue. The cen￾tral and peripheral nervous system involved electrically active nanomaterials which
include silicon nanowires, carbon nanotubes, conducting polymer nanotubes, and
gallium phosphide nanowires. To identify the disorderin humans electroencephalo￾gram (EEG) signals range from 5 to 300 μV, <100 Hz, electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals range from 0.01 to 5 mV, <200 Hz are largely used. The examples include
biological uses for hydrogels, bioartificial organs, and tissue engineering.24.7 Recent Clinical Research of Organic Polymers 549
Additionally, granular activated carbon’s surface was functionalized with COP-19
and examined for its ability to remove ions of heavy metals and organic dyes. Within
30 minutes of contact, the activated carbon-covalent organic polymer(AC-COP) and
COP-19 demonstrated a strong affinity for azo dye adsorption. The way that metal
ions and sulfur groups interact in COP suspended in water.
There is no denying that the way of life that society currently leads to situations
where pollution and environmental deterioration are visible. It makessense that the
environment is a topic of discussion at conferences and forums where the major
international actors (politicians and business leaders) gather. However, the current
humanitarian crisis has come to a quality of polymers, up until now, had gone unno￾ticed: their potential for diversifying their uses and adapting as necessary. As fairly
extensively discussed by, numerous examples show how polymers have aided in the
protection of lives on numerous fronts in the struggle against the invisible foe, the
coronavirus. The purpose of the current work isto demonstrate how polymers can be
employed with already-accessible techniques to create lab test swabs and personal
protective utensils.
The COVID-19 outbreak has affected each productive sector, albeit to differing
degrees. Due to a lack of PPE, especially masks, which were previously only neces￾sary for health professionals but are now critical for the general people as a major
strategy of preventing the virus’ transmission, efforts are being made to develop PPE
from other materials. Companies and volunteers use unconventional resources to
supply the demand for these products, resulting in a movement that provides strong
evidence of economic circularity. One thing they had in common was the usage of
polymer materials, whether they were employed as virgin materials (raw materials
that had not yet been treated) or as recycled or used materials. Many polymers have
been created and/or modified using complex methods of organic synthesis, becom￾ing adaptable to different uses and circumstances. The pandemic catastrophe that
began in 2020 has demonstrated the importance of polymers in daily living, even
beyond consumption. By investing in mask producers, the Japanese government was
able to guarantee a monthly supply of more than 600 million masks. In addition,
businesses whose core competencies do not include producing PPE have instructed
their manufacturers to produce masks and other medical supplies. In this case, 1.7
million components are produced each day on 14 mask production lines built up by
the SAIC-GM-Wuling JV of the General Motors Company.
24.7 Recent Clinical Research of Organic Polymers
The repeating monomer units comprise macromolecules, i.e. organic polymers.
The main supremacy of organic polymer is its biosensing attribute in electrochem￾ical applications to identify biological fragments from human body (Kim et al.
2013). The recent use of polymers in divergent fields of present-day medicine has
created significant ways in tissue engineering, diagnostic and therapeutic methods.
Polymers play important role to check the rate of drug delivery, avert toxicity,
saving drugs from demeaning before release, targeting drug to the place of action,550 24 Versatile Applications of Organic Polymer and Their Prospects
and enhance absorption and therapeutic efficacy. Over the years the structure
and synthesis of multifunctional organic polymer makes them appropriate for
the storage of carbon dioxide. The reaction between 2,3,4-hydroxybenzaldehyde
and phenyl trichlorosilane in the presence of a base and further reacting with
benzidine with glacial acetic acid to obtain an organic polymer. Various phases of
clinical trials have been done to check the efficacy of therapeutics and determine
whether the formulation of organic polymer is safe or not. Phase 1 is generally

whether it is safe to use or not. Under Phase 2, the effectiveness of molecule is
observed and evaluated in correspondence to that particular disease. If no side
effect is observed, then it is considered as good to go for the third phase. In the
third phase we determine the efficacy and reactions of the molecule as a treatment
aid, and its long-term effectiveness is measured and observed (Figure 11). These
phases require time and consistent work under trials. It could take several years
to complete. These phases and purpose of clinical trials can be encapsulated in
Figure 24.4.
24.8 Current Scenario of Organic Polymers
In the current scenario polymer science is inescapable and relevant to emphasize its
role. The two Nobel Prizes awarded in the physical chemistry of polymeric systems.
Evolution still exists as classical thermodynamics approaches are examined and
fully authorized, while major rectification is being initiated during H-bonding
systems. Self and cross-interconnection are being ardently investigated by length￾ening available mean-field models to describe the system. Several efforts have
been committed in the way of research development of nanocomposites (classical
polymer-composite) (Kango et al. 2013). The highly cross-linked POPs, having
micropores, currently appear as a versatile program for disposition of catalysts
(Kaur et al. 2011).
24.9 Future Perspectives of Organic Polymer
The importance of polymers increases with the development of advanced electronic
gadgets and electric powersystem that hinge on dielectric film capacitors maximum
energy storage. Several perspectives of organic polymers in different ways are as
follows￾1) Porous organic polymers in solar cells: These are the unique materials of solar
cells. It describes the challenges for POPs from the photoactive layer to trans￾porting layer in the appearance of perovskite and dye-sensitized solar cells.
2) Porous organic polymers for light-driven organic transformations: The high spe￾cific surface area, less density, better stability, uniform pore size, and structural
versatility led to the strongest platform of heterogeneous photocatalysis.
3) Emerging porous organic polymers for biomedical applications. This shows the
vast applicationsin the biomedical departmentsuch as drug insertion, photother￾apy, bioimaging, and antibacterial applications.
24.10 Conclusion
Organic polymers have already been applied and are utilized in various applica￾tions of our day-to-day lives. These versatile applications of organic polymer are552 24 Versatile Applications of Organic Polymer and Their Prospects
because of their exceptional characteristics like porosity, design-ability, crystallinity,
stability, and bio-compatibility. These properties have enabled their applications
and enhancement in today’s world. Now these organic polymers are widely used in
chemical engineering, therapeutics, medical devices, and more. In addition to this,
their properties and some of applications are further explored in clinical research.
From the widely used biopolymer polypropylene to the naturally occurring biopoly￾mer found in the human DNA strand. Moreover, many scientists have even received
Nobel Prizes and various other recognitions while exploring and working on the
potential of these organic polymers. It has been estimated that these polymers may
even revolutionize the solar energy systems and can cure many other dreadful
diseases of the world by their exceptional properties.

25.1 Transdermal Drug Delivery System (TDDS)
and Current Scenario
A comprehensive assessment of the global TDDS market reveals a projected growth
trajectory of 6.39% CAGR from 2021 to 2027, leading up to a total market size of US$
8.7 billion by 2027. This promising growth rate standsin stark contrast to other more
traditional routes of drug administration such as oral, intravascular, subcutaneous,
and transmucosal. TDDS offers advantages that could gain greater attention as
researchers continue to explore novel ways of distributing drugs (Grand View
Research 2021). Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) is an advanced drug-delivery
technique, which enables the safe and consistent administration of biologically
active agents, such as medications or cosmeceuticals, via the skin. TDD has been
demonstrated to offer several beneficial outcomes in comparison to traditional oral
or intravenous formulations; primarily, the controlled release of drugs over time,
decreased first-pass metabolism, and fewer side effects. Additionally, the direct
administration of drugs via TDDS avoids the use of needle-based injections, which
can be painful for patients. TDDS has been proven with significant impact on the
delivery of Analgesics, Hormones, Cardiovascular, and central nervous systems
agents with therapeutic value (Jeong et al. 2021). TDDS provides a non-invasive,
safe, easy-to-use, and effective method for drug delivery, making it particularly
suitable for child and elderly patients(Sabbagh and Kim 2022; Prausnitz et al. 2004).
The inception of transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) in the United States
occurred in 1979. In 1996, nicotine patches were the first system to be implemented

extensively. Currently, there are nineteen TDDS available for such substances as
estradiol, fentanyl, lidocaine, and testosterone. Various drug combination patches,
iontophoretic, and ultrasonic delivery systems are available for contraception and
hormone replacement, as well as for the application of analgesia. TDDS exist for a
variety of substances including estradiol, fentanyl, lidocaine, and testosterone. The
average rate of new transdermal delivery systems being approved has more than
tripled in the past 5 years, with an average of one new system being approved every
7.5 months (Jeong et al. 2021).
25.2 Navigating the Complexities of Transdermal
Delivery
The skin is a complex biological barrier and presents many limitations in regard to
percutaneous drug delivery (Pastore et al. 2015). The outermost layer of the skin,
the stratum corneum (SC), is composed of a lattice of lipids and corneocytes, with
an approximate thickness of 20 μm of adult skin, which is roughly 3 mm thick in
total (see Figure 25.1). This renders the skin largely impermeable to most biophar￾maceuticals and small molecules (Erdo˝ et al. 2016) with only moderately lipophilic
compounds being able to penetrate through the barrier.
In order for a substance to traverse the stratum corneum and enter into the viable
epidermis, it must possess suitable hydrophilicity to enable adequate transdermal
delivery into the bloodstream (Prausnitz and Langer 2008; Sloan et al. 2011; Bos and
Meinardi 2000). However, employing TDDS may increase the possibility of localside
effects by changing the skin barrier. In some circumstances, these effects can vary
from skin irritation to allergic reactions. Managing the danger of unfavorable local
reactionsisthus a significant concern in TDDS (Barry 1991; Murphy andCarmichael
2000; Johnson 2007).
The range ofscientific techniques employed to develop a device capable of electro￾poration, sonophoresis, or iontophoresis may vary extensively on the basis of appli￾cation requirements. Depending on the specifics of the delivery problem at hand,
the complexity of the techniques chosen to develop a suitable device can range from

simple conductive material construction to the implementation of intricate neural
networks and advanced sensing technologies. In addition, developing a stable and
non-irritating formulation to deliver a specific molecule, leads to further obstacles
in TDD (Prausnitz and Langer 2008).
Furthermore, there are additional obstacles to achieving satisfactory patient
usability with TDDS. For instance, when creating matrix or reservoir patches, it is
crucial to design them to have minimal detachment and patch loss rates, which
can be particularly difficult to achieve in the context of once-weekly TDDS. On the
other hand, transdermal gels must be created in a way that limits the possibility
of the active ingredient being transferred to unintended recipients. In the design
of complicated devices, patient comfort and reducing skin irritation are of highest
importance. These are just a few instances of the challenges that a research team
could encounter while developing a novel transdermal medication (Goffin et al.
2000; Prausnitz et al. 2004; Karande et al. 2005).
Despite the difficulties, the development of TDDS throughout the previous five
decades has made progress. It becomes evident that there have been two key levers
used to create prospects for new transdermal drugs:
1) The process of identifying appropriate moleculesfrom the collection of drugsthat
have been approved.
2) Lowering the skin’s barrier capacity, particularly the SC layer, through several
methods such as chemical agents (penetration enhancers), biological techniques
(hydration/occlusion), or physical means (heat, ultrasound, etc.)
A closer examination of the current utilization of transdermal medicines reveals
that drug development research is currently focused on developing products with
low- or non-invasive administration of therapeutic molecules. Such development
involves multiple levers such as active, minimal and non-invasive approaches,
though details of their effectiveness remain uncertain. The recent emergence of
microneedle technology provides an avenue for novel transdermal products to be
realized through minimal disruption. Therefore, it is worthwhile to invest in such
technology and identify appropriate macromolecules to capitalize on, in order to
generate valuable new products (Paudel et al. 2010; Tiwary et al. 2007; Prausnitz
et al. 2004).
25.3 Structural Overview of Transdermal Delivery
Systems
The objective of TDDS relies on polymeric layers to form the system. TDDS are
composed of an outerimpermeable backing to ward off drug leakage, an inner adhe￾sive or rate-controlling membrane, along with additional layers of polymer mate￾rial. Depending upon the components involved, the systems are divided into three
categories: drug reservoirs, drug–polymer matrices, and polymeric laminates (see
Figure 25.2).558 25 Transdermal Drug Delivery and Organic Polymers: Current Scenario and Future Prospects

25.3.1 Key Optimizing Principles for Designing a Transdermal Delivery
System
25.3.1.1 Reservoir Systems
This system utilizes a pharmacological agent contained within an impermeable
backing layer and a rate-controlling membrane. The rate-controlling membrane,
which may be either microporous or nonporous in nature, is the only passage for
the release of the pharmacological agent. This reservoir of drug is filled with a
solution, suspension, or gel, or derived from a solid polymer matrix. An additional
hypoallergenic adhesive polymer helps to augment the outermost layer of the
reservoir (Stevenson et al. 2012).
25.3.1.2 Microreservoir Systems
A TDDS is developed by combining a drug reservoir and matrix-dispersion system.
The drug reservoir utilizes a water-soluble polymer to solubilize the medication,
forming an aqueous solution that is spread throughout a lipophilic polymer to pro￾duce microscopic spheres that contain the drug. The thermodynamic instability of
the suspension is stabilized via polymer cross-linking in situ to form a stable TDDS
(Omray et al. 2008).
25.3.1.3 Matrix Systems
The drug-in-adhesive or matrix delivery system takes advantage of a polymer-based
adhesive to create a drug-containing reservoir. This is achieved through the uni￾form distribution of drugs into the adhesive matrix, which is then applied onto an
impervious base layer through either solvent casting or melt processing. A compos￾ite adhesive structure isthen formed by layering additional non-medicated adhesive
matrix on top of the reservoir, thus forming a suitable matrix based drug-delivery
system (Aqil et al. 2003).
25.3.1.4 Matrix-Dispersion System
A polymeric matrix-dispersion system in either a lipophilic or a hydrophilic
variation is utilized to evenly distribute the drug. This matrix is then affixed to an
occlusive base plate via a separately produced drug-impermeable backing layer.
This ensures the secure placement of the drug depot. To complete the process, a
strip of adhesive encaging the edge of the reservoir holds the entire ensemble in
place (Akram et al. 2018).25.3 Structural Overview of Transdermal Delivery Systems 559

The area of transdermal drug delivery is currently experiencing an exponential
growth, owing largely to the advancesin polymerscience. This branch of drug deliv￾ery is rapidly advancing, and this chapter is dedicated to the selection of polymeric
materials used in such systems.
Polymers have been identified as essential components in the development of
effective transdermal drug-delivery systems due to their multifaceted physical and
chemical characteristics. Their flexibility, permeability, viscosity, and mechan￾ical strength provide desirable traits for formulators looking to create efficient
drug-delivery systems. A thorough analysis of the respective polymers enables
the formulator to identify the most suitable structural choices for their desired
application (see Figure 25.3).
25.3.1.5 Polymer Matrix/Drug Reservoir
Polymers are essential for the successful fabrication of a TDDS. These materials
must possess high stability, biocompatibility, and a low rate of reaction with the
drug itself and other components of the device. Additionally, easy fabrication of the
polymer into the desired shape and structure can be ensured by its non-toxic degra￾dation products that are not antigenic to the host organism (Kamaly et al. 2016).
Based on the sources, the polymers used for TDDS can be classified into two cat￾egories (Gutierrez Cisneros et al. 2021; Liechty et al. 2010; Bangar et al. 2014) as
follows.

polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, eudragits, ethylene vinyl acetate copoly￾mer, ethyl vinyl acetate, silicon rubber, etc.
25.3.2 Characterization of Drug Molecules for Transdermal Delivery
Drugs that possess specific characteristics are chosen for TDDS, as follows.
25.3.2.1 Characterization of Physicochemical Properties
The successful implementation of TDD treatments depends on the careful selec￾tion of pharmacologically active molecules with diverse criteria (see Figure 25.3).
For instance, the solubility of the molecules must be at least 1 mg ml−1 in both oil
and water, and the melting point should be below 200 ∘F to improve the membrane
concentration gradient. Additionally, the molecular weight should remain under
500 kD, while the pH of the aqueous solution should be between 5 and 9. Lastly,
for optimal results, the molecules should feature less than two hydrogen-bonding
groups. Systematically selecting molecules with these specific properties can ensure
the success of TDD treatments (Choudhary and Singh 2021; Prausnitz and Langer
2008).
25.3.2.2 Characterization of Biological Properties
In order to maximize efficacy, an ideal drug should have a potency of lessthan 25 mg
per day, a short biological half-life, and should neitherirritate nor cause allergic reac￾tions on contact with human skin. Additionally, it is desired for the drug to have
stability upon exposure, not elicit any immune responses, display a near zero-order
release profile in transdermal delivery and should not bind permanently to the sub￾cutaneous tissue or undergo metabolic changes in the skin. Moreover, to prevent
tolerance, the drug should be optimally formulated, and should not bind perma￾nently to the subcutaneous tissue or undergo any metabolic changes in the skin
(Choudhary and Singh 2021; Prausnitz and Langer 2008).
25.3.3 Investigating the Properties of Various Permeation Enhancers
for Transdermal Delivery
25.3.3.1 Chemical Permeation Enhancers
The stratum corneum consists of highly ordered intercellular lipid bilayers, which
can be disrupted by the introduction of amphiphilic molecules or the removal of
lipids. This interruption reversibly reduces the hindrance of resistance, permitting
the entry of drugs that are administered in unison (Prausnitz and Langer 2008). In
order for an enhancer to be effective, it should meet certain criteria. The desired
material must be inert, harmless, non-allergenic, and non-irritating. Moreover, it
should be able to operate in a unidirectional fashion and interact harmoniously with
the drugs and excipients it is associated with. The potency of the enhancer appears
to be affected by the type of drug, skin, and concentration (Williams and Barry
2004). Permeants, also known as permeation enhancers, are moleculesthat facilitate25.3 Structural Overview of Transdermal Delivery Systems 561
the passage of drugs or other substances through biological membranes, such as
skin or the gastrointestinal tract. Examples of permeants which are used to enhance
permeation include ethanol, which isthe most common, as well as essential oils and
terpenes such as cineole, carveol, menthone, citral, menthol, and d-limonene. In
addition, dimethyl sulfoxide, propylene glycol, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidine, ethyl pyrro￾lidine, polyethylene glycol 400, isopropyl myristate, myristic acid, succinic acid,
laurocapram(azone), methyl laureate, lauric acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, non-ionic
surfactants (spans, tweens), pluronic, oleic acid, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether,
and urea are also known to have permeating properties (Yu et al. 2021; Arora et al.
2017; Harrison et al. 1996; Walters and Hadgraft 1993; Wang et al. 1998).
25.3.3.2 Physical Permeation Enhancers
The physical approach of TDDS involves removing the stratum corneum and
hydrating it. Iontophoresis, sonophoresis, thermal energy, and electroporation are
the physical approaches used. Iontophoresis in particular holds a great potential
for drug delivery by using a low-voltage electric current to increase and regulate
drug permeation. This is achieved by two mechanisms: electrorepulsion, where the
electric field applied to the permeant causes it to disperse, and electroosmosis, due
to the negative charge of the skin at physiological pH (Dhote et al. 2012).
Stratum corneum (SC) is the foremost layer of the skin, playing the essential role
of a protective barrier between the body’sinterior and the exterior environment, lim￾iting the transdermal exchange of molecules between the two. This layer ranges in
thickness from 10 to 100 μm and is created of numerous layers of corneocytes (cells
crammed with keratin) and a lipid matrix, which presents a continuous medium.
The intercellular lipids consist of nearly identical proportions of ceramides, choles￾terol, and free fatty acids.
The skin is capable of absorbing substancesthrough three distinct pathways: inter￾cellular transport via corneocytes and lamellar lipids, intracellular uptake through
individual cells, and appendageal uptake through hair follicles, sweat ducts, and
exocrine glands (Park et al. 2019).
Sonophoresisis an innovative technique of permeating semi-solid topicalsinto the
epidermis. This is achieved by harnessing the power of sound waves and converting
ultrasonic vibrations into micro-vibrations. These micro-vibrations are effective in
raising the kinetic energy of topical agent molecules, resulting in increased perme￾ation rates of compounds through the epidermis. It currently has many potential
applications across medical fields such as drug delivery through the skin, as well as
in physical therapy and iontophoresis. The ultrasonic energy is transferred to the
skin through coupling agents such as gels, creams, and ointments. It is believed that
this process is enhanced by the effects of cavitation, microstreaming, and heating
(Park et al. 2019; Tawfik et al. 2021).
In the process of electroporation, high-voltage electrical pulses are applied to the
SC of the skin, creating temporary pores that enable increased transdermal delivery
of therapeutic drugs. This novel delivery method efficiently creates aqueous trails in
SC for drugs to permeate and significantly improving drug transfer into underlying
tissue (Gehl 2003). Erbium: Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet (Er: YAG) laser is implied562 25 Transdermal Drug Delivery and Organic Polymers: Current Scenario and Future Prospects
efficiently remove the SC layers of the skin through the application of a single pulse
of low energy (Arora et al. 2012). Ultrasound and microneedle treatments effectively
create minuscule pathways or channels within the external most layer of the epider￾mis, the stratum corneum. This allows drug products to penetrate the skin’s barrier
for therapeutic purposes, increasing the absorption of the medication (Singh et al.
2013).
25.3.3.3 Other Permeation Enhancers
Various strategies can be employed to enhance the permeability of the skin, includ￾ing ethanolic liposomes, niosomes, protransferosome gels, and prodrug approaches,
which facilitate the solubilization and diffusion of drugs into the skin (Dubey et al.
2007; Rai et al. 2017; Fang and Leu 2006).
25.3.4 Pressure-Sensitive Adhesives (PSAs)
The attachment of TDDS to the skin must be secure to ensure a regulated release of
the drug. To achieve this, pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are used. These PSAs
are hypoallergenic and non-irritating, allowing for easy and painless removal with￾out any residue. Polyacrylate, polyisobutylene, and silicones are the most commonly
used PSAs in TDDS, providing a necessary skin–drug interface for long-term drug
delivery (Tan and Pfister 1999; Lobo et al. 2016).
25.3.5 Optimization of Suitable Backing Membrane
To ensure optimal performance, it is essential to select the right backing materials
for use in skin adhesives. Polyolefins, polyesters and elastomers are the most
common material used for this purpose, and are available in clear, pigmented,
or metalized form. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been identified as the
optimal material for backing materials used in many skin-related applications.
This is owing to its elastomeric nature, which far surpasses that of polyester in
regard to its contouring and adhesion properties, while enabling enhanced skin
intricacies. To further enhance the performance of the backing material, it must
exert a low water-vapor-permeable rate, so as to ensure improved skin hydration
and permeation.
The selection of backing materials for topical drug-delivery systems is a critical
step in enabling suitable performance for the desired application. Low-density
polyolefins, polyesters, and elastomers are commonly employed, often in clear, pig￾mented, or metalized forms that possess the flexibility and tensile strength required
for proper functioning. Elastomeric low-density polyethylene is often favored due
to its superior adhesion and greater flexibility in comparison to other materials
such as polyester. The backing material used for any transdermal skin delivery
system should provide several beneficial properties,such aslow modulus, enhanced
flexibility, high oxygen transmission, and a high moisture vapor transmission rate.
These properties will enable the device to transferthe corresponding drug efficiently
and provide excellent comfort. Vinyl, polyester films, polyester-polypropylene25.3 Structural Overview of Transdermal Delivery Systems 563
films, polypropylene and polyethylene resins, polyurethane, Co Tran 9722 film,
ethylene-vinyl acetate, and aluminized plastic laminate are some of the materials
which have ideal characteristics designed to optimize the performance of the
transdermal patch. Furthermore, these materials should also have low water vapor
transmission to retain skin hydration and ensure proper permeability. In addition,
the backing material should be heat-sealable to ensure form–fill–seal packaging of
the drug reservoir (Zhan et al. 2015; Sharma 2018; Liu et al. 2014).
25.3.6 Release Liner
The TDDS patch incorporates a release liner for secure fixation on the skin. The
liner material commonly incorporates non-occlusive substrates such as paper fab￾ric, or occlusive substances including polyethylene and polyvinylchloride, with a
release layer crafted from silicon. To facilitate the patch attachment, this liner must
be carefully removed before applicability (Wokovich et al. 2010).
25.3.7 Other Excipients
The combination of water, ethanol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl alcohol, and
dichloromethane can be utilized for the production of a drug-containing reservoir
for transdermal drug delivery. This combination of solvents can either be used
in individual form or in combination to achieve optimized results (Prodduturi
et al. 2009; Rastogi and Yadav 2012). The efficacy of transdermal delivery systems
can be improved by adding permeation enhancers in combination with two
co-solvents, such as propylene glycol and ethanol. Moreover, the incorporation
of plasticizers, such as diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, glycerol, triethyl
citrate, polyethylene glycol 400, eudraflex, and propylene glycol, can improve the
flexibility of the patch. The Androderm product by TheraTech Inc./SmithKline
Beecham is formulated with a drug reservoir of alcohol and glyceryl monooleate,
which is gelled with an acrylic acid copolymer. This is backed by a metalized
polyester/ethylene methacrylic acid copolymer/EVA polyethylene microporous
membrane, with a peripheral acrylic adhesive and a release liner of silicone-coated
polyester. Estraderm by Alza/Ciba Geigy utilizes a drug reservoir compounded with
a combination of hydroxypropyl cellulose, alcohol, and light mineral oil, which
is held in place by a polyester/polyethylene composite EVA copolymer with 5%
vinyl acetate and PIB adhesive. The reservoir is then lined with a silicone-coated
polyethylene terephthalate release liner for optimal release. The Testoderm TTS
product by Alza contains a drug reservoir of drug and alcohol gelled with HPC, and
is backed by a polyester/EVA copolymer, with a PIB adhesive and a silicone-coated
polyester release liner. The Transderm Nitro product by Alza/Ciba Geigy is a patch
containing a drug reservoir made up of a combination of lactose, colloidal silica,
and silicone oil, which is backed by a polyfoil EVA copolymer with a flesh-like
color. The patch is further equipped with a silicone adhesive and a fluorocarbon
polyester film release liner (Hanumanaik et al. 2012).Table 25.1 Different approaches for transdermal delivery and potential drug candidates.

The TDDS is broadly categorized mainly in two types depending upon their per￾meability pathway through the skin, (i) Active Pathway and (ii) Passive Pathway. The
active transdermal drug-delivery system necessitates external stimulation, which
can include electrical, mechanical, or physical means, to enables the drug to per￾meate through the different layers of the skin. In contrast, the passive TDDS does
not necessitate the utilization of external stimuli. However, it entirely depends upon
the physicochemical property of the drug molecule. These two classes are also fur￾ther classified depending upon the techniques implied to improve skin permeation
are shown in Table 25.1 (Jeong et al. 2021).
25.4 Exploring Different Organic and Synthetic
Polymer-Based Strategies for Transdermal Drug Delivery
25.4.1 Cellulose
Cellulose is a natural polymer found in many organisms, yet its insolubility in water
and othersolvents has hindered its use in hydrogel-based applications. To tackle this
issue, numerous cellulose derivatives have been synthesized and incorporated with
cross-linking agents to enhance solubility. Examples of such derivatives include
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose,
carboxyethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and ethyl cellulose. HPMC is a
widely used cellulose derivative that has been found to be advantageous in the
pharmaceutical industry due to its biodegradability, availability, and ease of use.
HPMC is often employed as a matrix for drug delivery in both films and gels,
with its remarkable swell ability influencing the drug release kinetics. To confirm
this, Prajapati et al. (2011) conducted a study to investigate the potential of using
a transdermal patch with solvent-casting technique and HPMC as the polymer
matrix to deliver Repaglinide. The results of the study revealed the effectiveness
of the patch in transporting the drug. This patch was demonstrated to be efficient
in minimizing recrystallization probabilities and promoting the drug loading ratio
(Esuendale and Gabriel 2016).
25.4.2 Dextran
Dextran is a branched polysaccharide composed of glucose molecules that is
synthesized either chemically or through microbial fermentation. It is widely
employed in medical applications, such as in the treatment of hypoglycemia and
hemorrhage, due to its high water solubility and ability to form stable colloidal
solutions. Its structure is composed of a large number of hydroxyl groups, which,
when combined with a specific cross-linker, form hydrogels. In a study Nematpour
et al. (2019) incorporated electrospinning to craft a transdermal patch. This was
achieved through the utilization of dextran, graphene oxide (GO), and polycapro￾lactone (PCL). The composition of the patch includes an inner layer loaded with
tetracycline-incorporated GO atop dextran nanofibers, shielded by an external566 25 Transdermal Drug Delivery and Organic Polymers: Current Scenario and Future Prospects
hydrophobic PCL layer to restrict moisture penetration. Despite its advantageous
components, dextran is not exempt from certain drawbacks such as its elevated cost
and susceptibility to induce more serious anaphylactic reactions compared to starch
and gelatin. These responses of dextran-reactive antibodies to elicit vasoactive
mediator release can be attenuated through pre-treatment with a hapten. This is
due to the ability of the hapten to interfere with the antibody–antigen binding,
thereby preventing the instigation of the immunological response (Ahn et al. 2020).
25.4.3 Chitosan
Chitosan, a naturally occurring polysaccharide derived from chitin, is a highly
versatile biopolymer that exhibits a plethora of advantageous characteristics. Its
bifunctional and biodegradable nature make it an attractive material for a gamut
of biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, such as tissue engineering, drug
delivery, and membranes. Furthermore, due to its abundance in nature, chitosan is
the second most abundant biopolymer after cellulose. Nevertheless, its solubility in
acidic solvents due to the protonation of its free amino groups, weak mechanical
properties, water resistance and low thermal stability, limit its potential applica￾tions. To improve these features, chitosan is often blended with other synthetic or
natural polymers, and this combination has been shown to be beneficial (Nair 2019).
Castilla-Casadiego et al. (2022) used chitosan and meloxicam for the fabrication of
microneedle patches with uniform measurements and precise arrangement.
25.4.4 Silicone
Silicone-based coatings can be applied to film substrates to create release liners,
which impart a protective layer to adhesive surfaces. These liners facilitate handling
of the substrate and optimize the delivery of materialsfor coating. The application of
the silicone coating can be performed on a single side or both sides of the film sub￾strate (Aliyar and Schalau 2015). Panchaxari et al. (2013) developed a transdermal
patch containing diclofenac diethylamine (DDEA) and studied in detail. This patch
is composed of both silicone and acrylic adhesives, and is known to have a success￾ful effect in transporting the active ingredient through the skin and has been shown
to be effective in delivering the active ingredient transdermally. The patch has been
tested and characterized in orderto determine its efficacy and safety in use. This new
patch could provide an effective and safe alternative to otherforms of administration
of DDEA, such as oral or injectable forms.
25.4.5 Acrylic Polymers
The composition of acrylic polymers consists of various elements, such as acrylic
acid, cyanoacrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and their respective esters, including acry￾lamide and acrylonitrile. Among the esters of methacrylic acid, methyl methacrylate
is the most widely used in the fabrication of medicinal devices. Although acrylics25.4 Exploring Different Organic and Synthetic Polymer-Based Strategies 567
are highly resistant to lipids, they provide no protection against organic solvents. To
address this drawback, the use of acrylic blends and copolymers can be employed to
enhance resilience to soaps and salt water. By adjusting the proportions of the two
polymers or comonomers in the mix, it is possible to mitigate this issue (Khandavilli
et al. 2002). Verma have explored the potential of drugs like nicotine, scopolamine,
trimegestone, isosorbide dinitrate, tacrine, and hydrocortisone to be delivered via
the skin by using acrylic polymers such as Eudragit R, Eudragit NE, Eudragit E100
and Eudragit L100 (Verma 2016).
25.4.6 Styrene-Block-(Ethylene-co-Butylene)-Block-Styrene (SEBS)
Copolymers
SEBS copolymers are renowned for their biocompatibility, as well as their range of
advantageous properties. Without the need for vulcanization post-molding, these
materials are able to achieve high levels of tensile strength, with values up to 3000 psi
attainable without the use of fillers. An additional benefit of SEBS copolymers is
their small domain size, which allows for both opaqueness and transparency. How￾ever, their physical cross-links enabled by hard blocks are subject to mobility in
higher temperatures (Paglicawan and Celorico 2021). Gennari et al. conducted a
study to evaluate the possibility of employing elastomers for the fabrication of trans￾dermal patches. The formulations employed were evaluated for biopharmaceutical
and adhesive properties, and those that were deemed suitable for this purpose were
further explored. The study revealed the potential of utilizing SEBS block copoly￾mers for engineering of transdermal patches (Gennari et al. 2020).
25.4.7 Polycaprolactone (PCL)
Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a low-cost, non-toxic synthetic polyester that has been
widely utilized in biomedical applications. It offers a glass transition temperature of
−60 ∘C. The melting point of PCL was found to be 60 ∘C. Typically PCL synthesized
via a ring-opening polymerization reaction of ε-caprolactone and can be degraded
by enzymes such as esterases and lipases found in microorganisms. However, the
limited degradation rate and lack of bioactivity restrict its applications. In order to
improve the degradation rate and bioactivity of PCL, researchers have implemented
strategies such as incorporating inorganic materials like calcium silicate, hydrox￾yapatite, bioglass, and calcium phosphate into PCL-based composites and blending
natural polymers like gelatin, starch, and zein into the same. These approaches
have been shown to result in enhanced degradability and bioactivity of PCL-based
composites (McKeen 2017). The development of nanocomposites made from tetra￾cycline/graphene oxide (GO) loaded dextran/polycaprolactone (PCL) has opened
up new biomedical applications, such as wound dressings. The composite materials
are designed with a hydrophobic PCL layer which prevents moisture from entering
the inner layers. Graphene has attracted attention for its remarkable electrical, ther￾mal, and mechanical properties and has been used to create nanocomposites with568 25 Transdermal Drug Delivery and Organic Polymers: Current Scenario and Future Prospects
impressive flexural strength and mechanical properties. Additionally, nanocompos￾ites consisting of GO and PCL prepared with an in situ grafting approach have been
found to be highly soluble in polymer solvent (Nematpour et al. 2019).
25.4.8 Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are chemically composed of 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone
linear molecules and characterized as synthetic polymer. Its non-ionic and
water-soluble character allows it to be highly suitable for variety of industries, like
cosmetics, medicine, and pharmaceutical industries. PVP featured with several
beneficial attributes including excellent water solubility, exceptional binding
capacity with resins and polymers, and non-toxic biocompatibility. Additionally,
PVP is hygroscopic, meaning it has the ability to absorb water from the atmosphere
(Hiremath et al. 2019). Despite its many benefits, there are some potential reported
events of allergy, pseudorheumatoid nodules a distinct type of subcutaneous
granulomas common in children, altering the pulmonary vascular arrangement,
and accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system have all been linked to this
polymer and its derivatives. This can limit the amount of this ingredient that can
be used in products. It is important to not use a high molecular weight of PVP and
to avoid multiple applications in the same area. One of the major drawbacks of
PVP is its hygroscopicity, making it challenging to store. To improve the tackiness
of PVP, acetylated monoglycerides can be added to the coating solution. PVPs are
not biodegradable, which makes them unsuitable for parenteral administration.
To mitigate this issue, only pyrogen-free PVPs of low molecular weight can be
used as they can be eliminated by the kidneys (Kurakula and Rao 2020). Swetha
et al. formulated a transdermal patch composed of rivastigmine tartrate by using
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and ethylcellulose (EC) in different molar ratios of one
to one, one to three and one to five, respectively, with 30% dibutyl phthalate as a
plasticizer (Vennapoosa and Sandeep 2013).
25.4.9 Sodium Alginate
Sodium alginate is a biodegradable, non-toxic, biocompatible, and water-soluble
anionic macromolecule with a range of advantageous properties. It can be engi￾neered through a combination of physical process and chemical processes. To modify
the sodium alginate hydrophilic, vinyl monomers can be used for graft copoly￾merization or through blending with functional components. Additionally, when
sodium alginate reacted with divalent ions like Ca2+, it shows liquid gel transforma￾tion making it a popular choice in tissue engineering and drug delivery. Despite its
advantages, alginate suffersfrom some drawbacks,such aslimited mechanical prop￾erties and ion leaching, leading to instability. Moreover, due to the exchange of freely
available monovalent cations in the surrounding medium, ionically cross-linked
alginate gels are not suitable for long-term stability in physiological conditions (Lee
and Mooney 2012). Recently developed transdermal lamivudine patch (LAM) by
Ramadan et al. reported using a tri-polymeric combination of sodium alginate,25.5 Conclusion and Future Prospects 569
methylcellulose, and chitosan to form matrix-like construction to facilitate effective
transdermal drug delivery, as it enabled successful penetration of LAM through
rat skin and into the bloodstream. It resulted with a sustained drug release in the
bloodstream for up to six days, suggesting that this transdermal delivery system has
the potential to extend the biological half-life of LAM (Ramadan et al. 2018).
25.4.10 Pullulan
Pullulan, a polysaccharide-based organic polymer, namely structured with mal￾totriose units covalently attached with other three maltotriose units by α-1,6
glycosidic bonds. It is extensively utilized due to its impressive water solubility. The
terminally active functional bonds allow it to exert a range of chemical properties.
These functional groups can be manipulated to produce a partially soluble or com￾pletely insoluble product in water. Such versatility makes it suitable for numerous
industrial applications as adhesive materials or as adhesive film due itslow-viscosity
and highly water-soluble properties. Additionally, its solubility can be engineered
to regulate drug-delivery system and the release kinetics of drugs molecules in
plasma to obtain desired drug release profile in pre-determined rate. However,
the use of pullulan films possesses some drawbacks, such as a difficult processing
process, brittleness, and a lack of water resistance. To enhance its performance
for various purposes, a cross-linking reaction is commonly adopted (Prajapati
et al. 2013). Lalitkumar et al. have recently engineered dissolvable microneedle
patches constructed from pullulan. In vitro examinations have indicated that these
microneedles can be proficiently used to delivering low- to high-molecular-weight
drugs through the epidermis. Additionally, the biomolecules were established to
be secure in the gels used to construct the pullulan microneedles, and the physical
properties of these microneedles were deemed to be sufficiently promising. These
discoveries suggest that pullulan microneedles could be a feasible option for
transdermal delivery of biomolecules (Vora et al. 2020).
25.5 Conclusion and Future Prospects
The chapter “Transdermal Drug Delivery and Organic Polymers” has elucidated
the growing prevalence of transdermal drug delivery in the medical sector and its
capacity to revolutionize the manner in which drugs are administered. Additionally,
the examination has also highlighted the significance of organic polymers in the
formulation of effective transdermal systems. Organic polymers provide a number
of advantageous features such as biocompatibility, convenience of biodegradability,
and cost-effectiveness, all of which make them highly desirable for transdermal
drug-delivery systems. Ultimately, the review has identified a diversity of obstacles
that must be addressed to ensure the successful development and utilization
of TDDS.
Going forward, the development of TDD and organic polymer technologies will
remain paramount. To achieve this, it is essential to further refine the character￾istics of numerous organic polymers and apply them to the creation of reliable570 25 Transdermal Drug Delivery and Organic Polymers: Current Scenario and Future Prospects
transdermal drug-delivery systems. Moreover, research must be conducted to create
novel materials that are capable of delivering a broad spectrum of medications
safely and efficiently. With sustained effort, it is expected that transdermal drug
delivery and organic polymers will keep contributing to the progress of a gamut of
medical treatments.
