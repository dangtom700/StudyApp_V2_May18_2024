Introduction 
Performance optimization of parallel manipulators (PMs) has attracted adequate 
attention in recent years. It mainly concerns performance indices, optimization algo￾rithms, and optimization methods. This chapter presents an in-depth, comprehensive, 
reasoned overview for the three basic issues. The research status and existing prob￾lems of these issues along with the distinctive approaches that have been explored are 
reported. Advantages, disadvantages, application scenarios, and recommendations 
of various performance indices, optimization algorithms, and methods are discussed. 
Focus is also placed on future research trends. The results are useful for researchers 
and engineers to properly select performance indices, optimization algorithms, and 
optimization methods when designing a PM. 
1.1 Research Background 
The general approach to the considered problems lies in the fact that robot-related 
performance indices present scalar functions synthesized from matrix models, and 
among them, the most important are the Jacobian matrix, stiffness and compli￾ance matrices, and mass matrix separately formulated within the static and dynamic 
versions. The general specific feature of these matrices is the dimensional inho￾mogeneity resulting in the absence of matrix eigenvalues. This feature is valid 
for matrices associated with both parallel- and serial-kinematic mechanisms; thus, 
this feature allows the application of some results formulated for serial-kinematics 
robots to be applied to parallel-kinematics robots. Additionally, this is the reason 
for the widespread application of the matrix determinants when synthesizing perfor￾mance indices since the determinant presents a unique invariant of a dimensionally 
inhomogeneous matrix.

12 1 Introduction
Researchers and industries have studied parallel manipulators (PMs) over the past 
two decades due to their excellent dynamic performance, high agility, high load￾to-weight ratio, distributed joint error, and simple inverse kinematics. A parallel￾kinematics robot named the Gough–Stewart platform (GSP) was utilized as the 
subject for scientific investigations in two fundamental works by Stewart [1] and 
Gough [2]. In the fundamental work by Merlet [3], more than 600 issues relating 
to PMs were comprehensively analyzed. PMs for engineering applications have 
been designed and commercialized. Commercially successful parallel robots mainly 
include Delta robots [4], which are for high-speed pick-and-place operations that are 
required in food and pharmaceutical industries; a Tricept robot based on a 3UPS-UP 
PM [5]; a Sprint Z3 spindle head based on a 3PRS PM [6]; and an Exechon robot 
based on a 2UPR-SPR PM, which is applied in the automobile and aviation industries 
[7], where U is the universal joint, S is the spherical joint, R is the revolute joint, and 
P is the prismatic pair. 
Comprehensive reviews relating to PM performance indices were considered in 
works [8] and [9]. The PM design is the primary basis for a parallel robot system. 
Type synthesis is used to propose an architecture satisfying the requirements of 
modern processing technology. Then, a dimensional synthesis of the mechanism is 
completed based on the selection of performance indices, optimization algorithms, 
and optimization methods. The primary condition of the optimization design of 
PMs is to establish reliable and computationally efficient performance indices that 
affect the final working performance and optimal design efficiency of the parallel 
robot system. Therefore, the following aspects of performance indices are issues of 
concern in industry and academia: determining a mathematical model between the 
performance indices and design parameters of a PM, exploring the workspace of a PM 
[10, 11], kinematic performance [12, 13], stiffness performance [14, 15], dynamic 
performance evaluation methods [16, 17], and establishing reasonable performance 
indices with clear physical significance. 
The optimum selection of a structure for a given application is a capital phase 
in the typological synthesis of parallel robots [18], and the main components can 
include a mathematical model of the optimization design containing design param￾eters, performance indices (objective functions), and constraint functions; optimiza￾tion algorithms, and an evaluation of the optimized results. Studies have found that 
there may be conflicts among the performance indices of PMs [19]. Engineering 
applications often require optimal comprehensive performance of a mechanism, 
which cannot be satisfied by a traditional single-objective optimization design. There￾fore, a multi-objective dimensional optimization design [20–22] can improve the 
comprehensive performance of a mechanism. Reasonable optimization algorithms 
and a comprehensive evaluation of the optimization results are vital to determining 
optimal design parameters. Exploring efficient and global optimization algorithms 
and methods for multi-objective comprehensive optimal solution evaluations remain 
challenging issues in industry and academia. 
There are many studies that address performance measures and optimization 
design of parallel robots, but there has been no review of the performance indices, 
optimization algorithms, and optimization methods of PMs. This book studies these1.2 Performance Evaluation Indices 3
three aspects to provide a reference for researchers in related research. In addition, the 
existing research problems and challenges are analyzed to promote related research. 
1.2 Performance Evaluation Indices 
Establishing reasonable performance indices is the basis for the performance 
measures and dimensional design of PMs. Reasonable performance indices can 
significantly improve the final working state of a parallel robot system. Existing 
performance indices mainly examine the workspace, kinematic performance, stiff￾ness performance, and dynamic performance. 
1.2.1 Workspaces 
The workspace is a collection of points that the end effector can reach under the 
constraints of rod length, joint rotation angle, and interference. Workspace-related 
performance indices are used to analyze the shape and size of the workspace of the 
mechanism and provide a theoretical basis for determining the operating space and 
planning the trajectory of the robot. Compared with the serial mechanism, PM has 
a major disadvantage in a smaller workspace. The work of Merlet [8] and Tlusty 
et al. [23] demonstrate this disadvantage. Therefore, developing effective tools for 
determining and enlarging workspaces has become the primary task of PM research. 
The workspaces of PMs mainly concern reachable workspaces, regular 
workspaces, and dexterous workspaces. For a PM with mixed degrees of freedom 
(DOFs), the workspace can be further divided into a position workspace (workspace 
with a constant posture) and a posture workspace (workspace with a constant posi￾tion). At present, the commonly used methods for PM workspace analysis mainly 
concern geometric methods, numerical discrete methods, and modern mathematical 
methods. 
The workspace is usually evaluated in terms of its shape and size; the former 
mainly includes the space utilization index, compactness index, and shape index, and 
the latter refers to the volume or area of the reachable/regular/dexterous workspace. 
1.2.1.1 Reachable Workspace Volume 
A reachable workspace refers to the points that a moving platform can reach from at 
least one direction under the physical constraints of a mechanism. 
A geometric method can split a multi-closed-loop PM into several subchains, and 
the workspace can be reduced to the intersection of each subchain trajectory under 
constraint conditions. Zhang et al. [24, 25] used a geometric method to analyze the 
reachable workspace of 3-DOF PMs. Regarding an n-DOF PM with more than 34 1 Introduction
DOFs, the workspace can generally be obtained by fixing its n-3 DOF. Gosselin [26] 
considered a driving limit constraint and analyzed the end effector position workspace 
in the constant posture of a 6-DOF PM based on the geometric method. Merlet [27] 
further introduced bar interference and joint constraint conditions based on Gosselin’s 
work. Liu et al. [28] used an AutoCAD platform to analyze the reachable workplace 
of a 6RTS PM. The advantage of the geometric method is that the boundary of the 
reachable workspace can be obtained through the intersection of the motions of each 
open-loop subchain. However, this method requires a separate geometric model for 
each mechanism, with disadvantages such as having difficulties in discerning holes 
in workspaces and calculating the analytical expressions of the regular workspaces 
of complex PMs. 
The numerical discrete method, known as the binary method, is most commonly 
used to calculate the workspace of a mechanism by judging whether each discrete 
point meets the kinematic solution, constraints, and interference conditions one by 
one. It mainly includes grid, Monte Carlo, and interval analysis methods. The grid 
method first creates a complete discrete boundary space containing all possible points 
in the workspace and then checks whether each grid node satisfies the inverse kine￾matics solution and mechanism constraints. The grid method is easy to use. However, 
the accuracy of the grid method depends on the number of nodes, as the node density 
increases, the computational cost exponentially increases, resulting in a low calcula￾tion efficiency. Due to the complexity of the direct kinematics of PMs, engineering 
applications mainly use inverse kinematics for numerical discrete methods [29]. 
Cheng et al. [30] used the spherical coordinate method and numerical discrete method 
to search and analyze the reachable workspace of a 3RPS PM layer by layer. Carbon 
et al. [31], Chi et al. [32], and Huang et al. [33] used the polar coordinate method to 
calculate the numerical expression of the reachable workspace volume, which was 
then used as one of the objective functions to be optimized. 
The Monte Carlo method, similar to the grid method, calculates the volume of the 
workspace by judging whether each discrete point satisfies the solution of the mecha￾nism under the constraint conditions. The difference is that the Monte Carlo method 
randomly generates a large number of discrete points in a regular and complete 
workspace and then calculates the volume of the reachable workspace by calculating 
the ratio of the number of discrete points satisfying the kinematic solution of the 
mechanism to the total number of discrete points. Zhu et al. [34] used the Monte 
Carlo method to analyze the reachable workspace of a spraying robot. Andrioaia 
et al. [35] analyzed the shape and volume of the workspace of a Delta PM based on 
the Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo method improves the computational cost 
of grid method to some extent through a statistical simulation method. Notably, this 
method requires a larger simulation sample to achieve smaller errors, which means a 
higher computational cost. Therefore, the Monte Carlo method cannot significantly 
improve the efficiency of calculating the workspace volume. 
An accumulation of floating-point calculation errors may lead to meaningless 
calculation results. Therefore, the interval analysis method expands point discretiza￾tion to interval discretization and the obtained interval contains accurate results, 
which enhances the stability and computational efficiency of the algorithm [36].1.2 Performance Evaluation Indices 5
Saputra et al. [37], Kaloorazi et al. [38], and Viegas et al. [39] analyzed the reachable 
workspace of Gough–Stewart, 3RPR, 6UPS, and 3PUR PMs based on interval anal￾ysis. The accuracy of the interval analysis method depends on the size of the block 
interval, and it is difficult to find small holes in the workspace unless the size of the 
block interval is smaller than the size of the hole; however, smaller block intervals 
will significantly increase the computational cost of the workspace volume. 
In addition to the geometric method and numerical discrete method, many 
researchers have discussed workspace solutions based on modern mathematical tools; 
here, these tools are collectively referred to as modern mathematical methods. Huang 
et al. [40] used differential geometry to analyze the workspace of a Stewart parallel 
robot. The envelope theory of a single-parameter curved-surface family was used to 
propose an efficient algorithm for solving the boundary of the workspace with the 
cross-sectional method. Alp et al. [41] analyzed the posture workspace of a Stewart 
PM using the neural network algorithm. Saputra et al. [37] used the bee colony algo￾rithm to analyze the 2D, 3D, and 6D reachable workspaces of a Gough–Stewart PM 
and compared the results with those from interval analysis. These methods provide 
new ideas for analyzing a PM workspace. 
1.2.1.2 Regular Workspace Volume 
Irregular workspaces are not conducive to trajectory planning and programming 
control, and some properties of the mechanism may be "ill-conditioned" at the 
boundary of the reachable workspace. Therefore, more attention is given to regular 
workspaces to meet specific applications and to facilitate trajectory planning and 
control in engineering applications. The main forms of regular workspaces (also 
called useful workspaces) mainly concern cylinders, cuboids, ellipsoids, and spheres, 
all of which belong to a subset of reachable workspaces. 
Babu et al. [22] adopted polar coordinate and grid methods to calculate the 
maximum inscribed regular cylindrical workspace volume. Bounab et al. [42] calcu￾lated the regular spherical workspace volume of a Delta PM based on the grid method. 
Yang et al. [19, 43, 44] and Zhang et al. [45] used grid and polar coordinate methods to 
analyze the volume of a regular cylindrical workspace [19], an ellipsoidal workspace 
[43], and a circular-table workspace [44, 45] for PMs. The numerical discretization 
method can solve almost any workspace shape and can be combined with program￾ming to obtain the largest inscribed regular workspace. However, the accuracy of 
the solution depends on the number of discrete points; small holes in the workspace 
sometimes need to be found with a sufficiently small discrete step length, which 
leads to a high computational cost. 
Chablat et al. [46] and Wang et al. [47] used interval analysis and numerical 
discrete methods to calculate the regular cubic workspace of 3-DOF orthogonal, 
UraneSX, and Delta PMs. Liu et al. [48] adopted the numerical discrete method to 
calculate the regular cubic workspace of a Delta PM. Kaloorazi et al. [38] analyzed 
the nonsingular regular cylindrical and spherical workspaces of 3RPR and 6UPS 
PMs based on the interval analysis method.6 1 Introduction
1.2.1.3 Dexterous Workspace Volume 
In addition to the evaluation indices of reachable and regular workspaces, many 
researchers have combined the workspace and condition number of the Jacobian 
matrix to form special indices of dexterous workspaces. Kelaiaia et al. [20, 49] 
defined the subspace satisfying the minimum condition number in the reachable 
workspace as a dexterous workspace. Based on the Monte Carlo method, Chaudhury 
et al. [50] defined the reachable workspace with good condition numbers as the 
dexterous workspace volume index and analyzed the dexterous workplace of a 2-
DOF 5-bar closed-loop mechanism and a 6-DOF Stewart PM. Chablat et al. [46] 
analyzed the regular dexterous workspace of 3-DOF orthogonal and UraneSX PMs 
based on the interval analysis method. Arrouk et al. [51] defined a workspace with full 
rotation capability as a dexterous workspace and analyzed the dexterous workspace 
of a 3RRR PM based on CAD technology. Regular dexterous workspace volume is a 
reasonable index for evaluating the workspace of PMs. However, there is still a lack 
of a corresponding theoretical method with high efficiency and low computational 
cost. 
1.2.1.4 Workspace Shape Indices 
The workspace shape indices, bounded between 0 and 1, are usually quantified by 
the ratio between the workspace size and bounding box size to evaluate the ratio￾nality of the mechanism workspace. Lee et al. [52] used the space utilization index, 
defined as the ratio between the reachable workspace size and bounding box size (the 
smallest rectangle enclosing the manipulator structure and the workspace size), to 
analyze the workspace of a 2-DOF PM. Stock et al. [53] adopted the space utilization 
index to analyze the workspace utilization of a linear Delta robot. Hamida et al. [18] 
proposed a workspace compactness index defined by the ratio between the volume 
occupied by the structure and the volume of the desired workspace to evaluate the 
workspace of four translational parallel robots. Castelli et al. [54] defined the ratio 
between the volume of the manipulator workspace and the smallest parallelepiped 
containing the manipulator workspace as the shape index to evaluate the compact￾ness of an industry robot. Enferadi et al. [55] defined the ratio between the volume 
of a singularity-free workspace and the smallest box containing the workspace as the 
global workspace conditioning index to evaluate the workspace of a 3(UPS)-S spher￾ical PM. The workspace shape indices can evaluate the compactness and utilization 
of PMs; however, they do not improve the computational efficiency of the workspace 
evaluation indices. 
Table 1.1 shows the physical meaning and application scenarios of the commonly 
used workspace indices to increase their vividness and intuitiveness.
The above discussions show that the workspace shape and size are often calcu￾lated based on the numerical discrete method, which has a high computational cost, 
and the calculation accuracy of the objective function depends on the number of 
discrete points in the workspace. Therefore, establishing an analytical model of the1.2 Performance Evaluation Indices 7 Table 1.1 List of commonly used workspace evaluation indices Reachable workspace volume

workspace, especially the regular workspace, or a numerical method with low compu￾tational cost and high accuracy can greatly promote the performance measures of 
a PM workspace. It can also significantly improve the computational efficiency of 
other performance indices, such as kinematic performance, stiffness performance, 
and dynamic performance. 
1.2.2 Kinematic Performance 
Kinematic analysis aims to assess the motion/force transmission efficiency, singu￾larity, dexterity, and manipulability of PMs. A kinematic performance measure is 
essential but remains a challenging issue when designing PMs. The existing kine￾matic performance indices are divided into those based on the Jacobian matrix and 
those based on screw theory. 
1.2.2.1 Kinematic Performance Indices Based on the Jacobian Matrix 
The Jacobian matrix reflects the mapping of the output speed of a moving platform 
to the speed of the actuation joints, as well as the mapping of the actuation wrench 
to the output wrench. The condition number index mainly concerns the 2-norm, 
Frobenius norm, and weighted Frobenius norm based on the Jacobian matrix is one 
of the most commonly used kinematic indices. The condition number index was first 
applied to a serial mechanism [10] and later used to evaluate the dexterity of a PM 
and the distance to singularity [42, 56–58]. It has been widely used in the kinematic 
performance measure of PMs. However, there are controversies regarding a non￾uniform dimension, relating to the coordinate system, the inconsistent dimension of 
the Jacobian matrix of a mechanism with mixed DOFs, and an undefined physical 
meaning. Two specific singularities of a GSP are considered by Hunt [59] and Fichter 
[60]. Additionally, Grassmann–Cayle algebra was applied for the analysis of PMs’ 
singularity by Ben-Horin and Shoham [61]. 
For these problems, one commonly used method is to divide the Jacobian matrix 
by a characteristic or intrinsic length [62, 63]; however, the geometric interpretation 
of the characteristic length (CL) is unclear. Khan et al. [64] used uniform space to 
present a more direct geometric explanation of the CL. Pond et al. [65] defined the 
dimensionless Jacobian matrix using the velocities of three points on different lines 
of the moving platform. Fang et al. [66] reduced the dimensionality of the 3 × 6 
Jacobian matrix of a 3-DOF 3PRS PM to a 3 × 3 square matrix by quoting constraint 
equations that are conducive to the subsequent analysis of kinematic performance. 
In addition to the dexterity and singularity analysis indices based on the Jacobian 
matrix, the manipulability index of the mechanism is also important for kinematic 
analysis. It measures the transmission qualities of velocity and force, including the 
velocity manipulability and force manipulability indices, as well as the distance to1.2 Performance Evaluation Indices 9
singularity. Yoshikawa [67] first defined /
det( J JT ) as the velocity manipulability 
index, where J is the Jacobian matrix. Wu et al. [68] studied the velocity manip￾ulability ellipse index. Lee et al. [69] proposed a velocity manipulability polyhe￾dron index considering joint constraints. The force manipulability index defines the 
ability of the unit actuation force to be enlarged to the operating space. Wu et al. [68] 
compared the condition number, velocity manipulability, and force manipulability 
performance indices of a 3-DOF plane mechanism. 
Singularity is very important since it relates not only to Jacobian matrix, but 
also stiffness matrix. Since the performance of a mechanism deteriorates when the 
mechanism is close to a singular configuration. Many of the performance indices such 
as manipulability, dexterity, and stiffness performance have the ability to measure 
the distance to singularity, and it is independent of the dimensionally inhomogeneity 
of matrix elements. 
Table 1.2 lists some commonly used kinematic evaluation indices based on the 
Jacobian matrix. It is worth noting that the 2-norm and Frobenius norm indices 
in Table 1.2 are based on the definition of matrix trace. However, the trace of the 
Jacobian matrix is either undefined since it presents a sum of nonhomogeneous 
elements or defined after normalization procedure with application of the CL. The 
former approach is erroneous and the latter has no clear explanations for the CL 
choice and its physical meaning.

1.2.2.2 Kinematic Performance Indices Based on Screw Theory 
According to screw theory, the instantaneous power of a wrench acting on a twist 
screw is called virtual work (VW). Yuan [70] defined the virtual coefficients of a 
transmission wrench and output twist screws as the transmission factor, which were 
used to evaluate the kinematic performance of a spatial PM. The value range of 
the transmission factor is from − ∞ to + ∞. Sutherland et al. [71] defined the 
normalized form of the transmission factor as the transfer index (TI). Tsai et al. 
[72] considered the transitivity and manipulability of a mechanism and proposed 
the total transmission index (TTI) as the product of TI and the manipulator index 
(MI, defined as the ability of the input that can be effectively absorbed into the 
rest of the mechanism). Based on the TTI, Chen et al. [73] proposed a generalized 
transmission index, which is a generalized form of the TI and transmission angle. Liu 
et al. [74–76] proposed a motion/force transmission performance index (including 
the input transmission performance and output transmission performance) based on 
screw theory, which can be used to evaluate the transmission efficiency of energy 
from the input to the output. The motion/force transmission performance index is 
dimensionless and independent of the coordinate system with a value ranging from 
0 to 1 and allows an evaluation of the distance to singularity. 
Based on the performance chart-based design methodology and motion/force 
transmission performance index, Wu et al. [77], Wang et al. [78], and Chen et al. [79] 
optimized the kinematic performance of various PMs such as a 5R PM, while Li et al. 
[80–85] optimized the kinematic performance of other PMs such as a 2PUR-PSR PM. 
Chen et al. [86] proposed an orthogonalized force transmission index independent 
of the coordinate system based on the commonly used pressure angle/transmission 
angle of serial mechanisms to reflect the mapping relationship between the external 
load and constraint force. Note that screw theory is used in these indices that solve 
the shortcomings of the non-uniform dimension of performance indices based on 
the Jacobian matrix related to the coordinate system. Table 1.3 lists some typical 
kinematic evaluation indices based on screw theory.
The performance indices mentioned above, which are based on the Jacobian matrix 
and screw theory, are dedicated to reflecting the static kinematic performance of the 
mechanism, but they are not dynamic. Therefore, establishing a motion/force trans￾mission performance index that considers the inertial force, Coriolis force, centrifugal 
force, damping force, and dynamic load force can be closer to the real kinematic 
performance of PMs. 
1.2.3 Stiffness Performance 
The stiffness performance reflects the ability of a PM to resist deformation under 
an external load, which reflects the accuracy of the mechanism, especially for PMs 
bearing heavy loads. Therefore, the stiffness performance measures are of great 
significance to PMs.1.2 Performance Evaluation Indices 11

Stiffness performance indices are proposed based on the overall Cartesian stiff￾ness matrix to quantitatively measure the stiffness performance of PMs. The main 
difficulty relating to this procedure results from the fact that the eigenvalues of the 
stiffness matrices are undefined because of the dimensional inhomogeneity of the 
stiffness (or compliance) matrix elements. Comprehensive reviews relating to the 
dimensional inhomogeneity of robot stiffness and compliance matrices were devel￾oped by Kang et al. [87] and Cardou et al. [88]. The existing stiffness performance 
indices mainly concern two categories reflecting the magnitude and uniformity of 
stiffness performance. 
1.2.3.1 Indices Reflecting the Magnitude of Stiffness Performance 
Evaluation indices reflecting the magnitude of stiffness performance are commonly 
used today. Fundamental works on solving the stiffness evaluation problem were 
developed by Patterson and Lipkin [89, 90]. The minimum, maximum, and average 
eigenvalue indices [91] reflect the minimum, maximum, and average values of the 
overall stiffness matrix of the mechanism, respectively. However, the approach has 
non-uniform dimensions and undefined physical meaning. The trace index [92] 
takes the trace of the overall stiffness matrix as the index for stiffness performance 
measures, with the disadvantage of non-uniform dimensions. The weighted index 
of the trace [93] takes the sum of the weights of the overall traces of the stiffness 
matrix as the index to evaluate the stiffness performance of PMs. However, the 
determination of the weighting factors is subjective, and the dimensions are non￾uniform. The determinant index [92] takes the determinant of the overall stiffness12 1 Introduction
matrix as the index for stiffness performance measures. The main diagonal stiffness 
index [94] regards the main diagonal elements of the overall stiffness matrix as the 
index for stiffness performance measures in the corresponding direction. The above￾mentioned stiffness indices have a simple calculation procedure but with the relation 
to the coordinate system, non-uniform dimensions, and undefined physical meaning. 
Yang et al. [19] proposed a comprehensive stiffness index to solve the disad￾vantage that the main diagonal stiffness index ignores the coupling effect of off￾diagonal elements. The extreme stiffness and corresponding extreme direction are 
decoupled when the force and couple act to obtain the extremum linear stiffness and 
angular stiffness performance, respectively. A total of four stiffness performance 
indices are used to avoid the undefined physical meaning caused by the coupling 
of the linear and angular stiffness elements. Portman developed three methods to 
obtain direct solutions of the robot stiffness evaluability problem, resulting in basic 
performance indices such as the maximal and minimal stiffness values, condition 
numbers, and stiffness range. The indices are obtained using all of the information 
constituting the original stiffness matrix, without any additional intuitive parameters. 
The wrench transformation technique [95] transforms the original stiffness matrix in 
the direct sum possessing three translational and three rotational eigenvalues, and the 
Schur complements method [96] generalizes the previous result. The same results 
are partially obtained through the optimization of the unit VW using the Lagrange 
multipliers method [97]. In addition to the eigenscrew decomposition index [98], the 
principal axis decomposition of the spatial stiffness matrix based on the congruent 
transformation [99], and the decoupled linear and rotational indices of the stiffness 
matrix [100], Raoofian et al. [101] decoupled the stiffness performance indices into 
two scalar force indices and two scalar couple indices. These indices decouple the 
linear and angular stiffness performance of the mechanism with the defined dimen￾sion and physical meaning, positively affecting the stiffness performance measures. 
However, these stiffness indices should be combined to evaluate the stiffness perfor￾mance of the mechanism due to the lack of comprehensive performance indices of 
unified linear and angular stiffness. 
Researchers have proposed some stiffness performance indices that unify the 
linear and angular stiffness from the point of view of energy to solve the above 
problem. Yan et al. [102] proposed a VW index based on strain energy to unify the 
linear and angular stiffness for evaluating the stiffness performance of a mechanism. 
Cao et al. [12] defined the configuration stiffness index as the minimum strain energy 
stored by the mechanism under the external force or couple. Lian et al. [103] and 
Wang et al. [104] defined the reciprocal product of the external wrench and the 
corresponding infinitesimal elastic deformation as the instantaneous energy index. 
The proposed stiffness index based on strain energy unifies the linear and angular 
stiffness units and independent of the coordinate system. However, this index based 
on the energy dimension cannot reflect the working accuracy of PMs.1.2 Performance Evaluation Indices 13
1.2.3.2 Index Reflecting the Uniformity of Stiffness Performance 
Similar to the kinematic index, the condition number of the stiffness matrix can 
reflect the isotropy, uniformity, and singularity of the stiffness performance of PMs. 
The norm index introduced by Carbone [92] takes the norm of the stiffness matrix as 
the index for stiffness performance measures. The condition number stiffness index 
proposed by Shin et al. [105] was used to evaluate the isotropy and uniformity of the 
stiffness performance of the mechanism. Zhao et al. [106] defined the ratio of the 
square of the maximum stiffness value to the product of the minimum stiffness and 
average stiffness in the workspace as the uniformity index of stiffness performance 
to evaluate a mechanism in its workspace. Gosselin et al. [107] and Guo et al. [108] 
defined the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue to the minimum eigenvalue of the 
stiffness matrix as the local isotropic index of the stiffness performance and the ratio 
of the maximum to the minimum isotropic indices in the workspace as the global 
stiffness uniformity index. 
Yeo et al. [109] used the ratio of the product of the square of the maximum 
eigenvalue and the square of the minimum eigenvalue in the stiffness matrix to the 
sum of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the stiffness index to solve the 
separation of the stiffness performance amplitude index and isotropic index. The 
index is used to evaluate the amplitude and isotropy of the stiffness performance of 
a mechanism. This index is more suitable for stiffness matrices of planar PMs rather 
than spatial PMs. On this basis, Görgülü et al. [110] defined the ratio of the ideal 
sphere volume to the ellipsoid volume formed by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
of the overall stiffness matrix of the mechanism as the isotropic volume index, which 
is used to analyze the stiffness performance of an R-CUBE PM. This stiffness index 
is greater than or equal to 1. However, the non-uniform dimensions and unclear 
physical meaning of this stiffness index are its main shortcomings. 
To effectively improve the stiffness performance of PMs, it is necessary to estab￾lish the stiffness contribution of each factor to the overall stiffness performance. Yang 
et al. [43] defined the ratio between the strain energy stored in each component and the 
PM as the strain energy factor index (SEFI), which is frame-free and bound between 
0 and 1. With an external load and trajectory at hand, the SEFI can quantitatively 
evaluate the contribution of each component to the overall stiffness performance of 
a PM. Yang et al. [111] decoupled the linear and angular elastic deflection contri￾bution of each component to the PM based on the rigidity principle, which allowed 
a quantitative evaluation of the contribution of each elastic component to the linear 
and angular stiffness performances of the mechanism, thus providing a new approach 
for effectively improving the linear/angular stiffness performance of the mechanism. 
However, if this method is used to address over constrained PMs, the Moore–Penrose 
inverse is required to avoid singularity of the compliance contribution matrix. 
In addition to the above-mentioned stiffness performance indices, some related 
research on the variable stiffness and joint clearances has also been carried out. Zhao 
et al. [112] proposed a parallel compliance device that was inspired by a 3UPU 
PM, and in each limb of the device, there was an electromagnetic variable stiff￾ness spring. The endpoint stiffness performance under multiple combinations of14 1 Introduction
spring stiffness values was exhibited in the form of stiffness ellipsoids. Li et al. 
[113] proposed a flexible 3PU PM that employed superelastic nickel–titanium rods 
to achieve compliant movements beyond conventional rigid-body PMs and carried 
out circle trajectory tracking and contact force tests by cadaveric trials. Fan et al. 
[15] considered the flexibility of links and the clearance of joints to establish overall 
stiffness models of Tricept and A3 PMs and proposed stiffness ellipsoid indices to 
enhance their stiffness performance by means of the component selection method. 
The difference between the ideal and combined spherical joints was also presented 
[114]. Notably, their results showed that the combined spherical joints improved the 
workspace and undermined the stiffness performance of PMs. Table 1.4 lists some 
typical indices obtained by non-recommended methods. These indices are obtained 
by direct mathematical operations on the stiffness matrix without considering the 
non-uniform dimensions of matrix elements. Table 1.5 lists some stiffness indices 
using recommended methods that include compliant axes method, matrix decompo￾sition method. The Schur complements-based method, the virtual work optimization 
method, and strain energy method. 
It is important to emphasize that stiffness performance indices are dimensionless 
and independent of a coordinate system with a defined physical meaning. The existing 
stiffness indices ignore the influence of the gravity and friction of the mechanism on 
the performance indices. Therefore, establishing the stiffness contribution of each 
factor, including the gravity, friction, and flexibility of the mechanism, can provide 
important significance for effectively improving the overall stiffness performance

matrix under the action of simultaneous force and moment is also one of the issues 
to be addressed. 
1.2.4 Dynamic Performance 
Under the high-speed operating conditions of PMs, excellent dynamic characteristics 
can guarantee higher positional accuracy and workpiece quality. Therefore, dynamic 
performance measures and control are vital to developing high-precision robots. 
Commonly used dynamic evaluation indices mainly concern the inertia index, 
dynamic dexterity index, dynamic manipulability index, dynamic stiffness index, 
and natural frequency index. The first three indices are mainly used to evaluate the 
rigid dynamic performance of PMs while the latter two are used to evaluate the 
flexible dynamic performance of PMs.16 1 Introduction
1.2.4.1 Rigid Dynamic Indices 
A rigid dynamic model is established under the assumption that the mechanism is 
rigid to obtain the dynamic indices, which reflects the rigid dynamic performance of 
PMs. 
The inertia index includes two parts, namely the first mass moment of inertia 
and the second mass moment of inertia. Compared with a serial mechanism, the 
actuators of a PM can be installed on the base, thereby reducing the moving mass. 
The minimization of the mass index reduces the inertial force, which allows increases 
in the speed and acceleration and improves dynamic performance. However, reducing 
the mass can decrease the stiffness performance. When the mass is optimized, the 
stiffness performance of PMs should meet the processing requirements [115]. Wan 
et al. [116] adopted the diagonally dominant elements of a mass matrix as the dynamic 
performance index of an 8-SPU parallel walking mechanism. 
Similar to the kinematic dexterity index, the dynamic dexterity index is defined 
as the condition number of the inertia matrix. Asada [16] proposed a generalized 
inertial ellipsoid index based on the generalized inertia tensor. The length of the 
principal axis of an ellipsoid is equal to the reciprocal of the square root of the 
corresponding eigenvalue. The minimum principal axis corresponds to the maximum 
inertia, where the speed in this direction is the slowest and vice versa. On this basis, 
Kilaru [117] divided the square of the number of DOFs of a mechanism by the 
condition number of the inertia matrix whose eigenvalues are diagonal elements and 
defined as a standardized inertial isotropy index with a value of 0–1. Merlet [118] 
proposed a dynamic manipulability index based on Jacobian and mass matrices. 
Yoshikawa [119] proposed a dynamic manipulability ellipsoid index, which can be 
used to evaluate the isotropic ability of a mechanism to change the posture and 
position of its end effector under a constant actuation force. The condition numbers 
M ˜ J˜
+
R and M ˜ J˜
+
T are separately used to evaluate the isotropy of the rotational and 
translational dynamic manipulability of PMs, where M ˜ denotes the inertia matrix of 
the PM and J˜ +
R and J˜ +
T denote the Jacobian matrices of rotational and translational 
acceleration, respectively. Chai et al. [120, 121] analyzed the dynamic performance 
of a 2UPR-RPU PM based on the dynamic manipulability ellipsoid index. The above￾mentioned stiffness indices assume that the mechanism is rigid and are established 
based on the mass matrix without considering the influence of elasticity on the 
dynamic performance of PMs; thus, these indices are not comprehensive. 
1.2.4.2 Flexible Dynamic Indices 
Flexible dynamic indices consider the elasticity of PMs, which can be obtained by 
establishing elastodynamic or rigid–flexible coupling dynamic models. These indices 
mainly concern the dynamic stiffness index and natural frequency index. 
The dynamic stiffness index is used to evaluate the response of a mechanism under 
a variable-frequency dynamic load, which is a function of the external excitation1.2 Performance Evaluation Indices 17
frequency. When the external excitation frequency is equal to the natural frequency, 
the dynamic stiffness performance of a mechanism is at its lowest. The dynamic 
stiffness index is used to evaluate the ability of a PM to resist dynamic loads. Azulay 
et al. [122] and Alagheband et al. [123] evaluated the dynamic performance of a 
3PPRS PM based on the dynamic stiffness index. 
Similar to the dynamic stiffness index, the natural frequency index of a mech￾anism, especially the fundamental frequency, is essential to measure the dynamic 
performance of a mechanism. It comprehensively considers the influence of the 
mass matrix, stiffness matrix, and damping matrix on the dynamic performance of 
PMs. A higher natural frequency, especially a higher fundamental frequency, means 
a higher control bandwidth, which can reduce the vibration response of a mechanism. 
Hoevenaars [124] used screw theory to obtain a mapping relationship between an 
end effector and the motion of a subchain rod and combined the inertia matrices of 
the moving platform and rods to establish the overall inertia matrix of the mech￾anism. The overall stiffness matrix of the mechanism was obtained based on an 
elastostatic stiffness analysis, and the natural frequency of a Heli4 PM was analyzed 
by combining the stiffness and inertia matrices. Luo et al. [125] and Zhang et al. 
[126] analyzed the natural frequency distribution of a 3RPS PM based on substruc￾ture synthesis. Liu et al. [127] analyzed the frequency characteristic distribution of 
a 3RRS PM using the Lagrangian equation and deformation compatibility equa￾tions to analyze the influence of the dimensional parameters, sectional parameters, 
and material properties of a mechanism on the natural frequency. Yang et al. [128] 
analyzed the natural frequency distribution of 2UPR-RPU and 2UPR-2RPU PMs 
in a workspace based on global independent generalized displacement coordinates 
and a matrix displacement method. After comparison, they found that the redundant 
limb can significantly improve the fundamental frequency of the mechanism. The 
natural frequency index has advantages such as clear physical meaning and being 
frame-free. However, it cannot directly reflect the dynamic response of PMs under 
external load. 
1.2.4.3 Other Indices 
The maximum actuation force index [129], power consumption index [130], 
maximum speed, and acceleration indices [131] are also commonly used to eval￾uate the dynamic performance of rigid dynamic, flexible dynamic, and rigid–flexible 
coupling dynamic models of a mechanism. Corinaldi et al. [132] considered angular 
acceleration as an objective function and planned a path on the spherical surface by 
means of Bézier curves. Lou et al. [133] investigated three dynamics-based trajectory 
planning methods, namely time-optimal planning, cubic polynomial planning, and 
jerk-bounded planning that considered both kinematic and dynamic constraints. A 
computed torque control scheme was applied to follow the computed tractor, and the 
optimal control parameters were investigated by considering the settling time that 
reflected the response speed as an objective function; in this case, overshooting, the 
steady error, and the actuation saturation were used as constraints. Liu et al. [134]18 1 Introduction

proposed two dynamics-based performance indices, namely the coordination ratio 
and coordinate factor; the former was combined with the hybrid control of force and 
position through a synchronous controller to enhance the actuation coordination of a 
6PUS + UPU PM, and the latter was combined with trajectory planning to enhance 
the control stability of a 3RPR PM. Table 1.6 shows the list of some typical dynamic 
evaluation indices of PMs to increase the clarity and intuitiveness of the article. 
The kinematic performance, stiffness performance, and dynamic performance 
indices of PMs introduced above are considered as local performance indices (LPIs). 
Future research trends for the performance evaluation of PMs should establish decou￾pled performance indices with defined physical meaning and consider the influence 
of friction, dynamic load, and gravity. The average [76] and variance [135] of LPIs 
in a workspace are usually used as global performance indices (GPIs) to evaluate the 
overall performance of PMs. Since it is difficult to obtain the analytical expression 
of a workspace, GPIs are often solved by a numerical discrete method. That is, the 
accuracy of the GPIs is related to the number of discrete points in the workspace, 
which consists of time-consuming calculations; thus, GPIs are not conducive for 
performance evaluation and optimization design of a mechanism. Therefore, the 
main issues of evaluation of GPIs include the analytical expressions of workspaces 
(especially regular workspaces) and the availability of high-precision and low-cost 
numerical calculation methods.1.3 Optimization Algorithm 19
1.3 Optimization Algorithm 
An optimal design of PM dimensions after determining the performance indices 
and constraint conditions is used to maximize the comprehensive performance. 
Reasonable optimization algorithms are significant for obtaining the ultimate optimal 
working state and design parameters of a parallel robot system. Currently, commonly 
used optimization algorithms mainly concern two types: traditional optimization 
algorithms and intelligent optimization algorithms. 
Robot optimization design is usually divided into single- and multi-objective 
optimization designs. Single-objective optimization is used for a performance index, 
which can be achieved through traditional optimization algorithms or intelligent opti￾mization algorithms. However, conflicts exist among various performance indices, 
and the optimization of a performance index may cause deficiencies in other perfor￾mance indices. For example, maximizing the workspace of a robot may result in 
insufficient stiffness and dynamic performance, thus failing to meet engineering 
requirements. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization design is often used in engi￾neering applications to achieve comprehensive optimization of multiple performance 
indices. The multi-objective optimization design of parallel robots is often realized 
through intelligent optimization algorithms. 
1.3.1 Traditional Optimization Algorithms 
Traditional optimization algorithms generally aim at structured problems such as 
linear programming and quadratic programming with and without constraints. Most 
of these approaches belong to the category of convex optimization; in other words, 
these approaches have only a specific global optimal point. Traditional optimization 
algorithms are deterministic algorithms compared with intelligent optimization algo￾rithms based on heuristic and probabilistic rules. The computational complexity and 
convergence of a traditional optimization algorithm can be analyzed theoretically, and 
its search information involves the derivation of an objective function. Commonly 
used traditional optimization algorithms for the optimization design of PMs mainly 
concern the exhausted search algorithm, the gradient descent method, Newton’s 
method, quasi-Newton method, the conjugate gradient method, and the sequential 
quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm. Additionally, the Lagrange multipliers 
method was applied to solve the stiffness extremum with the analytical objective 
functions and equality constraints by Portman [97], Yang et al. [19], and Hu [136]. 
1.3.1.1 Exhausted Search Algorithm 
The exhausted search algorithm discretizes the design parameters into a certain 
number of grid points and calculates the function value of each node to obtain the20 1 Introduction
global optimal value of the function. Theoretically, the algorithm can calculate the 
optimal value of any optimization model; however, the accuracy of the global optimal 
value depends on the node density. As the density of the grid points increases, the 
computational cost exponentially increases. Thus, this approach is generally suitable 
for small-scale optimization problems. For example, Xu et al. [82] used an exhausted 
optimization algorithm to optimize the kinematic performance of a 2UPR-2PRU PM 
with two design parameters. 
1.3.1.2 Gradient Descent Method and Newton’s Method 
The negative gradient direction of the current position is adopted for optimization 
in the gradient descent method. The method is the earliest and simplest and one 
of the most commonly used methods. Chaudhury et al. [50] used a gradient descent 
algorithm to optimize the dexterous workspace of a GSP and other PMs. The gradient 
descent method is simple to implement through the fmincon function in the MATLAB 
toolbox. When the objective function is convex, the solution of the gradient descent 
method is global. Generally, the solution is not guaranteed to be optimal on a global 
scale, and the speed of the gradient descent method may not be the fastest. When 
the iteration point is closer to the target point, the step size is smaller with a slower 
convergence speed. Additionally, there may be a zigzag decline, which may require 
many iterations. 
Newton’s method, often called the tangent method, is based on the tangent of 
the current position to determine the next position. Compared with the gradient 
descent method with first-order convergence, Newton’s method has second-order 
convergence with a fast convergence speed. However, the inverse of the Hessian 
matrix should be solved at each iteration, which requires complex calculations. A 
quasi-Newton method uses a positive definite matrix to approximate the Hessian 
matrix, thereby simplifying the complex calculations. Botello et al. [137] used the 
quasi-Newton method to optimize the workspace and dexterity of a Delta PM. The 
convergence speed of the quasi-Newton method was much faster than that of the 
gradient descent method. Since the quasi-Newton method does not require the second 
derivative, it is sometimes more effective than Newton’s method. The quasi-Newton 
method can be realized by the fmincon function in the MATLAB toolbox. 
Only the first derivative is used in the conjugate gradient method, which overcomes 
the shortcomings of the gradient descent method and Newton’s method. Aboulissane 
et al. [138] used the conjugate gradient algorithm to optimize the workspace of 3RPR 
and Delta PMs. The conjugate gradient method is one of the most useful methods 
for solving large-scale linear and nonlinear optimization problems. 
1.3.1.3 SQP Algorithm 
The SQP method is an algorithm that transforms complex nonlinear constraint opti￾mization into relatively simple quadratic programming. In the iterative process, each1.3 Optimization Algorithm 21
step needs to solve one or more quadratic programming subproblems. Erylmaz et al. 
[139] used the SQP method to optimize the workspace and kinematic condition 
number of a 3 × 3 UPU PM. Pedro et al. [140] divided the parameter space into 
several parameter subspaces and summarized the optimal value of each subspace as 
the initial guess value of the entire parameter space. The kinematic performance of a 
3UPS-1RPU PM was optimized based on the SQP algorithm to enhance its dexterity 
without reducing the workspace. The advantages of the SQP algorithm include high 
computational efficiency, good convergence, and a strong boundary search ability; 
therefore, this algorithm has received considerable attention and has been applied in 
engineering. This algorithm can also be achieved through the fmincon function in the 
MATLAB toolbox. However, multiple quadratic programming should be solved at 
each iteration. As the scale of an optimization problem increases, the storage volume 
and computational cost also increase; thus, this approach is generally suitable for 
small- and medium-sized problems. The traditional optimization algorithm searches 
in a single-point manner, and the optimization result depends on the selection of the 
initial value. Only one optimal point can be obtained through one optimization; thus, 
the Pareto frontier of multi-objective functions cannot be obtained. Lou et al. [141] 
took Delta and Gough–Stewart PMs to compare the convergence performance of the 
SQP and intelligent optimization algorithms and concluded that the SQP algorithm 
with multiple initial points was more effective for small-scale optimization problems. 
The disadvantages of traditional optimization algorithms are as follows: (a) They 
usually find only the local optimal solution of an optimization problem; (b) the opti￾mization results strongly depend on the initial value and are only suitable for small￾and medium-scale optimization problems; and (c) they are difficult to implement for 
multi-objective optimization design. 
1.3.2 Intelligent Optimization Algorithms 
Dimensional synthesis is challenged by the time-consuming calculation of the GPIs 
of PMs, as well as the coupling competitiveness among performance indices. The 
traditional optimization algorithms search in a single-point manner, which easily 
results in a local optimum. Moreover, traditional optimization algorithms often 
require that the objective function is convex, continuous, and differentiable, and that 
the feasible region is a convex set; therefore, their abilities to process nondetermin￾istic information are poor. These weaknesses limit the use of traditional optimization 
algorithms in solving many practical optimization problems. 
Intelligent optimization algorithms provide a new idea for these complex multi￾extreme and multi-objective optimization models. The intelligent optimization algo￾rithm, also called a heuristic algorithm, is used to solve a problem based on empirical 
rules. As a random-search evolutionary algorithm based on probability, it searches for 
a population number of points in parallel, which is conducive to finding the global 
optimum. Such new algorithms generally do not require continuous and convex 
objectives and constraint functions and sometimes do not even require analytical22 1 Introduction
expressions. Intelligent algorithms often used in the multi-objective optimization 
design of PMs mainly concern the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm opti￾mization (PSO) algorithm. In addition, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm, 
artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, 
and hybrid algorithm have been applied to multi-objective optimization models of 
PMs. 
1.3.2.1 GA 
The GA is an intelligent algorithm simulating the genetic and evolutionary laws of 
organisms in nature and the natural selection and genetic mechanism of Darwin’s 
biological evolution theory. This makes the optimization process similar to the 
crossover and mutation of chromogens in biological evolution. In each iteration 
process, the algorithm will evolve to a new population by selection, crossover, and 
elite retention until the convergence conditions are reached. Compared with tradi￾tional optimization algorithms starting from a single solution, the GA searches from 
a set of solutions that cover a large region, making it possible to jump out of the local 
optimum and obtain a global optimum. 
Wu [131, 142] used the GA to optimize the stiffness performance, kinematic 
performance, workspace, and dynamic performance of biglide and Ragnar PMs and 
obtained a scatter matrix between the objective functions and design parameters. This 
provided a theoretical basis for determining optimal design parameters. Bounab et al. 
[42] and Kelaiaia et al. [49] took the stiffness performance, mass, and workspace 
as objective functions and obtained the Pareto frontier of the DELTA PM for multi￾objective optimization based on the GA. Ferrari [143] optimized the workspace and 
longitudinal geometric dimensions of a 6-DOF PM using the GA. Song et al. [144] 
considered the geometric constraints of a mechanism and optimized the kinematic 
performance of a 1T3R PM based on the GA. Huang et al. [33] optimized the stiffness 
performance, kinematic performance, and workspace volume of a 3-DOF PM based 
on the GA. Ganesh et al. [145] adopted a GA to carry out multi-objective optimization 
design including a workspace index, global conditioning index, and global stiffness 
index for a 3-DOF star triangle manipulator. 
The GA has the following advantages: Obtains the global optimal solution of 
a problem, exhibits strong robustness, solves complex optimization problems, and 
utilizes distributed calculations. It has been widely used due to its scalability (easy to 
combine with other algorithms). Its main disadvantage is that operators, such as the 
crossover rate and mutation rate, have many parameters, and various selections can 
seriously affect the quality of the solution. At present, most of the selected parameters 
are based on experience. The GA has poor local search ability, low search efficiency 
in the later stage of evolution, and slow convergence speed. In practical engineering 
applications, the GA is prone to premature convergence. Therefore, developing a 
method that retains good individuals and a diverse group has always been a challenge 
with the GA used.1.3 Optimization Algorithm 23
1.3.2.2 PSO 
The basic concept of the PSO algorithm is to simulate the foraging behaviors of a 
flock of birds; for instance, the flock adjusts its path when searching for food based 
on its own experience and communication among populations. Each particle in the 
swarm updates its spatial position and flight speed by tracking two extremums. One 
is the optimal solution particle found by a single particle in its iteration process, 
called the individual extremum. The other is the optimal solution particle that the 
population finds in the iterative process. That is, the extremums of all individuals 
in each iteration process, which is the global extremum. The PSO algorithm is also 
based on the concepts of population and evolution. However, it determines the search 
according to its speed instead of the crossover and mutation operations of the GA, 
making it easier to implement. 
Wang et al. [146] optimized the workspace, natural frequency, input coupling 
rate, and stiffness performance of a planar 3-DOF PM based on the PSO algorithm. 
Sun et al. [115] optimized the mass and stiffness performance of a T5 PM based 
on the PSO algorithm. Yun et al. [147] compared the GA, PSO, and gradient-based 
optimization algorithms for the optimization design of a 3PUPU PM and found that 
the PSO algorithm was better than the other approaches. Wang et al. [104, 146] 
used the PSO algorithm for the optimization design of robots such as Tricept and 
verified its calculation efficiency. Lian [148] used the PSO algorithm to optimize the 
stiffness performance, dynamic performance, and mass of a PaQuad PM. Qi et al. 
[149] considered the dimensional parameters and section parameters of a mecha￾nism and used the PSO algorithm to optimize the workspace, kinematics, stiffness, 
and dynamic performance of a 4RSR-SS PM. Farooq et al. [150] considered the 
conditioning index, workspace volume, and global conditioning index as a weighted 
comprehensive index and concluded that the PSO algorithm required fewer iterations 
and had a higher convergence rate than the GA. Similar to the GA, the PSO algo￾rithm often encounters premature convergence and poor convergence performance 
for complex high-dimensional problems; thus, convergence to the global optimum 
is not guaranteed. 
1.3.2.3 Other Intelligent Optimization Algorithms 
In addition to the GA and PSO algorithms, other intelligent algorithms can also 
be found in the optimization design of PMs. Similar to the GA, the DE algorithm 
[151] is also a stochastic model simulating biological evolution, including mutation, 
crossover, and selection operations. It randomly selects the difference vector of two 
individual vectors from the population as the source of the random variation of 
the third individual. After weighting the difference vector, the algorithm is summed 
with the third individual according to certain rules to generate an individual variation. 
The DE algorithm adopts real number encoding, a simple mutation operation based 
on difference, and a one-to-one competitive survival strategy, which reduces the24 1 Introduction

complexity of the genetic operation [152]. Zhang [153] used the DE algorithm to 
optimize the stiffness performance and regular workspace volume of a 3UPU PM. 
The ACO algorithm [154] is a probabilistic algorithm inspired by the behavior 
of ant colonies searching for food in nature. In the algorithm, several ants jointly 
construct a solution path and improve the solution quality by leaving and exchanging 
pheromones on the solution path. This algorithm uses a positive feedback mechanism 
and was originally applied to combinatorial optimization. Due to its high compu￾tational cost, the basic ACO algorithm is not suitable for the direct and continuous 
optimization of PMs. Yang et al. [155] introduced variable neighborhood search 
and search along the way to adjust the local search, global search, and pheromone 
updating rules of the basic ACO algorithm. This improved ACO algorithm was used 
to optimize the dexterity of a 6-DOF parallel platform. 
The ABC algorithm [156] is an intelligent optimization method proposed by 
imitating the foraging behaviors of bees. Bees carry out different activities according 
to their respective division of labor and realize the sharing and communication of 
bee colony information. Through the local optimal behavior of each artificial bee, 
the global optimal value is finally highlighted in the group, thus finding the optimal 
solution of the problem. Mirshekari et al. [57] considered the geometric constraints of 
the mechanism and used the ABC algorithm to optimize the kinematic and dynamic 
performance of a 6RUS PM. For intuitive understanding, the development history of 
the above-mentioned optimization methods applied to the optimization design of PMs 
and the corresponding optimization objects are listed in Table 1.7. Additionally, Table 
1.8 briefly summarizes the advantages, disadvantages, and application scenarios of 
each intelligent optimization algorithm.
1.3.2.4 Hybrid Algorithm 
Many researchers have studied the mixed use of intelligent optimization algorithms 
and the combination of intelligent optimization and traditional optimization algo￾rithms in the multi-objective optimization design of PMs. Fabio et al. [162] combined 
the GA and PSO algorithms to optimize the dexterity, stiffness, and motion/force 
transmission performance of 2- and 3-RRR PMs and compared their optimization 
results. Mao et al. [163] combined the DE and PSO algorithms to optimize the forward1.3 Optimization Algorithm 25

solution of a 3RPS PM. To obtain the comprehensive optimum of multi-objective 
performance, Rosyid et al. [164] combined the GA and gradient descent algorithm 
to optimize the workspace and stiffness performance of a 3PRR PM, and Liu [48] 
applied the GA and SQP algorithm for the optimization design of a Delta PM. 
For multi-peak problems [165], intelligent optimization algorithms [166] can 
jump out of the local optimum through their effective design, thereby converging to 
the global optimum. However, most intelligent optimization algorithms are heuristic 
algorithms, which can be used for qualitative analysis instead of quantitative analysis. 
In addition, intelligent optimization algorithms are mostly based on random charac￾teristics, and their convergence is generally in the sense of probability. The actual 
performance is uncontrollable, with the disadvantages of slow convergence speed and 
high computational complexity. Thus, a major task in the current optimization design 
of PMs is to improve model accuracy and accelerate convergence by enhancing the 
theory of intelligent optimization algorithms or combining traditional algorithms and26 1 Introduction
intelligent optimization algorithms. It is necessary to increase the population size to 
obtain more non-dominated solutions in actual engineering; however, this leads to 
an exponential increase in computational cost. Therefore, developing methods that 
increase the population size without causing a significant increase in computational 
cost is currently a major task. 
1.3.3 Ways to Improve Optimization Algorithms 
In the optimization design process, GPIs are often obtained by calculating the mean 
of the LPIs of a limited number of discrete nodes in a workspace. As the number of 
discrete nodes increases, the computational cost increases exponentially. The opti￾mization process requires repeated calculation of each node, and a large number of 
iterations and a high computational cost significantly reduce the efficiency of the 
optimization design. Many researchers have studied methods to improve the opti￾mization design efficiency of PMs. After years of development, these methods mainly 
concern the Monte Carlo method, performance atlases, mapping model method, and 
sensitivity analysis method. 
1.3.3.1 Monte Carlo Method 
A number of discrete points meeting the constraints and inverse kinematics of the 
mechanism in a complete workspace are randomly allocated in the Monte Carlo 
method. These discrete points are analyzed to obtain the GPIs of the mechanism, 
which improves the inefficiency of the grid point method to some extent. Tsai et al. 
[167] used the Monte Carlo method to randomly allocate a number of discrete points 
in a complete hemispherical space and optimized the global condition number perfor￾mance index of a 3UPU PM by an exhausted point-by-point search algorithm. Chaud￾hury et al. [50] used the Monte Carlo method to calculate the dexterous workspace of 
a planar 5-bar PM and a spatial 6-DOF Stewart PM. Then, the gradient descent algo￾rithm was combined to carry out the optimization design of PMs. The Monte Carlo 
method is a statistical simulation method that is a random approximation method. 
A larger simulation sample means smaller errors and an increase in computational 
cost. Therefore, the improvement of optimization design efficiency of PMs by Monte 
Carlo method is limited. 
1.3.3.2 Performance Atlases 
An optimization design generally requires known internal of design parameters. 
Performance atlases [168–170] transform the design parameters into dimension￾less parameters without knowing in advance the interval of the design parameters. 
Performance atlases reduce the design parameters from n to n-1 and design a similar1.3 Optimization Algorithm 27
mechanism with optimal kinematic performance to establish a mapping relation￾ship between the finite and infinite spaces. In 2006, Park et al. [171] considered 
the kinematic performance and workspace of the mechanism and optimized a 2-
DOF planar PM using performance atlases. On this basis, Liu et al. [168] gave a 
further introduction to performance atlases and pointed out that when the number 
of design parameters exceeded 4, the performance map between the performance 
indices and characteristic parameters could not be obtained. Additionally, perfor￾mance atlases have been used to optimize the kinematic performance of PMs such 
as PVRRRPV [172–175]. Xu et al. [80–85] reduced the design parameters from 3 
to 2 based on performance atlases and optimized the kinematic performance of PMs 
such as 2UPR-2PRU and 2-(PRR)2RH PMs. 
The greatest advantage of performance atlases is that a group of similar mech￾anisms with optimal kinematic performance can be obtained without knowing in 
advance the interval of the structural parameters. Thus, the design parameters and 
computational cost can be reduced. However, there are few reports about the perfor￾mance atlases applied to a task in which the number of design parameters is more 
than 5. 
1.3.3.3 Mapping Model Method 
A mapping model between a GPI and design parameters is established to improve the 
high computational cost of GPIs and the optimization design of a mechanism. This 
method is a major way to improve the optimization efficiency of PMs. Commonly 
used methods for establishing a mapping model mainly concern multivariate regres￾sion (MR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and backpropagation (BP) neural 
networks. 
MR is based on the least square method that gives the function f (x, a1, a2, …, 
an) and its measured values are y1, y2, …, yN at N different observation points of 
x1, x2, …, xN. The parameters a1, a2, …, an are to be determined to minimize the 
standard deviation ΣN 
i=1 [ f (xi; a1, a2, . . . , an) − yi]
2. Sun et al. [115], Qi et al. 
[149], and Lian et al. [148, 176] established analytical mapping models between 
objective functions and design parameters based on MR and found that the fitting 
accuracy of the second or third polynomials was optimal; this was then combined 
with the PSO algorithm for the multi-objective optimization design of a T5 PM. 
Rahman et al. [177] combined MR and the gradient descent optimization algorithm 
to optimize the kinematic performance of a 3P-S-S/S PM. 
Wang et al. [178] and Palmieri et al. [179] combined MR and the GA to optimize 
the layout of multiple PMs and compared them with the finite element optimization 
algorithm. The optimization method combining MR and the GA can significantly 
improve the optimization design efficiency. MR can establish analytical mapping 
models between design parameters and objective functions to improve the computa￾tional efficiency of GPIs. However, the regression equation is only a speculation, and 
different orders of polynomials need to be tested to find the optimal fitting accuracy, 
which affects the diversity and uncertainty of factors.28 1 Introduction
GPR is a nonparametric model using the Gaussian process (GP) prior to the 
regression analysis of data. It is a kernel-based probability model that has been applied 
to robot mapping modeling and dimensional synthesis [180]. GPR can provide a 
posterior of the predicted results; when the likelihood is normally distributed, the 
posterior is in an analytical form. In addition, the GPR method does not need to 
specify the order of the model. Nguyen et al. [181] constructed GPR mapping models 
among the natural frequency, stiffness, and damping coefficients and configurations 
of a 6-DOF industrial robot using experimental sample data and concluded that the 
accuracy of the GPR-based model was better than that of the MR-based model. Cheng 
et al. [182] established a GPR proxy model of the dynamic response and combined 
it with the GA to optimize the dynamic parameters of a Delta robot to reduce the 
vibration response of the equipment. Wan et al. [183] and Chen et al. [184] established 
a mapping model for assembly error and performed error compensation based on the 
GPR model. Chen et al. [185] combined the GPR and PSO algorithms to propose a 
hybrid algorithm for the multi-objective optimization design of PMs and compared 
the GPR- and MR-based mapping models. The results showed that the GPR-based 
model had a higher accuracy than the MR-based model. The advantage of the GPR￾based model is that the predicted value is an interpolation of the observed value, 
which is probabilistic, so the empirical confidence interval can be calculated. Then, 
the information is used for refitting (online fitting and adaptive fitting) and prediction 
in a certain region of interest, and different kernels can be specified. The disadvantage 
is that GPR uses all of the sample/characteristic information for predictions, which 
is not efficient. Therefore, GPR is suitable for processing a small collection of data 
rather than high-dimensional spatial models. 
The BP neural network, proposed in 1986 by a scientific research group headed 
by Rumelhart [186], is a multilayer feedforward network trained by an error BP 
algorithm. A BP network has strong nonlinear mapping ability. Its learning rule uses 
the steepest descent method to adjust the weights and thresholds of the network 
through backpropagation to minimize the sum of squared errors of the network. 
Gao et al. [187] combined the neural network algorithm and the GA to optimize 
the stiffness performance of a 3-DOF PM. Huang et al. [188] and Hu et al. [189] 
established mapping models between the workspace, stiffness, condition number, 
first-order natural frequency performance indices, and structural parameters based 
on the BP neural network. Gao et al. [93] and Zhang et al. [190] established mapping 
models between the stiffness and dexterous indices and design parameters of a spatial 
6-DOF PM based on the BP neural network and combined it with the GA for a 
multi-objective optimization design. It has been proved that a three-layer neural 
network can approximate any nonlinear continuous function with arbitrary precision. 
The BP neural network also has the advantages of self-learning, self-adaptation, 
generalization ability, fault tolerance, and associative memory. However, after in￾depth research, the network has the following shortcomings: Easily falls into local 
minimization, has a slow convergence speed, and high dependence on the sample. 
Additionally, it is sensitive to the initial network weights, and initializing the network 
with different weights can converge to different local minima. This is the fundamental 
reason why different results are obtained after each training [185].1.3 Optimization Algorithm 29
Establishing mapping models between GPIs and design parameters is now the 
main way to improve the multi-objective optimization design efficiency of PMs. 
However, the mapping model has inevitable errors. Thus, it is a major challenge to 
establish a theoretical model or a highly precise and efficient mapping model between 
GPI and design parameters for the optimization design of PMs. 
1.3.3.4 Sensitivity Analysis 
In the optimization design mathematical model, dimensions are always concerned as 
variables but it is noted that a mechanism especially PM may associate with amount 
of dimensions. Some of them have great influence on performance but others may 
not. Therefore, it is necessary to select the main parameters from the large quantity 
of parameters to be designed by means of parameter sensitivity analysis method, 
so as to eliminate unimportant parameters and simplify performance analysis and 
optimization model. Variance-based methods have assessed themselves as versa￾tile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of 
model output [191]. The most commonly used variance-based Sobol’ sensitivity 
analysis method can be roughly divided into two categories: Monte Carlo [192] 
and direct integral methods [193]. Lian et al. [176, 194] investigated the effects of 
joint stiffness/compliance coefficients and parameters of cross-section to the mass 
and stiffness performance of T5 PM through parameter sensitivity analysis based 
on response surface method and Monte Carlo simulation method. Liu et al. [193] 
conducted sensitivity analysis in structural crashworthiness based on the Sobol’ direct 
integral method. Tang et al. [195] design a set of optimized dimensional parameters 
for constructing the six-cable-driven PM of FAST based on the sensitivity design 
method and tension performance evaluating functions. 
The purpose of sensitivity analysis is to determine main/subordinate parameters to 
the performance evaluating functions, so as to improve the optimization design effi￾ciency by reducing the design parameters scale. However, there are few reports in this 
field, and thus, the application of the sensitivity analysis results in the optimization 
design should be enriched in the future research. 
Since traditional optimization algorithms do not have the ability to jump out 
of the local optima and obtain non-dominated solutions, intelligent optimization 
algorithms have attracted more attention for the multi-objective optimization design 
of PMs. However, their premature convergence and high computational cost are 
their two main shortcomings. The hybrid use of intelligent optimization algorithms 
and their combination with traditional optimization algorithms were studied to solve 
the former, and the mapping model was proposed to solve the latter. Therefore, 
further developing the theory of intelligent optimization algorithms by increasing the 
population size without significantly increasing the computational cost, establishing 
the analytical expression of GPIs and design parameters, and achieving a highly 
precise and efficient mapping model are the main challenges facing today for the 
multi-objective optimization design of PMs.30 1 Introduction
1.4 Multi-Objective Optimization Methods 
Due to the complex coupling and competition of multiple performance indices, it is 
difficult for multi-objective optimization design to obtain a global optimal solution 
like single-objective optimization design; e.g., the increase of workspace volume 
may lead to the decline of stiffness and dynamic performance of PMs. At present, 
there are three commonly used methods for multi-objective optimization design: the 
comprehensive objective, Pareto frontier, and principal component analysis (PCA) 
methods. 
1.4.1 Comprehensive Objective Method 
The principle of the comprehensive objective method is to define the sum of the 
weights of multiple performance indices as a comprehensive index (the sum of the 
weight factors is equal to 1) [146, 162, 196]. Its advantage is that a global optimum 
can finally be obtained and is easy to implement. Huang et al. and Xu et al. [33, 197] 
obtained multiple sets of global optima under different weight factor combinations, 
providing multiple sets of optimized results for decision makers. The objective func￾tion dimension is non-uniform, and different weighting factors should be optimized 
separately. Furthermore, the determination of the weighting factors is subjective, 
which requires considerable calculation time and reduces optimization efficiency. 
This is a prior decision approach that is suitable for situations where the weight 
factors of each performance index have been clarified before optimization. 
1.4.2 Pareto Frontier Method 
Compared with the comprehensive objective method that could only obtain a set of 
optimal solutions at one time. The Pareto frontier method obtains non-dominated 
solution sets for multiple performance indices. For the optimization design of two 
objective functions, the Pareto frontier is usually a curve; for the optimization design 
of more than two objective functions, the Pareto frontier is usually a hypersurface. 
Stan et al. [198] used the GA to optimize the kinematic performance and workspace 
volume of a PRRRP PM and obtained the Pareto frontier. The greatest advantage 
of the Pareto frontier is that both the optimal solution for each performance index 
and multiple sets of non-dominated solutions can be obtained for decision makers, 
belonging to the after-the-fact decision. However, selecting a set of optimal solutions 
from a large number of non-dominated solution sets requires decision makers to have 
extensive engineering experience and certain subjectivity. Sun et al. [115] and Qi 
et al. [149] defined the minimum sum of squares of the difference between a set of 
non-dominated solutions and other non-dominated solutions in the Pareto frontier as1.4 Multi-Objective Optimization Methods 31
the cooperative equilibrium point. This point is regarded as the optimal solution for 
decision makers. The concept is equivalent to assuming that the objective functions 
are equally important, which is unreasonable in actual engineering. Therefore, a 
universal method has not yet been established for selecting the optimal solution 
according to the different weights of the objective functions on the Pareto frontier. 
1.4.3 PCA Method 
The principle of the PCA method [199–201] is to integrate many original variables 
into a few comprehensive indices with minimal information loss. It reduces the scale 
of evaluation functions by recombining original indices Z1, Z2…, Zm (such as m 
indices) with certain correlations into a set of fewer and uncorrelated comprehensive 
indices Fp to replace the original indices (p < m). The comprehensive index should 
reflect the information represented by the original variable Zp to the greatest extent 
and ensure the independence of the new indices [202]. It can eliminate the correlation 
among evaluation indices and reduce the effort of index selection and computational 
cost. The larger the absolute value of the correlation coefficient among objective 
functions, the more suitable it is for PCA. The closer the absolute value is to 0, the 
less suitable it is for PCA. In the comprehensive evaluation function, the weight 
of each principal component is its contribution rate, which reflects the proportion 
of the information contained in the original data of the principal component to the 
total information. Such determination of weights is objective and reasonable, thus 
eliminating the shortcoming of subjectivity for the determination of weight factor in 
the comprehensive objective method. 
Li et al. [203] used the PCA method to optimize the local linear velocity trans￾mission performance, the local angular velocity transmission performance, the input 
motion/force transmission performance, and the output motion/force transmission 
performance indices of a 5-PSS/UPU PM and the average power, torque fluctuation, 
and average power-deviation performance index of a 4-DOF redundant hybrid anthro￾pomorphic arm [204]. Based on the PCA method, Zeng et al. [205] considered the 
global condition number, global isotropic coefficient, and global minimum singular 
value indices as objective functions and established a multi-objective optimization 
model of a Delta PM based on the PCA method. Sun et al. [206] combined the 
BP neural network and PCA method to synthesize the kinematic condition number, 
minimum singular value, kinematic manipulability, and inertial force performance 
indices of a planar 2RR PM. However, the PCA method is not suitable for situations 
where the correlation among indices is not strong. The cumulative contribution rate 
of the first few extracted principal components should reach a high level (with the 
recommended value being 85%). The explanation of the principal components is 
generally somewhat vague, and the physical meaning is not clear and not as defined 
as the meaning of the original variables. This is the price of the dimensionality 
reduction of the variables.32 1 Introduction
The acquisition of multi-objective optimization methods mainly includes the 
comprehensive objective, Pareto frontier, and PCA methods. Due to the non-uniform 
dimensions among the objective functions, the physical meaning of the comprehen￾sive objective method is not clear; furthermore, it needs to be optimized separately 
for each weight combination, which is time-consuming. The Pareto frontier method 
can obtain a set of non-dominated solutions; however, it is a challenge to select the 
optimal solution according to each set of weight combinations. In the PCA method, 
the weight of each principal component is determined objectively by its contribution 
rate, but its vague physical interpretation is its main disadvantage. Therefore, estab￾lishing a multi-objective optimization method for PMs that can objectively reflect 
the weight of each objective and has a clear physical meaning is a major challenge. 
1.5 Summary 
Performance indices, optimization design algorithms, and multi-objective opti￾mization methods are important research directions for investigating PMs and are 
discussed in detail in this work. First, performance indices were discussed. Then, 
optimization algorithms were analyzed based on the traditional and intelligent opti￾mization algorithms and the ways to improve these algorithms. Finally, the multi￾objective optimization methods were discussed. However, there are still avenues for 
improvement. 
1. Although existing theories can obtain the analytical expressions of LPIs, it is 
difficult to obtain analytical expressions of a workspace in most cases. Therefore, 
it is difficult to directly obtain the analytical expression of GPIs by analyzing 
LPIs. Usually, the average or variance of LPIs for the finite discrete points in 
a workspace is used as the GPI. This method reduces the calculation accuracy 
and efficiency and greatly increases the computational cost at the optimization 
design stage. Therefore, establishing an analytical model for a regular workspace 
is an important challenge. In addition, considering the influence of dynamic 
parameters such as the inertial force, Coriolis force, and centrifugal force when 
evaluating the kinematic performance and decoupling the influence of gravity, 
flexibility, and friction when evaluating the stiffness performance are urgent needs 
to be addressed in terms of the performance indices of PMs. 
2. The multi-parameter, multi-constraints, highly coupled multi-objective func￾tions, and multi-extreme values of the optimization models of PMs have brought 
considerable challenges to the optimization design of mechanisms. The research 
focus of optimization algorithms has transitioned from traditional optimization 
algorithms to intelligent optimization algorithms. However, due to the time￾consuming calculation of GPIs, the shortcomings of intelligent optimization 
algorithms, such as their low computational efficiency and high computational 
cost, have become increasingly prominent. Establishing approximate expressions 
between GPIs and mechanism design parameters through mapping models is anReferences 33
important way to improve optimization efficiency. However, the sample data used 
for response surface modeling are calculated by the numerical method of discrete 
points, which contains unavoidable errors. On the other hand, the fitting algorithm 
also has unavoidable errors. Therefore, controlling these errors and improving the 
accuracy of the mapping model are important challenges to improve the optimiza￾tion design efficiency. The combination of intelligent optimization algorithms 
with traditional optimization algorithms to avoid premature convergence and 
the uncontrollable convergence of intelligent optimization algorithms is another 
important challenge to overcome for PM optimization algorithms. 
3. The Pareto frontier method can be used to obtain a group of Pareto optimal solu￾tion sets, thus solving the shortcoming that the comprehensive objective method 
can only obtain a set of optimal solutions at a time. However, selecting a set of 
optimal solutions from the optimal solution sets according to the importance of 
the objective function still relies on the experience of the decision maker, which 
is subjective. To address the shortcoming of the Pareto frontier, the PCA method 
takes the contribution rate of each principal component as its weight, which 
provides a certain objectivity and avoids the defect of artificially determining the 
weight. Although the PCA method has the above advantages, it is not suitable 
for situations where the objective functions are not strongly correlated because 
the physical meaning is unclear. Establishing an objective multi-objective opti￾mization method with a clear physical meaning is another challenge that needs 
to be overcome for the optimization design of PMs; this challenge will require 
systematic and in-depth research. 
4. It is worth emphasizing that the multi-objective optimization design approaches 
have to heavily lean on reliable LPIs. In particular, some LPIs have undefined 
physical meaning caused by the dimensional inhomogeneity of elements of the 
fundamental matrices, including the Jacobian, stiffness, compliance, and mass 
matrices. Obviously, these LPIs cannot be recommended for including in the 
multi-objective methods. Thus, establishing LPIs that have a defined physical 
meaning with dimensional homogeneity or are dimensionless, decoupled, and 
frame-free is also an important challenge to overcome for the performance 
measures of PMs. 
In addition to performance indices, optimization algorithms, and optimization 
methods, the design of defect identification and repair research aimed at exploring 
factors that cause a greater difference between the theoretical performance and actual 
performance of PMs is also one of the current development directions.

Kinematic Performance Analysis 
and Optimization of Parallel 
Manipulators Without Actuation 
Redundancy 
Kinematic performance analysis and optimization of PMs are essential for the actual 
design and control, which have attracted increasing attention in both academia and 
industry. Many indices have been proposed and widely used in the PMs, such as 
manipulability [1, 2] and condition number [3] based on the algebraic characteris￾tics of the Jacobian kinematic matrix, and motion/force transmissibility [4] based 
on the screw theory. This chapter focuses on the PMs without actuation redundancy. 
The kinematic performance analysis and optimization of this type of PM will be 
presented and discussed in detail by using three different kinematic indices, including 
the condition number index, the motion/force transmission index, and the proposed 
motion/force constraint index. First, the basics of screw theory will be introduced 
briefly. Then, the definition of the condition number index based on the dimension￾ally homogeneous Jacobian matrix [5–8] and its applications on three PMs will be 
presented. Next, the motion/force transmission index proposed by Liu et al. [4, 9–11] 
will be introduced simply, and three PMs will be selected to show the applicability 
of this index. Finally, a new motion/force constraint index proposed by the authors, 
which is useful for the performance evaluation of overconstrained PMs without actu￾ation redundancy, will be introduced in detail, and two PMs will be used to verify 
the effectiveness of the proposed constraint index. 
2.1 Basics of Screw Theory 
The basic knowledge of screw theory [12, 13] is introduced first. In screw theory, a 
unit screw $ is defined as 
$ = (s; s0) = (s; r × s + hs), (2.1) 
where s is a unit vector along the direction of the screw axis, r is the position vector 
of any point on the screw axis, and h is the screw pitch.

A screw $C = (sr; s0r )that is reciprocal to a set of screws, $1, $2, ..., $n, is defined 
as 
$i ◦ $C = si · s0r + sr · s0i = 0 i = 1, 2,..., n (2.2) 
where ◦ and $i represent the reciprocal product and the ith screw of the screw set, 
respectively. A screw is called a twist when it is used to represent the instantaneous 
motion of a rigid body. Additionally, a wrench screw is used to represent a force or 
a coaxial couple when acting on a rigid body. In the following analysis, $ij denotes 
the unit twist that is associated with the jth kinematic joint of the ith limb, while $Ci j 
denotes the jth unit constraint wrench acting on the moving platform because of the 
ith limb. 
2.2 Condition Number Indices and Applications 
2.2.1 Condition Number Indices 
Based on the algebraic characteristics of the Jacobian matrix of a PM, several indices 
have been proposed and widely used for performance evaluation and optimization, 
such as manipulability [1] and condition number [3]. However, these indices are not 
sound [14]; there is much controversy surrounding these Jacobian-based indices. 
First, they are coordinate-dependent. In addition, the units of the elements in the 
Jacobian matrix are inconsistent when applied to the PMs with both rotational and 
translational DOFs, which leads to unclear physical meanings and subsequently 
causes erroneous interpretations. Some methods have been proposed to avoid the 
above problems, and one method that is widely used to deal with this inconsistency 
is to establish a dimensionally homogeneous Jacobian matrix [5–8]. In this method, 
a characteristic length L is used to homogenize the original Jacobian matrix J. The 
new homogeneous matrix Jh is then formulated as follows: 
Jh = (
A 1 
L B )
, (2.3) 
where matrices A and B denote the corresponding translational and rotational 
mapping Jacobian matrices in the original Jacobian matrix J. 
To obtain L, the isotropic design of the mechanism should be used in the Jacobian 
matrix [5, 6]. The Jacobian matrix is isotropic if it satisfies 
JT 
h Jh=
( AT A 1 
L AT B 
1 
L B AT 1 
L2 BT B
)
=
(α2 I p 0p×q 
0q×p α2 I q
)
, (2.4)2.2 Condition Number Indices and Applications 45
where p and q denote the DOFs of translation and rotation, respectively. I p and I q 
denote the p × p and q × q identity matrices, respectively. 0q×p and 0p×q denote the 
q × p and p × q zero matrices, respectively. 
Dexterity is defined as the capability of a robot to arbitrarily change its pose, 
or apply forces and torques in arbitrary directions [1]. The condition number of 
the Jacobian matrix is an important local dexterity index that is used to describe the 
kinematic performance of PM. The condition number c of the homogeneous Jacobian 
matrix Jh is given by 
c = || Jh|| · || J−1 
h ||, (2.5) 
where the notation |·| is defined as a 2-norm of the matrix. Here, we use the reciprocal 
of the condition number, i.e., C = 1
/
c. The reciprocal of the condition number 
ranges from zero to one. And the closer the reciprocal of the condition number is to 
unity, the better the kinematic performance of this configuration will be. 
To provide a global description of the mechanism performance, the global condi￾tioning index (GCI) that was proposed by Gosselin et al. [15] is used in this book. 
The purpose of calculating the GCI is to obtain the condition number distribution 
over the whole workspace. The GCI is defined as 
GCI =
{
W CdW 
W , (2.6) 
where W denotes the reachable workspace. The GCI ranges from zero to unity, and 
a GCI value that is closer to unity indicates better dexterity. 
In this section, the condition number indices based on the dimensionally homoge￾neous Jacobian matrix are used to evaluate and optimize the kinematic performance 
of three PMs, namely the 6PSS PM, the 2-(PRR)2RH PM [16], and the 2PRS-PRRU 
PM [17]. 
2.2.2 Example 1: 6PSS PM 
• Structure description 
The computer-aided design (CAD) model of the 6PSS PM is shown in Fig. 2.1, 
which can be intuitively seen as a 6-DOF PM. The moving platform is connected to 
the fixed base through six identical kinematic PSS limbs. Through actuating six P 
joints, the 6PSS PM can achieve three translational and three rotational outputs. For 
each PSS limb, the first and second S joints are connected to the slider and moving 
platform, respectively. Additionally, the directions of guides of limbs 1 and 2 are 
parallel to each other, as well as limbs 3 and 4, and limbs 5 and 6. It should be noted 
that the angle θb between guides 2 and 3 (or guides 4 and 5, guides 6 and 1) is always 
equal to 120◦. Let Ai (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) denote the central points of the first S joint46 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …
Fig. 2.1 CAD model of the 
6PSS PM 
in each limb, while the central point of the second S joint in each limb is denoted by 
Bi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). 
Two coordinate frames are established as shown in Fig. 2.1. A fixed reference 
coordinate frame O − xyz is attached to the fixed base, and the origin O is at the 
midpoint of the fixed base. Let the x-axis always be perpendicular to the direction of 
guide 5 or 6, and the y-axis always point along the direction of guide 5 or 6. The z-axis 
points upward vertically. A moving platform coordinate frame o − uvw is attached 
to the moving platform, as shown in Fig. 2.1. The u-axis is always perpendicular to 
the direction of the angular bisector of ∠B2oB3, the v-axis always points along the 
direction of the angular bisector of ∠B2oB3, and the w-axis points upward vertically 
with respect to the moving platform. The architectural parameters of the 6PSS PM are 
defined as follows: oBi = Rm, Ai Bi = l and ∠B1oB6 = ∠B2oB3 = ∠B4oB5 = θm. 
Additionally, the distance between two parallel guides is defined as 2lb here. 
• Inverse kinematics 
The inverse kinematics should be developed first for the performance evaluation and 
optimization of the 6PSS PM by using the condition number index. For the 6PSS 
PM, the inverse kinematics is to find the actuated displacements qi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6), given the locations and orientations of the moving platform, i.e., x, y, z, α, β, 
and γ. The angles α, β, and γ denote the rotation angle around the x-, y-, and z-axes, 
respectively. 
The rotation matrix between the moving coordinate frame o − uvw and the fixed 
coordinate frame O − xyz can be written as 
O Ro =
⎛
⎝
cβcγ sαsβcγ − cαsγ cαsβcγ + sαsγ
cβsγ sαsβsγ + cαcγ cαsβsγ − sαcγ
−sβ sαcβ cαcβ
⎞
⎠, (2.7) 
where s and c denote sine and cosine functions, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. 2.1, the position vectors Ai Bi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with respect 
to the fixed coordinate frame are defined as li , and vector p = (
x y z )T denotes the 
position vector of the point o with respect to the fixed coordinate frame O − xyz. 
The position vectors O Ai and oBi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with respect to the fixed2.2 Condition Number Indices and Applications 47
coordinate frame are denoted as ai and bi , respectively. Using the rotation matrix 
O Ro and angle θm, the vectors bi can be directly obtained as

. (2.8) 
Using the distance lb and angle θb, the vectors ai also can be deduced, which are 
the expressions about actuated displacement qi . As shown in Fig. 2.1, the closed-loop 
kinematic equation for each limb (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) can be written in the following 
form as 
ai + li = p + bi . (2.9) 
Through solving Eq. (2.9), we can obtain the relationships between the vectors ai 
and locations and orientations of the moving platform (x, y, z, α, β, γ ), from which 
the actuated displacement qi can be obtained. 
• Velocity analysis 
The Jacobian matrix can describe the mapping relationship between the velocities 
of inputs and outputs. There are some approaches to obtaining the Jacobian matrix 
J, including the derivative method, velocity projection method, and so on. Here, the 
velocity projection method is used for the example of the 6PSS PM, and the direct 
derivative method will be applied to examples 2 and 3 in this chapter. 
For the second S joint connected to the moving platform, the velocity of the central 
point, vBi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), can be expressed as 
vBi = vo + ωo × bi , (2.10) 
where vo = (
x ˙ y ˙ z˙
)T denotes the linear velocity of the origin point of moving 
platform, and ωo = (
α˙ β˙ γ˙
)T denotes the angular velocity of the moving platform. 
In addition, the relationship between the velocity of the first S joint, vAi (i = 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6), and actuated velocity q˙i can be expressed as 
vAi = ˙qi di , (2.11) 
where di denotes the direction vector of guide i with respect to the fixed frame 
O − xyz.48 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …
According to the velocity projection method, the projection velocity of two S 
joints on the link should be the same, i.e., vT 
Ai · li = vT 
Bi · li . Therefore, the mapping 
between the actuated velocity q ˙ = (
q˙1 q˙2 q˙3 q˙4 q˙5 q˙6
)T and output velocity V ˙ = (
x ˙ y ˙ z ˙ α˙ β˙ γ˙
)T can be obtained by using Eqs. (2.10)–(2.11) as 
q ˙ = J V ˙ , (2.12)

• Homogeneous Jacobian matrix 
Here, the method proposed by Angeles et al. [5, 6] is used to generate a homogeneous 
Jacobian matrix of the 6PSS PM. The new homogeneous matrix Jh can be formulated 
as follows: 
Jh = Jdiag(
111 1 
L 
1 
L 
1 
L
)
= (
A 1 
L B )
, (2.14) 
where L is the characteristic length. A and B are two 6 × 3 matrices, in which the A 
is the translational mapping matrix, and the B is the rotational mapping matrix. 
Based on Eq. (2.4), the homogeneous Jacobian matrix Jh is isotropic if it satisfies 
JT 
h Jh=
( AT A 1 
L AT B 
1 
L B AT 1 
L2 BT B
)
=
(α2 I 3 03 
03 α2 I 3
)
, (2.15) 
where I 3 denotes a 3 × 3 identity matrix and 03 denotes a 3 × 3 zero matrix. 
However, there is no solution for Eq. (2.15), which means that the isotropic archi￾tecture for the 6PSS PM is not feasible [5]. Based on the above situation, we can 
find an architecture that is close to isotropy. Here the length of the moving platform, 
Rm, is used as characteristic link lengths L to generate a new homogeneous Jacobian 
matrix, and the homogeneous Jacobian matrix can thus be written as 
Jh =
(
A 1 
Rm B
)
. (2.16) 
• Local and global dexterity performances 
Here, the reciprocal of the condition number, i.e., C = 1/c (C ∈ [0, 1]), as intro￾duced in Sect. 2.2.1, is taken as the local dexterity index to describe the kinematic 
performance of the 6PSS PM. Because the 6PSS PM has three position outputs and 
three orientation outputs, the local dexterity performance C in the different positions2.2 Condition Number Indices and Applications 49
and orientations is discussed separately here. In this section, the architecture param￾eters of the 6PSS PM are set as follows: Rm = 250 mm, l = 440 mm, lb = 60 mm, 
and θm = 30◦. The distribution variations of C in the three-dimensional position 
workspace are presented first, as shown in Fig. 2.2a, in which the ranges of positions 
and orientations are set as −50 mm ≤ x ≤ 50 mm, −50 mm ≤ y ≤ 50 mm, 225 mm ≤
z ≤ 275 mm, and α = β = γ = 0°. For clarity, the distribution variations of C when z 
= 250 mm are also presented, as shown in Fig. 2.2b, from which it is obvious that the 
distribution is symmetrical about the plane x = 0, and the kinematic performances 
near the central region are better than others. 
Similarly, the distribution variations of C in the three-dimensional orientation 
workspace are also presented in Fig. 2.3a, in which the ranges of positions and 
orientations are set as x = y = z = 0, −20° ≤ α ≤ −20°, −20° ≤ β ≤ −20°, and −
20° ≤ γ ≤ −20°. The distribution variations of C when γ = 0° are also presented, as 
shown in Fig. 2.3b, from which it is also obvious that the distribution is symmetrical 
about the plane β = 0°. The kinematic performances near the central region are better 
than others, which are similar to those in the three-dimensional position workspace.
The GCI is necessary to provide a global performance description of the 6PSS 
PM. Here, the purpose of calculating the GCI is to obtain the condition number 
distribution over the whole V and is defined as 
GCI =
{
V CdV 
V , (2.17) 
where V denotes the volume of position workspace or orientation workspace. 
Based on the results in Figs. 2.2a and 2.3a, the corresponding GCI can be calcu￾lated as 0.4443 and 0.2632, respectively, and designers can improve the kinematic 
performance by optimizing link parameters.

• Optimization of design parameters 
Here, the iterative search method is used for the dimensional optimization of the 6PSS 
PM. Since the influence of design parameters on the position and orientation char￾acteristics may not be the same, these two situations are considered simultaneously 
during the optimization, and the Rm and l are defined as design parameters here. 
Considering the actual applications, the variation ranges of two design parameters 
are respectively defined as 230 mm ≤ Rm ≤ 270 mm, 420 mm ≤ l ≤ 460 mm. Similar 
to the above section, the position ranges are set as −50 mm ≤ x ≤ 50 mm, −50 mm 
≤ y ≤ 50 mm, and 225 mm ≤ z ≤ 275 mm, and the orientation ranges are set as −
20° ≤ α ≤ −20°, −20° ≤ β ≤ −20°, and −20° ≤ γ ≤ −20°. 
Through iterative search and calculation, the distributions of GCI with different 
combinations of design parameters can be obtained, as shown in Figs. 2.4a, b. It can be 
found that even with the same combination of design parameters, the distributions of 
GCI in the position workspace are different from that in the orientation workspace. In 
the case of optimization regarding position workspace, the maximum of GCI occurs 
when Rm = 270 mm, l = 420 mm, as shown in Fig. 2.5a, and the value of GCI is 
0.4737. However, in the case of optimization regarding orientation workspace, the 
maximum of GCI occurs when Rm = 230 mm, l = 420 mm, as shown in Fig. 2.5b, 
and the value of GCI is 0.2714. Designers can choose one of these combinations for 
different applications.
2.2.3 Example 2: 2-(PRR)2RH PM 
• Structure description 
As shown in Fig. 2.6a, the CAD model of the 2-(PRR)2RH PM is composed of a fixed 
base, two identical actuated limbs, and a moving platform, which has been proven to 
be a 3T1R PM [16]. Beginning from the fixed base, each limb is a hybrid kinematic 
limb that consists of a 2-PRR planar parallel subchain and an RH serial subchain. In2.2 Condition Number Indices and Applications 51

the RH subchain, the axes of the R joint and the H joint are parallel to each other, 
and they are perpendicular to the axes of the R joints of the 2-PRR subchain. The 
thread pitches of the two H joints in the two limbs are equal and opposite. Let Aij 
for i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 denote the central point of the R joint, and Bi for i = 1, 2 denotes 
the midpoint of the lines A12 A22 and A32 A42, respectively. The two sliders intersect 
the XY plane at points A1 and A2, which lie on the triangle O A1 A2, as shown in 
Fig. 2.6b.
Several coordinate frames are established as shown in Fig. 2.6b. The origin of a 
fixed reference frame O-XYZ is coincident with the point O of the fixed triangle base
ΔA1O A2. The Y-axis points in the direction of the angular bisector of ∠A1O A2, 
and the Z-axis points downwards. A moving coordinate frame o-xyz is attached to 
the central point o of the moving platform. In addition, a local coordinate frame 
oi − xi yi zi for i = 1, 2, is attached to the middle R joint in the ith PRR subchain, as 
shown in Fig. 2.6b. Note that the motion of the ith 2-PRR subchain is limited within 
a plane Li for i = 1, 2, which is perpendicular to O Ai . A plane L3 coincides with the52 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …

YZ plane. The angle 2α is measured from plane L1 to plane L2, in which the angle 
α is defined as the layout angle. The distance from the origin of the fixed coordinate 
frame to the sliders is defined as E. The displacement of the ith actuated P joints is 
defined as di for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. The thicknesses of the moving platform and the link l4 
are 2e1 and 2e2, respectively, and h denotes the thread pitch of the moving platform. 
The architectural parameters of the 2-(PRR)2RH PM are set as follows: A11 A12 =
A21 A22 = A31 A32 = A41 A42 = l1 = 100 mm, A12 A22 = A32 A42 = l2 = 100 mm, 
A13 B1 = A33 B2 = l3 = 20 mm, A13 A14 = A33 A34 = l4 = 400 mm, E = 420 mm, e1 
= e2 = 10 mm, and h = 5 mm. 
• Inverse kinematics 
The inverse kinematics should be developed first for the performance evaluation and 
optimization of the 2-(PRR)2RH PM by using the condition number index. For the 
2-(PRR)2RH PM, the inverse kinematics is to find the actuated displacements d1, d2, 
d3, and d4, given the locations and orientations of the moving platform, i.e., Xo, Yo, 
Zo, and ϕ. 
Let O p = (
Xo Yo Zo
)
be the position vector of the origin of the moving platform

where J = J−1 
q Jx is a 4 × 4 Jacobian matrix. 
• Homogeneous Jacobian matrix 
Considering the method proposed by Angeles et al. [5, 6], a characteristic length is 
used to homogenize the original Jacobian matrix of the 2-(PRR)2RH PM. The new 
homogeneous matrix Jh is then formulated as follows: 
Jh = Jdiag(

L B )
, (2.32) 
where L is the characteristic length. Matrices A and B denote a 4 × 3 matrix and a 4 
× 1 matrix, which correspond to the translational and rotational mapping matrices, 
respectively. 
To obtain L, the isotropic design of the mechanism should be used in the Jacobian 
matrix [5, 6]. The Jacobian matrix is isotropic if it satisfies

Finally, the homogeneous Jacobian matrix Jh can be obtained by substituting

• Local and global dexterity performances 
Here, we also use the reciprocal of the condition number, i.e., C = 1/c (C ∈ [0, 1]) as 
the local dexterity index to describe the kinematic performance of the 2-(PRR)2RH 
PM. For example, Fig. 2.7 shows the mapping of the reciprocal of the condition 
number of a 2-(PRR)2RH PM with Zo = 450mm and α = 45◦.
As shown in Fig. 2.7, the distribution of C within the reachable workspace is 
symmetrical about plane X = 0. And from Fig. 2.7, it can be found that the closer 
the middle part of the region is, the bigger the reciprocal of condition number will 
be, which means that the kinematic performance in this region is better than others. 
Similar to the 6PSS PM, the GCI [15] is also used to evaluate the global dexterity 
characteristic here. By changing the value of the layout angle α, the corresponding 
GCI can be calculated, and the results are as shown in Fig. 2.8. From Fig. 2.8, we 
find that the maximum value of GCI occurs at α = 45◦, which is equal to 0.1802.56 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …

• Optimization of design parameters 
In this section, we focus on the study of optimization of the design parameters 
when α = 45◦. The GCI of the 2-(PRR)2RH PM is highly dependent on the design 
parameters. Under actual usage conditions, the design parameters of the mechanism 
cannot be selected arbitrarily because of the effects of assembly and movement. Here, 
the parameter-finiteness normalization method (PFNM), which was proposed by Liu 
et al. [4, 18], is used to optimize the parameters. Compared to traditional methods such 
as the objective-function method [19, 20], PFNM eliminates the influence of infinite 
parameters. Based on the normalization factor, this method achieves the reduction of 
the parameter number and the boundary limitation of each normalized parameter and 
also converts the infinite parameter space into a finite space [18]. However, it is still 
difficult to describe the performance of the 2-(PRR)2RH PM using the five parameters 
E, l1, l2, l3, and l4. Based on the special structure of the proposed manipulator, the2.2 Condition Number Indices and Applications 57
parameter l2 has no influence on the kinematic performance through the change of 
each architecture parameter separately, namely the parameter l2 does not affect the 
magnitude of GCI at every height. Thus, the parameter l2 is not considered. Without 
loss of generality, we let l1 = l2, and l3 = l4. We can therefore obtain the 2-(PRR)2RH 
PM using the three design parameters E, l1, and l3, and we define 
D = E + l1 + l3 
3 , (2.35) 
where D is a normalized factor. The non-dimensional and normalized parameters r1, 
r2, and r3 are obtained 
r1 = E 
D , r2 = l3 
D , r3 = l1 
D . (2.36) 
Under real usage conditions, the three normalized parameters should satisfy 
⎧
⎨
⎩
r1 + r2 + r3 = 3
(
1 + √
2r2
)

. (2.37) 
Using the PFNM method [18], the parameter design space (PDS) can be obtained 
as shown in Fig. 2.9. The triangle ABC shown in Fig. 2.9a is the set of all possible 
points. In the plan view, where the ΔABC is described in another form as shown in 
Fig. 2.9b, the data points can be observed more directly. The relationship between the 
parameters in spatial space (r1, r2, r3) and those in plan space (s, t) can be described 
as follows:

(2.38)
The procedure of parameter optimization is as follows: 
Step 1: Determine the design parameters. By considering the actual area of the 
mechanism, the value of the normalized factor is set as 333 mm. 
Step 2: Identify an optimal region. The distributions of the GCI can be obtained as 
shown in Fig. 2.10. By considering the kinematic performance of the mechanism, 
the region where GCI ≥ 0.2 is chosen as the optimal design region here.
Step 3: Select a group of data points from the optimal region. 12 groups of data points 
that are comparatively better than the other groups are chosen. The non-dimensional 
parameters r1, r2, r3 can be obtained using Eq. (2.38). Using Eqs. (2.36) and (2.38),58 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …

the five design parameters E, l1, l2, l3, and l4, and the two planar space parameters s 
and t can be obtained, as listed in Table 2.1.
Step 4: Check whether the dimensional parameters obtained in Step 3 are suitable 
or not for an actual usage condition. If it satisfies the actual assembly condition, the 
procedure is finished; otherwise, return to Step 3 to choose another group of data 
from the optimal region, and repeat Steps 3 and 4. 
The method provides various solutions for the design parameters, and the design 
parameters in group “*” are the data from the 2-(PRR)2RH PM proposed at first. 
All the GCI values of the 12 groups listed in Table 2.1 are better than 0.1802, and 
designers can choose one of these combinations for different applications.2.2 Condition Number Indices and Applications 59

2.2.4 Example 3: 2PRS-PRRU PM 
• Structure description 
The CAD prototype of the 2PRS-PRRU PM is shown in Fig. 2.11, which is a 2R1T 
PM [17]. The PM is composed of a fixed base, a moving platform, and three actuated 
limbs. Limbs 1 and 2 are two identical PRS limbs, and limb 3 is a PRRU limb. Limbs 1 
and 2 are coplanar and limited to within the plane L1, which is always perpendicular 
to the plane L2. The plane L2 represents the symmetrical plane to which the limb 
3 belongs. Beginning from the fixed base, the P joints connected to the sliders are 
parallel to each other. For limbs 1 and 2, the R joint is connected to the P joint, and the 
revolute axes of the two R joints are parallel to each other. Meanwhile, the revolute 
axes of the R joints in limbs 1 and 2 are perpendicular to the P joint. The PRS limbs 
are connected to the moving platform by an S joint, which the centers are limited in 
the plane L1. For limb 3, the revolute axes of the two R joints are parallel to each 
other, and the revolute axes of the R joints are also perpendicular to the plane L2. 
The first revolute axis of the U joint is parallel to the moving platform and limited in 
the plane L2, and the second revolute axis is perpendicular to the moving platform. 
The 2PRS-PRRU PM is actuated by three P joints.
Let Bi (i = 1, 2, 3) denote the central points of the first R joints in each limb, 
while the center of the second R joint in limb 3 is denoted by D3. The centers of the 
S joints in limbs 1 and 2 are denoted by C1 and C2, respectively, and the center of 
the U joint in limb 3 is denoted by C3, which lies in the middle of the line C1C2. The 
sliders of limbs interest with the fixed base at points Ai (i = 1, 2, 3), which lie on 
the plane A1 A2 A3, as shown in Fig. 2.11.60 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …
Fig. 2.11 2PRS-PRRU PM: a CAD model and b schematic representation
Two coordinate frames are established as shown in Fig. 2.11. A fixed reference 
coordinate frame O-xyz is attached to the fixed base, and the origin O is at the midpoint 
of line A1 A2. Let the x-axis always point in the direction of O A2, the y-axis point 
along O A3, and the z-axis point downward vertically. A moving coordinate frame 
o-uvw is attached to the moving platform, and the origin o coincides with point C3, 
as shown in Fig. 2.11. Let the u-axis point in the direction of C2C3 and the v-axis 
be perpendicular to the line C2C3. The w-axis is acting downward vertically with 
respect to the moving platform. The architectural parameters of the 2PRS-PRRU PM 
are defined as follows: O A1 = O A2 = a = 300 mm, O A3 = h = 250 mm, B1C1 =
l1 = 280 mm, B2C2 = l2 = 280 mm, B3C3 = l3 = 225 mm, C3 D3 = l4 = 225 mm, 
C1o = C2o = r = 120 mm. 
• Inverse kinematics 
The inverse kinematics of the 2PRS-PRRU PM involves the calculations of the actu￾ated joint parameters (d1, d2, d3) given the orientation and position parameters of 
the moving platform (α, β, Pz), where α and β denote the rotation angles around 
the v- and u-axes of the moving coordinate, respectively, and Pz denotes the distance 
between the points O and o. 
Because the rotation about the w-axis is always equal to zero [21, 22], the rotation 
matrix between the moving coordinate frame o-uvw and the fixed coordinate frame 
O-xyz is given by 
O Ro =
⎛
⎝
cα sαsβ sαcβ
0 cβ −sβ
−sα cαsβ cαcβ
⎞
⎠. (2.39) 
Meanwhile, the rotation matrix can also be obtained through the u-v-w Euler angle, 
and the transformation mapping is given by2.2 Condition Number Indices and Applications 61
O Ro =
⎛
⎝
cθ3cθ4 −cθ3sθ4 sθ3

−cψsθ3cθ4 + sψsθ4 cψsθ3sθ4 + sψcθ4 cψcθ3 
⎞
⎠, (2.40) 
where ψ, θ3, and θ4 denote the rotation angles around the u-, v- and w-axes of 
the moving coordinate, respectively. 
Apparently, the rotation matrices in Eqs. (2.39) and (2.40) are two different repre￾sentations of the same orientations about the moving platform, and thus, the following 
formulas can be obtained
} sαcβ = sθ3 
−sβ = −sψcθ3 
(2.41) 
Using Eq. (2.41), the angle ψ can be calculated as follows: 
ψ = arcsin(

1 − (sαcβ)

)
. (2.42) 
Thus, the inverse kinematics of the 2PRS-PRRU PM can be expressed as follows

where Jq11 = Pz + rsα − d1, Jq22 = Pz − rsα − d2, Jq33 = Pz − l4sψ − d3, Jx11 =

q Jx X ˙ = J X˙ , (2.47) 
where J = J−1 
q Jx is a 3 × 3 Jacobian matrix. 
• Homogeneous Jacobian matrix 
For the 2PRS-PRRU PM, the length of the moving platform, r, is used as the charac￾teristic/natural link length L to generate a new homogeneous Jacobian matrix. The 
homogeneous Jacobian matrix Jh is then formulated as follows: 
Jh = J diag( 1

L Ft

, (2.48) 
where matrices Fr and Ft denote a 3 × 2 matrix and a 3 × 1 matrix, respectively. 
The matrix Fr represents the mapping of the linear velocities to angular veloci￾ties (

)
, while matrix Ft corresponds to the mapping of the linear 
velocities to linear velocity (

. 
• Local and global dexterity indices 
For clarity, the reciprocal of the condition number, i.e., C = 1/c (C ∈ [0, 1]) is 
still used as the local dexterity index for the 2PRS-PRRU PM here. And the rotation 
ranges of the moving platform are set as follows: −40◦ ≤ α ≤ 40◦, −40◦ ≤ β ≤ 40◦. 
For the 2PRS-PRRU PM, the operating height Pz has no influence on the distribu￾tion of condition number. Based on the architecture parameters mentioned above, 
the distribution variations of the C for the 2PRS-PRRU PM within different orien￾tation workspace are shown in Fig. 2.12. Additionally, through calculation by using 
Eq. (2.6), the value of the GCI of the 2PRS-PRRU PM with these parameters is equal 
to 0.426.
• Optimization of design parameters 
Here, the PFNM method [4, 18] is also used to optimize the design parameters by 
considering the GCI of the 2PRS-PRRU PM. Considering the limitations of rotation 
angles, we restrict the motion capability as α ∈ [−40◦, 40◦], β ∈ [−40◦, 40◦]. 
However, it is difficult to illustrate the performance of the 2PRS-PRRU PM using 
the seven design parameters. Without loss of generality, we let the design parameters 
l1 = l2 = l3 = l4, a = h be used as an example to illustrate the influence of the 
parameters. We can therefore obtain the 2PRS-PRRU PM using the three design 
parameters a, r and l1, and they are normalized as2.2 Condition Number Indices and Applications 63

regions of GCI 
Step 1: Identify the optimal regions. The distributions of the GCI can be obtained, 
as shown in Fig. 2.14. Considering the dexterity of the mechanism, the region where 
GCI ≥ 0.45 is regarded as having ideal dexterity. 
Step 2: Select 9 groups of data points from the optimal region in this study. And the 
chosen parameters should be as far as possible from the bounds of the optimal region. 
Through Eq. (2.52), the non-dimensional parameters e1, e2, and e3 can be obtained. 
Using Eqs. (2.50) and (2.52), we can then obtain the three design parameters a, r, 
and l1, and the two plan space parameters s and t, as listed in Table 2.2.
Step 3: Determine the normalized factor D and dimensional parameters a, r, l1. The 
normalized factor D can be determined considering practical conditions, and D is 
chosen as 250 mm in this study. For example, the design parameters in group “7” are 
chosen as the optimal results, i.e., e1 = 1.10, e2 = 0.83, e3 = 1.07. Then the values 
of design parameters can be obtained using Eq. (2.52), i.e., l1 = l2 = l3 = l4 =
275 mm, a = h = 268 mm, r = 208 mm. 
Step 4: Check whether the dimensional parameters obtained in Step 3 are suitable 
or not for an actual usage condition. If it satisfies the actual assembly condition, the 
procedure is finished; otherwise, return to Step 3 to choose another group of data 
from the optimal region, and repeat Steps 3 and 4.2.3 Motion/Force Transmission Indices and Applications 65

Figure 2.15 shows the comparisons of distributions of dexterity, where the design 
parameters in groups “3”, “6”, and “9” are chosen as examples. From Figs. 2.15a, b, 
we can find that the GCIs in groups “3”, “6”, and “9” are 0.390, 0.231, and 0.480, 
respectively, in which the global performance of the 2PRS-PRRU PM with design 
parameters in group “9” is better than the original result. Designers can choose one 
of these combinations for different applications.
2.3 Motion/Force Transmission Indices and Applications 
2.3.1 Motion/Force Transmission Indices 
Motion/force transmission indices [4, 9–11] reflect the capability of transmission 
between the actuators and the moving platform. It can also be regarded as the 
capability to sustain the payload applied to the end effector. Different from the 
above condition number indices that are based on the kinematic Jacobian matrix, 
the motion/force transmission indices avoid the problems caused by the inconsis￾tencies among the units of the elements of the Jacobian matrix, and they are coor￾dinate independent. Motion/force transmission performance in a configuration can 
be divided into two parts: the input transmission performance and output transmis￾sion performance. The input transmission performance represents the efficiency of 
power transmitted from the actuated joints to the limbs, while the output transmis￾sion performance represents the efficiency of power transmitted from the limbs to the 
moving platform. Considering the input transmission performance and output trans￾mission performance simultaneously, the local transmission index (LTI) is defined 
as

where λi and ηi denote the input transmission index and output transmission index 
of the ith limb, respectively. $Ai denotes the input twist screw (ITS) of the ith limb, 
$Oi denotes the output twist screw (OTS) of the moving platform when locking all 
the input limbs except the ith limb, and $Ti denotes the transmission wrench screw 
(TWS) of the ith limb. The range of Γ is from zero to unity, and a larger Γ indicates 
better motion/force transmissibility. 
Since the LTI only represents the performance of the motion/force transmission in 
a single configuration, which hardly represents the global transmission performance2.3 Motion/Force Transmission Indices and Applications 67
of the robot, it is necessary to define a global index that describes the performance in 
a set of poses. According to the actual situation and the definition of the transmission 
angle [23], it is assumed that the mechanism has good motion/force transmissibility 
when Γ is equal to or bigger than one given value, and these regions are referred 
to as the good transmission workspace (GTW). The index can thus measure the 
global motion/force transmissibility of a PM and is defined as 
σ =
{
SG dW
{
S dW , (2.56) 
where W is the reachable orientation workspace and SG and S denote the areas of 
the GTW and overall reachable workspace, respectively. Here, the overall reachable 
workspace is defined as the curved surface at an operating height with given rotational 
ranges. Apparently, σ ranges from zero to unity. The PM has better transmission 
performance when the σ is closer to unity. 
Here the motion/force transmission indices based on the screw theory are used 
to evaluate and optimize the kinematic performance of three PMs, namely the 6PSS 
PM, the 2PUR-PRU PM [24], and the 2PUR-PSR PM [25]. 
2.3.2 Example 1: 6PSS PM 
• Local and global transmission performances 
Before evaluating the motion/force transmission performance of the 6PSS PM, it is 
necessary to obtain the TWSs and OTSs first. Without loss of generality, we take 
limb 1 as an example. The TWS should be linearly independent of passive twists 
and constraint wrenches simultaneously [26]. Since the actuated joint of limb 1 is a 
P joint, the TWS of limb 1 is reciprocal to the passive joints and is given by 
$T1 = (
l1
/
|l1| a1 × l1
/
|l1|
)
. (2.57) 
Similarly, the TWSs of the other five limbs can be derived as

)
$T6 = (

|l6| a6 × l6

|l6|
)
. (2.58) 
For the 6PSS, there is no constraint wrench inside the manipulator. Therefore, when 
limb 1 is actuated and the other five limbs are locked, the wrench system exerting on 
the moving platform can be written as68 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …
U1 = [
$T2 $T3 $T4 $T5 $T6 ]
. (2.59) 
Accordingly, the instantaneous 1-DOF twist of the moving platform, which is 
denoted $O1, can be obtained using reciprocal screw theory as 
$O1 ◦ U1 = 0. (2.60) 
The other five output twist screws, $Oi (i = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), can be derived in the 
same way. 
The architectural parameters of the 6PSS PM here are the same as used above, 
i.e., Rm = 250mm, l = 440mm, lb = 120mm, and θm = 30◦. In addition, the LTI 
distributions in the different positions and orientations are also discussed separately 
here. The LTI distributions in the three-dimensional position workspace are presented 
first, as shown in Fig. 2.16a, in which the ranges of positions and orientations are set 
as −50 mm ≤ x ≤ 50 mm, −50 mm ≤ y ≤ 50 mm, 225 mm ≤ z ≤ 275 mm, and α =
β = γ = 0°. For clarity, the LTI distributions when z = 250 mm are also presented, 
as shown in Fig. 2.16b, from which it is obvious that the distribution is symmetrical 
about the plane x = 0, and the kinematic performances near the central region are 
better than others. 
Similarly, the LTI distributions in the three-dimensional orientation workspace 
are also presented in Fig. 2.17a, in which the ranges of positions and orientations are 
set as x = y = z = 0, −20° ≤ α ≤ −20°, −20° ≤ β ≤ −20°, and −20° ≤ γ ≤ −
20°. The LTI distributions when γ = 0° are also presented, as shown in Fig. 2.17b, 
from which it is obvious that the distribution is symmetrical about the plane β = 0°, 
and the kinematic performances near the central region are better than others.
Here, the motion/force transmission performance of the 6PSS PM in a config￾uration is regarded as good when the value of LTI is equal to or bigger than 0.7. 
According to the results in Figs. 2.16a and 2.17a, the GTW in the position region of 
the 6PSS PM, σ, is approximately 0.8965, and the GTW in the orientation region of

Fig. 2.17 LTI distribution of the 6PSS PM in the three-dimensional orientation workspace: a three￾dimensional orientation distribution and b αβ plane distribution when γ = 0°
the 6PSS PM, σ, is approximately 0.1165. The above results mean that in the posi￾tion workspace, the motion/force transmission capability with these architectural 
parameters is reasonably good. However, in the orientation workspace, the global 
performance of the 6PSS PM with these given parameters is not ideal. 
• Optimization of design parameters 
Similar to the above optimization of the 6PSS PM with respect to the GCI, the iterative 
search method is also used here for the dimensional optimization of the 6PSS PM 
with respect to the GTW, and the Rm and l are also defined as design parameters. In 
addition, the variation ranges of two design parameters are respectively defined as 
230 mm ≤ Rm ≤ 270 mm, 420 mm ≤ l ≤ 460 mm. Similar to the above section, 
the position ranges are set as −50 mm ≤ x ≤ 50 mm, −50 mm ≤ y ≤ 50 mm, and 
225 mm ≤ z ≤ 275 mm, and the orientation ranges are set as −20° ≤ α ≤ −20°, −
20° ≤ β ≤ −20°, and −20° ≤ γ ≤ −20°. 
Through iterative search and calculation, the distributions of GTW with different 
combinations of design parameters can be obtained, as shown in Figs. 2.18a, b. 
Similar to the optimization results of GCI, the distributions of GTW in the position 
workspace are also different from that in the orientation workspace. In the case of 
optimization regarding position workspace, the maximum of GTW occurs when Rm 
= 230 mm, l = 460 mm, as shown in Fig. 2.19a, and the value of GTW is unity. 
However, in the case of optimization regarding orientation workspace, the maximum 
of GTW occurs when Rm = 230 mm, l = 450 mm, as shown in Fig. 2.19b, and the 
value of GTW is 0.1845. Designers can choose one of these combinations for different 
applications.70 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …

2.3.3 Example 2: 2PUR-PRU PM 
• Structure description 
The CAD model of the 2PUR-PRU PM is shown in Fig. 2.20, which has been 
proven to be a 2R1T PM [24]. The moving platform is connected to a fixed base 
through three limbs. Two identical limbs are PUR limbs. The third limb is a PRU 
limb. The position and orientations of the moving platform can be determined by 
the combination of the three displacements of the P joints. For the two PUR limbs, 
the first rotational axes of the U joints are coincident with each other. The second 
rotational axes of the U joints are parallel to each other and the R joints connected to 
the mobile platform. For the PRU limb, the rotational axis of the R joint is parallel 
to the first rotational axis of the U joint. The second rotational axis connected to the 
moving platform is always parallel to the second rotational axes of the U joints of 
the first two limbs.2.3 Motion/Force Transmission Indices and Applications 71
Fig. 2.20 2PUR-PRU PM: a CAD model and b schematic representation 
We let A1 and A2 denote the centers of the U joints in limbs 1 and 2 and A3 denote 
the central point of the R joint in limb 3. The central points of the R joints in limbs 1 
and 2 are denoted B1 and B2, and the center of the U joints in limb 3 is denoted B3. 
Several coordinate frames are established as shown in Fig. 2.20a. A fixed reference 
frame O-xyz is attached to the fixed base. We let the x-axis always point in the direction 
of O A1 and the z-axis point downward vertically. A moving coordinate frame P￾uvw is attached to the moving platform (Fig. 2.20a). We let the u-axis point in the 
direction of P B1 and the v-axis point along P B3. The w-axis is directed downward 
vertically with respect to the moving platform. In addition, three local frames denoted 
Ai − xi yi zi (i = 1, 2, 3) are attached to limb i. For A1 − x1 y1z1 and A2 − x2 y2z2, 
the x-axis and y-axis always point along the rotational axes of the U joints of limbs 
1 and 2, respectively. For A3 − x3 y3z3, the directions of the axes of the coordinate 
frame are the same as those of O-xyz. The architectural parameters of the 2PUR-PRU 
PM are defined as P B1 = P B2 = l1, P B3 = l2, A1 B1 = A2 B2 = l3, A3 B3 = l4 
and Po,
=H. The coordinates of points A1, A2, and A3 with respect to the O-xyz are 
defined as (
q1 0 0 )T 
,
(
−q2 0 0 )T , and (
0 q3 0
)T , in which qi (i = 1, 2, 3) denotes 
the distance between the point O and the P joint of limb i. The coordinates of points 
B1, B2, and B3 are defined as (
xB1 yB1 zB1
)T 
,
(
xB2 yB2 zB2
)T , and (
xB3 yB3 zB3

respectively. Through adding an articulated RR serial head to the moving platform or 
integrating with two translational gantries, the 2PUR-PRU PM can achieve 5-DOF 
outputs and be used for five-face milling and large-scale workpiece machining, as 
shown in Fig. 2.21.
• Inverse kinematics 
Obtaining the inverse kinematics of the 2PUR-PRU PM is to find the actuated 
displacements (q1, q2, q3), given the orientations and position of the moving plat￾form (α, β, zo), where α, β, and zo denote the rotational angle around the x-axis and 
v-axis, and the distance between the points O and P, respectively.72 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …

where θi denotes the angle between limb i (i = 1, 2, 3) and the fixed base. The

• Local and global transmission performances 
Before evaluating the motion/force transmission performance of the 2PUR-PRU PM, 
it is necessary to obtain the TWSs and OTSs first. Without loss of generality, we take 
limb 1 as an example. The TWS should be linearly independent of passive twists 
and constraint wrenches simultaneously [26]. Since the actuated joint of limb 1 is a 
P joint, the TWS of limb 1 is reciprocal to the passive joints and is given by 
$T1 = (
xB1 − q1 yB1 zB1 ; 0 −q1zB1 q1 yB1
)
. (2.67) 
Similarly, the TWSs of the other two limbs can be derived as
{$T2 = (
q2 + xB2 yB2 zB2 ; 0 q2zB2 −q2 yB2
)
$T3 = (
0 yB3 − q3 zB3 ; q3zB3 0 0 ) . (2.68) 
When limb 1 is actuated and the other two limbs are locked, the new wrench 
system exerting on the moving platform can be written as 
U1 = [
$C1 $C2 $C3 $T2 $T3 ]
, (2.69)74 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …
where the constraint wrench screws (CWSs) of the 2PUR-PRU PM can be expressed

$C2 = (

$C3 = (
1 0 0; 0 zB3 + yB3 tanα 0
)
. (2.70) 
Accordingly, the instantaneous 1-DOF twist of the moving platform, which is 
denoted $O1, can be obtained using reciprocal screw theory as 
$O1 ◦ U1 = 0. (2.71) 
The other two output twist screws, $O2 and $O3, can be derived in the same way. 
The architectural parameters used here are set as l1 = l2 = 130 mm, l3 = l4 =
340 mm, zo = 260 mm, α ∈ [−20◦, 20◦], and β ∈ [−20◦, 20◦]. The LTI distribution 
of the 2PUR-PRU PM can thus be obtained by substituting the TWSs and OTSs into 
Eqs. (2.53)–(2.55), as shown in Fig. 2.22. With the length of the tool head H =20 mm, 
the LTI distribution in the three-dimensional workspace is shown in Fig. 2.22a to be 
symmetrical about the plane x = 0. The LTI distribution in the orientation workspace 
of the PM is completely symmetrical with respect to angle β, as shown in Fig. 2.22b. 
Here, the motion/force transmission performance of 2PUR-PRU PM in a config￾uration is regarded as good when the value of LTI is equal to or bigger than 0.5. 
According to the results in Fig. 2.22, the GTW of the 2PUR-PRU PM, σ, is approx￾imately 0.74, which means that the motion/force transmission capability with these 
architectural parameters is reasonably good. 
• Optimization of design parameters

In this study, optimization of the design parameters of the 2PUR-PRU PM is based 
on σ. The architectural parameters, rotation angles, and operating height are set as 
follows: l3 = l4, α ∈ [−20◦, 20◦], β ∈ [−20◦, 20◦], and zo = √2l3/2. Using the

Considering practical applications, the normalized parameters should satisfy
{

. (2.73) 
As shown in Fig. 2.23, the parameter design space [18] includes all possible points. 
The relationship between the parameters in three-dimensional space (r1, r2, r3) and 
those in plan space (s, t) is described as follows:

The design steps for performance optimization are as follows. 
Step 1: Identify the regions. The distributions of σ can be obtained as shown in 
Fig. 2.24. Here, region I—in which σ ∈ (0, 0.6)—is regarded as having poor global

motion/force transmission, region II—in which σ ∈ [0.6, 0.8)—is regarded as 
having medium global motion/force transmission, and region III—in which σ ≥
0.8—is regarded as having good global motion/force transmission. 
Step 2: Select three groups of data points randomly from each region; altogether, nine 
groups of data points are chosen in this study. For each group, the non-dimensional 
parameters r1, r2, and r3 can be obtained using Eq. (2.74). Using Eqs. (2.72) and 
(2.74), one can then obtain the design parameters l1, l2, and l3 and the two plan space 
parameters s and t, as listed in Table 2.3. 
Step 3: Determine the normalized factor D and dimensional parameters l1, l2, and l3. 
In view of the actual operating environment, the normalized factor D is determined 
as 400 mm. For example, the design parameters in group 1 are chosen as results,

i.e., r1 = 0.82, r2 = 0.50, and r3 = 1.68. The values of li can then be obtained using 
Eq. (2.72), i.e., l1 = 328 mm, l2 = 200 mm, and l3 = 672 mm. 
Step 4: Check whether the dimensional parameters obtained in Step 3 are suitable for 
actual applications. If the actual assembly conditions are satisfied, the procedure is 
finished; otherwise, return to Step 3, choose another group of data from the regions, 
and repeat Steps 3 and 4. Based on the dimensional parameters obtained from the 
previous step (i.e., l1 = 328 mm, l2 = 200 mm, and l3 = 672 mm), one can deduce 
that a manipulator with these parameters would be suitable for actual use and could 
work normally. 
Here, Fig. 2.25 shows comparisons of the motion/force transmissibility in regions 
I, II, and III, for which the design parameters in groups 3, 6, and 9 are chosen as 
examples. As shown in Fig. 2.25c, the value of σ in region III is 0.980, which is 
better than that in either of the other two examples. The results demonstrate that 
region III could be selected as the optimal region. Designers can choose one of these 
combinations for different applications.
2.3.4 Example 3: 2PUR-PSR PM 
• Structure description 
As shown in Fig. 2.26, the 2PUR-PSR PM [25] is composed of a moving platform, a 
fixed base, two PUR limbs with identical structures, and one PSR limb. For the two 
PUR limbs, the first rotational axes of the two U joints are coincident with each other, 
and also parallel to the movement direction of the P joints. The second rotational 
axes of the two U joints are perpendicular to the direction of the P joints and also 
parallel to each other and the R joints connected to the mobile platform. For the PSR 
limb, it is perpendicular to the rotational axis of the R joint.
Let A1 and A2 denote the centers of the U joints in limbs 1 and 2 and A3 denote 
the central point of the S joint in limb 3. The central points of the R joints in three 
limbs are denoted as B1, B2, and B3. 
The coordinate frames are established as shown in Fig. 2.26. A fixed reference 
frame O-xyz is attached to the fixed base. We let the x-axis always point in the 
direction of O A3, the y-axis point in the direction of O A1, and the z-axis point 
downward vertically. A moving coordinate frame o-uvw is attached to the moving 
platform. Let the u-axis point in the direction of oB3 and the v-axis point along oB1. 
The w-axis is directed downward vertically with respect to the moving platform. 
The architectural parameters of the 2PUR-PSR PM are defined as oB1 = oB2 = l1, 
oB3 = l2, A1 B1 = A2 B2 = l3, A3 B3 = l4, and l1 · l4 = l2 · l3.78 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …

c region III with l1 = 84 mm, l2 = 396 mm, l3 = 720 mm (group 9)
• Inverse kinematics 
The inverse kinematics of the 2PUR-PSR PM is to determine the displacement of 
the P joint in each limb, qi (i = 1, 2, 3), given the architectural parameters of the PM 
and the position vector of the end point o p = (
x y z )T 
. 
For the 2PUR-PSR PM, the orientation variation between the moving frame o-uvw 
and the fixed frame O-xyz can be written by a rotation matrix as2.3 Motion/Force Transmission Indices and Applications 79

where Rz(ϕ), Ry (θ), and Rx (ψ) denote the rotation matrices about the z-, y-, and 
x-axes, respectively. 
According to Fig. 2.26, the closed-loop kinematic equations of the 2PUR-PSR 
PM can be obtained as 
qi = p+bi − ai , (2.76) 
where qi denotes the displacement vector of the actuator in each limb. ai and bi =
Rbio denote the vectors from point Ai to Bi and point o to Bi , respectively, in which 
the vector bio is the displacement vector bi with respect to the moving coordinate

Due to the fact that the axis direction of the R joint of each limb is always 
perpendicular to qi − p during the motion, the relationship can be written as 
cT 
i
(

Therefore, Eq. (2.79) can be expanded as

xcθcϕ − (q1 − y)cθsϕ − zsθ = 0 
xcθcϕ + (q2 + y)cθsϕ − zsθ = 0 
y(cψcϕ + sψsθsϕ) + (q3 − x)(cψsϕ − sψsθcϕ) + zsψcθ = 0 
. (2.80) 
According to the above equation, it can be obtained as 
(q1 + q2)cθsϕ = 0. (2.81) 
Because q1 + q2 cannot be equal to zero during the motion, it can be deduced as 
cθsϕ = 0. (2.82) 
Combining with Eqs. (2.80) and (2.82), the relationship between the coordinates 
x and z can be obtained as 
xcθcϕ − zsθ = 0. (2.83) 
From Eq. (2.82), it can be inferred that sϕ = 0, from which the angle ϕ is equal 
to 0 or π. Based on the structural characteristics of the 2PUR-PSR PM, the angle ϕ
cannot be equal to π; that is, the angle ϕ is always equal to 0. Therefore, the third 
equation in Eq. (2.80) can be rewritten as 
ycψ − (q3 − x)sψsθ + zsψcθ = 0. (2.84) 
Combined Eqs. (2.83) and (2.84), the coordinates x and y in the position vector 
p = (
x y z )T can be expressed as
} x = z tan θ
y = (q3 − z tan θ)tanψsθ − z tan ψcθ . (2.85) 
Substituting Eq. (2.85) into Eq. (2.76), the analytical expressions of inverse 
kinematics of the 2PUR-PSR PM can be obtained. 
• Local and global transmission performances 
Using the same procedure as listed in the example of the 2PUR-PRU PM, the ITSs, 
TWSs, CWSs, and OTSs of the 2PUR-PSR PM also can be derived. For example, 
the TWSs and CWSs of the 2PUR-PSR PM can be obtained as2.3 Motion/Force Transmission Indices and Applications 81

. (2.87) 
Based on these results, the OTSs of the 2PUR-PSR PM can be calculated. Substi￾tuting these screws into Eqs. (2.53)–(2.55), the LTI of the 2PUR-PSR PM can be 
obtained. 
Taking the interference between the limbs of the 2PUR-PSR PM into account, 
the architectural parameters are set as follows: l1 = 200 mm, l2 = 200 mm, 
l3 = 400 mm, l4 = 400 mm, z = 250mm and the ranges of motion orientation 
are restricted as follows: ψ ∈ [−30◦, 30◦] and θ ∈ [−30◦, 30◦]. The LTI distribu￾tions of the 2PUR-PSR PM are shown in Fig. 2.27. It is clear that the distribution is 
symmetrical about the ψ = 0◦, which is consistent with the structure of the 2PUR￾PSR PM. Furthermore, Fig. 2.27 shows that the closer the configuration is to the 
initial situation, the better the motion/force transmission performance will be. 
Different from the example of the 2PUR-PRU PM, the region where Γ ≥ 0.7 
is defined as the GTW here. According to Fig. 2.27, the ratio of the region where
Γ ≥ 0.7 for the 2PUR-PSR PM is only 0.136, which means that the motion/force 
transmission capability with these link parameters is not good, and the optimization 
is necessary.

• Optimization of design parameters 
The GTW of the 2PUR-PSR PM is highly dependent on the design parameters l1, l2, 
l3, and l4. Considering the rotation angles and operating height limitations, the range 
of orientation capability is restricted as follows: ψ ∈ [−30◦, 30◦], θ ∈ [−30◦, 30◦], 
and z = 0.667 min[l3,l4]. The PFNM method proposed by Liu et al. [18] is used 
to optimize these parameters relative to the GTW. Here, l1, l2, and l3 are defined as 
design parameters and are normalized as

Considering practical application, the three normalized parameters should satisfy

The PDS of the 2PUR-PSR PM can be obtained through Eq. (2.88), as shown in 
Fig. 2.28. The shade area of the PDS represents the set of all possible points. Each 
possible point means that the 2PUR-PSR PM with these parameters has the region 
where Γ ≥ 0.7 in the reachable workspace. The relationship between the parameters 
in three-dimensional space (r1, r2, r3) and those in planar space (s, t) is given as

The steps for parameter optimization are as follows: 
Step 1: Identify the regions. According to the distribution shown in Fig. 2.29a, the 
whole region is divided into three design subregions for better understanding of opti￾mization, as shown in Fig. 2.29b. Region I where σ ∈ [ 0.1, 0.3) is regarded as 
having poor global motion/force transmission, which means that the design param￾eters in this region should be avoided to select for actual manufacturing. Region 
II—in which σ ∈ [0.3, 0.6)—is regarded as having medium global motion/force 
transmission, and region III—in which σ ≥ 0.6—is regarded as having good global 
motion/force transmission.2.3 Motion/Force Transmission Indices and Applications 83

regions I, II, and III 
Step 2: Determine the design parameters selected from the three design regions. Three 
groups of data points are selected randomly from each region; nine groups of data 
points are chosen here, as shown in Table 2.4. Considering the manufacturing error 
in actual machining, the parameter selection should be far away from the boundary 
of the optimized region. Using Eq. (2.90), the non-dimensional parameters r1, r2, 
and r3 can be obtained, as well as parameters s and t.
Step 3: Determine the normalized factor D and design parameters l1, l2, and l3. 
Considering the actual size of the PM, the D is determined as 300 mm. For example, 
the design parameters in group 7 are chosen as results, i.e., r1 = 0.06, r2 = 0.76, 
and r3 = 2.18. The values of dimensional parameters can then be obtained using 
Eq. (2.88), i.e., l1 = 18 mm, l2 = 228 mm, and l3 = 654 mm. In the same way, nine 
groups of data points can be obtained, as listed in Table 2.4. 
Step 4: Check whether the dimensional parameters obtained in Step 2 are suitable or 
not for actual usage conditions. If the actual assembly conditions are satisfied, the 
procedure is finished; otherwise, return to Step 2 to choose another group of data 
from the regions.84 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …

In order to show the comparisons of the GTW in regions I, II, and III, the design 
parameters in groups 3, 6, and 9 are chosen as examples, and the corresponding 
atlases about the motion/force transmissibility are shown in Fig. 2.30. Compared 
with the other two examples, the value of σ is 0.669, which means that the overall 
LTI distribution based on the design parameters in group 9 is better. The results 
demonstrate that region III could be selected as the optimal region. Designers can 
choose one of these combinations for different applications.
2.4 Motion/Force Constraint Indices and Applications 
2.4.1 Motion/Force Constraint Indices 
Unlike the motion/force transmissibility that describes the efficiency of energy trans￾mission, the motion/force constrainability reflects the capability of PMs to resist 
external loads [27], which is of great significance to the application of PMs in the 
field requiring high rigidity and precision. There are some works examining the 
constrainability of PMs [27–33]. Han et al. [29] observed the constraint singularity 
from experiments on a 3-UPU design, because an unexpected DOF occurred when the 
actuated joints were locked. Then, according to the variation of constraint wrenches 
in space, Zlatanov et al. [30] proposed the concept of constraint singularity to stress 
the importance of constrainability. Recently, based on screw theory, Liu and his 
colleagues [27] proposed three motion/force constraint indices of PMs to evaluate 
the constrainability of lower-mobility PMs and presented an approach for constraint 
singularity analysis. Meng et al. [28] concentrated on redundantly actuated and over￾constrained PMs with closed-loop subchains. Due to the particularity of redundantly 
actuated and overconstrained PMs with closed-loop subchains, they addressed a 
local interaction index with the analysis of motion/force interaction performance 
that considered the TWSs and CWSs together.2.4 Motion/Force Constraint Indices and Applications 85
Fig. 2.30 Comparisons of motion/force transmissibility: a region I, b region II, and c region III
The above-mentioned research on constraint performance is mainly aimed at 
PMs without redundancy actuation and over constraints and rarely involves over￾constrained PMs without/with actuation redundancy. This chapter mainly studies 
the motion/force constraint performance of overconstrained PMs without actuation 
redundancy, and the research on the motion/force constraint performance of redun￾dantly actuated and overconstrained PMs will be presented in Chap. 4. For the over￾constrained PMs without actuation redundancy, they have one obvious feature: the 
number of constraint wrenches is greater than the limited DOFs. Based on this factor, 
it can be found that the analysis of the output constraint index (OCI) [27] is complex 
because the relationship between the output virtual twist and the constraint wrench 
is not one-to-one, which complicates the analysis of constrainability. To solve this 
problem, a new evaluation approach and corresponding constraint indices using the 
screw theory [13] and power coefficients [11] are proposed.

Without loss of generality, a general m-DOF overconstrained PM without actua￾tion redundancy is shown in Fig. 2.31, which is composed of a fixed base, a moving 
platform, and m limbs. Each limb is assumed with only one actuated joint here. 
Suppose the DOF of the jth limb is q j , so that the limb twist system, UP j , can be 
written in the form of q j-order 
UP j = [
$j1 $j2 ··· $jq j
]
, (2.92)
where $ji represents the ith unit kinematic joint twist of the jth limb. Using screw 
theory [13], the corresponding jth limb constraint system, UC j , can be expressed as 
UC j =

where $C jk denotes the kth unit CWS of the jth limb. $C jk and $ji are reciprocal to

= 1, 2, …, m), as shown in Fig. 2.31. Therefore, the constraint wrench system UC 
and transmission wrench system UT of an overconstrained PM without actuation 
redundancy can be expressed as2.4 Motion/Force Constraint Indices and Applications 87

• Local constraint performance index 
For an m-DOF overconstrained PM without actuation redundancy in a certain nonsin￾gular configuration, as shown in Fig. 2.31, it keeps balanced with (m + g) wrenches, 
which includes m TWSs and g (g >6 − m) CWSs. Among these (m + g) wrenches, 
there are six independent wrenches, and others are linearly dependent on these six 
wrenches. For the overconstrained PMs without actuation redundancy, the influences 
of these (m + g − 6) linearly dependent wrenches on the motion/force constrain￾ability should be considered. The initial method used for the constraint evaluation 
is mainly focused on the non-redundant actuated PMs without over constraints [27, 
28]. However, they did not consider the comprehensive influence of the (m + g − 6) 
linearly dependent wrenches. 
Inspired by the above work, a new method for the constraint performance evalu￾ation of non-redundant actuated PMs with over constraints is presented here, which 
takes the effects of (m + g − 6) linearly dependent wrenches into account reasonably. 
First, by locking all the TWSs, they are converted into m new CWSs, and then the 
non-redundant actuated PM with over constraints becomes a statically indeterminate 
structure with (m + g) CWSs. Then, through locking m TWSs and (5 − m) linearly 
independent CWSs and “losing” (m + g − 5) CWSs, the non-redundant actuated 
PM with over constraints effectively becomes an instantaneous 1-DOF mechanism. 
The unique instantaneous motion of the moving platform is defined as virtual OTS 
[27]. Considering the force characteristics of PMs, at least k (k ≥ 1) of the “lost” (m88 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …
+ g − 5) CWSs are linearly independent with the five locked wrenches, which can 
be used to prevent the virtual instantaneous motion. Next, through ergodic analysis, 
there are at most Cm+g−5 
g cases need to be considered. Here, the instantaneous power 
between the k linearly independent constraint wrenches in the (m + g − 5) CWSs 
and the unique instantaneous twist is defined as the output constraint performance 
of the 1-DOF mechanism. For different k, the calculation method is not the same, 
which will be discussed later in detail. Averaging the values of the output constraint 
indices of these 1-DOF mechanisms gives the overall output constraint performance 
of the non-redundant actuated PM with over constraints. Finally, the total constraint 
performance is calculated by considering both the input and output constraint perfor￾mances. The purpose of this method is to describe the motion/force constrainability 
of the non-redundant actuated PM with over constraints by evaluating the constraint 
performance of several 1-DOF mechanisms with multiple wrenches. A procedure 
for evaluating a general m-DOF overconstrained PM without actuation redundancy 
is presented in Fig. 2.32, which is described as follows.
Step 1: Determine the transmission wrench system UT and constraint wrench system 
UC of the non-redundant actuated PM with over constraints firstly, and then lock all 
the TWSs. The new constraint wrench system U with (m + g) wrenches can be 
expressed as 
U = [UT, UC] = [
$T1 $T2 ··· $Tm $C1 $C2 ··· $Cg
] (2.96) 
Step 2: Randomly choose (5 − m) linearly independent CWSs and m TWSs to be 
locked, and “lose” other (m + g − 5) CWSs. In different “lost” cases, the linear 
independent numbers and characteristics in the “lost” CWSs are different, which 
is numbered as the ith case. The platform wrench system Ui of the non-redundant 
actuated PM with over constraints can be updated as 
Ui = [Ui 
T, Ui 
C] = [
$T1 $T2 ··· $T f $C1 $C2 ··· $C f ,
]
f + f , = 5, (2.97) 
where the Ui is composed of f locked TWSs ($T f ) and f , CWSs ($C f ,), and the 
dimension is equal to 5. 
In this case, the non-redundant actuated PM with over constraints becomes a 1-
DOF mechanism with a 5-order wrench system Ui 
. At this time, only some wrenches 
in the “lost” CWSs can do work on the moving platform of the PM, while the locked 
TWSs and other CWSs cannot do work on the moving platform. Therefore, the 
instantaneous unit motion of the moving platform, virtual OTS $Oi , can be obtained 
by the reciprocal condition in screw theory as 
$Oi ◦ Ui = 0. (2.98)2.4 Motion/Force Constraint Indices and Applications 89

Additionally, the “lost” (m + g − 5) CWSs are named as $Wck (k = 1, 2, …, m +
g − 5) for convenience, and they are classified as Ui,
, where 
Ui,
= [
$Wc1 $Wc2 ··· $Wc(m+g−5)
]
. (2.99) 
However, only k CWSs in the “lost” (m + g − 5) ones, which are linearly inde￾pendent of the 5 locked wrenches, can counterbalance the external loads along the 
axis of $Oi . The number k will determine whether the relationship between the $Oi 
and the applied wrenches is one-to-one or one-to-multiple. It results in the difficulty 
of calculating the OCI. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the values of k and 
divide them into two cases to obtain the OCI comprehensively. 
Case 1: If k = 1, only one wrench remains after eliminating the linear correlation. It 
means that only one CWS of the “lost” (m + g − 5) CWSs is linearly independent 
of the locked 5 wrenches. In this case, the output constraint performance index of 
the 1-DOF mechanism between the ith “lost” wrench $Wci and the virtual output 
twist $Oi is defined. It is the same as that presented in Liu’s work [27], which can be 
written as 
ζOi =
|
|$Wci ◦ $Oi
|
|
|
|$Wci ◦ $Oi
|
|

, (2.100) 
where |
|$Wci ◦ $Oi
|
| and |
|$Wci ◦ $Oi
|
|
max denote the instantaneous and maximum power 
coefficients, respectively. 
Case 2: If k ≥ 2, k CWSs remain after eliminating the linear correlation. It means 
that in the “lost” (m + g − 5) CWSs, the number of CWSs that are linearly inde￾pendent of the locked 5 wrenches is k. In this case, how to evaluate the constraint 
performance of a 1-DOF mechanism with multiple wrenches is a key issue. Obvi￾ously, it is impossible that the effects between these wrenches and the virtual output 
twist of 1-DOF mechanism can reach their maximum simultaneously. Thus, the 
output constraint performance index that reflects the power coefficient between the 
ith “lost” wrenches and the virtual output twist of the 1-DOF mechanism can be 
written by using a compound formula as 
ζOi = min{

|$Wc1 ◦ $O1

max 
}. (2.101) 
In Eq. (2.101), the output constraint performance of a 1-DOF mechanism in this 
case is defined as the combined effect of k CWSs. It should be noted that if any 
of |$Wc1◦$Ok |+|$Wc2◦$Ok |+···+|$Wck◦$Ok |
|$Wc1◦$Ok |+|$Wc2◦$Ok |+···+|$Wck◦$Ok |max 
is equal to zero, the wrenches cannot counter￾balance the external loads along the axis of $Oi , which means that the constraint2.4 Motion/Force Constraint Indices and Applications 91
singularity occurs in this configuration. In other words, if the minimum of them is 
larger than zero, there is no constraint singularity. Thus, ζOi is defined as the minimum 
of all the situations here. 
Step 3: Considering the above two cases, together with the reality that the number of 
selections of the locked 5 linearly independent wrenches (N) must be smaller than 
Cm+g−5 
g , N < Cm+g−5 
g times must be studied. It can be imagined that when all the 
cases are considered in a scenario where the locked wrenches are transformed one 
by one, the output constraint coefficient of the non-redundant actuated PM with over 
constraints will always be limited between the maximum and the minimum of those 
results. Thus, the OCI of a PM can be defined as 
ζ= 1 
N 
Σ
N
i=1 
ζOi , (2.102) 
where the range of ζ is from zero to unity. 
At the same time, the input constraint index (ICI) of each limb [34] is determined 
by 
η j 
I = min 
i 
{ηi} = min 
i

|$Ci ◦ $Tri

i = 1, 2,..., f, (2.103) 
where η j 
I is the input constraint performance of the jth limb. Inspired by Liu’s work 
[27], a virtual joint is employed to further understand the meaning of the constraint 
index, where the virtual joint corresponds to an input restricted twist screw. When 
the index ηi is equal to unity, the ith constraint wrench exerts in the direction of the 
input restricted twist screw of the ith virtual joint, which means that the ith virtual 
joint is constrained greatly. Besides, when the index, ηi , is equal to zero, it can be 
said that the ith virtual joint cannot be constrained by the ith constraint wrench. In 
other words, the virtual joint becomes active. 
Thus, the ICI of the non-redundant actuated PM with over constraints in a certain 
configuration can be written as 
η = min

j = 1, 2,..., m , (2.104) 
where the range of η is from zero to unity. 
Step 4: On account of the influences of the input and output constraint performance 
on the whole constrainability, the total constraint index (TCoI) of a non-redundant 
actuated PM with over constraints in a certain configuration can be defined in the 
form as 
κ = /
η ∗ ζ. (2.105)92 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …
A larger value of κ means a better motion/force constrainability of a non-redundant 
actuated PM with over constraints, which refers to the better effectiveness of internal 
constraint wrenches resisting external wrenches. Only when both the input and output 
constraint performances are good will the PM has better motion/force constrain￾ability. In contrast, if one of them is close to zero, the TCoI will also be close to zero. 
For example, if the ICI and OCI in a certain configuration are 0.01 and 1, respectively, 
then the TCoI can be obtained as 0.1, which means the constraint performance of 
the non-redundant actuated PM with over constraints in this configuration is poor. 
As a result, the PM has poor motion/force constrainability as long as one of the ICI 
and OCI is bad. In addition, it can be found that the ICI, OCI, and TCoI based on 
the power coefficient are coordinate-free indices, which avoids the inconsistency of 
the units of the elements in the Jacobian matrix [14]. 
• Global constraint performance index 
The local constraint performance index proposed above is used to evaluate the 
motion/force constraint performance of an overconstrained PM without actuation 
redundancy under a certain configuration, rather than the entire workspace of PMs. 
For the design of overconstrained PMs without redundancy actuation, it is not enough 
to rely on the local performance index, and the global constraint performance index 
is also needed as a reference. Here, the motion/force constraint performance of PMs 
in a configuration is regarded as good when the value of κ is equal to or bigger than 
the given value, and these regions are referred to as the good constraint workspace 
(GCoW). The index can thus measure the global motion/force constrainability of a 
PM and is defined as 
σGCoW =
{
SGCoW dW
{
S dW , (2.106) 
where W is the reachable orientation workspace and SGCoW and S denote the areas of 
the GCoW and overall reachable workspace, respectively. Apparently, σGCoW ranges 
from zero to unity. The PM has better constraint performance when the σGCoW is 
closer to unity. 
It should be noted again that our study is totally different from the work of Liu 
et al. [27]. The constraint performance indices proposed by Liu et al. are mainly 
used for the non-redundant actuated PMs without over constraints, such as the 6PSS 
PM that is analyzed in Sect. 2.2.2, which is a PM without over constraints and 
actuation redundancy. In the following sections, the motion/force constraint indices 
based on the screw theory will be used to evaluate and optimize the performance of 
two overconstrained PMs without actuation redundancy, namely the 2PUR-PRU PM 
[24], and the 2PUR-PSR PM [25], and the effectiveness of the proposed constraint 
index will be verified.2.4 Motion/Force Constraint Indices and Applications 93
2.4.2 Example 1: 2PUR-PRU PM 
• Local and global constraint performance 
Before evaluating the motion/force constraint performance of the 2PUR-PRU PM, it 
is necessary to obtain the TWSs and CWSs of limbs first. The TWSs of limbs have 
been listed in Eqs. (2.67) and (2.68). For the CWSs of each limb in the 2PUR-PRU 
PM, they can be derived by using the reciprocal screw theory, which can be expressed 
as
{$C1 = (
000; 0 sα cα
)
$C2 = (
0 cα −sα; 0 q1sα q1cα
) (2.107)
{$C3 = (
000; 0 sα cα
)
$C4 = (
0 cα −sα; 0 −q2sα −q2cα
) (2.108) 
and
{$C5 = (
000; 0 sα cα
)
$C6 = (
1 0 0; 0 zB3 + yB3 tanα 0
) . (2.109) 
Based on these results, the OTSs of the 2PUR-PRU PM in different cases can 
be calculated. Substituting these screws into Eqs. (2.100)–(2.105), the TCoI of the 
2PUR-PRU PM can be obtained. Taking the interference between the limbs of the 
2PUR-PRU PM into account, the architectural parameters are set as follows: l1 = l2 
= 130 mm, l3 = l4 = 340 mm, zo = 260 mm, α ∈ [−20◦, 20◦], and β ∈ [−20◦, 20◦]. 
The TCoI distribution of the 2PUR-PRU PM is shown in Fig. 2.33. It is clear that the 
distribution is symmetrical about the β = 0◦, which is consistent with the structure 
of the 2PUR-PRU PM.
Based on the global index defined in Eq. (2.106), the global constraint performance 
of the 2PUR-PRU PM can be derived. Here, the motion/force constraint performance 
of the 2PUR-PRU PM in a configuration is regarded as good when the value of 
TCoI is equal to or bigger than 0.7. According to the distributions in Fig. 2.33, it 
can be obtained that the ratio of the region where κ ≥ 0.7 for the 2PUR-PRU PM is 
approximately equal to unity, which means that the motion/force constraint capability 
with these architectural parameters is good. 
• Optimization of design parameters 
Although the motion/force constraint performance of the 2PUR-PRU PM in the 
workspace is great, the optimization of the design parameters of the 2PUR-PRU PM 
based on σGCoW is also needed for more different choices of design parameters. The 
PFNM method also can be used here, and the optimization process is similar to that of 
the motion/force transmission performances of the 2PUR-PRU PM. The distribution 
of σGCoW in the PDS is shown in Fig. 2.34, from which one can find that global94 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …

performance in the most region of the available area is equal to unity, which means 
that the designers can choose many combinations in the parameter design space for 
different applications. For example, the designers can choose the combination with 
s = 2.00 and t = 0.25. By substituting s and t into Eq. (2.74), the non-dimensional 
parameters can be obtained as r1 = 0.72, r2 = 0.28, and r3 = 2.00. Considering the 
actual operation environment, the normalized factor D is determined as 400 mm, 
and the values of li can then be obtained using Eq. (2.72), i.e., l1 = 288 mm, l2 =
112 mm, and l3 = 800 mm. The distribution of TCoI with the above parameters 
is shown in Fig. 2.35, from which one can find that the 2PUR-PRU PM has good 
constraint performance by using these parameters, and the value of σGCoW is equal to 
1. Designers can choose different combinations of design parameters for the actual 
applications.
2.4.3 Example 2: 2PUR-PSR PM 
• Local and global constraint performance 
Using the same procedure as listed in the example of the 2PUR-PRU PM, the CWSs, 
and OTSs of the 2PUR-PSR PM also can be derived. For example, the CWSs of each 
limb in the 2PUR-PSR PM can be obtained as
{$C1 = (
000; sθ 0 cθ
)
$C2 = (
−cθ 0 sθ; q1sθ 0 q1cθ
) (2.110)2.4 Motion/Force Constraint Indices and Applications 95

and 
$C5 = (

. (2.112) 
Based on these results, the OTSs of the 2PUR-PSR PM in different cases can 
be calculated. Substituting these screws into Eqs. (2.100)–(2.105), the TCoI of the96 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …
Fig. 2.36 TCoI distribution 
of the 2PUR-PSR PM with 
original parameters 
2PUR-PSR PM can be obtained. Taking the interference between the limbs of the 
2PUR-PSR PM into account, the architectural parameters are set as follows: l1 =
200 mm, l2 = 200 mm, l3 = 400 mm, l4 = 400 mm, z = 250 mm and the ranges of 
motion orientation are restricted as follows: ψ ∈ [−30◦, 30◦] and θ ∈ [−30◦, 30◦]. 
The TCoI distribution of the 2PUR-PSR PM is shown in Fig. 2.36. It is clear that the 
distribution is symmetrical about the ψ = 0◦, which is consistent with the structure 
of the 2PUR-PSR PM. 
Based on the global index defined in Eq. (2.106), the global constraint performance 
of the 2PUR-PSR PM can be derived. According to the distributions in Fig. 2.36, it 
can be obtained that the ratio of the region where κ ≥ 0.7 for the 2PUR-PSR PM is 
approximately equal to 0.87, which means that the motion/force constraint capability 
with these architectural parameters is reasonably good. 
• Optimization of design parameters 
Based on the motion/force constraint performance, the optimization of the design 
parameters of the 2PUR-PSR PM based on σGCoW also can be presented. The PFNM 
method also can be used here, and the optimization process is the same as that of 
the motion/force transmission performances of the 2PUR-PSR PM. The distribution 
of σGCoW in the PDS is shown in Fig. 2.37, from which one can find that global 
performance in the most region of the available area is good, which means that the 
designers can choose many combinations in the parameter design space for different 
applications. For example, the designers can choose the combination with s = 2.50 
and t = 0.05. By substituting s and t into Eq. (2.90), the non-dimensional parameters 
can be obtained as r1 = 0.29, r2 = 0.21, and r3 = 2.50. Considering the actual 
operation environment, the normalized factor D is determined as 300 mm, and the 
values of li can then be obtained using Eq. (2.88), i.e., l1 = 87 mm, l2 = 63 mm, 
and l3 = 750 mm. The distribution of TCoI with the above parameters is shown2.5 Summary 97

performance (σGCoW = 1) by using these parameters. 
2.5 Summary 
This chapter presents the kinematic performance analysis and optimization of PMs 
without actuation redundancy. Three different kinematic indices, including the condi￾tion number index, motion/force transmission index, and motion/force constraint98 2 Kinematic Performance Analysis and Optimization of Parallel …
index, are used here. In these indices, the condition number and motion/force trans￾mission indices are common and traditional indices, and the motion/force constraint 
indices are the new indices proposed in this chapter. In the proposed indices, 
by locking all m TWSs and (5 − m) linearly independent CWSs and “losing” (m 
+ g − 5) CWSs, the non-redundant actuated PM with over constraints effectively 
becomes an instantaneous 1-DOF mechanism. The output constraint performance of 
these 1-DOF mechanisms is the instantaneous power of all the linearly independent 
wrenches in the (m + g − 5) wrenches that are devoted to motion. Different calcu￾lation processes are used for different numbers k of linearly independent wrenches. 
After that, the output motion/force constrainability of a PM can be described with 
the mean value of instantaneous power of these 1-DOF mechanisms. Based on the 
proposed OCI and TCoI, the global index, GCoW, is established. Based on the anal￾ysis and dimension optimizations of PMs, it can be found that these types of indices 
can be effectively used for the kinematic performance evaluation and optimization 
and also provide important references for the actual applications of PMs.

Motion/Force Transmission Performance 
Analysis and Optimization of Parallel 
Manipulators with Actuation 
Redundancy 
Over the last few decades, PMs with actuation redundancy have attracted increasing 
attention in both academia and industry [1–7]. When compared with PMs with 
non-redundant actuation, PMs with actuation redundancy offer several advantages, 
including the elimination of singularities and improved stiffness and dexterity [6–10]. 
There are two categories of PMs with actuation redundancy [6, 7]: the replacement 
of passive joints with active joints and the addition of active limbs to the PM without 
changing its mobility. Many studies have focused on the latter category because it 
offers the advantages of higher stiffness and improved force distribution. This chapter 
also focuses on the latter type of redundantly actuated PM. 
Performance evaluation and optimal design are essential for PMs with actuation 
redundancy. Considering the inconsistencies of Jacobian-based indices when applied 
to PMs with mixed-DOF [11], the motion/force transmission index that can quan￾tify the transmissibility between the actuators and the moving platform is used in 
this chapter. A local minimized transmission index (LMTI) [12–15] for transmission 
evaluation of redundantly actuated PMs has been proposed that separated the redun￾dantly actuated PM into a set of non-redundant PMs by removing the redundant limbs 
from the redundantly actuated PM in turn. Despite the coordinate independence of 
this index, the influences of the redundant actuator and limb are not considered. In 
this chapter, a new index proposed by the authors will be used for the performance 
evaluation and dimensional optimization of redundantly actuated PMs [16]. First, by 
locking some actuators in an ergodic manner, the targeted redundantly actuated PM is 
separated into several subsidiary 1-DOF PMs that are actuated by two or more actua￾tors. Then, the index of output transmission performance is proposed by calculating 
the mean value of the instantaneous power produced by these 1-DOF PMs. Finally, 
the LTI is defined as the minimum value of the index of output and input transmis￾sion performance. The LTI is coordinate-free and dimensionless. Compared with 
other indices, this one considers the influences of redundant actuators and limbs and 
describes the intrinsic characteristics of a redundantly actuated PM more precisely.

In this chapter, the motion/force transmission performance analysis and optimiza￾tion of PMs with actuation redundancy will be presented. Three PMs are taken as 
examples here for analysis and discussion. 
3.1 Motion/Force Transmission Indices of Parallel 
Manipulators with Actuation Redundancy 
Indices for the evaluation of the transmissibility of the redundantly actuated PMs 
should be coordinate-free and have a clear physical interpretation. Since this type 
of PM has interference from different actuators, the one-to-one corresponding trans￾mission between the input actuation twist and output twist of the moving platform 
disappears. In the following, an evaluation approach and a transmission index are 
proposed to solve this problem [16]. 
• Motion/force transmission of a 1-DOF four-bar mechanism with two actua￾tors 
A 1-DOF planar four-bar linkage mechanism is taken as an example first to illustrate 
the proposed index, as shown in Fig. 3.1. The mechanism has 1-DOF and is redun￾dantly actuated by two motors fixed on the base. Let the two actuation wrenches be 
denoted as $T1 and $T2. Let the motion of the output link be represented by a twist 
$O. 
The redundantly actuated mechanism can be regarded as a mechanism consisting 
of two limbs, a moving platform, and a fixed base. The limb twist systems of the 
mechanism are written as

which indicates the moving platform has an instantaneous rotation around an axis 
pointing along the paper outward. 
The output motion/force transmissibility of the four-bar linkage mechanism can 
be described by the instantaneous power coefficient that $T1 and $T2 act on $O, i.e., 
η =

, (3.5) 
where $T1, $T2, and $O are normalized. 
Assume that the planar four-bar linkage mechanism is completely rigid and 
perfectly manufactured. When a perfect motion/force transmission occurs, the value 
of η should be 1, that is, energy is transmitted from the actuators to the moving plat￾form without loss. However, even in such an idealized situation, the actual value of 
η is always less than 1 due to internal forces caused by redundant actuation. Hence, 
η can be used as an index for performance analysis and optimal design for the planar 
four-bar linkage mechanism. 
The planar four-bar linkage mechanism is a 1-DOF single-loop mechanism while 
a PM is a multi-DOF mechanism with n loops, n being an integer. Thus, we can104 3 Motion/Force Transmission Performance Analysis and Optimization …
separate a redundantly actuated PM with an n-loop into several 1-DOF mechanisms. 
Evaluating motion/force transmission of the redundantly actuated PM is then reduced 
to evaluating motion/force transmission of these subsidiary 1-DOF mechanisms. This 
section provides an explicit approach to generating the 1-DOF mechanisms. It is 
worth mentioning that this idea is inspired by Liu’s work [17] in which he separated 
an n-DOF non-redundantly actuated PM into n 1-DOF non-redundantly actuated 
PMs to calculate the local motion/force transmission. 
• Local transmission index for redundantly actuated PMs 
In a non-singular configuration, a six-order wrench system is exerted on the moving 
platform of a PM after all actuators are locked. The six-order wrench system can 
be divided into two parts: the m-order transmission wrench system providing the 
actuation force and the 6-m order constraint wrench system restraining its motion. 
Although the elements in a single system may be linearly dependent in the redundant 
actuation case or over constrained case, those from different systems are linearly 
independent of each other [18]. In addition, any selected m-1 transmission wrenches 
are linearly independent of each other in the transmission wrench system. This section 
focuses on the redundantly actuated PMs that work in non-singular configurations. 
When a PM works in a singular configuration, the linear dependency varies from 
case to case and should be discussed specifically. 
When the actuators installed in any m − 1 limbs are locked, the corresponding 
transmission wrenches that form a (m − 1)-order system turn into extra constraint 
wrenches of the moving platform. Thus, the moving platform is subjected to (6 −
m + m − 1 = 5) independent constraint wrenches. In other words, there is only an 
instantaneous 1-DOF twist that is redundantly actuated by the other n − m + 1 limbs. 
For the redundantly actuated PM with n limbs, there are N = Cm−1 n combinations 
of selection of the locked m − 1 limbs. Let g denote a combination case. The overall 
constraint wrenches exerted on the moving platform after locking m-1 actuators 
consist of two parts

The instantaneous 1-DOF twist of the mobile platform is denoted as $Og, which 
is obtained by using reciprocity between twists and wrenches3.1 Motion/Force Transmission Indices of Parallel Manipulators … 105
$Og ◦ Ug = 0. (3.7) 
Since only the transmission wrenches of the active limb do work in the direction 
of the output twist and the locked limbs contribute no active transmission wrenches 
to it, the output transmission performance index of the ith limb reflecting the power 
coefficient between the ith transmission wrench and the output twist can be written 
as

The output transmission performance of the moving platform is the coupled effect 
of the n − m + 1 active limbs. Due to the redundantly actuated limb(s), the poor 
output transmission coefficient of an active limb may be compensated by the high 
output transmission coefficient of other active limbs. 
Since the locked limbs are randomly selected from n limbs, we have to study 
N = Cm−1 n cases. One can imagine that when the locked limbs are released one 
by one until all the actuators are activated, the output transmission coefficient of 
the PM will neither exceed the maximum nor the minimum of those of the 1-DOF 
mechanisms. Thus, the output transmission performance of the redundantly actuated 
PM is given by 
η = 1

On the other hand, the input transmission performance of each limb is evaluated

max 
(i= 1, 2,..., n), λ = min{λ1,λ2,...,λn}, (3.10) 
where $Ai denotes the twist of the actuated joint of the ith limb and λ the input 
transmission performance. 
Since the motion/force transmission takes both the input and output transmission 
performance into consideration, the LTI for a redundantly actuated PM is defined as
Γ = min{λ, η} (3.11) 
A flowchart that describes the procedure for calculating this LTI is presented in 
Fig. 3.2. It should be noted that some kinematic performance indices, such as manip￾ulability [19, 20] and dexterity [21], are to measure the sensitivity of the response of106 3 Motion/Force Transmission Performance Analysis and Optimization …
the end effector to the actuators and have to be used very carefully when concerning 
PMs with both rotational and translational DOFs due to the inconsistency of the units 
of the elements in a Jacobian matrix. Otherwise, erroneous interpretations may be 
obtained [11]. To overcome this, some researchers also proposed an LTI-based eval￾uation method [17, 22]. In this method, a redundantly actuated PM was converted 
into a group of non-redundantly actuated PMs with equal kinematic constraints, and 
the LTI of the target PM was regarded to be the maximum value of the LTI of all 
the non-redundantly actuated PMs. However, the effect generated by internal forces 
caused by redundant actuations is not considered during this conversion.
• Global transmission index for redundantly actuated PMs 
Since the proposed LTI represents the motion/force transmission performance in 
a single configuration, it cannot be used to evaluate the global transmission perfor￾mance of the manipulator. It is therefore necessary to define an index that can describe 
the manipulator’s performance in a set of poses. Here, the motion/force transmission 
performance of PMs in a configuration is regarded as good when the value of Γ is 
equal to or bigger than the given value, and these regions are referred to as the good 
transmission workspace (GTW). The index can thus measure the global motion/force 
transmissibility of a PM and is defined as 
σ =
{
SG dW
{
S dW , (3.12) 
where W is the reachable orientation workspace and SG and S denote the areas of 
the GTW and overall reachable workspace, respectively. Here, the overall reachable 
workspace is defined as the curved surface at an operating height with given rotational 
ranges. Apparently, σ ranges from zero to unity. The PM has better transmission 
performance when the σ is closer to unity. 
In the following sections, the motion/force transmission indices based on the 
screw theory will be used to evaluate and optimize the kinematic performance of 
three PMs, namely the 6PSS-UPS PM, the 2UPR-2PRU PM [23], and the 2PUR￾2PRU PM [24], and the effectiveness of the proposed transmission index will be 
verified. 
3.2 Example 1: 6PSS-UPS PM 
• Local and global transmission performances 
For the 6PSS-UPS PM, as shown in the CAD model in Fig. 3.3, which is similar to 
the structure of the 6PSS PM in Chap. 2. The main difference between these two PMs 
is the seventh redundant actuated limb UPS, which connects to the origin point of 
the moving coordinate frame by using the S joint and connects to the origin point of 
the fixed coordinate frame by using the U joint. Therefore, the structure description3.2 Example 1: 6PSS-UPS PM 107

evaluating a general 
redundantly actuated PM
and inverse kinematics of the 6PSS-UPS are similar to the 6PSS, and they are omitted 
here.
Before evaluating the motion/force transmission performance of the 6PSS-UPS 
PM, it is necessary to obtain the TWSs and OTSs first, and then calculate the LTI of 
this PM. The procedure is described as follows: 
Step 1: Determine the TWS in each limb of the 6PSS-UPS PM. Without loss of 
generality, limb 1 is used as an example. The TWS should be linearly independent of 
passive twists and constraint wrenches simultaneously [25]. Since the actuated joint108 3 Motion/Force Transmission Performance Analysis and Optimization …

of limb 1 is a P joint, the TWS of limb 1 is reciprocal of the passive joints and is 
given by 
$T1 = (
l1
/
|l1| a1 × l1
/
|l1|
)
. (3.13) 
Similarly, the TWSs of the other six limbs can be derived as

$T7 = (

)
. (3.14) 
Step 2: List the locked/active TWSs and form a new wrench system for the 6PSS￾UPS PM, from which the OTS is then obtained. For the 6PSS-UPS PM, it is a 6-DOF 
redundantly actuated PM with seven limbs. When actuators that are installed in five 
arbitrarily chosen limbs are locked, the corresponding TWSs form a five-order system 
and turn into extra constraint wrenches for the moving platform, and it sustains five 
independent constraint wrenches in total. Using the screw theory, it can be shown 
that there is only one instantaneous 1-DOF twist that is actuated redundantly by two 
limbs. For the 6PSS-UPS PM, there are N = C2 
7 = 21 combinations that can be used 
to select the two locked limbs. The corresponding locked/active limb combinations 
are listed in Table 3.1.
The PM of case 1 is selected as an example here. As listed in Table 3.1, the new 
wrench system acting on the moving platform after locking two actuators can be 
written as 
U1 = [
$T3 $T4 $T5 $T6 $T7
}
. (3.15) 
Accordingly, the instantaneous 1-DOF twist of the moving platform, which is 
denoted by $O1, can be obtained using reciprocal screw theory3.2 Example 1: 6PSS-UPS PM 109

There are 21 cases for the 6PSS-UPS PM. If these cases have been completed, 
proceed to Step 3; otherwise, return to the start of Step 2 and select the next case.110 3 Motion/Force Transmission Performance Analysis and Optimization …
Step 3: Calculate the OTI and ITI. Because only the transmission wrenches of the 
active limbs contribute in the output twist direction, the output transmission perfor￾mance of case 1, which reflects the power coefficient between the active transmission 
wrenches and the output twist, can be written as 
η1 =

. (3.17) 
In each case, the output transmissibility of the 1-DOF mechanism is the coupled 
effect of the two active limbs. In a redundantly actuated PM, the output transmission 
performance will not exceed either the maximum or minimum performance values of 
the 1-DOF mechanisms. Thus, when considering all cases, the OTI of the 6PSS-UPS 
redundantly actuated PM in this study is defined as 
η = 1 
21 
Σ
21
g=1 
ηg . (3.18) 
Additionally, the ITI of the ith limb (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) can be obtained using 
Eq. (3.10). 
Step 4: Obtain the LTI for a specific configuration. Taking both the input and output 
transmission performances into account, the LTI for the 6PSS-UPS PM is defined as
Γ = min{λi , η}. (3.19) 
For the 6PSS-UPS PM, the LTI in the different positions and orientations is 
discussed separately here. In this section, the architecture parameters used here are 
the same of those in the 6PSS PM, and set as follows: Rm = 250 mm, l = 440 mm, 
lb = 120 mm, and θm = 30◦. The LTI distributions in the three-dimensional position 
workspace are presented first, and are shown in Fig. 3.4(a), in which the ranges of 
positions and orientations are set as −50 mm ≤ x ≤ 50 mm, −50 mm ≤ y ≤ 50 mm, 
225 mm ≤ z ≤ 275 mm, and α = β = γ = 0°. For clarity, the LTI distributions when z 
= 250 mm are also presented, as shown in Fig. 3.4b, from which it is obvious that the 
distribution is symmetrical about the plane x = 0, and the kinematic performances 
near the central region are better than others.
Similarly, the LTI distributions in the three-dimensional orientation workspace 
are also presented in Fig. 3.5a, in which the ranges of positions and orientations are 
set as x = y = z = 0, −20° ≤ α ≤ −20°, −20° ≤ β ≤ −20°, and −20° ≤ γ ≤ −20°. 
The LTI distributions when γ = 0° are also presented, as shown in Fig. 3.5b, from 
which it is obvious that the distribution is symmetrical about the plane β = 0°, and 
the kinematic performances near the central region are better than others.
Here, the motion/force transmission performance of the 6PSS-UPS redundantly 
actuated PM in a configuration is regarded as good when the value of LTI is equal 
to or bigger than 0.7. According to the results in Figs. 3.4a and 3.5a, the GTW in the3.2 Example 1: 6PSS-UPS PM 111

Fig. 3.5 LTI distribution of the 6PSS-UPS PM in the three-dimensional orientation workspace: a 
three-dimensional orientation distribution and b αβ plane distribution when γ = 0°
position region of the 6PSS-UPS PM, σ, is approximately 0.8965, and the GTW in 
the orientation region of the 6PSS-UPS PM, σ, is approximately 0.1292. The above 
results mean that in the position workspace, the motion/force transmission capability 
with these architectural parameters is reasonably good. However, in the orientation 
workspace, the global performance of the 6PSS-UPS PM with these given parameters 
is not ideal. 
• Optimization of design parameters 
Similar to the above optimization of the 6PSS PM with respect to the GTW, the iter￾ative search method is also used here for the dimensional optimization of the 6PSS￾UPS redundantly actuated PM with respect to the GTW, and the Rm and l are also 
defined as design parameters here. In addition, the variation ranges of two design 
parameters are, respectively, defined as 230 mm ≤ Rm ≤ 270 mm, 420 mm ≤ l ≤
460 mm. Similar to the above section, the position ranges are set as −50 mm ≤ x ≤112 3 Motion/Force Transmission Performance Analysis and Optimization …
50 mm, −50 mm ≤ y ≤ 50 mm, and 225 mm ≤ z ≤ 275 mm, and the orientation 
ranges are set as −20° ≤ α ≤ −20°, −20° ≤ β ≤ −20°, and −20° ≤ γ ≤ −20°. 
Through iterative search and calculation, the distributions of GTW with different 
combinations of design parameters can be obtained, as shown in Figs. 3.6a, b. For 
the 6PSS-UPS PM, although the distributions of GTW in the position workspace 
are different from those in the orientation workspace, the maximum value of GTW 
occurs with the same combination of design parameters, i.e., Rm = 230 mm, l =
460 mm. In the case of optimization regarding position workspace, the maximum of 
GTW is unity and occurs when Rm = 230 mm, l = 460 mm, as shown in Fig. 3.7a. 
In the case of optimization regarding orientation workspace, the maximum of GTW 
occurs when Rm = 230 mm, l = 460 mm, as shown in Fig. 3.7b, and the value 
of GTW is 0.4966. Designers can choose one of these combinations for different 
applications.

• Structure description 
The CAD model and a schematic of the 2UPR-2PRU PM with actuation redundancy 
are shown in Fig. 3.8, which is a 2R1T PM [23]. The PM is composed of a fixed base, 
a moving platform, and 4-DOF actuated limbs that are arranged symmetrically. The 
first limb (B1 A1) and the second limb (B2 A2) are UPR kinematic limbs. Counting 
from the base, the first revolute axes of the U joints of the two limbs coincide with each 
other. The second revolute axes of the U joints are parallel to the axis of the R joint that 
is connected to the mobile platform. Additionally, the R joint axis is perpendicular 
to the P joint. The third and fourth limbs (B3 A3 and B4 A4, respectively) are PRU 
kinematic limbs. The P joints are perpendicular to the fixed base. The R-joint axes 
in limbs 3 and 4 are perpendicular to the P joints and are also parallel to the first 
revolute axes of the U joints in limbs 3 and 4. The second revolute axes of the two U 
joints of limbs 3 and 4, which are connected to the moving platform, coincide with 
each other. 
The A1 and A2 denote the central points of the R joints in limbs 1 and 2, respec￾tively, while the central points of the U joints in limbs 3 and 4 are denoted by A3 
and A4, respectively. The centers of the U joints in limbs 1 and 2 are denoted by B1 
and B2, respectively, while the centers of the R joints in limbs 3 and 4 are denoted 
by B3 and B4, respectively. The sliders of limbs 3 and 4 intersect with the fixed base 
at points B,
3 and B,
4, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3.8. 
The coordinate frames are established as shown in Fig. 3.8a. A fixed coordinate 
frame, O-xyz, is attached to the fixed base, and the origin O is located at the midpoint 
of line B1 B2. The x-axis always points in the direction of O B,
4, the y-axis points 
along O B2, and the z-axis points vertically downwards. A moving coordinate frame, 
o-uvw, is attached to the moving platform. The u-axis points in the direction of 
oA4, and the v-axis points along oA2. The w-axis points vertically downward with

respect to the moving platform. Additionally, limb coordinate frames Bi − xi yi zi 
(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are attached to each limb i. For B1 − x1 y1z1 and B2 − x2 y2z2, 
the x- and y-axes always point along the revolute axes of the U joints in limbs 1 
and 2, respectively. For B3 − x3 y3z3 and B4 − x4 y4z4, the coordinate frame axes 
have the same directions as those of O-xyz. The linkage lengths in the 2UPR-2PRU 
PM are defined as follows: B3 A3 = B4 A4 = l, oo, = H, oA1 = oA2 = l1, 
O B1 = O B2 = l2, oA3 = oA4 = l3, O B,
3 = O B,

between the fixed base and the actuated P joints of limbs 3 and 4, respectively. In 
Fig. 3.9, it is shown that the 2UPR-2PRU PM can be used to machine a workpiece 
with a curved surface when mounted on an x–y table. 
• Inverse kinematics 
The inverse displacement solution for the 2UPR-2PRU PM requires calculation of the 
actuated joint parameters (q1, q2, q3, q4) when the position and orientation parame￾ters (β, γ, zo) of the moving platform are given. The rotation matrix between o-uvw

• Local and global transmission performances 
Before evaluating the motion/force transmission performance of the 2UPR-2PRU 
PM, it is necessary to obtain the TWSs and OTSs first, and then calculate the LTI of 
this PM. The procedure is described as follows: 
Step 1: Determine the TWS in each limb of the 2UPR-2PRU PM. Without loss of 
generality, limb 1 is used as an example. The TWS should be linearly independent 
of passive twists and constraint wrenches simultaneously [25]. Since the actuated 
joint of limb 1 is a P joint, the TWS of limb 1 is reciprocal of the passive joints
[
$11 $12 $14}
and is given by 
$T1 = (
−sβ m13 −cβ; l2cβ 0 −l2sβ
)
. (3.29) 
Similarly, the TWSs for the other three limbs can be derived as follows:3.3 Example 2: 2UPR-2PRU PM 117

$T2 = (
−sβ m23 −cβ; −l2cβ 0 l2sβ

)
$T4 = (
lT4 0 nT4 ; 0 lT4 z A4 − nT4 xA4 0
)
, (3.30) 
where m13 and m23 denote the direction components along the y-axis, and others 
can be expressed as lT3 = xA3+l4 /
(xA3+l4)

2
+(z A4−q4)
2 , and nT4 = z A4−q4 /
(xA4−l4)
2
+(z A4−q4)
2 . 
Step 2: List the locked/active TWSs and form a new wrench system for the 2UPR￾2PRU PM, from which the OTS is then obtained. Consider a 3DOF 2UPR-2PRU 
PM with four limbs. When actuators that are installed in two arbitrarily chosen 
limbs are locked, the corresponding TWSs form a two-order system and turn into 
extra constraint wrenches for the moving platform. When combined with the three 
original constraint wrenches, the PM’s moving platform sustains five independent 
constraint wrenches in total. Using the screw theory, it can be shown that there is 
only one instantaneous 1-DOF twist that is actuated redundantly by two limbs. For 
the 2UPR-2PRU PM, there are N = C2 
4 = 6 combinations that can be used to select 
the two locked limbs. The corresponding locked/active limb combinations are listed 
in Table 3.2. 
The PM of case 1 is selected as an example here. As listed in Table 3.2, the new 
wrench system acting on the moving platform after locking two actuators can be 
written as 
U1 = [
$C1 $C2 $C3 $T1 $T2
}
, (3.31) 
where the CWSs of the 2UPR-2PRU PM can be expressed as

) . (3.32)

}118 3 Motion/Force Transmission Performance Analysis and Optimization …
Accordingly, the instantaneous 1-DOF twist of the moving platform, which is 
denoted by $O1, can be obtained using reciprocal screw theory: 
$O1 ◦ U1 = 0. (3.33) 
There are six cases for the 2UPR-2PRU PM. If these cases have been completed, 
proceed to Step 3; otherwise, return to the start of Step 2 and select the next case. 
Step 3: Calculate the OTI and ITI. Because only the transmission wrenches of the 
active limbs contribute in the output twist direction, the output transmission perfor￾mance of case 1, which reflects the power coefficient between the active transmission 
wrenches and the output twist, can be written as 
η1 =

|$O1 ◦ $T3
|

|$O1 ◦ $T4
|
|
|
|$O1 ◦ $T3
|
|

|$O1 ◦ $T4
|

. (3.34) 
In each case, the output transmissibility of the 1-DOF mechanism is the coupled 
effect of the two active limbs. In a redundantly actuated PM, the output transmission 
performance will not exceed either the maximum or minimum performance values 
of the 1-DOF mechanisms. Thus, when considering all cases, the OTI of the 2UPR￾2PRU redundantly actuated PM in this study is defined as 
η = 1 
6 
Σ
6
g=1 
ηg . (3.35) 
Additionally, the ITI of the ith limb (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) can be obtained using Eq. (3.10). 
Step 4: Obtain the LTI for a specific configuration. Taking both the input and output 
transmission performances into account, the LTI for the 2UPR-2PRU PM is defined 
as
Γ = min{λi , η}. (3.36) 
For the 2UPR-2PRU PM, the architectural parameters are set as follows: l1 =250 mm, 
l2 = 400 mm, l3 = 200 mm, l4 = 320 mm, −40◦ ≤ β ≤ 40◦, −40◦ ≤ γ ≤ 40◦, and 
zo ∈ [
400 mm 800 mm}
. The link parameter l is defined as 
l = max{
|zo tan βmax + l4 − l3cβmax|, |zo tan βmax − l4 + l3cβmax|
}
. (3.37) 
The LTI distribution for the 2UPR-2PRU PM can then be obtained as shown in 
Fig. 3.10. The workspace volume of the end effector for a tool head length H of 
50 mm is shown in Fig. 3.10a. Additionally, the LTI distribution when zo = 600 mm 
is shown in Fig. 3.10b and is symmetrical about the planes x = 0 and y = 0. The 
PM’s orientation workspace is completely symmetrical with respect to both angles, 
as shown in Fig. 3.10c. In Fig. 3.10, it shows that having a configuration that is3.3 Example 2: 2UPR-2PRU PM 119
Fig. 3.10 LTI distribution for the 2UPR-2PRU PM: a workspace volume, b workspace when 
zo = 600 mm, and c orientation workspace 
closer to the initial situation leads to better motion/force transmission performance. 
Additionally, in contrast with the angle γ , the motion/force transmission performance 
decreases more rapidly when the angle β deviates from 0◦. 
Here, the region where Γ ≥ 0.7 is defined as the GTW of the 2UPR-2PRU 
PM. The effects of the architectural parameters, l1, l2, l3, and l4 on σ are shown in 
Fig. 3.11, in which Figs. 3.11a–d show that higher l1, l3, and l4 values produce better 
σ values for the 2UPR-2PRU PM, and Fig. 3.11b shows the relationship between σ
and l2, where a higher l2 produces a reduced σ. Additionally, the figures show that 
the effects of l2, l3, and l4 on σ are much stronger than that of l1.
• Optimization of design parameters 
The GTW of the 2UPR-2PRU PM is highly dependent on the design parameters l1, 
l2, l3, and l4. By considering the rotation angles and operating height limitations, the 
ranges of motion are set as follows: β ∈ [−40◦, 40◦], γ ∈ [−40◦, 40◦], and zo =
1.5l2. Here, the PFNM is used to optimize the design parameters. For a 2UPR-2PRU 
PM, l1, l2, and l3 are defined as design parameters and are normalized as120 3 Motion/Force Transmission Performance Analysis and Optimization …

. (3.38) 
The non-dimensional and normalized parameters r1, r2, r3, and r4 are then deduced 
as 
ri = li 
D (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). (3.39) 
In real applications, the normalized parameters should satisfy
{
r1,r3 ≤ r2,r4 
0 < r1,r2,r3,r4 < 3 . (3.40) 
Using the PFNM method [26], the PDS can be obtained as shown in Fig. 3.12, 
where the shaded area represents the set of all possible points. For convenience, 
the chosen area can be transformed into a plan view, as shown in Fig. 3.12b. The 
relationship between the parameters in three-dimensional space (r1, r2, r3) and those 
in plan space (s, t) is given as follows3.3 Example 2: 2UPR-2PRU PM 121

The design steps required for performance optimization are as follows: 
Step 1: Identify the optimal regions. The GTW distributions can be obtained as shown 
in Fig. 3.13. When the parameters (s, t) are closer to point B, the σ value is higher. 
Here, region I (where σ ∈ [0.3, 0.6)) is regarded as having poor global motion/force 
transmission, region II (where σ ∈ [0.6, 0.7)) is regarded as having medium global 
motion/force transmission, and region III (where σ ≥ 0.7) is regarded as having 
good global motion/force transmission.
Step 2: Select three groups of data points randomly from each of optimal regions I, 
II, and III; nine groups of data points are selected in this study. The non-dimensional 
parameters r1, r2, and r3 can be obtained for each group using Eq. (3.41). The four 
design parameters l1, l2, l3, and l4 and the two plan space parameters s and t can then 
be obtained using Eqs. (3.39) and (3.41), and are listed in Table 3.3.
Step 3: Determine the normalized factor D and dimensional parameters l1, l2, and 
l3. By considering the occupied area and the non-dimensional parameters that are 
selected from the optimal design regions, the normalized factor D is determined to 
be 500 mm in this study. For example, the design parameters in group 7 are selected 
as the optimal results, where r1 = 0.95, r2 = 1.21, and r3 = 0.84. The li values can 
then be obtained using Eq. (3.39), giving l1 = 475 mm, l2 = 605 mm, l3 = 420 mm, 
and l4 = 535 mm. 
Step 4: Check whether the dimensional parameters obtained in Step 3 are suitable 
for actual use. If the actual assembly conditions are satisfied, then the procedure is122 3 Motion/Force Transmission Performance Analysis and Optimization …

complete; otherwise, return to Step 3, select another group of data from the optimal 
region, and repeat Steps 3 and 4. Based on the dimensional parameters obtained from 
the previous step (i.e., l1 = 475 mm, l2 = 605 mm, l3 = 420 mm, and l4 = 535 mm), 
analysis of the kinematics and performances indicates that a manipulator with these 
parameters would be suitable for actual use and should work normally. 
In Fig. 3.14, it compares the motion/force transmissions in regions I, II, and III, 
where the design parameters in groups 3, 6, and 9 of Table 3.3 are chosen as examples. 
As shown in Fig. 3.14c, the GTW value in region III is 0.756, which is better than the 
corresponding values for the other two examples. This shows that region III should 
be selected as the optimal region. Designers can choose one of these combinations 
for different applications.3.3 Example 2: 2UPR-2PRU PM 123

3.4 Example 3: 2PUR-2PRU PM 
• Structure description 
The CAD model and kinematic scheme of the 2R1T 2PUR-2PRU PM [24] are shown 
in Fig. 3.15, where it can be seen that the moving platform is connected to the fixed 
base through four kinematic limbs arranged symmetrically. The first limb A1 B1 and 
the second limb A2 B2 are identical PUR kinematic limbs. The first revolute axes of 
the U joints coincide with each other. The second revolute axes of the U joints are 
parallel to the axis of the R joint connected to the moving platform and perpendicular 
to the P joints. The third limb A3 B3 and fourth limb A4 B4 are PRU kinematic limbs. 
The axes of the R joints are perpendicular to the P joints and parallel to the first 
revolute axes of the U joints. Moreover, the second revolute axes of the U joints 
connected to the moving platform coincide with each other. Because of the special 
structure, points B1, B2, B3, and B4 are not in the same plane, while B1C1 and B2C2 
are perpendicular to the moving platform and intersect at points C1 and C2. Actuated 
by the four fixed serve motors, the moving platform of the 2PUR-2PRU PM can 
achieve the required motions, namely 2R1T. 
As shown in Fig. 3.15b, the fixed frame O-XYZ is attached to the fixed base. 
The origin O is at the intersection point of A1 A2 and A3 A4, and the X- and Y-axes 
pass through points A1 and A3, respectively. A moving frame P-uvw is attached 
to the moving platform with the u-axis along PC2 and the v-axis along P B3. The 
dimensional parameters of the 2PUR-2PRU PM are defined as follows: PC1 =
PC2 = l1, P B3 = P B4 = l2, A1 B1 = A2 B2 = l3, A3 B3 = A4 B4 = l4, and 
B1C1 = B2C2 = e. The coordinates of points A1, A2, A3, and A4 with respect to O￾xyz are defined as (

where qi denotes the distance between the fixed base and the actuated P joints of

• Inverse kinematics 
The inverse displacement solution for the 2PUR-2PRU PM requires calculation of the 
actuated joint parameters (q1, q2, q3, q4) when the position and orientation param￾eters (α, β, zo) of the moving platform are given. The rotation matrix of the moving 
frame P-uvw with respect to the fixed frame O-XYZ can be described by successively 
rotating around the X-axis with the α angle, and around the v-axis with the β angle, 
as follows 
O RP = RX (α)Rv(β) =

⎠,
(3.42) 
where RX (α) and Rv(β) represent the rotational matrices around the X-axis and 
v-axis, respectively. 
By considering the structural constraints, the position vector p of point P relative to 
the O-XYZ is always limited into the X =0 plane and defined as p = (
0 zosα zocα
)T 
, 
where zo denotes the operation distance between points O and P. Through this 
geometric relationship, the position vectors qi of point Ai with respect to O-XYZ 
can be expressed as follows: 
qi = p − ai + bi , (3.43) 
where ai and bi represent the position vectors of Ai Bi and P Bi in O-XYZ, 
respectively. Additionally, the position vectors bi can be expressed as follows:

• Motion/Force transmission performance 
Using the same procedure as listed in the example of the 2UPR-2PRU PM, the ITSs, 
TWSs, CWSs, and OTSs of the 2PUR-2PRU PM also can be derived. For example, 
the TWSs and CWSs of the 2PUR-2PRU PM can be obtained as

Based on these results, the OTSs of the 2PUR-2PRU PM can be calculated. Substi￾tuting these screws into Eqs. (3.8)–(3.11), the LTI of the 2PUR-2PRU PM can be 
obtained. Using the original parameters (l1 = 120 mm, l2 = 120 mm, l3 = 475 mm, 
l4 = 375 mm, and e = 80 mm), the LTI distribution of the 2PUR-2PRU PM is shown 
in Fig. 3.16, wherein the red points marking Γ = 0.7 form two curves. The rotation 
angles and operating distance are set as α ∈ [−30◦, 30◦], β ∈ [−30◦, 30◦], and zo 
= 250 mm. With a tool head length of H = 50 mm, the LTI distribution in a three￾dimensional workspace shown in Fig. 3.16a is symmetrical about the X = 0 and Y 
= 0 planes, which means that the distribution atlas in the orientation workspace is 
also symmetrical with respect to both angles, as shown in Fig. 3.16b. In this section, 
it is assumed here that the region for which Γ ≥ 0.7 can be considered as the GTW. 
However, the ratio of the region where Γ ≥ 0.7 with these link parameters is only 
34.4%, which means that the motion/force transmission capability is not satisfactory.
• Optimization of design parameters 
The dimensional parameters of the 2PUR-2PRU PM are optimized with respect to the 
GTW. The rotation angles and operating distance are set as follows: α ∈ [−30◦, 30◦], 
β ∈ [−30◦, 30◦],and zo = √2/2l3. Without loss of generality, we let parameter 
e = 2l2/3. Using the PFNM method [26], the design parameters are normalized as 
follows:

Considering practical applications, the normalized parameters should satisfy the 
following relationship:

0 < r1,r2,r3,r4 < 3 . (3.49) 
As shown in Fig. 3.17, the parameter design space includes all possible points,

The distribution of σ in the PDS is shown in Fig. 3.17b, and the global motion/force 
transmissibility is best at s = 0.52 and t = 2.6. By substituting s and t into Eq. (3.50), 
the non-dimensional parameters can be obtained as r1 = 0.52, r2 = 0.49, and r3 =
1.99. Considering the actual operation environment, the normalized factor D is deter￾mined as 200 mm, and the link parameters can be obtained using Eq. (3.48), i.e., l1 
= 104 mm, l2 = 98 mm, l3 = 398 mm, l4 = 422 mm, and e = 65.4 mm. The distribu￾tion of LTI with optimized parameters is shown in Fig. 3.18. In comparison with the 
results obtained using the original parameters, which are presented in Fig. 3.16, the 
GTW ratio is enlarged from 34.4% to 95.8%, which means that these dimensional 
parameters are suitable for the design of the 2PUR-2PRU PM. Designers can choose 
one of these combinations in the parameter design space for different applications.128 3 Motion/Force Transmission Performance Analysis and Optimization …

3.5 Summary 
This chapter presents the motion/force transmission performance analysis and opti￾mization of PMs with actuation redundancy. To evaluate the motion/force transmis￾sion of a redundantly actuated PM accurately, it is essential to establish an index that 
is consistent with the nature of actuation redundancy. New indices for measuring the 
motion/force transmission of redundantly actuated PMs are present in this chapter. In 
the proposed indices, a redundantly actuated PM is divided into multiple subsidiary 
redundantly actuated 1-DOF PMs. Such a strategy guarantees the consistency of the 
extracted 1-DOF PMs with the parent PM. The mean value of instantaneous power 
produced by the multiple actuation wrenches and one twist of the moving platform 
of these subsidiary 1-DOF PMs is used to describe the output motion/force transmis￾sion of the parent PM. Based on this index of output transmission, coordinate-freeReferences 129
LTI and GTW with clear physical interpretation are established. Three examples, 
6PSS-UPS PM, 2UPR-2PRU PM, and 2PUR-2PRU PM, demonstrate that these new 
indices are effective and suitable to be used in the optimal design of redundantly 
actuated PMs.

Motion/Force Constraint Performance 
Analysis and Optimization 
of Overconstrained Parallel 
Manipulators with Actuation 
Redundancy 
In Sect. 2.4, the motion/force constraint performance of overconstrained PMs without 
actuation redundancy [1–3] has been studied. The research on motion/force constraint 
performance of redundantly actuated and overconstrained PMs will be presented 
here. For redundantly actuated and overconstrained PMs, they have two obvious 
features: (1) the number of actuated wrenches is greater than the required DOFs; 
(2) the number of constraint wrenches is greater than the limited DOFs. With these 
inherent factors, it can be found that the constraint performance analysis of OCI [4] is 
complex because the relationship between the output virtual twist and the constraint 
wrench is not one-to-one, which complicates the analysis of constrainability. To 
the best of our knowledge, there is still a lack of a general method to evaluate the 
motion/force constrainability of overconstrained PMs with actuation redundancy. 
The key to establishing the new method is to properly deal with the influence of 
multiple wrenches on the constraint performance of redundantly actuated and over￾constrained PMs. Inspired by some work [4–11], this chapter proposes a series of 
new motion/force constraint indices to evaluate the motion/force constrainability of 
redundantly actuated and overconstrained PMs [12], including the OCI, TCoI, and 
GCoW. All of these indices are dimensionless and finite that vary from zero to unit. 
In this chapter, the motion/force constraint performance analysis and optimization 
of redundantly actuated and overconstrained PMs will be presented. Because the 
2UPR-2PRU PM and 2PUR-2PRU PM studied in the above chapter are redundantly 
actuated and overconstrained PMs, they are taken as examples here for analysis and 
discussion.

4.1 Motion/Force Constraint Indices of Overconstrained 
Parallel Manipulators with Actuation Redundancy 
• Constraint performance index 
Without loss of generality, a general redundantly actuated and overconstrained PM 
with m-DOF is shown in Fig. 4.1, which is composed of one fixed base, one moving 
platform, and n limbs (n > m). Each limb is assumed with only one actuated joint 
here. The definitions of constraint wrench system UC and transmission wrench 
system UT of a redundantly actuated and overconstrained PM are the same as those 
of the overconstrained PMs without redundancy actuation, which can be found from 
Eqs. 2.92–2.95. Therefore, there are n TWSs in the redundantly actuated and over￾constrained PM, which are expressed as $Tj (j = 1, 2, …, n), and g = n 
j=1

6 − q j

CWSs acting on the moving platform, which are expressed as $Ci (i = 1, 2, …, g). 
For an m-DOF redundantly actuated and overconstrained PM in a certain non￾singular configuration, as shown in Fig. 4.1, it keeps balanced with (n + g) wrenches, 
which includes n (n > m) TWSs and g (g >6 − m) CWSs. Among these (n +
g) wrenches, there are six independent wrenches, and others are linearly depen￾dent on these six wrenches. For the redundantly actuated and overconstrained 
PMs, the influences of these (n + g − 6) linearly dependent wrenches on the 
motion/force constrainability should be considered. Recently, by considering several 
six-dimensional subsystems separately by the way of removing other (n + g − 6) 
wrenches, Meng et al. [6] analyzed the motion/force interaction performance of 
redundantly actuated and overconstrained PMs with closed-loop subchains.

representation of an m-DOF 
redundantly actuated and 
overconstrained PM 4.1 Motion/Force Constraint Indices of Overconstrained Parallel … 133
Inspired by the above work, a new method for the constraint evaluation of redun￾dantly actuated and overconstrained PMs is presented here, which takes the effects of 
(n + g − 6) linearly dependent wrenches into account reasonably. First, by locking 
all the TWSs, they are converted into n new CWSs, and then the redundantly actuated 
and overconstrained PM becomes a statically indeterminate structure with (n + g) 
CWSs. Then, “lose” (n + g − 5) wrenches while remaining five linearly independent 
wrenches locked so that the redundantly actuated and overconstrained PM effectively 
becomes an instantaneous 1-DOF mechanism. The unique instantaneous motion of 
the moving platform is defined as virtual OTS [4]. Considering the force character￾istics of redundantly actuated and overconstrained PMs, at least k (k ≥ 1) of the 
“lost” (n + g − 5) wrenches are linearly independent with the five locked wrenches, 
which can be used to prevent the virtual instantaneous motion. Next, through ergodic 
analysis, there are at most C5 
n+g cases need to be considered. Here, the instantaneous 
power between the k linearly independent wrenches in the (n + g − 5) wrenches and 
the unique instantaneous twist is defined as the output constraint performance of the 
1-DOF mechanism. For different k, the calculation method is not the same, which 
is similar to the evaluation process in Sect. 2.4. Averaging the values of the output 
constraint indices of these 1-DOF mechanisms gives the overall output constraint 
performance of the redundantly actuated and overconstrained PM, and the OCI is 
also defined as ζ . Finally, the total constraint performance is calculated by consid￾ering both the input and output constraint performances, and the TCoI is also defined 
as κ=√η ∗ ζ . Similar to the method in Sect. 2.4, the global constraint performance 
index of overconstrained PMs with actuation redundancy also can be evaluated, and 
the GCoW is also defined as σGCoW. The purpose of this method is to describe the 
motion/force constrainability of the redundantly actuated and overconstrained PM by 
evaluating the constraint performance of several 1-DOF mechanisms with multiple 
wrenches. A procedure for evaluating a general redundantly actuated and overcon￾strained PM is presented in Fig. 4.2. Because the evaluation process of the constraint 
performance of redundantly actuated and overconstrained PMs is similar to that of 
overconstrained PMs without actuation redundancy, the detailed steps are not listed 
here. By combining Sect. 2.4 and Fig. 4.2, the readers can quickly understand this 
evaluation method.
It should be noted again that although the evaluation methods used for the 
constraint performance in Sect. 2.4 and this chapter are similar, they are completely 
different in the losing strategy of wrenches. For the overconstrained PMs without 
actuation redundancy, the constraint performance in each configuration is analyzed 
by locking m TWSs and “losing” (m + g − 5) CWSs. For the overconstrained PMs 
with actuation redundancy, however, the constraint performance in each configura￾tion is analyzed by locking n TWSs and “losing” (n + g − 5) wrenches, in which 
the “losing” (n + g − 5) wrenches are composed of TWSs and CWSs. Therefore, 
there are more situations that should be considered in the evaluation of redundantly 
actuated and overconstrained PMs.134 4 Motion/Force Constraint Performance Analysis and Optimization …

In the following sections, the motion/force constraint indices based on the screw 
theory will be used to evaluate and optimize the performance of two overconstrained 
PMs with actuation redundancy, namely 2UPR-2PRU [2] and 2PUR-2PRU [3], and 
the effectiveness of the proposed constraint index will be verified. 
4.2 Example 1: 2UPR-2PRU PM 
• Local and global constraint performances 
Before evaluating the motion/force constraint performance of the 2UPR-2PRU PM 
[2], it is necessary to obtain the TWSs and CWSs of limbs first. The TWSs of limbs 
have been listed in Eqs. 3.29 and 3.30. For the CWSs of each limb in the 2UPR-2PRU 
PM, they can be derived by using the reciprocal screw theory, which are expressed 
as
$C1 = 
000; sβ 0 cβ

$C2 = 
cβ 0 −sβ; l2sβ 0 l2cβ

$C7 = 
000; sβ 0 cβ

$C8 = 
0 1 0; −z A4 − yA4 tanβ 0 0  (4.4) 
Based on these results, the OTSs of the 2UPR-2PRU PM in different cases can 
be calculated, and the TCoI of the 2UPR-2PRU PM can be obtained. Taking the 
interference between the limbs of the 2UPR-2PRU PM into account, the design 
parameters of the 2UPR-2PRU PM are set as follows: l1 = 250 mm, l2 = 400 mm, 
l3 = 200 mm, l4 = 320 mm, −40◦ ≤ β ≤ 40◦, −40◦ ≤ γ ≤ 40◦. Here, we 
consider the TCoI distribution at a constant operation distance, z0 = 600 mm. The 
TCoI distribution of the 2UPR-2PRU PM is shown in Fig. 4.3. It is clear that the 
distribution is symmetrical about the β = 0◦ and γ = 0◦, which is consistent with 
the structure of the 2UPR-2PRU PM.
The global constraint performance of the 2UPR-2PRU PM can be derived. Here, 
the motion/force constraint performance of the 2UPR-2PRU PM in a configuration 
is regarded as good when the value of TCoI is equal to or bigger than 0.7. According136 4 Motion/Force Constraint Performance Analysis and Optimization …

to the distributions in Fig. 4.3, the ratio of the region where κ ≥ 0.7 for the 2UPR￾2PRU PM is approximately equal to 1, which means that the motion/force constraint 
capability with these architectural parameters is reasonably good. 
• Optimization of design parameters 
Although the motion/force constraint performance of the 2UPR-2PRU PM in the 
workspace is great, the optimization of the design parameters of the 2UPR-2PRU 
PM that based on σGCoW is also needed for more choices. The PFNM method also 
can be used here, and the optimization process is similar to that of the motion/force 
transmission performance of the 2UPR-2PRU PM. The distribution of σGCoW in the 
PDS [13] is shown in Fig. 4.4, from which one can find that global performance in the 
most region of the available area is equal to unity, which means that the designers can 
choose many combinations in the parameter design space for different applications. 
For example, the designers can choose the combination with s = 0.95 and t = 1.94. 
By substituting s and t into Eq. 3.41, the non-dimensional parameters can be obtained 
as r1 = 0.95, r2 = 1.21, and r3 = 0.84. Considering the actual operation environment, 
the normalized factor D is determined as 500 mm, and the values of li can then be 
obtained using Eq. 3.39, i.e., l1 = 475 mm, l2 = 605 mm, l3 = 420 mm, and l4 =
535 mm. The distribution of TCoI with the above parameters is shown in Fig. 4.5, 
from which one can find that the 2UPR-2PRU PM has good constraint performance 
by using these parameters.4.3 Example 2: 2PUR-2PRU PM 137

Using the same procedure as listed in the example of the 2UPR-2PRU PM, the CWSs, 
and OTSs of the 2PUR-2PRU PM [3] also can be derived. For example, the CWSs 
of each limb in the 2PUR-2PRU PM can be obtained as138 4 Motion/Force Constraint Performance Analysis and Optimization …

Based on these results, the OTSs of the 2PUR-2PRU PM in different cases can 
be calculated, and the TCoI of the 2PUR-2PRU PM can be obtained. Taking the 
interference between the limbs of the 2PUR-2PRU PM into account, the design 
parameters of the 2PUR-2PRU PM are set as follows: l1 = 120 mm, l2 = 120 mm, 
l3 = 475 mm, l4 = 375 mm, and e = 80 mm. The rotation angles and operating 
distance are set as α ∈ [−30◦, 30◦], β ∈ [−30◦, 30◦], and z0 = 250 mm. The TCoI 
distribution of the 2PUR-2PRU PM is shown in Fig. 4.6. It is clear that the distribution 
is symmetrical about the α = 0° and β = 0°
, which is consistent with the structure 
of the 2PUR-2PRU PM.

The global constraint performance of the 2PUR-2PRU PM can be derived. 
According to the distributions in Fig. 4.6, the ratio of the region where κ ≥ 0.7 for 
the 2PUR-2PRU PM is approximately equal to 1, which means that the motion/force 
constraint capability with these architectural parameters is reasonably good. 
• Optimization of design parameters 
Based on the motion/force constraint performance, the optimization of the design 
parameters of the 2PUR-2PRU PM that based on σGCoW also can be presented. The 
PFNM method also can be used here, and the optimization process is similar to 
that of the motion/force transmission performances of the 2PUR-2PRU PM. The 
distribution of σGCoW in the PDS [13] is shown in Fig. 4.7, from which one can find 
that global performance in the all regions is equal to unity, which means that the 
designers can choose many combinations in the parameter design space for different 
applications. For example, the designers can choose the combination with s = 0.52 
and t = 2.60. By substituting s and t into Eq. 3.50, the non-dimensional parameters 
can be obtained as r1 = 0.52, r2 = 0.49, and r3 = 1.99. Considering the actual 
operation environment, the normalized factor D is determined as 200 mm, and the 
values of li can then be obtained using Eq. 3.48, i.e., l1 = 104 mm, l2 = 98 mm, l3 
= 398 mm, l4 = 422 mm, and e = 65.4 mm. The distribution of TCoI with the above 
parameters is shown in Fig. 4.8, from which one can find that the 2PUR-2PRU PM 
has good constraint performance by using these parameters.

4.4 Summary 
This chapter presents new constraint indices for measuring the motion/force 
constrainability of redundantly actuated and overconstrained PMs, which are frame￾invariant and range from zero to unity. The key to establishing the new method is to 
properly deal with the influence of multiple wrenches on the constraint performance 
of redundantly actuated and overconstrained PMs. In the proposed indices, locking 
all n transmission wrenches leads to an overconstrained PM with actuation redun￾dancy becoming an indeterminate structure with (n + g) constraint wrenches. Then 
(n + g − 5) wrenches are “lost” while only the remaining five linearly independent 
wrenches are locked. So that multiple 1-DOF mechanisms are produced from the 
redundantly actuated and overconstrained PM. The output constraint performance of 
these 1-DOF mechanisms is the instantaneous power of all the linearly independent 
wrenches in the (n + g − 5) wrenches that are devoted to motion. Different calcu￾lation processes are used for different number k of linearly independent wrenches. 
After that, the output motion/force constrainability of an overconstrained PM with 
actuation redundancy can be described with the mean value of the instantaneous 
power of these 1-DOF mechanisms. Based on the proposed OCI and TCoI, the global 
index, GCoW, is established. Two examples demonstrate that these new indices are 
effective and suitable to be used in the optimal design of redundantly actuated and 
overconstrained PMs.

Elastostatic Stiffness Evaluation 
and Optimization of Parallel 
Manipulators 
In this chapter, we focus on the stiffness performance evaluation and optimization 
design of parallel manipulators (PMs), the comprehensive stiffness index (CSI) that 
separates the linear stiffness and angular stiffness and considers the effect of the 
coupling of the non-diagonal elements is introduced, as well as the extreme stiffness 
index. The 2UPR-RPU PM is taken as an example here for analysis and discussion, 
and the comparison of optimization results from different optimization algorithms 
is presented. 
5.1 Stiffness Performance Evaluation Index 
The purpose of stiffness analysis is to obtain a 6 × 6 stiffness matrix that reflects the 
mapping between the external wrench and infinitesimal twist. To evaluate whether 
the stiffness performance of the mechanism meets the engineering requirements, it 
is necessary to transform the stiffness matrix into a quantifiable stiffness index. To 
achieve this, many researchers have defined multiple stiffness indices for evaluating 
the stiffness performance of mechanisms, such as the eigenvalue index, which uses 
the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the overall stiffness matrix as stiffness 
indices, PDSI, which uses the six elements of the principal diagonal of the overall 
stiffness matrix as stiffness indices, the determinant index, which uses the value of 
the determinant of the overall stiffness matrix as a stiffness index, the trace index, 
which is defined as the trace of the overall stiffness matrix, the VW index, which 
is defined as the reciprocal of virtual work done by a unit external wrench, and the 
instantaneous energy index, which is based on the instantaneous energy defined by the 
reciprocal product of the external wrench and corresponding deflection [1–9]. Finally, 
the configuration stiffness index is defined as the minimum strain energy under all 
possible external unit forces or moments [10]. The above indices can evaluate the 
relative stiffness of the same mechanism under a given configuration; however, they

cannot specify whether the stiffness performance meets the accuracy requirements. In 
this chapter, the CSI is proposed to separate the linear stiffness and angular stiffness 
that indicate the resistance of the mechanism to a force and couple, it also considers 
the effect of the coupling of the non-diagonal elements of the compliance matrix 
on stiffness performance. Compared with the minimum and maximum eigenvalue 
index and decoupling stiffness index, the CSI has a clear physical meaning and 
defined dimensions and does not require a complicated decoupling process. The 
detailed definition of the CSI is as follows. 
The mapping relationship between an external wrench and the infinitesimal 
deformation of the mechanism can be expressed as 
δ = CW , (5.1) 
where δ = [δdx, δdy, δdz; δϕx, δϕy, δϕz]
T is the infinitesimal deflection, δdx, δdy, and δdz 
represent translational deflection along the x-, y, and z-axes, respectively, and δϕx, 
δϕy, and δϕz represent rotational deflection along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. 
In addition, C is the compliance matrix, w = [f x, f y, f z; mx, my, mz]
T is the external 
wrench, f x, f y, and f z represent the forces along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively, 
and mx, my, and mz represent the moment along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. 
Generally, the overall compliance matrix of a mechanism can be expressed as 
(5.2) 
where C11, C12, C21, and C22 represent the four 3 × 3 submatrices. The units of 
the upper left corner of the compliance matrix in Eq. (5.2) are m/N, reflecting the 
influence of a force on the linear displacement. The units of the upper right corner 
are m/N m, reflecting the influence of a couple on the linear displacement. The units 
of the bottom left corner are rad/N, reflecting the influence of a force on the angular 
displacement. Finally, the units of the bottom right corner are rad/N m, reflecting the 
influence of a couple on the angular displacement. 
To measure the stiffness performance of the mechanism for a force along the along 
the direction of the x-axis, w = [1 N·m, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0]T is substituted into Eq. (5.1) to 
yield the following:
{
δdx = c11, δdy = c21, δdz = c31 
δϕx = c41, δϕy = c51, δϕz = c61 
. (5.3) 
Therefore, the resultant translational and rotational deflection of the mechanism 
when a unit force is applied along the direction of the x-axis can be used as the5.1 Stiffness Performance Evaluation Index 145

If w contains only f x, then Eq. (5.8) degenerates to Eq. (5.3). If w is a general 
force in a random direction, then each formula in Eq. (5.8) contains only the first 
three terms. In the same manner, if w is a general couple in a random direction, 
then each formula in Eq. (5.8) contains only the last three terms. Equations (5.8) and 
(5.9) show that the CSI considers the influence of the non-diagonal elements of the 
compliance matrix; this makes the evaluation index more objective and comprehen￾sive. Additionally, the CSI has a clear physical meaning and defined dimensional 
units, which makes it potentially useful in engineering applications. 
Combining Eqs. (5.8) and (5.9) enables the evaluation of the compliance perfor￾mance of the mechanism in any direction. Next, we discuss how to find the directions 
of extreme compliance. We first discuss the maximum and minimum compliance 
and its corresponding directions for an external force, that is, w = [nT

Simultaneous Eqs. (5.23) and (5.24) are used to determine the directions of 
extreme compliance, and then Eq. (5.9) is used to obtain the corresponding extreme 
compliance values. Both Eqs. (5.23) and (5.24) are nonlinear equations, so numerical 
algorithms should be adopted to solve them. In this chapter, The PSO and genetic 
algorithms are used to solve them. 
Compared with the maximum and minimum eigenvalue index, the CSI proposed in 
this chapter decouples the extreme compliance values of the linear displacement and 
angular displacement and has a clear physical meaning and defined dimension. The 
maximum and minimum eigenvalue index does not decouple the linear displacement 
compliance and angular displacement compliance, and the units of the eigenvalue as 
well as the physical meaning are not clear. 
The local CSI (LCSI) can be obtained by directly taking the reciprocal of the 
compliance index as follows: 
kd = 1/cd (N/m), kϕ = 1/cϕ (N/rad), (5.25) 
where cd and cϕ denote the linear and angular compliance indices, respectively. 
In addition, kd and kϕ denote the linear and angular stiffness index, respectively. 
The LCSI only indicates the stiffness performance of the mechanism for a certain 
position. To obtain the stiffness performance of the mechanism throughout the entire 
prescribed workspace, the global CSI (GCSI) is defined. Similar to the calculation 
of the GTI, discrete points are often used to calculate the GCSI:

PM [11, 12] is shown in Fig. 5.1. The moving platform is connected to the fixed 
platform by two UPR limbs and one RPU limb. The UPR limbs connect to the fixed 
platform at Bi (i = 1, 2) through a universal joint and the moving platform at Ai (i 
= 1, 2) through an R joint. The axes of the two R joints are parallel with each other. 
The first rotation axes of the two U joints are collinear with B1B2, and the other axis 
is parallel to the axis of the R joint in the same limb. The RPU limb connects to the 
fixed platform at B3 through an R joint and the moving platform at A3 through a U 
joint. The two axes of the U joint of the RPU limb are parallel with the two axes150 5 Elastostatic Stiffness Evaluation and Optimization of Parallel Manipulators
Fig. 5.1 2UPR-RPU overconstrained PM. a schematic diagram and b schematic representation 
of the U joints of the UPR limb. The axes of the prismatic joints extend along BiAi 
and are perpendicular to the axis of the R joints. With this specific arrangement, the 
2UPR-RPU PM has three DOFs, namely a rotation β about the X-axis, rotation γ
about the y-axis, and translation along the Oo direction. Moreover, {Ai-xiyizi} (i =
1, 2) and {B3-x3y3z3} represent the local coordinate system of the rods wherein they 
are located. The coordinate frames of the three R joints are the same as the three local 
coordinate frames of the rods, and {B1-uvw}is the coordinate frame of the U joint 
in the first limb. Because the coordinate frames of the three U joints are identical, 
to keep the graph clean, only the coordinate system of one U joint is shown in the 
figure. The geometrical parameters are denoted as follows: OB1 = OB2 = OB3 =
r1; oA1 = oA2 = oA3 = r2; A1B1 = l1; A2B2 = l2; A3B3 = l3. 
The inverse kinematic solution of the mechanism must be obtained before the 
stiffness analysis. From Fig. 5.1, the closed vector-loop equations are obtained (for 
more details, see [12]) 
Bi Ai = p + O Ro 
o oAi − O Bi (i = 1, 2, 3) (5.27) 
The coordinate system is defined as follows to facilitate the elastostatic stiffness 
modeling of the 2UPR-RPU PM.

where O Ro is the transform matrix from frames {o} to {O}, o R1 and o R2 denote 
the transform matrices from limb coordinate systems {A1} and {A2} to frame {o}, 
respectively, O R3 is the transform matrices from limb coordinate system {A3} to 
frame {O}. ϕ1 and ϕ2 are the angles between the 1st and 2nd limb with the z-axis of 
frame {o}, respectively, ϕ3 is the angle the 3rd limb with the Z-axis of frame {O}. 
5.2.1 Stiffness Modeling 
The force analyses of the UPR limb, RPU limb, and mobile platform are shown in 
Figs. 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, respectively. For the UPR limb, as shown in Fig. 5.2, the limb 
coordinate system Ai-xiyizi is established as follows: The yi axis is parallel to the R 
axis, the zi axis is along the direction of the limb, and the xi axis is determined by 
the right-hand rule. Based on screw theory, there exists a driving force f i1 that passes 
through the U-joint center Bi and points to the R-joint center Ai, a constraint force 
f i2 that passes through the U-joint center Bi and is parallel to the R-joint axis, and 
a constraint couple Ti1 that is perpendicular to the two axes of the U joint. For the 
RPU limb, as shown in Fig. 5.3, the xi axis is parallel to the R axis, the zi axis is 
along the direction of bar BiAi, and the yi axis is determined by the right-hand rule. 
Furthermore, there is a driving force f i1 that passes through U-joint center Ai and 
points to R-joint center Ai. There is also a constraint force f i2 that passes through 
U-joint center Bi and is parallel to the R-joint axis. Finally, there is a constraint couple 
Ti1 that is perpendicular to the two axes of the U joint. 
The unit vectors of f i1, f i2, and Ti1 are given below: 
f i1 = li , τi1 = X × yi (i = 1, 2, 3), f i2 = yi (i = 1, 2), f i2 = xi (i = 3),

where X is the unit vector along the X-axis. For the UPR limb, according to the 
translation of a force from theoretical mechanics, the force acting on a rigid body 
can be equivalently translated to any point on the rigid body, but a couple must be 
added to the plane determined by the force and the point. This moment is equal 
to the moment of the force on the point. Hence, a force f i2 and a couple Ti2 at 
the R-joint center are equivalent to the force f i2 acting at the U-joint center, where 
Ti2 = Ti2τi2 = Li zi × fi2 yi = −Li fi2 xi=mi2(−xi ). Because the flexibility 
matrix Ci is independent of the coordinate systems, for convenience of calculation, 
we express the above vectors in the limb coordinate system. 
Based on the mechanics of materials and screw theory [11], the internal forces at 
any cross-section of the UPR and RPU limbs can be expressed as follows: 
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
fiz = fi1

After Ci is solved for, Ki can be solved by C−1 
i . In Eqs. (5.37) and (5.38), the 
flexibility matrix Ci is a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix rather than the more familiar 6 ×
6 matrix and its expression is relatively concise. This indicates that the method of 
Castigliano’s second theorem can reduce the dimensions of the matrix. The fact that 
ci 
23 and ci 
32 are not zero means that a coupling relationship exists between δi2 and δi3. 
Equations 5.37 and 5.38 shows that flexibility matrix Ci is independent with respect 
to the limb coordinate frame. Hence, the local coordinate system is selected only to 
facilitate the expression of the vectors. 
An overconstrained PM is a statically indeterminate structure because of the over￾constrained wrenches in each limb. That is, there are more unknowns than equilibrium 
equations. To complete the elastostatic analysis of an overconstrained PM, as many 
supplementary equations as overconstraints must be introduced. The detailed process 
for this is given below. 
The equilibrium equation of the mobile platform can be obtained using the 
following equation, defined in the fixed coordinate system: 
W = ( J1 J2 ··· Jn ) f = GF 
f f , (5.39) 
where Ji = [$r 
i1 $r 
i2 $r 
i3], GF 
f = [ J1 J2 J3], f = [ f 1 f 2 f 3]
T , W = [F M] is 
an external wrench acting on the mobile platform, and $r 
ij is a unit screw of the jth 
constraint force that the ith limb exerts on the mobile platform. 
The VW principle of rigid bodies yields 
W T D = [ f 1 f 2 f 2 ]
T [δ1 δ2 δ3] = f T 
1 δ1 + f T 
2 δ2 + f T 
3 δ3. (5.40) 
Transposing Eq. (5.39) and then post-multiplying by D on both sides, we have 
W T D = f T 
1 J T 
1 D + ··· + f T 
n J T 
n D. (5.41) 
Equations (5.40) and (5.41) lead to 
δi=J T 
i D (i = 1, 2, 3). (5.42) 
where D is the infinitesimal twist of the geometric center point of the mobile platform. 
Equation (5.42) represents the DCEs between the elastic deformation of the ith5.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 155
limb end along the axis of the constraint wrenches and the infinitesimal twist of the 
geometric center point of the mobile platform. 
After the DCEs are obtained from Eq. (5.42), according to material mechanics, 
we have 
f i=Ki δi . (5.43) 
Then, by substituting Eqs. (5.42) and (5.43) into Eq. (5.39), we have

Equation (5.45) is a general and relatively concise algebraic expression for the 
overall stiffness matrix. When the mechanism is far from the singular position, the 
stiffness matrix K is full rank, which means the stiffness matrix K is invertible. 
Equation (5.46) shows that the overall stiffness matrix K is a symmetric matrix 
whose symmetry is not affected by the coordinate system. In this chapter, we derive 
an algebraic expression for the overall stiffness matrix from the perspective of the 
strain energy and Castigliano’s second theorem. The model proposed in this chapter 
is universally applicable to overconstrained PMs and the expression is relatively 
concise. 
From Eq. (5.44), we have 
D=K −1 W . (5.47) 
Substituting Eqs. (5.42) and (5.47) into Eq. (5.43) gives

To verify the correctness and feasibility of the method presented in this chapter, 
finite element commercial software ANSYS was used to develop a unified FEA156 5 Elastostatic Stiffness Evaluation and Optimization of Parallel Manipulators
model. In this model, the material and structural parameters are given according 
to the parameters used in the theoretical model. The compliant limbs are modeled 
using the beam188 element based on Timoshenko beam theory, which can simulate 
the spatial composite elastic deformation of a beam. In this chapter, the joints are 
assumed to be rigid and connect the rigid mobile platform to the flexible limbs. 
This constraint ensures the deformation compatibility relations and allows force 
transmission between the two objects. The mpc184 element is used to define this 
constraint, which can model R joints, U joints, S joints, and rigid beams, among 
others. Two coincidence points are selected, one attached to the mobile platform and 
the other attached to the flexible limb [13]. For different joints, the settings of the 
mpc184 element are different. For different configurations and topologies, we simply 
change the coordinates of the vertexes of the PMs and the settings of the mpc184 
element in the command stream. The mobile platform is assumed to be rigid in this 
chapter, which is modeled by the rigid beam mpc184 element. 
The stiffness performance is related to the material, structural parameters, and 
configuration. Three examples are considered in this chapter. Physical and archi￾tectural parameter values of the 2UPR-RPU overconstrained PM are given first, 
followed by three positions, and then the length of the limbs is given according to 
the inverse kinematics. In the given applied external wrench, the deformation of the 
geometric center point of the mobile platform is considered. We suppose that the 
external wrenches are defined in the fixed coordinate frame {O} and are applied on 
the geometric center o. 
The physical and structural parameters of the 2UPR-RPU overconstrained PM 
are listed in Table 5.1, where R = R1 = R2 = R3, r = r1 = r2 = r3, and d denotes 
the diameter of the limb cross-section. 
Three configurations of the 2UPR-RPU overconstrained PM and the corre￾sponding external wrenches imposed on the mobile platform are considered, and 
the inverse kinematics are solved. The results are listed in Table 5.2, where h =
Oo. For the three examples, the FEA simulation models with both deformed and 
un-deformed shapes of the 2UPR-RPU overconstrained PM can be found in Ref. 
[11].
The results based on the FEA model and the theoretical model are given in Table 
5.3. The results in Table 5.3 show that the relative error is within 0.8%. The results 
obtained using the theoretical model agree well with those obtained by the FEA 
model, verifying that the theoretical model presented in this chapter is acceptable for 
stiffness analysis.

5.2.2 Stiffness Performance Optimization 
This section adopts the comprehensive stiffness index as the optimization objective. 
Since the manipulator has different stiffness performance in different directions and 
bears different loads in different machining modes, so it is impossible to describe the 
stiffness performance of the mechanism by the stiffness performance of one or several 
specific directions. In more cases, engineers pay more attention to the linear stiffness158 5 Elastostatic Stiffness Evaluation and Optimization of Parallel Manipulators
performance of the mechanism resistance of force load. Without loss of generality, 
this section mainly evaluates the linear stiffness performance Kzf of the mechanism 
against external forces along the Z-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. 
The mathematical model of stiffness performance optimization of the 2UPR-RPU 
PM can be expressed as follows: 
objective function : f (x) = Kzf 
design variables: x = [r1 r2 r3]
constraint: |αi1|max , |αi2|max ≤ 50◦
0.3m ≤ li ≤ 1.0m 
0.3m ≤ r1 , r2 ≤ 0.6m , 0.2m ≤ r3 ≤ r1 
(5.50) 
Step size of the design parameters is set as 0.01 m, and the slice distribution of 
the Kzf in the complete parameter space is shown in Fig. 5.5. The maximum value 
of the objective function is obtained as follows: Kzf min = 4.657 × 108 N/m, Kzf max 
= 9.940 × 108 N/m. 
In this section, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) 
algorithm are adopted to optimize the stiffness performance of the 2UPR-RPU PM. 
The parameter settings of GA and PSO algorithm are given in Tables 5.4 and 5.5, 
respectively. The iteration graphs of GA and PSO algorithm are shown in Fig. 5.6a, 
b, respectively. The results of Kzf before and after optimization are given in Table 
5.6. The error of the results calculated by the three algorithms does not exceed 0.3%, 
which shows the effectiveness and feasibility of the optimization results. Compared 
with the results of before optimization, the stiffness performance after optimization 
of the 2UPR-RPU PM was greatly improved. The results show that compared with 
GA, PSO algorithm obtained better results with fewer iterations, and the stiffness 
performance was improved by 47.93% compared with before optimization.

A Methodology for Optimal Stiffness 
Design of Parallel Manipulators Based 
on the Characteristic Size 
It is important to design the optimal structural size ratio for the stiffness performance 
of parallel manipulators (PMs), so that the mechanism can be scaled according to 
the engineering environment requirements for the stiffness performance to design 
different specifications. This chapter presents a methodology for optimal stiffness 
performance design of PMs based on the characteristic size. The dimensional and 
sectional parameters of the mechanism can be expressed as the function of the char￾acteristic size and non-dimensional scale factors. The 2UPR-RPU and 2PRU-PSR 
PMs were taken as two examples for analysis and discussion. The influence of the 
scaling of elasticity modulus and characteristic size on the stiffness performance of 
PMs is investigated. 
6.1 Methodology for the Optimal Stiffness Performance 
Design of PMs 
The assumptions of the stiffness modeling for the proposed stiffness performance 
optimization design method of PMs are given as following: (1) The limbs are modeled 
by rods, the deformation of rods satisfy Hooke’s law, that is, in the linear elastic 
range; (2) all rods are made of the same material; (3) the base and moving platform 
are assumed to be rigid because they are much stiffer than the rod; (4) flexibility, fric￾tion, and clearance of joint are ignored; (5) the effect of gravity is ignored, wherein, 
assumptions (1)–(4) are reasonable for the stiffness analysis of PMs, while assump￾tions (5) and (6) are to better present the stiffness design method introduced in this 
paper. 
The overall stiffness matrix [1] can be expressed as follows:

where K is the overall stiffness matrix, Ji is the constraint screw system of the ith 
limb, and Ki is the stiffness matrix of the ith limb. 
So far, researchers have proposed many stiffness performance indices, such as 
determinant index [2], trace index, eigenvalue index [3], condition number index [4], 
and extreme stiffness index [5], etc. However, how to use these indices to design a 
group of mechanisms with similar stiffness performance is always a challenge for 
PM stiffness design. In this chapter, the characteristic size of the mechanism is firstly 
defined, and then the proportional factor between structure parameters and the char￾acteristic size of the mechanism is defined as non-dimensional design parameters. 
Theoretically, a reasonable stiffness performance index not only meets the definite 
physical meaning, but also meets the requirement that the corresponding structure 
size ratio of the optimal stiffness performance of the mechanism under different char￾acteristic sizes should be consistent, that is to say, the stiffness performance of the 
mechanism under different characteristic sizes is similar. Therefore, one can scale 
the characteristic size of the mechanism to design the mechanism size that meets the 
stiffness performance requirements of the engineering environment. 
The first and foremost for the optimal stiffness performance design of PMs is 
to design a set of non-dimensional design parameters. In this chapter, the distance 
between the base and the moving platform at the initial installation position is defined 
as the characteristic size h, the design parameters of the mechanism is defined by 
x∗ = [a1,..., am, ε1,...,εn], (6.2) 
where x* is the non-dimensional design parameters, ai (i = 1, 2, … m) is the ratio 
between the structure parameters consist of moving platform size, base size, and rod 
length, and the characteristic size h; εi is the length-to-diameter ratio, namely the 
ration of rod length and rod diameter. 
Stiffness optimization design is to identify the optimal geometry arrangement 
consists of finding the array x* 
opt that maximizes the objective optimization F. Here, 
F represents the stiffness index attained based on the overall stiffness matrix K. 
The limb stiffness matrix is generally obtained by inverting the compliance matrix 
Ci that is the function of elasticity modulus E, shear modulus G, rod diameter di, and 
rod length Li. According to the definition in Eq. (6.2) and E = G 
2(1+μ), the limb stiff￾ness matrix C∗
i based on the non-dimensional design parameters and characteristic 
size can be rewritten as 
C∗
i = εi 
Ehci (a1,..., am)
N∗
i (εi , h, a1,..., am), (6.3) 
where ci (·) denotes coefficient ci is the function of argument (·), N∗
i (·) represents 
that matrix N∗
i is the function of argument (·). 
It should be noted that the flexibility matrix C∗
i can be decomposed into two parts: 
matrix external variables and matrix internal variables. The former includes E, h, εi, 
a1, …, am, and the latter includes h, εi, a1, …, am. The elasticity modulus achieves6.2 Example 1: Optimal Stiffness Performance Design of the 2UPR-RPU PM 163
the decoupling from the compliance matrix, while h cannot be separated from the 
compliance matrix. 
Since the constraint screw system Ji is the function of the non-dimensional design 
parameters and characteristic size, thus, the overall stiffness matrix K can be rewritten 
as 
K∗ = EhΩ∗
(ε1,...,εn, a1,..., am, h), (6.4) 
where Ω∗
(·) denotes that matrix Ω∗ is the function of argument (·). 
Similarly, K* also consists of two parts, the external variables and the internal 
variables of the matrix, the former includes E and h, and the latter includes am, ε1, 
…, εn, h. 
According to Eqs. (6.3) and (6.4), the following conclusions can be drawn: 
(1) The elasticity modulus is decoupled from the overall stiffness matrix, and its 
influence on the stiffness performance of the mechanism varies with the stiffness 
evaluation index, e.g., it presents an exponential influence on the determinant 
index and a linear influence on the eigenvalue index. 
(2) The stiffness performance of the mechanism increases with the increase of the 
elasticity modulus and decreases with the length-to-diameter ratio. 
(3) It is worth noting that for a mechanism composed of the UPS/SPS limb with 
equal cross-section, such as the 6SPS PM, the limb stiffness matrix Ki = EA/Li, 
where E, εi, a1, h can be decoupled from the limb stiffness matrix. It can be seen 
from Eq. (6.1) that the first three rows and the first three columns of the overall 
stiffness matrix are independent of the characteristic size, that is to say, in this 
case, the optimal stiffness performance design of the mechanism for the linear 
displacement stiffness performance under the force load is decoupled from the 
characteristic size. 
(4) In general, it is difficult to decouple the characteristic size from the overall 
stiffness matrix, and its influence on the stiffness performance of the mechanism 
should be determined in combination with numerical simulation. 
Next, this paper introduces the stiffness performance design method of the mecha￾nism in detail through two examples of three degree-of-freedom (DOF) asymmetrical 
PM and identifies the suitable performance evaluation index for the optimal stiffness 
performance design of the mechanism. Finally, a group of similar mechanisms with 
the same optimal structural size ratio are designed. 
6.2 Example 1: Optimal Stiffness Performance Design 
of the 2UPR-RPU PM 
Figure 6.1 shows a 3-DOF 2UPR-RPU PM, which is made up of a fixed base, a 
moving platform, two extensible UPR limbs, and one RPU limb. The upper end of 
each UPR limb is connected to the fixed base by a universal joint, while the lower164 6 A Methodology for Optimal Stiffness Design of Parallel Manipulators …

end is connected to the moving platform by a revolute joint. The upper end of the 
RPU limb is connected to the fixed base by a revolute joint, while the lower end 
is connected to the moving platform by a universal joint. The mechanism motion 
is obtained by moving the three translational motors. Two Cartesian coordinates, 
O(X, Y, Z) and o(x, y, z), are, respectively, attached to the fixed base and moving 
platform. The origin of the (X, Y, Z) is located at the midpoint of the line B1B2, X￾and Y-axes along the direction of OB2 and OB3, respectively. The origin of frame (x, 
y, z) is located at the midpoint of A1A2, x- and y-axes along the direction of oA2 and 
oA3, respectively. The location of the moving platform relative to the fixed base is 
described by the position vector p and a rotation matrix R. The 2UPR-RPU PM has 
three DOFs, namely a translation along the Oo, a rotation γ about the y-axis, and a 
rotation β about the X-axis. OB1 = OB2 = r1, OB3 = r2, oA1 = oA2 = r3, oA3 = r4 
= r2r3/r1. The inverse kinematics of this mechanism can be found in [6]. 
Consider the distance between the base and moving platform at the initial position 
as the characteristic size, the geometrical parameters of the 2UPR-RPU PM is defined

In order to limit the ratio of the overall size to the characteristic size of the 
mechanism, without loss of generality, the inequality constraint equation for the

So far, all structural parameters of the mechanism are expressed as functions of

The elastostatic modeling based on the screw theory is adopted in this work to 
establish the overall stiffness matrix. The process is briefly reviewed below.

Finally, the overall stiffness matrix can be obtained by Eq. (6.1). 
Equations (6.11–6.12) show that the characteristic size h cannot be completely 
separated from the limb compliance matrix, and it exhibits a coupling relationship 
with the overall stiffness matrix. It is difficult to conclude from the analytical expres￾sion whether the same optimal design parameters exist under different characteristic 
sizes. Without loss of generality, this paper will select the determinant index, trace 
index, condition number index, eigenvalue index, and the extreme linear displace￾ment index under the action of force load with a clear physical explanation to carry 
out the stiffness performance optimization design analysis. The influence of the 
characteristic size on the optimal design parameters and stiffness performance of the 
mechanism is investigated, including identification of suitable indices for stiffness 
performance design. 
Since the 2UPR-RPU PM is unilateral symmetric mechanism, the optimum 
length-to-diameter ratio of UPR link and RPU link may be different under the 
constraint of equal mass, as a result, it is necessary to redesign its slenderness ratio. 
Considering that the link slenderness ratio of the mechanism before optimization is 
ε0 = 9, the mass constraint equation of the mechanism is defined as follows: 
m = m0, (6.13) 
where m = 2ρL10 A2

where the stiffness index is the average value of the node function values in the 
h-plane [β, γ ]–[− 10°, 10°] interval. 
In order to study the influence of the characteristic size of the mechanism on the 
optimal design parameters of the stiffness performance and identify which indices 
suitable for the stiffness performance design, 30 groups of data from the interval 0.1– 
5 m for characteristic size h were uniformly generated to carry out stiffness optimiza￾tion design, respectively. Table 6.1 shows the representative optimal non-dimensional 
design parameters for multiple stiffness performance indices of the 2UPR-RPU PM 
under seven characteristic factors. The results show that the robustness of the trace 
index, condition number index, and eigenvalue index are poor, that is to say, the 
optimal structure size ratio of the mechanism is different for different characteristic 
sizes. Obviously, it is not conducive to the stiffness performance design of the mech￾anism. The main reason is that these indices have vague physical meaning due to the 
non-uniform dimension of the overall stiffness matrix or do not consider the influ￾ence of all elements in the overall stiffness matrix, e.g., the condition number index 
and eigenvalue index only consider the eigenvalues of the overall stiffness matrix, 
and the trace index only the diagonal elements of the matrix are considered. The 
extreme linear displacement stiffness index and linear displacement homogeneous 
index under force load [5], as well as the determinant index show strong robust￾ness, that is to say, these indices are suitable for similar stiffness performance design 
of PMs. It is worth noting that the determinant index takes into account the influ￾ence of all the elements of the overall stiffness matrix and shows the comprehensive 
performance of the mechanism. Although it shows strong robustness in the stiff￾ness performance design, it is not recommended to be used for the optimal stiffness 
performance design of the mechanism due to its unclear clear physical meaning.
Figure 6.2 shows the influence curve of elasticity modulus on the extreme linear 
displacement stiffness performance and linear displacement homogeneous perfor￾mance under the condition of characteristic size h = 1 m (these influence curves for 
different characteristic sizes are similar). The elasticity modulus is linearly related 
to the linear displacement stiffness performance, and one can design a mechanism 
that meets the stiffness performance requirements in the engineering environment 
by adjusting the elasticity modulus of the material, e.g., a material with an elasticity168 6 A Methodology for Optimal Stiffness Design of Parallel Manipulators …

modulus of 140 GPa can be selected to achieve a minimum linear displacement stiff￾ness of 1 × 107 N/m. Figure 6.2c is approximately a straight line (fluctuations are 
caused by calculation errors), indicating that the linear displacement homogeneous 
performance of the mechanism is independent of the elasticity modulus of the mate￾rial, which is consistent with the theoretical results in Eq. (6.4). The analysis results is 
conducive to the stiffness performance design of PMs. Figure 6.3 shows the influence 
curve of the characteristic size on the stiffness performance of the mechanism while 
keeping the elasticity modulus E = 200 GPa unchanged (these influence curves for 
different elasticity modulus are similar). It is worth noting that the characteristic size 
of the 2UPR-RPU PM is also linearly related to the extreme linear displacement 
stiffness performance of the mechanism. One can adjust the characteristic size of the 
mechanism to design the size of the mechanism that meets the engineering require￾ments for stiffness performance, e.g., the characteristic size of the mechanism can 
be designed as h = 2 m to make the minimum linear displacement stiffness perfor￾mance of the mechanism reach kdf min = 2.9 × 107 N/m. Similarly, the scaling of the 
mechanism characteristic size does not affect the linear displacement homogeneous 
index of the mechanism.
It is worth noting that the optimal structure size proportions of the mechanism 
corresponding to kdf min and kdf max are different, while those corresponding to kdf min 
and δ are the same, indicating that the linear displacement homogenous performance 
of the 2UPR-RPU PM is mainly controlled by the minimum linear displacement6.2 Example 1: Optimal Stiffness Performance Design of the 2UPR-RPU PM 169

the minimum, maximum, and homogeneous linear displacement stiffness perfor￾mance of the 2UPR-RPU PM are all improved, especially the linear displacement 
homogeneous index, which is 6 times higher than that of before optimization. The

6.3 Example 2: Optimal Stiffness Performance Design 
of the 2PRU-PSR PM 
Figure 6.5 shows a 3-DOF 2PRU-PSR PM, the moving platform connected to the 
three sliders by two PRU limbs and one PSR limb. The one end of each PRU limb 
is connected to the slider by a revolute joint, while the other end is connected to 
the moving platform by a universal joint, wherein the R joints perpendicular to the 
sliders and parallel to the x-axis, the first axes of two U joints parallel to the R-joint 
axis at the other end, and the second axes collinear. The one end of the PSR limb 
is connected to the slider by a spherical joint, while the other end is connected to 
the moving platform by a revolute joint, wherein the R-joint axis parallel to second 
axis of U joints in PRU limbs. The mechanism motion is obtained by moving the 
three translational motors mounted on the three sliders. The location of the moving 
platform relative to the fixed base is described by the position vector p and a rotation 
matrix R. The 2PRU-PSR PM has three DOFs, namely a translation along the z-axis, 
a rotation α about the line that pass point A3 and parallel to the x-axis, a rotation β
about the v-axis. OC1 = OC2 = r1, OC3 = r2, oB1 = oB2 = r3, oB3 = r4 = r2r3/r1, 
A1B1 = A2B2 = L1, and A3B. = L2. The inverse kinematics of this mechanism can 
be found in [7]. 
Consider the distance between Ai and the moving platform as the characteristic 
size h, the geometric parameters of the mechanism can be expressed based on the 
characteristic size as

r1 = a1h; r2 = a2h; r3 = a3h; r4 = a4h 
L1 = a5h; L2 = a6h . (6.16) 
It should be noted that the links length are not independent. Once the characteristic 
size and the radius of the platform and base are specified, the links length are also 
uniquely determined. Therefore, the following equality constraints should be satisfied
{
a5 = /

a6 = /

. (6.17) 
As in Example 1, the constraint that the total mass is equal is applied to the rods, 
considering the cross-section of rods are circular, and the initial slenderness ratio of 
the rods is ε0 = 9. The slenderness ratio of rods should satisfy the following equality

The inequality constraints for the overall size of the mechanism is given as follows: 
2a1 + a2 + 2a3 + a4 + 2a5 + a6 ≤ 7. (6.19) 
So far, all the structural parameters of the mechanism are expressed as functions 
of the characteristic size and non-dimensional scale factors. 
The elastostatic compliance matrix of the PSR limb obtained on the screw theory 
and strain energy can be expressed as follows [8]:

The elastostatic compliance matrices of PRU limbs refer to Eq. (6.12). The overall 
stiffness matrix can be established by Eq. (6.1). 
The mathematical modeling of stiffness optimization design of the 2PRU-PSR 
PM can thus be established as follows:172 6 A Methodology for Optimal Stiffness Design of Parallel Manipulators …

where stiffness index is the determinant index, condition number index, minimum 
eigenvalue index, trace index, extreme linear displacement index, or linear displace￾ment homogeneous index. These indices are obtained by averaging the function 
values of discrete nodes in the plane z = 1.5 h and [α, β,] ∈ [−10◦
, 10◦
]. 
Similarly, the characteristic size h is uniformly discretized into 30 sets of data in 
the intervals of h = 0.1–5 m to study the influence of the characteristic size on the 
optimal structure parameter ratio, so as to identify which index has strong robustness 
and is suitable for optimal stiffness performance design of the mechanism. Similar 
to the optimization results of the 2UPR-RPU PM, Table 6.2 shows that the optimal 
design parameters for the condition number index, minimum eigenvalue index, or 
trace index of the mechanism are inconsistent for different characteristic sizes, the 
robustness of these indices is poor, this further illustrates that these indices are not 
suitable for the optimal stiffness performance design of the mechanism due to its 
unclear physical meaning; the optimal design parameters for the determinant index, 
extreme linear displacement index, or linear displacement homogeneous index are 
consistent under different characteristic sizes, which illustrates the strong robustness 
of these indices again.
Figure 6.6 shows the influence curve of the elasticity modulus E on the extreme 
linear displacement stiffness performance and linear displacement homogeneous 
performance under characteristic size h = 0.5 m. The elasticity modulus is linearly 
related to the extreme linear displacement stiffness performance; there is a horizontal 
linear relationship between elasticity modulus and linear displacement homogeneous 
stiffness performance. This is consistent with the optimization results of the 2UPR￾RPU PM, which shows the strong robustness of the proposed stiffness design method.
Figure 6.7 shows the influence curve of the characteristic size h on the extreme 
linear displacement stiffness and linear displacement homogeneous performance 
under the elasticity modulus E = 180 GPa. The characteristic size is linearly related 
and horizontal linear related to the extreme linear displacement stiffness performance 
and linear displacement homogeneous performance, respectively, e.g., the charac￾teristic size of the mechanism can be designed as h = 1.9 m to make the maximum 
linear displacement stiffness performance of the mechanism reach kdf max = 9.219 ×
109 N/m.
The homogeneous index deviates greatly from the maximum linear displacement 
index but is close to the minimum linear displacement index, which indicates that6.3 Example 2: Optimal Stiffness Performance Design of the 2PRU-PSR PM 173

the homogeneous index is mainly affected by the minimum linear displacement 
stiffness performance. The design parameters of the 2PRU-PSR mechanism needs to 
make a trade-off between the maximum linear displacement and the minimum linear 
displacement stiffness performance according to the requirements of the engineering 
task. 
Taking the design parameters x = [0.751, 0.751, 0.150, 0.150, 1.166, 1.166, 9, 9] 
proposed in Ref. [7] as the structure parameters of the mechanism before optimiza￾tion, Fig. 6.8 shows the comparison of the stiffness performance of the 2PRU-PSR 
PM before and after optimization under the characteristic size h = 0.333 m and 
elasticity modulus E = 180 GPa. The extreme linear displacement performance and 
linear displacement homogeneous performance are all improved, which verifies the 
effectiveness of the proposed stiffness design method in this work. 
6.4 Summary 
This paper proposed a methodology for optimal stiffness performance design of 
PMs based on the characteristic size, in which the scale factors between the struc￾tural parameters and the characteristic size is used as the non-dimensional design 
parameters. From the perspective of whether the structure size ratio correspondingReferences 175
to the optimal stiffness performance of the mechanism is consistent, which stiffness 
performance indices are suitable for the optimal stiffness performance design of the 
mechanism and which indices are not applicable were identified. The influence of the 
characteristic size and elasticity modulus scaling on the stiffness performance of the 
mechanism was studied, which lays a foundation for determining the mechanism size 
that meets the engineering environment requirements on the stiffness performance. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the optimal structure size ratio for 
the stiffness performance optimization of PMs is presented. 
The numerical analysis for the optimal stiffness performance design of the 2UPR￾RPU and 2PRU-PSR PMs were taken as two examples to implement the proposed 
method. The results show that the robustness of the determinant index and linear 
displacement index under the action of force is strong, that is, the optimal design 
parameters of the mechanism are consistent even for different characteristic sizes, 
which is crucial for the optimal stiffness performance design of PMs; the eigenvalue 
index, trace index, and condition number index have poor robustness, that is, the 
optimum structure size ratio of the mechanism is inconsistent under different charac￾teristic sizes, which is not conducive to the optimal stiffness design of PMs. Since the 
physical explanation for the determinant index is unclear, the extreme linear displace￾ment index is recommended as the stiffness performance design index. The results 
showed that the elasticity modulus and characteristic size are linearly proportional 
to the linear displacement performance of the mechanism, but the linear displace￾ment homogeneous performance index is not affected by them. Compared with the 
structure size ratio of the mechanism in the literature, the stiffness performance 
of the mechanism obtained by the proposed method in this work was significantly 
improved. The method presented in this paper provides a new idea for the optimal 
stiffness performance design and size determination of PMs. In our future work, the 
decoupling of characteristic size and stiffness performance indices will be studied.

Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel 
Manipulators Using Game Algorithm 
In this chapter, we focus on a multi-objective optimization game algorithm 
(MOOGA) for parallel manipulators (PMs). First, the distributions of the objective 
functions in the complete parameter space are calculated and sorted by its importance. 
Second, game weighting factors and lower bound values are assigned to different 
objective functions according to the engineering requirements. Finally, after multiple 
rounds of gaming according to the weighting factors and lower bound values, the 
objective functions reach an optimal balance point and obtain a balance intersection 
subspace. In addition, a comprehensive stiffness index (CSI) is introduced, that takes 
the coupling of the non-diagonal elements into consideration. This index decouples 
the linear and angular stiffness and has definite physical dimensions as well as a 
clear physical meaning. A Lagrangian function is used to obtain the maximum and 
minimum stiffness at a given position along with their corresponding directions. 
The distributions of extreme stiffness and corresponding directions expressed using 
spherical coordinates, which are useful for trajectory planning, are introduced. To 
compare the difference between the CSI and the principal diagonal stiffness index 
(PDSI), a divergence index κ is introduced. 2UPR-RPU PM is taken as an examples 
here for analysis and discussion. 
7.1 Multi-objective Optimization Game Algorithm 
The goal of multi-objective optimization is to design reasonable geometric parame￾ters to achieve better multi-objective performance of a mechanism. The main tasks of 
PM designs are to obtain an excellent regular workspace, motion/force transmission 
performance, carrying capacity, and stiffness performance. Thus, the above types 
of performance can be considered as the objective functions to be optimized at the 
design stage. Generally, the mathematical model of the multi-objective optimization 
of PMs can be expressed as

The multi-objective optimization of a PM is a highly non-linear problem. In recent 
years, intelligent algorithms including genetic, PSO, simulated annealing, and ant 
colony algorithms have been widely used. However, the main problems with these 
algorithms are that they are time-consuming, convergence can be difficult, and the 
results often depend on the preferences given to the algorithm, which is challenging 
for engineers to understand. 
Game theory was established by the book Theory of Games and Economic 
Behavior, which was published in 1944 [1]. Today, game theory has been successfully 
applied to problems in various fields such as the allocation of economic benefits, labor 
markets, and social resources as well as round table negotiation [2–5]. In the MOOGA 
proposed in this chapter, the balance intersection subspace or optimal balance point 
is obtained through a multi-round game according to the game weighting factors of 
the objective functions. The balance intersection subspace and optimal balance point 
are different from the Pareto optimal set, which provides a set of non-dominated solu￾tions. Engineers can choose the optimal balance point or points in the balance inter￾section subspace as the geometric parameters. A flowchart of the proposed MOOGA 
is shown in Fig. 7.1.
The detailed steps are as follows: 
Step 1: Evaluate the objective functions. Calculate the distribution of each objective 
function in the complete parameter space and express it using graphs or tables to 
prepare for the optimization, which is called pre-processing. This step is the most 
critical and time-consuming. The step sizes of the design variables can be deter￾mined according to the engineering requirements. The main disadvantage of this 
pre-processing is that it is time-consuming. However, points in the complete param￾eter space can be allocated to different servers or computers for calculation and then 
summarized centrally. Hence, this problem can be solved efficiently. 
Step 2: Prepare the game. Assign weighting factors to each objective function in the 
game. Higher values of weighting factor indicate more important objective functions. 
Simultaneously, determine the lower bound value for each objective function, that7.1 Multi-objective Optimization Game Algorithm 179
Fig. 7.1 Flowchart of the MOOGA
is, in the process of the game, the constraint ensures that each objective function is 
greater than or equal to its own lower bound. 
Step 3: Play the multi-objective game. In this step, each objective function plays the 
game according to its weighting factor. The results, which are the optimal balance 
point and balance intersection subspace that satisfy the multiple objectives, can be 
obtained after multiple rounds of gaming. If there is no intersection subspace for the 
objectives after multiple rounds of games, return to step 2 to redesign the weighting 
factors or lower bound values until an intersection is generated. 
Step 4: Select the optimized design variables. The optimal balance point or an appro￾priate point from the balance intersection subspace is selected as the final geometric 
parameter according to the results of the last game. 
A schematic diagram of the MOOGA is shown in Fig. 7.2. Different colors repre￾sent different objective functions. The numbers 1, i, and n represent the number of 
iterations of the game. Without loss of generality, Fig. 7.2 shows a game with four 
objectives. The size of the circle of each function represents the size of the parameter180 7 Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel Manipulators Using Game …

of MOOGA 
set that satisfies the requirements during the game. As shown in Fig. 7.2, each objec￾tive function is located at its own optimal position in the first game; however, there 
is no overlap among the multiple objectives at this time. To obtain results that satisfy 
multiple objective functions, each objective function plays the game based on its 
respective weighting factor. Each objective makes concessions to reach the optimal 
balance point. In the process of the game, the acceptable parameter space of each 
objective is gradually increased. The optimal balance point of the multi-objective 
game is finally reached after multiple rounds of games. 
The main advantages of a MOOGA are that it can be calculated using distributed 
computing, analyze big data, and perform discontinuous optimization. The pre￾processing is critical and time-consuming because it directly affects the reliability 
of the data analysis and optimization results. However, the discrete points can be 
allocated to different computers for calculation. The different optimization objec￾tives need to be optimized separately using traditional optimization methods. For 
the MOOGA, once the data of the discrete points are obtained, we can obtain the 
optimal solution quickly using big data analysis. Discontinuous optimization is diffi￾cult for traditional optimization methods. In contrast, in the game optimization, we 
can set the step size of the design parameters according to engineering requirements 
and use design parameters that include both integer and non-integer values, which is 
sometimes very useful for engineering problems.

7.2.1 Regular Workspace Volume 
The shape and size of the workspace have an important impact on the engineering 
application. It is necessary to study the reachable workspace before studying the 
regular workspace. The reachable workspace contains the points that the moving 
platform can reach from at least one direction under the physical constraints of the 
mechanism. The physical constraints include the stroke of the actuator and angular 
limit of the passive joints. Carbone et al. [6] obtained a numerical expression of the 
volume of the reachable workspace using a binary method. The shape and size of the 
reachable workspace are irregular, which is not conducive to the trajectory planning 
and algorithm control. In practical engineering applications, the regular workspace 
is generally adopted. Babu et al. [7] obtained the expression of the volume of the 
maximum inscribed cylinder of the regular workspace using the polar coordinate 
method. Bounab [8] calculated the volume of the regular sphere workspace of the 
Delta PM. The polar coordinate method is adopted in this chapter. First, the shape and 
size of the reachable workspace are obtained using the space search method before 
calculating the regular workspace. Then, the operating platform height is divided into 
n equal layers and the maximum inscribed circle radius at each layer is calculated. 
A schematic diagram and the flowchart of the calculation of the maximum inscribed 
circle radius for each layer are shown in Fig. 7.3. We can calculate the volume of the 
regular cylinder or frustum of a cone after obtaining the maximum inscribed circle 
radius at each layer. To quantify the volume of the regular workspace, the volume of 
the regular cylinder can be defined as 
Vr = πρ2 h, (7.3) 
where Vr is the volume of the regular workspace, ρ is the radius of the bottom circle, 
and h is the height of the cylinder. Note that Eq. (7.3) can calculate both the position 
and orientation workspace, that is, the units of ρ can be both m and rad.
Fig. 7.3 Calculation of the maximum inscribed circle radius using the polar coordinate method: a 
schematic diagram and b flowchart 182 7 Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel Manipulators Using Game …
Similarly, the volume of the frustum of a cone can be obtained using numerical 
methods as follows: 
Vr = Σn−1
i=1 
1 
2 
(Ai + Ai+1) ∗ Δz, (7.4) 
where Ai denotes the area of the maximum inscribed circle at each layer and Δz 
denotes the height interval. 
The physical constraints of the 2UPR-RPU PM include the strokes of the prismatic 
pairs and angular range of the passive joints. The range of the strokes can be expressed 
as 
lmin ≤ li ≤ lmax (i = 1, 2, 3), (7.5) 
where li is the stroke, and lmin = 0.3 m and lmax = 1.0 m are the maximum and 
minimum strokes, respectively. 
The limit of the angle range of the R joints are given by
{
αi1 = cos−1 (nli · npi ) or αi1 = cos−1 (nli · nbi )
|αi1|max ≤ 50◦ (i = 1, 2, 3) (7.6) 
where nli is the unit vector along the direction of the ith limb, and npi and nbi are the 
unit vectors perpendicular to the moving platform and base, respectively. In addition, 
αi1 denotes the angle between nli and npi or nli and nbi. 
The limits of the angle range of the U joints are given by
{
αi2 = cos−1 (nli · nbi) or αi2 = cos−1 (nli · npi )
|αi2|max ≤ 50◦ (i = 1, 2, 3). (7.7) 
where r1 = r2 = 0.39 m and r3 = r4 = 0.26 m are the initial geometric parameters 
before optimization [9, 10]. In this chapter, the space search method is used to obtain 
the discrete workspace of the 2UPR-RPU PM as shown in Fig. 7.4a. The reachable 
workspace is symmetric about γ = 0, which is consistent with the structure of the 
2UPR-RPU PM. Without loss of generality, the maximum inscribed cylinder with a 
given moving platform height of 500–800 mm is adopted as the regular workspace 
of the 2UPR-RPU PM in this study. The radius of the bottom circle of the regular 
cylindrical workspace can be calculated using the method shown in Fig. 7.3, and 
the volume can be calculated by Eq. (7.3). Without loss of generality, to ensure the 
reference point of the end effector can be reached with the desired orientation, the 
minimum radius of the cylindrical section is set to 10°.7.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 183

7.2.2 Motion/Force Transmissibility 
The main disadvantages of Jacobian matrix-based kinematic indices [6–8, 11] are that 
it is related to the coordinate frame and the non-uniform dimensions. In this chapter, 
the motion/force transmission index proposed by Liu et al. [12, 13] is adopted as 
a performance evaluation index; it measures the efficiency of the mechanism from 
input to output. This index is frame-free and relative to the singularity. 
As shown in Fig. 5.1, the twist screws $i = ($i1, $i2, $i3, $i4) and constraint 
wrenches of each limb can be obtained using screw theory (details can be found in 
[9, 10]). Considering the first limb as an example, the reciprocal product between 
TWS NT1 and the twist screws of the passive joints are set equal to zero, as follows: 
NT1 ◦ $1i = 0 i = 1, 2, 3. (7.8) 
The expression of NT1 can be obtained by 
NT1 = (B1 A1/|B1 A1|; oA1 × B1 A1/|B1 A1|), (7.9) 
where NT1 denotes the wrench screw passing through point A1 in the direction of 
B1A1. 
Because the actuator joint of the first limb is a P pair, the ITS $A1 can be expressed 
as 
$A1 = $13 = (0, 0, 0; B1 A1/|B1 A1|). (7.10) 
Similarly, the TWSs and unit ITSs of the other two limbs can be obtained as
{
NT2 = (B2 A2/|B2 A2|; oA2 × B2 A2/|B2 A2|)
NT3 = (B3 A3/|B3 A3|; oA3 × B3 A3/|B3 A3|)
, (7.11)184 7 Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel Manipulators Using Game …
and
{
$A2 = $23 = (0, 0, 0; B2 A2/|B2 A2|)
$A3 = $33 = (0, 0, 0; B3 A3/|B3 A3|)
, (7.12) 
where NT2 denotes the wrench screw passing through point A2 in the direction of 
B2A2 and NT3 denotes the wrench screw passing through point A3 and along the 
direction of B3A3. 
Substituting Eqs. (7.9) and (7.10) into Eq. (4.10) obtains 
λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = 1. (7.13) 
Locking all actuator joints except the first limb, the TWSs of the other two limbs 
are transformed into constraint wrenches. Now, the new wrench system acting on 
the moving platform after locking the other two limbs can be obtained as 
U1 = [$r 
1, $r 
2, $r 
3, NT2, NT3] (7.14) 
The dimension of matrix U1 is 5 and the instantaneous 1-DOF twist of the moving 
platform is denoted by unit OTS $O1. In this case, only NT1 can contribute to the 
moving platform, whereas NT2 and NT3 apply no work to the moving platform, 
expressed as follows: 
$O1 ◦ U1 = 0. (7.15) 
ITSs $O2 and $O3 can be found in the same manner; the LTI can be obtained using 
Eq. (4.11). 
LTI only represents the motion/force transmission performance of a mechanism 
under a given configuration. To evaluate the performance of the mechanism over the 
entire prescribed workspace, the global transmission index (GTI) is defined. Discrete 
points are often used for calculation as follows: 
GTI =
{
Vr ςdVr {
dVr 
or GTI = 1 
n 
Σn
i=1 
ςi , (7.16) 
where n denotes the number of discrete points in the prescribed workspace. A higher 
value of the GTI indicates a better motion/force transmission performance. 
7.2.3 Stiffness Performance Evaluation 
In this chapter, the CSI is adopted as the stiffness performance evaluation index. 
Because the stiffness performance of the mechanism is related to the direction of7.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 185
external loading, and the mechanism is subjected to different load directions in 
different processing modes. In most cases, engineers pay more attention to the linear 
stiffness performance of the mechanism for a force. To make the stiffness perfor￾mance of different mechanisms comparable, here Kxf , Kyf , and Kzf are considered 
as stiffness performance evaluation indices. Indices Kxf , Kyf , and Kzf are linear stiff￾ness indices indicating the mechanism’s resistance to a unit force in directions x, y, 
and z, which is a reciprocal of the corresponding compliance indices. 
To more intuitively observe the influence of the CSI proposed in this chapter on 
the stiffness performance of the mechanism, the PDSI is selected as a comparative 
object to study the difference between the two. Generally, the stiffness matrix can be 
expressed as 
K =

⎥

⎥

⎥

⎥
⎦
. (7.17) 
The PDSI uses the principal diagonal elements of the stiffness matrix as an indi￾cator of stiffness performance and the non-diagonal elements are ignored, which is 
expressed as follows
{k,
xf = k11, k,
yf = k22 , k,
zf = k33 (N/m)
k,
xm = k44, k,
ym = k55 , k,
zm = k66 (N/rad)
. (7.18) 
As Eq. (7.18) shows, the PDSI can only evaluate the stiffness performance along 
the axis of the reference coordinate system, and the effect of non-diagonal elements 
on the stiffness performance of the mechanism is ignored. The following equation 
defines the degree of difference between the CSI proposed in this chapter and the 
PDSI, which reflects the effect of non-diagonal elements on stiffness performance:

where κxf , κyf , and κzf denote the degree of difference in the linear CSI and PDSI 
stiffness indices along the x-, y-, and z-axis directions for an external force, respec￾tively; κxm, κym, and κzm denote the degree of difference in the angular CSI and 
PDSI stiffness indices along the x-, y-, and z-axis directions for an external moment, 
respectively.186 7 Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel Manipulators Using Game …
From Eq. (7.19), κ varies from zero to one. If the value of κ is equal to zero, this 
indicates that the CSI proposed in this chapter is the same as the PDSI. A smaller 
value of κ leads to a smaller reduction in the CSI with respect to the PDSI, and when 
these indices are closer in value, the coupling effect of the non-diagonal elements of 
the compliance matrix on stiffness performance is smaller. Likewise, a larger value of 
κ indicates a larger influence of the coupling effect of the non-diagonal compliance 
matrix elements on stiffness performance, and the two indices have a larger deviation. 
Note that the value of κ is less than one. 
If a general wrench w =

is exerted on a mechanism, according to 
the principle of small deformation superposition, the deflection of the mechanism is 
equal to the sum of the deflections of unit force nf and unit moment nm acting on 
the mechanism. To determine whether the mechanism is more sensitive to the force 
or moment, the sensitivity factor is defined as
Δst = δdf 
δdm 
, Δsr = δϕ f 
δϕm 
, (7.20) 
where Δst and Δsr represent the translational and rotational deflection sensitivity 
factors, respectively; δdf and δdm denote the translational deflections caused by the 
unit force and unit moment, respectively; and δϕf and δϕm denote the rotational 
deflection caused by the unit force and unit moment, respectively. To compare the 
sensitivity factor of different mechanisms, the directions of unit force and moment 
can each be assigned along the x-, y- and z-axes of a Cartesian coordinate system, 
respectively. If the sensitivity factor is equal to one, the deflection is equally sensitive 
to force and moment. If sensitivity factor is greater than one, the deflection is more 
sensitive to force and vice versa. 
7.2.4 Multi-objective Optimization 
The mathematical model of the multi-objective optimization design of the 2UPR￾RPU PM can be expressed as 
objective function : f1(x) = Vr , f2(x) = GTI 
f3(x) = Kxf , f4(x) = Kyf , f5(x) = Kzf 
design parameter : x = [r1 r2 r3]

0.3m ≤ li ≤ 1.0m 
0.3m ≤ r1 , r2 ≤ 0.6m , 0.2m ≤ r3 ≤ r1 (7.21) 
where Kxf , Kyf y, and Kzf denote the linear GCSI resistant of the force along the x-, 
y- and z-axes, respectively, which can be obtained by Eq. (5.26). Without loss of7.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 187
generality, the height z of the moving platform is known to be 500–800 mm. In this 
section, reasonable geometric parameters are redesigned to achieve multi-objective 
game optimization. Using the constraint conditions given by Eq. (7.21), slice graphs 
of the distribution of the objective functions in the complete parameter space can be 
obtained, as shown in Fig. 7.5.
Figure 7.5a shows that the value of the GTI is highly affected by r2 and less 
affected by r1 and r3. A large r2 leads to a large GTI. Figure 7.5d shows that the 
optimal values of Kyf are mainly distributed in the region with small r3 and large 
r1 and r2; that is, GTI and Kyf simultaneously achieve optimal values in the region 
where r3 is small and r1 and r2 are large. Figure 7.5b shows that workspace Vr reaches 
optimal values in the region where r2 is small and r1 and r3 are both large and small. 
Figure 7.5c shows that optimal stiffness Kxf is mainly distributed in the region where 
r2 is small and r1 and r3 are both large or small; that is, in this region, Vr and Kxf can 
simultaneously achieve optimal values, and there is an obvious intersection subspace 
between the two. Finally, Fig. 7.5e shows that Kzf achieves the optimal values in the 
region with large r2 and small r1 and r3. Figure 7.5a, d, e shows that Kyf and Kzf can 
obtain a relatively optimal intersection subspace in the region with large r2, small 
r3, and medium r1. It can be seen from Fig. 7.5a–e that it is impossible to obtain an 
intersection subspace for which all the objective functions are optimal. To obtain a 
value that satisfies multiple objectives, there must be a game among the parties in 
which one or more parties make a sacrifice. Engineers can assign different weighting 
factors to different objectives and determine the lower bound values according to 
the engineering requirements. A lower bound value may not be assigned when it is 
initially unknown. The design parameters can be determined according to the result 
of the game, whether or not they satisfy the engineering requirements. Figure 7.6 
shows the parameter subspace that corresponds to top 10% of the best values of 
each objective. The distribution is consistent with that of Fig. 7.5. It can be seen 
from Fig. 7.6 that there is an obvious intersection among the regions for Kyf , Kzf , 
and GTI. Additionally, there is also an obvious intersection between Vr and Kxf . 
To obtain a feasible region in which all the objective functions are satisfied, the 
performance requirements must be reduced for one or more objectives. For example, 
the performances for Vr and Kxf can be reduced to obtain a feasible intersection that 
satisfies all the objective requirements under the premise of ensuring the performance 
of Kyf , Kzf , and GTI.
7.2.4.1 Optimization of Three Objective Functions 
Considering the multi-objective optimization of GTI, Kyf , and Kzf as an example, 
reasonable geometric parameters are explored to maximize each objective as much 
as possible. In this chapter, a MOOGA is proposed to obtain a balance intersection 
subspace for multiple objectives as well as the optimal balance point of the game in 
the subspace; that is, all objectives must be compromised to obtain an intersection 
subspace. First, the values of the objective functions are sorted from maximum to188 7 Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel Manipulators Using Game …

minimum in the complete parameter space. Without loss of generality, three objec￾tives are considered equally important. That is ωKy: ωKz: ωGTI = 1/3: 1/3: 1/3, and 
each objective simultaneously compromises to obtain a balance intersection subspace 
for all three. Meanwhile, the lower bound values are set as follows: Ky0 = 8.7 ×
107 N/m, Kz0 = 8.6 × 108 N/m, and GTI = 0.735. Without loss of generality, r1, 
r2, and r3 are divided into 100 data points, namely the step size is 0.004 m. Each 
objective is calculated for a total of 1,030,301 points in the complete parameter 
space. The optimal balance point of the three objectives, [r1, r2, r3] = [0.452, 0.600, 
0.200], can be reached after multiple rounds of the game. At the optimal balance 
point, none of the three are at their maximum value, but reach a balance position. 
The multi-objective game stops when the lower bound value of 0.735 for the GTI is 
reached. Figure 7.7 shows the balance intersection subspace of the three, where all 
points meet the requirements. Here, Kyf , Kzf , and GTI create a balance intersection 
subspace that contains large r2, small r3, and medium r1. A comparison before and 
after optimization is given in Table 7.1. The optimized values of Kyf , Kzf , and GTI 
are significantly improved. At the optimal balance point, GTI, Kzf , and Kyf increased 
by 38.05%, 36.28%, and 100.85%, respectively, which indicates the effectiveness of 
the MOOGA proposed in this chapter (Fig. 7.7).

Table 7.2 gives the results of genetic algorithm and MOOGA for six weight combi￾nations, where the error represents the error of f CO between the genetic algorithm and 
proposed MOOGA. The calculation time of pre-processing phase for the MOOGA 
is 31,862.37 s on a desk computer with a 3.00 GHz CPU. This is the most time￾consuming phase for the MOOGA. Table 7.2 also shows that the error of the optimal 
solution is less than 1%, which is mainly caused by the use of discrete points in the 
MOOGA. The total calculation time for the six examples of the genetic algorithm is 
55,149 s. Only the results for the three objectives Kzf , Vr, and GTI are given in the 
Table 7.2; if other combinations of different objective functions and weighting factors 
are considered, the calculation time would substantially increase. The above analysis7.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 191

7.2.4.2 Optimization of Five Objective Functions 
The distribution of the objective functions in Fig. 7.5 shows that it is impossible to 
achieve a balanced intersection subspace in which Kxf , Kyf , Kzf , Vr, and GTI all 
have excellent values. Hence, there should be a game among them to improve the 
solution. To more intuitively express the volume of the regular cylindrical workspace, 
we convert it into the radius of the bottom circle represented by an angle, that is, the 
range of orientation of the moving platform: 
ρ =
/ Vr 
πh ·
180 
π
(deg). (7.24) 
Multiple schemes can be adopted to obtain the balance intersection subspace. For 
example, the performances for Vr and Kxf could be reduced while those of Kyf , Kzf , 
and GTI remain unchanged. In contrast, the performances for Kyf , Kzf , and GTI 
could be reduced while those of Vr and Kxf remain unchanged, or the performances 
of the five objective functions could all be reduced simultaneously. Without loss of 
generality, the ratios of the weighting factors are assigned as ωKz: ωGTI: ωKx: ωKy: 
ωVr: = 6/19: 4/19: 3/19: 3/19: 3/19; that is, Kzf is dominant in the process of the 
game. When Kzf takes a step back, GTI takes 1.5 steps back, and Kxf , Kyf , and Vr 
each take two steps back. Suppose the lower bound values of the objective functions 
are Kx0 = 9.682 × 106 N/m, Ky0 = 3.500 × 107 N/m, Kz0 = 7.371 × 108 N/m, ρ =192 7 Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel Manipulators Using Game …

15.000°, and GTI = 0.600. After multiple rounds of a game, we obtain the optimal 
balance point [r1, r2, r3] = [0.404, 0.452, 0.220]. Meanwhile, the game stops when 
the lower bound of Kxf is reached. The balance intersection subspace that meets the 
requirements of all the objective functions and the optimal balance point of the game 
are shown in Fig. 7.8. Table 7.3 shows the comparison before and after optimization. 
For the optimal balance point, the optimized Vr and Kxf are decreased by 12.18% 
and 6.23%, respectively, and Kyf , Kzf , and GTI are increased by 41.58%, 12.05%, 
and 13.60%, respectively. 
Annotation: The units of Kxf , Kyf , and Kzf are107 (N/m) and Vr is converted to

7.2.4.3 Distribution of Local Indices 
Without loss of generality, a set of geometric parameters is selected from the opti￾mized parameter sets as an example: [r1, r2, r3] = [0.45, 0.6, 0.2]. The slice graphs in 
Fig. 7.9 show the distribution of the local evaluation indices in the regular workspace.
It can be seen from Fig. 7.9 that each local index decreases with the increase 
in height of the moving platform, which is particularly noticeable for Kxf and Kyf . 
Figure 7.10 shows the distribution of the local indices in the plane z = 0.6 m. Each 
local index is symmetric about γ = 0, which is consistent with the symmetry of7.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 193
Fig. 7.9 Distribution of objective functions in the regular workspace: a kxf , b kyf , c kzf , and d LTI
the mechanism. Additionally, the rationality of the CSI proposed in this chapter 
is preliminarily verified. Figure 7.10c shows that the maximum kzf (the best stiff￾ness performance in the plane z = 0.6 m) occurs at the initial position and rapidly 
decreases as the orientation of the mechanism changes, that is, the position with the 
best stiffness performance produces the minimum deflection and the position with 
the worst stiffness performance produces the maximum deflection. Figure (a), (b), 
and (d) show that the maxima of kxf , kyf , and LTI are located around position (γ, β) 
= (0, 12°) rather the initial position (γ, β) = (0, 0), the minima of kxf , kyf , and LTI 
(the worst stiffness performance and motion/force transmissibility in the plane z =
0.6 m) are located around position (γ, β) = (0, −12°).
The divergence index κ between the CSI and the PDSI is discussed next. 
Figures 7.11 and 7.12 show the distributions of κ in the regular cylindrical workspace 
and plane z = 0.6 m, respectively. Because of limited space, only the distributions 
of κxf , κyf , and κzf are discussed in this chapter. It was found that κxf , κxf , and κzf 
are all symmetric about the plane γ = 0, which is also consistent with the symmetry 
of the mechanism. Note that in each plane, the maximum of κ is at the position with 
the worst stiffness rather than at the position with the best stiffness. For example,194 7 Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel Manipulators Using Game …
Fig. 7.10 Distribution of objective functions in the plane z = 0.6 m: a kxf , b kyf , c kzf , and d LTI
the maxima of κxf and κyf are at position (γ, β) = (0, −12°), which has the worst 
stiffness, rather than (γ, β) = (0, 12°), which has the best stiffness. The minimum 
of κzf is also at position (γ, β) = (0, 0), which has the best stiffness, is consis￾tent with Fig. 7.10 and verifies the rationality of the CSI again. It can be seen from 
Figs. 7.11 and 7.12 that the PDSI optimistically estimates the stiffness performance 
of the mechanism. Compared with the PDSI in the x, y, and z directions, the CSI is 
decreased by 98–99% in the x direction, 76–92% in the y direction, and 30–90% in 
the z direction. Furthermore, the effect of coupling cannot be ignored in the perfor￾mance evaluation of the true stiffness. It must be considered to evaluate the true 
stiffness of the mechanism.
The 2UPR-RPU PM is only symmetrical about one coordinate axis, so it is insuffi￾cient to determine the universality of the effect of coupling on stiffness performance. 
Therefore, we further discuss the effect of coupling on the stiffness performance of a 
mechanism symmetric about two axes. The stiffness model of the 2UPR-2RPU PM 
was described in detail in our previous work [9]. Figure 7.13 shows the distribution of 
κ for the 2UPR-2RPU PM in the regular cylindrical workspace, and Fig. 7.14 shows 
the distribution of κ in the plane z = 0.6 m. The distribution of κ is symmetric about7.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 195

κzf
both planes γ = 0 and β = 0, which is consistent with the symmetry of the mecha￾nism. The effect of coupling on the stiffness performance in the x and y directions 
is still significant. Coupling has no impact on the stiffness in the z direction only at 
position (γ, β) = (0, 0), where the maximum stiffness is in the z direction, which 
is consistent with the symmetry about the two axes of the mechanism. The effect 
of coupling on the stiffness performance in the z direction rapidly increases as the 
attitude angle changes. Thus, regardless of whether the mechanism is symmetric or 
asymmetric, the effect of coupling on the true stiffness performance of the mechanism 
is not negligible.
The above analysis discusses the linear stiffness for external forces along the 
x, y, and z directions. Next, Eqs. (5.18)–(5.20) are used to further determine the196 7 Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel Manipulators Using Game …

κzf
extreme values for the compliance of the mechanism and the corresponding direc￾tions. Because of limited space, we only discuss extreme compliance values for an 
external force. Tables 7.4 and 7.5 show the extreme compliance values and corre￾sponding directions at three positions. It was found that the 2UPR-2RPU PM has 
minimum linear and angular compliances along the direction of the z-axis, and 
maximum linear and angular compliances along the direction of the x-axis when the 
moving platform is at the central position. This is consistent with the symmetry of 
the mechanism. The minimum angular compliance is zero, that is, the angular defor￾mation is zero when an external force is applied along the z-axis, and the angular 
stiffness is infinite along the direction of the z-axis. Because the 2UPR-RPU PM is 
only symmetric about the β-axis, there is a deflection angle of 0.745° between the 
direction of the minimum compliance of the linear and angular displacements and 
the direction of the z-axis when the moving platform is at the central position. This 
is determined by the nature of the asymmetry about the two axes of the mechanism. 
The maximum linear and angular displacements are also along the direction of the 
x-axis. Tables 7.4 and 7.5 also show the extreme compliances and their corresponding 
directions for the 2UPR-RPU and 2UPR-2RPU PMs at two general positions, that 
is, z = −0.8, β = 14°, and γ = 14°, as well as z = −0.6, β = −10°, and γ =
17°. To obtain an intuitive distribution of the compliances under different directions 
of unit force, the 2UPR-2RPU PM is taken as an example and the distributions of 
the deflections of the three configurations corresponding to Table 7.5 under different 
unit force directions are given in Fig. 7.15. These results verify the correctness of 
the results obtained from Table 7.5.
Without loss of generality, Tables 7.6 and 7.7 show the extreme distributions 
and the directions of a 2UPR-2RPU PM for a general wrench in three configura￾tions. Because of the limited space, only the linear compliances extreme values are 
discussed here. It can be seen from Tables 7.6 and 7.7 that the results obtained from 
the genetic and PSO algorithms are basically consistent, which verifies the reliability 
of the results. The minimum compliances values in Table 7.6 obtained from the PSO 
algorithm is superior to that of the genetic algorithm, which shows the superiority of 
PSO with respect to global optimization. Table 7.6 shows for E#1, the directions of 
force and moment are close to the negative z- and x-axes, respectively, for E#2, the 
directions of force and moment are close to the positive z- and x-axes, respectively,7.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 197

and for E#3, the directions of force and moment are close to the positive x- and 
negative y-axes, respectively. Moreover, the results show that the minimum value of 
compliance is highly correlated with the configurations of the manipulator. Table 7.7 
shows that the directions of the forces and moments of the three examples are all 
close to the positive x- and y-axes, respectively, namely if a force and moment are 
simultaneously exerted on the mechanism, directions of the force and moment that 
are simultaneously close to the positive x- and y-axes should be avoided.

both Δst and Δsr along the x-axis are greater than one, that is, the translational and

caused by the moment. The maximum sensitivity factor is 0.025 in Fig. 7.16f, namely 
the rotational deflection is mainly caused by the moment. The sensitivity factors are 
related to the direction of the external wrench and configuration of the mechanism. 
If the force or moment exerted on the mechanism can be determined, we can specify 
a reasonable direction for the loading and configuration of the mechanism to control 
the translational and rotational deflection.
In practical engineering applications, extreme compliances and their corre￾sponding directions can be calculated in any position so as to avoid the direction of 
the maximum compliance to the greatest extent, improve the stiffness performance 
of the mechanism as much as possible and provide guidance for trajectory planning. 
Equations (5.18)–(5.20) give the analytical expressions for the extreme compliance 
values and their corresponding directions for external forces and moments. The 
extreme stiffness indices can be obtained by reciprocating the compliance indices.200 7 Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel Manipulators Using Game …

Because of space limitations, only the extreme linear stiffness indices of the 2UPR￾RPU and 2UPR-2RPU PMs for force are described here. To more intuitively express 
the direction of extreme stiffness, the cart2sph function of MATLAB software is 
used to convert the Cartesian coordinates into spherical coordinates. The schematic 
is shown in Fig. 7.17, where θ denotes the elevation angle measured unit vectors from 
the x-y plane. The value of the θ is in the range [−π/2, π/2]. In addition, φ denotes 
the azimuth angle, which is the counterclockwise angle in the x-y plane measured7.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 201
from the positive x-axis and is in the range [−π, π]. This notation for spherical 
coordinates is not standard. Note that if θ = 0, the point is in the x-y plane. If θ
= π/2, then the point is on the positive z-axis. Compared with Fig. 7.10, the value 
of kdmin of Fig. 7.18 is closer to kxf and less than kyf and kzf . The corresponding 
elevation angle θ is less than 3°, which is influenced by the configurations of the 
mechanism. The value of azimuth angle φ is divided into two parts, about 180° and 
2°, and the corresponding relationship between the configurations can be obtained 
from the graph. During the machining process, the direction of force corresponding 
to the minimum stiffness at a given configuration should be avoided to improve 
the machining accuracy. The maximum stiffness is in the range [4.39 4.44] × 109 
N/m. As the configurations changes, the value of maximum stiffness does not change 
much. The corresponding elevation angle is in the range [75° 90°], which is close 
to the z-axis. The azimuth angle exhibits a spiral surface distribution. In engineering 
applications, we can use the direction corresponding to the maximum stiffness to 
maximize processing accuracy. 
Figure 7.19 shows the distribution of extreme stiffness and corresponding direc￾tion for force of a 2UPR-2RPU PM. If the direction of force is along the z-axis, θ is 
equal to π/2, and the value of φ can be arbitrary, so the θ and φ corresponding to this 
direction (which corresponds to β = 0 and γ = 0) is not displayed. It can be seen from 
Fig. 7.19 that the distribution of the 2UPR-2RPU PM is similar to that of the 2UPR￾RPU PM. Compared with the results for the 2UPR-RPU PM, the minimum stiffness 
and maximum stiffness of the 2UPR-2RPU PM are greatly improved because of the 
addition of an RPU limb, the range of elevation angle corresponds to the minimum 
stiffness is reduced to [−2° 2°]. Moreover, the azimuth angle corresponding to the 
minimum stiffness is around 180°, and the value at 2° has disappeared. The above 
analysis shows that the extreme stiffness values and their corresponding directions 
can be obtained by mathematical operations on the compliance matrix. Hence, the 
best loading direction is in the direction corresponding to the maximum stiffness,

7.3 Summary 
A MOOGA, which is based on the game theory, was introduced in this chapter. 
The procedure of the algorithm was provided and performance evaluation indices 
including the volume of the regular cylindrical workspace, motion/force transmis￾sion efficiency, and stiffness performance were considered. The CSI was introduced 
and used as one of the objective functions for the subsequent multi-objective opti￾mization. The CSI takes into account the influence of non-diagonal elements in 
the compliance matrix on stiffness performance and more accurately evaluates the 
stiffness performance of a mechanism. The CSI has a clear physical meaning and 
defined dimensions and provides a new concept for the evaluation of the stiffness 
performance of PMs. The maximum and minimum of the stiffness and their corre￾sponding directions at a given position were obtained by constructing a Lagrangian 
function. To compare the difference between the CSI proposed in this chapter and 
the PDSI, divergence index κ was proposed. 
Using the 2UPR-RPU PM as an example, multi-objective optimization exam￾ples of three and five objectives were provided, and the optimal balance point and 
balance intersection subspace of the corresponding multi-objective optimizations 
were obtained. The comparative results of the performance evaluation indices before 
and after optimization demonstrate the effectiveness of the MOOGA. In addition to 
divergence index κ, one of the optimal balance points was used as an example to 
show the distribution of the local performance evaluation indices in the regular cylin￾drical workspace. The distribution of κ of the 2UPR-2RPU PM was also provided 
to further demonstrate the effect of coupling on the bilateral symmetric mechanism. 
The results show that the CSI values were up to 99% lower than those of the PDSI. 
Hence, the effect of coupling of the non-diagonal elements cannot be ignored when 
evaluating the true stiffness performance of the mechanism. 
The sensitivity factors along the x-, y-, and z-axes of the Cartesian coordinate 
system of the 2UPR-2RPU PM in the plane z = −0.6 m were also shown in this 
chapter. The results show that both the translational and rotational deflections are 
more sensitive to force in the x-axis direction and more sensitive to moment in the 
y- and z-axes directions. The extreme linear stiffness indices of the 2UPR-RPU and 
2UPR-2RPU PMs for force were presented. The results show that the angle between 
the directions corresponding to the minimum linear stiffness and the x-y plane is less 
than 3°, and the angle between the directions corresponding to the maximum linear 
stiffness and the x-y plane is in the range [75° 90°]. Because the 2UPR-2RPU PM has 
one more RPU limb than the 2UPR-RPU PM, the minimum and maximum linear 
stiffness values of the 2UPR-2RPU PM are greatly improved. In an engineering 
application, the best loading direction should follow the direction corresponding to 
the maximum stiffness, and the direction of the minimum stiffness should be avoided204 7 Multi-objective Optimization of Parallel Manipulators Using Game …
to maximize the machining accuracy. These results can assist trajectory planning. 
The minimum and maximum compliance values and directions for a general wrench 
of the 2UPR-2RPU PM at three positions were obtained using the genetic and PSO 
algorithms. The results show the superiority of PSO with respect to global opti￾mization. The extreme compliance values and their corresponding directions can be 
calculated at any position in an engineering application so as to avoid the direction 
of maximum compliance to the greatest extent, improve the stiffness performance of 
the mechanism as much as possible, and provide guidance for trajectory planning.

Hybrid Algorithm for Multi-objective 
Optimization Design of Parallel 
Manipulators 
Since the parallel manipulators (PMs) have excellent dynamic performance, high 
agility, high load-to-weight ratio, distributed joint error, and simple inverse kine￾matics [1, 2], scholars, and enterprises have studied and designed PMs with the 
engineering application value in the past two decades. The successful commercial 
applications of PMs include the Delta robot [3], Tricept robot [4], Sprint Z3 [5] 
spindle head, and Exechon robot [6]. Although having the market value in some 
fields, PMs are not as successful as industrial serial robots because of expensive 
equipment provides poor performances [7]. Multi-objective optimization design is 
crucial for issues to be addressed. 
With the increasing complexity of engineering design, sophisticated analysis and 
optimization tools are used to study optimization design. However, global perfor￾mance indices (GPIs) usually obtained by calculating the average or variance value of 
the local performance indices (LPIs) of limited discrete grid nodes in the workspace, 
and the accuracy is related to the node density in the workspace. As the node density 
increases, the computational cost increases exponentially. Also, the high-dimensional 
design leads to exponentially increased computational cost. 
In this chapter, we focus on the hybrid algorithm for the multi-objective optimiza￾tion design with high efficiency and low computational cost based on the Gaussian 
process regression and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The mapping 
modeling method based on the Gaussian process regression can significantly reduce 
the computational cost of the GPIs to improve the optimization design of the PMs. 
The comparison from the accuracy and robustness for back propagation neural 
network, multi-variate regression, and Gaussian process regression mapping models 
are discussed. Finally, the 2PRU-UPR PM is taken as an example here for the analysis 
and discussion.

8.1.1 Procedure of the Hybrid Algorithm 
The optimization design of the PM aims to find reasonable design parameters to 
optimize multi-objective performance. In general, the mathematical model of the 
multi-objective optimization design of PMs can be expressed as follows.

, (8.1) 
where Fi (x) and x denote the objective functions and design parameters, respectively; 
G(x) and H(x) the equality and inequality constraint functions, respectively. 
Since it is difficult to obtain the analytical expression for the regular workspace 
volume, the GPIs are usually obtained by the discrete numerical method, which is 
time-consuming and dramatically undermines the efficiency of multi-objective opti￾mization design. The work proposes an efficient optimization design method based 
on the GPR-based mapping model and PSO algorithm. Figure 8.1 shows the flow of 
the proposed multi-objective optimization design method. The difference from the 
traditional optimization design method is that the objective functions are calculated 
through the GPR-based mapping model during optimization design, instead of the 
traditional discrete numerical method with a high computational cost.
The detailed steps of the proposed hybrid algorithm for multi-objective optimiza￾tion design combined with the GPR-based mapping modeling and PSO algorithm 
are shown as follows: 
1. Establish the design parameters along with the range, objective, and constraint 
functions of the PMs, and construct the mathematical modeling of multi-objective 
optimization of the mechanism. 
2. Obtain the sample dataset by the design of experiment (DOE). Calculate 
the values of objective functions corresponding to the design parameters by 
increasing the node density in the workspace, and provide sufficient informa￾tion for mapping modeling. The LHD is recommended as the DOE, and the 
principle of LHD is shown in Sect. 3.6. 
3. Use the samples obtained in Step (2) to establish the mapping modeling between 
the objective functions and design parameters by the GPR method. Then, eval￾uate the accuracy of the GPR-based mapping modeling by two types of model 
validations, namely cross-validation and external validation. 
4. Execute the PMs’ multi-objective optimization design based on the PSO 
algorithm and GPR-based mapping modeling.8.1 Hybrid Algorithm and GPR-Based Mapping Modeling 207

8.1.2 GPR-Based Mapping Model 
GPR is a non-parametric model using Gaussian process (GP) prior approach for 
regression analysis, and it is a kernel-based probability method. The hypothesis of 
the GPR method includes noise (regression residual) and Gaussian process prior, 
and the solution is based on Bayesian inference and joint probability distribution. If 
kernel function is not restricted, GPR is theoretically a universal approximator of any 
continuous function in a compact space. Besides, GPR can provide posteriori predic￾tion. When the likelihood is in a normal distribution, the posterior has an analytical 
form. Therefore, GPR is a probability model with generality and resolvability. The 
principle of GPR is illustrated as follows.208 8 Hybrid Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel …
For regression modeling, 
y = f (X) + ε (8.2) 
If the form is not fixed, f (X) is a latent function. GPR takes the prior of the function 
space as a GP, and f (X) is a GP where the covariance function (kernel function) is 
zero-mean.

T; f (X) = [f (x1), f (x2),…, f (xn)]T. 
Given N sets of learning samples X = {X1, …, XN} and y = {y1, …, yN}, 
regression residual (noise) is assumed to obey normal distribution p(ε) = N(ε | 0, 
σ2 n). Since noise ε is the white noise and independent of f (X), y obeys Gaussian 
distribution when f obeys. According to the regression modeling and GP definition, 
the probability distribution of y and the f * value to be estimated as follows.

According to the properties of the Gaussian distribution and the data of test and 
training sets from the same distribution, the joint distribution of the training data and 
the test data is in a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution, and the prior of the joint 
probability distribution can be calculated as follows.

Once the conditional distribution of predicted data f * is obtained, the mean value 
of the distribution is used as its estimated value. The GPR-based modeling can be 
implemented by function fitrgp in the MATLAB toolbox. 
The performance indices should be evaluated through cross-validation and 
external verification to evaluate the accuracy of mapping modeling. The most 
commonly used performance indices [7] are the square root error (RMSE), and 
R squared (R2).8.2 Example: 2PRU-UPR PM 209

where yˆi is the predicted value calculated by GPR-based mapping modeling; yi the 
experimental value of discrete points; yi the mean value of yi. Higher R2 and smaller 
RMSE are preferred, which denotes the higher accuracy of mapping modeling in the 
overall design space. 
8.2 Example: 2PRU-UPR PM 
The 2PRU-UPR PM, which can form five-axis hybrid machining with a 2-DOF 
series head added to its moving platform to realize the machining of complex curved 
surfaces, is taken as a case in the work. The reasons for choosing the 2PRU-UPR PM 
are as follows: (1) the 2PRU-UPR PM is a lower-mobility overconstrained PM, and 
its stiffness modeling and dynamic modeling are representative. (2) Its reachable 
workspace is irregular, so the GPIs do not have analytical expressions, and need 
to be solved by numerical discretization method, leading to the high computational 
cost and reduced optimization design efficiency. Thus, the optimization design of the 
2PRU-UPR PM is more suitable to combine the mapping model and optimization 
algorithm to improve optimization design. 
The structure description and inverse kinematics have been described in 
Sect. 3.2.4. The structural parameters are reviewed as follows: elasticity modulus 
E = 210 GPa; shear modulus G = 77 GPa; material density ρ = 7850 kg/m3. The 
moving platform is round; its height h = 20 mm; the diameter of the links d = 80 mm. 
oA1 = oA2 = r1; oA3 = r2; OB3 = r3; A1B1 = L1 = A2B2 = L2. The linear distances 
of the actuators are denoted as OB1 = q1, OB2 = q2, and A3B3 = q3. p = [xyz]
T is 
the coordinate vector of midpoint o of the moving platform with the fixed frame. 
To facilitate the dynamics modeling, the reference coordinate frames, as shown 
in Fig. 8.2, are given as follows: The origin of the fixed coordinate frame O-XYZ is 
the midpoint of B1B2; the X-axis is along the direction of line OB3; Y-axis is along 
the direction of line OB1; the Z-axis is determined by the right-hand rule. The origin 
of moving coordinate frame o-xyz attached to the moving platform is the midpoint of 
line A1A2. The x-axis is along the oA3 direction, the y-axis is along the oA1 direction; 
the z-axis is determined by the right-hand rule. The origin of the link coordinate 
frame Ai-xiyizi is point Ai; xi-axis (i = 1, 2) is parallel to the X-axis; the y3-axis is 
parallel to the y-axis; the zi-axis (i = 1, 2, 3) is determined by the right-hand rule. 
For the PRU limb, u- and v-axes of the U-joints frames run along with the 2nd and 
1st axes of its U joints, respectively. For the UPR limb, u- and v-axes of the U-joint 
frame run along with the 1st and 2nd axes of its U joint, respectively. The R-joints 
frames of the three limbs are parallel to the corresponding link coordinate frames, 
respectively.210 8 Hybrid Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel …

the angles between BiAi and y- and X-axes, respectively. Rx and Ry are the rotation 
matrices about x- and y-axes, respectively. 
The assumptions are made for the following kinematic, stiffness, and elastody￾namic model: The weights of all components of the manipulator are negligible. The 
mobile platform and all joints are rigid, and all joints are frictionless.8.2 Example: 2PRU-UPR PM 211
8.2.1 Kinematic Performance Index 
The motion/force transmission index is adopted in this chapter for kinematic perfor￾mance evaluation to measure the transmission efficiency of a mechanism from input 
to output for its frame-free, dimensionless, and distance to singularities. The analysis 
of the motion/force transmission index of the 2PRU-UPR PM refer to Sect. 3.2.4. 
The LTI only denotes the kinematic index in a single configuration, thereby 
defining the global transmission index (GTI). Discrete points are often adopted as 
follows.

8.2.2 Stiffness Performance Index 
The amplitudes of constraint wrenches $r i1, $r i2, and $r i3 are represented by f i1, 
mi1, and f i2, respectively. According to screw theory, the PRU limb exerts active force 
f i2 along with link BiAi, constraint force f i1 passing through point B1 and parallel to 
its R-joint axis, and a constraint couple perpendicular to the two axes of its U joint. 
The UPR limb exerts constraint force f 31 passing through point A3 and parallel to its 
R-joint axis, active force f 32 along the direction of link B3A3, and constraint couple 
m31 perpendicular to its two axes of the U joint. 
The amplitude of the constraint wrenches system of the ith limb is represented as 
follows:

The current stiffness indices include the eigenvalue index, determinant index,

as the summing of the diagonal elements of the overall stiffness matrix, is adopted 
as the global stiffness index (GSI).

Note that i

6(s−1)×1 represents the displacement coordinates of 
inner nodes except for the two endpoints of the ith link. 
Therefore, the mapping relationship between the displacement coordinates of the

Establishing the elastodynamic modeling of the mechanism should extract its 
independent generalized displacement coordinates (IGDC). The method proposed 
in Ref. [11] is adopted in this chapter. 
With the multi-point constraint element theory, the compatibility conditions 
between the linear displacement of point Ai of link BiAi and the displacement 
coordinate uo of point o of the moving platform are given as
ΔAi = [

where E3 is a 3 × 3 identity matrix; [Aio×] the skew symmetrical matrix. 
The PRU limbs connect the rods with the moving platform through the U joints, 
which can rotate freely around its two axes. Therefore, only one angular displacement 
coordinate at point Ai of link BiAi (i = 1, 2) is independent. With the multi-point 
constraint element theory, the angular displacement coordinates of the two nodes 
connected by the U joint should satisfy214 8 Hybrid Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel …

Therefore, ϕAix and ϕAiy can be used as two independent angular displacement 
coordinates of the point Ai of the link BiAi (i = 1, 2). If ϕAix and ϕAiz, or ϕAiy and ϕAiz 
are considered as independent angular displacement coordinates, mapping matrix Ni 
will be singular in the working space. The derivation process is consistent with the

a3z = R3(3, 1) Q3(1, :) +R3(3, 3) Q3(2, :). 
Similarly, if ϕA3 x or ϕA3 z is considered as the independent angular displace￾ment coordinate of the point A3 of the link B3A3, matrix N3 will be singular in

8.2.4 Regular Workspace Volume 
In this chapter, the regular circular truncated cone, composed of the maximum 
inscribed ellipse (the long axis’s value is twice that of the short axis) in different 
operating platform heights, is adopted as the regular workspace. The polar coordi￾nate method proposed in Ref. [12] is adopted to calculate the regular workspace

inscribed ellipse of each layer is obtained based on the polar coordinate method. The

where Ai = 2πρ2 is the area of the maximum inscribed ellipse of the ith layer; ρ
the length of the minor axis of the ellipse;Δz the layer interval. Without loss of 
generality, the minimum length of the minor axis is set to 5° to ensure the reference 
point of the end effector can reach the desired orientation.

The LHD has the following advantages: treating every design variable equally 
important, ensuring the sampling distributed in a given design space, providing more 
information within a design space, bearing the systematic error rather than random 
error, and the controllable sample size. Thus, the LHD is considered as the DOE. 
The samples obtained by the LHD [13] can be prescribed as follows. It is assumed 
that there are n observations on each of the d design variables; (F1, …, Fd ) are the 
uniform distribution functions of independent input variables (x1, …, xd ); xij is the 
ith value of the jth design variable xj (i = 1, …, n; j = 1, …, d). P = pij and G =
gij are defined to be n × d matrices. Each column of matrix P is an independent 
random permutation of (1, …, n), and that of G is a uniform [0, 1] random variable 
independent of P. Design sites xij of a sample by LHD is expressed by 
xij = F−1
[(pij − gij )/n], (8.42) 
where pij and gij determine the positions of the “cell” and xij in the “cell”, respectively. 
The computer-design experimental points consist of xij. 
According to the recommended number of sets of parameters in Ref. [7], 476 
sets of parameters of experiment 1 (EX 1) are generated by the LHD. As a standard 
procedure for building the GPR-based model, cross-validation and external validation 
should be conducted to prove the model’s accuracy. Cross-validation compares the 
model with all data points except for one, while external validation compares the 
model predictions with a test dataset not utilized to build the model. tenfold cross￾validation is adopted to evaluate the model.8.2 Example: 2PRU-UPR PM 219
Fig. 8.3 Q-Q plots from cross-validation. a GTI, b GDI, c GSI, and d Vr 
Figure 8.3 shows the quantile–quantile (Q-Q) plot from the cross-validation 
process. The data plot is linear, indicating that the GPR model is in good agree￾ment with the data. The other two experiments are used to generate 162 sample 
points to analyze the influence of perturbed data on the accuracy of the GPR-based 
mapping model. The convergence time of the mapping models established by the 
three experiments is 2.02, 1.68, and 1.69 s, respectively. 
Table 8.1 compares the RMSE and R2 values of cross-validation and external 
validation for the three experiments. The acceptance levels for the RMSE value 
are below 0.2, and the R2 value is above 0.9 [14]. Thus, even for the perturbed 
data, the results always show the effectiveness and high accuracy of the established 
mapping model combined with GPR and LHD methods. The data used in building 
the mapping model, cross-validation, external validation, and data in Table 8.3 can 
be found online.1 
Two mapping models in Refs. [15, 16], the BP-based and MR-based models, 
were built to compare with GPR-based modeling. Poor robustness is one of the main 
disadvantages of the BP-based model. Taking Vr as an example, Fig. 8.4 shows the

fluctuate significantly.

parameters, and that of three or more parameters is ignored here. 
Sample points of EX 1 are taken as a case, and Table 8.2 lists RMSE and R2 values 
of MR- and BP-based models from external validation. The GPR-based model has 
consistently higher R2 and lower RMSE values than MR- and BP-based models. The 
GPR model does not need to specify the model order, which is indispensable for 
the MR-based model. The regression equation is assumed to be a polynomial in the 
MR-based model, which affects the diversity of factors and the immeasurability of 
some factors. According to the above analysis, the GPR-based model is more suitable 
than the MR-based and BP-based models. 
The PSO algorithm is also based on the concepts of “population” and “evolution”. 
However, each particle determines the search strategy according to its speed, instead

of the crossover and mutation operation of the GA. The algorithm is easy to be 
implemented. 
Supposing the population is composed of N particles in the D-dimensional search 
space, the optimal position of the ith particle is recorded as pi = (pi1, pi2, …, piD), 
and the optimal global position recorded as pg = (pg1, pg2, …, pgD) (i = 1, 2, …, N). 
Particles update their positions and speeds according to these two optimal values. 
vij (t + 1) = ω · vij (t) + c1r1(t)[pij (t) − xij (t)] + c2r2(t)[pgi (t) − xij (t)],
(8.44) 
xij (t + 1) = xij (t) + vij (t + 1), (8.45) 
where ω is the dynamic inertia weight; c1 and c2 are the learning factors representing 
the weight coefficients of the particle-tracking historical value and optimal global 
value, respectively; r1 and r2 the random numbers distributed in the interval [0 1], 
respectively. The first part of the Eq. 8.44 represents the previous velocity of the 
particle used to ensure the algorithm’s global convergence. The second and third 
parts ensure that the algorithm has the ability of local convergence. 
The step size of the polar coordinate discrete point method is analyzed as follows: 
The height interval, polar radius, and polar angle are equally divided into eight parts. 
The calculation time of a set of GPIs is 185.17 s, and the time of using the GPR-based 
mapping model is about 2 s. Theoretically, one iteration takes 18,517 s, considering 
that the population size is 100. If node density is finer with the GPI, the calculation 
time will increase exponentially. The initial dynamic inertia weight of PSO is set as 
0.729, and c1 and c2 are set as 1.49 [7]. The calculation time of the multi-objective 
optimization problem in Eq. (8.41) using the hybrid algorithm is 1016 s on a desk 
computer with a 3.00-GHz CPU, while using the PSO algorithm requires 63,4832 s. 
That is, the optimization method proposed in the work can save 99.84% of the 
computational cost. The results show that the proposed hybrid algorithm is valid. 
Figure 8.5 shows the Pareto frontier of the multi-objective optimization problem 
of the 2PRU-UPR PM. Pareto frontiers are not smooth surfaces or curves, caused by 
competition and coupling among multiple objective functions. GTI and Vr change 
in the opposite direction with GSI and GDI, respectively, indicating that kinematics 
performance and workspace volume have a competitive relationship with stiffness 
performance and natural frequency, respectively. GTI with Vr and GSI with GDI 
change in the positive direction. Without considering GTI and Vr, both GSI and 
GDI can achieve the optimal value on the Pareto frontier simultaneously, and vice 
versa. When GTI is less than 0.543, increasing GTI will not significantly reduce 
the GDI and GSI of the mechanism, nor will it significantly increase Vr. When 
the GTI is greater than 0.543, increasing the GTI will weaken the GDI and GSI 
and significantly improve Vr. Therefore, GTI = 0.543 is the essential data for the 
multi-objective optimization design of the 2PRU-UPR PM.8.2 Example: 2PRU-UPR PM 223

Table 8.3 shows 40 sets of geometrical parameters and objective functions on 
the Pareto frontier, as well as that of before optimization. The mechanism’s opti￾mized performance indices are improved to a certain extent, especially for the gray￾marked data. All the performance indices are better than those before optimization, 
which proves the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method. The followings 
are taken as the cases: optimized parameters listed in Table 8.3 and non-optimized8.2 Example: 2PRU-UPR PM 225
parameters r1 = 250 mm, r2 = 250 mm, r3 = 500 mm, and L1 = 700 mm. After 
optimization, the optimized kinematic performance of the three cases increases by 
8, 10, and 10%, with the dynamic performance of 77.48, 59.66, and 48.14, and the 
stiffness performance 22.89, 14.45, and 10.74%, respectively. Besides, the volumes 
of the regular workspace indices increase by 63.16, 73.68, and 94.74%, respectively. 
Figures 8.6, 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9 show the distribution of the LPIs in the middle plane 
of the regular workspace of the 2PRU-UPR PM before and after optimization. In 
Figs. 8.6, 8.7 and 8.8, the LTI, f 1, and LSI in the middle plane of the regular workspace 
are significantly improved after optimization, and the results are consistent with those 
in Table 8.3. 
The ellipse’s minor axis in the middle plane of the regular workspace increases 
from 12.5 to 13.5° after optimization. Compared with the regular workspace with a 
height of 0.2 m before optimization (the interval of each layer in Fig. 8.6 is 0.01 m.), 
the heights for the three cases are 0.18, 0.19, and 0.20 m, respectively. The maximum 
minor axis radii of the elliptical section of the regular workspace increase from 16 
to 21.5, 21, and 23°, respectively. Thus, the workspace volume of the mechanism is

improved, consistent with the data in Table 8.3. The optimization results are verified 
again. 
It is worth noting that the optimal position of the fundamental frequency has 
changed after optimization, indicating that geometrical parameters of the 2PRU-UPR 
PM also affect the optimal position of the fundamental frequency. The performance 
indices before and after optimization are all symmetrical about β = 0, which is 
determined by the symmetrical structure of one side of the mechanism. 
8.3 Summary 
As today’s engineering optimization design becomes complex, intelligent analysis 
and optimization tools are developed to solve multi-objective and multi-parameter 
optimization design problems. However, the optimization algorithm’s high calcu￾lation cost is due to its time-consuming calculation of GPIs, which makes it chal￾lenging to apply the optimization algorithms to the high computation-intensive design8.3 Summary 227

and d Case 3
in a real-life engineering setting. A hybrid algorithm for multi-objective optimiza￾tion design combined with the GPR-based mapping model and PSO algorithm was 
introduced in this chapter for such optimization design problems. 
The regular workspace volume, motion/force transmission performance, stiffness 
performance, and the fundamental frequency indices were considered as the objective 
functions. The mapping models between the GPIs and the design parameters were 
established by resorting to the GPR method. The mapping model combined with GPR 
and LHD methods showed high accuracy and robustness to the perturbed data. The 
MR-based and BP-based models were built to compare the accuracy and robustness 
with the GPR-based mapping model. The results showed that the GPR-based model 
had consistently lower RMSE and higher R2 than those of the MR- and BP-based 
models and better robustness than the BP-based model. 
A hybrid algorithm for multi-objective optimization design combined with the 
GPR-based mapping model and PSO algorithm was introduced to improve the high 
computation-intensive optimization design. The 2PRU-UPR PM was taken as an 
example to implement the introduced method. The computational cost was saved 
by 99.84% compared with that using the PSO algorithm. The Pareto frontier was 
obtained, and 40 non-dominated solution sets on the Pareto frontier were listed. In 
the three sets of the optimized parameters, the GTI increased by 8, 10, and 10%, GDI228 8 Hybrid Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel …

increased by 77.48, 59.66, and 48.14%, GSI increased by 22.89, 14.45, and 10.74%, 
Vr increased by 63.16, 73.68, and 94.74%, respectively. It verified the correctness 
of the hybrid algorithm proposed in the work.

Sensitivity Analysis and Multi-objective 
Optimization Design of Parallel 
Manipulators 
In the optimization design mathematical model, dimensions are always concerned as 
variables, but it is noted that a mechanism especially parallel manipulator (PM) may 
associate with amount of dimensions. Some of them have a great influence on perfor￾mance but others may not. Therefore, it is necessary to select the main parameters 
from the large quantity of parameters to be designed by means of parameter sensitivity 
analysis method, so as to eliminate unimportant parameters and simplify performance 
analysis and optimization model. Variance-based methods have assessed themselves 
as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity anal￾ysis of model output [1]. The most commonly used variance-based Sobol’ sensitivity 
analysis method can be roughly divided into two categories: Monte Carlo [2] and 
direct integral methods [3]. Lian et al. [4, 5] investigated the effects of joint stiff￾ness/compliance coefficients and parameters of cross section to the mass and stiffness 
performance of the T5 PM through parameter sensitivity analysis based on response 
surface method (RSM) and Monte Carlo simulation method. Liu et al. [3] conducted 
sensitivity analysis in structural crashworthiness based on the Sobol’ direct inte￾gral method. Tang and Yao [6] design a set of optimized dimensional parameters for 
constructing the six-cable driven PM of FAST based on the sensitivity design method 
and tension performance evaluating functions. Meanwhile, traditional optimization 
design often adopts numerical discrete method to calculate global performance indi￾cators, and its high computational cost will significantly reduce the efficiency of 
multi-objective optimization design [1, 4]. 
In this chapter, we focus on a multi-objective optimization design method of PMs 
combining RSM, sensitivity analysis, and intelligent optimization algorithm. The 
analytical mapping model between the global performance index and design param￾eters can be combined with the variance-based Sobol’ sensitivity method to obtain 
the analytical solution of the sensitivity index, so that the design parameters that 
have an important impact on the objective function can be obtained. The optimiza￾tion design method combining sensitivity analysis results, response surface model, 
and intelligent optimization algorithm can significantly improve the efficiency of

here for the analysis and discussion.

where yi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) represents the ith fitting polynomial functions; a0, bi, ci, 
dij, ei, and f i represent the undetermined regression coefficients; t represents the 
number of design parameters; xixj the coupling of two parameters. The coupling of 
three-parameters xixjxk and the higher-order coupling are ignored in the equation. 
The MR-based RSM based on the principle of least squares estimates the regres￾sion coefficient by minimizing the square of the difference between estimated value 
yˆi and the measured value yi, that is,

For linear regression of a design parameter, only two points are needed to determine 
a straight line; however, the obtained straight line is not accurate for actual measure￾ments. When the measurement point is greater than 2, the number of equations is 
greater than their unknown number. They are overdetermined equations, which are 
solved by the fitting method.

quartic polynomial fitting functions. 
Performance indices of the fitted function are evaluated through cross-validation 
and external validation to assess the accuracy of the fitting polynomial. The most 
commonly used performance indices are the relative average absolute error (RAAE), 
relative maximum absolute error (RMAE), root-mean-squares error (RMSE), and 
R-squared (R2).

9.1.2 Sensitivity Analysis 
Sensitivity analysis is an analytical technique that studies how the uncertainty in the 
model output is distributed to different sources of uncertainties in the input factors of 
the model, and it can identify important input variables. At present, traditional calcu￾lation methods often use sampling techniques [7, 8] to approximate the sensitivity of 
calculation parameters for specific engineering problems, and the stability and accu￾racy of calculation results depend on samples. The combination of the MR-based 
RSM and Sobol’s sensitivity analysis method can avoid or reduce the difficulties in 
the solution process and increase the calculation efficiency and accuracy.234 9 Sensitivity Analysis and Multi-objective Optimization Design …
Given model Y = f (X1, X2, …, Xk ), the output parameter Y is a scalar. Based 
on Sobol’s sensitivity index definition [7], the variance-based first-order sensitivity 
index is defined as 
⎧
⎨
⎩
Si = VXi (EX∼i (Y |Xi ))
V (Y )
V (Y ) = VXi (EX∼i (Y |Xi )) + EXi (VX∼i (Y |Xi ))
, (9.5) 
where Xi represents the ith impact factor; X~i the matrix composed of all impact 
factors except for Xi; EX~i(·) and VX~i(·) represent the mean and variance of input 
(·) when all possible values of the parameters except for X~i are taken, respectively; 
EX~i(Y|Xi) represents that the mean of Y takes all possible values of X~i with Xi 
unchanged; EXi(·) and VXi(·) represent the mean and variance of input (·) when all 
possible values of Xi are taken; Si is a standardized index with a value range of 0–1; 
VXi(EX~i(Y|Xi)) evaluates the first-order influence of impact factor Xi on the model 
output; EXi(VX~i(Y|Xi)) is usually called the residual. Therefore, the index is also 
called the local sensitivity index. 
Local sensitivity index Si only considers the first-order influence of parameter Xi 
instead of the influence of parameters’ cross-action. The global sensitivity index is 
defined as follows to evaluate the overall impact of Xi on the model output. 
STi = EX∼i (VXi (Y |X∼i ))
V (Y ) = 1 − VX∼i (EXi (Y |X∼i ))
V (Y ) (9.6) 
An analytical MR-based RSM between the model output and design parameters 
was established in the work. Since the established MR-based RSM is a polynomial 
with a simplified structure, the sensitivity results of the model can be obtained quickly 
through Sobol’s direct integration, thereby evaluating the sensitivity of the structural 
parameters of complex systems. 
When the Sobol’s method was adopted to identify and quantitatively evaluate 
model parameters, n-dimensional model parameters X were transformed into unit 
hypercube Hn, Hn = {X|0 ≤ Xi ≤ 1, i = 1, 2, …, n}. Based on variance decomposition 
[2], the response function is decoupled as

f ij = f ij (Xi, Xj) can be obtained by following multiple integrations.9.1 Sensitivity Analysis and Multi-objective Optimization Design Method 235

9.1.3 Multi-objective Optimization Design of PMs 
The analysis process of the multi-objective optimization design of PMs based on the 
RSM, sensitivity analysis, and intelligent optimization algorithm can be summarized 
as follows: 
1. A multi-objective-optimization mathematical model of PMs was established, 
including design parameters and their ranges, objectives, and constraint func￾tions. Normalize or convert the objective function to a value of the same 
magnitude. 
2. Obtain a certain number of sample points through Latin hypercube design. Mean￾while, the node density was increased to improve the accuracy of the objective 
function at the sample points, and enough information was provided for poly￾nomial fitting. Reference [9] shows that the number of sample points should be 
more than twice the polynomial coefficient. The RSM was established based on 
sample points, and external verification was performed to evaluate the accuracy 
of the MR-based RSM. 
3. Combine the analytical RSM and the variance-based sensitivity analysis method 
to establish the analytical solution of the sensitivity index, and obtain the design 
parameters significantly affecting the objective function. 
4. Simplify the design parameters based on the sensitivity analysis results, and 
carry out multi-objective optimization design of PMs by combining the RSM 
and intelligent optimization algorithm. 
9.2 Example: Delta PM 
Figures 9.1 and 9.2 show the three-degree-of-freedom Delta PM proposed by Clave 
[10] and its branch, respectively. The geometric arrangement of the joints and links 
makes the moving platform have three translational degrees of freedom of movement. 
The Delta parallel robot has been widely used in high-speed sorting and other fields, 
consisting of a base, a moving platform, and three identical subchains. Three drive R 
joints are fixed on the base, and their axes form an equilateral triangle. Each branch 
chain contains a parallelogram mechanism composed of spherical joints, and its 
main function is to limit the direction of the working platform to be parallel to the 
workpiece. The geometric parameters are defined as follows: La represents the length 
of proximal link oibi; Ld the length of parallelogram long rod (distal link) bipi; Ls9.2 Example: Delta PM 237
the length of short parallelogram rod bi1bi2; ra the distance from base center o to 
R-joint center oi; rb the distance from center p of the moving platform to midpoint 
pi of pi1pi2. 
The coordinate system is defined as follows to facilitate the calculation of the 
inverse solution. In global coordinate system o-xyz, the y-axis is along oo1; the z￾axis is perpendicular to the base; the x-axis is determined by the right-hand rule. In

branch coordinate system oi-xyz, its y-axis is along the ooi direction; the z-axis is 
perpendicular to the base down; the x-axis is determined by the right-hand rule. 
Knowing the position of the moving platform, the driving angle can be obtained 
from the kinematic inverse solution [11]. 
αi = a tan 2(cαi , sαi ), (9.15) 
where s and c represent sin and cos, respectively; sαi = (-ai2 
oipiy + ai1 
oipiz)/(ai1 
2 
+ ai2 
2); cαi = (ai1 
oipiy + ai2 
oipiz)/(ai1 
2 + ai2 
2); oipix, oipiy, and oipiz represent the 
x, y, and z coordinates of oipiz in coordinate system {oi}, respectively. ai1 = la + ld 
sθicβi, ai2 = ld sθisβi; θi = cos−1(
oipix/ld ), βi = cos−1[(oipix 
2 + oipiy 
2 + oipiz 
2-ld 
2-
la 
2)/(2lald sθi)]. 
The coordinate system of each connecting rod is defined as follows to facilitate 
subsequent dynamic modeling. For link oibi of coordinate system bi − xyz, its z￾axis is along the oibi direction; the x-axis is along the bi1bi2 direction; the y-axis is 
determined by the right-hand rule. It can be obtained by rotating branch coordinate 
system {oi} around the x-axis by an angle of π/2 – αi. For the coordinate system 
bi1 − xyz (bi2 − xyz) of long parallelogram rod bi1pi1 (bi2pi2), its z-axis is along the 
direction of rod bi1pi1 (bi2pi2), and the y-axis is perpendicular to the plane formed 
by a parallelogram. Coordinate system {bi1} ({bi2}) can be obtained by rotating the 
new coordinate system around the y-axis by an angle of θi − π/2 after rotating the 
coordinate system {bi} around the x-axis by an angle of −βi. The coordinate system 
of link bi1bi2 is parallel to branch coordinate system {oi}. 
Based on the above analysis, the transformation matrix from the global coordinate 
system to the coordinate system of each link is obtained as follows. 
⎧

⎪⎪⎩
Ri1 = Rx (π/2 − αi )Ri 
Ri2 = Ri 
Ri3 = Ry (θi − π/2)Rx (−βi )Rx (π/2 − αi )Ri 
Ri4 = Ri3 
, (9.16) 
where Ri represents the transformation matrix from global coordinate system {o} 
to branch coordinate system {oi}; Rij the transformation matrix from the global 
coordinate system to the jth link coordinate system of branch i (i = 1, 2, and 3; j =
1, 2, 3, and 4). For the convenience of expression, oibi, bi1bi2, bi1pi1, and bi2pi2 are 
defined as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th link of branch i, respectively. 
9.2.1 Workspace Analysis 
The Delta PM is mainly used for pick-and-place operations within a certain 
workspace, and the volume of the workspace is one of the main performance evalua￾tion indices of the Delta PM. The reachable workspace is often irregular, which is not9.2 Example: Delta PM 239
conducive to trajectory planning and programming control. Besides, some perfor￾mances may be “ill-conditioned” at the boundaries of the reachable workspace [12]. 
Therefore, the regular workspace volume is often used as the evaluation index of the 
workspace in engineering applications [13]. 
The workspace of the mechanism is limited by the passive-joint rotation angle 
[11], and the passive-joint rotation angle range is defined as 
45o ≤ θi ≤ 135o (9.17) 
The range of rotation angle βi is defined as follows to avoid multiple solutions in 
the inverse solution and the interference between proximal and distal links. 
45o ≤ βi ≤ 135o (9.18) 
In addition to the angle limit, Clavel [11] defined the following size parameter 
constraints to avoid the singularity. 
ra − rb 
La 
≥ 0.5, Ld 
La 
≥ 1.75 (9.19) 
The size constraints are defined as follows to meet the tool size requirements of 
the moving platform, the size deviation between the base and the moving platform, 
and the needs of installing the drive motor. 
rb ≥ 20 mm , ra − rb ≥ 20 mm (9.20) 
Taking the Delta-740 parallel robot as an example [11], its geometric parameters 
are as follows: ra = 194 mm; rb = 30 mm; La = 260 mm; Ld = 480 mm; Ls =
72 mm. Figure 9.3a shows the reachable workspace of the mechanism based on the 
discrete search algorithm. The reachable workspace is circularly symmetric, which is 
consistent with the structure of the Delta robot. A cavity exists in the lower part of the 
reachable workspace, and the workspace is not continuous. As the moving platform 
moves away from the base, the void inside the reachable workspace disappears, but 
the range of horizontal movement decreases.
The polar coordinate method is used to obtain the space composed of the largest 
inscribed circle of each layer without voids as its regular workspace in the work [12]. 
Meanwhile, the minimum radius of the inscribed circle is set to 100 mm to ensure a 
certain operating space [14]. Figure 9.3b shows the regular circular-table workspace 
of the Delta PM. 
The regular workspace volume of the Delta robot can be obtained by Eq. (9.8.40).240 9 Sensitivity Analysis and Multi-objective Optimization Design …

9.2.2 Kinematic Performance Index 
The motion/force transmission performance index is adopted as the kinematic eval￾uation index for evaluating the energy transmission efficiency from input to output 
of a PM in this work (refer to Sect. 3.2). 
According to the screw theory, the 4S closed-loop mechanism can be replaced by 
a PRPR generalized kinematic pair for kinematic analysis [15]. Therefore, the twist 
system of branch i can be expressed as 
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
Si1 = [nai , ooi × nai]
Si2 = [nai , obi × nai]
Si3 = [nli3, obi × nli3]
Si4 = [0, 0, 0, nai]
Si5 = [0, 0, 0, ni]
, (9.21) 
where nai represents the unit vector of actuation R-joint axis of the branch i; nli3 
the unit vector of bipi; ni = nai × nli3 the unit vector perpendicular to the plane 4S 
parallelogram mechanism. 
Based on the screw theory, the transmission wrench of branch i can be obtained 
as 
$Ti = [nli3, obi × nli3], (9.22) 
$Ti represents the force along bipi through point bi. 
Equation (9.21) shows the input twist screw of branch i can be obtained as 
SAi = [nai , ooi × nai] (9.23) 
From reciprocal screw theory, we can get9.2 Example: Delta PM 241
SAi ◦ STi = Lanli3 · (nai × nli1) = Lanli3 · ti , (9.24) 
where nli1 represents the unit vector of link oibi; ti = nai × nli1 the unit vector 
perpendicular to bi1bi2 and oibi. 
Therefore, the input transmission index of branch i can be obtained as 
λi =
|
|$Ti ◦ $Ai
|
|
|
|$Ti ◦ $Ai
|
|
max 
= nli3 · ti (9.25) 
All actuation joints except for branch i are locked, and the transmission wrench 
in branch j is transformed into a constraint wrench (i, j = 1, 2, and 3; i /= j). Thus, 
the constraint wrenches system of the manipulator is obtained as 
Ui = [
$r 
11, $r 
21, $r 
31, $r 
Tj , $r 
T k ] (j /= k; j, k /= i ) (9.26) 
The manipulator is a single-degree-of-freedom motion, and the instantaneous 
twist screw of the moving platform can be represented by the output twist screw, 
which can be obtained by reciprocal product with constraint wrenches system Ui 
equaling to zero. 
$Oi ◦ Ui = 0 (9.27) 
Therefore, the output transmission index of branch i can be obtained as 
ηi =

|$Ti ◦ $Oi

The LTI and GTI can thus be obtained through Eqs. (2.55) and (8.11). 
9.2.3 Dynamic Performance Index 
The Delta parallel robot is mainly used for high-speed pick-and-place operations, and 
its excellent dynamic performance is the premise to ensure the work quality under 
high-speed operation. In this work, the fundamental frequency, that is, the first-order 
natural frequency, is adopted as the dynamic performance index of the Delta PM. 
The method of combining global independent generalized displacement coordi￾nates [16] with MSA was used to calculate the natural frequencies of the manipulator 
in the work. The dynamic control equation established by this method included all 
the constraints of the manipulator and did not need Lagrangian multipliers and simul￾taneity with the constraint equation, which could improve the calculation efficiency 
of the dynamic control equation.242 9 Sensitivity Analysis and Multi-objective Optimization Design …

The global dynamic performance index of the mechanism in the complete 
workspace can be obtained by Eq. (8.39). 
Before analyzing the distribution of the natural frequencies of the Delta PM in 
the workspace, ANSYS Workbench software is used to verify the correctness of 
the analytical model [17, 18]. Firstly, SOLIDWORKS software is used to establish 
the corresponding 3D model, which is then imported into Workbench software. The 
physical parameters and constraints of the FEM model are set to be identical with 
the analytical model. The constraints of the rigid spherical joints are modeled by 
the MPC element, which adopts two overlapping nodes at the connection point to 
simulate joint constraints [17, 18]. The moving platform is set to be rigid. The material 
parameters of elastic components are set as follows: elastic modulus E = 200 GPa; 
shear modulus G = 76.9 GPa; the diameters of the proximal and distal links are da =
20 mm and dp = 10 mm, respectively; the thickness of moving platform h = 10 mm. 
The mass matrix of the moving platform obtained by the SOLIDWORKS software 
in global coordinate system {o} is as follows. 
Mp = diag[341.128 341.128 341.128 0.134 0.134 0.263 ] (ggm2 ) (9.39) 
Without loss of generality, two configurations are considered based on whether 
the Delta PM is rotationally symmetric to verify the correctness of the analytical 
model. In Case 1 of a rotationally symmetric configuration, x = 0 m; y = 0 m; z =
0.53 m. In Case 2 of an asymmetric configuration, x = −0.07 m; y = 0.1 m; z = 0.5 m. 
Table 9.1 compares natural frequencies between analytical and FEMs. The natural 
frequencies of the first six orders are approximately equal to zero; the errors between 
analytical and FEMs for these scenarios are ignored in Table 9.1 [17, 19]. This is9.2 Example: Delta PM 245
caused by the local DOFs of the Delta PM, namely the mechanism has six local 
DOFs, which rotates around the axes of six distal links. In other words, the seven￾order natural frequency is the fundamental frequency of the Delta PM in its true sense. 
The maximum error of natural frequencies between analytical and FEM methods is 
within 2%, which verifies the correctness of the analytical model. Compared with the 
augmented Lagrange equation [20], the proposed method is computationally efficient 
because the computation concerning the Lagrange multipliers is not required, and the 
calculation time of natural frequencies is reduced from 0.045 to 0.033 s. Therefore, 
the proposed model can be used to evaluate the natural frequencies of the Delta PM. 
Figure 9.4 shows the FEM results of the first three-order natural frequencies of the 
Delta PM. 
Modal assurance criterion (MAC) [21, 22] is usually applied to quantitatively 
evaluate the consistency of the modes predicted by different models. Here, the MAC 
value is used to evaluate the consistency of the modes of the rigid moving platform 
predicted by analytical and FEMs.

third-order moves along the z-axis; the fourth-order rotates around the z-axis. Since9.2 Example: Delta PM 247

9.2.4 Sensitivity Analysis and Multi-objective Optimization 
Design of Delta PM 
Consider the material properties of the Delta parallel robot, the diameter of the link, 
and the thickness of the operating platform are all constant: elastic modulus E =
200 GPa, shear modulus G = 76.9 GPa, proximal link’s diameter da = 20 mm, 
distal link’s diameter dp = 10 mm, and moving platform’s thickness h = 10 mm.

20 50 400 20] mm and xmax = [400 250 350 800 100] mm represent the lower and 
upper limits of the design parameters, respectively. 
The Delta PM has five design parameters, and Eq. 9.1 shows that the quartic 
polynomial has 31 coefficients. Ref. [4] recommends that the number of sample 
points be at least twice the polynomial coefficients. The work used 198 sample 
points for polynomial fitting and 50 sets of data for external verification to ensure 
a certain fitting accuracy. Table 9.2 shows the accuracy evaluation of the MR-based 
RSM, and a quartic polynomial should be chosen as the fitting function. R2 is greater 
than 0.97, and RMSE is less than 0.06, showing the accuracy of the RSM. 
Based on the analysis in Sect. 9.1.2, the sensitivity index of the objective function 
relative to the design parameters can be obtained. Figure 9.6 shows the histogram 
of the sensitivity index. Figure 9.6a, c have similar distributions, that is, each input 
variable has a similar influence on the dynamics and kinematic performance of the 
Delta PM. The size of the proximal link connected to the base has the greatest 
influence on the dynamic performance of the manipulator, followed by the sizes 
of the base and distal link, moving platform, and short link of the parallelogram. 
The proximal link has the greatest influence on the workspace volume of the Delta 
PM, followed by the distal link and other design variables. On the whole, the sizes 
of proximal and distal links significantly affect the workspace volume, kinematic 
performance, and dynamic performance of the Delta robot, followed by the radius 
of the base and moving platform, and the size of the short link of the parallelogram 
has little influence on the three performance indices; it can be ignored in the process 
of the multi-objective optimization design of the Delta robot. Therefore, the design9.2 Example: Delta PM 249

parameters in the multi-objective optimization mathematical model of Eq. 9.41 can 
be reduced from 5 to 4 based on the sensitivity analysis results. 
Compared with the complex crossover and mutation operations of the genetic 
algorithm (GA), the particle swarm algorithm (PSO) algorithm uses the speed of 
the particles to determine its search direction, with higher convergence speed [4]. 
Therefore, PSO algorithm is selected as the multi-objective optimization algorithm 
in the work. Table 9.3 shows the parameter settings of the PSO algorithm, and 
Fig. 9.7 presents the Pareto frontier for workspace volume, motion/force transmis￾sion performance, and natural frequency indices. Both of the GTI and GDI change 
in the opposite direction with Vr, indicating that the kinematic performance and 
dynamic performance have a competitive relationship with the regular workspace 
volume, respectively. A larger workspace means lower motion/force transmission 
performance and natural frequencies and vice versa. There is a proportional change 
between GTI and GDI, that is, there is a small competitive relationship between the 
two, and both GSI and GDI can achieve the optimal value on the Pareto frontier 
simultaneously.

Taking the third set of data marked by gray shades in Table 9.4 as an example, 
Figs. 9.8 and 9.9 show the distribution of performance indices in the regular

are symmetrical about the circumference, consistent with the structural proper￾ties of the manipulator. The optimized workspace volume has been significantly 
improved. At each moving platform height, the closer the moving platform is to 
the center, the higher the fundamental frequency and LTI. Therefore, the Delta PM 
should work as close to the central location as possible to optimize its dynamics 
and kinematics. The maximum horizontal working area and the natural frequency 
decrease with the increased height of the manipulator, and the kinematic performance 
increases first and then decreases. This result has certain guiding significance for the 
optimal-working-height interval design of the Delta robot.252 9 Sensitivity Analysis and Multi-objective Optimization Design …

9.3 Summary 
Performance evaluation and multi-objective optimization design are two impor￾tant issues for the theoretical research of PMs. In the specific engineering envi￾ronment, optimization design, sensitivity analysis, and multi-objective optimization 
design of PMs are more and more challenging due to the high computational cost 
of global performance indices (GPIs) and high competitive coupling among them. 
The work introduced a sensitivity analysis and multi-objective optimization design 
method combining the RSM, Sobol’s sensitivity analysis, and intelligent optimization 
algorithm to solve such issues. 
1. An analytical RSM between GPIs and design parameters was established by 
the LHS method and the least squares polynomial fitting technique. An effi￾cient calculation method of the sensitivity index with analytical expressions wasReferences 253
established combined with the variance-based Sobol’s sensitivity index, and the 
design parameters significantly affecting the objective function were obtained. 
The sensitivity analysis results, RSM, and PSO algorithm were used to introduce 
an efficient multi-objective optimization design method. 
2. The method introduced in the work was realized by taking the Delta PM as an 
example. Regular workspace volume, motion/force transmission performance, 
and the first natural frequency indices were considered as objective functions. 
Sensitivity analysis results showed that the dimensions of proximal and distal 
links significantly affected the three performance indices, followed by the radii of 
the base and moving platform. The short parallelogram rods were excluded from 
the design parameters as unimportant parameters. Finally, the multi-objective 
Pareto frontier of the Delta PM was obtained, and 20 groups of non-dominated 
solutions were given in the table. The comparison of performance indices before 
and after optimization verified the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm.

Multi-objective Optimization Design 
of Parallel Manipulators Based 
on the Principal Component Analysis 
The traditional multi-objective optimization design methods of parallel manipula￾tors (PMs) mainly include the comprehensive objective method [1] and the Pareto 
frontier method [2]. The comprehensive objective method defines the sum of product 
of weight factors and multiple performance indices as a comprehensive performance 
index. However, due to the non-uniform dimensions of the objective functions and 
the subjectivity of weight factors [3], this method lacks explicit physical meaning. 
Pareto frontier method can simultaneously obtain multiple sets of non-dominated 
solutions of multiple performance indices for decision makers to choose. For two 
objective functions, Pareto frontier is a curve, and for more than two objective func￾tions, Pareto frontier is a hypersurface. The main difficulty of Pareto frontier method 
is how to select a set of global optimal solutions with definite physical meaning on 
the Pareto frontier. To solve this problem, Sun et al. [4] and Qi et al. [5] considered 
the cooperative equilibrium point that is the minimum sum of squares of the differ￾ence between a set of non-dominated solutions and other non-dominated solutions 
on the Pareto frontier as the global optimal solutions. This method is equivalent 
to assuming that each performance index is equally important, which is unreason￾able in actual engineering design. Meanwhile, the high computational cost of global 
performance index (GPI) and a larger number of iterations in the process of the opti￾mization significantly undermine the efficiency of optimization design or even make 
it impossible. 
In this chapter, we focus on the multi-objective optimization design method of 
PMs based on the principle component analysis and neural network to construct 
overall comprehensive performance index with clear physical meaning and improve 
the computational cost of the optimization design. The 3RPS and 6PSS PMs are 
taken as two examples here for the analysis and discussion.

10.1 Multi-objective Optimization of PMs Based 
on the Principal Component Analysis 
The basic idea of PCA is to recombine the original indices that have certain correlation 
into a new set of comprehensive indices that are independent to each other; it is 
a method of dimensionality reduction in mathematics. In mathematics, the linear 
combination of the original p indices is usually taken as the new comprehensive 
index Fi. The first comprehensive index F1 should reflect the information of the 
original indices as much as possible. The most classical method is the variance￾based method to express the maximum variance of all linear combinations as F1, 
the first principal component, and so on. And satisfy cov(Fi, Fj) = 0. Therefore, the 
problem of finding principal components is to find the principal axes of the ellipsoid 
in p-dimensional space. 
In the actual engineering environment, it is difficult to establish the popula￾tion covariance matrix, which is usually replaced by the sample covariance matrix. 
Suppose there are p indices, and each index has n samples, the original sample data 
is expressed as X = [x1, x2, …, xp], xi = [x1i, x2i, …, xni]
T. 
The procedure of constructing overall comprehensive index based on PCA can be 
summarized as follows. 
1. Assign the envelope of the workspace to be searched, and determine the initial 
point and allowable error of the bisection method. Regular workspace boundary 
can be rapidly obtained by employing the bisection method; GPIs can thus 
be evaluated in the regular workspace [6, 7]. Detail process is introduced in 
Sect. 10.3. 
2. Create sample data based on the design of experiment; Latin hypercube 
sampling is a stratified sampling technique and a design of experiment method 
recommended in Refs. [6], which is adopted in this chapter to represent the 
characteristics of the population sample. 
3. Before calculating principal components, the original sample data X needs to 
be standardized as X* to eliminate some adverse influences that may be caused 
by non-uniform dimensions and non-uniform order of magnitude of objective 
functions

where rij = cov(xi , x j ) =

n−1 (i, j = 1, 2, …, p). 
For the standardized data X*, Eq. (10.2) can be further expressed as follows. 
R = X∗T X∗
n − 1 (10.3) 
5. Calculate the eigenvalues (λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ … ≥ λp) of the correlation matrix, as 
well as the corresponding eigenvectors (a1, a2, …, ap), ai = [a1i, a2i, …, api]
T. 
Accordingly, the ith principle component can be given as 
Fi = a1i x∗
1 + a2i x∗
2 + ... + api x∗
p (10.4) 
6. Calculate the cumulative contribution rate of the first m principle component 
δ =
Σm 
i=1 λi
Σp 
i=1 λi 
(10.5) 
If the cumulative contribution rate of the first m principal components reaches 
85% [8, 9], it indicates that the first m principal components basically contain all 
the information of the performance indices. 
7. Establish the overall comprehensive performance index 
F = Σ
k
i=1 
λi Fi (10.6) 
PCA method can convert multiple performance indices into an overall compre￾hensive evaluation index and avoid the disadvantages of subjectively determining 
the weight factors and has clear physical significance. 
The procedure of dimensional synthesis method of PMs based on the PCA method 
is summarized and shown in Fig. 10.1.
Mathematically, the principal component Fi is a special linear combination of p 
variables x1, x2, …, xp. These linear combinations are the rotation of the coordinate 
system composed of x1, x2, …, xp to produce a new coordinate system, and the new 
coordinate axes pass through the direction with the largest sample variance. Taking 
the principal component analysis of ternary variables as an example, n scattered 
sample points are distributed in the ellipsoid. The first, second, and third principle 
axes direction of the ellipsoid are F1, F2, and F3, respectively. The length of principal 
axis of the ellipsoid correspond to the weight coefficient of principal component in 
this direction. Figure 10.2 shows the schematic diagram of principal components of 
ternary variables; if the ellipsoid is flat, most of the fluctuations of n sample points can 
be summarized as the fluctuations on the F1 axis. In general, the problem of finding 
principal components of p variables is to find the principal axis of the ellipsoid in a 
p-dimensional space.258 10 Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel Manipulators Based …

Factor analysis was introduced to reproduce the relationship between original vari￾ables and common factors (principle components) and to classify variables according 
to factors. The key of establishing factor model is to estimate factor loading matrix

(10.7) 
The purpose of factor analysis is not only to determine the principal components, 
but also to give reasonable explanation for the meaning of each common factor and 
give scientific analysis to actual engineering problem. Due to the non-uniqueness 
of the factor loading matrix, it is necessary to simplify the factor loading matrix 
so that each variable has a large loading in only one common factor to facilitate the10.2 Example 1: 3RPS PM 259
interpretation of the meaning of common factors. The maximum variance orthogonal 
rotation method is introduced in this work to simplify the factor loading matrix.

10.2 Example 1: 3RPS PM 
The 3RPS PM is taken as an example to implement the proposed optimization design 
method. Figure 10.3 shows a spatial 3-dof, 3RPS PM. Three identical limbs connect 
the moving platform at points Ai by spherical joints to the base at Bi by revolute 
joints. Each limb consists of a lower and an upper rod connected by a prismatic joint. 
These three prismatic joints are used as inputs to the mechanism. For the purpose of 
analysis, three coordinate frames O{X, Y, Z}, o{x, y, z}, and Bi{xi, yi, zi} are attached 
to the base, moving platform, and limb, respectively, as shown in Fig. 10.3. Both
ΔA1A2A3 and ΔB1B2B3 are equilateral triangles with |oA1| = |oA2| = |oA3| = r2 
and |O B1| = |O B2| = |O B3| = r1. Each axis of revolute joint lies on the X–Y 
plane and is perpendicular to the vector OBi. Geometric and physical parameters 
are given as: r1 = 1.7 m, r2 = 0.8 m, di = 0.4 m (diameter of the link), elasticity260 10 Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel Manipulators Based …

modulus E = 200 GPa, shear modulus G = 77 GPa, height of the moving platform h 
= 0.05 m. The purpose of the multi-objective optimization design of the 3RPS PM 
in this chapter is to select appropriate geometric parameters r1 and r2 to maximize 
the comprehensive performance of the mechanism. 
10.2.1 Performance Indices of the 3RPS PM 
• Performance index 1: workspace volume 
Compared with serial mechanism, PM has a smaller workspace. Therefore, maxi￾mizing the workspace volume should first be considered as one of the tasks for the 
optimization design of PMs. Since the reachable workspace is irregular, it is not 
conducive to trajectory planning and programming control, and some properties of 
the mechanism may be “ill-conditioned” at the boundary of the reachable workspace 
[10]. Therefore, the regular workspace volume is often used as the workspace eval￾uation index in engineering applications [11]. The regular drum-shaped workspace 
volume Vr of the 3RPS PM can be obtained by the method introduced in Sect. 7.2. 
The minimum radius of inscribed circles is set to 50 mm in this chapter to ensure the 
operation space of the 3RPS PM. 
• Performance index 2: kinematic performance index 
In this work, the motion/force transmission index is adopted as the kinematic perfor￾mance evaluation index; this index is dimensionless, relative to singularity, and 
frame-free with a value ranging from 0 to 1. The calculation procedure is briefly 
introduced as follows. 
The twist system of the ith limb can be obtained through screw theory.10.2 Example 1: 3RPS PM 261

Si5 = [

]
(10.11) 
where Ri is the transformation matrix from the limb coordinate frame {Bi} to 
the global coordinate frame {O}. e1 = [1 0 0]T, e2 = [0 1 0]T, and e3 = [0 0 
1]T. li is the unit vector along the vector BiAi. 
The transmission wrench of the ith limb can be obtained as follows. 
STi = [
li O Bi × li
] (10.12) 
The input twist screw of the ith limb is given as 
SAi = [
000 li
] (10.13) 
The instantaneous 1-DOF output twist screw SOi can be obtained by locking all 
of the inputs except the one in the ith limb. 
SOi ◦ Ui = 0 (10.14) 
where Ui is the constraint wrenches system of the mechanism when all of the inputs 
except the one in the ith limb are locked. 
Accordingly, the input and out transmission indices of the ith limb can be 
expressed as follows. 
λi = |STi ◦ SAi|
|STi ◦ SAi|max 
, ηi = |STi ◦ SOi|
|STi ◦ SOi|max 
(10.15) 
The LTI and GTI can thus be obtained through Eqs. (2.55) and (8.11). 
• Performance index 3: dynamic performance index 
The fundamental frequency is adopted as the dynamic index in this section to evaluate 
the dynamic performance of the 3RPS PM. The elastodynamic modeling should be 
established to analyze the dynamic performance of the mechanism. The global inde￾pendent generalized displacement coordinates (IGDC) method proposed by Yang 
et al. [12] is adopted to establish the elastodynamic modeling of the 3RPS PM; 
compared with the augmented Lagrange equation, this model is computationally 
efficient because the Lagrange multipliers are not required in this model. 
The results of Ref. [12] showed that the accuracy of the fundamental frequency can 
be guaranteed even if the member is discretized into one element, namely discretizing 
the member into more elements does not significantly improve the accuracy of 
fundamental frequency. 
Considering the link is discretized into one element, the elastodynamic equation 
of the ith link in the limb coordinate frame can be expressed as follows.262 10 Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel Manipulators Based …

displacement coordinates of point o can be obtained as follows.

The fundamental frequency and GDI of the 3RPS PM can thus be obtained through 
Eqs. (8.38) and (8.39).

Table 10.1 shows 276 sets of sample data designed based on the Latin hypercube 
sampling (LHS). Before calculating the principal components, it is necessary to stan￾dardize the samples to eliminate the possible adverse effects caused by non-uniform 
dimensions of objective functions. Table 10.2 shows the standardized sample data 
of objective functions of the 3RPS PM through Eq. (10.1). The correlation matrix of264 10 Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel Manipulators Based …
the objective functions obtained by Eq. (10.3) is shown in Table 10.3. The workspace 
volume is negatively correlated with both of motion/force transmission performance 
and dynamic performance, and kinematic performance and dynamic performance 
exhibit a strongly positive correlation, which is consistent with the results in Ref. [6]. 
Table 10.4 shows the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of correlation matrix and cumu￾lative contribution rate of principle component. The cumulative contribution rate of 
the first two eigenvalues reached 92.65% that is greater than 85% [14]; it means that 
the first two principle components basically contain the information of all objection 
functions. Accordingly, the first two principle components can be obtained through 
step (4) in Sect. 10.1.

In the expression of the first principal component, the coefficients of the second 
and third terms are larger, and these two indices play a major role. We can regard 
the first principal component as a comprehensive index reflecting the kinematic and 
dynamic performance of the mechanism. In the second principle component, the 
coefficient of the first term is the largest, which far exceeds the influence of the other 
two indices. It can be regarded as a comprehensive index that reflecting the influence 
of the workspace volume of the mechanism. 
Table 10.5 shows the factor loading matrix after orthogonal transformation. The 
kinematic and dynamic performance have larger factor loadings for the first prin￾ciple component; thus, the first principle can be named kinematic and dynamic 
performance factor, which reflects the kinematic and dynamic performance of the 
mechanism. The workspace volume has a larger factor loading for the second prin￾ciple component; thus, the second principle component can be named workspace 
factor, which reflects the workspace volume of the mechanism. So far, the physical

10.3 Example 2: 6PSS PM 
In order to further verify the effectiveness of the PCA optimization design method, 
a multi-objective optimization design, considering position workspace, posture 
workspace, and GPIs in which as objective functions, of a 6-DOF 6PSS PM is 
presented in this section. Structure description and kinematic analysis refer to 
Sect. 3.1.2.268 10 Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel Manipulators Based …
10.3.1 Performance Indices of the 6PSS PM 
• Performance index 1: workspace volume 
Compared with serial mechanism, PM has a smaller workspace. Therefore, maxi￾mizing the workspace volume should first be considered as one of the tasks for the 
optimization design of PMs. Since the reachable workspace is irregular, it is not 
conducive to trajectory planning and programming control, and some properties of 
the mechanism may be “ill-conditioned” at the boundary of the reachable workspace. 
Therefore, the regular workspace volume is often used as the workspace evaluation 
index in engineering applications. The main forms of the regular workspace mainly 
concern cuboids, ellipsoids, cylinders, and spheres. The most commonly used method 
for detecting the boundary of the regular workspace is to first give a larger workspace, 
and then use a step-by-step search method from the outside to the inside, which is 
computationally inefficient. In this chapter, a bisection method is proposed to accel￾erate the boundary convergence of the regular workspace. The detailed calculation 
process is given as follows: 
Step 1. Assign an initial large enveloped regular workspace with radius r1, and 
discrete it into n layers; and assume initial minimum boundary radius r2 = 0. 
Step 2. Assign the allowable computational error ea and the lower limitation of 
boundary rmin of the workspace. 
Step 3. Calculate boundary radius r = (r1 + r2)/2 and the error e = r1 − r2, and 
discrete the boundary into m nodes and perform kinematic analysis to these nodes. If 
these nodes all satisfy the mechanism constraints, then r2 = r, else r1 = r and force 
the error to be greater than the allowable error (e = e + ea). 
Step 4. Perform Step 3 until the error is less than or equal to the allowable error (e 
≤ ea), and ensure that the workspace boundary is greater than or equal to the given 
minimum boundary value (r ≥ rmin). 
Without loss of generality, Fig. 10.7 shows a schematic diagram of the square 
boundary of the ith layer of the regular workspace.
For the 6-DOF 6PSS PM with mixed DOFs, the workspace can be further 
divided into a position workspace (workspace with a constant posture) and a posture 
workspace (workspace with a constant position). To make the workspace representa￾tive, position workspace adopts the workspace without attitude deflection (α = 0, β
= 0, and γ = 0), and posture workspace adopts the workspace when the mechanism 
in the initial installation position (all the actuators in the home position). Consider 
the symmetry of the mechanism, the workspace composed of the square in each 
layer is adopted as the regular workspace. To ensure the operation workspace of the 
mechanism, the minimum position range for the x and y directions is set to be ±
50 mm, and the minimum posture range for α and β is set to be ± 7.5°. 
The regular workspace volume of the 6PSS PM composed of square on each layer 
is given as follows.10.3 Example 2: 6PSS PM 269

(Ai + Ai+1) ∗ Δz, (10.28) 
where Ai = bi 
2 are the area and width of the inscribed square in the ith layer, 
respectively. 
Consider L = 440 mm, rm = 250 mm, and La = 700 mm to verify the effectiveness 
of the proposed method to detect the boundary of regular workspace, the physical 
constraints of the mechanism are given as follows. 
qmin ≤ qi ≤ qmax; θi ≤ θmax, ϕi ≤ ϕmax (10.29) 
where qmin = 60 mm and qmax = 760 mm are the minimum and maximum actuator 
limits. θi and ϕi are the rotation angle of S joints connected to the base and moving 
platform relative to the initial installation position (home position), respectively. θmax 
= ϕmax = 50° are the maximum rotation angle of S joints connected to the base and 
moving platform, respectively. 
Consider the position workspace (all attitude angles are equal to zero). The search 
range of x, y, and z is defined as [−400 mm 400 mm], [−400 mm 400 mm], and 
[50 mm 500 mm], respectively. To observe the inscribed regular workspace, the step 
size of x, y, and z of the reachable workspace is defined as 0.2 mm, 0.2 mm, and 
10 mm, respectively. The allowable computational error ea = 0.2 mm, and the height 
interval Δz is 1 mm for the regular workspace. To ensure the operation workspace, 
the minimum side length in the x–y plane is set to 200 mm. Figure 10.8 shows that the 
regular squares at each layer are inscribed on the reachable boundary, which verify 
that the correctness of the bisection method proposed in this work. The calculation 
time of step-by-step method is 643.95 s, while the proposed bisection method takes270 10 Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel Manipulators Based …
only 10.65 s, reducing computational cost 98.35%, which verify the effectiveness of 
the propose method. 
• Performance index 2: kinematic performance index 
In this work, the motion/force transmission index is adopted as the kinematic perfor￾mance evaluation index; this index is dimensionless, relative to singularity, and 
frame-free with a value ranging from 0 to 1. The calculation procedure may be 
referred to Sect. 3.2.2. 
• Performance index 3: dynamic performance index 
The fundamental frequency is adopted as the dynamic performance evaluation index 
of the 6PSS PM. The elastodynamic modeling should be established to analyze 
the dynamic performance of the mechanism. The global independent generalized 
displacement coordinates (IGDC) method proposed by Yang et al. [12] is adopted to 
establish the elastodynamic modeling of the mechanism. 
Each linear actuator is discretized into two elements with three nodes; the 
displacement column vector of jth element of ith linear actuator is shown as follows.

in the local coordinate frame. Ldai, j (
Ldai, j+1) and Lϕai, j (
Lϕai, j+1) are the linear and 
angular displacement column vector of the jth (j + 1) node of the ith linear actuator 
in the local coordinate frame, respectively. 
The length of the first and second elements of the ith linear actuator are given as 
La − qi and qi, respectively. 
The kinematic energy and potential energies of the jth element of the ith linear 
actuator are given as follows.

10.3.2 Multi-objective Optimization Design of the 6PSS PM 
The 6PSS PM is 6-DOF PM, in order to study the influence of the position and 
posture on the mechanism performance. The multi-objective optimization design is 
classified into three categories: position workspace along with GPIs in which, posture 
workspace along with GPIs in which, and complete workspace along with GPIs in 
which. 
• Multi-objective optimization design 1: GPI in the position workspace 
A correct mathematical modeling reflecting the actual engineering requirements is 
the premise of dimensional synthesis in which performance indices can be used as 
objective functions, constraint functions, or both, such as the evaluation of kinematic 
and dynamic performance of robot for pick-and-place or machining operations on the 
prescribed trajectory; we can take the workspace as constraint function and kinematic 
and dynamic performance on the prescribed trajectory as objective functions. Without 
loss of generality, the mathematical modeling of the 6PSS PM for the multi-objective 
optimization design 1 is established by Eq. 9.49.10.3 Example 2: 6PSS PM 275

where Vt is the position workspace volume, GTIt and GDIt are GPIs in the position

respectively, which verify the correctness of the sample data. It means that the sample 
data can represent the characteristic of the population, and the analysis results of the 
sample data can be used for the subsequent explanation of the meaning of principal 
components and the dimensional synthesis of the PM. 
Table 10.13 shows the factor loading matrix after orthogonal transformation to 
give clear explanation of principle components. Each factor only corresponds to a few 
indices with larger factor loadings. In the first factor, GTIt and GDIt have large factor 
loadings, which reflect the mechanism performance in terms of performance indices 
in the position workspace. Thus, the first factor can be named position performance 
factor. In the second factor, Vt has large factor loadings and can be named position 
workspace factor. The meaning of each principle component is successfully identified 
by the factor analysis method.
The overall comprehensive performance evaluation index can thus be obtained by 
Eq. (10.6) as follows.

10.4 Summary 
The results of multi-objective optimization design have an important influence on the 
comprehensive performance of PMs. However, due to the non-uniform dimensions 
of multiple performance indices and the subjectivity of weight factors, it is difficult to 
obtain the optimal comprehensive performance of the mechanism with clear physical 
significance. Meanwhile, the high computational cost of GPIs significantly under￾mines the efficiency of multi-objective optimization design of PMs. In this chapter, 
a multi-objective optimization design method combining with PSO algorithm, PCA, 
and neural network was introduced to solve these problems. The method can achieve 
dimensionally reduction and efficient acquisition of optimal comprehensive perfor￾mance with clear physical meaning. The principal components and corresponding 
weight factors of the comprehensive index are equivalent to the direction and ampli￾tude of principal axes of the ellipsoid. Physical explanations of the principle compo￾nents were provided based on the factor analysis. Meanwhile, a bisection method 
was introduced to accelerate the detection of the workspace boundary to improve the 
computational cost of GPIs. 
1. An overall comprehensive index that can reflect the comprehensive performance 
of the PM with clear physical explanation was constructed using variance￾based PCA method. The method can realize the dimensionality reduction ofReferences 285
the multiple performance indices. The principal components and corresponding 
weight factors of the comprehensive index are equivalent to the direction and 
amplitude of principal axes of the ellipsoid. A multi-objective optimization design 
method based on the PCA and BP neural network was introduced to transform 
multi-objective optimization to single-objective optimization and improve the 
efficiency of optimization design. 
2. A 3-DOF 3RPS PM and a 6-DOF 6PSS PM were taken as two examples for the 
analysis and discussion. Compared with that of before optimization, the overall 
comprehensive performance of the 3RPS mechanism increased by 118.92%, 
and workspace volume, kinematic, and dynamic performance were increased by 
283.69, 6.74, and 44.57%, respectively. And the computational cost was reduced 
96.95% compared with using PSO algorithm. For the multi-objective optimiza￾tion design of position workspace along with GPIs in which of the 6PSS PM, the 
overall comprehensive index F increased by 241.63%, the position workspace 
volume decreased 8.74%, and kinematic performance and dynamic performance 
increased by 9.21 and 9.70%, respectively. For the multi-objective optimization 
design of posture workspace along with GPIs in which of the 6PSS PM, the 
overall comprehensive index F increases by 236.97%; the posture workspace 
volume, kinematic performance, and dynamic performance increase by 105.44, 
18.05, and 10.38%, respectively. For the multi-objective optimization design of 
position workspace, posture workspace, and GPIs in both workspaces of the 6PSS 
PM, the overall comprehensive index F increased by 502.16%, GTIt decreased 
by 4.26%, and Vr, Vt, GTIr, GDIr, and GDIt increased by 105.44, 21.48, 18.05, 
10.38, and 3.33%, respectively.

Multi-objective Optimization Design 
of Parallel Manipulators Based 
on the Intelligent-Direct Search 
Algorithm 
It is necessary to obtain more non-dominated solutions for multi-objective optimiza￾tion design of parallel manipulators (PMs) in actual engineering environment, the 
traditional optimization design method achieves this goal by increasing the number 
of population size, and however, this leads to an exponential increase in computa￾tional cost. Therefore, developing methods that increase the population size without 
causing a significant increase in computational cost is currently a major task [1]. 
In this chapter, a hybrid algorithm combined with intelligent and direct search 
algorithms is presented to fix this problem. And, a procedure for direct search algo￾rithm to determine the Pareto optimal front based on the concept of non-dominated 
solutions is proposed. Multi-objective optimization design of the 2UPR-RPU PM is 
taken as an example here for the analysis and discussion. Compared with 80 sets 
of non-dominated solutions obtained by the intelligent optimization algorithm, the 
presented method obtained 242 sets of solutions with better results, which verify the 
effectiveness of the presented algorithm in this chapter.

solutions 
where f i is the ith objective function; Gi the equality constraint; Hi the inequality 
constraint; x the design parameter, and xmin and xmax denote the lower and upper 
boundary, respectively. 
The purpose of Pareto optimal front is to get a set of non-dominated solutions, 
which is a set of solutions that are not dominated by any other solutions among all 
the solutions. The non-dominated solutions of the entire feasible decision space are 
called the Pareto optimal set. The boundary defined by the set of points mapped 
from the Pareto optimal set is called Pareto optimal front. Figure 11.1 shows the 
schematic diagram of non-dominated solutions for two objective functions, and the 
red line indicates the non-dominated solutions. a and b are clearly non-dominated 
solution points because an improvement in objective f 1, requires a degradation in 
the other objective f 2, namely, f 1(b)> f 1(a), and f 2(b)< f 2(a). 
11.1.2 Procedure of the Intelligent-Direct Search Algorithm 
The intelligent optimization algorithm has the ability of global optimization, 
however, poor local optimization, low search efficiency, slow convergence speed 
in the later stage of evolution, and exponential increase in computational cost while 
increasing the population size are its main disadvantages. To fix these problems, 
the hybrid algorithm of intelligent-direct search is presented in this chapter. The 
procedure of the proposed algorithm can be summarized as the following three steps. 
Step 1. Direct search algorithm: coarse meshing. 
The design parameter space is coarsely meshed into n discrete points, and the approx￾imate amplitude of objective function corresponding to each point is computed, and 
the results are then used to transform objective functions to be of same order and 
dimensionless [2].11.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 289
fi = GPIi − GPIi min 
GPIi max − GPIi min 
, (11.2) 
where GPIimax and GPIimin are maximum and minimum of the ith global performance 
index (GPI) obtained from coarse meshing, respectively. 
Step 2. Intelligent optimization algorithm. 
After objective functions are dimensionless, the multi-objective intelligent opti￾mization algorithm is used to obtain the Pareto front and Pareto optimal set of the 
multi-objective optimization problem of PMs. The PSO algorithm is adopted as the 
optimization algorithm in this work due to its faster convergence [3]. 
Step 3. Direct search algorithm: fine meshing. 
Inspired by the concept of Pareto front surface, the neighborhood of the Pareto 
optimal set is refined to obtain more non-dominated solutions closer to the real 
Pareto front, which will be discussed in detail in the Sect. 11.2. 
Figure 11.2 shows the procedure of the calculation of non-dominated solutions. 
Taking the maximization of objective functions as an example, suppose there are n 
functions, if Eq. 10.3 is satisfied, we call f (i) = [f 1(i),…, f n(i)] is dominated by f (j), 
vice versa.

There are n ×(n−1)×…×1+1 equations in Eq. 11.3. All sets of non-dominated 
solutions obtained by Eq. 11.3 form the Pareto optimal front. 
11.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 
The multi-objective optimization design of the 2UPR-RPU PM is taken as an example 
to implement the presented hybrid algorithm. Structural description and kinematic

11.2.1 Performance Indices of the 2UPR-RPU PM 
• Performance index 1: regular workspace volume 
Compared with serial mechanisms, one of the disadvantages of PMs is its smaller 
workspace. Thus, the regular workspace volume is considered as one of the objective 
functions in this chapter. Since the shape and size of the reachable workspace are 
irregular that is not conducive to the trajectory planning and algorithm control, so the 
regular cylinder volume is adopted as the workspace index. To ensure the reference 
point of the end effector can reach the desired orientation, the minimum radius of 
the circular cross section is set to 8°
. The geometrical constraints and the procedure 
of calculating the regular workspace refer to Sect. 7.2.1, the equation of regular 
workspace volume refer to Eq. 7.3.11.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 291
• Performance index 2: kinematic performance 
The Jacobian matrix is often adopted as the kinematic performance evaluation index 
[4–6]. However, the disadvantages of the Jacobian matrix are non-uniform dimension 
and related to coordinate frame, which leads to its physical meaning is unclear. The 
motion/force transmission index proposed by Liu [7] is adopted in this chapter as 
one of the objective functions, which is defined as the efficiency of the mechanism 
from input to output, and it is frame-free and relative to singularity. This index is 
composed of two parts: 
⎧

|
|
max 
ηi =
|
|NTi ◦ $Oi
|
|
|
|NTi ◦ $Oi
|
|

, (11.4) 
where λi is the input transmission index (ITI), which measures the efficiency of 
energy from actuator joints to limbs, ηi is the output transmission index (OTI), which 
measures efficiency of energy from limbs to the output. NTi is the unit transmission 
wrench screw; $Ai the unit input twist screw; $Oi the unit output twist screw. 
LTI can be obtained using Eq. 4.11. LTI only reflects the kinematic performance 
of the mechanism under a given configuration; in order to evaluate the kinematic 
performance in the regular workspace, the global transmission index (GTI) is defined 
in Eq. 7.16. 
• Performance index 3: Stiffness Performance 
Compared with serial mechanisms, the excellent stiffness performance is one of the 
advantages of PMs. In order to evaluate the stiffness performance of PMs, the overall 
stiffness matrix of the mechanism should be obtained first and then converted into 
quantifiable stiffness indices. 
The overall stiffness matrix of the 2UPR-RPU PM can be expressed as

where K is the overall stiffness matrix; Ki the limb stiffness matrix; Ji the constraint 
wrenches of the ith limb. The process of the elastostatic stiffness modeling can be 
found in Ref. [8]. 
The comprehensive stiffness index (CSI) [2] decouples the diagonal and non￾diagonal elements and separates the linear stiffness and angular stiffness, and the 
physical meaning is clear; thus, it is adopted in our work. 
The CSI is briefly reviewed as follows. The mapping relationship between the 
external wrench and elastic deformation is given by: 
δ = CW , (11.6)292 11 Multi-objective Optimization Design of Parallel Manipulators Based …
where δ = [δd ; δϕ] is the elastic deformation, δd and δϕ are the translational and 
rotational deflections, respectively. C is the overall compliance matrix; W = [nf ; 
nm] the external wrench, nf and nm are the force and moment, respectively. 
The compliance matrix can be expressed as flows: 
C =
[
C11 C12 
C21 C22 ]
, (11.7) 
where C11, C12, C21, and C22 represent the 3 × 3 submatrix; the units are m/N, m/N 
m, rad/N, and rad/N m, respectively. 
In most cases, engineers pay more attention to the linear deflection of the mecha￾nism resistant of a force. The translational and rotational deflections resistant of the 
force can be obtained as follows:
{
δdf = C11n f 
δϕ f = C21n f 
, (11.8) 
where δdf and δϕf are the translational and rotational deflections resistant of the force, 
respectively. 
The linear stiffness performance along the z-axis of the 2UPR-RPU PM is adopted 
as one of the objective functions here. 
kdf z = 1

, (11.9) 
where kdfz is the local CSI reflect the linear stiffness resistant a unit force along the 
z-axis direction in the Cartesian coordinate system. δdfz the translational deflection 
resistant of a unit force along the z-axis direction. 
The global CSI can thus be defined as follows:

11.2.2 Multi-objective Optimization Design 
of the 2UPR-RPU PM 
In order to verify the presented hybrid algorithm, three-objective optimization design 
of the 2UPR-RPU PM are considered in our work, namely Kdfz versus Vr versus GTI. 
Consider x = [r1, r2, r3] as design parameters. The multi-objective optimization 
problem of the 2UPR-RPU PM is given as follows:11.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 293
max { f1, f2, f3}
subject to 
r3 − r1 < 0 
0.3 ≤ r1 ≤ 0.6 
0.3 ≤ r2 ≤ 0.6 
0.2 ≤ r3 ≤ 0.6 
(11.11) 
The step size of the coarse grid is set to 0.05 m. The maximum and minimum 
of the GPIs corresponding to the discrete points are obtained as follows: Kdfz min =
4.657 × 108 N/m, Kdfzmax = 9.940 × 108 N/m, Vrmin = 0.027 rad2 m, Vrmax = 0.165 
rad2 m, GTImin = 0.411, and GTImax = 0.760. According to Eq. 11.2, the objective 
functions are defined as follows. 
f1 = Kdf z − Kdf z min 
Kdf z max − Kdf z min 
, f2 = Vr − Vr min 
Vr max − Vr min 
, f3 = GTI (11.12) 
Figure 11.3 shows the optimal Pareto front of three objective functions and optimal 
design parameters. 80 non-dominated solutions are obtained in 57,362 s on a desk 
computer with a 3.00-GHz CPU considering the number of population size is 200 with 
paretofraction is 0.4. Figure 11.3a shows the hypersurface stretched by the optimal 
design parameter space. In order to obtain more non-dominated solutions, the ± 0.1 
interval of the optimal design parameter neighborhood is refined in step size 0.005 m. 
The procedure proposed in Fig. 11.2 is used to obtain a total of 242 sets of non￾dominated solutions in 18,329 s. Figure 11.4 shows the comparison of Pareto front 
obtained by the hybrid and PSO algorithms. The presented hybrid algorithm not only 
got more non-dominated solutions without significantly increasing the computational 
cost but also closer to the real Pareto front. 
Taking two cases on the Pareto front shown in Fig. 11.4a as examples, Table 11.1 
shows the comparison results of the two cases. Compared with the results of PSO 
algorithm, for case 1, Kdfz and GTI of hybrid algorithm increased by 7.54 and 2.00%,

respectively, while the regular workspace volume does not decrease; for case 2, Kdfz 
and GTI of hybrid algorithm increased by 25.48 and 0.66%, respectively, while the 
regular workspace volume does not decrease. For a more intuitive comparison of 
changes in the optimization results of two optimization algorithms, the change ratio 
is defined as follows: 
μ = LPI,

LPIi 
⇒

μkz = k,

μLTI = LTI,
LTI 
(11.13)
where μ is the change ratio, and LPIi’ and LPIi denote the results of the local 
performance index obtained by hybrid and PSO algorithms, respectively. 
Figure 11.5 shows the μ distribution of the case 1 in the middle plane 
z = − 0.63 m. It can be found that the optimized LTI is improved for all configura￾tions in the middle plane, the maximum of the optimized kdfz increased by 25%. It is 
worth noting that the stiffness performance corresponding to some points is degraded, 
which means that the improvement of the global stiffness performance does not mean 
that the improvement of stiffness performance for all configurations in the regular 
workspace. However, overall, the optimization results of hybrid algorithm are better 
than those of PSO algorithm.11.2 Example: 2UPR-RPU PM 295

11.3 Summary 
With the wide application of intelligent optimization algorithm in the multi-objective 
optimization design of PMs, its disadvantages are gradually revealed, such as prema￾ture maturity, slow convergence rate in the late stage, and the significant increase 
in computational cost with the increasing of the population size. To obtain more 
non-dominated solutions closer to the real Pareto front, a larger population size and 
iterations are required, which will lead to an exponential increase in computational 
cost. How to intuitively and efficiently get more non-dominated solutions closer to 
the real Pareto front without significantly increasing the computational cost is an 
urgent problem to be solved in engineering. 
This chapter presented a hybrid algorithm that used a direct search algorithm to 
further optimize the results by refining the grid of the results obtained by the intelli￾gent optimization algorithm and a procedure for direct search algorithm to identify the 
non-dominated solutions. With the hybrid algorithm, more non-dominated solutions 
closer to the real Pareto front can thus be obtained without significantly increasing 
the computational cost. The multi-objective optimization design of the 2UPR-RPU 
PM is taken as an example to implement the proposed algorithm. Compared with 80 
sets of non-dominated solutions obtained by the PSO algorithm, 242 sets of solu￾tions closer to the real Pareto front were obtained by the hybrid algorithm. In the two 
cases of non-dominated solutions, compared with that of PSO algorithm, the Kdfz 
increased 7.54 and 25.48%, GTI increased 2.00 and 0.66%, respectively, while the 
Vr did not decrease. It verifies the effectiveness of the presented hybrid algorithm.
