viiPreface
This manuscript is an extension and update from Oil Field Chemicals, which
appeared in 2003. The text focuses mainly on the organic chemistry of oil field
chemicals. As indicated by the title, preferably engineers with less background in
organic chemistry will use this text. Therefore, various sketches of the chemicals and
additional explanations and comments are included in the text to those an educated
organic chemist is certainly familiar.
The material presented here is a compilation from the literature, including patents.
The text is arranged in the order as needed by a typical job. It starts with drilling fluids
and related applications, such as fluid loss, bit lubricants, etc. Then it crosses over to
the next major topics, cementing, fracturing, enhanced recovery, and it ends with
pipelines and spill.
Some of the chemicals are used in more than one main field. For example,
surfactants are used in nearly all of the applications. The last three chapters
are devoted to these chemicals. As environmental aspects are gaining increasing
importance, this issue is also dealt carefully.
HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
Index
There are three indices: an index of acronyms, an index of chemicals, and a general
index.
In a chapter, if an acronym is occurring the first time, it is expanded to long form
and to short form, for example, acrylic acid (AA) and placed in the index. If it occurs
afterwards it is given in the short form only, i.e., AA. If the term occurs only once in
a specific chapter, it is given exclusively in the long form.
In the chemical index, bold face page numbers refer to the sketches of structural
formulas or to equations which refer reactions.
Bibliography
The bibliography is given per chapter and is sorted in the order of occurrence. After
the bibliography, a list of tradenames that are found in the references and which
chemicals are behind these names, as far as laid open is added.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The continuous interest and the promotion by Professor Wolfgang Kern, the head of the
department is highly appreciated. I am indebted to our university librarians, Dr. Christian
ixx Preface
Hasenhüttl, Dr. Johann Delanoy, Franz Jurek, Margit Keshmiri, Dolores Knabl, Friedrich
Scheer, Christian Slamenik, and Renate Tschabuschnig for their support in the acquisition of
literature. This book could not have been otherwise compiled. Thanks are given to Professor
I. Lakatos, University of Miskolc who directed my interest to this topic.

1 Drilling muds
According to American Petroleum Institute (API), a drilling fluid is defined as a
circulating fluid used in rotary drilling to perform any or all of the various functions
required in drilling operations.
Drilling fluids are mixtures of natural and synthetic chemical compounds used to
cool and lubricate the drill bit, clean the hole bottom, carry cuttings to the surface,
control formation pressures, and improve the function of the drill string and tools in
the hole. They are divided into two general types: water-based drilling muds (WBMs)
and oil-based drilling muds (OBMs). The type of fluid base used depends on drilling
and formation needs, as well as the requirements for disposition of the fluid after it
is no longer needed. Drilling muds are a special class of drilling fluids used to drill
most deep wells. Mud refers to the thick consistency of the formulation.
Drilling fluids serve several fundamental functions [1,2]:
• control of downhole formation pressures,
• overcoming the fluid pressure of the formation,
• avoiding damage of the producing formation,
• removal of cuttings generated by the drill bit from the borehole, and
• cooling and lubricating of the drill bit.
In addition to these fundamental functions of drilling fluids, drilling fluids
preferably possess several desirable characteristics which can greatly enhance the
efficiency of the drilling operation.
To perform these functions, an efficient drilling fluid must exhibit numerous
characteristics, such as desired rheological properties (plastic viscosity, yield value,
low-end rheology, and gel strengths), fluid loss prevention, stability under various
temperature and pressure operating conditions, stability against contaminating fluids,
such as salt water, calcium sulfate, cement, and potassium contaminated fluids [1].
Preferably, the drilling fluid exhibits penetration enhancement characteristics, by
having physical properties, which wet the drill string and keep the cutting surfaces of
the drill bit (whether of the roller cone or other configuration) clean.
The wetting attribute is at least in part a function of the surface tension of the
fluid. The drilling fluid also preferably has a high degree of lubricity, to minimize
friction between the drill string and the wall of the borehole, an extremely valuable
result being the minimizing of differential sticking. In this situation, the hydrostatic
pressure of the drilling fluid column is sufficiently higher than the formation pressure
so that the drill string is forced against the wall of the borehole and stuck.

12 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
Yet another desirable characteristic is the prevention from swelling of the solids
of the formation, that is, primarily clays and shales, which further reduces incidents
of drill string sticking, undergauge holes, etc. Inhibition of clay swelling, in general,
results from preventing the clays from adsorbing water.
1.1 CLASSIFICATION OF MUDS
The classification of drilling muds is based on their fluid phase alkalinity, dispersion,
and the type of chemicals used. The classification according to Lyons [3] is
reproduced in Table 1.1.
Drilling muds are usually classified as either WBMs or OBMs, depending upon
the character of the continuous phase of the mud. However, WBMs may contain oil
and OBMs may contain water [4].
OBMs generally use hydrocarbon oil as the main liquid component with other
materials such as clays or colloidal asphalts added to provide the desired viscosity
together with emulsifiers, polymers, and other additives including weighting agents.
Water may also be present, but in an amount not usually greater than 50 volume
percent of the entire composition. If more than about 5% of water is present, the mud
is often referred to as an invert emulsion, that is, water-in-oil emulsion.
WBMs conventionally contain viscosifiers, fluid loss control agents, weighting
agents, lubricants, emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, salts, and pH control agents. The
water makes up the continuous phase of the mud and is usually present in any amount
of at least 50 volume percent of the entire composition. Oil is also usually present in
minor amounts but will typically not exceed the amount of the water so that the mud
will retain its character as a water-continuous phase material.
Potassium muds are the most widely accepted water mud system for drilling
water sensitive shales. K+ ions attach to clay surfaces and lend stability to shale

exposed to drilling fluids by the bit. The ions also help hold the cuttings together,
minimizing dispersion into finer particles. Potassium chloride, KCl, is the most
widely used potassium source. Others are potassium acetate, potassium carbonate,
potassium lignite, potassium hydroxide, and potassium salt of partially hydrolyzed
poly(acrylamide) (PHPA). For rheology control, different types of polymers are used,
for example, xanthan gum and PHPA. For fluid loss control, mixtures of starch and
polyanionic cellulose (PAC) are often used. Carboxymethyl starch, hydroxypropyl
starch, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and sodium poly(acrylate) are also used.
PHPA is widely used for shale encapsulation.
Salt water muds contain varying amounts of dissolved sodium chloride (NaCl) as
a major component. Undissolved salt may also be present in saturated salt muds to
increase density or to act as a bridging agent over permeable zones. Starch and starch
derivatives for fluid loss control and xanthan gums for hole cleaning are among the
few highly effective additives for salt water muds.
Sea water mud is a WBM designed for offshore drilling whose make-up water
is taken from the ocean. Sea water has a relatively low salinity, containing about
3-4% of NaCl, but has a high hardness because of Mg+2 and Ca+2 ions. Hardness
is removed from sea water by adding NaOH, which precipitates Mg+2 as Mg(OH)2
and by adding Na2CO3, which removes Ca+2 as CaCO3. Mud additives are the same
as those used in fresh water muds [4]:
• bentonite clay,
• lignosulfonate,
• lignite,
• CMC, or
• PAC, and
• caustic soda.
Xanthan gum may also be used in place of bentonite. Silicate-mud is a type of
shale-inhibitive water mud that contains sodium or potassium silicate as the inhibitive
component. High pH is a necessary characteristic of silicate muds to control the
amount and type of polysilicates that are formed. The pH of the mud is controlled
by addition of NaOH (or KOH) and the appropriate silicate solution. Silicate anions
and colloidal silica gel combine to stabilize the wellbore by sealing microfractures,
forming a silica layer on shales and possibly acting as an osmotic membrane, which
can produce in-gauge holes through troublesome shale sections that otherwise might
require an oil mud.
Lime mud is a type of WBM that is saturated with lime, Ca(OH)2, and has excess,
undissolved lime solids maintained in reserve. Fluid loss additives include starch,
hydroxypropyl starch, CMC, or PAC [4].
1.1.1 DISPERSED NONINHIBITED SYSTEMS
Drilling fluids used in the upper hole sections are referred to as dispersed noninhib￾ited systems. They are formulated from fresh water and may contain bentonite. The4 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

classification of bentonite-based muds is shown in Table 1.2. The flow properties are
controlled by a flocculant or thinner, and the fluid loss is controlled with bentonite
and CMC.
API bentonite drilling fluid
API bentonite is a key ingredient of drilling muds [5]. It displays a negative zeta
potential across the whole pH range of 2.5-12.3. It contains two very rheological
active ingredients: sodium montmorillonite or Na + Mt of 40.4% and needle-shape
sepiolite of 16%. Due to the interplay of these two ingredients, the rheological
behavior displayed by the API bentonite suspensions is quite different to that of other
bentonite suspensions.
The gel displayed a very low or no yield stress at low acidic pH and a maximum
yield stress at pH 8-12.
Magnesium leaching from sepiolite at low pH and its hydrolysis play a role in
affecting the rheological properties at high pH. Yield stress and aging behavior were
observed in suspensions with at least 3% solids.
The Herschel-Bulkley model described the flow behavior of these gels. Both the
Herschel-Bulkley yield stress and viscosity at a fixed shear rate of the 7% gel peaked
at pH 8.5 and were smallest at a pH of 5.2. The aging or structural recovery behavior
is most pronounced at a high pH for the most concentrated gels.
Both the Leong and Nguyen-Boger aging models described the structural recov￾ery behavior well. The recovery of the recently discovered very open honeycomb
structure formed by Na + MT gel, after breakdown by shear, was invoked to explain
the aging behavior [5].
1.1.2 PHOSPHATE-TREATED MUDS
Phosphates are effective only in small concentrations. The mud temperature must be
less than 55 ◦C. The salt contamination must be less than 500 ppm sodium chloride.
The concentration of calcium ions should be kept as low as possible. The pH should
be between 8 and 9.5. Some phosphates may decrease the pH, so adding more NaOH
is required.1.1 Classification of muds 5
1.1.3 LIGNITE MUDS
Lignite muds are high-temperature resistant up to 230 ◦C. Lignite can control
viscosity, gel strength, and fluid loss. The total hardness must be lower than 20 ppm.
1.1.4 QUEBRACHO MUDS
Quebracho is a natural product extracted from the heartwood of the Schinopsis trees
that grow in Argentina and Paraguay. Quebracho is a well characterized polyphenolic
and is readily extracted from the wood by hot water. Quebracho is widely used as a
tanning agent. It is also used as a mineral dressing, as a dispersant in drilling muds,
and in wood glues. Quebracho is commercially available as a crude hot water extract,
either in lump, ground, or spray-dried form, or as a bisulfite treated spray-dried
product that is completely soluble in cold water. Quebracho is also available in a
bleached form, which can be used in applications where the dark color of unbleached
quebracho is undesirable [6].
Quebracho-treated fresh water muds were used in shallow depths. It is also
referred to as red mud because of the deep red color. Quebracho acts as a thinner.
Poly(phosphate)s are also added when quebracho is used. Quebracho is active at low
concentrations and consists of tannates.
1.1.5 LIGNOSULFONATE MUDS
Lignosulfonate fresh water muds contain ferrochrome lignosulfonate for viscosity
and gel strength control. These muds are resistant to most types of drilling contami￾nation because of the thinning efficiency of the lignosulfonate in the presence of large
amounts of salt and extreme hardness.
1.1.6 LIME MUDS
Lime muds contain caustic soda, an organic thinner, hydrated lime, and a colloid
for filtrate loss. From this a pH of 11.8 can result, with 3-20 ppm calcium ions in
the filtrate. Lime muds exhibit low viscosity, low gel strength, and good suspension
of weighting agents. They can carry a larger concentration of clay solids at lower
viscosities than other types of mud. At high temperatures, lime muds present a danger
of gelation.
1.1.7 SEA WATER MUDS
The average composition of sea water is shown in Table 1.3. Sea water muds have
sodium chloride concentrations above 10,000 ppm. Most of the hardness in sea
water is caused by magnesium. Sea water muds are composed of bentonite, thinner
(lignosulfonate or lignosulfonate with lignite), and an organic filtration control agent.6 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
Table 1.3 Composition of Sea Water
Component Concentration (ppm)
Sodium 10,500
Potassium 400
Magnesium 300
Calcium 400
Chloride 19,000
Sulfate 3000
1.1.8 NONDISPERSED NONINHIBITED SYSTEMS
In nondispersed systems no special agents are added to deflocculate the solids in the
fluid. The main advantages of these systems are the higher viscosities and the higher
yield point-to-plastics viscosity ratio. These alterated flow properties provide a better
cleaning of the borehole, allow a lower annular circulating rate, and minimize the
washout of the borehole.
1.1.9 LOW-SOLIDS FRESH WATER MUDS
Clear fresh water is the best drilling fluid in terms of penetration rate. Therefore,
it is desirable to achieve a maximal drilling rate using a minimal amount of solid
additives. Originally, low-solids mud formulations were used in hard formations, but
they now also tend to find use in other formations. Several types of flocculants are
used to promote the settling of drilled solids by flocculation.
1.1.10 VARIABLE DENSITY FLUIDS
Variable density fluids are those that having a density that varies as a function of
pressure into the subterranean formation. Such a fluid comprises a base fluid and a
portion of elastic particles.
The presence of the elastic particles in a variable density fluid allows the density
of the variable density fluid to vary as a function of pressure. For instance, as
the elastic particles encounter higher downhole pressures, they compress, thereby
lowering their volume. The reduction in the volume of the elastic particles in turn
increases the density of the variable density fluid.
When the elastic particles are fully compressed, the density increases consid￾erably. The increase in volume of the elastic particles in turn reduces the overall
density of the variable density drilling fluid. The resulting change in density may be
sufficient to permit the return of the variable density fluid through the riser to the
surface without any additional pumps or subsurface additives [7].
The elastic particles can be a copolymer of styrene and divinylbenzene, a
copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile, or a terpolymer of styrene, vinylidene
chloride, and acrylonitrile [7].1.1 Classification of muds 7
Glass bubble additives
The use of materials known as hollow glass spheres, also known as glass bubbles, has
been studied to reduce the drilling fluid density below the base fluid density without
introducing a compressible phase to the wellbore [8].
Four types of lightweight glass spheres with different physical properties were
tested for their impact on rheological behavior, density reduction effect, survival ratio
at elevated pressures, and hydraulic drag reduction effect when mixed with water￾based fluids. A Fann75 high-pressure, high-temperature viscometer and a flow loop
were used for the experiments.
The glass bubbles had a specific gravity range of 0.38-0.60 and a collapse pressure
range of 34-124 MPa. The mean diameters of the tested materials measured range
from 21 to 44 μm as measured with a particle size analyzer.
The results showed that glass spheres successfully reduce the density of the base
drilling fluid while maintaining an average of 0.93 survival ratio. The rheological
behavior of the tested fluids at elevated concentrations of glass bubbles is similar to
the rheological behavior of conventional drilling fluids and hydraulic drag reduction
is present up to certain concentrations.
All these results were integrated into hydraulics calculations for a wellbore
scenario that accounts for the effect of temperature and pressure on rheological
properties, as well as the effect of glass bubble concentration on mud temperature
distribution along the wellbore. The effect of drag reduction was also considered in
the calculations [8].
1.1.11 GAS-BASED MUDS
Although natural gas (methane) exhaust or other combustion gases can be used, air is
most common in such drilling fluids. Air is used to produce the so called foam muds
in which air bubbles are surrounded by a film of water containing a foam-stabilizing
substance or film-strengthening materials, such as organic polymers or bentonite.
This type of mud is not recirculated and is particularly used for reduced-pressure
drilling to improve the hole stability in caving formations. However, this type of mud
has some limitations with respect to drilling water producing or wet formations, as
well as a limited salt tolerance.
1.1.12 DRILL-IN FLUIDS
After drilling a well to the total depth, it is a normal practice to replace the drilling
mud with a completion fluid. This fluid is a clean, solids-free, or acid soluble,
nondamaging formulation, intended to minimize reductions in permeability of the
producing zone. Prior to producing from the formation, it is usually necessary to
cleanup what is left by the original mud and the completion fluid, by breaking and
degrading the filter cake with an oxidizer, enzyme, or an acid solution.
Nowadays, many wells exploit the pay-zone formations horizontally and for
long distances. It is no longer practical in these wells to drill the pay-zone with8 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
conventional solids-laden muds as the extended cleanup process afterwards is
much more difficult. Consequently, the modern generation of drill-in fluids were
developed.
Heavy brine completion fluids
Drill-in fluids are drilling fluids used in drilling through a hydrocarbon producing
zone, also addressed as a pay-zone [9]. Completion fluids are fluids used in com￾pleting or working over a well. Completion operations normally include perforating
the casing and setting the tubing and pumps prior to, and to facilitate, initiation of
production in hydrocarbon recovery operations.
As the pay-zone is penetrated horizontally, these fluids must provide the multi￾functional requirements of drilling fluids in addition to the nondamaging attributes
of completion fluids. In practice, the normal drilling mud is replaced with a drill-in
fluid just before the pay-zone is penetrated, and used until the end of the operations.
Choosing the right completion fluid is important because inappropriate fluids can
have a significant impact on a project, not only during completion operations and
well production startup, but also throughout the well’s productive life. Experience
has shown that some completion practices that work well in one location, but may
not work well in a different location.
The importance of using clear completion and workover fluids to minimize
formation damage is well recognized and the use of clear heavy brines as completion
fluids is now widespread [9].
Most heavy brines used by the oil and gas industry are calcium halide brines,
particularly calcium chloride or calcium bromide brines, or formate brines. How￾ever, halide brines can cause structural failure in corrosion resistant alloys, and
chloride and bromide brines in particular are known to cause pitting corrosion
and stress corrosion cracking of corrosion resistant alloys if oxygen or carbon
dioxide is present. In contrast, formate brines do not cause such corrosion and
cracking but are more costly to purchase and have some solubility problems at high
density.
A phosphate based heavy brine drill-in or completion fluid has been described
[9]. The fluid is prepared with a phosphate brine, preferably consisting essentially of
water with phosphates dissolved therein, preferably in a quantity ranging from about
1.2-2.4 kg l−1.
Such a phosphate solution may be economically obtained from waste product
from a sewage treatment plant, for example. This phosphate solution in turn is
blended with water, preferably fresh water although sea water might alternatively
be used, in a quantity such that the phosphate solution comprises more or less of the
blend or even approximately half of the blend.
Also, corrosion inhibitors and clay inhibitors may be added to the blend, although
the fluid is less corrosive without inhibitors than calcium halide brines. Nonamine
based corrosion inhibitors designed to prevent oxygen corrosion in monovalent brines
are most effective [9].1.2 Mud compositions 9
1.2 MUD COMPOSITIONS
Commercial products are listed in the literature. These include bactericides, corrosion
inhibitors, defoamers, emulsifiers, fluid loss and viscosity control agents, and shale
control additives [10–14].
The chemical issues of drilling fluids have been discussed in a chapter of a
monograph [15]. The major contents in this chapter include the functions and
compositions of drilling fluid, the density of drilling fluid and its adjustment, the
acid-base property of drilling fluid and its control, the filtration property of drilling
fluid and its control, the rheological property of drilling fluid and its adjustment, the
solid phase and its content control in drilling fluid, the lubricity of drilling fluid and
its improvement, the borehole wall stability and its control, the sticking and stuck￾freeing of drilling tools, the leakage of drilling fluid and the plugging of adsorbent
formation, and a brief introduction to the main drilling fluid systems.
1.2.1 INHIBITIVE WATER-BASED MUDS
Minimizing the environmental impact of the drilling process is a highly important
part of drilling operations to comply with environmental regulations that have
become stricter throughout the world. In fact, this is a mandatory requirement for
the North Sea sector. The drilling fluids industry has made significant progress
in developing new drilling fluids and ancillary additives that fulfill the increasing
technical demands for drilling oil wells. These additives have very little or no adverse
effects on the environment or on drilling economics.
New drilling fluid technologies have been developed to allow the continuation
of oil-based performance with regard to formation damage, lubricity and wellbore
stability aspects and thus penetration rates. These aspects were greatly improved by
incorporating polyols or silicates as shale inhibitors in the fluid systems.
Polyols based fluids contain a glycol or glycerol as a shale inhibitor. These polyols
are commonly used in conjunction with conventional anionic and cationic fluids to
provide additional inhibition of swelling and dispersing of shales. They also provide
some lubrication properties.
Sodium silicates or potassium silicates are known to provide levels of shale
inhibition comparable to that of OBMs. This type of fluids is characterized by a
high pH (>12) for optimum stability of the mud system. The inhibition properties of
such fluids are achieved by the precipitation or gelation of silicates on contact with
divalent ions and lower pH in the formulation, providing an effective water barrier
that prevents hydration and dispersion of the shales.
Amine terminated polyether
An amine terminated polyether shale inhibitor used in water-based drilling fluid
could be synthesized through the method of leaving group [16]. The conditions of an
optimal yield were investigated. Compared to catalytic reductive amination method,
the leaving group method has benefits from its mild reaction condition and simple10 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
synthesis equipment [17,18]. The synthesis process does not require high temperature
and pressure.
It could be shown that the amine terminated polyether has a reasonable molecular
weight, and all the hydroxyl groups of the monomer, PEG-400, were replaced with
ethylenediamine.
The inhibition property of amine terminated polyether, potassium chloride, potas￾sium formate, a methane-siliconic acid, and a polymeric alcohol were comparatively
evaluated through a shale rolling dispersion experiment, linear expansion experiment,
and laser particle size test. The results showed that the amine terminated polyether
has a better shale inhibition property than traditional inhibitors. In addition, the
system has a good engineering application value with excellent rheological property,
low fluid loss, and good shale inhibition property, which guarantee wellbore stability
in shale gas drilling [16].
The inhibition property of poly(ethyleneimine) in a drilling fluid was studied [19].
The inhibition property was evaluated by a linear swell test and roll recovery. The
addition of poly(ethyleneimine) 70000 resulted in the lowest swelling height com￾pared with the other inhibitors. Poly(ethyleneimine) is particularly environmentally
friendly.
The negative charge in the surface of montmorillonite was neutralized by the
positive charge of poly(ethyleneimine). Poly(ethyleneimine) was adsorbed in the
surface of montmorillonite and intercalated into the interlayer of montmorillonite,
which reduced the hydration repulsion of the diffuse electric double layer and
inhibited the hydration of clay. Hydrogen bonding between the amino groups in
poly(ethyleneimine) and the hydroxyl groups on the surface of montmorillonite can
occur in the process [19].
The coordination of the electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding presented
water molecules from the interlayer space of montmorillonite, which resulted
from the adsorption and intercalation of poly(ethyleneimine) in the surface and
the interlayer space of montmorillonite. There was an amount of nitrogen in the
backbone and side of poly(ethyleneimine), leading to more positive ions than a
chitosan quaternary ammonium salt. The more positive ion resulted in the stronger
force between the inhibitor and the clay due to the protonation of nitrogen in water.
The molecular weight of poly(ethyleneimine) had a significant influence on the
inhibition property. A larger molecular weight of poly(ethyleneimine) demonstrated
a better inhibition property except for poly(ethyleneimine) 1800. This indicates that
the molecular weight of poly(ethyleneimine) was not the sole factor to control the
inhibition property. In addition, the larger molecular weight of poly(ethyleneimine)
led to worse water-solubility [19].
The inhibition property of poly(ethyleneimine) in a montmorillonite solution was
studied [20]. The inhibition property was evaluated by a linear swelling test and
rolling recovery test.
In comparison to other inhibitors, the addition of poly(ethyleneimine) resulted
in the lowest swelling height in the drilling fluid [20]. In a rolling recovery rate
study, the addition of poly(ethyleneimine) resulted in the highest recovery rate after1.2 Mud compositions 11
being rolled at 120 ◦C. More importantly, poly(ethyleneimine) was found to be an
environmentally friendly inhibitor.
It could be shown that the negative charge in the surface of montmorillonite
was neutralized by the positive charge in the amino group of poly(ethyleneimine).
Poly(ethyleneimine) was adsorbed in the surface and intercalated into the interlayer
of montmorillonite, which reduced the hydration repulsion of diffuse electric double
layer and prevented the invasion of water. Hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl
in the surface of clay and amino groups in the backbone and side chain of
poly(ethyleneimine) can be formed in the process [20].
The adsorption and intercalation of poly(ethyleneimine) in the surface and
interlayer of montmorillonite were the major factors preventing water molecules
from invading into the gallery of clay. There was a quantity of positive ions in solution
because of the protonation of nitrogen in water. More positive ions resulted in a
stronger force between inhibitor and clay [20].
Acrylic resin/nano-SiO2 composite
The synthesis of a nanoscale acrylic resin/nano-SiO2 composite with a core-shell
structure for water-based drilling fluid has been described [21]. This compound can
enhance the plugging efficiency of shale pores, reduce fluid invasion, and improve
wellbore stability in the shale gas drilling process. The core-shell structure of the
nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Thermo￾gravimetry indicated thermal resistance of the nanocomposite up to 250 ◦C.
The improved plugging property of the nanocomposite might be due to the good
adhesion of the deformable shell parts with the shale matrix and the support provided
by rigid core parts. The plugging ability was evaluated by pressure transmission tests
and N2 adsorption tests.
The results of these studies demonstrated that a water-based drilling fluid contain￾ing the nanocomposite can substantially enhance the plugging efficiency and reduce
fluid invasion. The characterization of the filter cakes revealed that nanocomposite
improved the quality of the filter cakes, which results in a considerable improvement
in the filtration properties [21].
1.2.2 LAPONITE: SHALE INHIBITOR
A nanoscale laponite as a shale inhibitor was used to stabilize wellbores [22].
Laponite is a synthetic clay which swells to produce a clear, colorless, thixotropic
gel when dispersed in water. The inhibition property of laponite suspensions was
evaluated by an immersion experiment, linear swelling measurement, and a shale
recovery test.
In addition, the shale inhibition mechanism was studied by using a capillary
suction time measurement method, a thixotropy study, plugging performance evalua￾tion, and related theoretical analysis [22]. The evaluation of the experimental results
showed that laponite had a better inhibition property than the widely used inhibitors
of potassium chloride and poly(ester amine).12 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
The mechanism study revealed that integration of several factors strengthened the
inhibition property of the laponite suspensions. Laponite nanoparticles could plug
interlayer spaces of clays by electrostatic interaction to reduce water invasion; the
“house of cards” structure of laponite suspensions enables large capillary suction
time values and low free water contents. The excellent thixotropy of a laponite
nanofluid could allow a nanofilm to form in order to reduce water invasion into
the formation. The nanoscale laponite particles could substantially reduce the shale
permeability and form less porous surfaces.
Furthermore, laponite could considerably decrease the filtrate volume of the
drilling fluid, while potassium chloride and poly(ester amine) had negative influences
on the properties of the drilling fluid. This approach might provide an avenue to
inhibit shale hydration [22].
Bituminous coal
Shale is a fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock composed of mud that is a mix of
flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments (silt-sized particles) of other minerals,
especially quartz and calcite [23]. A major way to stabilize shale is to prevent or
reduce the interaction of the water in the drilling fluid with the shale. Much of the
fluid interaction is time-dependent—that is, the longer the shale is exposed to the
drilling fluid, the more likely problems are to develop. Limiting shale exposure to
water can be key to preventing a wellbore failure.
A successful mechanism for limiting the exposure of shale to water is to use
oil-based or synthetic drilling fluids containing organic low-polar fluids. Oil-based
drilling fluids are generally water-in-oil emulsions with the water phase containing
a salt such as calcium chloride. In drilling water-wet shales, capillary forces of oil￾based muds prevent fluid invasion. In addition, the salt concentration in the water
phase can be matched to the shale water activity to reduce or eliminate osmotic
effects. The drilling fluid density can be adjusted to reduce differential pressures.
Ionic substitution is prevented by the presence of the oil surrounding the water
droplets of the emulsion. However, oil-based drilling fluids are expensive and may
have environmental impacts and disposal problems that limit their use in some cases.
In water-based drilling fluids, the water comes in direct contact with the shale.
A variety of mechanisms have been attempted in order to limit the water interaction
with the clays. Potassium chloride is frequently used as a component. When used in
moderate concentrations, the ionic substitution of K+ for Na+ in the clays can help to
strengthen the clays and delay the hydration. The presence of KCl, sodium chloride
(NaCl), or some other salt will also lower the water activity of the fluid, reducing the
osmotic tendency of water to migrate into the shales.
Similarly, organic cationic amine compounds have been developed, which dis￾place the existing cations in the clay structure and exclude water molecules.
An additive for a drilling fluid has been developed that can be used both as a
sealing agent to reduce seepage loss and as a shale stabilizing agent in subterranean
wellbores [23].
The additive is composed of ground bituminous coal having a selected particle
size distribution. The bituminous coal is between 60% and 80% of the additive by1.2 Mud compositions 13
weight. Ground flaxmeal is solvent extracted in order to remove oil from the flaxmeal.
The solvent-extracted ground flaxmeal in the additive is between 20% and 40% of
the additive by weight [23].
1.2.3 WATER-BASED MUDS
These muds have water as the continuous phase. Water may contain several dis￾solved substances. These include alkalies, salts and surfactants, organic polymers in
colloidal state, droplets of emulsified oil, and various insoluble substances, such as
barite, clay, and cuttings in suspension.
The mud composition selected for use often depends on the dissolved substances
in the most economically available make-up water or on the soluble or dispersive
materials in the formations to be drilled. Several mud types or systems are recognized
and described in the literature such as:
• spud muds,
• dispersed/deflocculated muds,
• lime muds,
• gypsum muds,
• salt water muds,
• nondispersed polymer muds,
• inhibitive potassium muds,
• cationic muds, and
• mixed metal hydroxide muds.
Despite their environmental acceptance, conventional WBMs exhibit major
deficiencies relative to OBMs/pseudo oil-based drilling muds (POBMs) with regard
to their relatively poor shale inhibition, lubricity, and thermal stability characteristics.
To overcome those deficiencies, specific additives may, however, be added into the
WBM compositions to deliver properties close to OBMs/POBMs, performance while
minimizing the environmental impact.
Consequently, to meet the new environmental regulations while extending the
technical performance of water-based drilling fluids, a new generation of water-based
fluids, also called inhibitive drilling fluids was developed to compete against OBMs.
Also, to minimize the formation damage, new types of nondamaging drilling fluids,
called drill-in fluid, have been developed to drill the pay-zone formations.
Components for WBMs are shown in Table 1.4. Various methods for the
modification of lignosulfonates have been described, for example, by condensation
with formaldehyde [30] or modification with iron salts [31]. It has been found
that chromium-modified lignosulfonates, as well as mixed metal lignosulfonates of
chromium and iron, are highly effective as dispersants and therefore are useful in
controlling the viscosity of drilling fluids and in reducing the yield point and gel
strength of the drilling fluids. Because chromium is potentially toxic, its release into
the natural environment and the thereof is continuously being reviewed by various
government agencies around the world.14 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

Therefore, less toxic substitutes are desirable. Less toxic lignosulfonates are
prepared by combining tin or cerium sulfate and an aqueous solution of calcium
lignosulfonate, thereby producing a solution of tin or cerium sulfonate and a calcium
sulfate precipitate [32].
Compositions with improved thermal stability
To avoid the problems associated with viscosity reduction in polymer-based aqueous
fluids, formates, such as potassium formate and sodium formate are commonly added
to the fluids to enhance their thermal stability. However, this technology of using the
formates is very expensive. The thermal stability of polymer-based aqueous fluids
can be improved without the need of using formates [33].
The stability of a wellbore treatment fluid may be maintained at temperatures up
to 135-160 ◦C. Various poly(saccharide)s may be included in the fluid. The apparent
viscosities of drilling fluids containing xanthan gum and poly(acrylamide) (PAM)
before and after rolling at 120 ◦C are shown in Table 1.5.1.2 Mud compositions 15
Laponite
To overcome the problem of polymer degradation in water-based drilling fluids under
high temperatures, the influence of laponite nanoparticles on the thermal stability of
drilling fluids was examined [34]. Laponite is also addressed as lithium magnesium
sodium silicate.
First, a terpolymer was synthesized through the radical polymerization of acry￾lamide, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, and diallyldimethylammonium
chloride monomers [34].
Using this terpolymer, water-based drilling fluids containing laponite nanopar￾ticles were formulated. The disk-shaped laponite nanoparticles could be effectively
dispersed in a terpolymer solution and establish strong interactions with the terpoly￾mer. These interactions included [34]:
1. electrostatic attractions between negatively charged laponite surfaces and
quaternary ammonium cationic groups of the terpolymer;
2. electrostatic attractions between positively charged laponite edges and
negatively charged sulfate groups of the terpolymer; and
3. possible hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups of laponite and amide
groups of the terpolymer.
In a drilling fluid system, the earlier interactions also exist between bentonite and
the terpolymer. However, the interactions between the terpolymer and laponite might
be much stronger due to the larger specific area of the laponite nanoparticles.
The presence of laponite nanoparticles significantly improved the onset de￾composition temperature and viscosities of the terpolymer at high temperatures,
as shown with thermogravimetric analysis and high-temperature, high-pressure
rheology studies [34].
The drilling fluids containing laponite had a substantially higher viscosity than
that without laponite; this was ascribed to strong interactions between laponite and
functional groups of the terpolymer [34].
Shale encapsulator
A shale encapsulator is added to a WBM in order to reduce the swelling of the
subterranean formation in the presence of water. A shale encapsulator should be at
least partially soluble in the aqueous continuous phase in order to be effective.
A conventional encapsulator is a quaternary PAM, which is preferably a quat￾ernized poly(vinyl alcohol). Suitable examples of anions that are useful include
halogen, sulfate, nitrate, formate, etc. [35].
By varying the molecular weight and the degree of amination, a wide variety of
products can be tailored. It is possible to create shale encapsulators for the use in
low salinity, including fresh water [35]. The repeating units of quaternized etherified
poly(vinyl alcohol) and quaternized PAM are shown in Figure 1.1.
Membrane formation
In order to increase the wellbore stability, it is possible to provide formulations for
water-based drilling fluids, which can form a semi-permeable osmotic membrane16 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

over a specific shale formation [36]. This membrane allows a comparatively free
movement of water through the shale, but it significantly restricts the movement of
ions across the membrane and thus into the shale.
The method of membrane formation involves the application of two reactants to
form in situ a relatively insoluble Schiff base, which deposits at the shale as a polymer
film. This Schiff base coats the clay surfaces to build a polymer membrane.
The first reactant is a soluble monomer, oligomer, or polymer with ketone
or aldehyde or aldol functionalities or precursors to those. Examples are carbon
hydrates, such as dextrin, linear of branched starch. The second reactant is a primary
amine. These compounds are reacting by a condensation reaction to form an insoluble
crosslinked polymerized product. The formation of a Schiff base is shown in
Figure 1.2.
Figure 1.2 illustrates the reaction of a dextrine with a diamine, but other primary
amines and poly(amine)s will of course react in the same way. Long chain amines,
diamines, or poly(amine)s with a relatively low amine ratio may require supplemental
pH adjustment using materials such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,
sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, or calcium hydroxide [36]. The Schiff base
formed in this way must be essentially insoluble in the carrier brine in order to deposit
a sealing membrane on the shale during drilling of a well.
By carefully selecting the primary polymer and the crosslinking amine, the
relative concentrations of these components, together with the adjustment of pH,
crosslinking and polymerization and precipitation of components occurs which
effectively forms an osmotically effective membrane on or within the face of the
exposed rock.
The polymerization and precipitation of the osmotic membrane on the face of the
exposed rock significantly retards water or ions from moving into or out of the rock
formation, typically shale or clay. The ability to form an osmotic barrier results in an
increased stability in the clays or minerals, which combine to make the rock through
which the borehole is being drilled [36].
Inhibitive water-based drilling fluid
A carboxymethyl-graft-polyacrylamide copolymer was synthesized by free radical
polymerization [37]. This graft copolymer was used as a drilling fluid additive. Its1.2 Mud compositions 17

effect on the Indian reactive shale sample was analyzed. The presence of various
clay minerals was also recorded.
The investigations revealed that the synthesized graft copolymer had a significant
effect on the rheological and filtration properties of the inhibitive drilling fluid system
and had a high shale recovery performance. Therefore, an inhibitive drilling fluid
system using synthesized graft copolymer may be used for the drilling of water￾sensitive shale formations [37].
Inhibitory effect methane hydrate dissociation
Hydrate dissociation poses a significant problem during drilling operations in
hydrate-bearing sediments [38]. Here, the drilling fluid is in direct contact with
hydrates, and understanding its inhibitory effect on hydrate dissociation is important
for stabilizing hydrates during drilling operations.
An apparatus was designed for investigating the hydrate dissociation in drilling
fluids, and the effects of thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone),
and soybean lecithin on the hydrate dissociation were studied [38]. The inhibitory
effect of a water-based drilling fluid in the presence of the potential hydrate
dissociation inhibitors was also studied.18 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
An unexpected inhibitory effect occurred with ethylene glycol at concentrations
below 10%, resulting from a range of factors, including the dissociation driving force,
and mass and heat transfers in the ethylene glycol solution. Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
and lecithin reduced the hydrate dissociation rate and increased the time required
for complete dissociation of hydrates. These can, therefore, be used in water-based
drilling fluids to inhibit hydrate dissociation.
A combination of 0.1% poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and 0.5% lecithin was selected
as an optimal hydrate dissociation inhibitor, considering its inhibitory effect and
compatibility with the drilling fluid. Using ethylene glycol at a concentration below
10% as a thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor instead of NaCl can also help inhibit
hydrate dissociation [38].
Nanoparticles
Water-based drilling fluids are used to carry out efficient and smooth drilling
operations of oil and gas wells [39]. Bentonite is a basic constituent of water￾based drilling fluids. It has excellent swelling properties, the ability to form a gel
structure, and acts as a viscosifier to tailor the rheological properties of drilling
fluids. Deep well drilling with bentonite drilling fluids at high-temperature and high￾pressure conditions will severely affect the performance of drilling fluid in terms
of degradation and flocculation due to thermal-induced swelling of bentonite. High
salts contamination during the drilling process reduces the hydration and dispersion
of bentonite and results in flocculation.
Attempts were made to improve the performance of a bentonite drilling fluid
using novel water-soluble polymers and nanoparticles. Nanoparticles significantly
improved the filtration properties by reducing the fluid loss into formations and by
making a thin filter cake for smooth drilling operations. Novel water-soluble poly￾mers such as acrylamide/2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid copolymer
and acrylamide/2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid/N-vinylpyrrolidone ter￾polymer were used to improve the rheological properties and the dispersion of
bentonite [39].
The rheological and the filtration properties were evaluated using functionalized
carbon nanotubes and graphitized nanotubes by varying the temperature from 25 to
85 ◦C.
The Herschel-Bulkley model [40] and the Bingham model [41] were used to cal￾culate various parameters, such as plastic viscosity and yield stress. It was observed
that incorporation of 0.25% polymers and 0.25% of nanoparticles improved the filtra￾tion and rheological properties, such as yield stress and steady shear viscosity [39].
Ultralow temperature wells
Drilling fluid with proper rheology, strong shale, and hydrate inhibition performance
is essential for drilling ultralow temperature wells (as low as −5 ◦C) in deepwater
and permafrost [42].1.2 Mud compositions 19
The performance of drilling fluids together with additives for ultralow temper￾ature wells has been evaluated by hydrate inhibition tests, shale inhibition tests,
ultralow temperature rheology, and filtration tests. The formulation for a highly
inhibitive water-based drilling fluid has been developed. The results show that 20%
NaCl can give at least a 16 h safe period for drilling operations at −5 ◦C and 15 MPa.
A polyalcohol can effectively retard pore pressure transmission and filtrate
invasion by sealing the wellbore above the cloud point, while a polyetheramine
can strongly inhibit shale hydration. Therefore, a combination of polyalcohol and
polyetheramine can be used as an excellent shale stabilizer [42].
The drilling fluid can prevent hydrate formation under both stirring and static
conditions. Furthermore, it can inhibit the swelling, dispersion, and collapse of shale
samples, thereby enhancing wellbore stability. It has better rheological properties
than the typical water-based drilling fluids used in onshore and offshore drilling at
−5 to 75 ◦C. In addition, it can maintain a stable rheology after being contaminated
by 10% NaCl, 1% CaCl2, and 5% shale cuttings. The drilling fluid developed here is
therefore expected to perform well in drilling ultralow temperature wells [42].
Wettability alteration
Solid or liquid particles of drilling mud may enter into the pores of rock [43].
Thus a mud loss phenomenon and clay swelling can sometimes lead to severe
productive formation damage and cause wettability alterations of reservoir rock from
hydrophilic to oleophilic. Therefore, an appropriate fluid should be designed that is
compatible with the formation fluids and can reduce reservoir damage and increase
the productivity of wells. The two main mechanisms of surfactants are the reduction
of the surface tension and a wettability alteration of a rock reservoir that are effective
in taking the oil.
The effect of nonionic surfactants poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in the presence of
acrylamide hydrolysis (PHPA) in water-based drilling fluids has been studied [43].
The following steps were performed to prepare a barrel (159 l) of a water-based
glycol drilling fluid:
Preparation 1–1: 100 mg l−1 of calcium was added to 350 ml of water with a pH of 7.
To provide a suitable environment for polymers, the pH was increased to 9 and 0.5 g of
sodium carbonate was added to 350 ml of water. To obtain the stability of shale rocks
as well as the rigidity of cuttings and reduce clay swelling, 26 g of potassium chloride
was added to the water, and then potassium 7% by volume and chloride 35,000 mg l−1
were measured. To dissolve the polymer in the water and reduce the dispersion of clay
saturated by sodium chloride, 80 g of sodium chloride was added to the solution, and then
chloride 175,000 mg l−1 was measured. To lower filtration rates of the fluid leading to
less formation damage and reduce clay swelling using fluid loss control polymer, 10 g
of green starch was added to the solution and value of API filtration 3 ml. To encapsulate
drill cuttings, the stability of the wellbore and to improve the fluid cake for wall formation
in the water-based drilling fluids, 0.4 g of PHPA was added to the solution, value of API20 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
filtration 2 ml. To lubricate the drill pipe and shale inhibitor at high temperatures and
pressures, 28 ml of polyethylene glycol (concentration 1.126 mg l−1, molecular weight
600) was added to the solution value of API filtration 2 ml and value of PEG 7% by
volume.
For the measurement of wettability alterations, measurements of contact angle
as a quantitative method, and measurement of clay swelling, weight difference was
used. Calcium carbonate was used as a representative of the reservoir rock. The
experiment was designed so that the parameters of drilling fluid (fluid loss control,
rheology, chloride, potassium chloride, pH, temperature, and poly[ethylene glycol])
are close to the reservoir. In order to simulate the reservoir conditions after contact
of the calcium carbonate with the drilling fluid, the sample was put in a cylinder
containing drilling fluids, and for more simulation of reservoir conditions, the test
was repeated at 80 ◦C without the presence of surfactants and in the presence of a
surfactant.
The distilled water and the oil in the reservoir were used to obtain the contact
angle. The results obtained revealed that since the reservoir is carbonate and
hydrophilic, drilling fluid (without surfactant) causes the reservoir to go into an
oleophilic state, whereas drilling fluid in the presence of a surfactant causes the
reservoir to go into a hydrophilic state, which will be followed by reducing formation
damage and increasing oil production [43].
1.2.4 OIL-BASED DRILLING MUDS
They have oil as the continuous phase. The oil most often selected is diesel oil,
mineral oil, and low toxicity mineral oil. Because some water will always be present,
the OBM must contain water-emulsifying agents. If water is purposely added (for
economical reasons), the OBM is called an invert emulsion mud. Various thickening
and suspending agents as well as barite are added. The emulsified water may contain
alkalies and salts.
Due to their continuous phase, OBMs are known to provide unequaled perfor￾mance attributes with respect to the rate of penetration, shale inhibition, wellbore
stability, high lubricity, high thermal stability, and high salt tolerance. However,
they are subjected to strict environmental regulation regarding their discharge and
recycling.
OBMs are being replaced now by synthetic muds. Diesel oil is harmful to the
environment, particularly to the marine environment in offshore applications. The
use of palm oil derivatives could be considered as an alternative oil-based fluid that
is harmless to the environment [44]. Hydrated castor oil can be used as a viscosity
promoter instead of organophilic quaternized clays [45].
An OBM can be viscosified with maleated ethylene-propylene elastomers [46].
The elastomers are ethylene-propylene copolymers or ethylene-propylene-diene
terpolymers. The maleated elastomers are far more effective oil mud viscosifiers1.2 Mud compositions 21
than the organophilic clays used. On the other hand, specific organophilic clays can
provide a drilling fluid composition less sensitive to high temperatures [47].
Poly-α-olefins (PAOs) are biodegradable and nontoxic to marine organisms. They
also meet viscosity and pour point specifications for the formulation into OBMs [48].
The hydrogenated dimer of 1-decene [49] can be used instead of conventional organic
fluids, as can n-1-octene [50].
Poly(ether)cyclicpolyols
Poly(ether)cyclicpolyols possess enhanced molecular properties and characteristics
and permit the preparation of enhanced drilling fluids that inhibit the formation of
gas hydrates; prevent shale dispersion; and reduce the swelling of the formation to
enhance wellbore stability, reduce fluid loss, and reduce the filter cake thickness.
Drilling muds incorporating the poly(ether)cyclicpolyols are substitutes for
OBMs in many applications [51–55]. Poly(ether)cyclicpolyols are prepared by
thermally condensing a polyol, for example, glycerol to oligomers and cyclic ethers.
Emulsifier for deep drilling
Two major problems are encountered when using OBMs for drilling very deep wells
[56]. The first is a problem with the stability of the emulsions with temperature. The
emulsifying agents that are stabilizing the emulsions must maintain water droplets in
an emulsion up to temperatures of 200 ◦C.
If the emulsion separates by coalescence of the water droplets, the fluid loses its
rheological properties. The second is an environmental problem. The emulsification
agents must not only be effective, but also as nontoxic as possible.
Fatty acid amides consisting of N-alkylated poly(ether) chains are used as
emulsifiers. For those the term polyalkoxylated superamides has been coined [57].
As a cosurfactant, tall oil fatty acids or their salts can be used.
Biodegradable composition
In compositions of oil-based biodegradable drilling fluids biodegradability can be
imparted. There, the main oil phase component is a mixture of methyl esters from
biodegradable fatty acids. A typical formulation of a biodegradable drilling fluid is
shown in Table 1.6.
The issues of ester-based drilling fluids have been reviewed [59]. Esters with
biodegradability and bioaccumulation attributes are promising alternatives to syn￾thetic base oil in drilling fluids.
The critical parameters for a drilling fluid base are [59]:
1. kinematic viscosity;
2. pour point;
3. flash point;
4. thermal stability;
5. hydrolytic stability; and
6. elastomer compatibility.22 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

Ideally, an ester-based drilling fluid requires a base oil with low viscosity, low
pour, high flash point, high thermal and hydrolytic stability, and compatibility with
existing elastomer. However, in real applications, these requirements may not be the
same as the bottom hole conditions, which are always subjected to a high-pressure
and high-temperature environment.
The performance of an ester-based drilling fluid is currently considered outstand￾ing for normal borehole depth and complexity. Nevertheless, the constraints such as
low temperature at the seabed and high temperature and high pressure at the bottom
hole may be slightly different when dealing with an ester-based drilling fluid.
This is due to the unique molecular structure of ester. Affected parameters include
high kinematic viscosity, hydrolytic degradation, and thermal stability.
Failures in managing these parameters may lead to detrimental impacts on drilling
fluid performance and the stability of the fluids. The application of low viscosity, high
thermal and hydrolytic properties of esters, and combination with unique carbon￾based nanomaterials into formulation might be able to close the gap regarding current
ester-based drilling fluid performances [59].
Rheological properties biodegradable drilling fluid
The rheological properties of a graphene/carbon nanotube-hydrogenated oil￾based biodegradable drilling fluid with different nanoparticle loadings were
investigated [60].
All the basic materials used here, that is, hydrogenated oil-based drilling fluid,
graphene nanosheet, and carbon nanotube powders, are commercially available from
Platinum Green Chemicals Sdn. Bhd., Malaysia. A hydrogenated oil is made from a
mixture of a straight chain paraffin and a branched paraffin with a carbon chain length
from C15 to C15. A two-step dispersion method was used to disperse the nanoparticles1.2 Mud compositions 23
physically into the hydrogenated oil-based drilling fluids via hydrodynamic and
acoustic cavitation combination [60]. Before each hydrodynamic and acoustic
cavitation dispersion at all concentrations, the nanoparticles were prehomogenized
via a high-speed shearing at 800 rpm constantly for 15 min.
The viscosity and the shear stresses of two different nanofluids were assessed.
Both nanofluids were subjected to a shear rate ranging from 0 to 140 s−1 to compare
the rheological behaviors. The viscosity of both samples reduces to the viscosity
value of the base fluids at a higher shear rate with carbon nanotube-hydrogenated
oil, yielding a higher viscosity compared to graphene-hydrogenated oil for all
the nanoparticle loadings at lower shear rate. Shear stress analysis also showed
similar results with carbon nanotube-based samples. Both samples show a Newtonian
behavior that is similar to the base fluid even at higher particle loadings [60].
It could therefore be shown that addition of low nanomaterials for the enhance￾ment of drilling fluids can improve the fluid’s thermophysical properties without
compromising the quality of drilling fluids in terms of, for example, viscosity and
shear stress properties [60].
Low toxicity and high biodegradability drilling fluid composition
Oil-based drilling fluids, for example, kerosene, diesel fuel, paraffins, and/or olefins,
have been the primary means of providing lubricity to a drill during the hydrocarbon
exploration process [61]. A major downside in the use of such materials has been in
offshore drilling and in lake systems, mainly due to their pollutant characteristics,
which can cause serious environmental problems and eventually lead to complex
logistical operations. These oil-based fluids cannot be disposed of at sea or in
water, lake, and/or underground aquifer systems due to environmental and pollution
concerns and their adverse effects on aquatic life. In these cases, oil-based fluids
containing naphthas or paraffins need to be transported ashore for some suitable type
of disposal or recovery.
Drilling fluids commonly used in the form of so-called inverted emulsions
correspond to three-phase systems, referred to as: oil, water, and particulate additives,
which include emulsifiers or emulsifying systems, viscosifying agents, additives to
prevent the loss of filler, alkaline reserves, and rheological modifiers, which together
comprise a formulation which can be tailored to performance needs [61].
A composition drilling fluid with low toxicity and high biodegradability has been
presented [61].
This is an inverted emulsion containing an aqueous phase and an oil phase,
wherein the oil phase is formed by mixing at least two diesters in a ratio of 1:9
to 3:7. The mixture of at least two diesters may be used in a proportion of 1-100% by
weight, of the oil phase, preferably 30-50% by weight of this phase.
A composition using bis-(2-ethylhexanoate) ethylene glycol, and bis-(2-
ethylhexanyl)succinate as C18 and C20 diesters is given in Table 1.7. The diesters are
shown in Figure 1.3.24 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

Solid free-flowing additive compositions
Solid free-flowing powdered drilling fluid additive compositions have been de￾scribed. These materials have desirable emulsifying, wetting, and other performance
characteristics. The method of preparation and their use in oil-based drilling fluid
compositions were described.
The method of preparing a solid invert emulsion drilling fluid additive consists of
the following [62]:1.2 Mud compositions 25
Preparation 1–2: Heating the liquid drilling fluid additive to a temperature of about 70-
150 ◦C, contacting said heated liquid drilling fluid additive with an inert filler to form
a mixture wherein said inert filler is selected from the group consisting of precipitated
silica of particle size of 100-130 μm, diatomaceous earth of particle size of 100-130 μm,
expanded perlite of particle size 10-5000 μm, and combinations thereof. The final step
consists of blending and cooling the mixture, and pulverizing the mixture to form a free￾flowing powdered solid invert emulsion drilling fluid additive.
The weight percentage of the liquid drilling fluid additive present in the mixture
has a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 70%. The weight percentage of the inert
filler has a minimum of 30% and a maximum of 50% [62].
Several examples for the preparation of a powdered fluid loss additive have been
presented in detail [62].
Electric conductive nonaqueous mud
A wellbore fluid has been developed that has a nonaqueous continuous liquid phase
that exhibits an electrical conductivity increased by a factor of 104 to 107 compared
with conventional invert emulsion; 0.2-10% by volume of carbon black particles and
emulsifying surfactants are used as additives. Information from electrical logging
tools, including measurements while drilling can be obtained [63].
Water removal
Water can be removed from OBMs by the action of magnesium sulfate [64].
Nanoemulsion for removal
An oil-in-water nanoemulsion for the effective removal of an oil-based drilling fluid
has been developed using the phase-inversion concentration method. The influences
of four factors on the droplet size and removal efficiency were tested, including
the [65]:
1. mass ratio of mixed surfactants;
2. surfactant/oil ratio;
3. mass concentration of cosurfactant; and
4. salinity of the saline solution.
Considering the application environment of displacement spacers, the long-term
stability and temperature resistance were investigated. The results showed that the
mass ratio of mixed surfactants and the surfactant/oil ratio had an obvious influence
on the removal efficiency and the droplet size of nanoemulsions [65].
Because of the synergy effect of the surfactants, the nanoemulsion possesses
a remarkable storage stability and temperature resistance. Moreover, the removal
mechanisms of the nanoemulsion were analyzed by the dynamic interfacial tension,
dynamic wetting angle measurement, and solubilization tests. The results indicated
that the nanoemulsion could spread rapidly and thoroughly on the oil-wetting26 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
surfaces, and the nanoemulsion can contain more oil while the system is still stable,
which is beneficial for the removal of an oil-based drilling fluid [65].
1.2.5 SYNTHETIC MUDS
Synthetic muds are expensive. Two factors influence the direct cost: the costs per
barrel and mud losses. Synthetic muds are the technical equivalent of OBMs when
drilling intermediate hole sections. They are technically superior to all water-based
systems when drilling reactive shales in directional wells. However, with efficient
solids-control equipment, optimized drilling, and good housekeeping practices, the
cost of the synthetic mud can be brought to a level comparable with OBM [66].
POBMs or synthetic OBMs are made on the same principle as OBMs. They
have been developed to maintain the performance characteristics of OBMs while
reducing their environmental impact. The objective behind the design of these drilling
fluids is to exchange the diesel oil or mineral oil base with an organic fluid which
exhibits a lower environmental impact. The organic fluids used are esters, polyolefins,
acetal, ether, and linear alkyl benzenes. As with OBMs, POBMs may contain various
ingredients, such as thickening and suspending agents, emulsifying agents as well as
weighting agents.
POBMs were developed to technically maintain the performance characteristics
of OBMs while reducing their environmental impact. They are, however, not as stable
as OBMs depending upon the continuous phase. From environmental perspective, the
current legislation is becoming as strict for POBMs as for OBMs. The mud selection
process is based on the mud’s technical performance, environmental impact, and
financial impact.
Skeletally isomerized linear olefins exhibited a better high-temperature stability
in comparison with a drilling fluid prepared from a conventional PAO. The fluid loss
properties are good, even in the absence of a fluid loss additive [67–70]. Although
normal α-olefins are not generally useful in synthetic hydrocarbon-based drilling
fluids, mixtures of mostly linear olefins are minimally toxic and highly effective as
the continuous phase of drilling fluids [68,71].
Acetals as mineral oil substitutes exhibit good biodegradability and are less toxic
than mineral oils [72,73]. Acrylic acid (AA) salts are formed by the neutralization
reaction of AA in aqueous solution [74].
Alginates are hydrocolloids, which are extracted from brown marine microalgae.
Water-soluble alginates are prepared as highly concentrated, pumpable suspensions
in mixtures of propylene glycol and water by using hydroxypropylated guar gum
in combination with carboxymethylated cellulose, which is used as a suspending
agent [75].
1.2.6 INVERTED EMULSION DRILLING MUDS
Inverted emulsion muds are used in 10-20% of all drilling jobs. Historically, first
crude oils, then diesel oils and mineral oils, have been used in formulating invert1.2 Mud compositions 27
drilling fluids. Considerable environmentally damaging effects may occur when the
mud gets into the sea. Drilling sludge and the heavy mud sink to the seabed and partly
flow with the tides and sea currents to the coasts. All of these hydrocarbons contain
no oxygen and are not readily degraded [76].
Because of problems of toxicity and persistence, which are associated with these
oils, in particular for offshore use, alternative drilling oils have been developed.
Examples of such oils are fatty acid esters and branched chain synthetic hydrocarbons
such as PAOs. Fatty acid ester-based oils have excellent environmental properties, but
drilling fluids made with these esters tend to have lower densities and are prone to
hydrolytic instability.
PAO-based drilling fluids can be formulated to high densities and have good
hydrolytic stability and low toxicity. They are, however, somewhat less biodegradable
than esters. Further, they are expensive. The fully weighted, high-density fluids tend
to be overly viscous [50].
Esters
Esters of C6 to C11 monocarboxylic acids [77–81], acid-methyl esters [82], and
polycarboxylic acid esters [83], as well as oleophilic monomeric and oligomeric
diesters [84], have been proposed as basic materials for inverted emulsion muds.
Natural oils are triglyceride ester oils [85] and are similar to synthetic esters. Diesters
also have been proposed [84,86–89].
Acetals
Acetals and oleophilic alcohols or oleophilic esters are suitable for the preparation
of inverted emulsion drilling muds and emulsion drilling muds. They may replace
the base oils, diesel oil, purified diesel oil, white oil, olefins, and alkyl benzenes [76,
90]. Examples are isobutyraldehyde, di-2-ethylhexyl acetal, dihexyl formal. Also
mixtures with coconut alcohol, soya oil, and α-methyldecanol are suitable. Some
aldehydes are shown in Figure 1.4.

Inverted emulsion muds are more advantageous in stable, water sensitive for￾mations and in inclined boreholes. They are stable up to very high temperatures and
provide excellent corrosion protection. Disadvantages are the higher price, the greater
risk if gas reservoirs are bored through, the more difficult handling for the team at
the tower, and greater environmental problems.
The high setting point of linear alcohols and the poor biologic degradability of
branched alcohols limit their use as an environment-friendly mineral oil substitute.
Higher alcohols, which are still just somewhat water-soluble, are eliminated for use
in offshore muds because of their high toxicity to fish. Esters and acetals can be
degraded anaerobically on the seabed.
This possibility minimizes the environmentally damaging effect on the seabed.
When such products are used, rapid recovery of the ecology of the seabed takes
place after the end of drilling. Acetals, which have a relatively low viscosity and
in particular a relatively low setting point, can be prepared by combining various
aldehydes and alcohols [76,91].
Antisettling properties
Ethylene-AA copolymer neutralized with amines such as triethanolamine or N￾methyl diethanolamine enhances anti-settling properties [92,93].
Glycosides
The advantage of using glycosides in the internal phase is that much of the concern
for the ionic character of the internal phase is no longer required. If water is limited
in the system, the hydration of the shales is greatly reduced.
The reduced water activity of the internal phase of the mud and the improved
efficiency of the shale is an osmotic barrier if the glycoside interacts directly with
the shale. This helps to lower the water content of the shale, thus increasing rock
strength, lowering effective mean stress, and stabilizing the wellbore [94].
Methyl glucosides also could find applications in water-based drilling fluids and
have the potential to replace OBMs [95]. The use of such a drilling fluid could
reduce the disposal of oil-contaminated drilling cuttings, minimize health and safety
concerns, and minimize environmental effects.
Biodiesel-based fluids
Biodiesel is composed of monoalkyl esters of fatty acids derived from natural and
renewable sources, such as animal fats and vegetable oils. It was considered as a
promising alternative to conventional petrodiesel (ASTM D6751-20) [96]. Biodiesel
has the potential to serve as a base fluid for drilling fluids, since it possesses all the
advantages of conventional esters.
In addition, biodiesel has the potential to serve as the external phase of drilling
fluid due to its abundant sources, great safety, low toxicity, and excellent biodegrad￾ability [97].1.2 Mud compositions 29
There are some investigations on designing of biodiesel-based drilling fluids, but
most of them are about water-free systems instead of emulsion systems, which are
the most commonly used.
A biodiesel-based invert emulsion drilling fluid was prepared. The preparation
process of biodiesel is based on the transesterification reaction using waste cooking
oil as feedstock [98]. The transesterification is done with a monohydric alcohol,
usually methanol, biodiesel, and has many important technical advantages over
petrodiesel, such as inherent lubricity, low toxicity, derivation from a renewable
and domestic feedstock, superior flash point and biodegradability, negligible sulfur
content, and lower exhaust emissions.
Preparation 1–3: The biodiesel-based drilling fluid (BBDF) was prepared according to
the following formulation (O/W = 80/20): Biodiesel (280 ml) + emulsifier 1 (14 g) + 20%
CaCl2 solution (70 ml) + organophilic clay (10.5 g) + lime (1.75 g) + filtration reducer
(14 g) + emulsifier 2 (3.5 g) + barite to the required density.
Similarly, a petrodiesel-based invert emulsion drilling fluid (OBDF, O/W = 80/20)
was prepared for comparison as the following formulation: Petrodiesel (0#, 280 ml) +
emulsifier 3 (10.5 g) + 20% CaCl2 solution (70 ml) + organophilic clay (10.5 g) + lime
(7.0 g) + filtration reducer (14 g) + emulsifier 4 (5.25 g) + barite to required density.
Emulsifier 1 and emulsifier 2 in the BBDF were developed in the laboratory. The other
emulsifiers are commercially available.
The properties this product were evaluated [97]. The results revealed that this
drilling fluid has high electrical stability, acceptable rheological parameters, and a
satisfactory filtration property. After hot-rolling at 120 ◦C for 16 h, these properties
were still able to meet the operational requirements for drilling engineering.
The API filtrate volumes of BBDF and OBDF without hot-rolling and after hot￾rolling (test condition for the fluids without hot-rolling: 20 ◦C, 0.1 MPa, for the fluids
after hot-rolling: 120 ◦C, 3.5 MPa) are summarized in Table 1.8.
The wettabilities of biodiesel and other materials are summarized in Table 1.9.

The biodiesel-based invert emulsion drilling fluid can tolerate 10% seawater, or
15% drilling solid. Due to its excellent lubricity, low toxicity, and high biodegrad￾ability, it is suitable to be used in extended reach drilling, directional drilling, or
horizontal drilling. The biodiesel and the emulsifier in this drilling fluid system are
both produced from waste cooking oil. This may promote the waste recycled and1.2 Mud compositions 31

Miscellaneous
Other base materials proposed are listed in Table 1.10. Quaternary oleophilic esters
of alkylolamines and carboxylic acids improve the wettability of clay [110,111].
Nitrates and nitrites can replace calcium chloride in inverted emulsion drilling
muds [112].
Reversible phase inversion
Invert emulsion fluids have been developed in which the emulsion can be readily
and reversibly converted from a water-in-oil type emulsion to an oil-in-water type
emulsion. The essential ingredient is an amine-based surfactant as additive. The
amine surfactant may be diethoxylated tallow amine, diethoxylated soya amine, or
N-tallow-1,3-diaminopropane [113].
The invert emulsion is admixed with an acid that is functionally able to protonate
the amine surfactant. When sufficient quantities of the acid are utilized, the invert
emulsion is converted so that the oleaginous fluid becomes the discontinuous phase
and the nonoleaginous fluid becomes the continuous phase.
The conversion of the phases is reversible so that upon addition of a base capable
of deprotonating the protonated amine surfactant, a stable invert emulsion in which
the oleaginous liquid becomes the continuous phase and the nonoleaginous fluid
become the discontinuous phase can be formed [113].
In other words, when the drilling fluid is converted into an oil-in-water type
emulsion, solids, now substantially water-wet, may now be separated from the fluid
by gravity or mechanical means for further processing or disposal. The fluid may then32 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
be mixed with a base, the base being functionally able to deprotonate the protonated
amine surfactant.
The base should be in sufficient quantities so as to convert the oil-in-water type
emulsion formed upon the addition of acid, back to a water-in-oil emulsion. The
resulting water-in-oil emulsion may then be used as it is or reformulated into a
drilling fluid suitable for the drilling conditions in another well [113].
1.2.7 DRILLING FLUID SYSTEM FOR COALBED METHANE WELL
Drilling along the coal seam is an effective way to improve gas recovery. Due to
the complex coal body structure and natural fractures, there are many difficulties,
including low abilities of cutting carrying, leakage while crossing the fracture
zone, and reservoir damage. A low-density degradable polymer drilling fluid sys￾tem has been developed to solve these difficulties to enhance coalbed methane
production [114].
The properties of the polymer drilling fluid were evaluated in laboratory studies
using the coal cuttings suspension experiment, borehole stability simulation test,
viscosity attenuation method, laser particle size analysis, polymer removal, and core
permeability recovery method [114]. The results of these experiments indicate that
the developed drilling fluid shows a good rheology and filtration, a high yield point,
and a strong inhibition, thereby meeting the conventional drilling requirements and
carrying coal cuttings effectively.
With bioenzymes, the viscosity of a degradable drilling fluid can be initially
reduced to 16% [114]. The optimum temperature and the pH for the enzyme
activity are obtained, and enzymes with a small weight fraction of 0.01% can
dramatically alter rheological properties of the drilling fluid and thereby the high
biological activity. After degradation, the particle size in drilling fluid decreases
significantly.
During the immersion test, the polymer film on the surface of the lump coal
and thin sections were almost removed by the enzyme solution. The permeability
damage rate of the reservoir may be reduced from 50% to 25% via the functionality
of the enzymes, and it is noticeable that the relationships between effective stress and
gas permeability treated by the drilling fluid and enzyme still obey the exponential
function.
Field applications showed that the drilling fluid has a good compatibility with
conventional plugging materials, which ensures the long horizontal footage of 901 m
with the short construction period. The later decreased viscosity of the drilling fluid
by the enzymes is conducive to reduce the damage to the coal reservoirs [114].
1.2.8 FOAM DRILLING
While drilling low-pressure reservoirs with nonconventional methods, it is common
to use low-density dispersed systems, such as foam, to achieve underbalanced1.2 Mud compositions 33
conditions. To choose an adequate foam formulation, not only the reservoir char￾acteristics but also the foam properties need to be taken into account.
Parameters such as stability of foam and interactions between rock-fluid and
drilling fluid-formation fluid are among the properties to evaluate while designing
the drilling fluid [115].
A foaming composition having a specific pH and containing an ionic surfactant
and a polyampholytic polymer whose charge depends on the pH is circulated in a
well. By varying the pH, it is possible to destabilize the foam in such a way as to
more easily break the foam back at the surface and possibly to recycle the foaming
solution [116].
Aerodynamic foam breaker
In order to enhance the performance of a mechanical foam breaker in foam drilling,
a novel aerodynamic foam breaker with two annular slits was investigated [117].
The computational fluid dynamics code Fluent was employed to analyze the
flow phenomena inside the foam breaker to optimize the distance between the two
annular slits.
The computational fluid dynamics code of ANSYS Fluent [118] was used to
simulate the velocity and pressure distribution inside the foam breaker, and the
optimum distance between the two annular slits was determined based on the
simulation methods.
The fluid density was first used to evaluate the foam breaker performance. A series
of experiments were conducted to test the actual performance of the foam breaker.
The results demonstrated that various factors may affect the efficiency of the foam
breaker, including the foam gas-liquid ratio, basic liquid viscosity, and air supply
method.
A higher gas-liquid ratio of the foam and air supply pressure result in a superior
foam breaker performance. The viscosity of the foam liquid phase exhibits exactly
the opposite behavior, meaning that the foam breaker more effectively destroys foam
from a lower-viscosity liquid [117].
Mechanical foam breaker
Defoaming of foam drilling fluid on the ground is key to its cyclic utilization. A novel
mechanical foam breaker based on self-oscillation to promote the application of foam
drilling technology has been proposed [119].
Simulation results showed that the combined effects of the negative pressure,
collision, extrusion, and shear generated in the cavity cause the foam to fracture.
A prototype was developed, and the effects of the structural parameters, components
of the foam drilling fluid, cuttings, and temperature on the defoaming percentage
were investigated in experiments [119].
The experimental results showed that the diameter of the upper nozzle was the
major structural factor influencing the defoaming. A smaller diameter for the upper
nozzle resulted in a higher defoaming percentage. The defoaming percentage first
increased and then decreased with increases in the lower nozzle diameter, cavity34 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
length, and diameter, which indicated that there is an optimum structure for the foam
breaker.
The cutting concentration and temperature could improve the defoaming percent￾age to some extent, and the salts had a minor influence on the defoaming percentage.
The results verified the feasibility and advantages of using the mechanical foam
breaker and laid a solid theoretical foundation for its application in petroleum and
natural gas drilling [119].
Cuttings transport
Based on the special rheological model of foam fluid, the mathematical models
of cuttings transport for stable foam drilling in vertical/near vertical sections,
the transitional section, and inclined/horizontal sections were established in a
study [120].
The effects of various flow parameters on the cuttings bed thickness in the
annulus were analyzed. The results showed that inclination, annulus velocity, foam
flow rate, and eccentricity are key factors affecting cuttings transport. The thickness
of a cuttings bed gradually decreases with the inclination decrease of the highly
deviated/horizontal sections. When the inclination is reduced to approximately 60◦,
the dynamic and static cuttings bed disappears and is substituted by the glide lamella,
which consists of cuttings grains. Cuttings grains have various forms of movement on
the lower borehole wall. When the inclination is reduced to below 30◦, the cuttings
are brought out of the well by the stable foam if the returning velocity of the annulus
foam is larger than the depositing velocity of the cuttings [120].
The thickness of the cuttings bed gradually decreases with the increase of annulus
velocity. The increased foam quality reduces the concentration of annulus cuttings
when the annulus velocity is constant and when it reaches a stable status earlier
than the foam drilling fluid of lower foam quality. However, the concentration of
the annulus cuttings at the final stage is constant. The thickness of the cuttings bed
increases with increased eccentricity of the drill stem. When the eccentricity is large,
the change of eccentricity has a high effect on the cuttings bed thickness [120].
Soft coal seams
For drilling gas-drainage holes in soft coal seams, it is essential to prevent coal and
gas explosions. After analyzing and summarizing the advantages and disadvantages
of existing spiral drilling and wind-pressure drilling processes, a new technology
of drilling in soft coal seams using a foam drilling fluid has been proposed in a
study [121].
Experiments were conducted to determine the optimal drilling fluid formula
for drilling to depths greater than 200 m. The most effective foam stabilizers were
selected, and correlations of foam half-life and volume with stabilizer concentration
were found. Based on an analysis and comparison of all drilling fluid formulas, the
recommended additives are 5% K12 + 0.6% Sesbania powder + 1.0% Konjac powder1.2 Mud compositions 35
or 5% K12 + 0.8% Sesbania powder + 1.0% HEC. In field tests, five holes deeper
than 200 m could be successfully drilled using this formula [121].
Nanoparticle-stabilized foam
Nanoparticle-stabilized foam has become an important research domain to solve the
foam stability issues under severe conditions because of its unique advantages.
The properties of aqueous foams prepared by alpha olefin sulfonate and clay
particle dispersions were examined using foam stability and rheological behavior
analysis [122]. The alpha olefin sulfonate/clay dispersions have a synergistic effect
on the stability of foam and the foam stability increases with the clay particle con￾centration. Compared with surface charge, the hydrophobicity of particles directly
influences foam stability, and the most hydrophobic clay particles in alpha olefin
sulfonate/clay dispersions of the most stable foams.
With the addition of clay particles, the viscoelasticity moduli of both liquid film
and bulk solution for alpha olefin sulfonate/clay dispersions are enhanced. The film
damping coefficient results reveal that more energy from outside will be effectively
used for alpha olefin sulfonate liquid film after the addition of clay particles.
The clay particles are believed to stabilize foams by increasing extensional vis￾coelasticity modulus of alpha olefin sulfonate/clay dispersions and also by adsorbing
on the bubble surface, thus a three-dimensional network structure is formed between
armored bubbles to slow bubble coalescence and disproportionation [122].
Amphiphilic janus particles
Wax colloidosomes were successfully prepared by the Pickering emulsion method
[123]. After hydrophilic modification with an amino-containing silane agent and
separate hydrophobic modification with several silane coupling agents with different
carbon chain lengths, a series of Janus particles that differed in their hydrophilic
lipophilic balance were fabricated.
The water contact angles of bare SiO2 particles and amino-modified silanes with
different lengths of trimethoxysilanes are shown in Table 1.11.
Table 1.11 Water Contact Angles

NH2−SiO2−8C 78.37
NH2−SiO2−12C 81.78
NH2−SiO2−18C 126.1936 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
The results show that the (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane-SiO2-dodecyltrimetho￾xysilane (NH2−SiO2−12C) Janus particles possess the best foam stability. As a result
of their suitable contact angle of 80◦, high positive ζ -potential, and good surface
activity, these foams display the characteristics of low surface tension, high dilational
elasticity, nonspherical shapes, large sizes, and thick films, which together result in
the extension of the drainage half-life of the foam from 448 to 778 s in comparison
with the foam of pure foaming agent solutions.
Moreover, compared with a foam with no stabilizer or those stabilized by a
soluble foam stabilizer and homogeneous hydrophobic-modified silica particles,
NH2−SiO2−12C-stabilized foam can extend the drainage half-life to 668 s after hot
rolling for 16 h at 280 ◦C and resist a CaCl2 concentration of 0.8%.
Due to their excellent thermal stability and salt tolerance, these Janus particles
are expected to be promising candidates for their use as foam stabilizers in high￾temperature and high-calcium conditions, including drilling, enhanced oil recovery,
waterless fracturing, and especially in geothermal wells [123].
1.2.9 CHEMICALLY ENHANCED DRILLING
Chemically enhanced drilling offers substantial advantages over conventional meth￾ods in carbonate reservoirs. Coiled tubing provides the perfect conduit for chemical
fluids that can accelerate the drilling process and provide stimulation while drilling
[124]. The nature of the chemical fluids is mainly acid that dissolves or disintegrates
the carbonate rock.
Temperature and salinity effects
Coiled tubing applications include drilling operations, hydraulic fracturing, well
completions, removing sand or fill from wellbore, and other applications that involve
pumping fluids at high temperatures and high salinity. Because of curvature effects in
coiled tubing, huge pressure losses occur, limiting the maximum flow rate achieved.
By adding specific chemicals known as friction reducers or drag reducers to the
fluids, these pressure losses can be minimized to a great extent.
Only a few number of studies have been reported that relate to temperature and
salinity effects on drag reduction in fluids flowing through coiled tubing [125].
An experimental study of two commonly used drag reducers (ASP-700 and ASP￾820) flowing through coiled tubing with different salinities and temperatures has been
presented [125]. Both small-scale and large-scale flow loops have been used. The
small-scale flow loop includes a 0.5 in. outside-diameter smooth coiled tubing, while
the large-scale flow loop includes 2 3/8 in. rough coiled tubings. Elevated temperature
tests and salinity tests were conducted using optimum concentrations of drag reducers
in fresh water, 2% KCl, and synthetic seawater.
Correlations were developed that can predict the drag reduction at different
salinities and temperatures. The developed correlations show a reasonable agreement
with the experimental data [125].1.2 Mud compositions 37
1.2.10 SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE DRILLING
The efficiency of drilling operations can be increased using a drilling fluid material
that exists as supercritical fluid or a dense gas at temperature and pressure conditions
occurring in the drill site, such as carbon dioxide.
A supercritical fluid exhibits physical-chemical properties intermediate between
those of liquids and gases. Mass transfer is rapid with supercritical fluids. Their
dynamic viscosities are nearer to those in normal gaseous states.
In the vicinity of the critical point the diffusion coefficient is more than 10 times
that of a liquid. Carbon dioxide can be compressed readily to form a liquid. Under
typical borehole conditions, carbon dioxide is a supercritical fluid.
The viscosity of carbon dioxide at the critical point is only 0.02 c P, increasing
with pressure to about 0.1 c P at 70 MPa (about 10,000 psi). Because the diffusivity
of carbon dioxide is so high, and the rock associated with petroleum-containing
formations is generally porous, the carbon dioxide is quite effective in penetrating
the formation.
This penetration is beneficial. Carbon dioxide is commonly used to stimulate
the production of oil wells, because it tends to dissolve in the oil, reducing the oil
viscosity while providing a pressure gradient that drives the oil from the formation.
Carbon dioxide can be used to reduce mechanical drilling forces, to remove
cuttings, or to jet erode a substrate. Supercritical carbon dioxide is preferably
used with coiled-tube drilling equipment. The very low viscosity of supercritical
carbon dioxide provides efficient cooling of the drill head and efficient cuttings
removal.
Furthermore, the diffusivity of supercritical carbon dioxide within the pores of
petroleum formations is significantly higher than that of water, making jet erosion
using supercritical carbon dioxide much more effective than jet erosion using water.
Supercritical carbon dioxide jets can be used to assist mechanical drilling, for
erosion drilling, or for scale removal. Spent carbon dioxide can be vented to the
atmosphere, collected for reuse, or directed into the formation to aid in the recovery
of petroleum [126].
Glycerin-based drilling fluid
A special drilling fluid was obtained by the substitution of 50% of the water in water￾based drilling fluid by crude glycerine, and matching API properties by regulating
the additives [127].
These new and also conventional drilling fluids were tested in comparative
laboratory studies. Here, the cross-flow mud circulation in the slot with transversal
core were tested. After mud circulation, HCl acid was circulated, and the return
permeability was measured under increasing flow rate of the reversed flow.
A series of six experiments were conducted with Berea sandstone cores to
measure the amount of invading fluid and the formation damage under different￾rate return flows. The glycerine-based and water-based drilling fluids were circulated
across the core face.38 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
After mud circulation, HCl was circulated, and the return permeability was
measured under increasing flow rate of the reversed flow. The glycerin-based mud
exhibited a significantly lower leak-off than the water-based drilling fluid. The
filter-cake stabilization time is lower for the glycerin-based drilling fluid. The
return permeability is higher for the glycerin-based drilling fluid. These properties
constitute the advantages of the glycerine-based drilling fluid over a traditional water￾based mud [127].
Underbalanced drilling operation
Underbalanced drilling is a practice of drilling a well with the wellbore fluid gradient
less than the natural formation gradient [128]. It differs from conventional drilling
in that the bottom holes circulating pressure is lower than the formation pressure,
thereby permitting the well to flow while drilling proceeds.
The underbalanced drilling technology is a valuable method for minimizing
formation invasion-related problems. Because the majority of hydrocarbons today
are found in existing fields with depleting pressures, or in complex and low-quality
reservoirs, the economical use of underbalanced drilling is becoming more and more
popular. This technology can save the industry millions of dollars by increasing the
amount of recoverable oil within a shorter time frame.
Historically, most underbalanced drilling projects were undertaken to eliminate
drilling problems and cost. However, recently, the reduction of formation damage
has become the main focus for underbalanced operations. This has the greatest
potential, indirectly increasing the profit to the operating company. Potential benefits
include increasing the production rate, ultimate recovery, and enabling accelerated
production.
The underbalanced technology, while still on a sharp growth curve, is finally
becoming accepted as a normal method for handling the drilling and completion of
wells. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide in underbalanced drilling operations
has been investigated. The use of carbon dioxide in an underbalanced drilling
operation eliminates some of the operational difficulties that arise with gaseous
drilling fluids, such as generating enough torque to run a downholes motor [128].
The unique properties of carbon dioxide, both inside the drill pipe and in the
annulus, were assessed for optimizing the drilling operation by achieving a low
bottom hole pressure window. Typically carbon dioxide becomes supercritical inside
the drill pipe at this high density. It will generate enough torque to run a downholes
motor. As the fluid exits the drill bit it will vaporize and become a gas, hence
achieving the required low density that may be required for underbalanced drilling.
Both single phase carbon dioxide and a mixture of CO2 and water have been studied
to show the effect of produced water on the corrosion rates [128].
Pressure controlling
The heat transfer along a wellbore was analyzed. Then a closed mathematical model,
which fully couples the hydrostatic pressure, temperature, and physical properties of1.2 Mud compositions 39
CO2 and friction, was established to keep bottom-hole pressure constant during the
drilling process [129].
Based on the pressure profile in the wellbore achieved for a certain surface
back pressure, a pressure controlling method for managed pressure drilling with
supercritical carbon dioxide was presented [129].
The influences of mass flow rate, well depth, and inlet temperature on the annulus
pressure profile and surface back pressure were investigated. The results showed that
the pressure profile is almost in linear correlation with well depth in the annulus,
which provides convenience for well control. The needed back pressure (applied
by surface choke) decreases with increasing mass flow rate and decreasing well
depth. The impact of inlet temperature on the annulus pressure profile, surface
back pressure, and flow friction is negligible. It also shows that the density of CO2
increases significantly and abruptly at a critical pressure. It was suggested that the
storage pressure of CO2 in a surface tank should be larger than the critical pressure
for a certain temperature [129].
Particle settling model
A generalized model has been established to calculate the terminal velocity of
particles, such as cuttings and proppants, during the settling process in supercritical
carbon dioxide drilling and completion [130].
This model has assessed the physical properties of carbon dioxide with tempera￾ture and pressure [130]. It was found that during the settling process, particles firstly
accelerated with the decrease of acceleration in supercritical carbon dioxide, and
ultimately moved with a constant velocity when the forces reached a balance. The
effective gravity and the drag force are two dominant forces of the particles during
the settling process, and the virtual mass force and the Basset force are two orders of
magnitude smaller than that of the former two forces.
Experimentally, the settling process of particles in supercritical carbon dioxide
was described, while terminal velocity tests were conducted to examine the effect
of pressure, temperature, particle size, and particle type on the terminal velocity of
particles in supercritical carbon dioxide [130].
The experimentally measured terminal velocity and the numerically calculated
terminal velocity are in good agreement under the same conditions. The terminal
velocity is basically proportional to temperature, particle diameter, and particle
density, but inversely proportional to the pressure. The error of the settling model is
largest near the critical point. The maximum error is 13.67% and the minimum error
is 2.94% in the comparative data, which verifies the accuracy of the model [130].
Wellbore collapse pressure analysis
Compared with conventional drilling methods, supercritical carbon dioxide used in
drilling and completion has considerable potentials and many advantages. However,
it was found that there are still many basic problems to be solved. Wellbore stability
is one of them [131].40 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
On the basis of the Span Wagner equation [132], combined with the unique
physical properties of supercritical carbon dioxide, parameters such as temperature
and pressure in the wellbore in the course of supercritical carbon dioxide drilling
were calculated. The equation is as follows [133]:
P(δ, τ ) = ρRT(1 + δr
δ) (1.1)
Here, δ is the ratio of density to critical density, τ is the ratio of temperature to
critical temperature, R is the gas constant, and r
δ represents the partial derivatives
of the Helmholtz free energy.
The heat and mass transfer effect between the supercritical carbon dioxide and the
formation has been studied, and the temperature change near the wellbore formation
and stress change near the wellbore were measured. Thus, pore pressure change near
the wellbore has been obtained.
When the depth reaches 1500 m, the downhole temperature will be 12 ◦K lower
than the wellbore temperature, and the pore pressure will increase to 20 MPa as the
supercritical carbon dioxide seeps into the formation. The rules that determine the
change of the mechanical properties when the rocks are soaked in the supercritical
carbon dioxide were obtained in the course of experiments [131].
The compressive strength decreases by 64%, the elastic modulus increases by
153%, and the Poisson ratio decreases by 8%. Based on the above research, the
wellbore collapse pressure model has been established. It is revealed that the wellbore
collapse pressure rises from 9.17 to 16.26 MPa with the increase of time, which is still
lower than the bottom pressure and cannot lead to instability. Meanwhile, the bottom
collapse failure index remains positive and increases gradually with the increase of
time. It means that there is no wellbore enlargement. Therefore, the results have
verified the wellbore stability during the supercritical carbon dioxide drilling process.
This has laid a solid foundation for the future development of supercritical carbon
dioxide drilling [131].
1.3 COMPLETION FLUIDS
1.3.1 CORROSION KINETICS OF CARBON STEELS
A safe completion of high-pressure, high-temperature, ultra-deep oil or gas wells is
often carried out using high-density (2.22 g ml−1, 18.5 ppg) clear brines composed of
ZnBr2 and CaBr2 [134]. The corrosion rate of such brines with carbon steel at temper￾atures of 175-230 ◦C has been reported as relatively small and inconsequential, given
the short residence time of these fluids in the hole during completion and/or workover
operations. Recently, however, significant corrosion damage has been observed on a
carbon steel coiled tubing string during well intervention operations, and on other
incidental downhole high strength carbon steel workover tools.
In order to resolve these apparent discrepancies, a series of corrosion tests were
performed using rotating cylinder probes cut from actual coiled tubing stock. Very1.3 Completion fluids 41
high corrosion rates (up to 100 mm year−1 or 4000 mm year−1) were observed in
the beginning of exposure. Over time, the corrosion rates decreased 20- to 50-fold
depending on the length of observation. This decrease was attributed to the formation
of a surface film consisting of Zn-Fe bromide. While iron ions are quite soluble
in the brine, the Zn-Fe-Br complex on the metal surface was not, and continued
to grow with time. The film had a lacquer-like appearance and appeared to be
continuous [134].
The kinetics were parabolic in nature, revealing the protective nature of the film.
Activation energies for corrosion rates under flowing as well as stagnant conditions
were determined at approximately 8.5 kcal (mol K)−1. This finding suggested a
mixed corrosion rate control by the electrochemical charge transfer and diffusion
through the corrosion product film. Mass transfer into the solution did not seem to
be rate-determining because of observed minor dependence of the corrosion rate on
flow rate (rotational speed) [134].
1.3.2 ELECTROCHEMICAL METHODS OF REMOVING DISSOLVED
OXYGEN
The presence of dissolved oxygen in drilling or completion fluids can increase the
corrosion rate or the deterioration rate of drilling pipes and downhole equipment
having metal surfaces [135]. The rate of corrosion is affected by water and accel￾erated by electrolytes, such as those from salts present in drilling or completion
fluids.
One approach to reduce the corrosion of metals in contact with dissolved oxygen
is to scavenge the dissolved oxygen before it has a chance to oxidize the metal.
Various oxygen scavengers have been developed. However, some of these known
oxygen scavengers can decompose into potentially formation-damaging compounds
when used in high-temperature environments [135].
Other scavengers can be inactivated by heat. Some oxygen scavengers may not be
compatible with the salts, which are often encountered in a downhole environment.
Thus, alternative procedures to remove or reduce dissolved oxygen in drilling and
completion fluids are desired.
A method of removing oxygen dissolved in a drilling or completion fluid
comprises [135]:
1. flowing the drilling or completion fluid through an oxygen removal device
comprising an anode;
2. a cathode comprising metallic nanoparticles loaded on a support;
3. an ion exchange membrane disposed between them;
4. electrically separating the anode and the cathode; and
5. a power source electrically coupled to the anode and the cathode.
For a method of treating a fluid in a subterranean formation, the method consists
of [135]:42 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
• injecting a fluid into a subterranean formation, the fluid containing dissolved
oxygen;
• contacting the fluid with an oxygen removal device, the oxygen removal device
comprising an anode, a cathode comprising metallic nanoparticles loaded on a
support, an ion exchange membrane disposed between, and electrically
separating the anode and the cathode, and a power source electrically coupled to
the anode and the cathode; and
• reducing the amount of the dissolved oxygen in the fluid [135].
1.3.3 POTASSIUM-BASED PHOSPHATE BRINES
Many oil and gas resources in deep-sea environments worldwide are often lo￾cated in high-temperature/high-pressure and low-permeability reservoirs [136]. The
reservoir-pressure coefficient usually exceeds 1.6, with a formation temperature
greater than 180 ◦C. Challenges exist for well drilling and completion in these high￾temperature/high-pressure reservoirs. A solid-free well-completion fluid with safety
density greater than 1.8 g cm−3 and excellent thermal endurance is strongly needed.
Because of high cost and/or corrosion and toxicity problems, the application of
available solid-free well-completion fluids, such as cesium formate brines, bromine
brines, and zinc brines, is limited in some cases.
Potassium-based phosphate well-completion fluids have been developed. The
results of this study showed that the fluid can reach the maximum density of
1.815 g cm−3 at room temperature, which indicates a breakthrough on the density
limit of normal potassium-based phosphate brine. The corrosion rate of N80 steel
after interaction with the target phosphate brine at a high temperature of 180 ◦C
is approximately 0.1853 mm a−1 (mm per year), and the regained-permeability
recovery of the treated sand core can reach up to 86.51% [136].
Scanning electron microscope pictures also support the corrosion-evaluation
results. The phosphate brine shows a favorable compatibility with the formation
water. The biological toxicity-determination results revealed that it is only slightly
toxic and is environmentally acceptable. In addition, phosphate brine is highly
effective in inhibiting the performance of clay minerals. The cost of phosphate brine
is approximately 44-66% less than that of conventional cesium formate, bromine
brine, and zinc brine. Therefore, a phosphate brine can serve as an alternative high￾density solid-free well-completion fluid during well drilling and completion in high￾temperature/high-pressure reservoirs [136].
1.3.4 CHANGING WETTABILITY BY SURFACTANT ADDITIVES
Experimental laboratory evidence of enhanced production by spontaneous imbibition
via the addition of surfactants into completion fluids, as well as field observations,
indicate a significant improvement in the estimated ultimate recovery with the use of
surfactants to improve oil recovery from unconventional liquid reservoirs [137].1.3 Completion fluids 43
During a hydraulic fracture treatment, the surfactant molecules interact with the
rock surface, altering its wettability and interfacial tension. The wettability alteration
of the rock surface from oil-wet to water-wet enables the spontaneous imbibition
of water into the matrix, which expels the oil out of the pore space toward the
fractures. Several laboratory and numerical studies have investigated the effective￾ness of surfactant-assisted spontaneous imbibition on various unconventional liquid
reservoirs. However, the understanding of surfactant selection for the optimization of
enhancing recovery in unconventional liquid reservoirs is not well studied.
The capillary pressure is the dominant force for a spontaneous imbibition
process. Contact angle and interfacial tension are essential terms in the Young￾Laplace capillary pressure equation as well as in published scaling analysis of the
spontaneous imbibition process. With the large amount of data released on surfactant￾assisted spontaneous imbibition, it is natural to develop a correlation between the
two properties to the recovery factor. However, no work has been conducted to
investigate the relationship of contact angle and interfacial tension on ultimate
recovery by spontaneous imbibition in unconventional liquid reservoirs. In this
study, a compilation of contact angle, interfacial tension, and spontaneous imbibition
experiments from two of the most prolific shale reservoirs has been presented to give
an insight into the relationship between the three variables [137].
Then, based on the observed trends and correlations, a new scaling model
for surfactant-assisted spontaneous imbibition in unconventional liquid reservoirs
was proposed. The ultimate goal was to develop a surfactant selection method
based on scaling analysis results and laboratory data for optimal performance in
unconventional liquid reservoirs.
A total of 35 independent surfactant-assisted spontaneous imbibition correlated
experiments data were compiled, which includes contact angle, interfacial tension,
recovery factor, porosity, core plug dimensions, and capillary pressure calculated
from the Young-Laplace equation [137].
Experimental procedure on each data point followed the robust data gathering
methodology that was already developed previously. The reliable procedure ensures
the representability of the reservoir condition in the laboratory measurements to
provide an accurate description of the effectivity of different surfactants on a
corresponding oil/water/rock system.
Two systems were analyzed and assembled into three groups: Wolfcamp [138,
139], Eagle Ford A, and Eagle Ford B. An inversely proportional correlation between
contact angle and recovery factor was observed, while on the interfacial tension
and recovery factor analysis, a less apparent correlation was found. Theoretically, a
directly proportional correlation between capillary pressure and recovery factor can
be expected due to spontaneous imbibition that is primarily dominated by capillary
forces, which is consistent with experimental data analysis.
The high dependence of the recovery factor on the contact angle and the less
significant effects from interfacial tension suggested to conclude that a substantial
wettability altering surfactant is highly preferred to enhance the surfactant-assisted
spontaneous imbibition. In addition, based on the observed correlation, a new44 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
dimensionless scaling equation fully accounting for the effect of surfactant addition
was developed to generalize the flow behavior of surfactant-assisted spontaneous
imbibition [137].
1.3.5 ALTERING WETTABILITY IN BAKKEN SHALE BY SURFACTANT
ADDITIVES
The performance of a fracture treatment in Bakken shale reservoirs could be
improved by altering the rock wettability, as measured with contact angle, from oil￾wet to water-wet [140]. The use of chemical additives for altering the wettability also
results in an alteration of the interfacial tension.
The Young-Laplace equation [141] relates the capillary pressure to the interfacial
tension and the contact angle. Thus, it follows that capillarity is significant in
nanopores associated with unconventional liquid reservoirs and complex as the
contact angle and interfacial tension vary simultaneously [140]. These interactive
variables were evaluated to improve the oil recovery by an alteration of capillary
pressure by understanding the wetting state of siliceous and carbonate Bakken cores
with and without chemical additives. It was observed that the wettability can be
altered from the unconventional liquid reservoirs’ natural state of oil-wet to systems
favoring fracturing fluid imbibition.
Surfactants can be added to completion fluids, in proper concentrations, to
alter wettability while hydraulic fracturing the formation [140]. The efficiencies of
anionic, nonionic, and blended surfactants were evaluated and compared. In addition,
the effect of complex nanofluids on the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from Bakken
shale cores was assessed by analyzing the effect of wettability and interfacial tension
alteration and their impact on spontaneous imbibition.
The original wettability of Bakken cores was determined by contact angle mea￾surements. Then, three surfactant types, anionic, nonionic, and nonionic-cationic, and
complex nanofluids are evaluated to gauge their effectiveness in altering wettability.
The results showed that all surfactants and complex nanofluids are able to shift
the core wettability from oil-wet to water-wet. However, the efficacy of chemical
additives strongly depends on the rock lithology, the surfactant, and the complex
nanofluid type [140].
Moreover, to evaluate further wettability alteration, the stability of the surfactant
and complex nanofluids solution films on the shale rock surface was determined
by ζ -potential measurements. Surfactants and complex nanofluids show higher ζ -
potential magnitudes than water without additives, as an indication of better stability
and water-wetness, which agrees with contact angle results.
In addition, the effect of interfacial tension alteration was studied in solutions
with surfactants and complex nanofluids, and Bakken crude oil. A higher reduction
of the interfacial tension can be achieved by anionic surfactants, but all surfactants
and complex nanofluids perform better than water alone. Surfactants and complex
nanofluids potential for improving oil recovery in ultralow permeability Bakken cores
was investigated by spontaneous imbibition experiments using modified Amott cells1.4 Measurement of properties 45
in an environmental chamber. Using computer tomography scan methods, the water
imbibition as penetration magnitude was measured in real time. In addition, the oil
recovery was recorded over time to compare the performance of surfactants, complex
nanofluids, and completion fluid alone [140].
The results suggest that surfactants and complex nanofluids are better on recover￾ing oil from shale core displacing more oil and having higher penetration magnitudes
than water without additives. In addition, oil recovery depends on surfactant and
complex nanofluids type and rock mineral composition. These findings are consistent
with contact angle, zeta potential, and interfacial tension measurements. From the
results obtained, it can be concluded that altering wettability and reducing interfacial
tension when surfactants and complex nanofluid additives are added to completion
fluids can improve oil recovery in Bakken cores [140].
1.4 MEASUREMENT OF PROPERTIES
1.4.1 ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY
During the drilling of a wellbore into a subterranean formation, a drilling fluid
may be continuously circulated from the well surface down to the bottom of the
wellbore being drilled and back to the well surface again [142]. The drilling fluid may
include a mixture of water, oil, and additives (e.g., viscosifiers, weighting materials),
to impart certain desired properties to the drilling fluid to satisfy different drilling
requirements.
The drilling fluid can serve several functions, one of them being to transport
wellbore cuttings up to the surface where they are separated from the drilling fluid.
Another function of the drilling fluid is to provide hydrostatic pressure against the
wall of the drilled wellbore, thereby preventing wellbore collapse and the resulting
influx of gas or liquid from the formations being penetrated. For these and other
reasons, it can be important to know the characteristics and chemical composition of
the drilling fluid during the circulation process.
When using an oil-based drilling fluid, the knowledge of the oil/water ratio in the
drilling fluid allows the drilling operator to determine the fluid rheology, the impact
the drilling fluid may have on the formation, the salinity of the drilling fluid, density,
filtration characteristics or requirements, etc. A drilling fluid that is too viscous may
reduce drilling efficiency. Conversely, a drilling fluid that is not viscous enough may
be lost to the formation.
Drilling fluid compositions may also vary during drilling operations due to the
accumulation of wellbore cuttings. The wellbore cuttings may be low gravity solids
(e.g., solids having a size less than 8-10 μm) and have a lower density than the
weighting materials in the drilling fluid. The low gravity solids can significantly
affect the drilling fluid properties. For example, when the content of the low gravity
solids is too high, the drilling fluid can deteriorate to the point where it becomes
unusable. At such a point, costly treatment may be introduced into the wellbore to46 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
recover the drilling fluid or the whole volume of affected drilling fluid is removed
from the wellbore. Thus, to ensure successful drilling operations without interruption,
it is critical to monitor the drilling fluid properties while it is circulating through the
wellbore [142].
The properties of a drilling fluid can be determined by using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy techniques. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is
a noninvasive technique for measuring properties of a medium as a function of
frequency, also referred to as the excitation frequency. In particular, the method
described here consists of [142]:
1. generating frequency responses of one or more sample fluids having known
fluid properties;
2. selecting an equivalent circuit model for modeling the frequency responses, the
equivalent circuit model including one or more model elements;
3. calculating an equivalent impedance of the equivalent circuit model,
4. generating a correlation between the one or more model elements and the
known fluid properties;
5. measuring an impedance of a drilling fluid;
6. determining at least one property of the drilling fluid based on the correlation
between the one or more model elements and the known fluid properties;
7. calculating values of the one or more model elements that minimize a desired
objective function;
8. generating the correlation using these values;
9. generating two or more correlations between two or more different model
elements and a same known property;
10. determining at least one property of the drilling fluid based on the two or more
correlations and thereby obtaining two values of the property of the drilling
fluid; and
11. combining the two values of the property of the drilling fluid to minimize
uncertainties in determining at least one property of the drilling fluid.
1.4.2 PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION IN A DRILLING FLUID
Conventional processes for determining particle size distribution use laser diffraction
methods to determine the particle size distribution of the sample [143]. Laser
diffraction-based particle size analysis relies on the fact that particles passing through
a laser beam will scatter light at an angle that is directly related to their size.
This method typically assumes that all particles are spherical regardless of actual
shape of the particles. As the particle size decreases, the observed scattering angle
increases logarithmically. The scattering intensity is also dependent on particle size,
diminishing with particle volume. Therefore, large particles scatter light at narrow
angles with high intensity, whereas small particles scatter at wider angles but with
a low intensity. In laser diffraction, particle size distributions are calculated by
comparing the scattering pattern of the sample with an appropriate optical model by1.4 Measurement of properties 47
exploiting the above-described behavior of the particles that pass through the laser
beam. Further, with laser diffraction, normalized values of particle size distribution
are reported. In a normalized system, changes in one area may change the distribution
in other regions completely [143].
Sometimes, the sampling of the fluid in the flow line leads to inaccuracy in
the particle size distribution measurement of materials in the fluid, because the
sample is often diluted in order to use laser diffraction methods to determine particle
size distribution. Dilution of the sample often breaks up conglomerated particles,
thereby altering the sample before particle size distribution measurements are taken.
Therefore, the particle size distribution of the sample may not be an accurate
representation of the particle size distribution of the flow line [143].
A method for measuring the particle size distribution in a fluid has been described
[143]. This method is done by inserting a laser beam instrument directly in the fluid
flow line, wherein the laser beam instrument focuses a laser beam on a window
directly coupled with the fluid flow line. Here, the fluid flow line comprises a fluid
having a plurality of particles of different sizes. The diameter of at least one particle
in the fluid flow line is measured by the reflectance when a particle passes through
the focused laser beam. Also the duration of the reflection of the particle is measured.
So the number of particles in each group of particle sizes can be obtained. Then also
the particle size distribution in the fluid flow line can be determined.
1.4.3 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES
There is usually a complex interplay of the factors involved during drilling fluid
formulation, property determination, its performance in the well, and its relationship
with other wellbore drilling parameters [144]. This occurs because drilling muds
exhibit time-dependent properties. This time dependency is the direct product of
the synergy among the various active additives that make up the mud and the
characteristic of each additive, especially at downhole conditions where the effects
of temperature and pressure are pronounced. These additives are more often than not
diverse in size, chemical activity, density, and surface energy.
Deriving knowledge from the data from these parameters in order to develop a
functional relationship between them is a challenging task that requires advanced
modeling techniques, as well as human intuition and experience. The dependence on
human intuition and on the experiential knowledge of professional mud engineers
lays bare the shortcomings of traditional mud design techniques.
Artificial intelligence techniques have been shown to alleviate this challenge.
Exploiting the abundant literature on the various applications of artificial intelligence
in oil and gas operations, several works that show how and what artificial intelligence
techniques are used in the drilling fluid industry, and what has been achieved due to
their use, have been selected [144].
Current artificial intelligence techniques and their applications in drilling fluid
engineering have been reviewed [144].48 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
An examination of the strengths and deficiencies was carried out using the
following virtues as the basic criteria [144]:
1. robustness against noise;
2. self-organization;
3. generalization ability;
4. data volume requirements; and
5. convergence speed.
The artificial intelligence techniques presented in this review include: artificial
neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic, support vector machines (SVMs), hybrid
intelligent systems (HISs), genetic algorithms (GAs), case-based reasoning (CBR),
and particle swarm algorithms (PSAs).
It was identified that ANN is the most widely applied technique in drilling fluid
engineering, accounting for more than 54% of the papers reviewed. Lost circulation
problems were the most predicted well problems related to drilling fluids, accounting
for more than 17% of the mud problems predicted.
It was also observed that a blend of artificial intelligence techniques performed
better than when each one of the artificial intelligence techniques was used singly.
The ANN technique was found to meet all the listed criteria except for its slow
speed of convergence. However, the ANN technique, GAs, SVMs, and fuzzy logic
were all found to be robust against noise [144].
1.4.4 DENSITY OF A DRILLING FLUID
To prevent drilling fluid losses into formation under high-pressure and high￾temperature conditions in oil/gas wellbores, it is essential to have enough information
about the rheology of the drilling fluid [145].
The lack of a global model to estimate the density of the drilling fluid at the
wellbore conditions has adversely affected the plans of drilling fluid loss control.
Using a special sort of soft computing technique has allowed a new kind of
intelligent model to be developed [146].
This model is based on extended datasets reported in open literatures. It has
clearly become possible to defeat the aforementioned obstacles and elevate the
performance of estimating the drilling fluid density (g cm−3).
In this regard, the least square support vector machine was employed to predict
the rheology of the drilling fluid at wellbore conditions for different types of drilling
fluids including oil-based muds, water-based muds, and gas-aphrons. According
to the average absolute relative deviation, correlation coefficient, and mean square
error, the proposed low parameter model has an acceptable robustness, integrity,
and reliability. Therefore, the proposed artificial intelligence-based method can
be considered as an alternative model to determine the drilling fluid density at
wellbore condition when the essential experimental data are not obtainable or
measurable [145].1.4 Measurement of properties 49
1.4.5 PREDICTION OF DRILLING FLUID DENSITY
A universal model for the prediction of a drilling fluid density at high pressure and
high temperature seems not to be available [147]. This would be valuable for the
performance of drilling fluid loss control.
A rigorous predictive model has been suggested for estimating the drilling fluid
density at wellbore conditions [147].
In this regard, the combination of particle swarm optimization and an ANN
was utilized to propose a high-performance model for predicting the drilling fluid
density [147]. Moreover, two competitive machine learning models including a fuzzy
inference system model and a hybrid of genetic algorithms and the fuzzy inference
system method were employed.
To construct and examine the predictive models, the data samples of the open
literature were used. Based on the statistical criteria, the particle swarm optimization￾artificial neural network (PSO-ANN) model has reasonable performance in compari￾son with other intelligent methods used in this study. Therefore, the PSO-ANN model
can be employed reliably to estimate the drilling fluid density at high-pressure and
high-temperature conditions [147].
The conclusions drawn from this study are as follows [147]:
1. Reasonable agreement between the values of the drilling fluid density estimated
by the PSO-ANN model versus corresponding real drilling fluid density values
observed. However, the correlation between the outputs of the other intelligent
approaches and the experimental drilling fluid density is unacceptable.
2. The evolved PSO-ANN model is applicable for all ranges of drilling fluid such
as oil-based, water-based, synthetic drilling fluid, and colloidal aphron-based
muds.
3. The evolved intelligent PSO-ANN model for monitoring the drilling fluid
density at wellbore conditions is user-friendly, cheap, and fast in terms of
execution. Moreover, it can be coupled with commercial drilling simulators
(i.e., drill office) for drilling planes from oil reservoirs.
1.4.6 REAL-TIME DRILLING FLUID ANALYSIS
The quantitative detection of oil and gas in a drilling fluid while drilling helps to
characterize the reservoir quality and to evaluate reservoir productivity [148]. There
is a significant demand to detect the oil content in drilling fluid in real time at well
sites in the petroleum industry.
A novel instrument for real-time drilling fluid nuclear magnetic-resonance spec￾troscopy (NMR) analysis at well sites has been presented. The new designed
integrated NMR system comprises several subsystems [148]:
1. drilling fluid auto-sampling device;
2. small-sized NMR sensor;
3. spectrometer;50 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
4. main controller; and
5. wireless data communication.
The auto-sampling device takes drilling fluid samples continuously and quantita￾tively from the flow line returning from the well, and removes debris with diameter
greater than 1 mm to reduce interference in the measurement process. The small￾sized NMR sensor is implemented based on Halbach magnets with 20 kg weight and
about 20 MHz operating frequency. The integrated system is capable of performing
remote control and data acquisition in harsh environments. The instrument has been
fully tested at a number of wells, and could successful discover oil-bearing and gas￾bearing formations [148].
1.4.7 SIZE OF WATER-IN-OIL EMULSION DROPLETS
The design and control of the rheological properties of oil-based drilling fluids
are crucial for successful drilling operations because the fluid performs several
critical functions, such as hole cleaning (particle transport) and ensuring wellbore
stability [149].
One of the physical characteristics of the fluid that relates to rheology is the
size of the water-in-oil emulsion droplets. The use of nuclear magnetic reso￾nance pulsed field gradient diffusion measurements was shown to determine the
droplet size distributions in oil-based drilling fluid analogs and a commercial
formulation [149].
The nuclear magnetic resonance pulsed field gradient allows these optically
opaque samples to be measured without dilution, and the measurement is sensitive
only to the liquid components.
Through simulation and experiment, the suitability of a low-field benchtop
nuclear magnetic resonance instrument (commonly used for rock core analysis in
the petroleum industry) for measuring droplet size distributions in these fluids is
explored. Despite limitations on the available gradient strength and the bulk diffusion
coefficient of the brine, droplet radii in the range of 1-50 μm were measured. The
low-field nuclear magnetic resonance instrument could be shown to be suitable for
characterizing drilling fluids and similar complex emulsions [149].
1.4.8 FRACTAL MODELS
The microstructures of the drilling fluid can change in the course of circulation due to
different shearing actions from the pipe or the annular to bit water way in the drilling
process. A hydrate formation can occur, which affects the performance of the drilling
fluid and the stability of the wall.
Since the dynamical microstructure of the drilling fluid is very complicated, the
characteristics of the microstructure of a water-based polymer drilling fluid under a
different shearing action of 600 and 6000 r min−1 were studied [150]. According to1.4 Measurement of properties 51
the fractal theory, the fractal models of the microstructures of a drilling fluid were
established on the basis of the Sierpinski carpet model [151] and the Menger sponge
model [152].
The microstructure was analyzed quantitatively using Image Pro Plus software
[150]. The results showed that the microstructure is comprised of the skeleton
structure formed by polymer and pores filled with small molecules such as inorganic
salt ions and hydration molecules. The strong shearing action can change the shape
of the skeleton structure. The microstructure of drilling fluid has fractal features,
and the fractal models can be described by the fractal model of the original skeleton
area (volume), the fractal model of area (volume) of pores, and the fractal model of
number of pores.
The larger the porosity of drilling fluid microstructure, the smaller the fractal
dimension of space distribution of the skeleton structure, and the smaller the fractal
dimension of number ∼ size distribution of pores. The fractal dimension is between
1 and 2 in the planar space.
Finally, the process of heat transfer was analyzed in the microstructure of drilling
fluid, and the fractal model of heat transfer was set up. All these findings will
support a theoretical basis for establishing the models of mass and heat transfer of
the decomposition of natural gas hydrates in the drilling fluid [150].
Electrocrushing drilling
Electrocrushing drilling uses a pulsed power technology to drill a borehole in a rock
formation [153]. The pulsed power technology repeatedly applies a high electric
potential across the electrodes of an electrocrushing drill bit, which ultimately causes
the surrounding rock to fracture.
The fractured rock is removed from the vicinity of the electrocrushing drill
bit by drilling fluid. Although drilling fluids used in conventional mechanical drill
bit drilling methods also remove fractured rock from the vicinity of the drill bit,
thereby allowing drilling to progress downhole, drilling fluids suitable for use
with a conventional mechanical drill bit are typically not suitable for use with an
electrocrushing drill bit. Electrocrushing drilling fluids have a sufficiently high￾frequency dependent dielectric constant (also referred to as dielectric constant)
and dielectric strength, and a sufficiently low electrical conductivity to allow an
electrocrushing drill bit to direct an arc of electric current through a portion of the
rock in the formation, heating water and other materials in the rock and causing that
rock and surrounding rock to fracture.
Examples of electrocrushing drilling fluids with polar oil and a nonpolar oil and
glycerine carbonate are shown in Table 1.12.
Polar oils tend to have dielectric constants or dielectric strengths that are too
low for electrocrushing drilling. As a result, glycerine carbonate may be added to
the polar oil to improve these properties because it has a high dielectric constant
and moderate dielectric strength, and is more oil-soluble than many other alkylene52 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

carbonates. However, the amount of glycerine carbonate in the electrocrushing
drilling base oil may be limited by its high electric conductivity.
The electrocrushing drilling fluid may further contain additives that are used in
conventional drilling fluids [154]. These additives may provide properties to the
electrocrushing drilling fluid similar to the properties they provide to conventional
drilling fluids. However, some additives used in conventional drilling fluids may not
be suitable for an electrocrushing drilling fluid due to their effects on dielectric con￾stant, dielectric strength, or electric conductivity, or because they are not compatible
with an electrocrushing drill bit.
In particular, additives may include a lost circulation prevention material, such
as a bridging material or a fluid loss control agent, a rheology modifier, such as a
viscosifier or a thinner, a weighting agent, a solid wetting agent, an acid or H2S
scavenger, or a lubricant [154].
The electrocrushing drilling fluid or base fluid also contains water. Water has a
low viscosity and a high dielectric strength, but it also has a high electric conductivity,1.5 Additives 53
thus potentially limiting its proportional volume in an electrocrushing drilling fluid
or base fluid. The electric conductivity of water further increases if salts are dissolved
in the water, a frequent occurrence during drilling [153].
The dielectric constant and electric conductivity of an electrocrushing drilling
fluid may be measured using a network analyzer or inductance, capacitance, and
resistance meter equipped with a particular fixture, such as a liquid test fixture, to
allow the measurement [154].
The frequency dependent complex dielectric constant of a fluid may be deter￾mined by the following equation, which includes its real and imaginary parts:
(ω) = 
r(ω) + j
r (ω) = r(ω)0 + j
σ (ω)
ω (1.2)
Here, (ω) is the frequency dependent complex dielectric constant, 
r(ω) is the
real part of the dielectric constant, 
r (ω) is the imaginary part of the dielectric
constant, and j = −
√1 , that is, j = square root over (−1).
Equipment suitable to measure the dielectric strength of an electrocrushing
drilling fluid over a given voltage rise time is generally not commercially available,
but it may be constructed by attaching an adjustable voltage supply to electrodes
immersed in the fluid and otherwise electrically insulated from one another, such that
an electric field may be created between the electrodes using the adjustable voltage
supply when it applies a voltage across the electrodes [154]. The electrodes may
be any shape, such as spheres or plates. The electrodes are separated by a distance
D. An ammeter is located in the circuit between the adjustable voltage supply and
the negative electrode. The adjustable voltage supply may be used to provide high
voltage pulses with an adjustable peak voltage and voltage rise time.

1.5.1 THICKENERS
A variety of compounds useful as thickeners is shown in Table 1.13. Subsequently,
the individual compounds are explained in detail.
Polymers
Thickener polymers include poly(urethane)s (PUs), poly(ester)s, PAMs, natural
polymers, and modified natural polymers [173].
pH responsive thickeners
The viscosity of ionic polymers is dependent on the pH. In particular, pH responsive
thickeners can be prepared by copolymerization of acrylic or methacrylic acid ethyl
acrylate or other vinyl monomers and tristyrylpoly(ethyleneoxy)x methyl acrylate.
Such a copolymer provides a stable aqueous colloidal dispersion at an acid pH lower54 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

than 5.0 but becomes an effective thickener for aqueous systems upon adjustment to
a pH of 5.5 to 10.5 or higher [174,175].
Mixed metal hydroxides
By addition of mixed metal hydroxides, typical bentonite muds are transformed to an
extremely shear thinning fluid [176]. At rest these fluids exhibit a very high viscosity
but are thinned to an almost water like consistency when shear stress is applied.
In theory, the shear thinning rheology of mixed metal hydroxides and bentonite
fluids is explained by the formation of a three dimensional, fragile network of mixed
metal hydroxides and bentonite.
The positively charged mixed metal hydroxide particles attach themselves to the
surface of negatively charged bentonite platelets. Typically, magnesium aluminum
hydroxide salts are used as mixed metal hydroxides.
Mixed metal hydroxides demonstrate the following advantages in drilling [177]:
• high cuttings removal,
• suspension of solids during shutdown,
• lower pump resistance,
• stabilization of the borehole,
• high drilling rates, and
• protection of the producing formation.1.5 Additives 55
Mixed metal hydroxide drilling muds have been successfully used in horizontal
wells, in tunneling under rivers, roads, and bays, for drilling in fluids, for drilling
large-diameter holes, with coiled tubing, and to ream out cemented pipe.
Mixed metal hydroxides can be prepared from the corresponding chlorides treated
with ammonium [178]. Experiments done with various drilling fluids showed that
the mixed metal hydroxides system, coupled with propylene glycol [179], caused the
least skin damage of the drilling fluids tested.
Thermally activated mixed metal hydroxides, made from naturally occurring
minerals, especially hydrotalcites, may contain small or trace amounts of metal
impurities besides the magnesium and aluminum components, which are particularly
useful for activation [180].
Mixed hydroxides of bivalent and trivalent metals with a three dimensional
spaced-lattice structure of the garnet type (Ca3Al2[OH]12) have been described
[181,182].
1.5.2 LUBRICANTS
Bit lubricants are dealt with in Chapter 4 in detail. During drilling, the drill string
may develop an unacceptable rotational torque or, in the worst case, become stuck.
When this happens, the drill string cannot be raised, lowered, or rotated. Common
factors leading to this situation include:
• cuttings or slough buildup in the borehole,
• an undergauge borehole,
• irregular borehole development embedding a section of the drill pipe into the
drilling mud wall cake, and
• unexpected differential formation pressure.
Differential pressure sticking occurs when the drill pipe becomes imbedded in the
mud wall cake opposite a permeable zone.
The difference between the hydrostatic pressure in the drill pipe and the formation
pressure holds the pipe in place, resulting in a sticking pipe. Differential sticking may
be prevented, and a stuck drill bit may be freed, using an OBM or an oil-based or
water-based surfactant composition.
Such a composition reduces friction, permeates drilling mud wall cake, destroys
binding wall cake, and reduces differential pressure. Unfortunately, many of such
compositions are toxic to marine life.
Hagfish slime
Hagfish are marine craniates of the class Agnatha or Myxini are also known as
Hyperotreti. Some researchers regard Myxini as not belonging to the subphylum
Vertebrata, because they are the only living animals that have a skull but not a
vertebral column [183].
Despite their name, there is some debate about whether they are strictly fish, since
they belong to a much more primitive lineage than any other group that is placed56 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
in the category of fish (Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes). The earliest fossil record
dates back approximately 550 million years, or earlier to the Lower Cambrian period.
Their unusual feeding habits and slime-producing capabilities have led members of
the scientific community and popular media to dub the hagfish as the most disgusting
of all sea creatures. Although hagfish are sometimes called slime eels, they are not
eels at all.
Hagfish are long and vermiform, and can excrete copious quantities of a slime
or mucus of unusual composition. When captured and held, for example, by the
tail, they secrete the slime, which expands into a gelatinous and sticky goo when
combined with water. If they remain captured, they can tie themselves in an overhand
knot which works its way from the head to the tail of the animal, scraping off the
slime as it goes and freeing them from their captor, as well as the slime.
Recently it has been reported that the slime entrains water in its microfilaments,
creating a slow-to-dissipate viscoelastic substance, rather than a simple gel, and it has
been proposed that the primary protective effect of the slime is related to impairment
of the function of a predator fish’s gills [184]. It has been observed that most of the
known predators of hagfish are varieties of birds or mammals. It has been proposed
that the lack of marine predators can be explained by a gill-clogging hypothesis,
wherein one purpose of the slime is to impair the gill function of marine animals that
attempt to prey on the hagfish. If true, it could be regarded as a highly successful
evolutionary strategy against predatory fish.
Free-swimming hagfish also excrete slime when agitated and will later clear the
mucus off by way of the same traveling-knot behavior.
The reported gill-clogging effect suggests that the traveling-knot behavior is
useful or even necessary to restore the hagfish’s own gill function after sliming. An
adult hagfish can secrete enough slime to turn a 20 l bucket of water into slime in a
matter of minutes. Research is ongoing regarding the properties of the components
of hagfish slime filament protein.
Drilling formations below the bottom of a body of water have been
described [185].
Hagfish may be caused to generate bodily slime in a container at the surface. One
or more hagfish may be deployed in the container and agitated to cause secretion of
the slime. The slime may be lowered in a separate container along with the drilling
system when it is deployed on the water bottom. The slime may be mixed with sea
water for use as a drilling fluid during the drilling operations. Effective mixtures
may range from about one part hagfish slime to 10 parts of water to about one part
hagfish slime to about 20 parts of water. Drilling operations may be performed as
known in the art of sea floor drilling using the above described hagfish slime-water
mixture [186].
1.5.3 BACTERIA
Bacterial contamination of drilling fluids contributes to a number of problems. Many
of the muds contain sugar-based polymers in their formulation that provide an1.5 Additives 57
effective food source to bacterial populations. This can lead to direct degradation
of the mud. In addition, the bacterial metabolism can generate deleterious products.
Most notable among these is hydrogen sulfide, which can lead to decomposition
of mud polymers, formation of problematic solids such as iron sulfide, and corrosive
action on drilling tubes and drilling hardware [187]. Moreover, hydrogen sulfide is a
toxic gas.
Many polymers are used in drilling fluids as fluid loss control agents or
viscosifiers. Because of the degradation of the polymers by bacteria in drilling fluids,
an increase in fluid loss can occur. All naturally occurring polymers are capable of
being degraded by bacterial action. However, some polymers are more susceptible
to bacterial degradation than others. One solution, besides using bactericides, is
replacing the starch with low viscosity PAC, polyanionic lignin, or other enzyme￾resistant polymers [188].
Certain additives are protected from biodegradation while drilling deep wells by
quaternary ammonium salts [189]. This results in a considerably reduced consump￾tion of the additives needed.
Bacteria control is important not only in drilling fluids, but also for other oil
and gas operations. The topic is treated more extensively in Chapter 5. Some
bactericides especially recommended for drilling fluids are summarized in Table 1.14
and sketched out in Figure 1.6.

synthesized by solution polymerization [199]. These polymers were characterized by
Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and hydrogen
nuclear magnetic resonance.
The effects of crosslinking agent, transfer agent, and comonomer contents of the
synthesized polymers on the fluid loss and the rheological properties of the heavy
drilling fluid containing these synthesized products were studied.
The stability and performance of the tetrapolymer were better in the heavy drilling
fluid at high temperatures and high salt concentrations. The fluid losses of the pre￾pared heavy drilling fluid by the tetrapolymer were 1.9 and 2.1 cm3/30 min in NaCl￾saturated water and formation water of Iran reservoirs at 150 ◦C, respectively [199].
Filtration control of a drilling fluid is important in the process of wellbore
construction, and it ensures the success of the drilling operation [200].
A swellable polymer microsphere was synthesized from methyl methacrylate,
butyl acrylate, and lauryl methacrylate using a suspension polymerization [200].
The swelling properties of the microspheres were characterized by a measurement
of the oil adsorption capacity [200]. First, the effect of the swellable polymer
microsphere on the filtration and rheological properties of virgin organic clay
dispersion was investigated. Then, the filtration and rheological properties of a
mineral oil-based drilling fluid in the presence of the swellable polymer microspheres
were elucidated under the respective conditions of hot aging temperature, oil-to-water
ratio, and density.
In addition, the filtration control properties between the swellable polymer mi￾crospheres and two traditional filtration loss additives, including modified lignite and
asphaltic additive, were compared. The addition of swellable polymer microspheres1.5 Additives 59
exhibited an obvious influence on the viscosity of oil-based drilling fluid, in
particular at a high concentration of 3 w/v%. Therefore, a lower concentration is
recommended.
After hot aging at 200 ◦C, the oil-based drilling fluid containing 1 w/v% swellable
polymer microspheres exhibited an API filtration loss decrease of 85%, and high￾temperature and high-pressure filtration loss decrease of 79% in comparison with
the base fluid. After hot rolling at 180 ◦C, the API filtration loss decreased by
2%, 24%, and 53%, and the high-temperature and high-pressure filtration loss
decreased by 42%, 54%, and 65%, respectively, when 1 w/v% asphaltic additive,
modified lignite and swellable polymer microsphere are in the presence of the
base fluid [200].
In addition to decreasing the filtration loss volume under high temperatures, the
incorporation of swellable polymer microspheres also improves the filter cake quality
of oil-based drilling fluid.
A swellable polymer microsphere is capable of adsorbing considerable base oil
and becoming swellable. Thus, the swellable polymer microspheres with favorably
deformable and compressible properties can effectively fill the voids of filter cake and
reduce permeability, which leads to a low filtration loss and minimization of solids
invasion [200].
1.5.5 CORROSION INHIBITORS
Corrosion inhibitors are the subject of several topics in petroleum industries, such as
transport and completion. They are detailed in Chapter 6.
1.5.6 VISCOSITY CONTROL
Bentonites are highly colloidal and swell in water to form thixotropic gels. This
property results from their micaceous sheet structure. Because of these viscosity￾building characteristics, bentonites find major use as viscosity enhancers or builders
in such areas as drilling muds and fluids, concrete and mortar additives, foundry and
molding sands, and compacting agents for gravel and sand, as well as cosmetics.
Most bentonites that are found in nature are in sodium or calcium form.
The performance of a calcium bentonite as a viscosity builder often can be
enhanced by its conversion to the sodium form. Crude bentonite can be upgraded
to prepare a variety of solutions that have unusually high aqueous viscosities [201].
The crude material is sheared and dried. Sodium carbonate is then dry blended with
the material and pulverized. These bentonite clays are self-suspending, self-swelling,
and self-gelatinizing when mixed with water.
The modification of bentonite with alkylsilanes improves the dispersing proper￾ties [202]. Incorporation of phosphonate-type compounds in bentonites for drilling
mud permits the blockage of free calcium ions in the form of soluble and stable60 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
complexes and the preservation or restoration of the initial fluidity of the mud [203].
The phosphonates also have dispersing and fluidizing effects on the mud.
Long horizontal drilling
In comparison to conventional vertical hole drilling, extended reach drilling wells
with a long horizontal section require a higher driving torque due to the increased
drag on the drill string, drill column, casing, and other equipment [204]. This has led
to higher friction and wear on the drilling equipment. Friction and wear preventive
properties of oil-based drilling fluid are therefore important to keep oil extraction
economical and sustainable.
The addition of small concentrations of hydrocarbon additives to a drilling
fluid has shown significant positive effects on these properties. The improvements
in friction and wear properties of drilling fluid with the use of friction reduction
additives were analyzed using a four-ball experimental configuration [204].
The method used in measuring the coefficient of friction is in accordance with the
ASTM D 5183 Standard [205] for testing petroleum additives. In these experiments,
the lower three balls were locked down in the fluid bath while the fourth ball rotated
with contact points submerged in the drilling fluid. The resultant torque on the lower
ball holder due to the spinning ball was measured.
The three additives that were used in this study are commonly used additives
as a general lubricant for friction and wear reduction. Additive A has a chemical
structure of a hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail with a double polar head group; the
polar head end adsorbs on metal surfaces and the hydrophobic tail assists in the
formation of a lubricant layer. Additive B has the same hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail
but with a single polar head. Additive C is a brown liquid composed of molybdenum
dialkyldithiocarbamate in oil.
The experiments resulted in wear in boundary and mixed lubrication regimes due
to significant metal-metal interaction.
The results of this study showed that liquid friction reduction additives with long
hydrocarbon tails and high metal affinity polar heads achieved better performance
than additives that contained molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate [204]. Energy
dispersive spectroscopy indicated lower levels of salts and corrosive chemicals on
the surface of the wear scars for the best-preforming additives.
Additive A was found to be superior compared to the other additives in reducing
the coefficient of friction. In addition, it provided the most stable coefficient of
friction results. The use of this additive yielded a coefficient of friction of 0.15±0.01,
which represents a 33% reduction compared to the base drilling fluid.
Surfactant additives
A nonionic and an anionic surfactant was used as an additive in water-based
drilling fluids to optimize their rheological and filtration properties [206]. 2-
Hexadecyloxyethanol was used as a nonionic surfactant, and an alkyl benzene
sulfonate served as an anionic surfactant.1.5 Additives 61
The rheology of water-based drilling fluid was taken after being hot-rolled for
16 h at 121 ◦C and 135 ◦C, while the filtration tests were conducted at temperatures
up to 149 ◦C.
It was found that nonionic and anionic surfactants in water-based drilling fluid
improved rheological and filtration properties [206]. Moreover, surfactant additives
are 41.3% more effective in reducing filtration loss compared to mud without
surfactants. The long chain of nonionic and ionic surfactant might result in a more
viscous fluid, blocking the pores and forming a tight filter cake.
The surfactants also caused water-based drilling fluids to become more resistant
at the higher temperature and they improved and stabilized the rheology and filtration
properties after the hot aging process [206].
Calcium carbonate water-based drilling fluid
The gel strength of drilling fluids plays a key role in drilling multilateral and long
horizontal reservoir sections. Losing the gel strength will accumulate drilled cuttings
and, as a result, lead to sticking of the drill string. Solving this issue is time￾consuming and increases the total cost of the drilling operations. The objectives of a
study were to [207]:
1. determine the rheological properties of calcium carbonate water-based drilling
fluid over a wide range of temperature;
2. assess the effect of adding nanoclay, bentonite, and nanosilica on the gel
strength problem associated with the current field formulation of calcium
carbonate water-based drilling fluids; and
3. optimize the concentration of bentonite, nanosilica, and nanoclay in the drilling
fluid.
The concentration of bentonite, nanoclay, and nanosilica was varied from 1% to
10%. Studies concerning the rheological properties confirmed that the gel strength
of the calcium carbonate water-based drilling fluid reached 0 lb/100 ft2 by increasing
the temperature to 93.33 ◦C. This issue could be solved by adding different concen￾trations of bentonite, nanoclay, and nanosilica [207].
At low bentonite concentrations of 3.33%, the gel strength still reduced with
time. At high bentonite concentrations of 10%, the gel strength increased with time.
The optimum concentration of bentonite was 6.66%, which yielded a flat rheology
profile of the gel strength. These results confirmed that the rheological properties
of water-based drilling fluid were optimized by using bentonite. Similarly, 7.5%
nanosilica showed optimum performance. Nanoclay was not effective in improving
the rheological properties of the calcium carbonate drilling fluid [207].
A surface modification procedure with the purpose of dispersing the clay in the
organic phase of a vegetable-oil-based drilling fluid was performed [208].
The fluids were prepared using soybean oil, lauryl alcohol triethoxylate, brine,
bentonite modified by hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide, and barite [208].
These compounds are shown in Figure 1.7.62 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

Bentonite clay modifiers [208].
The clay modification step was performed using three different concentrations
of the cationic surfactant. To evaluate the surface modification of the clays, surface
tension measurements and determination of contact angles on soybean oil with the
capillary rise method were performed.
A factorial design 23 with triplicate center point was conducted to evaluate the
influence of the concentration of hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide in clay
modification, viscosity enhancer concentration in the composition of the drilling
fluid, and temperature on the rheological properties of the fluid: plastic viscosity,
apparent viscosity, thixotropy, and yield strength.
When higher amounts of quaternary ammonium cations were adsorbed on the
clay surface, a decrease of the contact angle was observed, suggesting an increasing
affinity for soybean oil. The study of the effect of independent variables showed that
temperature is the most influential factor in the rheological properties of the prepared
fluid [208].
1.5.7 CLAY STABILIZATION
Selected clay stabilizers are shown in Table 1.15. Thermally treated carbohydrates
are suitable as shale stabilizers [215–217]. They may be formed by heating an
alkaline solution of the carbohydrate, and the reaction product may be reacted with a
cationic base. The inversion of nonreducing sugars may be first effected on selected
carbohydrates, with the inversion catalyzing the browning reaction.
1.5.8 FORMATION DAMAGE
Poly(acrylate)s are often added to drilling fluids to increase the viscosity and limit
formation damage. The filter cake is critical in preventing reservoir invasion by mud
filtrate. Polymer invasion of the reservoir has been shown to have a great impact on
permeability reduction [218]. The invasion of filtrate and solids in drilling in fluid
can cause serious reservoir damage.1.5 Additives 63

1.5.9 SHALE STABILIZER
Swelling due to shale hydration is one of the most important causes for borehole
instability. Three processes contributing to shale instability are considered [219]:
1. Movement of fluid between the wellbore and shale, which is limited to flow
from the wellbore into the shale.
2. Changes in stress and strain, which occur during the interaction of shale and
filtrate.
3. Softening and erosion, caused by invasion of mud filtrate and consequent
chemical changes in the shale.
Adding a shale stabilizer to drilling fluids is an effective way to control clay
swelling [220]. A copolymer of AAm and acrylonitrile has been found to be
effective as a shale hydration swelling retarder. Experimental results showed that
the inhibitors developed have good properties to inhibit shale hydration swelling,
especially their quaternized product. 2-Hydroxybutyl ether and polyalkyl ether
modified poly(galactomannan)s have been described as useful shale inhibitors [221].
A copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride (MA) with alkylene oxide-based
side chains is effective as a shale stabilizer [222]. A variety of poly(oxyalkylene
amine)s may serve as shale inhibition agents. It was found that poly(oxypropylene)
diamine H2N−CH(CH3)CH2[−OCH2CH(CH3)]x−NH2 [223] is the best, with64 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

Poly(ethylene glycol) grafted nano-silica composite
A shale stabilizer based on poly(ethylene glycol) grafted nano-silica composite
(PEG-NS) could be synthesized [229].
Conventional techniques were used to characterize the PEG-NS. The results of
testing showed that the structure of PEG-NS was in agreement with the design
objective. The particle size of PEG-NS ranged from 110 to 434 nm, and PEG-NS
had good thermal stability.
A pressure transmission test, pore structure characterization of shale, and rolling
recovery test were applied to evaluate the comprehensive performance of PEG-NS for
its use as a shale stabilizer. The data indicated that PEG-NS could effectively retard
the pore pressure transmission and reduce the permeability of the shale sample. PEG￾NS could adsorb onto the shale surface and a dense plugging film could finally coat
on it. Moreover, PEG-NS exhibited a better inhibition performance compared with
that of potassium chloride and polymeric alcohol (JHC) at the same concentration.
Thus, PEG-NS could be a good shale stabilizer in water-based drilling fluids for
drilling reactive shale formations [229].
Biodegradable food-grade shale stabilizer
Shale stabilizers can be added to a drilling fluid to help to minimize the adverse
effects of the water on a water-sensitive formation. It has been discovered that food￾grade proteins can be used as a shale stabilizer in aqueous-based drilling fluids.
A biodegradable shale stabilizer additive has been developed. The shale stabilizer
additive [230]:
1. is made from a protein selected from the group consisting of legumes, casein,
nuts, whey protein, gelatins, quinoa, teff, egg whites, baker’s yeast, spirulina
algae, hemp seeds, and combinations thereof;
2. is food grade per the US Food and Drug Administration regulations as of
January 9, 2014; and
3. provides a shale retention of at least 85% for the subterranean formation.1.5 Additives 65

The ingredients and their respective concentrations for three different drilling
fluids are shown in Table 1.17. Each of the drilling fluids had a density of 11 pounds
per gallon ppg.
In Table 1.17, the compounds have the following functions: BARAZANo˝ D
PLUS: viscosifier, PACU˚
-R: filtration control agent, DEXTRIDo˝ E filtration control
agent, BARABUFo˝ pH buffer, barite; weighting agent. Here, drilling fluid No. 1 is a
control fluid without any shale stabilizer additive. Drilling fluids No. 2 and No. 3 also
have varying concentrations of a defatted soy flour as the shale stabilizer additive.
The drilling fluids No. 2 and No. 3 exhibited comparable rheologies to the control
fluid No. 1. Moreover, all of the drilling fluids had comparable plastic viscosity, yield
point properties, and gel strengths.
The drilling fluids No. 2 and No. 3 contained the shale stabilizer additive,
exhibited less fluid loss compared to the control fluid No. 1. This indicates that
the shale stabilizer additive also reduces the amount of fluid loss. Fluids No. 2 and
No. 3 have a much higher shale retention compared to fluid No. 1. Moreover, fluid
No. 3, which contained the shale stabilizer additive in the highest concentration,
had a higher shale retention compared to fluid No. 2. This indicates not only
that the defatted soy flour works effectively as a shale stabilizer, but also that the
concentration of the shale stabilizer additive can be adjusted to provide the optimum
shale retention value [230].
Horsetail extract
Field Horsetail or Common Horsetail, Equisetum arvense L., is a kind of herb from
the Equisetaceae family. This self-grown herb usually occurs in wet places such as
swamps, marshes, and next to roads and rivers [231].
Horsetail extract was used as a shale stabilizer [231]. Its inhibition performance
was studied in laboratory experiments and compared with that of potassium chloride
and polyamine. In addition, its antiswelling mechanism was analyzed.66 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
A bentonite inhibition test, a sodium bentonite sedimentation test, a dynamic
linear swelling test, and a hot rolling cutting dispersion test were used. The results of
these tests indicated the following [231]:
1. The bentonite is not capable of being hydrated or dispersed in solution with the
Horsetail extract.
2. The Horsetail extract can reduce the swelling of the bentonite and prevent
disintegration and dispersion of cuttings in an aqueous medium.
3. The extract is reasonably comparable and competitive with potassium chloride
and polyamine in terms of inhibition performance.
The constituents of the Horsetail extract have active hydroxyl groups, which are
capable of forming hydrogen bonding with surfaces of bentonite particles, leading
to a decrease of the water absorption on surfaces of the bentonite particles, which
results in a swelling reduction of the bentonite. In addition to its good antiswelling
ability, Horsetail extract is ecofriendly, readily available, and inexpensive [231].
Polymer microsphere emulsion
A polymer microsphere emulsion as a high-performance shale stabilizer for
water-based drilling fluids was prepared using emulsion polymerization [232]. As
monomers, styrene, n-butyl acrylate, and 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic
acid (AMPS) were used. In this polymer, styrene and n-butyl acrylate units act
as hydrophobic groups. 2-Acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid units act as
hydrophilic groups to improve the dispersion stability of the polymer microspheres
in water-based drilling fluids. The particle sizes in the polymer microsphere emulsion
in aqueous solution ranged from 90 to 320 nm.
The polymer microsphere emulsion was found to exhibit an excellent salt toler￾ance and temperature resistance. The plugging performance of polymer microsphere
emulsion was tested through pressure transmission tests. The results of these tests
indicated that the polymer microspheres in the polymer microsphere emulsion could
effectively plug shale pores and reduce shale permeability [232].
In addition, rolling recovery tests were used to evaluate the shale hydration
inhibition performance of the polymer microsphere emulsion. It was found that
the polymer microsphere emulsion demonstrated excellent performance in terms of
decreasing the shale hydration potential. These factors make a polymer microsphere
emulsion a promising shale stabilizer for water-based drilling fluids that are used to
drill shale formations [232].
Amphoteric polymers
An amphoteric polymer, made from acrylamide, styrene, and butyl acrylate, was
evaluated for its use as a shale borehole stabilizer and for its ability to counter the
problem of well instability during shale gas exploration and development [233].
The hydrophilic groups in the amphoteric polymer increased the adsorption be￾tween the amphoteric polymer and the shale formation, and the hydrophobic groups
reduced the hydrophilicity of the sodium bentonite. The addition of 1.6% amphoteric
polymer resulted in a water contact angle of the sodium bentonite/amphoteric1.5 Additives 67
polymer that was more than 40◦ larger than that of the sodium bentonite. The
amount of linear swelling decreased by 37.81% and the hot-rolling recovery rate
of the shale cuttings was more than 60% higher in the 1.6% amphoteric polymer
solution than in deionized water [233].
The amphoteric polymer exhibited micro/nanometer globules with an average
diameter of 250.4 nm in an aqueous solution. This was in agreement with the
results of the morphology tests, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The morphology tests, elemental analysis,
and thermogravimetric analysis showed that the polymer was evenly dispersed in the
aqueous solution and effectively adsorbed onto the sodium bentonite instead of the
free water.
The soft globules changed under pressure and effectively plugged the various
pores in the formation. Due to the hydrophobicity and the plugging effect, the ampho￾teric polymer prevented the sodium bentonite aggregation and reduced the filtration
loss [233]. The American Petroleum Institute (API) filtration loss of the basic mud
containing 1.6% amphoteric polymer was reduced by 56.67% compared to the basic
mud without amphoteric polymer after aging at 150 ◦C.
Due to the excellent inhibition of the shale hydration and the micro/nanometer
plugging performance, the amphoteric polymer has a potential application as a
borehole stabilizer in drilling fluids [233].
An amphoteric copolymer was synthesized from the monomers acrylamide,
dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride, and N-vinylpyrrolidone. This copolymer was
used as a high temperature-resistant shale stabilizer [234].
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spec￾troscopy confirmed the successful synthesis of the amphoteric copolymer.
The inhibitive performance of the amphoteric copolymer was systematically
evaluated and compared with three other commonly used shale stabilizers, including
the anionic potassium poly(acrylamide), cationic poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium
chloride), and the amphoteric polymer FA367 (Sichuan Guangya Polymer Chemical
Co., Ltd.) [234].
The results demonstrated that the amphoteric copolymer displayed excellent
performance in the linear swelling test, hot-rolling recovery experiment, and shale
immersion test. Furthermore, the amphoteric copolymer combined the advantages
of high shale recovery percentages of poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride)
and maintaining shale pellet integrity of anionic potassium poly(acrylamide), while
avoiding the drawbacks of enormous filtration volume of poly(dimethyl diallyl
ammonium chloride) and low shale recovery percentages of anionic potassium
poly(acrylamide). These excellent properties indicated that the amphoteric copoly￾mer would be suitable as a shale stabilizer in a water-based drilling fluid to drill
high-temperature shale formations [234].
Cyclodextrins
Cyclodextrins are a family of compounds made up of sugar molecules chemi￾cally bonded together in a ring [235]. More particularly, cyclodextrins are cyclic68 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
oligosaccharide comprising at least six glucopyranose units joined by α-(1,4) glyco￾sidic linkages. Cyclodextrins result from renewable plant matter, namely amylaceous
matter. Their biodegradability and their nontoxicity make them products that are
entirely tolerated by the environment.
Common cyclodextrins contain six to eight glucopyranose units, where α￾cyclodextrin has six glucopyranose units, β-cyclodextrin has seven glucopyranose
units, and γ -cyclodextrin has eight glucopyranose units. Cyclodextrins are pro￾duced from starch by means of enzymatic conversion. They are used in food,
pharmaceutical, and chemical industries, as well as agriculture and environmental
engineering [235].
Examples of cyclodextrin derivatives are methyl-α-cyclodextrin and hydro￾xypropyl-α-cyclodextrin. A suitable shale stabilizer has been reported as β￾cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin [235].
1.5.10 FLUID LOSS ADDITIVES
Filtration control is an important property of a drilling fluid, particularly when
drilling through permeable formations where the hydrostatic pressure exceeds the
formation pressure. It is important for a drilling fluid to quickly form a filter cake
which effectively minimizes fluid loss, but which also is thin and erodible enough to
allow product to flow into the wellbore during production [236]. Fluid loss additives
are detailed in Chapter 2. The issues of lost circulation and wellbore strengthening
have been collected in a monograph [237].
The objective of a review was to provide in-depth insights into probability
and cost analyses of the current lost circulation materials and treatments used
around the world [238]. This is the second part (Part 2) of the state-of-the-art lost
circulation materials and treatment; the other part focuses on the trends and uses
[239]. Subsequently, a few fluid loss additives for drilling fluids are summarized for
quick reference (Table 1.18).
There are a number of methods that have been proposed to help to preventing
the loss of a circulation fluid [248]. Some of these methods use fibrous, flaky, or

granular materials to plug the pores as the particulate material settles out of the slurry.
Examples are given in Table 1.19.
Other methods propose to use materials that interact in the fissures of the
formation to form a plug of increased strength. Lost circulation additives are
summarized in Table 1.18.
Water swellable polymers
Certain organic polymers absorb comparatively large quantities of water, for ex￾ample, alkali metal poly(acrylate) or crosslinked poly(acrylate)s [258]. Such water￾absorbent polymers, insoluble in water and in hydrocarbons, can be injected into
the well with the objective of encountering naturally occurring or added water at
the entrance to and within an opening in the formation. The resulting swelling of the
polymer forms a barrier to the continued passage of the circulation fluid through that
opening into the formation.
The hydrocarbon carrier fluid initially prevents water from contacting the water￾absorbent polymer until such water contact is desired. Once the hydrocarbon slug
containing the polymer is properly placed at the lost circulation zone, water is mixed
with the hydrocarbon slug so that the polymer will expand with the absorbed water
and substantially increase in size to close off the lost circulation zone [243,259–261].
The situation is similar to an oil-based cement. The opposite mechanism is used by a
hydrocarbon-swellable elastomer [262].
Shear degradation of lost circulation materials
Lost circulation materials (LCMs) are widely used to mitigate fluid loss when drilling
permeable zones. Their effectiveness, however, generally declines with circulation
time, and this decline is linked to the reduction in the average size of the solids
components, or shear degradation.
Dimensional analysis and first-principle physics have been used to frame those
mechanisms into a scientific definition that directly connects the progressive LCM
size reduction to operational parameters such as the densities of particles and
suspending fluid, the size of particles, and the fluid viscosity.70 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
The introduction of large-sized materials in the drilling mud circulation system
has become a common practice during the past decades for the mitigation of lost
circulation while drilling in permeable intervals [263]. Solids with comparatively
large diameters are carried with the drilling mud and, when fractures occur, they
deposit in the fractures or at the opening of the fractures, successfully blocking
the discharge of fluid out of the wellbore. The effectiveness of such material was
observed, however, to decline over time as the drilling mud circulates through the
mud pumps, the drill string, the bit nozzles, the wellbore annulus, and the mud
recycling system.
The decline over time in the effectiveness of the LCMs and loss-prevention
materials during drilling is widely linked to the degradation of these components
that have an average size that drops with circulation time [263].
Numerous experimental studies have attempted to quantify the LCM degradation
by reproducing the root phenomena in the laboratory. The concept of shear degra￾dation has thus become a synonym for such studies, and it is widely used for the
selection of materials to be used in drilling operations.
The concept of shear degradation and its effectiveness in capturing the progressive
size reduction of LCM during circulation has been examined [263]. Using dimen￾sional analysis, the tendency of a material to degrade can be determined in advance,
whereby the density of the particles and suspending fluid, the size of particles,
and the fluid viscosity are examined as the governing parameters. Understanding
the underlying physics enables the selection of a more-shear-resistant engineered￾particle drilling fluid, regardless of its application.
Anionic association polymer
Another type of lost circulation agent is the combination of an organic phosphate
ester and an aluminum compound, for example, aluminum isopropoxide. The action
of this system as a fluid loss agent seems to be that the alkyl phosphate ester becomes
crosslinked by the aluminum compound to form an anionic association polymer,
which serves as the gelling agent [264].
Fragile gels
A fragile gel is a gel that can be easily disrupted or thinned under shear stress, etc.
But it can quickly return to a gel when the stress is alleviated or removed,
for example, as when the circulation of the fluid is stopped. Fragile gels may be
disrupted by a mere pressure wave or a compression wave during drilling. They break
instantaneously when disturbed, reversing from a gel back into a liquid form with
minimum pressure, force, and time.
Metal crosslinked phosphate esters impart a fragile progressive gel structure to a
variety of oil and invert emulsion-based drilling fluids, both at neutral or acidic pH.
The amount of phosphate ester and metal crosslinker used in a drilling fluid
depends on the oil type and the desired viscosity of the drilling fluid. Generally,
however, more phosphate ester and metal crosslinker is used for gelling or enhancing1.5 Additives 71
the viscosity of the fluid for transport than is used for imparting fragile progressive
gel structure to the drilling fluid.
Thus, metal crosslinked phosphate ester compositions enhance the fluid viscosity
for suspending weighting materials in drilling fluids during transport of the flu￾ids [265].
Aphrons
Other lost circulation additives can be encapsulated. The encapsulation is dissolved
and the material swells to close fissures. Microbubbles in a drilling fluid can be
generated by certain surfactants, and polymers known as aphrons are a different
approach to reduce the fluid loss [266].
An aphron drilling fluid is similar to a conventional drilling fluid, but the
drilling fluid system is converted to an energized air bubble mud system before
drilling [267].
Permanent grouting
Lost circulation also can be suppressed by grouting permanently, either with cement
[268,269] or with organic polymers that cure in situ.
1.5.11 SCAVENGERS
Oxygen scavenger
Oxygen corrosion is often underestimated. Studies have shown that the corrosion
can be limited when proper oxygen scavengers are used. Hydrazine leads the group
of chemicals that are available for oxygen removal. Because of its special properties,
it is used for corrosion control in heating systems and in drilling operations, well
workover, and cementing [270].
Hydrogen sulfide removal
It is sometimes necessary to remove hydrogen sulfide from a drilling mud. Tech￾niques using iron compounds that form sparingly soluble sulfides have been devel￾oped, for example, with iron (II) oxalate [271] and iron sulfate [272]. The sulfur is
precipitated out as FeS. Ferrous gluconate is an organic iron chelating agent, stable
at pH levels as high as 11.5 [273].
Zinc compounds have a high reactivity with regard to H2S and therefore are
suitable for the quantitative removal of even small amounts of hydrogen sulfide [274].
However, at high temperatures they may negatively affect the rheology of drilling
fluids.

Star-shaped surfactant
A trimeric surfactant is a kind of oligomeric surfactant, which is composed of
three hydrophobic chains and three hydrophilic groups [276]. A star-shaped trimeric
anionic sulfonate surfactant was synthesized, that is, tris(2-dodecyl benzene sulfonic
acid sodium) ethyl amine. This compound is shown in Figure 1.8.
For the preparation of an emulsion, the following steps were used [276]:
Preparation 1–4: The synthesized star-shaped surfactant and white mineral oil were
mixed to prepare emulsions with different concentrations. A certain volume of white
mineral oil was stirred in the water bath of 50 ◦C. Then, some amounts of the star-shaped
surfactant were mixed into the oil and stirred (10,000 r min−1) for 30 min. Next, different
volumes of water, containing 20% of CaCl2, were slowly added to the solution and stirred
for 30 min.
The synthesized surfactant was used as the main emulsifier and alkylphenol ethoxylate
10 (OP-10) was used as the auxiliary emulsifier. A certain amount of oil, star-shaped
surfactant, OP-10, and organic bentonite were added into a flask in that order under
stirring for 30 min. Then, the water (20% CaCl2) was added to the above solution and
stirred (10,000 r min−1) for 30 min. Next, during continued high-speed stirring, calcium
oxide, calcium carbonate, and potassium chloride were slowly added into the above oil￾based system. The oil-based drilling fluid system is oil (160 ml) + water (20% CaCl2,
40 ml) + star-shaped anionic surfactant + 2.0% OP-10 + 2.0% organic soil + 4% CaO +
2.0% CaCO3 + 3.0% KCl.
For comparison, another drilling fluid was prepared by only adding the surfactant
OP-10 (2.5%), according to the above preparation method [276].
The emulsification properties of emulsions were obtained by the emulsification
rate experiment and a demulsification voltage measurement. The demulsification1.5 Additives 73

voltage is shown in Table 1.20. Here the aging temperature was 150 ◦C and the aging
time was 16 h.
It can be seen from Table 1.20 that the demulsification voltage of the drilling fluid
increases gradually with the increase of the content of the emulsifier, which indicates
that the emulsifying stability of drilling fluid increases with the increase of emulsifier
adding content. Before and after aging, demulsification voltage is more than 1000 V
when the emulsifier dosage is more than 2.0%, which indicates that the drilling fluid
has good stability.
The emulsion shows an excellent emulsification effect when the addition of star￾shaped anionic surfactant into oil-based drilling fluid was 2.0%. In addition, the
properties of surfactant in drilling fluid with different adding amounts were studied
by rheological properties, thermal stability analysis, and filtration experiments. The
results showed that the star-shaped anionic surfactant used as an emulsifier can
improve performance in an oil-based drilling fluid [276].
Biodegradable surfactants
Alkylpoly(glucoside)s (APGs) are highly biodegradable surfactants [277]. The ad￾dition of APGs, even at very low concentrations, to a polymer mud can drastically
reduce the fluid loss even at high temperatures. Moreover, both fluid rheology and
temperature resistance are improved.74 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

Deflocculants and dispersants
Deflocculants have a relatively low molecular weight. Complexes of tetravalent
zirconium with organic acids, such as citric, tartaric, malic, and lactic acids, and a
complex of aluminum and citric acid have been claimed to be active as dispersants.
Polymers composed of sodium styrene sulfonate, MA, and a zwitterionic func￾tionalized MA [278–281] are suitable. The dispersant is especially useful in dispers￾ing bentonite suspensions [282].
Polymers with amine sulfide terminal moieties are synthesized by using aminethi￾ols as chain transfer agents in aqueous addition polymerization reactions. The
polymers are useful as mineral dispersants [283].
Shale stabilizing surfactants
There are special shale stabilizing surfactants consisting of nonionic alkanolamides
[284], for example, acetamide monoethanolamines and diethanolamines. Acetone
and ethanolamine are shown in Figure 1.9.
Toxicity
Alkyl phenol ethoxylates are a class of surfactants that have been used widely in
the drilling fluid industry. The popularity of these surfactants is based on their cost
effectiveness, availability, and range of obtainable hydrophilic-lipophilic balance
values [285]. Studies have shown that alkyl phenol ethoxylates exhibit oestrogenic
effects and can cause sterility in some male aquatic species.
This may have subsequent human consequences, and such problems have led
to a banning of their use in some countries and agreements to phase out their use.
Alternatives to products containing alkyl phenol ethoxylates are available, and in
some cases they show an even better technical performance.
Defoamers
Defoamers are covered in Chapter 22.
1.5.13 HYDRATE INHIBITORS
Hydrate inhibitors for drilling fluids are summarized in Chapter 13.10.1.5 Additives 75
1.5.14 WEIGHTING MATERIALS
There are many weighting materials, including barite and iron oxides, to increase the
specific weight of a slurry. Conversely, the specific weight can be reduced by foaming
or by the addition of hollow glass particles.
Barite
Barite has been used as a weighting agent in drilling fluids since the 1920s. It is
preferred over other materials because of its high density, low production costs, low
abrasiveness, and ease of handling. Other weighting materials have been used, but
they are problematic or costly. Finished barite producers sometimes blend ores from
different sources to obtain the desired average density to meet API specifications.
Some barite ores contain alkaline-soluble carbonate minerals that can be detri￾mental to a drilling fluid, such as iron carbonate (siderite), lead carbonate (cerussite),
and zinc carbonate (smithsonite) [286]. Details of how to characterize barite have
been worked out [287]. Barite can be modified to become oleophilic [288,289].
To recover barite from drilling muds, a direct flotation without prior dewatering
and washing of the drilling muds has been described [290]. An alkyl phosphate is
used as a collecting and frothing reagent.
A novel barite-inhibition assay based on the nucleation and inhibition model
has been proposed and used to evaluate the thermal stability of phosphonates
and polymeric scale inhibitors with regard to their potential application in high
temperature wells [291]. Systematic experiments have been conducted to investigate
the time (minutes to days) and temperature (up to 200 ◦C) dependence of the thermal
degradation of the inhibitor, the impact of stainless steel and iron on the degradation
of inhibitors at high temperatures, and the difference between aging tests with
inhibitors in solution and with those inhibitors adsorbed on core materials.
The results not only enable a more accurate understanding of the thermal
degradation of scale inhibitors but also facilitate the selection and placement of scale
inhibitors for high-temperature oil and gas production [291].
The commonly used dynamic-tube-blocking methodology was modified. An
apparatus was built to study the nucleation kinetics of barite-scale formation at high
temperatures in the presence and absence of scale inhibitors [292].
Barite formation was detected by monitoring the pressure change over a
micrometer-sized in-line filter. This has been proved to be an easy and accurate
method to study mineral-scale-nucleation kinetics at high temperatures.
Additionally, the nucleation kinetics of barite at 0-25 ◦C with and without
thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors was investigated. By using this modified dynamic￾tube-blocking technique the nucleation kinetics of barite in 1 M NaCl solutions over
a temperature range from 25 to 200 ◦C and at various supersaturation conditions
was successfully measured. A relationship of the precipitation kinetics of barite as
a function of temperature and the saturation index could established [292].
In particular, the inhibition efficiency of the phosphonate inhibitor bis￾hexamethylenetriamine-penta (methylene phosphonic) acid on the barite precipitation76 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
has been evaluated. The effect of Ca2+ on the inhibition efficiency of this
inhibitor at a low temperature of 4 ◦C and at high temperatures of 175-200 ◦C was
investigated [292].
Sag stability
The sag stability of a drilling fluid is a growing concern, as the drilling of deviated
wellbores and high-pressure and high-temperature environments are of interest
[293,294]. The hotter the temperatures encountered during drilling, the greater the
likelihood of barite sag, and the deeper the drilling environment, the narrower the
equivalent circulating density window may be. The equivalent circulating density
window is the pressure difference between the pore pressure and the fracture gradient,
or the window the equivalent circulating density has to stay within to avoid a “kick”
of formation fluids and/or a fracturing of the formation.
Low equivalent circulating density drilling fluids require a low viscosity while
maintaining suspension properties of the drilling fluid to reduce or eliminate the
occurrence of sag. Instances of sag instability increase the likelihood of losing well￾bore control, possibly either fracturing the wellbore or taking a kick. Accordingly, an
ongoing need exists for drilling fluids with an enhanced sag stability [293,294].
Several drilling fluids having low equivalent circulating densities have been
developed that contain organophilic clay or organolignite additives. Although such
additives are effective at mediating barite sag in many cases, the exposure of
organophilic clays, in particular, to drill cuttings can alter the performance of the
drilling fluid. For example, organophilic clays may prevent the formation of ideal or
near-ideal thixotropic fluids that are initially viscous but then thin at a later time.
Drilling fluids that do not contain organophilic clays or organolignite additives
can have emulsion structures that are sensitive to low concentrations of solids therein.
In these cases, a minimum concentration of solids can be required to achieve an
adequate emulsion stability over time. Many drilling applications rely upon the
downhole introduction of solids into the drilling fluid in the form of drill cuttings
in order to stabilize the drilling fluid’s emulsion structure.
A drilling fluid has been reported that contains a base fluid, a weighting agent,
and a sag stability enhancer comprising poly(ethylene glycol). The poly(ethylene
glycol) has a molecular weight in the range of about 200-20,000 g mol−1. The drilling
fluid may contain less than about 30 ppb (85.5 kg m−3) of the sag stability enhancer.
The drilling fluid may contain from about 0.5 ppb (1.4 kg m−3) to about 20 ppb
(57.0 kg m−3) of the sag stability enhancer. The weighting agent can be barite having
a d50 of less than or equal to about 25 μm [293,294].
Smaller barite particles can be prepared by grinding an API [295] barite or any
other barite source and passing the ground barite through a sieve or mesh screen to
provide barite particles having the desired size range.
Table 1.21 shows a listing of particle size distributions in a typical ground barite
that can be passed through a 325 mesh screen. Such a 325 mesh barite may have a
median particle size or d50 of about 10-20 μm.1.5 Additives 77

Ilmenite
Environmental aspects suggest replacing barite with ilmenite. However, the use of
ilmenite as weighting material can cause severe erosion problems. Using ilmenite
with a narrow particle-size distribution around 10 μm can reduce the erosion to a
level experienced with barite [296].
Carbonate
It is reasonable to replace barite and iron-based weighting material with carbonate
if a high degree of weighting the muds is not required by the drilling conditions.
Besides being cheaper than barite, a carbonate weighting material is less abrasive,
which is especially important when drilling is performed in producing formations,
and it is readily soluble in hydrochloric acid. The main shortcomings of carbonate
powders are due to the presence of a coarsely divided fraction and noncarbonate
impurities [297].
Zinc oxide, zirconium oxide, and manganese tetroxide
Zinc oxide (ZnO), is a particularly suitable material for weighting because, it has a
high density, 5.6 g ml−1 versus 4.5 g ml−1 for barite. It is soluble in acids (e.g., HCl);
and its particle size can be designed so that it does not invade the formation. Acid
solubility is particularly desirable because dissolved ZnO can be produced through a
production screen without plugging it. A high density means less weighting material
is needed per unit mud volume to achieve a desired density.
The particle size, around 10 μm, is such that the ZnO particles do not invade the
formation core with the filtrate. On the other hand, the particle size it is not large
enough to settle out of suspension. Zirconium oxide possesses similar properties as
ZnO. It has a density of 5.7 g ml−1 and is soluble in nitric acid and hot concentrated
hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, and sulfuric acids. Therefore, a filter cake formed from
zinc oxide or zirconium oxide then can be dissolved. The high acid solubility of
ZnO makes it particularly suitable as weighting material [298]. On the other hand,
manganese tetroxide (Mn3O4) is so fine that it invades the formation with the filtrate.78 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
Hollow glass microspheres
Initially, glass microspheres were used in the 1970s to overcome severe lost
circulation problems in the Ural Mountains. The technology has been used in other
sites [299]. Hollow glass beads reduce the density of a drilling fluid and can be used
for underbalanced drilling [300–302]. Field applications have been reported [303].
1.5.15 ORGANOCLAY COMPOSITIONS
It has long been known that organophilic clays can be used to thicken a variety of
organic compositions. Such organophilic clays are prepared by the reaction of an
organic cation with a clay. If the organic cation contains at least one alkyl group
containing at least 8-10 carbon atoms, then such organoclays have the property of in￾creasing viscosity in organic liquids and thus providing rheologic properties to a wide
variety of such liquids including paints, coatings, adhesives, and similar products.
It is also well known that such organoclays may function to thicken polar or
nonpolar solvents, depending on the substituents on the organic salt. The efficiency of
organophilic clays in nonaqueous systems can be further improved by adding a polar
organic material with low molecular weight to the composition. Such polar organic
materials have been called dispersants, dispersion aids, and solvating agents. The
most efficient polar materials have been found to be low molecular weight alcohols
and ketones, particularly methanol and acetone.
Organophilic clays are generally prepared by reacting a hydrophilic clay with an
organic cation, usually a quaternary ammonium salt compound produced from a fatty
nitrile. Examples of hydrophilic clays include bentonite, attapulgite, and hectorite.
Native clay surfaces have negatively charged sites and cationic counter ions
such as sodium and calcium cations. Thus, the clay may be treated with a cationic
surfactant to displace the cations that are naturally present at the clay surfaces. The
cationic surfactant becomes tightly held to the surfaces through electrostatic charges.
In this manner, the hydrophilic nature of the clay is reversed, making it more soluble
in oil. Bentonite that primarily contains sodium cations is known as sodium bentonite.
Those monovalent sodium cations may be easily displaced from the clay, making a
large number of anionic sites available [304].
Quaternary ammonium compounds contain nitrogen moieties in which one or
more of the hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogen are substituted by organic
radicals. One of the most popular quaternary ammonium compounds for organophilic
clays is dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium chloride. Tallow is composed
from unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, including mainly oleic acid, palmitic acid,
stearic acid, and other minor fatty acids.
The oil solubility of this compound is enhanced by its almost complete hydro￾carbon structure and its two long chain alkyl groups. Further, its two methyl groups
do not sterically interfere with close packing of the ammonium cation to the clay
surface.
The dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium chloride surfactant, however,
cannot be efficiently activated at relatively low temperatures. Improved cationic
surfactants have been developed in which the ammonium compounds have greater1.5 Additives 79
numbers of alkyl groups. One such surfactant includes a benzyl group that greatly
enhances the performance of organophilic clays at cold temperatures [304].
There is a synergistic action of two or more types of organic salts in the presence
of an organic anion. The combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic salts
and an organic anion provides an organophilic clay gellant, which exhibits improved
gelling properties in nonaqueous systems [305].
Examples are dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow quaternary ammonium chloride
and methyl bis-poly(oxyethylene) (15 units) cocoalkyl quaternary ammonium chlo￾ride and the salts from stearic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid [306–309].
Biodegradable organophilic clay
Organophilic clays are treated with a quaternary ammonium surfactant having an
amide linkage. Quaternary ammonium surfactants are shown in Figure 1.10.
The surfactants are based on stearamides. The benzyl group greatly enhances the
performance of organophilic clays at cold temperatures near 7 ◦C.
This type of cationic surfactant is substantially biodegradable, meaning that it
is capable of being decomposed by natural biological processes. In particular, it
undergoes aerobic biodegradation, which is the breakdown of organic chemicals by
microorganisms when oxygen is present.
In this process, aerobic bacteria use oxygen as an electron acceptor and degrade
organic chemicals into smaller organic compounds, often producing carbon dioxide
and water as the final product [304].
Therefore, organophilic clays treated with the biodegradable cationic surfactant
may be used in drilling fluids for drilling a wellbore without being concerned that
the surfactant could accumulate in the environment. As such, the surfactant usually
never reaches toxic levels that could harm the surrounding environment and the life
supported by that environment [304]. The organophilic clay is suitable for both an
oil-based fluid and an invert emulsion type.

Poly(vinyl neodecanoate)
Organophilic clays are commonly used and traditionally believed to be necessary for
the suspension of drill cuttings. However, formulations have been developed with
improved suspension properties without having organophilic clays added [310].
Additives for clayless formulations are emulsion copolymers of 2-ethylhexyl
acrylate (EHA) and AA. However, at elevated temperatures it is likely that some
acrylate will hydrolyze to AA, thus raising the content of the AA moieties in
the copolymer. For certain applications, vinyl neodecanoate may be effectively
substituted for EHA as comonomer [310].
The drilling fluids do not need viscosifiers or additional suspension agents and
generally do not need for its effectiveness fluid loss control agents or filtration control
additives. The rheological properties of such a drilling fluid remain stable over a
broad temperature range even after exposure to high temperatures [310].
Since the space is limited at some well sites, such as on offshore platforms, it
may be advantageous to have efficient drilling fluid additives at hand, which can be
formulated using as few additives as possible.
1.5.16 MISCELLANEOUS
Additives for unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs
An unconsolidated sandstone reservoir is a type of an unconventional reservoir.
Usually it has an extremely high permeability. Its maximum permeability can reach
as high as 4000 mPa s. In addition, the pressure coefficient of this kind of reservoir
is low at about 1, due to its shallow buried depth [311]. During the process of
exploitation, several common problems such as water sensitivity, speed sensitivity,
and temperature sensitivity can occur [312].
In a study, bentonite, filtrate reducer, inhibitor, and other additives were optimized
according to the characteristics of unconsolidated sandstone formation and several
properties such as rheology, filter loss, and inhibition [311].
A new drilling fluid system was developed, and it was finally determined to
contain the components in amounts as shown in Table 1.22; the properties are shown
in Table 1.23.

In an immersion experiment, no obvious cracks on core samples were found. The
result showed that this drilling fluid system can effectively clean an unconsolidated
sandstone borehole, and its filter loss performance, rejection capability, and antipol￾lution properties are relatively good [311].
Reticulated bacterial cellulose
Reticulated bacterial cellulose may be used in place of a conventional gellant or in
combination with conventional gellants to provide enhanced drilling muds [313]. The
addition of relatively small quantities of reticulated bacterial cellulose to wellbore
drilling muds enhances their rheologic properties.
Scleroglucan
Scleroglucan is a poly(saccharide) secreted by the mycelia of certain microorgan￾isms. It is produced by aerobic fermentation of d-glucose by such microorganisms.
Scleroglucan has been proposed as a better alternative to xanthan gum for drilling
fluid compositions [314].
For drilling fluid applications, scleroglucan can be used in unrefined form. It
is an effective thickener for water [315] and enhances the lubricating and cleaning
power of WBMs [316,317]. In drilling of deviated wells, scleroglucan permits better
cleaning of the well [318]. A further application is in drilling jobs concerning large￾diameter wells [319–321].
Uintaite
Uintaite is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mineral classified as an asphaltite. It is a
natural product whose chemical and physical properties vary and depend strongly on
the uintaite source. Uintaite has also been called Gilsonite. Gilsonite is a registered
trademark of American Gilsonite Co., Salt Lake City, Utah.
General purpose Gilsonite brand resin has a softening point of about 175 ◦C, and
Gilsonite HM has a softening point of about 190 ◦C, and Gilsonite Select 300 and
Select 325, which have softening points of about 150 and 160 ◦C, respectively. The82 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
softening points of these natural uintaites depend primarily on the source vein that is
mined when the mineral is produced.
Uintaite is described in Kirk-Othmer [322]. Typical uintaite used in drilling
fluids is mined from an area around Bonanza, Utah and has a specific gravity of
1.05 with a softening point ranging from 190 to 205 ◦C, although a lower softening
point (165 ◦C) material is sometimes used. It has a low acid value, a zero iodine
number, and is soluble or partially soluble in aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons,
respectively.
For many years uintaite and other asphaltic-type products have been used in
water-based drilling fluids as additives assisting in borehole stabilization. These
additives can minimize hole collapse in formations containing water sensitive,
sloughing shales. Uintaite and asphalt-type materials have been used for many
years to stabilize sloughing shales and to reduce borehole erosion. Other ben￾efits derived from these products include borehole lubrication and reduction in
filtration.
Uintaite is not easily water-wet with most surfactants. Thus, stable dispersions of
uintaite are often difficult to achieve, particularly in the presence of salts, calcium,
solids and other drilling fluid contaminants and in the presence of diesel oil. The
uintaite must be readily dispersible and must remain water-wet; otherwise it will
coalesce and be separated from the drilling fluid, along with cuttings at the shale
shaker or in the circulating pits. Surfactants and emulsifiers are often used with
uintaite drilling mud additives.
Uintaite is not water-wettable. Loose or poor bonding of the surfactant to the uin￾taite will lead to its washing off during use, possible agglomeration, and the removal
of uintaite from the mud system with the drilling wastes. Thus, the importance of the
wettability, rewettability, and storage stability criteria is evident [323].
An especially preferred product comprises about two parts Gilsonite HM, about
one part Gilsonite Select, about one part causticized lignite, and about 0.1-0.15 part
of a nonionic surfactant [324].
Sodium asphalt sulfonate
Neutralized sulfonated asphalt (i.e., salts of sulfonated asphalt and their blends
with materials such as Gilsonite, blown asphalt, lignite, and mixtures of the latter
compounds) are commonly used as additives in drilling fluids. These additives,
however, cause some foaming in water or water-based fluids. Furthermore, these
additives are only partially soluble in the fluids.
Therefore, liquid additives have been developed to overcome some of the
problems associated with the use of dry additives. On the other hand, with liquid
compositions containing polyglycols, stability problems can arise. Stable composi￾tions can be obtained by special methods of preparation [325]. In particular first the
viscosifier is mixed with water, then the polyglycol, and finally the sulfonated asphalt
is added.1.5 Additives 83
Formation damage by gilsonite and sulfonated asphalt
Laboratory experiments have been conducted with a chromium lignite-chromium
lignosulfonate mud system both without and with solid lubricants. These studies
include filtration loss, cake quality, and their impact on the formation.
A comparative evaluation has led to the conclusion that Gilsonite is a better
additive compared with sulfonated asphalt as it results in less filtration loss and
compact cake formation, thereby reducing formation damage. The flow studies have
indicated that the addition of these solid lubricants can be used in drilling fluids
without adverse impact on the producing zones [326].
Illitic sandstone outcrop cores
Illitic sandstone reservoirs are sensitive to HCl-based fluids. When HCl contacts
illite, it breaks down and causes fines migration and formation damage. The
migration of fines through the porous media will block the pores, reduce permeability,
and decrease the production rate of oil and gas wells. A thorough literature review
showed that all clay minerals are essentially unstable in HCl at temperatures greater
than 150 ◦C [327]. In turn, there is a need to search for stimulation fluids other than
HCl to stimulate deep sandstone reservoirs.
Alternative fluids to HCl/HF mud acids have been introduced to stimulate and
remove the damage from illitic sandstone reservoirs. These fluids contain chelating
agents such as hydroxyl ethylene diaminetriacetic acid and glutamic acid N,N￾diacetic acid [327]. Sandstone cores with different illite contents were examined.
Illite contents of 1%, 10%, 14%, and 18% of the sandstone cores were used in
coreflood experiments at 150 ◦C.
Different combinations of chelate and HF were tested to find the optimum ratio.
Computer tomography scans and permeability measurements before and after the
treatments were used to assess the effectiveness of each fluid in removing the damage
and in the stimulation of the sandstone cores. The results show that 15% HCl caused
a severe damage in the sandstone cores with different illite contents [327]. Hydroxyl
ethylene diaminetriacetic acid and glutamic acid N,N-diacetic acid solutions showed
a good compatibility with the illitic sandstone cores, up to 18% at 150 ◦C.
Permeability measurements showed that glutamic acid N,N-diacetic acid per￾formed better than hydroxyl ethylene diaminetriacetic acid at a pH of 4 at the same
molar concentrations [327].
1.5.17 MULTICOMPONENT ADDITIVES
Multicomponent additives for drilling fluids have been proposed. Such an additive
preferably comprises three primary components, namely a [2]
1. rate of penetration enhancer,
2. lubricant, and
3. clay inhibitor or stabilizer.84 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
Penetration enhancers are ester-based oils, which are potential carriers for other
additives, such as surfactants. The lubricant is a chlorinated wax. The clay stabilizer,
is a polyglycol. The three components are premixed in a single container, for ease in
use in adding to a drilling fluid system.
The pre-blended additive implies significant and advantages in its use. Once
a desired specific ratio is blended, then additions of the additive with that ratio
to a drilling fluid system are very much simplified, and the pre-blending eases
maintenance of the desired volumetric concentrations in the system for uniform
dispersion throughout the system. In addition, permits a quick addition to the overall
system, as opposed to adding each component singly [2].
1.6 CLEANING OPERATIONS
1.6.1 CUTTINGS REMOVAL
In drilling of deviated and horizontal wells, gravity causes deposits of drill cuttings
and especially fines, or smaller sized cuttings, to build up along the lower or bottom
side of the wellbore. Such deposits are commonly called cuttings beds. Buildup of
cuttings beds can lead to undesirable friction and possibly to sticking of the drill
string.
Removing the drill cuttings from a deviated well, in particular when drilled at a
high angle, can be difficult. Limited pump rate, eccentricity of the drill pipe, sharp
build rates, high bottom hole temperatures, and oval-shaped wellbores can contribute
to inadequate hole cleaning.
Well treatments or circulation of fluids specially formulated to remove such
cuttings beds are periodically necessary to prevent buildup to the degree that the
cuttings or fines interfere with the drilling apparatus or otherwise with the drilling
operation.
Commonly, the drilling operation must be stopped while such treatment fluids are
swept through the wellbore to remove the fines. Alternatively, or additionally, special
viscosifier drilling fluid additives have been proposed to enhance the ability of the
drilling fluid to transport cuttings, but such additives at best merely delay the buildup
of cuttings beds and can be problematic if they change the density of the drilling
fluid. A mechanical operation for removing cutting beds has also been used wherein
the drill string is pulled back along the well, pulling the bit through the horizontal or
deviated section of the well.
Barium sulfate can be used as a sweep material. The material should be ground
and sieved to a size range sufficiently small to be suspendable in the drilling fluid.
After adding the composition to the drilling fluid, the fluid is circulated in the
wellbore and allowed to remove the small cuttings or cuttings beds from the borehole
and deliver them to the well surface.
The composition and the cuttings are then removed from the drilling fluid in a
manner that prevents a significant change of the density of the drilling fluid. The1.6 Cleaning operations 85
composition is removed from the drilling fluid by sieving or screening the drilling
fluid, which may preferably be accomplished by the principal shale shaker in the
drilling operation [328].
Advancements in horizontal drilling technologies have been utilized to develop
unconventional resources such as shale gas and coal bed methane. However, wellbore
instability and difficulties in hole cleaning are combined with high-temperature,
high-pressure conditions in such sensitive formations [329]. Inefficient cuttings
removal out of the wellbore results in increasing drag and torque, pipe junction
and may induce lost circulation and consequently increases drilling nonproductive
time. Various drilling methods and hole cleaning technologies including downhole
tools and complex fluid systems have been implemented to transport cuttings out of
horizontal and highly deviated wellbore sections.
The factors that lead to cuttings settling and resuspension in horizontal and
deviated sections have been discussed in a review article [329]. Furthermore, the
various types of drilling sweeps and additives used with water-, oil-, and gas-based
drilling fluids to improve the cuttings lifting efficiency in horizontal wells have been
detailed. Also highlighted were bio-based additives and nanomaterials used with
unconventional reservoirs. Moreover, the various methods used in the removal of
drill cuttings were illustrated.
Factors affecting the removal of the cuttings have been evaluated and general
guidelines for selecting additives and sweep fluids were established. Finally, the main
laboratory techniques used to analyze the settling of cuttings behavior and the fluid
stability were presented [329].
1.6.2 JUNK REMOVAL
Drilling equipment that is broken or stuck in the hole can be dissolved by means of
a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids in the proportion of 1:3. To accelerate the
dissolving of the metal, a mixture containing 1.1 parts of sodium nitrate and 1.0 part
of monoethanolamine is added initially to the acids in the amount of 0.05-13.0 parts
per 100 parts of acid mixture. The acidic residue in the hole is neutralized by addition
of alkali and converted into drilling fluid by addition of polymer solution [330].
1.6.3 FILTER CAKE REMOVAL
As the drilling fluid is circulated, a layer of solids, referred to as a filter cake, is
usually formed on the walls of the wellbore. A certain degree of cake buildup usually
is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. Once the wellbore has been
drilled to a desired depth, the drill string and drill bit is removed from the wellbore,
and a pipe string, for example, casing, liners, etc., are be introduced into the wellbore.
Eventually, the wellbore may be conditioned by circulating the drilling fluid. The
purpose of this conditioning, is to remove as much of the filter cake and the gelled
drilling fluid from the walls of the wellbore as possible. However, sometimes this
conditioning process is not sufficient to remove the undesired material completely.86 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds

Acylation of N-Methyl-taurine.
Actually, problems with subsequent processing, for example, in primary cementing
operations may arise, because in general, a cement composition is not compatible
with the drilling fluid and the filter cake.
To mitigate these problems, a special chemical wash composition containing
surfactants can be introduced. Chemical wash compositions are sometimes addressed
as preflushes, with respect to subsequent operations.
An aqueous chemical wash solution contains sulfonated bisulfite lignin, and a
taurate. The sulfonated bisulfite lignin and the taurate are present in amounts of
0.1-5% [331]. The sulfonated lignin is produced by the bisulfite process, or by
sulfomethylation of a lignosulfonate with formaldehyde.
Taurates, sometimes addressed as taurides, are generally based on taurine, which
is also known as 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. Taurine occurs naturally in food. It
was first isolated from ox bile in 1827. Taurine derivates play an outstanding role in
biological and medial aspects [332]. Further they are used in cosmetic applications
and as surfactants.
Examples of suitable taurates useful for preflushes are N-methyl-N-cocoyl
taurate, N-methyl-N-palmitoyl taurate, and N-methyl-N-oleyl taurate. Also metal
salts of an N-alkyl taurate are useful. The preparation of such compounds proceeds
by the acylation of N-methyl taurine with the corresponding long chain acids [333],
c.f. Figure 1.11.
Additional additives may be included in the chemical wash compositions, such as
[331]:
• viscosifying agents,
• defoamers,
• curing agents,
• corrosion inhibitors,
• scale inhibitors, and
• formation conditioning agents.
For example, viscosifying agents are clays, diatomaceous earth, starches, or
polymers.1.7 Drilling fluid disposal 87
When drilling a wellbore in a subterranean formation, a fluid is pumped down
into the wellbore to cool the drill bit and to circulate cuttings from the subterranean
formation back to the surface [334]. This fluid with cuttings is referred to as drilling
fluid waste.
The drilling fluid waste may present environmental liabilities and be expensive to
dispose of at the surface. As a result, it may be desirable to dispose of the drilling
fluid waste by pumping the drilling fluid waste back into the subterranean formation.
However, particles in the drilling fluid waste may fall out of the drilling fluid waste.
A method for injecting a portion of a drilling fluid waste into a well has been
presented [334]. This method includes reducing a cross-sectional dimension of solids
in a slurry. It also involves measuring the properties of the slurry and of the well.
These properties are introduced in a model. The model represents the interaction of
the slurry with the well. From these data, it was identified that an additive can be put
into the slurry to get optimal properties. To adjust the viscosity of the slurry, additives
can be added such as clay, barite, sand, or feldspar [334].
1.7 DRILLING FLUID DISPOSAL
1.7.1 TOXICITY
Drilling fluids are known to exhibit a certain toxic potential and are bearing thus and
environmental risk. A specific problem arises in that drilling muds are composed,
unlike other most toxic agents, from a wide variety of chemicals. This issue makes it
difficult to predict the actual risk of a specific drilling mud. Methods concerning the
assessment of the toxicity of drilling muds have been developed [335].
The studies revealed that in 9% of the cases, acute toxicity of drilling muds
at concentrations of 1000-10,000 ppm was evidenced. The studies were performed
under laboratory conditions. Thus, it was possible to maintain certain concentration
over a prolonged period. However, in the natural environment, the concentration
drops down rapidly to background levels downcurrent to 200-1000 m.
In a more recent study, soil samples from oil and gas drilling and production
sites were analyzed for contaminating substances associated with drilling fluids
and petroleum products. The results reveal that the contamination of the soil is
widespread and persistent. However, it is generally localized in the immediate
vicinity of drilling and production activity. Most prominently, heavy metals, such
as barium, chromium, lead, and zinc were detected. Additional problems may cause
salinity, pH, and petroleum hydrocarbons.
No discernible pattern of contamination between well sites, could be observed.
This indicates the variability of methods and materials used in the drilling of
individual wells. Further, it was assumed that the levels of contaminating agents
found do not represent immediate environmental threats. However, the long-term
cumulative effects are largely unknown [336].88 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
The most consistently toxic bioassay phase is the suspended solid phase. This
phase consists of bentonite, cuttings and also soluble components. This toxic
behavior has been explained by a certain chemical toxicity of a mud compo￾nent, or by a physical toxicity by abrading or clogging epithelial tissue, that is,
respiratory or digestive body surfaces. In addition, the danger of marine animals
from exposure to waste drilling muds may originate also from chemical toxicity.
Further details are beyond the scope of this text and it is referred to the literature
[335, pp. 329].
In a long-term study, the influence of increased levels of petroleum hydrocarbons
upon soil and plants have been studied. Clean soil and different doses of drilling
fluids and crude oil were applied. The changes in some chemical parameters of soil,
plant density and crop yields have been correlated. Drilling fluids showed a stronger
impact on the chemical properties of the studied soil, while the plant density and yield
were more strongly affected by crude oil. The soil levels of petroleum hydrocarbons,
mineral oils, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were significantly reduced after
the first trial year [337].
For the reasons, illustrated above, there is a need to take care on the waste man￾agement of drilling muds. Subsequently, selected solutions of the waste management
are discussed.
Environmentally persistent pollutants
Operational discharges of spent drilling fluid, produced water, and accumulated drill
cuttings from the oil and gas industry are a continuous point source of environmental
pollution. To meet the strict environmental standards for waste disposal, the oil and
gas industries are facing numerous challenges in technological development to ensure
a clean and safe environment.
Methods to identify different sources of waste streams and how different chemi￾cals turn into environmentally significant pollutants have been reviewed [338].
An oil-based drilling fluid may perform very well in deeper drilling and drilling
in harsh geological conditions, but at the end of the production a significant amount
of persistent toxic pollutants may be released into the environment.
When oil or gas drilling fluids and cuttings are disposed on the ground surface,
the liquid fraction of chemicals start seeping through the ground, and eventually these
chemicals destroy living organisms in the ground and pollute the groundwater [339].
The well drilling process produces two main types of wastes: drill cuttings and spent
mud.
The accumulation of drill cuttings is estimated in the range of 130-560 m3 per
well and the possible sources and components of wastes are [340]:
1. waste lubricants: lube oil, grease;
2. spacers: mineral oil, surfactants;
3. spent contaminated water-based muds: mud, mineral oil;
4. water-based mud cuttings: formation solids, water-based mud, mineral oil;
5. spent oil-based muds: mud, mineral oil;1.7 Drilling fluid disposal 89
6. oil-based mud cuttings: formation solids;
7. spent bulk chemical: cement, bentonite, barites, viscosifiers, thinners, fluid loss
protective additives; and
8. spent special products: scavengers, defoamers, tracers.
The chemical composition of drill cuttings at the time of disposal is an indication
of the drilled subsurface strata and concentration of the chemical components of the
drilling fluid that remain attached to the cuttings.
The presence of certain metals in drill cuttings and their potential effect on the
environment have been shown. Among these metals, Cd, Cr, Ni, As, Co, Cu, Pb, V,
Zn, Al, Ba, Fe, and Mn are predominant in drill cuttings [338].
Some of the metals are suspected to be present in concentrations significantly
higher than the naturally occurring concentrations of the sediments, which makes the
disposal of these wastes a critical environmental concern.
Pollutants may nowadays be categorized in two different groups of pollutants:
toxic, persistent chemicals with bioaccumulation properties, and chemicals with a
deleterious effect on the aquatic environment as shown in Table 1.24 according to
European Council Directive 76/464/EEC [341].
In addition, a detailed list of classes of hazardous chemicals has been presented
[342]. This list also contains the issue of wastes from petroleum refining, natural gas
purification, and pyrolytic treatment of coal as discussed in Chapter 5.

Health effects
The environmental and human effects of exposure to drilling waste have been
discussed [343].
The most common health effects from drilling fluid for humans are skin irritation
and contact dermatitis [344]. Other effects include headache, nausea, eye irritation,
and coughing. The effects are caused by the properties of the drilling fluid itself and
the inherent properties of the additives.
The route of exposure can have different effects on human health. Workers may
be exposed to drilling fluids either by inhaling aerosols and vapors or by skin contact.
Exposure to drilling fluid may occur in several scenarios. Activities during drilling
such as sampling, maintenance, inspection, etc. can expose workers to drilling fluid.
A very high potential of inhaling mist and vapors exists along the flow line from the
bell nipple to the solid-control equipment such as desander, centrifuge, shakers, shale
shaker, and desilters. In addition, exposure is a function of duration and frequency.
Factors such as drilling fluid temperature flow rate, well depth, well section, and
kinematic viscosity of the drilling fluid can influence the exposure level in the
working site.
To manage exposure and risk to humans, a hierarchy of control must be
considered, as follows [343]:
Elimination: Elimination of hazardous and toxic material in the drilling fluid
can significantly reduce the risk to humans during drilling operation. Every
operation should strive to reduce the number of chemicals being used to an
absolute minimum.
Substitution: Using low-toxicity drilling fluid or WBDF can reduce the carcino￾genic hazard of exposure to drilling fluid.
Engineering controls: Ideally the design of the workplace should include the
engineering controls such as a ventilation system and enclosed drilling fluid
circulation system, which is required to provide a workplace, which minimizes
exposure of hazardous substances to the workforce.
Administrative controls: Exposure and effects to human health can be managed
and assessed by monitoring the level of exposure by conducting the air mon￾itoring and skin monitoring. Workplace health surveillance and maintaining
health records of the workers can also help in term of exposure management. A
proper management of the working hours can also help to reduce the potential
exposure to the workers.
Personal protective equipment: The final protection and the most significant con￾trol is personal protective equipment. Examples are masks, rubber gloves,
splash goggles, rubber boots, and coveralls. This equipment is important to
act as the last barrier of protection for the workforce.
A drilling fluid can potentially have adverse effects on the environment. The
degree of effect depends on the type, dosage, and exposure duration of chemicals1.7 Drilling fluid disposal 91
[345]. The physical and chemical properties of the drilling wastes determine its
hazardous characteristics and environmental impact potential. The most common
measure of the potential environmental impact of a material is its toxicity [340].
Oil-based drilling fluids are considered to be the most toxic drilling fluids and
possess the most severe environmental effect compared to water-based drilling fluid
and SBDF. Direct discharge of drilling fluid can affect the local ecosystem in three
ways: direct toxic effects of drilling waste, by smothering organisms, and anoxic
conditions caused by microbial degradation of the organic components in waste.
A case study conducted on an aquatic fish population indicated that the chemicals
in drilling fluids are toxic to the fish population [345]. A laboratory study was
conducted to determine the toxic concentration for fish of drilling fluid and base oil
over a 4-day period. A significant difference in mortality was observed between the
control and test concentration. This showed that the chemicals are toxic to aquatic
life. The mortality rate increased with increasing concentration of chemicals [343].
Treatment of a waste oil-in-water drilling fluid
The technical issues of a waste oil-in-water drilling fluid treatment in the JiDong
oilfield of China were summarized [346].
A moisture determination device was used to determine the water content of
the waste oil-in-water drilling fluid. In this device, the moisture was first extracted
with petroleum ether, and then condensed and collected. The water content in the
sample was calculated by reading the extracted water volume. The residual content
was determined by weighing the dried residue after pumping and filtering the liquid
inside. Finally, the oil content was calculated by the dispersion method.
After an oil-water-solid three-phase separation, the oil recovery rate was found to
be up to 90% and the recycled oil can be reused for preparation of new drilling fluid.
In addition, the harmless treatment of wastewater and sludge from waste oil-in￾water drilling fluid after oil recycling was studied. The results showed that wastewater
after treatment was clean, the contents of chemical oxygen demand and oil decreased
from 993 and 21.800 mg l−1 to 89 and 3.6 mg l−1, respectively, which meets the
requirements of grade one of the National Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard
[347] (GB8978).
The pollutants in the sludge after harmless treatment are decreased below the
national standard, which achieved the goal of resource recovery and harmless
treatment on waste oil-in-water drilling fluid [346].
1.7.2 CONVERSION INTO CEMENTS
Water-based drilling fluids may be converted into cements using a hydraulic blast
furnace slag [348–352]. Hydraulic blast furnace slag is a unique material that has
low impact on rheologic and fluid loss properties of drilling fluids. It can be activated
to set in drilling fluids that are difficult to convert to cements with other solidification
technologies.92 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
Hydraulic blast furnace slag is a more uniform and consistent quality product
than are Portland well cements, and it is available in large quantities from multiple
sources. Fluid and hardened solid properties of blast furnace slag and drilling
fluids mixtures used for cementing operations are comparable with the properties
of conventional Portland cement compositions.
1.7.3 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
In response to effluent limitation guidelines promulgated by the EPA for discharge of
drilling wastes offshore, alternatives to water-based and OBMs have been developed.
Thus synthetic-based muds are more efficient than WBMs for drilling difficult and
complex formation intervals and have lower toxicity and smaller environmental
impacts than diesel or conventional mineral OBMs.
Synthetic drilling fluids may present a significant pollution prevention opportu￾nity because the fluids are recycled, and smaller volumes of metals are discharged
with the cuttings than for WBMs. A framework for a comparative risk assessment
for the discharge of synthetic drilling fluids has been developed. The framework
will help identify potential impacts and benefits associated with the use of drilling
muds [353].
1.8 CHARACTERIZATION OF DRILLING MUDS
Important parameters to characterize the properties of a drilling mud are viscosity,
specific weight, gel strength, and filtration performance.
1.8.1 VISCOSITY
Viscosity is measured by means of a Marsh funnel. The funnel is dimensioned so that
the outflow time of 1 qt (926 ml) fresh water at 21 ◦C is 26 s.
Viscosity also is measured with a rotational viscometer. The mud is placed
between two concentric cylinders. One cylinder rotates with constant velocity. The
other cylinder is connected with a spring. The torque on this cylinder results in a
deviation of the position from rest, which may serve as a measure of viscosity.
Gel strength is obtained with the rotational viscometer when the maximal
deflection of the pointer is monitored when the motor is turned on with low speed,
the liquid being at rest for a prolonged time before, for example, for 10 min. This
maximal deflection is referred to as a 10-min gel.
Smart magnetic drilling fluid
Magnetically controllable, water-based drilling fluid systems that contain custom￾made iron oxide Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were investigated [354].
These materials could potentially offer in situ control of the drilling fluid viscosity
and yield stress, under the application of an external magnetic field. Custom-made1.8 Characterization of drilling muds 93
Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by the coprecipitation method. Magnetite
precipitates according to the following reaction:
Fe2+ + 2Fe3+ + 8OH− → Fe3O4 + 4H2O. (1.3)
The nanoparticles were added to the base fluid at two different concentrations
of 0.5% and 1.0%. The magnetorheological properties were analyzed via a strain￾controlled rheometer equipped with a magnetic field source in parallel-plate geome￾try giving a range of magnetic flux densities of up to 1 T (Tesla).
The rheological behavior of the produced fluids was examined at room tem￾perature of 25 ◦C as a function of volume fraction, shear rate, and magnetic field
strength. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the nanoparticle
was spherical with a mean diameter of 6-8 nm, while the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern revealed peaks corresponding to pure crystallites of magnetite (Fe3O4) with
no impurities.
Superconducting quantum interference device analysis proved that the prepared
nanoparticles displayed a superparamagnetic behavior. Magneto-rheological mea￾surements of the nanofluids indicated an increase in the yield stress of up to +75%
upon exposure to a magnetic field of 0.1 T, while larger changes of up to +609%
were observed for higher concentrations of nanoparticles with intensities up to
0.7 T [354].
The viscosity of the nanofluids increased monotonically under the presence of
a magnetic field at all shear rates. The original rheological profile of the developed
fluids was recovered upon removal of the magnetic field with an average deviation of
+20% from the initial value, reflecting the disintegration of particle chains because
of random movements due to Brownian forces [354].
These results highlight the potential for the development of multifunctional smart
fluids that are greener and economical with tailor-made properties that can reversibly
modify their rheological characteristics. Their unique ability to withstand a rapid
increase in the viscosity and yield stress in the presence of an external magnetic field
could enable drillers to formulate drilling fluid systems with instantaneous responses
to continuously changing drilling environments, leading to enhanced well control and
contributing to decreased nonproductive time and costs [354].
Drilling fluid temperature and borehole shrinkage
Frozen soil is a porous elastic-plastic-viscous material with temperature-sensitive
properties. Borehole shrinkage occurs due to the plasticity and creep of frozen soil
that ensues during drilling operations in cold regions [355].
Based on the change of mechanical properties of frozen soil during the heat
transfer process that occurs between the drilling fluid and the formation, a heat-fluid￾solid coupling model was established to analyze the borehole shrinkage behaviors in
frozen soil [355].94 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
The results of the study showed that during drilling operations, the plastic and
creep deformation of frozen soil will result in a shrinkage of the borehole. When the
borehole is drilled, a certain amount of plastic deformation will occur due to stress
concentration. As drilling operations continue, both plastic and creep deformation
gradually accumulate.
The borehole shrinkage is dominated by the initial temperature of the formation,
and the higher the formation temperature, the greater the shrinkage. At the same
formation temperature, the initial borehole shrinkage decreases with increasing
temperature of the drilling fluid, and the final shrinkage increases nonlinearly with
increasing temperature. The drilling fluid temperature should be close to 0 ◦C when
the formation temperature is high, to reduce the drilling time. When the formation
temperature is low, cold drilling fluid should be used to maintain borehole stability.
This study provides a theoretical basis for the selection of drilling fluid temperatures
during drilling operations in cold regions [355].
1.8.2 API FILTRATION
A filter press is used to determine the wall-building characteristics of a mud. This
press consists of a cylindrical chamber, which may withstand alkaline milieu. A filter
paper is placed on the bottom of the chamber. The mud is placed into the chamber
and a pressure of 0.7 MPa is applied. After 30 min the volume of filtrate is reported.
The filter cake is inspected visually and the consistency is noted as hard, soft, tough,
rubbery, or firm.
There is another procedure suitable for OBMs under high-pressure and high￾temperature conditions. Filtration is performed at 100 psi (0.7 MPa) and temperatures
of 93 ◦C. It should be noted that research has shown that there may be significant
differences between static and dynamic filtering.
Filtration properties
Nanoparticles
Nanoparticles have been recommended for the improvement in drilling fluid proper￾ties [356]. The rheological and filtration properties of water-based drilling fluid have
been improved through the addition of a carboxyl methyl cellulose/poly(styrene)
core-shell nanocomposite.
The core-shell nanocomposite was synthesized by a miniemulsion polymerization
method. The nano-carboxyl methyl cellulose and core-shell nanocomposite were
characterized by SEM, transmission electron microscopy, particle size analyzer, and
thermogravimetric analysis. The filtration and the rheological behavior of carboxyl
methyl cellulose, nanocarboxyl methyl cellulose, and core-shell nanocomposite were
compared [356].
Fluid loss, mud cake thickness, viscosity, weight, and pH of drilling fluid with
the core-shell nanocomposite additive were compared with those of conventional
carboxyl methyl cellulose and nano-carboxyl methyl cellulose particles. The mud1.8 Characterization of drilling muds 95

Core-shell nanocomposite 0.1 0.1 0.15 0.19 0.24 0.38 0.5
cake thicknesses of conventional carboxyl methyl cellulose, carboxyl methyl cellu￾lose nanoparticles, and core-shell nanocomposites are shown in Table 1.25.
The results showed a significant decrease in mud cake thickness and fluid loss
when a core-shell nanocomposite was used, compared with conventional carboxyl
methyl cellulose and nanocarboxyl methyl cellulose [356].
The viscosities of the three drilling fluid samples were measured using Fann 35
at the speeds of 300 and 600 rpm, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
Afterward, the apparent viscosity (AV), plastic viscosity (PV), and yield point (YP)
were calculated using the following equations:
AV = 1
2
θ600 (cP) (1.4)
PV = θ600 − θ300 (cP) (1.5)
YP = 4.78(θ300 − PV) (dyn cm−2) (1.6)
The viscosity of the three additives had the same trend with insignificant
changes while a lower yield point is obtained for drilling fluid containing core-shell
nanocomposites.
Mud weight and pH were almost identical for all three additives. Thus, the core￾shell nanocomposite can be an alternative additive to control mud cake thickness
and fluid loss while maintaining the other significant properties in an acceptable
range [356].
Sulfate-modified polysaccharide
The hypothesis that the content in sulfate groups on polysaccharide chains ac￾tually drives both viscoelastic and filtration properties of water-based drilling
fluids was tested by comparing the performances of fluids formulated with dif￾ferent carrageenans [357]. Two hybrid carrageenans with different sulfate groups
were purposely extracted from sustainably cultivated seaweeds. The structure of
κ-carrageenan is shown in Figure 1.7.
The rheological characterization of their solutions in 0.5 mol l−1 NaCl showed
that these polysaccharides do not form helices under concentration and salt con￾ditions used in water-based drilling fluid formulations. Water-based drilling fluids96 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
with the more sulfated carrageenan showed the best filtration properties, and their
viscous attributes were only surpassed by a water-based drilling fluid formulated
with a commercial mixture of less sulfated carrageenans showing helical conformers.
This study showed that, for carrageenans, the sulfate groups drive the water-based
drilling fluid filtration properties. However, more complex bentonite-polysaccharide
interactions and the presence of aggregating helical conformers seem to affect water￾based drilling fluid rheology [357].
Activated carbon
Activated carbon (AC) is a material that has powerful adsorptive properties [358]. It
has a surface area excess of 1000 m2 g−1 and a porous structure. Due to its properties,
activated carbon is a potential material to adsorb liquid and gas phase.
Activated carbon from palm oil shell was investigated for its solution filtration
loss in a water-based drilling fluid. The three general processes to produce activated
carbon are [358]:
1. dehydration of water by heating in an oven for 1 h at 100 ◦C;
2. carbonization by heating in an oven for 1 h at 300 ◦C; and
3. activation by heating in a furnace for 1 h at 1000 ◦C.
Scanning electron microscopy was used to determine the surface morphology of
the activated carbon products and to identify if the carbon was active. A sample of
water-based drilling fluid was prepared. A standard API filtration test was carried
out to discover the effect of oil palm shell activated carbon on filtration loss drilling
mud [358].
The results showed that the filtration loss decreased from 21.3 ml with nonacti￾vated carbon to 15 ml with activated carbon. Scanning electron microscopy showed
that activated carbon has good pores and has good adsorption properties. This result
indicates that activated carbon is a potential material to control filtration loss in water￾based drilling fluid [358].
1.8.3 ALKALINITY AND pH
Alkalinity is measured by acid-base titration with methylorange or phenolphthalein
as indicator. Phenolphthalein changes color at pH 8.3, whereas methylorange
changes color at pH 4.3. At pH 8 the neutralization of the strong alkali ingredients
like NaOH is essentially complete.
Further reduction of the pH to 4 will also measure carbonates and bicarbonates.
Colorimetric tests and glass electrode systems are used to determine pH. Some
indicators are shown in Figure 1.12.
1.8.4 TOTAL HARDNESS
The sum of calcium and magnesium ions in the mud determines the total hardness.
These ions are analyzed with complexometric titrations using ethylene diamine
tetraacetic acid.1.8 Characterization of drilling muds 97

1.8.5 ROLLER OVEN
The effects of temperature and various chemical additives on the rheological,
filtration, and chemical properties of fluids and muds under simulated circulating
conditions can be elucidated in a roller oven [359,360]. The basic construction is
shown in Figure 1.13. A more detailed view can be found in the literature [359].
In this oven a motorized rollers are rotating a cylindrical cell containing the
sample under investigation. A heating element is disposed beneath the rollers
that heats the chamber to a predetermined temperature which is maintained by a
thermostat. A timer may be preset to start and end the test automatically without98 CHAPTER 1 Drilling muds
having an operator in constant attendance [359]. The roller oven is a versatile tool to
monitor aging, change of properties of fluids used in the petroleum industry [361].
1.8.6 SHALE WELLBORE STABILITY
Nanoparticles have been widely used to reduce wellbore instability problems of the
shale formation [362].
Nanoparticle-containing water-based drilling fluids and oil-based drilling fluids
were evaluated by running three new tests including spontaneous imbibition, swelling
rate, and acoustic transit time.
The results showed that, for the water-based drilling fluids, nanoparticles led
to higher plastic viscosity and yield point, and lower API filtration [362]. Because
the pore throats of the shale can be plugged by nanoparticles, imbibition amount,
swelling rate, and Young’s modulus reduction of shale decreased significantly. A
higher concentration of nanoparticles can induce a better plugging effect.
However, for the oil-based drilling fluids, nanoparticles did not show these
positive effects like the nanowater-based drilling fluids, and even led to some negative
effects such as higher filtration and larger Young’s modulus reduction. The main
reasons were that the silica nanoparticles can easily disperse in the water-based
drilling fluids, and effectively prevent the filtrate from invading into shale by plugging
pore throats. However, the same silica nanoparticles are difficult to disperse in oil￾based drilling fluids, and do not perform the expected functions. Thus, nanowater￾based drilling fluids have great potential to reduce the wellbore instability problems
of shale formation [362].
1.8.7 EFFECTS ON LOG DATA
Drilling fluids are carefully formulated to enable safe and efficient drilling of
subsurface formations and to minimize formation damage within reservoir sections.
Although the effects of these fluid on log data might have been identified they are
generally accepted as an unavoidable consequence of achieving cost effective and
productive wellbores [363].
The effects of drilling fluid chemicals on log data in general considered to be
minimal, as tool-specific corrections are applied to account for the fluid effects within
the borehole. These borehole corrections, however, only adjust tool responses to true
measurements of the bulk formation properties, and do not account for the effects of
invading fluid on the final petrophysical interpretation.
With the introduction of more complex drilling fluid chemistry, accounting for
the invading fluid properties becomes more complex and even more significant than
when the drilling fluid are simple water-based or invert oil emulsions.
To retain interpretation accuracy, the log analyst requires a complex modeling of
the effects of formate and bromide base brines, which induce different log responses
than other aqueous fluids. Other components, such as precipitating salts and param￾agnetic particles may also influence the measurements of some logging tools [363].References 99

2 Fluid loss additives
Comparative tables of fluid loss additives can be found in the internet [1]. Fluid loss
additives are also called filtrate-reducing agents. Fluid losses may occur when the
fluid comes in contact with a porous formation. This is relevant for drilling and
completion fluids, fracturing fluids, and cement slurries.
The extent of fluid loss is dependent on the porosity and thus the permeability
of the formation and may reach approximately 10 t/h. Because the fluids used in
petroleum technology are in some cases quite expensive, an extensive fluid loss may
not be tolerable. Of course there are also environmental reasons to prevent fluid loss.
2.1 MECHANISM OF ACTION OF FLUID LOSS AGENTS
Reduced fluid loss is achieved by plugging a porous rock in some way. The basic
mechanisms are shown in Table 2.1.
2.1.1 PORE SIZE MEASUREMENT BY NANOPARTICLES
The development of temperature sensitive and pressure sensitive nanosensors will
enable in situ measurements within the reservoir. The parameters involved in the
mobility of nanoparticles through porous and fractured media were investigated [2].
These parameters were particle size or size distribution, shape, and surface charge or
affinity to rock materials.
It was found that spherically shaped nanoparticles of a certain size and surface
charge are compatible with that expected in formation rock are most likely to
be transported successfully, without being trapped because of physical straining,
chemical, or electrostatic effects. Tin-bismuth nanoparticles of 200 nm and smaller
can be transported through Berea sandstone. Larger particles were trapped at the
inlet of the core, indicating that there was an optimum particle-size range. On the
other hand, the entrapment of silver nanowires occurs primarily because of their
shape [2].
The investigation of the flow mechanism of nanoparticles through a naturally
fractured greywacke core was conducted by injecting fluorescent silica microspheres.
Silica microspheres of different sizes (smaller than the fracture opening) could be
transported through the fracture.

Thus, it was demonstrated that by using microspheres it is possible to estimate
fracture aperture by injecting a polydisperse microsphere sample [2].
2.1.2 ACTION OF MACROSCOPIC PARTICLES
A monograph concerning the mechanism of invasion of particles into the formation
is given by Chin [3].
One of the basic mechanisms in fluid loss prevention is shown in Figure 2.1. The
fluid contains suspended particles. These particles move with the lateral flow out of
the drill hole into the porous formation. The porous formation acts like a sieve for
the suspended particles. The particles therefore will be captured near the surface and
accumulated as a filter cake.
The hydrodynamic forces acting on the suspended colloids determine the rate of
cake buildup and therefore the fluid loss rate. A simple model has been proposed in
Drill hole Filter cake

Vertical flow
Porous formation
FIGURE 2.1

the literature that predicts a power law relationship between the filtration rate and the
shear stress at the cake surface [4].
The model shows that the cake formed will be inhomogeneous with smaller
particles being deposited as the filtration proceeds. An equilibrium cake thickness
is achieved when no particles small enough to be deposited are available in the
suspension. The cake thickness as a function of time can be computed from the
model.
For a given suspension rheology and flow rate there is a critical permeability of
the filter, below which no cake will be formed. The model also suggests that the
equilibrium cake thickness can be precisely controlled by an appropriate choice of
suspension flow rate and filter permeability.
2.1.3 ACTION OF CEMENT FLUID LOSS ADDITIVES
Two stages are considered with respect to the fluid loss behavior of a cement
slurry [5]:
1. a dynamic stage corresponding to placement and
2. a static stage, awaiting the setting of the cement.
During the first period, the slurry flow is eroding the filter cake as it is growing;
thus a steady state, in which the filtration occurs through a cake of constant thickness,
is rapidly reached. At the same time, because the slurry is losing water but no solid
particles, its density is increasing in line with the fluid loss rate.
During the second period, the cake grows because of the absence of flow. It may
grow to a point at which it locally but completely fills the annulus: Bridging takes
place and the hydrostatic pressure is no longer transmitted to the deeper zones. From
the typical mud cake resistance it can be estimated that under both dynamic and static
conditions, the fluid loss could require reduction to an American Petroleum Institute
(API) value lower than what is generally considered a fair control of fluid loss.
2.1.4 TESTING OF FLUID LOSS ADDITIVES
Fluid loss prevention is a key performance attribute of drilling fluids. For water￾based drilling fluids, significant loss of water or fluid from the drilling fluid into
the formation can cause irreversible change in the drilling fluid properties, such as
density and rheology occasioning instability of the borehole. Fluid loss control is
measured in the laboratory according to a standard procedure for testing drilling
fluids [6].
Predictions on the effectiveness of a fluid loss additive formulation can be made
on a laboratory scale by characterizing the properties of the filter cake formed
by appropriate experiments. Most of the fluids containing fluid loss additives are
thixotropic.
Therefore, the apparent viscosity will change when a shear stress in a vertical
direction is applied, as is very normal in a circulating drilling fluid. For this reason,126 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives
the results from static filtering experiments are expected to be different in comparison
with dynamic experiments.
Static fluid loss measurements, provide inadequate results for comparing frac￾turing fluid materials or for understanding the complex mechanisms of viscous fluid
invasion, filter cake formation, and filter cake erosion [7]. On the other hand, dynamic
fluid loss studies have inadequately addressed the development of proper laboratory
methods, which has led to erroneous and conflicting results.
Results from a large-scale, high-temperature, high-pressure simulator were com￾pared with laboratory data, and significant differences in spurt loss values were
found [8].
Static experiments with pistonlike filtering can be reliable, however, to obtain
information on the fluid loss behavior in certain stages of a cementation process, in
particular when the slurry is at rest.
2.1.5 FORMATION DAMAGE
The damage of the formation resulting from the use of a filtration loss agent can be a
serious problem for certain fields of application. Providing effective fluid loss control
without damaging formation permeability in completion operations has been a prime
requirement for an ideal fluid loss control pill.
Filter cakes are hard to remove and thus can cause considerable formation
damage. Cakes with very low permeability can be broken up by reverse flow. No
high-pressure spike occurs during the removal of the filter cake.
Typically, a high-pressure spike indicates damage to the formation and wellbore
surface because damage typically reduces the overall permeability of the formation.
Often formation damage results from the incomplete back-production of viscous,
fluid loss control pills, but there may be other reasons.
2.1.6 REVERSIBLE GELS
Another mechanism for fluid loss prevention is caused by other additives, which are
able to form gels on a molecular mechanism.
2.1.7 BACTERIA
Instead of using polymers, the addition of bacteria cultures, which may form natural
polymers and could then prevent fluid loss, has been suggested. In one study, a
bacterial culture selected for its abundant exopolymer production was added to
drilling mud to determine whether the polyanionic cellulose (PAC) component could
be replaced without sacrificing viscosity or fluid retention [9].
The performance of the drilling mud was tested using a standard API test series.
The bacterial inoculum was not as effective in maintaining viscosity or preventing
fluid loss as was the PAC. However, the inoculum was capable of reducing the amount
of PAC required in the drilling mud.2.2 Inorganic additives 127
The combination of the bacterial inoculum with less expensive sources, for
example, carboxylated methyl corn starch, crosslinked hydroxypropyl corn starch,
and amine-derivatized potato starch, gave viscosity and fluid loss control as good
as or better than PAC alone. The bacterial strain tested was effective over a wide
range of drilling mud conditions with growth at varying pH (3-11), varying salinities
(0-15%), and a wide range of temperatures.
2.2 INORGANIC ADDITIVES
2.2.1 BENTONITE
Bentonite is an impure clay that is formed by weathering of volcanic tuffs. It contains
a high content of montmorillonite. Bentonites exhibit properties such as ability to
swell, ion exchange, and thixotropy. Properties can be modified by ion exchange, for
example, exchange of earth alkali metals to alkali metals. The specific surface can be
modified by acid treatment. Organophilic properties can be increased by treatment
with quaternary ammonia compounds.
2.2.2 SODIUM METASILICATE
Sodium silicate has been successfully used as a chemical grouting material for many
years. It is used in particular during drilling of high-permeability formations [10].
When an aqueous mixture of sodium silicate and an activating agent, such as an
ester, is injected into the ground, the silicate solution reacts to form a colloid which
polymerizes further to form a gel. The gel provides increased strength, stiffness, and
reduced permeability in predominantly granular soils.
For example, when an aqueous mixture of sodium silicate and an activating agent,
are injected into the ground, the silicate solution reacts to form a colloid which
polymerizes further in forming a gel. This gel provides increased strength, stiffness,
and reduced permeability in predominantly granular soils.
These properties have been utilized in water-based drilling fluid systems to
prevent fluid loss while drilling high-permeability formations, particularly during
drill-in and completion operations [11]. The gel produced by the silicate reaction
is soluble in both acids and bases.
The upper limit on amount of alkali metal silicate depends on the gel strength
necessary and the pore size in the formation. The bigger the pore size in the
formation, the higher the gel strength desired and, generally, the higher the desired
concentration of alkali silicate. As a practical matter, the concentration of alkali
silicate generally is about 40% because most commercial silicates are available in
this concentration.
Further, the drilling fluid system contains activating agents. The activating agent
is effective as it hydrolyzes, thereby decreasing the pH. Example for an activating
agent is formamide, or water-soluble esters, accelerating agents may be added to128 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives
accelerate the gel formation. A suitable accelerating agent is sodium aluminate
[10,11]. Examples for the formulation of drilling mud systems that use silicate for
fluid loss control have been given in detail [11].
2.2.3 ULTRA-FINE FILTRATE-REDUCING AGENTS
Methods are available for reducing the fluid loss and reducing the concentration
of polymer required to provide a desired degree of fluid loss control to a drilling
fluid and to a well servicing fluid, respectively [12]. The fluids contain, as usual
polymeric viscosifiers, a polymeric fluid loss additive and a water-soluble bridging
agent suspended in a liquid in which the bridging agent is not soluble.
It is important to add to the fluids a particulate, water-soluble, ultra-fine filtrate￾reducing agent. The particle-size distribution should be such that approximately 90%
of the particles are less than 10 μm, the average particle size being between 3 and
5 μm and the ultra-fine filtrate-reducing agent being insoluble in the liquid.
2.2.4 BRIDGING AGENTS FOR FLUID LOSS CONTROL
Common bridging agents include calcium carbonate, suspended salts, or oil soluble
reins. For lost circulation treatments outside the production interval, any suitably
sized product may be used, including mica, nutshells, and fibers [13].
The selection of an appropriate bridging material is more critical in the production
interval and during workover operations since the barrier should be completely
removed in preparation for placing the well back into production. As an alternative to
conventional bridging agents, chemically bonded ceramic particulates are desirable
because they are customizable as these particulates are made via a process similar to
that of mixing a cementitious material. As a result, their composition, and properties
can be varied, and they can be impregnated with desirable additives. Another
advantageous feature of these particular bridging agents is that they are soluble in
ammonium salts and chelating agents.
Starches are often used in conjunction with bridging agents. Starches are derived
from corn, wheat, oats, rice, potatoes, yucca, etc. Most starches usually comprise
about 27% amylose and about 73% amylopectin. These two polymers are intertwined
within starch granules. Granules generally are insoluble in cold water, but soaking in
hot water or under steam pressure ruptures their covering and the polymers hydrate
into a colloidal suspension. Amylose and amylopectin are non-ionic polymers that
do not interact with electrolytes. Derivatized starches, such as hydroxypropyl starch
and carboxymethyl starch are used in drill-in fluids, completion fluids, and various
brine systems as well as in drilling fluid systems.
When conventional starches are added to fluids comprising chemically bonded
ceramic particulates, problems may arise. When combined, the fluid gels to a point
where it ultimately has the consistency of paste. As a result, this combination is
unusable in downhole applications. This is unfortunate because the starch provides
an added means to ensure fluid loss control in a process using the desirable2.2 Inorganic additives 129
chemically bonded ceramic particulates. However, modified starches can overcome
these problems.
Ceramic particulate bridging agents are chemically bonded particulates. Chem￾ically bonded particulates are preferred because they have an inherent flexibility
in their composition, properties, and in their ability to act as carriers for desirable
additives such as breakers.
The bridging agents are substantially insoluble in water, but soluble in aqueous
ammonium salt cleanup solutions. An example of such a magnesium-based ceramic
particulate bridging agent is
MgO + KH2PO4 + 5 H2O → MgKPO4 × 6 H2O. (2.1)
Further examples are
MgO + H3PO4 + 2 H2O → MgHPO4 × 3 H2O,
MgO + NH4H2PO4 + 5 H2O → MgNH4PO4 × 6 H2O. (2.2)
The examples of ceramic particulate bridging agents that are described in Eq. 2.2 are
Newberyite, and Struvite, respectively [13]. The ceramic particulate bridging agent
utilized in the treatment fluids are generally added in an amount of 10%.
The modified starch compositions provide enhanced fluid loss control when used
in conjunction with ceramic bridging agents. These starches may be crosslinked
ether derivatives of a partially depolymerized starch. The molecular weight of the
crosslinked starch derivative is decreased by the partial depolymerization of the
starch polymer.
Formulations are shown in Table 2.2.
The starch in formulation of #1 is N-DRIL HT PLUS, which is a commonly used
starch available from Halliburton Energy Services. N-DRIL HT PLUS is a stabilized
non-ionic starch derivative (waxy maize) that seeks to control high pressure, high
temperature filtrate loss.
In combination with other polymers, such as xanthan, N-DRIL HT PLUS is
synergistic and yields improved suspension. However, when used in combination

with ceramic bridging agents, the combination will form a poor filter cake and will
become a thick gel.
In contrast, a modified starch is used in formulation #2. This composition forms
a tight filter cake, and does not form an unusable thick gel, even over a period of
24-48 h. The starch used in this recipe is BROMA FLAU˚
, which is commercially
available from TBC Brinadd of Houston, Texas.
2.3 ORGANIC ADDITIVES
Polymers and copolymers used for fluid loss additives are shown in Table 2.3.
2.3.1 TALL OIL PITCH
A fluid loss additive for well drilling fluids consists of air-blown tall oil pitch, which
has a softening point (ring and ball) of 100-165 ◦C. Tall oil pitch is available as the
residue from the distillation of tall oil. Its solubility is low in fatty acids and high in
fatty esters, higher alcohols, and sterols.
Blowing air through tall oil pitch at an elevated temperature partially oxidizes
and polymerizes the material and drives off volatiles. Blowing reduces the volume of
the pitch by 30% and increases the viscosity and the softening point. The softening
point of the resultant blown pitch is therefore a measure of the degree of oxidation￾polymerization that has occurred. It has been found that optimal properties as a fluid
loss additive are given by blown tall oil pitches that have a softening point between
125 ◦C and 130 ◦C [68].

2.3.2 MERCAPTANS FOR IRON CONTROL
Acid treatments are accompanied by very familiar problems linked with the presence
of iron in the acid that is pumped into the formations, essentially as a result of the
acid dissolving the rust in the casings during pumping, and possibly the dissolving
of iron-containing minerals in formation.
The presence of Fe3+ in the injected acid may cause, in contact with certain
crude oils, the precipitation of the asphaltic products contained in the oil in the
form of deposits of a vitreous aspect known as sludges. These leads to a practically
irreversible damage to the zone treated. The scale of precipitation generally increases
with the strength and concentration of the acid. The dispersibility of customary
additives, such as surfactants, is also affected by the presence of Fe3+ through the
formation of complexes.
When the injected acid is consumed by the dissolution of the minerals of the
formation, the presence of Fe3+ leads to the precipitation of a colloidal precipitate
of ferric hydroxide which damages the formation. For this reason, the use of iron
control additives is necessary in most acid treatments [69]. Suitable reducing agents
are compounds with a mercaptan functionality, as shown in Figure 2.2.
The efficiency of the reducing agent with a copper catalyst were tested with regard
to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ in a very to extremely acid medium has been tested.
The concentration of the reducing agent is 3×10−3 mol l−1. Copper chloride is used
as catalyst. The results are shown in Table 2.4.

2.3.3 BIODEGRADABLE WASTE
Attempts were made to develop an eco-friendly drilling fluid additive to regulate
filtrate and mud cake thickness as well as to assess other drilling fluid properties [70].
A biodegradable grass powder was selected as a fibrous fluid-loss agent for
comparison with a conventional chemical additive, starch. Fluid samples including
grass powder and starch additives were prepared in various concentrations to
examine the effect of concentration variation on the reference fluid. The effects
of introducing different concentrations of grass powder and starch on the physical
and the chemical properties of the drilling fluid (e.g., mud weight, plastic viscosity,
yield point, filtration characteristics, rheological properties, calcium content [Ca2+],
solid content, NaCl concentration, and pH) were evaluated. The evaluation included
conducting lab experiments with full-set measurements following the specifications
of the American Petroleum Institute (API) [70].
The test results of 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% grass powder were compared to the same
concentrations of starch. Starch was less effective than grass powder in improving
filtration specifications. For instance, in a low-temperature and low-pressure filtration
test, the fluid loss was decreased by 42% and 28% using 0.5% of grass powder
and starch additives, respectively. Similarly, in a high-temperature and high-pressure
filtration test, 0.5% of grass powder and starch decreased fluid loss by 26% and 3%,
respectively, compared to the reference fluid [70].
On the other hand, starch was more efficient than grass powder in terms of
improving the rheological properties for all different concentrations, while both grass
powder and starch had no effect on mud weight and only a negligible impact on the
solid content. In addition, grass powder additives resulted in increasing NaCl more2.3 Organic additives 133
than starch at different concentrations, while grass powder reduced the alkalinity and
Ca2+ more than starch for all concentrations as compared to the reference fluid.
In summary, the study showed that grass powder can reduce the amount of
nonbiodegradable waste, and it shows promise for being utilized as a supportive
biodegradable drilling fluid additive [70].
2.3.4 ALKYLPOLYGLUCOSIDE DERIVATIVES
Treatment fluids have been presented made from an emulsion-based fluid and an
alkylpolyglucoside derivative [71]. The emulsion-based fluid can be an oil-in-water
emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion (i.e., an invert emulsion).
Alkylpolyglucosides are nonionic surfactants. Alkylpolyglucosides contain an
oligomer or polymer of glucose residues and terminal alkyl group. The glucosidic
portion of the compounds is hydrophilic, while the alkyl component of the com￾pounds is lipophilic. The critical micelle concentration of the alkylpolyglucosides is
generally on the order of magnitude of 0.1% or less.
The modification of the relative lengths of the glucosidic and alkyl portions will
modify the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of the compound, as well as associated po￾larity and surface activity properties of the compound [71]. Some alkylpolyglucoside
derivatives are collected in Table 2.5.
The fluid loss control additives that are containing an alkylpolyglucoside deriva￾tive can provide a suitable fluid loss control under various conditions, for example,
at elevated temperatures [71].

2.3.5 SEEDS
Many conventional fluid loss control additives permanently reduce the permeability
of a subterranean formation, negatively affect the rheology of the treatment fluid in
which they are used, and/or reduce the rate at which the fluid is allowed to penetrate
or leak off into desirable locations within the subterranean formation [72]. Moreover,
while it may be desirable to control or prevent fluid loss for a given period of time,
in some instances it may become desirable to later allow flow through that portion of
the formation, such as in a reservoir zone once drilling is complete. Thus, costly and
time-consuming operations may be required to reverse the effects of conventional
fluid loss control additives on the treatment fluid and/or to restore permeability
to those portions of the subterranean formation affected by the fluid loss control
additives.
A treatment fluid has been described that consists of a base fluid and a plurality
of seeds [72]. The seeds suitable for use as an additive may be solid seeds that swell
upon hydration, such as basil seeds, cotton seeds, corn seeds, watermelon seeds,
sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, kapok seeds, flax seeds, cattoil seeds, cherry pits,
or palm kernels. In some cases, such as with basil seeds, the seeds may swell over
time in the presence of water, which may increase their efficacy as a fluid loss control
additive.
In the case of swellable seeds, the total time required for the swellable seeds to
swell may range from about 2 h to about 4 weeks. For example, when basil seeds were
placed into ample fresh water at room temperature, they swelled to about 13 times
their original volume in 2 h. In some cases, such seeds may swell more quickly in
the presence of fresh water than in the presence of a brine treatment fluid. Figure 2.3
shows the swelling of basil seeds in fresh water versus salt water at 57 ◦C.
The samples were prepared as follows [72]:
Preparation 2–1: Two grams of basil seeds were added to 200 ml of fresh water. The
salt water results are for 2 g of basil seeds that were added to 200 ml of fresh water and
0.43 g of sodium chloride. The swelling for fresh and salt water was measured over time
at 57 ◦C and, as shown in Figure 2.3, basil seeds in salt water initially swelled faster than
the freshwater seeds, but after about 10 h of swelling, the seeds in fresh water showed
more swelling.
In addition, dehydrated compounds may be used as a degradable solid particulate
[72]. A dehydrated compound is suitable if it will degrade over time as it is
rehydrated. For example, a particulate solid anhydrous borate material that degrades
over time may be suitable. Specific examples of particulate solid anhydrous borate
materials that may be used include anhydrous sodium tetraborate (also known as
anhydrous borax) and anhydrous boric acid. One example of a suitable blend of
materials is a mixture of poly(lactic acid) and sodium borate, where the mixing of
an acid and base could result in a neutral solution where this is desirable. Another
example would be a blend of poly(lactic acid) and boric oxide, a blend of calcium
carbonate and poly(lactic) acid, and a blend of magnesium oxide and poly(lactic)
acid.2.3 Organic additives 135

2.3.6 SWELLABLE POLYMERS
A fluid loss control enhancement additive has been described that consists of [73]:
1. a salt;
2. a swellable polymer; and
3. fibers.
The salt is present in the pill in the amount of approximately 0.5-2.5 ppb.
Examples of swellable polymers suitable for use in the lost circulation pills are
collected in Table 2.7.
The swellable polymer swells to at least about 10 times its original volume or
more, as it absorbs water [73].
2.3.7 HYDROCARBON RESINS
It has been discovered that hydrocarbon resins can be used as fluid loss additives
for oil-based drilling fluids. Hydrocarbon resin can be made by polymerizing at least
three components of the following [74]:
1. a dicyclopentadiene;
2. aliphatic cyclic dienes with five carbon atoms; or
3. monoolefins having more than five carbon atoms and no aromatic rings; or
4. debutanized aromatic concentrates; or
5. rosin acid-containing materials.
Some acyclic conjugated dienes are shown in Table 2.8.2.3 Organic additives 137

Monoolefins having more than five carbon atoms and having no aromatic rings
can also be polycyclic monoolefins. Examples of polycyclic monoolefins are shown
in Table 2.9.
The hydrocarbon resin can be modified by the reaction with one or more
ethylenically unsaturated lower aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. Examples of aliphatic
dicarboxylic acids are collected in Table 2.10.
The monoolefins, diolefins, and polyenes that have more than five carbon atoms
and no aromatic rings in their structure can be produced by a Diels-Alder reaction,
such as a Diels-Alder reaction between 1,3 conjugated diolefins and any olefin,
diolefin, or a polyene [74].
The polymerization of the materials can be performed as a thermal polymerization
and can be conducted in the absence of any catalyst. The polymerization temperature
can range from 230 ◦C to about 270 ◦C. The reaction times for the polymerization
can range from about 4 to 24 h.
Alternately, a catalyst or radical initiator can be used to polymerize the
components. Possible catalysts or radical initiators are peroxides, such as di￾tert-butylperoxide, dilauroylperoxide, dicumylperoxide, 2,5-bis-(tert-butylperoxy)
hexane, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis-(tert-butylperoxy)-hexene, dibenzoylperoxide, and
cumene hydroperoxide. Some of these compounds are shown in Figure 2.4.
In addition, Friedel-Crafts metal salt catalysts can be used, such as aluminum
chloride, stannic chloride, boron trifluoride, boron trifluoride ethyl ether, and boron
trifluoride phenol. If a catalyst or radical initiator is used, the reaction temperature
can be lower than without a catalyst [74].
Polymerization can be carried out according to the methods discussed and
described in the previous literature [75,76].138 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives

2.3.8 OLIGOMERIZED FATTY ACID
A fluid loss additive has been described that is the reaction product of a functional
polymer and an oligomerized fatty acid [77]. This fluid loss additive is used in a
nonaqueous wellbore servicing fluid. Functional polymers are listed in Table 2.11.
Unsaturated fatty acids can be obtained from tall oil, for example, tall oil fatty
acids such as abietic acids or pimaric acids. Alternatively, unsaturated fatty acids
may be used, such as linoleic acid, linelaidic acid, or linolenic acid.
Furthermore, unsaturated fatty acids may be obtained from vegetable oils such as
soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower seed oil, or rapeseed oil. Other vegetable oils that2.3 Organic additives 139

may provide unsaturated fatty acids, which can be used to form the dimer acids,
include canola oil, safflower oil, cuphea oil, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and olive
oil [77].
A fluid loss additive was prepared as follows [77]:
Preparation 2–2: Sixty grams of a 1-octadecene-co-maleic-anhydride polymer was
reacted with 40 g of UNIDYME 22 at a temperature of 190 ◦C for 3 h. SOLTROL 170
(100 g of isoparaffinic solvent) was utilized as a solvent such that heat transfer could be
maintained. UNIDYME 22 is a dimerized fatty acid commercially available from Arizona
Chemicals. The reaction product was used as a fluid loss additive.
2.3.9 HYDROPHOBIC CARBOXYMETHYL STARCH
A hydrophobic carboxymethyl starch could be synthesized. The major factors af￾fecting the esterification were then systematically investigated. The physicochemical
properties of hydrophobic carboxymethyl starch were determined through FTIR
spectroscopy, SEM, and viscosity analysis [78].
The results indicated that the suitable parameters for the preparation of hy￾drophobic carboxymethyl starch from carboxymethyl corn starch were as follows:
temperature 35 ◦C, reaction time 60 min, benzoyl chloride 2.5 (in mole proportion to
carboxymethyl corn starch), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 1.0 in mole proportion
to benzoyl chloride. Under these conditions, the degree of substitution was approxi￾mately 0.85 and the reaction efficiency was approximately 43%.
FTIR analysis revealed that benzoyl groups were grafted onto the carboxymethyl
corn starch chain units. The SEM images showed that hydrophobic carboxymethyl
starch granules exhibited slightly rough surfaces and their edges lost some definition;
their sides were porous. The hydrophobic carboxymethyl starch displayed a good
solubility and hydrophobicity. The selected hydrophobic carboxymethyl starch (with
a degree of substitution of 0.31) drilling fluids provided a remarkably effective
reservoir protection in the cores, and its permeability recovery value reached up to
90% [78].
2.3.10 EFFECT OF MOLECULAR FLEXIBILITY
The effect of the molecular flexibility on the rheological and filtration properties of
synthetic polymers that are used as fluid loss additives in water-based drilling fluid
was investigated [79].
Here, a synthetic polymer (PAANS) was synthesized from acrylamide (AM),
2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid (AMPS), N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NVP), and potassium 2,5-dihydroxybenzenesulfonate (DHBS). In the backbone
of this polymer, phenyl groups were introduced.
In addition, two other comparative polymers, PAAN and PAANS, were also
prepared following the same synthesis procedure. PAAN comprises acrylamide,2.3 Organic additives 141

2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid, and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, while

N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, and sodium 4-styrenesulfonate (SSS). Some of these com￾pounds are shown in Figure 2.5.
The polymers were prepared as follows [79]:
Preparation 2–3: The polymerization was carried out in a four-necked round bottom
flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, nitrogen gas inlet, and condenser. First, a buffer
solution of pH = 6.5 was obtained by diluting 1.36 g dipotassium hydrogen phosphate
with 0.1 mol l−1 sodium hydroxide solution of 30.4 ml with water to 200 ml. Then 100 mg
horseradish peroxidase was dissolved in 50 ml water and stored at 4 ◦C.
Second, AM, AMPS, NVP, and DHBS were added to 1,4-dioxane, and the mixture
was then transferred into the above flask.
Third, 200 ml buffer solution was added to the reaction flask after 30 min of deoxy￾genation with N2. After mixing, the horseradish peroxidase solution and acetylacetone
were added and then the mixture was heated to 50 ◦C. The reaction was stopped after
12 h. During the whole polymerization process, an H2O2 solution was injected gradually
into the flask through a plastic septum by using a syringe.
Finally, the product was cut into small pieces by hand, vacuum-dried at 75 ◦C for 24 h,
and stored in desiccators.
The molar ratio of AM, AMPS, NVP, and DHBS was 60:20:12:8. The total weight
percent of the four monomers in 1,4-dioxane was 10.0%. The weight of the horseradish
peroxidase solution compared with the monomers was 0.02%. The weights of the
acetylacetone and H2O2 solution compared with the monomers were 0.05% and 0.08%,
respectively. Poly(AM/AMPS/NVP/DHBS) was named PAAND. Poly(AM/AMPS/NVP)
and poly(AM/AMPS/NVP/SSS) were named PAAN and PAANS, respectively, which
were synthesized and dried under the same polymerization conditions, but the DHBS
monomer was not added in PAAN and the DHBS monomer was replaced with SSS in
PAANS.142 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives
The polymers were characterized by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. The molec￾ular weight was determined by static light scattering. The rheological properties,
filtration properties, and performance sustainability were investigated. Using a rhe￾ological properties measurement test, the apparent viscosity (AV), plastic viscosity
(PV), and yield point (YP) of the Na-MMT/PAAND system at a concentration of
2.0% were 18.0 mP s, 12.0 mP s, and 6.0 Pa, respectively, after a thermal aging test at
240 ◦C for 16 h [79].
These values are much higher than those of the corresponding Na-MMT/PAAN
and Na-MMT/PAANS systems. The API filtration loss volume (FLAPI) and high￾temperature/high-pressure filtrate volume (FLHTHP) of the Na-MMT/PAAND sys￾tem at a concentration of 2.0% were 12.0 and 30.0 ml, respectively, after a thermal
aging test at 240 ◦C for 16 h. These values are much lower than those of the Na￾MMT/PAAN and Na-MMT/PAANS systems [79].
Compared with PAAN and PAANS, PAAND presents the best performance sus￾tainability after multiple shearing and thermal aging tests. At the same temperature,
the order of maintaining rheological performance and controlling the FLAPI and
FLHTHP was PAAND > PAANS > PAAN in Na-MMT/PAANS-based drilling fluid
at high temperatures. Increasing the percentage of rigid monomers in the backbone
was found to be conducive to maintaining the rheological stability and improving the
filtration properties at high temperatures. The control mechanism of fluid loss was
investigated through adsorption tests using the method of thermal filtration, assessing
particle size distribution on a laser diffraction particle size analyzer, and examining
filter cake morphologies using an environmental scanning electron microscope.
The results of the study reveal that the introduction of rigid monomers into the
synthetic polymer backbone can effectively improve the adsorption capacity of the
polymer on the clay surface, obstruct the aggregation of clay particles, and improve
the quality of filter cakes at high temperatures [79].
2.3.11 MULTIWALLED CARBON NANOTUBES
The performance of nanosilica and multiwalled carbon nanotubes were evaluated
as fluid loss additives in water-based drilling fluid with various nanoparticles as a
function of concentration and temperature [80].
The results showed that plastic viscosity, yield point, and gel strength of drilling
fluid increased as the concentration of nanoparticles increased. A drilling fluid with
nanosilica gives the highest filtrate loss of 12 ml and mud cake thickness of 10 in.
(25.4 cm) at 1 g concentration at 150 ◦C [80].
However, a drilling fluid with multiwalled carbon nanotubes shows a decreasing
trend in fluid loss and mud cake thickness. The results also showed that a xanthan
gum containing 1 g of multiwalled carbon nanotubes gives 4.9 ml fluid loss and
mudcake thickness of 4 in. (10.2 cm) at 93 ◦C. After aging, plastic viscosity, yield
point, and gel strength of mud containing nanoparticles decrease significantly,
especially for 1 g of nanosilica and 0.01 g multiwalled carbon nanotubes [80].2.3 Organic additives 143
Fluid loss and mud cake thickness increased when the mud was exposed to
temperature above 121 ◦C. The results showed that xanthan gum with multiwalled
carbon nanotubes gives a better rheological performance [80].
2.3.12 CURAUÁ FIBERS
A method for using wellbore fluid to prevent lost circulation and also fluid loss has
been described [81]. The method uses a base fluid, adding a plurality of Curauá fibers
to the base fluid to create a wellbore fluid, and constructing a wellbore using the
wellbore fluid to prevent lost circulation.
The wellbore fluid may include a concentration up to 120 lb bbl−1 (340 kg m−3)
Curauá fibers. The fibers may have a density of about 1.4 g cm−3), and a tensile
strength of about 283-1150 MPa.
Curauá fibers can be extracted from the leaves of Curauá (Ananas erectifolius),
a plant originally from the Brazilian Amazon, in the western region of Para State,
North Brazil. Curauá is a monocotyledonous herbaceous species belonging to the
family Bromeliaceae. The advantages of this product are that it is low cost, nontoxic,
and biodegradable, and can be obtained from renewable sources. It has a low density,
low attrition on processing equipment, and exhibits good mechanical properties [81].
In addition, Curauá fibers have been used in other industries, such as the
automobile sector, due to their high mechanical resistance compared to lignocellulose
fibers [81].
2.3.13 SODIUM METASILICATE PENTAHYDRATE
Sodium metasilicate pentahydrate can act as a hardening-accelerator. It was widely
used in cement slurries to enhance its early strength [82].
Recently, it was found that sodium metasilicate pentahydrate has the ability to
adjust the compatibility between a 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid￾based fluid loss additive and retarder in an oil well cement. 2-Acrylamido-2-methyl
propane sulfonic acid is shown in Figure 2.6.

FIGURE 2.6
2-Acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid.144 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives
It was proposed that sodium metasilicate pentahydrate promotes the formation
and the growth of hydration products by accelerating the hydration velocity of cement
slurry, which increased the adsorption sites of cement hydration products. As that
happened, more 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid-based polymers were
adsorbed simultaneously on the surface of the hydration product, thereby effectively
improving the compatibility problem caused by the competitive adsorption between
the admixtures.
Meanwhile, while sodium metasilicate pentahydrate speeded up the hydration
reaction, the pores space of cement hydrated particles were filled with more hydrates
and consequently altered its pore size distribution, whose action was also beneficial to
the development of early strength. These findings will provide further interpretation
for the effect of the admixture on cement hydration products and offer some useful

The efficacy of traditional fluid loss additives, such as copolymers of N,N￾dimethylacrylamide and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, can be
significantly reduced with increasing salt concentration, especially magnesium
salts [83].
Salt is encountered in many oil-producing regions as, for example, salt domes in
the formation and salt water in the formation. To counteract the efficacy reduction of
a traditional fluid loss additive, the concentration of the fluid loss additive is usually
increased. However, such increased amounts of the fluid loss additive may adversely
affect cement slurry properties, since these additives can also act as retarders and
viscosifiers.
Salt-tolerant fluid loss additives have been described. These materials include
zwitterionic polymers that provide fluid loss for cement slurries at moderate concen￾trations, while in the presence of high salt concentrations. Additionally, salt-tolerant
fluid loss additives may be effective in the presence of magnesium salts. The ability
to use moderate concentrations of the salt-tolerant fluid loss additives may, in turn,
minimally effect the properties of the cement slurry and resultant set cement.
The zwitterionic polymers of salt-tolerant fluid loss additives may be charge￾balanced to a net zero charge. For example, in a copolymer of a monovalent cationic
monomer and monovalent anionic monomer, the monovalent cationic monomer and
the monovalent anionic monomer may be present in the copolymer in equimolar
amounts.
Examples of anionic monomers suitable for producing zwitterionic polymers are
collected in Table 2.12.
The synthesis of the zwitterionic polymers was done in water and other additives,
using 2,2
-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride as an initiator [83]. 2,2

2.3.15 ENCAPSULATED FLUID-LOSS ADDITIVES FOR CEMENT
COMPOSITIONS
Encapsulated fluid-loss additives for cement compositions have been described.
These encapsulated fluid-loss additives are composed from a fluid-loss additive
(e.g., a polymer) and an encapsulation material. The encapsulated fluid-loss additive146 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives

Compound
Hydroxyethyl cellulose
Carboxymethylhydroxyethyl cellulose
Copolymers of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid and acrylamide or N,N￾dimethylacrylamide
Graft copolymers with a backbone of lignin or lignite and pendant groups from 2-
acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, acrylonitrile, and N,N-dimethylacrylamide
may be included in the cement compositions to delay the viscosity increase induced
by the fluid-loss additive while mixing the cement compositions [84]. A wide variety
of fluid-loss additives may be encapsulated. These materials are shown in Table 2.13.
Suitable encapsulation materials may be relatively inert materials that do not
react or otherwise negatively interfere with the other components of the cement
compositions.
Examples of such materials are water-insoluble polymers, such as acrylic
acid crosslinked with polyalkenyl ethers, or divinyl glycol and waxes such as
poly(ethylene) wax, stearamide wax, or paraffin wax. A commercial example of
a suitable encapsulation material is the Carbopolo˝ family of polymers, a registered
trademark of Noveon, Inc. [84].
Encapsulation techniques include matrix encapsulation, spray-drying, pan coat￾ing, centrifugal extrusion, air-suspension coating, and vibrational nozzle encapsula￾tion [84].
2.4 POLY(SACCHARIDE)S
2.4.1 CELLULOSE-BASED FLUID LOSS ADDITIVES
Polyanionic cellulose
A composition containing PAC and a synthetic polymer of sulfonate has been tested
for reducing the fluid loss and for the thermal stabilization of a water-based drilling
fluid for extended periods at deep well drilling temperatures [52].
Sulfonate
When a sulfonate-containing polymer is added to a drilling fluid containing PAC, the
combination reduces the fluid loss. Improved fluid loss is obtained when PAC and the
sulfonate-containing polymer, which has a molecular weight of 300-10,000 kDa, are
combined in a water-based drilling mud (WBM) after prolonged aging at 150 ◦C.2.4 Poly(saccharide)s 147
Carboxymethyl cellulose
Certain admixtures of carboxymethylhydroxyethyl cellulose or copolymers and
copolymer salts of N,N-dimethylacrylamide and AMPS, together with a copolymer
of AA, may provide fluid loss control to cement compositions under elevated
temperature conditions [54].
Hydroxyethyl cellulose
HEC with a degree of substitution of 1.1-1.6 has been described for fluid loss control
in water-based drilling fluids [55]. An apparent viscosity in water of at least 15 c P
should be adjusted to achieve an API fluid loss of less than 50 ml/30 min. Crosslinked
HEC is suitable for high-permeability formations [85,86].
A derivatized HEC polymer gel exhibited excellent fluid loss control over a wide
range of conditions in most common completion fluids. This particular grated gel
was compatible with the formation material and caused little or no damage to original
permeability [87].
Detailed measurements of fluid loss, injection, and regained permeability were
taken to determine the polymer particulate’s effectiveness in controlling fluid loss
and to assess its ease of removal. HEC can be etherified or esterified with long chain
alcohols or esters. An ether bond is more stable in aqueous solution than is an ester
bond [88].
2.4.2 STARCH
Starch, c.f., Figure 2.8, has been traditionally used as raw material for polymeric
additives in order to control the fluid loss properties of a drilling mud.
The characteristics of the fluid loss of several newly developed starch types
have been assessed. Starch products with different contents of amylose were under
investigation. Details are shown in Table 2.14.
The products are manufactured by a gelatinization process during reactive
extrusion. The extrusion was carried out at 80 bar and 140 ◦C with a residence time

of 3 min. For the crosslinked high amylose type a chemical was introduced in the
course of the extrusion process.
The starches have negligible impurities. No solvent is needed during gelatiniza￾tion, and further, no waste water is produced as a byproduct. Thus, these types are
suitable for environmental sensitive areas.
The presence of most of the starches in a bentonite mud reduce the API filtration
of the bentonite mud at room temperature. However, the presence of the chemically
modified crosslinked high amylose did not show any improvement in the filtration
behavior of a bentonite mud.
The static fluid loss properties have been measured after a thermal treatment at
different temperatures. These indicate that the new starch products can be used as
fluid loss additives for drilling boreholes having a bottom hole temperature up to
150 ◦C [89].
The results indicate that some of the starches have static and dynamic fluid loss
characteristics similar to or better than those of a widely used modified starch.
Crosslinked starch
A crosslinked starch was described as a fluid loss additive for drilling fluids [56,90].
The additive resists degradation and functions satisfactorily after exposure to temper￾atures of 120 ◦C for periods of up to 32 h. To obtain crosslinked starch, a crosslinking
agent is reacted with granular starch in an aqueous slurry. The crosslinking reaction is
controlled by a Brabender viscometer test. Typical crosslinked starches are obtained
when the initial rise of the viscosity of the product is between 104 ◦C and 144 ◦C, and
the viscosity of the product does not rise above 200 Brabender units at temperatures
less than 130 ◦C.
The crosslinked starch slurry is then drum-dried and milled to obtain a dry
product. The effectiveness of the product is checked by the API Fluid Loss Test
or other standards after static aging of sample drilling fluids containing the starch at
elevated temperatures. The milled dry product can then be incorporated into the oil
well drilling fluid of the drill site [91,92].2.4 Poly(saccharide)s 149
Pregelatinized starch
The properties of the filter cake formed by macroscopic particles can be significantly
influenced by certain organic additives. The overall mechanism of water-soluble fluid
loss additives has been studied by determining the electrophoretic mobility of filter
cake fines. Water-soluble fluid loss additives are divided into four types according to
their different effects on the negative electrical charge density of filter cake fines [93]:
1. electrical charge density is reduced, by poly(ethylene),
2. glycol and pregelatinized starch,
3. electrical charge density is not changed by carboxymethyl starch, and
4. electrical charge density is increased by a sulfonated phenolic resin,
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and hydrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile).
The properties of filtrate reducers are governed by their different molecular
structures. Non-ionic filtrate reducers work by completely blocking the filter cake
pore, and anionic ones work by increasing the negative charge density of filter cakes
and decreasing pore size. Anionic species cause further clay dispersion, but non-ionic
species do not, and both of them are beneficial to colloid stability [94].
The change of properties of the filter cake due to salinity and polymeric additives
has been studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) photography [95]. Fresh
water muds with and without polymers such as starch, PAC, and a synthetic high￾temperature stable polymer, were prepared, contaminated with electrolytes (NaCl,
CaCl2, MgCl2), and aged at 90-189 ◦C.
Static API filtrates before and after contamination and aging were measured. The
freeze-dried API filter cakes were used for SEM studies. The filter cake structure was
influenced by electrolytes, temperature, and polymers.
In an unaged, uncontaminated mud, bentonite forms a card-house structure
with low porosity. Electrolyte addition increases the average filter cake pore size.
Temperature causes coagulation and dehydration of clay platelets. Polymers protect
bentonite from such negative effects.
Granular starch and mica
A fluid loss additive has been described that consists of granular starch composition
and fine particulate mica [57]. An application comprises a fracturing fluid containing
this additive. A method of fracturing a subterranean formation penetrated by a
borehole comprises injecting into the borehole and into contact with the formation,
at a rate and pressure sufficient to fracture the formation, a fracturing fluid containing
the additive in an amount sufficient to provide fluid loss control.
Depolymerized starch
Partially depolymerized starch provides decreased fluid losses at much lower vis￾cosities than the corresponding starch derivatives that have not been partially
depolymerized [96].150 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives
Controlled degradable fluid loss additives
A fluid loss additive for a fracturing fluid comprises a mixture of natural and modified
starches plus an enzyme [58]. The enzyme degrades the α-linkage of starch but does
not degrade the β-linkage of guar and modified guar gums when used as a thickener.
Natural or modified starches are utilized in a preferred ratio of 3:7 to 7:3, with
optimum at 1:1, and the mix is used in the dry form for application from the
surface down the well. The preferred modified starches are the carboxymethyl and
hydroxypropyl derivatives. Natural starches may be those of corn, potatoes, wheat,
and soy, and the most preferred is corn starch.
Blends include two or more modified starches, as well as blends of natural
and modified starches. Optionally, the starches are coated with a surfactant, such
as sorbitan monooleate, ethoxylated butanol, or ethoxylated nonyl phenol, to aid
dispersion into the fracturing fluid.
A fluid loss additive is described [97] that helps achieve a desired fracture
geometry by lowering the spurt loss and leak-off rate of the fracturing fluid into the
surrounding formation by rapidly forming a filter cake with low permeability. The
fluid loss additive is readily degraded after the completion of the fracturing process.
The additive has a broad particulate size distribution that is ideal for use in effectively
treating a wide range of formation porosities and is easily dispersed in the fracturing
fluid.
The fluid loss additive comprises a blend of modified starches or blends of one
or more modified starches and one or more natural starches. These blends have
been found to maintain injected fluid within the created fracture more effectively
than natural starches. The additive is subject to controlled degradation to soluble
products by a naturally proceeding oxidation reaction or by bacterial attack by
bacteria naturally present in the formation. The oxidation may be accelerated by
adding oxidizing agents such as persulfates and peroxides.
Multimodal distributed polymers
A polymeric material with a multimodal distribution refers to a polymeric material
that comprises at least two pluralities of polymer molecules having different average
molecular weights.
Actually, polymeric materials found in nature are generally monomodal with a
rather narrow polydispersity P [98]. The polydispersity is in general defined as the
ratio of two different averages of molecular weight, that is, the ratio of weight average
Mw to the number average, Mn. These averages are defined as
Mn = M=∞
M=1 xMM,
Mw = M=∞
M=1 wMM,
(2.3)
where xM is the mole fraction of polymer with a molecular weight of M and wM is
the weight fraction of polymer with a molecular weight of M.2.4 Poly(saccharide)s 151
Thus the polydispersity is
P = Mw
Mn
≥ 1. (2.4)
Polydisperse materials can be obtained by mixing chemically equal materials
with different molecular weights. The latter can be obtained by synthesis of artificial
materials under different conditions, or by controlled degradation of naturally
occurring polymers.
Polymeric materials with small polydispersities, may not be able to fill the pore
spaces sufficiently to prevent fluid loss into the formation. For example, if the
polymer molecules are all relatively large, all of them may be unable to fit within
certain pore throats in the formation to plug the pore spaces therein.
On the other hand, polymers with a multimodal distribution contain a number of
molecules that fit to fill and plug small pores, a number of molecules that fit to fill and
plug medium-sized pores, etc. The principle developed above is suitable for polymers
as fluid loss additives in general, that is, independent on the particular chemical nature
of the polymers.
A wide variety of examples of polymers have been listed, operating according to
this principle. Examples of natural polymers include, poly(saccharide)s. Examples
of suitable synthetic polymers include 2,2
-azobis(2,4-dimethyl valeronitril) [98,
p. 5-15].
2.4.3 BORATE CROSSLINKERS
Organic polyhydroxy compounds with hydroxyl moieties positioned in the cis-form
on adjacent carbon atoms or on carbon atoms in a 1,3-relationship can react with
borates to form five or six member ring complexes. The reaction is fully reversible
with changes in pH.
Depending on concentration of the polymer and the borate anion, the crosslinking
reaction may produce useful gels. Aqueous borate concentrates that provide a
controllable crosslink time are highly appreciated. Sparingly soluble borate suspen￾sions are suitable for hydraulic fracturing operations, since they adjust the time of
crosslinking more consistently [99].
Examples of borate minerals are shown in Table 2.15.
2.4.4 GUAR
A hydrophobically modified guar gum can be used as an additive for drilling,
completion, or servicing fluids [59,101]. The modified gum is used together with
polymers or reactive clay.
Hydroxypropyl guar gum
Hydroxypropyl guar gum gel can be crosslinked with borates [102], titanates, or
zirconates. Borate crosslinked fluids and linear HEC gels are the most commonly152 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives

used fluids for high-permeability fracture treatments. This is for use for hydraulic

2.4.5 SUCCINOGLYCAN
Succinoglycan is a biopolymer. It has been shown to possess a combination of
desirable properties for fluid loss control [60,61]. These include ease of mixing,
cleanliness, shear thinning rheology, temperature-insensitive viscosity below its
transition temperature (Tm), and an adjustable transition temperature (Tm) over a
wide range of temperatures. Succinoglycan fluids rely solely on viscosity to reduce
fluid loss. It does not form a hard-to-remove filter cake, which can cause considerable
formation damage.
Based on these findings, succinoglycan has been used successfully as a fluid loss
pill before and after gravel packing in more than 100 offshore wells. Calculations
based on laboratory-measured rheology and field experience have shown succino￾glycan to be effective in situations in which HEC is not. Fluid loss, even over
40 barrels/h, was reduced to several barrels per hour after application of a properly2.4 Poly(saccharide)s 153
designed succinoglycan pill. Most wells experienced no problem in production after
completion.
Succinoglycan can be degraded with an internal acid breaker [103]. The formation
damage that results from the incomplete back-production of viscous fluid loss control
pills can be minimized if a slow-acting internal breaker is employed. In particular,
core-flow tests have indicated that combining a succinoglycan-based pill with a
hydrochloric acid internal breaker enables a fluid loss system with sustained control
followed by delayed break back and creates only low levels of impairment. To
describe the delayed breaking of the succinoglycan/hydrochloric acid system, a
model, based on bond breaking rate, has been used.
With this model, it is possible to predict the change of the rheologic properties
of the polymer as a function of time for various formation temperatures, transition
temperatures of the succinoglycan, and acid concentrations. The model can be used
to identify optimal formulations of succinoglycan and acid breaker on the basis of
field requirements, such as the time interval over which fluid loss control is needed,
the overbalance pressure a pill should be able to withstand, and the brine density
required.
2.4.6 POLY(ETHER)-MODIFIED POLY(SACCHARIDE)S
Some cellulosic compounds are shown in Figure 2.9.
Compositions containing mixtures of metal hydroxides a polysaccharide, par￾tially etherified with hydroxyethyl and hydroxypropyl groups, are used as fluid loss
additives for aqueous, clay-mineral-based drilling muds [62].
2.4.7 SCLEROGLUCAN
A combination of graded calcium carbonate particle sizes, a non-ionic polysaccharide
of the scleroglucan type, and a modified starch, has been claimed for use in fluid loss
formulations [63]. It is important that the calcium carbonate particles are distributed

across a wide size range to prevent filtration or fluid loss into the formation. Because
the filter cake particles do not invade the wellbore due to the action of the biopolymer
and the starch, no high-pressure spike occurs during the removal of the filter cake.
The rheologic properties of the fluid allow it to be used in a number of
applications in which protection of the original permeable formation is desirable.
The applications include drilling, fracturing, and controlling fluid losses during
completion operations, such as gravel packing or well workovers.
2.4.8 GELLAN
It has been found that gellan has good characteristics as a filtrate reducer in water￾based drilling fluids [64,104]. Preferential use is made of native gellan, which has
a considerable gelling capacity and good solubility. It should be noted that native
gellan contains cellular debris or other insoluble residue. Xanthan gum has been
used extensively in the oil industry as a viscosifier for various applications [105].
Deacetylated xanthan gum is used in guar-free compositions instead of guar [106].
2.5 HUMIC ACID DERIVATES
Polysulfonated humic acid is a drilling fluid filtrate loss additive composed of
three mud additives: sulfonated chromium humate, sulfonated phenolic resin, and
hydrolytic ammonium poly(acrylate) [16].
The field application and the effectiveness of polysulfonated humic acid resin,
especially in extra-deep wells, in sylvite and undersaturated salt muds, have been
described. Polysulfonated humic acid resists high temperature, salt concentration,
and calcium contamination, as well. This type of drilling fluid has stable properties
and good rheologic characteristics and can improve cementing quality.
Oil-based well working fluids
Adducts of amino ethylethanolamine and poly(ethylene amine)s with humic acid
and fatty acids [107] are useful as fluid loss additives in oil-based drilling muds
(OBMs) [15].
In addition, a fluid loss additive for OBMs, which consists of fatty acid com￾pounds and lignite or humic acid, an oil soluble or oil-dispersible amine with
phosphoric acid, or an aliphatic amide or hydroxyamide [14], has been described.
An oil-based drilling fluid additive (i.e., humic acid-cocamide diethanolamine)
was synthesized using humic acid and cocamide diethanolamine as raw materials
[108]. These compounds are shown in Figure 2.10.
The rheological behaviors of showed that the synthesized product has good
properties in both decreasing the filtrate loss and improving the rheology property
of oil-based drilling fluids compared with other commercially available additives.
Under the optimal additive amount of 3%, both API filtrate loss and yield point
changed remarkably from 5.40 to 0.41 ml and 9.0 to 25.6 Pa, respectively [108].2.5 Humic acid derivates 155

Furthermore, differential scanning calorimetry showed that the additive has
a good thermal stability in a wide temperature range up to 170 ◦C. Infrared
spectroscopy and rheological analysis revealed that the possible mechanism of the
multifunctional effects may be attributed to the existing of high density of strong
polar groups, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic forces, and intermolecular association on
the molecular structure.
Therefore, the synthesized product can be potentially used as a multifunctional
oil-based drilling fluid additive in oil-drilling excavation [108].
2.5.1 LIGNOSULFONATES
Grafted lignin or lignite
In hydraulic cement slurries, fluid loss additives based on sulfonated or sulfomethy￾lated lignins have been described.
Sulfonated or sulfomethylated lignins are reacted with phenol-blocking reagents,
such as EO, PO, or 1,2-butylene oxide [109]. The fluid loss and thickening time
characteristics of the cement slurry is altered, either by increasing the molecular
weight of the lignin by crosslinking with formaldehyde or epichlorohydrin or by
adding agents such as sodium sulfite, sodium metasilicate, sodium phosphate, and
sodium naphthalene sulfonate.156 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives
Another method is amination with a poly(amine) and an aldehyde [110]. The
formulation also contains sodium carbonate, sodium phosphate, sodium sulfite,
sodium metasilicate, or naphthalene sulfonate. The sulfonated or sulfomethylated
aminated lignin shows less retardation (shorter thickening time) than a sulfonated or
sulfomethylated lignin without the attached amine.
Lignite can be grafted with synthetic comonomers to obtain lignite fluid
loss additives [51]. Comonomers can be AMPS, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, AAm,
vinylpyrrolidone, vinylacetate, acrylonitrile, dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate,
styrene sulfonate, vinylsulfonate, dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate methyl chloride
quaternary, and AA and its salts.
Various polymers, for example, lignin, lignite, derivatized cellulose poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(propylene oxide), and poly
(ethyleneimine), can be used as a backbone polymer onto which some other groups
can be grafted [111]. The grafted pendant groups can be AMPS, acrylonitrile,
N,N-dimethylacrylamide, AA, N,N-dialkylamino ethylmethacrylate, and their salts.
One commercial example of such compounds is HALAD 413, which is appreciated
and an object of research [112,113].
A polymeric composition for reducing fluid loss in drilling muds and well cement
compositions is obtained by the free radical polymerization of a water-soluble vinyl
monomer in an aqueous suspension of lignin, modified lignins, lignite, and brown
coal [47,48].
The vinyl monomers can be methacrylic acid, methacrylamide, hydroxyethyl
acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, vinylacetate, methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether,
N-methylmethacrylamide, N,N-dimethylmethacrylamide, vinylsulfonate, and addi￾tional AMPS. In this process, a grafting process to the coals by chain transfer may
occur. Vinyl ethers are shown in Figure 2.11. Some acrylics are shown in Figure 2.12.
Graft copolymers and other polymers are prepared in a way that is common in
polymerization techniques [114]. For example, they are made by providing a foamed,
aqueous solution of water-soluble monomeric material, initiating polymerization by
adding an initiator, exothermically polymerizing the monomeric material to form a
foamed gel, and comminuting the gel.
Preferably, the polymerization temperature is held below 60 ◦C for at least the first
10 min of the polymerization and then rises exothermically to a higher temperature.
Graft copolymers that can be made by this technique and that are of particular value
as fluid loss additives are formed from a polyhydroxy polymer, a sulfonate monomer,
further AAm and AA.

Vinyl grafted wattle tannin comprises a wattle tannin grafted with AMPS and
small amounts of AAm [49]. The wattle tannin is present in an amount of 2-14%.
The AMPS is present in an amount of 98-84% accordingly.
Greek lignites
Lignites originated from Greece have been tested to control the filtration charac￾teristics of water-bentonite suspensions [115,116]. The properties of a series of
lignite samples from various peat/lignite deposits in Greece were compared with a
commercial lignite product.
The samples were characterized with respect to their contents of humic and fulvic
acids, humins, oxygen, ash, and their cation exchange capacity.
Most samples show a good filtration control when used in water-bentonite
suspensions even after exposure to 177 ◦C. Some of them were found to be superior
to the commercial product. The fluid loss is fairly dependent on the content of humic158 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives

percentage showed a weak inverse correlation with the fluid loss volumes.

state have been measured. To the aged suspensions, 3% lignite of varying origin have
been added. The rheograms are given in Figure 2.14.
The addition of lignite reduces the shear stress. In the high shear rate range, the
rheograms exhibit a linear behavior [116]. The reduction in the shear stress is very
similar for all the lignite types tested.2.6 Synthetic polymers 159

2.6 SYNTHETIC POLYMERS
2.6.1 POLY(ORTHOESTER)S
Aliphatic poly(ester)s degrade chemically by hydrolytic cleavage. The process
of hydrolysis can be catalyzed by both acids and bases. During the hydrolysis,
carboxylic end groups are formed during chain scission, and this may enhance the
rate of further hydrolysis. This mechanism is known in the art as autocatalysis and is
thought to make poly(ester) matrices more bulk-eroding.
Among the esters, poly(orthoester)s and aliphatic poly(ester)s, that is,
poly(lactide)s are preferred. Poly(lactide)s can be synthesized either from lactic
acid by a condensation reaction or more commonly by ring opening polymerization
of a cyclic lactide monomer.
The degradation by hydrolysis should be rather slowly over time. In fracturing
operations, the material should not begin to degrade until after the proppant has been
placed in the fracture. Moreover, the slow degradation helps to provide fluid loss
control during the placement of the proppant [117]. An example of a fracturing fluid
composition is given in Table 2.16.

acid moieties has been suggested as a fluid loss additive [118]. Production methods
of the polymer have been described.
The reaction products are ground to 0.1-1500 μm particle size. The condensation
product can be used as a fluid loss material in a hydraulic fracturing process in which
the fracturing fluid comprises a hydrolyzable, aqueous gel.
The hydroxyacetic acid condensation product hydrolyzes at formation conditions
to provide hydroxyacetic acid, which breaks the aqueous gel autocatalytically and
eventually provides the restored formation permeability without the need of the
separate addition of a gel breaker [119–122].
2.6.3 HYDROGELS
A filtrate reducer is an additive for filtration control that can form a filter cake at the
wellbore wall to reduce fluid loss and to protect the underground environment.
Commonly used filtrate reducers are starch derivatives, cellulose, lignite resin,
polyacrylic acid, and artificially synthesized multicopolymers [123,124]. However,
owing to the harsh underground environment, such as high temperature, salinity, pres￾sure, and the sophisticated structure formed in deep wells, some of these conventional
macro-type polymers are difficult to fulfill desired functional requirements such as
maintaining the colloidal stability due to low chemical and physical stability [125].
Thus, it is of great importance to develop a novel multifunctional filtrate reducer
at nanoscale size with high physical, chemical, and thermal stability, and high salt￾tolerance [124].
Ionic-covalent cross-linked poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid)
N,N-dimethylacrylamide cellulose nanofibril (PADC-Fe3+) hydrogels were synthe￾sized by immersing cellulose nanofibrils reinforced with covalent poly(2-acrylamido-2.6 Synthetic polymers 161
2-methylpropane sulfonic acid) N,N-dimethylacrylamide composite hydrogels into a
ferric chloride aqueous solution [124].
To produce this polymer with different cellulose nanofibril contents, cellulose
nanofibril loadings of 5-20% were explored. UV-spectroscopy analysis demonstrated
the occurrence of cellulose nanofibril coalescence, and it was suggested that a 10%
cellulose nanofibril loading resulted in the production of PADC-0.1-Fe3+ with the
highest absorbance. Compared to copolymers (PAD or PADC-0.1) prepared without
cellulose nanofibril or Fe3+, the synthesized PADC-0.1-Fe3+ showed a much better
tolerance to salt, high temperatures, and shear. After adding the synthesized PADC￾0.1-Fe3+ as a filtrate reducer into the drilling fluids prepared with fresh water and
4% sodium chloride, the filtrate loss was significantly reduced even at an elevated
temperature of 200 ◦C. In addition, the addition of PADC-0.1-Fe3+ increased the
portion of fine cement particles in the drilling fluid [124].
2.6.4 POLYDRILL
Polydrill is a sulfonated polymer for filtration control in water-based drilling fluids
[126]. Tests demonstrated the product’s thermal stability up to 200 ◦C and its
outstanding electrolyte tolerance. Polydrill can be used in NaCl-saturated drilling
fluids as well as in muds containing 75,000 ppm of calcium or 100,000 ppm of
magnesium. A combination of starch with Polydrill was used successfully in drilling
several wells. The deepest hole was drilled with 11-22 kg m−3 of pregelatinized
starch and 2.5-5.5 kg m−3 of Polydrill to a depth of 4800 m. Field experience with
the calcium tolerant starch/Polydrill system useful up to 145 ◦C has been discussed
in detail [127].
In dispersed muds (e.g., lignite or lignosulfonate), minor Polydrill additions result
in a significantly improved high-temperature, high-pressure filtrate. Major benefits
come from a synergism of polymer with starch and poly(saccharide)s. The polymer
exerts a thermal stabilizing effect on those polymers.
In conventional or clay-free drilling and completion fluids, Polydrill can be used
by itself or in combination with other filtrate reducers for various purposes [128].
Handling and discharge of the product as well as the waste mud created no problem
in the field.
Polymer of monoallylamine
A water-soluble polymer of monoallylamine, c.f., Figure 2.15, can be used in
conjunction with a sulfonated polymer, such as a water-soluble lignosulfonate,
Allylamine
H2C CH CH2 NH2
FIGURE 2.15
Monoallylamine.162 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives
condensed naphthalene sulfonate, or sulfonated vinyl aromatic polymer, to minimize
fluid loss from the slurry during well cementing operations [17,18]. The polymer of
monoallylamine may be a homopolymer or a copolymer and may be crosslinked or
uncrosslinked.
These components react with each other in the presence of water to produce a
gelatinous material that tends to plug porous zones and to minimize premature water
loss from the cement slurry to the formation.
Polyphenolics
Organophilic polyphenolic materials for OBMs have been described [19]. The
additives are prepared from a polyphenolic material and one or more phosphatides.
The phosphatides are phosphoglycerides obtained from vegetable oils, preferably
commercial lecithin.
Humic acids, lignosulfonic acid, lignins, phenolic condensates, tannins; the
oxidized, sulfonated, or sulfomethylated derivatives of these polyphenolic materials
may serve as polyphenolic materials.
A fluid loss additive is described that uses graded calcium carbonate particle sizes
and a modified lignosulfonate [129]. Optionally, a thixotropic polymer, such as a
wellan or xanthan gum polymer, is used to keep the CaCO3 and lignosulfonate in
suspension.
It is important that the calcium carbonate particles are distributed across a
wide size range to prevent filtration or fluid loss into the formation. Furthermore,
the lignosulfonate must be polymerized to an extent effective to reduce its water
solubility. The modified lignosulfonate is necessary for the formation of a filter cake
essentially on the surface of the wellbore.
Because the filter cake particles do not invade the wellbore due to the action of
the modified lignosulfonate, no high-pressure spike occurs during the removal of the
filter cake, which would indicate damage of the formation and wellbore surface. The
additive is useful in fracturing fluids, completion fluids, and workover fluids.
Tests showed that a fluid loss additive on the base of a sulfonated tannic-phenolic
resin is effective for fluid loss control at high temperature and pressure, and it exhibits
good resistance to salt and acid [20].
2.6.5 LATEX
A polymer latex added to a water-based drilling fluid can reduce the rate of the
drilling fluid invades through the borehole wall during drilling. The polymer latex
is capable of providing a deformable latex film or seal on the borehole wall.
Of course, the seal is completely impermeable. However, the seal is considered
to be semi-permeable, but nevertheless at least partially blocking the transmission of
the fluid, which is sufficient to result in a great improvement in osmotic efficiency
[130,131]. Latexes may include the following components [132]:
• vulcanizable groups, for example, butadiene,
• vulcanizing agents such as sulfur, 2,2
-dithiobisbenzothiazole, organic peroxides,
azo compounds, alkylthiuram disulfides, and selenium phenolic derivatives,2.6 Synthetic polymers 163
• vulcanization accelerators, such as fatty acids such as stearic acid, metallic
oxides such as zinc oxide, aldehyde amine compounds, guanidine derivates, and
disulfide thiuram compounds,
• vulcanization retarders such as salicylic acid, sodium acetate, phthalic
anhydride, and N-cyclohexyl thiophthalimide,
• defoamers, and
• fillers to increase or decrease the treatment density as required.
Latex emulsions are also used in cement compositions to reduce the fluid loss
[132]. Latex emulsions can be also added to reduce the brittleness of the sealant
compositions and thus improve the flexibility.
Further, latex emulsions prevent the gas migration. This property is useful when
the sealant starts curing, that is, the sealant composition changes from a low viscous
fluid to a highly viscous mass. During this transition phase, the sealant mass can no
longer transmit the hydrostatic pressure.
When the pressure exerted on the formation by the sealant composition falls
below the pressure of the gas in the formation, the gas initially migrates into and
through the composition. The gas migration causes flow channels to form in the
sealant composition, and those flow channels permit further migration of the gas
after the sealant composition sets [132].
In addition, polymer latexes can be incorporated into OBMs. In these fluids,
the polymer latex seals can be formed without the need of a precipitating agent, a
surfactant or any salt in the water phase [130].
The latex, where in general water is the continuous phase, is in turn suspended in a
hydrocarbon base fluid having at least some emulsifier to suspend the polymer latex.
In the best case, the polymer latex can be simply mixed with the hydrocarbon base
fluid without the need for adding any more emulsifier that is usually present in such
fluids. Some latex products exhibit a synergistic effect with aluminum complexes,
with regard to their sealing properties.
The polymer latex is a carboxylated styrene/butadiene copolymer or a sul￾fonated styrene/butadiene copolymer. There are commercially available carboxylated
styrene/butadiene copolymers, for example, Gencalo˝ 7463 [131].
Sulfonated latexes have the advantage as that they can be often used in the absence
of a surfactant. This may simplify the formulation and transportation of the drilling
fluid additives to the production sites. A precipitating agent, such sodium aluminate
is preferably used together with the latex [131].
In the course of testing, photomicrographs showed an accumulation of latex
along microfractures in the shale. Since the volume and the velocity of filtration
flow into these cracks is very small, filtration alone cannot account for the latex
accumulation at the crack throat. It seems that precipitation effects are responsible
for these findings.
When sufficient latex is deposited to bridge the crack opening, the fracture
is sealed and differential pressure is established across the latex. The differential
pressure consolidates the latex deposit into a solid seal.164 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives
Optionally, a surfactant that behaves as an emulsifier and a wetting agent and a
weighting agent, for example, calcium carbonate, barite, or hematite, are included.
Suitable emulsifiers and wetting agents include surfactants; ionic surfactants such as
fatty acids, amines, amides, and organic sulfonates; and mixtures of any of these with
non-ionic surfactants such as ethoxylated surfactants. The water-in-oil emulsion may
consist of an oil phase, a water phase (salt or fresh), a surfactant, a weighting agent,
and salts or electrolytes [133–135].
Stable drilling fluid systems have been formulated with latex that remain dis￾persed and flexible in highly saline fluids. The mechanism of stabilization is caused
by two issues [130]:
1. The ultra-fine, deformable latex particles with a diameter of 0.2 μm
mechanically seal shale microfractures and physically prevent further intrusion
of drilling fluids into sensitive shale zones.
2. The coprecipitation of the latex with precipitating agents, such as aluminum
complexes, produces a semi-permeable membrane on shale surfaces that
chemically improves the osmotic efficiency between the fluid and the borehole.
Colloidally stabilized latex
Latex emulsions that are prepared by conventional emulsion polymerization become
unstable in the presence of salt. In order to improve the salt tolerance of latex
emulsions in sealant compositions, surfactants, such as ethoxylated nonyl phenol
sulfates are added.
A cheaper solution are sealant compositions with a colloidally stabilized latex.
Colloidally stabilized latex contains a protective colloid. Examples of suitable
protective colloids include, partially and fully hydrolyzed PVA, cellulose ethers,
starch derivatives, natural and synthetic gums, and synthetic copolymers [132].
However, the backbone of the latex may be modified, as moieties with surfactants
properties are incorporated. Since the surfactant is then chemically bound to the
polymer, it cannot be removed easily from the polymer. An example for such a latex
is a carboxylated butadiene acrylonitrile latex. The carboxyl groups allow bearing
electrical charges on the polymeric backbone.
Another method is to introduce a functionalized silane into the polymer. This
moiety is capable of adsorbing the protective colloid. A suitable functionalized silane
is γ-mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane.
It has been demonstrated that a carboxyl modified latex can produce slurries with
satisfactory properties without needing stabilizing surfactants [132].
2.6.6 POLY(VINYL ALCOHOL)
Partially hydrolyzed poly(vinylacetate) (PVAc), a crosslinker for the polymer, and
other additives such as calcium sulfate can be used in cementing casing strings [24].
PVAc is not totally water soluble below 50 ◦C, but is, instead, water swellable. It is
believed that the individual PVAc particles swell and soften to form small gel-balls
in the slurry.2.6 Synthetic polymers 165
These gel-balls deform by flattening and become a part of the filter cake, greatly
reducing the filter cake permeability, thus giving good fluid loss control. Because
PVAc is not totally water soluble, it does not significantly increase the viscosity of
the slurry. Furthermore, PVAc does not delay the setting of the cement, and it has
high-temperature properties that are relatively insensitive to external conditions.
PVAc can be crosslinked with a crosslinker present in a molar concentration,
relative to monomer residues, of 0.01-1.0%. The crosslinker may be formalde￾hyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, maleic acid, oxalic acid, dimethylurea,
poly(acrolein), diisocyanate, divinylsulfonate, or a chloride of a diacid [22,23,136].
2.6.7 POLY(ETHYLENEIMINE)
A liquid fluid loss-reducing additive for well cementing compositions consists of
water, poly(ethyleneimine), an alkali metal salt of alkyl benzene sulfonic acid, and
an alkali metal salt of naphthalene sulfonic acid, condensed with formaldehyde [26].
The poly(ethyleneimine) has a molecular weight of 40-60 kDa and is present in an
amount of 50-55% by weight of the additive. The alkali metal salt of the alkyl
benzene sulfonic acid is sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and is present in an
amount of 3-4% of the additive. The alkali metal salt of the naphthalene sulfonic
acid that is condensed with formaldehyde is sodium naphthalene sulfonate.
The sodium naphthalene sulfonate-formaldehyde condensation product has a
molecular weight of 1.4-2.4 kDa, and the condensation product is present in an
amount of 3-4% of the additive. The alkyl group of the alkyl benzene sulfonic acid
salt contains from 8 to 16 carbon atoms.
2.6.8 ACRYLICS
Permeability control
The water permeability of a formation can be controlled by the addition of a water￾soluble copolymer which is formed from a hydrophobic or hydrophobically modified
hydrophilic monomer and a hydrophilic monomer [137]. Suitable monomers are
collected in Table 2.17.
The polymerization proceeds in aqueous solution, or emulsion respectively be a
radical polymerization. 2,2
-Azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride is added as
radical initiator [137]. This azo type initiator is water soluble. In order to quaternize
the polymers, if desired, for example, benzylcetyldimethyl ammonium bromide can
be added.
Copolymers
Homopolymers and copolymers from amido sulfonic acid or salt containing
monomers can be prepared by reactive extrusion, preferably in a twin screw
extruder [138]. The process produces a solid polymer. Copolymers of AAm,
N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, and NaAMPS have been proposed to be active as fluid loss
agents. Another component of the formulations is the sodium salt of naphthalene166 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives

formaldehyde sulfonate [28]. The fluid loss additive is mixed with hydraulic cements
in suitable amounts.
A fluid loss additive for hard brine environments has been developed [27], which
consists of hydrocarbon, an anionic surfactant, an alcohol, a sulfonated asphalt,
a biopolymer, and optionally an organophilic clay, a copolymer of N-vinyl-2-
pyrrolidone and NaAMPS. Methylene bisacrylamide can be used as a crosslinker
[139]. Crosslinking imparts thermal stability and resistance to alkaline hydrolysis.
Terpolymers and tetrapolymers have been proposed as fluid loss additives for
drilling fluids [39,40]. The constituent monomers are a combination of non-ionic
monomers and ionic monomers.
The non-ionic monomer can be AAm, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N-vinyl￾2-pyrrolidone, N-vinylacetamide, or dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate. Ionic
monomers are AMPS, sodium vinylsulfonate, and vinylbenzene sulfonate. The
terpolymer should have a molecular weight between 0.2 and 1 MDa.
A formulation consisting of AMPS, AAm, and itaconic acid has been proposed
[41]. Such polymers are used as fluid loss control additives for aqueous drilling fluids
and are advantageous when used with lime muds or gypsum-based drilling muds
containing soluble calcium ions.2.6 Synthetic polymers 167
For sea water muds, another example [43] is a copolymer of 10% AMPS and
90% AA in its sodium salt form. The polymers have an average molecular weight of
50-1000 kDa.
A terpolymer from a family of intramolecular polymeric complexes (i.e., polyam￾pholytes), which are terpolymers of AAm-methyl styrene sulfonate-methacrylamido
propyltrimethyl ammonium chloride has been reported [29,140].
A terpolymer formed from ionic monomers AMPS, sodium vinylsulfonate or
vinylbenzene sulfonate itaconic acid, and a non-ionic monomer, for example, AAm,
N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinylacetamide, and dimethyl
amino ethyl methacrylate, is used as a fluid loss agent in oil well cements [44].
The terpolymer should have a molecular weight of 0.2-1 MDa. The terpolymer
comprises AMPS, AAm, and itaconic acid. Such copolymers also serve in drilling
fluids [141].
A tetrapolymer consisting of 40-80 mol% of AMPS, 10-30 mol% of vinylpyrroli￾done, 0-30 mol% of AAm, and 0-15 mol% of acrylonitrile was also a suggested as
a fluid loss additive [30]. Even at high salt concentrations, these polymers yield
high-temperature stable protective colloids that provide for minimal fluid loss under
pressure.
For water-based drilling fluids, water-soluble polymers are adequate, typically
poly(acrylamide). A disadvantage of these polymers is that they have a limited
temperature stability.
Polymers based on AAm have been developed, which exhibit effective rheo￾logical properties and high temperature/high pressure (HTHP) filtration control at
temperatures of 260 ◦C or more [142].
These are terpolymers composed from AAm, AMPS or alkali metal salts, and a
third monomer which can be an acrylate, N-vinyl lactam, or N-vinylpyridine [142].
Examples of copolymers are listed in Table 2.18.

In order to assist effective seal forming for filtration control, a plugging agent is
added [142]. Examples of suitable plugging agents include, sized sulfonated asphalt,
limestone, marble, mica, graphite, cellulosics, lignins, and cellophanes.
Other additives may be used in the drilling fluid system. Such additives include,
shale stabilizers, further filtration control additives, suspending agents, dispersants,
anti-balling additives, lubricants, weighting agents, seepage control additives, lost
circulation additives, drilling enhancers, penetration rate enhancers, corrosion in￾hibitors, buffers, gelling agents, crosslinking agents, salts, biocides, and bridging
agents [142].
After static ageing up to 260 ◦C for 16 h, the HTHP filtrate was measured
extensively, with results of less than 25 cm3min−1 [142].
Similar copolymers with N-vinyl-N-methylacetamide as a comonomer have been
proposed for hydraulic cement compositions [31].
The polymers are effective at well bottom hole temperatures ranging from 93
to 260 ◦C and are not adversely affected by brine. Terpolymers of 30-90 mol%
AMPS, 5-60 mol% of styrene, and residual AA are also suitable for well cementing
operations [143].
A fluid loss additive useful in cementing oil and gas wells is a blend of a
copolymer of AAm/vinyl imidazole [32–34]. The second component in the blend
is a copolymer of vinylpyrrolidone and the sodium salt of vinylsulfonate. Details
are given in Table 2.19. The copolymers are mixed together in the range of 20:80
to 80:20. Sodium or potassium salts or a sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde
condensate can be used as a dispersant.
An N-vinylpyrrolidone/AAm random copolymer (0.05-5.0%) is used for cement￾ing compositions [35,144]. Furthermore, a sulfonate-containing cement dispersant
is necessary. The additive can be used in wells with a bottom hole temperature of
30-150 ◦C.
The fluid loss additive mixture is especially effective at low temperatures, for
example, below 40 ◦C and in sodium silicate-extended slurries. For aqueous cement
slurries a copolymer of N-vinylpyrrolidone and a salt of styrene sulfonic acid has
been proposed [36]. A naphthalene sulfonic acid salt condensed with formaldehyde
serves as a dispersant.
The fluid loss control of aqueous, clay-based drilling mud compositions is
enhanced by the addition of a hydrolyzed copolymer of AAm and an N-vinylamide
[37]. The copolymer, which is effective over a broad range of molecular weights,
contains at least 5 mol% of the N-vinylamide units, which are hydrolyzed to
Table 2.19 Copolymer Blends for Fluid Loss [32–34]

N-vinylamine units. The copolymers can be made from various ratios of N￾vinylamide and AAm by using common radical polymerization techniques.
N-Vinylamide can be polymerized by the inverse emulsion polymerization
technique [145]. The polymers of that monomer are used in cementing compositions
for oil and gas wells. The method for preparing the inverse, or water-in-oil, emulsion
involves colloidally dispersing an aqueous solution containing 10-90% water-soluble
N-vinylamide in a hydrocarbon liquid, using a surfactant with a hydrophilic￾lipophilic balance value between 4 and 9.
The weight ratio of a monomer-containing aqueous solution to hydrocarbon
liquid is preferably from 1:2 to 2:1. To initiate the polymerization, an azo type free
radical initiator is used. The resultant high-molecular-weight polymer emulsion has a
low viscosity ranging from 2 to less than 10 c P at 15% solids (60 rpm Brookfield and
20 ◦C), thus eliminating problems of solution viscosity that arise when the polymer
is prepared by a solution polymerization process.
Copolymers of styrene with AMPS having fluid loss capabilities for use in
well cementing operations have been described [45]. The styrene is present in an
amount of 15-60 mol%, and the AMPS is present in an amount of 40-85 mol%.
The poly(styrene) units are not hydrophilic, so AMPS will affect solubility in water.
AMPS is shown in Figure 2.16.
Copolymers of mainly AA and 2-20% of itaconic acid are described as fluid loss
additives for aqueous drilling fluids [50]. The polymers have an average molecular
weight of 100-500 kDa and are water-dispersible. The polymers are advantageous
when used with muds containing soluble calcium and muds containing chloride ions,
such as sea water muds.
Copolymers from the monomers AMPS, diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride
(DADMAC), VIMA, AAms, and acrylates are particularly useful for fluid loss
additives [38]. The molecular weights of the copolymers range from 200 to 1000 kDa.
The copolymers are used in suspensions of solids in aqueous systems, including
saline, as water binders. In these systems, the water release to a formation is
substantially reduced by the addition of one or more of these copolymers.
A suitable formulation for filtration reducers, good temperature resistance (over
200 ◦C), and good tolerance to salts and calcium compounds is a copolymer of AMPS
and other vinyl monomers [46].

An additive described for reducing the water loss and enhancing other properties
of well-treating fluids in high-temperature subterranean environments consists of
polymers or copolymers from N-vinyl lactam monomers or vinyl-containing sul￾fonate monomers. Organic compounds like lignites, tannins, and asphaltic materials
are added as dispersants [53].
Oil soluble styrene acrylate copolymers
Oil soluble polymers in a form of a gel can be used as a fluid loss additive for drilling
WBM compositions. By utilizing such an oil soluble polymer in drilling WBMs, the
high temperature stability greatly improved. Further, improved shear resistance can
be obtained [146,147].
Such oil soluble polymers are copolymers based on acrylates, styrene, vinyl
toluene, butadiene, and others [148].
Crosslinking monomers include allyl maleate, divinylbenzene, and multifunc￾tional acrylates, as well as methacrylates. The monomers are detailed in the literature
[149]. These acrylic copolymers are also used as binders for masonry applications,
concrete and metal protection, intumescent coatings [150], and as modifiers for toner
compositions.
The oil soluble polymer is highly efficient in small proportions as a fluid
loss reducer. It may be incorporated in the mud in an amount of only 0.5-2.5%.
The oil soluble polymer is added to a WBM prepared by conventional methods,
either in replacement of the conventional fluid loss reducers, or in addition to
conventional fluid loss reducers [147]. Mud formulations have been given in detail
elsewhere [149].
In addition, the filtration value is significantly reduced after high temperature
aging when a crosslinked copolymer is used in a standard water-based drilling fluid
formulation [147].
AMPS terpolymer
The fluid loss can be reduced by adding a terpolymer. The monomers and the
composition are given in Table 2.20.
Zwitterionic copolymers
Zwitterionic copolymers are widely used for fluid loss additive in water-based
drilling fluid due to their good performance in reducing filtration loss and inhibiting

the swelling of shales [151]. However, there are still shortcomings to the conventional
zwitterionic copolymer such as the poor properties of salt tolerance and thermal
stability.
A new kind of copolymer was synthesized, consisting of acrylamide, 2-
acryloylamino-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (cf. Figure 2.17), diallyl dimethyl
ammonium chloride, and the synthesized betaine-type monomer (vinylphenyl
sulfonate) (copolymer [PVAAD]) through introducing these monomers onto the
backbone of acrylamide using the method of free radical polymerization in an
aqueous solution.
The biggest difference of PVAAD with the conventional zwitterionic copolymer
is that there are zwitterions in the same chain and the different chain in the molecular
structure of PVAAD.
It was shown that the synthesized PVAAD used as a fluid loss additive has good
performance. It could be used as a fluid loss additive for water-based drilling fluid
in salty and high-temperature environments. After adding 1.25% of PVAAD, the
structure of the filter cake of PVAAD containing a drilling fluid system became
relatively uniform and dense, and the particle size distribution of the freshwater
drilling fluid tended to become more rational [151].
Poly(AMPS/AM/SSS)
A polymer, poly(AMPS/AM/SSS), was synthesized using acrylamide, 2-acrylamido￾2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, and sodium p-styrenesulfonate [152]. The structure
of this polymer is shown in Figure 2.18. The thermal stability was investigated by
thermogravimetry.
The poly(AMPS/AM/SSS) was introduced into a water-based drilling fluid
system. It could be shown that the use of poly(AMPS/AM/SSS) significantly
improved the filtration performance of the drilling fluid system. The filtrate volume
as a function of time for a drilling fluid system at different poly(AMPS/AM/SSS)
concentrations is shown in Figure 2.19.
When the poly(AMPS/AM/SSS) adding amount is 0.6% and 1.2%, it was found
that the filtrate volume is 9.20 and 10.4 ml, respectively, after 30 min. The value of
filtrate volume is acceptable for drilling operation. Moreover, the filtration rate was
close to 0 ml min−1 at 10 min.172 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives

In addition, it was found that the flow curve of water-based drilling fluid systems
is more fitted to the Herschel-Bulkley flow model [153]. Furthermore, the thermal
resistance of the water-based drilling fluid system was improved [152].
When adding the amount of 1.2%, it was found that the water drilling fluid is
more fitted to the Herschel-Bulkley flow model. The results of adsorption analysis,
the ζ -potential method, and morphology analysis showed that poly(AMPS/AM/SSS)
improves the filtration properties of the drilling fluid system by absorption and
physical plugging [154].2.6 Synthetic polymers 173

2.6.9 SILICONES
Compositions based on silicone MQ resins have been proposed for fluid loss control
for WBM. These compositions are non-damaging [155]. A MQ resin is a resin that
contains only monovalent trimethylsiloxane units (CH3)3SiO1/2, abbreviated as M
and tetravalent siloxane units Q, SiO4/2, c.f., Figure 2.20.
The terms 1/2 and 4/2 after the oxygen indicates that the oxygen atom is shared
between both groups M and Q. The resin does not contain more than 15 mol%
hydroxyl units.
Such silicone resins are maintaining the solubility in hydrocarbons across a wide
range of molecular weights. In addition, silicone resins with a large proportion of Q
units show a high glass transition temperature(Tg). High glass transition temperatures
allow wellbore fluids to be used at temperatures far higher than comparable fluids that
are based on resins that are free from silicon moieties.
The silicone resin is used as an emulsion, for example, DOW CORNINGo˝
1430 Antifoam [156]. The formulations contain conventional ingredients, such as
surfactants, viscosity modifying agents, and biocides.
2.6.10 PHTHALIMIDE AS A DIVERTING MATERIAL
Phthalimide, c.f., Figure 2.21, has been described as a diverting material, or fluid loss
additive, for diverting aqueous treating fluids, including acids, into progressively less
permeable portions of a subterranean formation [157].
The additive also reduces the fluid loss to the formation of an aqueous or
hydrocarbon treating fluid utilized, for example, in fracturing treatments. The use
of the material depends on the particle size of the material that is used.
Phthalimide will withstand high formation temperatures and can be readily
removed from the formation by dissolution in the produced fluids or by sublimation
at elevated temperatures. The material is compatible either with other formation
permeability-reducing materials or formation permeability-increasing materials. The
phthalimide particles act by sealing off portions of a subterranean formation by
blocking off the fissures, pores, channels, and vugs that grant access to the formation
from the wellbore penetrating the formation.174 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives

2.6.11 CONTROL OF DEGRADATION RATES FOR POLYMERIC
DIVERTING AGENTS
Hydrolytically degradable polymers have been used in a variety of applications
in the oil field, such as fluid diversion, fluid-loss control, and filter cake removal
applications [158].
Once the well is completed or placed on production, it is desirable to remove the
degradable materials so that they no longer have any influence on subsequent fluid
flow.
Namely, with time and temperature, the degradable polymers will break down by
forming water-soluble byproducts, and can leave behind a limited residual formation
damage. However, for cooler temperatures and applications for which the well must
be placed on production rather quickly, there have not been many options to increase
the rates of polymer degradation. Strong acids and bases are known to accelerate
the degradation of polyesters. Using these materials may have several disadvantages,
such as corrosion or undesirable reactions with the formation [158].
Amine- and aminoalcohol-based compounds have been discussed as potential
degradation accelerators of polymers with ester groups in the backbone. Oligomeric
poly(amine)s and amino alcohols, such as ethanolamine were tested as degradation
accelerators.
Poly(lactide)s were used for degradation testing. The tests were performed under
static conditions. The results indicated that oligomeric poly(amine)s accelerated the
polymer degradation significantly in comparison to water. The degradation rates
were the highest for totally amorphous polymers and decreased with increasing
crystallinity [158].
Some semicrystalline polymers appeared to increase in weight initially before
manifesting weight loss because of degradation. Trialkanolamines seemed to cause a
swelling of particulate semicrystalline polymers before a significant weight loss due
to degradation occurred [158].
2.6.12 SPECIAL APPLICATIONS
Coal-bed methane drilling
A series of mud systems and additives, which are commonly used in coal-bed
methane drilling have been evaluated with respect of their impact on the permeability2.6 Synthetic polymers 175
of the coal matrix. Laboratory tests using both artificially cleated gypstone rock,
as well as large-diameter coal cores, were performed for assessment. In particular,
various mud systems have been tested, including polyanionic and non-ionic cellulose
and starch.
Muds based on xanthan gum, HEC, and Na-CMC did not have a negative impact
on coal permeability. FLC 2000 and Q-Stop are very effective in building a thin filter
cake on the coal surface almost instantaneously.
FLC 2000 is a micelle surfactant that very quickly forms a deformable barrier
across coal cleats. Q-Stop consists of cellulose fibers. During production simulation
experiments, a small pressure drop was sufficient to remove the filter cake.
It was shown that the permeability of the coal returned to its original value.
This indicates that there is no permanent permeability damage caused by the use
of these additives. On the other hand, using the same coal type, the near wellbore
coal permeability was reduced by 87.5% by the addition of coal fines. Based on
these laboratory studies, successful field applications in horizontal drilling could be
achieved [159]. The damage is illustrated in Table 2.21.
Sand control
The rate of hydrocarbon flow declines when the bottom hole pressure falls below the
dew point. When this occurs, a liquid aqueous phase accumulates near the well. This
accumulation is sometimes addressed as condensate blocking. This effect reduces the
relative permeability of the hydrocarbons and thus the productivity of the well [160].
In addition, if water swellable clays are present in this region, swelling is likely
to occur. Swelling further reduces the permeability of the formation. Well treatment
fluids sometimes decrease the relative permeability of hydrocarbons. Capillary forces
can tightly hold these treatment fluids. The rate of hydrocarbon flow can be also
reduced by [160]:
1. the production of fines,
2. sand migration in the formation, or
3. precipitation.

The high velocity in the porous medium near the wellbore is sometimes sufficient
to mobilize fines that subsequently can plug channels in the formation. Formation
sand and fines often become unstable and migrate due to water movement through
the formation. Fines are most likely to move when the water phase is mobile because
most of the fines are water-wet.
The presence of a mobile water phase can cause the migration of fines and
subsequent formation damage. Therefore, it is desirable to minimize the migration
of the fines, since fines block flow paths, choking the potential production of the
well, as well as causing damage to downhole and surface equipment [160].
Unconsolidated subterranean zones include those that contain loose particulates
and those wherein the bonded particulates have insufficient bond strength to with￾stand the forces produced by the production of fluids through the zones. Support
devices, such as screens and slotted liners are often used to provide support for these
unconsolidated formations to inhibit a collapse of the formation.
In some instances, the annulus around the support device is gravel-packed to
reduce the amount of voids between the device and the wellbore wall. Gravel packing
forms a filtration bed near the well bore that acts as a physical barrier to the
transport of unconsolidated formation fines with the production of hydrocarbons.
These support devices provide support for the wellbore and gravel packing and
prevent fines from entering into the well.
One common type of gravel packing operation involves the placement of a gravel
pack screen in the well bore and packing the surrounding annulus between the screen
and the well bore with gravel of a specific mesh size designed to prevent the passage
of formation sand. Basically, the gravel pack screen is a filter assembly in order to
retain the gravel placed during a gravel pack operation.
The structure built up by a gravel pack operation acts as a barrier for the migration
of the sand from the formation while still permitting fluid flow. Gravel packs may be
time consuming and expensive to install. Due to the time and expense needed it is
sometimes advantageous to place a screen without the gravel.
An expandable screen is often installed to maintain the diameter of the wellbore
for ease of access at a later time by eliminating installation of conventional screens,
gravel placement, and other equipment.
Consolidation of a subterranean formation zone is often done by pumping a
sequence of a resin, a spacer fluid and a catalyst. Such a resin application may be
problematic, when an insufficient amount of the spacer fluid is used. Then the resin
may contact the external catalyst too early.
An extensive review of literature concerning the methods for controlling un￾consolidated particulates has been presented [160]. Further, treatment fluids for
controlling the migration of unconsolidated particulates in subterranean formations
have been developed, wherein a diluted epoxy resin is applied. As diluent a fluid that
is miscible with water is used, that is, methanol [161]. The addition of this solvent
adjusts the viscosity of the resin composite so that finally a high degree of penetration
into the subterranean formation can occur.2.6 Synthetic polymers 177
Reduction of fines migration
Formation damage of oil reservoirs as a result of fines migration is the major reason
for a decline in productivity. Formation fines are unconfined solid particles present
in the pore spaces of the formations. Their migration, caused by fluid flow in the
reservoir, can cause pore plugging and permeability reduction.
Nanofluids that contain nanoparticles exhibit specific properties, such as a high
tendency for adsorption and are thus good candidates for injection into the near￾wellbore region, because of their sizes [162]. A packed column has been used to
study the behavior of different types of nanoparticles to reduce fines migration in
synthetic porous materials.
Three types of nanoparticles, MgO, SiO2, and Al2O3 have been used to investi￾gate their effects on the movement of fines. The results indicate that fines may adhere
to the matrix grains, hindering their migration, when the porous materials are soaked
with nanofluids. In order to check the mechanisms of this remediation technique,
the effect of nanoparticle concentration and fluid flow rates in the medium on fines
detachment was studied [162].
A theoretical model was used to calculate total energy of interaction for the
surfaces to check experimental results, which was also validated with scanning
electron microscope (SEM) pictures for samples from synthetic cores. The results
showed that addition of 0.1% of MgO and SiO2 nanoparticles reduced fines migration
by 15% compared with the reference state. MgO nanoparticles were found to be more
effective, even at high fluid rates, when used at a higher concentration, as noticed in
the macroscopic and microscopic results [162].
Fracturing
Hydrocarbon producing wells are often stimulated by hydraulic fracturing opera￾tions, wherein a viscous fracturing fluid is introduced into the hydrocarbon producing
zone within a subterranean formation at a hydraulic pressure sufficient to create or
enhance at least one fracture therein.
Generally, the fracturing fluid suspends proppant particles that are to be placed in
the fractures to prevent the fractures from fully closing (once the hydraulic pressure is
released), thereby forming conductive channels within the formation through which
hydrocarbons can flow. Once at least one fracture is created and at least a portion
of the proppant is substantially in place, the viscosity of the fracturing fluid may be
reduced, to be removed from the formation.
In certain circumstances, a portion of the fracturing fluid may be lost during the
fracturing operation, for example, through undesirable leak-off into natural fractures
present in the formation. This is problematic because such natural fractures often
have higher stresses than fractures created by a fracturing operation. These higher
stresses may damage the proppant and cause it to form an impermeable plug in the
natural fractures that may prevent hydrocarbons from flowing through the natural
fractures.
Conventionally, operators have attempted to solve this problem by including a
fluid loss control additive in the fracturing fluid. Conventional fluid loss control178 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives
additives generally comprise rigid particles having a spheroid shape. The use of these
additives can be problematic, because such additives may require particles that have
a distinct particle-size distribution to achieve efficient fluid loss control.
For example, when such additives are used to block the pore throats in the
formation, a sufficient portion of relatively large particles will be required to
obstruct the majority of the pore throat, and a sufficient portion of relatively small
particles will also be required to obstruct the interstices between the large particles.
Furthermore, for certain conventional fluid loss control additives, such a desired
particle-size distribution may be difficult to obtain without incurring the added
expense of reprocessing the materials, for example, by cryogenically grinding them
to achieve the desired particle-size distribution [117].
Biomimetic adhesive compositions
Subterranean treatment operations are a field application where it can sometimes
be desirable to utilize adhesive compositions [163]. Adhesive compositions can be
used in subterranean formations to consolidate a loosely consolidated formation,
to improve structural integrity of the wellbore, or to consolidate a particulate pack.
Tackifying can be used in this regard in subterranean treatment operations.
Although these tackifying agents can often be successfully used in subterranean
treatment operations, there may still be certain applications in which they are
chemically unstable or are otherwise difficult to deploy operationally. Furthermore,
some components of traditional adhesive compositions can present challenges from
the standpoint of biodegradability or environmentally acceptability [163].
Biological organisms are well known for their ability to construct a wide breadth
of biomaterials, many of which have properties that are unrivaled by their synthetic
counterparts.
Biomaterials can be used for a wide variety of purposes by biological organisms
including, support and protection, for example, endoskeletons, exoskeletons, shells,
trapping of prey, for example, spider webs, locomotion, and surface adhesion.
Self-assembly may play a role in the formation of many of these biomaterials.
Self-assembly refers to the spontaneous organization of substances to form stable,
well-organized, structurally defined arrays without the influence of external forces.
Studies of the structure of biomaterials may provide an inspiration for designed
synthetic materials. In some cases, a synthetic material can attempt to replicate the
structure of a biomaterial. In other cases, a synthetic material can have a significantly
different structure than the parent biomaterial, but still incorporate a structural
element therefrom, sometimes in modified form.
Structurally modified synthetic materials that retain a structural element or
modified structural element of a parent biomaterial are often referred to as biomimetic
materials. Modification of the parent biomaterial structure, as in biomimetic mate￾rials, may be beneficial when the parent biomaterial is unsuitable for an intended
application due to undesirable properties such as, for example, cost, stability,
mechanical properties, physical properties, chemical properties, and the like [163].2.6 Synthetic polymers 179
Adhesive compositions, in particular, are ubiquitous among biological organisms
due to their ability to effectively function in a variety of environments. Marine
mussels and other marine organisms, in particular, are known for their ability to
secrete adhesive proteins, that is, bioadhesives that can form a coacervate in the
mussels’ aqueous habitat.
Most typically, these adhesive proteins contain a 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine or
a catechol type moiety within the polymer structure. It is believed that catechol
type moieties are susceptible to oxidation, particularly in the presence of transition
metal ions, thereby forming an o-quinone, which ultimately undergoes a crosslinking
reaction with another catechol type moiety.
Although these types of adhesive proteins and others can be easily synthesized
by biological organisms, such proteins represent a much greater challenge for com￾mercial production and field applications. Furthermore, protein derived biomaterials
may provide a poor stability at elevated temperatures or in certain types of chemical
environments [163].
Polymerizable derivatives of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene or 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene
compounds are shown in Table 2.22.
It is believed that 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene compounds may function similarly
to 1,2-dihydroxybenzene compounds in their ability to form an o-quinone. Also,
suitable 1,2-dihydroxybenzene compounds may be 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and
dopamine [163].
Polymer-modified asphalt
Polymer-modified asphalt is used in drilling fluids for filtration control, lost circu￾lation control, drill string differential sticking prevention, and wellbore stabilization
[164]. A latex-modified asphalt is a mixture of a latex-asphalt complex, asphalt, and

latex particles that help to maintain the wellbore stability while drilling into shale
formations.
A polymer-modified latex is effective for controlling laminated and microfrac￾tured shale. In addition, polymers may be functionalized to react with the asphalt to
create copolymer modifications of the asphalt for improved performance as drilling
fluid additives.
Polymers that are useful for the incorporation into polymer-modified asphalt are
summarized in Table 2.23.2.6 Synthetic polymers 181
The type of polymer that should be used may vary with the particular application.
The polymers described in Table 2.23 should be physically dispersed into the asphalt,
but do not necessarily chemically react with it.
On the other hand, the polymers may be functionalized to produce a chemical
bond with the components of the asphalt to create copolymer modifications of the
asphalt for improved performance. Reactive polymers have typically been used to
increase the stability of the compounded product. Functionalization may include the
blending the polymer with a fatty dialkyl amide that contains a functional group
that can react with the asphalt. Suitable functional groups include maleic anhydride,
epoxy rings, esters such as methyl-, ethyl-, or butyl-acrylates, carboxylates, and
combinations thereof [164].
For example, the polymer may be reacted with maleic anhydride to maleate the
polymer. Alternatively, the polymer can be reacted with a sulfonate to achieve sul￾fonation of the polymer. Suitable sulfonates are poly(styrene) sulfonates, sulfonated
poly(ether sulfone), and copolymers containing the 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane
sulfonic acid monomer. In addition, functionalization may occur by copolymerizing
the polymer with a poly(ethylene) that contains epoxy rings.
The functionalized polymer latex increases the dispersability in comparison to an
unfunctionalized polymer latex [164]. The proportion of polymer latex ranges in the
asphalt-polymer mixture from about 1.5% to 30%.
Cement compositions
Polymers have been used as fluid loss control additives in cementing operations.
These include HEC and carboxymethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, copolymers of AMPS
and AAm or N,N-dimethylacrylamide, and lignin or lignite grafted with AMPS,
acrylonitrile, and N,N-dimethylacrylamide.
These fluid loss control additives, however, may not provide the desired level
of fluid loss control at high temperatures, that is, at least about 260 ◦C [165].
Alternatively, a backbone of a humic acid salt has been proposed onto that similar
moieties as mentioned above are grafted. These graft copolymers are particularly
suitable for the use as fluid loss control additives in high temperature applications.
Humic acids emerge from the decomposition of organic matter, such as dead
plants. Humic acid may comprise allomelanins found in soils, coals, and peat. In
addition, the backbone may further comprise PVA, PEO, poly(propylene oxide),
poly(ethyleneimine), and combinations of these moieties. Humic acid may be treated
with KOH, NaOH, or NH4OH in order to solubilize the humic acid in water.
The caustic treatment dissolves or disperses a portion of the humic acid into a
solution. This solution is further concentrated to increase the humic acid content or
may be used directly in the grafting process. The graft copolymers may be prepared
using any of a variety of free radical polymerization techniques. The initiators
employed in these free radical techniques to produce exemplary embodiments of
the graft copolymer generally comprise a redox initiator capable of generating a free
radical in the humic acid, which will initiate the polymerization.182 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives

sodium humate, water, a defoamer, and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid are added. Then
AMPS, AAm, DADMAC, AA are added. Then this mixture is heated and kept at 70 ◦C
for 1 h while purging with nitrogen.
Afterwards, ammonium persulfate is added to initiate the polymerization. After 2 h,
sodium metabisulfite is added, and the mixture was allowed to cool. When the mixture
reaches room temperature, a 50% solution of sodium hydroxide is added to adjust the pH
to 7-8 [165]. The amounts of the individual compounds are summarized in Table 2.24.
In additional experiments, the performance of the additives have been tested
with regard to cementing. Compressive strength and thickening time tests were
performed to compare the performance of cement compositions. The fluid loss of
these compositions has been tested at high temperatures [165]. The formulations
provide desirable thickening times and compressive strengths.
Viscoelasticity
Viscoelastic materials that exhibit both viscous and elastic properties under mechani￾cal deformation. Such materials exhibit a hysteresis in the stress strain curves. Further
a relaxation of stress occurs under constant strain, that is, the stress is diminished.
Moreover, viscoelastic materials are creeping.
A simple model for such materials has been worked out by James Clerk Maxwell
already in 1867 [166]. A Maxwell fluid, or Maxwell body can be modeled by an
idealized viscous damper and by an idealized elastic spring that connected in series.
The basic device is shown in Figure 2.22.2.6 Synthetic polymers 183
Damper Spring
FIGURE 2.22

Thus the Maxwell model can explain both elastic properties and viscous proper￾ties. Some basic issues of the Maxwell model have been revisited [167]. The basic
Maxwell model can be represented by

The change of total elongation εt in time t is the sum of the change of
elongation of the damper εd and the change of elongation of the spring εt. The right￾hand side of Eq. 2.6 contains simply Newton’s law of flow and Hooke’s law of the
elongation of an ideal spring, that is,
dεd

the latter in the rather uncommon differential form. Thus, η is the Newtonian
viscosity, σ is the stress and E is the elastic modulus. By the way, if the spring and
the damper are coupled parallel instead of consecutively, the Kelvin-Voigt model
emerges, which may be experienced in self closing doors.
The property of viscoelasticity has been well investigated [168]. Aqueous solu￾tions of cationic surfactants with strong binding forces of the ions show properties
similar to gels.
Microstructural transitions and rheological properties of viscoelastic solutions
formed in a catanionic surfactant system were studied using a combination of
rheology and dynamic light scattering [169]. The rheological behavior can be very
complicated. In a study on a surfactant system based on dodecyltriethylammonium
bromide and sodium dodecyl sulfate, worm like micelles began to form above a cer￾tain surfactant concentration, caused by the growth of small cylindrical micelles. In
an intermediate concentration range, the system exhibits a linear viscoelasticity with
the characteristics of a Maxwell fluid. Eventually, at higher surfactant concentrations,
a transition from linear micelles to branched structures may take place.
The changes of the viscosity at zero shear rate with the total concentration of
surfactant with a ratio of dodecyltriethylammonium bromide to sodium dodecyl
sulfate of 27/73 are shown in Figure 2.23.184 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives

Viscoelastic surfactants
Viscoelastic surfactants (VES) have been used in fluids for many well treatment
operations. Viscoelastic surfactants can be used to provide a high viscosity or gelled
fluid and can be readily removed from the formation so that they do not damage the
formation the way polymer systems can.
Viscoelastic surfactant systems under proper conditions form long rod like or
worm like micelles in aqueous solution. Entanglement of these micelle structures
provides viscosity and elasticity to the fluid. When these fluids are subjected to
shear, the shear disrupts the micelle network so that the fluids exhibit shear thinning
behavior. When the shear rate is eliminated, or reduced, the apparent viscosity of the
fluid recovers as the VES micelle network reassembles.
Viscoelasticity is caused by a different type of micelle formation than the
usual spherical micelles formed by most surfactants. Viscoelastic surfactants (VESs)
are believed to impart viscosity to an aqueous fluid by the molecules organizing
themselves into micelles. Spherical micelles do not give increased viscosity, however,
when the micelles have an elongated configuration, for instance are rod-shaped
or worm-shaped, they become entangled with one another thereby increasing the
viscosity of the fluid [170].
Elongated VES structures are referred to as living because there is a continuous
exchange of VES-type surfactants leaving the VES micelle structures to the aqueous
solution and other surfactants leaving the aqueous solution and entering or reentering
the VES micelle structures.2.6 Synthetic polymers 185
VES solutions exhibit a shear thinning behavior. They remain stable despite
repeated high shear applications. By comparison, a typical polymeric thickener will
irreversibly degrade when subjected to high shear applications [171].
Internal breakers work by the rearrangement of the VES micelle from rod-shaped
or worm-shaped elongated structures to spherical structures. In other words, they
perform the collapse or rearrangement of the viscous elongated micelle structures to
nonviscous, more spherical micelle structures [170].
Enhanced shear recovery agents. Some viscoelastic surfactant fluids exhibit a low
shear recovery when subjected to high shear. However, unacceptably long shear
recovery times hinder the operation of deep well oilfield applications. Enhanced shear
recovery agents reduce the shear recovery time of a viscoelastic surfactant fluid.
Enhanced shear recovery agents are based on alkylated poly(glucoside)s,
poly(glucamide)s, or on copolymers based on ethylene glycol ethyl ether acrylate.
Glucamides consist of cyclic forms of glucose in which the hydrogen of the
hemiacetal group has been replaced with an alkyl or aryl moiety. The basic structures
of glucoside and glucamide are shown in Figure 2.24.
Enzyme-based gel breaking. The viscosities of fluids viscosified with VES may be
reduced by the direct or indirect action of a biochemical agent, such as bacteria, fungi,
or enzymes. The biochemical agent may directly attack the VES itself, or some other
component in the fluid that produces a byproduct that then causes viscosity reduction.
The biochemical agent may disaggregate or otherwise attack the micellar structure
of the VES-gelled fluid. The biochemical agent may produce an enzyme that reduces
viscosity by one of these mechanisms.
A single biochemical agent may operate simultaneously by two different mecha￾nisms, such as by degrading the VES directly, as well as another component, such as
a glycol, the latter mechanism in turn producing a byproduct, for example, an alcohol
that causes viscosity reduction.
Alternatively, two or more different biochemical agents may be used simultane￾ously. In a specific, non-limiting instance, a brine fluid gelled with an amine oxide
surfactant can have its viscosity broken with bacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae,
Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. [172].

Breaker enhancers for VES. Oil soluble surfactants may be used as breaker en￾hancers for internal breakers for VES-gelled aqueous fluids [170]. The oil soluble
surfactant breaker enhancers can overcome the rate-slowing effect that salinity has
on the internal breakers, particularly at lower temperatures. In addition, oil soluble
surfactant breaker enhancers may allow lower internal breaker concentrations to be
used to achieve quick and complete VES-gelled fluid breaks.
Oil soluble surfactant breaker enhancers include various sorbitan (unsaturated)
fatty acid esters [170,173]. These esters are mixed with mineral oils. Unsaturated
fatty acids have been found to break down by autooxidation into VES breaking
products or compositions.
Each oil with various monoenoic and polyenoic acids uniquely shows the break￾down of the VES surfactant micelle structure by the presence of these autooxidation
generated byproducts.
Various hydroperoxides may be formed in the course of these autooxidation re￾actions, The end products of these reactions typically include, carbonyl compounds,
alcohols, acids, and hydrocarbons. The rate of autooxidation of various fatty acids is
shown in Table 2.25.
A problem for VES-gelled fluids that do not contain polysaccharides that are
easily degraded by the addition of enzymes or oxidizers, but have inside low
molecular weight surfactants is that conventional enzymes and oxidizers have not
been found to degrade these surfactant molecules [174].
It has been found that oil soluble surfactants may be used as breaker enhancers
for internal breakers for VES-gelled aqueous fluids. Oil soluble surfactants may allow
lower internal breaker concentrations to be used to achieve quick and complete VES￾gelled fluid breaks.
Such oil soluble surfactants can activate polyenoic acids and mineral oil internal
breakers so that they may be used in high salinity brines down to ambient tempera￾tures. In addition, the oil soluble surfactants are relatively inexpensive, may be used
in relatively low concentrations.
Suitable oil soluble surfactant breaker enhancers include, sorbitan fatty acid
esters, such as sorbitan monolaurate, sorbitan monopalmitate, sorbitan monostearate,
sorbitan tristearate, sorbitan monooleate, sorbitan trioleate, and sorbitan monolau￾rate, which are commercially available [174].

Oligomerization of unsaturated quaternary compounds [175].
Surfactant polymer compositions
The stability of viscoelastic surfactant based fluids can be enhanced by using
monomeric viscoelastic surfactants together with an oligomeric or polymeric com￾pound with a thermally stable backbone. On this structure, viscoelastic surfactant
functional groups are pending [175].
A viscoelastic surfactant solution can be synthesized from N-dodecene-1-yl-N,N￾bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-methylammonium chloride in aqueous ammonium chloride.
The aqueous solution is purged with nitrogen to remove residual oxygen and
then oligomerized with 2,2-azo(bis-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride as radical
initiator. The oligomerization is shown schematically in Figure 2.25.

can be oligomerized. The resulting oligomer can be imagined as related to an oligo
ethylene backbone, to which relatively long pendant surfactant moieties are linked.
If the double bonds are conjugated, as in the case of potassium octadecadieneoate,
CH2=CH−CH=CH−(CH2)13COOK+
the resulting oligomeric structure is related rather to poly(butadiene).
The oligomerization of the surfactant monomers in micelles effects that the
viscosity of the gel becomes comparatively insensitive in contact with hydrocarbons.
Further, the viscosity of the surfactant gel is hardly altered by the oligomerization of
the surfactant monomers.
The preparation of several other oligomeric surfactants has been described in
detail including the use of comonomers [175,176]. An example for a cooligomer
is shown in Figure 2.26.
The vicinal diol functionality renders the oligomers readily crosslinkable with
polyvalent metal ions or complexes. The formulations have been characterized with
respect to fluid loss control by an API standard [6].
Additives to reduce fluid loss
Viscoelastic surfactant fluids are made by mixing suitable surfactants. When the
surfactant concentration significantly exceeds a critical level, and eventually sub￾jected to the presence of an electrolyte, the surfactant molecules aggregate and form
structures, such as micelles that can interact to form a network exhibiting viscoelastic
behavior [177].
Viscoelastic surfactant solutions can be formed by the addition of certain reagents
to concentrated solutions of surfactants. The surfactants are long chain quaternary
ammonium salts such as cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide.2.6 Synthetic polymers 189
Reagents that generate the viscoelasticity in the surfactant solutions are salts,
for example, ammonium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium salicylate and sodium
isocyanate. In addition, non-ionic organic molecules, such as chloroform are active
in generating viscoelasticity. The electrolyte content of surfactant solutions is also
an important parameter for the viscoelasticity [177]. Aqueous fluids gelled with
viscoelastic surfactants VESs have been used for hydraulic fracturing operations.
However, the same property that makes VES fluids less damaging tends to
result in significantly higher fluid leakage into the reservoir matrix, which reduces
the efficiency of the fluid especially during VES fracturing treatments. Thus, it is
important to use fluid loss agents for VES fracturing treatments in high-permeability
formations [178].
The fluid loss properties of such fluids can be improved by the addition of mineral
oil which has a viscosity greater than 20 mPa s at ambient temperature.
The mineral oil may initially be dispersed as oil droplets in an internal, discon￾tinuous phase of the fluid. The mineral oil is added to the fluid after it has been
substantially gelled.
In the experiments reproduced below, tallowamidopropylamine oxide has been
used as VES surfactant, which is available from Akzo Nobel [179]. It has been
demonstrated that the viscosity of aqueous fluids containing 3% KCl and gelled
with 6% VES at 66 ◦C without and with 2% mineral oil is adversely affected. This
behavior is in contrast to other observations, since larger amounts of hydrocarbons
and mineral oils tend to inhibit or break the gel of VES-gelled fluids [178].
On the other hand, the fluid loss is improved as shown in model experiments. The
fluid loss as a function of testing time is shown in Figure 2.27.
The test is conducted at 0.7 MPa with 400 mD ceramic discs at 66 ◦C.
It has been discovered that the addition of magnesium oxide, or calcium
hydroxide, to an aqueous fluid gelled with a VES improves the fluid loss of these
brines [180].
It is useful that these fluid loss control agents dissolve slowly, which permits their
removal from the formation to be easy and complete maintaining little or no damage
to the formation.
The introduction of these additives to a VES-gelled aqueous system will limit and
reduce the amount of VES fluid which leaks-off into the pores of a reservoir during
a fracturing or frac-packing treatment, thus minimizing the formation damage that
may occur by the VES fluid within the reservoir pores.
Moreover, the range in reservoir permeability does not significantly control the
rate of fluid loss. Thus, the rate of leak-off in 2000 m D reservoirs will be comparable
to rate of leak-off in 100 m D reservoirs. This behavior expands the range in reservoir
permeability to which the VES fluid may be applied.
It is believed that the fluid loss agents associate with the VES micelles. As the
VES fluid is leaked-off into the reservoir, a viscous layer of micelles and fluid loss
control particles accumulate on the formation face, thus reducing the rate of VES
fluid leak-off.190 CHAPTER 2 Fluid loss additives

Particulate plugging of the reservoir pores is not the mechanism of leak-off
control. Tests with nanometer-sized fluid loss agents that definitely cannot bridge or
plug reservoir pores of 1 m D or higher reservoir permeability, still develop a viscous
micelle layer. Thus, the size of the fluid loss agent is not a controlling or primary
factor for controlling the leak-off rate [180].

3 Clay stabilization
Problems caused by shales in petroleum activities are not new. At the beginning of
the 1950s, many soil mechanics experts were interested in the swelling of clays. It is
important to maintain wellbore stability during drilling, especially in water sensitive
shale and clay formations.
The rocks within these types of formations absorb the fluid used in drilling. This
absorption causes the rock to swell and may lead to a wellbore collapse. The swelling
of clays and the problems that may arise from these phenomena have been reviewed
in the literature [1–4]. Various additives for clay stabilization are shown in Table 3.1.
3.1 PROPERTIES OF CLAYS
Clay minerals are generally crystalline in nature. The structure of the clay crystals
determines its properties. Typically, clays have a flaky, mica-type structure. Clay
flakes are made up of a number of crystal platelets stacked face to face. Each platelet
is called a unit layer, and the surfaces of the unit layer are called basal surfaces. A unit
layer is composed of multiple sheets. One sheet type is called the octahedral sheet. It
is composed of either aluminum or magnesium atoms octahedrally coordinated with
the oxygen atoms of hydroxyl groups. Another sheet type is called the tetrahedral
sheet. The tetrahedral sheet consists of silicon atoms tetrahedrally coordinated with
oxygen atoms. Sheets within a unit layer link together by sharing oxygen atoms.
When this linking occurs between one octahedral and one tetrahedral sheet, one
basal surface consists of exposed oxygen atoms while the other basal surface has
exposed hydroxyl groups. It is also quite common for two tetrahedral sheets to bond
with one octahedral sheet by sharing oxygen atoms. The resulting structure, known
as the Hoffmann structure, has an octahedral sheet that is sandwiched between the
two tetrahedral sheets [34]. As a result, both basal surfaces in a Hoffmann structure
are composed of exposed oxygen atoms.
The unit layers stack together face-to-face and are held in place by weak attractive
forces. The distance between corresponding planes in adjacent unit layers is called
the c-spacing. A clay crystal structure with a unit layer consisting of three sheets
typically has a c-spacing of about 9.5 × 10−7 mm.
In clay mineral crystals, atoms having different valences commonly will be
positioned within the sheets of the structure to create a negative potential at the crystal

surface. In that case, a cation is adsorbed on the surface. These adsorbed cations are
called exchangeable cations, because they may chemically trade places with other
cations when the clay crystal is suspended in water. In addition, ions may also be
adsorbed on the clay crystal edges and exchange with other ions in the water.
The type of substitutions occurring within the clay crystal structure and the
exchangeable cations adsorbed on the crystal surface greatly affect clay swelling,
a property of primary importance in the drilling fluid industry. Clay swelling is a3.1 Properties of clays 205
phenomenon in which water molecules surround a clay crystal structure and position
themselves to increase the structure’s c-spacing, thus resulting in an increase in
volume.
Clay stabilizers and their mechanisms of stabilizing clay minerals in improved
and enhanced oil recovery applications have been reviewed [35].
Formation damage mechanisms related to clays in conventional sandstone and
shale reservoirs were explained. Then existing clay stabilizers, including simple
inorganic salts, inorganic polymers, acids, alkalis, simple organic salts, organic
polymers, oligomers, nanoparticles, cationic surfactants, and organosilanes, as well
as their characteristics, were summarized. In addition, the common experimental
techniques that are used for the evaluation of clay stabilization were elucidated. In
addition, the issues of clay stabilization in shale reservoirs were detailed [35].
To select proper clay stabilizers and to optimize project design, it is necessary to
evaluate their performance by carrying out experiments on preserved reservoir cores.
This will allow for treatment upscaling and effectiveness prediction [35].
3.1.1 SWELLING OF CLAYS
In clay mineral crystals, atoms with different valences will be commonly positioned
within the sheets of the structure to create a negative potential at the crystal surface.
In that case, a cation is adsorbed on the surface. These adsorbed cations are called
exchangeable cations because they may chemically trade places with other cations
when the clay crystal is suspended in water. In addition, ions may also be adsorbed
on the clay crystal edges and exchange with other ions in the water [36].
The type of substitutions occurring within the clay crystal structure and the
exchangeable cations adsorbed on the crystal surface greatly affect the clay swelling.
Clay swelling is a phenomenon in which water molecules surround a clay crystal
structure and position themselves to increase the structure’s c-spacing thus resulting
in an increase in volume. Two types of swelling may occur [36]:
Surface hydration is one type of swelling in which water molecules are adsorbed
on crystal surfaces. Hydrogen bonding holds a layer of water molecules to the oxygen
atoms exposed on the crystal surfaces. Subsequent layers of water molecules align to
form a quasi-crystalline structure between unit layers which results in an increased
c-spacing. All types of clays swell in this manner.
Osmotic swelling is a second type of swelling. Where the concentration of cations
between unit layers in a clay mineral is higher than the cation concentration in
the surrounding water, water is osmotically drawn between the unit layers and the
c-spacing is increased. Osmotic swelling results in larger overall volume increases
than surface hydration. However, only a few clays, like sodium montmorillonite,
swell in this manner [36].
Clays are naturally occurring layered minerals which are formed by weathering
and decomposition of igneous rocks. Details of clay mineralogy can be found in
monographs [37,38]. Each layer is comprised of fused sheets of octahedra of Al3+,
Mg2+, or Fe3+ oxides and sheets of tetrahedra of Si4+ oxides [39]. If a clay mineral206 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization

is constituted from one tetrahedral and one octahedral sheet, it is addressed as a 1:1
clay. If a clay contains two tetrahedral sheets sandwiching one central octahedral
sheet, it is called referred a 2:1 clay.
Octahedral and tetrahedral layers are illustrated in Figure 3.1.
The metal atoms in the clay lattice can be substituted appropriately which results
in an overall negative charge on individual clay layers.
This charge is compensated for by cations located in the interlayer region. The
latter cations can be freely exchanged. The cation exchange capacity of clay minerals
depends on the crystal size, pH, and the type of the cation. These cations may not only
small sized ions, but even poly cations [40].
Studies on the adsorption of a polycationic quaternary amine polymer on clays
have been presented. In charge scale, it can be observed that both the adsorption curve
of the quaternary amine polymer and that corresponding to the released sodium are
superimposed, as shown in Figure 3.2.
The replacement of the counter ions by the amine polymer almost follows a
1:1 relationship for low polymer concentrations. Further, the silicate surfaces of the
tetrahedral sheets of clay minerals are comparatively hydrophobic. This property may
allow the intercalation of neutral organic compounds including polymers.
Smectite clays are of the type 2:1 and are frequently occurring in drilling
technology [41]. Sodium-saturated smectite swells macroscopically. This swelling
causes the instability of shales in oil well drilling operations. In the worst case, the
wellbore may collapse due to clay swelling.
Exchangeable cations found in clay minerals are reported to have a significant
impact on the amount of swelling that takes place. The exchangeable cations compete
with water molecules for the available reactive sites in the clay structure. Generally,3.1 Properties of clays 207

cations with high valences are more strongly adsorbed than ones with low valences.
Thus, clays with low valence exchangeable cations will swell more than clays whose
exchangeable cations have high valences.
Water-based drilling fluids are generally considered to be more environmentally
acceptable than oil-based or synthetic-based fluids. However, this type of drilling
fluid facilitates clay hydration and swelling. Clay swelling, which occurs in exposed
sedimentary rock formations, can have an adverse impact on drilling operations and
may lead to significantly increased oil well construction costs [41].
For this reason, minimizing clay swelling is an important field of research. In
order to reduce the extent of clay swelling effectively, the mechanism of swelling
needs to be understood. Based on this knowledge, efficient swelling inhibitors may
be developed.
Suitable clay swelling inhibitors must both significantly reduce the hydration of
the clay, and must meet the increasingly stringent environmental guidelines.
It takes place in a discrete fashion, namely in the stepwise formation of integer￾layer hydrates. The transitions of the distances of the layers are thermodynamically
analogous to phase transitions. Electro-osmotic swelling can occur only in clay
minerals that contain exchangeable cations in the interlayer region. This type of
swelling may yield significantly larger expansion than crystalline swelling.
Sodium-saturated smectites have a strong tendency toward electro-osmotic
swelling. In contrast, potassium-saturated smectites do not swell in such a manner.208 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization
Thus allowing an appropriate ion exchange reaction can be helpful in clay
stabilization [41].
The water desorption isotherms of montmorillonite intercalated with exchange￾able cations of the alkali metal group showed that for larger cations, less water is
adsorbed [42]. In addition, there is a relationship with the tendency to swell and the
energy of hydration of the cation [43].
Clay swelling during the drilling of a subterranean well can have a tremendous
adverse impact on drilling operations. The overall increase in bulk volume accompa￾nying clay swelling impedes removal of cuttings from beneath the drill bit, increases
friction between the drill string and the sides of the borehole, and inhibits formation
of the thin filter cake that seals formations. Clay swelling can also create other
drilling problems such as loss of circulation or stuck pipe that slows down drilling
and increases the drilling costs [44].
In the North Sea and the United States Gulf Coast, drillers commonly encounter
argillaceous sediments in which the predominant clay mineral is sodium mont￾morillonite, commonly called gumbo clay. Sodium cations are predominately the
exchangeable cations in gumbo clay. Because the sodium cation has a low positive
valence, that is, a +1 valence, it easily disperses into water.
Consequently, gumbo clay is notorious for its swelling. Thus, given the frequency
in which gumbo clay is encountered in drilling subterranean wells, the development
of a substance and method for reducing clay swelling is of primary importance in the
drilling industry [45].
3.1.2 MONTMORILLONITE
Montmorillonite clays, for example, Bentonite and Kaolinite clays are also suitable
for preparing a solids-stabilized oil-in-water emulsion. Bentonite clay can be easily
exfoliated [46]. As mined, bentonite clays naturally consist of aggregates of particles
that can be dispersed in water and broken up by shearing into units having average
particle sizes of 2 μm or less. However, each of these particles is a laminated unit
containing approximately 100 layers of fundamental silicate layers of 1 nm thickness
bonded together by inclusions of atoms such as calcium in the layers.
By exchanging the atoms such as calcium by sodium or lithium, which are larger
and have strong attractions for water molecules in fresh water, and then exposing
the bentonite to fresh water, the bentonite can be broken into individual 1 nm thick
layers, called fundamental particles. The result of this delamination process is a gel
consisting of a finely divided bentonite clay [46].
3.1.3 GUIDELINES
The literature offers several papers that may serve as guidelines for issues such as
selecting a proper clay stabilizing system or completing wellbore stability analysis
of practical well designs [47–52].3.2 Mechanisms causing instability 209
3.2 MECHANISMS CAUSING INSTABILITY
Shale stability is an important problem faced during drilling. Stability problems
are attributed most often to the swelling of shales. It has been shown that several
mechanisms can be involved [53,54]. These can be pore pressure diffusion,
plasticity, anisotropy, capillary effects, osmosis, and physicochemical alterations.
Most important, three processes contributing to the instability of shales have to be
considered [55]:
1. movement of fluid between the wellbore and the shale (limited to flow from the
wellbore into the shale),
2. changes in stress (and strain) that occur during shale-filtrate interaction, and
3. softening and erosion caused by invasion of mud filtrate and consequent
chemical changes in the shale.
The major reason for these effects is due to chemical nature, namely the hydration
of clays. Borehole instabilities were observed even with the most inhibitive fluids,
that is oil-based drilling mud. This demonstrates that the mechanical aspect is also
important. In fact, the coupling of both chemical and mechanical mechanisms has to
be considered. For this reason, it is still difficult to predict the behavior of rock at
medium-to-great depth under certain loading conditions.
The stability of shales is governed by a complicated relationship between trans￾port processes in shales (e.g., hydraulic flow, osmosis, diffusion of ions, pressure) and
chemical changes (e.g., ion exchange, alteration of water content, swelling pressure).
Clays or shales have the ability to absorb water, thus causing the instability
of wells either because of the swelling of some mineral species or because the
supporting pressure is suppressed by modification of the pore pressure. The response
of a shale to a water-based fluid depends on its initial water activity and on the
composition of the fluid.
The behavior of shales can be classified into either deformation mechanisms or
transport mechanisms [56]. Optimization of mud salinity, density, and filter cake
properties is important in achieving optimal shale stability and drilling efficiency
with water-based drilling mud (WBM).
3.2.1 KINETICS OF SWELLING OF CLAYS
Basic studies on the kinetics of swelling have been performed [57]. Pure clays
(montmorillonite, illite, and kaolinite) with polymeric inhibitors were investigated,
and phenomenologic kinetic laws were established.
3.2.2 HYDRATIONAL STRESS
Stresses caused by chemical forces, such as hydration stress, can have a considerable
influence on the stability of a wellbore [58]. When the total pressure and the chemical
potential of water increase, water is absorbed into the clay platelets.210 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization
This results either in the platelets moving farther apart (swelling) if they are
free to move or in generation of hydrational stress if swelling is constrained [59].
Hydrational stress results in an increase in pore pressure and a subsequent reduction
in effective mud support, which leads to a less stable wellbore condition.
3.2.3 BOREHOLE STABILITY MODEL
A borehole stability model has been developed that takes into account both the
mechanical and the chemical aspects of interactions between drilling fluid and
shale [60]. Chemically induced stress alteration based on the thermodynamics of
differences in water molar free energies of the drilling fluid and shale is combined
with mechanically induced stress. Based on this model, it should be possible to obtain
the optimal mud weight and salt concentration for drilling fluids.
Further stability models based on surface area, equilibrium water-content￾pressure relationships, and electric double-layer theory can successfully characterize
borehole stability problems [61]. The application of surface area, swelling pressure,
and water requirements of solids can be integrated into swelling models and mud
process control approaches to improve the design of WBM in active or older shales.
3.2.4 SHALE INHIBITION WITH WATER-BASED MUDS
One potential mechanism by which polymers may stabilize shales is by reducing
the rate of water invasion into the shale. The control of water invasion is not the
only mechanism involved in shale stabilization [62]. There is also an effect of
the polymer additive. Osmotic phenomena are responsible for water transport rates
through shales.
A copolymer of acrylamide derivates and cationic comonomers, such as diallyl
dimethyl ammonium chloride (DADMAC) or diallyldiethylammonium chloride can
be used for shale stabilization [63]. Such copolymers are added to an aqueous based
wellbore fluid in order to reduce permeability damage in a formation.
Discrete portions of the cationic comonomer along the copolymer backbone
may render the copolymer biodegradable by microbes under aerobic conditions.
In contrast, homopolymers of DADMAC have not been found to be as readily
biodegradable under similar conditions [63].
3.2.5 INHIBITING REACTIVE ARGILLACEOUS FORMATIONS
Argillaceous formations are very reactive in the presence of water. Such forma￾tions can be stabilized by bringing them in contact with a polymer solution with
hydrophilic and hydrophobic links [64–67]. The hydrophilic portion consists of
poly(oxyethylene), with hydrophobic end groups based on isocyanates. The polymer
is capable of inhibiting the swelling or dispersion of the argillaceous rock resulting
from its adsorptive and hydrophobic capacities.3.3 Inhibitors of swelling 211
3.2.6 THERMAL TREATMENT TO INCREASE THE PERMEABILITY
To increase the permeability of a certain region of the reservoir, the liquid-absorbed
water is evaporated by heating the portion to a temperature above the boiling point
of water, taking into account the ambient pressure [68,69]. The liquid water is
evaporated by injecting a water-undersaturated gas, such as heated nitrogen, into the
reservoir.
3.2.7 FORMATION DAMAGE BY FLUIDS
Formation damage due to invasion by drilling fluids is a well known problem in
drilling. Invasion of drilling fluids into the formation is caused by the differential
pressure of the hydrostatic column which is generally greater than the formation
pressure, especially in low-pressure or depleted zones [70].
Invasion is also caused by openings in the rock and the ability of fluids to move
through the rock. When drilling depleted sands under overbalanced conditions, the
mud will penetrate progressively into the formation unless there is an effective flow
barrier present at the wellbore wall.
Horizontal drilling may also drill across highly fractured or permeable, low￾pressure or depleted zones, which increases the probability of the drill pipe getting
stuck due to lying on the low side of the borehole. The exposure of numerous
fractures or openings having low formation pressures has increased the problems
of lost circulation and formation invasion [70].
3.2.8 FORMATION DAMAGE IN GAS PRODUCTION SHUT-IN
Sometimes it may become necessary to shut-in a gas well when the demand for gas
is low. In such instances, the well is shut-in for an indefinite period, after which it is
reopened and production is resumed. It often has been found that the production rate
of gas from the reopened well is substantially less than it was before the well was
shut-in. During production, the inner wall of the production tubing will be coated
with a film of condensed fresh water because of the geothermal gradient.
This water flows down when production is interrupted and can cause formation
damage. This may occur, because clays are normally saturated with brine water and
not with fresh water. This swelling can be prevented with the injection of some
additive, for example, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, or an
alcohol or a similar organic material [71].
3.3 INHIBITORS OF SWELLING
Inhibitors of swelling act in a chemical manner rather than in a mechanical manner.
They change the ionic strength and the transport behavior of the fluids into the clays.
Both the cations and the anions are important for the efficiency of the inhibition of
swelling of clays [72].212 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization
3.4 INHIBITORS IN DETAIL
3.4.1 SALTS
Swelling can be inhibited by the addition of KCl. Relatively high levels are required.
Other swelling inhibitors are both uncharged polymers and poly(electrolyte)s [41].
3.4.2 QUATERNARY AMMONIUM SALTS
Choline salts are effective anti-swelling drilling fluid additives for underbalanced
drilling operations [73]. Choline is addressed as a quaternary ammonium salt
containing the N,N,N-trimethylethanolammonium cation. An example of choline
halide counterion salts is choline chloride.
Preparation 3–1: Triethanolamine methyl chloride can be prepared by adding to
triethanolamine in aqueous solution methyl chloride in excess and heating for several
hours. Upon completion of the reaction, the excess of methyl chloride is evaporated.
Choline formate is prepared from an aqueous solution of choline hydroxide by the
reaction with formic acid simply by stirring.
Argillaceous formations contain clay particles. If a water-based drilling fluid is
used in such formations, ion exchange, hydration, etc. will take place. These reactions
cause swelling, crumbling, or dispersion of the clay particles. Ultimately, washout
and even complete collapse of the borehole may occur [74].
Certain additives may prevent these unfavorable reactions. These additives are
essentially quaternized polymers.
Such polymers have been shown in laboratory testing to vastly reduce shale
erosion.
Quaternized polymers can synthesized by [74]:
1. quaternization of an AA based amine derivative with an alkyl halide, and
subsequent polymerization, or
2. first polymerization and afterwards quaternization of the polymeric moieties.
Preparation 3–2: A quaternized monomer can be prepared by mixing dimethyl amino
ethyl methacrylate with hexadecyl bromide. The mixture is heated to 43 ◦C and stirred for
24 h. Then, the mixture is poured into petroleum ether, whereby the quaternized monomer
precipitates [74]. The reaction is shown in Figure 3.3.
A copolymer can be prepared using the quaternized monomer, described
above and the dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate as such. The aqueous solution
is neutralized with sulfuric acid and radically polymerized with 2,2
-azobis(2-
amidinopropane)dihydrochloride, c.f. Figure 3.4. This initiator is water soluble.
The polymerization is carried out at 43 ◦C for 18 h [74].3.4 Inhibitors in detail 213

The quaternization of a polymer from dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate has
been described. To an aqueous solution of a homopolymer from dimethyl amino
ethyl methacrylate sodium hydrochloride is added to adjust the pH to 8.9. Then
again some water is added and hexadecyl bromide as alkylation agent, further
benzylcetyldimethyl ammonium bromide as emulsifier. This mixture is then heated,
with stirring, to 60 ◦C for 24 h [74].214 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization
3.4.3 POTASSIUM FORMATE
Clay is stabilized in drilling and treatment operations by the addition of potassium
formate to the drilling fluid. Further, a cationic formation control additive is added.
Potassium formate can be generated in situ from potassium hydroxide and formic
acid. The cationic additive is basically, a polymer containing quaternized amine
units, for example, polymers of dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride or acrylamide
(AAm) [75].
In the clay pack flow test, where the higher volumes at a given time indicate
better clay stability, the addition of a small amount of potassium formate increases
the volume throughput for a given polymer concentration. For example, 0.1%
poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride) added to the formulation had a volume
at 10 min of 112 ml.
The same polymer, when combined with potassium formate and treated at 0.05%
of the polymer, that is, half the original polymer concentration, had a volume of
146 ml, indicating better clay stability and a possible synergistic effect from the
addition of the potassium formate [75].
3.4.4 SACCHARIDE DERIVATIVES
A drilling fluid additive, which acts as a clay stabilizer, is the reaction product
of methyl glucoside and alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide (EO), propylene
oxide (PO), or 1,2-butylene oxide. Such an additive is soluble in water at ambient
conditions, but becomes insoluble at elevated temperatures [76]. Because of their
insolubility at elevated temperatures, these compounds concentrate at important
surfaces such as the drill bit cutting surface, the borehole surface, and the surfaces of
the drilled cuttings.
3.4.5 SULFONATED ASPHALT
Asphalt is a solid, black-brown to black bitumen fraction, which softens when heated
and re-hardens upon cooling. Asphalt is not water soluble and difficult to disperse or
emulsify in water.
Sulfonated asphalt can be obtained by reacting asphalt with sulfuric acid and
sulfur trioxide. By neutralization with alkali hydroxides, such as NaOH or NH3,
sulfonate salts are formed. Only a limited portion of the sulfonated product can be
extracted with hot water. However, the fraction thus obtained, which is water soluble,
is crucial for the quality.
Sulfonated asphalt is predominantly utilized for water-based drilling fluids but
also for those based on oil [77]. Apart from reduced filtrate loss and improved filter
cake properties, good lubrication of the drill bit and decreased formation damage are
important features assigned to sulfonated asphalt as a drilling fluid additive [77].
In particular, clay inhibition is enhanced by sulfonated asphalt in the case of
water-based drilling fluids. If swellable clays are not inhibited, undesirable water3.4 Inhibitors in detail 215
absorption and swelling of the clay occurs, which can cause serious technical
problems including the instability of the borehole, or even a stuck pipe.
The mechanism of action of sulfonated asphalt as a clay inhibitor in a drilling
fluid, is explained that the electronegative sulfonated macromolecules attach to the
electropositive ends of the clay platelets. Thereby, a neutralization barrier is created,
which suppresses the absorption of water into the clay.
In addition, because the sulfonated asphalt is partially lipophilic, and therefore
water repellent, the water influx into the clay is restricted by purely physical
principles. As mentioned already, the solubility in water of the sulfonated asphalt is
crucial for proper application. By the introduction of a water-soluble and an anionic
polymer component, the proportion of water-insoluble asphalt can be markedly
reduced.
In other words, the proportion of the water-soluble fraction is increased by in￾troducing the polymer component. Especially suitable are lignosulfonates as well as
sulfonated phenol, ketone, naphthalene, acetone, and amino plasticizing resins [77].
3.4.6 GRAFTED COPOLYMERS
The clay stabilization of copolymers of styrene and MA grafted with poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) have been investigated [78].
The amounts of shale recovery from bottle rolling tests have been used to
measure the shale inhibition properties. The tests were done using Oxford Clay
cuttings, a water sensitive shale, sieved to 2-4 mm. The swelling is performed in
7.6% aqueous KCl.
The grafted copolymer used is an alternating copolymer of styrene and MA. The
polymer is grafted with PEG with different molecular weights. The amount of shale
recovery with various PEG types is shown in Table 3.2.
It seems that there is an optimum, with respect to the molecular weight of the
grafted PEG. Further, the results in the lower part of Table 3.2 indicate that increasing
the amount of styrene in the backbone increases also the amount of shale recovered.
3.4.7 POLY(OXYALKYLENE AMINE)S
One method to reduce clay swelling is to use salts in drilling fluids. Salts generally
reduce the swelling of clays. However, salts flocculate the clays resulting in both high
fluid losses and an almost complete loss of thixotropy. Further, increasing the salinity
often decreases the functional characteristics of drilling fluid additives [36].
Another method for controlling clay swelling is to use organic shale inhibitor
molecules in drilling fluids. It is believed that the organic shale inhibitor molecules
are adsorbed on the surfaces of clays with the added organic shale inhibitor
competing with water molecules for clay reactive sites and thus serve to reduce clay
swelling.216 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization

Poly(oxyalkylene amine)s are a general class of compounds that contain primary
amino groups attached to a poly(ether) backbone. They are also addressed as
poly(ether amine)s. They are available in a variety of molecular weights, ranging
up to 5 kDa.
Poly(oxyalkylenediamine)s have been proposed as shale inhibitors. These are
synthesized from the ring opening polymerization of oxirane compounds in the
presence of amino compounds. Such compounds have been synthesized by reacting
were made by reacting Jeffamine with 2 equivalents of EO. Alternatively, PO is
reacted with an oxyalkyldiamine [36]. The poly(ether) backbone is based either on
EO, or PO, or a mixture of these oxirane compounds [36].
A typical poly(ether amine) is shown in Figure 3.5. Such products belong to the
Jeffamine® product family.
A related shale hydration inhibition agent is based on an N-alkylated 2,2
-diamino
ethylether.
3.4.8 POLYMERS
Styrene-acrylic-based liquid polymer
The application of a low viscosity liquid polymer for shallow soil improvement
has been tested [79]. The liquid polymer is a styrene acrylic copolymer that is
commercially available as Rovene 6126. The mixing method of soil specimens3.4 Inhibitors in detail 217

treated with this polymer was studied. The tested soils included poorly graded sand
and sulfate-rich clay.
The water, liquid polymer, and dry soil were mixed with different sequences to
assess the effect on the strength. The specimens were cured in controlled environment
for up to 35 days before being tested. It was found that the curing of the polymer
stabilizer in sand and clay was time-consuming and took up to a month to reach their
full strength.
The mixing method did not show a tangible difference for stabilized sandy
specimens and demonstrated a significant effect on the stabilized clay specimen. With
regard to the clay, when water was added after the soil and the polymer dried were
thoroughly, no improvement was observed [79].
Poly(vinyl alcohol) and 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid
The influence of two chemical additives, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and 1,2,3,4-
butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA), on the engineering properties of an expansive
clay soil was investigated [80].
The effect of polymers on the unconfined compression strength of soil samples
prepared at maximum dry unit weight (16.2 kN m−3 and 17% water content) and
a lower dry unit weight (10.8 kN m−3 and 48% water content) was evaluated. PVA
and BTCA were added at dosages of 0.1-1.5% and 0.1-0.5%, respectively, to both
compacted soil samples and cured for 1 and 14 days, respectively.
The results of unconfined compression tests (UCTs) on clay soil samples stabi￾lized with different PVA and BTCA contents cured for 1 and 14 days, respectively,
indicated that such hydrophilic polymers are improving the compression strength of
both dense and soft clay soils significantly, and their strength even increases with
curing time. However, the efficiency of the additives is highly dependent on the unit
weight of the soil. Furthermore, the durability of stabilized samples was examined
using soaking tests. The results revealed that these polymers improve the durability
of clay soils once they are soaked under water [80].218 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization

Short fibers and poly(vinyl alcohol) and 1,2,3,4 butanetetracarboxylic
acid
The effect of the combined addition of fibers and a nontraditional polymer on the
mechanical behavior of a clay was investigated [81]. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was
used as a solution with concentrations from 0.1% to 1.5% and BTCA (cf. Figure 3.6)
was added as a crosslinking agent in concentrations from 0.1% to 0.5%. Short
poly(propylene) fibers were added to the clay at proportionate quantities of 0.25%
and 0.50% of the dry weight of the soil.
The clay samples were prepared for unconfined compressive strength tests at two
different initial void ratio values, denoting relatively stiff and markedly soft states.
Unconfined compressive strength tests were conducted on both 1- and 14-day cured
samples.
In optimal cases, the addition of 1.5% PVA, cured for 1 day, increased the
unconfined compressive strength of the soft clay from 6.1 kPa (for an unstabilized
sample) to 44.1 kPa (i.e., more than a sevenfold increase). With 14 days of curing, the
unconfined compressive strength of the stabilized soil further increased to 52.3 kPa
(i.e., more than an eightfold increase compared to the unstabilized sample). The
addition of 1.5% PVA increased the strain energy of the unstabilized clay from 0.8 to
3.2 kJ m−3 and 4.2 kJ m−3 at 1- and 14-day curing periods, respectively. Therefore,
1.5% PVA was found to be optimal for improving the mechanical behavior of the soft
clay. Therefore, these results confirmed significant unconfined compressive strength3.4 Inhibitors in detail 219

improvements with combined fiber reinforcement and PVA-BTCA stabilization
when samples were cured for 14 days [81].
It was also observed that the fiber reinforcement performed PVA-BTCA stabiliza￾tion for clays with the lower initial void ratio. However, the PVA-BTCA stabilization
was found to be superior to fiber reinforcement in clays with a relatively higher initial
void ratio. The effect of fiber reinforcement and PVA-BTCA stabilization on the
stability of soils subjected to excessive wetting was also evaluated using soaking
tests. Stabilization with PVA and BTCA was found to enhance the stability of soaked
samples significantly. The results of soaking tests proved that BTCA made PVA￾stabilized samples more durable when exposed to soaking [81].
Functionalized amine polysaccharides
The synthesis of polysaccharide derivatives for the stabilization of clays has been
reported [82].
Polymers such as dextran and other polysaccharides are highly water-soluble
molecules with structures that do not change under extremes of temperature and
pH. Unlike potassium chloride, there are typically no or minimal issues associated
with crystallization of the polymer when used at the low temperatures that exist
when working in cold climates. Polymers such as polysaccharides and functionalized
polysaccharides and their derivatives are environmentally safe, nonhazardous to work
with, and generally biocompatible. Some amino-modified polysaccharides are shown
in Figure 3.7.
The synthesis of several other related substances has been described as fol￾lows [82]:
1. Diethylethanolamine dextran was obtained by reacting dextran with
2-chloro-N,N-diethylamine in the presence of caustic and water at an elevated
temperature.
2. Hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride dextran was obtained by reacting
dextran with glycidyltrimethyl ammonium chloride in the presence of caustic
and water at an elevated temperature.
3. Ethylamine dextran was obtained by reacting dextran with 2-chloroethylamine
in the presence of caustic and water at an elevated temperature.
4. Amino levan was obtained by reacting levan with sodium periodate in water at
room temperature followed by ethylene diamine addition in water at room220 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization
temperature, finally followed by the reduction of the formed imine with sodium
borohydride in water at room temperature.
5. Amino guar was obtained by reacting guar with sodium periodate in water at
room temperature followed by ethylene diamine addition in water at room
temperature, finally step followed by reduction of formed imine with sodium
borohydride in water at room temperature.
Dextran and other polysaccharide molecules are biodegradable and pose little to
no negative impact to plants, animals, and other organisms or populations, or on the
environment in general, even when used in high concentrations.
Polysaccharide derivatives that are useful as functionalized polymers degrade
simply and rapidly in the environment into harmless components. These compounds
are easily transportable, requiring no special handling as hazardous materials would,
and thus are readily available directly at the site of use. This ready-to-use availability
eliminates time otherwise required for premixing as well as disposal costs such as
those associated with saltwater disposal. Additional substances that can be included
with the functionalized polymer compositions include surfactants, defoaming agents,
detergents, chelators, and buffers.
These polymers are effective in reducing or preventing soil swelling such as of
clay and other materials commonly associated in mining and drilling operations [82].
3.4.9 CATIONIC POLYMERS
Multiple charged cationic compounds, which are derived from polyamines, can
be used for clay stabilization in oil and gas operations [83]. These compounds
are obtained through an aza-Michael addition with an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl
compound.
The Michael reaction (or Michael addition) is the nucleophilic addition of a
carbanion or another nucleophile to an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compound [84].
It belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions. This is one of the most useful
methods for the mild formation of C−C bonds The terms “oxa-Michael reaction”
and “aza-Michael reaction” have been used to refer to the 1,4-addition of oxygen and
nitrogen nucleophiles, respectively.
The polyamine can be an ethoxylated polyamine, propylated polyamine, a
polyamine with polyglycerol, or poly(ethyleneimine) [83]. In addition, the polyamine
can be a branched polyethyleneimine and 3-acrylamidopropyl)trimethylammonium
chloride, or a mixture derived from a linear polyethyleneimine and
(3-[methacryloylamino]propyl)trimethyl ammonium chloride. Possible α, β￾unsaturated carbonyl compounds are collected in Table 3.3.
An aliphatic amine group may undergo an aza-Michael addition reaction when in
contact with an unsaturated hydrocarbon moiety.
The clay treatment composition may further contain an acid from about 1% to
20%, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, acetic
acid, or a mixture thereof.3.4 Inhibitors in detail 221

Furthermore, the clay treatment composition may contain an alkyl phenol, fatty
acid, a surfactant, a corrosion inhibitor, and a biocide. Biocides are collected in
Table 3.4.
Cationic acrylamide polymer
A short-chain cationic polymer, P(A-β-CD/AM/ATMAC), was synthesized via
free radical-initiated aqueous system copolymerization of acrylamide (AM), allyl
trimethyl ammonium chloride (ATMAC), and allyl-β-cyclodextrin (A-β-CD) [85].
The optimum conditions of the copolymerization process are obtained by single￾factor experiment: the reaction temperature was 40 ◦C, the reaction time was 3 h, the
initiator dosage was 0.15%, the chain transfer dosage was 0.20%, the total monomer
concentration was 25.0%, the monomer molar ratio (AM:A-β-CD:ATMAC) was
65:5:30, and the antiswelling rate of the polymer can reach 95.2%. The cationic
β-cyclodextrin polymer was structurally characterized using FTIR and 1H NMR.
The weight-average molecular weight of P(A-β-CD/AM/ATMAC) is (1.96 ± 0.05)
×104 g mol−1, which was measured using static laser light scattering.
The P(A-β-CD/AM/ATMAC) can not only effectively avoid plugging and reser￾voir damage in the reservoir with an ultra-low permeability but also enhance the
flushing resistance, temperature tolerance, and the capability of inhibiting particle
dispersion [85].
Biopolymer-based cationic surfactant
Methods for stabilizing swellable clays in a subterranean formation and methods of
reducing the formation of sludge in a subterranean formation have been described.
Here, a biopolymer based cationic surfactant is used. The biopolymer-based
cationic surfactant includes a quaternary ammonium compound having an alkyl
polyglucoside backbone and amino alcohol side chains [86].
The use of the biopolymer-based cationic surfactant minimizes or prevents
the precipitation of sludge, such as asphaltenes, maltenes, or similar asphaltic
components, during an acidizing treatment. The biopolymer-based cationic surfactant
can be added to an aqueous acidic solution before injecting the solution into a well
or formation for treatment [86].
Because the biopolymer is a surfactant, it can also be used as an emulsifier or
de-emulsifier.222 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization

Cationic polymers with imidazolium groups
Although a number of clay inhibitors are known in the field of petroleum science,
there is still a need for improvements in particular with respect to permanent clay
inhibition [87]. Many inhibitors have only a temporary effect. Once the clay is
no longer in contact with the solution comprising the inhibitors, the effect of the
inhibitors decreases. Thus, there is a need for improved inhibitors having a permanent
effect, i.e., the effect of the inhibitors should be maintained for a long time even if
the clays are no longer in contact with solution comprising inhibitors.
A method of inhibiting the swelling of clay in subterranean formations has
been found, which comprises introducing a carrier fluid that contains at least one
clay inhibitor into the formation. One of the clay inhibitors is a cationic polymer
with repeating units selected from imidazolium groups. A special example of such
polymers is a polyimidazolium acetate based on 1,6-hexamethylenediamine [87].
The cationic polymers with imidazolium groups may be also combined with
chemically different clay inhibitors [87].
3.4.10 ANIONIC POLYMERS
Anionic polymers may be active as the long chain with negative ions attaches to the
positive sites on the clay particles or to the hydrated clay surface through hydrogen
bonding [16]. Surface hydration is reduced as the polymer coats the surface of
the clay.
The protective coating also seals, or restricts the surface fractures or pores,
thereby reducing or preventing the capillary movement of filtrate into the shale. This
stabilizing process is supplemented by PAC. Potassium chloride enhances the rate of
polymer absorption onto the clay.
3.4.11 AMINE SALTS OF MALEIC IMIDE
Compositions containing amine salts of imides of MA polymers are useful for clay
stabilization. These types of salts are formed, for example, by the reaction of MA
with a diamine such as dimethyl aminopropylamine, in ethylene glycol (EG) solution
[88]. The primary nitrogen dimethyl aminopropylamine forms the imide bond.
In addition, it may add to the double bond of MA. Further, the EG may add to
the double bond, but also may condense with the anhydride itself. On repetition of
these reactions, oligomeric compounds may be formed. The elementary reactions are
shown in Figure 3.8.
Finally, the product is neutralized with acetic acid or methane sulfonic acid
to a pH of 4. The performance was tested in Bandera sandstone. The material
neutralized with methane sulfonic acid is somewhat less then that neutralized with
acetic acid. The compositions are particularly suitable for water-based hydraulic
fracturing fluids.224 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization

Environmentally friendly clay stabilizer
Clay stabilizers are used to prevent fines migration and clay swelling, which are
caused by the contact of clays with low salinity or high pH fluids. Previously
used clay stabilizers, including hydroxy-aluminum, zirconium oxychloride solutions,
and cationic polymers have several drawbacks. Hydroxy-aluminum and zirconium
oxychloride solutions can be leached by acids [89].
Cationic organic polymers can cause formation damage in some cases [90]. Their
environmental impact is also questionable [91].
Laboratory studies were conducted using a new inorganic aluminum/zirconium￾based compound. Coreflood experiments were conducted on Berea sandstone cores
with 1.5 in. in diameter, 6 in. and 20 in. in length in order to assess the effectiveness
of the compound at high temperatures and to determine the impact of acids on its
performance. Inductively coupled plasma was used to measure the concentrations of
aluminum and zirconium in the coreflood effluent samples [92].
The clay stabilizer under investigation was found to be very effective in mitigating
the migration of fines. Unlike conventional aluminum/zirconium-based compounds,
the new stabilizer was effective even after using several 15% HCl acid washes. In
addition, it did not cause formation damage, and worked very well up to 150 ◦C. It is
nontoxic, with no smell, and environmentally friendly [92].
3.4.12 INORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Waste paper sludge ash
An experimental study on the sandy clay soil stabilized using waste paper sludge ash
and cement has been presented [93]. A slightly sandy clay of medium plasticity of
clay soil sample has been used in this study.
The optimum concentration percentage of waste paper sludge ash and cement
as additives based on the compressive strength has been investigated [93]. Also,
the improvement of the strength of a clay soil that was stabilized with an optimum
percentage of waste paper sludge ash and cement was investigated. Further this was
used to assess the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value of a clay stabilized with an
optimum percentage of waste paper sludge ash and cement.
The results of this study show that the optimum concentrations of waste
paper sludge ash and cement to stabilize the sandy clay soil about 10% and 5%,
respectively, to give the maximum compressive strength of 177 kN m−2 from
155 kN m−2 [93].
Gypsum and paddy husk ash
Clays that have low shear strength need to be stabilized in order to meet the technical
requirements to serve as a subgrade material. One of the usual soil stabilization
methods is by adding chemicals such as Portland cement, lime, and bitumen [94].
In a study, clay stabilization was done by adding gypsum and paddy husk ash.
Attempts were made to identify the value of engineering properties of the clay
due to the addition of 2% gypsum and 2-15% of paddy husk ash. The soil was226 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization
classified as clay-low plasticity (CL) based on the unified soil classification system
(USCS) and was classified as A-7-6(10) based on the AASHTO classification system
[94]. The AASHTO Soil Classification System was developed by the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, and is used as a guide
for the classification of soils and soil-aggregate mixtures for highway construction
purposes [95,96].
The UCT value of original soil was 1.41 kg cm−2, while the CBR soaked and
unsoaked values of original soil were 4.41% and 6.23%, respectively [94].
The results of the study showed that the addition of paddy husk ash decreased the
value of unconfined compressive strength as well as CBR. The stabilized soil by 2%
gypsum and 0% paddy husk ash gave a maximum UCT value of 1.67 kg cm−2, while
the maximum values of CBR were found to be 6.71% for CBR soaked and 8.00% for
CBR unsoaked. The addition of paddy husk ash did not alter the soil classification
according to AASHTO or USCS, and even degraded the engineering properties of
the original soil [94].
Ash of Mount Sinabung
Most areas in Indonesia consist of clay soils with a high plasticity, meaning that
to meet technical requirements the soil needs improvement, which is known as soil
stabilization [97]. There are three types of soil stabilization process: mechanical,
physical, and chemical.
In a study, chemical stabilization was performed by adding stabilizing agents to
the soil [97]. The stabilizing agent used was the ash of Mount Sinabung. From 2010
until now, Sinabung Mountain has been experiencing eruption that produces a lot of
volcanic ash, and this has a negative effect on the environment.
The effect of the addition of Mount Sinabung ash to CBR value was investigated,
to determine the effect of the curing time of 1- and 14-day mixtures on the CBR
value, and to find the mixed content with effective curing time to produce the largest
CBR value [97]. Based on this study, the soil type CL was obtained, based on the
classification of USCS and categorized as A-6 (6) based on the classification of
American Association of State Highway and Transportation officials (AASHTO)
with the most effective mixed stabilizer material, which was the variation of 10%
Mount Sinabung ash with 14 days of curing time.
The CBR value resulting from the mixture of 10% Sinabung ash that was cured
within 14 days was 8.95%. By the increase of the content of the Sinabung ash, the
CBR value always improved to the level of 10%, Sinabung ash then decreased and
became constant at the mixture of higher volcanic ash mixture, but remained above
the CBR value of the original soil [97].
Waste limestone from marble industries
Chemical stabilization on clay soils was performed using waste limestone powder
from the marble industry and acrylic acid [98].
The characteristics of waste marble were assessed, to analyze the clay strength
before and after being stabilized with waste marble powder, to analyze the effect3.4 Inhibitors in detail 227
of acrylic acid as an activator in clay stabilization using waste marble, and finally to
study the microstructure of soil stabilized by marble powder and acrylic acid solution.
Laboratory tests were performed by mixing the marble powder with an amount
of clay of 5-30% and the addition of an acrylic acid solution with as much as 5-15%
of water mixed [98].
A clay mixture with 20-30% of marble powder increased the CBR value to
more than 6%. The addition of an acrylic acid solution with an optimum content
of marble powder with 3 and 7 day curing increased the value of the UCS to medium
consistency. Marble powder contains dominantly CaO with 97.15%, which is an
effective material for clay soil stabilization [98].
The results of this study showed that the mixture of clay with marble powder and
acrylic acid as stabilization agents could increase the soil bearing capacity for a road
subgrade layer [98].
Blast furnace slag
Soft clay is associated with a soft consistency and poor shear strength. A high
percentage of fines lead to a higher liquid limit and to a lower plasticity index [99].
A low bearing capacity and an excessive settlement lead to uneconomic engineering
structure constructed over soft clay. There is a serious need to mitigate this problem.
Soil stabilization is thus an urgent need.
In a study, granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), which is an industrial waste/by￾product of the steel industry, has been used as a stabilizer to improve the geotechnical
property of soft clay [99]. The soft clay is replaced by a granulated blast furnace slag
in various percentages from 10% to 50% and examined for its plasticity, compaction,
and strength properties.
The Atterberg limits are a basic measure of the critical water contents of a fine￾grained soil: its shrinkage limit, plastic limit, and liquid limit [100].
The Atterberg limits and specific gravity of soft clay and granulated blast furnace
slag mixture are shown in Table 3.5.

It can be seen from Table 3.5 that there is a decrease in both liquid limit and plastic
limit with the increased percentage of granulated blast furnace slag replacing the
soft clay. The plasticity index decreases with the addition of slag to soft clay, which
proves that the soil is improved after addition. A possible reason behind the reduction
in plasticity index is due to the incorporation of coarser material, which decreases the
specific surface area. The decrease in the specific gravity of the mixture is due to the
addition of lower specific gravity of granulated blast furnace slag compared to the
soft clay.
Therefore, it could be shown that the plasticity index decreases and the uncon￾fined compressive strength increases upon the addition of the slag to the soil. With
the curing age, the unconfined compressive strength value increased, indicating a
chemical reaction between free lime and soil.
A 40% slag replacement of the soft clay is recommended as stabilizer as this
replacement gave a maximum increase in the unconfined compressive strength value
compared to the original composition. It could be concluded that the granulated blast
furnace slag can be used as a potential stabilizer for soft clay and also largely solves
the problem of disposal of this slag [99].
3.4.13 COMPARATIVE STUDY
Three different clay inhibitors, a Performatrol® drilling fluid, a Claygrabber®
shale stabilizer, and a Clay Sync® shale stabilizer were compared to 4% glycol,
a standard clay inhibitor, for their ability to inhibit the uptake of water by shale
cuttings [101].
Clay Sync is a low molecular weight nonionic poly(acrylamide) (PAM), Clay￾grabber Clay Sync is a high molecular weight nonionic PAM and Performatrol is
poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone), a water-soluble polymer, all commercially available
from Baroid Fluid Services.
For each clay inhibitor, two types of shale cuttings were used. Each cutting was
then placed in a 350 ml solution containing water and the indicated clay inhibitor for
4 h at 27 ◦C.
The concentration of clay inhibitor used is 0.5% Claygrabber, 2 pounds per barrel
Clay Sync, and 14 pounds per barrel Performatrol. The swelling S in Eq. 3.1 is the
relative increase of the volume before Vb and after treatment Va.
S = 100
Va − Vb

. (3.1)
Data of swelling are for the different clay stabilizers are shown in Table 3.6.
The results demonstrate that the addition of either KCl or NaCl to solutions of
clay inhibitors improves the ability of the clay inhibitors to reduce the absorption of
aqueous fluid by shale [101].3.5 Test methods 229

3.5 TEST METHODS
3.5.1 SHALE EROSION TEST
A shale erosion test is commonly employed to determine the ability of a drilling fluid
with additives therein to prevent a shale from eroding in the presence of an aqueous
medium such as an aqueous based drilling fluid [74].
Such erosion, when encountered in actual field conditions in a borehole, and as
noted above, can lead to problems ranging from a washout to a complete collapse of
the borehole. Various shale erosion test have been developed based on [74,102]:
• time of total disintegration of the particles, and
• the change of particle size during rolling.230 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization
Disintegration of particles
A shale erosion test has been developed that consists of compressing a known
unstable oilfield shale into a 0.5 in. diameter by 1 in. Then the cylinder is placed
into a capped round pint jar, two-thirds filled with the test fluid.
This jar is put on motor driven rollers which cause the shale cylinder to smoothly
roll through the test fluid on the side of the jar. The time after that the shale pellets
are totally disintegrated is recorded [102].
Change of mesh size
A typical shale erosion test is conducted by rolling a weighed portion of sized shale
particles in an aqueous medium and then screening the particles to determine the
amount of shale that eroded to the point of passing through a selected sized screen.
The shale is crushed and ground into particles that can pass through the 6 mesh
screen but are retained on the 14 mesh screen. Thus, particles of a mesh size from 6
to 14 are used for the erosion test.
Portions of 40 g of the shale are placed in laboratory barrel containing 350 ml of
the test drilling fluid and rolled for 16 h at the desired temperature, 65 ◦C.
Afterwards, the drilling fluids are again screened through the 14 mesh screen.
The retained solids are washed, dried, and weighed. Finally, the percent of erosion is
calculated based on the weight loss, corrected for the moisture content of the original
sample [74].
3.5.2 HASSLER CELL
The effect of drilling fluid additives on reactive shales can be assessed by the Hassler
cell test. Basically, this method measures the permeability. For this reason, all effects
that cause a change in permeability can be assessed. For example, a shale inhibition
can be measured, as the permeability of a core is reduced. Furthermore the change
in wettability by chemical treatment has been measured [103]. Hassler developed his
method in the 1940s [104,105].
Hereby, the cores under investigation are centrifuged and saturated with the
liquid. In this way, a pressure gradient can be established. The effluent fluids from
the samples are collected in glass tubes. A strobed light source is used to determine
the amounts of fluids collected.
The relative permeability of the core to a given fluid FL can be expressed as
FL = us/dPs
u100/dP100
. (3.2)
Here u is the rate of flow of the liquid, and dP is the pressure gradient. The indices s
mean an arbitrary saturation and 100 means 100% saturation.
Measuring the capillary pressure requires increasing the speed of the centrifuge in
increments and measuring the amount of fluid produced from the core sample when
the flow has ceased for that particular centrifuge speed [106].3.5 Test methods 231
On the other hand, it has been pointed out that for two-phase flow some problems
in the application of this method may arise [107]. The method is confined to a
drainage mode of flow for a water-wet core initially filled with a wetting fluid which
is then invaded by a nonwetting fluid, that is, oil invading a water-wet core.
The method of Hassler and Brunner is not useful when a wetting fluid invades a
water-wet core containing a nonwetting fluid as the equilibrium level of production of
the nonwetting fluid is dependent upon imbibition and not centrifuge speed. However,
such measurements are needed in order to design waterflood recovery methods,
where the invading fluid is wetting [106].
Even when developed in 1945, the method can be readily automated. Methods
have been developed to determine the saturation of the fluid inside the core.
Electromagnetic radiation is used to image a region while it is being centrifuged.
From the attenuation coefficients the fluid saturation may be calculated at a plurality
of points within the core. These saturations may be used to calculate capillary
pressure or relative permeability [106].
Nowadays, the pressure buildup can be readily established by chromatographic
pumps instead of centrifugal forces [108]. In this design, a Hassler cell resembles a
short chromatographic column.
Control of migration of clays
Swelling clays can be a major mechanism of formation damage due to the loss of
the mobility of hydrocarbon fluids in the formation [109]. Migrating clays and other
fines also cause permeability damage. When clays and other fines are disturbed, they
may begin to migrate within the production stream and, too frequently, encounter
constrictions in the capillary, where they bridge off the capillary and severely
diminish the flow rate of hydrocarbons to the wellbore. The change in the nature
of the water present may cause the fines to disperse or come loose from adhesion to
capillary walls, usually resulting in the migration of the fines through the formation,
where plugging can occur in smaller pore throats.
Sometimes the loss of permeability observed is due to clay swelling with
the relatively fresh water, with or without migration, but often clay swelling is
accompanied by the migration of fines. Nonswelling clays may also respond to the
foreign water and begin to migrate [109].
A method of treating a subterranean formation has been presented [109]. The
method uses a composition including a compound with at least one silylating group
and at least one ammonium group. The silylating group can include a hydroxy￾reactive organosilicone group, such that the silylating group is a tether group for a
subterranean material including hydroxy groups on a surface thereof. The ammonium
group can be an ion-exchange clay-stabilizing group. Several examples of such
compounds have been detailed [109].232 CHAPTER 3 Clay stabilization

4 Lubricants
One of the greatest challenges in the formulation of specialty lubricants for drilling
applications is the prevention of drill bit bearing wear in subterranean formations.
In such applications, lubrication takes place in an abrasive environment of mud and
rock particles deep below the earth’s surface.
The journal bearings are subject to extremely high loads, because the bit gen￾erally turns at slow speeds and has the weight of the drill string on top of it.
Furthermore, there is shock loading due to the bouncing and vibrating of the drill
string [1].
4.1 SYNTHETIC GREASES
There are monographs on the issues of synthetic greases, including applications
in petroleum industries [2]. Synthetic greases have considerable advantages over
conventional hydrocarbon-based greases. The advantages of synthetic greases in the
use of rock bits include [1]:
• high viscosity with good pumpability,
• lower torque,
• ability to function at lower operating temperatures, and
• excellent thermal and oxidative stability.
Many of these advantages arise due to a controlled synthesis that yields products
of exact properties. These superior benefits have led to the development of many
commercial synthetic types of grease for a variety of uses.
Rock bit bearings are generally lubricated with greases to assist the seals in
keeping out the drilling muds. The greases are prepared by adding a thickener to
a lubricating oil. Thickeners consist mostly of metal soaps.
Metal soaps are formed by the saponification of fatty oils into the corresponding
fatty acids and subsequent neutralization with a metal hydroxide. A grease formula￾tion typically includes various additives, such as additives for [1]:
• extreme pressure,
• anti-wear,
• corrosion,

239240 CHAPTER 4 Lubricants
• solubility,
• anti-seize protection, and
• oxidation protection.
4.1.1 BASE FLUIDS
Synthetic base fluids are low molecular weight poly-α-olefins (PAOs) however, with
a high viscosity index [1]. Preferred base fluid blends typically comprise a high
viscosity component and a low viscosity component. Preferably, the high viscosity
index PAO is the high-viscosity component and the low viscosity component is an
alkylated naphthalene.
So called unconventional base stocks can be used as additional base fluids.
These fluids are hydroprocessed, highly refined paraffinic base stocks. Relative to
conventional hydroprocessed and solvent refined base stocks, they contain extremely
low amounts of aromatic compounds, sulfur and nitrogen levels. They exhibit a high
resistance to oxidation and thermal degradation, very high viscosity indices, superior
viscosity and film strength at high temperatures, substantially reduced volatility, and
improved lubricity [1].
Dibasic acid esters also exhibit good thermal stability, but are usually also
used in combination with additives to enhance the resistance to hydrolysis and
oxidation. Polyol esters include molecules containing two or more alcohol moieties,
such as trimethylolpropane, neopentylglycol, and pentaerythritol esters. Synthetic
polyol esters are the reaction product of a fatty acid derived from either ani￾mal or plant sources and a synthetic polyol. Polyol esters have excellent ther￾mal stability and generally resist hydrolysis and oxidation better than other base
stocks.
Naturally occurring triglycerides or vegetable oils are in the same chemical family
as polyol esters. However, polyol esters tend to be more resistant to oxidation than
such oils, and thus tend to function better under severe conditions and high temper￾atures. The instability normally associated with vegetable oils are generally due to
a high content of linoleic and linolenic fatty acids, both unsaturated compounds.
As the degree of unsaturation in the fatty acids in vegetable oils increases, the
resulting esters tend to be less thermally stable [1]. Ester-based lubricants have some
advantages over oil-based lubricants [2, p. 71]:
• faster and deeper drilling,
• lower toxicity,
• no polycyclic hydrocarbons,
• good biodegradability,
• less drilling waste, and
• reduced drilling costs.4.1 Synthetic greases 241
4.1.2 EXTREME PRESSURE AGENTS
Extreme pressure agents (EPs) are additives for lubricants that decrease the wear of
parts gears that are exposed to very high pressures. They modify the surface of the
exposed parts under high pressure conditions by a chemical reaction. EPs include:
• sulfurized fatty compounds and hydrocarbons,
• chlorinated hydrocarbons,
• chlorendic acid esters,
• polymeric esters,
• polysulfides, and
• molybdenum compounds.
There are two types of EPs [1]. Compounds that become active at high tempera￾tures, such as lead dithiocarbamate, organosulfur compounds, and organophosphorus
sulfur compounds.
The second type is of inorganic nature. Solid EPs include molybdenum disulfide,
graphite, metal oxides, and powered metals such as copper and lead. The particles of
solid EPs act in forming layers between the two bearing surfaces and protect them
under load sliding against each other in a way similar to cards in a stack sliding
against each other. Solid EPs improve the load carrying capacity. However, they
contribute to excessive seal and hub wear and drill bit seal failure.
Drill bit lubricant compounds containing a copper EP caused seal failures due
to copper deposits close to the seal area. Namely, the copper accumulates near the
seal area until the seal is abraded by the erosive contact with the copper deposit.
Eventually, the grease composition is ejected from the journal area, and a metal to
metal contact between the roller cone and the journal is formed that causes a drill bit
failure.
On the other hand, lubricants that reduce seal and hub wear do not have a
sufficient film strength, that is, load carrying capacity, to be used as a drill bit
lubricant. In general, any additives made up from heavy metal complexes exhibit
an adverse environmental impact.
Alternatively, zirconium 2-ethylhexanoate or bismuth 2-ethylhexanoate can be
added in amounts up to 20% as additive. Zirconium and bismuth compounds are
nontoxic. This effects easier handling in storage, use, and final deposit of the
lubricant.
In addition, zirconium compounds impart some corrosion resistance to metal
surfaces. This corrosion resistance contributes in reducing the hub wear and improves
the sealing at low leakage rates. Wear out of seals may be also reduced when a
zirconium based lubricant is used.
Further, the addition of zirconium compounds may be effective to modify the
viscosities of the base stock, in which way the range of operating temperatures is
enlarged.242 CHAPTER 4 Lubricants
4.1.3 ANTI-SEIZE AGENTS
Anti-seize compounds are used to prevent the damage that high bearing stresses
may otherwise cause by providing a dissimilar metal or other material between
like substrates. Such a compound inhibits the welding that may otherwise occur
from the temperatures, pressures, and stresses normally incurred during proper
make-up [3].
Conventionally used anti-seize thread compounds include greases, which contain
substantial amounts of heavy metals or their oxides, carbonates, or phosphates. Such
metals include [3]:
• copper,
• zinc,
• lead,
• nickel,
• molybdenum, and
• aluminum.
However, environmental regulations have begun to discourage and prohibit the
use of anti-seize compounds that contain such materials. Organic fluid additives
containing antimony, zinc, molybdenum, barium, and phosphorus have become the
subject of environmental scrutiny as well. One of the reasons why such compounds
are disfavored results from the way in that they are used.
Oilfield threaded connections are usually coated with an excess amount of the
thread compound to ensure complete connection coverage. The excess compound
is sloughed off and ends up downhole. It is then included with the other materials
pumped out of the wellhole and into a containment area. From there, materials
contaminated with heavy metals must be removed and deposited to a hazardous waste
disposal site.
Alternatively, threaded connections can be protected by coating the threads,
prior to their make-up, with a solvent thinned resin based coating and bonding
composition.
This is composed of a suspending agent, a bonding agent, a thinning agent, and
a metallic flake. The coated threads are dried to bond the coating and the bonding
composition to the threads. Prior to their make-up, the threads are coated with an
excess of an environmentally friendly lubricating composition. A typical formulation
is shown in Table 4.1.
Using such a method, the anti-seize metallic film adheres to the thread surface
to provide an anti-seize protection while minimizing the amount of metal released
into the environment. Only the thread wear discharges metal into the environment.
Thus the metal contamination is substantially reduced, in comparison to conventional
methods.
In summary, the use of anti-seize metallic films in conjunction with environ￾mentally friendly lubricating compositions reduces the potential for environmental
damage, however, still provides an optimum protection in critical operations.4.1 Synthetic greases 243

On the other hand, fluorides of alkaline, or earth alkaline metals, such as CaF2
have been proposed as anti-seize agents for nickel and chrome ferrous alloys that
are prone to galling under high contact stress [4]. Typical grease compositions are
formulated as shown in Table 4.2.
4.1.4 ANTI-WEAR ADDITIVES
Anti-wear additives can be classified according to two categories [1]: those activated
at a lower temperature than EPs, such as zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate, sorbitan
monoleate, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and phosphate esters. To the other class are
belonging those that become active at lower loads than EPs, such as PTFE, and
antimony trioxide.
4.1.5 METAL DEACTIVATORS
Metal deactivators protect against nonferrous corrosion and in some cases also
against ferrous corrosion as well. Common metal deactivators for rock bits against
nonferrous corrosion are based on benzotriazole. Ferrous corrosion inhibitors include
organic acids and esters, phenolates, and sulfonates [1].244 CHAPTER 4 Lubricants
4.1.6 SOLUBILITY AIDS
Solubility aids are compounds that solubilize the additives into the oil or into the
soap. Common solubility aids, include esters, for example, trimellitic acid esters [1].
4.1.7 ANTIOXIDANTS
Common antioxidants that are used in grease formulations include zinc dialkyl
dithiophosphates, amine phosphates, aromatic amines, phenothiazine, or hindered
phenols, such as tert-butylhydroxytoluene.
When a grease is utilized to lubricate a rock bit, it is generally preferred not
to employ a zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate antioxidant if the rock bit comprises
an incompatible metal. However, in other lubricating applications, zinc dialkyl
dithiophosphates can be preferably employed as antioxidants [1].
4.1.8 BASE STOCKS
A wide variety of grease compositions are known. Such grease compositions exhibit
often a low viscosity, and are made from refined petroleum or hydrocarbon base
stock, which provides the base lubricity of the composition. The base stock may
constitute about three quarters of the total grease composition.
The base stock, or grease, respectively, is thickened with a conventional metal
soap or a metal complex soap. Light base stocks with low viscosity are used for
low temperature greases, and a heavier, higher viscosity base stocks are used for
high temperature greases [5]. In order to enhance the film lubricating capacity of
base stocks, or greases, respectively, solid additives such as molybdenum disulfide,
copper, lead, or graphite have been added.
Synthetic polymer EPs and high-viscosity synthetic polymers may also be used.
Such materials serve to enhance the ability of the lubricant base stock in forming
a friction reducing film between the moving metal surfaces under conditions of
extreme pressure and to increase the load carrying capacity of the lubricants. The
lubrication properties of the oils and greases are further enhanced by the addition of
solid additives, such as molybdenum disulfide, copper, lead, or graphite [6].
4.2 LUBRICANT COMPOSITIONS
4.2.1 MOLYBDENUM DISULFIDE
Molybdenum disulfide is used traditionally in greases for bit lubrication. In addition,
polymers of 2-methylpropene (i.e., isobutene) and metal soaps are used to formulate
synthetic greases [7].
A viscosity of 600-750 c P at 120 ◦C is desirable. However, in the severe
environment of a rock bit bearing, the viscosity of the composition should be at least
200 c P at 100 ◦C [8]. Other heavy-duty greases based on molybdenum sulfide also
contain calcium fluoride [9,10] and metal soaps as thickeners.4.2 Lubricant compositions 245

gAntioxidizing and anticorrosion additive to lubricating oils.
Specialized lubricating greases have been developed for the bearing assemblies
of roller bits. The greases are prepared from petroleum oils that are thickened with
alkali and alkaline earth metal soaps [11]. The greases contain additives and fillers,
such as synthetic dichalcogenides of refractory metals, which exhibit the necessary
service characteristics. Tests have shown that such greases exceed the initial grease
by 7-12 times with respect to performance time (Table 4.3).
4.2.2 POLARIZED GRAPHITE
Graphite is a classical lubricant [24]. Because of environmental concerns, compo￾sitions for solid lubricants have been developed in order to replace molybdenum
disulfide. These compositions consisted of graphite, sodium molybdate, and sodium
phosphate [25]. Later, such formulations have addressed as polarized graphite.
Polarized graphite can be used as a lubricant additive for rock bits. Unlike
graphite, polarized graphite is a unique material that exhibits extremely good load
carrying ability and anti-wear performance.
Graphite consists of carbon in a layered structure, and the lack of polarity inhibits
graphite powder from forming a lubricant film and adhering to metal surfaces. The
polarization of graphite results in the material having good adhesion to metal and
forming a lubricant film that can carry extremely high loads without failure.
Ordinary graphite has a laminar hexagonal crystal structure and the closed rings
of carbon atoms do not normally have any electrical polarization. Hence, graphite
has good lubricity in that the layers may slip or shear readily. However, the lack of
polarity leads to a poor adhesion to metal surfaces.246 CHAPTER 4 Lubricants
Graphite can be treated with alkali molybdates or tungstenates, to impart a
polarized layer at the surface of the graphite. Alternating positive and negative
charges are formed on the surfaces. The treated graphite shows an extremely good
load carrying capacity and anti-wear performance, somewhat similar to molybdenum
disulfide. The polarized graphite exhibits a good adhesion of particles on metal
surfaces and good film forming properties [26].
The adhesion properties of polarized graphite allow it to adhere to metal surfaces
and to form a film that serves as a physical barrier between adjacent metal surfaces.
Therefore, the polarized graphite, unlike graphite alone, acts as an adhesion promoter
to the surface and changes the lubricity of the graphite. Thus the grease composition
may support much heavier loads, with a lower coefficient of friction [26].
4.2.3 POWDERED LUBRICANTS
Lubricants are added to drilling fluids to reduce the torque and drag caused by friction
between drill string, drill bit, and formation. Many types of lubricants have been
developed and utilized in drilling fluids. Lubricants can be in either solid or liquid
form [27].
Liquid lubricants such as hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, fatty acids, surfactants,
and many other organic compounds are developed and used in the manufacture
of conventional lubricant additives. Solid lubricants such as graphite, hollow glass
beads, spherical solid particulates, and polymers have been developed and utilized in
drilling fluids.
However, solid lubricants have many limitations, such as stability under pressure
of hollow glass beads and problems in fluid formulations in graphite due to high
surface area. Additionally, the size of the particulates creates problems for sifting
with screen shakers. Another disadvantage is that large amounts of solid lubricants
are required to impart reasonable lubricity to drilling fluids, thereby increasing the
cost of production.
Liquid lubricants have their own shortcomings, such as their application at low
temperature and also with regard to logistical and environmental impacts.
When liquid lubricants containing fatty acids, sulfurized fatty acids, soaps of
sulfurized and nonsulfurized fatty acids, and esters of fatty acids are contaminated
with monovalent or divalent ions, insoluble alkali monovalent or divalent ion soaps
are formed and separate from the drilling mud. The greasing out of the alkali metal
ion soap causes severe impediments to the control of the mud. If such greasing out
occurs in drilling muds containing weighing agents, it causes accumulation of the
weighing agent, which then sinks to the bottom of the mud pit, and is lost from the
mud system. The resulting loss of mud density may cause blowout of the well.
It is observed that when drilling mud containing monovalent or divalent ions free
of weighting agents, the resulting insoluble soap floats on the surface of the mud in
the mud pit. This insoluble calcium soap plugs the shale shaker and thereby interferes
with the separation of the cuttings from the drilling mud. This further results in the4.2 Lubricant compositions 247
extreme pressure additive not being drawn up by the mud pumps and incorporated in
the drilling mud for circulation to the bit for lubrication.
Powdered lubricants for water-based drilling fluids have been developed [27].
Conventional liquid lubricants containing particularly divalent ions have the tendency
to grease out. The powdered lubricants have excellent dispersion properties and hence
do not grease out, when added to the drilling mud in concentrations preferably of the
order of about 3% or less.
Fatty acids, rosin acids, and the sulfurized derivatives of these compounds in
concentrations sufficient to impart lubricating properties to drilling muds are used
here.
The powdered lubricant is a combination of inert fillers with fatty acids that
are essentially free from fatty acid esters and metal soaps, and have organic acids
containing C10 to C24 alkyl groups [27].
The inert filler may be chosen from precipitated silica of particle size about 10-
180 μm, a diatomaceous earth of particle size about 10-200 μm, expanded perlite of
particle size about 10-5000 μm, combinations thereof. The ratio of the liquid additive
to the inert filler in the powdered lubricant should ideally vary from 30:70 to 70:30.
The improved lubricating properties of the drilling muds result in a significantly
increased life of the rotary drilling bits and a marked reduction in the torque
required to rotate the bit. Solid powdered additive compositions greatly reduce the
transportation costs and simplify the logistics and environmental concerns associated
with shipping large volumes of liquids; they also overcome the pour point issues
associated with liquid additives [27].

The use of ellipsoidal glass granules instead of spherical glass beads is substantiated
by the effort to increase the contact surface of antifrictional particles, reduce their
ability to penetrate deeply into the mud cake, and increase their breaking strength
[28–31].
4.2.5 CALCIUM SULFONATE-BASED GREASES
Drilling muds have been changed significantly over the last years due to environmen￾tal pressures and drilling in more extreme environments. Under extreme conditions,
conventional grease formulations cannot withstand the enhanced demands. For these
reasons, new designs have been appeared that [32]:
• adhere more effectively to the threaded connections,
• to not degel at elevated temperatures, and higher pH levels, and
• impart galling resistance and corrosion resistance.
Typical grease thickeners are calcium acetate, lithium stearate, lithium 12-
hydroxystearate, anhydrous and hydrous calcium soaps, sodium soaps, organophilic248 CHAPTER 4 Lubricants
clays, and silica. An important issue of a grease is its pH stability, since the pH of
drilling mud is increased as oil well depths increase.
During drilling operations, the threaded connections are exposed to drilling
fluids, which include drilling muds and shavings from the drilling operations. These
fluids and shavings tend to dissolve, erode or ablate the grease compounds thus
removing the protection and increasing the likelihood of damage to the threaded
connections.
Calcium sulfonate-based grease formulations are a suitable alterative to conven￾tional greases. These high performance sulfonate greases are superior carriers for
controlled friction properties in oilfield drilling and production thread compounds.
This is sound in particular, where those compounds are exposed on a continuous,
periodic or intermittent basis to fluids that tend to remove, erode or ablate the
compounds away from the threaded connection to which they were applied. By
reducing the thickener content, a calcium sulfonate grease can be formulated that
is cost competitive with conventional grease carriers used in oilfield applications.
Preferred base stocks include PAOs, poly(butene)s, polyol esters, vegetable oils, and
animal oils [32]. Thixotropic greases or grease like overbased calcium sulfonate
compositions have corrosion inhibiting properties [33].
When a drill bit is used in hard, tough formations, in addition, high pressures
and temperatures are encountered. The total useful life of a drill bit in such severe
environments is in the order of 20-200 h for bits in sizes of 6-28 in diameter at depths
of about 1500-6000 m. Useful life times of about 65-150 h are typical. When a drill
bit wears out or fails as a borehole is being drilled, it is necessary to withdraw the
drill string to replace the bit, a very expensive process. Prolonging the lives of drill
bits minimizes the lost time in round tripping the drill string for replacing bits [5].
The replacement of a drill bit can be required for a number of reasons, including
wearing out or breakage of the structure contacting the rock formation. One specific
demand for replacing the rock bits includes failure or severe wear of the journal
bearings on which the roller cones are mounted. The journal bearings are lubricated
with special formulations in order to survive the severe conditions. A lubrication
failure can sometimes be attributed to misfit of bearings or seal failure, as well as
problems with the grease itself [5].
4.2.6 PARAFFINS
Purified paraffins are nontoxic and biodegradable [34]. Biodegradable purified
paraffins may be used as lubricants, rate of penetration enhancers, or spotting fluids
for water-based drilling mud (WBM).
4.2.7 OLEFINS
Olefin isomers containing 8-30 carbon atoms are suitable. However, isomers having
fewer than 14 carbon atoms are more toxic, and isomers having more than 18 carbon
atoms are more viscous. Therefore olefin isomers having 14-18 carbon atoms are
preferred [15].4.2 Lubricant compositions 249
4.2.8 PHOSPHOLIPIDS
In aqueous drilling fluids, phospholipids are effective lubricating agents [35].
Phospholipids are naturally occurring compounds, for example, lecithin belongs to
the class of phospholipids. An introduction to phospholipid chemistry has given by
Hanahan [36]. Phospholipids find also use as polymers [37]. The structural units of a
phospholipid are shown in Figure 4.1.
Because of their ionic nature, some phospholipids are soluble in water. A pre￾ferred compound as lubrication additive for aqueous drilling fluids is cocoamido
propyl propylene glycol diammonium chloride phosphate [35]. Phosphatides or
phospholipids are environmentally safe lubricating additives [19].
4.2.9 ALCOHOLS
Alcohol glucoside mixture
Many oil-based fluids, or additives for such fluids, have caused environmental
concerns and tend to be more costly than aqueous based fluids. Consequently,
aqueous based fluids are often preferred [38]. However, aqueous based fluids tend
to have more lubricity problems and adverse effects on the subterranean formation,
such as causing swelling of clays, than encountered with oil-based fluids.
Silicate-based aqueous drilling fluids have long been known to inhibit formation
damage caused by water but have also long been known to have poor lubricity
properties. Lubricants commonly known and used in WBMs do not provide good
lubricity in silicate muds [38].

Recently, silicic acid based drilling fluids have been found to provide a
membrane-efficient WBM. However, silicic acid based drilling fluids have high
torque and drag values. Moreover, traditional mud lubricants show little to no effect
in a high pH silicic acid based mud.
The reaction mechanism for the polymerization of silicic acids derivatives is
shown in Figure 4.2.
A lubricant composition has been developed for silicic acid based drilling
fluids [38]. This composition comprises 2-octyldodecanol, and 2-ethylhexyl￾glucoside [38]. Alternative alcohols include oleyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and
poly(etherglycol)s.
It is believed that the alcohol serves as the more active lubricant and the
alkylglucoside present serves primarily as a wetting agent. An advantage of the
alkylglucosides is that they exhibit their wetting properties even at high pH.
Summarizing, the lubricant compositions is effective in a high pH environment, has
low toxicity, and is environmentally acceptable.
Partial glycerides
Historically, the class of pure water-based systems is the oldest in the development
of drilling fluids. However, their use is attended by such serious disadvantages
that, hitherto, only limited application has been possible for technically demanding
drilling operations. Above all, the interaction of the water-based drilling fluids with
the water sensitive layers of rock more particularly corresponding layers of clay to
be drilled leads to unacceptable interference with the drilling process [40].
Even in highly sensitive shale formations, adequate stability can be obtained in
the case of purely water-based drilling fluids. This observation involves the use of
systems based on soluble alkali metal silicates, that is, waterglasses. However, using
water-based drilling fluids, requires the addition of lubricants.
These include mineral oils, animal and vegetable oils, and esters. The increasingly
stricter regulations with regard to the biodegradability of drilling fluids and their

constituents are gradually restricting the use of the otherwise particularly suitable
mineral oils.
Lubricants for both water-based and OBMs for use at low temperatures have been
found as fatty acid partial glycerides. Basic water-based and OBMs that are used for
testing the lubricants are given in Table 4.4.
The effectiveness of the lubricants can be measured by the Almen-Wieland test
[41], the Falex pin and vee block method [42], the Timken wear and lubricant test
[43], and the four ball test [44]. The effect of various lubricants have been measured
as shown in Figure 4.3.

Aminoethanols
High pH values are difficult conditions for the stability of lubricating products, in
particular those based on conventional esters which hydrolyze at a high pH value and
under the effect of the temperature.
Instead of alcohols, amino alcohols can be used. For example, a lubricating
compositions has been synthesized by the reaction of polymerized linseed oil with
diethanolamine, at 160 ◦C. A product with a viscosity of around 2700 mPa s at 40 ◦C
is obtained [45]. The viscosity can be reduced by adding some methyl oleate to the
reaction product.
When added to a silicate mud, good lubricating properties are obtained, even at
high pH, up to 12. Tests using a lubricity tester revealed that the addition of 3% of a
lubricant to a base mud reduces the torque readings by 50%.
Polymeric alcohols
Synthetic PAOs are nontoxic and effective in marine environments when used as
lubricants, return-of-permeability enhancers, or spotting fluid additives for WBM.
A continuing need exists for other nontoxic additives for WBM, which serve as
lubricants, return-of-permeability enhancers, and spotting fluids.
Both poly(alkylene glycol) [46] and side chain polymeric alcohols such as
poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) have been suggested. These substances are comparatively
environmentally safe [22,47].
PVAs may be applied as such or in crosslinked form [48]. Crosslinkers can be
aldehydes, for example, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, and glutaraldehyde,
to form acetals, maleic acid or oxalic acid to form crosslinked ester bridges, or
dimethylurea, poly(acrolein), diisocyanate, and divinylsulfonate [49,50].
An amine-terminated polyoxyalkylene having an average molecular weight from
about 600 to 10,000 Da can be acylated with a succinic acylating agent, for
example, hexadecenyl succinic anhydride or a Diels-Alder diacid, obtained from an
unsaturated fatty acid [51,52]. Similarly, alkyl-aryl sulfonate salts can be used in
lubrication [53].
The pendant hydroxy groups of ethylene oxide-propylene oxide copolymers of
dihydroxy and trihydroxy alcohols may be sulfurized to obtain a sulfurized alcohol
additive. This is effective as a lubricant in combination with oils and fats [54,55].
The sulfurized alcohols may be obtained by the reaction of sulfur with an unsaturated
alcohol. Furthermore, fatty alcohols and their mixtures with carboxylic acid esters as
lubricant components have been proposed [56].
4.2.10 ETHERS
2-Ethylhexanol can be epoxidized with 1-hexadecene epoxide. This additive also
helps reduce or prevent foaming. By eliminating the need for traditional oil-based
components, the composition is nontoxic to marine life, biodegradable, environmen￾tally acceptable, and capable of being disposed of at the drill site without costly
disposal procedures [57].4.2 Lubricant compositions 253
4.2.11 ESTERS
There is a growing interest in alternatives with better biodegradability, in particular
esters. Some esters are summarized in Table 4.5.
The use of esters in water-based systems particularly under highly alkaline
conditions can lead to considerable difficulties. Ester cleavage can result in the
formation of components with a marked tendency to foam which then introduce
unwanted problems into the fluid systems.
Sulfonates of vegetable oils, in particular soya oil sulfonate, are also used as
lubricants in practice. Soya oil sulfonate can be used in water-based and oil-based
systems, but shows significant foaming, especially in water-based fluids, which
restricts its usefulness [40].
A lubricating composition that comprises components that can be obtained from
byproducts of manufacturing processes that provide a use for such byproducts
other than disposal would also be a significant contribution to the art and to the
economy [59].
The lubricating composition has been proposed that consists of esters obtained
by the reaction product of a glycerol component comprising glycerol, and glycerol
oligomers, and a fatty acid component. The reaction product is neutralized with
potassium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide. The composition of the glycerol
component is shown in Table 4.6.
The fatty acid component can be obtained from vegetable oils, from wood pulp
processing, from animal fats processing, etc.
Examples of catalysts for esterification include sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid,
nitric acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, etc. A preferred catalyst is concentrated sulfuric
acid [59]. In addition, the composition can be subjected to chain extension using
diacids, such as maleic acid, succinic acid, or glutaric acid [59].
Ester-based oils
Several ester-based oils are suitable as lubricants [60,61], as are branched chain
carboxylic esters [62]. Tall oils can be transesterified with glycols [63] or condensed
with monoethanolamine [64]. The ester class also comprises natural oils, such
as vegetable oil [65], spent sunflower oil [66–69], and natural fats, for example,

sulfonated fish fat [70]. In WBM systems no harmful foams are formed from partially
hydrolyzed glycerides of predominantly unsaturated C16 to C24 fatty acids.
The partial glycerides can be used at low temperatures and are biodegradable and
nontoxic [71]. A composition for high-temperature applications is available [72]. It
is a mixture of long chain poly(ester)s and poly(amide)s (PA)s.
In the case of esters from, for example, neopentylglycol, pentaerythrite, and
trimethylolpropane with fatty acids, tertiary amines, such as triethanolamine, to￾gether with a mixture of fatty acids, improve the efficiency [73].
Ester alcohol mixtures
In addition to esters, mixtures of fatty alcohols with carboxylic acid esters have been
proposed as a lubricating additive in water-based drilling fluids. The alcohols include
guerbet alcohol and oleyl alcohol with oleyl oleate or isotridecyl stearate as ester
component [74]. Fatty alcohols exhibit a foam-suppressing effect.
Phosphate esters
It has been found that the inclusion of poly(ether) phosphate esters in combination
with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), can give aqueous drilling fluids which provide
good lubricating properties in a wide range of drilling fluids [75].
Typical synthetic routes to such esters, involve the reaction of the poly(ether) with
a phosphating agent such as phosphorus pentoxide or polyphosphoric acid. The use
of polyphosphoric acid in the synthesis gives higher proportions of the monoester,
which is preferred. The optimal molecular weight of the PEG is 400 Da [75]. The
compatibility of the lubricant may be adversely affected by other components of the
drilling fluid, particularly by divalent cations such as calcium [75,76].4.2 Lubricant compositions 255
Biodegradable compositions
A biodegradable lubricating composition, has been proposed. This composition is
based on an aliphatic hydrocarbon oil and a fatty acid ester [77]. It is important
that the hydrocarbon is not aromatic. Namely, petroleum cuts with a high aromatic
compound content present a risk to marine life due to their toxicity if they are released
into the sea during offshore drilling.
The composition is used as a continuous oil phase in an invert emulsion
in a petroleum drilling fluid or mud. The composition is particularly useful in
offshore drilling in deep water or in inclined or long-range drilling. In the case of deep
water drilling, the temperature of the water is around 4 ◦C. Therefore, the viscosity
of drilling fluids needs to be controlled at these low temperatures.
Triglyceride esters of animal or plant fatty acids are basically biodegradable.
However, the use of these compounds in invert emulsion drilling fluids, shows
that these esters are extremely susceptible to hydrolysis, which results in unwanted
changes in the viscosity of emulsions.
Esters that are less sensitive to hydrolysis are esters of saturated or unsaturated
monocarboxylic acids, for example, isononanoic acid and of longer chain alcohols,
for example, isoheptanol, 2-ethyl hexanol, or n-octanol [78]. However, these com￾pounds are still susceptible to hydrolysis, particularly at high temperatures, especially
above 160 ◦C, as is the case in rock drilling and deep offshore drilling.
Esters condensed from rapeseed fatty acids and 2-ethyl hexanol, Finagreen®
BMDF (Totalfina) have been claimed to have still better properties [77]. Rape oil
consists mainly of oleic acid and linoleic acid. Mineral hydrocarbon cuts with
different properties have been used to which the esters have been added. Some
properties of these cuts are given in Table 4.7.
The kinematic viscosity as a function of temperature of cuts A and E on the one
hand and of a mixture consisting of 70% of these cuts and 30% of Finagreen® BMDF
are given in Table 4.8.

Inspection of Table 4.8 reveals that the ester composition involving cut A has a
viscosity of 8.4 mm2 s−1 at 0 ◦C. Thus, this composition has rheological properties
adapted to the low temperature conditions encountered in deep water drilling since
the maximum kinematic viscosity threshold at a temperature of 0 ◦C must be less
than 10 mm2 s−1 for a drilling fluid.

Synthetic polymers and natural polymers suitable for drilling muds are listed in
Tables 4.9 and 4.10, respectively. The structures of morpholine and methylene
bisacrylamide are drawn in Figure 4.5.
Poly(acrylamide)s (PAMs) are eventually hydrolyzed in the course of time and
temperature. This leads to a lack of tolerance toward electrolyte contamination
and to a rapid degradation inducing a loss of their properties. Modifications of
PAM structures have been proposed to postpone their thermal stability to higher
temperatures. Monomers such as AMPS or sulfonated styrene/maleic anhydride can
be used to prevent AAm comonomer from hydrolysis [122].

4.2.13 STARCH
Starch is a high molecular weight natural polymer composed of repeating 1,4-α￾d-glucopyranosyl units. It is typically a mixture of linear and branched polymers.
Amylose is the linear component with a molecular weight of around 200 kDa.
Amylopectin is the branched component with a molecular weight of around
1 MDa [123].
Normal dent corn starch contains about 25% amylose, however, commercial corn
starch varieties are available that range in amylose content from 0% (waxy corn
starch) to about 70% (high amylose corn starch).
Starch, as isolated in its native state, is insoluble in water at room temperature
because of hydrogen bonding between poly(saccharide) macromolecules and areas
of crystallinity within the starch granule. When a water solution of starch is heated,
granules initially take up water with limited swelling. Then, at a definite temperature,
typically about 70 ◦C, the granules swell rapidly and irreversibly. Therefore, areas
of crystallinity within the granule are lost. The temperature at which this occurs is
referred to as the gelatinization temperature.
Near the gelatinization temperature, the amylose component becomes soluble and
diffuses out of the granule matrix. As the temperature is increased beyond about
70 ◦C, a greater percentage of the starch becomes soluble. The granules become
highly swollen, until, at a temperature of about 90-100 ◦C, a viscous dispersion of
starch in water is obtained. However, despite the overall apparent solubility, the
starch is only partially soluble in water and occurs largely as highly swollen granules.
Thus granule fragments that may be easily separated from such a starch solution by
centrifugation.
True solutions of starch in water are difficult to prepare using conventional
cooking techniques and require the application of specialized techniques, such as
autoclaving at elevated temperatures and pressures.
Steam jet cooking is another technique for preparing starch solutions, which
is simpler and more economical than autoclaving, and is suitable for continuous
processing. Because of these processing advantages, jet cooking has been used for
decades to prepare starch solutions for commercial applications. The method of
steam jet cooking involves pumping a water slurry of starch through an orifice located
in a heating chamber, that is, a hydroheater, where the starch slurry contacts a jet of
high-temperature, high-pressure steam [123].
In the thermal jet cooking technique, the amount of steam is carefully controlled
to achieve complete steam condensation during the cooking process. This means that
only little or no excess steam passes through the cooker.
In the excess steam jet cooking technique, the steam entering the hydroheater
exceeds the amount required to achieve the required cooking temperature and
pressure, thus allowing considerable amounts of excess steam to pass through the
cooker along with the cooked starch solution. The intense turbulence caused by
the passage of this excess steam through the hydroheater promotes mechanical
shearing and degradation of starch molecules, especially those having the highest
molecular weight. Moreover, it produces starch solutions with a reduced viscosity
[123,124].260 CHAPTER 4 Lubricants
The high degree of turbulence and mechanical shear of the excess steam jet cook￾ing process also converts the water-immiscible lubricant phase to a homogeneous
aqueous dispersion of micrometer-sized oleaginous droplets. These unique aqueous
starch-oil dispersions form the basis for lubricant compositions that are suitable for
oilfield applications.
An inherent property of starch pastes and solutions is their tendency to form
gels on cooling, and this property is commonly referred to as retrogradation.
Retrogradation is caused by aggregation of starch molecules through hydrogen
bonding and crystallization. The tendency of starch solutions to retrograde and form
gels increases with the amylose content of the starch, because amylose is a straight
chain polymer with little or no branching.
Although retrogradation has also been observed in amylopectin solutions, ret￾rogradation is much slower with amylopectin, and is generally observed only
after solutions have been allowed to stand for prolonged periods of time [123].
The starch can be crosslinked with epichlorohydrin or phosphorus oxychloride
[125,126].
The preparation of starch-oil compositions is achieved by mixing starch, water,
and lubricating oil at room temperature and then passing this mixture through an
excess steam jet cooker. Alternatively, mixtures of starch and water are precooked
in the steamcooker and after admixing the lubricating oil, the composition is again
guided in a steamcooker.
As lubricant oils one of the following components are used: A base olefin, a high
molecular weight base olefin, a high molecular weight base olefin with ester, olefin
blends with ester, or a viscous, liquid poly(butene) [123].
The resulting jet cooked compositions are stable with respect to separation
and coagulation of oil droplets and are comprised of microscopic droplets of
oil, about 1-10 μm in diameter, and uniformly distributed in the starch-water
phase [123].
No emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, or surface active agents are used in the
process. If the oil content is held within the preferred range of 20-40 phr, jet cooked
compositions can be easily dried by drum drying. Outwardly dry, flake like products
are obtained that can be easily reduced in size by milling. No separation of the oil
from the dried starch matrix is observed.
These compositions can be easily dispersed in water to form smooth, stable,
lump-free dispersions. Water dispersions do not phase separate into their oil and
aqueous components on prolonged standing because of a thin layer or shell of
starch that spontaneously forms around each oil droplet during the jet cooking
process [127].
Preparation 4–1: The crosslinking of starch is achieved as follows [126]: At room
temperature, 1000 g of waxy maize starch is slurried in 1500 g of water. To the slurry,
sodium hydroxide, as a 3% solution, is slowly added to reach a pH of 12. Then, 0.13%
epichlorohydrin is added to the slurry. The reaction mixture is allowed to react at 40 ◦C
for completion, then cooled to room temperature, and neutralized to a pH of 6.0 with4.2 Lubricant compositions 261
aqueous hydrochloric acid. Eventually the starch is filtered, washed and dried to provide
an ungelatinized dry powder.
Laboratory tests indicated that starch lubricant compositions lower both API
and high temperature/high pressure fluid loss values. Results are represented in
Table 4.11.
Actually, the coefficients of friction are up to 45% lower than those of the
untreated base muds. In fact, they are similar to those of OBMs. Only 0.5% of starch
lubricant must be added to get satisfactory results [128].
4.2.14 AMIDES
The group of nitrogen containing additives comprises phenolic Mannich bases,
phosphoric acid [129], and oxalkylated alkyl phenols with nitrogen containing
additives [130]. Vinyl amide monomers for synthetic muds are shown in Figure 4.6.

4.3 SPECIAL ISSUES
4.3.1 SIDE REACTIONS
Extensive laboratory work has been carried out in order to determine the performance
of a number of lubricants. These studies included tests to determine the potential of
formation damage in several types of drilling fluids, as well as the reduction of the
friction coefficient.
Certain polymer additives are effective also as lubrications as a side effect.
However, in many cases, additional lubricants must be added to be successful in
drilling to the total intended depth [131].
Lubricants for water-based drilling are primarily chosen due to their technical
performance and due to environmental restrictions. Hydrocarbons and fatty acids
were used mostly in the past, but nowadays a trend to more environmentally
acceptable alternatives, can be seen, in particular to esters and naturally occurring
vegetable oils.
These chemicals are highly lubricious materials as they are significantly reducing
the coefficients of friction in water-based fluid environments, of both metal/metal and
metal/rock contacts. Laboratory tests reveal that the reduction of the coefficient of
friction reaches up to 70%. Clearly, effective additives exhibit high degree of surface
activity.
This property improves their adhesion to the metal casing or the drilling mud
solids. In this way, the lubricity of the surfaces is enhanced. On the other hand, the
surface activity makes the lubricants more prone to react with other components of
the mud.
For example, lubricants may act as an emulsifier even in the presence of small
quantities of oil. Thus, such a composition may turn basically into an invert emulsion
with the consistency of cottage cheese [131]. Of course, such events are highly
undesirable as the formation of a highly viscous material is definitely a drilling
hazard. Moreover, in the worst case the production zone may be damaged.
Apart from this, the lubricant may react with and divalent or multivalent ions,
forming ionic bonds as found in ionomers. This reaction results in the formation of
a grease like precipitate. The precipitate may formed already at low concentrations
of calcium or magnesium ions of 1000 ppm, depending on the chemical nature of
the lubricant. Such ionic concentrations are frequently observed in even fresh water.
All these issues must be taken into account for the selection of proper lubricants for
water-based drilling fluids [131].
4.3.2 SILICATE-BASED MUDS
Silicate-based muds are notorious for a high coefficient of friction against rock
or metal in comparison to oil-based or synthetic-based muds. However, oil-based
and synthetic-based muds introduce environmental concerns and wells. Actually,
in certain locations it is not allowed to drill using such lower friction muds. Thus,
silicate-based muds are preferred for environmental reasons [132].4.3 Special issues 263
Further, synthetic-based muds are typically more expensive than silicate-based
muds. For silicate-based muds, it is desirable to lower the coefficients of friction in
order to increase the drilling rates.
Suitable lubricants for these types of mud are preferably selected from the group
comprising glycosides. These glycosides may be functionalized. The amount of
lubricant is typically in the range of 1-15%. Specific examples are of glycosides are
listed in Table 4.12.
The structure of glucopyranosides is shown in Figure 4.7.
Preparation 4–2: The preparation of alkylated an glucoside is basically an etherification.
It can be done by dissolving dry HCL in the respective alcohol. To this mixture, the
glucose is added and allow to react for 12 h [133]. Then the glucoside is extracted with
ethyl acetate. After drying, the major portion of the solvent is removed. The glucoside is
somewhat reluctant to crystallize.
Alkylated poly(glucoside)s act as surfactants in microemulsions [134]. Mi￾croemulsions are thermodynamically stable, isotropic mixtures containing water, oil,
and surfactant. Microemulsions are utilized in a variety of industrial applications,
besides of oilfield applications, in solvent delivery, and polymerization techniques
[134–136].

4.3.3 STUDIES ON PIPE STICKING
A study of the effect of various additives on pipe sticking is available [137]. The
effect of various available oilfield additives to reduce the downhole friction and
their optimal concentration has been studied. As previously mentioned, the frictional
forces present at the string-borehole interface are of prime importance. The friction at
the string-borehole interface can be reduced through various chemicals incorporated
in the drilling fluid system.
To obtain a mud cake in which sensitivity of various chemicals could be studied,
a highly sticky cake was prepared from mud containing gypsum, kaolinite, sand, and
shale powder. The sensitivity of various mud additives in minimizing the friction at
the string-borehole interface, and thereby reducing the sticking coefficient tendency,
was evaluated systematically with time. The study was extended to several mud
systems.
4.3.4 DIFFERENTIAL STICKING REDUCER
Various additives have been proposed to assist in freeing a stuck drill pipe, the most
common of which is diesel oil that is added directly to the drilling mud as a spotting
fluid. However, this is not always successful.
An additive comprising an oil-in-water microemulsion has been proposed.
Sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate may be used as a surfactant. Ethylene glycol
or diethylene glycol act as cosurfactants [138].

5 Bacteria control
Major problems in oil and gas operations result from the biogenic formation of
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the reservoir. The presence of H2S results in increased
corrosion, iron sulfide formation, higher operating costs, and reduced revenue and
constitutes a serious environmental and health hazard.
In secondary oil recovery, which involves waterflooding of the oil-containing
formation, biofilms can plug the oil-bearing formation. Severe corrosion also can
result from the production of acids associated with the growth of certain bacterial
biofilms. These bacterial biofilms are often composed of sulfate-reducing bacteria,
which grow anaerobically in water, often in the presence of oil and natural gases.
Once biofilms are established, it is extremely difficult to regain the biologic control
of the system.
When biofilms are formed on metallic surfaces, they can seriously corrode oil
production facilities. Microbiologically influenced corrosion represents the most
serious form of that degradation.
It is estimated that microbiologically influenced corrosion may be responsible for
15-30% of failures caused by corrosion in all industries.
Thus an effective control of bacteria, which are responsible for these undesired
effects is mandatory. Several biocides and also nonbiocidal techniques to control
bacterial corrosion are available. Procedures and techniques to detect bacteria have
been developed.
5.1 MECHANISMS OF GROWTH
5.1.1 GROWTH OF BACTERIA SUPPORTED BY OILFIELD CHEMICALS
Growth experiments have been conducted using bacteria from oil installations with
several chemicals normally used in injection water treatments. The studies revealed
that some chemicals could be utilized as nitrogen sources, as phosphorus sources,
and as carbon sources for those bacteria [1]. Therefore, it is concluded that the growth
potential of water treatment additives may be substantial and should be investigated
before the selection of the respective chemicals.
In other experiments it was established that the cultures of sulfate-reducing
bacteria isolated from waters of several oil fields have a greater capacity to form
H2S than the collection culture of sulfate-reducing bacteria used as the standard in
these investigations. The stimulating effect of the chemical products on individual

275276 CHAPTER 5 Bacteria control
elective cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria can vary considerably depending on the
species, activity, and adaptation of bacteria to the chemical products.
Selective cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria as a result of adaptation acquire
relative resistance to toxic compounds. Thus, when bactericides are used for complete
suppression of the vital activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the bottom hole zone
and reservoir, higher doses of the bactericide than those calculated for laboratory
collection cultures are necessary [2].
It has been shown that sulfidogenic bacteria injected into a reservoir with
floodwater may survive higher temperatures in the formation and can be recovered
from producing well fluids [3]. These organisms may colonize cooler zones and
sustain growth by degrading fatty acids in formation waters.
5.1.2 MATHEMATICAL MODELS
A mathematical model for reservoir souring caused by the growth of sulfate-reducing
bacteria is available. The model is an one-dimensional numerical transport model
based on conservation equations and includes bacterial growth rates and the effect of
nutrients, water mixing, transport, and adsorption of H2S in the reservoir formation.
The adsorption of H2S by the rock has been considered. Two basic concepts for
microbial H2S production were tested with field data [4]:
• H2S production in the mixing zone between formation water and injection water
(mixing zone model), and
• H2S production caused by the growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria in a biofilm in
the reservoir rock close to the injection well (biofilm model).
Field data obtained from three oil producing wells on the Gullfaks field correlated
with H2S production profiles obtained using the biofilm model but could not be
explained by the mixing zone model [4].
Model of colony growth
The growth of bacteria with time in the presence of various amounts of copper sulfate
is shown in Figure 5.1. As a measure for the growth serves the diameter of the
colonies.
A simplified model of colony growth has been presented [5]. According to
this model, during growth, a colony passes successively through exponential and
linear phases of growth. However, the exponential phase of growth persists unless
the concentration of a nutritious substrate becomes limited. The increase of colony
diameter d during the exponential phase can be described as
d = d0 expμ
m
2
t

. (5.1)
Here d is the diameter of the colony at the incubation time t, d0 is the effective
diameter of the individual cell, the colony progenitor, and μ
m is the maximal
growth rate.5.1 Mechanisms of growth 277

In contrast, the linear phase of growth occurs at nutrient limitation and it starts at
a time tl, after which the colony diameter increases with constant rate kd according to
d = dtl + kd(t − tl). (5.2)

Equation 5.3 relates the key parameter of the exponential growth phase of an

macrocolony. This property essentially simplifies the experimental determination of
the parameter μ
m [5].
5.1.3 MODELING OF NITRATE INJECTION
Reservoir souring refers to the onset of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production during
waterflooding [6]. Besides health and safety issues, H2S content reduces the value of
the produced hydrocarbon.
Nitrate injection is an effective method to prevent the formation of H2S. De￾signing this process requires the modeling of a complicated set of biogeochemical
reactions involved in the production of H2S and its inhibition.278 CHAPTER 5 Bacteria control
Biological reactions associated with the injection of nitrate to inhibit reservoir
souring were modeled. The model is implemented in a general purpose adaptive
reservoir simulator.
The basic mechanism in the biologically mediated generation of H2S is the
reaction between sulfate in the injection water and fatty acids in the formation
water in the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Mechanisms that describe the
effect of nitrate injection on souring remediation are available. Depending on the
circumstances, more than one mechanism may occur at the same time.
These mechanisms include the inhibitory effect of nitrite on sulfate reduction,
the competition between sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrate-reducing bacteria,
and the stimulation of nitrate-reducing sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. For each mech￾anism, the biological species and chemical components involved must be specified
and the role of each component in the biological reaction must be elucidated. For each
biological reaction, a set of ordinary-differential equations along with differential
equations for the transport of chemical and biological species must be solved [6].
The results of the reported experiments in the literature are used to find the input
parameters for field scale simulations.
This comprehensive modeling accounts for variation in biological-system char￾acteristics and reservoir conditions that affect the production and remediation of
H2S [6].
5.1.4 DETECTION OF BACTERIA
In oilfield systems, the detection of living bacteria is necessary to evaluate the
potential for microbially influenced corrosion, biogenic souring and to evaluate
the effectiveness of biocide treatment programs [7]. It happens that the dosages of
biocide are to low or too high, in particular, when methods of the determination of
the number of bacteria present are insufficient.
Uncontrolled growth and activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria in oilfield systems
can create safety, environmental, and operational problems, such as microbially
influenced corrosion, solids production, and biogenic hydrogen sulfide generation.
A method for the rapid enumeration of living bacteria would allow quick biocide
treatments. In this way, the bacterial control can be maximized. Consequently, the
environmental impact from the chemical treatment is and minimized.
Microbiologically influenced souring (MIS) is the production of H2S through the
metabolic activities of microorganisms. A better chance for mitigating MIS in some
downhole environments using biocides may be possible if the problem is detected
early in the souring process [8]. However, if the H2S-producing creatures are allowed
to spread into subsurface regions that are less accessible to biocides, that is, profuse￾stage MIS, the problem becomes less mitigable by conventional means.
API serial dilution method
The API serial dilution method is the most widely used method for the detection
of microorganisms. Field test methods for estimating bacterial populations have5.1 Mechanisms of growth 279
been standardized. A standard method dealing with the dose-response (time-kill)
testing for evaluating biocides has been established. Sampling methods are of special
importance because effective sampling is essential to any successful analysis.
Enzymatic assay
The enzymatic (luciferase) assay for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is one of the
methods applied to areas of biocidal control in oil production operation [9]. A reliable
method for the determination of ATP is the measurement of the bioluminescence
produced by the luciferin luciferase system.
Electrochemical determination
An electrochemical method has been developed to allow on-line monitoring of
biofilm activity in aqueous environments.
Colorimetry
Laboratory data on the persistence of biocides formulated in glutaraldehyde and
acrolein are available [10]. A colorimetric general aldehyde detection method
based on m-phenylenediamine was used. Such studies follow the demand for better
understanding of ecologic systems in the aspect of environmental protection.
In another study, a mathematical model has been constructed that incorporated
experimentally determined glutaraldehyde persistence, rates of water production, and
other factors. The model has been used to calculate the levels of glutaraldehyde in
a specified environment (lagoons) as a function of time, based on the amount of
glutaraldehyde applied downhole [11].
Most probable number technique
The traditional method for the bacterial enumeration is the most probable number
technique [12–14]. Serial dilution into bacterial culture media, is the most common
method to enumerate viable oilfield bacteria. This method takes up to 4 weeks to
obtain results for slow growing sulfate-reducing bacteria.
Direct microscopy is an alternative method, which is rapid. However, this method
does not differentiate in between living and dead bacteria. A method for the rapid
enumeration of living sulfate-reducing bacteria has been developed. This method is
based on the rehydration of dried nutrients with system water. The results are ready
in 1-7 d [7].
DNA sequencing
The bacterial enumeration and identification in diesel and naphtha pipelines lo￾cated in the northwest and southwest region in India has been reported. The
traditional cultivation technique and 16S rDNA gene sequencing has been used.
Deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing was done out using a Genetic Analyzer from PE
Applied Biosystems.
The phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences of the isolated species was
done. The sequences obtained were analyzed with BLAST search. The samples280 CHAPTER 5 Bacteria control

of 11 bacterial species that are summarized in Table 5.1.
Sulfate-reducing bacteria were not detected in samples from pipelines. The
dominant bacterial species identified in the samples were Bacillus cereus and Serratia
marcescens.
It has been concluded that several types of bacteria may be involved in the
biocorrosion arising from natural biofilms that develop in the pipelines. Further
localized pitting was observed by analysis with scanning electron microscopy [15].
5.1.5 SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA
Sulfate-reducing bacteria belong to the class of chemolithotrophic bacteria [16].
Around 220 species of 60 genera are known. All use sulfate as terminal electron
acceptor. In this way, they constitute a unique physiological group of microorganisms
that couple anaerobic electron transport to ATP synthesis.
These bacteria can use a wide variety of compounds as electron donors. Proteins
with metal groups that can be oxidized and reduced are the basis of metabolism.
In particular, they act on soluble electron transfer proteins and via transmembrane
redox complexes. The capability of sulfate-reducing bacteria to utilize hydrocarbons
in pure cultures and consortia offers the possibility for the bioremediation of soils
that are contaminated with aromatic hydrocarbons.
Some strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria can even reduce chlorinated
compounds, for example, 3-chlorobenzoate, chloroethenes, and nitroaromatic
compounds. Sulfate-reducing bacteria can reduce also some heavy metals. Therefore,
several procedures have been proposed for using these strains in the bioremediation
of toxic metals.5.1 Mechanisms of growth 281
In the course of metabolism, high levels of hydrogen sulfide are produced. Since
the produced sulfide contributes to the souring of the oil fields, corrosion of casings
and concrete is a serious problem [16]. New strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria are
continuously discovered [17–19]. For example, in 2003, a new spirilloid sulfate￾reducing bacterium designated strain MET2T, was isolated from a Mexican oil field
separator [17].
Issues in the oilfield
Mesophilic and thermophilic sulfate-reducing bacteria are common inhabitants of
oilfield facilities. They may penetrate into oil reservoirs together with the injection
water, and are in this way they contaminate the producing well. Their activities, that
is, sulfide production and hydrogen oxidation, are responsible for serious and costly
biocorrosive problems in the oil industry, for example, corrosion of drilling pipe steel
[20]. The bacteria are most often controlled in situ by biocides [17,21]. There are
monographs concerning the issues of sulfate-reducing bacteria [13,14].
The effect of temperature and pressure on a strain of sulfate-reducing bacteria has
been investigated. The strain was isolated from an oil reservoir in Alaska [22]. The
highest bacterial growth rate was found at 37 ◦C at 100 atm. The temperature has a
greater influence on the bacterial proliferation than the pressure.
In addition, the effect of various concentrations of biocides, that is, isothiazolone
and formaldehyde on sulfate-reducing bacteria has been tested. Both biocides are
effective similarly, however, at high pressures, formaldehyde is more effective [22].
5.1.6 BACTERIAL CORROSION
Bacterial corrosion is often referred to as microbiologically influenced corrosion.
Microbiologically influenced corrosion involves the initiation or acceleration of
corrosion by microorganisms. The metabolic products of microorganisms appear to
affect most engineering materials, but the more commonly used corrosion resistant
alloys, such as stainless steels, seem to be particularly susceptible.
The importance of microbiologically influenced corrosion has been underesti￾mated, because most microbiologically influenced corrosion occurs as a localized,
pitting-type attack. In general, this corrosion type results in relatively low rates of
weight loss, changes in electrical resistance, and changes in total area affected. This
makes microbiologically influenced corrosion difficult to detect and to quantify using
traditional methods of corrosion monitoring [23].
To adequately address microbiologically influenced corrosion problems, interdis￾ciplinary cooperation of specialists in microbiology, metallurgy, corrosion, and water
chemistry is required. Because the complexities of microbiologically influenced
corrosion are so great, a single technique cannot provide all the answers in terms
of corrosion mechanisms.
The problem and importance of microbiologically influenced corrosion was not
fully realized until recently. Even in the mid-1980s the statement was made that282 CHAPTER 5 Bacteria control
The major problem encountered by the petroleum microbiologist working in the
North Sea oil fields is that of convincing the oil field engineer that bacterial corrosion
is a subject worthy of serious attention.
A reference guide on recognizing, evaluating, and alleviating corrosion problems
caused by microorganisms has been compiled [24]. This manual provides a guide,
training manual, and reference source for field and engineering personnel for dealing
with corrosion problems caused by microorganisms. The trends in the 1990s of
microbiologically influenced corrosion have been reviewed in the literature [25]. The
basic goal of a practicing corrosion engineer should be not to identify, count, or even
kill the microorganisms, but to effectively control corrosion in an oil field.
5.1.7 MECHANISMS OF MICROBIAL CORROSION
The role of microorganisms can be visualized directly in microbially induced
corrosion in an electrochemical cell. Alternatively, the role can be indirect, in that
it maintains a preexisting electrochemical cell by stimulating either the cathodic or
the anodic reaction [26]. Various microorganisms and mechanisms are thought to be
involved. Most commonly, a differential aeration cell is built with a low concentration
of oxygen, shielded beneath slime or colony growth, as compared with the high
concentration externally in the bulk environment.
Under these conditions, the surface in the low concentration area becomes anodic
with the dissolution of metal, while the electrons react at the cathodic region with the
high concentration of oxygen, giving rise to hydroxide. Ultimately, metal oxides and
hydroxides are characteristic for aerobic corrosion. Mechanisms whereby microbes
influence the corrosion rate are described as [27]:
1. cathodic depolarization,
2. formation of occluded area on metal surface,
3. fixing the anodic sites, and
4. underdeposit acid attack.
Simultaneous mechanisms of corrosion
Microbiologically influenced corrosion almost always acts in concert with other cor￾rosion mechanisms and may, at times, appear to be crevice corrosion, underdeposit
acid attack, oxygen concentration cell corrosion, ion concentration cell corrosion,
and CO2 corrosion [28].
In most cases in which microbiologically influenced corrosion is found on
external surfaces, this corrosion type is associated with disbonded coatings or other
areas that are shielded from the potentially protective action of cathodic protection.
Furthermore, pipelines often are in contact with wet clays, which have little scaling
potential.5.1 Mechanisms of growth 283
pH regulation
Weak acids are products of bacterial metabolisms. Sulfate-reducing bacteria regulate
the pH of their environment at levels that depend on the potential secondary reactions:
• precipitation of iron sulfide,
• oxidation of sulfide ions to thiosulfate by traces of oxygen, and
• metabolism of this thiosulfate or of other sulfur compounds.
In this way, it is possible to explain the initiation and growth of bacterial
corrosion pits.
Biocide enhancers
In order to effectively treat water against bacterial contamination, a fast acting biocide
is needed. This may be even more important for on-the-fly treatments, where biocides
have a very short contact time with the water before other treating chemicals are
added and the fluids are pumped down hole. To get an effective fast kill of bacteria,
in some instances it is believed to be helpful to include a biocide enhancer to aid the
biocide treatments or work synergistically with the biocide [29].
Quaternary surfactants may act at the same time as biocide enhancers. For
example, 19N™ is a cationic surfactant that also is a biocide enhancer. When used in
combination with biocides such as sodium hypochlorite or glutaraldehyde, in some
instances, bacterial problems may be treated in short times in the range of 5 min.
Although quaternary surfactants can be useful when used together with biocides,
some quaternary surfactants may have a fundamental incompatibility with anionic
friction reducers, which are also useful in subterranean operations.
It is believed that this fundamental incompatibility may arise from charges present
on both molecules that may cause the quaternary surfactant and the friction reducer
to react and eventually a precipitate is formed. Additionally, some biocides, for
example, such as oxidizers, may degrade certain friction reducers [29].
5.1.8 CORROSION MONITORING
A critical review of the technical literature concerned with monitoring techniques for
the study of microbiologically influenced corrosion has been presented in the litera￾ture [30]. The monitoring techniques in this review include measurements of electro￾chemical properties, measurements of physical metal loss, and enumeration of sessile
organisms. The procedures for the study of microbiologically influenced corrosion,
as well as the advantages and the disadvantages of each technique, are discussed.
Microbiologically influenced corrosion can be misdiagnosed as attack caused by
conventional chloride crevice or as pitting corrosion, unless specialized techniques
are used during the failure analysis [31]. These techniques include in situ bacteria
sampling of residual water; bacterial analysis of corrosion products using analytical
chemistry, culture growth, and scanning electron microscopy, as well as nonde￾structive examination using ultrasonic and radiographic techniques. Metallographic
examination can reveal microbiologically influenced corrosion characteristics such
as dendritic corrosion attack in weld metal.284 CHAPTER 5 Bacteria control
Bacterial hydrogenase
Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the removal of molecular
hydrogen from cathodic surfaces is a primary driving force in microbiologically
influenced corrosion. A rapid (1-4 h) test has been developed for the presence of
bacterial hydrogenase that detects the presence of a wide range of corrosion-causing
bacteria in water, sludge, and adherent bacterial biofilms [32].
This test can be used to monitor oil and gas systems for the development of
potentially corrosive bacterial populations and to assess the efficacy of control
measures, including biocide treatment, because the hydrogenase test yields negative
results when this pivotal, corrosion-causing enzyme has been denatured.
Lipid biomarkers
Microbes of differing physiologic types, acting in consortia, appear to be more
destructive than monocultures. Methods for examining consortia are based on the
detection of lipid biomarkers that are characteristic for different classes of microbes.
These can be analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry [33].
Electron microscopy
Side stream sampling devices can be used to collect biofilm and corrosion samples.
The biofilm, inorganic passive layers, and metal attacked samples can be character￾ized with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Results
of such a study showed a correlation between biofouling and corrosion attack of
carbon steel samples [34].
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance, weight loss, and potentiodyne techniques can be used
to determine the corrosion rates of carbon steel and the activities of both sulfate￾reducing bacteria and acid-producing bacteria in a water injection field test. A
study revealed that the corrosion rates determined by the potentiodyne technique
did not correlate with the bacterial activity, but those obtained by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy were comparable with the rates obtained by weight loss
measurements [35].
Other electrochemical techniques include the measurements of the corrosion
potential, the redox potential, the polarization resistance, the electrochemical
impedance, electrochemical noise, and polarization curves, including pitting scans.
A critical review of the literature concerned with the application of electrochemical
techniques in the study of microbiologically influenced corrosion is available [36].
5.1.9 ASSESSMENT OF ACTIVITY OF BIOCIDES
Quantitative methods that use indirect parameters of the growth of cells have been
developed. In the early times, only a few rapid techniques were available. Although
some disc diffusion techniques have been described that generated results within5.1 Mechanisms of growth 285
4-6 h, most techniques required an incubation time of 18-24 h before a result was
available [37].
Such a method is based on impedance microbiology [38]. It uses a double￾layer API agar medium together with sodium thioglycolate as reducing agent. In
comparison to the conventional API procedure [39], which requires 28 days, this
technique takes only 1 day to obtain test results.
A rapid method for estimating the biocide potential of various chemicals toward
certain microbes has been developed which is based on the redox potential of live
microbial cells. A water-soluble organic redox indicator, blue in the oxidized form
and pink in the reduced form, has used as an indicator of the reducing potential of
microbial cells [40].
Turbidimetry can also be used to assess the growth of bacteria [41]. The
microcalorimetric measurement of microbial activity of biofilm samples allows easy
testing of the efficacy of biocides [42]. Experiments with biofilm samples consisting
of sulfate-reducing bacteria and chemoorganotrophic bacteria have been performed.
Further, biofilms were produced in continuous culture on the surface of a flow￾through gold tubing in a measuring cylinder of a calorimeter.
In separate experiments, the biofilm samples were treated with biocides, including
formaldehyde, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, and
glutaraldehyde with varying concentrations and incubation times. The heat produc￾tion in a typical experiment is illustrated in Figure 5.2.

In the experiment, a pure culture biofilm with Vibrio natriegens was used. As
biocide, a glutaraldehyde based composition was used. As the biocide is added after
120 min, a drop down of the heat produced is observed. Obviously, only at the highest
concentration of biocide, the activity is basically lost.
5.1.10 SYNERGISTIC ACTION OF BIOCIDES
The synergistic effects of biocides can be evaluated. A bacillus together with
dehydrated nutrients and a growth indicating dye is put on a plastic strip. Then, this
strip is dipped into a fluid of interest. The medium thereby rehydrated and the spores
are activated. Incubation for 24 h should yield a visible growth in the absence of
biocides. However, in the presence of biocides, the growth is inhibited.
The concentration of the biocide in the fluid can be adjusted by making a range of
dilutions, and testing each concentration. These experiments serve to get knowledge,
which concentration of biocide just inhibits the growth. In this way, the minimum
inhibitory concentration can be found out. If more than one biocide is present, it
is possible to distinguish between an additive effect, antagonism and enhancement.
From this knowledge, in many cases, exact dosing of large systems is possible for at
first trial [43].
The method has been used to determine the synergistic effects of copper sulfate
and kathon, that is, 2-N-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one) on Serratia marcescens [5].
Amino alcohols are not biocides themselves, however, they enhance the performance
of a wide range of biocides used in water-based fluids [44].
5.2 TREATMENTS WITH BIOCIDES
5.2.1 PREVIOUSLY FRACTURED FORMATIONS
A special problem is the refracturing of a previously fractured formation that is
contaminated with bacteria. In such a case, the fracturing fluid must be mixed with
an amount of biocide sufficient to reach and to kill the bacteria contained in the
formation. The refracturing of the formation causes the bactericide to be distributed
throughout the formation and to contact and kill bacteria contained therein [45].
5.2.2 INTERMITTENT ADDITION OF BIOCIDE
The intermittent addition technique consists of [46–48]:
• The addition of a slug dose of a biologically effective amount of a quick-kill
biocide.
• Intermittent addition of biologically effective amounts of a control biocide. This
means that the control biocide is dosed for a certain period of time, followed by
a period of much lower or zero dosing. This cycle is repeated throughout the
treatment.5.2 Treatments with biocides 287
This process reduces the amount of control biocide employed in the control of
contamination of oil production system waters by sessile bacteria. The biocide may
be applied at intervals of 2-15 d. The duration of biocide application is preferably
from 4 to 8 h [49].
5.2.3 NONBIOCIDAL CONTROL
Chemical treatments for bacteria control represent significant cost and environmental
liability. Because the regulatory pressure on the use of toxic biocides is increasing,
more environmentally acceptable control measures are being developed.
Biocompetitive exclusion technology
Besides adding biocides to wells, another approach seems to be promising in
modifying the reservoir ecology. The production of sulfide can be decreased, and its
concentration is reduced by the establishment and growth of an indigenous microbial
population that replaces the population of sulfate-reducing bacteria.
The technology is based on the addition of low concentrations of a water-soluble
nutrient solution that selectively stimulates the growth of an indigenous microbial
population, thereby inhibiting the detrimental sulfate-reducing bacteria population
that causes the generation of H2S. This deliberate and controlled modification of the
microflora and reservoir ecology has been termed biocompetitive exclusion [50,51].
Inhibitors for bacterial films
Laboratory tests with quaternary amine additives showed a very low surface col￾onization and lower corrosion rates [52]. On the other hand, the biocidal effect
of quaternary amines in the test fluids appeared to be minimal. These results
suggest that quaternary amines may prevent microbiologically influenced corrosion
by mechanisms other than killing bacteria and that treatments preventing colonization
on the surface may persist longer than most biocides.
Periodic change in ionic strengths
For effective control of microorganisms, it is necessary to take into account the
mechanism of formation of bacteria and the ecologic factors affecting it. The process
of vital activity of bacteria begins with their adsorption on the enclosing rocks and
adaptation to the new habitat conditions. Pure cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria
are not active in crude oil.
Their development in oil reservoirs depends entirely on hydrocarbon-oxidizing
bacteria, which are the primary cause of breakdown of oil. If the ecologic conditions
in the reservoir are changed during formation of the microorganisms, the established
food chains are disrupted and the active development of microflora ceases. It was
experimentally established that the periodic injection of waters markedly differing in
mineralization, taking into account the ecologic characteristics of the formation of the
microorganisms, makes it possible to control biogenic processes in an oil reservoir
without disturbing the sanitary state of the environment [53].288 CHAPTER 5 Bacteria control
5.3 BIOCIDES
Various biocide technologies have been used successfully in water treatment applica￾tions for many years. These include oxidizers, such as chlorine and bromine products,
and non-oxidizing biocides, including isothiazolones, quats, organobromines, and
glutaraldehyde.
Biocides are often misapplied in the petroleum industry. Many of the misapplica￾tions occur because the characteristics of the biocides are not considered before use.
Some guidelines of biocide selection are outlined in a review in the literature [54].
Early detection of microbiologic problems is imperative, and reparative actions must
be taken as soon as possible.
These measurements should include changes in operating methods to prevent
degradation of the operating environment. This might include the rejection of
untreated waters for cleaning deposits in vessels and lines. In general, biocides are
needed to control the activity of the bacteria in a system. However, biocides alone
usually will not solve a microbiologic problem. Five requirements for the bactericide
selection are emphasized [55]:
1. wide bacteria-killing ability and range,
2. noncorrosive property, good inhibiting ability, and convenience for
transportation and application,
3. nontoxic or low toxicity property that causes no damage to human beings and is
within environmental control regulations,
4. good miscibility, with no damage or interference to drilling fluid or its chemical
agents, and
5. bacteria killing effect that is not affected by environmental adaptation of the
bacteria.
5.3.1 VARIOUS BIOCIDES
In Table 5.2 some biocides proposed for bacteria control are summarized. Other
aldehydes and hydroxy compounds are summarized in Table 5.3. In particular,
o-phthalaldehyde is shown in Figure 5.3.
Formaldehyde
Coreflood experiments were used to evaluate the efficacy of periodic formalde￾hyde injection for the control of in situ biogenic reservoir souring. Formaldehyde
treatments were demonstrated to control souring in both environments; if the
formaldehyde can be transported through the reservoir, in situ biogenic souring
should be mitigated.
Glutaraldehyde
Glutaraldehyde is a useful antimicrobial agent, but it is dangerous and unpleasant
to handle and is thermally unstable. Despite these disadvantages, glutaraldehyde5.3 Biocides 289

as an antimicrobial agent [77,78]. The complex is less toxic than free glutaraldehyde.290 CHAPTER 5 Bacteria control

In oil wells, its digestion by the sulfate-reducing bacteria releases the free dialdehyde

use of antimicrobial additives is likely.
Combined chlorine-aldehyde treatment
A combined chlorine-aldehyde treatment that has two stages, chlorination and
subsequent biocide application, has been suggested. Short-residence-time shock
doses of glutaraldehyde have been applied after chlorination [79]. It has been
established that a primary chlorination in overall bacterial control is useful.5.3 Biocides 291
Green biocide enhancer
It is known that ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a synergist for biocides
[80]. However, EDTA is only slowly biodegradable, which is a drawback for
environmental reasons. For this reason, it has been recommended to replace EDTA
in various industrial applications with green chelating agents [81].
Ethylene diamine disuccinate is a biodegradable chelating agent. The structure
is shown in Figure 5.5. The ethylene diamine disuccinate structure contains two
chiral carbon atoms (the CH), and has three stereoisomers ([R,R], [R,S]/[S,R], and
[S,S]). The [S,S]-isomer is rapidly and completely mineralized, in contrast to the
other isomers. Thus, the stereospecificity influences greatly the biodegradation and
the metabolite formation [82].
This chemical has been found to enhance the efficacy of glutaraldehyde in the
treatment of sulfate-reducing bacteria. It has a similar chelation ability as EDTA,
however, it produces no persistent metabolites during biodegradation [82].
It has been demonstrated that by the addition of ethylene diamine disuccinate the
dosage of glutaraldehyde can be considerably reduced to achieve an inhibition of the
growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria [83].
Glutaraldehyde can be problematic because it is hazardous to handle and has
environmental concerns. Moreover, it has been observed that glutaraldehyde can
deleteriously affect the fluid viscosity of the well treatment fluid at elevated
temperatures.
This can be problematic in fracturing applications since the higher maintained
fluid viscosity down hole could hinder the flow back. In addition, glutaraldehyde has
been shown to negatively impact the behavior of oxygen scavengers [84].
Chloromethyl methylisothiazolone compounds are biocides with a broad spec￾trum versus bacteria, algae, and fungi. Isothiazolone biocides have been used
successfully for microbial control and preventing biofouling in industrial water
treatment [85,86].
Isothiazolone biocides are widely used in a variety of industrial water treat￾ment applications for control of microbial growth and biofouling. The most fre￾quently used product is a mixture of 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and
2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one in a ratio of 3:1 with a final concentration of 1.5%.

1,2-Benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT) products have also been used in a limited range of
industrial applications requiring long-term preservation for bacterial control.
Isothiazolone biocides have proven efficacy and performance for microbial
control in a variety of industrial water treatment applications. Understanding
the mechanism of action of industrial biocides is important in optimizing their
use and combating resistance if encountered. Isothiazolones utilizes a two step
mechanism [87]:
1. rapid inhibition of growth and metabolism within minutes and
2. irreversible cell damage within hours resulting in the loss of viability.
The cells are inhibited by disruption of the metabolic pathways involving dehydroge￾nase enzymes. Their critical physiological functions are rapidly inhibited, including
growth, respiration, and ATP synthesis. The death of the cells results from the
destruction of protein thiols and the production of free radicals.
The rate of action and the affectivity may be enhanced by various additives
including surfactants. A technology based on microemulsions has been introduced
using 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one as an algicide.
Oxidizing biocides play a key role in the control of microbial populations and
biofouling in industrial cooling water systems. Bromochlorodimethylhydantoin is an
oxidizing biocide [88].
Several excellent field efficacy studies have been conducted with bro￾mochlorodimethylhydantoin. These studies reveal that the continuous application
of bromochlorodimethylhydantoin that sets free 1-2 ppm of free chlorine is effective
to reduce the concentration of Legionella pneumophila to undetectable levels in
recirculating water.
Bromochlorodimethylhydantoin has also been shown to be effective against a
mixed bacterial biofilm under laboratory conditions. In addition, studies in dy￾namic laboratory systems inoculated with a natural microbial flora revealed that
bromochlorodimethylhydantoin was equally effective against planktonic and biofilm
populations of L. pneumophila. The literature on these issues has been reviewed [88].
Benzotriazole and tolyl triazole are corrosion inhibitors for yellow metals. There
is a controversy concerning the interaction of azoles with halogenated biocides. It is
suspected that in the presence of halogenated biocides may degrade [89].
Some researchers claimed that the inhibitor is rendered ineffective due to this
degradation, other agree that there is an interaction, however, the resulting products
of degradation are still capable of protecting the metal. Laboratory studies have been
presented on these open questions. I has been shown that azoles are not significantly
affected by high concentrations of halogenated biocides, in particular in the presence
of bromine. In fact, the azoles still are performing well when residual inhibitor is
present, even at extremely high dosages of free bromine.
In contrast, azoles have other drawbacks to that most people are not aware. The
triazole moiety is active to achieve adsorption to the metal, resulting in a protective
film on the copper surface. Even when a protective film is formed, there is a need5.3 Biocides 293
to maintain a certain residual level of azole in the aqueous solution. As soon as
the residual azole is removed from solution, the protective film starts to break
down, causing an almost instantaneous increase in corrosion rates. In such cases, the
presence of halogenated biocides only accelerates the rates of corrosion. Protective
films formed by tolyl triazole have been found to be more resistant to breakdown
in aqueous environments. Obviously, the methyl group of the tolyl triazole moiety
causes a steric hindrance.
2-Propenal (acrolein) is known to be a biocide. It is commercially available for
several applications in the oil and gas production industry. However, it has not been
widely used on offshore oil production platforms due to safety concerns.
However, recent advances allow the use of 2-propenal on offshore oil production
platforms with a lower level of risk than conventional biocides [90]. A comparative
case study assesses the risks when using 2-propenal and other biocides. 2-Propenal is
related to conventional biocides applied on an offshore oil production platform, with
respect to efficacy, injection hardware requirements, and associated risk elements.
The sea water as well as the sea water injection system was batch treated weekly
with a biocide, that is, tetrakis hydroxyl methyl phosphonium sulfate, prior to sea
water breakthrough, and glutaraldehyde, and after sea water breakthrough with 2-
propenal, in order to control the biological activity. In later years, the biocide batch
was supplemented with anthraquinone treatments to prolong the time between the
application of glutaraldehyde and 2-propenal, respectively, thereby reducing the costs
of treatment. In summary the results of this study looked promising.
The assumed biocidal mechanism of 2-propenal is the attack of sulfhydryl and
amine groups on bacterial proteins [91]. The reactivity with sulfides renders acrolein
effective as an H2S scavenger and an iron sulfide dissolver. These compounds
are byproducts of the metabolism of sulfate-reducing bacteria. A number of case
histories have been reviewed on the performance of 2-propenal as biocide. Further,
the results of laboratory studies comparing the efficacy of 2-propenal with other
biocides have been compiled.
2-Propenal shows superior performance as biocide against general aerobic and
facultative anaerobic bacteria, as well against sulfate-reducing bacteria. 2-Propenal is
soluble in oil and penetrates biofilms. Therefore, it is a versatile and effective biocide
for use against persistent sessile populations of bacteria. Due to its low minimum
inhibitory concentration, 2-propenal is used not only in batch applications, but also
in continuous treatment programs [91].
Quaternary ammonium based biocides
Quaternary ammonium based biocides have been used for microbiological control
in industrial water systems for a long time. Quaternary ammonium based biocides
which are commonly used are alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride compounds
and dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride compounds.
They have a good performance versus algae, however, they can cause problems
with foaming or they react with anionic additives in an undesired way [92]. In294 CHAPTER 5 Bacteria control
the 1980s quaternary phosphonium compounds, that is, bis[tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)
phosphonium] sulfate came on the market. Quaternary phosphonium based biocides
overcome some of the issues with quaternary ammonium based biocides, however,
they lack of surface activity and are not compatible with halogens. On the other hand,
tributyl tetradecyl phosphonium chloride is unique in that it combines a quaternary
phosphonium group with the long alkyl chain moiety of the quaternary ammonium
biocides in the same molecule.
Tributyl tetradecyl phosphonium chloride is effective at low concentrations.
Further, it is fast acting and effective against a variety of microorganisms, including
L. pneumophila [92]. The excellent surface active properties makes tributyl tetradecyl
phosphonium chloride highly effective for removing biofouling. Together with
halogen based biocides it is still effective. It exhibits low foaming and has a good
compatibility with anionic scale and corrosion inhibitors.
Bis[tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium] sulfate
Offshore oil production is one area in which environmental pollution has been high￾lighted as an issue, particularly in the use of biocides in production waters. Tetrakis￾hydroxymethyl phosphonium salts exhibit acceptable environmental profiles [93],
and they are regarded as the preferred products for bacterial control within the oil
production industry.
The technical developments with respect to the use of bis[tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)
phosphonium] sulfate in oil production applications have been reviewed [94].
Bis[tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium] sulfate was initially applied as an
industrial biocide in cooling systems. From 1987, bis[tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)
phosphonium] sulfate has been used in petroleum production. In fact, it
became the leading biocide where sulfate-reducing bacteria cause problems.
The product acts very fast and is effective for the control of free-swimming
bacteria.
Bis[tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium] sulfate is highly effective in down￾hole applications. In particular, it has been used with great success to control
the biogenic hydrogen sulfide. In numerous wells, the treatment with bis[tetrakis
(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium] sulfate treatment resulted in the dissolution of iron
sulfide, which resulted in an increased oil production.
It has been found that bacteria are protecting themselves from the bis[tetrakis
(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium] sulfate in water by producing a comparatively
hydrophobic layer of poly(saccharide)s. Bis[tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium]
sulfate is shown in Figure 5.6.
In contrast to conventional quaternary biocides, bis[tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)
phosphonium] sulfate does not bear long hydrophobic moieties. Thus, the molecule
is not surface active. Meanwhile, a variety of advanced formulations have been
developed. The effectiveness of bis[tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium] sulfate
can be increased by formulating it with surfactants, such as benzalkonium
chlorides [94].5.3 Biocides 295

Thiones for treatment fluids
Polymeric additives used in well treatment fluids may be subjected to an environment
conducive to bacterial growth and oxidative degradation. The growth of the bacteria
on polymers used in such fluids can materially alter the physical characteristics of
the fluids. For example, bacterial action can degrade the polymer, leading to loss of
viscosity and subsequent ineffectiveness of the fluids [84].
Fluids that are especially susceptible to bacterial degradation are those that
contain poly(saccharide) and synthetic polymers, such as poly(acrylamide)s (PAMs),
poly(glycosan)s, and carboxyalkyl ethers. In addition to bacterial degradation, these
polymers are susceptible to oxidative degradation in the presence of free oxygen.
The degradation can be directly caused by free oxygen or mediated by aerobic
microorganisms.
Thus, PAMs are known to degrade to smaller molecular fragments in the presence
of free oxygen. Therefore, biocides and oxygen scavengers are frequently added to
well treatment fluids in order to control the bacterial growth and the degradation by
oxygen.
Desirably, the biocide is selected to have minimal or no interaction with any of
the components in the well stimulation fluid. For example, the biocide should not
affect fluid viscosity to any significant extent and should not affect the performance
of oxygen scavengers contained within the fluid.
In well stimulation fluids traditionally either glutaraldehyde or bis[tetrakis
(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium] sulfate is used to control the bacterial contam￾ination. Because of environmental concerns, more recently, 2,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-
thiadiazinane-2-thione has been proposed for the substitution of the latter biocides
[84]. Oxygen scavengers are generally chosen from bisulfite salts. Other sulfur
containing compounds are summarized in Table 5.4. Subsequently, halogen
compounds are discussed in some detail.

Bromine chloride
Liquid biocides are popular for the control of microorganisms in industrial water sys￾tems. Concentrated formulations of stabilized bromine chloride have been developed
as biocides [117]. These are generally used for the treatment of industrial water.
The activity of the formulation approaches that of a fresh, bleach while still
delivering the benefits of a stabilized bromine system. In order to achieve a balance
of acceptable low temperature performance, that is, a low freezing point with a good
retention of its activity, computer-designed experiments have been performed.
Chlorine dioxide
Chlorine dioxide has been evaluated as a replacement for chlorine [118]. Gaseous
chlorine as a biocide for industrial applications is declining because of safety and
environmental and community impact considerations. Various alternatives have been
explored, for example, bromo-chlorodimethyl hydantoin, non-oxidizing biocides,
ozone, and chlorine dioxide. Chlorine dioxide offers some unique advantages
because of its selectivity, effectiveness over a wide pH range, and speed of kill. Safety
and cost considerations have restricted its use as a viable replacement.

Effervescent biocide compositions
Compositions of this kind generally include one or more biocidal ingredients
delivered in the form of an effervescent tablet.
It has been discovered that effervescent tablets provide a useful delivery method
for delivering biocidal agents to oilfield fluids because [63]:
1. they alleviate problems encountered with the current mode of choice for
application of dry biocides, that is, water-soluble bags and
2. the effervescent action of the tablet dissolving in the fluid serves to disperse the
biocidal agent in the fluid.300 CHAPTER 5 Bacteria control
In effervescent biocide compositions the particular biocides are selected from
2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilo-propionamide, 1,2-dibromo-2,4-dicyanobutane, 2-bromo-2-
nitro-1,3-propanediol, 4,4-dimethyloxazolidine, 1-(3-chloroallyl)-3,5,7-triaza-1-
azoniaadamantane chloride, and tris(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane [63].
Examples of suitable acids in effervescent tablets are citric, malic, tartaric, adipic,
and fumaric acid. Examples of carbon dioxide delivering compounds include sodium
bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate.

6 Corrosion inhibitors
The history of corrosion inhibitors and neutralizers and their invention, development,
and application in the petroleum industry has been reviewed by Fisher [1]. Early
corrosion inhibitor applications in each of the various segments of the industry,
including oil wells, natural gas plants, refineries, and product pipelines, are reviewed.
6.1 SPECIFIC ISSUES
Corrosion and scale deposition are the two most costly problems in oil industries.
Corrodible surfaces are found throughout production, transport, and refining equip￾ment. The Corrosion and Scale Handbook gives an overview of corrosion problems
and methods of corrosion prevention [2].
In many oilfield operations, the contact of fluids with air is inevitable. A striking
example is the recovery stimulation by in situ combustion. Reducing agents can be
used to remove oxygen. The conditions must be controlled so that oxygen removal
is complete, yet little unreacted excess scavenger remains in the system. In addition,
mechanical scavenging can be accomplished by vacuum deaeration or countercurrent
scrubbing with an oxygen free gas. For economical reasons there are many systems
where a one step corrosion inhibitor would be preferred.
Even when oxygen is not in the corrosion system, oilfield corrosion is associated
with deposition conditions. Iron sulfide or other solid particles can deposit on the
steel surface and prevent corrosion inhibitors from accessing the surface. In some
cases, these deposits can act as harbors for anaerobic bacteria which can also become
involved in the corrosion process. Sulfate-reducing bacteria even produce their own
environment beneath a biofilm that is safe from turbulence and flow velocities. As
the biofilm grows, it forms an exoskeleton, which provides for a growth of sessile
bacteria [3].
Hydrogen sulfide is produced by these bacteria and is released to the protected
environment where it reacts with the dissolved iron from the corrosion process to
form iron sulfide.
Together with poly(saccharide)s and other related molecules present, a semi￾permeable matrix, that is, a biofilm is formed. Within the pores of this biofilm,
the sulfate-reducing bacteria grow and produce locally high concentrations of H2S,
which accelerates the corrosion process and causes severe pitting. Electrochemical

309310 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors
polarization curves had been used to show the particular conditions responsible
for ferrous metal corrosion when oxygen contacts both sour H2S and sweet CO2
production fluids [3].
6.1.1 SWEET CORROSION
Carbon dioxide sweet corrosion is a well known problem in gas production. Carbon
dioxide dissolves in brine to form carbonic acid that ionizes to yield a low pH value.
The resulting acidic solution strongly enhances the corrosion in carbon steel pipes
and facilities. The presence of carbon dioxide would lead to corrosion rates of several
mm/year if no proper corrosion protection methods would be undertaken [4].
6.1.2 ABSORPTION OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE
Brine and oil absorb hydrogen sulfide (H2S) under pressure in the underground oil
reservoir and then undergo a decompression during the extraction process, during
which a certain amount of H2S is released from the liquid phase [5]. Experimental
data have been reported, how much of the corrosive gas is absorbed into different
brine/oil mixtures with 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% water cuts.
Different reservoir-simulation scenarios were created at 20 atm and 70 atm at
room temperature. H2S gas concentration was varied as tests were conducted with
50 ppm, 100 ppm, and 300 ppm in nitrogen.
The experiments were carried out in an autoclave system that simulates the
hydrostatic process that occurs inside a reservoir. It is found that for all water cuts, the
total pressure plays only a minor role in the absorption phenomena when the initial
H2S concentration is increased. In addition, the highest mass-absorption ratios are
found at lower H2S concentrations [5].
6.1.3 HYDROGEN SULFIDE SCAVENGERS
Triazines and glyoxal are among the most common hydrogen sulfide scavengers in
the oil and gas industries [6]. However, these scavengers might not be useful. For
example, intractable solids can be formed when using triazines as an H2S scavenging
additive.
Zinc compounds, such as zinc oxide or zinc carbonate, have been found to be
effective when used as H2S scavenging additives [6]. At pH levels greater than 10,
solid zinc scavengers can affect the rheological and filtration properties of the drilling
fluid. As a result, zincate can be formed and carbonate can be released [7]. A major
disadvantage of using zinc scavengers is the potential environmental concerns that
relate to using zinc-containing compounds.
In another study, it was shown that iron-gluconate is an environmentally friendly
scavenger for H2S in drilling fluids [8,9]. However, further studies revealed that
triazine-based scavengers are still better than iron-gluconate in removing H2S, since
triazine-based scavengers can remove twice the amount of H2S when compared
to iron-gluconate, and therefore the overall cost of the H2S removal process is6.2 Corrosion: Application of chicory as corrosion inhibitor 311
significantly reduced when triazine-based scavengers are used instead of iron￾gluconate [10].
A drilling fluid composition has been developed that includes an aqueous base
fluid, a viscosifier, and a H2S scavenger from copper nitrate [6]. The presence
of copper nitrate provides a high H2S sorption capacity of the drilling fluid
composition without substantially affecting rheological properties of the drilling fluid
composition.
In addition to copper nitrate, the H2S scavenger may further include at least one
copper-containing compound selected from the group consisting of a copper sulfate,
a copper molybdate, a copper oxide, a copper hydroxide, a copper halide, a copper
carbonate, a copper hydroxy carbonate, a copper carboxylate, a copper phosphate,
and hydrates and derivatives thereof.
The H2S scavenger can be present in the drilling fluid composition at a mass
concentration ranging from 0.38 to 76 kg m−3 (0.1-20 lbm bbl−1) of the drilling fluid
composition [6].
6.1.4 PREDICTING INHIBITED EROSION CORROSION
Chemical inhibition is a common method for controlling erosion corrosion in
offshore mild steel pipelines, tubing, and pipe fittings. When sand is produced, sand
particle impingement on piping surfaces can decrease the efficiency of corrosion
protection systems, such as iron-carbonate scale formation or chemical inhibition,
and can result in severe corrosion and even pitting.
A method for predicting the inhibited erosion corrosion in mild steel pipes,
including the effects of flow and environmental conditions, sand production, and
an oil phase has been presented [11]. The Frumkin isotherm showed the best fit to
experimental data for an imidazoline-based inhibitor used in sand-free conditions.
Flow-loop tests indicated that sand particle erosion decreased the efficiency of the
inhibitor. However, Frumkin isotherms that were modified to handle the effects of
erosivity, temperature, and oil phase could be successfully fitted to erosion corrosion
data. Inhibitor adsorption isotherms, for both sand-free and sand production condi￾tions, were integrated into a mechanistic model for the prediction of CO2 corrosion
rates as a function of the inhibitor concentration, and good results could be obtained
when compared with experimental data [11].
Thus, it was found that the inhibitor adsorption isotherm, modified to handle the
effects of sand production, temperature, and oil phase, can be a valuable tool for
predicting inhibited metal loss rates under sand production conditions [11].
6.2 CORROSION: APPLICATION OF CHICORY AS CORROSION
INHIBITOR FOR ACIDIC ENVIRONMENTS
During acidizing stimulation or cleanup operations, metal tubulars, downhole tools,
and surface lines are exposed to acidic fluids and are prone to corrosion. Because312 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors
corrosion rates drastically increase in high-temperature wells, controlling corrosion
is critical and must be dealt with carefully.
Several corrosion inhibitors, such as quaternary ammonium compounds or
propargyl alcohol based compounds, have been effectively used.
However, because of stringent environmental regulations, attention has focused
on the development of new corrosion inhibitors that are environmentally benign.
Food-grade products that are considered a green chemicals and have a significant
potential as corrosion inhibitors in the oil and gas industry.
The application of chicory as a corrosion inhibitor for high-temperature and
strong-acidic conditions has been studied [12].
Chicory is a perennial bush plant available in many parts of the world. The root
of the chicory plant can be roasted and ground for use as a coffee substitute or
additive. Chicory is environmentally acceptable and, being of plant origin, is widely
recognized as biodegradable in nature.
It could be established that chicory can provide corrosion protection for alloys
such as N-80, 13Cr-L80, and 1010 steel in the presence of either inorganic or organic
acids at temperatures up to 120 ◦C [12].
Considering its performance and its lack of toxicity issues, chicory has a
significant potential for acid corrosion-inhibition applications [12].
6.3 CLASSIFICATION OF CORROSION INHIBITORS
Corrosion inhibitors have been divided into many groups, such as [13]:
• cathodic and anodic inhibitors,
• inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors, or
• filming and non-filming inhibitors.
Low molecular weight corrosion inhibitors often change the surface tension of
water. Actually these groups are acting as surfactants, as they form a protective layer
on the metal surfaces [13]. Polymeric corrosion inhibitors act in the same way as
ordinary low molecular weight inhibitors.
Polymeric film forming corrosion inhibitors are different from polymer coatings
as they exhibit a specific interaction with the surface before the dry film is formed.
Polymeric corrosion inhibitors may not form a barrier layer against oxygen and water.
Instead they change the corrosion potential of the metal [13].
From the chemists’s view, corrosion inhibitors can be classified into the following
broad groupings:
• amides and imidazolines,
• salts of nitrogenous molecules with carboxylic acids, that is, fatty acids and
naphthenic acids),
• nitrogen quaternaries,
• polyoxylated amines, amides, imidazolines, and
• nitrogen heterocyclics.6.4 Fields of application 313
6.4 FIELDS OF APPLICATION
Corrosion problems may occur in numerous systems within the petroleum industry.
These include:
• acid stimulation jobs,
• cooling systems,
• drilling muds,
• oil production units,
• oil storage tanks,
• protection of pipelines,
• refinery units,
• scale removal treatments using acids,
• steam generators, and
• technologic vessels.
Many compositions involve environmentally dangerous products, such as chro￾mates, fatty amines of high molecular weights, imidazolines, etc. The use of some of
the alternatives, for instance, poly(phosphate) or polyphosphonate, is limited because
they precipitate in the presence of the salts of alkaline earth metals or because of their
high costs.
6.4.1 ACIDIZATION
Acidization is an oil reservoir stimulation technique for increasing well productivity.
Stainless steels are being used successfully to combat hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and
carbon dioxide (CO2) corrosion. However, they are susceptible to hydrochloric acid
(HCl). HCl is used in oil and gas production to stimulate the formation.
The downhole temperature may be in excess of 200 ◦C in deep wells. The
acid treatment occurs through steel tubes. This process requires a high degree of
corrosion inhibition. Electrochemical measurements are nonpredictive in inhibited
concentrated HCl at high temperatures [14].
6.4.2 OIL STORAGE TANKS
Storage tank bottoms have been protected from corrosion through the use of cathodic
protection. In general, this method is successful. However, problems arise when there
is no complete contact with the soil. This occurs when the bottom buckles slightly,
leaving air spaces with filling or emptying of the tank. Over time, a portion of the
base may erode away. In either case, the electrical continuity is lost. Other methods
of protection, such as protective coatings, are not suitable.
When the bottom plates are welded together, the coating is partially destroyed.
Research and field work showed that protection can be achieved using volatile
corrosion inhibitors under the tank [15]. This works alone or in combination with
cathodic protection.314 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors
Double tank bottoms for leakage monitoring are often specified for new tanks.
However, the same problem of coating destruction occurs. Volatile corrosion in￾hibitors are an excellent solution from both a technical and an economic standpoint.
This type of corrosion inhibitor has a long history of corrosion protection under the
conditions of wet, corrosive environments in void spaces.
6.4.3 PIPELINES
The normal industrial practice for controlling the internal corrosion of petroleum
pipelines is to use coatings, nonmetallic pipeline materials, or corrosion inhibitors.
Corrosion inhibitors, which are used for the protection of oil pipelines, are often
complex mixtures.
The consequences of pipeline failure caused by corrosion can include inventory
loss, production shutdown, environmental damage, safety risks, and excessive
repair and replacement costs [16]. Chemical treatment can delay or inhibit internal
corrosion of a pipeline so that the line can fulfill its operating requirements over its
design life.
Using pigs for corrosion inhibitor application is particularly useful in gas and gas￾condensate transmission pipelines, especially in multiphase flow service. Selecting a
pig for inhibitor batching is based on the pig’s ability to create a good seal between
the pig cups and the pipe wall. The thickness of the film deposited during inhibition
must be known to correctly size the slug inhibitor. Epoxide resins with aromatic
amines are used as coatings for pipelines [17–19].
6.4.4 PRODUCTION WELLS
Unalloyed or low-alloyed steels of various strength are generally used in the
production of oil and gas. Inhibitors must be injected into the borehole to increase
the life of well casing, flow lines, and equipment of unalloyed and low-alloyed steels
in corrosive media. If the inhibitor is improperly chosen, considerable corrosion
damage may result, such as damage without hydrogen influence and hydrogen￾induced damage in the presence of H2S.
Agitator autoclave tests can be used as screening tests despite the more intensive
localized corrosion attack and the generally greater erosion rates in field tests. This
test method elucidates the influences of certain test parameters including temperature,
H2S/CO2 ratio, and flow rate [20].
6.4.5 SCALE REMOVAL TREATMENTS USING ACIDS
Acids injected downhole for scale removal treatments are extremely corrosive to the
production tubing and casing liners. Inhibitors are added to the stimulation fluids
to minimize this corrosion. The effectiveness of inhibitors can be estimated with
laboratory screening methods [21].6.6 Characterization 315
6.5 APPLICATION TECHNIQUES
The application techniques include batch application and continuous application.
6.5.1 BATCH APPLICATION VERSUS CONTINUOUS APPLICATION
Batch treatment of pipelines with liquid or gel slugs of inhibitor, with continuous
injection as a backup (or vice versa), are accepted methods of corrosion preven￾tion [22]. Batching liquid or gel inhibitors using pigs is more likely to attain
complete coverage of the internal surface of the pipe wall than is continuous
injection.
The film laid down is quite resilient and of long duration. Important factors
to optimize the application include determining film thickness and selecting an
appropriate pigging system and program. Cleaning of the pipeline before inhibitor
pigging is recommended.
6.5.2 EMULSIONS
Corrosion inhibitors are often emulsions that are able to form an organic film on the
parts to be protected.
6.5.3 APPLICATION IN SOLID FORM
The preparation of a corrosion inhibitor in the solid form allows the development
of a new technique of continuous intensive anticorrosive protection for gas and
oil pipelines, as well as for acidizing operations of oil wells [23]. The controlled
dissolution of the solid inhibitor creates a thin protective layer on the metallic surface
that prevents or at least minimizes the undesirable corrosion reactions.
6.6 CHARACTERIZATION
The common method of treating rod-pumped wells is to periodically batch the
inhibitor into them. The treatment period for a given well is selected using empirical
rules based on well production volumes. A successful and economic corrosion
inhibition program must carefully control the inhibitor concentration in the well
fluids.
Environmental aspects and efficacious inhibitor usage necessitate the measure￾ment of very low corrosion inhibitor concentrations. Inhibitor concentrations as low
as one part per million are significant, thus requiring an analytic technique with a
detection limit of a fraction of a part per million.
Accurate monitoring the residual concentrations of the inhibitors is most im￾portant in systems in which the volume of water is unknown or is highly variable.
Frequent monitoring of the inhibitor concentration in the water exiting the pipeline is
the simplest method, and sometimes the only method that can be used to ensure that
the line in fact is being protected.316 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors
6.6.1 DYE TRANSFER METHOD
The classic method for the determination of corrosion inhibitors in oilfield brines is
the dye transfer method. This method is basically sensitive to amines. Within this
method, there are many variations that the analyst may use to determine the amount
of corrosion inhibitor in either water or crude oil. Unfortunately these methods detect
all amines present as corrosion inhibitors [24].
6.6.2 LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY
Improved high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods have been
developed for the analysis of quaternary salt type corrosion inhibitors in brine waters
[25]. However, these conventional methods are not suitable for imidazolines and
amido amines. A method based on fluorescence detection has been described for
the quantitative analysis of the imidazoline-type and amido amine type corrosion
inhibitors in both oil field water and crude oil samples by HPLC [24].
Another analytic procedure based on HPLC has been developed for the
quantitative determination of nitrogen containing corrosion inhibitors [26]. The
method was primarily developed for the analysis of certain oil pipeline condensate
samples.
A fully automated instrumental procedure has been developed for analyzing
residual corrosion inhibitors in production waters in the field. The method uses
ultraviolet and fluorescence spectrophotometric techniques to characterize different
types of corrosion inhibitors.
Laboratory evaluations showed that fluorescence is more suitable for field
application because errors from high salinity, contamination, and matrix effects
are minimized in fluorescence analysis. Comparison of the automated fluorescence
technique with the classic extraction-dye transfer technique showed definite advan￾tages of the former with respect to ease, speed, accuracy, and precision [27].
6.6.3 THIN LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY
With thin layer chromatography, attempts have been made to analyze amounts of
residual inhibitors down to below the parts-per-million region [28].
6.6.4 ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPY
UV spectroscopy can be used to detect low levels of organic corrosion inhibitors
in produced water. An analytic method has been developed using a diode array UV
spectrophotometer [29].
6.6.5 CORROSION TESTS
Immersion tests, weathering, electrochemical measurements, and microscopy are
used to monitor the effect of different classes of organic inhibitors and their synergy
with other additives [13].6.6 Characterization 317
Standard procedures have been developed to remove corrosion products without
significant removal of the base metal layer. This allows an accurate determination
of the mass loss of the metal or alloy that occurred during exposure to a corrosive
environment [30].
Electrochemical measurements of the corrosion rate often provide results in terms
of an electrical current or electrical resistance. Although the conversion of these
current values into mass loss rates or penetration rates is based on the law of Faraday,
the calculations can be complicated for alloys and metals with elements having
multiple valence values. Guidance in calculating mass loss and penetration rates for
such alloys has been provided. Some typical values of equivalent weights for a variety
of metals and alloys have been compiled [31].
There is a standard that specifies the mechanisms of corrosion and the parameters
for the selection of materials for pipes, tubes and equipment for the transport and
processing of hydrocarbons. Guidelines are given for [32]:
1. corrosion assessments,
2. choice of materials for specific applications and systems,
3. performance of specific materials, and
4. corrosion tests.
Standards concerning materials for use in H2S-containing environments in oil and
gas production have been provided [33–35].
6.6.6 MICELLE CONCENTRATION
The measurement of the micelle concentration has been discussed as a corrosion
management in order to maintain the optimum dose of the corrosion inhibitor [36].
Film forming corrosion inhibitors typically contain active ionic surfactant
molecules, which adsorb on the surfaces and thus form a protective barrier against
corrosion. Upon saturation of the surfaces by the inhibitor, the inhibitor molecules
are found in the aqueous phase as micelles, or in the oil phase as reverse micelles,
respectively. It has been argued that the presence of these micelles in the water phase
could be used to indicate the total surface coverage and, therefore, the optimum dose
can be found.
Laboratory experiments have been performed to simulate an inhibited multiphase
production system. Fluorescent markers, which are extremely sensitive to micelle
presence, have been developed and used during the tests. The results were compared
with those from conventional laboratory techniques, such as interfacial tension and
particle-size analysis. Also corrosion bubble tests were used to compare the inhibitor
efficiency. Fluorescence analysis suggested that micelles formed starting at a dose of
150 ppm. The particle-size analysis was consistent with micelle presence beyond this
concentration.
The comparison of the different analytical techniques supported the underlying
principles of the micelle detection technology. It has been suggested to develop a
portable device as new tool for corrosion management [36].318 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors
6.7 SIDE EFFECTS
6.7.1 STABILIZER FOR EMULSIONS
Some corrosion inhibitors have a side effect of stabilizing emulsions. This is
sometimes undesirable.
6.7.2 ANTISYNERGISM WITH ALCOHOLS
In stimulation fluids containing concentrated HCl, the partial substitution of water
by alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and glycerol increases the corrosivity of the
acid fluids and reduces the efficiency of the corrosion inhibitors [37]. This effect
is especially important for fatty amine based inhibitors. For products containing
acetylenic-type inhibitors the detrimental effect is less important and a weight loss
may be maintained within acceptable limits using slightly higher, but still reasonable,
levels of inhibitor.
6.7.3 SYNERGISM WITH SURFACTANTS
Certain surfactants greatly improve the performance of trans-cinnamaldehyde as a
corrosion inhibitor for steel in HCl [38–40]. They act by enhancing the adsorption
at the surface. Increased solubility or dispersibility of the inhibitor is an inciden￾tal effect. N-dodecylpyridinium bromide is effective in this aspect far below its
critical micelle concentration, probably as a result of electrostatic adsorption of
N-dodecylpyridinium bromide.
This leads to the formation of a hydrophobic monolayer, which attracts the
inhibitor. On the other hand, an ethoxylated nonyl phenol acts by incorporating the
inhibitor into micelles, which themselves adsorb on the steel surface and facilitate
the adsorption of trans-cinnamaldehyde.
6.7.4 INTERACTIONS WITH KINETIC GAS HYDRATE INHIBITORS
Gas hydrate inhibitors are often added together with corrosion inhibitors. Frequently,
a lack of immediate compatibility of the gas hydrate inhibitor and the corrosion
protector in the course of formulation may occur.
It has been discovered that quaternary alkylaminoalkyl alkoxy esters and amides,
respectively, exhibit both an excellent performance as corrosion inhibitors and gas
hydrate inhibitors. Also an improved film persistence and good biodegradability is
observed [41].
The general method for the preparation of alkylaminoalkyl alkoxy monoesters
from dicarboxylic anhydrides has been described in detail [41,42]. The anhydride is
heated in nitrogen atmosphere with an alkoxylated alkylenediamine. For example,
N,N-dibutylamino-N-tri(ethoxy)ethyl dodecenyl-tetradecenylsuccinate is obtained
from dodecenyl-tetradecenylsuccinic anhydride and ethoxylated dibutylamine. The
method is also suitable for polymer analogue synthesis. Eventually, the products are
quaternized with dimethyl sulfate.6.8 Inhibitor chemicals 319
As a consequence of their ester and amide structure, these compounds have better
biodegradability and can be used at a lower dosage [41]. A series of compounds has
been synthesized and tested both as gas hydrate inhibitors and corrosion inhibitors.
There are interactions of kinetic gas hydrate inhibitors and corrosion inhibitors.
Two theories concerning the interaction of kinetic gas hydrate inhibitors and
corrosion inhibitors have been developed and tested. The first theory assumes a
competition of the kinetic gas hydrate inhibitor and the corrosion inhibitor at the
surface interface. This can be elucidated by measurements of the surface tension.
The second theory deals with absorption of the corrosion inhibitor onto a polymeric
kinetic gas hydrate inhibitor.
One commercial available kinetic gas hydrate inhibitor, poly(vinylcaprolactam)
and three commercial available corrosion inhibitors, cocodimethyl benzyl ammo￾nium chloride, amino ethyl fatty imidazoline, and an ethyoxylated phosphate ester
have been used for testing [43].
The corrosion inhibitors had a varying negative impact on the kinetic gas hydrate
inhibitor. However, the results from the corrosion testing indicate only a minimal
interference of the performances. The efficiency of all corrosion inhibitors tested
have been found to be dependent on the structure of the polymer [43]. Thus, the
second theory (absorption) is more sound.
6.7.5 EFFECT OF FLOW ON INHIBITOR FILM LIFE
Experiments with low-velocity and high-velocity conditions were performed in
standard laboratory tests [44]. It was found that corrosion is governed by the flow
of the reactants and the products to and from the corroding surface. Corrosion in
oxygenated fluids is increased with the velocity of the fluid because a greater amount
of oxygen is made available to the surface. Corrosion of steel in fluids containing CO2
produces a protective iron carbonate film that initially results in decreased corrosion.
However, at high velocities the protective layers are broken off, thus exposing the
bare metal to the aggressive medium and increasing the corrosion rate. Inhibitor films
are protective, because they reduce transfer rate of the corrosants. Inhibitor films can
become ineffective because of aging, removal, and dilution. In all of the previous
examples the velocity is an important variable, governing the ability of the inhibitor
to control the corrosion rate.
6.8 INHIBITOR CHEMICALS
6.8.1 AMIDES AND IMIDAZOLINES
Amides
An amide-type corrosion inhibitor is prepared as follows: methyl methacrylate is
converted with tallow triamine or tallow tetramine at 80-90 ◦C into the corresponding
amides. After completion, the temperature is raised to initiate the polymerization
reaction [45]. The polymerization reaction is performed at temperatures up to 200 ◦C.320 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors

The polymer controls the corrosion of metal surfaces in contact with a corrosive
hydrocarbon-containing medium.
Ammonium salts of alkenyl succinic half-amides have been described for their
use as corrosion inhibitors in oil and gas production technology to combat corrosion
by media containing CO2, H2S, and elemental sulfur [46]. The inhibitor composition
may contain a dispersing agent, such as a low molecular weight or polymeric anionic
surfactant like an alkylsulfonic acid or an alkyl-aryl sulfonic acid.
Ethoxylated and propoxylated alkyl phenolamines, converted into the amides
with a fatty acid or similar long chain diacids, are effective in controlling sour and
sweet corrosion [47–51]. Properties of fatty acids are shown in Table 6.1. Some acids
are shown in Figure 6.1.
Tall oil is a waste product from paper making industry. Tall oil derivates have
been proposed as alterative biofuel materials [52]. Tall oil fatty acids consist of

shown in Table 6.2.
Poly(imido amine)s
Corrosion inhibiting compositions for metals subjected to highly acidic environments
may be produced by reacting in a condensation reaction of a styrene/maleic anhydride
(MA) copolymer with a poly(amine) to produce a poly(imido amine) inhibitor [54].
Such inhibitors exhibit a film forming characteristics. Some relevant poly(amine)s
are listed in Table 6.3. Diamines are shown in Figure 6.2.

Polypeptides
Polypeptides have been under consideration as corrosion inhibitors because of
environmental concerns [55]. Poly(aspartate) is the most efficient corrosion inhibitor
known among the polypeptides [56]. The molecular weight (1-22 kDa) does not
affect the efficiency, instead both high calcium ion and high pH enhance the
effectiveness. The performance is particularly good in batch treatment tests.
In another study, poly(aspartic acid) was examined as a corrosion inhibitor
for steel as a function of pH and temperature [57]. At low to neutral pH values,
poly(aspartic acid) increases the corrosion rate of steel. At pH values above 10,
poly(aspartic acid) is a reasonably robust corrosion inhibitor.
Ampholytes
Corrosion inhibitors used in offshore oil production are highly cationic. However, the
use of such cationic-based corrosion inhibitors for offshore oil platforms is becoming
less acceptable for environmental reasons. Cationic inhibitors are attracted to metal
surfaces, thereby controlling the acid type corrosion. When these cationic corrosion
inhibitors enter sea water, they are attracted to a particular type of algae, diatoms.
These algae are part of a food-chain for mussels.
The cationic inhibitors inhibit the growth of these algae. Betaines, c.f. Figure 6.3,
and ampholytes [58] can be used instead of cationic inhibitors or can be neutralized
with acids such as acetic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, naphthenic acids, paraffinic
acids, tall oil acids, and free sulfur dioxide. They are claimed to prevent CO2
corrosion.
Slow-release formulation
An amido amine obtained from the reaction of tetraethylenepentamine with stearic
acid is modified with propylene oxide [59]. The product is dispersed in a polymer
matrix such as an acrylic or methacrylic polymer. This inhibitor is slowly released
into the surrounding environment, such as in an oil or gas well, to prevent corrosion
of metal equipment in the well.
6.8.2 SALTS OF NITROGENOUS BASES
A corrosion inhibitor with excellent film forming and persistency characteristics is
produced by first reacting C18 unsaturated fatty acids with MA or fumaric acid to6.8 Inhibitor chemicals 323
produce the fatty acid Diels-Alder adduct or the fatty acid-ene reaction product [60].
This reaction product is further reacted in a condensation or hydrolyzation reaction
with a polyalcohol to form an acid anhydride ester corrosion inhibitor. The ester may
be reacted with amines, metal hydroxides, metal oxides, ammonia, and combinations
thereof to neutralize the ester.
Surfactants may be added to tailor the inhibitor formulation to meet the specific
needs of the user, that is, the corrosion inhibitor may be formulated to produce
an oil soluble, highly water-dispersible corrosion inhibitor or an oil-dispersible,
water-soluble corrosion inhibitor. Suitable carrier solvents may be used as needed
to disperse the corrosion inhibitor formulation.
Similarly, a salt of an ethoxylated amine and a reaction product of an alcohol and
a fatty acid MA adduct produced by a reaction between MA and an unsaturated fatty
acid has been described [61].
6.8.3 NITROGEN QUATERNARIES
Quaternary ammonium iodides were tested alone and in combination with propar￾gyl alcohol with several steels in 15% HCl. The quaternary ammonium iodides
showed superior inhibitor performance to that of propargyl alcohol (propargyl
−CH2−C≡CH) at identical dosage levels. Mixtures of propargyl alcohol and
quaternary ammonium iodide showed a synergistic effect [62], as did formic acid
[63] and thiols [64].
It has been shown that the corrosion rates of various steels can be reduced to
less than 1 mg cm−2hr−1 using ternary inhibitor mixtures containing quaternary
ammonium salts, trans-cinnamaldehyde, and potassium iodide in amounts of 0.2%
of each component [65].
Thio-substituted salts
A thio-substituted, quaternary ammonium salt can be synthesized by the Michael
addition of an alkyl thiol to acrylamide (AAm) in the presence of benzyl trimethyl
ammonium hydroxide as a catalyst [66–68]. The reaction leads to the crystallization
of the adducts in essentially quantitative yield.
Reduction of the amides by lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran solution
produces the desired amines, which are converted to desired halide by reaction of the
methyl iodide with the amines. The inhibitor is useful in controlling corrosion such
as that caused by CO2 and H2S.
Synergism of thiosulfate
Laboratory observations have revealed that a combination of thiosulfate with cationic
nitrogenous inhibitors has a significant effect on improving their performance [69].324 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors
6.8.4 POLYOXYLATED AMINES, AMIDES, AND IMIDAZOLINES
A mixture of alkyl-ethylene diamine and di-alkyl-diethylene triamine, with an alkyl
side chain of 8-26 carbon atoms is suitable [70] as a corrosion inhibitor. This product
can be further reacted with an alkylating agent or an alkylene oxide [71,72].
The inorganic nitrite used as a corrosion inhibitor in aqueous alkylene glycol
or poly(alkylene glycol) solutions can be replaced with poly(oxyalkylene amine)s
[73,74]. Such poly(oxyalkylene amine)s impart corrosion inhibition to the liquid
in contact with the metal and the metal in contact with the vapors of the aqueous
composition. Aqueous compositions containing the glycol and the polyoxyalkylene
amine also exhibit a low foaming tendency.
Mercaptan modified products
In highly acidic environments a reaction product of an isobutyraldehyde and an
alkylene amine compound with an alkylsulfopropionic amide group is recom￾mended [75,76]. The alkylene amine compound can be the product of a reaction
of equimolar amounts of N-dodecylmercaptan, methyl methacrylate, and diethylene
triamine.
Poly(amine) derivatives
Fatty amine adducts
Dimerized fatty acid thioesters (with a dithiol) in combination with fatty amines
are sulfur containing corrosion inhibitors [77]. The corrosion inhibitor solvent is
preferably a hydrocarbon.
Adducts of a fatty amine adduct to unsaturated acid in which the product
contains only secondary or tertiary amine groups that have a lower toxicity to the
environment [78].
Adducts to polymers
Polymeric polyolefins, such as poly(butadiene), secondary amines, and synthesis gas,
are reacted in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a ruthenium-containing
compound, a rhodium-containing compound, a sterically hindered phosphine, and a
solvent [79].
Preferred poly(butadiene) feed-stocks are those with a predominance of main
chain, rather than pendant olefin groups and in particular, those polymers containing
both the 1,2-poly(butadiene) and 1,4-poly(butadiene) units. These polymers of high
amine content are useful as downhole corrosion inhibitors.
A low molecular weight, polyfunctional polymer can be formed by polymerizing
a vinyl monomer in the presence of a mercaptan chain transfer agent [80]. The vinyl
monomer may be an unsaturated acid, acrylonitrile, vinylester, a variety of AAms,
or N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone. The molar ratio of the vinyl monomer to the mercaptan is
preferably in the range of 2-40 mol of the vinyl monomer to 1 mole of the mercaptan.
The composition and methods are useful for inhibiting corrosion of downhole
metal surfaces present in oil and gas wells. Relevant vinyl monomers are shown in

Formaldehyde condensates with amines
Corrosion inhibitor compositions useful for oil and gas well applications are prepared
by reacting 2,5-dimethylpyridine or 2,4,6-collidine with formaldehyde or acetone
and an amine such as 1-dodecanamine [81,82]. A hydrocarbon soluble corrosion
inhibitor is obtained by the acid-catalyzed oligomerization of an alkylaniline and
formaldehyde [83].
These oligomers exhibit good initial inhibition of metal corrosion in aqueous en￾vironments, and this effect is more persistent than that observed for the corresponding
monoamine starting material. Moreover, in an acidic environment, the products show
superior persistence in inhibiting corrosion when compared with known monoamine
corrosion inhibitors, such as tallow amine.
The oligomers can be formulated to be both hydrocarbon soluble and water￾dispersible. The water dispersibility can be controlled by varying the type and amount
of the additional aromatic compound, such as ethoxylated alkyl phenol, included in
the oligomerization reaction mixture [85].
A corrosion inhibitor which is the adduct of a carbonyl compound, an amine,
and a thiocyanate has been described [86]. The product provides protection against
ferrous corrosion in severe environments. 500 ppm is sufficient. The inhibitor is
employed in wells that produce both oil as well as water in high-temperature
environments around 120 ◦C.
Lignin amines
Lignin amines with high nitrogen content are water soluble at both alkaline and
acidic pH values. The lignin amines have various useful properties. For example, they
are active as flocculants, filtration aids, scale inhibitors, fluid loss additives, oil well
cement additives, and corrosion inhibitors among other potential uses. The nitrogen
is introduced into the lignins with the Mannich reaction [87].
Amido amine salts
Amido amine salts have been found to be effective corrosion inhibitors. These
compositions are essentially environmentally friendly. They are used in formate
solutions, so far as the high pH environment does not hydrolyze the amido group.326 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors

Diels-Alder reaction of a conjugated unsaturated fatty acid [84].
The compounds can be prepared by the reaction of amines with a fatty acid. For
example, soya fatty acid can be reacted with N-ethyl ethylene diamine by heating to
150 ◦C for a period of 4 h. The reaction product is then solubilized by forming the
salts with acetic acid [88].
Tenax 2010 (Westvaco) is a commercial available inhibitor, which is obtained
from the Diels-Alder reaction of MA and a fatty acid and subsequently with amines.
The amido diacid is solubilized with 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol or ethanolamine.
The reaction is shown schematically in Figure 6.5.
Fatty acid amides
Propargyl alcohol has been found to be active in corrosion control, and a variety of
formulations with propargyl alcohol have been proposed. Propargyl alcohol is shown
in Figure 6.6.
A condensate of a poly(amine), such as diethylene triamine, triethylenetetramine,
or amino ethylethanolamine, with C21 or C22 carbon fatty acids or tall oil fatty acids
can be used as corrosion inhibitor base [89]. Propargyl alcohol has been found to
enhance the anticorrosive effects of the composition.6.8 Inhibitor chemicals 327

Most simply, a mixture of mainly 80-90% propargyl alcohol and cellosolve, with
minor amounts of polyglycol, amine derivatives, a phenol-formaldehyde resin, and
tar bases, has been described [90,91].
Instead of propargyl alcohol, propargyl ether has been proposed to be used as a
corrosion inhibitor. Propargyl alcohol is added to olefins to form the corresponding
ether [92].
Fatty acid amides of isophorone diamine, 2,5-diaminonorbornylene, and 2,2,4-
trimethyl-1,6-diaminohexane are particularly suitable for high-temperature and high￾pressure applications [93]. The respective compounds are shown in Figure 6.7.
6.8.5 NITROGEN HETEROCYCLICS
Hexamethylenetramine
Acetylenic alcohols such as propargyl alcohol, 1-hexyn-3-ol, and 5-decyne-4,7-diol
have been used as corrosion inhibitors in HCl for the protection of ferrous metals.
However, acetylenic alcohols are expensive and their use at high temperatures, in the
range of 80-180 ◦C has been limited by the high concentrations of acetylenic alcohols
needed to achieve the desired corrosion protection [94].
The presence of a small amount of hexamethylenetetramine with acetylenic al￾cohols dramatically improves the performance of the acetylenic alcohols in reducing
corrosion and enables the use of these alcohols at lower concentrations or higher
temperatures than when used alone. Hexamethylenetetramine also acts as a sulfide
scavenger, whereby the formation of free sulfur or the formation of ferrous sulfide
precipitate is prevented.
In addition to acetylenic alcohols and hexamethylenetetramine, the metal cor￾rosion inhibiting compositions can also include solvents. The formation of ferric
hydroxide precipitate, free sulfur, and other precipitates can be prevented.
Imidazolines
Quaternized imidazolines with an amido moiety are suitable corrosion inhibiting
formulations for general oil and gas field applications. The synthesis of such
compounds is detailed in the literature [95]. For aqueous systems that contain sulfide
compounds, a mixture has been described that consists of an aqueous solution of
an alcohol such as diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, butyl cellosolve, additional328 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors

orthophosphoric acid, a tall oil fatty acid, a substituted imidazoline, an ethoxylated
fatty diamine, and a molybdate compound [96].
A modification of the previous formulation uses amine products containing
preferably only tertiary amino groups [97]. These amines have favorable ecotoxicity
levels in marine or fresh water environments. The ecotoxicity decreases with
increasing substitutions on the nitrogen atoms present. It appears that tertiary
groups are less toxic than secondary groups, which are in turn less toxic than
primary groups. Combinations of imidazoles with wetting agents also have been
described [98].
Water-soluble corrosion inhibitors are necessary to prevent corrosion of the pipe
walls, joints, pumps, and collection stations. An ampholytic, substituted imidazoline
has been described for inhibiting corrosion in such systems [99]. This type of
corrosion inhibitor is intended for continuous treatment.
Pourable emulsions comprising up to 50% of a kerosene-containing corrosion in￾hibiting compound have been claimed to allow longer treatment intervals [100,101].
A formulation that is resistant to sludge formation and does not tend to stabilize
oil water emulsions when added to oil and water systems has been described in
the literature. An imidazoline derivate, prepared from a long chain fatty acid and6.8 Inhibitor chemicals 329
a poly(amine), is dissolved in an aromatic solvent and dispersed with glycolic acid
and hexylene glycol [102].
In water systems, sulfate-reducing bacteria and sulfides are present. To prevent
their growth, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is added. However, ClO2 is highly corrosive
to the metallic components used in oilfield equipment. Chromates are successful
ClO2 corrosion inhibitors. However, chromates are also undesirable because of
their high toxicity. As an alternative for chromates, a mixture of an alcohol, an
acid, a fatty imidazoline, an ethoxylated fatty diamine, and water can be used
[103]. Such a composition has proven more effective than chromates inhibiting the
corrosion caused by ClO2, without the serious toxicologic effects caused by the use
of chromates.
It has been reported that the corrosion rate of steel in the presence of H2S
is greatly decreased by the addition of imidazoline compounds or quaternary
ammonium salts into the drilling fluids [104]. When the concentration of inhibitor
is at a concentration of 2 g l−1, an inhibition efficiency of 70-90% is achieved. If it is
used together with the H2S scavenger-alkaline zinc carbonate, the inhibition becomes
even more effective. A synergistic effect is found between imidazoline inhibitors
and calcium oxide. They also inhibit dioxide corrosion to some extent in H2S￾free drilling muds. Moreover, imidazoline can improve the rheologic properties of a
drilling mud.
Poly(ester)s may be used [105–109] instead of a fatty acid modifier for
imidazoline. Thus, a corrosion inhibitor that forms persistent films can be produced
by first reacting a polybasic acid with a polyalcohol to form a partial ester. The partial
ester is reacted with imidazoline or fatty diamines to result in a salt of the ester.
Pyridinium compounds
Aliphatic pyridinium salts or aliphatic quinolinium salts in the presence of a sulfur
containing compound have been claimed to be active as corrosion inhibitors [110].
N-(p-Dodecylphenyl)-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium sulfoacetate is suitable as an in￾hibitor in aqueous media [111]. Such pyridinium compounds exhibit greater thermal
stability than N-aralkyl pyridinium compounds or N-alkyl pyridinium compounds.
Therefore the desired properties are retained both during and after exposure to
elevated temperatures.
Furthermore, an α,β-ethylenically unsaturated aldehyde together with organic
amines will form intermediate products, which are further reacted with a carboxylic
acid, an organic halide, or an epoxide-containing compound [112]. The final products
are suitable corrosion inhibitors for preventing corrosion of steel in contact with
corrosive brine and oil and gas well fluids.
Still bottom residues produced in the distillation of quinoline from coal tar can
be oxidized and are suitable as a metal corrosion inhibitor for use in aqueous acid
solutions [113].
Azoles

was investigated by weight loss and electrochemical techniques [114]. Among
different azoles, 2-phenylbenzimidazole has shown the best performance. A
synergism of iodide and 2-phenylbenzimidazole was observed. Azoles are shown
in Figure 6.8.
Aminopyrazine with epoxide compound
An inhibitor during drilling and servicing of oil and gas wells is a condensate of
aminopyrazine and an epoxide compound, such as the glycidyl ether of a mixture of
C12 to C14 alkanols [115].
6.8.6 CARBONYL COMPOUNDS
Aldehydes with surfactants
Mixtures of aldehydes with surfactants are active in preventing corrosion, in par￾ticular in the presence of mineral or organic acids [116]. The aldehyde may be
trans-cinnamaldehyde. The surfactant may be N-dodecylpyridinium bromide or the
reaction product of trimethyl-1-heptanol with ethylene oxide [117]. Such aldehyde
and surfactant mixtures provide greater and more reliable corrosion inhibition than
the respective compositions containing aldehydes alone.
Aldose group antioxidants
Corrosion inhibitors have been described that can be used with calcium-free drilling,
completion, and workover fluids in carbonate-containing or sulfate-containing wells
[118–120]. These inhibitors are sodium, ammonium, or calcium thiocyanate alone,
or in combination with specific aldose group antioxidants. Aldose group antioxidants
include arabinose, ascorbic acid, isoascorbic acid, gluconic acid, and their corre￾sponding salts. In addition, ammonium thioglycolate may be incorporated as another
corrosion inhibitor. Thio groups and aldose group antioxidants exhibit synergistic
properties [121]. Aldose derivates are shown in Figure 6.9.
Similarly, a high-density brine, useful as a drilling fluid for deep wells, is made
corrosion resistant by adding an aliphatic or aromatic aldehyde and thiocyanates
[122]. The aldehyde can be reacted with a primary amine before use.6.8 Inhibitor chemicals 331

Phosphate esters
Phosphate ester-type inhibitors are the reaction products of ethoxylated, propoxy￾lated, or butoxylated alcohols or phenols with phosphating agents [123–125].
Inhibitors for both general corrosion and cracking-type corrosion are obtained by
the reaction of a nitrogen base and a phosphate ester [126,127].
Although the nitrogen bases and phosphate esters have good general corrosion
inhibition properties, neither the nitrogen base nor the phosphate ester provide
suitable inhibition for cracking-type corrosion. However, the neutralization product
of the nitrogen base and phosphate ester provides inhibition of both general and
cracking-type corrosion. This inhibitor type is safe for aquatic organisms and is
biodegradable.
6.8.7 SILICATE-BASED INHIBITORS
Silicates [128] offer advantages with respect to low costs, low toxicity, and low
environmental impact.
6.8.8 THIOACETALS
Many corrosion inhibitors are useful only at selected temperature levels or pH
ranges for the various heavy brines and dilution. Temperature changes or any change
which affects the pH of the brine often results in loss of the corrosion inhibition.
Particular problems arise in the selection of corrosion inhibitors for use in zinc halide￾containing heavy brine solutions.
Many common corrosion inhibitors, such as organic thiophosphates, quaternized
amines, poly(phosphate) esters, and filming amines, form precipitates or are in￾effective when admixed with zinc halide-containing heavy brine solutions [129].
Thioacetals can be synthesized by the reaction of an aldehyde with a thiol.
Preparation 6–1: Thioacetals corrosion inhibitors are formed by the reaction of cin￾namaldehyde with thioethanol in glacial acetic acid. p-Toluene sulfonic acid is added as
catalyst [129].332 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors

The reaction is shown in Figure 6.10.
In the same way, other thioacetal compounds have been synthesized and tested
for corrosion. The various thioacetals are summarized in Table 6.4.
To test the activity of the corrosion inhibitors, a weighed coupon was suspended
from a Teflon® holder inside a cell constructed of glass. The cell was then placed in
an autoclave, 100 m l of 15% HCl was poured into the cell, and then enough kerosene
was added such that the coupon was sufficiently submerged. Finally, the contents of
the test cells were infused either with traditional corrosion inhibitors, no inhibitor, or
an above-described thioacetal inhibitors.
In each case in which inhibitor was added, 0.00378 mol was used. The autoclave
was then pressurized to 68 atm (1000 psig) in nitrogen atmosphere, heated to 107 ◦C
for a total contact time of 3 h. The results summarized in Table 6.5.
Actually, the dithioacetal based on cinnamaldehyde and 1,2-thioethanol shows
very good results in preventing corrosion [129]. In contrast, thioglycolic acid
enhances the rate of corrosion.6.8 Inhibitor chemicals 333

Phosphonates
Calcium chloride and calcium nitrate brines are used in establishing and maintaining
oil and gas wells [130]. For example, calcium chloride brines are used in drilling
muds to cool and to lubricate well bits, and to remove cuttings from the hole. The
brines help to maintain the consistency of the drilling muds and add density to them,
to better enable the muds to overcome formation pressures and thereby the amounts
of oil, gas, and water at the specific locations. Such brines also inhibit clay and shale
hydration, and add needed weight to the muds.
Brines are additionally used as completion fluids just before the producing
formation is reached, to flush the hole clean of solids so that the casing can
be cemented in place. Thus, substantially solid-free brines, calcium chloride, and
calcium nitrate brines are ideal as completion fluids [130].
Once a well casing is cemented in place, a smaller diameter tubing is inserted in
the casing, which makes the flow of oil or gas more efficient and can be replaced if
plugs develop. Tubing is used with packer fluid that keeps the well fluids away from
the casing to minimize corrosion. Calcium chloride and calcium nitrate brines are
used in the packing injected into the annular space between the tubing and the casing
in order to maintain pressure levels.
These brines can also be used as workover fluids, by flushing wells free of solids
before they are repaired, or before reworking a well that has been idle.
A principal drawback of such brines is that the brines tend to be highly corrosive
to downhole equipment surfaces, causing pitting and erosion, often with the result
that the equipment must be repaired or replaced at frequent intervals [130].
These problems can be overcome by the addition of chemicals that are inhibiting
the corrosion of metal surfaces in petroleum well equipment when using such brines.
The inhibitor includes respective amounts of a phosphonate or salts, and gluconic
acid or salts. Particularly preferred phosphates are amine polyphosphonates.
Specific examples of tertiary amine phosphonates include ammonium phospho￾nate, diethylenetriamine (DETA) phosphonate or diethylenetriamine penta(methylene
phosphonic acid), monoethanolamine phosphonate, and 2-(aminoethoxy)ethanol334 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors

6.9 MISCELLANEOUS INHIBITORS
6.9.1 ANTIMONY HALIDES
Antimony tribromide and other group VA halides minimize the corrosion rate
effectively [131]. Unfortunately, antimony tribromide is toxic.
6.9.2 ALDOL-AMINE ADDUCTS
The corrosion of metal surfaces and the precipitation of a metal sulfide by an aqueous
acid solution can be prevented by an aldol-amine adduct. Aldol (from acetaldehyde)
CH3−CH(OH)CH2CHO has been utilized as a H2S scavenger that prevents the6.9 Miscellaneous inhibitors 335
precipitation of metal sulfides from aqueous acid solutions. However, when the aldol
or an aqueous solution of the aldol is stored, the solution separates quickly into two
layers, with all of the aldol concentrated in the bottom layer. The bottom layer is not
redispersible in the top layer or in water or acid.
In addition, the aldol in the bottom layer has very little activity as a sulfide
scavenger. Thus, the use of aldol as a H2S scavenger in aqueous acid solutions can
result in unsatisfactory results [132,133]. However, the aldol can be reacted with an
amine, such as monoethanoleamine (=aminoethanol), to form an aldol-amine adduct
to overcome these difficulties.
The amine utilized to prepare the aldol-amine adduct must be a primary amine.
The aldol-amine adduct preferentially reacts with sulfide ions when they are dis￾solved in the acid compositions, thereby preventing the dissolved sulfide ions from
reacting with dissolved metal ions and precipitating.
Some formulations that cannot be readily classified into any of the previous
sections are summarized in Table 6.6. Some of these compounds are shown in
Figure 6.12.
6.9.3 INULIN
Methods of inhibiting corrosion of a metal surface in a well or pipeline using inulin
have been described. The methods include the steps of [165]:
1. forming a fluid of an aqueous acid solution and inulin, and
2. introducing the fluid into the well or pipeline.
The methods have wide application in various kinds of operations involved in
the production or transportation of oil and gas, such as acid stimulation or remedial
treatment in a pipeline [165].
6.9.4 ENCAPSULATED TYPES
Conventionally, corrosion inhibitors are applied by two basic modes: batch treatment
and continuous chemical injection. However, the advantages of both method can
be combined using a trick. An encapsulated time-release corrosion inhibitor has be
shown to be highly effective against CO2 corrosion in a field trial.
Here, the corrosion inhibitor is released in a time-controlled manner from
the water-hydrocarbon interfacial region in the annulus of the well. The product
is delivered like a continuous corrosion inhibitor treatment while using a con￾ventional batch application. Actually, a significant increase in the efficiency was
realized [166].

were found to be very effective inhibitors. The thiocarbonyl compound provides
additional inhibition [3].
The corrosion inhibitor compositions provide a tenacious, smooth, protective film
that resists the adhesion of iron sulfide, sessile bacteria, and other solids. There￾fore, the compositions according are also referred to as anti-biofoulant corrosion
inhibitors, and these terms can be used interchangeably.
The inhibited corrosion rates observed were 4-5 mils y−1 (4 × 10−12 m s−1) in
contrast to 15-35 mils y−1 (2.8 × 10−11 m s−1) for uninhibited systems [3].
6.9.6 FORMIC ACID FREE FORMULATION
Acid corrosion inhibitors used for oilfield applications normally contain formic acid
components or compounds that are producing formic acid, when exposed to well338 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors

conditions. Although these corrosion inhibitors have been successfully used in well
stimulation operations, formic acid and other low molecular aliphatic acids and their
related aldehydes or precursors typically present in corrosion inhibitors have been
associated with the corrosion of pipelines and other equipment [167].
Suitable compounds for replacement are unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. For
example, formic acid free corrosion inhibitors has been formulated as given in
Table 6.7. The treatment fluid is substantially free of any formic acid or precursor
of formic acid.
These types of inhibitors are used for viscoelastic diverting acids. Viscoelastic
diverting acids are formulated by mixing a viscoelastic surfactant (VES) with the
acid prior to injection of the acid into the formation. The VES is a surfactant that
under certain conditions can impart viscoelasticity to a fluid [167].
6.9.7 ACROLEIN
Offshore production systems can be impacted negatively by numerous problems
attributed to bacterial activity, associated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and biogenic iron
sulfides, and mercaptan R−SH production. Examples of these problems are [168]:
• microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC),
• underdeposit corrosion because of FexSy deposition,
• equipment fouling because of biomass accumulation,
• impaired oil water separation, leading to poor water quality and overboard
oil-in-water problems, and
• not achieving pipeline specification because of excess H2O or R−SH content.6.9 Miscellaneous inhibitors 339
Acrolein provides a distinctive all-in-one chemical solution to assist in resolving
these problems. The key to this solution is four-fold: Acrolein scavenges H2S, it
scavenges R−SH, it is a potent microbiocide, and it dissolves FexSy.
The use of acrolein has been detailed in the context of an offshore application
with respect to the issues and problems unique to an offshore environment [168].
Acrolein treatment programs can provide effective production-odor control and can
achieve pipeline specifications from the perspective of H2S and R−SH scavenging.
The unique dual solubility of acrolein in oil and water enables it to penetrate and
remove oil-coated FexSy solids and sessile bacteria from production systems.
Because of its low minimum inhibitory concentration, acrolein can be used
for a cost effective biocide treatment—not only in batch applications, but also in
continuous treatment programs.
A series of case histories highlighting the benefits of using acrolein in offshore
systems have been presented [168].
6.9.8 INTENSIFIERS
Corrosion inhibitor intensifiers have been used to extend the performance range of
a selected acid corrosion inhibitor. The term corrosion inhibitor intensifier refers
to compounds that are capable of enhancing the performance of a selected acid
corrosion inhibitor [169].
However, most intensifiers do not perform universally with all corrosion in￾hibitors and many have temperature, time, and environmental drawbacks. For
instance, formic acid, which is sometimes used as a corrosion inhibitor intensifier,
is limited by a temperature range of about 120-160 ◦C in 15% HCl [170]. The effect
of formic acid as corrosion inhibitor intensifier has been studied. Is has been found
that formic acid reduced the surface tension of a 15% HCl solution [171].
Antimony based intensifiers, can be used in conjunction with 15% HCl, but not
with stronger acids such as 28% HCl [170]. In order to extend the effectiveness of
acid corrosion inhibitors, metal salts of iodide and chloride have been suggested,
sometimes even salts from mercury [172]. Cuprous iodide, is effective up to
about 160 ◦C, but has limited solubility in acid solutions. Additionally, cuprous
iodide contains copper, a banned substance in some areas due to environmental
considerations [170].
Besides of environmental concerns, the major problem encountered with these
salts is that they are not compatible with organic based corrosion inhibitor formula￾tions [169]. Therefore, metal chloride or iodide salt intensifiers must be formulated
separately and used in combination with organic based corrosion inhibitors. Thus,
the use of external intensifiers results in increased costs with respect to on-site
formulation, handling, transport, and application [169]. Compositions in which the
intensifier is formulated directly into the composition have been developed, thereby
eliminating or reducing the need for external intensifiers.
Various organic ammonium iodides, including phenyltrimethylammonium io￾dide, ethyl triphenylphosphonium iodide, and others have been tested as internal340 CHAPTER 6 Corrosion inhibitors
intensifiers. A variety of these iodide salts may be suitably formulated into corrosion
inhibitor compositions [169].
Besides, of these internal intensifiers, formic acid has been used as addi￾tional external intensifier. The protective action has been tested. The results
suggest that tetramethylammonium iodide works well with formic acid as
an external intensifier at a variety of temperatures and with several different
metals [169].
Alternatively, corrosion inhibitor intensifiers have been used. These are based on
2-chloro-2,2-diphenylacetic acid and 2-bromo-isobutyric acid. The inhibitor itself in
the formulation is a propargyl alcohol based corrosion inhibitor and cinnamaldehyde
[170]. Formulations using 2-chloro-2,2-diphenylacetic acid reduced the rate of
corrosion by a factor of 10 in certain systems.
In commercial corrosion inhibitors, for example, a blend of quaternary salts,
alcohols, formamide, and ethoxylated nonyl phenol, it has been shown that terpene
compounds act as corrosion inhibitor intensifiers [173]. Such compounds include
carotene, limonene, pinene, farnesene, camphor, and menthol. These type of corro￾sion inhibitor intensifier has that advantage that they are naturally occurring and are
biodegradable.

7 Scale inhibitors
In certain operations in petroleum industries, such as production, stimulation, and
transport, there is some risk of scale deposition. Scaling can occur when a solution
becomes supersaturated, which occurs mostly if the temperature changes in the
course of injection operations.
Also, if two chemicals that will form a precipitate are brought together, a scale
is formed, for example, if a hydrogen fluoride solution meets calcium ions. From
a thermodynamic perspective, there is a stable region, a metastable region, and an
unstable region, which are separated by the binodal curve and the spinodale curve,
respectively.
Scales may consist of calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, gypsum, strontium
sulfate, iron carbonate, iron oxides, iron sulfides, and magnesium salts [1]. In the
literature some monographs, for example, Corrosion and Scale Handbook [2], as well
as reviews [3] on scale depositions are available. Case studies have been presented
for North Sea carbonate reservoirs [4,5] and Gulf of Mexico [6]. A more recent work
focuses on green systems [7].
7.1 SCALE PREDICTION
An overview of scale prediction and control has been presented [8]. The challenges
of scale prediction at high temperature, high pressure, and high total dissolved solids
and an accurate model to predict pH, scale indices, density, and inhibitor needs at
these conditions have been discussed and reviewed.
7.2 CLASSIFICATION AND MECHANISM
The problem is basically similar to preventing scale inhibition in washing machines.
Therefore similar chemicals are used to prevent scale deposition. Scale inhibition
can be achieved either by adding substances that react with potential scale forming
substances so that from the view of thermodynamics the stable region is reached or
by adding substances that suppress crystal growth.
Conventional scale inhibitors are hydrophilic, that is, they dissolve in water. In
the case of downhole squeezing, it is desirable that the scale inhibitor is adsorbed
on the rock to avoid washing out the chemical before it can act as desired. However,

351352 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors
adsorption on the rock may change the surface tension and the wettability of the
system. To overcome these disadvantages, oil soluble scale inhibitors have been
developed. Coated inhibitors are also available.
Frequently, scale inhibitors are not applied as such, but in combination with
corrosion inhibitors [9]. Scale inhibitors can be classified into two main groups,
namely
• thermodynamic inhibitors,
• kinetic inhibitors.
The action of kinetic inhibitors may be understood in terms of stereospecific and
non-specific mechanisms of scale inhibition.
Scale prevention is important to ensure continuous production from existing
reserves that produce brine. Wells can be abandoned prematurely because of poor
management of scale and corrosion [10]. The scale inhibitor operates by the
following two ways [11]:
1. adsorption effects,
2. morphologic changes of the growing sites.
Due to adsorption effects, the inhibitor molecules occupy the nucleation sites
which are preferred by the scale forming molecules. Thus, crystals cannot find active
places to adhere to the surface and, therefore, crystal nucleation is not promoted.
Another inhibitor mechanism is based on the mechanism of adsorption, that is,
morphologic changes can prevent the formation of crystals in the presence of the in￾hibitor. Depending on the inhibitor characteristics and the nature of the substrate, it is
possible that the inhibitor will be adsorbed over the crystalline net, forming complex
surfaces or nets which have difficulty remaining and growing in active places.
Sea water often reacts with the formation water in offshore fields to produce
barium, calcium, and strontium sulfate deposits that hinder oil production. In some
fields, CaCO3 is a major problem.
In some regions, the formation water chemistry varies considerably [12]. For
example, in the Central North Sea Province, the levels of barium ions vary from a
few mg l−1 to g l−1. Further the pH varies from 4.4 to 7.5. Ultimately, a pH of 11.7
has been measured. In the southern region of the North Sea, the waters have a high
salinity and are rich in sulfate and acidic compounds. The ideal scale inhibitor should
have the following properties [12]:
• effective scale control at low inhibitor concentration,
• compatibility with sea and formation water,
• balanced adsorption-desorption properties allowing the chemicals to be slowly
and homogeneously released into the production water,
• high-thermal stability,
• low toxicity and high biodegradability,
• low cost.
Scale inhibitors are coarsely classified as organic and inorganic [11]. The
inorganic types include condensed phosphate, such as poly(metaphosphate)s or7.2 Classification and mechanism 353
Table 7.1 Types of Scale Inhibitors [11]
Inhibitor Type Limitations
Inorganic poly(phosphate)s Suffer hydrolysis and can precipitate as calcium
phosphates because of temperature, pH,
solution quality, concentration, phosphate type
and the presence of some enzymes
Organic poly(phosphate)s Suffer hydrolysis with temperature. Not effective
at high calcium concentrations. Must be applied
in high doses
Polymers based on carboxylic acids Limited calcium tolerance (2000 ppm) although
some can work at concentrations higher than
5000 ppm. Larger concentrations are needed
Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid Expensive
phosphate salts. Suitable organic scale inhibitors available are poly(acrylic acid)
(PAA), phosphinocarboxylic acid, sulfonated polymers, and phosphonates [12].
Phosphonates are maximally effective at high temperatures whereas sulfonated
polymers are maximally effective at low temperatures [13]. Copolymers that contain
both phosphonate and sulfonate moieties can produce and enhanced scale inhibition
over a range of temperatures. A phosphonate end-capped vinyl sulfonic acid/acrylic
acid copolymer has been shown to be particularly useful in the scale inhibition of
barium sulfate scale in water-based systems [13]. The basic issues of scale inhibitors
are given in Table 7.1.
7.2.1 THERMODYNAMIC INHIBITORS
Thermodynamic inhibitors are complexing and chelating agents, suitable for specific
scales. For example, for scale inhibition of barium sulfate, common chemicals are
ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and nitrilo triacetic acid. The solubility
of calcium carbonate can be influenced by varying the pH or the partial pressure of
carbon dioxide (CO2). The solubility increases with decreasing pH and increasing
partial pressure of CO2, and it decreases with temperature.
However, usually the solubility increases with higher temperature. The tem￾perature coefficient of solubility is dependent on the enthalpy of dissolution. An
exothermic enthalpy of dissolution causes a decrease in solubility with increased
temperature, and vice versa.
7.2.2 KINETIC INHIBITORS
Kinetic inhibitors for hydrate formation may also be effective in preventing scale
deposition [14]. This may be understood in terms of stereospecific and non-specific
mechanisms of scale inhibition.354 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors
7.2.3 ADHERENCE INHIBITORS
Another mechanism of scale inhibition is based on adherence inhibitors. Some
chemicals simply suppress the adherence of crystals to the metal surfaces. These
are surface active agents.
Threshold scale inhibitors
Inhibition through a threshold scale inhibitor treatment is the most common method
that is proven to prevent or reduce likely deposits. The art of synthetic scale inhibitors
has been reviewed, in particular, threshold scale inhibitors for oil and gas production
[15]. The chemistry of those inhibitors, inhibition mechanisms, treatment methods,
and key properties for their applications was discussed.
Threshold scale inhibitors prevent scale precipitation by delaying or preventing
the mineral crystal nucleation and/or crystal growth. They prevent or retard the
scale deposition by intervening in one or more steps of scale formation, that is,
aggregation, nucleation, crystal growth, and/or agglomeration. They are believed
to function primarily in one or a combination of threshold inhibition, nucleation
inhibition, crystal distortion, and/or dispersion mechanisms [16,17].
Threshold inhibition refers to an inhibition mechanism by which a substoichio￾metric amount of inhibitor retards crystal growth or delays precipitation. In this
mechanism, the scale inhibitor interacts with growing scale crystals. The scale
inhibitor acts as a nucleation center that covers the scale formed in the aggregate.
Thus, active crystal growth sites are blocked and further crystal growth is stopped.
The threshold scale inhibitors most commonly used in oil well treatments are
phosphorous-containing compounds, polycarboxylates, or sulfonated compounds.
They can be classified into three groups: inorganic phosphates, organophospho￾rus, and organic polymers [16–20]. Examples are listed in Table 7.2 and some
organophosphorus compounds are shown in Figure 7.1.
Amino-alkylene phosphonic acids can be produced by reacting a nitrogen￾containing compound such as amine or ammonia/ammonium salt or amide, for ex￾ample, 4,4
-(propane-2,2-diylbis(4,1-phenylene)bis(oxy)dianiline) (see Figure 7.2),
methanal (formaldehyde), and a phosphorous(III)-containing compound such as
phosphorus trihalide, phosphorous acid, or phosphorus oxides [17]. Here, the
nitrogen-containing compound, such as the amine, reacts first with formaldehyde
generating an intermediate, which then reacts with phosphorous acid by heating.
Organic phosphonate scale inhibitors are advantageous in that they do not easily
hydrolyze and can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, being thermally stable to
121.1 ◦C, but can go higher in the absence of oxygen [15].
Dual purpose viscosifier-scale inhibitors
A method has been described that uses an aqueous base fluid, a first viscosifier-scale
inhibitor agent, a second viscosifier-scale inhibitor agent, and a breaker [21].
The first viscosifier-scale inhibitor agent is a polysaccharide gelling agent
grafted with a chelating moiety; the second viscosifier-scale inhibitor agent is a7.2 Classification and mechanism 355

polysaccharide gelling agent grafted with a chelating moiety chemically modified
with a protecting group.
The first and second polysaccharide gelling agents increase the viscosity of the
treatment fluid. The breaker reduces the viscosity of the treatment fluid and releases
the first polysaccharide gelling agent from the first chelating moiety, so as to permit
the first chelating moiety to provide scale inhibition. The treatment fluids may be
viscosified using gelling agents, such as natural and synthetic polysaccharides (e.g.,
guar gums) or cellulose derivatives. Examples are shown in Table 7.3.
In some cases, the gelling agents may be cross-linked to viscosify the treatment
fluids further.
Suitable chelating moieties are shown in Table 7.4. Some of these compounds are
shown in Figure 7.3.
The chelating moiety may be present in the range of about 0.001-0.01% of the
polysaccharide gelling agent.
Suitable breakers may include an enzyme breaker, an oxidizing breaker, a
buffered acid breaker, and a delayed breaker [21].356 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors

7.3 MATHEMATICAL MODELS
Mathematical models have been developed [22–25]. The scale formation of iron
carbonate and iron monosulfide has been simulated by thermodynamic and electro￾chemical models [25–28]. An accurate model to predict pH, scale indices, density,
and inhibitor needs have been discussed. Experimental data to validate the model
have been examined and an estimation of the error in analysis has been presented.
Thus, a scale prediction software has been developed [10].7.3 Mathematical models 357

The scaling tendency of sulfates, such as calcium sulfate, barite and celestite, and
further and halite scales are not a strong function of the pH of the brine. In contrast,
carbonates, such as calcite, dolomite, and siderite, and sulfide scales are acid soluble.
Therefore, their scaling tendencies are strongly dependent on the pH of the brine. For
pH sensitive scales, the scale prediction is more complicated [10].
7.3.1 OPTIMAL DOSE

7.3.2 PRECIPITATION SQUEEZE METHOD
In the precipitation squeeze method, the scale inhibitor reacts to form an insoluble
salt which precipitates in the pores of the formation rock.
For example, a phosphonate scale inhibitor and a calcium chelate are employed
as a precipitation squeeze treatment. Further, phosphinic polycarboxylate has been360 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors
used in a precipitation squeeze treatment. Poly(epoxysuccinic acid) is effective for
the squeeze treatment [30].
An anionic scale inhibitor and a multivalent cation salt are dissolved in an alkaline
aqueous liquid to provide a solution that contains both scale-inhibiting anions and
multivalent cations, which are mutually soluble under alkaline conditions. However,
at lower pH the inhibitor is not soluble. One compound that reacts at a relatively slow
rate to reduce the pH of the alkaline solution is dissolved in the solution. The rate at
which the pH of the solution is reduced can be adjusted by the formulation [31].
Near-well squeeze treatment models assume that the flow pattern around the well
is radial. It has been investigated whether strictly non-radial flow patterns around the
well have a major effect on the squeeze treatment. It has been found that fractured
wells have longer squeeze life times than non-fractured wells.
Further, the calculations reveal that for fractured wells, inhibitor adsorption on
the face of the fracture itself has no impact on the treatment life time. In a fractured
well, the inhibitor is more retarded by contact with rock over a greater distance in
comparison to a matrix with radial treatment [32].
Recently, experimental results, field data, and treatment methods have presented
that are showing enhanced squeeze life time because of the use of squeeze en￾hancers [33].
Models have been set up to elucidate the effect of scale inhibitor retention
enhancing additives. These additives are normally deployed in reservoirs where the
scale inhibitor shows a poor retention in the formation matrix in order to reduce well
interventions.
A number of techniques to enhance the retention of the scale inhibitor have been
reported, such as precipitation squeezes using calcium or pH increasing additives, the
use of an additive composition that enhances the adsorption of the scale inhibitor by
crosslinking, and the injection of non-damaging concentrations of kaolinite, calcium
carbonate, and organosilane. This is a solids fixation agent. The effect of a scale
inhibitor retention enhancer has been modelled as a function of the adsorption level of
the additive. An example of such a modelling is the injection of an organosilane [33].
When squeezing scale inhibitors into oil-production wells, the inhibitor should
usually be uniformly placed in the open intervals to optimize the squeeze life time
[34]. In wells with varying reservoir quality and/or significant crossflow, however,
uniform placement is difficult to obtain. Therefore, flow diverters are used to improve
the chemical placement.
The squeeze performance and the assessment of the actual placement are of
interest to gather well information and thereby optimize future squeeze designs. The
use of tracers during squeeze treatments has been suggested to evaluate the placement
as an alternative to running production logging tools [34].
In a particular study, the injection of a potassium chloride slug in a producer well
was done to evaluate the layer flow rate profile along the completion interval. On
the basis of the layer-flow rate profile, a tracer-injection program has been designed,
which includes two production stages at different rates [34].7.4 Inhibitor chemicals 361
7.4 INHIBITOR CHEMICALS
A great number of inhibitors of different brands are currently produced on a global
scale; they can be classified into the following groups [66]:
1. polyphosphates (sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate, etc.);
2. chelating agents, including phosphonates (EDTA, Trilon B, hydroxyethylidene
diphosphonic acid [HEDP], nitrilotrimethylphosphonic acid [NTP],
polyethylenepolyamine-N-methylphosponicacid [PAP],
2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid, a number of compounds based on
methylphosphonic acid, etc.);
3. polymers (polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, polymaleic acid, etc.); and
4. copolymers (e.g., polyacrylic acid-acrylamide and poly[acrylic
acid-2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid]).
From the chemical classes, inhibitors can be coarsely subdivided in acids and
complexing agents. Scale inhibitors described in the recent literature are summarized
in Table 7.5.
Hyperbranched polymers
A scale inhibitor with a hyperbranched structure has been developed. A functional
monomer was synthesized from maleic anhydride and propylene glycol, then copoly￾merized with another through radical polymerization, resulting in a hyperbranched
polycarboxylic acid [67].
In a related study, a terminal amino phosphate group of hyperbranched polymers
was synthesized through Michael addition and amidation reactions [68].
The synthesis conditions, such as reaction temperature and time, monomer ratio,
and initiator dosage, have been investigated for obtaining the expected hyperbranched
polymer with a good scale inhibition performance. The scale inhibition efficiency
of the obtained products was determined according to their resistance to the
crystallization of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate under optimal application
conditions.
The experimental results revealed that the hyperbranched polycarboxylic acid
provides a scale inhibiting efficiency for CaCO3 and CaSO4 as high as 95.2% and
92.3%, respectively [67].
In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the good scale inhibi￾tion of the hyperbranched polycarboxylic acid can be attributed to its ability to inhibit
and destroy the formation of crystals, changing the crystal forms of the calcium scale.
This conclusion indicates that the prepared hyperbranched polycarboxylic acid has
great application potential in the treatment of industrial water [67].
Hydroxyl-terminated hyperbranched polyester
A hydroxyl-terminated hyperbranched polyester was prepared with trimethylol￾propane as the core and 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid as an AB2 monomer.362 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors

The effects of the dosage, Ca2+ concentration, pH value, and temperature of the
system on the inhibition efficiency were investigated when the polymer was used
as an inhibitor of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) scale. The polymer acted as a good7.4 Inhibitor chemicals 363

antiscaling inhibitor for CaCO3. When the polyester concentration was 200 mg l−1,
the scale inhibition rate exceeded 70%.
Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction demonstrated that
the mechanism of inhibition was the disturbance of the growth of the crystals and
modification of the crystal morphology by the hyperbranched polyester [69].
Hyperbranched polyether with terminal hydroxyl
A hyperbranched polyether with terminal hydroxyl groups was synthesized from
tetrahydrofuran and glycidol by a cationic open-loop polymerization, then modified
by 2-phosphono-butane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid to introduce carboxyl and phospho￾rus to improve the corrosion and the scale inhibition. 2-Phosphono-butane-1,2,4-
tricarboxylic acid is shown in Figure 7.5.
The scale inhibition efficiency of calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate reached
99.74% and 97.10%, respectively, at a concentration of 20 mg l−1 [70].
The addition of scale inhibitors can inhibit the growth of the calcium scale crystal
and destroy the crystal structure. The corrosion inhibition rate of hyperbranched
polyethers can reach 72.98% when the dosage was 150 mg l−1. The polarization
curve showed that hyperbranched polyether was a kind of mixed corrosion inhibitor.
The adsorption of hyperbranched polyethers on the surface of carbon steel conformed
to Langmuir adsorption, which formed a physical adsorption film and inhibited the
corrosion process [70].

7.4.1 WATER-SOLUBLE INHIBITORS
Acids
Both inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid, and organic
acids, such as formic acid, can be used to increase the pH. Acids are used in
combination with surfactants.
Acids, when used as scale inhibitors, are extremely corrosive. Their effectiveness
has been tested in the laboratory. Parameters include acid type, metallurgy, tempera￾ture, inhibitor type and concentration, duration of acid-metal contact, and the effect
of other chemical additives [71]. Lead and zinc sulfide scale deposits can be removed
by an acid treatment [72].
Hydrofluoric acid
It is known that permeability impairment may be improved by injecting acid
formulations containing HF into the formation. Such methods are known to improve
production from both subterranean calcareous and siliceous formations.
Most sandstone formations are composed of over 70% sand quartz, that is, silica,
bonded together by various amount of cementing material including carbonate,
dolomite, and silicates. Suitable silicates include clays and feldspars. A common
method of treating sandstone formations involves introducing hydrofluoric acid
into the wellbore and allowing the hydrofluoric acid to react with the surrounding
formation.
Hydrofluoric acid exhibits high reactivity towards siliceous minerals, such as
clays and fine quartz powder. For instance, hydrofluoric acid reacts very quickly
with authigenic clays, such as smectite, kaolinite, illite and chlorite, especially at
temperatures above 65 ◦C. As such, hydrofluoric acid is capable of attacking and
dissolving siliceous minerals.
Upon contact of hydrofluoric acid with metallic ions present in the formation,
such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, undesirable precipitation
reactions occur.
Sandstone or siliceous formations and calcareous formations may be treated
with an aqueous well treatment composition containing a hydrofluoric acid source
in combination with a boron containing compound and a phosphonate acid, ester,
or salt. Such compositions have been shown to increase the permeability of the
formation being treated by inhibiting or preventing the formation of undesirable
inorganic scales, such as calcium fluoride, magnesium fluoride, potassium fluorosil￾icate, sodium fluorosilicate, fluoroaluminate, etc. As a result, production from the
formation is increased or improved [73].
Solid acid scale inhibitor
In acidizing a carbonate, dolomite, calcium, and magnesium carbonates of the rock
can be dissolved with an acid. A reaction between an acid and the minerals calcite
(CaCO3) or dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) can enhance the fluid flow properties of the
rock [74].7.4 Inhibitor chemicals 365

N-phosphonomethyl iminodiacetic acid.
Common acids such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, and formic acid are
typically used in acidizing. These acids, however, can have adverse effects when
certain downhole well conditions are encountered. Typical problems occur when
the wells reach an elevated temperature, which leads to near wellbore spending and
increased corrosion.
Another problem encountered with an acid treatment is the formation of sludge.
Hydrochloric acid, particularly when at high concentrations of about 15% and
greater, can cause the development of sludge when the acid is placed in contact with
certain types of crude oil. The sludge formation problem is exacerbated when the
acid that is in contact with the crude oil also contains ferric ion [74].
A solid acid scale inhibitor has been described. The composition contains N￾phosphonomethyl iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA). The treatment fluid is substantially
free of an additional acid or acid-generating compound. N-phosphonomethyl imin￾odiacetic acid is shown in Figure 7.6.
The solid acid chelating agent can provide both oil-sludging reduction and iron
sequestration when added to aqueous acid solutions. The solid acid chelating agent,
when ionized, binds to iron, thereby decreasing the propensity for sludging. When
the chelating agent binds to iron, it allows the oil in a reservoir to flow freely to the
wellbore.
The solid acid chelating agent can be mixed into high total dissolved solids
brines without requiring mixing or diluting with a fresh water source to abate scale
formation in the treatment fluid. The concentration of total dissolved solids in these
brines can be up to and in excess of 250,000 ppm [74].
Moreover, the solid acid chelating agent can be delivered in the fully protonated
form, therefore eliminating the need to acidify to the desired pH with an additional
acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid), as is the case with the majority of commercially
available chelating agents.
The solid acid chelating agent binds to metal cations commonly associated with
acidizing-matrix stimulation such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, iron,
and chromium cations to form stable water-soluble complexes. Binding the metal
cations results in reduced, minimized, or eliminated secondary or tertiary reactions,366 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors

as well as reduction, minimization, or elimination of insoluble products that may lead
to precipitation and formation damage.
Table 7.6 lists the stability constants for various metal complexes with N￾phosphonomethyl iminodiacetic acid.
The solid acid chelating agent advantageously has very acidic protons. Low pKa
values are a desired characteristic because they lead to deprotonation of the solid
acid chelating agent even at low pH. The deprotonated chelating agent can therefore
stabilize released metal cations even at low pH, thus extending the acidity range over
which the chelating agent is active. This is an advantage when compared to traditional
chelating agents such as EDTA and N-(hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediaminetriacetic acid
(HEDTA), which typically chelate better at higher pHs. In addition, the ability to
use lower pH values for a treatment fluid in an acidizing operation may enhance the
erosion of the formation matrix, thus increasing the effectiveness of the acidizing
treatment [74].
Encapsulated scale inhibitors
This type of scale inhibitor allows chemical release over an extended period [75,76].
Microencapsulated formulations may contain a gelatin coating with a multipurpose
cocktail, such as [51,77]:
• scale inhibitor,
• corrosion inhibitor,
• biocide,
• hydrogen sulfide scavengers,
• demulsifier,
• clay stabilizer.
Chelating agents
Trace amounts of chelating agents, such as EDTA, citric acid, or gluconic acid, may
lower the efficiency of scale inhibitors [78]. The concentration of calcium ions and
magnesium ions affects the inhibition of barium sulfate [79]. Pentaphosphonate,
hexaphosphonate, phosphino-poly(carboxylic acid) (PPCA) salts, and poly(vinyl
sulfonate) (PVS) scale inhibitors were studied. String chelating agents, given in
Table 7.7, also stabilize the coating of encapsulated formulations [77]. Some chelat￾ing agents based on imino acids are shown in Figure 7.7.7.4 Inhibitor chemicals 367

Chelating agents.
EDTA
A conventional scale dissolver for barite scale consists of a concentrated solution
of potassium carbonate, potassium hydroxide and the potassium salt of EDTA. On
the other hand, carbonate scales may be dissolved using simple mineral acids, such
as HCl [80]. In addition, surfactants are advantageous for controlling the viscosity
of the fluids. As surfactant, N-erucyl-N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-methyl ammonium
chloride has been proposed [80].
These surfactants can form worm like micelles when mixed with brines. Now, the
structure of the micelles contributes significantly to the viscoelasticity of the fluid,
and viscoelasticity is rapidly lost when the fluid contacts hydrocarbons which cause
the micelles to change structure or disband.
The difference in viscosity of the fluid when in contact with hydrocarbons
and water allows a selective placement of the scale treatment. As a result, scale368 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors
may be preferentially removed from hydrocarbon-bearing zones. This can lead to
a stimulation of hydrocarbon production without a substantial increase in the water
cut of produced fluids [80].
By a suitable process, EDTA can be regenerated. Equation 7.1 illustrates the
dissolution and subsequent isolation of a barium sulfate scale and the regeneration of
EDTA in simplified form [81].

(7.1)
Phosphonates
Previous studies have strongly indicated that amine methylene phosphonic acid based
inhibitor species, such as pentaphosphonate and hexaphosphonate, are considerably
less thermally stable than polymeric species, such as PVS and the S-Co species.
Therefore, the phosphonate based species were reported as less applicable for
deployment in high-temperature reservoir systems.
However, more recent inhibitor species based on different amine methylene
phosphonic acid revealed that certain species are thermally stable at temperatures
exceeding 160 ◦C [82].
A series of phosphonate based scale inhibitors were thermally aged at 160 ◦C.
After ageing, the scale inhibitors were still able to prevent carbonate scale in dynamic
tests. However, the performances of some of the phosphonate compounds against
sulfate scale were reduced by thermal ageing [83].
Esterified phosphono or phosphino acids with a long chain alcohol are effective
as oil soluble scale inhibitors, and as wax or asphaltene inhibitors or dispersants in oil
production. The esters can be prepared by azeotropic condensation of the phosphino
acids with the alcohol. Alternately, the esters are prepared by telomerizing an ester
of an unsaturated carboxylic acid with a phosphite or hypophosphite telogen [84].
In contrast, laboratory studies demonstrate a clear potential for a significant
extension in treatment life time by changing from a phosphonate to a vinylsulfonate
copolymer based scale inhibitor [5].
Phosphonate scale inhibitors in downhole-squeeze applications may be retained
in the near-well formation through adsorption or precipitation mechanisms.
The properties of precipitated calcium phosphonate complexes formed by various
phosphonate species have been investigated [85]. The stoichiometry in various
precipitates has been established experimentally, and the effect of solution pH on
the molar ratio of Ca2+ to P in the precipitate has been investigated.
All precipitation tests were carried out in distilled water with only Ca2+, as CaCl2
present in the system. The test temperatures ranged from 20 to 95 ◦C.
The molar ratio of the elements in the precipitated materials depends on the nature
of the phosphonate scale inhibitor and is a function of pH for all phosphonates tested.7.4 Inhibitor chemicals 369
As the pH increases, the molar ratio of Ca2+ to P in the precipitate increases up to a
theoretical maximum, depending on the chemical structure of the phosphonate [85].
These findings corroborate proposed scale inhibitor metal complex-ion structures,
which were presented previously [86].
In addition, the precipitation behavior of the various compounds has been
modelled theoretically by developing and solving a set of simplified equilibrium
equations [85].
Actually, the precipitation behavior can be modelled, but only if a fraction of the
initial phosphonate scale inhibitor originally non-reacted is taken into account [85].
Bisphosphonates
From mononitrile and bisnitrile starting materials, compounds with one or two
aminobisphosphonate groups were synthesized. These compounds were assessed for
seawater biodegradability, calcium carbonate and barium sulfate scale inhibition, and
compatibility with Ca2+ ions [87].
The distance between these groups was shown to affect biodegradability.
An aminobisphosphonate derived from adiponitrile, (1,6-diaminohexane-1,1,6,6-
tetrayl)tetraphosphonic acid, showed the highest biodegradation of 25% in
28 days by the OECD 306 seawater test [88]. (1,6-Diaminohexane-1,1,6,6-
tetrayl)tetraphosphonic acid is shown in Figure 7.8.
All of the synthesized inhibitors exhibited both carbonate and sulfate scale
inhibition properties [87]. In comparison to commercial scale inhibitors, the scale
inhibition performance was relatively poor for sulfate scale and moderate for
carbonate scale. To improve the performance, the amine groups were converted to
aminobismethylenephosphonate groups, −N(CH2PO3H2)2 (see Figure 7.9), to give
novel nonpolymeric scale inhibitors with four to eight phosphonate groups. Thus, the
scale inhibition was much improved for carbonate and sulfate scales.
(1,6-Bismethylenephosphonate diaminohexane-1,1,6,6-tetrayl)tetraphosphonic
acid was found to be the most potent scale inhibitor, with a fail inhibitor concentration
at 5 ppm for carbonate scale and 20 ppm for sulfate scale. These bisphosphonate
compounds showed moderate biodegradation activity [87].

Aminophosphonates
Phosphonate-based scale inhibitors are widely used in the upstream oil and gas
industry, but many of them lack good compatibility with high calcium brines. The
synthesis of several nonpolymeric aminobismethylenephosphonates with an added
sulfonate group to improve the compatibility has been reported [89,90].
The investigated chemicals were 2-(bis(phosphonomethyl)amino) methane￾1-sulfonic acid, 2-(bis(phosphonomethyl)amino) ethane-1-sulfonic acid, 2-
(bis(phosphonomethyl)amino) propane-1-sulfonic acid, N,N-bis(phosphonomethyl)
cysteic acid, and N,N-bis(phosphonomethyl) metanilic acid.
To screen their performance, dynamic scale loop inhibition performance tests
were carried out for calcium carbonate and barium sulfate, thermal stability tests, and
further calcium compatibility tests up to 10,000 ppm calcium ions. These properties
were compared to some well-known oilfield scale inhibitors [89].
Seawater biodegradation over 28 days (BOD28) was also investigated by the
OECD 306 method [88]. All the inhibitors demonstrated good calcite inhibition
properties, but only 2-(bis(phosphonomethyl)amino) methane-1-sulfonic acid and
2-(bis(phosphonomethyl)amino) ethane-1-sulfonic acid showed a fairly good barite
inhibition. 2-(Bis(phosphonomethyl)amino) ethane-1-sulfonic acid stood out as an
excellent calcite inhibitor, suitable for use in very high calcium-containing brines. 2-
(Bis(phosphonomethyl)amino) ethane-1-sulfonic acid could also provide protection
against barite deposition under mild to medium scaling potentials and gave a
reasonable rate of biodegradation (BOD28 = 46%). 2-(Bis(phosphonomethyl)amino)
methane-1-sulfonic acid and N,N-bis(phosphonomethyl) cysteic acid gave BOD28
values of 79% and 84%, respectively, and can be classed as readily biodegradable.
Of the two products, 2-(bis(phosphonomethyl)amino) methane-1-sulfonic acid seems
the most promising for further studies given the better calcite and barite scale
inhibition properties. Of the SIs tested, N,N-bis(phosphonomethyl) metanilic acid
showed the best thermal stability at 130 ◦C and could therefore be a useful downhole
squeeze scale inhibitor for fairly high-temperature wells. Its BOD28 value was 41%.
Overall, the study highlighted the difficulty of designing a scale inhibitor with
all of the major features required for application over a wide range of field
conditions [89].7.4 Inhibitor chemicals 371
Alkaline earth sulfates
In dissolution studies of barite, using EDTA based and diethylentriaminepentaacetic
acid based chelating agents it has been verified that the presence of dicarboxylic
acid additives, such as oxalate ion, improve the performance of the chelating
agents. However, other related additives such as malonate and succinate reduce the
effectiveness.
Oxalate ions catalyze the surface complexation reaction between the chelant and
the barite surface by the formation of a two-ligand surface complex. The adverse
effect observed at the other dicarboxylic acids is believed to arise to due steric effects,
which prevent the formation of a two-ligand surface complex.
In extended studies with other barite related scales, such as celestite (SrSO4),
gypsum (CaSO4 × 2 H2O), and anhydrite (CaSO4), it was observed that scale
dissolvers which are optimized for their effectiveness against one type of scale, such
as barite may not be the most effective against other scales [64].
Synergistic properties
Barium sulfate is one of the most difficult types of scale to inhibit in oil- and gas￾production systems because of its physical hardness and its chemical and thermal
stability [91]. Barium sulfate is most commonly inhibited with either phosphonate or
polymeric scale inhibitors deployed at substoichiometric concentrations.
The effect resulting from the use of combinations of two or more scale inhibitors
synergistically for enhanced scale inhibition performance has been assessed [91].
Test results have presented, in which a series of pairs of scale inhibitors have been
tested to determine their synergistic properties at pH 5.5 and 95 ◦C.
Each separate single scale inhibitors used has been tested previously for barium
sulfate under the same conditions to determine the minimum inhibitor concentration
(MIC) for each species. Then, 34 dual scale inhibitor combinations have been tested
to examine their synergistic properties. The MICs of the synergistic blends have
compared with the normal MICs of the individual scale inhibitors.
Surprisingly, in most cases, the inhibition efficiency of the blends is usually higher
over the range of scale inhibitor concentrations tested, that is, the MIC of the blend
is lower, compared with that of each scale inhibitor tested separately. Certain pairs
of scale inhibitors used together yield a significantly beneficial effect, for example,
diethylene triamine penta methylene phosphonic acid and hexamethylene triamine
penta methylene phosphonic acid [91].
Testing of scale inhibitors for barite
When testing scale inhibitors for barite, the efficiency of the inhibitor is determined
by comparing the concentrations of the barium ion in the mix to that in an uninhibited
solution. However, the fate of the scale inhibitors is rarely monitored, although this
can give some important insights into the inhibition mechanism [92].
A series of long-term barium sulfate static inhibition efficiency experiments have
been presented, where both the supernatant inhibitor concentration, and the barium
ions were measured. In contrast, in standard inhibition efficiency tests to determine372 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors
the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC), sampling is normally carried out at 2
and 22 h only.
The aim of this type of experiment was to determine the fate of the inhibitor
over time and to determine whether the inhibition efficiency and percentage of the
inhibitor in solution correlate [92].
Biodegradable scale inhibitors
Many oil companies are requesting environmental-friendly fracturing fluids. Fractur￾ing fluids are composed from a variety of compounds, each having a special function.
Fracturing fluids contain also scale inhibitors. Here, we do not explain the basic
issues of a fracturing fluid, this is explained in Chapter 17. Biodegradable chelants
can be selected from a variety of compounds [93].
Sodium iminodisuccinate
This compound is a maleic acid derivative. Its main use is as a chelant for divalent and
trivalent ions. It complexes ions that can cause emulsions, form scale, can denature
enzyme breakers, and cause crosslinked gel instability, and thus it can keep these ions
from having these undesirable effects.
Disodium hydroxyethyleneiminodiacetic acid
This is one of the few amino carboxylic acid chelants that is readily biodegradable. It
is useful for the chelation of divalent and trivalent ions that cause scale can denature
enzymes, and create crosslinked gel instability.
Sodium gluconate and sodium glucoheptonate
These polyols are commonly used for chelation of mineral vitamins such as calcium,
magnesium, iron, manganese, and copper. They have also been found to be useful
herein to complex titanate, zirconate, and borate ions for crosslink delay purposes.
They are also excellent iron complexors for enzyme breaker stability and crosslinked
gel stability.
Sodium poly(aspartate)
This compound is also known as polymerized aspartic amino acid. It chelates with
multiple types of divalent and trivalent ions. It is useful in breaking emulsions and
scale prevention.
Poly(aspartic acid) based chemicals have been identified as environmental￾friendly and biodegradable oilfield chemicals. They can be used both as corrosion
inhibitors and scale inhibitors in brine-injection petroleum recovery. They exhibit a
good calcium compatibility. At pH 5, poly(aspartate)s are resistant to calcium ion
concentrations of 8500-7500 ppm, in comparison to a calcium ion concentration of
5000 ppm for phosphonate and maleic acid polymer products.
At a 5% concentration of the poly(aspartate)s, the calcium compatibility is
superior to that of phosphonate and maleic acid polymer products. Poly(aspartate)s
also do not interfere with the oil-water separation process [94].7.4 Inhibitor chemicals 373
Poly(aspartic acid) chemicals may not exclusively used as scale inhibitor as such,
but also in preconditioning solutions for other scale inhibitors. It has been claimed
that a poly(aspartate) solution preconditioning solution at low pH advantageously
enhances the adsorption of a phosphonate scale inhibitor to a rock material [95].
It has been suggested to synthesize well treatment chemicals, such as
poly(aspartate)s in a bioreactor at or near the site of the borehole. Still more
straightforward, well treatment is achieved by introducing downhole thermophilic
Archea or other thermophilic bacteria or organisms capable of generating well
treatment chemicals [96].
Green silica scale inhibitors
Alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding is a tertiary enhanced oil recovery method
designed to lower interfacial tension, water wet the formation, and decrease water
mobility to produce residual oil [97]. The alkaline-surfactant-polymer flood uses a
combination of alkali, surfactant, and a polymer to achieve these results.
The use of these three fluid injection additives offers significant synergistic effects
in terms of oil recovery and sweep efficiency. Despite its popularity as a potentially
cost-effective chemical flooding method, it is not without problems, one of which is
the excessive formation of silicate scales.
A silicate scale is a very serious problem in the oil and gas industry, which forms
in perforation holes, casing surface, tubing, and surface facilities [97].
The silicate scale formation occurs as follows [97]:
1. Silica dissolution: The alkaline flood typically has pH 11 or higher as it sweeps
the reservoir. The high pH water dissolves quartz in the formation, which results
in dissolved monomeric silica (Si(OH)3O− Na+) flowing with the water flood.
2. Silica polymerization: As the ASP water flows to the production well, it
encounters neutral pH connate water near the wellbore or in the well. As the
high pH ASP water is partially neutralized by the connate water, dissolved silica
begins to polymerize and forms colloidal silica nanoparticles. Colloidal silica
forms when the solubility level of monomeric silica is exceeded. The solubility
of monomeric silica is pH dependent and decreases significantly below
pH 10.5 [98].
3. Silica scale formation: Magnesium, if present, can bridge the colloidal silicate
particles and form an amorphous magnesium silicate scale. The ASP water is
typically softened, and any residual magnesium would precipitate as Mg(OH)2
in the ASP. Magnesium is introduced in the neutral pH connate water.
Magnesium silicate scale typically has nonstoichiometric ratios of magnesium to
silicate. Similar interactions are possible with other polyvalent metal ions (iron,
aluminum, and calcium), but magnesium silicate has a higher scaling index than
the other metal silicates. In the absence of divalent cations, the polymerized
silicate may continue to grow and form an amorphous silica scale. In the oilfield,
different ratios of the two scales are likely forming in various wells as pH and
cation concentrations differ.374 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors
4. Coprecipitation of silicate scale with other mineral scales, for example, calcium
carbonate: If calcium is introduced in the connate water, the high pH of the ASP
water mixing in the well will promote calcium carbonate scale. Calcium
carbonate may provide nuclei for the development of silicate scales [99].
In industrial water, it has been observed that if carbonate scale is prevented, then
silica can be tolerated at higher levels without generating scale.
Some of the inhibition techniques used in the industry were reviewed with regard
to handling oilfield scales in general and silicate scales in particular. In addition,
the inhibitors with enhanced functionality in mitigating silicate scale have also been
discussed. However, the conventional scale inhibitors used are facing restrictions
worldwide, due to their ecotoxicity and nonbiodegradability; this has led to the call
for green scale inhibition in the oil and industry. Green scale inhibitors are considered
as alternative scale inhibitors due to their value-added benefits to the environment
with respect to the methods of treating oilfield scales [97].
Green scale inhibitors
The effectiveness of a number the test samples of new antiscalants, that is, slightly
crosslinked polymers of acrylic and methacrylic acids and crosslinking agents
based on allyl ethers and other compounds, and a copolymer of maleic anhydride
and methacrylic acid (MAAK) has been experimentally compared with that of
traditionally used scale inhibitors based on hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid,
nitrilotriphosphonic acid, and the commercial inhibitor Aminat-K [66]. Aminat￾K is a mixture of the sodium salts of methyliminodimethylphosphonic acid and
nitrilotrimethylphosphonic acid (see Figure 7.10).
The components of some of the crosslinked polymers are listed in Table 7.8.
The results of the experimental study of the kinetics of formation and buildup of
the crystalline deposit of calcium carbonate in the presence and the absence of scale
inhibitors depending on the composition of feedwater and the yield of a filtrate are
reported. The experiments have been performed with the use of feedwater from the
Moscow water-supply line [66].

programs can be prepared for the systems in order to optimize the yield of a filtrate
and the consumption of service reagents. This makes it possible to recommend a
work-cycle time before chemical cleaning operations [66].
Proteins
A series of natural proteins and partially hydrolyzed proteins (peptones) from various
animal and plant sources have been tested for their ability to prevent the formation
of barium sulfate and calcium carbonate scaling for use as environmentally friendly
scale inhibitors in the petroleum industry [100].
All experiments concerning the performance were carried out in a dynamic
tube blocking rig at 100 ◦C and 80 bar. Although many of the proteins/peptones
showed poor or negligible performance, the milk proteins, casein peptones, and
tryptones showed a reasonable inhibition performance on the sulfate scale, but
not as good as some commercial nonpolymeric aminophosphonate scale inhibitors
such as diethylenetriamine pentakis(methylenephosphonic acid). Diethylenetriamine
pentakis(methylenephosphonic acid) is shown in Figure 7.11.
On the calcium carbonate scale, Tryptone N1 19553 outperformed diethylenetri￾amine pentakis(methylenephosphonic acid). In addition, the best proteins/peptones
showed excellent calcium compatibility. Thermal aging studies indicated that the
best peptones were not stable for squeeze treatments at 100 ◦C and therefore are
best used for topside continual injection. Several attempts were made to derivatize
the pendant primary amine (from lysine) or hydroxyl groups in the proteins to
increase the number of carboxylate groups or introduce phosphonate or sulfonate
groups. Although a scale inhibition performance enhancement was achieved, this
could simply be due to the synergistic behavior between an unreacted or hydrolyzed
starting material and the protein [100].

electron microscopy, XRD, and thermogravimetric analysis [101]. β-Cyclodextrin is
shown in Figure 7.12.
The results of these studies revealed that the thus modified β-cyclodextrin
achieved a maximum scaling inhibition efficiency of 89.1%, with an inhibitor content
of 180 mg l−1, 200 mg l−1 Ca2+ in a thermostat water bath at 40 ◦C for 6 h. Both
the morphology and aggregation of calcium carbonate crystals had been changed
when the inhibitor was added. Moreover, the thermogravimetric studies confirmed
the scaling mechanism of the copolymer.
When the treated water and formation water were mixed together during the
compatibility tests, the mixture was clear. Therefore, the green inhibitor could be
applied to prevent the buildup of calcium carbonate for the oilfield flow back
water [101].
7.4.2 OIL SOLUBLE SCALE INHIBITORS
Basic compounds suitable for oil soluble scale inhibitors include phosphonic acids,
such as diethylene triamine tetra(methylene phosphonic acid), or bis-hexamethylene
triamine pentakis(methylene phosphonic acid). Other suitable compounds are acrylic
copolymers, PAA, PPCA, or phosphate esters. These basic compounds are blended
with amine compounds to form an oil soluble mix [58]. tert-Alkyl primary amines
with 12-16 carbon atoms are oil soluble and effect the oil solubility of the scale
inhibitor.378 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors
Aloe based scale inhibitor
An aloe scale inhibitor composition is an aloe gel dissolved in water. The aloe gel
comprises poly(saccharide)s, solubilized in water between 60 and 90 ◦C. In the chain
carboxyl and alcohol functional groups are present that interact with divalent ions
such as Ca2+ and Mg2+.
Unlike chemically synthesized inhibitors the active ingredients in the aloe plant
gel, are natural occurring compounds. The scale inhibitor can be applied at low￾and high-calcium concentrations and without the limitation that the composition
will precipitate because of hydrolysis. In contrast, hydrolysis favors the interaction
with ions in the solution and, thus, its efficiency as a scale inhibitor may even
increase [11].
Reactivity towards calcium to form gels which encapsulate the calcium is
believed to occur according to an egg-box model. The mechanism of trapping of
the calcium ions is shown in Figure 7.13. In general, gels can be formed by the
interaction of multivalent ions with polymers. This phenomenon is also known as
physical crosslinking.
The chains of the gel interact with Ca2+ to get together. This causes stability
when systemic forces or other conditions would otherwise try to revert the gel to an
original condition.
The model assumes that calcium ions serve as a bridge to form ionic liaisons
between two carboxyl groups belonging to two different chains in close contact.
According to this poly(saccharide) model, the chains interact with Ca2+ allowing
a structure coordinated packaging.
7.4.3 INHIBITORS SPECIAL TASKS
Iron sulfide
Ferrous sulfide deposits are a major source of economic loss in the oil industry. The
deposits are mainly the result of a reaction between hydrogen sulfide, formed by
sulfate-reducing bacteria, and ferrous metal oilfield equipment or an iron compound
in the formation.
They obstruct the flow of oil through wells and in the adjacent strata and also
in pipelines and in processing and refinery plant. Ferrous sulfide particles also tend

to stabilize oil-water emulsions which often form, especially during secondary oil
recovery, and present major problems to oil producers.
The simplest way to dissolve a deposit of ferrous sulfide is by contact with strong
acid. Unfortunately this method generates large volumes of highly toxic hydrogen
sulfide gas, which in the past has been responsible for fatalities.
An alternative method of treating the deposits with powerful oxidizing agents
avoids the toxicity hazards but produces oxidation products, including elemental
sulfur, which are so corrosive to pipework that it has not generally been practised.
It has been found that tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine (THP) is capable of solubi￾lizing iron sulfide by forming a bright red water-soluble complex. THP is believed to
be formed in oil wells treated with tetrakis(hydroxmethyl)phosphonium salts. Such
salts, especially the sulfate salts, are commonly added to oil wells as biocides.
Such salts are highly effective at killing the sulfate-reducing bacteria, whose
activity was largely responsible for the original formation of the iron sulfide deposits.
However, the effectiveness of THP as a solubilizing agent for iron sulfides varies
considerably from well to well. This arises because the complex with iron sulfide
requires the presence of ammonium ions. Although ammonium ions are normally
present in oilfield water, the concentration is frequently less than the optimum for
iron sulfide removal. The pH is critical to the formation of the complex.
Water-soluble condensates of THP with co-condensable organic nitrogen com￾pounds such as urea and thiourea are also capable of solubilizing iron sulfide and
provide more consistent performance than THP ammonia mixtures. However, such
condensates may also cause deposition of polymers if used in high concentration.
THP and amino carboxylic acids or amino phosphonic acids act synergistically
to dissolve iron sulfide deposits, even in the absence of ammonia. Moreover, THP
is stable in the presence of amino phophonates even when the two are formulated
together, and stored for extended periods prior to use [102].
Lead sulfide
Scales from lead sulfide are much more difficult to inhibit in comparison to scales
from calcium carbonate or barium sulfate. Test methods have been developed in order
to test the performance of the inhibition of lead sulfide [103].
Scale inhibitors, including phosphonate based scale inhibitors, PPCA,
poly(maleic acid), PAA, poly(aspartate), PVS and acrylic copolymers have been
tested. The performance of these scale inhibitors with respect to the inhibition of
lead sulfide can be classified as follows [103]:
1. dispersion inhibitors,
2. nucleation inhibitors,
3. poor performance inhibitors.
Dispersion inhibitors exhibit a dispersion effect on the formation of lead sulfide.
Nucleation and growth scale inhibitors inhibit the nucleation and the growth of lead
sulfide.380 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors
Zinc sulfide
Generally, a zinc bromide (ZnBr2) brine will be used when a brine is required to have
a density of about 1.7 kg l−1 (14.0 ppg) or above. If a reservoir contains hydrogen
sulfide, zinc sulfide (ZnS) scales can form [104]. To remove zinc sulfide scales,
usually an acid treatment is performed. However, there are significant risks associated
with acid treatments in high temperature, high-pressure gas wells. After the acid
treatment, the production rate may be restored to its previous level. However, new
zinc sulfide deposits can be formed in the well in a short period of time, and a re￾treatment is required.
Phosphonate and phosphonic acid type scale inhibitors are effective to control
ZnS scale at relatively low concentrations. Polymeric scale inhibitors, such as a
copolymer of the sodium salt 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid and
acrylic acid (AA) are also effective scale inhibitors to control ZnS scales in fresh
water and low-density brines, however, not high-density brines.
For these brines, copolymers from AAm and diallyidimethylammonium salts
are more effective [104]. The incorporation of a nitrogen heterocyclic compound
in the copolymer improves the thermal stability of the resulting copolymer.
Such heterocyclic compounds include N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinylcaprolactam, N￾vinylimidazole, and N-vinylpyridine.
The cationic nature of the copolymer greatly improves its compatibility for use as
a scale inhibitor with high-density brines.
Naturally occurring radioactive materials
In oil and gas fields, uranium 238U and 235U, and thorium 232Th are present in
immobile chemical forms, whereas radium and its isotopes, their γ -emitting daughter
nuclides, can easily be transported with chloride-rich formation waters. Once radium
isotopes are leached from their lithological origin, they are no longer supported by
their ancestors, and thus they develop their own decay series.
Radium and its isotopes tend to co-precipitate with the sparingly soluble alkaline
cations mainly in the forms of sulfate, or carbonate or silicate. As such, formation
and produced waters can become radioactive due to the transportation of radium
isotopes. External (near any processing equipment), and internal (during maintenance
or workovers) radioactive hazards could exist due to naturally occurring radioactive
materials adherent to scale during processing [105]. For these reasons, it is highly
desirable to establish an effective scale control.
High-reservoir temperatures
Conventional polymer and phosphonate scale inhibitors may not be appropriate for
the application in high-pressure and high-temperature reservoirs. Only a limited
range of commercially available oilfield scale inhibitor chemicals are sufficiently
thermally stable at temperatures above 150 ◦C.
These chemicals are homopolymers of vinylsulfonate and copolymers of AA
and vinylsulfonate. Other polymers, such as poly(maleic acid), poly(itaconic acid),
and maleic acid/AA copolymers, may offer similar thermal stability [106]. Thermal7.5 Characterization 381
stability tests, influence on pH, ionic strength, and oxygen on conventional polymer
and phosphonate scale inhibitors, for example, on phosphinopolycarboxylate, PVS,
pentaphosphonate, and hexaphosphonate, have been presented [107–110].
As pointed out above, it has been commonly believed that phosphonate scale
inhibitors may not work for high temperature inhibition applications, it has been
more recently shown that phosphonate inhibitors are somehow effective at 200 ◦C
under strictly anoxic conditions and in NaCl brines [111]. In contrast, phosphonate
inhibitors may precipitate with Ca2+ ions in a brine at high temperatures.
7.5 CHARACTERIZATION
7.5.1 SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS
Field desorption mass spectrometry [112], 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and
fourier transform infrared spectroscopy [113] have been used to characterize oilfield
chemicals, among them, scale inhibitors. Ion chromatography is suitable for the
simultaneous determination of hydroxyethylsulfonate, sodium vinylsulfonate, chlo￾ride, and sulfate reaction byproducts [114,115].
7.5.2 TURBIDIMETRY
Phase diagrams of a poly(acrylate)-phosphonate system with temperature and cal￾cium ion concentration can be established with turbidimetric measurements [114].
Conductometric titrations are also suitable to characterize the phase behavior of scale
inhibitors [116].
7.5.3 STATIC BOTTLE TEST
Using alkaline surfactant polymer floods in sandstone reservoirs may cause silicate
scaling. Silicate scaling has been a significant problem in alkaline surfactant polymer
flooded fields in China (e.g., Daqing field) and Canada.
Methods for static and dynamic testing under specific field conditions using
alkaline surfactant polymer floods have been reviewed. The tests serve to screen
chemical inhibitors for the prevention of magnesium silicate scaling. The strategy
is that static tests are used to screen all the inhibitors. Afterwards those with the best
performance are tested dynamically.
In a static bottle test, water samples that serve for connate cationic and connate
anionic waster are mixed together and afterwards mixed with an alkaline surfactant
polymer solution. The compositions of these solutions are shown in Table 7.10.
The mixtures were initially clear, but slowly develop a certain turbidity in the
course of several hours. The turbidity was monitored with a photometer. At elevated
temperatures, the scale formation is sometimes very fast. Typically, in a static test,
silicate slowly forms from the beginning of the test and calcium carbonate forms after
two hours.382 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors

It is interesting to note that none of the chemicals tested acted as a threshold
inhibitor and prevented scaling at low doses. Rather, the inhibitors tended to delay
the scaling process [117].
It turned out that the static and dynamic tests correlate well for the individual
inhibitors. The dynamic tests reveal that calcium carbonate is formed slowly, while a
silicate scale is formed more quickly and is dominating [117].
On the other hand, dramatic differences have been observed under dynamic
and static test conditions, indicating that the structures which cause adherence and
blocking of the pipework during flow may be different than those which dominate
under bulk conditions [118].
7.5.4 THERMAL DEGRADATION
As the oil and gas industry is making firm stride in deepwater and shale exploration
and development, possible thermal degradation of scale inhibitor molecules poses
a great challenge for scaling control and flow assurance for high-temperature
reservoirs.
Studies on the thermodynamics and kinetics of thermal degradation of scale
inhibitors have been reported [119]. An efficient testing approach based on inhibition
kinetics has been developed and successfully applied to determine the fraction of
the active inhibitor molecules in preheated samples of scale inhibitors with various
generic chemistries.
The kinetics of the thermal degradation of an inhibitor was modelled on the
basis of the integrated first-order rate equation and the Arrhenius equation. Good
agreements between the model predictions and the experimental data could be
found [119].
The preheated scale inhibitors were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy for the characterization of the organic materials.
The results may facilitate the rational selection and deployment of scale inhibitors
for high-temperature oil and gas production [119].7.5 Characterization 383
7.5.5 SORPTION OF NANOPARTICLE-CROSSLINKED POLYMERIC
SCALE INHIBITORS
Polymeric scale inhibitors are widely used in the oil and gas field because of their
enhanced thermal stability and better environmental compatibility. However, the
squeeze efficiency of such threshold inhibitors, not only polymeric scale inhibitors
but also phosphonates, is typically poor in conventional squeeze treatment.
Nanoparticle-crosslinked polymeric scale inhibitors were developed for scale
control [120]. Nearly monodisperse boehmite nanoparticles with an average size of
2.8 nm were synthesized and used to crosslink sulfonated poly(carboxylic acid).
Crosslinked AlO(OH) containing nanoinhibitors were produced to increase the
retention of the sulfonated poly(carboxylic acid) in formations by converting liquid￾phase polymeric scale inhibitors into a viscous gel.
A squeeze simulation of these compounds and mixtures was performed. It was
demonstrated that the addition of Ca2+ ions improves the squeeze performance
of sulfonated poly(carboxylic acid), and the normalized squeeze life of a such
material [120].
Impacts on enhanced oil recovery
A comprehensive laboratory study has been presented on the impacts of the enhanced
oil recovery chemicals on CaCO3 scale formation and prevention using static bottle
and dynamic tube blocking methods [20].
The CaCO3 scale forms when the solution is supersaturated by the calcium ion
with carbonate or bicarbonate ion:
Ca2+ + CO3
2− → CaCO3 (7.2)
Ca2+ + 2HCO3
− → CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O (7.3)
The four main factors that influence CaCO3 scale deposition in the oil and gas
industry are the partial pressure of CO2, temperature, pH, and scaling ions.
The enhanced oil recovery chemicals used in this study are a combination of
surfactants and polymers. Three different types of inhibitors were evaluated: tri￾phosphonate, penta-phosphonate, and polyacrylate-based chemicals [20].
Inhibition (%) from the bottle test and minimum effective dose based on the
tube blocking method were determined for each inhibitor at 71 ◦C. Scale precipitates
from the bottle tests were also characterized for morphology and polymorphs using
environmental scanning electron and XRD techniques.
The results of these studies suggest that the performance of scale inhibitors
could be substantially affected by the enhanced oil recovery chemicals. In dynamic
tube blocking tests, the minimum effective dose values of inhibitors were increased
roughly 10 times with the enhanced oil recovery chemicals. The static bottle tests
showed considerable changes under the test conditions. The impact of enhanced
oil recovery chemicals were also demonstrated by the remarkable ranges of the
crystal morphologies, changing from simple aragonite columns to nanorod, distorted384 CHAPTER 7 Scale inhibitors
spheroid, and flower-like superstructure in the presence of enhanced oil recovery
chemicals and inhibitors [20]. The tri-phosphonate-based inhibitor was effective at
concentrations down to 2 mg l−1 [20].

8 Gelling agents
Organic and inorganic gels are used to seal formations with high permeability.
Sealing can be permanent or temporary. In this way, undesirable flows in the
formation can be suppressed. Gelling agents are mainly used for water shutoff and
limiting sand production. Some agents can also be used for primary plugging of
surface and flow strings, as well as for eliminating lost circulation [1]. However, the
high prices often limit wide applications.
Flow-deflecting technologies based on gel-forming agents are effective in highly
water-invaded multizone reservoirs. Redistribution of the flow is achieved by equal￾izing the injectivity profile of the injection wells and reducing the content of
produced water in the producing wells. Redistribution also reduces the consumption
of electricity, demulsifiers, and fuels used for oil treating in the field.
To broaden the use of gel technologies, it is necessary to solve certain problems of
developing and manufacturing mobile units for preparing and injecting large volumes
of gel compositions in wells and for producing non-freezing agents for year-round
stimulation treatments [2].
8.1 PLACING GELS
A key issue in gel technology is how to place gels in thief zones without dam￾aging oil-productive zones. Diffusion, dispersion, and viscous fingering during the
placement of gels may modify the injection profiles. During the placement of a
gel in laboratory studies, the effects of diffusion and dispersion may lead to the
conclusion that zone isolation is not needed in field applications. However, these
conclusion may be erroneous [3]. In practice, flow profiles can be modified by the un￾restricted injection of Newtonian and non-Newtonian gelling agents. Studies revealed
that [3]:
• Zone isolation is more important during the placement of gels in unfractured
wells in comparison to fractured wells.
• Productive zones in unfractured wells can be seriously damaged if the zones are
not isolated.

393394 CHAPTER 8 Gelling agents
• In non-isolated zones a minimum penetration into unfractured, zones with low
permeability can be achieved by using water like gelling agents.
• In comparison to water like gelling agents, the non-Newtonian rheology of
polymeric gelling agents will not reduce the need for zone isolation.
Various rheological models have been used to describe the properties of non￾Newtonian gelling agents. The placement of the gel was simulated in linear and
radial parallel corefloods, as well as in fractured and in unfractured injection wells. It
has been concluded that in comparison to water like gelling agents, non-Newtonian
gelling agents do not reduce the need for zone isolation during gel placement in radial
flow systems [4].
8.2 BASIC MECHANISMS OF GELLING AGENTS
The subdivision of sealing agents into gelling agents and plugging agents is
somewhat arbitrary. Gelling may be understood as a sealing that is less perfect
than plugging. Therefore, this chapter summarizes gelling agents that are formed
by physical crosslinking, whereas Chapter 18 deals with gels that are formed by
chemical reactions, for instance, by in situ polymerization. Furthermore, if a chemical
composition is exclusively used as a plugging formulation, it has been included in
Chapter 18. The formation of gels can be achieved by various chemical principles,
such as:
• bringing polyanionic and polycationic substances together;
• physical crosslinking of carboxyl-functional polymers with multivalent ions; and
• using chelating agents.
8.2.1 POLYMER-CROSSLINKER-RETARDER SYSTEMS
Typical compositions consist of water, at least one polymer capable of being gelled
when contacted with a crosslinking agent, a crosslinking agent that is a polyvalent
metal cation, and a reactivity-retarding chelating agent. The chelating agent is
selected from water-soluble dicarboxylic acids, for example, hydroxy carboxylic
acids or ketocarboxylic acids [5]. Examples of polymers are given in Table 8.1 and
examples of crosslinkers are given in Table 8.2.

Carboxylic acids as retarders
Chelating agents retard the gelation of polymers with multiple carboxyl groups. The
retardation results from a reaction of the multivalent cations with the chelating agent.
Any water-soluble dicarboxylic acids, hydroxy carboxylic acids, ketocarboxylic
acids, and the corresponding salts may serve as chelating agent [5–7].
8.3 GELLING IN OIL-BASED SYSTEMS
Gelled oil systems are used for fracturing and sand control applications. In addition,
they are used for coiled tubing clean-out applications, especially in water sensitive
formations. Because of the low sand suspension capabilities of conventional gelled
oils when pumping at high rates, foaming of the fluids is often recommended [8].
However, gelled oils are difficult to foam, and often require fluorosurfactant com￾pounds that are not environmental friendly. In addition, the friction loss experienced
with conventional gelled oil fluids is generally higher than that experienced with
water-based fluids, especially in turbulence. Some conventional gelled oils may tend
to stick to tubing walls.
Gel-enhancing surfactants are used to improve their properties of the organic
base fluids. Such a gel-enhancing surfactant is a zwitterionic surfactant, for example,
erucyl amidopropyl betaine. This type of surfactant makes the gel viscoelastic,
increases the stability and decreases the sensitivity to the concentrations of the gelling
agent and to the metal carboxylate. Aluminum carboxylates can be used as activators
for gelling agents, but are themselves able to raise the viscosity of hydrocarbon-based
fluids. Typical gelling agents are organic phosphate esters [8]. Viscoelastic gelled oils
are used in [8]:
• hydraulic fracturing;
• frac packing;396 CHAPTER 8 Gelling agents
• gravel packing;
• diversion;
• fluid loss control;
• lost circulation control;
• sand control;
• wellbore cleanout;
• pipeline sweeping;
• organic scale dissolution;
• sand removal; and
• drilling.
8.3.1 ALUMINUM PHOSPHATE ESTER SALTS
Organic liquid gels are used for temporary plugging during fracturing operations.
This type of gelling agent permits on-the-fly gelling of hydrocarbons, particularly
those used in hydraulic fracturing of subterranean formations to enhance oil and gas
production. A gel of an organic liquid, such as diesel or crude oil, can be formed
using an aluminum phosphate diester in which all of the reagents are substantially
free of water and pH-affecting substances [9–11].
The diester may be prepared by the reaction of a triester with phosphorous
pentoxide to produce a poly(phosphate), which is then reacted with an alcohol to
produce a phosphate diester. The latter diester is then added to the organic liquid
along with a non-aqueous source of aluminum, such as aluminum isopropoxide in
diesel oil, to produce the metal phosphate diester.
The conditions in the preceding two reaction steps are controlled to provide a gel
with good viscosity versus temperature and time characteristics. The gel is useful in
fracturing subterranean formations by entraining a solid particulate proppant therein
and pumping the resultant mixture into the subterranean rock formation at sufficient
pressure to fracture the formation.
A similar process allows reacting triethyl phosphate and phosphorous pentoxide
to form a poly(phosphate) in an organic solvent [12]. An excess of 1.3 moles of
triethyl phosphate with respect to phosphorous pentoxide is the most preferred ratio.
In the second stage, a mixture of higher aliphatic alcohols from hexanol to decanol
is added in an amount of 3 moles per 1 mole phosphorous pentoxide. Aluminum
sulfate is used as a crosslinker. Hexanol results in a high-temperature viscosity of the
gel, while maintaining at a pumpable viscosity at ambient temperatures [13].
8.3.2 LOW-VOLATILE PHOSPHORIC ACID ESTERS
A high-viscosity gelled hydrocarbon with a proppant material such as sand can be
used in fracturing processes. Rapid gelation of hydrocarbon liquids is also required
when tanks or vessels containing such liquids are damaged in order to avoid spillage
and the resultant damage to the environment [14].
The problem with volatile phosphorus-containing compounds is that they cause
fouling in the separation units such as fractionation tower in refineries. This problem8.3 Gelling in oil-based systems 397

can be traced to phosphate esters present in fluid used to fracture formation and to
increase the oil or gas production. Volatile phosphorus-containing compounds tend
to condense in the towers at 250 ◦C and below [15].
Long chain phosphoric acid esters are shown in Figure 8.1.
The compounds are prepared from tributyl phosphate and phosphorous pentoxide
to produce a poly(phosphate) intermediate. The the poly(phosphate) is broken up by
the reaction with long chain alcohols [14,15], such as a blend of Octanol and Decanol
(Epal 810), or ethylene glycol phenyl ether [14]. Eventually, a liquid alkyl phosphate
diester is obtained. These phosphate esters are suitable as gelling agents for liquid
hydrocarbons used as fracturing fluids.
8.3.3 ALUMINUM TRICHLORIDE
Aluminum trichloride, a cheap, abundant waste product of the chemical industry,
forms a gel under certain conditions with carbonates and on mixing with alkalies.
Laboratory and field tests showed that aluminum trichloride can be used as a gel￾forming agent for reducing the permeability of water-conducting channels [16].398 CHAPTER 8 Gelling agents

8.3.4 BIOPOLYMERS
Curdlan
A process using a microbially gelled biopolymer was developed and used to modify
the permeability in coreflood experiments [17]. Curdlan is a microbial carbohydrate
with β-linkages, c.f., Figure 8.2.
Alkaline-soluble curdlan biopolymer was mixed with microbial nutrients and
acid-producing alkaliphilic bacteria and injected into Berea Sandstone cores.
Concurrent bottle tests with the polymer solution were incubated beside the core.
In the bottle tests, the polymer formed rigid gel in 2-5 days at 27 ◦C. After 7 days
of incubation, a pressure of 25-35 ψ was required to begin a flow through the cores.
the permeability of the cores was decreased from 850 to 2.99 mD and from 904 to
4.86 mD, respectively, giving residual resistance factors of 334 and 186.
Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate
Alcaligenes eutrophus produces a massive amount of intracellular poly(ester)
(poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB)), specifically as high as 70% of the cell weight.
This bacterium was selected for plugging studies in porous media [18].
To simulate the subsurface environment, both static drainage and pressurized
pumping flow systems of A. eutrophus living cells and PHB suspensions through
laboratory sand packs were investigated [19]. A PHB water solution, a commercial
product in powder form that disperses well but is not completely dissolved in water,
showed plugging effects solely dependent on the concentration of PHB.
These facts signify that A. eutrophus and its microbial product, PHB, are
efficient plugging agents. They have potential applications in the microbial enhanced
oil recovery process, such as selective plugging, because of their relative non￾agglomerating cell size; their rod shape of 0.7 μm in diameter and 1.8-2.6 μm
in length; and their lack of any exopolymer in culture solutions, especially PHB
produced internally in cells.
Succinoglycan
Aqueous solutions of succinoglycan can be crosslinked by means of a polyvalent
metal cation [20]. The gelation occurs after 3-24 h but can be further delayed by an
appropriate chelating agent. Chelating agents are multifunctional carboxylic acids or
their metal salts, especially citrate, oxalate, and malate metal salts.8.3 Gelling in oil-based systems 399
The aqueous gels are useful in profile modification, or permeability reduction,
of subterranean hydrocarbon-bearing formations in enhanced oil recovery. The
application is simple. A gel is pumped down into a formation for a period of time
sufficient to obtain the desired in-depth penetration and decrease in permeability of
the high-permeability zones of the formation. Usually, an in-depth penetration of 75-
900 feet from the well is sufficient.
8.3.5 ORGANIC POLYSILICATE ESTER
The permeability of subterranean oil-bearing formations can be controlled by
injection of an organic polysilicate ester [21]. Polysilicate esters may be built up from
simple, monohydroxylic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, or butanol
or from diols such as ethylene glycol or polyols such as glycerol or poly(alkylene
oxide)s.
The polysilicates are injected into a formation through injection wells, suitably in
an amount from 10% to 100% of the pore volume of the zone to be treated. In the
formation, the polysilicate esters form gels that selectively decrease the permeability
of the high-permeability regions of the formation.
8.3.6 LATEX
The use of polyisoprene or butadiene-styrene latex with bentonite or chalk filler and
poly(oxypropylene) as an additive has been used in a plugging solution for oil and
gas wells [22]. The solution can be pumped but coagulates within the formation
at temperatures of 100 ◦C within 2 h. This causes a reduction in permeability. The
formulation is particularly useful in deep oil deposits.
Reversible gelling system
An all-oil reversible gelling system consists of a polymer, a crosslinking agent,
a gel accelerator, and an oxidant. The crosslinking agent is activated at elevated
temperatures and the system forms a gel. Subsequently the oxidant decomposes the
gel. In this way, portions of oil producing or water or gas injecting subterranean
formations can be sealed temporarily [23]. All components are oil soluble. The
system does not leave residues that can cause formation damage in the relatively
more permeable zones.
The polymer is preferably a styrene-butadiene copolymer. The crosslinker is a
peroxide, similar to the oxidant. The gel accelerator is benzothiazil-2-cyclohexyl
sulfenamide, as known in the technology of vulcanization. The oxidant is a peroxide,
for example, cumyl hydroperoxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide [23].
The initial mixture contains the non-crosslinked polymer chains. When exposed
to sufficient temperatures, typically temperatures of 95-120 ◦C, the crosslinking
agent decomposes into radicals that are starting the crosslinking reactions over a
comparatively short period of time, and a polymeric gel results. The gel accelerator
serves to shorten the gelling time of the system.400 CHAPTER 8 Gelling agents
The oxidant reverses the crosslinking of the system. The amount and the type
of the oxidant can be formulated as to provide a degradation time of between 20
and 36 h [23].
8.4 GELLING IN WATER-BASED SYSTEMS
8.4.1 XANTHAN GUM
The in situ gelation of aqueous solutions of xanthan gum can used to treat oil spills
in soil as a first aid method. In experiments, the gelling reaction has been carried out
using both CR3+ and Al3+ cations. CR3+ takes around 1 h to gel, whereas Al3+ gels
xanthan at low pH almost instantaneously. Aqueous solutions of xanthan exhibit a
shear thinning behavior, which is highly favourable for these applications [24].
8.4.2 CARBOXYMETHYL CELLULOSE
A mixture of lignosulfonate with modified carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and
metal ions as crosslinkers has been suggested as a plugging agent [25]. CMC,
modified with poly(oxyethylene glycol) ethers of higher fatty alcohols, combines
the properties of a surfactant and CMC.
Thus it reduces the viscosity of the composition and increases the strength of
the produced gel. Sodium and potassium bichromates act as crosslinking agents.
Ionic crosslinks are formed as a result of the reaction of CR3+ and Ca2+ ions with
molecules of modified CMC.
A gel-forming composition is obtained by mixing aqueous solutions of the
respective components. Highly mineralized water also can be used and the gelation
time can be controlled by changing the contents of CaCl2 and bichromates.
Poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride)
Poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride) is a strongly basic cation-active polymer.
A mixture of poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride) and the sodium salt of CMC,
which is an anion-active polymer, is applied in an equimolar ratio [26] in aqueous
sodium chloride solution. The proposed plugging composition has high efficiency
within a wide pH range.
Lignosulfonate and carboxymethyl cellulose
An aqueous solution of 3-6% lignosulfonate and 2-8% CMC, modified with
poly(oxyethylene glycol) ethers of higher fatty alcohols form the base of a plugging
system [25]. Lignosulfonate is a waste product from the cellulose-paper industry.
Furthermore, as crosslinking agents, sodium or potassium bichromate and calcium
chloride are added in amounts from 2% to 5%. The composition is obtained by
mixing aqueous solutions of the components in a cement mixer.
A mixture of polymers that can serve as a plugging solution when taken in an
equimolar ratio consists of poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride), which is a
strongly basic cation-active polymer, and the sodium salt of CMC, which is an anion-8.4 Gelling in water-based systems 401
active polymer. The aqueous solution contains 0.5-4% of each polymer. Gelling
occurs because the macro ions link together from different molecules. The proposed
plugging composition has high efficiency within a wide pH range [26].
8.4.3 POLY(ACRYLAMIDE)-BASED FORMULATIONS
Aqueous solutions of poly(acrylamide) (PAM) may be used as plugging solutions
for high-permeability formations. Partially hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide) (PHPA)
also has been used [27] and completely hydrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) has been
proposed [28].
The polymer solutions are pumpable as such, but in the presence of multivalent
metal ions, gels are formed. The gel formation is caused by an intermolecular
crosslinking, in which the metal ion forms bonds to the polymer.
The metal ions are often added as salts of organic compounds, which form
chelates. This causes a delayed gelation. Likewise, the components of the gelling
agent are pumped down in two stages. Some metal cations cannot be used with brines.
On the other hand, brines are often produced from wells, and it is desirable to find
uses for them to avoid disposal processes.
When a small fraction of a hydrophobic monomer into a PHPA is incorporated,
the intermolecular associations can be promoted and thereby the viscosity and the
resistance factor are enhanced [29]. Studies with incorporation of small amounts
of a sulfonic monomer have been reported. The copolymer has a low hydrophobic￾monomer content. The total anionic content is 15-25 mol.%.
This polymer has been compared with a conventional PHPA with 35-40 mol.%
anionic content [29]. The rheological properties, shear rate, and elastic and loss
moduli were found to be similar for the two polymers. For both polymers no
face plugging or internal filter cake formation was observed, and the resistance
factors correlate well with respect to the capillary-bundle parameter. In contrast, the
associative polymer provided low-flux resistance factors that were two to three times
the values expected from viscosities.
Propagation experiments in long cores, up to 157 cm suggest that the unexpect￾edly high resistance factors could propagate deep into a reservoir, thereby providing
an enhanced displacement in comparison to a conventional PHPA. Also, compared
to a conventional PHPA, the modified copolymer shows a significantly higher level
of shear thinning at low fluxes and a lower degree of shear thickening at high
fluxes [29].
Also, the rheology of xanthan and PHPA solutions in porous media, especially at
low velocities have been clarified [30]. In previous studies, the resistance factors and
an apparent shear thinning at low fluxes were reported that were noticeably greater
than what is expected from viscosity measurements.
The polymer component that causes the latter behavior has been shown to
propagate slowly and generally will not penetrate deep into a formation. For PHPA
solutions, this behavior can be reduced or even eliminated for solutions that show
mechanical degradation or flow through a few feet of porous rock [30].402 CHAPTER 8 Gelling agents
Retention
The effect of hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide) (HPAM) polymer concentration on
the retention in porous media has been assessed [31]. Both static and dynamic
measurements have been used.
Consistent results by using both these methods show that different polymer
retention behaviors exist in dilute, semidilute, and concentrated regions. In both
the dilute and concentrated regions, polymer retention has little dependence on
the concentration. In contrast, in the semidilute region, the polymer retention is
concentration dependent. If a porous medium is first contacted with a dilute polymer
solution to satisfy the retention, no significant additional retention occurs during the
exposure to higher HPAM concentrations.
A concentration-related retention mechanism has been proposed that considers
both the orientation of the adsorbed polymer molecules and the interaction between
the molecular coils in solution. Thus it can be explained why polymer retention
does not show much dependence on the concentration in the dilute and concentrated
regimes.
So, it has been suggested that in field applications of polymer and chemical floods,
a reduced polymer retention may be achieved by first injecting a low concentration
polymer bank [31].
Delayed gelation
The water injection method used in oil recovery is where water is injected into the
reservoir, usually to increase the pressure and thereby stimulate production. Water is
injected for two reasons [32]:
1. for pressure support of the reservoir, also known as voidage replacement; and
2. to sweep or displace the oil from the reservoir and push it toward an oil
production well.
Only 5-20% of the oil in a reservoir can be typically extracted by natural driving
forces in the reservoir, but the injection of water increases that percentage, known
as the recovery factor, and maintains the production rate of a reservoir over a longer
period of time.
However, sweep recovery is limited by the so-called thief zones, whereby water
preferentially travels through the more permeable regions or fractured zones of the
reservoirs, bypassing the less permeable zones and leaving unswept oil behind. One
means of further improving recovery, therefore, is to partially block thief zones
with a polymer gel or other material, thus forcing water through the less permeable
regions [32].
Delayed gelation agents have been developed that contain a degradable polymeric
cage with gelation agents. The cage degrades in situ, for example, in an oil reservoir,
thus releasing the gelation agent, which can then crosslink other polymers in situ to
form a gel [32]. Preferred monomers and crosslinking agents are listed in Table 8.3
and some of these compounds are shown in Figures 8.3 and 8.4.8.4 Gelling in water-based systems 403

A crosslinked polymeric particle or cage was prepared using an inverse-emulsion
polymerization.
Preparation 8–1: Here, an aqueous mixture containing 22 g of 50% sodium 2-
acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonate, 10 g of 50% poly(ethyleneimine) (2 kD), 6.5 g
distilled water, 35 mg poly(ethylene glycol) (258 D) diacrylate, 1.61 g chromium (III)
acetate hydroxide (CH3COO)7Cr3(OH)2 as the dispersed phase (6400 ppm Cr3+), and an
oil mixture of 20 g kerosene, 3.2 g Span 83, and 1.8 g polyoxyethylene sorbitol hexaoleate
as continuous phase were prepared.
The inverse-emulsion was prepared by mixing the aqueous phase and the oil phase,
followed by rapid homogenization using a homogenizer. After adding the emulsion and
20 mg VAZO 52 as an initiator into a 250 ml flask and purging this mixture with nitrogen
for 15 min, polymerization was carried out in a 50 ◦C oil bath for 7 h. VAZO 52 is a
low-temperature polymerization initiator, whose rate of decomposition is first-order and
is unaffected by contaminants such as metal ions.
The gelation agent-loaded polymeric cages were tested to delay the gelation of
both hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide)s and a swellable copolymer of acrylamide and
sodium acrylate crosslinked with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate and methylene
bisacrylamide. A synthetic brine was used. The delayed release gelation agents
form gels with hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide) at a much slower rate than complexed
multivalent cations used alone to gel the hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide) [32].
Complexing agents
Delayed gelation can be achieved by adding complexing agents to the mixture.
The metal ions are initially complexed. Therefore, all components of the gelling
composition can be injected simultaneously. It is possible to dissolve the mixture
in produced brines that have high salinity. The use of produced brines eliminates the
need to treat or dispose of the brines.8.4 Gelling in water-based systems 405

Hydrolysis of urea with water.
Examples of the components of the gelling composition are a water-soluble poly￾mer such as PAM, an iron compound such as ferric acetylacetonate or ammonium
ferric oxalate, and a ketone such as 2,4-pentanedione [33]. The composition forms a
temporary gel that is useful for the temporary plugging of a formation. The temporary
gels that are formed will disappear after 6 months. Such complexes are shown in
Figure 8.5.
Adjustment of pH
Some organic reagents hydrolyze in aqueous solution at elevated temperature and
release ammonia. Examples are urotropin and urea. The hydrolysis of urea is shown
in Figure 8.6.
Urotropin yields by hydrolysis formaldehyde and ammonia. In this way, the pH
is increased. The chemical reactions necessary for the formation of a gel with other
components of the mixture can then take place.
Poly(acrylamide) and urotropin-based mixture
In Table 8.4, a recipe for a PAM-based mixture is shown [34]. The gel-forming

Reinforcement by fibers
Fibers can be added to a gelation solution [35,36]. Fibers that will not interfere with
the gelation process and will provide adequate reinforcement must be chosen. In
addition, they should not adversely affect the ability of the solution to be pumped
and injected. In particular, glass fibers and cellulosic fibers meet the requirements as
reinforcing fibers for plugging solutions.
Metal ions and salts as crosslinking agents
Iron salts
Iron, cations, and some divalent cations cannot be used in the brine environment.
Waste materials
Waste materials from other processes have been established to be active, such as
waste from galvanizing processes [37]. In this case, the components must be placed
in two portions.
Iron and chromic salts from lignosulfonate are also a source for metal ions [38].
Lignosulfonates are waste products from the paper industry.
Chromium (III) propionate
A chromium (III) propionate-polymer system is suitable for gelation treatments in
oil fields, where fresh water is not available [39,40]. It produces good and stable
gels in hard brines, as well as in fresh waters. The effectiveness of treatment
is a function of gelling agent concentration (i.e., the higher the concentration of
chromium propionate, the higher the residual resistance factors).408 CHAPTER 8 Gelling agents
The process can be used for in-depth treatment in the same way as with aluminum
citrate and for near-well treatment. Produced brines that contain iron and barium can
be used. In comparison with aluminum citrate, the use of chromium (III) propionate
gives more effective in-depth treatment at only half of the crosslinker concentration.
This makes the chromium propionate process even more attractive for fresh water
applications.
Gelation process and gel breaking
The gelation process of PAM with chromium ions takes place through coordination
bonding with the nitrogen moiety [18]. Studies have indicated that better results
can be expected in certain concentration ranges of the reactants. Gels formed at
neutral pH have been observed to be comparatively stable and to sustain the reservoir
temperature for 50 days. Solubility in chemicals like HCl, mud acid, and hydrogen
peroxide indicates that these chemicals can be used as breakers.
Aluminum citrate
Aluminum citrate can be used as a crosslinker for many polymers. The gels are made
of low concentrations of polymer and aluminum citrate in water. This crosslinker
provides a valuable tool, in particular, for in-depth blockage of high-permeability
regions of rock in heterogeneous reservoirs. The formulations can be mixed as a
homogeneous solution at the surface.
PHPAs, CMC, poly(saccharide)s, and acrylamido methylpropane sulfonate have
been screened to investigate the performance of aluminum citrate as a chelate-type
crosslinker. An overview of the performance of 18 different polymers has been
presented in the literature [41]. The performance of the colloidal dispersion gels
depends strongly on the type and the quality of the polymer used.
The gels were mixed with the polymers at two polymer concentrations, at three
polymer-to-aluminum ratios, and in different concentrations of potassium chloride.
The gels were quantitatively tested 1, 7, 14, and 28 days after preparation.
Interactions of metal salts with the formation
Interactions of metal salts with the formation and distribution of the retained
aluminum in a porous medium may significantly affect the location and strength
of gels. This interaction was demonstrated with PAM-aluminum citrate gels [42].
Solutions were displaced in silica sand.
The major findings of this study are that as the aluminum-to-citrate ratio
increases, the aluminum retention increases. Furthermore, the amount of aluminum
retained by silica sand increases as the displacing rate decreases. The process is re￾versible, but the aluminum release rate is considerably slower than the retention rate.
The amount of aluminum released is influenced by the type and the pH level of
the flowing solution. The citrate ions are retained by silica sand primarily as a part
of the aluminum citrate complex. Iron, cations, and some divalent cations cannot be
used in the brine environment.8.4 Gelling in water-based systems 409
Bentonite clay and poly(acrylamide)
A water-expandable material based on bentonite clay and PAM is added to the
circulating drilling solution [43]. The material expands in water to 30-40 times
its initial volume. The swelling takes place within 2-3 h. During the circulation of
the drilling solution, the material enters the cracks and pit spaces of the natural
stratal rock. When expanding slowly, the material converts within 30-40 min into
the plugging material, which is strongly fixed to the rock.
Tests showed that the additive effectively prevents the absorption of the drilling
solution on the stratal rock as a result of the production of a strongly adhering and
insulating film, which is not dislodged even after subjecting the material to an excess
pressure of 3 atm for 2 h. The time of expansion of the material is sufficiently slow to
let it permeate into the slits and cracks of the stratal rock, yet is sufficiently quick to
provide a compact insulation.
Thermal insulation compositions
Undesired heat loss from production tubing as well as uncontrolled heat transfer
to outer annuli can be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of outer annuli,
because productivity losses from the well due to deposition of paraffin and asphaltene
materials, accelerate the formation of gas hydrates, and destabilize the permafrost in
arctic type regions [44].
Such fluids can be added either into the annulus or riser, and these fluids can
effectively reduce the undesired heat loss. The composition contains a solvent of low
thermal conductivity and a viscosifying polymer or a gelling agent.
The organic solvents include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, and
diethylene glycol. The solvent imparts low thermal conductivity to the composition
and thereby provides highly desirable thermal insulation.
The gelling agent is an acrylamide copolymer. The copolymers can be slightly
crosslinked, for example, with N,N
-methylene-bis-acrylamide. Other classes of
polymers may be guar derivatives [44]. The crosslinking agents are based on borate
compounds or zirconium or titanium complexes.
While water is preferably not used in conjunction with the solvent. However,
water may be used in small amounts in the composition, such as a portion of a
crosslinking system or the buffer system.
The thermal insulating composition can be prepared on the surface and is then
pumped through the tubing in the wellbore or in the annulus. In particular, the fluid
is a packer or riser fluid. Actually, the composition is acting in two modes [44]:
1. It serves to prevent heat transfer and buildup in the outer annuli.
2. It serves to retain the heat within the produced hydrocarbons.
8.4.4 POLY(ACRYLIC ACID)
Polymers of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid (MA) have been tested for their gel
formation ability [45]. They are used with gel-forming additives similar to those410 CHAPTER 8 Gelling agents

an additive have been described as plugging agents [46].
8.4.5 ALKALI-SILICATE AMINOPLAST COMPOSITIONS
A composition to be injected into the ground for plugging consists of an alkaline
metal silicate and an aminoplastic resin [47,48]. Urea-formaldehyde, urea-glyoxal,
or urea-glyoxal-formaldehyde condensation products are suitable. The composition
has been suggested to be useful for a reservoir rock that is subjected to enhanced
recovery methods. It can also be used for consolidation of ground and in building
tunnels, dams, and other underground structures of this type.
Pyromellitamide gelling agents
Pyromellitamide compounds can be used as gelling agents in fluids for down￾hole uses. Pyromellitamide gelling agents are collected in Table 8.6. N,N
,N,N-
tetrabutylbenzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxamide is shown in Figure 8.7.
It has been proposed that pyromellitamide gelation is achieved through π-π
interactions and primarily intermolecular hydrogen bonds between amide groups,
according to the structural interaction.
Table 8.7 shows the results of gel testing of four compounds.

8.5 IN SITU FORMED POLYMERS
8.5.1 EPOXIDE RESINS
Epoxide resins have good adhesive properties. They can be cured at low tempera￾tures with aminic hardeners and at elevated temperatures with organic anhydrides.
Formulations can be adjusted to a long pot life and a low exothermal reaction. The
compositions are not miscible with well fluids. A disadvantage is the comparatively
high price. Standard epoxide resins are based on bisphenol-A, which is shown in
Figure 8.8.
A method for selectively plugging wells using a low-viscosity epoxide resin
composition containing a single curing amine based agent has been described
[50,51]. The method proposed is applicable for plugging permeable zones in a gravel￾packed well and may be used to repair leaks in well casing or production tubing and
in cementing to prevent communication between subterranean regions.
8.5.2 UREA-FORMALDEHYDE RESINS
Urea-formaldehyde resins can be cured with isopropylbenzene production wastes
containing 200-300 gl−1 of AlCl3 as an acid hardener [52]. Isopropylbenzene is
formed as an intermediate in the Hock process by a Friedel-Crafts reaction from
propene and benzene. The mixture hardens in 45-90 min and develops an adhesion to
rock and metal of 0.19-0.28 MPa for 0.2% AlCl3 and 0.01-0.07 MPa for 0.4% AlCl3,
respectively. A particular advantage is the increased pot life of the formulation.

Unsaturated methylol amides.
A solution of a urea-formaldehyde condensate or a phenol-formaldehyde conden￾sate with minor amounts of lignosulfonates can be used for isolation of absorption
strata during drilling of oil and gas wells [53]. The solution is prepared by mixing
the resin component with lignosulfonate. Curing is achieved by thermosetting the
solution at 80-120 ◦C.
The interaction between aldehyde and phenol groups of the lignosulfonates
with methylol groups of urea-formaldehyde resins or phenol nuclei of phenol￾formaldehyde resins results in the formation of bridges of lignosulfonate macro￾molecules, which act as hardeners of urea-formaldehyde or phenol-formaldehyde
resins. The elasticity of the created fragments results in reduced shrinkage of the
hardened compound. The composition has a low toxicity, in part because of the
absence of acids and alkali. The shrinkage is only 0.1-0.6%. A wide range of curing
rate at temperatures up to 120 ◦C can be adjusted.
8.5.3 VINYL MONOMERS
The use of vinyl monomers for gel formation requires a polymerization process in
the formation. This technique is used to enable a solution to gel slowly even at high
temperatures. An aqueous solution of a vinyl monomer is mixed with a radical￾forming initiator, and if necessary, with a dispersant. The initiator decomposes
at elevated temperatures and initiates the polymerization process. In this way,
a gel is formed in place. The polymerization process is sensitive to molecular
oxygen.
To further delay the curing reaction, polymerization inhibitors may be added to
the solution in small amounts. This technique is used in the treatment of subterranean
formations, especially for plugging lost circulation in drilling operations, particularly
at elevated temperatures. Acrylic acid, acrylamide, vinyl sulfonic acid, and N￾vinylpyrrolidone may be used. The polymer formed may be crosslinked by a
multifunctional vinyl monomer such as glycerol dimethacrylate or diacrylate [54,55].
Monomers like N-methylol acrylamide or N-methylol methacrylamide, c.f.,
Figure 8.9, also have been suggested [56]. Inhibitors can be phenol derivatives [57]
such as N”-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine salt [58].References 413
8.5.4 POLYMERIC ACIDS
In situ gelled acids based on polymers have been used for several years and have
been the subject of laboratory studies. It has been shown that there are conflicting
views on the use of such acids. Recent studies indicated that these acids can cause a
damage under certain conditions.
Recently, a coreflood study at high temperature and pressure was conducted
with limestone cores [59]. The propagation of the acid, polymer, and crosslinking
agent inside the long cores was examined in detail. Samples of the core effluent
were collected, and the concentrations of calcium, crosslinking agent, and acid
were assessed. Also, the permeability enhancement and precipitated materials were
studies.
The experimental results in such as system showed that the acid system caused in
some cases a damage. At low-shear rates the in situ gelled acid formed a gel inside
the core. This gel reduced the core permeability significantly.
In contrast, at high-shear rates, a smaller amount of gel was formed inside the
core, and the ability of the acid to change its direction of flow inside the core was
less than at low shear rates. The wormhole length in the system increased as the shear
rate was increased, while the diameter of the wormhole increased as the cumulative
injected volume of acid increased [59].

9 Filter cake removal
In the course of drilling, well drill-in and servicing fluids are employed. Typically,
well drill-in and servicing fluids include fluid loss control fluids. These fluids may
comprise a comparatively small portion capable of forming a filter cake so as to plug
off thief zones.
In general, well drill-in and servicing fluids are formulated to form a fast and
efficient filter cake on the walls of a well bore within a producing formation in order
to minimize leak-off and damage. The filter cake often contains an inorganic portion
and an organic portion. This arises, because drill-in fluids are typically composed of
either starch or cellulose polymers, xanthan polymers, and sized calcium carbonate
or salt particulates.
Before the production starts, the filter cake must be removed [1]. Insufficient
degradation of the filter cakes can significantly impede the flow capacity at the
wellbore wall. Partially dehydrated, gelled drilling fluid and filter cake must be
displaced from the wellbore annulus to achieve a successful primary cement job.
Conventional methods of filter cake removal consist of contacting and washing
the filter cake with suitable fluids. In addition, the filter cake can be removed by
special formulations of the drilling fluid, as it contains an acid-soluble particulate
solid bridging agent. The resultant filter cake formed by such a fluid then is
contacted with a strong acid to ultimately dissolve the bridging agent. This method
is somewhat dangerous, because the strong acid may corrode the metallic surfaces of
the completion equipment, thereby causing premature damage.
Another method of filter cake removal utilizes a water-soluble particulate solid
bridging agent in the fluid. The bridging agent is subsequently contacted with an
aqueous salt solution that is undersaturated with respect to the bridging agent. In
this case, the bridging agents may require a comparatively long period of time to
dissolve. The presence of gelling agent may prevent the salt solution from contacting
the water-soluble bridging agents.
Still another method to remove the filter cake is to contact it with a combination of
an acid and an oxidizer. The acid may be used to degrade the inorganic portion of the
filter cake, while the oxidizer may be employed to degrade the organic portion [1].

9.1 SIMULATION OF A FILTER CAKE FORMATION
Polymer and gel damage is a major issue in the cleanup of hydraulically fractured
gas wells. A gas water flow model has been used to simulate the fracture propagation
with gel filter cake formation as mechanical trapping of polymer molecules on
the fracture face and filtrate transport into the adjacent matrix [2]. The model
accounts for the polymer as a chemical component. This approach is different than
treating polymer as a highly viscous gel phase, which is the common method in
most literature. Further, the gel filter cake thickness is calculated on the basis of
experimental data.
For leak-off, the model allows only the sheared polymer molecules, which are
the major cause of formation permeability reduction, to cross the fracture face
into the formation and adsorb on the matrix. Other features of the model include
water blockage, non-Newtonian flow, non-Darcy flow, and proppant and reservoir
compaction [2].
9.2 BRIDGING AGENTS
Magnesium oxide, manganese oxide, calcium oxide, lanthanum oxide, cupric oxide,
and zinc oxide can be used in combination with hydroxyethyl cellulose as fluid loss
agent and xanthan as suspension aid for solid particle bridging agents.
In addition to the bridging agent, the drilling or servicing fluid may also include
an oxidizer, which is deposited in the filter cake and is activated by ammonium
chloride (NH4Cl) in the cleaning solution to degrade the polymer in the filter cake.
Magnesium peroxide in encapsulated form is the most suitable oxidizer.
These compounds should be dissolvable in a cleanup solution containing a quater￾nary organic ammonium salt, or simply ammonium chloride [3]. The solubilities of
some selected particulate bridging agents are shown in Table 9.1. A chelating agent
such as citric acid or its salts is also included in the cleanup solution.
However, production engineers have been reluctant to use particle bridging
because of the possibility of particle transport into the formation, resulting in
formation damage or costly and often ineffective stimulation treatments. A particle
bridging fluid has been developed that quickly and effectively controls the fluid loss
in a wide range of permeabilities and pore diameters [4].
Water-soluble organic polymers, such as hydroxethyl cellulose, have been used to
slow down the leak-off rate of clear brines into permeable formations. Fluid loss or
leak-off, however, can be effectively controlled only by bridging the pore openings
with rigid or semirigid particles of sufficient size and number.
The filter cake formed in this process is highly dispersible to the produced fluid
and thus is effectively removed by placing the well on production. No acid treatment
or other removal techniques are required. The primary bridging agent in this fluid
is a sized calcium carbonate with particle sizes capable of initiating bridging pore
diameters in excess of 100 μm.9.2 Bridging agents 421

9.2.1 DEGRADABLE BRIDGING AGENTS
Bridging agents made up from a degradable material can enhance filter cake removal.
In this way, a self-degrading filter cake is formed. The bridging agent is suspended
in a treatment fluid. As the treatment fluid begins to form a filter cake within
the subterranean formation, the bridging agent becomes distributed throughout the
resulting filter cake.
After a certain period of time, the degradable material undergoes irreversible
degradation. The degradation, in turn, causes the degradable material to be removed
substantially from the filter cake. As a result, voids are created in the filter cake. The
removal of the degradable material from the filter cake allows the produced fluids to
flow more freely [5].
A polymeric bridging agent consists of poly(lactide)s. Poly(lactide)s are synthe￾sized commonly by a ring opening polymerization of cyclic lactide monomers. Lactic
acid belongs to the group of hydroxy acids, which are shown in Figure 17.19.
Lactide units are chiral. Because of the chirality of the lactide units degradation
rates, as well as physical and mechanical properties can be adjusted. Poly(l-lactide)
is a semicrystalline polymer with a relatively slow hydrolysis rate. This could be
desirable in applications where a slow degradation of the degradable material is
desired. In contrast, poly(d,l-lactide) are more amorphous polymers with a resultant
faster hydrolysis rate. This may be suitable for applications where a more rapid
degradation may be appropriate.422 CHAPTER 9 Filter cake removal

The various stereoisomers of lactic acid may be used as such or can be combined.
Additionally, lactic acid may be copolymerized with ε-caprolactone, 1,5-dioxepan￾2-one, or trimethylene carbonate. In this way, the desired properties can be tailored.
Still another possibility is to control the desired properties via the molecular weight
or to use blends of different molecular weight. Oligomeric lactic acid, can be used as
plasticizer.
Other types of degradable polymers include polyanhydrides, such as poly(adipic
anhydride), poly(suberic anhydride), poly(sebacic anhydride), and poly(dodecane￾dioic anhydride).
The bridging agents are destroyed by hydrolysis. For this purpose, they are
contacted with an acidic breaker solution, for example, dilute aqueous acetic acid
[5]. Another possibility is to use delayed-release acid compositions. Enzymatic
degradation may be achieved by the use of lactate oxidase [6].
9.2.2 DISSOLVABLE BRIDGING AGENTS
In a similar way as degradable bridging agents, dissolvable bridging agents are help￾ful in removing filter cakes. This type of bridging agents is based on salts of hydroxy
acids [7]. Particular bridging agents suitable for such a method are listed in Table 9.2.
The particle size of the bridging agent is 1-200 μm. The bridging agent particles
should have a specific gravity sufficiently different from that of the drill solids in
order to permit separation methods based on gravity [7]. However, the bridging
agents can be dissolved EDTA compounds.
9.3 DEGRADATION BY ACIDS
In permeable carbonate formations, hydrochloric acid treatments are usually utilized
to remove the formation damage and the mud filter cake induced by drilling
operations.9.3 Degradation by acids 423
When the drilling processes are finished, filter cakes must be efficiently removed
to allow the primary cement jobs to be conducted efficiently, and for hydrocarbons
to be produced without any restrictions [8]. The removal process of the filter cake is
challenging and requires specific techniques, depending on several factors including
the filter cake homogeneity, drilling fluid components, weight of materials used, and
the continuous phase of the drilling fluid (i.e., water or oil).
The green biodegradable acid was an acid solution formulated with a combination
of a catalyst and a reagent added to HCl, creating a biodegradable, nonbioaccumu￾lating alternative to inhibited and potentially hazardous HCl.
The use of a green biodegradable removal acid to dissolve calcium carbonate
water-based filter cake has been tested [8]. The removal efficiency of this acid was
analyzed using filtration and removal tests, conducted on a ceramic filter disc and real
core samples at 100 ◦C (212 ◦F). The new formulation was then subjected to physical
properties measurements and biodegradation and corrosion tests. Furthermore, the
performance of the new acid formulation was compared with 10% HCl to ensure its
efficiency.
The results showed that the new acid formulation was effective at removing the
filter cake, with a removal efficiency greater than 90%. The retained permeabilities
were 100% and 94% with the ceramic filter disc and the real limestone core sample,
respectively, confirming the good removal performance of the new acid formulation.
The corrosion rate of green biodegradable removal acid (50%) at 100 ◦C (212 ◦F)
was 0.016 g cm−2 (0.032 lb ft−2), which was within the acceptable range according
to oil industry practices (i.e., less than 0.05 lb ft−2 if the temperature is less than
250 ◦F), while 10% HCl (10%) yielded a high corrosion rate of 0.68 lb ft−2 [8].
9.3.1 CITRIC ACID
A composition for dissolving filter cake deposits left by the drilling mud in
wellbores is composed of an aqueous solution of citric acid and potassium chloride,
alkali metal formate, acid tetraphosphate, alkaline earth chloride, and alkali metal
thiophosphate [9].
The composition is useful as an additive for clearing stuck pipe in wellbores and
as a fixer spacer for cementing pipe in wellbores. Another use of the composition is
as a well stimulation fluid in oil and gas production wells, in which the composition
is effective to dissolve filter cake that blocks pores in the production formation.
Horizontal well acid breaker
Horizontal completions in unconsolidated formations are being enhanced by a
hydrochloric acid (HCl) breaker system for well cleanup. Typically, the use of HCl in
open-hole environments is avoided because of wellbore stability concerns. However,
HCl successfully removes salt fluid loss control materials in wells without noticeable
hole collapse [10].424 CHAPTER 9 Filter cake removal
9.3.2 ACETIC ACID
A case study was reported regarding the use of acetic acid [11]. A large-scale acetic
acid based stimulation treatment was developed to remove drilling mud filter cake
in vertical wells in a carbonate reservoir in Saudi Arabia. The wellbore stability
of this weakly consolidated carbonate formation can be easily reduced by contact
with HCl-based compositions. Laboratory testing indicated that the formation was
mechanically weak, became brittle upon contact with acids, and produced large
amounts of fine particles that can cause severe damage.
Furthermore, a chloride-free acid formula was required to minimize the interfer￾ence with the pulsed-neutron logs. A special acid treatment was needed to reduce the
damage while maintaining the integrity of the formation. Laboratory tests were done
with both regular and emulsified acetic acid and an auxiliary chemical, mainly EDTA.
Pressure buildup tests after the treatment indicated that the acid was successful in
removing the filter cake in all cases investigated. Neither fine particles nor any type
of emulsion was observed in the well flowback samples.
9.3.3 ACID GENERATING COATINGS
For sand control operations, gravel particles can be coated with an acid-releasing
degradable material. This procedure is helpful in subsequent clean up. Coating is a
straightforward procedure [12].
Preparation 9–1: Poly(lactic acid) is dissolved in methylene chloride. This solution is
then mixed with particulate sand. Afterwards, the solvent is stripped from the coated sand
in vacuo in order to create a free flowing coated sand. The coated sand contains a 2%
coating of poly(lactic acid).
As an alternative, poly(glycolic acid) has been used for coating of sand, however,
by coating as a melt [13].
Preparation 9–2:
1. A mixture consisting of 380 g of 20-40 mesh industrial quartz sand from Unimin
Corporation and 190 grams of technical grade, 65-70% of a glycolic acid solution
from J.T. Baker was mixed together in a 2-l crystallizing dish.
2. The dish was placed on a hot plate and heated under a ventilated hood. A
temperature of at least 210-220 ◦F was obtained and maintained for about 8-10 h.
3. The mixture was stirred frequently until the mixture turned into a light-brown
colored, somewhat viscous and sticky mixture.
4. When the color of the final mixture changed to light-brown, the heating was
terminated.
5. The mixture was cooled to room temperature while stirring. Large aggregates formed
during cooling were broken up into individual grains using mortar and pestle.9.3 Degradation by acids 425
6. The loose poly(glycolic acid) coated sand grains were sieved through a 60-mesh
screen to remove fine-grained, uncoated poly(glycolic acid). The sieved
poly(glycolic acid) coated sand was used for the filter cake clean up test.
Table 9.3 illustrates the generation of acidic components from a coated sand from
Procedure 9–2. Each fluid was exposed to the brine at 60 ◦C for 4 days. The acid
release was characterized by the change in pH.
As can seen readily from Table 9.3, the use of poly(glycolic acid) coated sand
with divalent brines is more beneficial than with fresh water.
9.3.4 ACIDIC FOAM
Foams tend to inhibit the fluid flow and end the loss of fluids into the subterranean
formation even though some portion of the filter cake mass has been prematurely
broken. This allows continued dissolution of the rest of the filter cake along the lateral
portion with acidic treatment. Accordingly, even if an acid is more effective to remove
filter cake in a given portion of the horizontal wellbore than in other portions of the
horizontal wellbore, the fluid loss will be arrested by the presence of the foam in the
portions where the acid is more quickly effective. A method for removing a filter
cake from a horizontal wellbore consists of [14]:
1. forming a stable aqueous acidic foam, the foam should be stable at 95 ◦C;
2. positioning the aqueous acidic foam in the horizontal wellbore;
3. retaining the aqueous acidic foam in the horizontal wellbore for 2-4 h.
An example for such a surfactant foam composition is shown in
Table 9.4. Cationic fluorocarbon surfactants fluorinated alkyl quaternary ammonium
halides. These surfactants consist of an insoluble fluorocarbon tail and a water￾soluble moiety [14]. For example, FLUORAD™ FC 754 is N,N,N-trimethyl
[3"-(perfluorooctanesulfonylamino)propyl]ammonium iodide, which is shown in
Figure 9.1.
The alcohol promotes the formation of microemulsions once the surfactant foam
has been spent and becomes mixed with oily fluids, such as crude oil and condensate

from the formation. The foam may be produced in situ by injecting slugs of air and
the composition alternately through the horizontal wellbore.
9.4 ORTHOESTERS
Orthoesters find use in various fields of oilfield applications, among others also for
delayed delivery of acids that eventually degrade filter cakes [15]. In other words,
orthoester compositions generate acids that are capable of degrading the acid-soluble
portion of a filter cake.
A commonly used orthoester is tripropyl orthoformate, however, a variety of
orthoesters and orthoester polymers have been claimed to be usable. These are
summarized in Table 9.5.
To allow the orthoester to hydrolyze to produce an acid, the presence of water
is required. To these orthoester compositions an inhibitor may be added, which
delays the generation of the acid from the orthoester. Suitable inhibitors include
bases, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, amines, for example,
hexamethylenetetramine, and sodium carbonate [15].
9.5 ENZYMATIC DEGRADATION
Enzymes are promising candidates for cleanup operations as they can degrade
the polymeric components of a filter cake. These are natural and modified9.5 Enzymatic degradation 427

poly(saccharide)s. Thus the permeability of the rock is re-established. The capacity
is correlated to the particular properties of the enzymes, which are [16]:
1. the high specificity, which allows the activity to be accurately controlled with
respect to the polymeric substrate;
2. the catalytic efficiency, which allows a high reaction rate per mole of reacted
product to be obtained, under optimum conditions;
3. activity under bland conditions.
Damaging materials such as filter cakes and very viscous fluids within a subter￾ranean formation of a wellbore can be removed by means of an enzyme treatment
[17]. The enzyme treatment degrades poly(saccharide)-containing filter cakes and
their damaging fluids as the treatment reduces their viscosity. The degraded filter cake
and damaging fluid can then be removed from the formation back to the well surface.
The particular enzymes used are specific to a particular type of poly(saccharide)
and are active at low to moderate temperatures. The enzymes attack only specific
linkages in filter cakes and damaging fluids and are active in the pH range of 2-10.
Enzymes to degrade crosslinked hydroxypropylated starch and xanthan gum
polymer systems are available [18,19]. Specific enzymes are efficient in reducing
the near wellbore damage induced by the starch polymer to eventually return
permeabilities to the range of 80-98% without the use of acid systems.
By the use of enzymes as breakers optimized well completion operations are
possible. These conditions reduce damage caused by fracturing during drilling.
Unlike acids and other chemical oxidants, enzymes do not interact with the formation
rock and with the metals present, thus making undesirable secondary reactions
impossible [16].428 CHAPTER 9 Filter cake removal
An enhanced process for the degradation of scleroglucan or xanthan gums
has been developed. Specific enzymes are used, such as cellulase obtained from
Trichoderma reesei and glucosidase obtained from Aspergillus niger [16].
9.6 NONAQUEOUS BREAKER FLUIDS
A method of cleaning oil-based filter cakes uses a water-miscible nonaqueous fluid,
a weighting salt, and a breaking agent [20].
The water-miscible nonaqueous fluid may be ethylene glycol, propylene glycol,
glycerol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, or tripropylene
glycol.
For example, in the case of ethylene glycol and cesium formate, hydrogen
bonding may provide for greater compatibility between the solvent and salt.
Suitable organic acids that may be used as breaking agents include citric acid,
salicylic acid, glycolic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, and homo- or
copolymers of these compounds. In addition to organic acids, also esters that can
hydrolyze to release an organic or inorganic acid may be used.
As chelating agents a polydentate chelator materials may be used. Such com￾pounds are shown in Table 9.6.
To dissolve or sequester some metals, for example, barium, stronger chelating
agents must be used [20]. For example, of several example chelating agents, the
chelating power is, from strongest to weakest, DTPA, EDTA, GLDA, and HEDTA.
Thus, incorporation of a chelating agent into a breaker fluid may serve to dissolve

and chelate metals present in the filter cake to aid in the dissolution or degradation of
the filter cake.
In summary, the breaker fluid compositions use a water-miscible nonaqueous
solvent as the base fluid, which allows the use of conventional salts as the weighting
agent, whereas conventionally oil-based breaker fluids have not been practical due to
environmental limitations with non-solid weighting agents viewed to be compatible
with the base fluid. Additionally, use of such salts as weighting agents may allow for
densities of greater than 11 ppg, which is the conventional upper limit for oil-based
breaker fluids, to be formulated, rendering the breaker fluids particularly suitable for
use in deep, high-pressure, high-temperature wells [20].
9.7 PEROXIDES
9.7.1 HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
A reagent for removing clay deposits is based on an aqueous solution of H2O2
and Na2CO3 in a concentration range of 15-30 to 75-150 gl−1 or a solution of
sodium bicarbonate and HCl in a concentration range of 60-80 gl−1 and 3.5-4.0 gl−1,
respectively [21]. The injection is followed by a holding time of preferably 2-5 h.
Clay layer breakup products are washed out with a wash solution such as petroleum
and circulating water.
9.7.2 METAL PEROXIDES
A process that successfully removes filter cake contains poly(saccharide) polymers
and certain bridging particles and uses alkaline earth metal peroxides and zinc
peroxide in an acidic aqueous solution [22,23]. On soaking the filter cake, a loosely
adherent mass is left behind on the walls of the borehole. Thereafter, a wash solution
in which the bridging particles are soluble is used to remove the remaining filter cake
solids from the sides of the borehole.
9.7.3 MAGNESIUM PEROXIDE IN FILTER CAKE
Magnesium peroxide is very stable in an alkaline environment and remains inactive
when added to polymer-based drilling fluids, completion fluids, or workover fluids.
Because the magnesium peroxide material is a powdered solid, it becomes an integral
part of the deposited filter cake [24]. The peroxide can be activated with a mild acid
soak. This treatment produces hydrogen peroxide, which decomposes into oxygen
and hydroxyl radicals (OH·) when catalyzed by a transition metal.
These highly reactive OH· species attack positions at the polymers that are
resistant to acid alone. Significant improvements in filter cake removal can be
realized by using magnesium peroxide as a breaker in alkaline water-based systems,
especially in wells with a bottom hole temperature of 150 ◦F (65 ◦C) or less, in the
following operations: drilling into a pay-zone, underreaming, lost circulation pills,
and fluid loss pills for gravel prepacks.430 CHAPTER 9 Filter cake removal
9.7.4 ALKALI-ACTIVATED PERSULFATE
The interface between annular cement and wellbore rock is crucial for ensuring
oil and gas well integrity and environmental protection [25]. Poor bonding quality
may lead to a gas influx into the annulus or even the ground and may cause
health, safety, and environment hazards including contamination of freshwater￾bearing zones, corruption of the cement and casing, sustained casing pressure, and
the formation fluid spill to the ground surface.
This bonding interface between annular cement and wellbore is given by a filter
cake, which commonly consists of a bentonite, barite, and high molecular weight
polymer such as poly(acrylamide) from the drilling process. Therefore, to find an
efficient and environmentally friendly method to degrade poly(acrylamide) to remove
the filter cake before the cementing is highly desired [25].
A fast and effective method for high molecular weight poly(acrylamide)
(Mw = 3 × 107 Da) degradation by an oxidizing OH−/persulfate (PS) system
has been shown [25].
By optimizing the persulfate concentration, alkali-to-persulfate ratio, and tem￾perature of the oxidizing solution, it is demonstrated that a high poly(acrylamide)
degradation efficiency of nearly 90% can be obtained within 20 min and maintain
a pH range suitable for cement casting. The degradation reactions conformed to
pseudo-first-order kinetics with an activation energy of 59.87 kJ mol−1. Dominant
radicals were analyzed by EPR, identifying that both SO4
•− and HO•− were found
in the reaction system, but the HO•− played the dominant role in the degradation
process. Structure transformation of poly(acrylamide) was studied via GPC, SEM,
and FTIR. The backbone cleavage and detachment of side groups caused structural
failure of polymer-bentonite and make the removal of filter cake possible.
A filter cake removal test demonstrated that at least 81% filter cake could be
removed under optimized conditions. This is more effective than an ordinary preflush
with only 24% on average. The results obtained in this study exhibit that polymer
degradation by OH−/persulfate oxidizing system significantly helps to remove filter
cake and the OH−/persulfate system is a promising method for filter cake removal
before the cementing process [25].
9.8 DEGRADATION BY OLIGOSACCHARIDES
A gelled and dehydrated drilling fluid or filter cake can be removed from the walls of
wellbores by injecting an aqueous sugar solution [26]. The solution is kept in contact
with the filter cake for a period of time sufficient to cause the disintegration of the
gelled drilling fluid and the filter cake.
The composition with the disintegrated drilling fluid and filter cake dispersed
therein is then displaced from the wellbore. Monosaccharide sugars, disaccharide
sugars, and trisaccharide sugars can be used. Surface active agents, such as a blend
of non-ionic ethoxylated alcohols or a mixture of aromatic sulfonates, can be added.9.9 Breaking by emulsions 431
9.9 BREAKING BY EMULSIONS
Some water-in-oil emulsions are highly efficient in breaking the residual emulsion
inside the filter cake, decreasing cake cohesion and reducing cake adherence to the
formation face [27].
The action is based as it acts like a demulsifier to break oil-based drilling mud
(OBM) or synthetic oil-based drilling mud water-in-oil emulsions and thus changes
the adherence of the filter cake to the wellbore and formation.
When the emulsion is specifically formulated, the emulsion may pass the no￾sheen requirement, for use in Gulf of Mexico applications, wherein the emulsion
does not produce a silvery or iridescent sheen on the surface of sea water [27].
In particular, the emulsion used should provide excellent particle suspension
capacity. Such capacity prevents particulates from redepositing within the well, for
example, on tubings, casings, or the formation surface.
The internal (or discontinuous) phase of the water-in-oil emulsion is water. The
external phase is a hydrophobic organic solvent. D-Limonene is a preferred organic
solvent. Preferred surfactants are fatty acids, for example, caprylic or capric acids,
however, several other types of surfactants have been considered [27].
Suitable dispersing agents include organophosphate esters, for example, (2"-
ethylhexyl) orthophosphate. The effectiveness of the concept of weakening the filter
cakes has been tested with filter cakes from muds in laboratory experiments [27].
9.9.1 SURFACTANT NANOTECHNOLOGY
The removal of residues from OBMs from a wellbore is important, since brines
contaminated with an OBM can adversely affect the productivity of a reservoir.
Most advantageously, all OBM residues are removed by a series of solvent and
surfactant treatments. However, such treatments result in large disposal volumes.
Further, incomplete water-wetting of the casing or formation by the surfactant may
emerge. A recently developed method relies on surfactant nanotechnology in a high￾density brine in order to form a microemulsion upon contact with oil [28].
OBM filter cake with an acid-degradable weighting agent can also be removed
and the reservoir becomes water-wet if the surfactant is used in conjunction with
an acid precursor. Microemulsion technology is also suitable for remediation, as
emulsion blockages can be removed [28].
The issues of microemulsions have been described in detail [29,30]. The classifi￾cation of microemulsions goes back to Winsor [31]. A microemulsion is defined as
a system of oil, water, and amphiphile that is a single phase, optically isotropic and
thermodynamically stable liquid solution.
Single phase microemulsions are used to improve the removal of filter cakes
formed during drilling with OBMs. The microemulsion removes oil and solids from
the deposited filter cake [32]. In addition, microemulsions find using in enhanced oil
recovery operations [33].432 CHAPTER 9 Filter cake removal
9.10 SPECIAL ISSUES
Flushing fluids
Microemulsion flushing fluid
A flushing fluid consists basically of oil and water and may contain surfactants. In
the cementing operation, only the flushing fluid shows Newtonian behavior. All other
fluids, such as drilling fluids and cement, exhibit non-Newtonian behavior; that is,
their viscosities vary according to the shear rate.
Microemulsions were prepared with vegetable castor oil, 2% KCl as aqueous
phase, and nonionic surfactant (Ultranex NP40, Oxiteno, Brazil) [34]. The thermal
stability, rheological, removal, and wettability inversion were performed to evaluate
the performance of the microemulsion-based flushing fluid.
Rheological tests showed that microemulsions behaved like Newtonian fluids.
The best formulation of flushing fluid was 70% surfactant surfactant/25% oil
phase/5% aqueous phase, with a cloudy temperature at 185.14 ◦C (365.25 ◦K),
a removal efficiency of mud cake of 84.85%, and high capability of wettability
inversion [34].
Nanoemulsion flushing fluid
In order to remove the oil-based drilling fluid adhering to borehole and casing walls
efficiently and achieve excellent bonding strength of the casing-cement-formation
interface, a special oil-in-water nanoemulsion flushing fluid has been developed [35].
The nanoemulsion flushing fluid possesses the characteristics of low interfacial
tension, nanoscale particle size, excellent wettability reversal ability, high stability,
and excellent penetrability. Laboratory tests were conducted to measure the flushing
efficiency and the interface bonding strength. The results of the study showed that
the nanoemulsion flushing fluid can remove the oil-based drilling fluid and filter cake
effectively, which ensures the normal hydration of the cement slurry.
As such, a large amount of the fiber-shape calcium silicate hydrate can be formed
and interwoven together to form a tight network, which improves the bonding
strength of the casing-cement-formation interface [35].
9.10.1 MANGANESE TETROXIDE
Manganese tetraoxide Mn3O4 has been recently used as a weighting material for
water-based drilling fluids. Mn3O4 has a specific gravity of 4.8 g cm−3. It is used in
muds for drilling deep gas wells. The filter cake formed by this mud, contains also
Mn3O4 [36].
Several articles engaged with the use of manganese tetroxide with other additives
in drilling fluid formulations reported negative effects on the reservoir performance.
The permeability of reservoirs is reduced when they are contacted with such
drilling fluids. Special and expensive stimulation techniques have been proven to
be necessary.9.10 Special issues 433

Manganese tetroxide 80. 0 228.2
Unlike CaCO3, Mn3O4 is a strong oxidant [36]. Therefore, the use of HCl is
not recommended for the removal of the filter cake. Various organic acids, chelating
agents, and enzymes, have been tested up to 150 ◦C.
A research has been presented that indicates that a drilling fluid formulation
containing manganese tetroxide with a minimal reduction of the permeability of
the reservoir formation with respect to hydrocarbon flow [37]. These formulations
are particularly useful for the use in wells that are otherwise difficult to stimulate.
A return permeability of 90% or greater is achieved without the need for acidizing
treatments.
In order to achieve these performance levels, the formulation must possess certain
rheological, density, temperature, and fluid loss properties. A formulation is shown
in Table 9.7. Recall that manganese tetroxide has a density of 4.7 g cm−3.
In comparison to a synthetic mud based on alkalis salts of formic acid, where
a return permeability is 66% of the initial volume of oil injected, in a manganese
tetroxide based mud a return permeability is 93% [37].
Removal of manganese tetraoxide
The removal of filter cake generated by drilling fluids weighted with manganese
tetraoxide (Mn3O4) particles may require strong acids, for example, HCl. Organic
acids are not efficient with high-density drilling fluids with a density of greater than
1.6 g cm−3 that contain large amounts of weighting materials, for example, Mn3O4.
A single stage of HCl treatment in a high-temperature and corrosive environment
cannot be used [38]. In certain cases, a two stage treatment is recommended first
to degrade polymers, and then to dissolve the solid particles in the filter cake.
The reaction of acids with solid particles in the drilling fluids was investigated
as a function of time at reaction temperatures up to 120 ◦C. The solubility of the
filter cake was examined using a high-pressure/high-temperature filter press. Gas
chromatography was used to analyze produced gases. Atomic absorption was used
to measure the ion concentrations in spent acids, and X-ray diffraction was used
to analyze solids. A safe, efficient, and economic technique that involves mixing
HCl and an organic acid was developed to dissolve the filter cake in a one-stage
treatment. The results showed a higher removal efficiency of >85%. The solubility of434 CHAPTER 9 Filter cake removal
Mn3O4-based filter cake using 10% HCl at 120 ◦C was 80%, but the reaction released
chlorine gas, which is toxic and corrosive. At HCl concentrations less than 5%, the
release of chlorine gas was not significant, but the solubility of the filter cake was
low [38].
Lactic acid alone does not dissolve the filter cake. However, a combination of
4% lactic acid and 1% HCl dissolves Mn3O4 particles completely at 90 ◦C. At a
temperature of 120 ◦C, nearly 85% of the filter cake was dissolved. This technique
uses lower concentrations of HCl and organic acid, which would reduce the cost of
the acids required for the treatment. Using HCl alone is an inexpensive approach but
HCl cannot be used at concentrations above 5% with Mn3O4-based filter cake. In
addition, a third method was examined to remove the filter cake using a combination
of organic acid and enzyme [38].
Formation damage caused by improper manganese tetraoxide-based
filter cake cleanup treatments
Cleanup of filter cake is a difficult task and becomes more challenging when dealing
with weighting materials, for example, manganese tetraoxide (Mn3O4). Mn3O4 is a
strong oxidizing agent and can be used as a catalyst because of its active phase, a non￾stoichiometric Mn3O4 composed of an octahedral Mn2O3 phase and a tetrahedral
MnO phase, which will result in complex interactions with most cleaning fluids. The
reaction of selected organic acids and chelating agents with Mn3O4 particles as a
function of time and temperature was studied [39].
Solubility and compatibility tests of Mn3O4 particles with cleaning fluids were
conducted using a high-pressure/high-temperature see-through cell. Kinetic tests
were conducted using a three-neck round-bottom flask. Atomic absorption was used
to measure manganese concentration, and X-ray diffraction was used to analyze
solids remaining after the reaction. A white precipitate of manganese citrate was pro￾duced following the reaction of citric acid with Mn3O4 up to 140 ◦C. The amount of
precipitate was increased with temperature and initial acid concentration. An amino
polycarboxylic acid chelating agent derived from GLDA, a chelant, reacted with
Mn3O4 particles completely at 90 ◦C. However, a large amount of a white was pre￾cipitate produced. Similarly, a white precipitate was observed with oxalic and tartaric
acids. The reaction of diethylene triamine pentaacetic acids, a chelate, with Mn3O4
particles in a glass reactor produced manganese silicates at 100 and 140 ◦C [39].
Barite filter cake removal
The removal of barite filter cake is a challenging problem because the conventional
filter cake removal treatments that use hydrochloric acid or chelating agents are
ineffective in dissolving barite containing filter cakes [40]. Barite, or barium sulfate,
is insoluble in water and acids such as HCl, formic, citric, and acetic acids. In
addition, barite has a very low solubility in chelating agents such as ethylene diamine
tetra acetic acid, and diethylene triamine penta acetic acid.
Attempts have been made to develop new formulations to remove the barite filter
cake [40]. The removal formulation consists of chelating agents such as diethylene9.10 Special issues 435
triamine penta acetic acid, converting agent or catalyst, and a polymer breaker, an
enzyme.
Solubility tests of industrial barite and solids collected from de-sanders during
well flowback were conducted to develop barite removing solvent. Actual barite
drilling fluid samples were collected from the field while drilling a high-pressure,
high-temperature deep gas well. The performance of the designed formulation was
examined to remove the filter cake formed by real drilling fluid samples collected
during drilling operations using a high-pressure, high-temperature cell [40].
Based on the result of the study, the filter cake removing formulation dissolved
more than 90% of the filter cake formed by real barite drilling fluid in a single stage
within 24 h. The removal formulation consists of high pH potassium base triamine
penta acetic acid of 20 wt% concentration, enzyme as a polymer degrading agent,
and one of the following converting/catalytic agents (potassium carbonate, potassium
formate, or potassium chloride). The use of converting agents increased the barite
solubility from 67% to 95% [40].
The interaction between the barite chelate and the rock formation after filter cake
dissolution was investigated [41].
A suite of lab scale experiments was conducted to simulate filter cake formation
on the face of four rock samples (limestone and sandstone) using a high-pressure,
high-temperature filter loss apparatus. Diethylene triamine penta acetic acid in an
amount of 20% was then used to dissolve the filter cake. A core flooding apparatus
was used to inject the effluent barite chelate into the rock samples to simulate its
invasion and interaction with the rock.
NMR spectroscopy and X-ray micro-CT images of the samples revealed inter￾esting changes in the pore size distributions of the samples. Barite chelate released
barite precipitates into the pores of the rock and then absorbed cations from the
rock minerals. In sandstones, the barite chelates released barites into the small to
intermediate pores and absorbed cations ions from the large pores. In carbonates, the
barite chelates released barites into the big pores and absorbed cations from small to
intermediate pores. Micro-CT scan and spatial T2 NMR analysis also showed that no
wormholes were generated during filter cake dissolution [41].
9.10.2 MULTIPLY ACTIVE COMPOSITIONS
In many oilfield applications, fluid loss additives and filter cakes are needed during a
treatment, but after the treatment it is desirable that the fluid loss additive or filter cake
be substantially gone [42]. To degrade the acid-soluble particulate portion of the drill￾in fluid filter cake, a conventional delayed-release acid system usually may be used.
Oxidizers are used to degrade the polymeric portions of filter cakes. Since such
oxidizers are not able to degrade the acid soluble portion of a filter cake, the
usefulness of such oxidizer systems generally is limited to cases where the bridging
particles that comprise the particulate portion of the filter cake are small enough to
flow back.436 CHAPTER 9 Filter cake removal
Filter cake degradation compositions comprise a delayed-release oxidizer com￾ponent that will release an acid-consuming component, and a delayed-release acid
component that will release an acid derivative [43]. When a filter cake degradation
composition is added to a well bore penetrating a subterranean formation to degrade
a filter cake, the acid consuming component interacts with acids in such a way
that the acids do not interact with the acid soluble portion of the filter cake for a
period of time. By this behavior, degradation of the acid soluble portion of the filter
cake is delayed. Thus, the integrity of the filter cake may not be jeopardized for a
given desired delay period. In addition, the reaction between the acid consuming
component and the acid derivative generates a peroxide that ultimately can degrade
the polymeric portion of the filter cake.
Calcium peroxide CaO2 is a solid peroxide with a yellowish color. It is insoluble
in water, however, it dissolves in acids to form hydrogen peroxide. For example, as
calcium peroxide interacts with acetic acid. Eventually calcium acetate and hydrogen
peroxide are produced. The hydrogen peroxide then is able to interact with the
polymer in the filter cake to ultimately degrade at least a portion of the polymeric
portion of the filter cake.
Delayed-release acid components used are orthoesters or polymers from hydroxy
acids. Compounds suitable as delayed-release oxidizers are magnesium peroxide,
MgO2 or calcium peroxide, CaO2. The delayed-release oxidizer components may be
encapsulated [43].
9.10.3 SELF-DESTRUCTING FILTER CAKE
Self-destructing filter cake compositions are formulated from a mixture of particulate
solid acid-precursors, and particulate solid acid-reactive materials. In the presence of
water, the solid acid-precursors hydrolyze and dissolve, generating acids that then
dissolve the solid acid-reactive materials [42].
An example of a suitable solid acid-precursor is the cyclic dimer of lactic
acid, which has a melting point of 95-125 ◦C or the cyclic dimer of glycolic acid.
Variants are polymers of these compounds. Particulate solid acid-reactive materials
include calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, or magnesia. Advantageously, these
particulate materials are coated with a hydrolysis-delaying material [42].
The compositions are used in oilfield treatments such as drilling, completion
and stimulation where it disappears when it is no longer needed without the use of
mechanical means or injection of additional fluids.
9.10.4 OSCILLATORY FLOW
To remove filter cake, a physical method can be applied wherein a fluid is oscillated
in the annulus prior to cementing [44,45]. The direction of flow of the fluid in the
annulus is changed at least twice. The oscillatory flow of the fluid removes the drilling
mud and the filter cake from the annulus. After this oscillatory flow treatment, the
cement slurry is pumped into the annulus.References 437

10 Cement additives
The state of the art in cementing technology [1–3] and recent developments are
sketched out in the literature [4,5]. A discussion about the details of special cement
formulations can be found in several monographs [6,7].
The movement of gas from the subterranean zone through the cement slurry
during and after primary cementing is addressed to as gas migration. Gas migration
can cause severe problems, for example, high volume loss of gas from a high pressure
zone to a low pressure zone and the failure of the cement to seal the annulus.
Gas migration is caused by the behavior of the cement slurry during a transition
phase in which the cement slurry changes from a true hydraulic fluid to a highly
viscous mass showing some solid characteristics. When first placed in the annulus,
the cement slurry acts as a true liquid and thus transmits hydrostatic pressure. During
the transition phase, the cement slurry may lose its ability to transmit the hydrostatic
pressure. The reasons for this behavior may be [8]:
• loss of fluid from the slurry to the subterranean zone;
• development of static gel strength, that is, stiffness in the slurry.
When pressure is exerted on the formation of the cement, the pressure of the slurry
falls below the pressure of the gas in the formation, and the gas initially migrates
through the cement slurry. Actually, the gas migration causes the formation of flow
channels in the cement slurry, and the flow channels allow further migration of the
gas, even after the cement slurry has been set.
Various techniques have been developed to eliminate the undesirable gas migra￾tion, for example, consecutive placement of the slurry. Another technique is the appli￾cation of special fluid loss agents. In this way, the passages in the cement are plugged.
Gelling agents can be added to the cement composition. The gelling additive
migrates from the cement composition into the surrounding subterranean zone and
forms a barrier as it forms a crosslinked gel there. This gel inhibits the gas migration
into the cement.
10.1 CEMENTING TECHNOLOGIES
There are two basic kinds of activities in cementing, namely, primary and secondary
cementing. Primary cementing fixes the steel casing to the surrounding formation.
Secondary cementing is for filling formations, sealing, water shutoff, etc.

10.1.1 PRIMARY CEMENTING
The main purposes of primary cementing are:
• supporting vertical and radial loads to the casing,
• isolating porous formations,
• sealing subsurface fluid streams,
• protecting the casing from corrosion.
10.1.2 SECONDARY CEMENTING
Secondary cementing refers to cementing operations that are intended to use
cement in maintaining or improving operation of the well. There are two general
cementing operations that belongs to secondary cementing, that is, squeeze and plug
cementings.
10.1.3 SQUEEZE CEMENTING
Squeeze cementing is used for the following purposes:
• repairing a faulty primary cementing operation,
• stopping intolerable loss of circulation fluid during drilling operations,
• sealing abandoned or depleted formations,
• repairing leaks of the casing,
• isolating a production zone by sealing adjacent unproductive zones.
The slurry should be designed to allow the fluid loss of the formation to be
squeezed into the respective formation. Low-permeability formations can have a
formulation of the slurry with an American Petroleum Institute (API) fluid loss
[9] of 200-400 ml h−1, whereas high-permeability formations require a slurry with
100-200 ml h−1 water loss. A high-pressure squeeze operation with a short duration
requires an accelerator.
Thick slurries will not fill a narrow channel well. Therefore, squeeze cement
slurries should be rather thin. Dispersants should be added for this reason. High
compressive strength is not necessary for these types of slurries.
10.1.4 PLUG CEMENTING
Plug cementing is used for plugging abandoned wells for environmental reasons.
A kick-off plug is used to plug off a section of the borehole. The plug uses a
hard surface to assist the kick-off procedure. Plug cementing is also used in drilling
operations if extensive circulation loss is observed. The plug is set in the region of
the thief zone and pierced again with the bit.
Often in open-hole completion operations and in production, it is necessary to
shut off water flows. Additional cementation methods are used to provide an anchor
for testing tools or for other maintenance operations.10.2 Basic composition of portland cement 443
10.2 BASIC COMPOSITION OF PORTLAND CEMENT
Cement is made from calcareous and argillaceous rock materials, obtained from
quarries. Thus from the chemical viewpoint, the main components are carbonates
and silicates. The raw materials used for cement are given in Tables 10.1 and 10.2.
10.2.1 MANUFACTURING
Grinding and mixing
There are two processes for manufacturing cements, the dry process and the wet
process. The dry process is cheaper than the wet process, but in practice more difficult
to control. Limestone and clay materials are crushed, either dry or in water slurry, and
stored in separate containers.
The composition is analyzed and the contents are blended according to the result
of the analysis and according to the desired properties. Blends obtained from the wet
process must be dried to some extent. The blend is ground to a mesh size of 100-200
(i.e., 0.15-0.07 mm) [10–12].
Burning
The blends are heated in a long rotary kiln. In the first stage of heating, free
water evaporates at temperatures exceeding 900 ◦C. Calcium carbonate caustifies

to calcium oxide (CaO). The CaO starts reacting with aluminum silicates and the
materials liquify. Heating continues to a final temperature of 1500 ◦C. When the
material is cooled it forms irregular-shaped solids called clinkers.
Small amounts of gypsum (1-3%) are added to these clinkers. Gypsum prevents
flash setting and controls the basicity, due to CaO.
The commercial product is actually a blend of different cements. This blending
leads to a more constant quality. A typical chemical composition of Portland cement
is given in Table 10.3.
10.2.2 ACTIVE COMPONENTS IN CEMENTS
There are four chemical compounds that are active components in cement formula￾tions. A list of components is given in Table 10.4.
10.2.3 CHEMISTRY OF SETTING
The setting reactions are exemplified with tricalcium silicate (3 CaO × SiO2) and
dicalcium silicate (2 CaO × SiO2). In contact with water, the calcium silicates react

with water molecules to form calcium silicate hydrate (3 CaO×2 SiO2 ×3 H2O) and
calcium hydroxide (CaO × H2O = Ca(OH)2).
2(3CaO × SiO2) + 6(H2O) → 3 CaO × 2SiO2 × 3 H2O + 3 CaO × H2O (10.1)
2(2CaO × SiO2) + 4(H2O) → 13 CaO × 2SiO2 × 3 H2O + CaO × H2O (10.2)
From these equations, the stoichiometric amounts of water required for setting
can be calculated. The hydration reactions are exothermic. Then the hydration rests.
The inhibition period can last several hours. This behavior is important. Other￾wise the proper placement of the cement would not be possible. After the inhibition
period, the hydration proceeds and the cement starts developing strength. The water
uptake results in an amorphous gel with a variable stoichiometry. During setting,
volume changes through molecular contraction, shrinkage, or swelling, occur.
10.2.4 STANDARDIZATION OF CEMENTS
The API has nine classes of well cements [14]. The classification is similar to ASTM
C 150, Type I [15]. The well cement classes are summarized in Table 10.5.

accelerators or retarders
J 3500-5000 Extremely high temperature and
high pressure; no additives
beside CaSO4; can be used with
accelerators or retarders446 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives
10.2.5 MIXING WITH ADDITIVES
The cement is usually mixed dry with the additives. Depending on the application
of the cement, a wide variety of additives can be incorporated. These include
accelerators, retarders, dispersants, extenders, weighting agents, gels, foamers, and
fluid-loss additives.
10.2.6 IMPORTANT PROPERTIES OF CEMENT SLURRIES
AND SET CEMENT
In cementing operations and applications, several properties are required or desired,
respectively, for proper use. Subsequently, an overview is provided.
Specific weight
Specific weight is one of the most important properties of a cement slurry. The
specific weight of a certain dry cement regulates the minimum or maximum amount
of water allowed to be added. The minimum amount of water, from the aspect
of density, is greater than the stoichiometric quantity necessary for proper setting.
If more than the maximum amount of water is used, pockets of free water will be
formed in the set cement column. Typical amounts of water range from 38% to 46%
in the final mixture.
Thickening time
The thickening time covers the time allowed for manipulation after mixing with
water. It is similar to the pot life time in thermoset resins. Viscosity increases with
time, beginning from mixing with water, because of the chemical reaction of setting.
When the viscosity becomes too great, the slurry is no longer pumpable.
Therefore, it is necessary to place the cement within a certain time after mixing;
otherwise, serious damage of the well could occur. An accurate knowledge of
the time needed for the operation is necessary. The following factors have to be
considered:
• mixing time,
• displacing time (to bring down),
• plug release time,
• safety time.
In general, the thickening time decreases with increasing temperature. Therefore,
it is important that the temperature conditions in the well be known.
Strength of the set cement
The strength of a cement usually refers to the compressive strength. The development
of strength in the course of setting is shown in Figure 10.1. In general, the rate of
setting increases with increasing temperature and pressure.10.3 Special cement types 447

10.3 SPECIAL CEMENT TYPES
10.3.1 RESIN CEMENT
Resin cements or polymer cements have been reviewed by Chandra, Justnes, and
Ohama [17]. Polymer cements are materials made by replacing the cement at least
partly with polymers. Cements can be modified by latex, dispersions, polymer
powders, water-soluble polymers, liquid resins, and monomers. When the polymer
is used in small amounts, it modifies only the pore structure and does not behave like
a binder.
The addition of polymer changes the properties of the set cement. The water
to cement ratio is reduced with the increase of the polymer-to-cement ratio. This
influences the mechanical properties. The polymer content results in the change of
the properties as listed in Table 10.6.
10.3.2 OIL-BASED CEMENT
To prepare an oil-based cement, the cement is suspended in hydrocarbons instead of
water. In this organic environment, no setting takes place and the cement particles
remain fine. Therefore, they may penetrate into small pores. The setting starts when
the cement particles come in contact with water. This takes place in the formation.
Oil-based cements are mainly used as plugging cements and squeeze cements.448 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives

+, better; −, more bad; 0, no change in comparison with conventional cement.
Cement with small particle size has found a number of uses in production and
injection well casing repair jobs [19]. Oil-based cement is particularly useful for
water shutoff jobs, because the hydrocarbon slurry sets only in the presence of water,
so the oil producing sections of a reservoir remain relatively damage free after water
shutoff. The selective water shutoff with oil-based cement also has been used with
polymers crosslinked by metal crosslinkers [20,21].
10.3.3 HIGH-TEMPERATURE CEMENT
High-temperature cement formulations are basically polymer concrete. Mainly
unsaturated poly(ester)s or vinylester resins with allylphthalate as vinyl monomer
are in use [22]. Curing is achieved with peroxides, which decompose sufficiently
fast at temperatures between 120 and 200 ◦C. Polymer concrete requires additional
materials, which compensate the shrinkage.
Highly filled polymer composites, such as polymer concrete, suffer from setting
stresses generated during the cure of the resin binder, when the polymerization
shrinkage is hindered by the close packing of a filler and by aggregate particles. The
setting stresses significantly decrease the strength of the cured composite. Producing
zero-shrinkage with strength enhancement can be achieved by dispersing small
amounts of hydrated montmorillonite into the resin.
The addition of montmorillonite was found effective with three different resin
binders, that is, poly(ester)s, epoxies, and acrylics. A mineral-resin interaction
mechanism has been suggested [23]. The organic molecules replace some of the10.3 Special cement types 449
ordered hydration water, released by the mineral at the temperatures generated by
the exothermic polymerization reaction. A binder used for plugging hot drill holes
contains mainly phosphoric slag, trisodium phosphate, and NaOH [24].
Silica flour and silica fume
Silica powder has been studied as a stabilizer for oil well cement at high temperatures
[25]. Tests indicated that silica powder can improve the stability and pressure
resistance strength of cement. The manufacture of high-strength concrete (after 28
days the compressive strength is greater than 80 MPa) often involves the addition of
ultra-fine particles together with large proportions of organic admixtures [26]. Silica
fumes were found to be the most effective additive.
Substitution of silica flour with varying proportions of silica fume affects the
strength and the permeability of hardened cements [27]. The positive effect on the
strength regression at increased temperatures is due to a greater rate of carbonation
of the set cement [28].
Carbonation is not controlled by permeability but rather by the calcium hydroxide
content at 150 ◦C. The optimal silica addition for geothermal fluids, which contain
high levels of CO2, is ca. 15-20%. The coefficient of permeability was found to
decrease with an increase in the degree of hydration. The use of silica fume was
found to decrease the permeability only slightly [29].
10.3.4 LOW-TEMPERATURE CEMENT
A particular challenge in cementing is the development of compressive strength
in a cement slurry within a reasonable time period at low temperatures. Cement
blends, such as Portland or ultra-fine cement blends, have been used together with
accelerators in order to obtain rapid setting of the cement and the development of
sufficient compressive strength [30]. Special formulations have been developed for
cementing operations in arctic regions or for deep water applications [31–35].
At low temperatures, for example, less than 25 ◦C, an excessive amount of
accelerator is needed to achieve the desired behavior of setting. However, large
amounts of accelerator may result in cement compositions that rapidly form viscous
gels with a premature loss of pumpability.
Alternative formulations have been developed that do not suffer from these
drawbacks. These compositions are based on magnesium oxide [30]. Light-burned
or caustic magnesia is produced by calcining at temperatures ranging from 700
to 1000 ◦C. Light-burned magnesia is characterized by a high surface area, a low
crystallinity and a high degree of reactivity in comparison to other grades of
burned MgO.
The thickening time may be adjusted by the addition of an inhibitor, for example,
sodium hexametaphosphate such that the composition remains pumpable during
downhole placement before a rapid setting will occur.
In low-temperature formations, wherein the cement is subjected to freeze-thaw
cycling, freezing point depressants must be added. Salts may serve as such, but450 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives
traditional organic freezing point depressants, such as ethylene glycol, also may be
added [36–38].
In the case of epoxide cements at temperatures lower than 20 ◦C, the viscosity
increases so much that pumping becomes difficult [39]. Small amounts of aromatic
solvents reduce the viscosity satisfactorily. Ethylene glycol butyl ether also changes
the IFT so that the polymer may penetrate into hairline cracks and fine capillaries.
This is advantageous in blocking liquid or gas migration.
10.3.5 HIGH-ALUMINA CEMENT
High-alumina cement is a rapid-hardening cement made from bauxite and limestone.
It is comparatively resistant to chemical attack. Milling retards the setting of
aluminous cement [40]. On the other hand, setting accelerators such as lithium
carbonate compensate milling. Compositions of high-alumina cement containing
quartz or glass, calcium carbonate, microsilica, carbon black, iron oxide red mud
or screened fly ash, and styrene-butadiene latex have been described [41–43].
10.3.6 MAGNESIAN CEMENT
Innovations in cementing technology have made it possible to place a cement
slurry across a given area, establish the desired seal, and subsequently remove the
blockage by completely dissolving the cement using common oilfield acids [44].
This type of cement is referred to as magnesian cement or magnesium oxychloride
cement.
Magnesian cement is completely soluble in hydrochloric acid. Retarded acid￾soluble well cements contain magnesium oxide, magnesium chloride, additional
borate, and sucrose as a set retarder. Low-density compositions are foamed with
appropriate amounts of gas [45–49].
10.3.7 FIBER CEMENT
Fiber-containing cement was initially developed as a high-strength material that
could be used to line a borehole [50]. Several relatively simple and cheap spin-off
applications of fiber cement have been identified, such as the use of fiber cement
in cement plugs for borehole stabilization and as a lost circulation material. Several
companies are already applying or offering fiber cement for these purposes in the
field, in both organic fibers and metal fibers [51–55].
The benefits of carbon fiber technology have been demonstrated in the building
industry, but have not been investigated for improving set cements in gas and oil
wells. A great potential exists for a technologic breakthrough in difficult cementing
operations. A fourfold increase in toughness and a 50% increase in compressive
strength can be obtained through the addition of carbon fiber.
However, carbon fibers are very expensive, so the benefits may be jeopardized
by the high price. Carbon fiber oxidized by a hot NaOH solution appear to have a10.3 Special cement types 451
potential for use as reinforcement in high-temperature cementitious material systems
[56,57]. It has been found that active carboxylic acid and sodium carboxylate
functional groups introduced on the fiber surfaces by extensive oxidation react
preferentially with Ca2+ ions released from cement in a hydrothermal environment
at 300 ◦C. This interfacial interaction leads to a linkage between the fiber and the
cement matrix, thereby enhancing the bond strength.
Fibers may also have disadvantages. An increase in the number of fibers in the
cement leads to an increase in the porosity and permeability of the cement, resulting
in the decrease of compressive strength. During the acid treatment of the formation,
the fibers in the cement can be easily dislodged and extracted from cracks as smooth
flakes leaving pore spaces [58].
10.3.8 ACID GAS RESISTANT CEMENT
High rate acid gas injection wells pose a significant challenge for the design of
cementing systems. The resistance of Portland cement to carbon dioxide is there
a significant problem. A CO2 resistant Portland system has developed by limiting
the cement concentration and reducing total system permeability by use of specialty
sized particles [59].
On the other hand, the addition of fibers may cause undesired properties of the
cement [58]. Fibers can actually increase pore and fracture systems in latex cements.
The amount of fibers in a fiber seal cement influences the porosity and permeability
while affecting compressive strength. During acid treatment of the formation, the
fibers in the cement can be easily dislodged and extracted from the cracks, leaving
pore spaces behind.
10.3.9 PERMEABLE CEMENT
For the majority of oil well applications it is desirable for the cement to have very
low permeability. However, there are some applications in which permeable cements
are considered as useful.
Typically, such applications are those in which only mechanical support to the
formation or the casing is needed, that is, for poorly consolidated producing zones
that require stabilization [60]. Such permeable cement compositions contain a hollow
particulate material, such as microspheres. These additives allow the formation of a
permeable structure. The advantage is that high contents of foam are avoided, which
can make the slurry difficult to place.
Microspheres are typically formed from aluminosilicate or other glass like
materials. They break down in cement during setting due to chemical reactions and
thermal instability. As these materials are breaking down, porosity is established [60].
A typical material of hollow spheres has average sizes of 50-350 μm.452 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives
10.3.10 SALT WATER STABLE LATEX CEMENT
Cement slurries containing a latex emulsion may coagulate when contacted with a
salt solution. In this way, a gelled mixture is formed that is no longer useful as a
cement sealant composition. However, special formulations of cement slurries have
been developed that are stable to salt water.
There, the latex must be premixed with a stabilizer until a homogenous so￾lution is formed. Then the latex can be safely contacted with the salt water.
Suitable latex stabilizers are ethoxylated nonyl phenol and oligo ethoxylated iso￾dodecyl alcohol ether sulfate [61]. Actually, these compounds belong to the class of
surfactants.
10.3.11 SETTABLE DRILLING FLUIDS
Aqueous-based drilling fluids can be converted into settable drilling fluids. Cement
kiln dust is added to the aqueous-based drilling fluid to form the settable drilling
fluid [62].
Basically, a settable drilling fluid should be formulated so that it is compatible
with the drilling fluid that is remaining in the well bore. The use of a settable
drilling fluid may alleviate problems associated with the disposal of a used drilling
fluid. Several examples of formulation of such types of drilling fluids have been
presented [62].
10.4 CLASSIFICATION OF CEMENT ADDITIVES
Cement additives have been classified into six categories [63]. In fact, this classifica￾tion is crude. The World Oil Cementing Supplements regularly review commercially
available cementing additives in certain World Oil issues [64–67]. There, compre￾hensive listings of cementing products and additives available from major suppliers
can be found. The products are grouped into functional categories as shown in
Table 10.7.
Products commercially available also can be found readily on the World Wide
Web. Individual compounds may emerge in more than one of the categories listed in
Table 10.7. For example, rubber particles reduce the density of the slurry and are also
suitable as lost circulation additives.
Fluid loss refers to filtration of certain components of the fluid into the forma￾tion. Lost circulation is the total material lost into high-permeability thief zones.
Table 10.8 gives a summary of additives to control special problems [2].
Additives play a significant role in oil and gas well cementing operations [69].
Many types of cement additives have been developed to allow the use of Portland
cement in a variety of oil and gas well operations. In an attempt to formulate the
appropriate cement slurry for any cementing job, the right additive must be selected
and the right quantity must be added.10.4 Classification of cement additives 453

Additives have different functions and can be classified as accelerators, retarders
[70], extenders [71], fluid loss agents [72], and dispersants. In addition, each of the
above classification has different categories of additives that have been developed to
perform almost the same function during cement slurry design.454 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives
The classifications of oil well additives have been reviewed to show the com￾monly used additives during oil and gas well cementing operations [69].
10.4.1 SYNERGISTIC AND ANTAGONISTIC EFFECTS BETWEEN
CEMENT ADDITIVES
The synergistic and antagonistic effects between oilwell cement additives have been
reviewed [73]. Oilwell cement slurries commonly incorporate several admixtures
such as retarder, dispersant, fluid-loss additive, anti freeze water agent, and defoamer.
Between these compounds interactions may occur that can result in incompatibilities
and reduced performances or, oppositely, in improved effectiveness. An overview of
some synergistic and antagonistic effects between selected cement additives has been
presented.
The interaction between 2-acrylamido-tert-butyl sulfonic acid-co-N,
N-dimethy lacrylamide and an NaATBS-co-itaconic acid retarder as well as welan
gum, an anionic biopolymer applied as an antifree-water additive, was investigated.
It was found that the retarder, which possesses a particularly high-anionic
charge,reduces the effectiveness of the 2-Acrylamido-tert-butyl sulfonic acid-co￾N,N-dimethylacrylamide by decreasing its amount adsorbed on cement. The incorpo￾ration of stronger anchor groups, for example, dicarboxylates or phosphonates, into
the formulation enhances its affinity for the surface of cement and thus renders it
more robust against the negative impact from other admixtures [73].
Many additives cause foaming problems, but if a slurry foams excessively, during
mixing, centrifugal pump will air lock, and mixing must be stopped. Therefore,
antifoams are introduced in cement slurries to decrease foaming and minimize air
entrainment during mixing [74].
Excessive foaming can also result in an underestimation of the density downhole
and cavitation of the mixing system. The additives modify the surface tension in the
cement slurry so that foaming is prevented or the foam breaks up. The concentration
required to be effective is very small, typically less than 0.1% of water. Antifoam
agents consist primarily of polyglycol or silicones or a mixture of both, and may also
include additional surfactants.
Oil well cements are slurries that fill the annular space between the borehole and
the steel casing in oil perforation [75]. These cements must have special features to
achieve many properties that are necessary for a fluid that flows at high pressures,
high temperatures, and great depths. These features can be achieved with the use of
additive polymers. Some of the admixtures based on renewable biomass products
were described in a chapter of a monograph [75].
Some of these are cellulose ethers [76], which are used as fluid loss agents,
lignosulfonates [77], which are used as dispersants, xanthan [78], welan gum
[79,80], and other microbial polysaccharides, which are mainly used as viscosity
modifiers, and microcellulose and nanocellulose [81,82] fibers, which are used as
loss circulation agents [75].10.4 Classification of cement additives 455

10.4.2 LIGHT-WEIGHT CEMENT
Adding low-density materials reduces the density of a cement composition. These
additives are referred to as extenders, because they reduce the demand of the
cement itself, at the cost of other desirable properties, such as set strength. Generally,
extenders, such as silicates are not chemically inert, but may be reactive. Light￾weight additives are summarized in Table 10.9.
Bentonite
Bentonite is used in secondary cementing operations [99]. High percentages of
bentonite significantly reduce the specific weight of the slurry. Bentonite is dry
blended to the cement. The addition of bentonite requires more water. Bentonite has
been used up to 25%.
The additive also increases the viscosity of the slurry. High amounts of bentonite
increase the permeability and reduce the final strength. Therefore high concentrations
of bentonite are not recommended.
Furnace slag
A furnace slag cement slurry can have a density of 1500-1600 kg m−3. A combination
of silica flour and furnace slag may be used to achieve service temperatures exceeding
200 ◦C [100]. A gas may be suitable as a foaming agent [101].456 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives
Hollow glass microspheres
Glass beads with diameters of 2-200 μm and densities of 600-700 kg m−3 can be
mixed with a cement slurry in certain proportions to form a low-density glass bead
slurry. The glass beads are used to reduce weight.
Laboratory experiments showed that the slurry is effective in improving cement￾ing quality for low-pressure and low-permeability formations. Low-density cement
with hollow microspheres is often not stable. This results from the comparatively
low-plastic viscosity [102]. The plastic viscosity of the cement slurry must exceed
40 MPa to improve the cement quality and eliminate fluid channeling.
When porous glass particles are used, they are filled with water. The cement slurry
will absorb extra water from the pores of the porous particles, thus counteracting the
shrinkage during setting [84].
Ceramic microspheres
Materials formed by acid-base reactions between calcium aluminate compounds and
phosphate-containing solutions yield high-strength, low-permeability, CO2 resistant
cements when cured in hydrothermal environments. The addition of hollow alu￾minosilicate microspheres to the uncured matrix constituents yields slurries with
densities as low as approximately 1200 kg m−3, which cure to produce materials with
properties meeting the criteria for well cementing. These formulations also exhibit
low rates of carbonation. The cementing formulations are pumpable at temperatures
up to 150 ◦C.
Ceramic microspheres for cementing applications may replace blast furnace slag
and Portland cement in any well cementing operation. The ceramic microspheres are
an advantageous well cementing constituent that may be successfully implemented
in differing temperature dependent processes, such as the steam injection technique
employed for heavy crude oil extraction. A method for manufacturing ceramic
microspheres consists of [103]:
• grinding industrial slag,
• feeding into a vibration feeder,
• heating with a gas/oxygen mix flame to 1200-2500 ◦C,
• spheroidizing by propelling away from the burner.
As the pyrolized particles are propelled away from burner, they begin to rapidly
cool in air and are spheroidized. The microspheres settle at a distance to burner that
is dependent on their diameters. The composition of slags of varying provenience is
summarized in Table 10.10.
The ceramic microspheres can be used in cementing applications. Light-weight
cement slurries can be formulated that are resistant to elevated temperatures and
thermal cycling, such as used in steam injection techniques [103].
Gilsonite
Gilsonite, a solid hydrocarbon, was introduced to the oil Industry in 1957 as a cement
additive [104]. Gilsonite (Uintaite) is an asphalt with a density of 1050-1150 kg m−3,10.4 Classification of cement additives 457

a melting point of 140-160 ◦C, and an ultimate composition of approximately 85%
C, 10% H, 2.5% N, 1.5% O. It is soluble in organic solvents and occurs naturally in
Utah and Colorado. More details are given in Chapter 1.5.16.
The unique properties of Gilsonite, such as low specific gravity, particle-size
distribution, impermeability, resistance to corrosive fluids, chemical inertness, and
low water requirements result in slurries with exceptional bridging properties,
low slurry weight, compatibility with other slurry additives, and relatively high
compressive strength.
Pozzolan
Pozzolan is a very finely ground pumice or fly ash. The specific gravity of pozzolan
is only slightly less than cement. Therefore only a slight reduction of the specific
weight can be achieved. On the other hand, pozzolan is inexpensive. Pozzolan has
been proposed in several formulations. Silica fume has been proposed as a substitute
for natural pozzolan.
Silica fume is a pozzolanic material composed of extremely fine, amorphous
spheres produced as a byproduct in the manufacture of silicon metals. It has a high
water demand and it is more reactive than natural pozzolan or fly ash. It increases the
compressive strength significantly.
Rubber
Addition of rubber particles of 30-100% to cement with a grain size of approximately
40-60 mesh (0.4-0.25 mm) will produce a light-weight cement. The addition of
rubber particles also creates a low permeability.
The compositions are advantageous for cementing zones subjected to extreme
dynamic stresses such as perforation zones and the junctions of branches in a
multi-sidetrack well. Recycled, expanded PS lowers the density of a hydraulic
cement formulation and is an environmental-friendly solution for downcycling waste
materials.458 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives
Coal
Coal has been used as a very-low-gravity additive. Coal does not require a significant
amount of additional water when added to the cement.
Diatomaceous earth
Diatomaceous earth has a lower specific gravity than bentonite. In contrast to
bentonite, it will not increase the viscosity of the slurry. Diatomaceous earth
concentrations of up to 40% have been used.
Perlite
Expanded perlite requires a large amount of water when added to the slurry. It is often
used in a blend with volcanic glass fines, or with pozzolan, along with bentonite.
Without additional bentonite, perlite tends to separate and float to the upper part of
the slurry.
10.4.3 FOAM CEMENT
Foam cement is a special class of light-weight cement. The gas content of foamed
cement can be up to 75% by volume. When cement compositions should be foamed,
a foaming additive must be included in the cement composition [105].
The cement can be foamed by direct injection of the foaming additive into the
composition. For instance, where the cement composition is foamed by the direct
injection of gas into the composition, the gas utilized can be air or any suitable inert
gas, such as nitrogen, or even a mixture of such gases. Usually, nitrogen is used.
Otherwise, the cement is foamed by a gas generated by a reaction between the
cement slurry and an foaming additive present in the cement in particulate form.
For example, the composition may be foamed by hydrogen gas generated in situ
as the product of a reaction between the high pH slurry and fine aluminum powder
present in the cement.
A typical foamed cement composition is made from a hydraulic cement, an
aqueous rubber latex in an amount up to 45% of the hydraulic cement, a latex
stabilizer, a defoaming agent, a gas, a foaming agent, and a foam stabilizer
[106,107].
Foamed cement compositions, which include isopropyl alcohol, may nega￾tively impact aquatic life. In addition, one or more of the components are often
flammable, thereby increasing the expense of shipping the foaming and stabilizing
additives [108].
Foamed high-temperature applications are based on calcium phosphate cement
[109]. If a foaming additive in particulate form is used, aluminum powder, gypsum
blends, and deadburned magnesium oxide are preferred. Preferred foaming additives
comprising aluminum powder are commercially available under the tradenames
GAS-CHEK® and SUPER CBL.
Further, a blend containing gypsum is commercially available under the trade￾name MICROBOND™. Foaming additives comprising deadburned magnesium10.4 Classification of cement additives 459

oxide are available under the tradename MICROBOND™ M and MICROBOND™,
all from Halliburton Energy Services [105]. The stability of the foam is achieved by
the addition of surfactants, as shown in Table 10.11.
10.4.4 DENSITY-INCREASING OR WEIGHTING AGENTS
Weighting agents (Table 10.12) are added to increase the density of the cement.
They are typically used to combat high bottom hole pressures. Common additives
are powdered iron, ferromat, powdered magnetite, and barite. Hematite can be used
to increase the density of a mixture up to 2200 kg m−3 (19 lb/gal). Hematite requires
the addition of some water.
Ilmenite has a specific gravity of 4700 kg m−3. It requires no addition of water
when added to the slurry. Ilmenite has a minimal effect on the thickening time and
compressive strength. Barite requires more water then hematite when added to the
cement. This results in a decrease of the compressive strength of the set cement.
10.4.5 THICKENING AND SETTING TIME CONTROL
Often it is necessary to influence the setting time, either by accelerators or by
retarders. If a cement is to be placed into a shallow depth, then acceleration of setting
will be desirable to avoid unnecessary waiting times. On the other hand, in a deep
formation more open time is required, which may require the addition of retarders.
Cement retarders
Examples of retarders are shown in Table 10.13. They are added to prevent cement
from setting too rapidly. These additives are also referred to as set retarders. Cements460 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives

with retarders to prevent rapid setting may be used at the high-temperature and
high-pressure environments of deep wells. Common retarders are lignosulfonate
and certain carbohydrate derivatives, such as welan gum, xanthan gum, cellulose,
and polyanionic cellulose.
Carrageenan, a high-molecular-weight poly(saccharide) derived from seaweed,
produces an exceptionally stable storable liquid that is superior to those typically
employed in storable cement slurries. Carrageenan gums are ionic linear
poly(saccharide)s composed of repeating galactose units that individually may
be sulfated or unsulfated. Specific carrageenan types include κ-carrageenan,
ι-carrageenan, and λ-carrageenan.
Typically, ι-carrageenan is employed. Mixtures of carrageenan types are also
possible. The properties of the individual carrageenan types primarily depend on
the number and position of sulfate groups on the repeating galactose units. In the
presence of excess cations, κ-carrageenan and ι-carrageenan form gels [127]. The
structure of carrageenan is shown in Figure 10.2. Carrageenan is also used as a
thickener in food applications, such as ice cream.10.4 Classification of cement additives 461

Cement accelerators
Cement accelerators are shown in Table 10.14. The most common accelerators
are calcium chloride and sodium chloride. Calcium chloride may be used in
concentrations up to 4% in wells with bottom hole temperatures less than 50 ◦C.
Calcium chloride tends to increase the final strength under pressure conditions.
Sodium chloride can be used as an accelerator in formulations that are bentonite
free. The maximal bottom hole temperature is 70 ◦C. In concentrations above 5%,
the effectiveness is reduced. Saturated sodium chloride solutions act as retarders.
Special grades of gypsum hemihydrate are blended with Portland cement for
types with reduced thickening time and setting time. Gypsum requires significantly
more water addition. The maximal application temperatures are 70-80 ◦C. Sodium
silicate is used for cement slurries with diatomaceous earth. It can be used up to 7%.
The addition of sodium sulfate to Portland cement accelerates the cement hard￾ening and increases mobility of the solution. Chloride-free accelerators have been
developed. Trihydroxybenzoic acid is a weak accelerator. It eliminates the dormant
period in the curing process, as does as 4,5-dihydroxy-m-benzenedisulfonate. The
recommended amount of dry cement is 0.1-5.0% [141]. Some cement accelerators
are listed in Table 10.14 and shown in Figure 10.3.
Nanosilicas
Accelerators are important cementing additives in deepwater wells, where low
temperatures can lengthen the wait-on-cement (WOC) time, potentially increasing
the cost of operations. The cement-set accelerators traditionally used for shortening
WOC times are inorganic salts, such as calcium chloride. These accelerators are
known to have the potentially negative side effect of increasing the set-cement
permeability.
On the other hand, nanosilicas can be advantageous compared with conventional
cement-set accelerators because they reduce the permeability and increase the
mechanical strength of cement-based materials. For this reason, nanosilicas are
known to be particularly good candidates as replacement materials for traditional salt
accelerators. This study investigates the feasibility of the use of different sizes and
aspect ratios of nanosilicas as cement hydration accelerators under low-temperature
conditions of 15 ◦C [146].462 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives

Cement accelerators.
The nanosilica activities are defined through their comparative advantages with
respect to traditional accelerators, as well as through the advantages and disadvan￾tages of the different nanosilicas resulting from their various sizes and shapes.
Although hydration of oilwell cement is known to be accelerated by the addition
of nanosilica, the effects of nanosilica particle shape on cement hydration kinetics
has not been investigated. Isothermal calorimetry experiments revealed that just as
smaller nanosilica particle sizes increase the cement-set acceleration, so do higher
nanosilica aspect ratios [146].
The effects of the slurry density on the relative merits of CaCl2 and nanosilicas
have also been investigated. In regular-weight slurries, the effectiveness of nanosilica
acceleration appears to be weaker than that of CaCl2, especially during early ages
of smaller than 3 days. In light-weight slurries, the effectiveness of nanosilica10.4 Classification of cement additives 463
acceleration can be much stronger than that of CaCl2, especially when mid- to long￾term properties >2 days are considered.
Smaller particle sizes and higher aspect ratios enhance the acceleration effect of
nanosilicas. The compressive-strength development of light-weight oilwell cements
with and without accelerators was also investigated. Light-weight cements acceler￾ated with nanosilica displayed 7-day compressive strengths up to 136% higher than
those accelerated with CaCl2 [146].
Zeolites
In most cases, it is possible to accelerate or retard the setting time by using
conventional cement additives, however, special properties can be achieved by
zeolithes. Zeolites are known to be pozzolanic materials and may be activated with
alkali or Portland cement in the presence of sufficient water.
However, further properties of a zeolite-containing composition such as compres￾sive strength development, early strength, rheology, and density, for example, are of
industrial concern [147]. Zeolites that have been claimed to be suitable for use in
oilfield operations are summarized in Table 10.15.
Chabazite and clinoptilolite are particularly useful zeolithes [148].
Intergrinding zeolite and cement clinker have been found to provide a bimodal
distribution of particle size in the grind. Further, increased strength properties of the
cementitious set material were observed, in particular at longer set times. However,
an increased compressive strength of the interground set material was not observed,
when hand-ground gypsum was added to the slurry of the interground clinker and
zeolite material [148].

10.4.6 VISCOSITY CONTROL
The viscosity of a cement affects the pumping properties. The viscosity must be
kept low enough to ensure pumpability of the slurry during the entire period of the
operation. In deep wells, because of the increased temperature, the viscosity becomes
increasingly lower, which leads to an undesirable flow characteristics of the slurry.
This effect can be serious, because the viscosity follows the Arrhenius law.
Viscosifying additives are often used in well cement compositions to prevent the
settling of solids in the cement compositions after they are placed in a subterranean
zone to be cemented. While such cement composition viscosifying additives have
been utilized successfully at subterranean temperatures up to about 190 ◦C, at
higher temperatures the conventional viscosifying additives cannot prevent thermal
thinning.
This results in the settling of solids in cement compositions. The settling of the
solids in a cement composition results in defective cementing and failure of the set
cement to provide zonal isolation [105].
Some of the additives used for viscosity control also may act as accelerators.
Additives for viscosity control are shown in Table 10.16.
Thermal thinning
To combat the effect of thermal thinning, latex is added to a cement slurry without a
latex stabilizing surfactant, resulting in a slurry having low mixing viscosity and good
solid-suspension properties at downhole temperatures. The latex emulsion inverts
or breaks downhole, thereby providing the necessary viscosity and gel strength to
compensate for thermal thinning and to keep the solids suspended in the cement
slurry.
The inverted latex emulsion coagulates, forming rubberlike particles that increase
the viscosity and gel strength of the cement slurry. No additional viscosifying agents
are required to prevent the solids from settling.

10.4.7 DISPERSANTS
The use of surface active agents in cements has primarily two main goals. They
act as retarding agents and dispersing agents. Dispersants improve the rheological
properties. In particular, dispersants are added to cement slurries to facilitate the
blending at high densities without the demand for excess water. They also enhance
the flow behavior of the cement slurry and allow the slurry to be pumped into a
turbulent flow regime, thereby effecting a better bonding between the well casing
and the rock formation.
Furthermore, dispersants may exhibit side effects: They enhance the action of
fluid loss additives and enhance the effectiveness of the retarder. Dispersants are
widely used as oilfield chemicals, besides in cementing activities. The applications in
the field of cementing technology are summarized in Table 10.17. Some ingredients
are shown in Figure 10.4.
A number of dispersing agents have been utilized heretofore in cement composi￾tions, particularly in cement compositions used for primary and remedial cementing
in oil and gas wells [174]. Organic acids, such as gluconic acid and citric acids are
in addition strong set retarding agents. Thus, an organic acid dispersant in a cement466 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives

composition prevents the cement composition from setting for a relatively longer
period of time.
The set retarding characteristics of lignosulfonates can be substantially eliminated
by blocking the phenolic hydroxy group content of the lignosulfonate. To minimize
the presence of free phenolic hydroxy groups in the lignin, such groups are blocked
by reacting the lignosulfonate with, for example, propylene oxide.
Other dispersants that are commonly used in hydraulic cement compositions
include poly(napthalene sulfonate), poly(β-naphthol sulfonate), poly(melamine sul￾fonate). While such dispersants function very well in cement compositions, they can
be environmentally unacceptable, especially in offshore operations where particular
ecological properties may be required [174].
Biodegradable dispersants have been described that are based on starch [179].
These are basically sulfite adducts of an oxidized starch.
Dispersants also known as friction reducing additives are added to improve upon
the flow properties of cement slurry [72,82]. In particular, they are used to offset
overly high viscosity and some tendencies typical for slurries [72]. Polynapthalene
sulfonates are the most widely used materials for dispersing cement particles in10.4 Classification of cement additives 467
slurries. These materials are available as calcium and/or sodium salts, and can be
obtained in both solid and liquid form. The commercial liquid form typically has a
solids content of approximately 40%.
10.4.8 EXPANSION ADDITIVES
During setting, cement normally undergoes shrinkage. By adding expandable
swelling additives into the matrix, the shrinkage can be combated. Expanding cement
is used in water shutoff technology and plugging. Expansion additives should not be
confused with additives used for foam cement.
A series of test methods and procedures have been developed to measure these
phenomena [180]. Cracks should be avoided because these increase the permeability
of the cement. The expansion of the cement, without the formation of macro-fissures,
depends on the time at which the expanding additives (e.g., CaO or MgO) crystallize
out [181–183].
The cement expansion should occur predominantly in the setting phase of plastic
deformability of the cement matrix to fill in existing cavities. A certain controlled
amount of expansion should also occur in a phase of higher strength of the matrix
[184]. The expansion characteristics of CaO and MgO [185] depend on the thermal
history of burning, which can be optimized for specific requirements.
Dead burned magnesium oxide is suitable as an expanding additive [186–188].
The expansion occurs by a hydration mechanism. The additive is particularly
effective when used at setting temperatures greater than approximately 150 ◦C.
Enhanced adhesion of expanded cements can be achieved by the addition of urea￾formaldehyde resins [189].
10.4.9 SET STRENGTH ENHANCEMENT
Dialkanol aminoalkyl phenols as admixtures enhance the strength [190]. The ad￾ditives are useful in very small amounts and do not affect the initial properties of
the fluid. The strength additive does not cause set acceleration or early set strength
enhancement but provides enhanced compressive strength of the cement in later
stages.
Addition of small amounts of potassium ferricyanide and nitrilo trimethyl
phosphonic acid promotes the formation of complex compounds and thus increases
the strength of cement rock [191].
Fibers
A mixture of a reactive aluminum silicate and a fibrous mineral, such as wol￾lastonite [192], improves the compressive strength, flexural strength, and tensile
strength over conventional cement compositions. Wollastonite is typically available
as very fine fibers or microfibers having diameters similar to those of cement
particles (typically approximately 25-40 μm) and a fiber length typically between 0.4
and 0.6 mm.468 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives
Alternatively, the cement composition may include consolidating fibers, such as
nylon or poly(propylene) fibers. These reduce the potential for cement debris formed
under high-stress conditions. Consolidating fibers are typically added to a cement
composition in an amount between 0.25 and 5.0 pounds per sack.
10.4.10 ADHESION IMPROVEMENT
A cement slurry additive consisting of methyl cellulose, melamine-formaldehyde
resin, and trioxane has been proposed for better bonding of cement to the casing
string [193]. Bisphenol-A epoxide resins, with amine based curing agents, sand filler,
and a mixture of n-butanol and dimethyl benzene as a diluent, have been proposed as
additives to increase the adhesion properties of cement [194].
Quaternary ammonium salts (C10 to C18 alkyl benzyl dimethyl ammonium
chloride) added in 40 ppm and 2% of sodium chloride effect an increase in the
strength of the cement rock and the adhesion properties by 50-80% [195].
10.4.11 FLUID LOSS CONTROL
Fluid loss control agents, also addressed as filtration control additives, are used in
well cement compositions to reduce the fluid loss from the cement compositions
to permeable formations or zones into or through which the cement compositions
are pumped. In primary cementing, the loss of fluid, that is, water, to permeable
subterranean formations or zones can result in premature gelation of the cement
composition whereby bridging of the annular space between the permeable formation
or zone and the pipe string being cemented therein prevents the cement composition
from being placed over the entire length of the annulus [105].
Filtration control additives are added to cements for the same reason as they
are used in drilling fluids. Untreated cement slurries, however, have much greater
filtration rates than do untreated drilling muds. Therefore it is very important to limit
the loss of water from a slurry into a permeable formation. This is necessary for
several reasons:
• to minimize hydration of water sensitive formations,
• to allow sufficient water to be available for cement hydration,
• to avoid a modification of the slurry properties, that is, rheology, density,
thickening time,
• to avoid a bridging of the annular gap.
However, the mechanism of action of filtration control additives is not yet
completely understood. Examples are bentonite, latex, and various organic polymers.
Many additives for fluid loss are water-soluble polymers.
A viscosifying and fluid loss controlling additive for well cement compositions
is basically a mixture of a copolymer and a homopolymer. The copolymer is made
from [105]:10.4 Classification of cement additives 469
1. comonomers that are calcium tolerant, of anionic nature and disperse basic
cement slurries;
2. comonomers that may hydrolyze in basic cement slurries to generate anionic
carboxylate groups that bind with calcium, viscosify the slurries and prevent
settling in the slurries;
3. comonomers that generate non-ionic pendant groups on the polymer
upon hydrolysis in basic cement slurries to prevent polymer
precipitation.
Examples for the first type of comonomer are AMPS, vinylsulfonate, allyl
sulfonate, 3-allyloxy-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid, and their salts.
Examples for the second type of comonomer are selected from acrylonitrile,
acrylamide (AAm), tert-butyl acrylate, N,N-dialkylacrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone,
AMPS, and acrylic esters. Other fluid loss additives for cements are summarized in
Table 10.18.
Water-soluble AAm tert-butylsulfonic acid based copolymers are commonly used
to provide fluid loss control for oil well cement slurries. Welan gum can negatively
impact the effectiveness of these copolymers. Namely, it competes with the polymer
for the adsorption sites on the surfaces of cement and silica [204]. Their impact
generally depends on their anionic charge density, the quality of their anchor group
to the cement or silica surface and their concentration.

Water-soluble azo compounds serve as radical initiators for polymerization,
for example, 2,2’-azobis(N,N’-dimethylene isobutyramidine)dihydrochloride,
2,2’-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride, and 2,2’-azobis[2-methyl-N-(2-
hydroxyethyl)propionamide]. Azo initiators decompose thermally into radicals, thus
initiating an in situ polymerization. The azo initiator is combined with the aqueous
solution containing the monomer [8].
The comonomers of the third group are N-alkyl-N-vinylalkanamides such as
N-methyl-N-vinylacetamide, allyl glycidyl ether or vinylacetate [105,205]. The
copolymerization of AMPS with conjugate monomers yields a fluid loss agent
whose properties include minimal retardation, salt tolerance, high efficiency, thermal
stability, and excellent solids support [205].
The ratio of the comonomers is selected such that the copolymer does not
viscosify the slurries excessively under ambient conditions, but upon undergoing
hydrolysis reactions in the cement slurries during placement, the polymer will
continuously generate sufficient carboxylate groups at downhole temperatures to
react with the calcium ions present in the slurries in crosslinking reactions and
viscosify the slurries to counteract the thermal thinning of the slurries. Thus, the
higher the downhole temperature, the greater the thermal thinning of cement slurries
and the greater the rate of slurry viscosification due to carboxylate generating
hydrolysis reactions.
Different homopolymers containing carboxylate moieties can be used in
combination with the above-described copolymer. For example, it has been found
that the polymer can be used in a synergistic mixture with other homopolymers.
The above-described copolymer can be used advantageously in admixture with
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) or poly(acrylamide) for preventing particle settling in cement
slurries [105].
Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) works by reducing the permeability of the filter cake
through coalescence of hydrated PVA microgel particles which then form a polymer
film. At temperatures above 38 ◦C, the non-crosslinked PVA starts to dissolve in
water. Therefore, above this temperature, the formation of a film is no longer possible
and fluid loss control cannot be not achieved [206]. However, the addition of an
acetone-formaldehyde-sulfite polycondensate as dispersant extends the temperature
range at which PVA can successfully used.
Furthermore, anionic aromatic polymers have been identified that simultaneously
impart to salt-rich cement slurries improved fluid loss control and adequate rheologic
properties. An advantage offered by these anionic aromatic polymers is their use even
at low bottom hole circulating temperatures.
Commonly, the inclusion of fluid loss control additives, or friction reducers, is
contraindicated in salt-rich systems when circulating temperatures are below 65 ◦C,
because the conventional additives cause an excessive retardation of the setting time.
Anionic aromatic polymer systems still display acceptably short thickening times
(<6 h) and good early strength development when circulating temperatures are as
low as 50 ◦C.10.4 Classification of cement additives 471
Certain natural based polymers have been used as fluid loss control additives in
cementing operations. These include HEC, carboxymethylhydroxyethyl cellulose,
copolymers of AMPS and AAm or N,N-dimethylacrylamide. In addition, graft
copolymers with a lignin or lignite backbone and AMPS, acrylonitrile, and N,N￾dimethylacrylamide as grafted moieties have been used as fluid loss control additives.
A recently developed variety is a graft copolymer with a backbone of a humic
acid salt similar monomers as mentioned before. These include in particular AMPS
and AAm, acrylic acid, vinylphosphonic acid, diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride,
and the corresponding salts [207].
Gilsonite is active as a fluid loss additive because the permeability of cement is
reduced. Latex additives also act as fluid loss additives. They also act as bonding
aids, gas migration preventers, and matrix intensifiers.
They improve the elasticity of the cement and the resistance to corrosive
fluids [208]. A styrene-butadiene latex in combination with non-ionic and anionic
surfactants shows less fluid loss. The styrene-butadiene latex is added in an amount
up to 30% of the dry cement. The ratio of styrene to butadiene in the latex is
typically 2:1. In addition, a non-ionic surfactant, octylphenol ethoxylate and poly
(ethylene oxide), or an anionic surfactant, a copolymer of MA, and 2-hydroxypropyl
acrylate [162] can be added in amounts up to 2%.
Organic fluid loss additives
It may be difficult to formulate a water-based fluid loss concentrate from some
water swellable polymers because the polymer can form fish eyes in the aqueous
liquid [209]. A fish eye generally occurs during the process of blending the water
swellable polymer with the aqueous liquid. Fish eyes are balls of unhydrated polymer
surrounded by a gelatinous covering of hydrated polymer. Fish eyes prevent water
from contacting the interior of the fish eye and the unhydrated polymer contained
therein. Fish eyes can be difficult to break apart once formed. A liquid concentrate
containing fish eyes is not a homogenous system. However, it is desirable to have a
homogenous liquid concentrate.
In order to avoid the problem of fish-eye formation, an oil-based suspension
containing a water swellable polymer can be used. However, an oil-based suspension
containing a water swellable polymer can have poor stability. The water swellable
polymer in an oil-based concentrate can also stick onto the wall of a container, which
can cause difficulty during pouring. Instability refers to a suspension, in which the
uniformly dispersed undissolved solids settle out of the liquid continuous phase over
time. By contrast, a stable suspension can remain homogenous over the course of
several days to several months [209].
Another problem with using an oil-based suspension is that the hydrocarbon
liquid may not be biodegradable or biocompatible. Moreover, for an oil-based
suspension, the hydrocarbon liquid is not mixable with a water-based cement
composition. As a result, surfactants and other chemicals are required to emulsify
the oil in the cement composition, which leads to a still more complicated system.472 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives
It has been found that a well treatment composition can be made as a liquid
concentrate containing [209]:
1. a water-soluble, organic liquid;
2. a high molecular weight, water swellable polymer as a fluid loss additive;
3. an organophilic clay suspending agent.
Some of the advantages of the well treatment composition is that the composition
is more homogenous, more stable, less viscous, pours more easily, is soluble in
water, and has a higher activity in comparison to certain oil- and water-based
concentrates [209].
As organic liquid poly(ethylene glycol) is used and as fluid loss additive a
water swellable AMPS based random copolymer is used. The suspending agent
comprises an organophilic clay [209]. An organophilic clay is a clay possessing
a cationic exchange capacity that has been coated with a fatty-acid quaternary
amine that associates with an organic liquid. An example of such as clay is
organophilic attapulgite. A commercially available example of an organophilic clay
is Suspentone®, marketed by Halliburton.
10.4.12 CLAY CONTROL ADDITIVES
The cementing technology can be improved in wells with zones containing clays or
shales that are sensitive to fresh water cement filtrate. Sodium chloride and potassium
chloride (KCl) have been the primary materials of choice to yield a filtrate that
damages these zones less.
However, the unfavorable effects of salt on cement have been extensively
documented, in particular, the negative impact of KCl on cements. Instead of
inorganic salts, quaternary ammonium salts of aliphatic tertiary amines have been
tested [210–212]. These additives impart superior clay controlling properties without
the undesirable side effects of either sodium or potassium chloride.
10.4.13 ANTI-GAS-MIGRATION AGENTS
Gas channeling can occur during the setting of a cement slurry. The formation of
channels is dependent on the setting characteristics, and additives can influence this.
During the setting period of a cement, two time cycles of cement expansion and
contraction are observed [213,214].
This is due to the individual contribution of each component in the cement
mixture. To obtain the optimal tightness of the cement, the final contraction is
crucial for blocking gas migration. Ironite sponge, synthetic rubber powder, and
anchorage clay have been tested [214,215] as permeability reducers. These materials
are environmentally safe and inexpensive. Proper amounts of these additives can be
used to optimize the compressive strength and to eliminate both microfractures and
the formation of a microannulus. A copolymer of AMPS, N-vinylacylamide, and
AAm reduces gas channeling [216].10.4 Classification of cement additives 473
Carbon black may serve as a low-cost additive for controlling the gas migration
in cement slurries [217]. It is intended as a suitable substitute for polymer latex and
silica fume and has been tested in field applications [218,219].
The concentration of carbon black varies from 2 to 20 parts, based on the weight
of the dry cement [173]. The particle size varies from 10 to 200 nm. A surfactant
is necessary for dispersion, for example, formaldehyde-condensed naphthalene
sulfonate or sulfonated cumarone or indene resins.
A mixture of lignosulfonates, alkali-treated brown coal, and minor amounts of
organic silicon compounds reduce the permeability of cements [220]. The additives
may interact with the crystallization centers of the cement slurry and form a gel sys￾tem in its pores and capillaries, thus reducing the permeability of the cement and in￾creasing its isolating capability. Furthermore, it is claimed that the additive retards the
setting rate of cement up to 200 ◦C and increases the resistance to corrosive media.
Phosphorated aluminum powder reacts with calcium hydroxide in the cement
slurry during setting and produces hydrogen. The gas swells the cement slurry. Thus,
the additive prevents the channeling of oil, gas, and water [221–223].
10.4.14 CORROSION INHIBITORS
Main factors that are responsible for the corrosion of the cement sheath in wells
have determined on the basis of laboratory tests and field analyses from a literature
survey [224].
The chemistry, mineralogy, and physical properties of American Petroleum
Institute (API) well cements and their mechanisms of corrosion in the presence
of aggressive formation and injection fluids is reviewed. API cement hydration
mainly produces calcium silicate hydrate phases, which are responsible for the
strength, and portlandite Ca(OH)2, which is basically a weak point within the cement
matrix.
An increase of the permeability and the portlandite content reduces strength, and
chemical resistance of set cement toward corrosive media. The addition of pozzolanic
materials eliminates the portlandite materials and allows a lowering of the water
content in the cement system. Both effects will reduce the permeability and can
improve the mechanical properties of a set cement.
Practical concepts for improvements of the cement sheath with respect to the
design or the cement slurry, cementing process, and the impact of factors such
as temperature or cement admixtures to mitigate cement corrosion have been
presented [224].
Ground water with high salinity, high CO2 content, and sulfate-reducing bacteria
corrodes the cement by dissolution, chemical, and expansion actions. By improving
the permeability of the cement and by reducing the content of Ca(OH)2 in the cement,
anticorrosion effects can be promoted.
Addition of silica flour changes the proportion of calcium and silica and the
composition of the hydrates. Homogeneity, tightness, small pore channels, and low
permeability improve the cement strength and anticorrosion effects [225]. Hydrazine
chloride has been proposed for inhibiting the corrosion of the casing [226].474 CHAPTER 10 Cement additives
10.4.15 OTHER CHEMICAL ATTACK
Portland cement is susceptible to corrosion by CO2 and H2S. The chemical attack by
CO2 is called carbonation. A microsample technique has been developed to study the
CO2 corrosion in cements, because the corrosion is difficult to monitor with common
test procedures [227].
This technique is also advantageous as an accelerated testing method. A polymer￾modified cement has been tested in field studies [228]. The addition of silica also
improves chemical resistance, in particular brine corrosion [229].
10.4.16 USE OF WASTE OF OTHER INDUSTRIAL BRANCHES
Proper waste management becomes increasingly important with increasing amounts
of waste created by modern civilization. In cementing technology, wastes from
various sources can be used in various ways. The activities may be subdivided into
two main classes:
• use of wastes as raw material or secondary fuel in cement manufacture,
• direct use of wastes as additives for oil well cements.
We discuss several issues in detail here some of which were mentioned briefly in
previous sections.
Cement manufacture with wastes
In the manufacture of Portland cement, many otherwise-waste materials can be used
either as a substitute for the traditional raw material, or as a secondary fuel (e.g., used
tires) [230,231]. In particular, drilling wastes can be introduced in the clinker burning
process [232].
For both waste disposal and cement manufacturers, a mutual benefit will emerge.
The cement manufacturing companies reduce their demand for traditional raw mate￾rials and save the limited capacity of landfills and other waste-treatment industries.
Waste water-based drilling fluids can be solidified by adding cement mixtures
[233], in particular, those with low-quality blast furnace slags [234–237]. Such
mixtures have already been applied in wells at temperatures from approximately
4-315 ◦C. The disposal of rock cuttings is achieved by [238]:
• combining the cuttings with water and blast furnace slag,
• injecting the slurry into the annulus surrounding a wellbore casing,
• solidifying the cuttings, water, and slag.
Solidification in blast furnace slag cement is inexpensive [238]. The slag is com￾patible with both oil-based and water-based drilling mud. Drilling fluids, therefore,
do not need to be removed from the drilling cuttings prior to solidification in the
wellbore annulus [239].10.4 Classification of cement additives 475

Disposal of oil sludge
The proper disposal of oil sludge is one of the fundamental problems of petroleum
production. Increasingly stringent environmental control regulations, lack of final
disposal sites, and high costs involved in disposal have resulted in limited oil
sludge disposal options. Two options for disposing the oil sludge have been
compared [240]:
• the use of solid-liquid centrifugal separation,
• the use of oil sludge as a cementing material.
If the initial oil concentration in the sludge is high, high-temperature centrifuga￾tion with a biodegradable surfactant is recommended to lower the concentration to
a reasonable value. The resulting solid extract can be mixed with cement to obtain
cement of a quality suitable for masonry.
The major potential uses of wastes in cementing technology are summarized in

11 Transport
Pipelines have a long history. In ancient times, pipelines were used for water
transport. Examples are still visible in archeologic areas. However, it is clear that
these early constructions could not bear large pressures. The advent of gas pipelines
started between 1820 and 1830 with the distribution of town gas. Nowadays,
pipelines are indispensable in petroleum industries for the transport of various
materials, including natural gas, crude oil of various types, and refined products.
The construction and operation of pipelines are described in the literature and
are not a subject of oilfield chemicals [1–4]. Here, the additives and chemicals that
facilitate the transport of fossil fuel products are discussed.
Heavy crude oil which is too viscous to enable it to be pumped from a flowing
phase of a reservoir into and along a pipeline for delivery to a refinery or other
storage facility, may be contacted with a formulation to reduce its viscosity. The for￾mulation may include a hydrogel, that is, an optionally crosslinked polysaccharide,
poly(vinylalcohol), or poly(vinylacetate) [5]. Poly(vinylalcohol) may be crosslinked
with glyoxal.
11.1 TRACERS
The measurement of movement in fluids, such as the detection of leaks or some
other form of fluid movement is of great importance within the maintenance and
surveillance of fluid reservoirs, such as oil and gas reservoirs or in measuring
movement in ground water.
In 1960s, the development of trace substances for industrial purposes has been
described by The Institute for Energy Technology. Since the beginning of 1980s the
studies have been focused on the oil and gas industry. The main object of inter￾well trace element investigations is to map or monitor the stream flux or regions
in the reservoir and to measure qualitatively and quantitatively the flux or stream
connections between the injection and production wells.
The data from the trace compound monitoring in combination with ordinary
production data, pressure measurements and information from well logging provide
the basis for evaluating the pattern for the dynamic fluid streams and thereby the
optimal extraction and processing of the reservoir.

493494 CHAPTER 11 Transport
Due to environmental considerations radioactive trace substances have been
replaced with chemical, mainly organic, trace substances, for example, fluorinated
benzoic acids in trace substance investigations performed by the Institute for Energy
Technology.
Tracer chemicals suitable for the detection of movement have been described
[6]. For example, the detection of poly(naphthalenesulfonate)-type pollutants in
water can be achieved by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry.
In particular, 2,6-naphthalene disulfonate may be used.
A problem with the use of naphthalene suphionic acids as trace substances
is that the wells may be polluted with the same substances. This is because the
concrete that often is used in the wells contains an additive that is a polymerization
product between 2-naphthalene sulfonate and formaldehyde. The additive will also
contain a number of different isomeric compounds of naphthalene sulfonic acids that
slowly leak from the concrete and into the production water. Additives of concrete
containing polymeric 2-naphthalene sulfonate type compounds have been widely
used in many oil and gas wells around the world, and this may contribute to a
background level also of other isomers [6].
However, environmental authorities have indicated that the use of fluorinated
aromatic acids gradually should be phased out and become replaced with more
environmental-friendly trace substances. There is also a continuous demand for new
trace substances to be used in petrol and oil reservoirs and in geothermal reservoirs
as the present tracers are gradually being used in many wells.
Recently, three families of organic tracer compounds have been proposed for
monitoring the movement of water [7]:
1. biphenyl sulfonic acids,
2. fluorene sulfonic acids,
3. p-terphenylsulfonic acids
These tracer compounds can be used for monitoring the movement of water in
different applications, such as for studying their movement in petroleum reservoirs,
in geothermal reservoirs, in surface and subterranean hydrological studies and in
industrial processes. A special example is the movement of aqueous solutions of
1,2-ethanediol, which is used for the drying of natural gas in gas pipes from oil and
gas wells.
Biphenyl sulfonic acids and fluorene sulfonic acids are stable at elevated temper￾atures and may be measured in water down to very low concentrations through the
aid of liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection.
4,4’-Biphenyl sulfonic acid has be detected down to a level of 100 ppt without
any enrichment in the production water from an oil field in the North Sea [7].
11.2 MODELLING OF THE VISCOSITY
Viscosity is an important transport property for engineering design and simulation
of bitumen production and transportation. During the production of bitumen with11.3 Pretreatment of the products 495
solvent injection, steam-assisted gravity drainage, or expanding solvent steam￾assisted gravity drainage, the oil solvent mixture encounters various temperature and
pressure conditions.
Therefore, a model is necessary to predict the viscosity of the mixture of bitumen
and solvent in wide ranges of temperatures, pressures, and compositions.
A semitheoretical viscosity model has been proposed, which is based on the
Arrhenius mixing rule and can describe the effect of association between the
molecules of the solvent and the bitumen [8]. Thermodynamic perturbation theory
has been used to calculate the fraction of bonding solvent molecules.
The viscosity of the solvent in wide temperature and pressure ranges could
be calculated using the modified Enskog theory. The results show an acceptable
agreement between the predictions of this model and experimental viscosity data
of bitumen saturated using different solvents, such as CH4, N2, CO2, and C2H6 [8].
11.3 PRETREATMENT OF THE PRODUCTS
Certain requirements concerning the purity of the product to be transported must
be fulfilled. For natural gas, the water content should be kept below a certain level
to reduce hydrate formation. In addition, oxygen and sulfur must be controlled
effectively. Some additives are presented in Table 11.1.
11.3.1 PRETREATMENT FOR CORROSION PREVENTION
Methods used to control presumptive corrosion include deaeration and dehydration.
Carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide are the main corrosives in pipelines for natural
gas, but they are only aggressive in the presence of water.
Therefore sweetening and drying the gas are useful to prevent corrosion. In oil
pipelines, water emulsified in crude oil can cause corrosion problems [9]. Emulsified
crude oil in produced water is also an environmental and disposal problem.

11.3.2 NATURAL GAS
Natural gas consists mainly of methane although there are trace amounts of higher
hydrocarbons, nitrogen, and even helium. It is typical in the gas transportation and
storage industry to try to strip out higher hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane,
butane, and unsaturated hydrocarbons from natural gas if the gas is to be transmitted
through pipelines.
This leaves mostly methane (with some traces of nitrogen and carbon dioxide)
to be transported by the gas pipeline. The materials that are stripped out are then
transported or stored separately, often as liquids. A typical composition of natural
gas transmitted through pipelines is shown in Table 11.2.
The compressibility factor z of methane is always less than 1.0 in normal
temperature ranges, that is, between −40 and 50 ◦C. Furthermore, the compressibility
factor decreases as the pressure rises or the temperature falls. Therefore, less energy
is needed to pump a given volume of methane (measured at standard volume) at any
given normal temperature than would be expected at that temperature if the methane
would behave like an ideal gas.
This effect is more marked at higher pressures. Similarly, as the pressure is
increased at a constant temperature, more methane (measured at standard volume)
can be stored in a given volume than would be predicted from the ideal gas equation.
Below 7 MPa, the dominant variable for the compressibility factor in the PVT
equation is the molecular weight of the gas. At this pressure level, the addition of
ethane or propane increases the molecular weight of the gas more rapidly than the z
factor decreases. Thus, there is an advantage to removing ethane, propane, etc. from
the gas.
At pressures greater than 7 MPa it is advantageous to add substances such as C2
or C3 hydrocarbon compounds, carbon monoxide, hydrogen fluoride, ammonia, or a
mixture of these with the natural gas. Ammonia without other additives is useful as
an additive for gas storage at pressures down to about 5.5 MPa. Above a lower limit,11.3 Pretreatment of the products 497
which varies with the additive being added and the pressure, this results in a smaller
Mw ×z product, and therefore a decrease in the amount of power needed to compress
the mixture for storage and to keep it compressed.
It is also advantageous to add ammonia to natural gas to be transmitted through
pipelines at pressures above 5.5 MPa. Depending on the cost, it also can be
advantageous to add carbon monoxide. Hydrogen fluoride is also effective, but is
prohibitive because of the toxicity and corrosive properties.
The precise amount of each additive that can be added at any pressure for
beneficial results can be found by calculating the product of the molecular weight
times the z factor of the resulting mixture Mw × z, and comparing it with the product
of the molecular weight times the z factor of the original natural gas. If the product
Mw × z is smaller for the mixture than for the natural gas, energy can be saved in
pumping and compression [11].
The use of two or more additives has a synergistic effect in many cases, so that
even a smaller amount of each is needed than would be if only one were present to
produce the z factor over that of an equivalent standard volume of natural gas at the
pressure and temperature involved.
When the mixture is pumped through a pipeline, however, an additional effect
with ammonia emerges. In a pipeline, there are pumping stations at intervals along the
pipeline. At each pumping station, the gas is compressed. As the gas moves toward
the next pumping station, it gradually loses pressure and expands. The compression
during passage through the compressor station heats the gas.
The gas cools while passing through the pipeline, transferring some of its heat to
the surrounding soil through the pipeline wall. Ammonia has the property of being
a refrigerant, which absorbs heat as it expands. Thus when gas mixture of ammonia
and natural gas is compressed and then is subsequently allowed to flow through a
gas pipeline, the ammonia cools the mixture as it expands. This is regarded as an
additional advantage [10].
11.3.3 SULFUR CONTAMINATION OF REFINED PRODUCTS
If refined products, such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, or kerosene, are transported in
a pipeline, where otherwise sour hydrocarbon fluids are transported, there may be
an undesired enrichment of sulfur in the refined products. This can be avoided if the
oxygen level of the transportant is maintained at below 20 ppm [12].
The dissolved oxygen level in the hydrocarbon product is controlled by reducing
the amount of air injection employed in mercaptan or disulfide reduction or by the
use of oxygen scavengers prior to the introduction of the refined hydrocarbon product
into the pipeline.
11.3.4 PHOSPHORUS FREE GELLING AGENTS
Production fluids that are containing traditionally produced dialkyl phosphoric acid
ester gelling agents have been found to contribute volatile phosphorus during refinery498 CHAPTER 11 Transport
processing [13]. This volatile phosphorus is a problem, since it condenses on the trays
of distillation towers and causes plugging. Plugging can result in undesirable refinery
shutdowns.
Residual trialkyl phosphates, such as triethyl phosphate, have been thought to
be at least one of the sources of the volatility problems in downstream processing
operations that are commonly associated with conventional phosphoric acid ester
gelling agents. Residual trialkyl phosphates are problematic because of their low va￾por pressure, which allows them to vaporize at the temperatures used in downstream
processes, which can lead to fouling.
The most common conventional method of production involves the reaction of
phosphorus pentoxide with trialkyl phosphate and alcohol, which produces dialkyl
orthophosphoric acid ester gelling agents.
Gelling agents for a hydrocarbon fracturing fluid have been described. These are
phosphorodiamidic acid derivatives. The synthesis has been described in detail in
Ref. [13].
11.3.5 DEMULSIFIERS
A gas containing entrained asphaltene containing hydrocarbons is conditioned for
pipeline transportation by injecting a surface active compound that is composed of
a mixture of demulsifying agent, antifoaming agent, dispersant, aromatic solvent,
and alcohol solvent, whereby the formation of emulsion from asphaltene containing
hydrocarbons is prevented [14]. A surface active composition is shown in Table 11.3.
11.3.6 HEAVY CRUDES
The most relevant parameters in pipeline transportation of heavy crude oil are
velocity, viscosity, temperature, density, and pour point [15]. Heavy crude can be
transported on trunk systems in a variety of modes, including segregation, blending,
and batching.
Segregation requires separate pipelines, blending consists of mixing crudes,
and batching refers to shipping crude in discrete batches. There are a number of

methods for enhancing the transportability of heavy crude. These include oil-in-water
emulsion formation, droplet suspension, dilution, the use of drag reducing additives,
and heating.
Emulsions for heavy crudes
Oil-in-water emulsions provide a cost effective alternative to the methods mentioned
previously, namely, heating or diluting. A typical transport emulsion is composed
of 70% crude oil, 30% aqueous phase, and 500-2000 ppm of a stabilizing surfactant
formulation [16].
Non-ionic surfactants are relatively insensitive to the salt content of the aqueous
phase. Ethoxylated alkyl phenols have been used successfully for the formation of
stable emulsions that resist inversion.
Activation of natural surfactants
With chemical treatment, the natural surfactants in crude oil can be activated [17].
This method has been shown to be effective for highly viscous crude oil from the
Orinoco Belt that has been traditionally transported either by heating or diluting.
The precursors to the surfactants are preferably the carboxylic acids that occur in the
crude oil.
The activation occurs by adding an aqueous buffer solution [18,19]. The buffer
additive is either sodium hydroxide in combination with sodium bicarbonate or
sodium silicate. Water-soluble amines also have been found to be suitable [20].
Additional stabilizers for the emulsion can be multivalent inorganic salts, such as
aluminum nitrate [21], in small quantities of 30 ppm.
Low-temperature transportation
In addition to the surfactant, a freezing point depressant can be added for low￾temperature transportation. Possible depressants include salts, sugars, and alcohols
such as glycerol [22].
11.4 CORROSION CONTROL
Coatings, cathodic protection, and chemical additives are used extensively to prevent
internal and external pipeline corrosion. The excessive use of incompatible chemical
additives has caused severe problems in gas-transporting systems.
Costs arising from these problems often exceed the costs of the chemicals
themselves. The careful evaluation and selection of chemical additives can minimize
these problems and reduce operating costs [23].
11.4.1 WELD CORROSION
Preferential weld corrosion (PWC) has long been a problem in the oil and gas
industry for pipelines used in process facilities, seawater injection, produced-water500 CHAPTER 11 Transport
service, offshore platforms, and downhole-production systems. Recent PWC field
failures have been reviewed in the light of mitigation guidelines from recent
literature [24].
Environmental effects take precedence over chemical composition and mi￾crostructure in determining PWC susceptibility. Therefore, the primary approach
to minimize PWC is continuous corrosion inhibition. The ideal PWC-prevention
method would be the use of autogenous welds or welds made with matching
consumables. However, this is not a practical option in the field where most pipelines
are typically made from carbon manganese steels with broad chemical compositions,
thereby making them susceptible to PWC. The feasible alternative is to use filler
materials with strict compositional control concerning the following elements: nickel,
silicon, and chromium. In addition, increased-preheat and high-heat input welding
processes should be employed to minimize the susceptibility to PWC [24].
11.4.2 CRUDE OIL TREATMENT
Some crude oils contain certain organic compounds that are corrosive. In particular,
these include naphthenic acids. Such crude oils cause problems in transportation,
refining, and processing. The naphthenic acid content can be reduced simply with
alcohol treatments, such as methanol, to form the corresponding ester.
Hence, the treatment temperatures will preferably be around 350 ◦C. Pressures
from about 100 to 300 kPa are typical and generally result from the system
itself [25].
11.4.3 CHEMICAL INHIBITION
Inhibitors may be classified according to their solution properties as either oil soluble
inhibitors, water-soluble inhibitors, or dispersible inhibitors. Chemical inhibitors act
as film formers to protect the surface of the pipeline. Corrosion inhibitors, used for
the protection of oil pipelines, are often complex mixtures.
The majority of inhibitors used in oil production systems are nitrogenous
and have been classified into the broad groupings given in Table 11.4. Typical
corrosion inhibitors are shown in Table 11.5 and in Figure 11.1. For details, see also
Chapter 6.

Synergism with drag reducers
Copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid (AA) that are added as drag reducers
also enhance the activity of corrosion inhibitors in brine solutions by decreasing
turbulence so that the corrosion inhibitor can more thoroughly contact the internal
surface of the pipeline. Therefore, the copolymer acts synergistically with corrosion
inhibitors to increase their efficiencies [30].
The effect of a chemical drag reducer on oxygen corrosion of carbon steel has
been investigated in a large-scale flow loop simulating a sea water injection line.
A drag reduction of up to 48% was achieved. In addition, a reduction of corrosion
occurred [31].
11.4.4 COATINGS
Coatings protect the wall material by preventing aggressive substances from coming
in contact with the wall. A coating is actually not an additive, but this section502 CHAPTER 11 Transport

is included for completeness. Poly(ethylene) (PE) coating with special antioxidant
stabilizers has an excellent resistance to thermal oxidation at 80 ◦C.
A poly(propylene) (PP) coating is suitable for external corrosion protection of
steel line pipes at temperatures between −30 and 120 ◦C. Coatings are summarized
in Table 11.6.
Alternative plastic materials
Fiber-reinforced epoxide pipes have many advantages for the petroleum industry.
These pipes offer corrosion resistance, high strength-to-weight ratio, light weight,
desirable electrical properties, dimensional stability, pressure and temperature stabil￾ity in given ranges, and low-maintenance costs.
11.5 CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL
Conventionally, carbon dioxide (CO2) removal requires the use of a water-based
amine solution and large absorber and regeneration towers. The capital and ongoing
operational costs for this process are substantial, and the use, that is, regeneration
and disposal of the amine solution can be problematic from the perspectives of both
safety and the environment [39].
Nitrogen (N2) can also be a problematic impurity in natural gas. Many researchers
have been investigating the use of alternative gas-separation technologies (such as
membranes and adsorption) targeted at removing N2 or CO2 from natural gas more
efficiently [39].
A simple-to-use predictive tool can be applied to accurately predict the CO2 and
N2-adsorption isotherms at low temperatures and pressures up to saturation for a
commercial carbon molecular sieve as a function of temperature and partial pressure
of these components [39]. The accurate prediction of such data is useful in evaluating11.8 Drag reducers 503
the feasibility of using pressure-swing adsorption to separate N2 and CO2 from
natural gases at cryogenic temperatures.
The proposed method showed consistently accurate results across the investigated
wide pressure and temperature ranges, with an average absolute deviation of less
than 1% for both N2 and CO2 compared to the existing Toth equation, which shows
deviations of 3.5 and 1% for N2 and CO2, respectively [39].
11.6 PARAFFIN INHIBITORS
The techniques of paraffin removal and paraffin prevention have been reviewed
[40]. In particular, inhibitors for paraffin deposits are copolymers of ethylene
with vinylacetate [41–44] or polymers from p-nonylphenyl methacrylate and
p-dodecylphenyl methacrylate [45]. These materials lower the pour point of the oil.
It has been shown that for oils which differ in the content of n-paraffins and
asphalt-resinous substances, it is necessary to use blends of copolymers of different
compositions and molecular weights to obtain optimal efficiency.
Poly(acrylamide) and wastes from the production of glycerol with a concentration
of 400 mg l−1 of oil have also been claimed to be effective as paraffin inhibitors [46].
11.7 POUR POINT DEPRESSANTS
Some crude oils are so waxy that their transportation by cold pipelines is very
difficult, especially in winter. This is because of the high pour points of such crudes,
which adversely affect the transportation process.
The crystallization of waxes at lower temperatures causes reduced liquidity of
waxy crude oils, which considerably hampers the transportation of crude oils through
long distance pipelines.
Taking into consideration all of the economic aspects, additive treatment, which
depresses the pour point and improves the flow characteristics of the crude at lower
temperatures, was found to be the most suitable method for transporting waxy crude
oil [47]. Typical pour point depressants are shown in Table 11.7. Alternatively, the
pour point is reduced by modifying the crude oil itself, for example, by cracking [55].
11.8 DRAG REDUCERS
Pipeline flow improvers, or drag reducing agents, have been utilized in the petroleum
industry for many years [56]. The first application of drag reducers in the petroleum
industry was to reduce the downhole pressure loss during the pumping of the fluids
downhole to fracture-tight formations.504 CHAPTER 11 Transport

One of the first large-scale pipeline applications was to increase the throughput
of crude oil on the Trans-Alaskan pipeline in 1979. Because of the reduction of the
apparent viscosity, drag reducers are useful for saving energy required for pumping.
Drag reducers are discussed in more detail in Chapter 12. Some drag reducers are
shown in Table 11.8 and Figure 11.2.
11.8.1 DRAG REDUCTION IN GAS TRANSMISSION LINES
Drag reduction in gas transmission lines can be achieved by applying a thin chemical
coating on the pipe’s inner surface to reduce friction between the flowing gas and
pipe wall.
An important criterion for gas drag reduction is that the additive can bond strongly
onto metal surfaces and form a smooth film to mitigate the turbulence at the gas￾solid interface [70]. Effective gas drag reducers have properties similar to corrosion

inhibitors, lubricants, and surfactants. Fatty acid amines or amides exhibit these
properties.
11.8.2 SYNERGISM WITH PARAFFIN DEPOSITION
In waxy crudes, the wax has a tendency to become deposited during storage of
the crude oil in tanks or while flowing through pipelines. The deposition in the
pipeline severely affects the pipeline throughput. The deposits have to be removed
periodically from the storage tanks and the pipelines by pigging operations.
The wax deposition behaviors of Bombay high crude oil have been studied
under different conditions using a cold disk-type assembly [71]. It was found
that the deposition occurs much less with additive-treated crude than with un￾treated crude under otherwise identical conditions. However, the deposits obtained
from treated crude have slightly higher melting points and less oil content. The
wax separation temperature of crude oils can be determined from their viscosity
behavior [72].
11.9 HYDRATE CONTROL
The usual practice for avoiding the plugging of production facilities by hydrates is to
add thermodynamic inhibitors, such as methanol or glycol. A newer concept is the
injection of low-dosage additives: either kinetic inhibitors, which delay nucleation506 CHAPTER 11 Transport

or prevent the growth of hydrate crystals, or hydrate dispersants, which prevent the
agglomeration of hydrate particles and allow them to be transported within the flow
[73,74].
Hydrate control is discussed extensively in Chapter 13. Classes of hydrate control
agents are shown in Table 11.9, and additives are shown in Table 11.10 and in
Figure 11.3.
11.10 ADDITIVES FOR SLURRY TRANSPORT
Examples of additive uses are the slurry pipeline transport of minerals, the
removal of the solids produced during the drilling of wells, and the removal of
solids formed during the polishing and grinding of metals. Anionic, cationic,
or non-ionic surfactants may be used to alter the viscosity, for example,
cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, dodecyl diphenyl oxide disulfonate, and soya
bis[2-hydroxyethyl]amine [78].
Fatty amines are prepared from the corresponding fats by both conversion into
the nitrile and hydrogenation. Soybean oil contains a mixture of various long chain
acids. The major acids are oleic acid (9-octadecenoic acid) and linoleic acid (9,12-
octadecadienoic acid), that is, C18 single and double unsaturated acids, respectively.
Components for additives for slurry transport are shown in Figure 11.4. Fatty amines

Odorization serves as a warning in the detection of natural gas in air before it reaches
combustible levels. The most important compounds are given in Table 11.11 and
Figure 11.5. The topic is detailed in Chapter 15.
11.12 CLEANING
Even carefully built pipelines have been found to contain up to 10 t of waste
materials, mostly iron rust, sand, mud, and welding rods. Even shoes, gloves, and
bottles have been removed from pipes. Cleaning can generally be achieved by
pumping suitable solvents in pigging operations.

11.12.1 ACIDIC FLUIDS
Acidic fluids are present in a multitude of operations in the oil and gas industry
[80]. For example, acidic fluids are often used in wells penetrating subterranean
formations. Acidic fluids may be used in cleanup operations or stimulation operations
for oil and gas wells.
In addition, acidic fluids are sometimes used in pipelines that are normally used
for the transmission of hydrocarbons. For example, acidic fluids may be used in an
exothermic reaction to generate heat in a pipeline to help remediate paraffin wax
buildup in the pipeline. Paraffin wax deposition is found practically whenever crude
oil is produced and transported. Paraffin wax deposition obstructs the flow of oil,
lowering oil production and interfering with transportation [80].
Acidic fluids can include one or more of a variety of acids, such as hydrochloric
acid, acetic acid, formic acid, hydrofluoric acid, or any combination. In addition,
many fluids used in the oil and gas industry include a water source that may
incidentally contain certain amounts of acid, which may cause the fluid to be at least
slightly acidic [80].
11.12.2 SAND REMOVAL
Traditional sand management programs usually consist of several measures em￾ployed to mitigate the production of sand from wells, a process commonly referred
to as sanding [81].
Such systems include production prediction and monitoring, topside manage￾ment, sand control, and intelligent systems [82]. Sand control can be considered in
terms of short- and long-term solutions; examples of long-term solutions (preven￾tative measures) would be the application of gravel packs, screens, inflow control
devices, and chemical stabilization methods [83].11.12 Cleaning 509
In cases, where a sand-management program has not been employed or has been
ineffectively delivered, sand can and is deposited in pipelines or riser systems. This
can be a gradual process of continual minor deposition over time, or the systems
may be overwhelmed with a sudden influx of sand as a consequence of formation or
completion failure.
The available methodologies for remediation of a pipeline affected by sand have
been discussed and exemplified [81].
11.12.3 GELLED PIGS
Gelled fluid pigs will perform most of the functions of conventional pigs, but they
have additional chemical capabilities. In addition, they can be injected into a pipeline
through a valve. However, for displacement by a gas, gel pigs must be propelled by
a mechanical pig.
Most pipeline gels are water-based, but a variety of chemicals, solvents, and acids
can be gelled. Gelled diesel, an organic gel, was first patented for pipeline use in
1973 [84]. The gels can be used for waste material removal, separation of products,
placement of biocides and inhibitors, and removal of trapped mechanical pigs
[85,86].
Ablating gelatin
An ablating gelatin pig has been described for use in pipelines. Because of the
properties of gelatin, the pig will ablate, thereby depositing a protective layer onto
the wall of the pipe [87]. The pig can be molded outside the pipe or it can be formed
in situ.
The pig is formed by mixing gelatin with a heated liquid and then allowing the
mixture to cool to ambient temperature. Preferably, the liquid contains a corrosion
inhibitor or a drag reducer. In some applications, a slug of the treating solution is also
passed through the pipeline between two ablating gelatin pigs. For high-temperature
applications, a hardener may be added to increase the melting temperature of the pig.
Coacervate gels
Coacervate gels with excellent shear viscosities and other properties are made with
anionic or cationic polymers, a surfactant having a charge opposite that of the poly￾mer, and a hydrophobic alcohol. Optional gel promoting additives include betaines
and amine oxides. A preferred gel comprises poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chlo￾ride), a lesser amount of sodium lauryl sulfonate, and lauryl alcohol. Such gels are
particularly useful in forming plugs and pigs for separating fluids in pipelines [88].
The general purpose of a pig used in a fluid conducting system is to provide a
movable fluid-sealing barrier between the fluids.
The plug or pig may be used to separate portions or segments of fluids, for
example, one segment may be a gas and the other a liquid: one may be a hydrocarbon
and the other an aqueous fluid. In any case, the use of our pigs will facilitate the
movement of such separated or isolated fluids through a pipe.510 CHAPTER 11 Transport

12 Drag reducers
This chapter deals almost exclusively with the state of drag reduction in pipelines
for liquid transportation. Drag-reducing additives are important in oil drilling
applications and the maintenance of pumping equipment in pipelines. Flow drag in
pipes can be reduced by adding a small amount of high molecular polymer. Pipeline
flow improvers, or drag-reducing agents (DRA)s, have been utilized in the petroleum
industry for many years [1].
The first application of drag reducers was the use of guar in oil well fracturing,
presently a routine practice. The quantities of DRA used in this application were very
large. One of the first large-scale pipeline applications was to increase the throughput
of crude oil on the Trans-Alaskan pipeline in 1979 with oil soluble polymers. This
agent was highly successful in applying a drag-reducing phenomenon.
Since then, DRA use has increased in refined products pipelines. This is justified
by an economic factor, namely, to offset power costs. The DRA cost for moving an
additional barrel of product through a pipeline system can be less than $0.05/bbl.
This cost level has been made possible by improved performance in commercially
available DRAs and a nearly unchanging price structure.
In the subsea production of oil and gas, production piping typically presents a
significant bottleneck because of the difficulty and expense associated with the subsea
installation of the piping. The production decrease caused by bottlenecking at subsea
flow lines can have severe economic ramifications due to the resulting inability to run
the hydrocarbon production system at full capacity [2].
Several options that exist for preventing or curing bottlenecking at subsea flow
lines include increasing the diameter of the flow lines, increasing the number of
flow lines, or reducing the amount of friction loss in the flow lines to thereby
allow more flow through the same diameter lines. The first two de-bottlenecking
options of increasing the size or number of flow lines are obviously very expensive.
Thus, it is highly desirable to be able to reduce friction losses in subsea flow
lines [2].
12.1 OPERATING COSTS
Pipeline operators of liquid hydrocarbon products can decrease operating costs
by using a drag-reducing flow improver to eliminate the need for under utilized
intermediate or booster pump stations [3,4]. Product lines operating below their
capacity or that only use boosters intermittently can also realize cost savings.

517518 CHAPTER 12 Drag reducers
The overall benefits are likely to be most significant in six to eight in lines
operating between 67% and 92% of their rated throughput capacity. Using computer
modeling techniques, engineers have demonstrated potential power savings of up to
22% (from lower demand charges and reduced energy use) for systems using booster
stations 85% of the operating time. When stations operate only 70% of the time, total
energy cost savings can approach 35%, depending on the diameter of the line and
electricity costs.
12.2 MECHANISM OF DRAG REDUCERS
A review on drag-reducing polymers is given in the literature [5,6]. It has been sug￾gested that drag reduction occurs by the interactions between elastic macromolecules
and macrostructures in turbulent flow. In turbulent pipe flow, the region near the
wall, composed of a viscous sublayer and a buffer layer, plays a major role in drag
reduction.
The most serious problem in the effectiveness of drag reducers is the chain
degradation of polymers by shear strains in turbulent flow. Ultrahigh-molecular￾weight polymers are more sensitive to shear-induced degradation [7]. Polymers with
linear-chain structures are more vulnerable than branched polymers [8] and natural
gums with semirigid structures [9].
The mechanism of shear degradation is assumed to be associated with chain
elongation. The chain degradation is often observed when the shear rate is increased
to a critical point, after which drag reduction sharply decreases.
The friction drag and heat-transfer reduction phenomena associated with turbu￾lent flows of so-called drag-reducing fluids are not well understood [10]. It is believed
that elastic fluid properties are strongly related to these phenomena. However,
not all drag-reducing fluids are viscoelastic, nor are all viscoelastic fluids drag
reducing, suggesting that drag reduction and viscoelasticity are probably incidentally
accompanying phenomena.
It is argued that turbulence suppression, that is, flow laminarization, is a deter￾mining factor for the reduction phenomena, but not the fluid elasticity, because of the
flow-induced anisotropic fluid structure and the associated properties, whereas the
fluid elasticity may be a major cause for the laminar heat-transfer augmentation.
12.2.1 DAMPING OF TRANSMISSION OF EDDIES
One of the mechanisms of drag reduction is that transmission of eddies can be
damped by the viscoelastic properties of fluids. The transfer process of an isolated
eddy in Maxwell fluids with viscoelastic properties was studied, and the expressions
describing such phenomena were obtained [11]. The results of the study showed
that eddy transmission was damped significantly with an increase of the viscoelastic
properties of the fluids.12.2 Mechanism of drag reducers 519
12.2.2 VISCOELASTIC FLUID THREAD
In the extensive literature on polymer drag reduction, it has occasionally been
reported that a continuous thread of a high-concentration polymer solution injected
into the axis of a pipe produces a drag reduction effect on the water flow in the pipe
[12]. The thread seems to persist through the length of the pipe and little, if any,
diffusion of polymer to the walls of the pipe is apparent.
A polymer of the poly(acrylamide) (PAM) type was injected as a 0.5% solution
from an axially placed nozzle at the bellmouth entrance. The experiments showed that
the central thread provided drag reduction almost equivalent to premixed solutions
of the same total polymer concentration flowing in the pipe. Overall concentrations
of 1-20 ppm were used.
Moreover, the effects were additive: 2 ppm thread overall concentration plus
2 ppm premixed gave drag reductions equivalent to 4 ppm of either type. Reynolds
numbers of up to 300,000 were investigated. In other experiments, a number of
different polymer fluids were injected on the centerline of a water pipe flow facility
[13]. Two distinct flow regions were identified:
• Reynolds numbers above 25,000, at which centerline injection acted as a rather
efficient mixing device for water-soluble polymer and no drag reduction,
resulted from materials insoluble in water.
• Reynolds numbers from 10,000 to 25,000, at which strong evidence exists that
under certain conditions, a viscoelastic fluid thread can interact with turbulence
eddies and reduce the overall flow friction in the pipe.
12.2.3 POLYMER DEGRADATION IN TURBULENT FLOW
Drag reduction in turbulent flow is of great potential benefit to many industrial
processes, including long distance transportation of liquids, oil well operations, and
transportation of suspensions and slurries, but it is complicated by the problem of
polymer degradation. A capillary rheometer was used to investigate the effect of
various parameters on polymer degradation in turbulent flow [14].
These parameters included polymer concentration, contraction ratio, pipe length,
pipe diameter, number of passes, solvent weight, and molecular weight of polymer. A
commercial organic drag reducer, two grades of PAM, and a high-molecular weight
poly(isobutylene) were used.
In turbulent flow, the polymer degraded more in a poor solvent at low Reynolds
numbers, whereas an opposite effect was observed at high Reynolds numbers. The
critical Reynolds number, Rec or critical apparent shear extensional rate, V/d was
found to increase with polymer concentration and molecular weight as represented
by the dimensionless concentration c(η).
Poly(saccharide) guar gum is used as a turbulent drag reducer in aqueous systems.
It reduces the friction drag tremendously under a turbulent flow even in small
amounts. A study on the mechanical degradation of guar gum has been presented.
The effectiveness of drag reduction of the guar gum was measured using a rotating￾disk apparatus as a function of time.520 CHAPTER 12 Drag reducers
Two different degradation models of a single-relaxation process and a stretched￾exponential model were examined. The stretched-exponential model seems to fit the
experimental data better [15].
12.2.4 DRAG REDUCTION IN TWO-PHASE FLOW
The drag-reducing properties of a PAM type were tested in two-phase air/water flow,
using a horizontal pipe of 31 mm diameter [16]. The properties of the polymer were
tested in single-phase water flow, and the results were found to comply with the
reduction in pressure drop found by other workers. Positive effects in two-phase flow
were found to depend on the Reynolds number of the liquid flow.
Thus, the drag reduction in stratified flow was small or negative. In slug flow, the
drag reduction seems to occur in the liquid slug, not in the layer below the bubble.
The flow regime seems to be unaffected by the polymer. It has been established that
in multiphase flow, drag reducers act significantly as corrosion inhibitors because
they smooth the flow profile near the walls [17].
12.2.5 DRAG REDUCTION IN GAS FLOW
For storage or pipeline transportation of natural gas at pressures over 5.5 MPa
(800 psi), it is advantageous to add ammonia to the natural gas. The ammonia should
not create a liquid phase at the temperature and pressure used. Such a gas mixture
of ammonia and natural gas can be compressed or pumped with a lower energy
expenditure than would be needed for an equivalent volume of natural gas alone.
When more than 4% by volume of ammonia is present, pumping through pipelines
is also aided by the refrigerant effect of the ammonia, which reduces the temperature
of the gas being transported [18].
12.2.6 MICROFIBRILS
Friction loss in liquids can be reduced with maximum stability by adding a
predetermined amount of selected organo-polymeric microfibrils to a liquid [19].
These microfibrils are insoluble but highly dispersible in the liquid.
Organo-polymeric microfibril designates a solid, organic polymer in the form of
microfibrils having an average diameter in the range of 100-1000 Å, an average
length in the range of 1-500 μm, and an aspect ratio (length/diameter) of 10-
1,000,000. Polymeric materials to be processed into microfibrils should be insoluble
but highly dispersible in a given liquid.
12.2.7 DRAG-REDUCING SURFACTANT SOLUTIONS
The behavior of two types of drag-reducing surfactant solutions was studied in turbu￾lent flows in pipes of different diameters [20]. The surfactant systems contained rod
like micelles consisting of equimolar mixtures of n-tetradecyltrimethylammonium
bromide, n-hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and sodium salicylate.12.2 Mechanism of drag reducers 521
The structure of the turbulence was studied using a laser-Doppler anemometer in
a 50-mm pipe. In the regimes of turbulent flow, both surfactant solutions exhibited
characteristic flow regimes. In the regimes of turbulent flow at low Reynolds
numbers, velocity profiles similar to those observed for dilute polymer solutions are
found, whereas at maximal drag reduction conditions, more S-shaped profiles that
show deviations from a logarithmic profile occur.
12.2.8 SOAPY INDUSTRIAL CLEANER
Experiments have been conducted to investigate the effect of a soapy industrial
cleaner on reducing the skin friction of a Jordanian crude oil flowing turbulently
in pilot-scale pipes of different sizes. Experiments showed that a concentration of
only 2 ppm of the chemical additive injected into the crude oil line caused an
appreciable amount of drag reduction [21]. The effects of additive concentration and
pipe diameter on drag reduction have been investigated.
12.2.9 LYOPHOBIC PERFORMANCE OF THE LINING MATERIAL
An experimental study was conducted on the characteristics of frictional drag for a
lyophobic surface, with the surface consisting of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE)
and the working media being water and machine oil [16]. The test results indicate
that, depending on the lyophobic performance of the lining material, the pipes lined
with PTFE have a better drag-reducing effect than conventional steel pipes.
A drag reduction of approximately 12% is achieved with the working medium
being water or 6% with machine oil, respectively. In other words, PTFE has a higher
lyophobic performance against water than against machine oil.
The theoretical analysis of the flow mechanism on the lyophobic surface shows
that the lyophobic treatment of the surface can lower the surface energy level to such
a degree that the attraction of the solid wall on liquid molecules becomes weaker than
the liquid molecular absorption. This effect causes a gliding flow adjacent to the pipe
wall, thus reducing the drag.
12.2.10 INTERPOLYMER COMPLEXES
It has been shown that hydrogen bonding-mediated interpolymer complexes can be
powerful drag reducers. The drag reduction levels in such polymer systems increase
dramatically by a factor of two to six when compared with their nonassociating poly￾meric precursors. Their shear stability is also shown to be significantly enhanced [22].
Hydrocarbon soluble polymers containing small percentages of polar associating
groups are used to determine the effects of polymer associations on solution
drag reduction. Experimental data suggest that intrapolymer associations generally
decrease the dilute solution drag reduction activities of single associating polymers
with like polar groups [23].522 CHAPTER 12 Drag reducers
Interpolymer complexes formed by one polymer with anionic groups and one
polymer with cationic groups can overcome this limitation and provide an enhanced
dilute solution drag reduction activity as a result of favorable interpolymer asso￾ciations, which build larger structures of higher apparent molecular weight. The
latter associations may also increase the resistance of the polymers to degradation
in turbulent flows.
12.2.11 OPTIMAL MIXING
The preparation of large-scale homogeneous solutions of drag-reducing polymers
requires an appropriate mixing procedure to ensure full disentanglement of the
polymer chains without chain scission due to overmixing [24].
The latter is known as mechanical degradation and reduces the performance
of drag-reducing polymers. The dominant large-scale mixing parameters including
time, impeller type, impeller speed, and impeller-to-tank diameter ratio were investi￾gated to obtain a recipe for maximum mixing with minimum polymer degradation.
Three water-based solutions of 100 ppm Superfloc A-110 (flexible structure),
Magnafloc 5250 (flexible structure), and Xanthan Gum (rigid structure) were as￾sessed [24]. Superfloc A-110 is a poly(acrylamide) copolymer. Magnafloc 5250 is a
high molecular weight anionic poly(acrylamide) flocculant. The performance of the
mixing parameters for each polymer was evaluated based on the solution viscosity
in comparison with the highest viscosity, that is, optimum mixing, obtained by 2 h of
low-shear mixing of a small-scale polymer solution using a magnetic stirrer.
The results of these studies demonstrate that optimum large-scale mixing can be
obtained at mean and maximum shear rates of ∼17 and ∼930 s−1, respectively, after
2-2.5 h of mixing for each of the polymers. This shear rate is obtained here using a
three-blade marine impeller operating at 75 rpm and at an impeller-to-tank diameter
ratio of 0.5. The resulting polymer solution showed the highest viscosity, which is
an indication of minimal degradation while achieving complete mixing. It is also
confirmed that chemical degradation due to contact with a stainless steel impeller is
negligible [24].
12.2.12 SLICKWATER FRACTURING
Slickwater fracturing has used fresh water as a base fluid and a friction reducer
as a main additive to reduce the friction pressures in the wellbore and within the
fractures [25]. This technology is becoming challenging because of the limited
sources of fresh water, the increased flowback fluid disposal costs, and stricter
disposal regulations. Therefore, the oil and gas industry has tried to optimize the
reuse of slickwater fracturing flowback fluids to help to reduce the use of fresh water.
The flowback contains mainly water, salts from formation water, and chemicals that
were introduced from the hydraulic fracturing.
The effects of salinity on the performance of friction reducers have been
investigated for the purpose of reusing the flowback materials [25]. Three commercial12.3 Drag reducer chemicals 523
friction reducers were tested: an anionic friction reducer (FR-A), another anionic
friction reducer (FR-B), and a cationic friction reducer (FR-C).
The concentration of the friction reducers varied from 0.5 to 1.2 l m−3 of water.
Sodium chloride and calcium chloride at different concentrations were added to
the solution to study the salinity effects. In addition, multiple rheological tests
were executed to understand the effects of salinity on the rheological properties of
slickwater [25].
The results of the study revealed that the anionic FR-B performed better than
the anionic FR-A in fresh water. The percent friction reduction of FR-B and FR￾A at 0.478 g l−1 in fresh water were about 60% and 40%, respectively. Further, the
performance of FR-B was less sensitive to salts than that of FR-A. Therefore, it is
recommended to add 0.478 g l−1 of FR-B directly into the flowback, which has the
total dissolved solid values of 100 g l−1 or less without the need of pretreatment to
achieve the percent friction reduction of 40% or higher. Cationic FR-C performed
the best when compared with anionic FR-A and FR-B at high salinity, for example,
200 g l−1 total dissolved solid [25].
12.3 DRAG REDUCER CHEMICALS
12.3.1 ULTRA-HIGH-MOLECULAR WEIGHT POLY(ETHYLENE)
The flow of liquid hydrocarbons can be enhanced by introducing into the stream
a nonagglomerating suspension of ultra high molecular weight poly(ethylene)
(UHMWPE) [26,27] in water with small amounts of surfactant. The finely divided
UHMWPE is prepared by polymerization and then cryogrinded below the glass
transition temperature.
12.3.2 COPOLYMERS OF α-OLEFINS
Several copolymers of α-olefins are used as drag reducers. Suggested recipes are
summarized in Table 12.1. Monomers are shown in Figure 12.1.
Linear low density poly(ethylene) is a copolymer of ethylene and α-olefins.
It is obtained by copolymerization utilizing Ziegler-Natta catalysts or metallocene
catalysts. Concentrates may be prepared by precipitating the polymer from a
kerosene solution with isopropanol [49]. The resulting slurry concentrate dissolves
rapidly in flowing hydrocarbon streams.
By coating poly-α-olefins with a fatty acid wax as a partitioning agent and
dispersing it in a long chain alcohol, a nonagglomerating, nonaqueous suspension
can be obtained [50].
12.3.3 LATEX DRAG REDUCERS
Latex drag reducers comprise a polymer that is formed via an emulsion poly￾merization reaction dispersed in a continuous phase and can undergo subsequent
modification in order to increase the solubility of the polymer in hydrocarbons.524 CHAPTER 12 Drag reducers

Vinyl monomers.
The monomer is preferably 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate. The polymerization is
done by conventional emulsion polymerization techniques. Details of the preparation
procedure can be found elsewhere [2]. The emulsion polymerization reaction yields
an initial latex composition, which is a stable colloidal dispersion.
The dispersed phase is made up of colloidal particles of the high molecular weight
polymer, with totally ca. 50%. The continuous phase is water and surfactant. The
latex can be modified or formulated with additional surfactant and organic solvents.
In this way, the viscosity may be increased. The drag reducer may be injected into
the pipeline using conventional or umbilical delivery systems.12.3 Drag reducer chemicals 525
12.3.4 POLY(ETHER) COMPOUNDS FOR OIL-BASED
WELL DRILLING FLUIDS
A liquid oil, an emulsifier, and a friction modifier, which includes certain poly(ether)
compounds, can be added to a drilling fluid consisting of a water-in-oil emulsion
formed from a brine [51]. The friction modifier serves to decrease the coefficient of
friction of the well drilling fluid.
Decreasing the coefficient of friction lowers the force required to turn the drill
bit in the hole. Gravitational forces increase the coefficient of friction in deviated,
horizontal, and extended-reach wells.
12.3.5 TYLOSE
Tylose is not as effective in drag reduction as other substances described in
the literature. Detailed mean velocity, normal Reynolds stress, and pressure drop
measurements were performed with 0.4-0.6% aqueous solutions of tylose, a methyl￾hydroxyl cellulose (molecular weight 6 kDa), after a selection process from a set of
low-molecular weight fluids [20].
The measurements of the viscosity of the tylose solutions show shear thinning
behavior, and the oscillatory and creep tests measured elastic components of the
stress in the order of the minimal detectable values by the rheometer. These low￾molecular weight polymer solutions delay the transition from the laminar to the
turbulent regime and show drag reductions of half that reportedly occur with other
low-elasticity, shear thinning, high molecular, aqueous polymer solutions.
12.3.6 MICROENCAPSULATED POLYMERS
Highly concentrated DRAs may be prepared by microencapsulating a polymer or
a monomer. The microencapsulation may be performed before, during, or after the
polymerization of a monomer into an effective drag-reducing polymer. If the encap￾sulation is done before or during polymerization, a catalyst must be present, but little
or no solvent is required. The result is a bulk polymerization within the microcapsule.
The inert capsule or shell may be removed before, during, or after the introduction
of the microencapsulated drag reducer into a flowing liquid. No injection probes or
other special equipment should be required to introduce the drag-reducing slurry into
the liquid stream, nor is grinding (cryogenic or otherwise) of the polymer necessary
to form a suitable DRA [52,53].
12.3.7 ALUMINUM CARBOXYLATE
Aluminum carboxylate-based DRAs are nonpolymeric DRAs. These drag-reducing
additives are not subject to shear degradation and do not cause undesirable
changes in the emulsion or fluid quality of the fluid being treated, or undesirable
foaming.
The compositions consist of an aluminum carboxylate itself and fatty acids. The
aluminum carboxylates are selected from aluminum salts of fatty acids, including526 CHAPTER 12 Drag reducers
octoates, stearates, oleates, or naphthenates [54]. The fatty acids are selected from
long chain carboxylic acids. Aluminum salts of a combination of short and long
chain carboxylic acids may provide an optimum balance between drag reduction and
change in viscosity.

13 Gas hydrate control
In petroleum technology, gas hydrates are undesired compounds that may be formed,
for example, during production of transportation of natural gas. On the other hand,
large accumulations of gas hydrates in nature are known. These resources are now
considered as potential nonconventional energy sources.
Although, when gas hydrates were first described by Davy in 1810 [1], based
on chlorine, the actual engagement in hydrocarbon-based gas hydrates started more
than 100 years later. The history and issues of gas hydrates have been reviewed in
the literature [2]. Important milestones in the field of gas hydrates are summarized in
Table 13.1.
There are several monographs and review articles on natural gas hydrates. Both
the physical and the physicochemical aspects are dealt with [3,11], as well as the
geological aspects [12,13].
13.1 MONOGRAPH: GAS HYDRATE INHIBITORS
In addition, a monograph about chemical additives for gas hydrates has been
published [14]. This book offers a straightforward, informative guide to the chemicals
used for gas hydrate formation and inhibition, providing the reader with the
latest information on the definition, structure, formation conditions, problems, and
applications of gas hydrates.
Formerly, additives were only used to inhibit the formation of solid hydrates in
pipelines and maintain a safe and economic fuel transportation. Recently, their role
has reversed in newly found applications, where the formation of gas hydrates is
beneficial, such as gas storage and carbon sequestration [15].
A comprehensive review on the role of conventional and novel additives used to
promote or inhibit the hydrate formation in different chemical processes has been
presented [15].
These additives are classified based on their action mechanism, such as ther￾modynamic and kinetic. Attempts were made to provide a complete outlook of the
chronological development of these aspects [15].
Gas hydrates are crystalline inclusion compounds of gas molecules in water
which form under certain temperature and pressure conditions, that is, low tem￾perature and high pressure. The water molecules form cage structures around the

appropriate gas molecules. The lattice structure formed from the water molecules
is thermodynamically unstable and is always stabilized by the incorporation of gas
molecules. Depending on pressure and gas composition, these ice like compounds
can exist even to above the freezing point of water, up to 25 ◦C.
In the crude oil and natural gas industry, great significance attaches in particular
to the gas hydrates which form from water and the natural gas constituents methane,
ethane, propane, isobutane, n-butane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide.
Especially in modern natural gas extraction, the existence of these gas hydrates con￾stitutes a great problem, especially when wet gas or multiphasic mixtures of water,
gas, and alkane mixtures are subjected to low temperatures under high pressure.
As a consequence of their insolubility and crystalline structure, the formation of
gas hydrates leads here to the blockage of a wide variety of extraction equipment
such as pipelines, valves, or production equipment in which wet gas or multiphasic
mixtures are transported over long distances, as occurs especially in colder regions
of the earth or on the seabed [16].
In addition, gas hydrate formation can also lead to problems in the course of the
drilling operation to develop new gas or crude oil deposits at the appropriate pressure
and temperature conditions by the formation of gas hydrates in the drilling fluids.
In order to prevent such problems, gas hydrate formation in gas pipelines, in the
course of transport of multiphasic mixtures or in drilling fluids, can be suppressed
by using relatively large amounts of lower alcohols such as methanol, glycol, or
diethylene glycol.
The addition of these additives has the effect that the thermodynamic limit of
gas hydrate formation is shifted to lower temperatures and higher pressures (ther￾modynamic inhibition). However, the addition of these thermodynamic inhibitors
causes serious safety problems (flash point and toxicity of the alcohols), logistical13.2 Naturally occurring gas hydrates 533
problems (large storage tanks, recycling of these solvents), and accordingly high
costs, especially in offshore extraction.
Attempts are therefore being made to replace thermodynamic inhibitors by adding
additives in amounts of <2% in temperature and pressure ranges in which gas
hydrates can form. These additives either delay the gas hydrate formation (kinetic
inhibitors) or keep the gas hydrate agglomerates small and therefore pumpable, so
that they can be transported through the pipeline. The inhibitors used either prevent
nucleation and the growth of the gas hydrate particles, or they modify the hydrate
growth in such a way that relatively small hydrate particles result.
Gas hydrate inhibitors beyond to thermodynamic inhibitors are a multitude of
monomeric and also polymeric substance classes, which are kinetic inhibitors or
agglomeration inhibitors. Of particular significance in this context is that the poly￾mers have a carbon backbone which contain both cyclic (pyrrolidone or caprolactam
moieties) and acyclic amide structures in the side groups [16].
A method for inhibiting gas hydrate agglomeration in a fluid that contains
a hydrocarbon and water has been described. The method consists of adding to
the fluid an effective amount of a gas hydrate-inhibiting composition, that is, an
antiagglomerant agent and a fluorine-containing agent [17].
The fluorine-containing agent can be a perfluoropolyether, a perfluroalkylether,
a perfluoropolyalkylether, a partially fluorinated betaine, a partially fluorinated
amine oxide, a partially fluorinated non-ionic surfactant, a perfluroalkane, a partially
fluorinated polybutylene, or a tetraalkylammonium fluoride. Preferably, the effective
amount of the fluorine-containing agent ranges from 0.5% to 1.5% [17].
13.2 NATURALLY OCCURRING GAS HYDRATES
Besides of hydrates formed in devices for use in petroleum technology, the vast
majority of gas hydrates are occurring naturally. Namely, the largest accumulations
on earth of natural gas are in the form of gas hydrate. The hydrates are found mainly
offshore in the outer continental margin sediment and further in the polar regions.
The hydrocarbon gas composition and the isotopic pattern indicates that the
methane/water clathrate originates mainly from the microbial reduction of CO2 in
sedimentary organic matter. Only in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Caspian Sea,
mainly a thermogenic formed methane has been detected [18].
Large gas hydrate accumulations have been located in the terrestrial permafrost
regions. These resources are considered as potential nonconventional energy sources
in our planet. In the permafrost regions, gas hydrates may exist at subsurface depths
ranging from about 130-2000 m [19]. The estimates of the amount of gas in the wor￾ld’s marine and permafrost gas hydrate accumulations are differing by several orders
of magnitude. Some authors estimate them in the range of some 1015 m3 [19,20], still
others in the range of 10 tera tons [13,21]. There is a definite interest concerning the
commercial use of gas hydrates, even when admittedly the matter is assessed with
care [22].534 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
13.3 PROBLEMS WITH GAS HYDRATES IN PETROLEUM
TECHNOLOGY
The main problem of hydrate formation will arise in pipelines transporting natural
gas, because gas hydrates are solids and will leave deposits. The solid deposits reduce
the effective diameter of the pipeline and can therefore restrict or even clog the flow
properties.
Experience indicates that large gas hydrate plugs in gas and oil pipelines form
most actively during the period of an unforeseen long shutdown. In static conditions,
three types of hydrate crystals can be formed [23]:
1. Surface-contact films and massive hydrates, which form by sorption of gas and
water molecules on the surfaces of growing crystals.
2. Bulk diffusional whisker like hydrate, which forms both in the volume of gas
and in the bulk of liquid water through sorption of molecules on the growing
crystal surface and by tunnel sorption of molecules at the base of the crystal.
3. Gel like soft crystals, which form in the bulk of liquid water at a deficiency of
dissolved gas in water.
Under the appropriate pressure and temperature conditions for hydrate formation,
there may be a simultaneous formation of some crystals and a decomposition of other
crystals.
Gas hydrate crystals, when allowed to form and grow inside a conduit such as
a pipeline, tend to block or even damage the conduit. In order to prevent such a
blocking, basically the following precautions can be done [24]:
• removal of free water;
• maintaining elevated temperatures or reduced pressures; and
• addition of melting point depressants.
Furthermore, the formation of condensates, hydrates, or ice may occur in the
course of decompression of natural gas stored in natural reservoirs, for example, in
salt caverns. The operation of oil and gas pipelines in the deep sea is significantly
complicated by the formation of gas hydrates [25].
Antifreeze agents, such as low molecular alcohols and glycols, must be added in
substantial amounts to be effective, typically in the order of more than 10% [24]. Of
course, a serious disadvantage of such amounts is the prize of the additive required.
In addition, the recovery is complicated and expensive.
An attractive alternative to antifreeze agents is the use of crystal growth inhibitors
[24]. Crystal growth inhibitors are interfering the kinetics of the mode of the growth
of gas hydrate crystals. These issues will be discussed in detail below.
13.4 NATURE OF INCLUSION COMPOUNDS
Clathrates are crystalline addition compounds of at least two species of molecules.
They are bound mainly by van der Waals forces. One compound, the host, makes up13.4 Nature of inclusion compounds 535

Structure of clathrates.
the structure. The other partner, the guest, is placed in free spaces of the crystal lattice.
If the free space is closed in every direction, then these compounds are considered
clathrates in the closer sense. The structure of clathrates is illustrated in Figure 13.1.
Other types of inclusion compounds are channel inclusion compounds and layer
inclusion compounds.There are monographs on this topic [11,26,27].
The size of the free space varies slightly as a result of the size and the shape
of the molecule to be included. This fact is used in the separation of molecules.
A relevant example in petroleum refinement is the separation of paraffins from other
compounds with urea. In this case, a channel like lattice is formed by urea. In the
free space linear alkanes, for example, n-octane can be embedded, whereas branched
alkanes, for example, i-octane cannot be included.
An example for a host molecule with a layer-like structure is graphite. Various
types of both organic and inorganic inclusion compounds, as well as stoichiometric
and nonstoichiometric compounds, are known.
13.4.1 GAS HYDRATES
Gas hydrates are a special form of clathrates. Here, water is the host molecule.
Hydrates have been classified by the arrangement of the water molecules in the
crystal, that is, after their the crystal structure [11]. There are three types of gas
hydrates, type I, type II, and type H. H refers to heavy.
Inspection of Table 13.2 shows that the number of water molecules required
to form the hydrate increases with the size of the guest molecule to be captured.
Hydrates are classified into simple and mixed hydrates depending on whether one
or more host or guest molecules compose the compound. They also exhibit different
structures.
Besides the main classes, several subclasses of gas hydrates have been identified.
The crystallographic structures can be established by X-ray diffraction, whereas
the microstructures can be assessed by cryo-stage field-emission scanning electron
microscopy [28]. Early research of the structure of gas hydrates date back to von
Stackelberg [29].536 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

Nitrogen N2 · 6H2O
Carbon dioxide CO2 · 6H2O
Hydrogen sulfide H2S · 6H2O
Type I hydrates
The simplest type of hydrates is type I. The crystallographic unit cell in this type
contains 46 water molecules. There are two types of cages, a small cages and a large
cages.
The small cage has the form of a pentagonal dodecahedron, that is, a polyhedron
with 12 faces of regular pentagons. The particular structures of gas hydrated can be
found in the literature [11, p. 19].
The large cage form has a tetradecahedron structure, a polyhedron of totally 14
faces, with 12 faces of regular pentagons and 2 faces of regular hexagons.
In type I hydrates, the guest molecules CO2 and CH4 can enter both the small
and the large cages, whereas larger molecules, for example, ethane may fill only
the large cages. The cages may not filled in a regular way, therefore, hydrates are
nonstoichiometric compounds.
Type II hydrates
Type II gas hydrates have larger crystallographic unit cells than type I hydrates. The
crystallographic unit cell in this type contains 136 water molecules.
The small cage is built as a pentagonal dodecahedron, like type I hydrates. In
contrast, the large cage consists of a hexakaidodecahedron. This polyhedron has
totally 16 faces, with 12 faces of regular pentagons and 4 faces of regular hexagons.
Guest molecules for type II hydrates are O2 and N2. As in type I hydrates, small
molecules can fill both the small and the large cages, whereas larger guest molecules
can fill only the large cages.
Type H hydrates
In 1987, a new type of hydrates was discovered. Higher molecular compounds, such
as benzene, cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane,
isopentane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane, may form gas hydrates of type H. Recent studies
show that in certain circumstances, the effect of the heavy hydrate formers cannot be
ignored and, in some cases, they significantly reduce the hydrate-free zone [30].13.5 Conditions for formation 537

Hydrate guests.
Structure H formation requires the presence of two different types of guest
molecules: a smaller component, such as methane or hydrogen sulfide, and a large
molecule, such as i-pentane or heavier hydrocarbons, which may occur naturally in
petroleum. No aromatic molecules have been found to be possible guests for this
hydrate structure [31]. Structure H-hydrates are somewhat more stable than methane
hydrates at higher temperatures.
A variety of systems have been investigated with respect to stability-covering sys￾tems of methane-2-methylbutane-water, methane-2,2-dimethylbutane-water,
methane-tert-butyl methyl ether-water, and methane-adamantane-water [32,33].
A substantial inhibiting effect is observed in the presence of the NaCl. Adamantane
and related products in the formation of gas hydrates are shown in Figure 13.2.
Thermodynamic data suggest the possibility of forming structure H-hydrates in
gas and oil reservoirs and industrial installations. Hydrates formed with methane and
adamantane have been found in situ in Mobile Bay in the Gulf of Mexico [34].
Therefore, structure H-hydrates are now recognized as a potential problem in the
petroleum industry. The stable occurrence of structure H-hydrates calls into question
existing hydrate prediction programs and suggests that the hydrate phase itself should
be measured, in contrast to previous experimental practices [35].
13.5 CONDITIONS FOR FORMATION
13.5.1 WATER CONTENT
The water content of a natural gas is a crucial parameter for the formation of gas
hydrates, at least in transporting systems. Clearly, a water-free gas may not be able
to form gas hydrates. Natural gas contains water in the range of 8000-10,000 ppm
by volume. Specifications for pipelining restrict the water content to 120-160 ppm.
The reasons for this limitation are not only the risk of hydrate formation, but also
potential corrosion problems. Therefore, drying of a wet gas is essential.
The water content is measured most conveniently via the dew point, but electrical
and optical methods are also available. The dew point is connected most directly to
hydrate formation, because it is believed that condensate formation is essential before
the formation of hydrates.538 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
13.5.2 DECOMPOSITION
Clathrates and, in particular, gas hydrates can be decomposed very easily by
dissolving or melting the crystal lattice of the host molecule.
13.5.3 STABILITY DIAGRAM
Hydrates are stable below a certain temperature and above a certain pressure. A p-T
stability diagram is shown in Figure 13.3.
For gases with contents of compounds with higher molecular weight, the curve is
shifted significantly to lower pressures. For gas mixtures without hydrogen sulfide
as a first approximation, the gas density may serve as parameter to estimate the
conditions of stability of hydrates. Similar p-T diagrams, such as that from methane,
are given with the relative density of the gas as parameter in tables and figures in the
literature.
13.5.4 CLAUSIUS-CLAPEYRON EQUATION
In some regions, the equilibrium pressure of coexistence of gas hydrate with the
corresponding gaseous state follows a Clausius-Clapeyron relation,

In Figure 13.4, the same data as plotted in Figure 13.3 are recalculated into the
logarithm of the pressure and the reciprocal of the absolute temperature and plotted.
At elevated temperatures, the relationship changes into
ln p = A + BT + CT2. (13.2)
The parameters A, B, and C are dependent on the particular nature of the gas.
Katz developed a simple method for gas mixtures that takes the composition of the
gas into account [36,37]. Furthermore, a graphic method is available that permits the
estimation of the hydrate forming temperatures at pressures for natural gas containing
up to 50% hydrogen sulfide [38].
13.5.5 HAMMERSCHMIDT EQUATION
Methanol has been identified as a hydrate inhibitor already by Hammerschmidt
[7,39]. Actually, methanol is a simple and cost-effective method for controlling
hydrate formation.
The Hammerschmidt equation was the first calculus of predicting the freezing
point depression but is not directly related to the colligative properties,

Here, T is the freezing point depression in ◦C, I is the amount of inhibitor
added in weight percent, and M is the molecular weight of the inhibitor in g mol−1.
For example, for methanol added in an amount of 25%, the freezing point depression
will be calculated to 13.5 ◦C.
Equation 13.3 relies on more than 100 experimental determinations of the
freezing point depression [3, p. 203]. The Hammerschmidt equation proved to be not
very accurate. In addition, the equation does not take into account the dependence of
the gas pressure on the freezing point depression.
For this reason, various suggestions of modification of the original equation and
other methods for the prediction of the freezing point depression, respectively, have
been appeared [40] that are dealt with elsewhere [3, p. 203].
On the other hand, attempts to give a theoretical foundation of the Hammer￾schmidt equation have been undertaken [40,41]. Under certain assumptions, for
example, if the inhibitor is not soluble, the Hammerschmidt equation, if slightly mod￾ified, can be traced back to well-known expressions obtained from thermodynamics.
Other methods are for calculating the necessary amount of inhibitor, preferably
methanol, include the K-chart method, and the CSMGem method [3,42,43]. The
CSMGem is a software, developed by the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) for the
prediction of hydrate equilibria [44,45].
13.6 FORMATION AND PROPERTIES OF GAS HYDRATES
Knowledge concerning the mechanism of hydrates formation is important in design￾ing inhibitor systems for hydrates. The process of formation is believed to occur in
two steps. The first step is a nucleation step and the second step is a growth reaction of
the nucleus. Experimental results of nucleation are difficult to reproduce. Therefore,
it is assumed that stochastic models would be useful in the mechanism of formation.
Hydrate nucleation is an intrinsically stochastic process that involves the formation
and growth of gas-water clusters to critical-sized, stable hydrate nuclei. The hydrate
growth process involves the growth of stable hydrate nuclei as solid hydrates [38].
13.6.1 TWO-STEP MECHANISM OF FORMATION
Surfactants like sodium dodecyl sulfate reduce the surface tension at the liquid-gas
interface considerably. In fact, the addition of surfactants in small quantities has a
substantial effect on the kinetic characteristics of hydrate formation without changing
the equilibrium parameters. Concentrations of surfactant that increase the induction
period of hydrate formation of propane hydrates also increase the rate of subsequent
growth of the hydrate phase [46]. The effect of stirring on the kinetics of formation
of hydrate formation does not seem to be pronounced [47].
This is in contrast to other results in which it was found that the induction time
is strongly dependent on the stirring rate and the driving force [48]. Experiments
conducted at the same stirring rate and with a high driving force seem to show that13.6 Formation and properties of gas hydrates 541
the induction time varies exponentially with the size of the driving force. Surface
effects are reported on the nucleation. For example, diatomaceous earth and synthetic
amorphous silica were found to nucleate hydrate formation [49].
13.6.2 NUCLEATION PARTICLE SIZES
Nucleation and growth of gas hydrate crystals have been investigated with optical
methods under different pressures and temperatures. The particle sizes measured
during gas hydrate nucleation ranged from 2 to 80 nm [50,51]. The nucleation
process is nondeterministic, because of a probabilistic element within the nucleation
mechanism [52].
13.6.3 CLUSTERING BEFORE NUCLEATION
A controversy exists regarding the early stages of formation of gas hydrates. The
mechanism proposed by Sloan and Fleyfel for the kinetics of hydrate formation is
composed of [53–55]:
1. the formation of clusters of hydrogen-bonded water molecules around different
sizes of apolar molecules and
2. the joining of these clusters to create a hydrate nucleus.
The hypothesis was extended to nucleation of hydrates from liquid water. An
alternative hypothesis was proposed by Rodger et al. [56]. The main difference
between these two sets of theories is that Rodger’s hypothesis relates the initial
formation process to the surface of the water, whereas the theory of Sloan and
coworkers considers clusters related to soluted hydrate formers in liquid water as
the primary start for joining, agglomeration, and crystal growth. The theories of
Sloan and coworkers have been discussed and related to elements of the hypothesis
proposed by Kvamme [57].
13.6.4 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
One of the major goals is to find additives that can inhibit crystallization. This goal is
not restricted to gas hydrates, but applies to all scales that could be formed. Inhibitors
of crystallization may be generally effective for a variety of mineral scales or, in some
cases, may be selected for a narrower range of scales.
Such generality and specificity of action may be understood in terms of stereospe￾cific and nonspecific mechanisms of scale inhibition. New techniques for comparing
the effectiveness and activity of new hydrate inhibitors and laboratory results on
various chemicals have been described.
Modern experimental methods are used to obtain information about interac￾tions between potential crystallization inhibitors and the substrates themselves. By
combining atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and optical
microscopy, both stereospecific and nonspecific interactions of inhibitors with542 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
various crystal species (e.g., calcite, calcium oxalate monohydrate, and ice) have
been examined. The crystals were chosen as representatives of strong ionic, hydrated
ionic, and hydrogen-bonded lattices.
Both stereospecific and nonspecific interactions were observed in each case [58].
The strongest interactions of the adsorbate with the crystal surfaces were elucidated
at the angstrom level with good agreement between experiment and theory. Such a
definition of the weaker interactions requires more work, and in fact may be beyond
the realm of the current methodology. However, reasonable models of each of the
interactions have been proposed in that research.
13.6.5 MODELING THE FORMATION OF GAS HYDRATES
Several program packages are available to predict conditions with respect to pressure,
temperature, and some special inhibitors. The models are based on thermodynamic
considerations rather than on kinetic arguments. Therefore, kinetic inhibitors cannot
be treated with these programs. On the basis of purely thermodynamic correlations,
an algorithm has been developed to predict the formation of hydrates in systems con￾taining oil or gas in equilibrium with water [59]. For a specified temperature and feed
composition, the program computes the equilibrium pressure at the hydrate point.
The authors report that the predictions are satisfactory for gas-water hydrate
forming mixtures, but not for an oil-water system. A practical model for the
effect of alcohol and salinity on gas hydrate formation has been implemented as a
stand-alone computer program that either accesses the model via a spreadsheet or
uses the model as an object code. A critical comparison of the various available
packages has been given in the literature [60]. Four methods of hydrate prediction
were critically evaluated, namely, GPA/CSM, EQUI-PHASE, GPA/AQUA*SIM, and
API/HYDRATE.
13.6.6 OPTIMIZING THE DOSE RATE
A novel technique has been developed for optimizing the hydrate inhibitor dose rates
by monitoring the actual hydrate safety margin. The technique is based on measuring
acoustic velocity and electrical conductivity in an aqueous sample taken from the
pipeline/separator [61].
A system has been developed that determines the salt and organic inhibitor
concentration. In the case of thermodynamic inhibitors, the information is then fed
to a thermodynamic model determining the hydrate stability zone. Superimposing
the pipeline operating conditions, for example, pressure and temperature profile, the
system can determine the hydrate safety margin. The system can provide warning if
the operating conditions are inside the hydrate stability zone or if too much inhibitor
is being injected [61].13.7 Test procedures for inhibitors 543
13.7 TEST PROCEDURES FOR INHIBITORS
In the literature, several test procedures have been described in order to estimate the
performance of newly synthesized additives for the inhibition of gas hydrates.
The procedures can be roughly subdivided in procedure that are simulating
real flow conditions and such are for a screening of the performance according to
simplified test conditions. Unfortunately, these procedures are not really comparable.
Thus the results of a series of a specific test procedure can be compared safely.
13.7.1 SCREENING METHOD
Screening experiments have been shown to be much more simpler than the simulation
of field flow conditions [24]. In the screening procedure, a mixture of tetrahydrofuran
and water is used to simulate a wet gas.
Namely, aqueous tetrahydrofuran is able to form hydrate crystals in the same
range of temperature as a wet gas; however, the formation takes place at atmospheric
pressure. For example, a hydrate melting point of 4.3 ◦C at atmospheric pressure is
observed in tetrahydrofuran containing 19% water.
The effect of various additives on the growth of a single hydrate crystal has been
studied as follows. To a mixture of 18.9% tetrahydrofuran in water with 3% of NaCl
0.5% of the additive to be tested is added.
The solution is kept in a glass vessel, at atmospheric pressure and immersed in a
thermostat at the freezing point of water. When the system is in thermal equilibrium,
a small subcooled ice crystal of ca. 0.1 g is introduced into the solution. After 3 h,
the weight of the crystals is measured and their morphology is inspected.
13.7.2 HIGH PRESSURE SAPPHIRE CELL
The performance of the hydrate inhibitor polymers can be estimated with a high
pressure sapphire cell [62,63].
The sapphire cell is mounted in a thermostat at subambient temperature. It
consists of a sapphire tube enclosed in a holder between two stainless steel end
pieces. Inside the cell is a magnetic stirrer. The stirrer speed is detected by using
a stroboscope.
The cell contains two temperature sensors for the measurement of the temperature
both in the gas phase and in the water bath. The pressure is measured with a pressure
transducer through the inlet tubing connection in the top end piece of the cell.
The tests are performed with synthetic sea water and synthetic natural gas. The
additive to be tested is dissolved in the synthetic sea water. The system is pressurized
with synthetic gas. The gas consumption as a result of hydrate formation is measured,
as well as the torque necessary to keep the stirring speed. Because during hydrate
formation no further gas is delivered, the experiments are not conducted under
isobaric conditions.544 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

Crystallization temperature
Phase equilibria, kinetics, and morphology studies of gas hydrates require separate
pieces of equipment and experimentation times in the order of days [64].
In a recent study, a reactor was designed that allows for tight control of the
crystallization temperature [64]. Coupled with a novel method, this reactor can screen
the crystal morphology, phase equilibria, and apparent kinetics of gas hydrates.
In comparison to traditional multitrial methods, the main advantage of this
method is that only a single experiment, completed in the order of hours, is required
to assess [64]:
1. the change in hydrate growth velocity with respect to temperature;
2. the hydrate-liquid-vapor (HLV) equilibrium temperature at the experimental
pressure; and
3. the change in crystal morphology with respect to driving force.
Using this three-in-one method, the methane hydrate growth and dissociation
were studied in the presence of four commercial inhibitors. Phase equilibria, kinetics,
and morphology were obtained for all hydrate systems with inhibitors [64].
The basic compositions of the commercial inhibitors are listed in Table 13.3.
The standard uncertainty for the hydrate-liquid-vapor equilibrium temperature
was 0.05 ◦K and for a pressure of 0.005 MPa. The apparent rates of growth were
measured for all systems, standard uncertainty was 0.008 mm s−1, and the difference
between the inhibited systems and the pure system was very clear.13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 545
Crystal habits varied considerably among inhibitors and radically with respect to
the uninhibited system. Thus, an innovative technology has been reported to assess
the morphology, kinetics, and thermodynamics of hydrate forming systems with a
single apparatus. Furthermore, with little time investment, small sample sizes can be
used to obtain replicates with minimum temperature and pressure uncertainties [64].
13.7.3 CIRCULATING LOOP
For the simulation of field flow conditions a rather complicated experimental setup is
required. A stainless steel pipe loop and a gear pump coupled with a mixing tank for
the additive under investigation is used for circulating a mixture of water and liquid
hydrocarbons through the loop.
The pipe loop is divided into several sections, each being equipped with a
thermometer and a differential pressure meter. The pressure meter allows to monitor
the pressure drop over each individual section, which is indicative for the formation
of gas hydrates.
The formation of hydrate is triggered by cooling a certain section of the loop
down to −15 ◦C. This cold spot is switched-off immediately when the first hydrates
are monitored. A standard test procedure is used, including programmed cooling,
stopping the circulation temporarily, etc. The test procedure is given in detail in the
literature [65].
13.8 HYDRATE REFORMATION IN METHANE HYDRATE
BEARING SEDIMENTS
The production characteristics of hot-brine stimulation accompanying hydrate refor￾mation in the presence of methane hydrate have been analyzed [66]. Many attempts
have been made to recover methane hydrate commercially, such as [66]:
• depressurization;
• thermal stimulation; and
• inhibitor injection.
Hot-brine injection coupled with thermal recovery with inhibitor injection has
been investigated as an efficient production scheme, but the hydrate reformation
during the dissociation is problematic, and it negatively influences the recovery
rate [66].
13.9 INHIBITION OF GAS HYDRATE FORMATION
Both thermodynamic and kinetic factors affect the inhibition of hydrate deposits.546 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
13.9.1 DRYING
Hydrate formation can be prevented by drying a gas to such an extent that no
condensate can be formed. This method is the preferable one, but inhibition of
hydrate formation from the liquid phase can be achieved.
13.9.2 THERMODYNAMIC INHIBITION WITH ADDITIVES
The hydrate formation temperature can be reduced by the addition of antifreeze
agents such as methanol, glycols [67], or brines, as stressed already. The depression
of the freezing point is given by a generalized Hammerschmidt equation
 T = K
I
100 − I
, (13.4)
where K is a specific parameter dependent on the nature of the additive and I is the
amount of antifreeze in percent with respect to water. Note that in the case of volatile
additives, the additive added will be only partially present in the water phase, and to
some extent in the gas phase.
Brines have inherent corrosive properties and therefore are not suitable. Ethylene
glycol is preferred because of its low cost and low solubility in hydrocarbons. The
cryoscopic depression of some substances is shown in Table 13.4.
Some combination of alcohols and carboxylic acid salts may provide a synergistic
effect with respect to cryoscopic depression [68].
Traditional thermodynamic inhibitors such as glycols and inorganic salts suffer
from high dosing, environmental unfriendliness, corrosiveness, and economical
burden [69]. The development and use of kinetic hydrate inhibitors, mostly polymeric
compounds, with their inhibiting effects on hydrate nucleation and growth are
considered an effective and economically viable chemical treatment for hydrate
prevention. However, the actual performance of a kinetic hydrate inhibitor candidate
is dependent on various factors including its chemical structure, molecular weight,

spatial configuration, effective concentration, pressure and temperature, evaluation
methods, use of other additives, etc.
A systematic overview has been given, concerning the fundamentals of natural
gas hydrates, the prevailing categories of polymeric kinetic hydrate inhibitors with
proposed inhibition mechanisms, and the various synergists studied for boosting the
kinetic hydrate inhibitor performance [69].
Further research endeavors are needed to unveil the kinetic hydrate inhibitor
working modes under different conditions. The conjunctive use of kinetic hydrate
inhibitors and synergists may facilitate the commercial application of effective
kinetic hydrate inhibitors to tackle the hydrate plugging problem in oil and gas flow
assurance practices [69].
13.9.3 KINETIC INHIBITION
As mentioned previously, the classic additive to prevent hydrate formation is alcohol.
Traditional hydrate inhibitors such as methanol and glycols have been in use for
many years, but demand for cheaper methods of inhibition is great. Therefore, the
development of alternative, cost-effective, and environmentally acceptable hydrate
inhibitors is a technologic challenge for the oil and gas production industry [70].
Kinetic inhibitors of gas hydrate formation in oil and gas production processes
have been reviewed [71]. In addition, a general description of the mechanism of the
action of an inhibitor was given.
Gas hydrates are inclusion compounds in which small molecules of gas, for
example, methane, ethane, or carbon dioxide, are located inside the framework of
hydrogen-bonded water molecules. The formation of gas hydrates can be controlled
by changing the physical conditions as well as by chemical methods.
Gas hydrate formation inhibitors are subdivided into thermodynamic inhibitors,
kinetic inhibitors, and antiagglomerants [71].
A thermodynamic inhibitor is a substance that, due to intermolecular interactions,
binds water, preventing it from forming a framework around the gas molecule, thus
shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium of the system toward free water and gas.
A kinetic inhibitor is a substance that decreases the rate of formation of gas
hydrates, thus making it possible for oil to leave the zone of high pressures and low
temperatures without hindrance.
Antiagglomerants do not prevent the formation of gas hydrates, but make it more
difficult for them to agglomerate into larger crystals that cause a partial or a complete
plugging of a pipeline. Thus, the resulting gas hydrate crystals remain in a finely
dispersed state.
The most common kinetic inhibitors are poly (vinylpyrrolidone) and poly (vinyl￾caprolactam) and derivatives. The mechanism of action of these kinetic inhibitors is
as follows [71]:
1. Due to amide fragments, the polymer is adsorbed on the surface of the
framework of hydrogen-bonding water molecules, and groups branching from548 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
the polymer backbone (pyrrolidone or caprolactam) create steric hindrance to
gas molecules preventing them from occupying the cavity inside the crystal.
2. Adsorption of a single link of the polymer chain promotes stronger adsorption of
the neighboring chain links. The closer the side chains of the inhibitor molecule
are to each other, the slower the growth of the gas hydrate crystal.
Patent literature
A wide variety of monomeric and polymeric substances have been identified in patent
literature as useful as kinetic inhibitors. Examples include poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
[72], copolymers of alkoxylated monomers [73], polyvinyl alcohol or partially
hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate [74], and polyols esterified with fatty acids or alkenyl
succinic anhydrides [75]. Polymers made by esterifying pendent hydroxyl groups on
the backbone of a polyester polyol and its use of a kinetic hydride inhibitor have been
described [76].
Some of these inhibitors have certain drawbacks, such as a lack of biodegrad￾ability, and/or the presence of an upper solubility limit in temperature (cloud point).
PNIPAM-based kinetic hydrate inhibitors
Modified kinetic hydrate inhibitors based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) were
synthesized by postsynthetic modification of the acrylic group of an existing poly(N￾isopropylacrylamide) copolymer [77].
In detail, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) was modified with cy￾clopropylamine, cyclobutylamine, cyclopentylamine, cycloheptylamine, cycloocty￾lamine, propylamine, butylamine, tert-butylamine, pentylamine, heptylamine, and
octylamine.
Unlike other synthetic routes, this method generates accurately controlled li￾braries of kinetic hydrate inhibitors with similar molecular weight, molecular weight
distribution, end groups, and composition. This allows the accurate interpretation of
the effect of each of these components and highlights key functional groups that can
improve performance [77]. This was assessed using a high throughput kinetic hydrate
inhibitor ranking method based on its inhibition performance of Structure II forming
cyclopentane hydrate under atmospheric pressure.
Hydrate inhibition tests showed that performance of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-
based kinetic hydrate inhibitors can be improved by careful inclusion of selected
groups. In addition, cloud point data demonstrated that polymers with higher
deposition points could be generated using this method. The presence of side
products has a pronounced effect on the cloud point but only a minimal effect on
hydrate inhibition performance. These data provide valuable insights into polymers
that can improve the performance of kinetic hydrate inhibitors. The method can also
be applied to a number of structural motifs to develop chemicals to overcome issues
associated with natural gas transport [77].
As the oil and gas industry produces hydrocarbons from deeper waters and colder
regions, the issue of hydrate formation becomes more serious [78]. As a result,13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 549
hydrate inhibition has focused on kinetic hydrate inhibitors and antiagglomerants
as an alternative to the existing approaches which involves injecting vast quantities
of thermodynamic inhibitors.
The effect of different architectures (linear and branched) of poly(N￾isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) polymers was evaluated [78]. These polymers
were synthesized with reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT)
polymerization. Unlike nonreversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP)
synthetic routes, this generates accurately controlled kinetic hydrate inhibitor
candidates with target molecular weight, narrow molecular weight distributions,
and controlled architecture, so that the effect on hydrate inhibition can be assessed
more accurately.
The RAFT-based polymers (linear and branched) were compared to a commer￾cially available linear PNIPAM synthesized via non-RDRP radical polymerization
and control groups (pure water, poly(vinylpyrrolidone), and Luvicap) [78].
The hydrate experiments were performed in a high-pressure autoclave with
continuous cooling under different cooling rates (0.25, 0.033, and 0.017 K min−1).
In addition, a cold restart was simulated using constant subcooling [78].
The results regarding subcooling temperature, onset time, and hydrate frac￾tion with resistance-to-flow were compared to known kinetic hydrate inhibitors.
These revealed that a linear PNIPAM-MacroRAFT polymer delayed the hydrate
nucleation with similar performance to known kinetic hydrate inhibitors (e.g.,
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and Luvicap). However, a branched polymer showed the best
performance in terms of hydrate fraction and resistance-to-flow among all of the
systems tested in the study [78].
Therefore, these data provide valuable information regarding linear and branched
PNIPAM-MacroRAFT polymers not only by demonstrating their ability to delay
hydrate formation but also in preventing hydrate agglomeration. These findings
confirm that polymer architecture can effect hydrate inhibition [78].
Nanoparticle kinetic gas hydrate inhibitors
A kinetic gas hydrate inhibitor based on crosslinked poly(vinylpyrrolidone) in the
form of nanoparticles with an average particle size less than about 1000 nm has been
described [79].
13.9.4 NUCLEATION INHIBITORS
The formation of crystals can be subdivided into two stages, the formation of
precursors, that is, nuclei and the growth of these nuclei as they convert into crystals.
Nucleation inhibitors act on the precursor stage.
Magnetic nanoparticles
A mixed emulsifier system was investigated that is composed of Fe3O4 nanoparticles
and Span 20 (sorbitan monolaurate) for the development of hydrate inhibitors that
can be recycled [80]. Sorbitan monolaurate is shown in Figure 13.5.550 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

FIGURE 13.5
Sorbitan monolaurate.
Hydrophobic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared by adsorption of Span 20 on the
particle surface. This was confirmed through UV-absorbance and elemental analysis.
Water-in-oil Pickering emulsion droplets with Span 20-adsorbed Fe3O4 nanoparticles
were analyzed using a confocal microscope and observed through SEM and EDS
mapping of solidified emulsion samples [80].
Due to the physical hindrance of the Span 20-adsorbed Fe3O4 nanoparticles, they
can act as both kinetic hydrate inhibitors and antiagglomerants. The induction time
is significantly increased by hindering the nucleation, and the torque is lowered by
the antiadhesive behaviors of the hydrophobic particles.
The additional injection of the nanoparticles induces the formation of a capillary
water bridge, which increases the contact area and hydrate former supersaturation,
and reduces the dispersion of the emulsion droplet. Therefore, there would be an
optimal concentration of Span 20-adsorbed Fe3O4 nanoparticles which maximizes
the inhibition performance [80].
A boot drum separator with a magnetic field shows excellent recovery perfor￾mance for the magnetic hydrate inhibitors with the injection of acetone into the boot
separator to break the Pickering emulsions. Overall, the Span 20-adsorbed Fe3O4
nanoparticles provide dual roles as kinetic hydrate inhibitors and antiagglomerants,
providing a new approach for the recovery of hydrate inhibitors with superparamag￾netic properties [80].
Monomers for kinetic hydrate inhibitors
As kinetic hydrate inhibitors, homopolymers or copolymers of a lot of monomers can
be used [81]. Suitable monomers are shown in Table 13.5.
Guar gum and Arabic gum
Two edible additives, based on gums, have been investigated with respect to the
induction time and amounts consumed during methane hydrate formation [82].
It has been reported that gum solutions such as guar gum and Arabic gum, which
are used as food thickening agents, increase the viscosity of water. In addition, it has
been found that these compounds exhibit a kinetic inhibition effect on the formation
of methane hydrate.13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 551

To investigate this effect, experiments have been performed in an isochoric bath
high-pressure reactor with a temperature of 4 ◦C (277.15 ◦K), the initial pressure of
55 bar, and different low concentrations of the inhibitors [82].
The comparison between the two types of gums showed that guar gum is more
effective than Arabic gum. It has also been observed that the inhibition efficiency is
increased in the presence of special concentration lower than 0.05%. In a solution
with a higher concentration than the optimum, different behaviors can be observed
which were attributed to the physicochemical properties of guar.
Although hydrate formation may be unavoidable, even if suitable inhibitors are
utilized, guar gum could be a promising candidate as a novel green inhibitor to avoid
a pipeline blockage [82].
13.9.5 DUAL FUNCTION GAS HYDRATE INHIBITORS
Recent advances in gas hydrate research focus mainly on dual function gas hydrate
inhibitors [83]. These inhibitors exhibit dual behavior of shifting the hydrate
dissociation curve to lower temperatures and higher pressures as well as hindering
or delaying nucleation.
In a review, the possible factors were discussed that can induce dual functionality
in gas hydrate inhibitors [83]. This review has summarized the latest developments,
classification, evaluation techniques and experimental findings of gas hydrate in￾hibitor.
The experimental data of different research groups were critically analyzed and
systematically evaluated in terms of average depression temperature and relative
inhibition power. These were calculated from existing experimental data.552 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
The studies in this field will provide more knowledge at both an academic and an
industrial level for the development of economical, efficient, and biodegradable dual
function gas hydrate inhibitors [83].
Natural proteins
One of the first ideas explored for kinetic hydrate inhibitors for oil industry
applications came from observing that some animals contain antifreeze proteins that
protect them from fatal ice crystal formation at subzero temperatures [84]. However,
antifreeze proteins, or ice-structuring proteins, are designed to prevent ice formation,
not hydrate formation. Therefore, although several antifreeze proteins are known
to show some kinetic hydrate inhibitor activity, it is possible that other proteins or
peptides may be even more effective as kinetic hydrate inhibitors.
A range of readily available natural protein-based products from animal and plant
sources were tested as green kinetic hydrate inhibitors, as well as an antifreeze protein
that is used to make ice cream smoother [84]. The experiments on nearly all of
these products were conducted in a high-pressure titanium autoclave and also in steel
rocking cells on a Structure II-forming gas mixture.
The antifreeze protein gave the best performance, although this is at least in part
due to some thermodynamic inhibition from salts and other chemicals present in
the sample. Some of the protein-based products (peptones and tryptones) were more
effective as kinetic hydrate inhibitors than poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone).
The performance ranking was correlated to the molecular weight range and the
ratio of amino acid monomer units [84].
In addition, it was attempted to tailor-make short water-soluble peptide kinetic
hydrate inhibitors with exact structures and only two or three amino acid residues
based on our knowledge that polymer side chains with small alkyl groups give good
kinetic hydrate inhibitor performance. The promising results suggest that bespoke
polypeptide kinetic hydrate inhibitors may be a route to higher-performing kinetic
hydrate inhibitors than those discovered so far [84].
The expression of antifreeze proteins on Escherichia coli using the cell surface
display strategy was investigated to determine the feasibility of the method as a
potential application of kinetic hydrate inhibitors [85].
Monomers to hexamers of type II and III antifreeze proteins were displayed on
the surfaces of bacterial cells. The kinetic inhibition performance of the antifreeze
proteins on the synthetic natural gas hydrate formation was tested [85]. The displayed
antifreeze proteins exhibited higher kinetic hydrate inhibitor effectiveness with the
increase in the number of peptides attached to the cells.
In addition, the best kinetic hydrate inhibitor performance of the antifreeze pro￾teins could be achieved with higher dosages of the cultures when the concentration
of the inducer is optimized, regardless of antifreeze protein type. Only a small
portion of antifreeze proteins in the cell cultures exhibited a considerable kinetic
hydrate inhibitor performance, which implies that the cell surface display could be
an effective strategy, thus reducing the cost of production and purification of the
antifreeze proteins [85].13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 553
A natural material (i.e., whey protein) was assessed to act as a kinetic hydrate
inhibitor in a sapphire cell and an autoclave equipped with particle video microscope
and focused beam reflectance measurement probes [86]. The pressure dropping
method was utilized to estimate the hydrate induction time. The results of this study
demonstrated that the hydrate inhibition performance of whey protein is superior to
that of the commercial kinetic hydrate inhibitor, poly(vinylpyrrolidone).
The induction time for the pure water system was found to increase linearly with
the increase in the dosage of whey protein until it reached approximately 2.5%. As
it is usually inevasible to apply kinetic hydrate inhibitors under conditions of high
water contents, the feasibility of whey protein as a kinetic hydrate inhibitor in the
(oil + water) system with and without an emulsifier of Tween 20 was evaluated [86].
A small amount of oil was found to have no obvious influence on the induction
time for the system with whey protein under the circumstances without the addition
of emulsifier. When Tween 20 was added, the induction time obviously increased un￾der the same operating conditions, which could be attributed to the emulsifier-protein
interactions in aqueous solutions. The oil drops decrease and are distributed more
evenly with the increasing dosage of Tween 20 under the particle video microscope
and focused beam reflectance measurement probes measurement. Additionally, the
particles decrease during the hydrate formation process. This work presents a natural
kinetic hydrate inhibitor and gives the inhibition discipline in a high-water-content
system [86].
Poly(ethylene oxide)
Poly(ethylene oxide), dissolved in water, can be introduced in a petroleum fluid
by either using mechanical equipment or utilizing it in treating fluid. Experimental
date indicate that these positively charged polymers interfere with the nucleation of
hydrates, increase the induction time of gas hydrate nucleation, suppress the memory
effect, and act as antifreeze agent, thereby controlling the formation of hydrates [87].
13.9.6 LOW-DOSAGE GAS HYDRATE INHIBITORS
The historical advancements in low-dosage hydrate inhibitors over the past 20 years
have been summarized. In addition, their advantages and limitations, and their
selection criteria, have been discussed [88].
Historically, hydrate risk has been managed by keeping fluids warm, removing
water, or injecting thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors, commonly methanol or mo￾noethylene glycol.
Thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors require high dosage rates. Therefore, that
technique can pose limitations to production systems in the form of supply, storage,
and umbilical-injection constraints. Additionally, high dosages of methanol can
cause crude contamination for downstream refineries. Low-dosage hydrate inhibitors
continue to offer significant efficiency and cost benefits over other techniques.
Thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors have long been used by the industry because
of their ability to shift the hydrate-equilibrium curve toward higher pressures554 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
and lower temperatures by changing the activity of water molecules. Methanol
and monoethylene glycol have proved the most popular types of thermodynamic
hydrate inhibitor because of their low cost and widespread availability. Though
thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors are low-cost, the volume requirement per barrel
offsets the cost benefit. A group of chemicals developed later, low-dosage hydrate
inhibitors, differ from thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors because they do not shift
the hydrate curve; rather, they interfere with the process of hydrate formation through
different mechanisms. The dosage requirement of these inhibitors is much lower than
that required for thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors [88].
Low-dosage hydrate inhibitors include two categories: kinetic hydrate inhibitors
and antiagglomerants. Kinetic hydrate inhibitors increase the induction time for
hydrate formation by interfering with the nucleation process or the crystal-growth
process. Special surfactants disperse hydrate particles as they form, reducing the
tendency of hydrates to stick to the pipe’s inner surface, reducing the chance of plug
formation. Antiagglomerants modify the agglomeration of hydrate particles, decreas￾ing hydrate-crystal size by affecting hydrate morphology. This leads to a hydrate
slurry flow, which decreases the chance of pipeline blockage. Inhibition mechanisms
of both kinetic hydrate inhibitors and antiagglomerants were discussed in detail, as
was the historical development of these low-dosage hydrate inhibitors [88].
The primary parameters for low-dosage hydrate inhibitor performance measure￾ment include the following [88]:
Hold time This is defined as the time between when a rapidly cooled fluid is at
a constant temperature below the hydrate-equilibrium temperature and when
hydrates first appear. For kinetic hydrate inhibitors, the hold time decreases
steeply with the increase in subcooling.
Dosage rates To establish actual dosage rates for a low-dosage hydrate inhibitor in
a specific fluid, technical-feasibility testing would be required with the actual
low-dosage hydrate inhibitor and fluid under actual pressure and temperature
conditions.
Gas system For a gas system operating with condensed water, the dosage-rate
guideline is 5 gal low-dosage hydrate inhibitor/bbl of condensed water. Break￾through of formation water with a saline content of at least 3% would
reduce the rate to between 0.5 and 1.0 gal low-dosage hydrate inhibitor/bbl of
formation water, although it should be recognized that this would be a different
low-dosage hydrate inhibitor from the one used with condensed water.
13.9.7 CRYSTAL GROWTH INHIBITORS
Certain alkylated ammonium, phosphonium, or sulfonium compounds are effective,
in relatively low concentrations, in interfering with the growth of gas hydrate crystals
[89] and therefore are useful in inhibiting plugging by gas hydrates in conduits13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 555
containing low boiling hydrocarbons and water. For example, tetrabutylammonium
bromide will be active. Gas hydrate or ice formation is further inhibited in lines by
adding amino acids or amino alcohols [90].
The crystallization kinetics in the presence of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and tyrosine
have been tested by time-resolved experiments [91]. An influence is evident on the
particle-size distribution of the hydrate [92].
Certain alkylated ammonium or phosphonium compounds are very effective as
crystal growth inhibitors in comparatively low concentrations [24]. These compounds
can therefore be very useful in inhibiting the plugging by gas hydrates of conduits
containing low boiling hydrocarbons and water. Most desirably, the additives are
biodegradable. Compounds containing an ester linkage are preferred, as the ester
linkage imparts biodegradability to some extent.
Several alkylated ammonium or phosphonium compounds have been tested with
respect to their ability of crystal growth inhibition. In Table 13.6, selected results
from a large series of experiments reproduced using the screening method.
Inspection of Table 13.6 reveals that the additives resulting in crystals having a
weight of less than 3.0 g and exhibit a crumbled sheet (CS) or a rounded edges (RE)
appearance are particularly effective.
Vinyl polymers
Vinyl monomers for the use as gas hydrate inhibitors are summarized in Table 13.7.
Copolymers made from N-vinylcaprolactam and 5-15% diethylamino ethyl acry￾late or diethylamino ethyl methacrylate prolong the induction time of the formation
of gas hydrates considerably [94].
The polymers are synthesized by radical copolymerization using di-tert-butyl
peroxide as initiator. The copolymer is dissolved in 2-butoxyethanol. For testing,
a synthetic gas mixture is used. The composition is given in Table 13.8.
Vinyl lactam-based copolymers
A series of vinyl lactam-based polymers were synthesized and evaluated as kinetic
hydrate inhibitors in a methane-tetrahydrofuran-water system [95].
The inhibition performance of the synthesized kinetic hydrate inhibitors was
examined and compared with commercially available kinetic hydrate inhibitors using
a high-pressure rocking cell.
A N-vinylcaprolactam/N-vinyl pyrrolidone copolymer with a molar ratio of 3:1
could reduce hydrate growth rate by 18% greater than poly(N-vinylcaprolactam).
Moreover, the modification of this copolymer with 3-mercaptopropionic acid
led to producing the novel kinetic hydrate inhibitor that more effectively decreased
hydrate growth rate than the nonmodified copolymer. Moreover, the addition of 2-
dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate as a third monomer to the polymerization mixture
improved the performance of the copolymers by 20%. These monomers are shown
in Figure 13.6.
Cloud point measurements revealed that all the synthesized copolymers, the
modified copolymers, and the terpolymers had higher cloud points in comparison556 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

is shown in Figure 13.7.
The polymerization conditions were optimized to provide water-soluble block
copolymers by first polymerizing more activated monomers, such as styrene and
pentafluorostyrene, to form a defined macro chain-transfer agent (linear degree of
polymerization with conversion, comparatively low dispersity) followed by chain
extensions with less activated monomers vinyl acetate or vinylpyrrolidone by
switching to the deprotonated form of the reversible addition-fragmentation transfer
agent [96]. The critical micelle concentrations of these amphiphilic block copolymers
(after vinyl acetate unit hydrolysis to vinyl alcohol units) were measured using zeta
surface potential measurements to estimate physical behavior once mixed with the
hydrates.
A poly(styrene)-poly(vinyl alcohol) block copolymer improved inhibition to
49% compared to the pure methane-water system with no kinetic gas hydrate
inhibitors. This inhibition was further reduced by 27% by substituting the PS
with a more hydrophobic poly(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorostyrene). A block copolymer
of poly(styrene)-poly(vinylpyrrolidone) exhibited a 20% greater inhibition than the
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) homopolymer, and substituting poly(styrene) with a more
hydrophobic poly(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorostyrene) resulted in a 35% further decrease
in methane kinetic gas hydrate inhibitor [96].
Hyperbranched polyester polyols
Hyperbranched polymers are a class of polymers that extend radially in space with
one potential branch point per repeating unit instead of forming long chains, like
traditional linear polymers [97]. The high degree of branching renders the structure
compact and gives rise to a multitude of functional end groups which are available to
chemical modification.
It has been found that by modifying biodegradable and nontoxic hyperbranched
polyester polyols by replacing one or more of the hydroxyl groups to obtain an
amphiphilic structure, these modified polymers are suitable for use as gas hydrate
inhibitors.
An example of a hyperbranched polyester polyol is poly(2,2-bismethylolpropanoic
acid). This monomer is commercially available under the trade name Boltorn H20
from Perstorp AB. The polymer is readily degradable and degrades into nontoxic13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 559

low molecular compounds [98]. In addition, 2,2-bismethylolbutanoic acid has been
suggested as a monomer.
The synthesis of such hyperbranched polyester can be carried out as follows [97]:
Preparation 13–1: 1.0 g Hyperbranched polyester (Boltorn H20) was grinded and
dispersed in 10 g tetrahydrofuran. 0.10 g 4-(Dimethylamino)pyridine was dissolved in
the mixture. 0.5 g Pivalic anhydride was added drop wise and the mixture was left under
stirring at room temperature over night. After 20 h the solvent was evaporated from the
mixture, a clear solution, and the crude product was obtained as a viscous liquid.
This product obtained a subcooling of up to 8 ◦C before hydrate formation occurred.
Movement of stirrer was observed down to 10 ◦C in condensate/brine/gas system.
Some of the compounds are shown in Figure 13.8.
The synthesis of several other hyperbranched polyester polyols has been detailed.
Some systems inhibited hydrate formation throughout the duration of a gas hydrate
inhibiting test, while other systems lowered the subcooling within a temperature
range of 4-13.5 ◦C.
2-Vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone polymers
A series of polymers of 2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone of varying molecular weights
modified with small organic amines have been synthesized [99]. 2-Vinyl-4,4-
dimethylazlactone is shown in Figure 13.9.560 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

FIGURE 13.9
2-Vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone.
The performance of these polymers as kinetic hydrate inhibitors has been inves￾tigated in high-pressure steel rocking cells using a Structure II-forming synthetic
hydrocarbon gas mixture. It was found that the poly(2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone)
polymer with the lowest molecular weight of Mn = 1845 g mole−1 performed best.
In addition, it was found that the n-propylamine derivative performed the best of
the amine derivatives. The cloud point of this polymer derivative was found to be
lower than ambient temperature, which is considered too low for practical oilfield
applications.
However, high cloud point poly(2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone) derivatives such
as the ethylamine or pyrrolidine derivatives still gave reasonable kinetic hydrate in￾hibitor performance. The kinetic hydrate inhibitor performance of the n-propylamine
derivative of poly(2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone)-I was tested at different concentra￾tions in the range of 1000-7000 ppm. It was found that performance improved when
the polymer concentration was increased [99].
In another study, a series of polyglyoxylamides were synthesized and investi￾gated for their performance as kinetic hydrate inhibitors in slow constant cooling
high-pressure rocking cell experiments [100]. It was found that the performance
improved as the size of the alkyl pendant group was increased. The best-performing
material, poly(pyrrolidinyl glyoxylamide), showed an onset temperature of 8.2 ◦C at
2500 ppm.
N-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)methacrylamide polymers
The formation of gas hydrates is a major problem in flowlines where gas and water
are transported together, and can lead to blockages, downtime, economic losses, and
potential accidents [101]. One way of preventing gas hydrates from forming is by
injection of kinetic hydrate inhibitors. These inhibitors are typically water-soluble
polymers, often containing amide pendant groups.
Polymers made from the monomers N,N-dimethylhydrazidoacrylamide and N,N￾dimethylhydrazidomethacrylamide were synthesized as a series of N-(pyrrolidin￾1-yl)methacrylamide polymers, which contain a pyrrolidine-substituted hydrazido
pendant group [101]. N-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)methacrylamide and acryl hydrazide are
shown in Figure 13.10.
These polymers showed an improvement on all the previous synthesized hy￾drazido polymers as they exhibit improved kinetic hydrate inhibitor performance
while having no cloud point in deionized water or 7% aqueous NaCl up to 95 ◦C.13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 561

Monomers for hydrazides.
Their performance as kinetic hydrate inhibitors has been investigated using a high￾pressure gas hydrate rocker rig at a pressure of 76 bar using a Structure II forming
natural gas mixture and slow temperature ramping experiments [101].
The best-performing polymer, poly(N-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)methacrylamide)-II, was
kept in the reaction mixture of aqueous isopropyl alcohol and gave an average onset
temperature of To = 8.1 ◦C at 2500 ppm. It was thus shown that isopropyl alcohol
functions as a synergist with poly(N-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)methacrylamide), reducing the
To of poly(N-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)methacrylamide)-IV from 10.0 to 9.0 ◦C when added
at 7875 ppm. A common synergist for different kinetic hydrate inhibitors, n-butyl
glycol ether, was found not to significantly improve the performance of poly(N-
(pyrrolidin-1-yl)methacrylamide) [101].
An interesting feature of the hydrazidoacrylamide polymers is that they can
be protonated and therefore their solubility characteristics can change with pH.
Poly(N-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)methacrylamide) was shown to perform better at neutral
and high pHs, and less well at low pH. The effect of pH was observed to be
smaller than previously reported for N,N-dimethylhydrazidoacrylamide and N,N￾dimethylhydrazidomethacrylamide polymers, suggesting that the hydrophilicity ob￾tained by protonation of the hydrazido group affects the polymer less when the
hydrazido moiety contains bigger hydrophobic groups. Finally, given the fact that
kinetic hydrate inhibitor polymer performance is dependent on the molecular weight
distribution, this paper also highlights that Mn and Mw values determined by size
exclusion chromatography using calibration standards can give very different results
compared to absolute methods, such as multiangle light scattering [101].
N-alkyl methacrylamide polymers
Homopolymers and copolymers of N-alkyl methacrylamides with varying alkyl
pendant groups have been synthesized and investigated for their performance as
kinetic hydrate inhibitors in slow constant cooling experiments in rocking cells using
a Structure II-forming synthetic gas mixture at an initial pressure of 76 bar [102].
Attempts were made to polymerize disubstituted N,N-dialkyl methacrylamides.
However, these were found not to homopolymerize using radical initiators [102].562 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
For monosubstituted N-alkyl methacrylamides, the kinetic hydrate inhibitor
performance was found to improve as the size of the alkyl pendant group increased
from methyl to ethyl and then n-propyl or isopropyl.
The best-performing homopolymer was poly(N-iso-propyl methacrylamide),
which showed an onset temperature of 10.0 ◦C at 2500 ppm [102].
The four structurally different N-butyl methacrylamides (n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-)
were copolymerized with hydrophilic comonomers in order to investigate their
potential as kinetic hydrate inhibitors. The best-performing copolymer containing
butyl groups was a 1:1 copolymer of N-tert-butyl methacrylamide and N-methyl
methacrylamide, which gave an average onset temperature of 8.3 ◦C at 2500 ppm.
The kinetic hydrate inhibitor performance of the N-propyl methacrylamide polymers
(n- and iso-) was further investigated by adjusting the synthetic route. For example,
poly(N-iso-propyl methacrylamide) made and kept in n-butyl glycol ether as a 16.6%
solution demonstrated excellent performance, with an average onset temperature of
4.2 ◦C at a polymer concentration of 2500 ppm. The concentration of the n-butyl
glycol ether was 12,500 ppm [102].
Methacrylic polymers
A method for inhibiting hydrate formation in a fluid that is containing water and a
gas has been reported [103].
The method consists of contacting the fluid with an effective amount of a hydrate
inhibitor composition. The composition contains from about 5% to 55% of heavy
aromatic naphtha, and from about 0.1% to 15% of 2-ethyl hexanol, and from about
0.1% to 50% of a kinetic hydrate inhibiting polymer or a kinetic hydrate inhibiting
oligomer.
The synthesis of such polymers has been described [104]. In particular, the syn￾thesis of a kinetic hydrate inhibitor polymer has been reported to be as follows [103]:
Preparation 13–2: A solution of N-isopropyl methacrylamide (2.145 g, 16.866 mmol),
a 50% active aqueous methacrylamidopropyl trimethylammonium chloride solution
(0.330 g, 0.747 mmol), and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (7.535 g, 7.535 ml) were
combined, stirred, and heated to 105 ◦C in a capped vial, which was vented to the
atmosphere with a needle.
During heating, the vial cap was removed and tert-butyl peroctanoate (0.990 g,
4.577 mmol) was added. After heating for 2 h, the vial was allowed to cool to 20-60 ◦C.
After the vial was cooled to 20-60 ◦C. 2-Ethyl hexanol (0.900 g, 1.084 ml) and heavy
aromatic naphtha (8.100 g, 9.000 ml) were added to the vial via a syringe and the vial was
shaken by hand.
The monomers used for Preparation 13–2 are shown in Figure 13.11.

inhibition tests at conditions of 7 ◦C subcooling dosed at 1% by volume based on the
water cut of the system fluids [105]. Such a copolymer can be prepared as follows:
Preparation 13–3: 12.1 g Acryloylmorpholine, 8.0 g vinylimidazole, and 60 g methanol
were charged to a 500 ml reaction pot and degassed with nitrogen for 10 min. The
2,2
-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (VAZO 56 WSW) initiator (0.645 g) was
dissolved in methanol (31.6 g) in a pressure equalizing funnel and also degassed for
10 min. The solution of the monomers was heated to a temperature between 65 and 67 ◦C
and the initiator solution was added to the heated monomer solution as a single addition.
The reaction was left to stir at 65-67 ◦C under nitrogen for 1 h. The heat was removed and
the polymer was allowed to cool with stirring.
The initiator and the monomers are shown in Figure 13.12.
The copolymer showed very encouraging performances in hydrate inhibition tests
and also passed a series of compatibility and secondary property tests [105].
The copolymer passed high total dissolved solids brine compatibility tests and
secondary property tests including foaming and hot injection tests, which make it
useful as a kinetic hydrate inhibitor in gas production systems susceptible to the
formation of natural gas hydrates [105].
In addition, the preparation of a terpolymer of acryloylmorpholine, vinylimida￾zole, and vinylcaprolactam has been detailed as follows [105]:
Preparation 13–4: The synthesis of the terpolymer was performed in a two-piece glass
reactor with five ports available for ancillary equipment including: overhead mechanical
agitator, reflux condenser, dropping funnel, thermocouple, and stopper. The empty vessel
was placed on a tared balance and the reagents added by weight.
As monomers 11.60% 4-acryloylmorpholine, 7.73% N-vinylimidazole, 2.53% 1-
vinylcaprolactam in 52.76% methanol, and 16.92% 2-propanol were added to the vessel
and degassed for a period of 5 min before heating to 65 ◦C. An aqueous solution of564 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (VAZO 56 WSW) initiator was also
degassed for 5 min or until the solid initiator was dissolved. The initiator solution
comprised 0.50 g VAZO in 4.98 g water. A head of positive nitrogen pressure was
maintained throughout the reaction to reduce any air ingress potentially capable of killing
free radicals and preventing their propagation through the mixture.
When the monomer solution reached 65 ◦C, the VAZO solution was added to the
monomer solution in a single addition. If the reaction was on a scale larger than about
1 kg (total mass), the VAZO solution could be added in a stepwise fashion to control the
exotherm produced. The reaction was allowed to proceed with mechanical agitation for
90 min or until the reaction was deemed complete by nonvolatile residue analysis. The
clear yellow solution was allowed to cool with stirring until ambient temperature was
achieved.
The cooled mixture appeared slightly cloudy and was weighed to determine any
weight loss due to solvent losses over the course of the reaction period. Any lost solvent
was replaced with methanol (the component most likely to be lost) to maintain the original
mass. Two to three percentage of water was added to the cloudy mixture and stirred until
the mixture became completely clear.13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 565
Block copolymer of vinylcaprolactam, acrylamide
A block copolymer poly(N-vinyl caprolactam)-co-acrylamide) was made from N￾vinyl caprolactam with acrylamide by a living radical copolymerization [106].
The kinetic inhibitory performance of the block copolymer on the CH4 hydrate
formation was investigated and compared with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and poly(N￾vinyl caprolactam).
The results indicated that the higher-cloud-point block copolymer behaved better
than poly(N-vinyl caprolactam) under the same conditions. Powder X-ray diffraction
spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy showed that a Structure I hydrate was formed
with and without kinetic hydrate inhibitors. However, compared to pure water, the
presence of the kinetic hydrate inhibitors reduced the ratio of large to small cage
occupancy by CH4. The stronger the inhibition activity was, the lower the value
became [106].
13.9.8 WATERBORNE POLYURETHANES
A new technique based on waterborne polymers for designing and synthesizing
kinetic hydrate inhibitors has been proposed to prevent methane hydrate formation
[107]. This topic is a challenging subject in flow assurance problems in gas and
oilfields. The proposed technique helps to get kinetic hydrate inhibitors with the
required number and distance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups in molecule
and good solubility in water. The performance of these new kinetic hydrate inhibitors
was investigated by high-pressure microdifferential scanning calorimeter and high￾pressure autoclave cell. The results demonstrated the high performance of these
inhibitors in delaying the induction time (10-20 times) and reducing the hydrate
growth rate (three times).
Additionally, they did not increase hydrate dissociation temperature in compari￾son with pure water and showed thermodynamic inhibition as well. The inhibition
effect of the synthesized polymers is significantly improved with the increase of
concentration. Since this is the first report of the use of waterborne polymers
as kinetic hydrate inhibitors, we expect that kinetic hydrate inhibitors based on
waterborne-based polymers can be a prospective option for preventing methane
hydrate formation [107].
Aspartic acid polymers
The gas hydrate formation can be inhibited by the use of a polyester polymer as a
kinetic hydrate inhibitor [108]. The polyester polymer can be made of a plurality
of ester groups in the polymer backbone and a plurality of amino or ammonium
groups directly pendent from the backbone of the polymer. Exemplary compound are
copolymers of aspartic acid or glutamic acid with polyols such as sorbitol, ethylene
glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, PEG-200, and PEG-400 [108]. Some of
these compounds are shown in Figure 13.13.566 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

Monomers for poly(ester)s [108].
Several examples for the synthesis of kinetic hydrate inhibitor polymers have
been presented. A copolymer from aspartic acid and sorbitol can be prepared as
follows [108]:
Preparation 13–5: Aspartic acid (100.0 g, 0.7513 mol) was mixed with hydrochloric
acid 36% (76.1 g, 0.7514 mol) and dried at 60 ◦C for 24 h. The aspartic acid hydrochloride
(52.9 g, 0.312 mol) was then added to a 500 ml round bottom flask equipped with a Dean
Stark condensation setup. Sorbitol (57.0 g, 0.313 mol) and a catalyst, p-toluenesulfonic
acid (1.1 g, 1%), was added to the aspartic acid hydrochloride and mixed using magnetic
stirring. Toluene (100 ml) was added to the mixture. The system was heated in an oil
bath. The set temperature in the oil bath was 140 ◦C. The reaction was monitored by the
amount of water produced. When a theoretical amount of water was reached and no more
water would come off, the reaction was stopped. The product was cooled down to 60 ◦C
and transferred to a suitable container for storage.
It has been shown that polymers derived from aspartic acid are biodegradable
[109–111]. Thus, the kinetic inhibitor presented here is more than 20% biodegrad￾able, exhibits no inherent cloud point behavior upon heating, and gives an induction
time greater than 24 h at 6 ◦C subcooling using synthetic natural gas [108].
Carboxy alkyl-ester antiagglomerants
Carboxy alkyl-ester compounds that can be used in hydrate inhibitor compositions
have been described [112]. In addition, methods of making the carboxy alkyl ester
compound have been detailed.
Several examples for the synthesis of such compositions using, for example,
maleic anhydride with various long chain alcohols and various amines have been
described [112]. Here the hydroxyl group of the alcohol opens the maleic anhydride
ring and the amine adds to the double bond of maleic anhydride.13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 567

in Table 13.9.
Several examples of reactions have been detailed, totaling 38 reactions. The
reaction of maleic anhydride-alcohol, 2-ethyl hexanol, and pyrrolidine runs as
follows [112]:
Preparation 13–6: 5 g of Maleic anhydride and 6.64 g of 2-ethyl hexanol were added
to a vial with a stir bar. At ambient temperature, the maleic anhydride in the solution
of 2-ethyl hexanol was solid. The mixture was heated to 60 ◦C with stirring and left
at 60 ◦C overnight. After stirring overnight at 60 ◦C, the solution was free-flowing and
homogenous with dispersed solid particles. Thin layer chromatography showed that 2-
ethyl hexanol was consumed in the reaction.
The vial was heated to 80 ◦C and the solid particulate dissolved. After stirring for
approximately 8 h at 80 ◦C, approximately 4.5 ml of pyrrolidine (4.26 g) was added.
A substoichiometric amount of pyrrolidine was added so that the reaction could be
monitored more effectively. The reaction was then cooled to ambient temperature and
solidified.568 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

The reaction is detailed as shown in Figure 13.14.
Furthermore, the reaction of maleic anhydride-alcohol, 1-dodecanol, and azepane
propylamine runs as follows [112]:
Preparation 13–7: 6.89 g of Maleic anhydride was charged to a vial with 13.07 g
1-dodecanol. The mixture was warmed to 60 ◦C for 3 h, then to 70 ◦C for 2 h. The
mixture turned opaque with white solids. The temperature was increased to 75 ◦C for
5 h and then cooled to room temperature to produce a solid white mass. The solid was
warmed to 75 ◦C to melt. Then, 10.96 g azepane propylamine was added dropwise and
reacted exothermically to a maximum of 110 ◦C. The mixture was cooled slowly for 3 h
to 80 ◦C.
The reaction is detailed as shown in Figure 13.15.
The properties of the compounds were tested by rocking cell tests, biodegradation
tests, and toxicity tests [112].

The toxicity test results show acceptable toxicity results and that a concentration

Bimodal distributions
A polymer is sometimes characterized as a bowl of spaghetti. Sometimes the
individual strands of spaghetti are all approximately the same length, while at other
times, the individual strands of spaghetti may have a wide variety of different
lengths.
This is an analogy used to describe molecular weight variations among polymers.
Bimodal polymers would be characterized as bowls of spaghetti wherein the indi￾vidual strands of spaghetti have primarily two lengths, with a significant difference
between the two lengths [93].
While certain polymeric are known to be effective inhibitors for gas hydrate
formation, it has been surprising that inhibitor polymers with bimodal molecular570 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
weight distributions have substantially improved performance as kinetic hydrate
inhibitors relative to the same polymers with a narrow molecular weight range.
Therefore, polymers or blends with a bimodal distribution of the molecular weight
are preferred [93].
A polymeric material with a bimodal molecular weight distribution can be
produced either during the polymerization process itself or after polymerization.
During the polymerization reaction, bimodal molecular weight distributions can be
obtained by the [93]:
• choice of polymerization catalyst;
• staged initiator addition;
• use of emulsifiers;
• control of reaction viscosity;
• presence of preformed polymer; and
• choice of solvent.
The conditions for the production of a bimodal distribution must be optimized
for a particular polymer. In contrast, bimodal molecular weight distributions can be
obtained by manipulations after the polymerization reaction. Most simply, two grades
of the same polymer with different molecular weight are blended.
The miscibility is not dependent on the molecular weight of the polymer. On
the other hand, polymers originating from different monomers are mostly not
homogeneously miscible. The situation is completely different from metals that are
likely to form alloys.
Poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)
The use of polymers, or copolymers, respectively, having a linear backbone, such as
poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) for inhibiting the formation, growth, and the agglomer￾ation of gas hydrates has been described [114].
Further, the use of compounds referred to as quats has been described [24].
These quat type compounds contain quaternary ammonium groups. Preferred quats
comprise two long chains, with 8-50 carbon atoms, which may also contain ester
groups or branched structures [115].
Functionalization
Copolymers from ethylene and maleic anhydride (MA) have the anhydride moiety
in their backbone. The anhydride is reactive toward amines and alcohols. The
modification with amines is shown in Figure 13.16.
When opening the anhydride ring with an amine, a pending hydroxy group is
formed. This hydroxy group can be reacted further, for example, it can be neutralized.
Several compounds have been synthesized and evaluated for their activity in hydrate
control. The effectiveness of these compounds is shown in Table 13.10.13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 571

Dendrimers
Dendrimeric polymers are basically highly branched molecules. They consist of
a core, a number of branching generations and end groups. In Figure 13.17, the
structure of a dendrimer composed from succinic anhydride and diisoproanolamine
is shown.
For example, diisoproanolamine bears one amino functionality and two hydroxyl
functionalities. Dendrimers from diisoproanolamine will be classified as dendrimers
of the AB2 type.
A concise introduction into the basic issues of dendrimers, including highly
appealing chemical drawings, can be found in the literature [117]. A branching
moiety consists of structural units, which are bound radially to the core or to the
structural units of a previous generation and which extend outwards. The structural
units have at least two reactive monofunctional groups besides of one monofunctional
group and one multifunctional group. The degree of branching of a particular
generation present in dendrimers is defined as the ratio between the number of
branchings present and the maximum number of branchings possible in a completely
branched dendrimer.572 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

Dendrimeric compounds may have defects in the branching structure, may also
be branched asymmetrically or have an incomplete degree of branching in which
case the dendrimeric compound contains both functional groups and functional end
groups.
Dendrimers have been claimed to be low dose, hydrate inhibitors [118]. Some
types are commercially available. Hyperbranched poly(ester amide)s have been
found to be suitable as hydrate formation inhibitors [115].13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 573

These compounds are synthesized by the condensation of cyclic anhydrides
with di- or tri-alkanolamines. Examples for monomers for hyperbranched poly(ester
amide)s are shown in Table 13.11.
The affectivity of the dendritic compounds was demonstrated as follows.
A standard solution was prepared containing 78.7% water, 18.4% tetrahydrofuran,
and 2.9% sodium chloride. To 70 g of this solution, varying amounts of dendritic
compounds were added. The solution was thermostated at 0 ◦C and after 30 min the
amount of hydrate crystals formed was determined [115]. The results are given in
Table 13.12.
The promising results obtained with tetrahydrofuran water solutions could be
confirmed also under more realistic conditions with a more complicated experimental
setup [115].
Low-dosage hydrate inhibitors
Gas hydrates are ice-like solids that are formed from small, nonpolar molecules and
water at lower temperatures and at increased pressures. Under these conditions, the
water molecules can form cage-like structures around these small nonpolar molecules
(typically dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, ethane,
propane, butane, and iso-butane), creating a type of host-guest interaction also known
as a clathrate or a clathrate hydrate. The specific architecture of this cage structure
can be one of several types, depending on the identity of the guest molecules [119].
Once formed, these crystalline cage structures tend to settle out from the solution
and accumulate into large solid masses that can travel by oil and gas transporting
pipelines, and potentially block or damage the pipelines or related equipment.
The damage resulting from a blockage can be very costly from an equipment574 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
repair standpoint, as well as from the loss of production, and finally the resultant
environmental impact.
A number of methods are used to prevent these blockages, such as the usage of
thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors, antiagglomerant hydrate inhibitors, and kinetic
hydrate inhibitors. The amount of chemical needed to prevent blockages varies
widely depending on the type of inhibitor employed [119].
Thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors are substances that can reduce the temperature
at which the hydrates form at a given pressure and water content, and are typically
used at very high concentrations (regularly dosed as high as 50% based on water
content-glycol is often used in amounts as high as 100% of the weight of the produced
water). Therefore, there is a substantial cost associated with the transportation and
storage of large quantities of these solvents.
A more cost-effective alternative is the use of low-dosage hydrate inhibitors, as
they generally require a dose of less than about 2% to inhibit the nucleation or growth
of gas hydrates. There are two general types of low-dosage hydrate inhibitors; kinetic
hydrate inhibitors and antiagglomerants, which are both typically used at much lower
concentrations. Kinetic hydrate inhibitors work by delaying the growth of gas hydrate
crystals. They also function as antinucleators.
In contrast, antiagglomerant hydrate inhibitors allow hydrates to form, but they
prevent them from agglomerating and subsequently accumulating into larger masses
capable of causing plugs. The function of antiagglomerants is to keep hydrate
particles dispersed as a fluid slurry within the hydrocarbon phase.
Hydrate inhibitors have been developed that can be cationic ammonium surfac￾tants [119]. These hydrate inhibitors can be used as low-dosage hydrate inhibitors for
inhibiting the formation and/or agglomeration of natural gas hydrates, for example,
which can lead to undesirable plugs in the petroleum industry if left untreated.
The synthesis of these hydrate inhibitors has been detailed in several examples.
An example for the preparation is as follows [119]:
Preparation 13–8: To a 500 ml, three-neck round bottom flask was added about 100.0 g
(0.374 mol) oleylamine and a magnetic stir bar. The flask was fitted with a thermocouple,
reflux condenser, and addition funnel containing about 32.18 g (0.374 mol) methyl
acrylate. The acrylate was added to the stirring amine slowly. Once the addition was
complete, the mixture was stirred for about 1 h.
To the resulting yellow liquid was added about 26.59 g (0.374 mol) pyrrolidine and
catalytic p-toluenesulfonic acid (about 0.79 g). An insulated Dean-Stark apparatus was
attached between the round bottom flask and reflux condenser for methanol removal. The
reaction mixture was heated to about 90 ◦C for about 12 h, at which time FTIR analysis
confirmed the disappearance of the ester. Upon cooling to ambient temperature, a yellow￾orange liquid was formed. To the resulting amide at ambient temperature was added about
97.39 g methanol and then about 19.36 g (0.322 mol) of acetic acid, and the mixture was
stirred at ambient temperature for about 2 h to produce the hydrate inhibitor.13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 575

The synthesis is also shown in Figure 13.18. Zwitterionic hydrate inhibitors can
be synthesized as follows [119]:
Preparation 13–9: To a 500 ml, three-neck round bottom flask was added about 100.0 g
(0.523 mol) cocoamine and a magnetic stir bar. The flask was fitted with a thermocouple,
reflux condenser, and an addition funnel containing about 45.06 g (0.523 mol) methyl
acrylate. The acrylate was slowly added to the stirring amine at room temperature. Once
the addition was complete, the mixture was stirred for about 1 h.
To the resulting yellow liquid, was added about 97.53 g (0.523 mol) dibutylamino￾propylamine. An insulated Dean-Stark apparatus was attached between the round bottom
flask and reflux condenser for removal of the methanol. The reaction mixture was heated
to 165 ◦C for about 6 h, at which time FTIR analysis confirmed the disappearance of the
ester. Upon cooling to ambient temperature, an off-white solid was formed. After melting
the off-white amide solid at 40 ◦C in a water bath, about 100.0 g (0.232 mol) was charged
to a 500 ml, three-neck round bottom flask which was equipped with an overhead stirred
with a stir blade, thermocouple, and an addition funnel contained about 16.72 g of acrylic
acid. The acrylic acid was slowly added to the stirring amide at room temperature, and576 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

liquid. After cooling room temperature, about 25.0 g (0.050 mol) of the resulting betaine
product was combined with about 23.87 g of methanol to form a homogeneous liquid
solution.
Poly(ether) amines
A series of poly(ether) amines are available under the tradename Jeffamine® from
Huntsman. There are monoamines that contain a single amino end group, as well as
diamines with amino groups on both ends of the poly(ether). The ether moieties are
formed from the ring opening reaction of ethylene oxide (EO) or propylene oxide
(PO) [120].
The Jeffamine® D series are end-capped diaminies, the poly(ether) made from
EO or PO moieties. The trailing number refers to the molecular weight given in
Dalton. In addition, there are products made from both EO and PO. The basic
structure of a poly(ether amine) is shown in Figure 13.19.
Quaternized poly(ether amine)s are effective as gas hydrate inhibitors [121,122].
These compounds are also useful in preventing the growth of gas hydrates that are
already formed.
Preparation 13–10: Quaternary salt products can be prepared from poly(ether amine)s
and alkyl bromides. The poly(ether amine)s is warmed up to 75 ◦C under stirring. Then
the alkyl bromide is added drop wise to the amine during a period of 1.5 h.
During the bromide addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture is allowed to
increase to 90 ◦C. After complete bromide addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for
additional 2 h at 90 ◦C. The reaction products are mostly amber viscous liquids.
Quaternized poly(ether) amines have been tested for their effectiveness at sub￾ambient temperatures in a flow apparatus. The times when the flow stopped due to
extensive hydrate formation were noted and addressed as freeze time. The results are
shown in Table 13.13.
As can be seen from the data in Table 13.13, the salts of poly(ether) ammonium
compounds provide a superior method of inhibiting gas hydrate formation as com￾pared to simple ammonium and phosphonium quaternary compounds and starting
amines by themselves.13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 577

In addition, these compounds display a synergistic effect when applied in
admixture with a polymeric kinetic hydrate inhibitor such as poly(vinylcaprolactam).
For example, a mixture of only 0.05% poly(vinylcaprolactam) and 0.05%
Jeffamine® D-230 C12Br exhibits a freeze time at −14 ◦C of 27 h.
Amines
Several amines have been synthesized and tested as gas hydrate inhibitors [123].
Certain quaternary alkylammonium compounds have not only corrosion-inhibiting
but also biostatic properties. However, the strong algae toxicity and the moderate
biodegradability restrict the use of some of these compounds to ecologically insensi￾tive fields of application, for example onshore [124].
N,N
-Dimethyl-N,N
-dilauryl ethylene diamine can be prepared from lauronitrile
and N,N
-dimethylethylene diamine under hydrogen pressure. This compound is
then the starting point for quaternization and formation of the respective hydroxide
and the oxide. Several analogous compounds have been prepared according to this
procedure [24].
In addition to their activity as gas hydrate inhibitors, some of the compounds
described in the literature [24] may exhibit increased biodegradation and lower
aquatic toxicity in comparison to conventional inhibitors.
In the same way, alkylaminoalkyl esters, which can be obtained via alkenyl
succinic anhydrides show an enhanced biodegradability and are moreover active as
corrosion inhibitors [125]. Some of the compounds are summarized in Table 13.14.
L-threonine
The synthesis of organic compounds obtained from l-threonine has been reported
[126]. These compounds show a high potential of their use as CO2 hydrate inhibitors.
l-threonine is shown in Figure 13.20.
Dodecyl l-threonine hydrochloride showed the best performance in inhibiting
CO2 gas hydrate.578 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

This characteristic is related to the increase carbon chain in each molecule
(higher hydrophobicity) leading to a reduction on CO2 solubility in water. The study
also showed the occurrence of the salting out effect and a reduced water activity
coefficient [126].
Hydroxyalkylurethane
A gas hydrate inhibitor composition has been described that is a hydroxyalky￾lurethane [81]. The hydroxyalkylurethane can be prepared by the reaction of an
amine and an alkylene carbonate.
Examples of amines are collected in Table 13.15 and examples of alkylene
carbonates are listed in Table 13.16.
The hydroxyalkylurethane can be obtained by contacting the amine and alkylene
carbonate and allowing them to react. The reaction between the amine and alkylene
carbonate is generally exothermic and therefore may require a controlled metering of
either the amine into the alkylene carbonate or vice versa, so as to maintain a correct
reaction temperature.
Hydrophilic head hydrate inhibitors
Compounds with multiple hydrophilic heads and a lipophilic tail may be employed
into fluids to inhibit the agglomeration of hydrates [127,128]. Such low-dosage
hydrate inhibitors may show an enhanced interactivity with hydrate crystals and/or
hydrate-forming molecules. The synthesis of such compounds is shown in Fig￾ure 13.21.
In the first step, a primary amine is used to react with an epihalohydrin
[128]. The epihalohydrin may be epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin, epifluorohydrin,13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 579

and dimethylbutylamine [128]. Some of these compounds are shown in Figure 13.22.

molecular dynamics simulation [129]. All the simulations were carried out with the
TINKER software version 03 package [130].
The ionic liquids investigated are shown in Table 13.17 and Figure 13.23.
The simulations showed that [C2OHmim][f2N] and [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] were
strongly hydrated in comparison to the other ionic liquids because of hydrogen
bonding between OH groups of the cation and water molecules [129]. They also
exhibit high diffusion rates toward crystal surface and bond to it through strong
intermolecular interactions.
As a result, these two ionic liquids are stronger thermokinetic inhibitors for
formation and growth of methane hydrates compared to other ionic liquids studied in
this work as well as conventional inhibitors like methanol and NaCl. The simulations
also revealed that cations of [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] and [C2OHmim][f2N] show that
the presence of ions near the hydrate crystal causes hindrance for water and guest
molecules adsorbing on the hydrate surface, which inhibits the growth of hydrate
crystals. In addition, it is shown that [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] and [C2OHmim][f2N] are
more likely to inhibit hydrate formation [129].
Quaternary ammonium salts
Quaternary ammonium salts containing the tert-heptyl group have been synthesized
[131]. The quaternary ammonium salts are shown in Figure 13.24.
Tris(tert-heptyl)(n-propyl)ammonium bromide is water-soluble and tris(tert￾heptyl)(n-pentyl)ammonium bromide is only sparingly water-soluble. Both
compounds were found to be powerful inhibitors of Structure II tetrahydrofuran

bromide being as good as or better than that of either tetra(iso-alkyl)- or tetra(n￾alkyl)ammonium bromides [131].
Both tert-heptyl salts were also excellent synergists in blends with poly(N￾vinylcaprolactam) for kinetic hydrate inhibition of a Structure II-forming natural gas
mixture using decane and 1.5% aqueous NaCl at 80% water cut. This was found
to be surprising for tris(tert-heptyl)(n-pentyl)ammonium bromide as this compound
is sparingly water-soluble and thus partitions mostly to the liquid hydrocarbon
phase [131].
The thermodynamic hydrate inhibition effect induced by three different quater￾nary ammonium salts, that is, tetraethylammonium iodide, tetramethylammonium
bromide, and tetraethylammonium bromide, on the formation of methane gas
hydrates has been investigated [132].
The thermodynamic hydrate inhibition impact was also determined in the pres￾ence of monethylene glycol for tetramethylammonium bromide and tetraethylam￾monium bromide. The inhibition capacity was examined by finding the average
suppression temperature. The experiments were performed in the pressure range of
3.45-8.3 MPa at the concentration values of 1%, 5%, and 10%. The hydrate liquid
vapor equilibrium points were calculated by using the isochoric thermodynamic cycle
(T-cycle) method [132].582 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

A Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) study [133]
was also performed to understand the thermodynamic hydrate inhibition behavior of
the compounds by analyzing the sigma profile. Along with this, hydrate dissociation
enthalpies Hdiss were considered.
The results revealed that inhibition effect increased with the increase in con￾centration. Tetramethylammonium bromide showed a better impact on the hydrate
suppression in comparison to tetraethylammonium bromide and tetraethylammonium
iodide in pure as well as in mixture with monethylene glycol.
In the thermodynamic modeling section, the Dickens and Quinby-Hunt model
[134] was employed to predict hydrate liquid vapor equilibrium data. The equilibrium
temperatures predicted by the model were compared with the experimental results
and found to be in good agreement. Thus, these compounds can be employed in
thermodynamic hydrate inhibition applications and flow assurance schemes [132].
Amino ester surfactant compounds
β-Amino ester surfactant compounds and compositions have been described that
are useful in applications relating to inhibition of gas hydrate agglomerates in the
production, transportation, storage, and separation of crude oil and natural gas [135].
Exemplary compounds are listed in Table 13.18 and some are shown in Figure 13.25.
1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
bromide
The performance of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
bromide as methane hydrate inhibitors was evaluated [136]. These ionic liquids are
known to be both kinetic and thermodynamic inhibitors, but they promote hydrate
growth at mole fractions of 1% and 5% in the pressure range studied.
Hydrate dissociation data were obtained using high-pressure calorimetry for
aqueous solutions with inhibitor mole fractions from 1.0% to 15.0% and pressures
from 9.6 to 100 MPa.
The effectiveness of these ionic liquids as thermodynamic inhibitors at high
pressures was compared to that of methanol, a commercial inhibitor commonly used
in the oil and gas industry.584 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

It was found that 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride is more effective than 1-
butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and methanol, considering equimolar aqueous
solutions, even though methanol is more effective for solutions with the same mass
fraction [136].
Poly(imine) adducts
Adducts of poly(amide)s, amines, glycols, and formaldehyde are suitable gas hydrate
inhibitors [137]. For example, the adducts are prepared as follows [137]:
Preparation 13–11: To a solution of 2.54 g of poly(ethyleneimine) with a molecular
weight of 600 Da in 56 g of methanol 6.67 g of caprolactam is dissolved. Further, to this
solution 4.79 g of 37% aqueous formaldehyde is added. The solution is then sealed in a
bottle and kept at 65 ◦C for 20 h to give a clear, light amber solution of the gas hydrate
inhibitor.586 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

Antifreeze proteins
Plants and poikilothermic animals, such as insects and cold water fish are known to
protect themselves from freezing, both by antifreezes such as glycols and by special
peptides and glycopeptides also addressed as antifreeze proteins and antifreeze
glycoproteins, which interfere with the crystal growth of ice [24].
Antifreeze agents present in animals in the Antarctic region are glycopeptides
composed of alanine, threonine, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine. In other13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 587

northern fishes, peptides containing alanine, aspartate, glutamate, threonine, and
serine have been found [138].
Microbes show an extraordinary variety of adaptations to extreme conditions.
So-called thermophiles are organisms that survive at temperatures near the boiling
point of water. In contrast, psychrophiles are bacteria that tolerate extraordinary low
temperatures.
To survive temperatures below the freezing point of ordinary water, certain
microbes protect themselves against growing ice crystals, which could damage cell
membranes. They produce cryoprotectants which lower nucleation temperatures for
ice. These cryoprotectants include ice nucleation proteins [139].
The growth of ice crystals can be inhibited even in the presence of small
amounts of such substances. The homogeneous nucleation and crystallization rates588 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

II Cysteine-rich globular proteins with disulfide moieties
III Similar overall hydrophobicity to type I proteins
IV α-Helical proteins rich in glutamate and glutamine
V Great thermal hysteresis value
are sensitive to low concentrations. The antifreeze activity of glycoproteins results
from the sorption of the protein on the active growth sites of ice crystals [140].
As the proteins are adsorbed, they change they curvature of the surface, thus
making the nucleation and growth of ice crystals unlikely [139]. In contrast, ice
nucleating proteins prevent an extensive supercooling and act in the reverse way, as
they allow the formation of ice close to the freezing temperature. Antifreeze proteins
exhibit three kinds of activities [141]:
1. They can maintain the supercooled state of body fluids by inhibiting the usual
growth of ice.
2. They have the capacity to inhibit recrystallization.
3. They may serve as plasma membrane protectors at low temperature.
Antifreeze proteins have been classified into several basic types. These types are
summarized in Table 13.19.
Antifreeze proteins are present in the body fluids of some polar fishes, plants, or
insects. The proteins adsorb to surfaces of an ice crystal and inhibit the growth of the
ice crystal [142].
The effect of type I fish antifreeze protein from the winter flounder, Pleuronectes
americanus (Walbaum), on the formation of tetrahydrofuran clathrate hydrate has
been investigated. The antifreeze protein acts in modifying the clathrate hydrate
crystal morphology from an octahedral shape to a plate shape. The protein seems to
be more effective than poly(vinylpyrrolidone). In addition, the experiments suggest
propane-hydrate growth could be also inhibited [143].
A mechanism concerning the surface adsorption has been proposed. After the
protein molecules are attached to the surface of ice, the growth of ice crystals
within the area between the adsorbed protein molecules becomes unfavorable. The
adsorption of the protein molecules results in an increase of the curvature of the
surface. This curvature subsequently inhibits further growth of the ice crystals [144].
Common melting point depressants, that is, antifreezes are lower alcohols,
glycols, and inorganic salts. They can be used to prevent the formation of hydrates.
However, at the high subcooling experienced in deep waters, the antifreezes need
to be added in substantial amounts, up to quantity equal to the amount of produced
water, to be effective [24]. Antifreeze proteins are also acting as surfactants.
Not only antifreeze proteins themselves have been proposed for gas hydrate
inhibition but also active fragments derived from them, as well as mimetics of13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 589

antifreeze proteins. Suitable proteins or fragments contain a P-helix or three helices
(a P-roll, a glycoprotein, or a globular structure). Such antifreeze proteins may be
derived, for example, from animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria [145]. Special
examples of antifreeze proteins are summarized in Table 13.20.
Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) encoding antifreeze proteins of Tenebrio molitor
have been isolated and found to encode 7-13 kDa cystine-rich proteins, composed
largely of 12 amino acids repeat units [146,153]. DNA of Choristoneura fumiferana
encoding antifreeze proteins of 9-12 kDa have also been cloned [154].
Threonines match the ice lattice in antifreeze protein/ice models. In some
antifreeze proteins, threonines are substituted by valine or isoleucine, amino acids
with methyl groups and similar spatial volumes to threonine. Namely, it is believed
that nonpolar interactions could be important for the inhibition of ice growth [145].
Insect antifreeze proteins exhibit hyperactivity in comparison to fish antifreeze
proteins. Their activity is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of fish
antifreeze proteins.
Despite of the remarkable performance of antifreeze proteins, their production
and use in oilfield applications has been considered to be uneconomical [24].
Hyperbranched polymers
Chelating polymers have been introduced that are capable of interacting with charged
gaseous molecules such as carbon dioxide, by removing the carbon dioxide. The
polymers scavenge the carbon dioxide and thus prevent the methane or ethane
hydrate structure from forming, because they require carbon dioxide to stabilize their
structure [155].
An example for such a polymer is a hyperbranched polyamino polymer or a
dendritic polyamino polymer grafted onto silica as a dispersion [155].
The method for producing the hyperbranched polymer grafted onto silica as a
dispersion has been described [155].590 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

Sulfolane derivatives
Antiagglomerate hydrate inhibitors have been described [156]. Antiagglomerate
hydrate inhibitors allow for the formation of hydrate particles that do not adhere
or agglomerate to themselves or to other solid surfaces. The antiagglomerate hydrate
inhibitors are made from sulfolane-based compounds. A sulfolane derivative with
such a structure is shown in Figure 13.26.
The ability of a hydrate inhibitor that contains a sulfolane derivative to prevent
hydrate formation was tested with a rolling ball apparatus [156]. A cylindrical metal
and sapphire vessel that contained a stainless steel ball, which can freely roll back
and forth over the entire (axial) length of the cell when the cell is tilted, was equipped
with a pressure transducer to allow a reading of the gas pressure in the cell and some
auxiliary tubing to facilitate cleaning and filling of the cell. The vessel was filled with
5.6 ml of a liquid hydrocarbon, a gas blend comprising a 1.970 mol-% carbon dioxide,
86.281 mol-% methane, 6.000 mol-% ethane, 3.920 mol-% propane, 0.851 mol-%
i-butane, and 0.978 mol-% n-butane, a mixture of carbon dioxide, methane, ethane,
propane, i-butane, and n-butane, and 1.4 ml of a brine comprising 3.5% (w/v) NaCl
and 5% (w/v) 3-(decylamino)thiolane-1,1-dione. After being filled, the cell was
pressurized with agitation to 72 bar at room temperature. Once the pressure had
stabilized, the cell was linearly cooled to 5 ◦C over a 20-h period.
Hydrate formation was observed and evaluated at multiple junctures during the
test. It was observed that the hydrates formed in this experiment were less than 1 mm
in size and did not display any cohesion to other hydrate crystals in the test cell.
In addition, the hydrates formed were not observed to adhere to any of the interior
surfaces of the cell [156].
13.9.9 AGGLOMERATION INHIBITORS
Unlike the kinetic hydrate inhibitors, antiagglomerate hydrate inhibitors are effective
only in the presence of an oil phase. These inhibitors do not inhibit the formation
of gas hydrates to the same level as kinetic inhibitors, rather their primary activity
is in preventing the agglomeration of hydrate crystals. The oil phase provides a
transport medium for the hydrates which are referred to as hydrate slurries so
that the overall viscosity of the medium is kept low and can be transported along13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 591
the pipeline. As such, the hydrate crystals formed in the water droplets are prevented
from agglomerating into a larger crystalline mass [157].
Besides of nucleation inhibitors, crystal growth inhibitors, or modifiers, com￾pounds can be utilized that inhibit the formation and agglomeration of hydrate
crystals [24,65,89]. The products used in this aspect are ammonium, phosphonium,
or sulfonium alkylated compounds, including quaternary compounds.
Further, to reduce the tendency of hydrates to agglomerate, the addition of a
condensation product from poly(alkenyl succinic acid) and a polyethyleneglycolmo￾noether is successful [158]. The product is nonionic and has amphiphilic properties.
In general, a concentration between 0.1% and 5%, based on the water present, is
sufficient to prevent agglomeration. The following copolymers, as well as several
other polymers (e.g., copolymers from acrylamides, acrylates, methacrylamides,
methacrylates, N-vinyl heterocyclics, vinyl ethers, N-vinyl amides), are useful for
inhibiting the formation of clathrate hydrates in fluids [159–165]:
• acrylamide-maleimide;
• N-vinyl amide-maleimide;
• vinyl lactam-maleimide;
• alkenyl cyclic imino ether-maleimide; and
• acryloylamide-maleimide.
Modified amino acids such as N-acyl-dehydroalanine polymers and copolymers
with N-vinyl-N-methyl acetamide seem to be particularly effective [159].
Dispersing hydrates into a condensate phase by antiagglomerants is another alter￾native to kinetic or thermodynamic inhibitors to prevent hydrate-plug formation in a
gas production pipeline [166,167]. This method has been taken into consideration for
pipeline transport. In laboratory experiments, it was shown that several commercial
dispersants were successful.
At low-water concentrations, dodecyl-2-(2-caprolactamyl) ethanamide was
shown to be superior [167]. Antiagglomerants have been used in several field
applications in deep water systems, both in subsea wells and dry tree wells,
under both flowing and shut-in conditions [166]. Potential advantages of the
antiagglomerants over methanol include smaller umbilicals, smaller pumps, smaller
storage facilities, and less frequent supply trips.
Other examples of antiagglomerate hydrate inhibitors are tributylhexadecylphos￾phonium bromide, tributylhexadecylammonium bromide, and dibutyldicocoylammo￾nium bromide [65].
A zwitterionic antiagglomerate hydrate inhibitor is shown in Figure 13.27.
Reaction products of amines, for example, (3-dialkylamino)propylamine and
(3-dialkylamino)ethylamine with vegetable oil or tallow oil have been shown to be
antiagglomerate hydrate inhibitors [157]. In addition, several other but related classes
of compounds have been tested.592 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control

13.9.10 GAS HYDRATE INHIBITORS WITH CORROSION INHIBITION
Gas hydrate inhibitors are commonly added together with corrosion inhibitors,
in order to prevent corrosion of the transport and extraction equipment. As a
consequence of the frequent lack of immediate compatibility of the gas hydrate
inhibitor and the corrosion protector in the course of formulation, there is additional
work for the user in preparing the formulation.
Di-N-alkoxylated and carbonylated ammonium salts are excellent as gas hydrate
inhibitors. In addition, their corrosion inhibiting action is so good that no additional
corrosion inhibitors must be added [169]. The basic structures of this type of
compounds is shown in Figure 13.28.
These compounds can be prepared by the reaction of alkoxylated alkyl amines or
alkylaminoalkylenamines with monochlorocarboxylic acids to give the correspond￾ing ether carboxylic acids. Subsequently, these intermediates are esterified with an
alcohol. Alternatively, the bisalkoxylated monoalkyl amines or alkylaminoalkyle￾namines can be reacted directly with carboxylic acids, anhydrides, or acid chlorides.
Finally, a quaternization is performed. The synthesis, exemplified with isobutylamine
is shown in Figure 13.29.

The alkoxylated alkyl amines consist of 2-35 units of EO. Actually, the chain
consists of oligo-ethers. The basic alkyl amines are summarized in Table 13.21. In
addition, the alcohols used for esterification are given, if appropriate.
Examples for the synthesis of a wide variety of these type of compounds are
presented in detail elsewhere [169]. For use as gas hydrate inhibitors, the compounds
are preferably dissolved in alcoholic solvents, such as aqueous monoalcohols, for
example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and also oxyethylated monoalcohols
such as butylglycol, isobutylglycol, butyldiglycol, and polyglycols.
Corrosion protection
Material compatibility with storage tanks, injection tubing, and umbilical tubes for
deep sea applications is a mandatory requirement for chemical products [170]. Many
proposed products fail at the last step of commercialization because of material
compatibility issues. For instance, they are found to cause localized corrosion,
particularly pitting corrosion of stainless and duplex steel. A chemical solution
to overcome this pitting problem in nonmethanol-containing and inorganic halide￾containing solutions was discovered, as described subsequently [170].
The corrosion of metal conduits by hydrate inhibitor formulations, particularly
localized corrosion, can be mitigated when the hydrate inhibitor formulation contains
an effective amount of a hydroxy acid [170]. Suitable hydroxy acids are collected in
Table 13.22 and some are shown in Figure 13.30.
It has been discovered that methanol is not required in the here developed
chemistry for low-dose hydrate inhibitors. Thus, the hydrate inhibitor formulation
does not contain methanol, but may include other alcohol solvents, diol or triol13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 595

solvents, aromatic solvents, and ketone solvents. The amount of corrosion inhibitor in
the total aqueous acidic composition, including water, acid, and corrosion inhibitor,
may range from about 0.01% independently to about 10% [170].
It was reported that the corrosion rates of mild steel with aqueous glycolic acid
solutions are lower than other hydroxy acid solutions [171].
In addition, other optional ingredients for corrosion inhibitors have been de￾scribed. These compounds include quaternary amine compounds or acetylenic
alcohols. Examples of acetylenic compounds that may be optionally used are shown
in Table 13.23 and some are shown in Figure 13.31.
Emulsion-preventing surfactants may also be useful to prevent an adverse
interaction between the hydroxyacid and the reservoir fluids. These surfactants
may be blends of polyglycols, and may be described as containing 2-ethylhexanol,
ethoxyated alcohol, heavy aromatic naphtha, isopropyl alcohol, and methanol [170].
13.9.11 RECYCLABLE ANTIFREEZE AGENTS
It would be economically and ecologically advantageous if the antifreeze agents
could be recycled. Actually a special process that includes the recycling of antifreeze
additives has been developed. Such a process consists of [172]:
1. adding a dispersive additive in a hydrocarbon solution to the fluid to be
transported, so as to form an emulsion;
2. transporting the liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in the presence of water and
the hydrates;
3. separating the gas phase, the hydrocarbon liquid in excess and a liquid
hydrocarbon phase comprising the hydrates and the dispersing additive; and
4. separating the liquid hydrocarbon phase comprising the hydrates and the
dispersing additives.13.9 Inhibition of gas hydrate formation 597

The hydrates are then left behind in a water-in-oil emulsion. The additives remain
being solved in the oil phase. Finally, the water-in-oil emulsion is broken. In this
way, an aqueous phase and a liquid hydrocarbon phase is formed that contains the
additives. This hydrocarbon phase can be reused.
As hydrate inhibitor, oxalkylated amides from fatty acids are used [173].
Carboxylic acid hydroxycarbylamide, substituted or nonsubstituted, such as an
aliphatic or cyclic hydroxycarbylamide or a carboxylic acid monoethanolamide or
diethanolamide containing preferably 3-36 carbon atoms.
The synthesis of these hydroxycarbylamides can be achieved from fatty acids,
esters of these fatty acids, vegetable or animal oils or fats, by reacting these com￾pounds with hydroxycarbylamines such as diethanolamine or monoethanolamine.
What is referred to as hydroxycarbyl is a hydrocarbyl radical substituted by at
least one hydroxy group. The additive can be used together with a conventional
thermodynamic inhibitor such as methanol or the glycols.
13.9.12 DEGRADABLE POLYMER COMPOSITIONS
In addition to medical and veterinary arts, degradable materials also are needed in
industrial applications. For example, vinyl amide-based polymers may serve several
as kinetic gas hydrate inhibitors.598 CHAPTER 13 Gas hydrate control
The formation, persistence, and accumulation of gas hydrates during drilling
and transport operations may result in large pressure drops and extensive cost and
downtime if they impede the fluid transport.
Methods have been developed to address these problems. They can be categorized
into four general areas [174]:
1. water removal from the transport line;
2. thermal approaches to maintain or create a temperature profile inside the
transport line so that gas hydrate formation is unfavorable;
3. antifreeze compounds addition to decrease the gas hydrate crystallization
temperature; and
4. addition of kinetic inhibitors to retard, delay, or slow gas hydrate nucleation
kinetics and retard, delay, or slow their agglomeration after they form.
However, these methods are prone to problems, and, with the exception of
water removal, involve the addition of chemicals that may enter the environment.
Additionally, there may be flammability concerns, for example, the addition of
methanol as a thermodynamic inhibitor, and there is always a demand to minimize
costs.
With the growing sense of environmental awareness, there remains a great need
for materials, including gas hydrate inhibitors that degrade either by chemical,
biological, or other mechanisms.
Polymers have been described that degrade in significantly less time than required
by conventional polymers. Due to these properties, these polymers find application
in many fields.
Novel degradable polymers have been derived from N-vinyl amide and acry￾lamide derivates [174]. N-vinyl-2-caprolactam and hydroxyethyl methacrylate have
been polymerized using tert-amyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate as radical initiator. These
copolymers were then grafted with 3,6-d,l-lactide using tin ethylhexanoate [174].
13.10 HYDRATE INHIBITORS FOR DRILLING FLUIDS
Low-density gas hydrate-suppressive drilling fluids have been developed for deep
water applications. These fluids are glycol-based [175,176].
The formation of hydrate plugs in a drilling fluid is a serious problem in the
oil and gas industry. The interest in the development of green hydrate inhibitors has
increased; these inhibitors can be used as substitutes for available low-dosage hydrate
inhibitors [177].
The effect of porcine pancreatic lipase on the formation of tetrahydrofuran
clathrate hydrate was studied by determining the time for nucleation of hydrate
crystals, that is, the induction time [177].
Pancreatic lipase inhibits the formation of clathrate hydrate and its growth
by adsorbing to different hydrate crystal faces. The ability of pancreatic lipase
to eliminate or extend the memory effect was also studied and compared withReferences 599
poly(vinylpyrrolidone). Pancreatic lipase found to be a better inhibitor than
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and also suppresses the memory effect more efficiently.
The effect of pancreatic lipase on the rheology of drilling fluid was studied
as rheological characteristics of drilling fluid are most crucial for safe drilling
operations. It was found that drilling fluid performs satisfactorily in terms of rheology
at different concentrations of pancreatic lipase. Thus, pancreatic lipase can be
effectively used in drilling fluid as a green hydrate inhibitor [177].

14 Antifreeze agents
An antifreeze is defined as an additive that, when added to a water-based fluid, will
reduce the freezing point of the mixture [1]. Antifreezes are used in mechanical
equipment in environments below the freezing point to prevent the freezing of heat
transfer fluids. Another field of application is in cementing jobs to allow operation
below the freezing point.
Hydrate control is not included in this chapter, but is discussed in Chapter 13,
because of the relative importance and difference in chemical mechanism. Many
chemicals added to water will result in a depression of the freezing point. The
practical application is restricted, however, because of some other unwanted effects,
such as corrosion, destruction of rubber sealings in engine parts, or economic aspects.
14.1 THEORY OF ACTION
Freezing point depression follows the colligative laws of thermodynamics at low
concentrations added to water. At the same time, the boiling point generally will be
increased. The freezing point depression can be readily explained from the theory of
phase equilibria in thermodynamics.
In equilibrium, the chemical potential must be equal in coexisting phases. The
assumption is that the solid phase must consist of one component, water, whereas the
liquid phase will be a mixture of water and salt. So the chemical potential for water
in the solid phase μs is the chemical potential of the pure substance. However, in the
liquid phase, the water is diluted with the salt. Therefore, the chemical potential of
the water in liquid state must be corrected. x refers to the mole fraction of the solute,
that is, salt or an organic substance. The equation is valid for small amounts of salt
or additives in general:
μs = μl + RT ln(1 − x). (14.1)
The equation is best expressed in the following form:
μs − μl
RT = ln (1 − x) ∼= −x. (14.2)

H is the heat of melting of water. Because the heat of melting is always positive,
an increase of solute will result in a depression of the freezing point. For small
freezing point depressions, the temperature on the right-hand side of the equation
is treated as a constant. Furthermore, it is seen that additives with small molecular
weight will be more effective in depressing the freezing point. Once more it should be
noted that the preceding equation is valid only for small amounts of additive. Higher
amounts of additive require modifications of the equation. In particular, the concept
of activity coefficient has to be introduced. The phase diagram over a broader range
of concentration can be explained by this concept.
14.2 ANTIFREEZE CHEMICALS
Some data concerning the activity of antifreeze chemicals are presented in Table 14.1.
Inspection of Table 14.1 shows that there are two different types of antifreeze
chemicals, that is, liquids that are miscible over the full range of concentration with
water and salts, often salts which are soluble only to a certain amount. In the case of
liquids, a mixture of 50% with water is given. In the case of solids, the ethylene glycol
(EG) forms with water an eutectic point between 65% and 80% at around −70 ◦C.

Pure EG will solidify at −14 ◦C, however. Mixtures of propylene glycol with water
can supercool at higher concentrations of propylene glycol. So, the equilibrium
freezing points cannot be measured.
The depression of the freezing point in a mixture of EG and water is shown
in Table 14.2. The phase diagram of the binary system EG-water is plotted in
Figure 14.1. Some organic antifreeze agents are depicted in Figure 14.2.
14.3 HEAT TRANSFER LIQUIDS
The classic antifreeze agents in heat transfer liquids are brine solutions and
alcohols.
14.3.1 BRINES
Of the commonly used antifreeze agents, brines are the most corrosive to metals of
the engines and exhibit scale deposition characteristics that are highly restrictive to
heat transfer. Today brines (sea water) still find applications in offshore uses because
they are cheap.
14.3.2 ALCOHOLS
Alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, are readily available and are occasionally
used despite significant disadvantages, such as low boiling points. During summer
months significant amounts of alcohol can be lost due to evaporation. Such losses
lead to a costly replacement of the additive. Furthermore, alcohols have low flash
points, which may cause safety problems. Moreover, methanol is highly poisonous.
Therefore, the use of alcohols has ceased almost completely in recent years.
14.3.3 GLYCOLS
EG is not as active in depression of the freezing point as methanol, but it has a
very low vapor pressure. Evaporation loss in a coolant system is due more to the
evaporation of water than to the evaporation of EG. Furthermore, the flammability
problem is literally eliminated. 1:1 mixtures of EG and water do not exhibit a flash
point at all. EG-based antifreeze formulations may contain small amounts of other
glycols such as diethylene glycol or triethylene glycol. Propylene-based glycols
such as propylene glycol and propylene glycol ethers have limited use, especially
in areas in which regulations about human toxicity apply. EG proves most effective
in depression of the freezing point and heat transfer activities.14.3 Heat transfer liquids 615
Properties of glycol-based antifreeze formulations
Pour point
The desired concentration of an antifreeze agent will be governed by several features.
The freezing point of a mixture is the point at which the first ice crystal can be
observed. This does not mean, however, that this temperature would be the lowest
allowable temperature in the application. In the case of heat transfer agents, the fluid
will not function efficiently, but because the fluid will not freeze completely to a solid
state it may still be operational. Pure water will expand by complete freezing at about
9%. The addition of antifreeze, such as EG, will significantly lower the amount of
expansion, thus protecting the system from damage. At the freezing temperature, the
crystals are mainly water themselves. Therefore, the concentration of the antifreeze
agent still in the solution will be increased. This causes a further depression of the
freezing point of the residual liquid. At higher glycol concentrations the fluid never
solidifies completely. The fluid becomes thick and taffy like. The point at which the
fluid ceases to flow is referred to as the pour point. The pour point is significantly
lower than the freezing point. However, the use of such a system down to the
pour point will significantly increase the energy required for pumping. Furthermore,
because of the decreased ability for heat transfer, it is generally not recommended to
regularly use systems beyond the freezing point of the mixture.
Corrosion
Alcohols may be corrosive to some aluminum alloys. In an aqueous mixture,
corrosion may still occur because of dissolved ions from residual salts. At high
temperatures and in the presence of residual oxygen from the air, glycols are oxidized
slowly to the corresponding acids. These acids can corrode metals.
The inhibition of acid corrosion can be achieved by adding buffer systems that
essentially keep the pH constant and neutralize the acids. For example, a formulation
of 100 kg EG with 400 g KH2PO4, 475 g Na2HPO4, and 4 l of water is used as
an antifreezing agent, which can be diluted accordingly with water, approximately
50:50. This formulation will be highly anticorrosive. Also, borax can be used to
protect metal surfaces from corrosion.
Besides of pure chemical corrosion, solid products of corrosion in the system will
give rise to erosive corrosion, in which the particles moving with the fluid will impact
onto the surfaces and can remove protective surface layers. Such corrosion effects are
most pronounced in regions of high fluid-stream velocity.
The most common corrosion inhibitors, which may form protective films on
the metal surfaces, are borates, molybdates, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, sili￾cates, amines, triazoles, and thiazioles, for example, monoethanolamine, urotropin,
thiodiglycol, and mercaptobenzothiazole. The addition of such inhibitors does not
effectively protect against corrosion [2]. Some corrosion inhibitors are shown in
Figure 14.3.
Dibasic salts of dicyclopentadiene dicarboxylic acid are claimed to be active
as corrosion inhibitors [3]. Certain salts of fatty acids (metal soaps), together with616 CHAPTER 14 Antifreeze agents

benzotriazole, are claimed to give synergistic effects for corrosion in antifreeze agent
formulations [4].
The choice of a corrosion inhibitor as an additive in antifreezing agents is also
dependent on the mode of operation. For instance, cars are operated intermittently.
Here the corrosion inhibitors must also protect the system when it is idle. Film
forming silicates can protect the system while idle. This is especially true of
aluminum parts, which are introduced in cars for the sake of weight reduction. But
silicones can react with EG to form cross-linked polymers. These gels may clog lines.
The engines in the oil industry are usually heavy stationary diesels that run
continuously. Also, aluminum is normally not used in this type of engine. For
these types of engines, corrosion inhibitors for glycol systems based on silicate￾forming films are not recommended, because of gel formation. Appropriate blends
of corrosion inhibitors added to the glycol-water mixture to minimize corrosion
problems in applications for coolants have been developed [5].
Therefore, coolant formulations for engines involved in natural gas transmission
consist of phosphate for ferrous metal protection and a triazole for the protection of
brass parts. Corrosion is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
Foam inhibitors
Although glycol-water formulations are not prone to foaming, mechanical and
chemical factors may cause foaming in the system. The use of corrosion inhibitors
and the presence of contaminants may enhance the tendency to form foams. For these
reasons, antifoaming agents, such as silicones, polyglycols, or oils, are sometimes
added.14.3 Heat transfer liquids 617

Damage of elastomers
Some elastomer sealings that are in contact with the antifreeze mixture may not be
stable in such a medium because of consequences such as swelling. The compatibility
of EG with certain plastics is shown in Table 14.3.
14.3.4 TOXICITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
Human toxicity and aquatic toxicity have been measured typically with fresh
formulations only. Spent fluids may contain various contaminants and degradation
products that may change the toxic effects.
Human toxicity
The toxicity of antifreeze agents is mainly due to the main ingredient, EG. It is often
believed that glycols are healthy to the skin, because the compounds are related
to glycerol. This is completely wrong, because the degradation metabolism (i.e.,
catabolism) is completely different due to a difference of a single carbon atom.
EG is acutely toxic to humans and animals if ingested. EG is defined as an animal
teratogenic. Propylene glycol has not shown teratogenic effects, and the oral toxicity
is lower. On the other hand, propylene glycol is more irritating to the skin than EG.
Aquatic toxicity
The aquatic toxicity of antifreeze agents is not strictly a function of the main com￾ponent. Aquatic toxicity may come also from minor components in the formulation.
Both EG and propylene glycol are believed to be essentially nontoxic for aquatic life.
Biodegradation
Laboratory tests of EG containing formulations have shown a complete biooxidation
within 20 days. The rate of biooxidation is stationary over the full period. On the
other hand, propylene glycol initially degrades more rapidly during the first 5 days of
the test to an extent of 62%, slowing to 79% conversion after 20 days. The mechanism
of oxidation of EG is shown in Figure 14.4.618 CHAPTER 14 Antifreeze agents

Recycling
Recycling is achieved either by simply filtering or by redistillation. In the case of
filtering, only deposits are removed. There is essentially no information concerning
the activity of other additives as corrosion inhibitors. Redistillation is more effective
because this process recovers the glycol in high quality, although it is more
complicated and cost intensive than filtering. The refined glycol must be re-inhibited
before use.
Spent antifreeze formulations can be purified before recycling. If the antifreeze
agent is kept separate from waste oils, it can be easily treated and recycled into a new
product.
14.4 SPECIAL USES
14.4.1 HYDRAULIC CEMENT ADDITIVES
Antifreezing agents for cement consist mainly of salts such as calcium chloride,
magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, and soda. Calcium chloride is highly corrosive
and very restricted in use. Some salts, especially potassium chloride, will affect the
curing time of cement. The latter chemical is in fact used to increase the pot life
of cement. Likewise, alcohol freezing point depressants, such as EG, can be also
included in the composition [6].
14.4.2 PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION OF AQUEOUS EMULSIONS OF OIL
Mixtures of aqueous emulsions of oil can be more effectively transported through
pipelines if certain antifreeze formulations are added to the system. Stable oil￾in-water emulsions for pipeline transmission by using 0.05-4% ethoxylated alkyl
phenol as an emulsifier and a freezing point depressant for water enable pipeline
transmission at temperatures below the freezing point of water [7].
Highly viscous petroleum oil containing 30-80% water can be transported
through pipes more efficiently when a 1:1 mixture of washing liquid and antifreeze
(i.e., EG with borax) is added to the oil in amounts of 0.002-0.2%. In addition to the
increased efficiency of transport, a reduced corrosion of pipes can be achieved [8].References 619
14.4.3 LOW TEMPERATURE DRILLING FLUIDS
Antifreeze agents are occasionally added to reduce the freezing point of the drilling
fluid itself [9,10]. Such a water-based drilling fluid is composed of water, clay or
polymer, and a polymeric glycerol.
More recently, for low temperature drilling, antifreeze agents, such as
poly(vinylpyrrolidone), quaternary ammonium salts, or antifreeze fish proteins have
been proposed [11].

15 Odorization
The hazards of odorless combustible gases were possibly first realized by miners.
The idea of odorization of combustible gases results from Julius Quaglio in 1880,
who was engaged in various aspects of water gas [1]. The gas produced at that time
contained already impurities that caused the typical odor of gas. Later the gas was
obtained in such a purity that dangers emerged in handling. Some aspects concerning
the history of this issue are given in the literature [2]. The primary objective of gas
odorization is safety. Odorization serves as a warning in the detection of natural gas
in air before it reaches combustible levels. Naturally, odorization is a part of the risk
management for pipelines of natural gas [3].
Certain federal pipeline safety regulations, including the national fire protection
association (United States), require that combustible gases in pipelines be detectable
at one-fifth of the lower explosive limit by a person with a normal sense of smell,
either by the natural odor of the gas or by means of artificial odorization [4].
Therefore, the proper odorization and odorants are integral parts of safety [5,6].
Odorization is a primary concern for any gas transmission company [5,7].
Accurate injection of the odorant, proper monitoring techniques, and complete
record maintenance are important factors in developing and sustaining a successful
odorization program.
A review has been presented concerning the aspects of odorization. Important
points to consider are which pipelines require odorization, the detectable limits of
gas odor, odorants, and odorizing considerations, and monitoring a pipeline system
to ensure that the odorization program is meeting the regulatory requirements [4].
15.1 GENERAL ASPECTS
15.1.1 LIMITS OF EXPLOSION
The lower explosion limits of certain gases are shown in Table 15.1.
The data in Table 15.1 are approximate data for ordinary air. There is also an
upper limit of explosion. The limits of explosion are dependent on the oxygen content
which is of course constant for ordinary air. However, the limits of explosion are
dependent on the total pressure [8]. There are mathematical models in order to
calculate the limits of explosion [9].
For example, the Software GasEq® and some additional software has been used
to calculate the flammability limits of mixtures with, for example, ethylene oxide

between 0.4 and 1.0 bar.
GasEq® is a Microsoft Windows-based program with a Microsoft Excel inter￾face. The program can be used to calculate the equilibrium of combustion. The
software is intended primarily for gas phase calculations, although there is a limited
facility for condensed phases, such as soot [10].
15.1.2 DESIRABLE PROPERTIES OF ODORANTS
An ideal odorant should have the following desirable physical and functional
properties [11]:
• low perceptual threshold;
• preferably distinguishable from smells in daily life and functionable as a
warning smell;
• low boiling point (essential for hydrogen gas);
• low corrosivity;
• little or no olfactory fatigue; and
• low toxicity.
Odorants should allow the detection of leakages without any external equipment.
The end user needs not to worry in maintaining any measuring equipment. Thus,
equipment failures cannot cause not to detect leaks. Consequently, odorants allow
the detection of leaks in places where it may be difficult to position detectors. In
addition, odorants can be used in small concentrations because of the sensitivity of
the human olfactory system [12].
Furthermore, a fuel-gas odorant should be easily distinguishable from smells in
daily life. Thus, it is desirably suitable as a warning smell. Smells in daily life mean
ordinary smells that are experienced in daily life situations and are not perceived as
a foreign or unusual odor.
On the other hand, a warning smell is in general an unpleasant smell that is
perceived as an odor indicating unusual situations, clearly distinguishable from the
smells in daily life. In this way, the smell acts as a warning signal [11].15.2 Measurement and odor monitoring 623
15.2 MEASUREMENT AND ODOR MONITORING
The methods of odor monitoring are reviewed by Klusmann [13] and Wetteman and
Wilson [14].
In the early days of the coal mining industry, open flames were taken into
the mine. When the candle started burning irregularly, a possible danger of a
near explosion could be realized. However, often this technique indicated a danger
too late. A significant progress was the invention of the safety lamp in 1815, by
Sir Humphry Davy. The presence of combustible gases could be still detected, but
the explosion reaction was restricted inside the wired cage of the safety lamp.
Another method of monitoring utilized the extraordinary sensitivity of canary
birds to methane. Canary birds were accompanying the miners into the mines,
admittedly involuntary in small cages. The canary stops singing in the presence of
even small amounts of coal gas, and dies eventually at higher levels that are still
harmless for the human body [12].
By the addition of odorants to liquid petroleum gas and natural gas an improved
level of safety is reached. However, the use of odorants suffers from certain
limitations and disadvantages. Namely, for an odor to be detected, a human being
must be in the vicinity of the leak in order to detect the odor. A further drawback is
that not each individual is able to detect the odors at the same mandatory level. Most
dangerous is that some individuals are not able detect the odor at all.
For example, the sensitivity of an individual may be affected by a seasonal illness,
such as influenza or sniffle. Further, the exposure to other odors lowers the sensitivity
at all and also during sleep time the olfactory response decreases.
15.2.1 OLFACTORIC RESPONSE
Odorants are chemicals that stimulate the olfactoric sense. The human olfactory
system is much less sensitive in comparison to other animals, such as dogs, which are
notorious for their ability of smelling. Nevertheless, the human being can still detect
certain odorants in concentrations in the air in the ppt range (parts per trillion).
There are several definitions to quantify the odor. The threshold odor concen￾tration is the absolute perception threshold at which a substance can be barely
identified; however, the impression is too faint. The odor recognition threshold is
the concentration at which the sensation indicates a representative odor for a certain
substance [15].
There is a difference between the minimum detectable concentration level and the
minimum identifiable concentration. The minimum concentration that is detectable
is defined as the lowest concentration at that 50% of the human population are able
to smell something. This concentration is sometimes addressed as the perceptual
threshold or odor recognition threshold.
In contrast, the recognition threshold is the minimum concentration at that a
certain predefined percentage of the people can identify the substance coarsely. At
the detection and recognition thresholds there will be a large number of individuals624 CHAPTER 15 Odorization
who do not detect or recognize the odor. The data indicate as a rule of the thumb
that the recognition threshold is roughly by a factor of 10 higher than the detection
threshold [12].
Perceptual threshold and olfactoric intensity
The perceptual threshold of an odorant means the minimum concentration of the
odorant in the air, expressed in ppm, etc., at which a human being can easily notice
the smell of the odorant. In general, these values refer to ratios of volume and not to
ratios of weight, as usual in gas analysis.
This threshold value can be determined by a couple panelists who assess the
olfactory intensity of a test substance in an odorless chamber. The air in the chamber
is stirred until the concentration of the test substance becomes constant and is then
left to stand. The olfactory intensity is assessed, for example, on a scale of 0 to 5 for
smell pollution. The perceptual and recognition thresholds of selected chemicals are
summarized in Table 15.2. The olfactoric response of humans, males and females
between the ages of 16 and 82 years, was tested with various odorants, including tert￾butylmercaptan, thiophene, ethylmercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, isopropylmercaptan,
and mixtures of these odorants.
The goal was to establish the warning levels below the explosion limit in the
event of a gas leak [17]. The study suggests that ethylmercaptan is the most suitable
odorant. Trained dogs can detect odorizing agents in concentrations as small as
10-18 ppb [18–20].
Odor index
The odor index (OI) is the ratio of the vapor pressure to the odor recognition threshold
[15, p. 13].
OI = Vapor pressure (ppm)
Recognition threshold (ppm)
. (15.1)
Thus, the OI is a dimensionless number. Thus, an OI less than 1 means that the
substance has a vapor pressure that is too small that the substance can be smelled.
Olfactory power
There is still another definition of the intensity of a certain smell, namely, the
olfactory power [21]. The olfactory power is defined as the negative decadic
logarithm of the detection threshold. Olfactory power tables are given in Table 15.3.
15.2.2 PHYSIOLOGICAL METHODS
An exemplary specific method for determining the perceptual threshold is as follows.
A test odorant in a dish is left in an odorless chamber for a given period of time.
After agitation of the air in the odorless chamber until the concentration of the
test substance becomes constant followed by standing for 1 min, panelists enter the
chamber and assess the olfactory intensity on a scale of 0 to 5.15.2 Measurement and odor monitoring 625

This procedure is repeated at different concentrations of the test odorant. A per￾ceptual threshold of the test odorant can be obtained by determining the concentration
of the odorant corresponding to the olfactory intensity of 2, at which the smell can
easily be identified as described below. The olfactory intensity is assessed on a scale
of 0 to 5 [11]:
0: odorless;
1: slight smell, but not identified;
2: easily noticed and can be identified;
3: obvious smell;
4: strong smell; and
5: intolerably strong smell.626 CHAPTER 15 Odorization

Triangle odor bag method
The measurement of the odor threshold by the triangle odor bag method has been
described in detail [22]. The data were collected over a comparatively long period of
time, that is, from 1976 to 1988. Totally, 223 substances were tested in this study.
In this study, isoamylmercaptan exhibited the lowest threshold of 0.77 ppt
and propane exhibited the highest threshold of 1500 ppm. The distribution of the
thresholds of the substances investigated follow a Gaussian normal distribution. As
expected in common sense, it was established that sulfur compounds apart from
sulfur dioxide and carbon disulfide exhibit a comparatively low threshold.
There is a relation between the molecular weight of the substance and its
odor threshold. There is a great difference in the thresholds between isomers.15.2 Measurement and odor monitoring 627

in Table 15.4, selected odor thresholds measured by the triangle odor bag method are
reproduced.
Observe that the values presented in Table 15.4 are differing in some cases
appreciably from those given in Table 15.2. This may be caused by the different
methods used in the acquisition. Actually, in the study, repeated tests for the
same substances were carried out to some extent. Within these tests a considerable
variation was reported.
Standardized methods
Sensory thresholds have been established in order to determine the potential of
substances at low concentrations to impart odor, taste, haptic, etc., to some form
of matter [23].
Procedures for referencing the odor intensities of odorous materials have been
standardized. The so-called ASTM Odor Intensity Referencing Scale has been
developed [24]. This scale is a geometric progression scale.
Reference odorant vapors are be presented for the evaluation by a panel of at least
eight independent judgments. The test relies on comparing the odor intensity of the628 CHAPTER 15 Odorization
sample to the odor intensities of a series of concentrations of a reference odorant,
which is n-butanol.
Two methods that creates the smell are in use. In the dynamic scale method, a
dynamic-dilution apparatus is used, which is equipped with a series of sniffing ports
from which constant concentrations of 1-butanol emerge at constant volumetric flow
rates in air. In the static-scale method, a series of Erlenmeyer flasks containing known
concentrations of n-butanol dissolved in water is used.
15.2.3 CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METHODS
Chromatographic and spectroscopic methods
The concentration of odorants in gases can be measured by the absorbance in the
ultraviolet region [25,26]. The absorbance of odorized gas is much higher than the
absorbance of untreated gas.
An integrated natural gas pipeline leak detector based on diode laser absorption
spectroscopy has been developed [27]. The detector is based on near infrared diode
laser absorption spectroscopy, wavelength modulation spectroscopy, and harmonic
detection. Direct absorption spectroscopy has the drawback of low sensitivity.
It is difficult to detect a small flux pipeline leak of natural gas. Therefore, in order
to improve the sensitivity, the second harmonic signal is used in a modulated wave.
The method accesses directly the response of methane, so basically, the presence of
an odorant is immaterial.
Gas chromatography with an electrochemical detector is also suitable [28] for
analysis of mercaptans. Portable gas chromatographic equipments for the measure￾ment and analysis of odorants in gas distribution networks are available.
Besides applications in the field of petroleum, the analysis and characterization
of odorants plays an important role in the food industries as well in perfumes.
Remarkably enough, the sensitivity of an analytical instrument, for example, a mass
spectrometer and the sensitivity of the human nose do not correlate at all. Substances
with an intense smell may cause only a small mass spectrometric peak and vice versa.
Colorimetric methods
A classical analysis of traces of gases consists in colorimetric methods. These method
was originally invented by the Dräger company in Lübeck, Germany. A test tube
consist of a thin glass tube that is closed on both ends by melting the glass. Inside the
tube, an indicator is placed that reacts with the substance to be analyzed in a change
of the color.
At probing, the molten ends of the glass tube are broken and a known amount of
gas is sucked through the test tube. Depending on the concentration of the gaseous
impurity under consideration a certain distance becomes colored. On the tube itself,
a scale is printed so that the concentration of the respective impurity can be read out
directly in ppm, provided the correct volume of gas has been sucked before.15.3 Additives for odorization 629
Electronic nose
The term electronic nose was created around the late 1980s [29]. The principle of the
electronic nose is based on a chemical sensor [30]. A chemical sensor is a device that
converts chemical information into an analytically useful signal.
Chemical sensors are important for a variety of industrial and environmental
applications, including the detection of hazardous chemicals, quality control in the
food, perfume, and beverage industries, and medical applications [31]. These types
of sensors include a sorbent layer deposited on an active area of a signal transducer.
Chemicals sensors have been described that are, among others, potentially
suitable for the detection of natural gas [32,33]. For example, conducting poly(pyrrol)
films have been found useful for the detection of methane. The sensitivity of a
poly(pyrrol) film is dependent on the CH4 concentration and the pressure.
Nanocomposites based on iron oxide and poly(pyrrol) have been used for sensing
various gases [34]. It has been pointed out that these composites can be used for the
sensing of methane in oil fields, natural gas pipelines and joints, and waste water
treatment plants [32].
Commercial metal oxide-based gas sensors that are specifically sensitive to
methane are available. They are recommended as sensors for domestic gas alarms
for the detection of methane [35].
On the other hand, sensor systems have been described for the detection of
water traces in natural gas [36]. The principles operate by the change of the electric
capacitance by the presence of water vapor.
15.3 ADDITIVES FOR ODORIZATION
15.3.1 SULFUR COMPOUNDS
Because of their inherent penetrating smell, certain organic sulfur compounds are
used for odorization. Repellents from the skunk contain compounds such as trans-2-
butene-1-thiol and 3-methyl-1-butanethiol. Ethylmercaptan, because of its extremely
low odor threshold, is the favorite compound used as an odorant in natural gas and
liquid propane for leak detection. Tetrahydrothiophene is also often used. Common
odorization reagents are summarized in Table 15.5 and Figures 15.1 and 15.2.
tert-Butylmercaptan is very common in a single component odorization method.
It has a good soil penetration and a high resistance to oxidation. A drawback is the
high freezing point of tert-butylmercaptan that suggests to use it in mixtures with
other components.
Isopropylmercaptan has a strong odor and also a good resistance to oxidation. It
is usually blended with tert-butylmercaptan to depress the freezing point of the latter
compound [2].
Alkyl sulfides are resistant to oxidation. However, they do not have such as strong
odor than the mercaptans. Therefore, they are used as stand-alone odorants. They are630 CHAPTER 15 Odorization

added primarily to lower the freezing point of mercaptans. Actually, the common
odorant blends fall into one the following main categories [2]:
1. mercaptan blends;
2. mercaptan—alkyl sulfide blends; and
3. tetrahydrothiophene—mercaptan blends.
Thermodynamic properties of odorants
The effectiveness of an odorant depends on the partition coefficients and the
solubility. Vapor-liquid equilibria data for sulfur compounds in liquefied natural gas
are available [48,49].
Structure property relationships
The power of odor depends on certain properties of the respective molecule.
A number of structure-odor relationships concerning odor intensity and odor quality
have been established [50]. Statistical methods are employed to classify the various
odorants.
15.3.2 OTHER COMPOUNDS
Sulfur-containing compounds are widely known as odorants used for fuel gases,
but have problems in that they usually generate sulfur dioxide when the fuel gases
are burned. In addition, when the fuel gases are used in fuel cells, which are being
developed, a desulfurizer must be installed to remove odorant components that would
cause catalyst poisoning [11].
Attempts have been undertaken to provide sulfur-free gas odorizing composi￾tions. These compounds include alkyl acrylates, vinyl or alkyl ethers, n-valeric acid,
ethyl acrylate, cyclohexene, and norbornene derivatives [51].
However, these odorants have certain disadvantages. For example, acrylic ester
odorants are chemically unstable. The content of cyclohexene or ethylidene nor￾bornene must be larger than those of mercaptans [11].
On the other hand, nitrogen-containing odorants may cause the enhanced forma￾tion of nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides are toxic and react with sunlight to form
ozone.
Among the alcohol suitable as odorants, geosmin is a preferred compound.
Geosmin means actually earth smell. It is a naturally occurring organic compound,
which is produced by microoragnisms. The human nose is extremely sensitive to
geosmin. Another name for geosmin is 2,6-dimethylbicyclo[4.4.0]decan-1-ol. The
structures of geosmin and other sulfur-free odorants are shown in Figure 15.3.
In addition, trans-2-trans-4-decadienal has a low perceptual threshold [11].
Mixtures of acrylates and pyrazines have been proposed as sulfur-free odorants
[51]. To protect against undesired oxidation, the odorizing compositions may
comprise antioxidants, for example, butylhydroxyanisole, ionol, that is, tert-butyl
hydroxytoluene, hydroquinone monomethyl ether, and α-tocopherol. Antioxidants
are shown in Figure 15.4.632 CHAPTER 15 Odorization

Sulfur-free odorants are shown in Table 15.6.
Commercial sulfur-free odorants (or compositions with reduced sulfur content)
include a mixture of ethyl acrylate and methyl acrylate (Gasodor S Free™) and a
mixture of ethyl acrylate and tetrahydrothiophen (Spotleak Z ) [54].
Sulfur-free odorants are discussed controversially. Actually they can be readily
smelled, however, the smell resembles rather to garlic. Therefore, the human common
sense does not associate this type of smell with the typical smell of combustible gas,
because the citizen is accustomed to the mercaptan smell.
Some cities have changed their odorant in the natural gas pipelines to sulfur-free
odorants. There are reports of good success [55]. However, some cities turned back
to the conventional sulfur-based odorants.
The behavior of Gasodor S Free™ during reforming of methane that has been
odorized with just this odorant has been tested with respect to the application of
methane in fuel gas systems. It has been verified that the odorization with Gasodor
S Free™ would not have a negative impact on the subsequent use in fuel gas
systems [56].
15.4 INDUSTRIAL SYNTHESIS OF ODORANTS
The chemistry of thiols has been reviewed by Roberts [57]. Ethylmercaptan is readily
formed by the reaction of ethyl bromide with hydrogen sulfide. Further, mercaptans
can be produced by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide and an olefin in the presence of a
catalyst. Ethylmercaptan can be prepared by reaction of pure ethylene and hydrogen
sulfide without creating a problem for separation because the desired mercaptan is
the only mercaptan product. Basic reactions are
CH3−CH2−Br + H2S → CH3−CH2−SH + HBr (15.2)
and
CH2 = CH2 + H2S → CH3−CH2−SH. (15.3)634 CHAPTER 15 Odorization
However, where the reaction mixture comprises more than one olefin such as
ethylene and propylene, it is likely to produce both ethylmercaptan and propylmer￾captans resulting in separation difficulty, because these mercaptans cannot be easily
separated by distillation, extraction, filtration, and membrane diffusion. However, the
selective production of ethylmercaptan from a fuel gas mixture can be achieved by
special catalysts, that is, in the presence of oxides of cobalt and molybdenum [58].
Mercaptans and sulfides can be selectively produced from alcohols. The alcohol
is reacted with hydrogen sulfide, in the presence of a catalyst blend. The alcohols can
include primary and secondary alcohols [59]. The reaction is of the type electrophilic
substitution.
R−OH + H2S → R−SH + H2O. (15.4)
In addition, mercaptans are formed by the reaction of sulfides with hydrogen sulfide:
R−S−R + H2S → 2R−SH. (15.5)
15.5 USES AND PROPERTIES
15.5.1 ODORANT INJECTION TECHNIQUES
Odorants are typically provided in liquid form and are added to the gas at a location
where distribution gas is taken from a main gas pipeline and provided to a distribution
pipeline. In such circumstances, the gas pressure may be stepped down through
a regulator to a lower pressure. The odorants which are added to natural gas are
extremely concentrated. Odorants such as tert-butylmercaptan and other blends are
mildly corrosive and are also very noxious.
If a leak of odorant would occur at an injection site, people in the surrounding
area will assume that a gas leak has occurred with areas being evacuated and
commerce being interrupted. Contrarily, if such mistakes become common, people
in the surrounding area will become desensitized to the smell of a potential gas leak
and will fail to report legitimate leaks.
Two techniques are commonly used for providing odorization to natural gas in a
main distribution pipeline. The first technique involves the injection of liquid odorant
directly into the pipeline. A high pressure injection pump pumps the odorant from a
liquid storage tank into a small pipe which empties directly into the main gas pipeline.
Because odorant is extremely volatile, drops injected to the pipeline immediately
disperse and spread throughout the gas in the pipeline. In this way, within a few
seconds, the drops of liquid odorant are dispersed in gaseous form [60].
The flow of gas in the pipeline is typically metered so that liquid odorant can be
injected periodically. For example, a few drops of odorant will suffice for a 30 m3
flow of natural gas. When the gas flow meter indicates that such amount of natural gas
has been flown through the pipe, the corresponding previously determined amount of15.5 Uses and properties 635
liquid odorant is injected into the pipeline. As another indicated amount of gas flows
past the injection site, another injection of odorant is performed.
Even though the injection is performed on a periodic basis, the odorant diffusion
within the gas provides for adequate levels of odorant throughout the pipeline,
assuming the time between injections is not too great.
Another technique for odorizing a natural gas pipeline involves bypassing a
small amount of natural gas at a slightly higher pressure than the pressure of the
main distribution pipeline, through a tank containing a liquid odorant. This bypass
gas absorbs relatively high concentrations of odorant while it is in the tank. This
heavily odorized bypass gas is then placed back into the main pipeline. The odorant,
now volatlized, is placed back into the main pipeline and diffuses throughout the
pipeline in much the same manner as described with respect to the liquid injection
system [61].
Still another method for odorizing natural gas flowing through a pipeline is the
injection of the odorant into the pipeline at a controlled rate. The system includes
an odorant storage tank containing an odorant to be injected. A pressurized source
of inert gas, such as nitrogen, communicates with the odorant storage tank for
maintaining the tank at a desired positive pressure above the pressure of the natural
gas pipeline. An injection conduit communicates the odorant storage tank with the
pipeline. A photooptic metering means, located within the injection conduit, meters
odorant to be injected into the pipeline [62].
In a still further improved technique, the chemical is metered on a drop wise
basis with individual drops of the chemical being counted as they pass through a
measuring unit into the injection conduit and into the pipeline. The measuring unit
includes ultrasonic transmitters and receivers, which act as either proximity sensors
or by measuring transit time to provide a measurement of the flow rate of the odorant
either on a drop basis or in a steady-state flow condition.
Alternatively, liquid drops land on the diaphragm of a piezoelectric sensor and
thereby generate sound waves. The sound waves are transmitted to an associated
crystal which, in turn, generates a proportional electric charge, which results in
a voltage difference between two electrodes. The resulting voltage spikes can be
counted and measured [63].
15.5.2 LEAK DETECTION
Leaks in pipelines can be detected by means of a test fluid. The test fluid, a mixture
of dimethyl sulfide in solvent, is injected into a pipeline. In the case of a leak,
the test fluid escapes through the leak, and the odorant is released from the closed
compartments [64,65].
15.5.3 FUEL CELLS
With the advent of fuels cells based on hydrogen, odorization has become an issue in
the odorization of hydrogen [12]. Here another problem emerges, as odorants for fuel636 CHAPTER 15 Odorization
cell systems, as common odorants may have negative impacts on the performance of
the fuel cells.
Commercial odorants used in gas leak detection act as poisons for the catalysts
used in hydrogen-based fuel cells, most specifically for proton exchange membrane
fuel cells. Chemical compounds based on mixtures of acrylic acid and nitrogen
compounds have been adopted to achieve a sulfur-free odorization of a gas [66].
In the use of natural gas and other petroleum gases for hydrogen generation
for fuel cell applications, sulfur-free natural or petroleum gases are needed, or else
a desulfurization step must be incorporated in the reforming process, which adds
further cost to hydrogen generation.
Fuel cells are sulfur intolerant because sulfur compounds poison the noble metal
catalysts used in these fuel cells. If sulfur-containing odorants are used, it would be
necessary to remove sulfur-containing materials, like mercaptan odorants, from the
feed gas using materials like zinc oxide. However, some sulfur-containing materials,
like thiophenes, cannot be removed by zinc oxide and may require a specific
hydrodesulfurization process, using hydrogen gas, to remove sulfur.
A further complexity for hydrogen fuel comes from the nature of the hydrogen
flame propagation. When gases burn in air, their flames propagate upwards with
greater ease than they propagate downwards. This is primarily due to the natural
convection of hot burnt gases in an upward direction. For petroleum gases, propane
and methane, the upward and downward propagating lean limits of combustion are
approximately the same.
However, for hydrogen, since they differ by a factor of 2.5, the amount of odorant
needed for leak detection in hydrogen could be >2.5 times that needed for methane
or propane. The higher quantity of the odorant needed for hydrogen odor detection
further complicates the sulfur poisoning problems for hydrogen gas used in fuel
cells [66].
15.5.4 ODOR-FADING
One specific problem of odorization is odor-fading. The gas may be satisfactorily
odorized at the source, but if it no longer has the necessary odor impact and intensity
by the time it reaches the customer, escaping gas can remain undetected and result in
a serious fire or explosion hazard [2]. Basically three causes for fading may arise [2]:
1. oxidation, the formation of disulfides in the presence of iron oxide and oxygen
traces;
2. new pipe materials may cause adsorption or absorption of the odorant on the
surface of a plastic pipe; and
3. gas quality problems may cause masking, or reaction of odorant components
with impurities in the gas stream.
The presence of rust and air within a pipeline may act as a catalyst for the
oxidation of mercaptans. This results in compounds that do not smell at all. On the
other hand, sulfide components are much more resistant to oxidation.References 637
Dry gas is easiest to odorize and does not cause odor fade. Condensed liquids in
the pipeline may absorb components of the odorant. Odor masking may also occur
due to the odor imparted by any impurities present in the gas.
Odor-fading from odorized liquefied petroleum gas stored in carbon steel con￾tainers can occur by catalytic effects of the containers. To postpone this effect, the
respective steel surfaces can be deactivated by treating the surface with a deactivating
agent [67] before exposing the walls to the liquefied petroleum gas containing the
odorizer.
Examples of such deactivating agents are benzotriazole, tolyl triazole, mercap￾tobenzothiazole, benzothiazyl disulfide, or mixtures of these compounds [68]. It
has been suggested that a mathematical model and adequate software should be
developed to predict the odorant fade [69].
15.5.5 ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS
If natural gas for storage in natural reservoirs is odorized with sulfur compounds,
then a possible environmental impact can result. Some of the odorant is lost in
the formation [70]. If the loss occurs in a reservoir adjacent to an aquifer, it could
contaminate the water and cause environmental problems. When gas is drawn off,
water is also often injected into the reservoir. A case was described in which the
respective water had a strong characteristic odor [71]. A stripping column has been
recommended to overcome this problem.
Contaminated ground water can also be decontaminated by the reaction with
iron [72]. This technique was proposed to remedy ground water contaminated with
ethylmercaptan in situ. Studies suggest chemical reactions with iron rather than an
irreversible surface adsorption. Gas odorizers can be removed by extraction, similar
to the usual glycol dehydration and desulfurization process [73,74].
Another cleaning process for the removal of tetrahydrothiophene process uses
an advanced oxidation technique, consisting of water treatment by UV-radiation in
combination with a dosage of hydrogen peroxide [75]. It is possible to keep the
concentrations of odorant and condensate in the effluent below 0.1 ppb.

16 Enhanced oil recovery
Approximately 60-70% of the oil in place cannot be produced by conventional meth￾ods [1]. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods gain importance in particular with
respect to the limited worldwide resources of crude oil. The estimated worldwide
production from EOR projects and heavy-oil projects at the beginning of 1996 was
approximately 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd).
This is approximately 3.6% of the world’s oil production. At the beginning of
1994, the production had been 1.9 million bpd [2]. Some production data by EOR
are summarized in Table 16.1.
EOR processes include chemical and gas floods, steam, combustion, and electric
heating. Gas floods, including immiscible and miscible processes, are usually defined
by injected fluids (carbon dioxide, flue gas, nitrogen, or hydrocarbon). Steam projects
involve cyclic steam (huff and puff) or steam drive. Combustion technologies can
be subdivided into those that autoignite and those that require a heat source at
injectors [5].
Chemical floods are identified by the specific chemical that is injected. The most
common processes are polymers, surfactants, and alkalis, but chemicals are often
combined. For example, polymer slugs usually follow surfactant or alkaline slugs to
improve the sweep efficiency. Injection of materials that plug permeable channels
may be required for injection profile control and to prevent or mitigate premature
water or gas breakthrough.
enlargethispage*6pt
Crosslinked or gelled polymers are pumped into injectors or producers for water
shutoff or fluid diversion. Cement squeezes can often effectively fix near wellbore
water channeling problems. The design of chemical injection-EOR projects can be
more complicated than that of waterflood projects. Downhole conditions are more
severe than are those for primary or secondary recovery production.
Well injectivity is complicated by chemicals in injected waters, so in addition
to precautions used in waterfloods, chemical interactions, reduced injectivity, dele￾terious mixtures at producers, potential for accelerated corrosion, and possible well
stimulations to cause reduced injectivity must be considered [6]. Monographs on
EOR technologies are available [7–10].
Low-salinity water injection models
Only a few low-salinity water injection models have been proposed for carbonate
rocks, mainly because of incomplete understanding of complex chemical interactions
of rock, oil, and brine.

An empirical method to model the low-salinity water injection effect on oil
recovery from carbonate rocks, on the basis of the history matching and validation of
recently published corefloods has been presented [11].
In this model, the changes in the oil relative permeability curve and residual oil
saturation (ROS) as a result of the low-salinity water injection effect are considered.
The water relative permeability parameters are assumed to be constant, which is a
relatively fair assumption on the basis of history matching of coreflood data. The
capillary pressure is neglected because it was assumed that capillary pressure curves
in our simulations had a negligible effect on the history-match results.
The developed model gives more insight into the oil-production potential of future
waterflood projects with a modified water composition for injection [11].
16.1 WATERFLOODING
The surfactants described or characterized for waterflooding are summarized in
Table 16.2. Commercial alkene sulfonates are a mixture of alkene sulfonate, hydrox￾yalkane sulfonate, and olefin disulfonate [12].
16.1.1 SURFACTANTS
The recent advances in surfactant-EOR have been reviewed [41].
The addition of alkali to surfactant flooding in the 1980s reduced the amount of
surfactant required, and the process became known as alkaline surfactant polymer
(ASP) flooding.
It has been found that the adsorption of anionic surfactants on calcite and
dolomite can also be significantly reduced with sodium carbonate as the alkali, thus
making the process applicable for carbonate formations. The same chemicals are
also capable of altering the wettability of carbonate formations from strongly oil-wet
to preferentially water-wet. This wettability alteration in combination with ultralow
interfacial tension (IFT) makes it possible to displace oil from preferentially oil-wet
carbonate matrix to fractures by oil-water gravity drainage [41].16.1 Waterflooding 645

The alkaline surfactant process consists of injecting alkali and a synthetic
surfactant. The alkali generates in situ a soap by the reaction between the alkali and
naphthenic acids in the crude oil. It has been recognized that the local ratio of soap
to surfactant determines the local optimal salinity for minimum IFT.
This makes it possible to design a strategy to maximize the oil recovery with
the least amount of surfactant and to inject a polymer with the surfactant without
phase separation. An additional benefit of the presence of the soap component is that646 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
it generates an oil-rich colloidal dispersion that produces ultralow IFT over a much
wider range of salinity than in its absence.
Originally it was believed that a cosolvent such as alcohol is necessary to make
a microemulsion without gel-like phases or a polymer-rich phase separating from
the surfactant solution. An example of an alternative to the use of alcohol is to blend
two dissimilar surfactants: a branched alkoxylated sulfate and a double-tailed internal
olefin sulfonate [41].
The single-phase region with NaCl or CaCl2 is greater for the blend than for
either surfactant alone. It is also possible to incorporate polymer into such aqueous
surfactant solutions without phase separation under some conditions. The injected
surfactant solution has under optimum phase behavior with the crude oil. It becomes
optimum only as it mixes with the in situ-generated soap, which is generally more
hydrophobic than the injected surfactant. However, some crude oils do not have a
sufficiently high acid number for this approach to work properly [41].
Foam can be used for mobility control by alternating slugs of gas with slugs of
surfactant solution. Besides effective oil displacement in a homogeneous sand pack,
it demonstrated greatly improved sweep in a layered sand pack [41].
It has been tried to change the wettability of a carbonate rock from mixed wet
toward water wet at high temperature and high salinity.
Three types of surfactants in dilute concentrations, smaller than 0.2% were used.
It was observed that most of the surfactants were aqueous-unstable by themselves at
these harsh conditions [42].
Dual-surfactant systems, mixtures of a nonionic and a cationic surfactant, in￾creased the aqueous stability. Some of the dual-surfactant systems proved an effective
for wettability alteration and could recover could recover 70-80% original oil in place
(OOIP) during spontaneous imbibition. Secondary waterflooding with the wettability
altering surfactant increased the oil recovery over the waterflooding without the
surfactants from 29% to 40% of OOIP [42].
Kinetics of low-salinity flooding
Low-salinity waterflooding is a not well understood EOR method. The intrinsic
complexity of the process makes a fundamental understanding of the underlying
mechanisms and the interpretation of laboratory experiments difficult.
A model system for sandstone rock of reduced complexity was introduced that
consists of clay minerals, such as sodium montmorillonite deposited on a glass
substrate and covered with crude-oil droplets [43].
The kinetics of oil detachment when exposed to a low-salinity brine was assessed.
First, the system is equilibrated with a high-salinity brine and then exposed to brines
of lower salinity while the shape of the oil droplets is continuously monitored at high
resolution, allowing for a detailed analysis of the contact angle and the contact area
as a function of time.
It has been observed that the contact angle and the contact area of the oil with
the substrate reach a stable equilibrium with a high-salinity brine and show a clear16.1 Waterflooding 647
response to the low-salinity brine toward less oil-wetting conditions and ultimately
detachment from the clay substrate [43].
This behavior is characterized by the motion of the three-phase (oil/water/solid)
contact line that is initially pinned by the clay particles at high-salinity conditions,
and the pinning decreases in the course of exposure to a low-salinity brine. This leads
to a decrease of the contact area and contact angle, which indicates a wettability
alteration toward a more water-wet state. When the contact angle reaches a critical
value of approximately 40◦-50◦, the oil starts to detach from the clay.
During the detachment process, most of the oil is released, but in some cases a
small amount of oil residue is left behind on the clay substrate. Results for different
salinity levels indicate that the kinetics of this wettability change correlates with a
simple buoyancy over adhesion-force balance and has a time constant of hours to
days. So this takes longer than usually assumed [43].
This unexpectedly long-time constant, longer than expected by diffusion alone, is
compatible with an electrokinetic ion-transport model, the Nernst-Planck equation.
Alternatively, the observations could be explained by interactions between oil and
clay such as cation-bridging, direct chemical bonds, or acid/base effects that tend to
pin the contact line [43].
Implicit simulation of surfactant flooding
The microemulsion phase behavior model based on the oleic aqueous surfactant
pseudophase equilibrium is commonly used in chemical flooding simulators. This
equilibrium has been coupled to the gas-oil-water phase equilibrium in a four-fluid
phase research reservoir simulator [44].
The modeling method consists of splitting the equilibrium into two stages, in
which all the components other than the surfactants are equilibrated using a black￾oil, K-value, or equation of state model. The resulting gas, oil, and water phases
are then lumped into pseudophases to be equilibrated by use of the microemulsion
model.
This subdivision in stages is conceptual, and at each converged time step the
four phases will be in equilibrium with each other [45]. The fluid properties, such
as densities, viscosities, and IFTs, and the rock fluid properties, such as relative
permeabilities required in the transport equations, are evaluated with models from
other industrial or academic simulators.
Surfactant flooding is usually implemented as a tertiary recovery mechanism [45].
Frontal-stability analysis of surfactant floods
Recent surfactant-flooding experiments have shown that a very efficient oil recovery
can be obtained without mobility control when the surfactant solution is injected at
less than the critical velocity required for a gravity stable displacement [46].
A method has been developed to predict the stability of surfactant floods at the
reservoir scale on the basis of gravity stable surfactant flooding experiments at the
laboratory scale. The scale-up process involves the calculation of the appropriate648 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
average frontal velocity for the reservoir flood. The frontal velocity depends on the
well configuration.
Systematic numerical simulations were performed to study the effect of key
scaling groups on the performance of gravity stable surfactant floods [46].
Heterogeneous reservoirs were simulated by the use of a fine grid and a third￾order finite difference method. A new insight into the behavior of gravity stable sur￾factant floods could be obtained. In particular, the importance of the microemulsion
properties was stressed.
When a surfactant flood can be performed without polymer or foam for mobility
control, cost and complexity can be significantly reduced. These advantages become
significant when the reservoir temperature is high and the use of polymer becomes
increasingly difficult. The simulations revealed that gravity stable surfactant floods
can be very efficient at horizontal wells in reservoirs with a high vertical permeabil￾ity [46].
Critical velocity required for a gravity stable surfactant flood
Classical stability theory predicts the critical velocity for a miscible fluid to be
stabilized by gravity forces. This theory was tested for surfactant floods with ultralow
IFT and was found to be too optimistic compared with both laboratory displacement
experiments and fine-grid simulations [47]. The inaccurate prediction of instabilities
on the basis of available analytical models is because of the complex physics of
surfactant floods.
The effects of dispersion, heterogeneity, oil viscosity, relative permeability,
and microemulsion viscosity have been investigated. The results of these studies
indicated that it is possible to design a very efficient surfactant flood without any
mobility control if the surfactant solution is injected at a low velocity in horizontal
wells at the bottom of the geological zone and the oil is captured in horizontal wells
at the top of the zone. Numerical simulations showed high oil-recovery efficiencies
in the order of 60% of waterflood ROS for gravity stable surfactant floods by use in
horizontal wells. Thus, under favorable reservoir conditions, gravity stable surfactant
floods are attractive alternatives to surfactant polymer floods [47].
Monte Carlo method in surfactant flooding implementation
A decision-making evaluation method for flexibility in surfactant flooding has been
presented [48]. The method aims to the capture the effects of uncertainty in the time
series for both technical and economic parameters and produce a near optimal policy
with respect to these uncertainties as they vary with time.
The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) method was introduced, which is best
suited for evaluating flexibility in project implementation. The decision analyzed the
best time to start surfactant flooding during the life time of a field under uncertainty.16.1 Waterflooding 649
The study was conducted using two reservoir models [48]:
1. a three-dimensional homogeneous model and
2. a two-dimensional heterogeneous model.
The technical uncertainties under consideration were the ROS to the surfactant
flood, surfactant adsorption, and reservoir heterogeneity. The main economic uncer￾tain parameters considered were oil price, surfactant cost, water-injection costs, and
water-production costs.
The results indicate that the LSM method provides a decision-making tool
that can capture the value of flexibility in surfactant-flooding implementation and
provides some insight into the effects of uncertainty on decision making. This can
help to mitigate adverse circumstances or to capture the upside potential.
It was demonstrated that the optimal policy obtained was reliable and that
heterogeneity and different well-placement patterns affect the value of flexibility and
optimal policy for different reservoir models [48].
Alkyl-aryl sulfonates
Alkyl-aryl sulfonates have been recognized as promising for EOR by surfactant
floods. They can be manufactured in large quantities and can generate low IFTs with
oils under favorable conditions.
While pure alkyl-aryl sulfonates, such as hexadecyl benzene sulfonate, can gen￾erate adequate phase behavior and low IFT with light alkanes, they are unsatisfactory
when dealing with heavier crude oils, particularly those with a high wax content.
They do not form normal phase behavior when mixed with crude oil and brine of
varying salinity. At low salinity, surfactant predominantly stays in the aqueous phase,
forming a lower-phase microemulsion. At high salinity, the surfactant predominantly
stays in the oil phase, forming an upper-phase microemulsion.
Normally, a surfactant-oil-brine system that has high oil-recovery potential
exhibits a lower-phase to middle-phase to upper-phase microemulsion transition as
the salinity increases. Near the mid-range salinity, often termed optimal salinity,
a middle-phase microemulsion forms with appreciable amount of oil and brine
solubilized in the microemulsion phase. However, if the oil contains a significant
fraction of wax, the above phase transition often does not occur and the solubilization
capacity is low, resulting in high IFT and poor oil-recovery capability [49].
A series of homologue 1-phenylalkane sulfonates, that is, 1-phenyldodecane
sulfonate, 1-phenyltetradecane sulfonate, and 1-phenylhexadecane sulfonate were
synthesized. The IFT of 1-phenylalkane sulfonates synthesized against crude oil
from the Daqing oil field (China) were investigated.
Minima in the IFTs were observed with respect to changes of the concen￾trations of surfactant and with time. Alkali concentrations at which the lowest
IFTs were achieved moved to low regions by increasing the chain length of the
aliphatic chain in the sulfonate. The lowest concentration needed was observed with
1-phenylhexadecane sulfonate at about 0.3%.650 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
On the other hand, no minima were observed when IFTs of the 1-phenylalkane
sulfonates against alkanes themselves were measured. This habit is quite distinct
from that of the 1-phenylalkane sulfonates against crude oil [30].
For waxy crudes the use of a broad distribution of α-olefins the olefins greater
than C10 obtained by of an alpha olefin process are used for the alkylation of xylene
sulfonate or toluene sulfonate.
In contrast, conventionally used alkyl-aryl sulfonates generally focus on a narrow
range of olefin carbon numbers, such as C12-xylene sulfonate [49].
Surfactants of high activity
Surfactants with varied structures have been developed that can be used at very low
concentrations to produce ultralow IFTs for sandstone and limestone formations.
These surfactants can be used for ASP floods, surfactant floods and as an adjuvant
for waterfloods [36].
The new surfactants differ from conventional alkyl-aryl sulfonic acids, as the
sulfonate group is attached to the end of the alkyl chain, whereas in the conventional
alkyl-aryl sulfonic acid, the sulfonate is attached directly to the aromatic ring.
In general, the surface tensions and critical micelle concentrations are similar.
The solubility of the new alkyl-aryl sulfonic acids and their salts in water is generally
greater than the corresponding conventional alkyl-aryl sulfonic acids and their salts.
Because the sulfonate group is attached to the alkyl group instead of the ring, more
positions are available on the aromatic ring for additional substitution.
An olefin sulfonic acid is used to simultaneously alkylate and sulfonate the
aromatic compound. The aromatics that can be used include benzene, toluene,
xylenes, naphthalene, phenol, diphenylether, as well as substituted derivatives of
these compounds. The olefin sulfonic acid can be linear or branched with various
chain length. Examples are shown in Figure 16.1. Several laboratory case studies
have been performed for the evaluation and application of the surfactants.
Sulfoalkylated nonyl phenol can be condensed with formaldehyde into oligomers
[50]. The use of these oligomers in combination with other surfactants reduces the
adsorption of the surfactants at all.
Interactions of crude oil and alkaline solutions
The effectiveness of alkaline flooding for the recovery of an Arabian heavy crude oil
has been studied. The alkaline reagents react with the acidic species in crude oil to
form surface active soaps in situ. This leads to a lowering of the IFT and subsequently
to the mobilization of the residual oil in place.
The equilibrium IFTs obtained through alkaline flooding have been compared
with the IFTs when a synthetic surfactant, dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid sodium salt
is used [34].
Effect of alkalinity
Alkaline flooding has been supposed to be a promising process for enhancing the
recovery of heavy oil, while alkaline polymer (AP) and ASP injection are flooding
strategies for lighter oils [51].16.1 Waterflooding 651

Sulfoalkylated phenol surfactants.
The alkali in an ASP flood can reduce the adsorption of surfactants and react
with acids in the oil to form soaps. The polymers increase the viscosity of water
and control the mobility ratio. The addition of an alkali to a straight polymer flood
can further increase the efficiency in polymer flooding. The alkaline compounds can
react with the rock and the polymer to reduce polymer adsorption and decrease the
viscosity of the polymer solution to allow a higher injectivity.
Core experiments for polymer, alkali, and AP tertiary floods have been reported
[51]. Berea cores were waterflooded to residual-oil saturation, and then a tertiary
injection of a polymer, alkali, or an AP solution was run, followed by waterflooding.
It has been demonstrated that a tertiary alkali injection produces negligible oil
recovery and pressure drop increase. In contrast, straight polymer injection produces
considerable oil recovery with a significant increase in pressure drop that may
not be favorable for field designs. The injection of the AP solution also produces
considerable oil recovery, but the increase in pressure drop is less than that of the
straight polymer flood [51]. The effects of alkali on the polymer and the rock surface
result in a significant impact on the recovery factor, resistance factors, and also the
residual resistance factors.
Effect of initial water saturation
The mixing of injected water and in situ water during waterfloods was studied [52]. It
was demonstrated that the mixing process is sensitive to the initial water saturation.
The results illustrate differences between a waterflooded zone and a preflooded zone
during, for example, water-based EOR displacement processes.
The mixing of in situ, or connate, water and injected water during laboratory
waterfloods in a strongly water-wet chalk core sample was determined at different652 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
initial water saturations [52]. Dynamic one-dimensional fluid-saturation profiles
were determined with nuclear-tracer imaging during waterfloods, distinguishing
between the oil phase, connate water, and injected water. The mixing of connate
and injected water during waterfloods, with the presence of an oil phase, resulted in a
displacement of all connate water from the core plug. During displacement, connate
water banked in front of the injecting water, separating the injected water from the
mobile oil phase. This may impact the ability of chemicals dissolved in the injected
water to contact the oil during secondary recovery and EOR processes. The effect of
the connate-water-bank separation was sensitive to the initial water saturation.
The time difference between breakthrough of connate water and breakthrough
of injected water at the outlet showed a linear correlation to the initial water
saturation [52].
Effect of pressure and solution gas on oil recovery
Surfactant/polymer and ASP flooding is of interest because of the need to recover
residual oil after primary and secondary recovery. If designed properly, these EOR
processes can give very high oil recoveries. The microemulsion phase behavior plays
a central role in the performance and is typically measured by performing salinity
scans in glass pipettes at atmospheric pressure and reservoir temperature using dead
crude oil from the reservoir of interest [53].
There have been only a few experiments reported in the literature on live oil at
reservoir pressure and temperature, and the importance of those experimental results
is conflicting.
The effect of pressure and solution gas on the microemulsion phase behavior and
its impact on oil recovery has been assessed [53].
The experiments show that while pressure induces a phase transition from upper
microemulsion (Winsor Type II+) to lower microemulsion (Winsor Type II−),
solution gas does the opposite. An increase in pressure decreases the optimum
solubilization ratio and shifts the optimum salinity to a larger value. Adding methane
to dead oil at constant pressure does the reverse. Thus, these effects are coupled and
both must be taken into account [53].
Effects of connate water in alkaline flooding
The effects of connate water on caustic flooding processes in porous media by
employing acidified paraffin oil as the oil phase and aqueous sodium hydroxide as the
water phase were studied. Displacement processes were performed in basic solution
and with linoleic acid in absence and presence of connate water.
The results indicate that connate water has a greater effect on the displacement
pattern for systems with higher IFTs. For lower IFTs, the patterns are similar both
with and without connate water. Reducing the acid concentration has a large effect on
the displacements, indicating that the organic acid is the limiting reagent. Generally,
systems with connate water increase the oil recovery. As the IFT decreases, the
number of fingers increases and the finger width decreases [32].16.1 Waterflooding 653
Combination of primary and secondary surfactant systems
The recovery of crude oil by an improved surfactant flooding process and ASP
flooding which results in ultralow IFTs with brine against crude oil even while the
surfactant present is at or below its critical micelle concentration has been described.
The alkaline surfactant flooding process is used in oil reservoirs where a primary
surfactant system has been diluted with brine and pumped downhole where the alkali,
which is usually sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, reacts with the residual oil
acidic organic components to form a secondary surfactant system. This in situ formed
secondary surfactant helps the primary surfactant to further reduce the IFT between
the residual oil and the injected fluid thereby allowing the removal of residual oil
from the pores of the reservoir.
The process utilizes a primary surfactant system which includes anionic surfac￾tants, nonionic cosurfactants, solvents, and strong base. An improved concentrated
surfactant formulation containing primarily a mixture of anionic surfactants which
demonstrate ultralow (<10−2 mN m−1) IFT against crude oils containing acidic
organic components over a broad range of external parameters, such as surfactant
concentrations, electrolyte concentrations, alkali concentrations, temperatures, etc.
The primary concentrated surfactant solution is a combination of a linear alkyl
benzene sulfonate, a branched alkyl benzene sulfonate, and nonyl phenol [54].
Lignosulfonate acrylic acid graft copolymers as sacrificial agents
One of the most vexing problems in the use of surfactant flooding for EOR is the
frequent, substantial loss of surfactant due to adsorption on the formation matrix and
precipitation by polyvalent cations such as calcium and magnesium. A significant
percentage of surfactants are also physically entrapped within the pore spaces of the
rock matrix. Of chief concern is surfactant adsorption on the formation matrix which
significantly decreases surfactant flood efficiency, making it necessary to inject a
greater quantity of surfactant and increasing the cost of any surfactant flood.
Most surfactants are satisfactory for surfactant flooding only if the calcium
and magnesium concentrations of the formation water fall below about 500 ppm.
Petroleum sulfonates, the most popular type of surfactants, precipitate where divalent
ion concentrations exceed about 500 ppm. Such precipitation renders the sulfonates
inoperative for recovering oil and in some instances, causes formation plugging.
The main cause of surfactant loss is adsorption within the formation due to
physical contact of the surfactant with the formation matrix or entrapment within
pores of the matrix. Surfactant systems contacting carbonate or sandstone matrices
encounter a range of adsorptive sites. Adsorption can be a particularly vexing
problem in a sandstone formation.
The most promising approach for reducing the amount of surfactants retained
by the formation matrix has been to use sacrificial agent compounds, either in
a preflush solution injected before the surfactant-containing solution, or in the
surfactant solution. The compounds are sacrificial in that their adsorption on the
formation matrix and entrapment within the pore spaces of the formation reduces
the loss of the more expensive surfactants, solubilizers and polymers contained
within the surfactant solutions.654 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
Various chemicals have been employed as sacrificial agents to decrease the
adsorption of surfactants or to tie up polyvalent cations and prevent them from
precipitating surfactants from the flooding medium. Lignosulfonates form one class
of compounds which have been found to have excellent properties as sacrificial
agents. They are economically attractive because they are byproducts of the pulp
industry.
A lignosulfonate acrylic acid graft copolymer can be used as such an sacrificial
agent. A diluted solution is injected into the formation to decrease the loss of more
costly surfactant and polymer into the formation [55]. It is believed that sacrificial
agents generally work by several chemical mechanisms [55]:
• the sacrificial agent complexes with polyvalent cations in the formation fluids, so
there will be less polyvalent cations left for the surfactant to interact with;
• electrostatic attraction of the matrix and the sacrificial agent for each other; and
• blocking the access to other sites on which injected surfactants, solubilizers and
polymers could adsorb.
Silicone compounds with surfactants
Silicone compounds, such as silanes, siloxanes, silicone oils, and resins, have been
examined for the restriction of water production in gas wells. The gas production
from gas fields and underground gas storage is usually accompanied by unwanted
water production. The high water production often deteriorates the gas flow and
recovery efficiency in wells operating in gas fields and hampers maintaining an
environment compatible operation.
Therefore, during the past decades, intensive activities have been launched to
develop a viable method to cure the problem. The various methods, tested also under
field conditions, can be categorized into [56]:
1. application of chain like polymers;
2. injection or in situ generation of weak polymer gels;
3. application of alcohol-containing polymer solutions;
4. treatment of wells with surfactant stabilized oil-in-water emulsions;
5. injection of silicone microemulsions; and
6. hydrophobization of the formation rock.
Injection of a silicone microemulsion has been developed for the restriction
of water production in gas wells. The treating solution was a surfactant stabilized
siloxane emulsion which was driven into the formation by water and nitrogen.
According to the laboratory studies, disproportional permeability modification
is in the background of the water retention. The phenomena are attributed to the
inversion of the microemulsion into a macroemulsion initiated by spontaneous
dilution by water and then entrapping of formed siloxane droplets by the pores.
The field test proved a beneficial effect of the silicone injection on gas production
and gas/water ratio: the gas production tripled and lasted for at least a half year [57].16.1 Waterflooding 655
Nonionic tensides
The first nonionic tensides were synthesized by C. Schöller at BASF by condensing
oleic and stearic acid with poly(oxyethylene glycol) in 1930. Nonionic surfactants
are superior over ionic surfactants in many respects. Therefore, their industrial
application have been quite widespread in the past century. In 1964, 105 T of
nonionic surfactants were produced and the production grew in the 1990s to more
than 105 T per year.
Interfacial rheological properties of different Hungarian crude oil/water systems
were determined in wide temperature and shear rate range and in the presence
of inorganic electrolytes, water-soluble polymers, nonionic tensides, and alkaline
materials [58,59].
Ethoxylated nonyl phenols
Ethoxylated nonyl phenols significantly reduce both the interfacial viscosity and the
non-Newtonian character of the flow. Ethoxylated nonyl phenols with ethoxy groups
of 10-40 were screened. The efficiency of ethoxylated nonyl phenols decreases
with increasing ethoxy units. Also increasing concentration enhances the effect.
The phenomena can be explained by the formation of a closely packed adsorption
layer between the phases [38,60]. The activation energy of viscous flow in NaOH
containing oil-water systems is similar to those calculated for surfactant-containing
systems [61].
Interactions between ethoxy nonyl phenol and poly(acrylamide)
Micellization experiments of an ethoxylated nonyl phenol in the presence of par￾tially hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide) (PHPA) showed that the presence of a highly
hydrophilic polymer in aqueous solution of nonionic surfactants has only a negligible
effect on the micelle structure and the mechanism of micelle formation. On the other
hand, above the critical polymer concentration, the network structure is stabilized by
the tenside. Therefore, the tenside exhibits positive effects on the performance of the
polymer [62].
Hybrid ionic nonionic surfactants
In high-salinity formations, the common nonionic and anionic surfactants are
inefficient because of salting out or cloud point phenomena. A hybrid ionic nonionic
surfactant is shown in Figure 16.2.

O–Na+
FIGURE 16.2
Phenolether as hybrid ionic nonionic surfactant.656 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
A surfactant with nonionic and anionic hydrophilic group has been synthesized.
The surfactant is soluble in 30% NaCl brine, and shows good surface activity in brine
with salinity. The IFT is particularly low if the surfactant is combined with petroleum
sulfonate [39,40].
Several commercially available, nonionic surfactants were identified that are
capable of dissolving in carbon dioxide (CO2) in dilute concentration under typical
minimum-miscibility-pressure conditions and, upon mixing with brine in a high￾pressure windowed cell, stabilizing CO2-in-brine foams [63].
These slightly CO2-soluble, water-soluble surfactants include branched alkyl
phenol ethoxylates, branched alkyl ethoxylates, a fatty-acid-based surfactant, and a
predominantly linear ethoxylated alcohol.
Many of the surfactants were between 0.02 wt% and 0.06 wt% soluble in CO2
at 100 bar and 25 ◦C, and most demonstrated some capacity to stabilize the foam.
The most stable foams observed in a high-pressure windowed cell were attained with
branched alkyl phenol ethoxylates [63].
High-pressure small-angle-neutron-scattering analysis of foams residing in a
small-windowed cell demonstrated that the nonyl phenol ethoxylate SURFONIC®
N-150 generated emulsions with a greater concentration of droplets and a broader
distribution of droplet sizes than the shorter-chain analogs with 9-12 ethoxylates.
The in situ formation of weak foams could be verified with transient mobility tests
by measuring the pressure drop across a Berea sandstone core as a CO2/surfactant
solution was injected into a Berea sandstone core initially saturated with brine. The
pressure drop values when surfactant was dissolved in the CO2 were at least twice
those attained when pure CO2 was injected into the same brine-saturated core [63].
The greatest mobility reduction was achieved when the surfactant was added both
to the brine initially in the core and to the injected CO2. Computer tomography
imaging of CO2 invading a polystyrene core initially saturated with 5% KI brine
indicated that despite the oil-wet nature of this medium, a sharp foam front
propagated through the core, and CO2 fingers that formed in the absence of a
surfactant were completely suppressed by foams formed because of the addition of
nonyl phenol ethoxylate surfactant to the CO2 or the brine [63].
Olefin surfactants
Surfactant polymer flooding involves injecting into a reservoir a fluid containing
water or brine and about 1% surfactant and about 0.1% polymer. ASP flooding
involves the injection of water or brine containing alkali in addition to the surfactant
and the polymer [64].
The surfactant chemical reduces the IFT between water and oil, while the polymer
acts as a viscosity modifier and helps to mobilize the oil. Alkali sequesters divalent
ions in the formation brine and thereby reduces the adsorption of the surfactant during
displacement through the formation. Alkali also generates an anionic surfactant,
a sodium napththenate soap, in situ in the formation by reacting with naphthenic16.1 Waterflooding 657
acids that are naturally present in the crude oil. The use of relatively inexpensive
alkali reduces the amount of surfactant required, and therefore the overall cost of the
system. Alkali may also help alter formation wettability to a more water-wet state to
improve the imbibition rate [64].
Internal olefins are disubstituted, trisubstituted, and tetrasubstituted olefins. Thus,
ethene, propene, and 1-butene do not belong to the group of internal olefins, but
2-butene is an internal olefin.
Internal olefins can be obtained from a variety of processes, including olefin
oligomerization processes, α-olefin metathesis, Fischer-Tropsch processes, catalytic
dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffin hydrocarbons, thermal cracking of hydrocar￾bon waxes, and dimerized vinyl olefin processes.
Internal olefin sulfonates are anionic surfactants that have been evaluated as
surfactants for EOR. Internal olefin sulfonates may be prepared by the sulfonation
of internal olefins with the aid of SO3 and inert gases and subsequent neutralization.
It has been found that sulfonated derivatives of internal olefins with low amounts
of trisubstitution on the double bond, offer unique and significant performance
advantages in a surfactant EOR system. Several examples for the synthesis by
metathesis have been given in detail [64].
Anionic gemini surfactants
A new family of anionic surfactants has been described that has great potential for
EOR applications. Anionic gemini surfactants can be synthesized from diglycidyl
ethers [65].
The first report showing the universal relationship between the properties and
structures of anionic Gemini surfactants was published in 1990 [66]. Since then,
many anionic Gemini surfactants, including sulfates, sulfonates, carboxylates,
and phosphates, were prepared by utilizing a threefunctional epichlorohydrin.
Epoxyalkane was used to synthesize a disulfate gemini.
Anionic Gemini surfactants of varied structures have been prepared, because
many kinds of starting material other than epichlorohydrin and epoxyalkane, are
available for synthesis. For instance, from diphenyl ether and olefin, benzene
sulfonate Gemini surfactants are prepared as the components of a mixture product
[67]. The unique and versatile structure of these surfactants has endowed them with
properties that are attractive for EOR.
The interfacial properties of a series of seven anionic surfactants with different
lengths of hydrophobic tail and linking spacer group show systematic trends in IFT
and static adsorption density with changes in solution conditions. In addition, these
molecules show an excellent aqueous stability even in high salinity and hard brines.
Ultralow IFT values were measured at low surfactant concentrations. The Gemini
surfactants also showed lower maximal adsorption densities than the conventional
single-chain surfactants. Therefore, there is a potential of using these surfactants at
low concentrations and under harsh reservoir conditions [67].658 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
16.1.2 INTER-PHASE STRUCTURE
To elucidate whether the phase behavior or IFT is the governing criterion for an ASP
flooding formulation, an experimental study has been performed [68]. The volume
and the color of the middle-phase liquid were observed, the transient IFT at different
salt and alkaline concentrations were measured. Finally, a coreflood test in laboratory
was performed. It is concluded that the primary and more important phenomenon
affecting the oil recovery is the low or ultralow minimum IFT at the crude oil soluble
phase interface.
The phase behavior and the IFT in the course of ASP flooding were investigated.
The size distribution and structure analysis of the middle mixed layer were studied
by a size analyzer and freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy. Some rules
between the volume of the middle mixed layer and the concentration of each
component could be established. The IFT between the middle mixed layer and the
oil phase or water phase can reach a very low value [69].
Several systems of surfactant and alkaline combination flooding were studied
with microscopy, polarizing microscopy, microcalorimetry, laser particles analysis
instrument and IFT meter.
Liquid crystals distributed on the surface of the small particles, which were
formed, were observed. The small particles and the liquid crystals (LCs) are
responsible for the ultralow IFT [70].
Sandwich structures
Experimental evidence on the appearance of a third LC phase between the oil and
water forming a sandwich-like structure has been presented. The presence of this
structure modifies both the equilibrium and the transport properties of oil-water
systems. Therefore, this phase should be considered dealing with oil-water interfacial
properties.
Polarization microscopy was used to observe the sandwich structures. Naphthenic
acid was used because it is the most important precursor of natural surfactants and
its phase behavior is known [71,72].
An equilibrium LC layer on an interface between crude oils and water was
observed at high pH. This layer is composed mainly of sodium naphthenates
formed in situ at the water/oil interface. The transient LC layer was also evolved
at the interface of aqueous phase of sodium hydroxide solutions and oleic phase
of naphthenic acid solutions as result of a salt formation between NaOH and
naphthenic acid.
The chemical reaction causes a transport process resulting in a disturbance of
the interface. The optical observation of this interface disturbance revealed that the
interface covered with LC shows a considerably lower flexibility in comparison to
an LC-free interface. The LC layer eventually dissolves in the water phase at low
oil-to-water ratio, while at high oil-to-water ratio it can form an equilibrium phase,
which spreads spontaneously at the oil-water interface [33].16.1 Waterflooding 659
Dynamic IFT behavior with in situ-formed surfactants
The time-dependent IFT has been investigated for an interfacially reactive immiscible
system composed of model-acidified oil and alkaline water. The acidified oil was
composed of either lauric acid or linoleic acid dissolved in n-dodecane. Drop volume
tensiometry was used to measure the IFT.
The rate of formation of the interfacial area depends on alkali concentration.
For lauric acid, the IFT value was found to decrease sharply with increasing alkali
concentration, even at low drop formation times. In the case of linoleic acid, the
decrease of the IFT with the drop formation time was more gradual, in particular at
low alkali concentration [35].
16.1.3 INTERFACIAL RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
In hydrocarbon reservoirs, the interfacial phenomena play a fundamental role in the
displacement processes and phase-exchange mechanism. Interfacial rheology is an
efficient and powerful detection technique.
The positive effect of alkalis on microscopic displacement efficiency is attributed
to [61]:
1. the alteration of the wettability;
2. the lowering of the IFT;
3. the restriction of rigid films at the oil-water interfaces;
4. the initiation of phase inversion in dispersed systems;
5. the formation of oil external emulsions;
6. chemical reactions with some constituents of formation water and rocks; and
7. the sorption of naturally occurring surfactants.
16.1.4 MICROEMULSION PHASE DIAGRAMS
Tertiary oil recovery by means of microemulsions are concerned with
• the ability of a microemulsion to dissolve oil and water and
• the attainment of very low IFTs.
Therefore, the understanding of chemical flooding processes for EOR relies on
the knowledge of phase equilibria for such systems, which are composed of brine,
oil, surfactant, and cosurfactant.
A thermodynamic analytical representation of the phase diagram of microemul￾sion systems similar to those used in EOR has been worked out [73]. Because
the system is basically a four-component system, the data can be represented in
Gibbs tetrahedral co-ordinates. Multiphase liquid equilibria can be estimated by the
excess Gibbs energy interaction parameters. An empirical expression was introduced
into the selected excess Gibbs energy model to account for the specific role of the
surfactant in these complex systems.660 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
The results have been successfully tested for an oil-brine-surfactant-alcohol
model system consisting of a sodium alkyl benzene sulfonate and n-butanol as
cosurfactant.
16.1.5 INTERFACIAL TENSION
The oil-water IFT is one of the most important parameter for chemical-EOR. It
has a strong time dependency, especially under alkaline conditions. Therefore, the
knowledge of IFT dependence on time is necessary for the prediction of oil recovery.
The addition of sodium hydroxide to floodwater improves the oil or bitumen
production. The alkaline additive activates the natural surfactants precursors present
in crude oil. The surfactant precursors consist most likely of acidic components in
the crudes [33].
The IFT varies strongly with temperature and pressure and thus influences the
transport of the fluid in a reservoir strongly. Therefore, the IFT is probably the most
important of the factors that make one-third of the total oil in place unrecoverable by
gas drive or waterflooding [74].
16.1.6 IMBIBITION EXPERIMENTS
Spontaneous imbibition experiments in nearly oil-wet, low permeable chalk material
saturated with oil have been performed at ambient conditions with and without
the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide present in the aqueous
solution.
Without surfactant present in the water, the rate of imbibition is very small, and
only approximate 13% of the oil could be expelled from the core within 90 days.
After that time, a sudden increase in the oil production was observed by exchanging
the water with a 1.0% surfactant solution. However, if the surfactant is present during
the whole experiment, an oil production plateau of approximate to 65% recovery was
obtained within 90 days [37].
Spontaneous imbibition of water using nanofluids
Nanotechnology continues to develop rapidly in the oil industry. The role of
nanoparticles to improve the spontaneous imbibition of water is still not clear.
The oil recovery from oil-wet samples was compared using aqueous solutions
of a cationic surfactant (C12TAB) and synergic blend of SiO2 nanoparticles and
surfactant at room temperature [75]. Also the potential of nanoparticles to change
the surface wettability and oil-water IFT was evaluated, using the contact angle and
pendent-drop method.
A change toward more water-wet condition and an increase in oil-water IFT after
the application of nanoparticles was observed. An increase in IFT, and consequently,
the capillary pressure, leads to a stronger imbibition of water into small pores after
a wettability alteration to water-wet condition [75]. In the imbibition experiments,16.2 Caustic waterflooding 661
about 46% of the OOIP could be recovered using the surfactant, while an additional
10% was the average recovery using a nanofluid. Therefore, the imbibition of
aqueous C12TAB solution into the core is improved when nanoparticles are
added.
16.1.7 WETTABILITY ALTERATION MODEL
The wettability modification of solid rocks with surfactants is an important process
and has the potential to recover oil from reservoirs. When the wettability is altered
by the use of surfactant solutions, the capillary pressure, relative permeabilities, and
ROSs change wherever the porous rock is contacted by the surfactant.
A mechanistic model has been developed in which the wettability alteration
is simulated by a new empirical correlation of the contact angle with surfactant
concentration developed from experimental data [76].
The model was tested using results from experimental tests in which oil was
displaced from oil-wet cores by imbibition of surfactant solutions. A quantitative
agreement between the simulation results of oil displacement and experimental data
from the literature could be obtained.
The simulation of the imbibition of surfactant solution in laboratory scale cores
using this model, demonstrated that wettability alteration is a dynamic process, which
plays a significant role in history matching and prediction of oil recovery from oil￾wet porous media.
The gravity force was the primary cause of the surfactant-solution invasion of the
core that changed the rock wettability toward a less oil-wet state [76].
16.2 CAUSTIC WATERFLOODING
16.2.1 INJECTION STRATEGIES
To develop improved alkali surfactant flooding methods, several different injection
strategies were tested for recovering heavy oils. Oil recovery was compared for four
different injection strategies [77]:
• surfactant followed by polymer;
• surfactant followed by AP;
• alkaline surfactant followed by polymer; and
• alkali, surfactant, and polymer mixed in a single formulation.
The effect of alkaline preflush was also studied under two different conditions.
All of the oil-recovery experiments were conducted under optimal conditions with a
viscous, nonacidic oil and with Berea sandstone cores.662 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
16.2.2 FOAM-ENHANCED CAUSTIC WATERFLOODING
An alkaline waterflooding process is enhanced by the injection of aqueous solutions
of foam-forming surfactant and gases, or preformed foams, either ahead of or behind
conventional alkaline slugs. A slug of an aqueous solution containing an alkaline
agent, followed by a driving fluid, is injected into the formation and displaces oil
through the relatively high-permeability zones of the formation, and oil is recovered
via the production well. Thereafter, a slug of an aqueous solution with a foaming
agent is coinjected into the formation with a gas and creates a foam upon mixing
with the gas. The foam created from the aqueous foaming agent and gas will go
preferentially into the formation zones of relatively high-permeability and low oil
saturation, substantially plugging these zones. Then a slug of an aqueous alkaline
agent is injected, followed by a driving fluid that displaces the alkaline solution and
oil through the less permeable zones toward the production well [78].
16.2.3 ALKALINE SURFACTANT POLYMER FLOODING
Polymers can be used for mobility control. The interaction between polymers and
surfactants is shown to be affected by pH, ionic strength, crude oil type, and the
properties of the polymers and surfactants [79].
Surfactants, whose major components are natural mixed carboxylates from the
heels of vegetable oil and fats such as soybean oil, vegetable oil, animal oil, tea
oil, etc., have been developed. The optimal formulations were obtained using an
orthogonal-test-design method to screen the ASP flooding systems. The transient
IFTs at the oil/aqueous interface were measured. The oil recovery can be increased
by 26.8% of the OOIP in a coreflood experiment. The waste water resulting from
the production of the natural mixed carboxylates also exhibits a high surface activity
[31,80,81].
Suspended solid particles in the produced water of an ASP flooding project were
separated by a membrane filtration technique [82]. It was found that the particles are
consisting mainly of alkali or earth alkali carbonates and silica precipitates.
A formulation of chelatants was developed to stabilize the water phase of the
produced fluid ASP flooding. This should serve to prevent or reduce the precipitation
of the carbonates and the silica. Actually, the average suspended solid content of the
treated water was decreased below the 20 ppm limit for reinjection [82].
For heavy oils with viscosities ranging from 1000 to 10,000 mPa s primary
production and waterflood together can recover only 8-15% of the OOIP. Heavy
oils from Canada usually have a relatively high content of acids that can react with
alkalis and are forming so in situ surfactants. The loosely consolidated sandstone
formations in which these oils are deposited have a high porosity, high permeability,
and a low reservoir temperature. Such conditions are favorable for the application
of polymers.
A study has been presented for AP flooding for heavy-oil recovery [83]. Viscosity
measurements, flood tests in channeled sand packs, the residual-resistance-factor,16.2 Caustic waterflooding 663
and residual-oil-distribution measurements have been done. The distribution of
an injected chemical solution within the high-permeability channels leads to the
diversion of the subsequently injected chemical solution to low-permeability zones
with higher oil saturation. This occurs because of the formation of blockage in the
channel zones.
Thus, pressure buildup during chemical-slug injection is the key to an improve￾ment of the efficiency of displacement. AP flooding is more efficient than either
alkaline flooding or polymer flooding. In summary, it has been shown that AP
flooding can effectively improve the sweep efficiency of waterflooding for heavy
oil [83].
Deep eutectic solvents
There is a need to optimize surfactant and polymer flooding and new chemicals
should be designed to produce more oil. A new deep eutectic solvent (DES) that
is based on choline chloride/ethylene glycol for EOR has been introduced [84].
Different concentrations of DES solutions in brine were characterized by mea￾suring density, viscosity, conductivity, surface tension, and the refractive index
at different temperatures (2-55 ◦C). The effects of the DES brine solutions on
emulsification with oil phase, wettability alteration, oil solvent IFT, formation
damage, and tertiary heavy-oil recovery were studied.
The potential of the DES solution on enhancing heavy-oil recovery was assessed
using coreflood experiments. Rather an increase in IFT was observed between the
DES brine solution and the oil. Spontaneous-water-imbibition tests suggested that a
decrease in the oil wetness resulted in an increase in oil production. Approximately
52% of the residual oil after waterflooding was recovered with the DES from the
coreflooding. The interaction of the DES with the core materials did not lead to
formation damage, as demonstrated by permeability measurements. Viscous forces
and wettability alteration were found to be the dominant mechanisms for the
enhancement in tertiary oil recovery [84].
Propagation of a nanodispersed catalyst
The propagation of a nanodispersed catalyst suspension in sand packs was in￾vestigated. The sand packs were prepared with Athabasca reservoir sand and the
experiments were done at the reservoir conditions. The concentration and size
distribution of the particles at the injection and production end were measured [85].
The pressure drops in different segments along length of the sand pack were
monitored continuously. The retention behavior of the particles at the end of each
experiment was examined by measuring the catalyst concentration in the bed as a
function of the distance from the injection end of the sand pack and also by analysis
of extracted samples using scanning electron microscopy.
The results show that it is possible to propagate the nanodispersed catalyst
suspension through sand beds without causing a permeability damage, but a small
fraction of the injected particles is retained in the sand [85].664 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
It was also found that a significantly higher retention occurs in the entrance
region of the bed in comparison to the downstream regions and that the total particle
retention was higher in the Athabasca sand beds than in clean silica sand with the
same flow and suspension properties [85].
Use of cosolvents
It has been found that the addition of low concentrations of certain inexpensive light
cosolvents to AP solutions dramatically improves the performance of AP corefloods
in two important ways [86]:
1. The addition of cosolvent promotes the formation of low-viscosity
microemulsions rather than viscous macroemulsions.
2. These light cosolvents greatly improve the phase behavior in a way that can be
tailored to a particular oil, temperature, and salinity.
The chemical-EOR technology uses a polymer for mobility control and has been
termed alkali cosolvent polymer (ACP) flooding.
ACP corefloods perform as well as ASP corefloods while being simpler and more
robust.
Twelve successful ACP corefloods using four different crude oils ranging from
12◦ to 24◦ API have been reported in detail [86]. The ACP process shows special
promise for heavy oils, which tend to have large fractions of soap-forming acidic
components, but is applicable across a wide range of oil gravity.
16.2.4 SWEEP EFFICIENCY
A common problem in many waterflooded oil reservoirs is an early water break￾through with high water cut through highly conductive thief zones. A thermally active
polymer, which is an expandable sub-micron particulate of low viscosity, has been
successfully used as an in-depth conformance to improve the sweep efficiency of
waterfloods [87].
In order to model properties of this polymer and its interaction with the
reservoir rock simulation, approaches have been developed. The methods include
the temperature-triggered viscosification and adsorption or retention effects.
The temperature profile in the reservoir is modeled using an energy balance to
accurately place the polymer at the optimum location in the thief zone. One method
considers a single chemical component in the water phase. Another method is based
on chemical reactions of multiple chemical components.
The results of the simulation indicate that temperature-triggered polymers can
increase the amount of oil recovery by viscosification and chemical adsorption or
retention. This reduces the thief-zone permeability and diverts the flow into unswept
zones.16.3 Smart waterflooding 665
Sensitivity analyses suggest that ultimate oil recovery and conformance control
depend on the [87]:
• thief-zone temperature;
• vertical- to horizontal-permeability ratio;
• vertical location of the thief-zone;
• injection concentration and slug size;
• oil viscosity; and
• chemical adsorption and its reversibility.
For high-flow-capacity thief zones and mobility ratios higher than 10, oil
recoveries can be improved by increasing the chemical concentration or slug size
of treatments. Reservoirs with a low vertical- to the horizontal-permeability ratio
and a high permeability contrast generally shows faster incremental recoveries than
reservoirs with high vertical- to the horizontal-permeability ratios and strong water
segregation [87].
16.2.5 INTERPHASE PROPERTIES
Alkaline agents can reduce surfactant losses and permit the use of low concentrations
of surfactants. Laboratory tests show that alkali and synthetic surfactants produce
interfacial properties that are more favorable for increased oil mobilization than either
alkali or surfactant alone [88,89].
16.2.6 CLAY DISSOLUTION
During caustic waterflooding the alkali can be consumed by the dissolution of clays
and is lost in this way. The amount lost depends on the kinetics of the particular
reaction. Several studies have been performed with kaolinite, using quartz as a
yardstick, because the kinetic data are documented in the literature. The initial
reaction rate has been found pH independent in the pH range of 11-13 [90]. The
kinetics of silica dissolution could be quantitatively described in terms of pH, salinity,
ion exchange properties, temperature, and contact time [91].
16.3 SMART WATERFLOODING
Injection water with selective ionic content and composition is a key requirement for
smart waterflooding (SWF) applications in carbonate reservoirs [92]. Smart water
is depleted with respect to monovalent ions, but enriched in sulfates and divalent
cations. This material is desired for incremental oil recovery in carbonates, which
constitute complex water chemistry when compared with sandstones.
Most of the published work available in this area is focused on addressing
the water chemistry requirements for low-salinity waterflooding in sandstones. An666 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
analogous study for SWF in carbonate reservoirs has been presented [92]. It has been
tried to identify and optimize a water-ionic technology that can serve as a one-shop
solution to generate desired the water chemistries suited for different oil-recovery
processes, including SWF in carbonates.
The technology makes use of two membrane-desalination processes in parallel
configuration to provide multiple water streams of widely varying ionic strength and
content [92]. Different water streams obtained can be blended effectively to yield a
smart-water cocktail of the desired ionic strength, composition, and monovalent- to
divalent-ion content suited for carbonates.
The smart-water cocktails are also suited for the application in polymer flooding,
ASP flooding, low-salinity surfactant flooding, dilute surfactant flooding, carbonated
waterflooding, and miscible gas flooding, and are in addition suited for boiler
feedwater in steamflooding.
The major advantages of this technology are a better water-ion-tuning flexibility,
higher recovery efficiency, lower energy requirement, and ease of operation [92].
16.4 ACID FLOODING
16.4.1 HYDROCHLORIC ACID
Acid flooding can be successful in formations that are dissolvable in the particular
acid mixture, thus opening the pores. Hydrochloric acid is common, in a con￾centration of 6-30%, sometimes also with hydrofluoric acid and surfactants added
(e.g., isononyl phenol) [93,94]. The acidic environment has still another effect on
surfactants. It converts the sulfonates into sulfonic acid, which has a lower IFT
toward oil. Therefore, a higher oil forcing-out efficiency than from neutral aqueous
solution of sulfonates is obtained. Cyclic injection can be applied [95,96], and
sulfuric acid has been described for acid treatment [97–99]. Injecting additional
aqueous lignosulfonate increases the efficiency of a sulfuric acid treatment [100].
Hydrochloric acid in combination with chlorine dioxide can be used as a
treatment fluid in water injection wells that get impaired by the deposition of solid
residues [101,102]. The treatment seems to be more effective than the conventional
acidizing system when the plugging material contains iron sulfide and bacterial
agents because of the strongly oxidative power of chlorine dioxide. Mixtures of
chlorine dioxide, lactic acid, and other organic acids [103,104] also have been
described.
Iron control chemicals are used during acid stimulation to prevent the precipi￾tation of iron-containing compounds. The precipitation of these compounds in the
critical near wellbore area can decrease well productivity or injectivity. Acetic acid,
citric acid, nitrilo triacetic acid, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, and erythorbic acid
are applied [105,106]. A time dependence of iron(III) hydroxide precipitation was
observed. Acetic acid can prevent the precipitation of iron(III) at high acetic acid
concentrations at low temperatures.16.5 Emulsion flooding 667
If the injected acid itself contains iron(III), a precipitation of the asphaltic
products can occur when it comes in contact with certain crude oils. This leads
to practically irreversible damage of the zone treated. The amount of precipitate
generally increases with the strength and concentration of the acid. Certain organic
sulfur compounds, such as ammonium thioglycolate, mercaptoethanol, cysteamine,
thioglycerol, cysteine, and thiolactic acid can reduce iron(III) [107].
16.4.2 SULFURIC ACID
In contrast to hydrochloric acid, the use of sulfuric acid, in particular in a thermal
treatment reacts with the crude oil itself and causes a reduction of the viscosity [108].
In laboratory experiments, crude oil was placed in an autoclave with 10-50 ppm
sulfuric acid. After mixing and deaeration, the mixture was heated to 360 ◦C for
2-6 h at elevated pressure.
No significant changes are observed in the total acid number, distribution
of naphthenic acids, toluene equivalence, and n-heptane insolubles between the
thermally treated and sulfuric acid catalyzed thermally treated samples. These data
indicate that the chemistry of the crude oil is not significantly altered as a result of
sulfuric acid addition prior to thermal treatment.
However, a decrease in energy of activation of flow (viscosity) is observed.
Therefore, it is suggested that the sulfuric acid catalyzed thermal treatment alters
the fundamental aggregation properties of the chemical species responsible for high
viscosities of respective heavy crude oils.
16.5 EMULSION FLOODING
Optimizing the formulation of micellar surfactant solutions used for EOR consists
of obtaining IFTs as low as possible in multiphase systems, which can be achieved
by mixing the injected solution with formation fluids. The solubilization of hydro￾carbons by the micellar phases of such systems is linked directly to the interfacial
efficiency of surfactants. Numerous research projects have shown that the amount of
hydrocarbons solubilized by the surfactant is generally as great as the IFT between
the micellar phase and the hydrocarbons. The solubilization of crude oils depends
strongly on their chemical composition [109].
Micellar flooding is a promising tertiary oil-recovery method, perhaps the only
method that has been shown to be successful in the field for depleted light oil
reservoirs. As a tertiary recovery method, the micellar flooding process has desirable
features of several chemical methods (e.g., miscible-type displacement) and is less
susceptible to some of the drawbacks of chemical methods, such as adsorption.
It has been shown that a suitable preflush can considerably curtail the surfactant
loss to the rock matrix. In addition, the use of multiple micellar solutions, selected on
the basis of phase behavior, can increase the oil recovery with respect to the amount
of surfactant, in comparison with a single solution. Laboratory tests showed that
volume ratios of oil recovery to slug as high as 15 can be achieved [110].668 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
A solids-stabilized water-in-oil emulsion may be used either as a drive fluid for
displacing hydrocarbons from the formation or to produce a barrier for diverting the
flow of fluids in the formation. The solid particles may be formation solid particles
or nonformation solid particles, obtained from outside the formation [111,112].
16.5.1 MICELLAR POLYMER FLOODING
The factors affecting the equilibrium IFT at the oil/water interface were studied. Ex￾periments covering parameters including reservoir temperature, pressure, surfactant
concentration, and salinity were performed. The pendent-drop technique enhanced
by video imaging was employed for measuring the IFT.
The IFT decreases with temperature and salinity and decreases exponentially
with surfactant concentration, but increases with pressure [113]. The oil-recovery
performance of micellar floods is the highest, followed by polymer floods. Alkaline
floods have been largely unsuccessful [114].
Micellar and alkaline surfactant polymer flooding
The results for micellar flooding and ASP flooding processes were compared.
Laboratory flood experiments for micellar floods in consolidated sandstone cores
and in unconsolidated sand packs were performed using combinations of an alkali, a
surfactant, and a polymer. Slugs were injected sequentially in a series of experimental
while the three components were mixed and injected as a single slug in other
experiments. The oil recoveries in the two series of experiments were similar.
Based on the total oil recovery, micellar flooding is the superior process, with oil
recoveries ranging from 50% to 80% of the oil left in the porous medium after a
waterflood [115].
Scale-up methods for micellar flooding
The design of micellar floods is largely based on laboratory experiments, which
are usually unscaled. Dimensional analysis and inspectional analysis are helpful for
scaling up the design. General scaling criteria can be simplified for corefloods, and
were verified by micellar floods in scaled models. Good agreement was obtained in
most cases between the actual and the predicted oil production histories, showing the
validity of the scale-up. The scaling criteria derived can be also used for a micellar
flood [116].
16.6 CHEMICAL INJECTION
The state of the art in chemical oil recovery has been reviewed [117]. More than
two-thirds of the original oil remains unrecovered in an oil reservoir after primary
and secondary recovery methods have been exhausted. Many chemically based16.6 Chemical injection 669
oil-recovery methods have been proposed and tested in the laboratory and field.
Indeed, chemical oil-recovery methods offer a real challenge in view of their success
in the laboratory and lack of success in the field.
The problem lies in the inadequacy of laboratory experiments and the limited
knowledge of reservoir characteristics. Field test performances of polymer, alkaline,
and micellar flooding methods have been examined for nearly 50 field tests.
The oil-recovery performance of micellar floods is the highest, followed by polymer
floods. Alkaline floods have been largely unsuccessful. The reasons underlying
success or failure are examined in the literature [117].
16.6.1 AMMONIUM CARBONATE
Ammonium carbonate decomposes in acid medium into ammonium salts and carbon
dioxide. It is thus valuable for the in situ generation of carbon dioxide [118–120].
16.6.2 HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
The physical properties of hydrogen peroxide indicate that hydrogen peroxide
injection has the potential of combining the more favorable aspects of many EOR
processes, namely:
1. steam;
2. combustion;
3. oxygen-water combustion; and
4. carbon dioxide injection.
Hydrogen peroxide decomposes to form water and oxygen. Both products are
environmentally desirable and effective in recovering oil. Heat is generated in the
oil reservoir when the decomposition reaction occurs. The available heat from the
chemical reactions supports steam and hot waterflooding operations, among others.
Continued injection of liquid hydrogen peroxide advances the heat bank, steam
zone, hot-water zone, oxygen-burning front, and CO2 bank through the formation,
effectively displacing oil [121].
Combinations of hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, and urea have been proposed
[122]. The temperature influences the urea decomposition into ammonia and carbon
dioxide that provokes pressure buildup in a formation model and a 19% increase of
oil-displacement efficiency in comparison with water.
Reactions of hydrogen peroxide with near wellbore formation and liquids create
high temperatures for lowering the oil viscosity and removing formation damage.
The application of this chemical technique for heat-bank-type flooding is noted as a
technically superior method, but it is probably not economically viable [123]. There
is a wide potential field of applications of hydrogen peroxide, including pressure
generation, hydrate melting in subsea equipment, and metal cutting for offshore
structure decommissioning [124].670 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
16.6.3 ALCOHOL-WATERFLOODING
Butanol
n-Butanol and other C4 alcohols are suitable for hot waterflooding in medium- to
heavy-oil reservoirs at depths greater than 1500 m [125].
Isopropanol and ammonia
A composition that includes an ammonia, a low-molecular weight alcohol, for
example, isopropanol, in an aqueous carrier solution has been proposed to be cost
effective for EOR [126]. The composition can be recovered and recycled to further
decrease costs. Apparently, there is no reaction with oil nor there is a significant
amount trapped in the formation. Therefore, the composition can be separated from
the oil and recycled.
Residue from the production of glycerol or ethylene glycol
Waste water-soluble alcohols are useful for miscible waterflooding [127].
16.6.4 CHEMICAL INJECTION OF WASTE GASES
Waste gas from produced hydrocarbons can be safely disposed by reinjecting it into
a formation. The waste gas is mixed with a surfactant to form a foam that then is
placed within a disposal zone of a subterranean formation. The waste gas is trapped
within the foam, thereby reducing the mobility of the gas in the formation, which, in
turn, restricts the ability of the waste gas to readily flow out of the disposal zone and
into the producing zone of the formation. The waste gas foam can be placed into the
formation by coinjecting the surfactant and the waste gas, or it can be formed in situ
by first injecting the surfactant and then injecting the waste gas [128].
Thermal conversion of organic waste material, such as plastics, or of biomass
under the influence of oxygen into crude synthesis gas yields a hydrogen gas. The
crude mixture of synthesis gas can be injected into a depleted crude oil well. In
such a well, high molecular organic material, which will not flow readily, is inside.
Hydrogen itself will crack the long chains of the sticking organics in situ and will
make it more prone to flow. In this way, improved oil recovery (IOR) and plastics
waste disposal by oxidative pyrolysis can be achieved, followed by in situ degradative
hydrogenation of geopolymers. Thus more organic material can be recovered than
was initially put into the well [129].
16.7 POLYMER WATERFLOODING
The polymer in a polymer waterflooding process acts primarily as a thickener. It
decreases the permeability of the reservoir and thus improves the vertical and lateral
sweep efficiency.
Associative copolymers of AAm with n-alkylacrylamides, terpolymers of AAm,
N-decylacrylamide, and sodium-2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonate, sodium16.7 Polymer waterflooding 671

acrylate, or sodium-3-acrylamido-3-methylbutanoate have been shown to possess the
required rheologic behavior to be suitable for EOR processes [130]. Polymers used
in polymer waterflooding are shown in Table 16.3.
Other copolymers of AAm with the zwitterionic 3-(2-acrylamido-2-
methylpropyldimethyl ammonio)-1-propane sulfonate monomer also have been
examined.
16.7.1 POLYMER DEGRADATION
Oxidative degradation of polymers may become a serious concern in EOR [142].
Sodium carbonate and bicarbonate have been demonstrated to play a key role in
stabilizing polymers against multiple sources of degradation.
It seems likely that this phenomenon is caused by their effect on iron solubility.
Brines containing iron in the reduced state are often obtained from aquifers for use
in polymer hydration. These brines may cause an immediate degradation if exposed
to air during or after polymer hydration because of the oxidation of soluble iron.
Preaeration could be a feasible strategy to minimize the degradation of the
polymers during hydration. Care must be taken to ensure that the degradation is not
caused by the injection of a polymeric solution that contains oxygen. Also, the use
of sodium carbonate may mitigate a degradation resulting from Fe2+ during polymer
hydration [142].
16.7.2 LOW-TENSION POLYMER FLOOD TECHNIQUE
The low-tension polymer flood technique consists of combining low levels of
polymer-compatible surfactants and a polymer with a waterflood. This affects
mobility control and reduces front-end and total costs [143]. The synergism of
surfactant polymer complex formation has been studied by gel permeation chro￾matography [144].672 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
16.7.3 INFLUENCE OF VISCOSITY ON IONIC STRENGTH
The viscosity and non-Newtonian flooding characteristics of polymer solutions
decrease significantly in the presence of inorganic salts, alkali silicates, and multi￾valent cations. The effect can be traced back to the repression of the dissociation
of polyelectrolytes, to the formation of a badly dissociating polyelectrolyte metal
complex, and to the separation of such a complex from the polymer solution [145].
16.7.4 pH-RESPONSIVE AMPHIPHILIC SYSTEMS
The complexation and supramolecular assembly of an amino-amide and maleic acid
can be used to control the viscosity of aqueous displacement fluids [146]. The
addition of only 2% of an adaptable amphiphile/maleic acid into water increases
the viscosity of water by a factor of 4.5 × 105. This superior viscosity behavior is
ascribed to the formation and entanglements of layered cylindrical supramolecular
assemblies with diameters of several hundred nanometers. Furthermore, the viscosity
of the amphiphile solution can be increased 12 times by changing pH from 4 to
8 in a reversible manner. Such a property can be very beneficial for oil-recovery
applications when the injectivity becomes a limitation.
Effect of gas on the injectivity
Many operations involve the injection of fluids into the formation around a well. In
many cases, the fluids contain colloidal particles, either initially present or introduced
during the operation through dirt or naturally occurring particles [147]. Therefore, all
injection schemes potentially suffer from injectivity decline. This injectivity decline
is caused by clogging of the formation by particles, forming an external filter cake
on the surface of the formation and blocking the pores inside the formation.
The effects of gas on the injectivity of particles in sandstone have been inves￾tigated [147]. Experiments in which water containing micron-sized particles, that
is, hematite was injected into sandstone cores with or without small gas bubbles of
nitrogen present in the water were performed. The position and amount of particle
deposition could be determined both visually and also by chemical analysis.
It was found that the presence of gas reduces the external filter cake formed on the
inlet surface of the core. Also, in the presence of gas, the particles penetrate deeper
inside the core and more particles are passing through the core and are detected in
the effluent stream. These effects are enhanced when the mixture of gas bubbles and
water is replaced by foam. These findings suggest that the presence of gas water
interfaces has a major influence on the retention of particles in the sandstone [147].
16.7.5 MODIFIED ACRYLICS
A modified AAm polymer that is hydrophobically associating has remarkably
improved the properties of salt resistance and temperature resistance, compared with
high-molecular weight PAM [148].16.7 Polymer waterflooding 673
Shear stability
An experimental study of shear stability of several high-molecular weight polymers
used as mobility control agents in EOR projects has been performed in well￾controlled conditions [149,150]. The shearing device was made of a capillary tube
with an internal diameter of 125 μm, through which polymer solution was injected
at a controlled rate. The setup enables a precise measurement of the shear rate to
which the polymer macromolecule is submitted. The degradation rate was measured
by the viscosity loss induced by the passage into the capillary tube. The shear rate
was gradually increased up to 106 per s while checking the degradation rate at each
stage.
Various commercial EOR polymer products were tested with a poly(acrylamide)
backbone and different substitution monomer groups [149,150]. All macromolecules
behave as flexible coils in solution. The polymers were poly(acrylamide) substituted
with acrylate, acrylamide tertiary butyl sulfonic acid (ATBS)/sulfonate, and N-vinyl￾2-pyrrolidone.
The shear degradation of the polymers increases with molecular weight and salin￾ity, but decreases with the presence of acrylate, ATBS, and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone.
These results can be interpreted in terms of chain flexibility.
A poly(acrylamide) homopolymer is the most sensitive to shear degradation
because it is highly flexible. The introduction of acrylate groups in the polymer
chain induces some stability, because of the rigidity provided by charge repulsion.
This which vanishes in the presence of a high-salinity environment, because of the
negative charges. ATBS and pyrrolidone groups are larger in size and provide a
significant chain rigidity and so a better shear stability.
In comparison, xanthan gum, which behaves like a semirigid rod, has been
shown to be much less sensitive to the shear-degradation test than the coiled
poly(acrylamide)s [8,151].
16.7.6 BIOPOLYMERS
Pseudozan
Pseudozan is an exopoly(saccharide) produced by a Pseudomonas species. It has high
viscosities at low concentrations in formation brines, forms stable solutions over a
wide pH range, and is relatively stable at temperatures up to 65 ◦C. The polymer
is not shear degradable and has a pseudoplastic behavior. The polymer has been
proposed for EOR processes for mobility control [152].
Xanthan
Xanthan exhibits an interaction with anionic surfactants, which is a beneficial
synergistic effect for mobility control in chemical-EOR processes [153].674 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
16.8 COMBINATION FLOODING
Combination flooding comprises the combination of at least two basic techniques
from gas flooding, caustic flooding, surfactant flooding, polymer flooding, and foam
flooding. There may be synergisms between the various chemical reagents used.
There are specific terms that clarify the individual combination of the basic methods,
such as surfactant-enhanced alkaline flooding, alkaline-assisted thermal oil recovery,
and others. Methods for combined flooding are summarized in Table 16.4.
16.8.1 LOW-TENSION POLYMER FLOOD
Coinjection of a surfactant and a biopolymer, followed by a polymer buffer for
mobility control leads to reduced chemical consumption and high oil recovery. There
may be synergistic effects between the surfactant and the polymer in a dynamic flood
situation. The chromatographic separation of surfactant and polymer is important to
obtain good oil recovery and low surfactant retention [154].
In buffered surfactant-enhanced alkaline flooding, it was found that the minimum
in IFT and the region of spontaneous emulsification correspond to a particular pH
range. So by buffering the aqueous pH against changes in alkali concentration, a low
IFT can be maintained when the amount of alkali decreases because of acids, rock
consumption, and dispersion [155].
16.8.2 EFFECT OF ALKALINE AGENTS ON THE RETENTION
The effectiveness of alkaline additives tends to increase with increasing pH. However,
for most reservoirs, the reaction of the alkaline additives with minerals is a serious
problem for strong alkalis, and a flood needs to be operated at the lowest effective
pH, approximately 10. The ideal process by which alkaline agents reduce losses of
surfactants and polymers in oil recovery by chemical injection has been detailed in
the literature [156].

16.8.3 ALKALINE STEAMFLOODING
The performance of steamflooding often suffers from channeling and gravity seg￾regation. Alkaline additives may be used with steam for certain types of crude
oils to improve the steamflood performance. Experimental results show that sodium
orthosilicate outperforms sodium hydroxide and sodium metasilicate [157].
16.8.4 SEDIMENT-FORMING MATERIALS
Aluminum trichloride and trisodium phosphate can be injected as sediment-forming
material [158].
16.8.5 WATER-ALTERNATING GAS TECHNOLOGY
The oil production from thin under-gas cap zones with an active aquifer is not
efficient because of the rapid breakthrough of gas or water. The water-alternating
gas technology based on the injection of water solution with oil- and water-soluble
polymers seems to be promising to stimulate such wells. For heavy oils, this
technology can be considered as an alternative to thermal EOR [159].
16.8.6 LOW TENSION GAS FLOODING
Low tension gas (LTG) can be used for submiscible tertiary recovery in tight
sandstone and carbonate reservoirs [160].
The LTG process involves the use of a surfactant and a gas to mobilize and
eventually displace the residual crude after a waterflood process at greatly reduced
oil-water IFT. This method allows extending the surfactant-EOR method in sub
20 mD formations, in which the use of a polymer is impractical because of plugging,
shear, or the requirement to use only a polymer with low molecular weight.
The strategy has been tested through the coinjection of nitrogen and a slug
surfactant solution. The results indicated a favorable mobilization and displacement
of the residual crude oil in both tight carbonate and tight sandstone reservoirs.
A tertiary recovery of 75-90% of the residual oil in place could be achieved for
cores with a permeability of 2-15 mD. LTG tertiary recovery has been compared
with the results from reference surfactant flooding, using no gas, where only 28% of
the residual oil in place could be recovered. Further, with immiscible gas coinjection
flooding without surfactant 13% recovery was found [160].
In addition, a high initial oil saturation was tested to assess the process tolerance
to oil and to evaluate the potential for an application during secondary recovery.
Under such conditions, this method achieved a recovery of 84% [160]. This suggests
a potential application of this process for secondary recovery.
16.8.7 CYCLIC STEAM INJECTION
The effect of nickel nanoparticles on in situ upgrading of heavy oil during aquather￾molysis and the effect of this process on the recovery through cyclic steam injection676 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
were studied [161]. High-temperature experiments were conducted with a bench-top
reactor to study the kinetics of the reactions among oil, water, and sandstones in the
presence and absence of the nickel nanoparticles.
Kinetic analysis showed that nickel nanoparticles reduce the activation energy of
the reactions corresponding to the generation of hydrogen sulfide by approximately
50%. This reaction was the breakage of C−S bonds in the organosulfur compounds
of the heavy oil. The maximal catalysis effect was observed to be at a temperature
of approximately 270 ◦C [161]. Also, the simulated-distillation gas chromatography
analysis of the oil sample, after the aquathermolysis reactions, confirmed the catalysis
effect of nickel nanoparticles.
Also, the effect of the catalytic aquathermolysis on the recovery factor of the
steam-stimulation technique was studied. The results showed that the nickel nanopar￾ticles increased the recovery factor by approximately 22% when the nanoparticles
were injected with a cationic surfactant and xanthan gum polymer [161].
16.8.8 HYDROCARBON-ASSISTED STEAM INJECTION
In steam injection, the mobility of the hydrocarbons is greater if a C1–C25 hydro￾carbon is added than if steam is used alone under substantially similar formation
conditions [162–164].
16.9 FOAM FLOODING
Earlier reviews on the state of the art of foam flooding, can be found in the
literature [165].
16.9.1 OPTIMAL DESIGN OF FOAMS
A thorough understanding of foam fundamentals is crucial to the optimal design
of foams for IOR or EOR. Anomalous foam-fractional-flow solutions have been
presented that deviate significantly from the conventional solutions at high-injection
foam qualities by comparing method-of-characteristics and mechanistic bubble￾population-balance simulations. The results from modeling and simulations derived
from coreflood experiments revealed the following [166]:
1. There are three regions—Region A with relatively wet (or high fw) injection
conditions in which the solutions are consistent with the conventional
fractional-flow theory; Region C with very dry (or low fw) injection conditions
in which the solutions deviate significantly; and Region B in between, which has
a negative dfw/dSw slope showing physically unstable solutions.
2. For dry-injection conditions in Region C, the solutions require a constant state
(IJ) between initial (I) and injection (J) conditions, forcing a shock from I to IJ16.9 Foam flooding 677
by intersecting fractional flow curves, followed by spreading waves or another
shock to reach from IJ to J.
3. The location of IJ in fw vs. Sw domain moves to the left (or toward lower Sw) as
the total injection velocity increases for both weak and strong foams until it
reaches limiting water saturation.
Even though foams at high-injection quality are popular for mobility control
associating a minimum amount of surfactant solutions, foam behaviors at dry
conditions have not been thoroughly investigated and understood. The results of the
study are believed to be helpful to the successful planning of foam IOR/EOR field
applications [166].
16.9.2 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF FOAM FLOW
The effects in carbonate rocks on the wettability on oil recovery when using foam
were studied [167].
The oil recovery by water, surfactant, or gas injection exhibited only a low
recovery, less than 10% of OOIP. Oil recovery during injection of pregenerated foam
was improved significantly, with up to 78% of OOIP produced. The presence of foam
reduced the gas mobility in the fractured rock, increased differential pressure, and
diverted flow into the oil-saturated matrix. However, a significant amount of foam
injection was required for the additional oil recovery. The generation of foam in situ
was weak in the smooth-walled fractures, and no fluid diversion from the fractures
with additional oil recovery was observed [167].
16.9.3 BASIC PRINCIPLES OF FOAM FLOODING
A process for enhancing the recovery of oil in a subterranean formation comprises
injecting a foam having oil-imbibing and transporting properties. A foam having such
properties is selected either by determination of the lamella number or by micro￾visualization techniques. The method for selecting a surfactant capable of forming a
foam functional to both imbibe and transport an oil phase in a subterranean formation
comprises [168]:
1. determining the surface tension of the foaming solution;
2. measuring the radius of a foam lamella plateau border where it initially contacts
the oil or of an emulsified drop;
3. determining the IFT between the foaming solution and the oil; and
4. correlating these measurements with a mathematical model to obtain a value
indicative of the oil-imbibing properties of the foam.
The foam, having a viscosity greater than the displacing medium, will preferen￾tially accumulate in the well-swept and higher permeability zones of the formation.
The displacing medium is thus forced to move into the unswept or underswept areas
of the formation. It is from these latter areas that the additional oil is recovered.
However, when a foam is used to fill a low oil content area of the reservoir, the678 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
oil contained therein is, for all practical purposes, lost. This is because the foam
functions to divert the displacement fluid from such areas [169–171].
Foam stability in the presence of oil can be described from thermodynamics
in terms of the spreading and entering coefficients S and E, respectively. These
coefficients are defined as follows:
S = Yo
F − YOF − Yo
O, (16.1)
wherein Yo
F is the foaming solution surface tension, YOF is the foaming solution-oil
IFT, and Yo
O is the surface tension of the oil.
E = Yo
F + YOF − Yo
O. (16.2)
Based on these coefficients, one can predict that three types of oil-foam interactions
could take place. First, (Type A) an oil will neither spread over nor enter the surface
of foam lamellae when E and S are less than zero. Secondly, (Type B) oil will enter
but not spread over the surface of foam lamellae when E is greater than zero but S is
less than zero. Thirdly, (Type C) oil will enter the surface of foam lamellae and then
spread over the lamellae surfaces if both E and S are greater than zero. This latter
behavior will destabilize the foam.
However, experimental results have not borne out these predictions. Furthermore,
the theory was developed assuming that the oil droplets are readily imbibed into
the foam lamellae. Again, however, experimental results show that some foams,
particularly those of type A do not readily imbibe oil.
There exists, therefore, a need to distinguish between foams which are stable to
oil but do not significantly imbibe oil, as in type A, foams which are stable to oil and
do imbibe oil as in the second type above and finally, foams that are unstable to oil
as in the third predicted type [168]. A foam drive method comprises the following
steps [168]:
1. injecting into the reservoir an aqueous polymer solution as preceding slug;
2. periodically injecting simultaneously or alternately a noncondensable gas and a
foaming composition solution containing alkalis, surfactants, and polymers to
form combined foam or periodically injecting the gas and the foam previously
formed from the solution; and
3. injecting a polymer solution as a protecting slug and then continuing with
waterflooding.
16.9.4 AIR FOAM INJECTION
By isothermal combustion experiments, the influence of clay mineral and foam on
low temperature oxidation (LTO) reactions has been investigated [172].
It has been shown that the presence of clay minerals could speed the process of
the LTO reaction, while the presence of foam will slow down this process. The LTO
reaction is not significantly associated with oil viscosity. The concentration of O2 was16.9 Foam flooding 679
near zero when the gas breakthrough occurred. Once the oxidation region reached the
outlet, the concentration of O2 suddenly increased, and the effect of O2 consumption
became worse. The injection of air foam could effectively plug the high-permeability
tube and restart the low-permeability tube [172].
16.9.5 AMBIENT PRESSURE FOAM TESTS
Several surfactants were studied in ambient pressure foam tests, including alcohol
ethoxylates, alcohol ethoxy sulfates, alcohol ethoxyethylsulfonates, and alcohol
ethoxyglycerylsulfonates [173]. Surfactants that performed well in the 1 atm foaming
experiment were also good foaming agents in site cell and coreflood experiments
performed in the presence of CO2 and reservoir fluids under realistic reservoir
temperature and pressure conditions.
Laboratory studies of foam flow in porous media suggest that the relative foam
mobility is approximately inversely proportional to the permeability. This means that
foam has potential as a flow-diverting agent, in principle sweeping low-permeability
regions as effectively as high-permeability regions [174].
Foam mobility control
A switchable cationic surfactant, such as a tertiary amine surfactant (Ethomeen®
C12) has been described that can be injected in high-pressure CO2 for foam mobility
control [175]. The surfactant can dissolve in high-pressure CO2 as a nonionic
surfactant and then equilibrate with the brine as a cationic surfactant.
The adsorption characteristics of this surfactant in carbonate-formation materials
has been investigated [175]. The adsorption of this surfactant is sensitive to the
equilibrium pH, the electrolyte composition of the brine, and the minerals in
carbonate-formation materials.
As such, the pure surfactant is a nonionic surfactant. When it is mixed with brine,
the solution has a high pH and limited solubility. However, when the surfactant
solution in brine is equilibrated with high-pressure CO2, the pH goes down to
approximately 4. The surfactant switches into a cationic surfactant and becomes
soluble.
Thus, the adsorption is also a function of pH. The adsorption of the surfactant
on calcite at low pH is low (0.5 mg m−2). However, if the carbonate formation
contains silica or clays, the adsorption becomes high, which is typical for cationic
surfactants.
The adsorption on silica decreases with an increase in divalent and trivalent
cations, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+. This occurs because of the competition for the
negatively charged silica sites between the multivalent cations and the monovalent
cationic surfactant.
Additionally, the presence of divalent cations in a brine reduces the dissolution
of calcite or dolomite in the presence of high-pressure CO2. The dissolution
of calcite and dolomite is harmful because of formation damage and increased
alkalinity [175].680 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
Foam propagation
Studies of the nitrogen-foam propagation in natural sandstones in the absence of oil
have been described [176]. An C14–C16 α-olefin sulfonate surfactant was selected
to stabilize the foam. X-ray computer tomography images were taken during foam
propagation to map the saturation of the liquid in the course of time. The experiments
revealed that the foam mobility decreases in two steps [176]:
1. During initial forward foam propagation, foam mobility decreases by an order of
magnitude compared with water mobility.
2. During a secondary backward liquid desaturation, it decreases further by one to
two orders of magnitude for sufficiently high surfactant concentrations.
The steady-state mobility reduction factor increases considerably with both
surfactant concentration and total injection velocity. A hysteresis was observed for a
cycle of increasing or decreasing surfactant concentration or total injection velocity.
The observed effects can be interpreted mechanistically in terms of surfactant
adsorption and foam rheology [176].
In a layered, 2D heterogeneous sand pack with a 19:1 permeability contrast
that was preferentially oil-wet, the recovery by waterflood was only 49.1% of
OOIP [177].
This was obviously because of injected water flowing through the high￾permeability zone, leaving the low-permeability zone unswept. To enhance the
oil recovery, an anionic surfactant blend was injected that altered the wettability and
lowered the IFT.
Once the IFT was reduced to ultralow values, the adverse effect of capillarity
retaining oil was eliminated. Gravity-driven vertical countercurrent flow then ex￾changed fluids between high- and low-permeability zones during a 42-day system
shut-in.
Cumulative recovery after a subsequent foam flood was 94.6% OOIP, even though
foam strength was weak. Recovery with chemical flood (incremental recovered
oil/waterflood remaining oil) was 89.4% [177].
An alternative method is to apply a foam mobility control as a robust viscous￾force-dominant process with no initial surfactant injection and shut-in. The light
crude oil studied was extremely detrimental to foam generation. However, the
addition of lauryl betaine made this blend a good foaming agent with and without
the presence of the crude oil [177].
Trapped gas in foam
Gas trapping by foam is a key mechanism of foam mobility and foam effectiveness
in applications such as acid diversion in well stimulation, EOR, and aquifer remedi￾ation [178].
It was tried to quantify the extent of gas trapping by injecting a tracer gas within
the foam and then fitting the effluent profile to a one-dimensional capacitance model.
In this model, at any given axial position along the core, all of the flowing gas and
all trapped gas are each characterized by a single tracer concentration. However,16.9 Foam flooding 681
computer tomography images of the experiments with a xenon tracer show that
this characterization is not accurate. The trapped gas near the flowing gas comes
rapidly to equilibrium with flowing gas long before tracer diffuses into the trapped
gas farther away.
A method has been presented that uses the computer tomography images directly
to estimate flowing-gas fraction [178]. In the computer tomography images, the tracer
moves in many small channels and diffuses outward into surrounding regions of
trapped gas a few millimeters in diameter.
The difference between the higher tracer concentration at the center of these
channels and the lower concentration at the edge can be related to the diffusion
coefficient of the tracer and the flowing-gas fraction within the channel. For the
computer tomography images of xenon tracer in one experiment, this method gives
flowing-gas fractions one or two orders of magnitude smaller than what is estimated
using the one-dimensional capacitance model. The model can be used to estimate
flowing-gas fraction in different regions of a core in spite of different average gas
velocities in the different regions [178].
Sand pack model
A one-dimensional sand pack model has been used to investigate the behavior of four
anionic sulfonate surfactants of varying chemical structure with steam. The study was
performed with a crude oil at a ROS of approximately 12% of the pore volume. The
observed pressure drops across the various sections of the pack were used to study
the behavior of the surfactant. The tested surfactants varied in chain length, aromatic
structure, and number of ionic charges.
A linear toluene sulfonate produced the highest strength foam in the presence of
oil at residual saturations, in comparison with α-olefin sulfonates. This is in contrast
to the behavior of the surfactants in the absence of oil, where the α-olefin sulfonates
perform better. The reason for this change in behavior is the relative propagation rate
of the foams produced by the surfactants [179,180].
Foaming agents
When an oil reservoir is subjected to steam injection, the steam tends to move up in
the formation, whereas condensate and oil tend to move down due to the density
difference between the fluids. Gradually, a steam override condition develops, in
which the injected steam sweeps the upper portion of the formation but leaves
the lower portion untouched. Injected steam will tend to follow the path of least
resistance from the injection well to a production well [181].
Thus, areas of high permeability will receive more and more of the injected steam
which further raises the permeability of such areas. This phenomenon exists to an
even larger degree with low injection rates and thick formations. The steam override
problem worsens at greater radial distances from the injection well because steam
flux decreases with increasing steam zone radius.
Although ROS in the steam swept region can be as low as 10%, the average ROS
in the formation remains much higher due to poor vertical conformance. This it is682 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
because of the creation of steam override zones. The vertical conformance in steam
floods is usually poor.
A similar conformance problem exists with carbon dioxide flooding. CO2 has a
large tendency to channel through oil in place since carbon dioxide viscosity may be
10-50 times lower than the viscosity of the oil in place. This problem of channeling
through oil is exacerbated by the inherent tendency of a highly mobile fluid such as
carbon dioxide to preferentially flow through more permeable rock sections.
These two factors, namely unfavorable mobility ratios between carbon dioxide
and the oil in place and the tendency of carbon dioxide to take advantage of perme￾ability variations, often make carbon dioxide flooding uneconomical. Conformance
problems increase as the miscibility of the carbon dioxide with the oil in place
decreases.
Although not much attention has been devoted to carbon dioxide conformance,
it has long been the concern of the oil industry to improve the conformance of a
steamflood by reducing the permeability of the steam swept zone by various means.
The injection of numerous chemicals such as foams, foaming solutions, gelling
solutions, or plugging or precipitating solutions have been tried.
Because of the danger of damaging the reservoir, it is considered important to
have a nonpermanent method of lowering the permeability in the steam override
zones. For this reason, certain plugging agents are deemed not acceptable. In order
to successfully divert steam and improve the vertical conformance, the injected
chemical should be:
1. stable at high steam temperatures of 150-315 ◦C,
2. effective in reducing permeability in steam swept zones;
3. nondamaging to the oil reservoir; and
4. economical.
The literature is replete with references to various foaming agents which are
employed to lower permeability in steam swept zones. The vast majority of the
foaming agents require the injection of a noncondensable gas to generate the foam in
conjunction with the injection of steam and the foaming agent [181].
C12 to C15 alcohols and α-olefin sulfonate are highly effective with steam
foaming agents or carbon dioxide foaming agents in reducing the permeability of
flood-swept zones [181]. The sodium salt of tall oil acid is suitable as a foam
surfactant. Experimental results show that sodium tallates are effective foaming
agents that can produce pressure gradients of hundreds of pounds per square inch
per foot in a sand pack [182].
The foam-holding characteristics of foam from surfactants in oilfield jobs can
be tailored by adding an imidazoline-based amphoacetate surfactant. Amphoacetates
are a special class of amphoteric tensides (Figure 16.3). Imidazoles, such as
2-heptylimidazoline, cf. Figure 16.4, are reacted with fatty acids under the ring
opening. For alkylation, the imidazoline is reacted with, for example, chloroacetate
[183]. Residues from the production of caprolactam have been proposed as surfac￾tants [184].16.9 Foam flooding 683

Fluorocarbon surfactant
A foam can be generated by using an inert gas and a fluorocarbon surfactant
solution in admixture with an amphoteric or anionic hydrocarbon surfactant solution.
A relatively small amount of the fluorocarbon surfactant is operative when mixed
with the hydrocarbon surfactant and foamed. The foam has a better stability than a
foam made with hydrocarbon surfactant alone when in contact with oil [185].
16.9.6 ALKALINE STEAM FOAMING
Experimental studies have shown that the steam foam process can be enhanced
significantly by injecting a suitably formulated alkali surfactant mixture in the
aqueous phase of steam [186].
It has been shown that alkaline steam foam offers significant advantages over
a regular steam foam by combining the benefits of thermal- and chemical-EOR
processes.
Na2CO3 reduces the consumption of surfactant by adsorption by rendering the
clay surface more negatively charged. Also, by precipitating divalent ions that
get ion exchanged off the clays, Na2CO3 reduces the surfactant consumption by
precipitation [186].
A suitably formulated alkali surfactant system reduces the oil-water IFT suffi￾ciently to enable the heavy oil to be emulsified into the aqueous phase in the presence684 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
of steam. Such an oil-in-water emulsion is less viscous than the oil alone and can be
readily transported.
Thus, the ROS is reduced to a value less than that of steam. The lower ROS
reduces the destabilizing effect of oil on foam, resulting in a stronger steam foam
that provides a better mobility control than a regular steam foam. The reduction in
gravity override also reduces the loss of heat to the cap rock, thereby improving the
efficiency [186].
16.9.7 POLYMER-ENHANCED FOAMS
Some of the parameters affecting the foam performance are polymer concentration,
the chemical nature of the surfactants and their concentration, aqueous phase salinity
and pH, and shear rate [187]. The performance of polymer-enhanced foams was
shown to be much better in comparison with conventional foams. PAM polymers
were used as an additive.
Higher foam resistance and longer foam persistence were achieved by using
relatively low concentrations of polymers. The studies also showed that the foam
performance was significantly improved over a broad range of polymer concentra￾tions. Foams are severely affected in the presence of oil, but polymer-enhanced foam
reduced the negative impact of oils on foam mobility. Polymer-enhanced foams are
suitable for plugging fracture reservoirs [188].
16.10 CARBON DIOXIDE FLOODING
In the 1990s, certain research groups focused on the development of CO2-soluble
polymers usable as direct thickeners, in particular, ionomers [189].
Sandstone rock surfaces are normally highly water-wet. These surfaces can
be altered by treatment with solutions of chemical surfactants or by asphaltenes.
Increasing the pH of the chemical treating solution decreases the water wettability of
the sandstone surface and, in some cases, makes the surface medium oil-wet [190].
Thus, the chemical treatment of sandstone cores can increase the oil production when
flooded with carbon dioxide.
A cosolvent used as a miscible additive to CO2 changed the properties of the
supercritical gas phase. The addition of a cosolvent resulted in increased viscosity
and density of the gas mixture and enhanced extraction of the oil compounds into
the CO2-rich phase. Gas phase properties were measured in an equilibrium cell
with a capillary viscometer and a high-pressure densitometer. Cosolvent miscibility
with CO2, brine solubility, cosolvent volatility, and relative quantity of the cosolvent
partitioning into the oil phase are factors that must be considered for the successful
application of cosolvents. The results indicate that additives with low molecular
weight, such as propane, are the most effective cosolvents to increase oil recov￾ery [191].16.11 Steamflooding 685
By adding common solvents as chemical modifiers, the flooding fluid shows a
marked improvement in solvency for heavy components of crudes because of its
increased density and polarity [192]. Miscible or immiscible carbon dioxide injection
is considered to be one of the most effective technologies to improve the oil recovery
from complicated formations and hard-to-recover oil reserves. Application of this
technology can increase the ultimate oil recovery by 10-15%. One of the main
advantages of this technology is that it can be applied in a wide range of geologic
conditions for producing both light and heavy oils.
The main factors restraining the wide application of CO2 flooding are the
dependence on natural CO2 sources, transportation of CO2, safety and environmental
problems, breakthrough of CO2 to the production wells, and corrosion of well and
field equipment. This restrains the wide implementation of CO2 injection technology,
not only in many European countries, but also worldwide, where this technology
could significantly improve oil production and ultimate oil recovery from depleted
oil formations.
Another technology for in situ CO2 generation has been developed and described.
It is based on an exothermic chemical reaction between gas-forming water solution
and low-concentration active acids [193].
Hydrocarbons and other fluids are recovered at a production well by a mixture
of CO2 and 0.1-20% trichloroethane at a temperature and pressure above the
bubblepoint of the mixture, which ensures that the mixture will be in a single
phase [194].
16.11 STEAMFLOODING
16.11.1 CARBON DIOXIDE
When the temperature of a carbonate reservoir that is saturated with high-viscosity
oil and water increases to 200 ◦C or more, chemical reactions occur in the formation,
resulting in the formation of considerable amounts of CO2. The generation of CO2
during thermal stimulation of a carbonate reservoir results from the dealkylation
of aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of water vapor, catalytic conversion of
hydrocarbons by water vapor, and oxidation of organic materials.
Clay material and metals of variable valence, for example, nickel, cobalt, iron, in
the carbonate rock can serve as the catalyst. An optimal amount of CO2 exists for
which maximal oil recovery is achieved [195]. The performance of a steamflooding
process can be improved by the addition of CO2 or methane [196].
16.11.2 AIR INJECTION
Air as a steam additive results in an increased rate at which oil is recovered because
of LTO reactions [197].686 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
16.11.3 CHEMICAL REACTIONS
The reactivity of steam can be reduced via pH control. The injection or addition
of a buffer, such as ammonium chloride inhibits the dissolution of certain mineral
groups, controls the migration of fines, inhibits the swelling of clays, controls
chemical reactions in which new clay minerals are formed, and helps to prevent
the precipitation of asphaltenes and the formation of emulsions as a result of steam
injection [198].
The reaction of sulfate with sulfide is strongly pH dependent, and the oxidation
potential of sulfate in the neutral pH region is very low. At atmospheric pressure
and temperatures up to the boiling points of the inorganic and organic media, no
reaction takes place within 100 h. However, the reaction may proceed very slowly
over geochemical time periods.
During the steamflooding processes, large amounts of H2S are produced together
with CO2 and small amounts of elemental hydrogen. In the producing zones,
the temperatures lie in the range of 250-270 ◦C, which is significantly below the
conditions described in the literature. The H2S production rises from 50 ppm to up
to 300,000 ppm, causing enormous corrosion and health safety risks [199]. Addition
of 2-5% urea with respect to water is claimed to reduce the viscosity of the heavy
hydrocarbon by at least 50% [200].
16.12 IN SITU COMBUSTION
A significant increase in light oil production can be achieved with air injection. A
total consumption of 5-10% of the remaining oil in place can be expected to maintain
a propagation of the in situ oxidation process. The flue gas and steam generated at
the combustion front strip, swell, and heat the contacted oil. The light oil is displaced
at near-miscible conditions with complete utilization of injected oxygen [201].
16.12.1 ANALYSIS OF IN SITU COMBUSTION IN A FRACTURED CORE
Approximately one-third of global heavy-oil resources can be found in fractured
reservoirs. In spite of its strategic importance, the recovery of heavy crude oils from
fractured reservoirs has found only few applications because of the complexity of
such reservoirs.
In situ combustion (ISC) is a candidate process for such reservoirs, especially
for those where steam injection is not feasible. Experimental studies reported in the
literature on this topic mentioned a cone-shaped combustion front, indicating that
the process was governed by diffusion of oxygen into the matrix. The main oil￾production mechanisms were found to be thermal expansion of oil and evaporation
of light components.
In order to confirm these results, reservoir-simulation studies have been done
[202]. It has been shown that the front has the shape of a cone, and a combustion
extinction analysis has been performed.16.13 Special techniques 687
The studies revealed that combustion advances faster in a nonconsolidated matrix,
in which the permeability is higher than in consolidated matrix. The presence of
severe heterogeneities may prevent the combustion front from propagating [203].
16.13 SPECIAL TECHNIQUES
16.13.1 VISCOUS OIL RECOVERY
Special techniques have been developed for the recovery of viscous oils. In particular,
viscous oils are candidates for thermal methods.
Low-temperature oxidation
Cap gas
Both crude and asphaltene-free oil were used to determine the consequences of LTO.
It was found that the oxygen content in an artificial gas cap was completely consumed
by chemical reactions, that is, oxidation, condensation, and water formation, before
the asphaltene content had reached equilibrium.
The application of a pillow (cap) gas containing air and oxygen, for improving the
gravitational segregation in offshore production technology, may offer an appropriate
alternative to increase the recovery factor in heavy-oil-bearing reservoirs [204].
Special surfactant formulations
An alkaline PAM solution in liquid hydrocarbons has been suggested for EOR [205].
Special surfactant formulations have been tried to recover heavy crude oils. Ternary
surfactant formulations, so-called mixed-surfactant-enhanced alkaline systems, were
successful in reversing the trend of increasing IFT with time that is typical in additive￾free alkaline crude oil systems.
On the other hand, the initial IFT values were higher. However, at higher tem￾peratures (65 ◦C), these ternary surfactant formulations were capable of generating
very low IFT values against the crude oil, which suggests that they could be suitable
candidates for commercial exploitation of heavy-oil-recovery processes [206].
Visbreaking
In situ visbreaking with steam and a catalyst can produce crude oils with reduced
viscosity [207]. A special variety of visbreaking that involves a partial steam reform￾ing, which produces smaller hydrocarbon components and additional hydrogen-free
radicals and carbon dioxide, has been described.
16.13.2 LOW-PERMEABILITY FLOODING
Oil recovery from diatomaceous formations is usually quite limited because a
significant portion of oil saturation may be bypassed using conventional production
techniques such as primary, waterflooding, cyclic or drive steaming. Significant im-688 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
provement of oil recovery would require that a method of displacing oil from the inte￾rior of the diatoms into the flow channels between the diatoms be provided [208,209].
Furthermore, it would be necessary to improve the permeability in the natural flow
channels so that the oil can be recovered. A combination of chemical additives is used
to increase water wetness of a rock thereby increasing the capillary pressure which
forces oil and water from the diatomaceous formation. These chemical additives
include wetting agents and surfactants. Wetting agents are mono-, di-, tri-basic forms
of sodium or potassium phosphate and sodium silicate.
These surfactants can be either sulfonates, ammonium salts of linear alcohol,
ethoxy sulfates, or calcium phenol ethoxylated alkyl sulfonates. The surfactants
lower the IFT between oil and water thereby allowing oil to flow more freely through
the diatomaceous matrix. Imbibition experiments with up to 3% of active surfactant
concentration indicate a 31% improvement in oil recovery over that obtainable with
brine alone [208,209].
It has also been proposed to inject a solvent [210], for example, jet fuel, petroleum
naphtha, aromatic hydrocarbons, or naphthenic hydrocarbons, before injecting the
surfactant solution.
16.13.3 PERMEABILITY REDUCTION
Some processes have been developed with the aim of reducing the permeability in a
substantial proportion of the thief zone and at a significant distance from the injection
and production wells. One example of this is the Deep Diverting Gel process.
The use of swellable crosslinked superabsorbent polymer microparticles for
modifying the permeability of subterranean formations has been described [211].
However, the swelling of the superabsorbent microparticles is induced by changes of
the carrier fluid from hydrocarbon to aqueous or from water of high salinity to water
of low salinity.
More recently, highly crosslinked expandable polymeric microparticles with
labile and nonlabile crosslinkers with an unexpanded average particle-size diameters
of about 0.05-5000 μm have been described [212].
The crosslinked polymeric microparticles may be anionic or cationic. The anionic
polymeric microparticle may be prepared by free radical polymerization from non￾ionic monomers and anionic monomers. The nonionic monomer may be acrylamide
and the anionic monomer may be 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid.
Cationic polymeric microparticles may be prepared by free radical polymerization of
nonionic monomers with cationic monomers. The cationic monomer may be diallyl
dimethyl ammonium chloride.
As nonlabile crosslinking agent methylene bisacrylamide can be used. The labile
crosslinking agents are hydrolytically labile silyl ethers or silyl esters. The labile
crosslinks begin to break upon exposure to preselected conditions of temperature or
pH, thereby permitting the microparticles to expand in a controlled fashion.
A representative silyl ester material that can be readily converted into a silyl
ester crosslinker is (3-acryloxypropyl)dimethyl methoxysilane. Poly(silyl ester)16.13 Special techniques 689
crosslinkers may be prepared by transsilylation ester interchange reactions. The
preparation of poly(silyl ester)s has been described.
There are many benefits that result from the use of polymeric microparticles
having hydrolyzable silyl ester or silyl ether crosslinkers. These crosslinkers provide
copolymers having small particle-size distributions and densities a conformation that
is constrained such that the copolymer is able to efficiently traverse and propagate
through the pore structure of a hydrocarbon fluid reservoir. As the polymeric
microparticles traverse the reservoir formation and are exposed to water, increased
temperatures and varying pH levels in the formation, the hydrolytically labile
crosslinks break, thereby allowing the polymeric microparticle to expand. Upon
breakage of at least a portion of the crosslinks, the polymeric microparticles expand
to form an expanded siloxane network wherein the size of the microparticles is
greatly increased by absorption of the carrier fluid that is injected into the well.
Typically, the carrier fluid is water [212].
16.13.4 GRAVITY DRAINAGE
Gas-aided gravity drainage is a common oil-recovery technique in anticline-shaped
oil reservoirs [213]. If the permeability is low and the reservoir is oil-wet, the
remaining oil saturation can be quite high.
An anionic-surfactant formulation was developed to alter the wettability and
lower the IFT for a gasflooded, carbonate reservoir.
Various coreflood strategies were investigated [213]. Gas/surfactant/gas floods,
gas/surfactant/water/gas floods, and gas/water/surfactant/waterfloods conducted in
limestone cores recovered an additional 40-50% of the OOIP due to the injection of
surfactant. In contrast, gas/surfactant/water corefloods in a vuggy dolomite recovered
only some 20% of the OOIP.
A numerical simulation was done to match the coreflood techniques. Flooding
techniques using wettability altering surfactant exhibit high oil recovery at the
field scale. IFT reduction, wettability alteration, and foam formation contribute to
EOR [213].
Interfacial stability
Expanding-solvent steam-assisted gravity drainage (ES-SAGD) is an in situ
steam solvent recovery process to produce heavy oil and bitumen from oil sands
reservoirs [214].
In ES-SAGD, steam and solvent are injected into the depletion chamber within
the reservoir. At the chamber edge, the steam releases its latent heat, heating the oil
there, and solvent mixes with mobilized bitumen, which then flows under gravity to
the lower horizontal producer.
Many factors influence the efficiency and rate at which oil is mobilized [214].
One of them is the stability of the steam/oil interface, which is controlled by the
concentration and temperature dependencies of viscosity and density and the relative
magnitudes of viscous, buoyancy, and capillary forces.690 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
The stability of the chamber interface between the vapor chamber and the
bitumen at the edge of the chamber has been assessed. A theoretical evidence for
the occurrence of such instability and conditions at which the interface is unstable
has been found.
The steam solvent injection enhances the instability of the interface, thus
promoting greater mixing at the edge of the chamber. Consequently, the oil rate of a
steam solvent process is higher than that of a steam-only process. Therefore, there are
four fundamental contributions to enhanced production by the solvent steam process
[162,214]:
1. The oil phase viscosity is lowered.
2. The oil saturation is enhanced at the edge of the chamber.
3. The vapor/oil interface becomes more unstable, which promotes more mixing at
the chamber edge.
4. The stability of the interface is also controlled by the balance between the
solvent’s solubility in the oil phase and the ability of the solvent to reduce the
viscosity of the oil phase.
The analysis also revealed that there is an intermediate solvent between the
lightest and the heaviest ones where the instability is maximized, which further
explains peak oil rates for intermediate solvents obtained from steam solvent
experiments [162].
Gravity override
Gravity override is a severe problem in gas injection EOR processes, in particular in
relatively homogeneous formations. Foam can reduce the gravity override [215].
In 2004, it has been shown that the best foam process for overcoming gravity
override is one of injecting a large slug of surfactant followed by a large slug of gas,
injected at constant, maximum-allowable injection pressure [216].
This process works because the foam collapses near the injection well, giv￾ing good injectivity simultaneously with mobility control at the leading edge of
the gas bank.
A source of gas that is needed to maintain a constant injection pressure, which is
a concern for EOR processes where gas is produced. Sometimes, the available gas
stream may not be sufficient for optimal processing.
It has been shown that for such a process, the pressure drop across the foam bank
back to the injection well at fixed injection rate, is nearly constant as the foam bank
propagates radially outward.
From this knowledge, it is easy to predict the rate of gas injection required for
each of two limiting cases [215]:
1. An extremely strong foam at the foam front, many times more viscous than the
fluids it displaces. In this case, the rate of gas injection required to maintain
constant injection pressure is nearly constant, but injection rate is low.16.14 Microbial enhanced oil recovery techniques 691
2. A foam just strong enough to maintain mobility control at its leading edge. In
this case, injection rate required to maintain constant injection pressure increases
steeply with time.
16.14 MICROBIAL ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY TECHNIQUES
Microbiologists laid the foundations of microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR).
After the petroleum crisis in 1973, the interest in MEOR generally increased [217].
Monographs about the underlying ideas and the practice of MEOR are available
[218,219].
MEOR was first proposed in 1926 by A. Beckman [220]. Between 1943 and
1953, C.E. Zobell [221,222] laid the foundations of MEOR techniques. The results
were largely dismissed in the United States because there was little interest in finding
methods to enhance the recovery of oil at this time.
However, in some European countries, the interest for MEOR increased and
several field trials were conducted. The first MEOR waterflood field project in the
United States was initiated in 1986. The site selected was in the Mink Unit of
Delaware-Childers Field in Nowata County, Oklahoma [223].
16.14.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES AND METHODS
The very methods, ranging from a single well treatment to fieldwide treatments, can
be subsumed as MEOR techniques. The injection of microbes into the formation
is a common practice in all of these techniques. This should stimulate the in situ
microflora, resulting in the production of certain compounds that increase the oil
recovery of exhausted reservoirs. The following basic effects can be achieved by
microbes [220]:
• in situ production of gels for selective water shutoff;
• in situ production of biosurfactants for surfactant flooding;
• in situ production of acids for dissolving carbonate rocks;
• in situ production of CO2;
• in situ degradation of long chain molecules to reduce viscosity and paraffin
content;
• displacement of oil by metabolites of inoculated bacteria, grown in situ; and
• huff and puff technique:
1. Huff: migration of cells and synthesis of metabolic products following
inoculation and closing of injection well and
2. Puff: production and recovery of oil after incubation period.
It is often stressed that the technology is environmentally friendly. The stimula￾tion of oil production by in situ bacterial fermentation is thought to be initialized by
one or a combination of the following mechanisms:692 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
1. Improvement of the relative mobility of oil to water by biosurfactants and
biopolymers.
2. Partial repressurization of the reservoir by methane and CO2 gases.
3. Reduction of oil viscosity through the dissolution of organic solvents in the oil
phase.
4. Increase of reservoir permeability and widening of the fissures and channels
through the etching of carbonaceous rocks in limestone reservoirs by organic
acids produced by anaerobic bacteria.
5. Cleaning of the wellbore region through the acids and gas from in situ
fermentation: the gas serves to push oil from dead space and dislodge debris that
plugs the pores; the average pore size is increased and, as a result, the capillary
pressure near the wellbore is made more favorable for the flow of oil.
6. Selective plugging of highly permeable zones by injecting slime-forming
bacteria followed by sucrose solution that turns on the production of
extracellular slimes.
Successful microbial MEOR requires [224]:
1. The selection, injection, dispersion, metabolism, and persistence of organisms
with properties that facilitate the release of residual oil.
2. The coinjection of growth-effective nutrients into the extreme environments that
characterize petroleum reservoirs.
16.14.2 BIOAVAILABILITY OF NUTRIENT ADDITIONS
A method for controlling the microbial growth and activity during an MEOR process
has been described [225]. The specific control of the microbial growth and activity
results in a prevention of nutrient loss in transit and allows better targeting of the
microbial activity to the desired subsurface locations.
Microbial growth induced in the oil reservoir can lead to a number of changes
in the reservoir chemistry resulting in an IOR. These changes may include gas
formation, acid formation, selective pore plugging, and alterations in partitioning of
oil between petrologic and aqueous phases.
MEOR processes are usually applied later in the life of oil-recovery systems.
When easily mobilized oil becomes depleted in the oil reservoir, water is often
injected into oil reservoirs to improve the oil recovery. Injection water is also
commonly used to introduce necessary components of an MEOR process into the
reservoir. Because the access to the reservoir is limited by the frequency and number
of wells penetrating the underground formation, subterranean process control is often
difficult.
Controlled microbial growth allows better optimization of subterranean processes
that are enhanced by microbial activity. For example, MEOR processes depend on
microbial activity or the products of microbial activity to improve oil recovery in
waterflooded oil formations. Bioremediation of contaminated subsurface formations
can be accelerated by inducing microbial activity.16.14 Microbial enhanced oil recovery techniques 693
However, the loss of nutrients in transit makes the overall process less efficient
and more costly. In addition, uncontrolled microbial growth can damage the subsur￾face formation, slowing subsurface water flow and increasing backpressure on the
injection wells.
Useful nutrients are inorganic salts that contain nitrogen and phosphorus, salts
of trace elements, vitamins, such as folic acid, ascorbic acid, and riboflavin, further
buffers for environmental controls, catalysts, including enzymes [225].
Methods for the maintenance and growth of microbial cultures have been
described in detail.
Too high concentrations of nutrients may inhibit the growth of oil well associated
microbes for nutrient mixtures that typically support their growth. The nature of this
inhibition may be bacteriocidal (killing) or bacteriostatic (slowing microbial growth).
This property is important for the optimization of the activation of MEOR processes
within the oil formation or bioremediation within the contaminated subsurface
formation [225].
16.14.3 ECONOMICS
The most widely practiced technique for applying MEOR involves cyclic stimulation
treatments of producing wells. Improvements in oil production can result from
removal of paraffinic or asphaltic deposits from the near wellbore region or from
mobilization of residual oil in the limited volume of the reservoir that is treated.
An alternate method involves applying microbes in an ongoing waterflood to
improve oil recovery [226]. In the laboratory, microorganisms have been shown to
produce chemicals such as surfactants, acids, solvents (alcohols and ketones), and
gases, primarily CO2 that can be effective in mobilizing crude oil under reservoir
conditions. Microbial growth and polymer production in porous media have been
shown to improve the sweep efficiency by permeability modification. In general,
cost-effective MEOR methods are best applied in shallow, sandstone reservoirs in
mature producing fields.
The function of aerobic MEOR is based on the ability of oil-degrading bacteria to
reduce the IFT between oil and water. This process implies pumping water containing
oxygen and mineral nutrients into the oil reservoir to stimulate growth of aerobic oil￾degrading bacteria. Based on coreflood experiments, the amount of bacterial biomass
responsible for dislodging the oil can be calculated. The process is limited by the
amount of oxygen available to the bacteria to degrade the oil. The bacterial biomass
is more efficient than synthetic surfactants in dislodging the oil [227].
Experiments have shown that bacterial cells may penetrate a solid porous medium
with at least 140 mD permeability and that a bacterial population may be established
in such a medium if suitable substrates are supplied. EOR organism suitability is
governed by parameters such as capacity to produce a surfactant or cosurfactant, cell
morphology and relationship of bacterial size to pore size, and pore size distribution
of the porous rock. The activity of the organism is directly affected by conditions694 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
in the reservoir, such as oxygen availability, temperature, pressure, and substrate
availability [228].
A physical model to predict the large-scale application for MEOR has been
developed. This model simulates both the radial flow of fluids toward the wellbore
and bacteria transport through porous media [229].
Field studies of MEOR processes require routine monitoring to determine the
effects that microorganisms exert in the release of oil from petroleum-bearing forma￾tions. Careful monitoring of oil production, flow rates, oil/water ratios, temperature,
pH, viscosity, ionic strength, and other factors allows observation of real changes
that occur as a result of microbial activities after selected microbes are injected.
Simple techniques to determine microbial counts can be used to determine viability
and transport of injected microbes. The effect of injected energy sources, such as
molasses, on indigenous microbes inhabiting a reservoir can also be detected [230].
For example, a process for recovering hydrocarbons from a subterranean,
hydrocarbon-bearing formation comprises the following:
1. introducing microbes into the formation, the microbes being effective to render
at least a portion of the hydrocarbons in the formation more easily recoverable;
2. passing electrical energy through at least a portion of the formation to increase
the mobility of the microbes in the formation; and
3. recovering hydrocarbons from the formation.
The specific microbes used depend on many factors, for example, the particular
formation involved, the specific hydrocarbons in the formation, and the desired
microbial action on these formation hydrocarbons. The microbes may be aerobic
or anaerobic and may or may not require one or more additional nutrients, either
naturally occurring or injected, to be included in the formation. Highly mobile
microbes, such as flagellated or ciliated bacilli, are useful. The microbes are sized
so that they are mobile in the connate water of the formation [231].
Bacillus licheniformis produces a water-insoluble levan that has a potential
application as a selective plugging agent in MEOR. The microorganisms grow on
sucrose, glucose, and fructose but produce levan only on sucrose. Thus plugging may
be selectively controlled in the reservoir by substrate manipulation. Oil reservoirs
that have a temperature of less than 55 ◦C, a pH between 6 and 9, a pressure less than
500 atm, and a salt concentration of 4% or less are potentially suitable [232].
A possible approach to MEOR consists of the additional aeration of the water
injected into the formation, together with the addition of mineral salts of nitrogen
and phosphorus. The result is the activation of the vital activities of aerobic
microorganisms and the oxidation of the residual oil. The metabolic products of
the petroleum-oxidizing bacteria are CO2 and water-soluble organic compounds.
These compounds enter the nonoxygenated zone of the formation and can act as
oil-recovery agents. The compounds also may serve as additional substrates for
anaerobic bacteria, particularly for methanogens. The methane formed can be easily
recovered. It increases the mobility of the oil in place [233,234].16.14 Microbial enhanced oil recovery techniques 695
Potential health hazard of bacteria
Practically all life forms may be infected by one or more kinds of microorganisms.
Some of these have mutual advantage, such as in symbiosis, whereas some result
in a disease of the host. The use of bacteria in MEOR operations necessitates a
consideration of possible untoward effects against man and other living creatures.
Because large numbers of bacteria are going to be placed into the ground and possibly
come into direct contact with the oilfield workers who know little about them, it is
necessary to closely examine possible hazards that may be associated with the routine
use of bacteria in oilfield endeavors relating to EOR [235].
Metabolism
MEOR methods mainly utilize the metabolites (biosurfactant, biopolymer, organic
acid, and biogas) generated in situ or ex situ by bacteria to improve the oil
phase mobility. In situ MEOR is mainly targeted toward the residual oil left after
primary production or secondary production by waterflooding, and its success
depends strongly on the penetration and the stability of recovering agents. To
contact the trapped oil with bacteria that have favorable oil-displacement properties,
the microbes must be transported from a wellbore to locations deep within the
reservoir [236].
Salt-tolerant clostridium was shown to increase oil production by in situ produc￾tion of gas and solvents [237]. When microbial activity develops in a subsurface
geologic environment, the geologic, mineralogic, hydrologic, and geochemical
aspects of the environment will have a profound effect on the microorganisms and,
in turn, the microbial population will have some effect on the rocks and fluids. The
most significant geologic changes are [238]:
1. the precipitation of dissolved minerals, especially carbonates;
2. the change of permeability caused by precipitation in pore throats; and
3. a change of porosity, either an increase or a decrease, depending on the
equilibria of dissolved salts and products of organic acids.
Various bacterial species have proven useful in MEOR. The principle is based
on the biochemical byproducts produced by the species, such as gases, surfactants,
solvents, acids, swelling agents, and cosurfactants, which facilitate the displacement
of oil. In field experiments, in situ fermentation is often desirable for producing a
great quantity of gases. Clostridium hydrosulfuricum 39E was found to have surface
active properties during simulated EOR experiments [239].
Key mechanisms important for improved oil mobilization by microbial for￾mulations have been identified, including wettability alteration, emulsification, oil
solubilization, alteration in interfacial forces, lowering of the mobility ratio, and
permeability modification. Aggregation of the bacteria at the oil-water-rock interface
may produce localized high concentrations of metabolic chemical products that result
in oil mobilization. A decrease in relative permeability to water and an increase in
relative permeability to oil was usually observed in microbial-flooded cores, causing696 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
an apparent curve shift toward a more water-wet condition. Cores preflushed with
sodium bicarbonate showed increased oil-recovery efficiency [240].
Microorganisms inhabiting petroleum-bearing formations or introduced into
subterranean environments are subject to extremes of redox potential, pH, salinity,
temperature, pressure, ecologic pressure, geochemistry, and nutrient availability.
Successful MEOR requires the selection, injection, dispersion, metabolism, and
persistence of organisms with properties that facilitate the release of residual oil
and the coinjection of growth-effective nutrients into the hostile environments that
characterize petroleum reservoirs [241].
Microbial control of the production of sulfide
A microbial process was developed for controlling the production of hydrogen sulfide
by sulfate-reducing bacteria, using mutant strains of Thiobacillus denitrificans.
Thiobacillus denitrificans oxidizes sulfide to sulfate, using oxygen or nitrate as the
electron acceptor, but is inhibited by sulfide concentrations above 100-200 μm.
A mutant of T. denitrificans resistant to glutaraldehyde (40 mg l−1) and sulfide
(1500 μm) was obtained by repeated subculturing at increasing concentrations of
the inhibitors.
This strain prevented the accumulation of sulfide by Desulfovibrio desulfuricans
when both organisms were grown in liquid medium or in Berea sandstone cores.
The wild-type strain of T. denitrificans did not prevent sulfide accumulation by
T. desulfuricans. The mutant also prevented the accumulation of sulfide by a mixed
population of sulfate-reducing bacteria enriched from an oilfield brine.
Fermentation balances showed that this strain stoichiometrically oxidized the
biogenically produced sulfide to sulfate. The mutant grew at temperatures up to
40 ◦C, in salinities up to 2%, and at pressures up to 120 atm [242]. Clostridium
hydrosulfuricum 39E was found to have surface active properties during simulated
EOR experiments [243].
Bacillus licheniformis
The B. licheniformis JF-2 strain produces a very effective surfactant under conditions
typical of oil reservoirs. The partially purified biosurfactant from JF-2 was shown to
be the most active microbial surfactant found, and it gave an IFT against decane of
0.016 mN m−1. An optimal production of the surfactant was obtained in cultures
grown in the presence of 5% NaCl at a temperature of 45 ◦C and pH of 7.
The major end products of fermentation were lactic acid and acetic acid, with
smaller amounts of formic acid and acetoin. The growth and biosurfactant formation
were also observed in anaerobic cultures supplemented with a suitable electron
acceptor, such as NaNO3 [244].
Microbial ecology of corrosion
Among the bacteria that can inhabit an oil reservoir are the sulfur bacteria that use
sulfur compounds in their metabolism. These bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide,
which has been responsible for extensive corrosion in the oil field. Thus, the16.14 Microbial enhanced oil recovery techniques 697
exclusion of these bacteria from MEOR is highly desirable. The net effect of souring
a reservoir is a decrease in the economic value of the reservoir [245].
Bacillus licheniformis JF-2 and Clostridium acetogutylicum were investigated
under simulated reservoir conditions. Sandstone cores were equilibrated to the
desired simulated reservoir conditions, saturated with oil and brine, and flooded
to ROS. The waterflood brine was displaced with a nutrient solution. The MEOR
efficiency was directly related to the dissolved gas/oil ratio. The principal MEOR
mechanism observed in this work was solution gas drive [246].
16.14.4 STRICT ANAEROBIC BACTERIA
Several strict anaerobic bacteria belonging to different phylogenetic taxons
were isolated from the Tatar and Siberian oil fields under different physico￾chemical conditions. All isolated strains are capable of producing oil-releasing
compounds: biopolymers, organic acids, or gases. Methanogenic bacteria were
shown to produce poly(saccharide)s.
The poly(saccharide) of Methanococcoides euhalobius was partly purified and
characterized. Some acetogenic strains capable of producing volatile fatty acids
from CO2 and H2 were isolated from stratal waters of the Tatar and Siberian oil
fields [247].
In highly saline brines, which were collected from the Vassar Vertz Sand Unit,
Payne County, Oklahoma, diverse populations of anaerobic, heterotrophic bacteria
were present. All strains grew in a mineral salts medium containing glucose,
yeast extract, and casamino acids in the presence of NaCl concentrations of up to
20% [248].
Shewanella putrefaciens
Many Shewanella putrefaciens strains can reduce metal oxides. Further, Shewanella
species that can utilize butane have been proposed for a method of bioremediation
of petroleum contaminants. Biofilms of Shewanella species can sequester gases, in
particular CO2, in underground geological formations and prevent the release into
the atmosphere [249].
Shewanella putrefaciens grows under denitrifying anaerobic conditions, on crude
oil as the sole carbon source. This organism can assist the oil release from a substrate
when grown on either lactate or peptone as a carbon source, as shown by in vitro
experiments. Thus, this strain can be used to improve oil recovery [250].
Thauera strains
Particular strains of denitrifying bacteria belonging to Azoarcus and Thauera have
been shown to grow on oil and or oil constituents under anaerobic conditions without
the need for nutrient supplementation [251]. Enzymes that catalyze the metabolism
of simple aromatic compounds have been identified in Thauera and Azoarcus species.698 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
Enzymes from Thauera aromatica are active in the metabolism of toluene and
all cresols, but not with any xylene isomers. Most of the aromatic compounds are
converted to the central intermediate benzoyl-CoA via different metabolic pathways.
Besides in EOR these strains may be useful in the maintenance of oil pipelines [252].
Methanohalophilus
A methanogenic bacterium was isolated from oil reservoir brines by enrichment
with trimethylamine. Methane production occurred only with trimethylamine com￾pounds or methanol as substrates. Sodium ions, magnesium ions, and potassium
ions were all required for growth. This organism appears to be a member of
the genus Methanohalophilus based on substrate utilization and general growth
characteristics [253].
Sulfate-reducing desulfovibrio
A sulfate-reducing bacterium was isolated by enrichment with a lactate-sulfate
medium containing 3% NaCl. This isolate utilized lactate as an electron
donor for sulfate reduction and contained desulfoviridin, typical of the genus
Desulfovibrio [253].
16.14.5 ULTRAMICROBACTERIA
Selective plugging of high-permeability areas in a reservoir rock will increase the
oil recovery during waterflooding. The injected water flows through the low-
permeability, oil-bearing zones, pushing oil along its path. Many plugging agents
that have been developed do not deeply penetrate the reservoir and often wash
out when the injection pressure is reduced. On the other hand, ultramicrobacteria
penetrate deep into formations and grow exponentially with nutrient stimulation to
preferentially plug high-permeability zones [254].
The microorganisms reduce the nitrate and produce sulfuric acid, which even￾tually dissolves the rock formation, thus releasing oil. The microorganisms can be
denitrifying Thiobacilli, such as T. denitrificans [255].
Lactic acid bacteria
Particularly preferred bacteria are those of the genera Lactobacillus or Pediococcus.
Lactic acid produced by bacteria may also be used for removal of carbonate or iron
scale in oilfield equipment [256].
16.14.6 SCALE INHIBITORS AS A MICROBIAL NUTRIENT
Organic phosphates and organic phosphonates are known as scale inhibitors. At the
same time, substances in this class can be nutrients for certain bacteria. Therefore, a
phosphorous nutrient injection system can both prevent scales and act as a nutrient
in favorite cases [14,257].16.14 Microbial enhanced oil recovery techniques 699
16.14.7 EXTREMOPHILE ANAEROBIC INDIGENOUS
MICROORGANISMS
A process for increasing the recovery of heavy oil with an API gravity equal to or
greater than 10 has been developed [258]. The heavy oil is located in carbonate or
sandstone porous media. Extremophile (thermophilic, halotolerant, and barotolerant)
anaerobic indigenous microorganisms are used.
The process involves nutrient injection to stimulate the activity of the ex￾tremophile anaerobic indigenous microorganisms at the well bottom, promoting the
production of metabolites which improve oil mobility and increase oil recovery.
Stimulation of the extremophile anaerobic indigenous microorganisms and their
metabolite production is conducted under anaerobic conditions at temperatures
of 45-90 ◦C, NaCl concentrations of 5000 to 40,000 mg l−1 and pressures of
0.795-169 kp cm−2. This process enables up to 21% oil recovery in addition to
waterflooding.
The biotechnological recovery process consists of the following steps [258]:
1. selecting an oil well for recovery of heavy oil;
2. collecting one or more fluid samples from the oil well and performing
microbiological and physicochemical characterization of the fluid samples to
obtain technical information on the well;
3. determining the identity of extremophile anaerobic indigenous microorganisms
present in the well from the technical information;
4. forming a culture medium, suitable for stimulating activity and promoting
production of metabolites by the extremophile anaerobic indigenous
microorganisms in the well;
5. forming a mixed culture of microorganisms comprising the microorganisms
from the samples of the previous steps, which are extremophile, anaerobic
indigenous microorganisms of the well and the fermentative and methanogenic
anaerobic, thermophilic, halotolerant, and barotolerant microorganisms
Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus, Thermoanaerobacter brockii,
Thermoanaerobacter keratinophilus, and Methanobacterium
thermoautotrophicus;
6. injecting an inoculum from the culture medium and also the mixed culture of
into the well to increase the population of indigenous microorganisms in the
well; and
7. recovering heavy oil from the well after a minimum of 3 days after the injection
of the microorganisms and nutrients.
Culture media compositions are shown in Tables 16.5–16.8.

Interfacial rheologic properties
The interfacial rheologic properties are extremely sensitive parameters toward the
chemical composition of immiscible formation liquids [262]. Therefore, comparison
and interpretation of the interfacial rheologic properties may contribute significantly
to extension of the spectrum of the reservoir characterization, better understanding
of the displacement mechanism, development of more profitable EOR and IOR702 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
methods, intensification of the surface technologies, optimization of the pipeline
transportation, and improvement of the refinery operations [263].
Interfacial rheologic properties of different crude oil-water systems were deter￾mined in wide temperature and shear rate ranges and in the presence of inorganic
electrolytes, surfactants, alkaline materials, and polymers [263].
Caustic waterflooding
In caustic waterflooding, the interfacial rheologic properties of a model crude oil￾water system were studied in the presence of sodium hydroxide. The interfacial
viscosity, the non-Newtonian flow behavior, and the activation energy of viscous flow
were determined as a function of shear rate, alkali concentration, and aging time.
The interfacial viscosity drastically decreases in the presence of sodium hydrox￾ide. Under favorable conditions, the change may exceed three or four orders of
magnitude. Simultaneously, the sodium hydroxide effectively suppresses the non￾Newtonian flow behavior of the interfacial layer [264].
16.14.9 TRACERS
The addition of tracer chemicals to an injection fluid provides information on the
permeability of a reservoir. Small amounts of a tracer are added to the injected fluid
and the distribution of the tracer at the production well is monitored with respect to
time. Radioactive tracers and nonradioactive tracers can be used.
Isotopic-labeled tracers behave like the components in the fluid of interest. For
example, tritium water behaves like water. If less similar chemicals are used as
tracers, selective adsorption, chemical reaction, and liquid-liquid distribution must
be considered. The tracer must be chosen so that the analytic method is sufficiently
sensitive to detect the tracer in the desired amounts.
Tritiated or 14C-tagged hydrocarbons (including tritium gas) can be measured by
using a liquid scintillation counter or a gas proportional counter [265,266]. Isotopic
tracers are not exclusively radioactive. For instance, 13C is a nonradioactive element
that is suitable for a nonradioactive labeling technique.
Application of tracers
Sensitive analytic procedures enable detection and measurement of very low tracer
levels. In tracer studies, an identifiable tracer material is injected through one or more
injection wells into the reservoir being studied. Water is then injected to push the
tracer to one or more recovery wells in the reservoir.
The output of the recovery wells is monitored to determine the tracer break￾through and flow through the recovery wells. Analysis of the breakthrough times
and the flows yields important information regarding how to perform the secondary
or enhanced recovery processes. A sharp breakthrough of tracers in a two-well tracer
test is achieved by the following method [267]:16.14 Microbial enhanced oil recovery techniques 703
1. injecting a solution consisting of a water-soluble tracer and a partitioning tracer
that distributes between the formation oil and water into the formation through a
temporary injection well;
2. discontinuing injection into the temporary injection well after a slug of the tracer
solution has been injected;
3. producing formation fluids from the production well;
4. monitoring the concentration of each tracer and the volumes of fluids produced
from the producing wellborehole; and
5. determining the formation of ROS from the chromatographic separation of the
water-soluble tracer and the partitionable tracer.
Retention of the tracer
To improve the evaluation of a water and gas pilot, tracers were injected in the
gas phase at the beginning of the first two-gas injection periods. Perfluoromethylcy￾clopentane and perfluoromethylcyclohexane were used. In laboratory studies, these
compounds were shown to have a higher partitioning to the oil phase than did tritiated
methane. This caused a minor retention of the tracer [268,269].
Radioactive tracers
Water tracers were tested for use in carbonate reservoirs. Seven substances were
tested: tritiated water (HTO) and the ions S14CN−, 36Cl−, 131I
−, 35SO4
2−,
H14CO3−, and 22Na+. HTO is the ideal water tracer, although S14CN− and 36Cl−
may be considered as near-ideal tracers for water flow in chalk. However, 131I
− and
35SO4
2− show a more complicated behavior because of ion exclusion, adsorption,
desorption, and chemical reactions [270].
Nonradioactive tracers
Analysis of the halohydrocarbons, halocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride is usually
achieved by gas chromatography that is equipped with an electron capture detector.
Complex metal anions, such as cobalt hexacyanide, are used as nonradioactive tracers
in reservoir studies. The cobalt in the tracer compound must be in the complex anion
portion of the molecule, because cationic cobalt tends to react with materials in the
reservoir, leading to inaccurate analytic information [271].
In most production reservoirs, the produced brines are injected into the formation
for purposes of maintaining reservoir pressure and avoiding subsidence and environ￾mental pollution [272]. In the case of geothermal fields, the brines are also injected to
recharge the formation. However, the injected brines can adversely affect the fluids
produced from the reservoir. For example, in geothermal fields, the injected brine
can lower the temperature of the produced fluids by mixing with the hotter formation
fluids. In order to mitigate this problem, the subsurface paths of the injected fluids
must be known.
Tracers have been used to label fluids in order to track fluid movement and
monitor chemical changes of the injected fluid. Radioactive materials are one class
of commonly used tracers. These tracers have several drawbacks.704 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
One drawback is that they require special handling because of the danger posed to
personnel and the environment. Another drawback is the alteration by the radioactive
materials of the natural isotope ratio indigenous to the reservoir, thereby interfering
with scientific analysis of the reservoir fluid characteristics. In addition, the half-life
of radioactive tracers tends to be either too long or too short for practical use.
A number of organic compounds are suitable for use as tracers in a process
for monitoring the flow of subterranean fluids. The following traces have been pro￾posed: benzene tetracarboxylic acid, methylbenzoic acid, naphthalene sulfonic acid,
naphthalene disulfonic acid, naphthalene trisulfonic acid, alkyl benzene sulfonic
acid, alkyl toluene sulfonic acid, alkyl xylene sulfonic acid, α-olefin sulfonic acid,
salts of the foregoing acids, naphthalenediol, aniline, substituted aniline, pyridine,
substituted pyridines [272].
16.14.10 THERMAL STABILITY OF ALKYL BENZENE SULFONATE
The thermal degradation of alkyl benzene sulfonates in alkaline media is important
because of the application at elevated temperatures. The half-lives, with respect to
thermal degradation, of several commercially available sulfonates were estimated at
hundreds to thousands of years at 204 ◦C. The degradation mechanism was predomi￾nately a clipping of the alkyl chain to yield an alkyl benzene sulfonate with the phenyl
group attached to the α-carbon; however, desulfonation also occurred [273].
16.14.11 ASPHALTENE DEPOSITION
Asphaltenes are components of crude oils. They contain numerous individual
compounds, especially high-molecular weight condensed aromatic components with
heteroatoms. Because of the complexity of their chemistry, asphaltenes are summa￾rized as the oil fraction that is soluble in benzene, but not in n-pentane. In crude
oil, asphaltenes are normally present as a colloidal dispersion. Such a dispersion is
stabilized by oleoresins. During the production, refining, transportation, and storage
of crude oil, asphaltenes may precipitate.
The precipitation of asphalts, asphaltene, and other organics in the porous
media near the wellbore will reduce the permeability. Commonly encountered
causes of such a precipitation are a temperature drop or a composition change
(e.g., vaporization of highly volatile components). Asphaltenes may also precipitate
during flow through porous media. In particular, CO2 flooding during the production
process may bring about flocculation or precipitation of asphaltenes. Partial esters of
phosphoric acid with carboxylic acids are dispersants for asphaltenes [274].
Furthermore, the injection of organic aromatic solvents and soaking is a feasible
method to remove the precipitates [275]. The precipitation of asphalt from crude
oil can be reduced by adding an N,N-dialkylamide of a fatty acid [276,277]. When
asphaltenes are precipitated out, they can be removed from the walls of a well or a
pipeline by washing with a hydrocarbon solvent. However, it has been shown that
isopropyl benzoate is exceptionally useful as a solvent for asphaltene removal [278].16.15 Reservoir properties 705
16.14.12 STABILIZER DISPERSANT
The addition of hydrogenated castor oil to a copolymer of AAm and sodium acrylate
formulation will suspend the copolymer and retard the settling process [290].
16.15 RESERVOIR PROPERTIES
16.15.1 RESERVOIR MODELS
There are several simulators for modeling the processes in EOR, cf., Table 16.9.
16.15.2 GAS PERMEABILITY OF SHALE
Permeability is one of the most fundamental properties of any reservoir rock required
for modeling hydrocarbon production. However, shale permeability has not yet been
understood fully because of the complexities involved in modeling flow through
nanoscale throats.
The effects of adsorbed layers of methane and of gas slippage at pore walls on
the flow behavior in individual conduits of simple geometry and in networks of
such conduits have been analyzed. The network is based on the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image and drainage experiment of shale. To represent the effect of
adsorbed gas, the effective size of each throat in the network depends on the pressure.
The hydraulic conductance of each throat is determined on the basis of the Knudsen￾number (Kn) criterion [291].
The combined effects of adsorption and slip depend strongly on pressure and on
conduit diameter. The results indicate that laboratory measurements made with N2 at

ambient temperature and 5 MPa pressure, which is typical for a transient pulse-decay
method, overestimate the gas permeability at early life of production by a factor
of 4 [292].
This ratio increases if the measurement is run at ambient condition because
the low pressure enhances the slippage and reduces the thickness of the adsorbed
layer. Moreover, the permeability increases nonlinearly as the in situ pressure
decreases during production. This effect contributes to mitigating the decline in the
production rate of shale-gas wells. Laboratory data available in the literature for CH4
permeability at pressures below 7 MPa agree with model predictions of the effect of
pressure [292].
16.15.3 PERMEABILITY REDUCTION
Most mature sandstone reservoirs produce crude oil along with an increasing volume
of water. The percentage of water is defined as the water oil ratio for a given well.
The water may either be what is known as good water, which displaces the crude
oil out of the reservoir or bad water which is produced without contributing to the
production of crude.
Bad water is often the result of water invading the reservoir and communicating
with the wellbore through permeable channels or fissures. As the water usually
has a much lower viscosity than the crude oil at reservoir conditions, the effective
permeability of the formation to water is much higher than to crude, which tends
to result in more water than crude being produced once the water is in direct
communication with the wellbore.
Bad water production generally increases with time, as the water invades more
of the reservoir and after stimulation treatments. The treatment either selectively
stimulates the intervals with water due to differences in relative permeability (in the
case of matrix treatment), or due to increased communication with the water bearing
intervals in the case of a hydraulic fracturing.
In some cases, it is possible to decrease the production of water using a chemical
or more commonly a polymer which provides a disproportionate permeability
reduction with respect to water.
These polymers are more commonly known as permeability modifiers and
decrease the effective permeability of the reservoir to water without decreasing the
effective permeability to the crude oil. A permeability modifier is usually a low
viscosity polymer which when injected into the matrix [293]:
• is highly charged and adheres to the surfaces in the pore spaces; and
• through a number of different mechanisms, such as swelling in the presence of
water, reduces the size of the pore throats and hence the relative permeability of
the matrix to water.
The success of such a treatment depends on distance from the sandface that the
chemical can be placed: the greater the distance, the longer the effect will last.
Gelled hydrocarbon fluids have been described that are formed from a mixture
of at least a hydrocarbon, for example, diesel, a gelling agent, such as zwitterionic16.15 Reservoir properties 707
surfactant, for example, erucic amidopropyl dimethyl betaine, and a metal carboxy￾late crosslinking agent, for example, aluminum octoate.
The liquid carrier can be water, brine, or other type of fluids. The fluid may further
contain a salt, such as sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, potassium chloride,
calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate [293].
16.15.4 VISCOSITY IMPROVEMENT
Conventionally, zwitterionic surfactants and notably betaines are preferably used
as surfactants. However, these surfactants may degrade during use at temperatures
above 80-100 ◦C in saline oil reservoirs and the drive fluid can then suffer a loss of
its viscosity-improving capacity [294].
Unexpectedly, it has been discovered that the use of a mixture of surfactants
or of two populations with different organic substitutes of viscosity-improving
zwitterionic surfactants can greatly improve the viscosity of the mixture and therefore
of the aqueous drive fluid [294]. Examples of such surfactants have been described
in detail [295,296]. Moreover, this fluid comprising this mixture also displays a
considerable improvement in its thermal stability [294].
16.15.5 PROFILE CONTROL
Profile control occurs by artificially changing the permeability as is done in water
shutoff. For more information, see Chapter 18.
AAm polymers
The permeability of a high-permeability zone in a high-temperature oil can be
reduced by placing a gellable polymeric aqueous solution and gelling this solution in
situ [297,298]. The gel is made of a copolymer or a mixture of a synthetic polymer
and a biopolymer (e.g., xanthan gum) [299]. Crosslinking agents are trivalent
chromium ions or aldehydes [300]. The pH is adjusted to a value within the range of
1.5-5.5, depending on the desired gelling time.
Anti-syneresis properties can be obtained with various organic acids and their
alkali metal or ammonium salts. A delay in gelation also occurs when malonic acid
is used [301]. AAms also can be crosslinked in situ by O-hydroxyphenylmethanol
[302] or furfuryl alcohol, and formaldehyde [303].
Melamine and phenol-formaldehyde resins
Melamine resins [304] and phenol-formaldehyde resins [305] can be gelled in situ
to reduce the permeability. Various classes of polymers can be gelled by similar
principles [306].
Latex
Latex particles may flocculate when injected in a reservoir with high formation
temperatures. When the particles flocculate, shrink, and harden, they form a more
effective blocking agent than the dispersed, expanded, and softer particles [307].708 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
In situ carbonate precipitation
Carbon dioxide flooding is the most promising EOR method. To overcome the
tendency of CO2 to bypass the smaller pores containing residual oil, one approach
is to plug the larger pores by chemical precipitation. Several relatively inexpensive
water-soluble salts of the earth alkali group react with CO2 to form a precipitate.
Laboratory experiments have indicated that carbonate precipitation can alter
the permeability of the core samples under reservoir conditions. The precipitation
reduces the gas permeability in favor of the liquid permeability. This indicates that
precipitation occurs preferentially in the larger pores.
Once the precipitate is formed in the larger pores, the subsequent fluid flow
will be diverted to relatively smaller pores, thereby increasing the sweep efficiency.
Additional experimental work with a series of connected cores suggested that the
permeability profile can be successfully modified. However, pH control plays a
critical role in the propagation of the chemical precipitation reaction [308].
In situ silica cementation
The permeability profile of a formation in which temperatures higher than 90 ◦C are
encountered is modified by the following process: initially, an aqueous solution of
an alkali metal hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, or organo-ammonium hydroxide
is injected into a zone of greater permeability in a formation. After this, a spacer
volume of a water-miscible organic solvent is injected into the zone. Then a water￾miscible organic solvent containing an alkylpolysilicate is injected into the greater
permeability zone.
A silica cement is formed in situ, thereby substantially closing off the higher
permeability zone to fluid flow. Finally, a steamflooding, waterflooding, carbon
dioxide stimulation, or fireflooding EOR operation is commenced in the lower
permeability zone [309,310].
Hydratable clay
Hydratable clays may be used as plugging agents for profile control. The swelling of
the clay is desirable, unlike when formation damage occurs [311]. First, an aqueous
solution containing the salt of certain cations that inhibit clay swelling is prepared.
The cations K+, Ca2+, or Mg2+ are inhibitive of clay swelling. The clay slurry is
introduced into the formation, where it enters the channels of high permeability.
There, the slurry contacts the NaCl brine solution already present in natural or
injected drive fluids. The inhibitive cations bound to the clay particles are replaced
by Na+ ions, which attract water molecules and promote clay swelling. The Na+
clay swells up to 10 times its original volume, causing the slurry to acquire a gel like
consistency. The clay gel formed is capable of blocking the flow of water and can
resist a differential pressure gradient of up to 500 kPa m−1.
Silicate gel
Silicate gel enhances the sweep efficiency of a waterflood, gasflood, or steamflood
operation by reducing the permeability of the high-permeability zones. Weak acids
may be added to control gel generation rate [312].16.15 Reservoir properties 709
16.15.6 FORMATION DAMAGE
The in situ release of fine particles in a porous medium resulting from changes in the
colloidal character of the fines has been studied. Changes in the electrolytic condition
of the permeating fluid induce damage. The results showed that high pH and low
salinity cause the fines to be released.
The release causes a drastic decline in the permeability of the medium. These
findings establish the interplay between salinity changes, cation exchange, and pH
during a water shock and elucidate the vital role of the ion exchange process in
formation damage [313].
Formation damage caused by clay migration may be observed when the injected
brine replaces the connate water during operations such as waterflooding, chemical
flooding including alkaline, and surfactant and polymer processes. These effects
can be predicted by a physicochemical flow model based on cationic exchange
reactions when the salinity decreases [314]. Still other models have also been
presented [315,316].
The pH variation of the flowing fluid suggests that chemical reactions are
occurring in the formation. A high pH promotes formation damage by particle
deposition within porous media. The permeability reduction is minimized by using
brines and high oil recoveries. Suspended solid particles are released and moved with
the injection water when the salt concentration drops below the critical salt concen￾tration, causing a reduction of permeability and eventually formation damage [317].
16.15.7 WATER SALINITY AND IONIC CONTENT
The impact of brine salinity and ion composition on oil recovery has been a
continuous area of research [318]. Laboratory studies and field tests targeting mainly
to sandstones, have shown that the injection of low-salinity water has a significant
impact on oil recovery.
Also related experiments for carbonates have been presented. It has been shown
that substantial tertiary oil recovery beyond conventional waterflooding can be
achieved by altering the salinity and the ionic content of injected water.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements indicated that the dilution of
seawater may cause a significant alteration in the surface relaxation of the carbonate
rock and can also enhance the connectivity among pore systems, because of rock
dissolution. Thus it has been concluded that the key mechanism of low-salinity use
is the wettability alteration [318].
16.15.8 WETTABILITY
The wettability of the rock is responsible for the behavior of a reservoir subjected to
any oil-recovery process. Because the chemical composition of the mineral surface is
mostly responsible for its wetting behavior, the relationship between wettability and
chemical composition of the surface is key information.
Most suitable for the examination of the surface is X-ray photoelectron spec￾troscopy, whereas the wettability determination can be established by a detailed710 CHAPTER 16 Enhanced oil recovery
interpretation of coreflooding experiments and wettability index measurements. The
results of such studies show that the organic carbon content in the surface is well
correlated with the wetting behavior of the material characterized by petrophysical
measurements [319,320].
16.15.9 FLOODING OF OIL IN CHALK
Chalk reservoirs encounter some specific problems during secondary recovery of oil
by waterflooding. Displacement experiments in several formations indicated that the
shape of the leaching front depends not only on the nature of the fluids but also on
the morphology of the formations. The following must be distinguished from each
other:
• voids filled with unrecoverable oil;
• easily accessible pores; and
• preferential paths.
The injection of water in oil-saturated chalk induces a regular front of leaching in
some formations with a high percentage of preferential paths, especially when chalk
contains a high proportion of rounded grains [321].
16.16 TREATMENT OF PRODUCED WATER
The treatment of produced water is an important process during oil recovery. The
produced liquid from an oil well is a mixture of oil and water. After a dehydration
process of the produced liquid, most of the crude oil is separated and a produced
water phase that consists of an oily waste water is formed. The produced water needs
to be treated, and is then injected into the stratum again.
The amount of produced water can be appreciable. Experiments with a crude
oil from the Daqing oilfield (China), with a water content of less than 0.5%, and a
density of 850 kg m−3 and a viscosity of 60.89 m Pa s, at 45 ◦C and a PHPA with
a degree of hydrolysis of about 25-30% were performed [322]. The surfactant was a
alkyl benzene sulfonate. The surfactant can decrease the ζ -potential of an oil droplet
greatly, especially when its concentration is less than 200 mg l−1 The surfactant and
the polymer increase interfacial elasticity between aqueous phase and oil phase. This
indicates that the coalescence of the oil droplets is hindered.
16.17 SOIL REMEDIATION
A chemical-EOR technology can be used to remove oily contaminants from soil.
Laboratory studies demonstrated that a variety of alkaline surfactant combinations
can be used with a polymer to reduce the ROS in waterflooding [323].References 711
Polyaromatic hydrocarbons absorb strongly to humus and other soil compo￾nents, rendering these contaminants difficult to remove by thermal, physical, or
chemical means, and unavailable for biodegradation. To desorb polyaromatic hy￾drocarbons from soil, surfactant flooding processes and soil-washing processes, or
treatments to enhance the biodegradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons have been
considered.
However, surfactant flooding may contaminate ground water. Soil washing
requires excavation and biodegradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and is incom￾plete even with surfactants. Biodegradable surfactants that can form reasonably stable
foams in the presence of up to 50% ethanol have been developed. These ethanol￾based foams can readily desorb the polyaromatic hydrocarbons from gas plant soils
and are moving well through soils at pressure gradients of 1.5 psi ft−1 or less [324,
325]. A partially hydrolyzed copolymer of AAm and n-octylacrylamide together with
sodium alkyl sulfates has also been described for in situ decontamination by flooding
operations [326].

17 Fracturing fluids
Hydraulic fracturing is a technique to stimulate the productivity of a well. A hydraulic
fracture is a superimposed structure that remains undisturbed outside the fracture.
Thus the effective permeability of a reservoir remains unchanged by this process.
The increased productivity results from the increased wellbore radius, because in the
course of hydraulic fracturing, a large contact surface between the well and the
reservoir is created.
The literature from 2004 to 2014, more than 100 references concerning water￾based fracturing fluids for fracturing ultralow- to moderate-permeability reservoirs
has been reviewed [1].
Guar-based polymers are still used in fracturing at temperatures less than 150 ◦C.
To minimize the damage associated with this class of polymers, several approaches
are known. These include the use of a lower polymer concentration in formulating
these fluids and the use of different crosslinking agents. Higher viscosities with lower
polymer loadings can be achieved. In addition, cleaner guar-based polymers are used
now, because commercial guar contains some 5% of residues, which may cause a
damage of proppant packs.
It has been found that shear and pressure effects on the rheological behavior of
borate crosslinked gels are important. Although these fluids recover their viscosity
after shear, they have been observed to lose a significant portion of their viscosity
under high pressures.
When fracturing is done in deeper wells, i.e., in hotter reservoirs, a new class
of thermally stable polymers became relevant. These are poly(acrylamide)-based
polymers. These synthetic polymers show a sufficient viscosity at temperatures up to
230 ◦C [1]. Examples are 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid and copoly￾mers of partially hydrolyzed acrylamide, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic
acid, and vinyl phosphonate. High-density brines have been used to increase the
hydrostatic pressure by 30% for high-pressure pumping.
Also, new breaker materials emerged [1]. These breakers destroy the gel by a
reaction with the crosslinking agent. They form ligands with the metallic crosslinking
agents and displace them from the crosslinking moieties of the guar-based polymers.
Examples of these breakers include poly(succinimide) derivates and lignosulfonate
derivates.
To minimize the environmental impact of using massive amounts of fresh water
and to minimize costs associated with treating produced water, the use of produced
water in hydraulic fracturing treatments has been reported.

Crosslinking agents [3].
Nanotechnology has been used in the design of new, efficient hydraulic fracturing
fluids [1]. For example, nanolatex silica was used to reduce the concentration of
boron found in conventional crosslinkers. Another advancement in nanotechnology
was the use of 20 nm silica particles suspended in guar gels [2].
Other crosslinking agents than boric acid have been described. These are
benzene diboronic acid, thiophene diboronic acid, and biphenyl diboronic acid.
The structures of these crosslinking agents are shown in Figure 17.1. It has been
found that an increase in the size of the crosslinking agent provides a higher
viscosity [3].
17.1 STRESSES AND FRACTURES
Hydraulic fracturing belongs to the newer techniques in petroleum sciences, not older
than approximately 50 years. The classic treatment [4] of hydraulic fracturing states
that the fractures are approximately perpendicular to the axis of the least stress. For
most deep reservoirs, the minimal stresses are horizontal. Therefore in fracturing,
vertical stresses will occur.
The actual stress can be calculated by balancing the (vertical) geostatic stress and
the horizontal stress by the common tools of the theory of elasticity. For example, the
geostatic stress must be corrected in a porous medium filled with a liquid having a
poroelastic constant and hydrostatic pressure. The horizontal stress can be calculated
from the corrected vertical stress with the Poisson ratio. Therefore, under some
circumstances, in particular in shallow reservoirs, horizontal stresses can also be
created rather than vertical stresses. The possible modes of stresses are summarized
in Table 17.1.
The knowledge of the stresses in a reservoir is essential to get information about
the pressure at which initialization of a fracture can take place. The upper bound of17.2 Comparison of stimulation techniques 735

the fracture initialization pressure can be estimated using a formula given by Terzaghi
[5], which states that
pb = 3sH,min − sH,max + T − p. (17.1)
The closure pressure indicates the pressure at which the width of the fracture
becomes zero. This is normally the minimal horizontal stress.
The pressure response during a fracturing job provides important information
about the success of the operation. The fluid efficiency can be estimated from the
closure time.
17.2 COMPARISON OF STIMULATION TECHNIQUES
In addition to hydraulic fracturing, there are other stimulation techniques such as
acid fracturing or matrix stimulation. Hydraulic fracturing finds use not only in the
stimulation of oil and gas reservoirs, but also in coal seams to stimulate the flow of
methane.
Fracturing fluids are often classified into water-based fluids, oil-based fluids,
alcohol-based fluids, emulsion fluids, and foam-based fluids. Several reviews have
been given in the literature dealing with the basic principles of hydraulic fracturing
and the guidelines to select a particular formulation for a specific job [6–8].
Polymer hydration, crosslinking, and degradation are the key processes influ￾encing their application. Technologic improvements over the years have focussed
primarily on improved rheologic performance, thermal stability, and cleanup of
crosslinked gels.
17.2.1 ACTION OF A FRACTURING FLUID
The development of suitable fracturing fluids is a complex art because the fluids
must simultaneously meet a number of conditions. For example, they must be stable
at high temperatures, high pumping rates, and shear rates, which can cause the fluids736 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
to degrade and prematurely settle out the proppant before the fracturing operation
is complete.
Most commercially used fracturing fluids are aqueous-based liquids which have
been either gelled or foamed. Typically, the fluids are gelled, by a polymeric gelling
agent. The thickened or gelled fluid helps keep the proppants within the fluid during
the fracturing operation. Fracturing fluids are injected into a subterranean formation
for the following purposes [9]:
• to create a conductive path from the wellbore extending into the formation
and
• to carry proppant material into the fracture to create a conductive path for
produced fluids.
17.2.2 STAGES IN A FRACTURING JOB
A fracturing job has several stages that involve injecting a prepad, a pad, a proppant
containing fracturing fluid, and finally, a treatment with flush fluids. A prepad is a
fluid with low viscosity used to condition the formation. The prepad may contain
fluid loss additives, surfactants, and a defined salinity to prevent formation damage.
The generation of the fractures takes place by injecting the pad, a viscous fluid, but
without proppants.
After the development of the fractures, a proppant must be injected to keep the
fractures permeable. When the fracture closes, the proppant left in the fracture creates
a large flow area and a highly conductive pathway for hydrocarbons to flow into the
wellbore. Thus, the proppant is utilized to maintain an open fracture. Viscous fluids
are utilized to transport, suspend, and eventually allow the proppant to be trapped
inside the fracture. These viscous fluids typically exhibit a power law behavior for
the range of shear rates encountered in hydraulic fracturing treatments.
It is desirable to obtain a uniform proppant distribution in order to get a uniformly
conductive fracture along the wellbore height and fracture half-length. However, the
complicated nature of proppant settling in non-Newtonian fluids often causes a higher
concentration of proppant to settle down in the lower part of the fracture. This often
leads to a lack of adequate proppant coverage on the upper portion of the fracture
and the wellbore. Clustering of proppant, encapsulation, bridging, and embedment
are phenomena that lower the potential conductivity of the proppant pack [10].
The job ends eventually with a cleanup stage in which flush fluids and other
cleanup agents are applied. The actual detailed time schedule depends on the
particular system used.
After the completion of the fracturing treatment, the fluid viscosity should
decrease to allow the placement of the proppant and a rapid fluid return through
the fracture. It is important to control the time at which the viscosity break occurs.
In addition, the degraded polymer should produce little residue to restrict the flow of
fluids through the fracture.17.3 Types of hydraulic fracturing fluids 737
17.3 TYPES OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING FLUIDS
Generally, a hydraulic fracturing treatment involves pumping a proppant-free viscous
fluid, or pad, usually water with some fluid additives to generate high viscosity, into
a well faster than the fluid can escape into the formation so that the pressure rises and
the rock breaks, creating artificial fractures or enlarging existing fractures.
After fracturing the formation, a propping agent, such as sand is added to the
fluid to form a slurry that is pumped into the newly formed fractures in the formation
to prevent them from closing when the pumping pressure is released. The proppant
transportability of a base fluid depends on the type of viscosifying additives added to
the water base [11].
Water-base fracturing fluids with water-soluble polymers added to make a
viscosified solution are widely used in the art of fracturing. Since the late 1950s,
more than half of the fracturing treatments are conducted with fluids comprising guar
gums, high-molecular-weight poly(saccharide)s composed of mannose and galactose
sugars, or guar derivatives such as hydropropyl guar (HPG), hydroxypropyl cellulose
(HPC), carboxymethyl guar, and carboxymethyl hydropropyl guar.
Crosslinking agents based on boron, titanium, zirconium, or aluminum complexes
are typically used to increase the effective molecular weight of the polymer and make
them better suited for use in high-temperature wells.
To a lesser extent, cellulose derivatives such as hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)
or HPC and carboxymethylhydroxyethyl cellulose are also used, with or without
crosslinkers. Xanthan and scleroglucan, two biopolymers, have been shown to have
excellent proppant-suspension ability even though they are more expensive than guar
derivatives and therefore used less frequently.
Poly(acrylamide) (PAM) and polyacrylate polymers and copolymers are used
typically for high-temperature applications or friction reducers at low concentrations
for all temperature ranges [11].
Polymer-free, water-base fracturing fluids can be obtained using viscoelastic
surfactants. These fluids are normally prepared by mixing in appropriate amounts of
suitable surfactants such as anionic, cationic, non-ionic, and zwitterionic surfactants.
The viscosity of viscoelastic surfactant fluids is attributed to the three-dimensional
structure formed by the components in the fluids.
When the concentration of surfactants in a viscoelastic fluid significantly exceeds
a critical concentration, in most cases in the presence of an electrolyte, surfactant
molecules aggregate into species such as micelles, which can interact to form a
network exhibiting viscous and elastic behavior.
Cationic viscoelastic surfactants—typically consisting of long-chain quaternary
ammonium salts such as cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)—have been so
far of primarily commercial interest in wellbore fluid. Common reagents that gener￾ate viscoelasticity in the surfactant solutions are salts such as ammonium chloride,
potassium chloride, sodium chloride, sodium salicylate and sodium isocyanate, and
non-ionic organic molecules such as chloroform. The electrolyte content of surfactant
solutions is also an important control factor to their viscoelastic behavior [11].738 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids

However, fluids comprising this type of cationic viscoelastic surfactants usually
tend to lose viscosity at high brine concentration. Therefore, these fluids have
seen limited use as gravel packing fluids or drilling fluids, or in other applications
requiring heavy fluids to balance well pressure. Anionic viscoelastic surfactants are
also used.
It is also known to impart viscoelastic properties using amphoteric/zwitterionic
surfactants [12] and an organic acid, salt, or an inorganic salt. The surfactants are,
for instance, dihydroxyl alkyl glycinate, alkyl amphoacetate or propionate, alkyl
betaine, alkyl amidopropyl betaine, and alkylamino mono- or dipropionates derived
from certain waxes, fats, and oils. The surfactants are used in conjunction with an
inorganic water-soluble salt or organic additives such as phthalic acid, salicylic acid,
or their salts.
Amphoteric/zwitterionic surfactants, in particular those comprising a betaine
moiety, are useful for a temperature up to about 150 ◦C and are therefore of
particular interest for medium to high-temperature wells. Betaine is shown in
Figure 17.2. However, like the cationic viscoelastic surfactants mentioned above,
anionic surfactants are usually not compatible with high brine concentration.
Proppant types can be sand, intermediate strength ceramic proppants, or sintered
bauxites. These base propping agents can further be coated with a resin to improve
the clustering ability of the proppant. In addition, the proppant can be coated with
resin or a proppant flowback control agent such as fibers. By selecting proppants
having a contrast in one of such properties such as density, size, and concentrations,
different settling rates will be achieved.
Waterfrac treatments combine low cost, low viscosity fluids in order to stimulate
very low permeability reservoirs. The results have been reported to be successful and
rely on the mechanisms of asperity creation (rock spalling), shear displacement of
rock, and localized high concentration of proppant to create adequate conductivity.
It is the last of the three mechanisms that is mostly responsible for the conductivity
obtained in waterfrac treatments. The mechanism can be described as analogous to a
wedge splitting wood.
Viscous well treatment fluids are commonly used in the drilling, completion,
and treatment of subterranean formations penetrated by wellbores. A viscous well
treatment fluid is generally composed of a poly(saccharide) or synthetic polymer in
an aqueous solution, which is crosslinked by an organometallic compound. Examples
of well treatments in which metal crosslinked polymers are used are hydraulic17.3 Types of hydraulic fracturing fluids 739
fracturing, gravel packing operations, water blocking, and other well completion
operations.
In order for the treatment to be successful, it is preferred that the fluid viscosity
eventually diminish to levels approaching that of water after the proppant is placed.
This allows a portion of the treating fluid to be recovered without producing excessive
amounts of proppant after the well is opened and returned to production. The
recovery of the fracturing fluid is accomplished by reducing the viscosity of the fluid
to a lower value such that it flows naturally from the formation under the influence
of formation fluids. This viscosity reduction or conversion is referred to as breaking
and can be accomplished by incorporating chemical agents, referred to as breakers,
into the initial gel.
Certain gels of fracturing fluids, such as those based upon guar polymers, undergo
a natural break without the intervention of a breaking agent. However, the breaking
time for such gelled fluids generally is excessive and impractical, being somewhere
in the range from greater than 24 h to in excess of weeks, months, or years depending
on the conditions in the reservoir.
Accordingly, to decrease the break time of gels used in fracturing, chemical
agents are usually incorporated into the gel and become a part of the gel itself.
Typically, these agents are either oxidants or enzymes which operate to degrade the
polymeric gel structure. Most degradation or breaking is caused by oxidizing agents,
such as persulfate salts, chromous salts, organic peroxides or alkaline earth or zinc
peroxide salts, or by enzymes.
In addition to the importance of providing a breaking mechanism for the gelled
fluid to facilitate recovery of the fluid and to resume production, the timing of the
break is also of great importance. Gels which break prematurely can cause suspended
proppant material to settle out of the gel before being introduced a sufficient distance
into the produced fracture. Premature breaking can also lead to a premature reduction
in the fluid viscosity, resulting in a less than desirable fracture width in the formation
causing excessive injection pressures and premature termination of the treatment.
On the other hand, gelled fluids which break too slowly can cause slow recovery
of the fracturing fluid from the produced fracture with attendant delay in resuming
the production of formation fluids and severely impair anticipated hydrocarbon
production.
Additional problems may occur, such as the tendency of proppant to become
dislodged from the fracture, resulting in at least partial closing and decreased
efficiency of the fracturing operation. Preferably, the fracturing gel should begin
to break when the pumping operations are finished. For practical purposes, the gel
preferably should be completely broken within about 24 h after completion of the
fracturing treatment.
Fracturing fluid compositions comprise a solvent, a polymer soluble or hydratable
in the solvent, a crosslinking agent, an inorganic breaking agent, an optional ester
compound, and a choline carboxylate. Preferably, the solvent includes water, and the
polymer is hydratable in water. The solvent may be an aqueous potassium chloride
solution.740 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
The inorganic breaking agent may be a metal-based oxidizing agent, such as
an alkaline earth metal or a transition metal. The inorganic breaking agent may be
magnesium peroxide, calcium peroxide, or zinc peroxide. The ester compound may
be an ester of a polycarboxylic acid. For example, the ester compound may be an
ester of oxalate, citrate, or ethylene diamine tetraacetate. The ester compound having
hydroxyl groups can also be acetylated. An example of this is that citric acid can be
acetylated to form acetyl triethyl citrate.
A preferred ester is acetyl triethyl citrate. The hydratable polymer may be a water￾soluble poly(saccharide), such as galactomannan, or cellulose. The crosslinking
agent may be a borate, titanate, or zirconium-containing compound. For example,
the crosslinking agent can be Na3BO3 × nH2O, or other borate crosslinkers.
A general review of commercially available additives for fracturing fluids is
given in the literature [13]. Possible components in a fracturing fluid are listed in
Table 17.2.

In particular, Table 17.2 reflects the complexity of a fracturing fluid formulation.
Some additives may not be used together reasonably, such as oil-gelling additives
in a water-based system. More than 90% of the fluids are based on water. Aqueous
fluids are economical and can provide control of a broad range of physical properties
as a result of additives developed over the years. Additives for fracturing fluids serve
two purposes [14]:
1. to enhance fracture creation and proppant-carrying capability and
2. to minimize formation damage.
Additives that assist the creation of a fracture include viscosifiers, such as
polymers and crosslinking agents, temperature stabilizers, pH control agents, and
fluid loss control materials. Formation damage is reduced by such additives as gel
breakers, biocides, surfactants, clay stabilizers, and gases. Table 17.3 summarizes
the various types of fluids and techniques used in hydraulic fracturing.
17.3.1 COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES
Certainly the optimal techniques depend on the type of reservoir. Reports that
compare the techniques in a related environment are available. In the Kansas
Hugoton field (Mesa Limited Partnership), several hydraulic fracturing methods were
tested [17].
A method in which a complexed gelled water fracture was applied was the
most successful when compared with a foam technique and with older and simpler
techniques. The study covers some 56 wells where such techniques were applied.
17.3.2 EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR ASSESSMENT
A PC-based interactive computer model has been developed to help engineers
choose the best fluid and additives and the most suitable propping agent for a742 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
given set of reservoir properties [18,19]. The computer model also optimizes the
treatment volume based on reservoir performance and economics. To select the fluids,
additives, and propping agents, the expert system surveys stimulation experts from
different companies, reviews the literature, and then incorporates the knowledge into
rules using an expert system shell.
In addition, the fluid leak-off during hydraulic fracturing can be modeled, calcu￾lated, and measured experimentally. Procedures for converting laboratory data to an
estimate of the leak-off under field conditions have been given in the literature [20].
17.4 WATER-BASED SYSTEMS
17.4.1 THICKENERS AND GELLING AGENTS
A gelling agent is also addressed as a viscosifying agent. A gelling agent refers to
a material capable of forming the fracturing fluid into a gel, thereby increasing its
viscosity [21].
Suitable gelling agents include guar gum, xanthan gum, welan gum, locust
bean gum, gum ghatti, gum karaya, tamarind gum, and tragacanth gum. A suit￾able depolymerized gum is a depolymerized guar gum. The guar gum can be
functionalized of modified to result in hydroxyethyl guar, hydroxypropyl guar, and
carboxymethyl guar. Examples of water-soluble cellulose ethers include methyl
cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), HEC, and hydroxyethyl carboxymethyl
cellulose [21].
Artificial polymers are as copolymers from acrylamide, methacrylamide, acrylic
acid (AA), or methacrylic acid. Other types are copolymers from 2-acrylamido-2-
methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid (AMPS) derivates and N-vinylpyridine [21].
Naturally occurring poly(saccharide)s and their derivatives form the predominant
group of water-soluble species generally used as thickeners to impart viscosity to
treating fluids [22]. Other synthetic polymers and biopolymers have found ancillary
applications. Polymers increase the viscosity of the fracturing fluid in comparatively
small amounts. The increase in fluid viscosity of hydraulic fracturing fluids serves
for improved proppant placement and fluid loss control. Table 17.4 summarizes
polymers suitable for fracturing fluids.
Guar is shown in Figure 17.3. In hydroxypropyl guar, some of the hydroxyl
groups are etherified with oxopropyl units. Compositions for gelling a hydrocarbon
fracturing fluid are basically different from those for aqueous fluids. A possible
formulation consists of a gelling agent, a phosphate ester, a crosslinking agent, a
multivalent metal ion, and a catalyst, a fatty quaternized amine [28].
Guar
Fracturing fluids have traditionally been viscosified with guar and guar derivatives.
Actually, guar is a branched poly(saccharide) from the guar plant Cyamopsis
tetragonolobus, originally from India, now also found in the southern United States,17.4 Water-based systems 743

with a molar mass of approximately 220 kDa. It consists of mannose in the main
chain and galactose in the side chain. The ratio of mannose to galactose is 2:1.
Poly(saccharide)s with a mannose backbone and side chains unlike mannose are
referred to as heteromannans according to the nomenclature of poly(saccharide)s,
in particular as galactomannans. Derivatives of guar therefore are sometimes called
galactomannans.
Guar-based gelling agents, typically hydroxypropyl guar, are widely used to
viscosify fracturing fluids because of their desirable rheologic properties, economics,
and ease in hydration. Nonacetylated xanthan is a variant of xanthan gum, which
develops a synergistic interaction with guar that exhibits a superior viscosity and
particle transport at lower polymer concentrations.744 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids

Viscosity of guar brines with varying amounts of ethylene glycol (EG) [9].
Static leak-off experiments with borate crosslinked and zirconate-crosslinked
hydroxypropyl guar fluids showed practically the same leak-off coefficients [29]. An
investigation of the stress-sensitive properties showed that zirconate filter cakes have
viscoelastic properties, but borate filter cakes are merely elastic. Non-crosslinked
fluids show no filter cake–type behavior for a large range of core permeabilities, but
rather a viscous flow dependent on porous medium characteristics.
The addition of glycols, such as ethylene glycol (EG), to aqueous fluids gelled
with a guar gum compound can increase the viscosity of the fluid and stabilize
the fluid brines. In particular, the gelled aqueous fluids are more stable at high
temperatures, such as in the range of 27-177 ◦C (80-350 ◦F).
This finding allows the guar to be used at higher temperatures. The formation
damage is minimized after hydraulic fracturing operations as less of the guar polymer
can be used, but the same viscosity is achieved by the addition of a glycol [9].
The crosslinker is selected from borates, titanates, or zirconates. The stability of
the gel is improved by the addition of sodium thiosulfate. The development of the
viscosity at 93 ◦C (200 ◦F) of brine fluids with 2.4 kg m−3 guar and 5% KCl, with
varying amounts of EG, is shown in Figure 17.4.
By using Na-ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as gel breaker in these
compositions with EG, the decay of viscosity with time can be still adjusted
accordingly [9].
Guar-borate gels satisfy most of the properties that are necessary to successfully
fracture formations, but they exhibit some limitations. For example, although such
gels can be degraded by some enzymes [30] and oxidants [31,32], they can induce
formation damage.17.4 Water-based systems 745
In order to reduce such a damage, another approach, used together with gel
degrading substances, is to use less guar gum [33]. However, often when using
less polymer in the gel, the essential properties necessary to perform the fracturing
treatment suffer, often limiting the treatment to a small percentage of wells. Improved
compositions have been recently described [34]. These compositions contain tetram￾ethylammonium chloride.
Anionic galactomannans, which are derived from guar gum, in which the hydroxyl
groups are partially esterified with sulfonate groups that result from AMPS and
1-allyloxy-2-hydroxypropyl sulfonic acid [35], have been claimed to be suitable as
thickeners. The composition is capable of producing enhanced viscosities, when used
either alone or in combination with a cationic polymer and distributed in a solvent.
Polyhydroxy compounds can be modified by various reactions. Etherification,
exemplified with dextrose as the model compound, is shown in Figure 17.5. Vinyl
compounds specifically used for the modification of guar are shown in Figure 17.6.

Borate crosslinked galactomannan fracturing fluids have an increased temperature
stability. The temperature stability of fracturing fluids containing galactomannan
polymers is increased by adding a sparingly soluble borate with a slow solubility rate
to the fracturing fluid. This provides a source of boron for solubilizing at elevated
temperatures, thus enhancing the crosslinking of the galactomannan polymer. The
polymer also improves the leak-off properties of the fracturing fluid.
Hydroxyethyl cellulose
HEC can be chemically modified by the reaction with vinylphosphonic acid in the
presence of the reaction product of hydrogen peroxide and a ferrous salt. The HEC
forms a graft copolymer with the vinylphosphonic acid.
Amylose and cellulose are shown in Figure 17.7. Amylose consists of a water￾soluble portion, a linear polymer of glucose, the amylose; and a water-insoluble
portion, the amylopectin. The difference between amylose and cellulose is the way
in which the glucose units are linked. In amylose, α-linkages are present, whereas
in cellulose, β-linkages are present. Because of this difference, amylose is soluble in
water and cellulose is not. Chemical modification allows cellulose to become water
soluble.
Modified HEC has been proposed as a thickener for hydraulic fracturing fluids
[24]. Polyvalent metal cations may be employed to crosslink the polymer molecules
to further increase the viscosity of the aqueous fluid.
Biotechnologic products
Gellan gum and wellan gum
Gellan gum is the generic name of an extracellular poly(saccharide) produced by the
bacterium Pseudomonas elodea. Gellan gum is a linear anionic poly(saccharide) with
a molecular mass of 500 kDa. It is composed of 1,3-β-d-glucose; 1,4-β-d-glucuronic
acid; 1,4-β-d-glucose; and 1,4-α-l-rhamnose.
Wellan gum is produced by aerobic fermentation. The backbone of wellan gum
is identical to gellan gum, but it has a side chain consisting of l-mannose or17.4 Water-based systems 747
l-rhamnose. It is used in fluid loss additives and is extremely compatible with
calcium ions in alkaline solutions.
Reticulated bacterial cellulose
A cellulose with an intertwined reticulated structure, produced from bacteria, has
unique properties and functionalities unlike other conventional celluloses. When
added to aqueous systems, reticulated bacterial cellulose improves the fluid rheology
and the particle suspension over a wide range of conditions [26]. Test results showed
advantages in fluid performance and significant economic benefits by the addition of
reticulated bacterial cellulose.
Xanthan gum
Xanthan gum is produced by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris. Commercial
productions started in 1964. Xanthans are water-soluble poly(saccharide) polymers
with the repeating units [36], as given in Table 17.5 and Figure 17.8.
The d-glucose moieties are linked in a β-(1,4) configuration. The inner
d-mannose moieties are linked in an α-(1,3) configuration, generally to alternate
glucose moieties. The d-glucuronic acid moieties are linked in a β-(1,2)
configuration to the inner mannose moieties. The outer mannose moieties are linked
to the glucuronic acid moieties in a β-(1,4) configuration.
Most of the xanthan gum used in oilfield applications is in the form of a
fermentation broth containing 8-15% polymer. The viscosity is less dependent on
the temperature in comparison with other poly(saccharide)s.

Viscoelastic formulations
Viscoelastic surfactant (VES)) fluids have advantages over conventional polymer
formulations. These include [37]:
• higher permeability in the oil-bearing zone,
• lower formation or subterranean damage,
• higher viscosifier recovery after fracturing,
• no need for enzymes or oxidizers to break down viscosity, and
• easier hydration and faster buildup to optimum viscosity.
Disadvantages and drawbacks of VES fluids are the high costs of the surfactants,
their low tolerance to salts, and stability against high temperatures as found in
deep well applications. However, there are recent formulations that overcome these
difficulties, at least to some extent.
The components of a viscoelastic fluids are a zwitterionic surfactant, erucyl
amidopropyl betaine, an anionic polymer, or N-erucyl-N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-
N-methyl ammonium chloride, poly(napthalene sulfonate), and cationic surfactants,
methyl poly(oxyethylene) octadecanammonium chloride, and poly(oxyethylene)
cocoalkylamines [37,38]. The corresponding fluids exhibit a good viscosity
performance.
Typical viscoelastic surfactants are N-erucyl-N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-methyl
ammonium chloride and potassium oleate, solutions of which form gels when
mixed with corresponding activators such as sodium salicylate and potassium
chloride [39].
The cationic surfactant should be soluble in both organic and inorganic solvents.
Typically, a high solubility of the cationic surfactant in hydrocarbon solvents is
promoted by multiple long-chain alkyl groups attached to the active surfactant unit
[39]. Examples are hexadecyltributylphosphonium and trioctylmethylammonium
ions. In contrast, cationic surfactants for viscoelastic solutions have rather a single
long linear hydrocarbon moiety attached to the surfactant group. Obviously, there is a
conflict between the structural requirements for achieving solubility in hydrocarbons
and for the formation of viscoelastic solutions.
As a compromise, surfactant compounds that are suitable for reversibly thicken￾ing water-based wellbore fluids and also soluble in both organic and aqueous fluids
have been designed.
A non-ionic surfactant gelling agent is tallow amido propylamine oxide [40].
Non-ionic fluids are inherently less damaging to the producing formations than
cationic fluid types, and are more efficacious than anionic gelling agents.
The synthesis of branched oleate has been described. 2-Methyl oleic acid methyl
ester, also addressed as 2-methyl oleate, can be prepared from methyl oleate and
methyl iodide in the presence of a pyrimidine-based catalyst [39]. The methyl ester
is then hydrolyzed to obtain 2-methyl oleic acid.
It is sometimes believed that the contact of a VES-gelled fluid instantaneously
reduces the viscosity of the gel. However, it has been discovered that mineral oil can
be used as an internal breaker for VES-gelled fluid systems [41].17.4 Water-based systems 749
The rate of breaking the viscosity at a certain temperature is influenced by the
type and amount of salts present. In the case of low molecular weight mineral oils, it
is important to add them after the VES component is added to the aqueous fluid.
By using combinations of internal breakers, both the initial and final break of
the VES fluid may be customized. In addition to mineral oil, for instance, fatty acid
compounds or bacteria may be used [41,42].
Carboxybetaine viscoelastic surfactants have been used in acid diversion and frac￾turing treatments in which high temperatures and low pH are usually involved [43].
These surfactants are often subjected to hydrolysis under such conditions because of
the existence of a peptide group −CO−NH− in their molecules, leading to changes
in the rheological properties of the acid.
The impact of hydrolysis at high temperatures on the apparent viscosity of
carboxybetaine viscoelastic surfactant-based acids has been studied. The mechanism
of viscosity changes by molecular dynamics simulations has been proposed.
Surfactant-acid solutions with different compositions (surfactant concentration
varied from 4% to 8%) were incubated at 88 ◦C for 1-6 h. The solutions were then
partially spent by CaCO3 until the sample pH was 4.5. Then, the apparent viscosity
was measured using a high-temperature/high-pressure viscometer. To understand
the mechanism for viscosity changes at the molecular level, molecular dynamics
simulations were carried out on the spent surfactant-acid aqueous systems [43].
It was found that short-time hydrolysis at high temperatures, for example, 1-2 h
at 88 ◦C led to a significant increase in the surfactant-acid viscosity. However, after
incubation for 3 h, phase separation occurred and the acid lost its viscosity. The
simulation showed that viscosity changes of amido-carboxybetaine surfactant-acid
by hydrolysis at high temperatures may be caused by different micellar structures
formed by carboxybetaine and fatty acid soap, which is its hydrolysis product. The
optimum molar ratio of amido-carboxybetaine and fatty acid soap to form worm-like
micelles was found to be nearly 3:1.
Obviously, the hydrolysis at high temperatures has a great impact on surfactant￾acid rheological properties. Short-time viscosity buildup and effective gel breakdown
can be achieved if surfactant-acid treatments must be carefully designed. Otherwise,
an unexpected viscosity reduction and phase separation may occur, which will affect
the results of acid treatments [43].
Miscellaneous polymers
A copolymer of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and AA is not soluble either in water or in
hydrocarbons. The ester units are hydrophobic and the acid units are hydrophilic. An
aqueous suspension with a particle size smaller than 10 μm can be useful in prepar￾ing aqueous hydraulic fracturing fluids [44]. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate is shown in
Figure 17.9.
A water-soluble polymer from N-vinyl lactam monomers or vinyl-containing
sulfonate monomers reduces the water loss and enhances other properties of well￾treating fluids in high-temperature subterranean environments [25]. Lignites, tannins,750 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids

and asphaltic materials are added as dispersants. Vinyl monomers for modification
are shown in Figure 17.10.
Lactide polymers
Degradable thermoplastic lactide polymers are used for fracturing fluids. Hydrolysis
is the primary mechanism for degradation of the lactide polymer [45].
Biodegradable formulations
Biodegradable drilling fluid formulations have been suggested. These are formula￾tions of a poly(saccharide) in a concentration insufficient to permit a contaminating
bacterial proliferation, namely a high-viscosity CMC sensitive to bacterial enzymes
produced by the degradation of the poly(saccharide) [46].
On the other hand, the biodegradability of mud additives is a problem [47]. The
biodegradability of seven kinds of mud additives was studied by determining the
content of dissolved oxygen in water, a simple biochemical oxygen demand testing
method. The biodegradability is high for starch but is lower for polymers of allyl
monomers and additives containing an aromatic group.
17.4.2 CONCENTRATES
Historically, fracture stimulation treatments have been performed by using con￾ventional batch mix techniques. This involves premixing chemicals into tanks and
circulating the fluids until a desired gelled fluid rheology is obtained. This method17.4 Water-based systems 751
is time consuming and burdens the oil company with disposal of the fluid if the
treatment ends prematurely.
Environmental concerns, such as when spillage occurs or disposal is involved, can
be avoided if the fluid is capable of being gelled as needed. Thus a newer technology
involves a gelling-as-needed technology with water, methanol, and oil [48]. This
procedure eliminates batch mixing and minimizes handling of chemicals and base
fluid. The customer is charged only for products used, and environmental concerns
regarding disposal are virtually eliminated. Computerized chemical addition and
monitoring, combined with on-site procedures, ensure quality control throughout a
treatment. Fluid rheologies can be accurately varied during the treatment by varying
polymer loading.
The use of a diesel-based concentrate with hydroxypropyl guar gum has been
evolved from the batch-mixed dry powder types [49]. The application of such a con￾centrate reduces system requirements. Companies can benefit from the convenience
of the reduced logistic burden that comes from using the diesel hydroxypropyl guar
gum concentrate.
A fracturing fluid slurry concentrate has been proposed [50] that consists of the
components shown in Table 17.6. Such a polymer slurry concentrate will readily
disperse and hydrate when admixed with water at the proper pH, thus producing
a high-viscosity aqueous fracturing fluid. The fracturing fluid slurry concentrate is
useful in producing large volumes of high-viscosity treating fluids at the well site on
a continuous basis. Surfactants in a slurry concentrate are shown in Figure 17.11.

Fluidized aqueous suspensions of 15% or more of HEC, hydrophobically mod￾ified cellulose ether, hydrophobically modified HEC, methyl cellulose, hydrox￾ypropylmethyl cellulose, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) are prepared by adding
the polymer to a concentrated sodium formate solution containing xanthan gum as a
stabilizer [51].
The xanthan gum is dissolved in water before sodium formate is added. Then the
polymer is added to the solution to form a fluid suspension of the polymers. The
polymer suspension can serve as an aqueous concentrate for further use.
17.4.3 FRICTION REDUCERS
Low pumping friction pressures are achieved by delaying the crosslinking, but there
are also specific additives available to reduce the drag in the tubings. The first
application of drag reducers was using guar in oil well fracturing, now a routine
practice.
Relatively small quantities of a bacterial cellulose (0.60-1.8 g l−1) in hydraulic
fracturing fluids enhance their rheologic properties [52]. The suspension of the
proppant is enhanced and friction loss through well casings is reduced.
17.4.4 FLUID LOSS ADDITIVES
Fluid loss additives are used widely as additives for drilling fluids. When fracturing
zones have high permeability, concern exists about damage to the matrix from deeply
penetrating fluid leak-off along the fracture or caused by the materials in the fluid that
minimize the amount of leak-off.
Several fracturing treatments in high-permeability formations, which are char￾acterized by short lengths, and often by disproportionate widths, exhibit positive
posttreatment skin effects. This is the result of fracture face-damage [53]. If the
invasion of the fracturing fluid is minimized, the degree of damage is of secondary
importance.
Thus, if the fluid leak-off penetration is small, even severe permeability
impairments can be tolerated without exhibiting positive skin effects. The first
priority in designing fracture treatments should be maximizing the conductivity
of the fracture. In high-permeability fracturing, the use of high concentrations
of polymer-crosslinked fracturing fluids with fluid loss additives and breakers is
recommended.
Materials used to minimize leak-off also have the potential to damage the
conductivity of the proppant pack. High shear rates at the tip of the fracture may
prevent the formation of external filter cakes, increasing the magnitude of spurt
losses in highly permeable formations. Therefore, particularly for fracturing tasks,
non-damaging additives are needed. Enzymatically degradable fluid loss additives
are available. Table 17.7 summarizes some fluid loss additives suitable for hydraulic
fracturing fluids.17.4 Water-based systems 753

Degradation of fluid loss additives
A fluid loss additive for fracturing fluids, which is a mixture of natural starch
(corn starch) and chemically modified starches (carboxymethyl and hydroxypropyl
derivatives) plus an enzyme, has been described [60,61]. The enzyme degrades the
α-linkage of starch but does not degrade the β-linkage of guar and modified guar
gums when used as a thickener.
The starches can be coated with a surfactant, such as sorbitan monooleate,
ethoxylated butanol, or ethoxylated nonyl phenol, to facilitate the dispersion into the
fracturing fluid. Modified starches or blends of modified and natural starches with
a broad particulate size distribution have been found to maintain the injected fluid
within the created fracture more effectively than natural starches [62]. The starches
can be degraded by oxidation or by bacterial attack.
17.4.5 pH CONTROL ADDITIVES
Buffers are necessary to adjust and maintain the pH. Buffering agents can be salts of
a weak acid and a weak base. Examples are carbonates, bicarbonates, and hydrogen
phosphates [63]. Weak acids such as formic acid, fumaric acid, and sulfamic acid
also are recommended. Common aqueous buffer ingredients are shown in Table 17.8
and in Figures 17.12 and 17.13.
For example, an increased temperature stability of various gums can be achieved
by adding sodium bicarbonate to the fracturing fluid and thus raising the pH of the
fracturing fluid to 9.2-10.4.
17.4.6 CLAY STABILIZERS
Advances in clay-bearing formation treatment have led to the development of
numerous clay stabilizing treatments and additives. Most additives used are high￾molecular-weight cationic organic polymers. However, it has been shown that these
stabilizers are less effective in low-permeability formations [64].754 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids

Weak organic acids.
The use of salts, such as potassium chloride and sodium chloride, as temporary
clay stabilizers during oil well drilling, completion, and servicing, has been in
practice for many years. Because of the bulk and potential environmental hazards
associated with the salts, many operators have looked for alternatives to replace
their use.
Recent research has developed a relationship between physical properties of
various cations (e.g., K+, Na+) and their efficiency as temporary clay stabilizers.
These properties were used to synthesize an organic cation (Table 17.9) with a higher
efficiency as a clay stabilizer than the typical salts used in the oil industry to this point.
These additives provide additional benefits when used in conjunction with
acidizing and fracturing treatments. A much lower salt concentration can be used
to obtain the same clay stabilizing effectiveness [72,73]. The liquid product has been
proven to be much easier to handle and transport. It is environmentally compatible
and biodegradable in its diluted form.

method of stabilization prevents any undesired degradation of the fracturing fluid,
such as reduction of its rheologic properties (which are necessary for conducting the
hydraulic fracturing operation) at high temperatures. Biocides suitable for fracturing
fluids are shown in Table 17.10 and Figure 17.14.
17.4.8 SURFACTANTS
Surface active agents are included in most aqueous treating fluids to improve
the compatibility of aqueous fluids with the hydrocarbon-containing reservoir. To
achieve maximal conductivity of hydrocarbons from subterranean formations after
fracture or other stimulation, it is the practice to cause the formation surfaces to be
water-wet.756 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids

the surfaces and water and hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons displace injected water,
leaving a lower water saturation and an increased flow of hydrocarbons through
capillaries and flow channels in the formation.
A methyl quaternized erucyl amine is useful for aqueous viscoelastic surfactant￾based fracturing fluids in high-temperature and high-permeability formations [81].
17.4.9 CROSSLINKERS
Kinetics of crosslinking
The rheology of hydroxypropyl guar is greatly complicated by the crosslinking
reactions with titanium ions. A study to better understand the rheology of the reaction
of hydroxypropyl guar with titanium chelates and how the rheology depends on the
residence time, shear history, and chemical composition has been performed [82].
Rheologic experiments were performed to obtain information about the kinetics
of crosslinking in hydroxypropyl guar. Continuous flow and dynamic data suggest a
crosslinking reaction order of approximately 4/3 and 2/3, respectively, with respect758 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
to the crosslinker and hydroxypropyl guar concentration. Dynamic tests have shown
that the shearing time is important in determining the final gel properties.
Continued steady shear and dynamic tests show that high shear irreversibly
destroys the gel structure, and the extent of the crosslinking reaction decreases
with increasing shear. Studies at shear rates below 100 s−1 suggest a shear-induced
structural change in the polymer that affects the chemistry of the reaction and the
nature of the product molecule.
Delayed crosslinking
Delayed crosslinking is desirable because the fluid can be pumped down more easily.
A delay is a retarded reaction rate of crosslinking. This can be achieved with the
methods explained in the following section.
Borate systems
Boric acid can form complexes with hydroxyl compounds. The mechanism of
formation complexes of boric acid with glycerol is shown in Figure 17.15. Three
hydroxyl units form an ester and one unit forms a complex bond. Here a proton will
be released that lowers the pH. The scheme is valid also for polyhydroxy compounds.
In this case, two polymer chains are connected via such a link.
The control of the delay time requires the control of the pH, the availability of
borate ions, or both. Control of pH can be effective in fresh water systems [83].
However, the control of borate is effective in both fresh water and sea water. This
may be accomplished by using sparingly soluble borate species or by complexing
the borate with a variety of organic species.
Borate-crosslinked fracturing fluids have been successfully used in fracturing
operations. These fluids provide excellent rheologic, fluid loss, and fracture con￾ductivity properties over fluid temperatures up to 105 ◦C. The mechanism of borate
crosslinking is an equilibrium process that can produce very high fluid viscosities

under conditions of low shear [84]. A fracturing fluid containing borate is prepared
in the following way [85]:
1. introducing a poly(saccharide) polymer into (sea) water to produce a gel,
2. adding an alkaline agent to the gel to obtain a pH of at least 9.5, and
3. adding a borate crosslinking agent to the gel to crosslink the polymer.
A dry granular composition can be prepared in the following way [86]:
1. dissolving from 0.2% to 1.0% of a water-soluble poly(saccharide) in an aqueous
solution,
2. admixing a borate source with the aqueous gel formed in step 1,
3. drying the borate-crosslinked poly(saccharide) formed in step 2, and
4. granulating the product of step 3.
A borate-crosslinking agent can be boric acid, borax, an alkaline earth metal
borate, or an alkali metal alkaline earth metal borate. The borate source, calculated
as boric oxide, must be present in an amount of 5-30%.
Borated starch compositions are useful for controlling the rate of crosslinking
of hydratable polymers in aqueous media for use in fracturing fluids. The borated
starch compositions are prepared by reacting, in an aqueous medium, starch and a
borate source to form a borated starch complex. This complex provides a source of
borate ions, which cause crosslinking of hydratable polymers in aqueous media [87].
Delayed crosslinking takes place at low temperatures.
Glyoxal [88–90] is effective as a delay additive within a certain pH range. Glyoxal
is shown in Figure 17.16. It bonds chemically with both boric acid and the borate
ions to limit the number of borate ions initially available in solution for subsequent
crosslinking of a hydratable poly(saccharide) (e.g., galactomannan).
The subsequent rate of crosslinking of the poly(saccharide) can be controlled by
adjusting the pH of the solution. The mechanism of delayed crosslinking is shown in
Figure 17.17. If two hydroxyl compounds with low molecular weight are exchanged
with high-molecular-weight compounds, the hydroxyl units belonging to different
molecules, then a crosslink is formed.
Other dialdehydes, keto aldehydes, hydroxyl aldehydes, ortho-substituted aro￾matic dialdehydes, and ortho-substituted aromatic hydroxyl aldehydes have been
claimed to be active in a similar way [91]. Borate-crosslinked guar fracturing fluids
have been reformulated to allow use at higher temperatures in both fresh water and
sea water.

Delayed crosslinking.
The temporary temperature range is extended for the use of magnesium oxide–
delayed borate crosslinking of a galactomannan gum fracturing fluid by adding
fluoride ions that precipitate insoluble magnesium fluoride [92].
Alternatively, a chelating agent for the magnesium ion may be added. With the
precipitation of magnesium fluoride or the chelation of the magnesium ion, insoluble
magnesium hydroxide cannot form at elevated temperatures, which would otherwise
lower the pH and reverse the borate crosslinking reaction. The addition effectively
extends the use of such fracturing fluids to temperatures of 135-150 ◦C.
Polyols, such as glycols or glycerol, can delay the crosslinking of borate in hy￾draulic fracturing fluids based on galactomannan gum [93]. This is suitable for high￾temperature applications up to 150 ◦C. In this case, low molecular weight borate com￾plexes are initially formed but exchange slowly with the hydroxyl groups of the gum.
Titanium compounds
Organic titanium compounds are useful as crosslinkers [94]. Aqueous titanium
compositions often consist of mixtures of titanium compounds.
Zirconium compounds
Various zirconium compounds are used as delayed crosslinkers, c.f., Table 17.11. The
initially formed complexes with low molecular weight compounds are exchanged
with intermolecular poly(saccharide) complexes, which cause delayed crosslinking.

17.4.10 GEL BREAKING IN WATER-BASED SYSTEMS
In general, there are two methods for combining the fracturing fluid and the
breaker [102]:
1. mixing the breaker with the fracturing fluid prior to sending the fracturing fluid
downhole, or
2. sending the fracturing downhole, and afterwards the breaker.
The first method is favored at least because of convenience. It is easier to mix the
fluids at the surface and send the mixture downhole. A disadvantage of this blending
method is that the breaker can decrease the viscosity of the fracturing fluid before the
desired time.
In the second method, the fracturing fluid is sent downhole, and the breaker
is sent downhole later. While sending the breaker downhole later is inconvenient,
in this method the breaker does not decrease the viscosity of the fracturing fluid
prematurely [102].
After the fracturing job, the properties of the formation should be restored.
Maximal well production can be achieved only when the solution viscosity and the17.4 Water-based systems 763
molecular weight of the gelling agent are significantly reduced after the treatment,
that is, the fluid is degraded.
Basic studies
Comprehensive research on the degradation kinetics of a hydroxypropyl guar frac￾turing fluid by enzyme, oxidative, and catalyzed oxidative breakers was performed
[103–105]. Changes in viscosity were measured as a function of time.
The studies revealed that enzyme breakers are effective only in acid media
at temperatures of 60 ◦C or below. In an alkaline medium and at temperatures
below 50 ◦C, a catalyzed oxidative breaker system was the most effective breaker.
At temperatures of 50 ◦C or higher, hydroxypropyl guar fracturing fluids can be
degraded by an oxidative breaker without a catalyst.
Oxidative breakers
Among the oxidative breakers, alkali, metal hypochlorites, and inorganic and
organic peroxides have been described in the literature. These materials degrade the
polymer chains by oxidative mechanisms. CMC, guar gum, or partially hydrolyzed
poly(acrylamide)s were used for testing a series of oxidative gel breakers in a
laboratory study [106].
Hypochlorite salts
Hypochlorites are powerful oxidants and therefore may degrade polymeric chains.
They are often used in combination with tertiary amines [107]. The combination of
the salt and the tertiary amine increases the reaction rate more than the application
of a hypochlorite alone. A tertiary amino galactomannan may serve as an amine
source [108].
This also serves as a thickener before breaking. Hypochlorites are also effective
for breaking stabilized fluids [109]. Sodium thiosulfate has been proposed as a
stabilizer for high-temperature applications.
Peroxide breakers
Alkaline earth metal peroxides have been described as delayed gel breakers in
alkaline aqueous fluids containing hydroxypropyl guar [110]. The peroxides are
activated by increasing the temperature of the fluid.
Perphosphate esters or amides can be used for oxidative gel breaking [111].
Whereas the salts of the perphosphate ion interfere with the action of the crosslinkers,
the esters and amides of perphosphate do not.
Fracturing fluids that contain these breakers are useful for fracturing deeper
wells operating at temperatures of 90-120 ◦C and using metal ion crosslinkers, such
as titanium and zirconium. Breaker systems based on persulfates have also been
described [112].
In addition, organic peroxides are suitable for gel breaking [113]. The peroxides
need not be completely soluble in water. The time needed to break is controlled in
the range of 4-24 h by adjusting the amount of breaker added to the fluid.764 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
Nonoxidative breakers
Oxidizing chemicals have remained the primary gel breakers to break down the filter
cake and establish regained formation permeability or fracture conductivity [114].
These breakers presumably oxidize the polymer backbone, causing chain breakdown
and facilitating fluid flowback. Safety hazards associated with using bulk quantities
are one of the many potential problems associated with the use of oxidizing agents
as gel breakers. Proper timing of gel breakdown is of utmost importance with
respect to oxidizing gel breakers. Conversely, premature polymer oxidation can cause
premature proppant settling. On the other hand, a long delay between the completion
of the fracturing operation and activation of the gel breaker could cause the deposition
of additional filter cake on fracture faces, which could be difficult to break down.
A desirable advancement of designing improved fracturing fluids is to develop
non-oxidizing gel breakers that can reverse the crosslinking of the gels by a reaction
with the crosslinking agent, rather than only breaking down the polymer chain [114].
In addition, by insolubilizing such breakers, they can be embedded in the filter
cake and, when activated, they can degrade the filter cake completely without leaving
any residues.
For example, aspartic acid can be formed from poly(succiniminde) by hydrolysis
as shown in Figure 17.21.
Aspartic acid is effective in decomplexing zirconia complexes that are used for
guar complexes.
Synthetic disks of different porosities have been used to simulate the formation
permeability damage caused by filter cakes formed by Zr-crosslinked, carboxylated
guar-based gels [114].
Non-crosslinked base polymer solutions do not cause any permeability dam￾age. Non-crosslinked polymer fluids produced from Zr-crosslinked gels by use of

decomplexing, nonoxidizer breakers also did not significantly damage the perme￾ability compared with the fluids produced from conventional, oxidizer-type breakers.
Ortho-disubstituted aromatic compounds containing polar heteroatoms capable
of functioning as potentially strong ligands for zirconium were found to be suitable
as decomplexing breakers. Biopolymers containing such functional groups, notably
lignosulfonate derivatives, are promising commercially viable alternatives to oxidiz￾ing breakers for metal-crosslinked fracturing fluids [114].
Redox gel breakers
Basically, gel breakers act according to a redox reaction. Copper (II) ions and amines
can degrade various poly(saccharide)s [115].
Delayed release of acid
Regained permeability studies with HEC polymer in high-permeability cores
revealed that persulfate-type oxidizing breakers and enzyme breakers do not
adequately degrade the polymer. Sodium persulfate breakers were found to be
thermally decomposed, and the decomposition was accelerated by minerals present
in the formation.
The enzyme breaker adsorbed onto the formation but still partly functioned as a
breaker. Dynamic fluid loss tests at reduced pH with borate-crosslinked gels suggest
that accelerated leak-off away from the wellbore could be obtained through the use
of a delayed-release acid. Rheologic measurements confirmed that a soluble delayed￾release acid could be used to convert a borate-crosslinked fluid into a linear gel [116].
A condensation product of hydroxyacetic acid can be used as a fluid loss material
in a fracturing fluid in which another hydrolyzable aqueous gel is used [117–120].
The hydroxyacetic acid condensation product degrades at formation conditions to set
free hydroxyacetic acid, which breaks the aqueous gel. This mechanism may be used
for delayed gel breaking, as shown in Figure 17.22. Here the permeability is restored
without the need for separate addition of a gel breaker, and the condensation product
acts a fluid loss additive.
Enzyme gel breakers
Enzymes specifically cleave the backbone structure of the thickeners and eventually
of the fluid loss additive. They offer several advantages to other breaker systems
because of their inherent specificity and the infinite polymer-degrading activity.
Initially the application of enzymes has been limited to low-temperature fracturing

aElevated temperatures and salt concentrations
bHigh alkalinity and elevated temperature
treatments because of pH and temperature constraints. Only recently, extreme
temperature-stable and polymer-specific enzymes have been developed [121].
Basic studies
Basic studies have been performed to investigate the performance of enzymes. The
products of degradation, the kinetics of degradation, and limits of application, such
as temperature and pH, have been analyzed [122,123]. Because enzymes degrade
chemical linkages highly selectively, no general purpose enzyme exists, but for each
thickener, a selected enzyme must be applied to guarantee success. Enzymes suitable
for particulate systems are shown in Table 17.12.
Enzymes are suitable to break the chains of the thickener directly. Other systems
also have been described that enzymatically degrade polymers, which degrade into
organic acid molecules. These molecules are actually active in the degradation of the
thickener [126].
Interactions
Despite their advantages over conventional oxidative breakers, enzyme breakers have
limitations because of interferences and incompatibilities with other additives. Inter￾actions between enzyme breakers and fracturing fluid additives including biocides,
clay stabilizers, and certain types of resin-coated proppants have been reported [127].
Encapsulated gel breakers
The breaker chemical in encapsulated gel breakers is encapsulated in a membrane
that is not permeable or is only slightly permeable to the breaker. Therefore, the
breaker may not come in contact initially with the polymer to be degraded. Only with
time the breaker diffuses out from the capsulation, or the capsulation is destroyed so
that the breaker can act successfully.
Encapsulated gel breakers find a wide field of application for delayed gel
breaking. The breaker is prepared by encapsulating it with a water-resistant coating.
The coating shields the fluid from the breaker so that a high concentration of breaker
can be added to the fluid without causing premature loss of fluid properties, such as
viscosity or fluid loss control.
Critical factors in the design of encapsulated breakers are the barrier properties
of the coating, release mechanisms, and the properties of the reactive chemicals. For
example, a hydrolytically degradable polymer can be used as the membrane [128].17.4 Water-based systems 767

This method of delayed gel breaking has been reported both for oxidative

Gel breaking of guar
Maximal well production can be achieved only when the solution viscosity and the
molecular weight of the gelling agent are significantly reduced after the treatment.
However, the reduction of the fracturing fluid viscosity, the traditional method of
evaluating these materials, does not necessarily indicate that the gelling agent has
been thoroughly degraded also.
The reaction between hydroxypropyl guar and the oxidizing agent (ammonium
peroxydisulfate) in an aqueous potassium chloride solution was studied [141] under
controlled conditions to determine changes in solution viscosity and the weight
average of the molecular mass of hydroxypropyl guar.
Bromine compositions used for gel breaking can be stabilized with sodium
sulfamate [102]. The sulfamate used in the production of such breakers is effective
in stabilizing the active bromine species over long periods of time, especially at a pH
of 13. For example, a WELLGUARD™ 7137 gel breaker is stable for greater than 1
year if protected from sunlight. The halogen source of the breaker are interhalogen
compounds, bromine chloride, or mixtures of bromine and chlorine.
Unlike hypobromites (−OBr), these type breakers do not oxidize or otherwise
destroy organic phosphonates that are typically used as corrosion and scale inhibitors.768 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids

Effect of halogen-based breakers on guar [102].
Further, the breakers exhibit a low corrosivity against metals, especially against
ferrous alloys. This is the result of the low oxidation-reduction potential of these
breakers [102,142]. The effect of the breakers on guar is shown in Figure 17.23. The
composition was prepared and studied at 50 ◦C (120 ◦F).
Borate-crosslinked guar polymer gels can be broken with EDTA com￾pounds [143]. EDTA and other amino carboxylic acid compounds can break the
gelled fracturing fluid. Examples are shown in Table 17.15.
It is believed these breakers act directly on the polymer itself and not on any
crosslinker that may be present. Also polyhydroxy compounds can break guar gels,
and moreover gels formed by poly(saccharide)s. These polyhydroxy compounds

include mannitol and sorbitol. The polyols can be used incombnination of enzyme
breakers [144].
Gel breaking of viscoelastic surfactant gelled fluids
The viscosity of fluids that are viscosified with VESs can be controlled by fatty acid
salts. For example, a brine fluid gelled with an amine oxide surfactant may have its
viscosity broken with a composition containing naturally occurring fatty acid salts
from canola oil or corn oil [145].
The alteration of the fatty acid or the saponification reaction may occur during
mixing and pumping of the fluid downhole. The method may also be used where
most of the saponification occurs within the reservoir shortly after the treatment is
over. Alternatively, the components may be preformed and added later as an external
breaker solution to remove the VES-gelled fluids that have been already placed
downhole.
It may be possible that first an increase in viscosity and afterwards a decrease
in viscosity may occur. When canola oil is saponified with CaOH, initially a slight
increase of the VES fluid is observed, followed by a breaking reaction [145]. The
increase in viscosity is explained, as the initially particular saponified fatty acids
may act as viscosity enhancing cosurfactants for the fluid containing VESs.
Granules
Granules may also be helpful in delayed breaking. Granules with 40-90% of sodium
or ammonium persulfate breaker and 10-60% of an inorganic powdered binder, such
as clay, have been described [146]. The granules exhibit a delayed release of the
breaker.
Other chemicals acting as delayed gel breakers are also addressed as con￾trolled solubility compounds or cleanup additives that slowly release certain salts.
Poly(phosphate)s have been described as such [147].
Granules composed of a particulate breaker dispersed in a wax matrix are used
in fracturing operations to break hydrocarbon liquids gelled with salts of alkyl
phosphate esters. The wax granules are solid at surface temperature and melt or
disperse in the hydrocarbon liquid at formation temperature, releasing the breaker
to react with the gelling agent [148].
17.4.11 SCALE INHIBITORS
The formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), calcium sulfate (CaSO4), and barium
sulfate (BaSO4) scales in brine may create problems with permeability [149].
Calcium sulfate is one of the major mineral scales in oil and gas production [150].
Hemihydrate CaSO4×5H2O and anhydrite CaSO4 are the predominant sulfate scales
formed at high temperature, while gypsum CaSO4 × 2H2O scale may form at low
temperatures of <45 ◦C. However, it has been shown that anhydrite can form at low770 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
temperature in the presence of excess amounts of ethylene glycol. This may occur
during the offshore production with long tie-backs.
The prediction and prevention of calcium sulfate scales requires knowledge of the
phase behavior of the three major phases of calcium sulfate. The phase behavior of
different calcium sulfate phases is related to the supersaturation state, temperature,
and fugacity of water.
Three approaches have been done to determine the kinetics of the phase transition
calcium sulfate at various temperatures, ionic strengths, and MEG concentra￾tions [150]:
1. dissolution of gypsum,
2. dissolution of anhydrite, and
3. nucleation and precipitation of calcium sulfate by mixing calcium- and
sulfate-containing solutions.
A phase transition of gypsum to anhydrite was observed in the presence of high
concentrations of NaCl and ethylene glycol.
The inhibition mechanism of hexamethylene diamine tetra(methylene phos￾phonic acid), which is a highly effective inhibitor for calcium sulfate scale, was
tested by investigating the kinetics of precipitation and the inhibition of calcium
sulfate [150].
It is advantageous that newly made fractures have a scale inhibitor in place in the
fracture to help prevent the formation of scale. Formulations of hydraulic fracturing
fluids containing a scale inhibitor have been described in the literature [149].
Interference of chelate formers
Trace amounts of metal chelate-forming additives, which are used in fracture fluids,
have been shown to have a debilitating effect on the performance of widely used
barium sulfate scale inhibitors. Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, citric acid, and
gluconic acid render some scale inhibitors, such as phosphonates, polycarboxylates,
and phosphate esters, completely ineffective at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg l−1.
Such low concentrations may be expected to return from formation stimulation
treatments for many months and would appear to jeopardize any scale inhibitor
program in place.
This conclusion follows from experiments with a simulated North Sea scaling
system at pH 4 and 6. The scale inhibitor concentrations studied were 50 and 100
mg l−1. The large negative effect of the organic chelating agents was observed at
pH 4 and 6. The only scale inhibitors studied that remained unaffected by these
interferences were poly(vinyl sulfonate)s [151].
Encapsulated scale inhibitors
A solid, encapsulated scale inhibitor (calcium-magnesium poly(phosphate)) has been
developed and extensively tested for use in fracturing treatments [152–154]. The
inhibitor is compatible with borate-crosslinked and zirconium-crosslinked fracturing
fluids and foamed fluids because of coating.17.4 Water-based systems 771
The coating exhibits a short-term effect on the release rate profile. The com￾position of the solid derivative has the greatest effect on its long-term release rate
profile.
17.4.12 ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ACTIVATOR SOLVENTS
The use of glycol ethers, especially ethylene glycol monobutyl ethers (EGMBE)s,
has come under increased pressure from a health, safety, and environment perspec￾tive [155]. EGMBE is a suspected carcinogen for humans, causes hemolysis.
With full disclosure rules for oil and gas chemicals being adopted for hydraulic
fracturing fluids in most oil producing states jurisdictions, there is an increased ur￾gency to have greener solvents in formulations. Some solvents have been used instead
of EGMBE. However, many such solvents suffer the same drawbacks as EGMBE,
such as being environmentally unfriendly or similarly toxic and hazardous. These are
other glycol ethers like propylene glycol n-butyl ether, diethylene glycol butyl ether,
ethylene glycol monoacetate, triethylene glycol monoethyl ether, 1,1
-oxybis(2-
propanol), triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, triglyme, and diglyme [155].
Glycol ethers are commonly used as activator solvents in guar gum-mineral
oil slurries. Guar slurries are dispersions of dry guar particles in mineral oil with
hydrophobically modified clay as the suspending aid. Glycol ether solvents, e.g.,
EGMBE, are conventionally added as activator solvents for the clay. Such activator
solvents break up the galleries to disperse the clay platelets in mineral oil.
The activated clay serves to thicken the carrier, generally mineral oil, or to form
a weak gel or pre-gel to help suspend the guar particles and make a stable slurry.
Stable slurries where the guar remains suspended for a sufficient period of time
are important in application for storage and transport. If the particles settle and hard
pack as a sediment, the slurry becomes hard to handle and difficult to pump or to
pour out of drums in the field.
Methods for use of poly(saccharide) slurries and suspension compositions
that use environmentally friendly solvents and activator solvents have been
disclosed [155].
It has been discovered that compositions that utilize instead of EGMBE esters
of diacids as activator solvents for the clay in guar slurries are advantageous in
dispersing the clay and are providing stable slurries [155].
The diacids in the form of mixtures can be obtained from a mixture of dinitrile
compounds that are produced and recovered in the process for the manufacture
of adiponitrile by the double hydrocyanation of butadiene. This process is used
industrially to produce the greater majority of the adiponitrile consumed worldwide.
The reaction for the hydrocyanation of butadiene results predominantly in the
formation of linear dinitriles but also in the formation of branched dinitriles, the two
main ones of which are methylglutaronitrile and ethylsuccinonitrile.
Branched dinitrile compounds are separated by distillation and recovered as top
fraction in a distillation column, in the stages for separation and purification of the
adiponitrile. The branched dinitriles can subsequently be converted to diacids or772 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
diesters. Dibasic esters may be derived from the byproducts of the production of
poly(amide) [155].
17.4.13 TREATMENT OF FLOWBACK WATER
Flowback water generally contains high salinity and total dissolved solids. Flowback
waters consist of water, the fracturing chemicals that were injected into the well,
as well as any contaminants that are present in the rock formation water [156]. In
addition to natural salinity of water in the formation, any fresh water that is injected
into the well during the fracturing process will tend to dissolve salts in the formation,
thus increasing the salinity of the flowback water.
It is desirable to reuse the flowback water in a subsequent fracturing operation.
However, carbonate and sulfate ions present in the flowback water can form
precipitates such as calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, and iron
carbonate within the underground fracture network and cause scale accumulation
in perforations or fissures in the fractured rock [156].
The presence of iron provides a significant and complex problem in well stimu￾lation operations. Iron in the ferric state can form iron complexes that can block flow
pathways and inhibit the flow of gas or oil therethrough. Also, iron can impair the
performance of fracturing fluid components, such as the friction reducing additive.
In oil and gas wells, air can be introduced into water present in the underground
formation through the borehole or by commingling of underground water with air￾saturated water which has been pumped from the surface into the well.
Ground or well water typically exists in a reducing environment. As a result, iron
in ground or well water typically is present as the ferrous ion species.
Ferric ion complexes, such as hydrated ferric oxides, are much less soluble than
ferrous iron, and once formed can readily precipitate. The accumulation of these
solids can block pores and flow pathways in the oil or gas well formation, thus
causing permeability impairment with an associated decline in oil or gas flow. It
is believed that when iron is present in soluble or dispersed form, it is less likely to
block the flow pathways, thus enhancing production potential of the well [156].
The formation or precipitation of iron oxides can be inhibited by stabilization of
the ferrous ion, or suspension or dispersion of the iron oxides. To prevent clogging
of the flow pathways in oil and gas well formations, chelating agents have been used.
Citric acid, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, and nitriloacetic acid are common iron
chelating agents used for iron control in a fracturing fluid design [156].
17.5 OIL-BASED SYSTEMS
One advantage of fracturing with hydrocarbon gels compared with water-based gels
is that some formations may tend to imbibe large quantities of water, whereas others
are water sensitive and will swell if water is introduced.17.5 Oil-based systems 773
17.5.1 ORGANIC GEL ALUMINUM PHOSPHATE ESTER
A gel of diesel or crude oil can be produced using a phosphate diester or an
aluminum compound with phosphate diester [157]. The metal phosphate diester
may be prepared by reacting a triester with phosphorous pentoxide to produce
a poly(phosphate), which is then reacted with hexanol to produce a phosphate
diester [158].
The latter diester is then added to the organic liquid along with a non-aqueous
source of aluminum, such as aluminum isopropoxide, c.f., Figure 17.24, in diesel
oil, to produce the metal phosphate diester. The conditions in the previous reaction
steps are controlled to provide a gel with good viscosity versus temperature and time
characteristics. All the reagents are substantially free of water and will not affect the
pH. The synthesis of a phosphate diesters is shown in Figure 17.25. It runs via triethyl
phosphate, phosphorous pentoxide, and the esterification reaction with hexanol.
Enhancers for phosphate esters are amino compounds [159]. The 2-ethylhexanoic
acid trialuminum salt has been suggested with fatty acids as an activator [160].
Another method to produce oil-based hydrocarbon gels is to use ferric salts [161]
rather than aluminum compounds for combination with orthophosphate esters. The
ferric salt has the advantage of being usable in the presence of large amounts of water,
up to 20%. Ferric salts can be applied in wide ranges of pH. The linkages that are
formed can still be broken with gel breaking additives conventionally used for that
purpose.
17.5.2 INCREASING THE VISCOSITY OF DIESEL
A copolymer of N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N,N-dimethyl aminopropyl methacry￾lamide, a monocarboxylic acid, and ethanolamine may serve to increase the viscosity
of diesel or kerosene [162]. These compounds are shown in Figure 17.26.

is useful in breaking nonaqueous gels [163]. Sodium bicarbonate used by itself is
totally ineffective for breaking the fracturing fluid for aluminum phosphate based or
aluminum phosphate ester-based gellants. An alternative is to use sodium acetate as
a gel breaker for nonaqueous gels.
17.6 FOAM-BASED FRACTURING FLUIDS
Foam fluids can be used in many fracturing jobs, especially when environmental
sensitivity is a concern [164]. Foam-fluid formulations are reusable, are shear stable,
and form stable foams over a wide temperature range. They exhibit high viscosities
even at relatively high temperatures [165].
A foamed fracturing fluid has a relatively large volume of gas dispersed in a
relatively small volume of liquid. A foamed fracturing fluid also includes a surfactant
for facilitating the foaming and stabilization of the foam produced when the gas is
mixed with the liquid [21].
A coarse foamed fluid has a relatively nonuniform bubble size distribution, e.g., a
combination of large and small gas bubbles, whereas a fine texture foam has relatively
uniform bubble size distribution and most of the bubbles are relatively small [166].
In coarse foamed fracturing fluids, there may be also regions of fine textured
foam. Such foams are able to support proppant in the fine textured regions even at
very high foam quality levels. The most commonly used gases for foamed fracturing
fluids are nitrogen and carbon dioxide because they are non-combustible, readily
available, and relatively cheap [21].
The content of the gas is called quality, therefore a 70 quality contains 70% gas.
Recently, foams with 95% gas have been examined. For such foam types, only foam
prepared from 2% of an anionic surfactant with plain water had uniform, fine-bubble
structure [167].
Surfactants are available that change their power of foaming. For example,
a tertiary alkyl amine ethoxylate can be changed from a foaming surfactant to
a nonfoaming surfactant by the lowering the pH of the environment, by adding
hydrogen ions. It can then be changed back to a foaming surfactant by the addition
of a basic material, e.g., hydroxide ions. At low pH the amine group is quaternized,
as shown in Figure 17.27.
Further, cocobetaine and α-olefin sulfonate have been proposed as foamers [168].
A preferred amphoteric surfactant is a mixture of laury-lamine and myristylamine
oxide. Lauryl betaine is shown in Figure 17.28.
Recyclable foamed fracturing fluids are available [169]. After placement, the pH
of the fracturing fluid is changed so that the foam is destroyed. At this stage, the
fracturing fluid also releases its proppant. Afterwards, the fracturing fluid is allowed
to flow back to the surface. Eventually, it can be recycled by changing the pH of the
fracturing fluid back to the first pH and adding a gas to the fluid, causing it to foam
again.776 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids

17.6.1 FOAMED FLUIDS
Fluid technologies incorporating a gaseous component or a supercritical fluid to
form a foam or energized fluid are commonly used in the stimulation of oil and gas
wells [170].
For example, some viscoelastic fluids used as fracturing fluids contain a gas
such as air, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide to provide an energized fluid or foam. Such
fluids are commonly formed by injecting an aqueous solution, i.e., the base fluid,
concomitantly with a gas, most commonly nitrogen, carbon dioxide or their mixtures,
into the formation.
Among other benefits, the dispersion of the gas into the base fluid in the form
of bubbles or droplets increases the viscosity of such fluid and impacts positively its
performance, particularly its ability to effectively induce hydraulic fracturing of the
formation, and also its capacity to carry proppants that are placed within the fractures
to create pathways through which oil or gas can be further produced.
The presence of the gas also enhances the flowback of the base fluid from the
interstices of the formation and of the proppant pack into the wellbore, due to
the expansion of such gas once the pressure is reduced at the wellhead at the end
of the fracturing operation.
Other common uses of foams or energized fluids include [170]:
• wellbore cleanout,
• gravel packing,17.6 Foam-based fracturing fluids 777
• acid diversion, and
• fluid loss control.
Foamed and energized fracturing fluids must contain foaming agents. These are
most commonly surfactants or surfactant blends that facilitate the dispersion of the
gas into the base fluid in the form of small bubbles or droplets, and confer stability
to the dispersion by retarding the coalescence or recombination of such bubbles or
droplets.
Foamed and energized fracturing fluids are generally described by their foam
quality, i.e., the ratio of gas volume to the foam volume. If the foam quality is 52-
95%, the fluid is conventionally called foam, and below 52%, an energized fluid.
The ability to formulate stable energized fluids with rheological properties
suitable for fracturing operations becomes increasingly difficult as the temperature
of the subterranean formation increases. This is still worsened when carbon dioxide
is present in the gas phase, since carbon dioxide exhibits high solubility in aqueous
solutions. The high solubility of carbon dioxide facilitates mass transfer between
bubbles and accelerates foam-destabilizing mechanisms such as so-called Ostwald
ripening [171], which ultimately lead to phase separation and to the loss of fluid
viscosity.
Furthermore, carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid. The
formation of carbonic acid imposes a low-pH environment for the fluid, typically
in the range of 3.5-4, thus impeding the necessary control of pH for efficient
crosslinking with borate ions and often with other metallic ions. Exposure to low pH
and high temperatures promotes degradation of the polymeric chains, particularly if
polysaccharides are used as viscosifying agents, thus contributing to the referred loss
of foam stability and viscosity.
Suitable chemicals to formulate viscous foams and energized fluids containing
carbon dioxide, particularly at elevated temperatures in excess of about 120 ◦C have
been described [170].
These are zwitterionic surfactants, such as erucylamidopropyl betaine [170]. Rhe￾ology enhancers may be used together with viscoelastic surfactants, e.g., poly(vinyl
alcohol). These may be used to shorten the shear recovery time, to increase the
viscosity of the fluid, or to provide a greater tolerance to the brines.
17.6.2 DEFOAMERS
A defoamer and an antifoamer composition are described for defoaming aqueous
fluid systems [172]. The composition of a typical defoamer for hydraulic fracturing
fluids is shown in Table 17.16.
Orthoesters are added that will generate acids in order to degrade the foam. Exam￾ples of suitable orthoesters and poly(orthoesters) are trimethyl orthoacetate, triethyl
orthoacetate, and the corresponding orthoformates. By the way, poly(orthoesters)
are important in medical applications [173]. Some simple orthoesters are shown in

Synthesis of orthoesters.
The synthesis of orthoesters may proceed either by a Williamson synthesis or
by the addition of alcohols to a cyanide. The respective reactions are shown in
Figure 17.30.
Orthoesters are stable toward alkalis, but not stable toward acids and water. The
orthoester decreases the pH of the foamed fracturing fluid to sufficiently convert
the foaming surfactant to a nonfoaming surfactant, whereby the foamed fracturing
fluid substantially defoams. To allow the orthoester to hydrolyze to produce an acid,
a source of water is needed, whether from the formation or introduced into the17.8 Horizontal wells 779
formation. The water should be present in an amount of 2 mol of water per mol
of orthoester.
When the orthoester ultimately hydrolyzes and generates the acid, the acid may
react with the foaming surfactant making it to become predominantly a nonfoaming
surfactant [21]. The orthoester compositions may also contain an inhibitor, which
may delay the generation of the acid from the orthoester of the orthoester composi￾tion. In addition, they may neutralize any generated acid during the delay period.
Suitable inhibitors include bases., e.g., alkali hydroxides, sodium carbonate, or
hexamethylenetetramine.
Sometimes a small amount of a strong base as opposed to a large amount of
a relatively weak base is preferred to achieve the delayed generation of the acid
and the neutralization of the generated acid for a desired delay period [21]. A
foamed fracturing composition may in addition contain other usual ingredients,
such as [21]:
• gelling agents,
• bactericides, and
• Proppants.
17.7 FRACTURING IN COAL-BEDS
The production of natural gas from coal typically requires a stimulation with
hydraulic fracturing. Basic studies on the effectiveness of various treatment methods
for coal-beds have been presented in the literature [174,175].
Treating a coal seam with a well treatment fluid containing a dewatering agent
will enhance the methane production through a well. This additive enhances the
permeability of the formation to water production and binds tenaciously to the
coal surface so that the permeability enhancement benefits are realized over a long
production term.
Dewatering surfactants can be poly(oxyethylene), poly(oxypropylene), and
poly(ethylene carbonate)s [176] or p-tert-amylphenol condensed with formaldehyde,
or they can be composed of a copolymer from 80% to 100% alkyl methacrylate
monomers and hydrophilic monomers [177]. Selected compounds for this purpose
are shown in Figure 17.31.
Such a well treatment fluid may be used in both fracturing and competition
operations to enhance and maintain fracture conductivity over an extended period
of production.
17.8 HORIZONTAL WELLS
A method for the quantitative determination of porosity, permeability, and rock￾mechanics properties from drill cuttings of at least 1 mm has been proposed [178].780 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids

Monomers for dewatering.
The porosity value is used for determining a brittleness index by implementing
the sonic-derived porosity theory and a dipole sonic log from an offset well.
A new parameter has introduced in this work to give a quantitative value to
microscopic observations related to natural-fracture features in drill cuttings. This
parameter is called frac value and in conjunction with the brittleness index and
permeability constitutes the main result of the methodology: the cut log [178].
The quantitative data extracted from the drill cuttings are useful for a three,
dimensional multistage hydraulic fracturing simulation of horizontal wells. This
provides additional information to stimulation designers for deciding where to
initiate hydraulic fractures and how to optimize fracture spacing and fracture size per
stage instead of considering a homogeneous reservoir volume throughout the whole
lateral section. It has been also concluded that the proposed method provides a useful
tool for the evaluation of direct sources of information that are available in many
cases (from the drill cuttings) but are rarely evaluated quantitatively. The method
allows an improved design of multistage hydraulic fracturing jobs in horizontal
wells [178].
17.9 PROPPING AGENTS
The material first used for proppant in hydraulic fracturing of wells was silica sand.
As wells became deeper, sand was found to have inadequate strength. In deep wells,
stress of the earth causes the sand to crush and become much less effective in
increasing the production rate of a well.17.9 Propping agents 781
Synthetic proppant materials were developed to provide higher strength prop￾pants. The original synthetic sintered proppant was sintered bauxite. In later years, a
variety of ceramic raw materials have been used to make sintered ceramic proppants,
including bauxite containing lesser amounts of alumina and clay minerals, such as
kaolin. Generally, it has been found that the strength of ceramic particles increases
with the amount of alumina in the particle, all other factors remaining constant.
A general procedure for making synthetic proppant particles is to obtain the
ceramic raw material, grind it to a fine powder, form it into green pellets, and sinter
the green pellets in a kiln.
Then, a variety of processes for forming the pellets of a proppant have been
proposed.
A process for forming sintered ceramic pellets by adding dry powders of clay
and alumina, bauxite, or mixtures to a high intensity mixer has been described [179].
Powdered fine grain ceramic raw materials are stirred to form a dry homogenous
mixture. Then, sufficient water is added to cause agglomeration of the fine starting
dust particles to form small composite spherical pellets from the powder. Continued
mixing time is allowed in order to grow small pellets to the desired size. A broad
range of sizes can be produced during the pellet-forming stage.
For worthwhile oil or gas well stimulation, the best proppant and fluids have
to be combined with a good design plan and the right equipment. The selection
of a proppant is an important factor in determining how successful the stimulation
treatment can be. To select the best proppant for each well, a general understanding
of available proppants is imperative.
The propping agents should have high permeability at the respective formation
pressures, high resistance to compression, low density, and good resistance to acids.
Some propping agents are listed in Table 17.17.
Proppant materials for hydraulic fracturing have been developed [190].
The proppant particles can be formed by drip casting. Drip casting was originally
developed to produce nuclear fuel pellets. Later, it has been also used in the food and
pharmaceuticals industries. A slurry of finely divided ceramic particles is transported
through nozzles and formed into droplets under the influence of vibration.
In this way, uniform sized, smooth surface, spherical green particles are formed.
The green particles are dried and sintered to form the proppant [190].

Clay [187–189]782 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
The strength of a proppant can be measured by the proppant crush resistance test.
In this test a sample of proppant is first sieved to remove the fines, then placed in
a crush cell where a piston then used to apply a confined closure stress of some
magnitude above the failure point of some fraction of the proppant pellets. The
sample is then again sieved and the weight percent of fines generated as a result
of pellet failure is reported as percent crush.
The proppants are used in the process of hydraulic fracturing of wells [190].
17.9.1 SAND
Sand is the simplest proppant material. Sand is cheap, but at higher stresses it shows
a comparatively strong reduction in permeability.
17.9.2 CERAMIC PARTICLES
Fired ceramic spheroids have been described for use as a well proppant [191].
Each spheroid has a core made from raw materials comprising mineral particulates,
silicium carbide, and a binder. The mixture includes a mineral with chemically bound
water or sulfur, which blows the mixture during firing.
Therefore, the core has a number of closed air cells. Each spheroid has an
outer shell surrounding the core, comprising a metal oxide selected from aluminum
oxide and magnesium oxide. The fired ceramic spheroids have a density less than
2.2 g cm−3.
17.9.3 BAUXITE
Sintered bauxite spheres containing silica are standard proppant materials. The
particles have a size range from 0.02 to 0.3 μm. They are enhanced to resist
stress corrosion by inclusion of 2% zirconia in the mix before firing. A process
for manufacturing a material suitable for use as a proppant is characterized by the
following steps [192]:
A fine fraction is separated from a naturally occurring bauxite. The fine fraction is
an uncalcinated natural bauxite fraction composed largely of monomineralic particles
of gibbsite, boehmite, and kaolinite. The kaolinite represents no more than 25% of
the total. The separated fine fraction is pelletized in the presence of water. The pellets
produced are treated to remove water.
17.9.4 CORDIERITE
Cordierite is a magnesium iron aluminium cyclosilicate [193]. Typically it occurs
in contact or regional metamorphism of argillaceous rocks. A proppant containing
cordierite has been described, as well how to use this proppant [194].
A cordierite having an α-cordierite phase that is greater than the β-cordierite
phase present in the cordierite has been described. The α-cordierite phase can exist in17.9 Propping agents 783
a hexagonal crystal structure and the β-cordierite phase can exist in an orthorhombic
crystal structure.
During the transition from the α-phase into the β-phase, a volume expansion
occurs, which may induce strain fields with the ceramic system, thus improving
the mechanical properties of the ceramic. The transformation from the α-phase
into the β-phase occurs spontaneously during cooling of the ceramic material from
elevated temperatures. By adding various dopants to the cordierite, the spontaneous
transformation can be suppressed, thus leading to increased concentrations of the
α-phase in the cordierite material [194].
17.9.5 LIGHT-WEIGHT PROPPANTS
Light-weight propping agents have a specific gravity of less than 2.60 g cm−3. They
are made from kaolin clay and eventually with a light-weight aggregate. Special
conditions of calcination are necessary [195–198].
The alumina content is between 25% and 40% [199]. A high-strength proppant
has been described [200] with a specific gravity of less than 1.3 g cm−3.
17.9.6 POROUS PACK WITH FIBERS
It is possible to build within the formation a porous pack that is a mixture of fibers
and the proppant. The fibrous material may be any suitable material, such as natural
or synthetic organic fibers, glass fibers, ceramic fibers, and carbon fibers.
A porous pack filters out unwanted particles, proppant, and fines, while still al￾lowing production of oil. Using fibers to make a porous pack of fibers and a proppant
within the formation reduces the energy consumption of equipment. Pumping the
fibers together with the proppant provides significant reductions in the frictional
forces that otherwise limit the pumping of fluids containing a proppant [201].
17.9.7 COATED PROPPANTS
Typically, particulates, such as graded sand, suspended in a portion of the fracturing
fluid are then deposited in the fractures when the fracturing fluid is converted to a thin
fluid to be returned to the surface. These particulate solids, or proppant particulates,
serve to prevent the fractures from fully closing, so that conductive channels are
formed through which produced hydrocarbons can flow [202].
To prevent the subsequent flowback of proppant and other particulates with the
produced fluids, of the proppant may be coated with a curable resin or tackifying
agent that may facilitate the consolidation of the proppant particles in the fracture.
The partially closed fractures apply pressure to the coated proppant particulates
whereby the particulates are forced into contact with each other while the resin or
tackifying agent enhances the grain-to-grain contact between individual proppant
particles.784 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
The action of the pressure with the tackifying agent ensures the consolidation of
the proppant particles into a permeable mass having compressive and tensile strength,
while allowing small amounts of deformation at the surface of the proppant packs to
reduce the effects of point loading or to reduce proppant crushing [202].
An epoxy resin composition typically includes an oligomeric bisphenol-A
epichlorohydrin resin, a 4,4
-diaminodiphenyl sulfone curing agent, a solvent, a
silane coupling agent, and a surfactant [203].
In a series of experiments, three different types of proppant particulates were
assessed using a two-component high temperature epoxy resin system [202]. In each
experiment, the resin was used in amounts of 3%. The proppant particulate types
included bauxite, an intermediate strength proppant, and a light-weight proppant.
These proppants are known to withstand pressures from 40 MPa to 80 MPa without
substantial crushing. The test temperature was 120 ◦C for all tests [202].
The stress was continuously increased over a period of several days from 14 MPa
to 80 MPa. Uncoated proppant particulates were also tested. The effects of the closure
stresses and flow rates on resin-treated proppant were evaluated with an API linear
conductivity cell.
The conductivity and permeability of each proppant pack was continuously
monitored at 14 MPa (2000 psi) and 120 ◦C (250 ◦F) for at least of 25-30 h.
For all the three proppants, there was a significant increase in fracture conduc￾tivity and proppant pack permeability for the coated proppants in comparison to the
uncoated proppants. The improvement in fracture conductivity and proppant pack
permeability was pronounced under lower stress conditions. With coated proppants,
there was an evidence that a much more stable interface was created between the
proppant and the formation material.
The propping particles can be individually coated with a curable thermoset
coating. The coating enhances the chemical resistance of the proppants.
This modification is necessary if a proppant is not stable against the additives
in the fracturing fluid, such as an acid gel breaker. Resole-type phenolic resins are
recommended as coating materials in the presence of oxidative gel breakers [204].
Polymer coatings for propping agents are listed in Table 17.18.
Another advantage of a coating is the reduction of friction of the proppant
particles. In this case, coating materials with low friction coefficients are included
into the mixture of the coating [215]. Such materials are summarized in Table 17.19.
Of course not all of the materials listed in Table 17.19 are reasonable from the view of
economics. Multiple coating of particulate material results in a final coated product
that has a smooth, uniform surface.
Zeta potential modifiers
Coating compositions have been developed that are modifying the particle aggrega￾tion propensities and that these coated particles are ideally suited as proppants [216].
Namely, the particles have altered zeta potentials that change the charge on the
particles causing them to attract and agglomerate. The change in the zeta potential
or aggregation propensity causes each particle to have an increased frictional drag17.9 Propping agents 785

decreasing fines migrating into a fracture pack or to decrease the adverse impact of
fines migration into a fractured pack.
The compositions contain an amine and a phosphate ester. The composition
modifies the surfaces of the solid materials thus altering the chemical and physical
properties of the surfaces. The altered properties permit the surfaces to become786 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids

17.9.8 ANTISETTLING ADDITIVES
Proppant transport inside a hydraulic fracture has two components, when the fracture
is being generated. The horizontal component is dictated by the fluid velocity and by
the associated streamlines which help to carry the proppant to the tip of the fracture.
The vertical component is dictated by the terminal particle settling velocity of the
particle and is a function of proppant diameter and density as well as fluid viscosity
and density [10].
By infusing an additive that has a lower density than the fluid medium, the density
gradients inside the fracture can be varied. The upward movement of the low density
additive will interfere with the downward movement of high-density proppant and
vice versa.
This mutual interference between the proppants and the additive confined in the
narrow fracture will significantly hinder the settling of the high-density proppant. By
this principle, the times of settling of the proppant can be controlled.
The low-density material should have a particle-size distribution similar to that
of standard proppant. In addition to be a buoyant, the material may also act as a
proppant. Examples of such materials are poly(lactic acid) particles or glass beads.
The influence of such a low density additive on the time of settling is summarized in
Table 17.21.17.9 Propping agents 787

The tests were conduced in a 15 lb Mgal−1 (1.8 g m−3) guar-based linear gel. The
apparent viscosity of the gel was 8 cP at 511 s−1. The linear gels for testing contained
a proppant concentration of 240 kg m−3 with a diameter of 30/50 mesh.
17.9.9 PROPPANT DIAGENESIS
A number of mechanisms have been identified that can degrade the fracture
conductivity, including [217]:
• mechanical failure of the proppant grains,
• liberation of formation fines,
• proppant embedment,
• formation spalling,
• formation damage from the fracturing fluid,
• stress cycling,
• asphaltene deposition, and
• proppant dissolution.
These factors can reduce the effective conductivity by orders of magnitude as
compared with the typically published conductivity data measured under reference
conditions.
Another mechanism for degradation of proppant over time has been postulated.
This mechanism is labelled diagenesis and refers to a dissolution and reprecipitation
process that may reduce the porosity, permeability, and the strength of the proppant
pack as the precipitants are deposited [217]. The Factors that are believed to control
the occurrence and degree of labelled diagenesis include [217]:
• closure stress,
• reservoir temperature,
• proppant type, and
• mineralogy of the rock formation.
Results from high-temperature static tests, extended-duration flow tests at reser￾voir conditions, detailed analyzes of precipitates, the effects of the environment on
the mechanical properties of proppants, chemical and mineralogical analysis of vari￾ous reservoir shales, and the evaluation of proppants have been summarized [217].788 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
It has been demonstrated that crystalline precipitates can be formed on the
surface of all the proppant types investigated, including ceramic, sand, resin-coated
materials, and even inert steel balls or glass rods.
The nature of these precipitants suggest that they may be classified as zeolites.
Zeolites can be formed without the presence of alumina-bearing proppant and
appear to be largely dependent on the characteristics of the formation material and
fluid. Conductivity tests under simulated reservoir conditions with actual reservoir
shale core samples indicate that if diagenetic precipitation does occur it does not
appreciably affect the conductivity performance under the flow conditions [217].
17.9.10 PROPPANT FLOWBACK
The flowback of a proppant following fracture stimulation treatment is a major
concern because of the damage to equipment and loss in well production. The
mechanisms of flowback and the methods to control flowback have been discussed in
the literature [218]. To reduce proppant flowback, a curable resin-coated proppant can
be applied [219]. The agent must be placed across the producing interval to prevent
or reduce the proppant flowback.
Thermoplastic films
Thermoplastic film [218,220] materials have been developed to reduce the proppant
flowback that can occur after fracturing treatments. A heat-shrinkable film cut into
thin slivers provides flowback reduction over broad temperature ranges and closure
stress ranges and was found to cause little impairment to fracture conductivity with
some dependency on use concentration, temperature, and closure stress.
Adhesive-coated material
The addition of an adhesive-coated material to proppants decreases the flowback
of the particulates [221]. Such adhesive-coated materials can be inorganic or
organic fibers. The adhesive-coated material interacts mechanically with the proppant
particles to prevent the flowback of particulates to the wellbore.
The consolidation of a proppant also may occur via a poly(urethane) coating,
which will slowly polymerize after the fracturing treatment because of a polyaddition
process [222].
Magnetized material
A magnetized material in the form of beads, fibers, strips, or particles can be placed
with a proppant. The magnetized material moves to voids or channels located within
the proppant bed and forms clusters, which are held together by magnetic attraction
in the voids or channels, which in turn facilitate the formation of permeable proppant
bridges therein.
The magnetized material-proppant bridges retard and ultimately prevent the
flowback of proppant and formation solids, but still allow production of oil and gas
through the fracture at sufficiently high rates [223]. In a similar way, fibrous bundles
placed with the proppant may act in a fracture as a flowback preventer [224].17.10 Acid fracturing 789
17.10 ACID FRACTURING
A widely used stimulation technique is acidizing, in which a treatment fluid including
an aqueous acid solution is introduced into the formation to dissolve acid-soluble
materials that clog or constrict formation channels [225]. In this way, hydrocarbon
fluids can more easily flow from the formation into the well. In addition, an acid
treatment can facilitate the flow of injected treatment fluids from the well into the
formation.
A difference exists between acid fracturing and matrix acidizing.
In matrix acidizing, the acidizing fluid is injected from the well into the formation
at a rate and pressure below the pressure sufficient to create a fracture in the formation
[225]. The acid permeates into channels and dissolves materials that clog or constrict
the channels, thereby increasing permeability of the formation. Thus, an increase
in permeability is affected primarily by the reaction of the acid within the formation,
and little or no permeability increase is due to induced fractures within the formation.
In acid fracturing, an increase in permeability is affected by fractures as well as
by the acid etching through the channels within the formation. The acidic fracturing
fluid is injected into the well that is disposed within the formation to be fractured.
Sufficient pressure is applied to the acidizing treatment fluid to cause production of
one or more fractures in the formation.
Acid fracturing is used for low-permeability, acid-soluble rocks. Matrix acidizing
is a technique used for high-permeability reservoirs. Candidates for acid fracturing
are formations such as limestones (CaCO3) or dolomites (CaCO3 × MgCO3).
These materials react easily with hydrochloric acid to form chlorides and carbon
dioxide. In comparison with the fracturing technique with proppants, acid fracturing
has the advantage that no problem with proppant clean-out will appear. The acid
etches the fracture faces unevenly, which on closure retain a highly conductive
channel for the reservoir fluid to flow into the wellbore [226].
On the other hand, the length of the fracture is shorter, because the acid reacts
with the formation and therefore is spent. If traces of fluoride are in the hydrochloric
acid, then insoluble calcium fluoride is precipitated out. Therefore plugging by the
precipitate can jeopardize the desired effect of stimulation.
17.10.1 ENCAPSULATED ACIDS
Acids, in particular, and etching agents, in general, may be mixed with a gelling agent
and encapsulated with oils and polymers [227,228].
17.10.2 IN SITU FORMATION OF ACIDS
While acid fracturing is usually applicable for carbonate formations, acid fracturing
in sandstone formations has been not a common practice due to the low rock
solubility of mud acid. Methods and compositions that are useful in effectively acid790 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
fracturing of sandstone formations have been developed. Such a method of acid
fracturing consists of [229]:
1. injecting into the formation an acid fracturing fluid at a pressure sufficient to
form fractures within the formation, the acid fracturing fluid comprising a
sulfonate ester, a fluoride salt, a proppant, and water, the sulfonate ester being
hydrolyzed to produce sulfonic acid and
2. producing hydrofluoric acid in situ in the formation by reacting the sulfonic acid
with the fluoride salt subsequent to injection of the acid fracturing fluid into the
formation.
Generating hydrofluoric acid in situ makes it possible to perform acid fracturing
of sandstone formations with the assistance of partial monolayers of effectively
placed propping agents and to create enlarged propped fractures. Increased fracture
width will lead to higher fracture conductivity and enhanced hydrocarbon production
than what is generally achieved from a conventional propped fracturing treatment.
17.10.3 FLUID LOSS
Fluid loss limits the effectiveness of acid fracturing treatments. Therefore, formu￾lations to control fluid loss have been developed and characterized [230,231]. It
was discovered that viscosifying the acid showed a remarkable improvement in acid
fluid loss control. The enhancement was most pronounced in very low-permeability
limestone cores. The nature of the viscosifying agent also influenced the success.
Polymeric materials were more effective than surfactant type viscosifiers [232].
A viscosity controlled acid contains gels that break back to the original viscosity
1 day after being pumped. These acids have been used both for matrix acidizing
and for fracture acidizing to obtain longer fractures. The pH of the fluid controls
the gel formation and breaking. The gels are limited to formation temperatures of
50-135 ◦C [233].
17.10.4 GEL BREAKER FOR ACID FRACTURING
A particulate gel breaker for acid fracturing for gels crosslinked with titanium
or zirconium compounds is composed of complexing materials such as fluoride,
phosphate, sulfate anions, and multicarboxylated compounds. The particles are
coated with a water-insoluble resin coating, which reduces the rate of release of
the breaker materials of the particles so that the viscosity of the gel is reduced at
a retarded rate [134].
17.10.5 VISCOELASTIC DIVERTING ACIDS
Viscoelastic surfactant-acid systems have been developed. In particular, viscoelastic
diverting acids have been used in many formation treatments. Viscoelastic diverting
acids do not have much viscosity before the acid is spent, however, and thus may not17.10 Acid fracturing 791
be used as a gel system for fracturing. Alternatively, a polymer pad may be used in
some viscoelastic diverting acid treatments. The use of a polymer pad may defeat the
benefit of the viscoelastic diverting acid, however, because it is no longer a polymer￾free system.
A gelled acid system that utilizes viscoelastic surfactants would be of great benefit
in the treating of subterranean formations in oil and gas production, particularly for
use in acid fracturing.
It has been found that certain viscoelastic surfactant systems can be prepared that
provide a highly viscous fluid, or gelled viscosity at a high acid concentration, such
that they are useful in applications that call for a gelled acid, such as in acid fractur￾ing, for treating subterranean formations. Such systems may include little if any poly￾mers that are often used in gelled fluids that could otherwise damage the formation.
The viscoelastic surfactant systems make use of zwitterionic viscoelastic sur￾factants. Zwitterionic surfactants are surfactants that can carry a zero net charge
so that surfactant molecule is essentially neutral. Particularly useful zwitterionic
surfactants may include betaine surfactants, such as oleyl amidopropyl betaine or
erucyl amidopropyl betaine.
The acid used with the treatment fluids is typically a mineral acid or Lewis acid.
For most applications, hydrochloric acid is used for the treatment fluid. Other acids
that may be used may include sulfuric acid, or nitric acid. Also, certain organic acids,
such as methane sulfonic acid may be used.
The acids may also contain formation dissolving materials to facilitate the
dissolution of the formation materials. Examples of suitable chelating agents include
ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), nitrilo triacetic acid (NTA), hydroxyethyl
ethylene diamine triacetic acid (HEDTA), and others.
Rheology enhancers can be selected from polyvinyl esters, polyvinylacetates,
polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohols and aromatic sulfonates [234]. Also, the use
of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) as a rheology enhancer has been
described [235]. Still other suitable rheology enhancers include certain chelating
agents such as trisodium hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine triacetate.
In acid fracturing, because flow channels are created by dissolving the formation
materials of the fractured materials, proppant materials that are typically used in
hydraulic fracturing may not be used. In certain cases, however, proppant materials
may be incorporated and used in the acid fracturing treatment. The initial high
viscosity of the acid treatment fluid facilitates the suspension and carrying of
proppant materials. This ability will improve the stimulation of formations that
contain a smaller portion of acid soluble material where acid etching alone may not
provide an adequate flow path for produced fluids [236].
Proppant materials include ceramic, glass, sand, bauxite, aluminum oxide, zir￾conium oxide, silicon dioxide, bauxite, acrylic resins, phenolic resins, polyurethane
elastomers, amino resins, polyester resins [237].
Fibers or other non-proppant particulate materials may also be included in the
acid treatment fluids. These may be used to plug natural fractures so that the treatment
fluid will be directed to other areas [236].792 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
17.11 MATRIX ACIDIZING
Matrix acidizing is used in carbonate formations to create wormholes that connect the
formation to the wellbore. Hydrochloric acid and organic acids, or mixtures thereof
are typically used in matrix acidizing treatments of carbonate reservoirs.
However, the use of these acids in deep wells has some major drawbacks,
including high and uncontrolled reaction rates and corrosion to well tubulars,
especially those made of chromium-based tubulars [238]. These problems may
become severe at high temperatures. To overcome the problems associated with
strong acids, chelating agents have been introduced and used in the field. However,
the major concerns with most of these chemicals are their limited dissolving power
and their negative environmental impact.
l-Glutamic acid N,N-diacetic acid (GLDA) is a newly developed environmentally
friendly chelate. This compound was examined as a replacement for acid treatments
in deep oil and gas wells.
The solubility of calcium carbonate with this chelate was measured over a
wide range of parameters [238]. Coreflood tests were conducted using long Indiana
limestone cores.
GLDA has a very good ability to dissolve Ca from carbonate rocks over a wide
pH range by a combination of acid dissolution and chelation. The addition of 5 wt%
sodium chloride did not affect the GLDA performance at a pH of 13, but significantly
accelerated the reaction at a pH of 1.7. In comparison to other chelating agents,
GLDA dissolved more Ca than ethanoldiglycinic acid, but less than hydroxyethyl
ethylene diamine triacetic acid (HEDTA) at high pH values. GLDA of pH of 1.7
is able to form wormholes at rates of 2 and 3 cm3min−1. GLDA was found to be
thermally stable at temperatures up to 175 ◦C [238,239].
From an environmental standpoint, GLDA is readily biodegradable and is made
from a renewable raw material, monosodium glutamate. GLDA has low toxicity and
aquatic toxicity characteristics. As a replacement for HCl, GLDA is significantly
safer and less corrosive [240].
17.11.1 FINES MIGRATION IN CARBONATE ROCK
During acidizing, the microstructure of carbonate rocks experiences substantial
changes under reactive processes, in particular chemical dissolution and deposition,
including dissolution-released-fines migration [241]. A better understanding of such
changes at the pore scale and their influences on rock properties is of great value for
the effective design and implementation of reactive processes in carbonate reservoirs.
X-ray microcomputed tomography has been used to quantitatively investigate the
local porosity changes in a meso- and microporous carbonate core samples during
chemical dissolution [241]. A reactive flooding experiment in a core sample by a
nonacidic solution is designed such that changes in pore space from before to after
the reactant injection could be imaged in exactly the same locations with X-ray
microcomputed tomography with a resolution of less than 5 μm.17.12 Matrix stimulation 793
This technique allows the incorporation of microporosity into the calculation of
the evolution regions, including the migration of fines, to accurately quantify the
evolution scenarios. 3D pore networks can derived from the image data, which
quantify changes in network structure and the pore geometry. Thus, it can be
explained why the permeability of the sample initially decreases and then increases
when the injection time increases [241].
17.11.2 REACTION OF IN SITU GELLED ACIDS WITH CALCITE
In situ gelled acids have been used extensively in matrix acidizing and acid fracturing
for acid diversion and reducing the leak-off rate, respectively. A few studies
investigated the rate of dissolution of calcite in polymer-based acids, yet none has
addressed in detail the in situ gelled acids.
The mass transfer and the kinetics of the reaction of 5% HCl in situ gelled acids
with calcite and determine the effect of Fe-crosslinking agents on the rate of calcite
dissolution has been examined [242].
The rate of reaction of 5% HCl in situ gelled acid was measured using the
rotating-disk apparatus. Rock samples of 1.5 in diameter and 1 in length were
used. The effect of temperature (38-120 ◦C) and disk rotational speed (100-1800
rev.min−1) was investigated using Pink Desert limestone rock samples. The calcium
concentration was measured in the collected samples and was used to determine the
acid-reaction rate [242].
The results indicated that the rate of calcite dissolution at 65 ◦C was controlled
mainly by the rate of mass transfer of the acid to the surface up to a disk rotational
speed of 1000 rev.min−1 and by the rate of the surface reaction above this value. On
the basis of the results obtained, the diffusion coefficient of 5% HCl in in situ gelled
acid at 65 ◦C, the activation energy, and the reaction rate constant at 65 ◦C, 93 ◦C,
and 120 ◦C were determined.
A power law kinetic model was used to determine the kinetics parameters. The
presence of Fe3+-crosslinking agent had a significant effect on the rate of dissolution
in comparison with reactions with gelled acid with no crosslinking agent under the
same conditions. The reaction rate decreased by a factor of 2.2 and by a factor of 1.4
when the reaction was conducted at 100 rev min−1 and 1500 rev min−1, respectively.
A gel layer, formed on the surface, acted as a barrier between the acid and the rock,
which reduced the rate of calcite dissolution [242].
17.12 MATRIX STIMULATION
The purpose of matrix stimulation in carbonate reservoirs is to bypass damaged areas
and increase the effective wellbore area. This can be achieved by creating highly
conductive flow channels known as wormholes. A further injection of the acid will
follow a wormhole path where the permeability has increased significantly, leaving
substantial intervals untreated. This problem can be more significant as the contrast
in permeability increases within the target zones.794 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
Diverting materials, such as viscoelastic-surfactants (VES)-based acids, play an
important role in mitigating this problem. The acid-injection rate was found to be
a critical parameter to maximize the efficiency of the use of VES-based acids as a
diverting chemical in addition to creating wormholes. It was found that the maximum
apparent viscosity, which developed during VES-based acids injection, occurred over
a narrow window of acid-injection rates [243,244].
Higher injection rates were not effective in enhancing the acidizing process, and
the use of diverting material became similar in effect to that of regular acids. The
use of VES-based acid was also found to be constrained by the scale of the initial
permeability ratio. For initial permeability ratios greater than approximately 10, the
diversion was insufficient. The results were obtained by conducting a large set of
acidizing experiments by use of 20 in long cores.
Both single- and parallel-coreflood experiments were performed in a study [243,
244]. Carbonate cores were used with initial permeabilities of 4-150 mD, and the flow
rate was varied from 1.5 to 50 cm3min1. The initial ratio of permeability between
the two cores ranged from 2 to 15. To characterize the wormholes, computerized
tomography (CT) was used to generate a 3D view of the wormholes in each core.
By use of the results obtained from single cores, the acid-injection rate was found to
be a critical parameter in maximizing the efficiency of the use of VES as a diverting
agent during matrix acidizing treatments. Higher injection rates were not effective in
enhancing the acidizing process, and the use of diverting material produced results
similar to those of regular hydrochloric acid (HCl). Parallel-coreflood experiments
indicated that the use was found to be constrained by the scale of the initial
permeability ratio. For initial permeability ratios greater than approximately 10,
diversion was insufficient in 20-in. coreflood tests. For permeability ratios greater
than 10, the acid-placement treatment needs to be designed more carefully [243,244].
17.13 SPECIAL PROBLEMS
17.13.1 CORROSION INHIBITORS
Water-soluble 1,2-dithiol-3-thiones for fracturing fluids and other workover fluids
have been described as corrosion inhibitors for aqueous environments [245]. These
compounds are prepared by reacting a PEO that is capped with isopropylphenol with
elemental sulfur.
The compounds perform better in aqueous systems than their nonoxylated
analogs. The concentration range is usually in the 10-500 ppm range, based on the
weight of the water in the system.
17.13.2 THE PROBLEM OF IRON CONTROL IN FRACTURING
Results from laboratory tests and field jobs show that iron presents a significant
and complex problem in stimulation operations [246]. The problem presented by an17.13 Special problems 795
acidizing fluid differs from that presented by a nonacidic or weakly acidic fracturing
fluid. In general, acid dissolves iron compounds from the equipment and the flow
lines as it is mixed and pumped into the formation.
The acid may dissolve additional iron as it reacts with the formation. If the fluid
does not contain an effective iron control system, the dissolved iron could precipitate.
This precipitate may then accumulate as it is carried toward the wellbore during
flowback. This accumulation of solids may decrease the natural and the created
permeability and can have a detrimental effect on the recovery of the treating fluid
and production.
Iron can be controlled with certain complexing agents, in particular glucono-δ￾lactone, citric acid, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, nitrilo triacetic acid, hydrox￾yethyl ethylene diaminetriacetic acid, hydroxyethyliminodiacetic acid, and the salts
from the those compounds. These compounds must be added together with nitrogen
containing compounds such as hydroxylamine salts or hydrazine salts [247–249].
These complexing agents are shown in Figure 17.32.
In general, chelating agents possess some unique chemical characteristics. The
most significant attribute of these chemicals is the high solubility of the free acids
in aqueous solutions. Linear coreflood tests were used to study the formation of
wormholes.

Both hydroxyethyl ethylene diaminetriacetic acid and hydroxyethyliminodiacetic
acid produced wormholes in limestone cores when tested at 65 ◦C (150 ◦F). However,
the efficiency and capacities differ. Because these chemicals have high solubility in
the acidic pH range, it was possible to test acidic formulations with pH of less than
3.5 [250].
To control the iron in an aqueous fracturing fluid having a pH below 7.5, a
thioalkyl acid may be added [251]. This is a reducing agent for the ferric ion, contrary
to the complexants described in the previous paragraph.
17.13.3 ENHANCED TEMPERATURE STABILITY
During the initial fracturing process, a degradation, which results in a decrease of
viscosity, is undesirable. The polymer in fracturing fluids will degrade at elevated
temperatures.
One method to prevent degradation too early is to cool down the formation with
large volumes of pad solution before the fracturing job. Furthermore, the temperature
stability of the fracturing fluid is extended through the addition of quantities
of unhydrated, particulate guar or guar-derivative polymers before pumping the
fracturing fluid into the formation [252]. Finally, adjustment of the pH to moderate
alkaline conditions can improve the stability.
The preferred crosslinkers for high-temperature applications are zirconium com￾pounds. A formulation for a high-temperature guar-based fracturing fluid is given in
Table 17.22. The fracturing fluid exhibits good viscosity and is stable at moderate to
high temperatures, that is, 80-120 ◦C.
17.13.4 CHEMICAL BLOWING
The efficiency of a fracturing fluid produced back from a formation can be increased
by adding blowing agents [254,255]. After placing the blowing agent, for example,
agglomerated particles and granules containing the blowing agent of dinitrosopenta
methylenetetramine, sodium hydrogen carbonate and p-toluene sulfonyl hydrazide,
azodicarbonamide, and p,p-oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide) and fracturing the
formation, the blowing agent decomposes. Thereby the filter cake becomes more
porous or provides a driving force for the removal of fluid load from the matrix.
Increased porosity enhances the communication between the formation and the
fracture, thus increasing the efficiency of the production of the fracturing fluid.

A frost-resistant formulation is given in Table 17.23. The composition has a frost
resistance down to −35 to −45 ◦C [256].
17.13.6 FORMATION DAMAGE IN GAS WELLS
Studies [257] on formation damage using artificially fractured, low permeability
sandstone cores indicated that viscosified fracturing fluids can severely restrict the
gas flow through narrow fractures. Poly(saccharide) polymers such as hydroxypropyl
guar, HEC, and xanthan gum caused a significant reduction of the gas flow through
the cracked cores, up to 95%.
In contrast, PAM gels caused little or no reduction in the gas flow through cracked
cores after a liquid cleanup. Other components of fracturing fluids, such as surfactants
and breakers caused less damage to gas flows.
17.14 CHARACTERIZATION OF FRACTURING FLUIDS
Historically, viscosity measurements have been the single most important method to
characterize fluids in petroleum-producing applications. Whereas the ability to mea￾sure a fluid’s resistance to flow has been available in the laboratory for a long time, a
need to measure the fluid properties at the well site has prompted the development of
more portable and less sophisticated viscosity-measuring devices [258].
These instruments must be durable and simple enough to be used by persons with
a wide range of technical skills. As a result, the Marsh funnel and the Fann concentric798 CHAPTER 17 Fracturing fluids
cylinder, both variable-speed viscometers, have found wide use. In some instances,
the Brookfield viscometer has also been used.
However, it has been established that an intense control of certain variables may
improve the execution of a hydraulic fracturing job and the success of a stimulation.
Therefore, an intense quality control is recommended [259,260]. Such a program
includes monitoring the breaker performance at low temperatures and measuring
the sensitivity of fracturing fluids to variations in crosslinker loading, temperature
stabilizers, and other additives at higher temperatures.
17.14.1 RHEOLOGIC CHARACTERIZATION
To design a successful hydraulic fracturing treatment employing crosslinked gels,
accurate measurements of rheologic properties of these fluids are required. Rheologic
characterization of borate crosslinked gels turned out to be difficult with a rotational
viscometer. In a laboratory apparatus, field pumping conditions (i.e., crosslinking the
fluid on the fly) and fluid flow down tubing or casing and in the fracture could be
simulated [261]. The effects of the pH and temperature of the fluid and the type and
concentration of the gelling agent on the rheologic properties of fluids have been
measured.
These parameters have significant effect on the final viscosity of the gel in
the fracture. Correlations to estimate friction pressures in field size tubulars have
been developed from laboratory test data. In conjunction with field calibrations,
these correlations can aid in accurate prediction of the friction pressure of borate
crosslinked fluids.
17.14.2 ZIRCONIUM-BASED CROSSLINKING AGENT
The concentration of a crosslinking agent containing zirconium in a gel is determined
by first adding an acid to break the gel and converting the zirconium into the ionic
noncomplexed form [262]. This is followed by the addition of Arsenazo (III) to
produce a colored complex, which can be determined with standard colorimetric
methods. Arsenic compounds are highly toxic. The colorimetric reagent to measure
zirconium in gels is shown in Figure 17.33.
17.14.3 OXIDATIVE GEL BREAKER
The concentration of an oxidative gel breaker can be measured by colorimetric
methods, by periodically or continuously sampling the gel [263]. The colorimetric
reagent is sensitive to oxidizing agents. It contains iron ions and thiocyanate. Thus
the quantity of breaker added to the fracturing fluid can be controlled. The method is
based on the oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric ions
Fe2+ → Fe3+ + e−,
which form a deep red complex with thiocyanate.References 799

17.14.4 SIZE EXCLUSION CHROMATOGRAPHY
Size exclusion chromatography [264,265] has been used to monitor the degradation
of the thickeners initiated by various oxidative and enzymatic breakers.
17.14.5 ASSESSMENT OF PROPPANTS
There are standardized methods for the characterization of the effect of prop￾pants [266,267]. The general methods of assessment have been exemplified [268].
For some proppants, the experiments reveal relationships between the long-term
fracture conductivity and the closure pressure as a polynomial [268]
F = A1 + A2P + A3P2 + A4P3, (17.2)
where F is the long-term fracture conductivity, P is the closure pressure, and Ai are
some constants. Similarly, an exponential relationship between fracture conductivity
F and time t has be obtained for a certain closure pressure [268],
F = exp(−A5t) + A6. (17.3)

18 Water shutoff
This chapter is closely related to the subject of gelling agents, refer to Chapter 8, p.
393, for more information. The action of both gelling and plugging agents have a
similar performance: to minimize the permeability of a formation.
The idea of water shutoff treatments raised already in 1922 when the injection of
silicate solutions into oil-producing wells with the aim at gelation in situ to form a
blocking phase was patented.
The term gel is not unique. It refers sometimes to a crosslinked polymer. But on
the other hand it means sometimes that a polymer solution is sufficiently viscous to
be an apparent gel. Although from the view of a polymer chemist, the hardening of
cement is a polymerization resulting in an inorganic crosslinked polymer, we will
not include cementing here. Further fracturing fluids will not be included, even when
gels are formed during the fracturing job. Fracturing fluids have still other more
complicated issues.
The use of polymer systems in the last decade has been reviewed [1]. Field￾application data for various polymer systems have been summarized over the range
of 40-150 ◦C. The applications cover a wide range of permeabilities from 20 to 2720
mD in sandstone and carbonate reservoirs around the globe. The review revealed that
the last decade of developments can be categorized into two major types. The first
type is polymer gels for total water shutoff in the near-wellbore region, in which
a polymer is crosslinked with either an organic or an inorganic crosslinker. The
second type is concerned with deep treatment of water-injection wells diverting fluids
away from high-permeability zones (thief zones). These thief zones take most of the
injected water, which results in a large amount of unrecovered oil.
For the total-blocking gels, various systems have been identified, such as
poly(urethane) resins, chromium (Cr3+)-crosslinking terpolymers, Cr3+-crosslinking
foamed partially hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide), and nanoparticle polyelectrolyte
complexes sequestering Cr3+ for elongation of its gelation time with partially
hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide). In addition, poly(ethylenimine) was identified tas
crosslinking agent [1].
For the deep modification of water-injection profiles in water-injection wells,
two systems were identified: microspheres prepared from acrylamide monomers
crosslinked with N,poly(acrylamide)
-methylene bisacrylamide and microspheres

produced by crosslinking 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid with diacry￾lamides and methacrylamides of diamines [1].
18.1 CLASSIFICATION OF THE METHODS
The formation of plugs can be achieved by various chemical principles:
• polymerization of vinyl monomers,
• polyaddition of epoxies,
• polycondensation of aminoplasts and phenoplasts,
• crosslinking of polymers, and
• cementing.
There are different approaches to classify the methods. Because of the different
purposes that are favorably obtained in gelling technology, a series of different
technical terms are in use. Operations which include plugging or sealing jobs occur
are shown in Table 18.1, left column. This classification runs according to the
particular job. From the view of the molecular reactions that occur during such jobs
the various techniques, in a wider sense, can be classified as follows [2]: This is
shown in Table 18.1, right column.
Depending on the particular technique of oil recovery, often a multiple of water
is produced in relation to crude oil produced. The water content increases as the well
becomes more and more exhausted. The ratio of water produced to oil is on average
throughout the world ca. three at the moment [3]. Fifty five percent of the water is
reinjected, while the rest is discharged to open surface areas. Most discharged water
requires treatment because of contamination with traces of oil, heavy metals, boron,
and corrosive fluids like H2S, CO2, salt, and solids. The costs of treatment of water
during a life cycle are varying in between US $ 0.15m−3 to as much as US $ 15m−3
depending on the volumes and the location [4]. The typical process cost distributions
of the water life cycle cost are shown in Table 18.2.

18.2 IN SITU POLYMERIZATION
Vinyl monomers are used as such and are allowed to polymerize in place to form
a gel. This technique is used to enable a solution to gel slowly, even at high
temperatures. An aqueous solution of a vinyl monomer is mixed with a radical￾forming initiator and optionally with a dispersant. The initiator decomposes at
elevated temperatures and initiates the polymerization process. In this way, a gel
is formed in place. Radical polymerization is sensitive to molecular oxygen. For a
more pronounced delay, polymerization inhibitors may be added to the solution in
small amounts. The technique is used in the treatment of subterranean formations,
especially for plugging lost circulation in drilling operations, particularly at elevated
temperatures.
18.3 ACRYLIC GELS
As monomers, N-methylol acrylamide and N-methylol methacrylamide, c.f.,
Figure 18.1, have been suggested [5]. Inhibitors can be phenol derivatives [6], such
as an N-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine salt [7].
The use of poly(acrylamide) (PAM) gels in water shutoff treatments is common.
Water-soluble polymers in general are reviewed in the literature [8]. PAM is prepared
by radical polymerization of the monomer acrylamide (AAm). Charges along the
main chain can be introduced by suitable comonomers or on the fly by alkaline
treatment of the polymer.
In the latter case a part of the amide groups is hydrolyzed to carboxyl groups.
Suitable comonomers are acrylyic acid or methacrylic acid, N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone,

sodium-2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonate. A copolymer of AAm and tert￾butyl acrylate can be crosslinked with poly(ethyleneimine).
The kinetics of the gelation reactions has been investigated. It was found that
the addition of salts increases the time of gelation. As expected, a higher content of
copolymer and crosslinking agent reduces the time of gelation [9]. Recommendations
for field application of this gelling composition have been worked out.
Also a treatment of acrylic polymers with ionizing radiation has been reported
to improve the rheological properties and stability [10]. Quite a lot of other
nitrogen containing vinyl compounds that should withstand in hostile environments
have been disclosed [11–13]. These include N-acryloylmorpholine, N-acryloyl-N
-
methyl piperazine, and various other acryloyl units with pending organic salts,
c.f. Figure 18.2.
18.3.1 CROSSLINKERS
Crosslinkers are added to form intermolecular linkages in between the primary
polymer chains. In this way a stable gel is formed. There are various principles that
effect crosslinking.18.3 Acrylic gels 821
Physical crosslinking
Modified PAMs that are bearing negative charges on their backbone can form gels by
addition of multivalent positive ions, such as chromium salts. The gel consists of a
physical network, similarly to a ionomer. A single multivalent ion shares a salt to the
charges of different polymer chains. The gelation time depends on the molecular
weight of the primary polymer, the concentration of ions, both on the primary
polymer chains and the concentration of the multivalent cations in the solution.
Crosslinker formulations based on Iron(III), such as ferric acetylacetonate or
ammonium ferric oxalate [14] have been described. 2,4-Pentanedione acts to adjust
the gel strength in such formulations. Also zirconium acetylacetonate is a suitable
crosslinker [15]. Table 18.3 gives a list of salts proposed for physical crosslinking.
Even when chromium (III) salts, which are used mainly for physical crosslinking
are not as toxic as chromium(VI) salts, they are not environmentally desirable
compounds. For environmental reasons, the use of chromium salts may require
additional costs to avoid the contamination of surface waters. Therefore, efforts
to develop other methods of crosslinked have been undertaken, i.e., chemical
crosslinking. Table 18.4 lists the characteristic pH range for crosslinking for some
selected polymers [16].
Syneresis
At elevate temperatures, in aqueous solution, with time the hydrolysis of the amide
groups takes place. In saline environments usually bivalent ions such as Ca2+ are
present. The carboxyl groups formed from the polymer can react with the bivalent
ions and form thus additional crosslinks [17]. Thus, the number of crosslinks
increases with time, altering the mechanical properties of the gel. As the crosslinking
index of the gel increases, the equilibrium water content will decrease and the gel
will shrink. This phenomenon is addressed as syneresis. In this case the plugging
properties are being lost, at least partially.

Chemical crosslinking
Besides of physical crosslinking chemical crosslinking systems have been described.
A combination of hydroquinone and hexamethylenetetramine can be used [18].
Sodium bicarbonate in a concentration of 2% serves as buffer and it softens the water
by precipitating certain divalent cations present in the sea water.
Other chemical crosslinking systems include terephthalaldehyde, terephthalic
acid, dihydroxynaphthalene, glutaric acid, gallic acid and dibasic esters [19]. The
authors identified primary and secondary crosslinkers. Primary crosslinkers are those
that can produce gels with the polymer, although the gels may be unstable. Secondary
crosslinkers cannot gel as such. However, they stabilize the gels produced with
primary crosslinking.
Phenol-formaldehyde-type crosslinkers
The amide groups on PAM can be crosslinked with formaldehyde or a mixture
of formaldehyde and phenol. The disadvantages of using formaldehyde or similar
small molecules are their toxicity and issues of disposal. The larger reagents
such as hexanal and heptanal which are not classed as toxic would be suitable
crosslinking agents but are not sufficiently soluble in water to crosslink normal hy￾drophilic polymers such as the PAM/poly(acrylate) copolymer. However, these larger
crosslinking agents are readily solubilized in aqueous solutions by hydrophobically
modified PAM polymers and can then crosslink them [20]. Hexamethylenetetramine
hydrolyzes slowly into ammonia and formaldehyde. It can be more favorably used
in place of formaldehyde. Hexamethylenetetramine with an aminobenzoic acid
compound produces superior gels in comparison to those produced with phenol and
formaldehyde [21]. This gelling system is more environmentally acceptable than the
phenol-formaldehyde crosslinking system.
Poly(ethyleneimine) crosslinker
For copolymers of AAm and copolymers of AAm and methyl acrylate (5%),
poly(ethyleneimine) [22,23] can be used as crosslinker.18.4 Special applications 823
Aluminum phosphate ester salts for gelling organic liquids
Organic liquid gels are used for temporary plugging during fracturing operations.
This type of gelling agent permits on-the-fly gelling of hydrocarbons, especially
those used in hydraulic fracturing of subterranean formations to enhance oil and gas
production.
A gel of an organic liquid, such as diesel or crude oil, can be formed using
an aluminum phosphate diester in which all of the reagents are substantially free
of water and pH-affecting substances [24,25]. The diester may be prepared by the
reaction of a triester with phosphorous pentoxide to produce a poly(phosphate),
which is then reacted with an alcohol to produce a phosphate diester.
The latter diester is then added to the organic liquid along with a non-aqueous
source of aluminum, such as aluminum isopropoxide in diesel oil, to produce
the metal phosphate diester. The conditions in the two preceding reaction steps
are controlled to provide a gel with good viscosity versus temperature and time
characteristics. The gel is useful in fracturing subterranean formations by entraining
a solid particulate proppant therein and pumping the resultant mixture into the
subterranean rock formation at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation.
A similar process involves the reaction of triethyl phosphate and phosphorous
pentoxide to form a poly(phosphate) in an organic solvent [26]. Aluminum sulfate is
used as a crosslinker. Hexanol results in high-temperature viscosity of the gel, while
maintaining a pumpable viscosity at ambient temperatures [27].
18.4 SPECIAL APPLICATIONS
Chromium acetate-partially hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide) (PHPA) gel systems
have been applied also in fractured reservoirs for conformance control [28].
A wide variety of polymers is suitable for flexible gels [29]: poly(vinyl alcohol)
or poly(vinylacetate), PAMs, AAm copolymers, acrylic acid methacrylamide
copolymers, PHPAs, as well the poly(methacrylamide)s, several natural and modified
poly(saccharide)s, lignosulfonates, and poly(alkylene oxide)s.
The crosslinking of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) using Al3+ ions to form a
gel is described by Keller and Narh [30]. The concentration of the high molecular
weight hydrophilic polymers used to form hydrogels is typically in the range
3-10 g l−1. Also diverting agents can be added to improve the penetration of a sand
consolidating fluid into the areas of lower permeability when treating a zone with
heterogeneous permeability [31].
Shear-initiated inversion of emulsions
Some emulsions can be formulated to exhibit the so-called flow-initiated gelling.
Such liquids thicken when subjected to high shear stress or a pressure drop across
a sudden constriction in the flow path such as the nozzles of a drill bit. To effect
the flow-initiated gelling, the crosslinking agent and the polymer are dissolved in
two separate aqueous solutions, which are in the emulsion again separated by a824 CHAPTER 18 Water shutoff
continuous hydrophobic phase. Three types of emulsion systems have been described
for PAMs [32]:
1. a water in oil in water emulsion system,
2. a dual water in oil emulsion system, and
3. a crosslinker in oil system.
18.5 THERMALLY STABLE GELS
It has been found that crosslinked gels formed have often been ineffective at high
temperatures, i.e., at temperatures above about 80 ◦C because of the instability of
the crosslinker or the polymer. This has resulted in too rapid crosslinking rates,
crosslinker precipitation, polymer degradation, or in inefficient solution propagation.
In attempts to correct these problems, the crosslinking metal ion has been
coordinated with a ligand such as acetate or propionate to slow down the reaction
of the metal ion with the polymer. While this and other techniques have been utilized
successfully, the use of some metal ions, e.g., chromium, has adverse environmental
effects, and the metal ion used can be adsorbed by formation materials, whereby it is
prevented from functioning to crosslink the polymer [33].
An excellent review of thermally stable gels for fluid diversion in petroleum
production has been presented by Moradi-Araghi [17]. In general, to arrive at
thermally stable gels, a thermally stable polymer must be utilized. Polymers to
generate thermally stable gels are shown in Table 18.5.
18.6 BLOCKED ISOCYANATE GELS
A method of treating an earth formation that includes introducing a blocked
isocyanate in a liquid phase into the formation. An active hydrogen compound is

then introduced into the formation. The blocked isocyanate reacts with the active
hydrogen compound to form an elastomeric gel.
Low-molecular weight active hydrogen compounds and high-molecular weight
active hydrogen compounds are summarized in Table 18.6.
Blocked isocyanates are typically manufactured from hydrogen-containing com￾pounds such as phenol, ethyl acetoacetate and ε-caprolactam. Typical unblock
temperatures are 90-200 ◦C, depending on the isocyanate structure and the blocking
agent [34].
For example, aromatic isocyanates are typically unblocked at lower temperatures
than those required to unblock aliphatic isocyanates. The dissociation temperature
decreases according to the following order of blocking agents: alcohols, lactams,
phenols, oximes, and pyrazoles.
Products such as methylethylcetoxime, diethyl malonate, and 3,5-dimethylpy￾razole are typical blocking agents [34].
18.7 DISPROPORTIONATE PERMEABILITY REDUCTION
Many gels, but also certain polymers without crosslinkers can reduce the permeabil￾ity to water more than that to oil or gas [35, and references cited herein]. This effect
is addressed as selective permeability reduction or disproportionate permeability
reduction, respectively.
The use of water permeability modifying chemicals in hydrocarbon and water
producing formations to decrease the production of water is considerably less
expensive than other techniques, such as blocking the flow of water with crosslinked
polymers, and does not require expensive zonal isolation techniques. However,
the use of permeability modifying chemicals has often resulted in only small
reductions in water production or unacceptable levels of reduction in the production
of hydrocarbons [36].826 CHAPTER 18 Water shutoff
18.7.1 FIELD EXPERIENCE
Extensive experience with the chromic-acetate-carboxylate/AAm-polymer gel tech￾nology for use in oilfield conformance control, sweep improvement, and water and
gas shutoff treatments has been compiled by Sydansk [37].
Chromic triacetate is often the preferred crosslinking agent used in conjunction
with this polymer gel technology. Several other chromic salts cannot be used,
because the kinetics of crosslinking is too fast. In hight.emperature applications the
gelation kinetics can still slowed down, using complexed or chelated salts, or the
encapsulation techniques [14]. Chromic acetate gels have a robust gel chemistry
and are highly insensitive to petroleum reservoir environments and interferences.
They are applicable over a broad range of temperature and pH range. Until mid
1998 this procedure has been employed in over 1400 conformance control treatments
worldwide.
18.8 SILICATE-BASED AGENTS
The use of silicate-based agents has advantages and disadvantages as well [38]. The
advantages and disadvantages are summarized in Table 18.7.
Sealing compositions comprised of sodium silicate solutions are used success￾fully to control lost circulation and to terminate undesirable fluid production and
cross flows in subterranean zones.
When such a sodium silicate sealing composition is placed in a subterranean zone,
the sodium silicate solution is polymerized or crosslinked, whereby a pliable gel is
formed. This gel reduces or terminates either lost circulation or undesirable fluid

production or cross flows. The gelation occurs by change in the pH or by ions, such
as copper sulfate [39].
18.8.1 COMBINED POLYMER-SILICATE TECHNOLOGY
The joint application of both PHPA and sodium orthosilicate or potassium orthosil￾icate has been extensively discussed by Lakatos [40,41]. Typically such plugging
solution consists of a two stage treatment. First PHPA as anionogenic polymer is a
sodium orthosilicate is injected, then the second solution contains the cationogenic
polymer, such as poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride) and a multivalent metal
cation in acidic medium for silicate crosslinking. The joint application of polymer
and silicate reduces the demand of chemicals [42–44].
18.8.2 GEL-FOAM TECHNIQUE
The restriction of gas coning is based on the simultaneous placement of a
polymer/silicate gel at the gas oil contact and also a supporting foam pillow into
the oil-bearing layer. The basic elements of the concept are the following [45]:
An effective restriction of gas flow needs a permanent barrier between the gas and
oil-bearing zones. This task might be solved efficiently by gels. The barrier should
deeply penetrate, should be practically horizontal and should be located close to gas
oil contact.
The extension of a deeply penetrating horizontal barrier at the gas oil contact is
possible if a supporting foam pillow is simultaneously injected into the oil-bearing
layer. The supporting pillow must fulfill various requirements: it must prevent the
gravity segregation of the gel-forming aqueous phases, its advancing front velocity
should be similar as of the barrier and after the placement of all treating fluids the
supporting media must not restrict the flow of oil in the zone previously invaded.
Gel system
The most specific feature of the gel used is a double network of anionic polymers
crosslinked by a multivalent cation and polysilicates formed from sodium orthosil￾icate in slightly acidic media [38,45]. Accordingly, the gel can be prepared by
mixing of two aqueous solutions. One solution contains PHPA and silicate. The other
solution contains alum (KAl(SO4)2) and calcium chloride, and hydrochloric acid as
well. The acidic milieu prevents the spontaneous hydrolysis of alum and thus controls
the gelation of the silicates.
The solutions are preferentially injected sequentially into the reservoirs, but they
can be mixed at the surface too. The solutions form a multifunctional chemical
system because after mixing or dispersing the treating fluids both bulk phase
reactions and interfacial reactions take place, eventually leading to the gelation or
to a resistivity enhancement in porous media:
• crosslinking of polymers,828 CHAPTER 18 Water shutoff
• gelation of silicates,
• precipitation of polymers, silicates and metal hydroxides,
• adsorption of all chemicals on rock surface, and
• mechanical entrapment of the microgel and the hydroxides.
Foam system
A great variety of surfactants were tested as foam-forming agents, including PAMs,
poly(saccharide)s, cationic tensides and natural proteins [45]. In all experiment
the foam was generated by nitrogen. The composition of the foam-forming so￾lution was usually the following: 0.5-10.0 g l−1 tenside and 0.5-2.0 g l−1 ad￾ditive. The best foam-forming system was selected by the following screening
criteria:
• foamability,
• foam stability,
• rheological properties in bulk phase and in formation rocks,
• adsorption and retention of chemicals, and
• flow properties in porous media.
18.9 RESIN TYPES
18.9.1 EPOXIDE RESINS
Epoxide resins have good adhesive properties. They can be cured at low tempera￾tures with amine hardeners and at elevated temperatures with organic anhydrides.
Formulations can be adjusted to a long pot life and a low exothermal reaction
in the course of curing. The compositions are not miscible with well fluids. A
disadvantage is the comparatively high price. Standard epoxide resins are based on
bisphenol-A. A method for selectively plugging wells using a low viscous epoxide
resin composition containing a single curing amine based agent has been described
[46,47].
Wells can be treated selectively by using a low viscous epoxide resin formulation
[46,47]. A liquid bisphenol-A-based epoxide material and an amine hardener are used
for curing at ambient temperature. The epoxide material has a very low viscosity
at well surface temperatures and is immiscible with well fluids. The poly(amine)-
curing agent used is an amber-colored mobile liquid having a low viscosity at ambient
temperature. It has a long pot life and a low exothermal. The method is applicable to
plugging permeable zones in a gravel-packed well and may be used to repair leaks
in well casing or production tubing and in cementing to prevent communication
between subterranean regions. Aliphatic epoxide resins are compatible with water,
which is an advantage over more commonly used aromatic epoxide resins that cannot
tolerate water contamination [48].18.9 Resin types 829
A process has been disclosed for reacting poly(urethane)s with epoxy resins in
the presence of aqueous alkali metal silicate solutions, the co-reactants being used
in an amount of substance ratio corresponding to the relationship so that foaming
of the reaction mixture is prevented and an organic polymer structure contain￾ing oxazolidinone ring structures is formed which bears adhesion-improving OH
groups [49].
An alkali silicate aqueous solution in presence of a poly(urethane) (PU) can be
used as a sealing agent. The PU is based on diphenyl methane diisocyanate [50].
Poly(urethane)s are used also in the absence of silicates for sealing operations [51].
Also epoxides can be used to support gel formation [52].
18.9.2 UREA-FORMALDEHYDE RESINS
Urea-formaldehyde resins can be cured with isopropylbenzene production wastes
containing 200-300 g l−1 of aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) as an acid hardener
[53]. Isopropylbenzene is formed as an intermediate in the Hock process by a
Friedel-Crafts reaction from propene and benzene. The mixture hardens in 45-90
min and develops an adhesion to rock and metal of 0.19-0.28 and 0.01-0.07 M Pa,
respectively. A particular advantage is the increased pot life of the formulation.
N-Methylol acrylamide or N-methylol methacrylamide can be polymerized with
peroxides to obtain plugging [6,54]. Suitable inhibitors may be used as retarders of
the polymerization process to ensure sufficient pot life time. The components are in
the form of a preemulsion.
The gelling of the vinyl monomers in an aqueous medium in the presence of an or￾ganic peroxide polymerization initiator is delayed by using an inhibitor consisting of
an alkali metal or ammonium salt of the N-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine combined
with an amino carboxylic acid [7].
Curing of urea-formaldehyde and phenol-formaldehyde
Urea-formaldehyde resins and phenol-formaldehyde resins can be cured by various
mechanisms.
Acid curing
Urea-formaldehyde resins and resol-phenol-formaldehyde resins can be acid cured
by wastes from the production of maleic anhydride (MA) [55]. The waste from
the production of MA contains up to 50% MA, in addition to phthalic anhydride,
citraconic anhydride, benzoic acid, o-tolulic acid, and phthalide, c.f. Figure 18.3.
The plugging solution is prepared by mixing a urea-formaldehyde resin with a
phenol-formaldehyde resin, adding the waste from production of MA, and mixing
thoroughly.
Aluminum trichloride
In an analogous way, an AlCl3 containing waste of isopropylbenzene production
[53] can be used as an acid hardener for urea-formaldehyde resins. The waste830 CHAPTER 18 Water shutoff
O

Phthalide.
from the production of isopropylbenzene, via a Friedel-Crafts reaction, contains
approximately 200-300 g l−1 of AlCl3.
Alkaline curing
A plugging solution based on phenol-formaldehyde resin, formaldehyde, and water
has been described. To improve the plugging efficiency under conditions of low
temperatures, the solution also contains a bituminous emulsion [56]. Curing is
achieved with free formaldehyde under alkaline conditions. The plugging solution
is prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of a phenol-formaldehyde resin with
a bituminous emulsion and adding the hardener (formaldehyde) directly before
pumping solution into the stratum. Tests showed that the formulation has a low
viscosity and a reduced hardening time. The solution has an improved plugging
capability at low (but above zero) temperatures.
18.9.3 FURAN-SILICONE RESINS
A plugging material with 2-furaldehyde-acetone monomer and silicone oligomers
has been described [57]. The components for this material are shown in
Table 18.8.
The 2-furaldehyde-acetone monomer can contain mono-furfurylidene-acetone
and difurfurylidene-acetone. The hardener can be iron chloride, benzene sulfonic
acid, hexamethylene diamine, or poly(ethylene amine). The plugging stone has
improved strength, elastic deformation, and anticorrosion and adhesion properties.
2-Furfurylidene is shown in Figure 18.4.

18.10 CEMENT WITH ADDITIVES
18.10.1 POLY(METHYL METHACRYLATE) MODIFIED
WITH MONOETHANOLAMINE
Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) can be modified with monoethanolamine to
form a water-soluble polymer. This is used as a cement additive to increase the
strength in amounts smaller than 0.5% of the total weight of the composition
[58]. The produced plugging stone has improved strength characteristics within a
temperature range of −30 to +300 ◦C.
Aluminum oxychloride and modified PMMA as cement additives exhibit a
reduction of the permeability of the stratum up to 99.69% [59].
18.10.2 CRUDE LIGHT PYRIDINE BASES
Small amounts of pyridine bases increase the corrosion resistance of cement stone
without any associated loss of strength [60]. The use of nitrilo trimethyl phosphonic
acid and an adduct between hexamethylenetetramine and chlorinated propene or
butene improves the adhesion to the metal, hardening times, mobility, and strength
[61]. The latter adducts are further claimed to be useful as additives in cementing oil
and gas wells in salt-bearing strata [62].
18.10.3 GRANULATED FLY ASH
Granulated fly ash [63] can substitute for Portland cement to an extent of 40-60%.
Fly ash is used in granulated form and has a moisture content around 10-20%. The
formulation can be used for cementing oil and gas wells within a temperature range of
20-250 ◦C. The solution has reduced water absorption and increased sedimentation
stability. A formulation [64] is shown in Table 18.9. Hydrosil (Aerosil) is used to
increase the adhesion of the produced cement rock to the casing string. It also reduces
the density and water absorption.
18.10.4 PHOSPHONIC ACID DERIVATES
A corrosion resistant formulation [65] is achieved by adding phosphonic acid
and hydrazine hydrochloride, as shown in Table 18.10. Hydrazine hydrochloride,832 CHAPTER 18 Water shutoff

combined with nitrilo trimethyl phosphonic acid, provides a synergetic effect of
increased inhibition of the plugging solution.
The hydrazine hydrochloride can bind the free oxygen present in the plugging
solution. It also reduces the amount of sulfur oxides in the cement rock formed after
hardening, thus preventing corrosion. The plugging rock has an increased corrosion
stability in hydrogen sulfide-containing media. The final product has a high adhesion
to metal. The recipe can be modified with poly(oxyethylene) and a water-soluble
cationic polyelectrolyte to increase the sedimentation stability [66].
18.10.5 PHOSPHONIUM COMPLEXONE
Small amounts of phosphonium complexone [67] are sufficient to increase adhesion
to the stratal rock. Table 18.11 illustrates an example for plugging solution with
Portland cement and phosphonium complexone. Calcium chloride acts as a regulator
of the setting time in the suggested composition. More precisely, phosphonium com￾plexone stands for certain chelating phosphorous compounds (e.g., oxyethylidene

diphosphonic acid, nitrilo trimethyl phosphonic acid, sodium tripoly(phosphate), or
amiphol) [68]. The mixture is applicable at temperatures of 20-75 ◦C.
18.10.6 AERATED PLUGGING SOLUTION
An aerated plugging solution has been proposed that uses certain waste products
from chemical industry [69], as shown in Table 18.12. The water-glycol mixture
contains ethylene glycol, ethylcellosolve, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and
ethyl carbitol. It is obtained as a waste from production of oligomers as a result of
washing the equipment with water.
The composition has an improved thermal stability. When combined with a water￾glycol mixture, it provides a high foam-forming ability and an increased degree
of aeration of the plugging solution. It can be used as part of an aerated plugging
solution, which is suitable for wells under normal geologic conditions and wells
having zones of abnormally low pressure.
18.10.7 COMPRESSED FOAM MIXTURE
Thread leaks, small holes, and leaks around packers in well casings and production
tubing can be repaired by applying a compressed foam mixture [70]. The mixture
contains discrete solid particles of various sizes for forcing the suspended particles
into the opening to achieve a high friction seal. The foam mixture is moved along
the inside of the conduit sandwiched between fluid bodies to keep the foam mixture
intact. A backpressure is applied to the foam mixture to force the mixture through
the openings.
18.10.8 FURFURAMIDE
The addition of furfuramide to a plugging cement in portions of 1-10%
produces a plugging rock of increased corrosion resistance and reduced water
permeability [71].

18.10.9 CELLULOSICS AND POLYACRYLICS
Small amounts of 0.1% of modified methyl cellulose and mono-substituted sodium
phosphate, respectively, may be added to plugging cement [72]. The mono￾substituted sodium phosphate weakens the effect of calcium ions on modified methyl
cellulose and prevents its coagulation. Stabilization of the plugging solution and
increased strength of the cement rock will result. Either PAM or cellulose esters
together with alkali silicate are useful in enhanced oil recovery in front flooding
techniques [73]. Injection in a wellbore forces off the oil from adjacent interlayers
not used in production before. Similarly as PAM cellulose derivates in combination
with silicates reduce the permeability [74,75].
A cement formulation, as indicated in Table 18.13, will be useful as a plugging
solution in deep and super-deep wells at temperatures of 100-160 ◦C and in the
presence of hydrogen sulfide [76]. The solution has a high stability against hydrogen
sulfide aggression.
The trivalent iron chloride is used in hexahydrate form. The solution is prepared
by first making a 1.5% aqueous solution of PAM by stepwise dissolving of portions
of dry PAM powder in water at temperatures of 40-60 ◦C. Then a solution of
iron chloride in water is separately prepared. To this the required amount of ethyl
silicate is added. Eventually the solution is mixed with slag-sand cement. Finally, the
prepared 1.5% PAM solution is added.
18.10.10 SMECTITE CLAYS
Smectite clays, such as hectorites, have been proposed as an additive to Portland
cement to obtain a thixotropic formulation. Good results have been obtained with
the synthetic clay known as Laponite [77]. The material is capable of gelling
reversibly in less than 60 s. The thixotropic material generally finds use in oil
well applications, for example to plug lost circulation zones, as grouts to repair
damaged or corroded casing, and to limit annular gas migration. The material also
finds particular application in techniques for the completion of horizontal wells to be
completed with slotted or predrilled liners.

18.10.11 PLASTICIZERS
When drilling deep wells, successfully filling the annulus with cement slurry can be
achieved by treating the plugging slurry with plasticizers to increase its mobility. It is
desirable that the plasticizer is effective in liquefying the cement slurry. Of course, it
should not adversely affect other parameters of the slurry and hardened cement, and
it should be readily available and inexpensive.
In favorite cases, these requirements have been met by caprolactam production
wastes [78]. The alkaline waste waters of caprolactam production (AWCP) represents
an aqueous solution of the sodium salts of mono- and dicarboxylic acids of 23-34%
concentration, with a solution density of 1.14-1.16 g cm−3 and a pH of 10.4. The
AWCP agent increases the mobility of plugging agents prepared from Portland
cement and gel-cement slurries with various bentonite contents. The AWCP is added
to the mixing water of the cement slurry at a rate of 0.08-0.41%, with respect to the
dry product, to the mass of mixing water. A valuable property of AWCP is that it
plasticizes the plugging slurries; it does not change the setting time of the cement
slurries or the strength of the hardened cement.
18.10.12 WATER GLASS
A plugging slurry for oil and gas well drilling is given in Table 18.14 [79]. It is
formed by adding water to the Portland cement suspension containing the other
three constituents. The bentonite clay powder is premixed with water glass to form
a paste, and this paste is allowed to stand for at least 4 h. The composition is
then mixed to a paste with the NaCl solution. Premixing the clay powder with the
water glass produces a protective layer on the clay particles to hinder the hydration
of the clay. The formulation is used as a plugging slurry for drilling oil and gas
wells. The moisture-combining capacity of the solidified rock is increased, while its
permeability is simultaneously reduced.

18.10.13 ORGANOSILICONES
Silicones may improve the properties of a Portland cement formulation when added
to the cement in amounts of 0.2-2% [80]. An example of a formulation of the additive
is given in Table 18.15.
The presence of the additive results in the formation of a homogeneous structure
of the plugging rock, with an improved uniformity of the phase composition of the
system and a more compact distribution of the dispersed particles. An increased
strength of the cement rock is also obtained.
18.10.14 FORMALDEHYDE RESIN
Expanding additives improve the filtering properties of a cement [81,82]. An
expanding additive is based on calcium oxide (CaO) fired at high temperatures.
The expansion takes place on the uptake of water. An example for a formulation
containing an expanding additive is shown in Table 18.16.
An amino-formaldehyde resin or acetone-formaldehyde resin has the capability
to harden in alkaline media, in contact with a cement solution with a pH of 11-12.
The presence of sintered CaO provides the required conditions for hardening of the
methylol groups of the formaldehyde resin with Ca2+ ions and a further simultaneous
reaction of the methylol groups that formed hydrate compounds, resulting in an
improved dispersion and plastification of the solution.

18.10.15 LIQUID METAL ALLOY
A liquid metal alloy containing gallium, indium, and tin has been proposed as an
additive to Portland cement [83]. A formulation is shown in Table 18.17. The liquid
metal alloy has a melting point of 11 ◦C. Its presence does not cause corrosion of
stainless steel up to 250 ◦C but causes corrosion of steel alloys at temperature above
35 ◦C. It dissolves aluminum at room temperature. The alloy is harmless to skin and
to mucous membranes.
Isobutanol is used as an alcohol component, to increase strength of produced
cement stone. It should be noted that gallium and indium are precious and better
used in the nonferrous metal industries.
18.10.16 BENTONITE
A composition for plugging wells that is biodegradable and environmentally safe is
made of bentonite particles covered with a water-soluble coating of biodegradable
natural resin [84]. The bentonite may be in the form of chips or compressed
pellets. When exposed to water, the soluble coating dissolves at a uniform rate,
exposing the bentonite to water. As a result of the water contacts it expands to
form a tough but flexible water-impermeable seal of a semisolid, gel like mass. The
well plugging composition is nontoxic, nonpolluting, and nonhazardous. It will not
become sticky or commence expanding upon initial contact with water and thereby
prevents binding, clumps, and faulty seals.
A two-component plugging material consists of an aqueous suspension of
bentonite clay powder (20-25%), ground chalk (7-8%), sulfanol (0.10-0.15%), and
carboxymethyl cellulose (1.0-1.5%) as the first component [85]. This solution is
pumped into the formation. A gel is formed if diluted hydrochloric acid is pumped
down and mixes with the first component. The hydrochloric acid is inhibited with a
mixture of alkyl polybenzyl pyridinium chloride and urotropin.
Each of the individual reagents has a low viscosity and good pumping properties.
After mixing in the stratum, they produce a highly viscous nonfiltering plug as an
end result of a chemical reaction.

18.10.17 BLAST FURNACE SLAG
Blast furnace slag is used successfully as a mud-to-cement conversion technology
in oil well cementing worldwide because of economic, technical, and environmental
advantages [86]. Slag-mix slurries were used as primary, temporary abandonment
and sidetrack plug cements during prospect predrilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
However, the penetration rates were slower than expected when these plugs were
drilled out. Therefore a basic study concerning the drilling properties was initiated.
Slag-mix, solidified mud, and conventional class H Portland cement were eval￾uated under controlled laboratory conditions to better understand and quantify
differences in drillability between these two types of cement under realistic downhole
conditions. The objectives of this study were to refine the bit selection and drilling
practices for more cost effective slag-mix plug drilling.
18.10.18 FIBER REINFORCEMENT
Fibers can be added to a gelation solution [87,88]. The fibers chosen must not
interfere with the gelation process and must provide adequate reinforcement. On the
other hand, they should not adversely affect the ability of the solution to be pumped
and injected. Glass fibers and cellulosic fibers are specifically disclosed as preferable
reinforcing fibers.
Mineral fibers that are highly soluble in acid can be used to control the permeabil￾ity of formations [89,90]. The fibers are 5-15 μ m in diameter and are formed into
pellets of 1
32 to 1
2 in diameter. A fluid-blocking layer formed of semidispersed pellets
can bridge the face pores of the formation. After well rework, the plugging layer
is treated with an acid solution to quickly dissolve the mineral fibers to the desired
extent to control porosity.
The preferred fiber material typically consists of about 35.7% CaO, 9.6% MgO,
9.3% Al2O3, and 42.3% SiO2. The composition of an example fiber material is shown
in Table 18.18. This product is highly soluble in hydrochloric acid (HCl), forming a
soluble silicic acid from the SiO2, which is suspended in the HCl until, after a very
long time, a residual silica gel may form and drop out of the solution. In a blend
of 15% HCl and 10% acetic acid, the silica gel does not form or drop out of the
solution. Thus, a quick method of acid wash scavenging removes as much of the
fibrous network in the sealing mat as desired to establish a porous formation face of
predetermined permeability.
Asbestos has been proposed as a reinforcing component [91]. However, asbestos
is believed to be a carcinogen.
Glass fibers and cellulosic fibers are specifically disclosed as preferable reinforc￾ing fibers for a gelling solution of PHPA with a crosslinking agent [92]. The fibers are
added to a gelation solution, and the mixture is pumped to a subterranean injection
site, where it gels in place. The fibers do not interfere with the gelation process and
can provide adequate reinforcement without adversely affecting the ability of the
solution to be pumped and injected.18.11 Organosilicones 839

Aluminum hydroxychloride is used as a plugging agent [93]. A weak base activator
such as sodium cyanate with an activator aid can establish delayed gelation.
18.11 ORGANOSILICONES
Silicones are the most frequently used compounds for hydrophobization in diverse
industrial areas. A silicone microemulsion was developed for restriction of water
production in gas wells. The treating solution was a surfactant stabilized siloxane
emulsion, which was driven into the formation by water and nitrogen [94]. Further,
various silanes, siloxanes and silicone resins in solution, mostly in i-propanol or in
i-octane were for restriction of water production in gas wells [95].
Both silicone fluids (microemulsion and solution in i-propanol) resulted in a
significant mobility change in cores. The mobility reduction is extreme in the case
of the concentrated siloxane systems, which can easily be explained by their high
viscosity.
A disproportional permeability modification was observed in the background
of the water retention of the microemulsions. The phenomena are attributed to
the inversion of the microemulsion to a macroemulsion which is initiated by the
spontaneous dilution by water and then entrapping of formed siloxane droplets by
the pores. The stock silicone emulsion was a water-external microemulsion with
30% siloxane content. A mixture of non-ionic surfactants was used to stabilize the
microemulsion. According to laser light scattering measurements the siloxane droplet
size was about 280 nm.840 CHAPTER 18 Water shutoff
Comparing the efficiency of mobility reducing effects, the silicone microemulsion
is more effective. The most extreme mobility reduction was obtained by the dilute
microemulsion containing only 0.2 g l−1 siloxane. The experiments revealed that
the mechanisms of silicone emulsion and solution type treatments are different
[94]. Obviously, the highly diluted silicone emulsion and its external aqueous phase
containing a mixture of three non-ionic surfactants makes the cores more water-wet
and the negative expected effect of silicone on the wettability is completely absent.
On the other hand, the shift of the wettability toward the oil-wet character is imminent
when an siloxane solution, in i-propanol, is used as a treating agent. Namely, a strong
chemical interaction between the siloxane and the rock surface can be excluded
in microemulsion type treatments, while the formation of an adsorbed siloxane
layer is probably responsible for changes in wettability, and hence in hydrodynamic
properties of water/gas/rock systems.
18.12 NON-CROSSLINKED COPOLYMERS
Also non crosslinked Polymers can serve for disproportionate permeability reduction.
A copolymer constituted of a hydrophilic monomer and a hydrophobically modi￾fied hydrophilic monomer is a particularly effective disproportionate permeability
reducer. The polymer adsorbs on the surfaces within the porous formation.
Examples of hydrophilic comonomers are AAm, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-
propane sulfonic acid, acrylic acid (AA), dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate,
and vinylpyrrolidone [96]. Hydrophobically modified hydrophilic comonomers
are in particular octadecyldimethyl ammonium ethyl methacrylate bromide,
hexadecyldimethyl ammonium ethyl methacrylate bromide, hexadecyldimethyl
ammonium propyl methacrylamide bromide, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate and
hexadecyl methacrylamide. The hydrophobically modified hydrophilic comonomer
is present in 1-10 mol-%.
18.12.1 ANCHORING
Disproportionate permeability reduction by using polymers constituted by hy￾drophilic monomers is also addressed as anchoring [97]. The term monomeric
anchoring unit refers to components of a polymer that will preferentially adhere,
by either physical or chemical processes, to the subterranean formation material.
Therefore, these moieties cause the polymer to retain to the formation material.
Anchoring groups are introduced to prevent a polymer from washing out of the
formation due to fluid flow.
Primary, or first anchoring sites for the monomeric anchoring units are clay and
feldspar surfaces existing in formation pores, channels and pore throats. Because
of the polarity, particularly useful anchoring units have functional groups, which
can hydrolyze to form amine-based anchoring groups on the polymer. These type
of monomers are addressed as first anchor units. Besides of these first anchor
monomers, second anchor units may be present that are salt functional vinyl
monomers.18.14 Water swelling additives 841
Primary anchor monomers can be N-vinylformamide, N-methylacetamide, or
N,N-diallylacetamide. Secondary anchor monomers can be acrylamidomethyl￾propanesulfonic acid ammonium or alkali metal salts, AA salts, dimethyl diallyl
ammonium chloride
18.13 INORGANIC COLLOIDS
Numerous inorganic compounds are able to form colloid systems, particularly gel
like precipitates. This feature can be utilized for plugging purposes. The number
of selectable inorganic compounds is limited because the sealing system must
correspond to special requirements. For instance, it is important that the chemical
reaction mechanism has to comprise spontaneous elements, meanwhile the process
should remain highly controllable.
Basically, these requirements can be fulfilled by the sulfur-ammonium group
of multivalent cations. Their common feature is that their ionic compounds easily
hydrolyze in aqueous media in alkaline medium resulting in a gel like precipitate.
The hydroxides of such cations are practically insoluble in water, although some
of them show amphoteric character. Experiments showed that in particular Fe(III)
compounds can be transformed into gel like precipitates by in situ hydrolysis, which
is then immobilized by in situ flocculation or spontaneous aging [98].
The blocking agent proposed consists of two aqueous solutions. The first solution
contains iron trichloride in hydrochloric acid and a corrosion inhibitor. The second
solution contains sodium carbonate and as flocculant a low molecular weight PAM
or PHPA. A particular technique is superior to conventional techniques fulfilling the
following advantages [2]:
1. low viscosity of treating solutions, viz. good placement selectivity,
2. short to moderate pumping time before onset of gelation, block/barrier
formation,
3. flexible chemical mechanism of gelation,
4. good chemical and chemical stability of gel,
5. effective immobilization of gel or barrier,
6. excellent thermal, flow and mechanical resistivity,
7. easy gel breaking in case of technical failures, and
8. simple and cost effective surface technology.
18.14 WATER SWELLING ADDITIVES
18.14.1 WATER SWELLING CELLULOSE
In porous-fractured oil reservoirs water shutoff can be achieved by the injection of a
selective waterproofing polymer composition with subsequent additional injection of
a polymer with an initial size of its particles smaller than the transverse sizes of the
fractures. The polymer is a water-swelling hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) [99]. The842 CHAPTER 18 Water shutoff
water shutoff takes place in the water-bearing part of formation. The permeability of
the oil formation is preserved.
18.14.2 HYDROLYZED POLY(ACRYLONITRILE)
Hydrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (HPAN) exhibits the properties of a polyelectrolyte.
A method of water shutoff utilizing HPAN consists of two steps [100]. Prior to the
injection of HPAN, the water-bearing part of the formation is treated with a semi
concentrated solution of hydrochloric acid. Then by injecting HPAN, this polymer is
further hydrolyzed in the formation and therefore clocks the formation.
18.14.3 GUAR
Guar gum is a standard polymer for the well-treating fluids. The polymer is a
poly(saccharide) material known as poly(galactomannan). This material develops a
high viscosity via hydration of the fluid to be thickened. Fast-hydrating derivatives
of guar are hydroxypropyl guar, carboxymethyl guar, and carboxymethyl hydrox￾ypropyl guar. Fast hydration occurs within only 30 s, whereas conventional guars
need some 30 min.
18.14.4 CLAYS
The usage of clays is based on the fact that clays that can swell when placed in
the formation. Swelling can occur when a clay dispersed in an organic medium
arrives a water contact, or when the ionic strength of the aqueous medium changes
by placement.
High-permeability regions can be blocked by a reinforced swelling clay gel.
The clay slurry is prepared by mixing a swelling clay, such as bentonite, with
an aqueous solution containing the salt of certain cations, which inhibit the clay
swelling, and a reinforcing agent [101]. The reinforced clay slurry is introduced
into high-permeability regions. There, the slurry is contacted with NaCl brine
solution present in natural or injected drive fluids, and the inhibitive cations bound
to the clay particles are replaced by Na+ ions, which attract water molecules and
promote clay swelling. A similar procedure is suitable for blocking high-permeability
channels [102].
Organophilic swelling clay
Compositions for permanent plugging are comprised of oil, a hydratable polymer,
an organophilic clay, and a water swellable clay. An oil-based sealing composition
contains diesel oil present in the range of 43-53%, HEC present in an amount in
the range of 4-5%, an alkyl quaternary ammonium bentonite clay present in an
amount of 0.4-0.5% and water swellable bentonite clay present at 42-53% [103].
These compositions and methods develop ultra high viscosity in a few seconds or
minutes. However, they cannot removed easily.18.15 Wastes 843
18.15 WASTES
Several industrial waste products may be used as ingredients for plugging solutions.
Some examples are summarized in Table 18.19. Others are detailed in other sections.
The use of industrial wastes for plugging solutions is regarded as a method of
waste disposal and has been originally proposed in the Eastern European countries.
Waste material from other processes has been established to be active, such as waste
from galvanizing processes [107]. In this case, the components must be placed in two
portions. Iron and chromic salts from lignosulfonate are used for metal ions [112].
Lignosulfonates are waste products from the paper industry.
18.15.1 WASTE OIL SLUDGE
A plugging material with approximately 85% oil sludge, 10% formaldehyde, and 2%
sulfuric acid has been proposed [113]. The oil sludge was left behind during primary
preparation of processing oil and contains 8-16% of oil. It is a paste like mass and
consists of finely crushed rock fractions and oil. The material is produced by direct
mixing of the three components. For application, the mixture is pumped into the well
followed by pressing-in air, which is preheated to 80-140 ◦C.
The compressive strength of the produced plugging rock is shown in Table 18.20.
The material is cheaper because industrial waste is used and it produces a plugging
rock of increased strength.

18.15.2 ALUMINUM TRICHLORIDE
Aluminum trichloride, a cheap, abundant waste product of the chemical industry,
forms a gel under certain conditions with carbonates and on mixing with alkalis.
Laboratory and field tests showed that aluminum trichloride can be used as a gel￾forming agent for reducing the permeability of water-conducting channels [114].
18.15.3 ANTIFOAMING WITH SULFITE-WASTE LIQUOR
A widespread additive for plasticizing plugging agents is sulfite-waste liquor (SWL),
but its use is limited because of pronounced foaming of the agents when SWL is
added to the cement in amounts greater than 0.5%. To prevent foaming when large
amounts of SWL are added, a drilling mud antifoam agent should be added at the
same time [115].
With the use of this antifoaming agent, consisting of poly(methylsiloxane) and
tributyl phosphate, a synergistic effect is observed. Poly(methylsiloxane) simultane￾ously displaces the adsorbed molecules of the foam stabilizer (i.e., lignosulfonate)
from the foam film, and the tributyl phosphate, c.f., Figure 18.5, reduces the surface
viscosity of the film.

18.16 SURFACTANTS
18.16.1 POLYMERIC SURFACTANTS
A reduction of the water permeability of a water producing zone can be achieved by
injecting a polymeric surfactant and an inert gas into the water producing zone.
There are number of studies of physical gels which are formed by polymer￾surfactant interactions. The gelation and viscoelastic behavior results from specific
interactions between the polymer chains and the micelles formed from assembled
surfactant monomers. Commonly, the polymers have some fraction of hydrophobic
groups on their chains which are associated with the surfactant micelle, or solubilized
in the surfactant micelle [116–119].
18.16.2 VISCOELASTIC SURFACTANT SOLUTIONS
The term viscoelastic refers to those viscous fluids having elastic properties, i.e., the
liquid at least partially returns to its original form when an applied stress is released.
Viscoelastic surfactant solutions have been described in detail by Hoffmann [120–
123]. Viscoelasticity is caused by a different type of micelle formation than the
usual spherical micelles formed by most surfactants. Viscoelastic surfactant fluids
form worm-like, rod-like or cylindrical micelles in solution. The formation of long,
cylindrical micelles creates useful rheological properties.
The viscoelastic surfactant solution exhibits shear thinning behavior, and remains
stable despite repeated high shear applications. By comparison, a typical polymeric
thickener will irreversibly degrade when subjected to high shear [124]. However,
viscoelastic surfactants usually require higher concentrations of surfactant than the
polymeric gelling agent systems to develop equivalent viscosity [125].
Amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants
An amphoteric surfactant is a class of surfactant that has both a positively charged
moiety and a negatively charged moiety over a certain pH range, only a negatively
charged moiety over a certain pH range, and only a positively charged moiety at a
different pH range. A zwitterionic surfactant has a permanently positively charged
moiety in the molecule regardless of pH and a negatively charged moiety at alkaline
pH [124].
Ionic strength
Two techniques have been proposed for the controlled gelation of surfactant solutions
using changes in their ionic environments. Firstly, it is proposed to exchange the
anions in the surfactant solution by replacing an anion which inhibits gelation with
one which promotes it.
The anion exchange can be achieved by flowing the surfactant solution through
a pipe or tube, the walls of which consist of an anion exchange membrane, further a
counter-flow of an electrolyte containing the exchange anion is flowed on the other
side of the membrane [126].846 CHAPTER 18 Water shutoff
Mixtures of a surfactant with polymers
Mixtures of a surfactant with polymers can result in a rigid gel. Such compositions
can undergo a two stage gelation process [20]. In the context with a polymer, the
viscoelastic surfactants are also addressed as gel promoting additives [127].
In the first stage the surfactant micelles in the solution aggregate and entangle
to form a viscoelastic physical gel. The viscoelasticity of this gel can be rapidly
destroyed in contact with hydrocarbons and other organic solvents but is maintained
for many hours in contact with water [20]. In the second stage, the polymer can
be crosslinked using a suitable chemical crosslinker. The crosslinked polymer gel
forms within, and largely independently of, the surfactant gel. The final gel behaves
as a chemical gel which is significantly less responsive to its external physical
and chemical environment. For example, the viscoelasticity of the final gel is not
significantly affected by contact with hydrocarbon.
Surfactant polymer compositions
An example for such an acrylic based composition consists of a solution of 30 g l−1
of the surfactant N-erucyl-N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-methyl ammonium chloride
and 7 g l−1 of the hydrophobically modified polymer PAM of molecular weight 2
M Dalton with 3% of the hydrophobic n-nonyl acrylate monomer [20].
A cationic colloidal coacervate includes both a cationic polymer and an anionic
surfactant, e.g. poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride). The viscosifying proper￾ties of a polymer coacervate are controlled by long chain cationic or anionic polymer
and a smaller amount of an oppositely charged surfactant. Further a hydrophobic
alcohol is present to form a singular phase [127], e.g., lauryl alcohol. In Table 18.21
selected components for coacervate gel systems are summarized.
18.17 TAILORING THE HYDRODYNAMIC VOLUME
Gas production from gas fields and underground gas storage is usually accompanied
by substantial water production. The high water production and necessity of on-site
water liquidation often deteriorate the recovery efficiency and hamper maintaining
an environmentally friendly production. Because of the inverse mobility ratio in a
gas/water system, the conventional water shutoff or profile correction methods cannot
be used successfully under field conditions.

Poly(acrylic acid) Quaternary ammonium surfactants18.17 Tailoring the hydrodynamic volume 847
A viable procedure is the injection of a high salt containing polymer solution into
the wells utilizing the reversible swelling/shrinking properties with ionic strength.
The reversible expansion and contraction, respectively, of polymer coils can be
utilized for selective restriction of water flow and production in gas wells if
special preconditions are fulfilled. The most important requirements are as follows:
irreversible polymer adsorption at the rock surface, compatible molecular size with
pore structure and cyclic gas/water flow or change in salt content in the bulk aqueous
phase.
An alternative approach is to use a poor solvent in preparation of the treating
solution [128]. This concept is based on the fact that the solvent power worsens as
the content of an at least partially water-soluble organic compound in an aqueous
phase is increasing.
Short chain alcohols have drastic effects both on the rheological properties and on
the structure of aqueous polymer solutions. These phenomena are explained by the
substantial impact of a poor solvent on the coil size and hence, intermolecular and
intramolecular interactions in different polymer solutions. There is also a remarkable
effect on polymer adsorption and consequently, on flow phenomena of polymer
solutions in porous media.
The change of coil density significantly depends on the type of alcohol and the
ionization of the polymers. Partially hydrolyzed polymers show much greater drop
in size than only slightly or unhydrolyzed PAMs. With increasing coil density due
to increasing with the alcohol content, the specific polymer adsorption is gradually
increased. Even at low alcohol content, the adsorbed amount might be an order of
magnitude higher than in alcohol-free systems. At high alcohol content, the partial
precipitation or the mechanical entrapment of the polymer in the porous medium can
not be excluded.
The permeability of polymer treated cores can be completely reconstructed by
removing all the solvents from the adsorbed layer. That is the case when dry
gas is injected into the polymer preflushed core. Evaporation of the bulk phase
liquid from coils and adsorbed layers can be accelerated by using alcohols with a
small enthalpy of vaporization. The specific enthalpy of vaporization of short chain
alcohols decreases with the chain length, i.e., with the fraction of hydroxyl groups in
the molecule, capable to form hydrogen bonds.
Another beneficial effect of alcohols on the solution properties is that they
decrease substantially the surface tension. This effect definitely contributes to adsorb
more polymer and to form a more closely packed layer on the rock surface
providing a pronounced and stable disproportional permeability modification in
porous systems.
18.17.1 TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE LATEX PARTICLES
Certain latex particles are temperature sensitive and reversibly flocculate, shrink and
harden at higher temperatures, and disperse, expand and soften at lower temperatures.848 CHAPTER 18 Water shutoff
These particles can form effective blocking agents in the presence of an ionic
compound, in a petroleum reservoir.
There is a decrease in particle diameter of the poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) latex
particles on heating. This procedure was found to be fully reversible over a number
of heating and cooling cycles with no hysteresis taking place between the heating and
cooling curves [129].

19 Oil spill treating agents
The most spectacular incidents concerning oil spills occur in coastal regions.
Therefore most of this chapter is devoted to this topic. However, a section is devoted
to subsurface and soil remediation jobs.
Chemical dispersants can be used to reduce the interfacial tension (IFT) of
floating oil slicks so that the oils disperse more rapidly into the water column and
thus pose less of a threat to shorelines, birds, and marine mammals. The action of oil
spill treating agents goes beyond simply dispersing the spilled oil.
In particular, oil spill treating agents can be divided into four classes: solidifiers,
demulsifying agents, surface-washing agents, and dispersants. The majority of oil
spill treating agents, however, are described as dispersants. The terminology in the
literature is not unique. Oil spill treating agents are referred to as:
• oil spill treating agents,
• spill treating agents,
• chemical shoreline cleaning agents,
• shoreline cleaning agents,
• chemical beach cleaners,
• oil spill dispersants, and
• oil spill cleanup agents.
19.1 HISTORY
Oil spill treating agents have been a subject of controversy since their introduction
during the Torrey Canyon oil spill off the coast of the United Kingdom in 1967. The
dispersant policies of several European nations and Canada have been reviewed and
compared with those of the United States [1].
19.1.1 LIST OF MAJOR OIL SPILLS
The importance of spill treating agents is reflected by a list of major oil spills in the
past, which is given in Table 19.1.
19.1.2 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
There are some requirements that oil spill treating agents should fulfill. Chemi￾cal dispersants are often used to disperse spilled oils, which threaten to pollute

shoreline areas. Oil spill dispersants increase the surface area of the oil, which ac￾celerates the process of biodegradation. However, the toxic properties of dispersants
limit their use.
In particular, oil spill treating agents should have a long shelf life and should be:
• ecologically friendly,
• nontoxic,
• nonpolluting,19.1 History 861
• biodegradable,
• highly active,
• noncorrosive, and
• applicable from boats, aircraft, and helicopters.
Special formulations that are suitable for various environments, such as marine,
shoreline, fresh water and salt water, tropic, and arctic environments, have been
developed.
Storage
Oil spill dispersant chemicals have often been stored for long periods awaiting their
use in an emergency case. It is not uncommon to find stocks being stored for more
than 5 years. Dispersants severely lose their efficiency or deteriorate in other ways
during storage, so they no longer meet the performance specifications necessary.
Therefore accelerated storage and corrosion tests have been performed [4]. The
tests compiled background information on eight typical high performance oil spill
dispersants.
19.1.3 MECHANISMS
Influence of the dispersant performance on the crude oil type
Crude oils contain various amounts of indigenous surface active agents that stabilize
water-in-oil emulsions. Therefore crude oils may stabilize such emulsions. It has
been shown that the effectiveness of a dispersant is dependent on both the dispersant
type and the specific crude oil [5]. However, there is no apparent correlation between
the degree of emulsion-forming tendency of the crude oil, which is a function of
the indigenous surfactant content, and the effectiveness of the dispersant. In general,
indigenous surfactants in crude oil reduce the effectiveness of the dispersant, but to
an unpredictable level.
Surface chemical aspects of oil spill dispersant behavior
Dispersants are widely used in many parts of the world to deal with oil spills on
the ocean. The objective of adding the dispersant is to emulsify the oil slick into the
water column. This prevents wind forces from moving the slick to shore and may
increase the bioavailability of the oil because of the large increase in surface area
caused by emulsification. Dispersants are surface active agents whose behavior can
be understood through the application of surface chemical principles [6].
Modern oil spill dispersant formulations are concentrated blends of surface active
agents in a solvent carrier system. Surfactants are effective for lowering the IFT
of the oil slick and promoting and stabilizing oil-in-water dispersions. The solvent
system has two key functions: (1) to reduce the viscosity of the surfactant blend to
allow efficient dispersant application and (2) to promote mixing and diffusion of the
surfactant blend into the oil film [7].862 CHAPTER 19 Oil spill treating agents
Photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds on water
A method for treating an oil film floating on water is composed of two functions [8]:
1. dispersing a number of water-floatable particles on an oil film, the particles of a
material that, under illumination and in the presence of air, accelerates the
oxidation of organic compounds in the oil film and
2. allowing the particles to be exposed to solar illumination and ambient air.
The particles consist of a bead with an exterior surface that is at least partially
coated with a material capable of accelerating the oxidation of organic compounds
floating on water, under illumination, and in the presence of air. The coated bead is
water-floatable and has a diameter of less than 2mm. The bead consists of a plastic
material coated with an intermediate layer of a material that will not accelerate the
oxidation of the plastic material by air or by itself, oxidized under illumination and
in the presence of air by the outer coating material.
19.1.4 APPLICATION
Oil spill treating agents may be applied from boats, hydrofoils, aircraft, or helicopters
in the case of large-scale pollution. For minor incidents such as car accidents, the
application is done by hand.
Boat
A dispersant fan sprayer has been built and tested statically on land and demonstrated
offshore on a supply vessel while spraying water. Coverage rates of 4 miles2d−1 are
possible by boat, using high-speed fans that create a focused air stream with maximal
velocities of 90 miles h−1 [9]. The dispersant is injected into and propelled by the
air stream. With the air stream acting as a carrier for the dispersant, the spraying
of smaller volumes of concentrate dispersant or dilute dispersant over a wide swath
width is made possible. The water surface is gently agitated by the air stream and
liquid impact.
Corexit® 9527 is a dispersant, dissolved in water and ethylene glycol monobutyl
ether. The nature of the surface active agent has not been disclosed. Laboratory tests
were conducted using 0.5 mm thick, fresh Alberta Sweet-Mixed Blend crude oil
treated with Corexit® 9527 dispersant applied from an overhead spray boom [10].
The effects on dispersion efficiency of mixing jet pressure, mixing jet flow rate, jet
standoff distance, and vessel speed were evaluated. The system operates with a nozzle
pressure of 7000 kPa, a flow rate of 55 l min−1 per nozzle, and nozzles positioned
approximately 0.6 m from the water surface. In laboratory tests, such a system was
capable of dispersing 80-100% of the surface slick.
Herding effect
In a series of trials, three dispersants were sprayed from a boat. It was concluded that
a high level of energy at the sea surface mitigates the discrepancies in the efficiencies
of the dispersants as measured in laboratory tests. Better results were obtained in19.1 History 863
relatively thick oil slicks. The low efficiency measured when treating downwind was
attributed to the already-observed herding effect.
These complementary results reinforce the actions that have been developed to
optimize the application of dispersants by ship. The equipment for neat dispersant
spraying has been described. An operational treatment procedure has described how
to map, mark out, prospect, and treat oil slicks according to the slick shape, estimated
oil thickness, and wind direction [11].
Hydrofoils
Ships are considered most suitable to apply a dispersant with spray booms, because
of their large carrying capacity and their ability to navigate and operate even under
bad weather conditions and at night. Experiments have shown that cleanup at a speed
greater than 10 knots is unadvisable because the bow wave breaks up the oil film on
the water. A high-speed craft such as a hydrofoil, when flying foilborne, solves this
problem, however [12]. In fact, upon reaching its take-off speed, it raises itself above
the water.
The hydrofoil has a special stability because it is kept above the water by the foil
lift. Because it rises above the water, the hydrofoil avoids creating disturbing wave
motion and thus long spray booms can be used.
Aircraft
A portable spray unit has been developed for the application of dispersants by large
airplanes, such as the Hercules C–130. This spray unit can be placed rapidly in
the cargo aircraft without any mechanical alterations. Tests spraying a dispersant
concentrate have been performed [13].
Campaigns of dispersant offshore trials were conducted from 1979 to 1985 off
the French Mediterranean and Brittany coasts. Approximately 30 slicks were treated
with several dispersants applied from ships, helicopters, and an aircraft by different
spraying systems [14]. The experiments identified different effects of dispersants
such as short-term dispersion of oil, delayed dissemination, and limiting parameters
such as minimal energy of sea surface, ratio of dispersant to oil needed, and
negative herding effect. Various techniques were tested to optimize the application
of dispersants in different situations. The techniques included use of a variable flow
rate system to spray neat concentrates from ships and varying methods of operating
ships and aircraft to reach a selective distribution of dispersant and get good coverage
of slicks.
A field test was conducted by spraying a commercial oil spill dispersant (Corexit®
9527) from aircraft [15]. Test objectives were to determine the efficiency of
delivering the dispersant to a selected target using a large aircraft and to compare
various measurement systems for droplet size and spray pattern distribution. The
results indicated that aerial flights up to 46 m can produce droplet sizes and swath
widths that would be operationally effective for an oil spill.
Corexit® 9527, dyed with Rhodamine WT, was applied by aircrafts at a target
dose rate of 5 gal/acre over a collection grid of metal trays, Kromekote cards,864 CHAPTER 19 Oil spill treating agents
oil-sensitive cards, and a continuous trough [16]. Analysis of the collected dispersant
was done colorimetrically, fluorometrically, and by image analysis. Correlations
through the different methodologies demonstrated that high-speed, moderate-altitude
application of oil dispersant could be successful in delivering the dispersant to the
surface at an effective concentration and appropriate drop size. Environmental studies
of the test area showed no residual dispersant in the soil following the cessation of
spraying treatment.
19.1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
The rise in environmental concern, coupled with the enormity of some oil spills in
the recent past, has led to the development of new generations of oil spill dispersants.
Biodegradation
Biodegradable oil spill dispersants with high efficiency and low toxicity have
been prepared and tested. They consist of non-ionic and surfactants with a low
toxicity with different molecular weights [17]. The relationship between IFT and
the efficiency and chemical structure of the prepared oil spill dispersants was also
studied.
A test to determine the biodegradation rate of the dispersant and the biodegra￾dation rate of the dispersant-oil mixture has been proposed [18]. The test method is
intended to supplement the toxicity tests and the effectiveness tests, which evaluate
the performance of oil spill dispersants.
Standardized measurement of ecologic effects
The number and variety of both toxicologic and analytic methodologies generating
data on this topic are numerous, making it virtually impossible to compare data sets
to arrive at a coherent conclusion. In 1994, the Chemical Response to Oil Spills
Ecological Effects Research Forum (CROSERF) was formed.
It is a working group composed of representatives from industry, academia, and
government. The goals of CROSERF are dedicated to standardizing and improving
the quality and usefulness of laboratory and mesocosmos research into the ecologic
effects of oil spill treating agents [19,20].
Toxicity
Seagrasses, Mangroves, and Corals
Jamaica’s shoreline is at the intersection of five major petroleum tanker shipping
routes and is a cargo transshipment point for the Caribbean. The island of Jamaica
experiences six small sized to medium-sized oil spills per year. Major ports of
petroleum entry are close to mangroves, seagrass, and coral resources. One of the
most critical habitats throughout the Atlantic subtropics and tropics is seagrass.
Seagrasses, mangrove, and coral habitats function as fisheries’ nursery habitats, food,
and erosion control. If the seagrasses are removed, hundreds of fisheries’ organisms19.1 History 865
disappear. Seven dispersants were tested for 100 h on three seagrasses with respect
to their toxicity [21].
The results showed that the mortality differed among seagrasses and among
dispersants. Based on these results, oil spill cleanup plans were recommended
that indicate exact dispersants and concentrations to be used in areas containing
seagrasses. In general, the coral toxicity parallels the seagrass response to the
dispersants [22]. Recommendations for use of nontoxic dispersants, with primarily
coral reef and fish sensitivity as paramount concerns, are Cold Clean, Corexit® 9550,
and Finasol OSR7 [23].
Response on Daphnia magna
The use of dispersants for petroleum is often recommended in accidental aquatic
pollution situations in which an oil layer is capable of reaching the banks of
a river or water pond. The petroleum is then emulsified in the water, which
makes it bioavailable for degrading organisms. However, this bioavailability may be
responsible for an increase of the oil toxicity for the living organisms in the water. In
addition, the dispersant itself is potentially toxic and its release in the environment
must be controlled.
In the case of river streams, the effect of dispersing the oil creates a strong peak of
pollution running along the river flow. The living organisms are submitted to short￾term but intense pollution, leading to acute effects.
The time dependence of the acute toxicity of oil and dispersants on a sensitive
fresh water organism, namely, Daphnia magna, was investigated [24]. Two different
oils were used: a crude oil from the southwest of France and a gas oil free
from volatile substances after being equilibrated with atmosphere. Two commercial
dispersants were used: British Petroleum Enersperse 1037 and Basic Fresh water.
The response of marine macrophytes on oil dispersion is dependent on the type
of both oil and oil dispersant [25]. Germination inhibition of the marine macrophyte
Phyllospora comosa was used to assess and compare the effects of oil dispersants
and dispersed diesel fuel and crude oil combinations. The inhibition of germination
by the water-soluble fraction of diesel fuel increased after adding all dispersants
investigated. This contrasted with crude oil, in which the addition of some dispersants
resulted in an enhanced germination rate.
19.1.6 IMPLEMENTATION APPLICATION PROGRAMS
Guidelines
Ideally, the consideration of the use of a dispersant use should take place before an
emergency to reach a timely decision [26]. Several states and regional response teams
have active programs that address the planning and technical and environmental
considerations affecting dispersant use. In several states where the use of dispersants
is an emerging issue, there appears to be a willingness to consider their use on a case￾by-case basis and a genuine interest in learning more about their effectiveness and
toxicity.866 CHAPTER 19 Oil spill treating agents
A decision concerning the use of a certain dispersant involves several compo￾nents, including considerations of operational feasibility and regulatory policy and
environmental concerns. Eleven examples of major published procedures for making
oil spill-response decisions, including decisions for or against the use of chemical
dispersants, have been summarized and compared in a study [27].
Several guidelines have been given for the use of oil spill dispersants, among
them, ASTM guidelines for use [28–34]. The guidelines include a variety of
environments such as fresh water ponds, lakes, and streams, as well as land. The
laboratory tests to measure the effectiveness of the dispersant that are specified in
federal regulations are not easy to perform, nor inexpensive, and generate a large
quantity of oily waste water.
Computerized model
A computerized model has been developed for planning and implementing an
effective dispersant application program [35]. The model makes it possible to conduct
rapid assessment of specific oil-dispersant relationships, oil slick configurations,
equipment types, and staging locations, as well as a broad range of dosages
achievable within realistic operating constraints. Such constraints are provided for
vessel, helicopter, and fixed-wing application systems. For a given spill scenario, the
user can determine the amount of dispersant needed, the number of sorties required,
the area and potential volume of oil treated per sortie, and the time required to treat a
specified percentage of the slick.
19.1.7 TESTS
Wave basin
Many sea trials of dispersant chemicals to demonstrate the effectiveness of specific
products or to elucidate the processes of oil dispersion into the water column have
been described. Most tests have been proved to be inconclusive, leading many to
believe that dispersant chemicals are only marginally effective. Tests in a wave basin
have been conducted to measure the effectiveness of the dispersant under closely
controlled conditions [36].
These tests show that dispersed oil plumes may be irregular and concentrated
over small volumes, so extensive plume sampling was required to obtain accurate
measurements. In large-scale sea trials, dispersants have been shown effective,
but only when sufficient sampling of the water column was done to detect small
concentrated dispersed oil plumes and when it was known that the dispersant was
applied primarily to the thick floating oil.
Broken ice
Experiments have been conducted in a wave basin to determine the effectiveness
of dispersants in breaking up oil spilled onto a mixture of broken ice and water.
Forty-liter portions of a light crude oil were spilled into containment booms that had
been frozen into the ice of a salt water-filled wave tank [37]. The spills were treated19.1 History 867
with either Corexit® 9527 or Corexit® 9500, and then low-amplitude waves were
generated for 2 h. In a short time, the spills were dispersed by 90% or better.
The oil-in-water dispersion was monitored by fluorometry, by video and still
photography, and by measuring the oil remaining on the water and ice surface after
the experiment. The size distribution of the ice floes had little effect on the amount of
dispersion. The dispersion of oil spilled into a single straight lead in the ice sheet was
also studied. It was found that oil spilled into a lead filled with slush ice and treated
with dispersant rapidly dispersed into the water column.
Finite difference models
Finite difference models to simulate the diffusion and advection of oil in water have
been developed and tested in wave basins [38].
Small scale testing
There are various testing procedures, such as the Warren Spring Rotating Flask test
(WSL test, Labofina test), Institute Francais du Petrole flow test (IFP test), Mackay￾Nadeau-Steelman test (MNS test), EXDET, and other procedures.
Water extraction process
The traditional method of measuring the effectiveness of the dispersant under labo￾ratory conditions is to take a small aliquot of the dispersion test water, extract the oil,
usually with methylene chloride, and then measure the color at a specific wavelength.
This value is compared with a standard curve from which the effectiveness can be
calculated. An error was found in the traditional approach of preparing standard
curves because adding water to the extraction process produced some coloration in
the methylene chloride [39].
Light oils have a low absorbance at the typical wavelengths chosen and tests were
found to be erroneous by as much as 300% when traditional methods of analysis
were used. More typical medium oils showed errors of only a few percent, but again
heavy oils showed significant error because of the different wavelengths at which
they absorb. Several methods of compensating for this effect were tried and found to
be inadequate. Gas chromatography is suggested to analyze the effectiveness of the
dispersant in the laboratory.
Rotating flask test and variants
Laboratory tests of the effectiveness of oil spill dispersants are used around the world
to select dispersants for application to specific oils. The two most widely used tests
are the Mackay test, otherwise known as the Mackay-Nadeau-Steelman test, and the
Labofina test, otherwise known as the Warren Springs or rotating flask test. The
Mackay test uses a high-velocity air stream to energize 6 liters of water, whereas
the Labofina test uses rotation of a separatory funnel with 250 ml of water. Both tests
apply a large amount of energy to the oil-water system.
Two lesser-known devices are the oscillating hoop and the swirling flask [40].
The oscillating hoop apparatus uses a hoop moved up and down at the water surface.868 CHAPTER 19 Oil spill treating agents
The concentric waves serve to energize the oil in the hoop and to contain it. Thirty￾five liters of water are used in this test. The swirling flask test makes use of a
125 ml Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is rotated using a standard chemical/biologic
shaker to swirl the contents. Results show that all high energy tests (the Mackay, the
Labofina, and the oscillating hoop) produce unique dispersant effectiveness results
that correlate poorly with the physical properties of the oil.
EXDET test
The dispersant effectiveness test, named EXDET, was developed to address concerns
associated with available laboratory dispersant effectiveness test procedures [41].
The EXDET procedure uses standard laboratory equipment (such as a Burrell Wrist￾Action shaker) and small volumes of water, oil, and chemical dispersant. Other
features include the capabilities to mass balance the dispersed and nondispersed oil
and to generate replicate data for statistical analysis.
Portable equipment
Chemical shoreline cleaning agents enhance the removal of stranded oil from
shoreline surfaces, but site-specific variables, physical and chemical properties of
oil, and variations in substrate types influence the performance of shoreline cleaning
agents. It is difficult to predict the performance for site-specific variables. Therefore
on-site testing of shoreline cleaning agents with oil and local substrates is needed.
A portable field kit used to estimate quantitative and qualitative information for
cleaning performance and dispersion of oil with shoreline cleaning agents has been
described in the literature [42]. The methodology was tested with three substrate
types for field use of shoreline cleaning agents (gravel, rip-rap, and eelgrass), two oils
(Bunker C and Bonny Light), and two shoreline cleaning agents (Corexit® 9580 and
PES-51). The results for cleaning performance and oil dispersion exhibit sufficient
reproducibility to allow statistically significant differences to be identified in tests
with and without shoreline cleaning agents or between shoreline cleaning agents.
Comparison of effectiveness tests
Three laboratory methods were compared: the revised standard dispersant effective￾ness test used and required for regulation in the United States, the swirling flask test
and the IFP-dilution test [43]. Six test oils and three dispersants were evaluated. It
was concluded that the three tests gave similar precision results, but that the swirling
flask test was fastest, cheapest, simplest, and required the least operator skill.
Correlations among the different test methods
Comparative studies revealed that the test results from different apparatus are not
highly correlated, and often the effectiveness rank is not correlated [44]. The
effect of the settling time and oil/water ratio are important in determining the final
effectiveness value. Energy is important only to the extent that, when high energy is
applied to an oil-dispersant system, dispersion is increased by an amount related to
the oil’s natural dispersibility.19.1 History 869
A study on the efficiency of dispersants with various testing methods showed
that some tests for the same oil dispersant system produced no correlation [45]. In
another study, seven laboratory methods for testing dispersant effectiveness using
commercial oil spill products and No. 2 and No. 6 fuel oils were evaluated [46].
The tests included the Environmental Protection Agency, Mackay, Russian, French,
Warren Spring, and two IFT test methods (one based on the du Nouy ring principle
and the other on drop weight).
These tests were reviewed in terms of type, scale, method of applying mixing
energy, and the time required to conduct a product evaluation. The experimental
results, compared in terms of test data precision and how effective the six non-ionic
dispersants were, demonstrate that the relative effectiveness found for the dispersants
varies appreciably as a function of the testing method.
Effectiveness tests of dispersants have been performed according to two different
methods [47]:
1. the WSL test and
2. the IFP test.
The WSL test is a rotating flask test and the IFP test is a lower-energy test,
with dilution by clean sea water. The results show mainly that there is no evident
correlation between the methods, which may be because of their completely different
designs. Another result is that the IFP test is much more selective than the WSL test.
It can be concluded that the nature of the oil is as important as the design of the
method. As a global conclusion, dispersants should be tested in different conditions
because their effectiveness varies significantly in function of the test design and the
test oil.
Effectiveness of chemical dispersants under real conditions
It is believed that the effectiveness of dispersants is influenced by a number of factors,
including the chemical natures of the dispersant and the nature of the oil, their relative
amounts, and the microscopic mixing processes occurring as the dispersant lands on
the oil and penetrates it while subject to turbulence originating in the air and water
[48]. In addition, the oil to be treated can also partly evaporate, form mousses, and
spread into thick and sheen patches.
There is no doubt that effective dispersion takes place in laboratory conditions
and under certain application conditions at sea. However, it is apparent that at sea,
the effectiveness is often reduced by one or more factors:
• underdosing and overdosing of the slick because of its variable thickness,
• underestimation of the effect of weathering, and
• the character of the energy available at the sea surface.
Special aspects
Arctic conditions
The effectiveness of relevant dispersants for use under arctic conditions has been
tested with a dilution test [49,50]. Arctic conditions mean a low temperature of870 CHAPTER 19 Oil spill treating agents
0 ◦C and water salinities of 0.5-3.3%. The results showed that many dispersants
that previously showed excellent effectiveness at high salinity (3.3%) may have low
effectiveness at low-salinity conditions (0.5%). The study emphasizes the need for
development of dispersants with a high effectiveness both at low temperature and
over a wide range of salinities.
Effectiveness in salt solutions
Effectiveness in calcium and magnesium salt solutions is different from that in
sodium salt solutions [51]. In general, the effectiveness is lower at zero salinity.
Effectiveness testing
Initially, it was emphasized that oil spill treating agents can be divided into four
classes: solidifiers, demulsifying agents, surface-washing agents, and dispersants.
Solidifiers, or gelling agents, solidify oil, requiring a large amount of agent to
solidify oil, ranging from 16% to more than 200%. Emulsion breakers prevent or
reverse the formation of water-in-oil emulsions.
The effectiveness of a dispersant can be defined as the percentage of oil
in the water column. Emulsion breakers have been tested for their performance
[52,53]. Among the tested products, only one highly effective formulation has been
determined. However, the conclusion is not too discouraging. Many products will
work but require large amounts of spill treating agent.
Testing has shown that an agent that is a good dispersant is, conversely, a poor
surface-washing agent, and vice versa. Tests of surface-washing agents show that
only a few agents have effectiveness of 25-40%, in which this effectiveness is the
percentage of heavy oil removed from a test surface. The aquatic toxicity of these
agents is an important factor and has been measured for many products [54].
Results using the swirling flask test for dispersant effectiveness have been
reported. Heavy oils show effectiveness values of approximately 1%, medium crude
oils of approximately 10%, light crude oils of approximately 30%, and very light oils
of approximately 90%.
The effectiveness of a number of crude oil dispersants, measured using a variety
of evaluation procedures, indicates that temperature effects result from changing
viscosity, dispersants are most effective at a salinity of approximately 40 ppt (parts
per thousand), and concentration of dispersant is critical to effectiveness.
The mixing time has little effect on performance, and a calibration procedure
for laboratory dispersant effectiveness must include contact with water in a manner
analogous to the extraction procedure. Otherwise, the effectiveness may be inflated
[55]. Compensation for the coloration produced by the dispersant alone is important
only for some dispersants.
Natural dispersion
In a study on the relationship of dispersant effectiveness with the factors of dispersant
amount and mixing energy, the energy was varied by changing the rotational speed of
a specially designed apparatus [56]. The effectiveness goes up linearly with energy,
expressed as flask rotational speed. The natural dispersion shows a behavior similar19.1 History 871
to the chemical dispersion, except the thresholds occur at a higher energy and the
effectiveness rises more slowly with increasing energy.
The effect of the amount of dispersant is the same with both low and high en￾ergies. The effectiveness increases exponentially with increasing dispersant amount.
Although a trade-off exists between dispersant amount and energy required to achieve
high effectiveness values, energy is considered to be the more important factor.
Each oil-dispersant combination shows a unique threshold or onset of dispersion
[57]. A statistic analysis showed that the principal factors involved are the oil
composition, dispersant formulation, sea surface turbulence, and dispersant quantity
[58]. The composition of the oil is very important. The effectiveness of the dispersant
formulation correlates strongly with the amount of the saturate components in the
oil. The other components of the oil, i.e., asphaltenes, resins, or polar substances and
aromatic fractions show a negative correlation with the dispersant effectiveness.
The viscosity of the oil is determined by the composition of the oil. Therefore
viscosity and composition are responsible for the effectiveness of a dispersant.
The dispersant composition is significant and interacts with the oil composition.
Sea turbulence strongly affects dispersant effectiveness. The effectiveness rises
with increasing turbulence to a maximal value. The effectiveness for commercial
dispersants is a Gaussian distribution around a certain salinity value.
The effect of water temperature variation is logarithmically correlated with
dispersant effectiveness [59]. Dispersant/oil ratios greater than approximately 1:40
result in a low dispersant effectiveness. Dispersion experiments were conducted to
investigate the effects of oil composition. The effectiveness is positively and strongly
correlated with the saturate concentration in the oil and is negatively correlated
with the contents of aromatic, asphaltene, and polar compounds in the oil. The
effectiveness is weakly correlated with the viscosity of the oil. The dispersant
effectiveness is limited primarily by the oil composition.
Studies have been conducted concerning the variances among several standard
regulatory tests. Three main causes of differences have been identified: oil/water
ratio, settling time, and energy [60]. The energy can be partially compensated for tests
with high energy by correcting for the natural dispersion. With this correction and
with high oil/water ratios and a settling time of at least 10 min, five test methods yield
similar results for a variety of oils and dispersants. The repeatability of energy levels
used in the instrumentation is largely responsible for the variation in the effectiveness
values of the dispersant.
Analysis of Corexit 9527
Corexit® 9527 in natural waters can be analyzed. The method is based on the
formation of a bis-(ethylene diamine) copper(II) complex, extraction of the complex
into methylisobutylketone, and atomic absorption spectroscopy [61]. The method is
suitable for a concentration range of 2-100 mg l−1, with a precision as low as 5%
relative to standard deviation for samples in the middle to high range. Only a small
sample volume (10 ml) is required. The sensitivity may be substantially increased for
trace analysis by increasing the sample volume.872 CHAPTER 19 Oil spill treating agents
19.1.8 SUBSURFACE, SOIL, AND GROUND WATER
Subsurface contamination by organic chemicals is a widespread and serious problem,
restricted not only to oil spills, but also pertinent in former and still-operating
industrial sites. Remarkably, chemical-enhanced oil recovery technology can be
used to remove oily contaminants from soil, c.f., Chapter 16.17, p. 710 for further
explanation.
19.1.9 IN SITU CHEMICAL OXIDATION
Chlorinated solvents, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and other organics can be resistant
to in situ biodegradation or may take exceedingly long periods of time to degrade in
many subsurface settings.
Field experiences have demonstrated that the successful application of in situ
chemical oxidation requires the consideration of several factors through an integrated
evaluation and design practice. Matching the oxidant and in situ delivery system
to the contaminants of concern and the site conditions is the key to successful
implementation of such techniques [62].
19.1.10 GROUND WATER
Ground water contaminant plumes from accidental gasoline releases often contain
methyl tert-butyl ether. Experiments with certain soil microorganisms showed that a
culture able to degrade methyl tert-butyl ether did not degrade benzene and toluene.
Further interactions were observed[63].
19.1.11 CHEMICALS IN DETAIL
Oxyethylated alkyl Phenol
A solution of a surfactant mixture in liquid paraffin, containing oil soluble oxyethy￾lated alkyl phenol, having the formula with an C8–C12 alkyl rest, the alkyl phosphate
of a higher fatty acid alcohol (RO)2>PO−OH where R is C10 to C20, and a fatty
acid amide of diethanolamine, are suitable for removing oils and petroleum products
from water surfaces [64]. The composition has low toxicity, is not inactivated by
freezing, and has high biologic activity, stimulating the growth of microflora and
giving 80-83% dispersion in 5 min.
Sorbitan oleates for oil slicks
Dispersant compositions for the treatment of oil spills at the surface of the water
consist of a mixture of water, a hydrocarbon solvent, and a mixture of surfactants
consisting of 55-65% of emulsifiers and 35-45% of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate.
The emulsifying agents consist of a mixture of various sorbitan oleates [65–68].19.1 History 873
Fatty alcohols
Petroleum spillages can be removed from water surfaces more efficiently with the
following detergent mixture, which contains mainly oxyethylate fatty C10 to C20
alcohols and additional oxyethylated fatty C11 to C17 acids with an oxyethylene chain
length of one to two units [69]. It is used in the form of an aqueous 20-25% emulsion,
which is sprayed onto a contaminated surface.
Proteins
A proteinaceous particulate material has been described that is effective as an oil spill
dispersant composition [70]. The material is a grain product, such as oats, from which
lipids are removed through organic solvent extraction. When such compositions are
applied to an oil spill, they will adsorb oil, emulsify it, and finally, disperse it.
Moreover, the compositions are substantially nontoxic.
Polymer
Functionalized copolymers from dienes and p-alkylstyrenes can serve as dispersants
and viscosity index improvers. The functionalities are introduced via the aromatic
units [71,72]. The polymers are selectively hydrogenated to produce polymers
that have highly controlled amounts of unsaturation, permitting a highly selective
functionalization. The dispersant substances may also include a carrier fluid to
provide concentrates of the dispersant.
Cyclic monoterpenes
The recovery of sludging oil crudes from hydrocarbon-bearing formations during
acid stimulation treatments can be enhanced using an antisludging agent that is
basically a dispersant. Such an antisludging agent consists of an admixture of
dicyclopentadiene and a mixture of naturally occurring cyclic monoterpenes isolated
from Pinus species [73,74]. The agent is added to the acid used for well stimulation
treatment. Another dispersing agent active under these conditions is ethoxylated alkyl
phenol dissolved in a mixture of ethylene glycol, methanol, and water [75–77].
Special chemicals for oiled shorelines
The use of chemical dispersant for oiled shorelines is one of the most controversial,
complex, and time-critical issues facing officials responsible for making decisions
about the response methods used on coastal oil spills [78].
In general, the cleanup of oiled shorelines has been by mechanical, labor-intensive
means. The use of surfactants to deterge and lift the oil from the surface results in
more complete and rapid cleaning. Not only is the cleaning process more efficient,
but it can also be less environmentally damaging because potentially less human
intrusion and stress on the biologic community occurs and because the chemicals
can make the washing more effective at a lower temperature.
Chemical beach cleaners can facilitate the cleanup of oiled shorelines by im￾proving the efficiency of washing with water. A dispersant has been improved by
reducing the adhesion of the oil coating, which makes it easier to remove from874 CHAPTER 19 Oil spill treating agents
shoreline surfaces, thereby reducing washing time and lowering the temperature of
the wash water needed to clean a given area [79]. These experiences resulted in the
development of Corexit® 9580 [80,81].
Corexit® 9580 consists of two surfactants and a solvent. It exhibits low fish
toxicity, low dispersiveness, and effective rock cleaning capability. Experiments on
mangroves to explore the potential use of Corexit® 9580 to save and restore an oiled
vegetation have been considered.
Such a dispersant formulation for dispersing oil contains a mixture of a sorbitan
monoester of an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid, a poly(oxyethylene) adduct of a
sorbitan monoester of an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid, a water-dispersible salt
of a dialkyl sulfosuccinate, a poly(oxyethylene) adduct of a sorbitan triester or a
sorbital hexaester of an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid, and a propylene glycol ether
as solvent [82,83].
Coagulants
Linseed oil, fatty acids, alkenes, and poly(isobutylmethacrylate), are treated in a
thermal process to prepare an oil coagulant. The oil coagulant composition floats on
the water surface and coagulates oil independent of both agitation and temperature
and can be used in both salt water and fresh water. After the coagulant has coagulated,
the spilled oil, at least 99.9% of the floating coagulated oil can be readily removed
from the water by mechanical methods.

20 Waste disposal
There are monographs about environmental technologies in the oil industry [1].
Cumulative data of chemicals disposed have been compiled [2,3]. These data are
shown in Table 20.1. Subsequently some examples of solutions for waste disposal in
the oilfield industry are presented.
There are specific situations of the problems of waste disposal. In Kuwait
the problem of hydrocarbon waste management is complex. Namely, the country
experienced a unique environmental catastrophe as oil lakes have been formed during
the 1991 Gulf War [4].
20.1 PRODUCED WATER
When produced water from offshore production is discharged into the sea, it
contains some oil, both aliphatic and aromatic components, production chemicals,
and naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM)s [5].
These groups of materials are traditionally treated in different ways in the
regulations and standards. Regulations of oil in produced water are mainly related
to the maximum concentrations and the total discharge of the aliphatic fraction. The
regulation of chemicals is based on the environmental risk profile of each production
chemical, although efforts are made toward regulations based on risk assessment of
the discharge of the mixture of substances.
For the discharge of NORM in the produced water, no limit values are imposed.
For NORM solids from process equipment, the discharge into the sea is in general
not allowed. It has to be reinjected or taken to a deposit onshore [5].
The management of safety risks takes place on the basis of the principle that
risks shall be reduced to a level as low as reasonably practicable. The concept of
environmental risk is not as unambiguously defined as safety risks. With respect
to accidental environmental impacts, the parallel is relatively straightforward, but
with respect to planned environmental impacts, e.g., emissions and discharges during
operation, the parallel to the safety level is not so clear. The consequence is not linked
to a certain frequency.
Produced-water reinjection might cause increased CO2 emissions. Handling solid
NORM during shipping to shore causes health risks to the people handling the
NORM [5].

20.1.1 GAS WELL PRODUCTION WASTE WATERS
A process for the treatment of hydrofracture waste waters has been presented [6].
The method is suitable for either direct reuse or for reuse following addition of low
dissolved solids water.
A metal-containing waste water is contacted with metal sulfates and precipitating
metal compounds from the waste water. The initially treated waste water can then be
contacted with a source of carbonate ions and the method can comprise precipitating
one or more metal carbonates or hydroxides from the treated waste water after contact
with the source of carbonate ions. The method can further remove the precipitated
metal carbonates and metal hydroxides from the mixture [6].20.2 Drilling fluids 883
After the metal-containing waste water is contacted with a source of sulfate ions,
the resulting waste water can be contacted with an anionic polymer to flocculate the
metal sulfates. The flocculated metal sulfates can then be removed from the waste
water.
Also filtering or precipitated metal salts out of a waste water is possible by using a
filter press. After the metal compounds are removed from the waste water, the waste
water can be recycled.
The waste water brine can still contain sodium chloride and calcium chloride. The
brine can be evaporated in an evaporator to form water and an evaporation product.
The evaporation product can be filtered to form a retentate comprising crystalline
sodium chloride, and a filtrate comprising the liquor. The retentate can be washed
with saturated sodium chloride brine. The washed retentate can be dried [6].
20.2 DRILLING FLUIDS
The shale inhibition properties of polyol-containing water-based drilling mud
(WBM) can be enhanced by the incorporation of potassium salts, e.g., potassium
chloride, possibly in combination with gypsum. However, the shale inhibition
properties of even the best known potassium and polyol-containing WBM are much
inferior to those of oil-based drilling mud (OBM).
Further, the use of potassium can present waste disposal problems, as there
are certain regions, e.g., in The Gulf of Mexico, where the discharge of potas￾sium to the environment is prohibited or severely restricted. In addition, the use
of potassium-containing WBM can present problems in land drilling where the
contamination of ground water by potassium-containing drilling waste is considered
as unacceptable [7].
20.2.1 BIOREMEDIATION
The remediation of drilling mud-polluted sites is of high importance for the oil
industry. Exemplary, in the Southeast of Mexico, field trials were undertaken, in order
to find a technology to remediate such sites.
A field trial was performed by composting polluted material in biopiles, in a size
of one ton. To these piles, some nutrients were added to establish a certain ratio of
carbon to nitrogen and phosphor, as well as straw. In addition a control pile was run
and monitored. In contrast to the control pile, after a period of 180 d the concentration
of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) decreased to a much higher extent for the
amende piles [8].
Gas chromatographic studies indicated the occurrence of alkyl dibenzothio￾phenes. The highest bacterial populations were observed during the first 30 d. These
correlated with highest rate TPH removal, whereas the number of fungi increased
rather at the end of the experiment [8].884 CHAPTER 20 Waste disposal
20.2.2 ASSESSMENT OF BIODEGRADABILITY
There are many standard tests for assessing the biodegradability. The test conditions
how biodegradation is actually measured are varying. Biodegradability may be
expressed in terms of [9]:
• carbon dioxide evolution,
• oxygen consumption, or
• loss of parent material.
Test methods for assessing the biodegradability of environmentally acceptable
lubricants have been critically reviewed and discussed. Examples are given, how
confusion can arise using different test methods.
It is recommended that the term biodegradable for an environmentally acceptable
lubricant should be used, when the amount of net CO2 production 28 days, testing
according to the OECD test Guideline 301 B, CO2 evolution test, is at least 60% of
the theoretical maximum [9].
The CEC L-33-T-82 biodegradability test is a widely recommended method for
assessing the biodegradabilities of oil products [10]. The CEC L-33-T-82 test (more
recently addressed as CEC L-33-A-934) applies to most organic compounds. This
test determines the overall biodegradability of hydrocarbons.
The ASTM D-5864 standard [11] is similar to a modified Sturm test [12].
This test method measures the degree of aerobic aquatic biodegradation of fully
formulated lubricants or their components on exposure to an inoculum under
laboratory conditions.
It has been shown that there is a good positive relationship between
biodegradation in the CEC L-33-T-82 standard and the mineralization to CO2
in a modified Sturm test. A mathematical model is suitable to describe these
correlations [13].
20.2.3 SUPERCRITICAL FLUID EXTRACTION
The of use OBM requires costly handling, treatment and disposal. There are a number
of options available to treat and dispose of OBM drilling wastes, including land
spreading and landfilling [14].
As a technology that can be traced back to 1984, supercritical fluid extraction
has been used to treat this waste [15]. Supercritical fluid extraction is an extraction
technique that uses substances at or above their critical pressure and temperature as
solvents.
Supercritical carbon dioxide is capable of removing the base oil from drilling
waste. The extraction efficiencies are as high as 98%. The hydrocarbons are un￾changed by the extraction, further they may be recovered and potentially reused [14].20.3 Cuttings 885
20.3 CUTTINGS
The contaminants present in drill cuttings depend both on the nature of the drilling
mud and on the composition of the formation. Contaminants include petroleum
hydrocarbons and heavy metals. OBMs are more harmful to the environment than
synthetic drilling muds. However, the biodegradation properties of synthetic drilling
muds are quite similar to those of OBMs [16]. Drill cuttings can be disposed by
several methods, including slurry reinjection, thermal desorption, incineration, or
microwave treatment [17,18].
20.3.1 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
Methods for monitoring the impact of drill cuttings that are contaminated with
OBMs in marine environments have been developed. These methods are based
on the analysis of benthic fauna, on chemical analysis of the sediments, or on
ecotoxicological tests on the marine macrofauna [19]. Benthos is the summary of
living organisms living at the sea floor.
The pollution by oily drill cuttings may have various impacts on the marine
environment, in particular the benthic fauna [19]:
• degradation of the oil in the benthic environment, with an increased availability
of organic compounds,
• increase of the oxygen demand in the sediment, which can result in strongly
hypoxic, or even anoxic conditions, and
• in the presence of sulfides, the combination of various stress factors may
ultimately cause a total disappearance of the benthic fauna.
It has been found that benthic foraminifera are suitable bioindicators of the an￾thropogenic enrichment in open marine regions [20]. In particular, the foraminiferal
fauna responds by a density increase of a number of tolerant or opportunistic taxa,
and a progressive disappearance of more sensitive taxa. Large-sized taxa appear to
be more sensitive than small-sized foraminiferal taxa [19].
Most of the cuttings discharged from well drilling contain WBMs, rather than
oil-based or synthetic muds. Drill cuttings with WBMs are assumed to cause
only marginal effects on the benthos, mainly resulting from sedimentation. How￾ever, an experimental study revealed a significant reduction in number of taxa,
abundance, biomass and diversity of macrofauna with increasing thickness of drill
cuttings deposited. This phenomenon was not observed for the natural sediment
particles [21].
Therefore it is recommended to reconsider the opinion that water-based drill
cuttings only cause sedimentation, i.e., burial effects, as the cuttings initiate a typical
eutrophication response in the sediment [21].
The exploration and production of North Sea oil and gas reserves has caused
the accumulation of large quantities of drill cuttings on the seabed surrounding drill886 CHAPTER 20 Waste disposal
sites. This complex mixture contains higher concentrations of certain metals and
hydrocarbons than are found in the natural sediments [22].
It is agreed that hydrocarbons within the cuttings piles remain relatively un￾changed with time. A considerable proportion of the associated contaminants are
likely to remain within the cuttings pile unless they are disturbed. This increases the
tendency to exchange of porewater and solids back to the seabed surface resulting in
the possibility of exposure for organisms [22].
20.3.2 MODELING THE DISCHARGE
Models are available that allow the prediction of the potential environmental impact
caused by the discharge drilling fluid components. These are based on estimates of
the initial spatial extent and thickness of accumulations on the seabed. These models
are a valuable tool for both the oil industry and regulatory agencies [23].
Among the most widely used models is the Offshore Operators Committee (OOC)
Mud and Produced Water Discharge Model [24]. The use of the OOC model allows
to estimate the effect of discharges into the sea, i.e., of drilling fluids and cuttings, and
also of produced water. Later, an automated validation system based on this model
has been developed [25]. This system is claimed to be highly comfortable. After
setting up the validation system, only little additional work is needed for repeated
validations to test the model, even after changes with respect to maintenance and
development. The validation system provides a complete record of all validation
methods, data, and results.
In a case study, the OOC model was used for modelling discharges in a
deepwater environment, from a well located offshore off Brazil. The discharge data
were collected during the drilling and discharge activities. These data enabled the
researchers to carry out a study based on real data, i.e., hindcast modelling [23].
A comparison the results obtained by modelling with real field observations
showed satisfactory results. However, it turned out that the prediction of the affected
area is more difficult, because the results are sensitive to small uncertainties, which
are mainly attributed to the discharge activities. Nevertheless, in areas where a certain
knowledge of the hydrodynamics exists, the OOC model can be a valuable tool to
determine the degree of potential impact associated with drilling activities [23].
Heavy metals
The effects of heavy metals emanating from oil waste disposal on surrounding soil in
Jilin Province, China, were investigated [26]. A potential ecological risk index was
used to evaluate the damage of heavy metals.
Cu, Cr, and Zn were determined with a flame atomic absorption spectrophotome￾ter; Pb, Ni, and Cd were determined with a graphite furnace spectrophotometer; and
Hg was determined with a Lumex RA-915+ mercury vapor meter. The content of
heavy metals found in soil is summarized in Table 20.2.20.3 Cuttings 887
Table 20.2 Content of
Heavy Metals Found in
Soil [26]
Metal Content (mg kg−1)
Cu 4.12-15.42
Cr 7.47-98.60
Zn 38.92-68.85
Pb 8.31-30.73
Cd 0.02-0.14
Ni 9.07-20.09
Hg 0.015-0.094
It was concluded that the degree of potential ecological damage of heavy metals
can be ranked as follows: Hg > Cd > Pb > Cu > Ni > Cr > Zn.
The average value of the potential ecological harm index is 71.93, thereby
indicating light pollution. In addition, the spatial distribution of soil heavy metals
by means of the geographic information system spatial analysis software was
investigated. The results showed that the potential ecological risk index of the large
value was close to the distance from the oil waste disposal area. It is relatively
between the degree of heavy metals in soil and the distance from the waste disposal
area [26].
Fuzzy logics
A hierarchical model has been developed and evaluated to assess the aggregative
environmental risk for various drilling waste discharge scenarios. These wastes are
disposed into the marine environment. A qualitative assessment technique has been
used that incorporates the fuzzy set theory [27]. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has
been performed in order to verify the effect of weighting schemes on the assessment
of a final aggregative risk.
Weights to express the risk have been estimated through an analytical hierarchy
process from priority vectors. These include at the upper levels the ecological risk
and the human health risk, which levels are further detailed at level two in health
toxicological effects and safety related health dangers, and down to some more level
three classes [27]. These data are used in a rather complicated procedure to estimate
the final risk.
The methodology lined out above applied to evaluate various scenarios of drilling
waste discharge in the marine environment. Three discharge scenarios were selected
with various amounts of synthetic mud attached to dry drill cuttings. Sensitivity
analysis showed that the aggregative environmental risks are not sensitive to the
weighting schemes, rather to the selection of the grade of risk and to grade of
importance.888 CHAPTER 20 Waste disposal
20.3.3 MICROWAVE TREATMENT
Applications of microwaves find increasingly use in oilfield technologies, at least
tested in the laboratory scale [28]. Of particular interest are applications of mi￾crowaves for bitumen extraction, upgrading of heavy oils, and removing heteroatoms.
In addition, underground heating of oil sands to reduce bitumen viscosity is possible,
which allows such materials to be pumped to the surface. Microwave energy
provides a fundamentally different method of transferring energy from the source
to the sample. By directly delivering energy to microwave-absorbing materials,
conventional issues such as long heating periods and energy losses can be minimized.
In North America, the only allowed frequencies for industrial use are 915, 2450,
5800, and 22,000 MHz. For laboratory uses, the frequency of 2450 MHz is preferred,
since this frequency has an adequate penetration depth for most laboratory reaction
conditions.
Already in 1983, a patent was launched that describes the recovery of shale
oil, heavy oil using microwaves for heating [29]. These ideas are still an inventive
object [30]. Even when microwave energy has been shown to be effective in some
applications it is not used commercially at the present time (2010) [28].
Oil-contaminated drill cuttings can be treated with microwaves. In contrast to
conventional heating, the microwave energy is delivered directly to materials through
molecular interactions with the electromagnetic field.
It was found that in favorite operating conditions the oil levels can be reduced
below 1%. Laboratory experiments revealed that 20 s of microwave treatment
is sufficient to reduce the residual oil levels below 1%. A major drawback for
the efficiency of this method is the moisture content. In contrast, by increasing the
amount of water in the samples can potentially overcome such limitations [17]. The
effectiveness of microwaves for heating of a variety of materials are summarized in
Table 20.3.
The penetration depth Dp is defined as the depth at which the intensity of the
electric field drops to e−1 of its value at the surface. The penetration depth is
approximately

Heating was done with 2.45 GHz at 10 kW cavity power and 22 s irradiation time.
The effect of moisture content on residual oil levels at microwave heating is shown in
Figure 20.1. The energy consumption using various methods of stripping the organic
material is shown in Figure 20.2.
Based on previous research, mentioned above, the authors have developed a
continuous microwave treatment system for the remediation of contaminated drill
cuttings on a semi technical scale [31]. A system capable of treating 500 kg h−1
has been set up. Thereby, it has been demonstrated that the environmental discharge
threshold of 1% oil can be achieved in a continuous operation. Moreover, the
sensitivity of this pilot plant towards changes in the feedstock has been investigated.
The system must process both slurries and granular solids. It has been found
that when moisture content deviates from its nominal value of 6%, the system
performance becomes lower, as the power density ratio decreases.
20.3.4 DISCHARGE IN CEMENT
A cost effective and reliable technique for the immobilization of large amounts
of drill cuttings is the inclusion into lime, pozzolanas, Portland or slag cement.
Unfortunately, chloride ions affect the setting of the cement as these ions act as

retarders for setting. Moreover the mechanical strength is reduced. For this reason,
the disposal sodium chloride containing drill cutting wastes in the way sketched
above is still problematic.
However, the addition of orthophosphate seems to form a continuous and weakly
soluble network in the cement matrix, which reduces the release of the salt. Actually,
apatite and hydrocalumite are formed. These phases encapsulate the salt grains within
a network, thus lowering its interaction with water or trap the chloride [32]. Chloride
trapping into hydrocalumite in ordinary Portland cement has been reported [33]. At
high pH, hydrocalumite precipitates according to
2Ca(OH)2 + Al(OH)−
4 + Cl− + 2H+ → Ca2(OH)6Cl × 3 H2O. (20.2)
By leaching experiments at cement matrixes, where oil-based cuttings were
embedded, it has been shown that the treatment of the cuttings with potassium
phosphate strongly decreases the amount of dissolved salt from 41.3 to 19.1%. In
contrast, aluminium phosphate is more efficient for the stabilization of water-based
cuttings [32].
Methods of treating synthetic drill cuttings intended to landfills or for potential
reuse as construction products have been screened [34]. Two synthetic mixes were
used based on average concentrations of specific contaminates present in typical drill
cuttings from the North Sea and the Red Sea areas. The two synthetic drill cuttings
contained similar chloride content of 2.03% and 2.13% but different hydrocarbon20.3 Cuttings 891
content of 4.20% and 10.95%, respectively. Hence the mixes were denoted as low
and high oil content mixes, respectively.
A number of conventional binders for stabilization and solidification have been
tested, including Portland cement, lime, and blast furnace slag. In addition some
novel binders, such as microsilica and magnesium oxide cement have been screened.
Despite of differences in the hydrocarbon content in the synthetic cuttings under
investigation, the measured mechanical properties of the samples with the same
binder type and content were similar.
Moreover, experiments of the leachability of the samples showed a reduction of
the amount leached into a stable non-reactive hazardous waste. Leaching tests are
standardized by an European standard [35], however, there are still other similar tests
that do the job [34].
Experiments of the leachability of paraffins revealed that among several binders,
lime-Portland cement binders showed the best performance. Even 10% of binder
reduced the leachability in comparison to untreated drill cuttings by more than
85% [34].
20.3.5 FILLERS IN BITUMEN
In offshore activities drill cuttings, after being separated from other components
of the drilling mud, have been deposited in the vicinity of the platforms before
2000. However, growing environmental concerns resulted in a prohibitive legisla￾tion [36,37].
Due to these legislation, as the cuttings must be transported to the shore, a new
waste stream was generated. For example, in the UK, 40 kt a−1 of drilling cuts have
to be transported to the continent. For this reason, technologies for waste disposal of
this kind of wastes had to be developed.
Oil-drill cuttings as such contain typically 50% of OBM. The hydrocarbon
content of these materials must be reduced to less than 1% before being discharged to
landfill sites. Cleaned oil-drill cuttings, have a potential to be used as filler materials,
in particular for bituminous mixtures. A study has been presented in that certain
issues of the usability of these wastes have been elucidated has [38].
Several samples, from different locations in the North Sea, were tested with
respect to their geometrical, physical, and chemical properties. It turned out that
these samples were either readily suitable for the inclusion in pavement asphalt or
after minor adjustment of the method for the fabrication of bituminous mixtures. The
performance of the products fabricated from cleaned oil-drill cuttings is similar to
limestone. A few waste products have been found to be even more effective than the
original limestone filler [38].
20.3.6 CHROMIUM REMOVAL
Flocculation effluents of liquid phase oil-based drill cuttings may contain com￾paratively high concentrations of heavy metals, such as Cr6+. Therefore, by a892 CHAPTER 20 Waste disposal
direct disposal of such liquids, environmental concerns can arise. Therefore, it is
recommended that the flocculation effluent should be further treated before disposal.
Actually, in representative untreated samples, concentrations of Cr6+ of 5.26
g m−3 have been detected. Flocculation experiments using aluminum sulfate and
sodium chloride as coagulant and flocculant, respectively, reduced concentrations of
Cr6+ to 5.01 g m−3. This degree of reduction is highly unsatisfactorily, However,
after a batch treatment with activated-carbon the concentration of Cr6+ could be
reduced to 2.77 g m−3 [39].
20.4 INJECTION TECHNIQUES
Injection techniques are common in oilfield operations. Besides of their primary goal,
as e.g., fracturing, injection techniques may be useful for waste disposal. Several
injection techniques in this field have been developed.
20.4.1 ACID GAS INJECTION
Acid gas injection is a practical method to dispose the undesirable H2S and CO2
produced from natural gas. This technology allows the production of sour gas
reservoirs to be economically viable and provides an environmentally friendlier
option in comparison to other disposal alternatives.
However, adequate formations for disposal must be selected. It is necessary to
examine the properties of the minerals in the rock formation. Upon injection, no
significant changes in permeability, should be expected [40]. Geochemical analysis
of carbonate cores, previously subjected to acid gas core displacement tests by
X-ray tomography, revealed changes of the porosity. As the porosity increases also
the permeability may increase [41].
20.4.2 STORAGE OF CARBON DIOXIDE
Since carbon dioxide is considered as a greenhouse gas, its capture is considered as
an important technology. Besides of technological issues, the assessment of possible
sites for storage is if of preliminary importance.
A methodology has been developed for screening of CO2 storage fields. This
technique was tested with data available in The Netherlands [42]. The CO2 storage
capacities used in that study, have been estimated based on data and results of
previous studies performed by TNO [43].
Risk factors associated with CO2 storage influence the suitability of a reservoir.
If risk aspects are taken into account, more realistic data of the total storage potential
for CO2 are obtained.
The evaluation starts with the total storage potential in a certain region (The
Netherlands). Further the storage costs and the efforts to manage potential risk are
taken into account.20.4 Injection techniques 893
A spreadsheet tool has been designed. This enables an assessment of the criteria
through an evaluation of the fields present in the database. The data have been
weighted with a set of scores [42].
A particular result of the presented study is that 25% of the theoretical potential
storage capacity in The Netherlands falls under the category with the lowest scores
regarding the criterion effort needed to manage risk.
20.4.3 CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is capable of reducing atmospheric emissions of
greenhouse gases from coal or gas-fired power plants [44].
The majority of the technology development for carbon capture and storage
(CCS) is driven by the electric-utility industry, in which the emphasis is on large
centralized units for electric-power generation with coal as the primary fuel.
The current approach to carbon capture and sequestration from pulverized￾coal-fired power plants is not economically viable without either large subsidies
or a very high price on carbon [45]. Current schemes require roughly one-third
of a power-plant’s energy for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and pressurization.
The production of energy from geopressured aquifers has evolved as a separate,
independent technology from the sequestration of CO2 in deep, saline aquifers.
It has been suggested to combine the two technologies and add another technol￾ogy: Dissolution of CO2 into extracted brine that is then reinjected. A systematic
investigation covering a range of conditions was performed to explore the best
strategy for the coupled process of CO2 sequestration and energy production [45].
The implementation of CCS in oil sands operations has a significant poten￾tial to provide meaningful carbon-emissions reductions. The various concepts for
integrating leading CO2-capture techniques to bitumen extraction and upgrading
processes have been reviewed [46]. The relative advantages and disadvantages
for implementation in bitumen mining, thermal bitumen extraction, and bitumen
upgrading have been discussed, leading to a qualitative assessment of their suitability
for oil sands processes.
Capture of CO2 can be applied to large point sources. The CO2 would then be
compressed and transported for storage in geological formations, in the ocean, in
mineral carbonates, or for use in industrial processes [47].
Large point sources of CO2 include large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities,
major CO2-emitting industries, natural gas production, synthetic fuel plants and
fossil fuel-based hydrogen production plants. Potential technical storage methods
are: geological storage ocean storage, i.e., direct release into the ocean water
column or onto the deep seafloor, and industrial fixation of CO2 into inorganic
carbonates [47].
Geological sequestration of CO2 is an immediately available and technologically
feasible for reducing the CO2 emissions into the atmosphere [48]. Geological
sequestration is particularly suited to landlocked sedimentary basins.894 CHAPTER 20 Waste disposal
Geological media suitable for CO2 storage through various physical and chemical
trapping mechanisms must have the necessary capacity and injectivity, and must
confine the CO2 and impede its lateral migration and/or vertical leakage to other
strata, shallow potable ground water, soils or atmosphere [49].
Such geological media are mainly oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline aquifers
that are found in sedimentary basins. Storage of gases, including CO2, in these
media has been demonstrated on a commercial scale by enhanced oil recovery
operations, natural gas storage and acid gas disposal. Some of the risks associated
with CO2 capture and geological storage are similar to, and comparable with, any
other industrial activity for which extensive safety and regulatory frameworks are in
place [49].
The upward buoyancy of carbon dioxide (CO2)as a dense-phase in deep reservoirs
means that sites need to be chosen with a methodology that carefully evaluates the
details of performance during and after the injection process [44].
A major challenge in the implementation of CO2 geological storage is the high
cost of CO2 capture, particularly for dilute streams like those from power plants and
industrial combustion processes [49]. There are concerns that the public acceptance
or rejection of this technology will likely affect the large-scale implementation of
CO2 geological storage.
There are rather few operations in the world where CO2 is injected and stored
in the ground, mostly if not exclusively as a byproduct of an operation driven
by other considerations than climate change, such as oil production or regulatory
requirements regarding H2S [49]. These operations show that there are no major
technological barriers to CO2 geological storage, and that challenges and barriers lie
elsewhere.
Standard methods of site evaluation for saline aquifers are mainly focussing on
the aspects of geological containment and monitorability. Also, important to the
storage site performance is the engineering design of transport and injection.
The transport to storage in offshore saline aquifers is normally expected to be by
pipeline. Several injection states of CO2 have been proposed [44]:
1. as a dense phase, in the liquid or supercritical phase,
2. as water-alternating gas cycles, or
3. as carbonated brine.
These result in different migration pathways in the aquifer during the short term
of 1-50 years and possible different storage distributions in the long term of 1000-
10,000 years.
Suitability analysis
The selection of a specific site should be based on a suitability analysis, a proper
listing of potential sites, an assessment of the fate of the injected CO2 and a capacity
determination, together with surface criteria such as CO2 capture and transport [48].
The suitability analysis, both at the basin and regional scales, is based on geolog￾ical, geothermal, hydrodynamic, basin maturity, economic and societal criteria [48].20.4 Injection techniques 895
Choosing sequestration sites needs also the identification of major CO2 point
sources and a cost benefit analysis. The potential for CO2 escape and migration is a
deciding factor in screening out unsafe sites. The site capacity should be determined
based on in situ conditions and CO2 properties and behavior [48].
In order to develop a methodology for making decisions for aquifers offshore
of the UK, several of the available methods have been evaluated. A chemical￾engineering and reservoir-engineering approach has been used to define and
classify some of the important surface transport and subsurface interactions [44].
Important surface features are the energy balance, location, sizing, materials
specification, and prices of the surface equipment for mixing and transporting
the CO2.
Also, applications of the multiblock-discretization method to compositional flow
simulations of CO2 sequestration have been shown [50]. Problems such as transport
of chemical species in multiphase flow and CO2 sequestration have begun to assume
significant importance in decisions regarding the preservation of our environment
and in the safe and reliable means of delivering energy. The method provides a local
mass balance and a continuous approximation of fluxes across interfaces of elements
and subdomains.
Local risks
The global climate effect of CO2 returning to the atmosphere, the local risks to health
and safety, environment and equity need to be properly assessed and managed [49].
Specific risks associated with CO2 storage relate to the operational phase, i.e.,
injection and also to the post-operational phase, of which the risks of most concern
are those posed by the potential for acute or chronic CO2 leakage from the storage
site [49].
Insight in the risks associated with underground CO2 storage is needed to ensure
that it can be applied as safe and effective greenhouse mitigation option. An overview
of the risks associated with underground CO2 storage and research areas that need
to be addressed to increase the understanding of those risks has been presented
[51]. Risks caused by a failure in surface installations are understood and can be
minimized by risk abatement technologies and safety measures. The risks caused by
underground CO2 storage and CH4 leakage, seismicity, ground movement and brine
displacement are not well understood.
Impurities
Carbon dioxide (CO2) produced in CCS is generally not pure and can contain
impurities such as N2, H2, CO, H2S, and water. The presence of these impurities
could lead to challenging flow assurance issues. The presence of water may result
in ice or gas hydrate formation and cause blockage. Reducing the water content is
commonly required to reduce the potential for corrosion, but, for an offshore pipeline
system, it is also used as a means of preventing gas hydrate problems [52].
The gaseous CO2-rich stream is generally compressed to be transported as liquid
or dense-phase in order to avoid two-phase flow and increase in the density of896 CHAPTER 20 Waste disposal
the system. The presence of impurities will also change the system’s bubblepoint
pressure, hence affecting the compression requirement.
The risk of hydrate formation in a CO2-rich stream has been evaluated. Also,
the phase behavior of CO2 in the presence of common impurities has been studied.
An experimental methodology was developed for measuring the water content in
a CO2-rich phase in equilibrium with hydrates. The water content in equilibrium
with hydrates at simulated pipeline conditions (e.g., 4 ◦C and up to 190 bar) as well
as after simulated choke conditions (e.g., at −2 ◦C and approximately 50 bar) was
measured for pure CO2 and a mixture of 2 mol% H2 and 98 mol% CO2. Bubblepoint
measurements were also taken for this binary mixture for temperatures ranging from
−20 to 25 ◦C.
A thermodynamic approach was employed to model the phase equilibria. The
experimental data available in the literature on gas solubility in water in binary
systems were used in tuning the binary interaction parameters.
The thermodynamic model was used to predict the phase behavior and the
hydrate-dissociation conditions of various CO2-rich streams in the presence of
free water and various levels of dehydration (250 and 500 ppm). The obtained
results are in good agreement with the available experimental data. The developed
experimental methodology and thermodynamic model could provide the necessary
data in determining the required dehydration level for CO2-rich systems, as well as
the minimum pipeline pressure required to avoid a two-phase flow, hydrates, and
water condensation [52].
Well Integrity
A safe and ecologic underground storage of CO2 requires a long-term integrity of the
wells affected by the injected CO2, including both active wells and abandoned wells.
Technical integrity is assumed if there is no significant leak in the subsurface
system from the storage reservoir. The evaluation of integrity of abandoned wells
over a long time frame during CO2 underground storage can only be performed
indirectly and requires a comprehensive understanding of the relevant processes that
are affecting the well integrity.
An integrated approach for assessing these issues has been presented [53].
Qualitative consequence analysis provides a solid and comprehensive study on all
the issues that affect well integrity. A mechanical model reveals the stress distribution
of the casing, cement, and rock composite system and provides a quantification of
defects caused by different load conditions. This can be further used for a simulation
of CO2 leakages. A numerical model has been presented to simulate the flow of CO2
along abandoned wellbores during the long storage period, such as 1000 years.
It has been found from such analysis processes that the most critical system
components are cap rock, casing/cement/rock composite system, and abandonment
elements [53].
Also it has been found that in the simulated scenarios the CO2-leakage rate is very
small except for when using cement sheaths of very poor quality, which can lead to20.4 Injection techniques 897
a leakage rate exceeding the maximum-allowable value. Sensitivity analysis showed
that the vertical permeability of the cement sheath plays the most critical role [53].
Energy implications
The profile by process or industrial activity of worldwide large stationary CO2
sources with emissions of more than 0.1 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2) per year
is shown in Table 20.4.
A standard baseline scenario that assumes no policy intervention to limit green￾house gas emissions has 10 TW of carbon-emission-free power being produced
by the year 2050, equivalent to the power provided by all energy sources in 1998
combined [54].
A carbon cycle energy model has been used to estimate the carbon-emission-free
power needed for various atmospheric CO2 stabilization scenarios [54].
It has been found that CO2 stabilization with continued economic growth will
require innovative, cost effective and carbon-emission-free technologies that can
provide additional tens of terawatts of primary power in the future decades, and
certainly by the middle of the 21th century, even with sustained improvement in the
economic productivity of primary energy.
At progressively lower atmospheric CO2-stabilization targets in the 750-350 ppm
by volume range, implementing stabilization is even more challenging because of
the increasing demand for carbon emission free power. The magnitude of the implied
infrastructure transition suggests the need for massive investments in innovative
energy research projects [54].
Estimating carbon dioxide fluxes along leaky wellbores
Large-scale geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is likely to bring CO2 plumes
into contact with a large number of existing wellbores [55]. The flux of CO2 along

a leaking wellbore requires a model of fluid properties and of transport along the
leakage pathway.
Knowing the range of effective permeability of faulty cement is essential for
estimating the risk of CO2 leakage.
The leakage pathway in wells that exhibit sustained casing pressure (SCP) is
analogous to the rate-limiting part of the leakage pathway in any wellbore that CO2
might encounter. Thus, field observations of SCP can be used to estimate transport
properties of a CO2-leakage pathway.
An uncertainty in the estimate can be reduced by accounting for constraints
from well construction geometry and from physical considerations. A simple CO2
leakage model has been proposed [55]. This model accounts for the variation in
CO2 properties along the leakage path and allows the path to terminate in an
unconfined (constant pressure) exit. The latter assumption provides a worst-case
leakage flux [55].
Using pathway permeabilities consistent with the observations in SCP wells, a
range of CO2 fluxes for the cases of buoyancy-driven (post-injection) and pressure￾driven (during injection) leakage can be obtained [55].
Assuming the frequency distribution is representative of SCP wells, it can be
concluded that in leakage pathways corresponding to the slow but non negligible
buildup of casing pressure, the effective permeability of the leakage path is in
the range of some μ D to hundreds of μ D, and the corresponding CO2 fluxes
are comparable with naturally occurring background fluxes observed at the ground
surface. In pathways corresponding to intermediate and fast buildup rate of casing
pressure (tens to hundreds of psi D−1, the effective permeability is in the range
of tenths to tens of m D, and theCO2 fluxes are comparable with surface flux
measurements at the Illinois basin and at the natural seep at Crystal Geyser (Utah). In
pathways corresponding to very fast buildup rate (thousands of psi D−1), the effective
permeability is from tens to hundreds of m D and the CO2 fluxes are up to three orders
of magnitude higher than those measured at the Crystal Geyser [55].
20.4.4 SLURRY FRACTURE INJECTION TECHNIQUE
The slurry fracture injection (SFI) technique has been proposed as an alternative
waste disposal method. This technique is environmentally secure and permanent.
It does not leave any future liabilities that must be risk-evaluated or priced. An
entire waste stream comprising the ground solids and the waste water can be injected
into deep and hydraulically secure target strata. No contamination of drinking water
formations should occur. Particularly, the method can be used to clean and reclaim
landfills, oil pits and granular waste dumps [4].
The feasibility of the SFI can be ensured by using a two-tier screening method
in order to evaluate the feasibility and further to the identify suitable target zones.
Parameters that have been used to decide about the feasibility of the method are
summarized in Table 20.5.20.4 Injection techniques 899
Table 20.5 Parameters for SFI

Thickness of target formation Thickness of confining layer
Permeability Porosity
Depth of formation Structural complexity
Lithological sequence Reservoir strength
Ground water source distance Economic Value of Formation
Urban distance Industrial distance
Impact on vegetation Micro-climatic impact
Topographic changes Transportation distance
To these parameters, descriptive values are associated, e.g., for impact on
vegetation: reduction, unchanged, increase. Further, to these descriptive values,
numerical scores are associated. These scores are flowing in into a tree of decision
about the feasibility.
The methodology introduced provides a simple and transparent decision aid for
evaluating SFI sites. A multi-criteria evaluation is done, taking into account various
engineering and environmental parameters.
A stringent environmental and process control monitoring program should
accompany the period of planning and operation in order to ensure optimal envi￾ronmental protection, waste containment, and regulatory health, safety, and environ￾mental compliance. The necessary requirements preconditions for the SFI technique
are [4]:
• formations at shallow to moderate depths of 350-2000 m, far below any useable
aquifers,
• a structurally simple formation, with no tectonic structures that could impair the
sealing properties,
• the formation should be embedded by impermeable thick layers,
• the thickness of the confinement zone above the containment zone should be at
least more than 20-30 m, and
• the containment formation should be porous and permeable.
The injection of the slurry is carried out in three phases, during a period up to
12 h. Initially, a solids-free waste water is pumped to initiate fractures or to propagate
fractures. In the second phase, solid wastes are added in increasing amounts to the
water. The content of the solids may reach 30% by volume. The maximum amount, of
course depends on the size and the nature of the solids. Another issue is the geological
characteristics of the formation. In the final phase again pure water is pumped in order
to clean up the regions, i.e., the injection system, and the well itself [4].900 CHAPTER 20 Waste disposal
20.4.5 USE AS SEALANTS
Waste chemicals generated by, for example, industrial plants, are often disposed of
by injecting the chemicals into disposal wells that penetrate subterranean zones [56].
Suitable subterranean zones for receiving such waste chemicals are separated by
natural barriers from other zones that contain oil, gas, and water.
Unfortunately, many waste chemicals injected into disposal wells, e.g., acidic
or caustic materials, and salt water, are corrosive to the hydraulic cement in the
well bore. Moreover, if hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide gases are generated
in the subterranean zone or injected into the disposal well, an additional source of
degradation of the hydraulic cement emerges.
Namely, hydrogen sulfide corrodes the cement. Carbon dioxide reacts with
calcium in the cement at temperatures above 95 ◦C (200 ◦F). Naturally, the high
downhole temperatures in the well bore accelerates the degradation reactions. As
a result of the degradation of the hydraulic cement, the waste chemicals injected into
the disposal well can undesirably leak into subterranean zones containing drinking
water.
For these reasons, sealing compositions are used under such conditions. For
example, epoxy-based compositions can resist the degradation by chemicals. Such
compositions may replace the hydraulic cements conventionally used in disposal
wells [57].
Epoxy-based compositions are highly resistant to chemical and thermal degrada￾tion, they suffer from that their curing times are relatively short at temperatures of
150 ◦C (300 ◦F) or higher. However, such temperatures are commonly encountered
in disposal wells [56].
In other words, the curing times of the epoxy-based compositions are too short
for the compositions to be properly placed in the annulus such that they can isolate
laterally adjacent subterranean zones from waste chemicals injected into the disposal
well. So, when an epoxy-based composition is being pumped down the pipe in the
disposal well, at least a portion of it hardens, thus never reaching the annulus.
For these reasons, alternative sealing compositions have been developed. These
are furan resins. Furan resins in the so called α-state are oligomers made from
furfuryl alcohol and formaldehyde. When pumped down into the wellbore annulus,
complete curing and crosslinking occurs.
The addition of a curing agent is necessary and to adjust the viscosity, a thinner or
a diluent is added. The curing of furan resins occurs generally acid by acid catalysis,
c.f. Figure 20.3. Thus curing occurs via the adjustment of the pH of the system. For
this reason, organic and inorganic acids are suitable curing agents, or for delayed
curing, hydrolyzable esters thats act additionally as diluent. For pH adjustment,
sodium bisulfate is used. Suitable hydrolyzable esters and diluents are butyl acetate
or furfuryl acetate.
To enhance the bonding to the interfaces, a coupling agent is added, such as N-2-
(amino ethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane,
and N-β-(amino ethyl)-γ-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane [57].20.4 Injection techniques 901

Curing behavior of compositions based on epoxy and furan [56].
Preferably, the sealant compositions comprise also a filler. Low-density micro￾spheres, i.e., hollow spheres of glass are appreciated filler materials. To adjust the
mechanical properties, plasticizers can be added. These include diethyl phthalate,
butyl benzyl phthalate, and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.
The curing behavior of compositions based on either epoxy or furan was tested at
163 ◦C (325 ◦F). The results are shown in Figure 20.4.902 CHAPTER 20 Waste disposal

21 Dispersions, emulsions,
and foams
Actually, there is no common generic technical term that includes these different
subtopics. The admittedly clumsy term small scale heterogenic materials created by
the author would not be adequate as a title for this chapter. Some authors use the term
dispersion as generic term that includes emulsions, c.f., Table 21.1.
Note that there is a difference, depending on the size of he particle. If the particle
site is in the range of the size of a molecule, the dispersion is addressed as a solution.
Between the nanometer and micrometer size, the particle are colloid like, and above
this range we are dealing with a suspension.
In fact, emulsions, dispersions, and foams are related from the view of their
physical laws of stability, preparation, and destruction. Monographs on the basic
issues of these topics are available [2–5].
21.1 DISPERSIONS
In the realm of oilfield applications dispersions consist mostly of finely distributed
solids in a liquid, however, also other physical states are appropriate, c.f., Table 21.1.
Dispersions have been reviewed in the literature [6–9] Subsequently, special
dispersants in oilfield applications will be dealt with.
21.1.1 DISPERSANTS
Dispersants are also addressed as dispersing agents. Dispersants are used to improve
the separation of particles. Further, they are used to prevent settling or clumping.
Dispersants are used in several disciplines beyond oil filed applications [10].
Dispersants are related to surfactants, as they contain usually surfactants. How￾ever, the term surfactant is more general. The use of surfactants includes detergents,
wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and last but not least dispersants.
Sloppily spoken, let us state that dispersants are used to create slurries, whereas
surfactants are used to create emulsions. However, the border is blurred.
In the oilfield industry, the term surfactant is targeting mostly to emulsifying
agents for fluids. In contrast, the major fields of the application for dispersants include
cement slurries, oil spill treating agents, and transport applications. Subsequently
dispersants for the most important applications are collected.

Aqueous drilling muds
Low molecular weight dispersants
Complexes of tetravalent zirconium and ligands selected from organic acids such
as citric, tartaric, malic, and lactic acid and a complex of aluminum and citric acid
are suitable as dispersants [11–14]. This type of dispersant is especially useful in
dispersing bentonite suspensions. The muds can be used at pH values ranging from
slightly acidic to strongly basic.
Synthetic polymers
Polymers containing maleic anhydride. A mixture of sulfonated styrene-maleic
anhydride (MA) copolymer and polymers prepared from acrylic acid (AA) or
acrylamide (AAm) and their derivatives [15] are dispersants for drilling fluids. The
rheologic characteristics of aqueous well drilling fluids are enhanced by incorporat￾ing into the fluids small amounts of sulfonated styrene-itaconic acid copolymers [16]
and an AA or AAm polymer [17].
Sulfonated styrene-maleimide copolymers are similarly active [18]. Examples of
maleimide monomers are maleimide, N-phenyl maleimide, N-ethyl maleimide, N-
(2-chloropropyl) maleimide, and N-cyclohexyl maleimide, c.f. Figure 21.1. N-aryl
and substituted aryl maleimide monomers are preferred. The polymers are obtained
by free radical polymerization in solution, in bulk, or by suspension.
In copolymers containing the styrene sulfonate moiety and MA units, the
MA units can be functionalized with an alkyl amine [19–24]. The water-soluble
polymers impart enhanced deflocculation characteristics to the mud. Typically, the
deflocculants are relatively low molecular weight polymers composed of styrene
sodium sulfonate monomer, MA, as the anhydride or the diacid, and a zwitterionic
functionalized MA.
Typically the molar ratio of styrene sulfonate units to total MA units ranges from
3:1 to 1:1. The level of alkyl amine functionalization of the MA units is 75-100 mol%.
The molar concentrations of sulfonate and zwitterionic units are not necessarily
equivalent, because the deflocculation properties of these water-soluble polymers can
be controlled via changes in their ratio.21.1 Dispersions 909

Alternating 1:1 copolymers of sodium methallylsulfonate and MA are useful
as water-soluble dispersants [25]. The copolymers are produced by free radical
polymerization in acetic acid solution. Because of their high solubility in water and
the high proportion of sulfonate salt functional groups, these alternating polymers are
useful as dispersing agents in water-based drilling fluids.
Acrylics. Low-molecular weight copolymers of AA and salts of vinyl sulfonic
acid have been described as dispersants and high-temperature deflocculants for
the stabilization of the rheologic properties of aqueous, clay-based drilling fluids
subjected to high levels of calcium ion contamination [26,27]. Divalent ions, such as
calcium ions or magnesium ions, can cause uncontrolled thickening of the mud and
large increases in filtration times of fluids from the mud into permeable formations.
A flocculation of the mud can occur in high-temperature applications. This
flocculation increases the thickening effects of certain chemical contaminants and
deactivates or destroys many mud thinners, which are used to stabilize the muds with
respect to these effects.
Poly(acrylic acid), or a water-soluble salt, having a molecular weight of 1.5-5
kDa, measured on the respective sodium salt and a polydispersity of 1.05-1.45, has
been described as a dispersant for a drilling or packer fluid [28].
Copolymers or terpolymers of AA, which contain from 5 to 50 mol% of
sulfoethyl acrylamide, AAm and sulfoethyl acrylamide, ethyl acrylate and sulfoethyl
acrylamide, AAm and sulfophenyl acrylamide, and AAm and sulfomethyl acry￾lamide, are claimed to be calcium tolerant deflocculants for drilling fluids [29]. In
general, 0.1-2 lb of polymer per barrel of drilling fluid is sufficient to prevent the
flocculation of the additives in the drilling fluid.910 CHAPTER 21 Dispersions, emulsions, and foams
A salt of a polymer or copolymer of acrylic or methacrylic acid (MA), in which
the acid is neutralized with alkanolamines, alkyl amines, or lithium salts [30], is
suitable as a dispersing agent.
Polymers with amine sulfide terminal moieties. Amine sulfide terminal moieties
can be imparted into vinyl polymers by using aminethiols as chain transfer agents in
aqueous radical polymerization [31]. The polymers are useful as mineral dispersants.
Other uses are as water treatment additives for boiler waters, cooling towers,
reverse osmosis applications, and geothermal processes in oil wells, as detergent
additives acting as builders, antifilming agents, dispersants, sequestering agents, and
encrustation inhibitors.
Polycarboxylates. Polycarboxylated polyalkoxylates and their sulfate derivatives
may be prepared by reacting an ethoxylated or propoxylated alcohol with a water￾soluble, alkali or earth alkali metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid [32].
The reaction occurs in aqueous solution in the presence of a free radical initiator
and gives products in enhanced yield and reduced impurity levels, compared with
the essentially anhydrous reactions with free carboxylic acids, which have been
used otherwise. The method provides products that give solutions that are clear on
neutralization, remain clear and homogeneous on dilution, and are useful as cleaning
agents in drilling and other oilfield operations.
Natural modified polymers
Modified poly(saccharide)s. Phosphated, oxidized starch with a molecular weight
of 1.5-40 kDa, with a carboxyl degree of substitution of 0.30-0.96, is useful as a
dispersant for drilling fluids [33].
Physical mixtures consist of reversibly crosslinked and uncrosslinked hy￾drocolloid compositions and hydrocolloids. These show improved dispersion
properties [34].
Sulfonated asphalt. Sulfonated asphalt can be produced as follows [35]:
1. heating an asphaltic material,
2. mixing the asphalt with a solvent, such as hexane,
3. sulfonating the asphalt with a liquid sulfonating agent, such as liquid sulfur
trioxide,
4. neutralizing the sulfonic acids with a basic neutralizing agent, such as sodium
hydroxide,
5. separating solvent from the sulfonated asphalt,
6. recovering the evaporated solvent for reuse, and
7. drying the separated, sulfonated asphalt by passing it through a drum dryer.
This is a batch-type process in which the rates of flow of the solvent, the asphaltic
material, the sulfonating agent, and the neutralizing agent and the periods of time
before withdrawal of the sulfonic acids and the sulfonated asphalt are coordinated
according to a predetermined time cycle.
The dried sulfonated asphalt can then be used in the preparation of drilling fluids,
such as aqueous, oil-based, and emulsion types. Such drilling fluids have excellent21.1 Dispersions 911
rheologic properties, such as viscosity and gel strength, and exhibit a low rate of
filtration or fluid loss.
Humic acids. Coal with a mean particle size of less than 3 mm is slurried with water
and then oxidized with oxygen or mixtures of oxygen and air at temperatures ranging
from 100 ◦C to 300 ◦C, at partial oxygen pressures ranging from 0.1 to 10 M Pa and
reaction periods ranging from 5 to 600 min [36]. In the absence of catalysts, such as
alkaline bases, the main products of oxidation are humic acids.
These humic acids are not dissolved because the pH of this slurry is in the range
of 4-9. Small amounts of fulvic acids are formed, and these are soluble in the water of
the slurry. The coal-derived humic acids find applications as drilling fluid dispersants
and viscosity control agents, whereas the coal-derived fulvic acids may be used to
produce plasticizers and petrochemicals.
Cement
Dispersants are used in well cement slurries. For this application, the dispersant
should be water-soluble. The dispersants prevent high initial cement slurry viscosities
and friction losses when the slurries are pumped.
Poly(melamine sulfonate) and hydroxyethyl cellulose
For oilfield cement slurries containing microsilica, sodium poly(melamine sulfonate)
and hydroxyethyl cellulose may be used as dispersing agents [37–39]. Melamine is
shown in Figure 21.2.
The cement slurries may contain up to 30% of microsilica (i.e., colloidal silica),
silica flour, diatomaceous earth, or fly ash with particle dimensions between 0.05 and
5 μ m. The slurries may further contain conventional additives, such as antifoaming
agents and set retarding agents, etc.
Poly(ethyleneimine) phosphonate derivatives
In oil and gas well cementing operations, poly(ethyleneimine) phosphonate￾derivative dispersants enhance the flow behavior of the cement slurry [40]. The
slurry can be pumped in turbulent flow, thereby forming a bond between the well
casing and the rock formation.

Acetone formaldehyde cyanide resins
An aqueous solution of acetone and sodium cyanide is condensed by adding
formaldehyde at 60 ◦C. A resin with nitrile groups is obtained. A similar product with
sodium sulfite can be obtained. These products are dispersants for cements [41,42].
The dispersant properties of the composition can be enhanced by further reacting the
composition with a hydroxide.
Napthalenosulfonic acid formaldehyde condensates
A dispersing agent for a cement slurry is the magnesium salt from the condensation
of napthalenosulfonic acid and formaldehyde [43,44]. The additive eliminates free
water, even at low temperatures and in particular with those cements most susceptible
to this phenomenon.
Sulfoalkylated naphthols
Sulfoalkylated naphthol compounds are effective as dispersants in aqueous ce￾ment slurries. The compounds can also be applied in an admixture with water￾soluble inorganic compounds of chromium to provide additives of increased overall
effectiveness. Particularly suitable are sodium chromate or ammonium dichromate.
α-Naphthol is reacted in an alkaline aqueous medium with formaldehyde to create
condensation products. The aldehyde can be reacted with bisulfite to produce
sulfoalkylated products [45,46].
Azolignosulfonate
A cement dispersant has been described that is an azolignosulfonate formed from the
coupling of a diazonium salt, made from sulfanilic acid or p-aminobenzoic acid,
and a lignosulfonate [47]. The dispersant can reduce the aqueous cement slurry
viscosity or thin the cement composition to make the cement slurry pumpable without
significantly retarding the set time of the cement slurry. The azo structure is formed
by coupling lignosulfonate with diazonium salt. It masks the retardation effect of the
phenolic group in the lignosulfonate molecule.
Polymers from allyloxybenzene sulfonate
Water-soluble polymers of allyloxybenzene sulfonate monomers can be used as
dispersants in drilling fluids and in treating boiler waters in steamflooding and as
plasticizers in cement slurries [48,49]. The preferable molecular weight range is 1-
500 kDa.
Sulfonated isobutylene maleic anhydride copolymer
A dispersant that can be used in drilling fluids, spacer fluids, cement slurries, comple￾tion fluids, and mixtures of drilling fluids and cement slurries controls the rheologic
properties of and enhances the filtrate control in these fluids. The dispersant consists
of polymers derived from monomeric residues, including low molecular weight
olefins that may be sulfonated or phosphonated, unsaturated dicarboxylic acids,21.1 Dispersions 913
ethylenically unsaturated anhydrides, unsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids,
poly(vinyl alcohol)s (PVA)s and diols, and sulfonated or phosphonated styrene. The
sulfonic acid, phosphonic acid, and carboxylic acid groups on the polymers may be
present in neutralized form as alkali metal or ammonium salts [50,51].
Miscellaneous dispersants
A nonpolluting dispersing agent for drilling fluids [52–54] has been described. The
agent is based on polymers or copolymers of unsaturated acids, such as AA or MA,
with suitable counter ions.
Sulfur
The deposition of elemental sulfur in conduits through which a sulfur containing
gas is flowing can be reduced by providing a sulfur dispersant. The dispersant is
an adduct of a primary alcohol and epichlorohydrin, mixed with an aliphatic amine
component [55].
Asphalts
Certain petroleum products, including, heavy crude oils and residual fuel oils, are
rich in asphaltenes. The presence of asphaltenes can lead to various problems in
the recovery and transportation of the products. This results in increased viscosity,
formation of stable emulsions, fouling and corrosion [56].
Certain alkyl-substituted phenol-formaldehyde resins can act as dispersants for
asphalts and asphaltenes in crude oils [57]. The dispersants help keep asphalt
and asphaltenes in dispersion and inhibit fouling, precipitation, and buildup in the
equipment.
Further, asphaltenes in petroleum products can be stabilized with amine-chelate
complexes. Improved compositions contain ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, a fatty
acid amide, and an imidazoline amide compound [56]. The compounds are shown in
Figure 21.3.
Oil spill
Dispersants for oil spill applications are sprayed onto oil slicks in order to remove
oil from the sea surface and disperse it into the aqueous phase. In addition,
dispersants reduce the environmental impact of the spilled oil as they are removing
the spill from the surface of the water. Moreover, dispersants can be used under
harsh weather conditions, in that mechanical collection may not otherwise be
possible.
The dispersion process accelerates the degradation of the oil by natural processes
[58]. However, prior to the use of a certain dispersant, consideration must be given
to the impact of the dispersed oil on sub-surface resources, such as fish stocks and
coral. In addition, it is essential that the limitations of dispersants are recognized so
that they will be used effectively. [59]914 CHAPTER 21 Dispersions, emulsions, and foams

Ethoxylated sorbitol oleate and mixtures are suitable for emulsifying or dispers￾ing spilled petroleum products in either terrestrial or marine environments [60].
A fully integrated and effective response to an oil or chemical spill at sea must
include a well planned and executed post-incident assessment of environmental
contamination and damage. Case studies of the use of oil spill dispersants haves been
reported [58,61].
21.2 EMULSIONS
Emulsions play an important role in fluids used for oilfield applications. These
include most importantly drilling and treatment fluids. Actually in these fields
of applications, the emulsions are not addressed as such, rather, e.g., as oil￾based drilling muds (OBM)s or water-based drilling muds, which are essentially
emulsions from the view of physics. Here we summarize some basic aspects of
emulsions.
Oilfield emulsions are sometimes classified based on their degree of kinetic
stability [62,63]:
• loose emulsions: those that will separate within a few minutes. The separated
water is sometimes referred to as the free water.
• medium emulsions: They will separate in a some 10 min.
• tight emulsions: They will separate within of hours, days, or even weeks.
Thereafter, the separation may not be complete.
Emulsions are also classified by the size of the droplets in the continuous
phase. When the dispersed droplets are larger than 0.1 μ m, the emulsion is a
macroemulsion [63].21.2 Emulsions 915
From the purely thermodynamic view, an emulsion is an unstable system. This
arises because there is a natural tendency for a liquid-liquid system to separate and
reduce its interfacial area and thus its interfacial energy [62].
A second class of emulsions is known as microemulsion. Such emulsions
are formed spontaneously when two immiscible phases are brought together with
extremely low interfacial energy. Microemulsions have very small droplet sizes,
less than 10 nm, and are stable from the view of thermodynamics. Microemul￾sions are fundamentally different from macroemulsions in their formation and
stability.
21.2.1 INVERT EMULSIONS
Invert emulsions have a continuous phase that is an oleaginous fluid, and a discon￾tinuous phase that is a fluid, which is at least partially immiscible in the oleaginous
fluid. Actually, invert emulsion are water-in-oil emulsions.
Invert emulsions may have desirable suspension properties for particulates like
drill cuttings. As such, they can easily be weighted if desired. It is well known to
reverse invert emulsions to regular emulsions by changing the pH or by protonating
the surfactant. In this way, the affinity of the surfactant for the continuous and
discontinuous phases is changed [64].
For example, if a residual amount of an invert emulsion remains in a well bore,
this portion may be reversed to a regular emulsion to clean out the emulsion from
the well bore. Invert emulsion compositions can be used, where the organic phase
is gelled. For example, diesel can be gelled with decanephosphonic acid monoethyl
ester and a Fe3+ activator [64].
Polymers are often used to increase the viscosity an aqueous fluid. The polymer
should interact with this fluid as it should show a tendency to hydrate. Microemul￾sions may be helpful to achieve this target [65].
Breakers
As breakers for invert emulsions, polymerized linseed oil reacted with di￾ethanolamine has been proposed [66]. Breakers are described in more detail in
Chapter 17.4.10.
Drilling fluid systems
Invert emulsion fluid systems tend to exhibit high performance with regard to shale
inhibition, borehole stability, and lubricity. However, invert emulsion fluid systems
have a high risk of loss of circulation [67].
Latex additives can counterbalance this drawback, but since water must be added,
an oil base drilling fluid system becomes an unbalanced invert emulsion system
with different rheological properties. It is possible to rebalance an unbalanced
invert emulsion fluid system. Conventionally, an unbalanced invert emulsion fluid
system would either have to be rebalanced in the field or transported offsite to be
rebalanced.916 CHAPTER 21 Dispersions, emulsions, and foams
There are special formulations that avoid this drawback. The latex particles are
not dispersed in the oil base continuous phase. Rather, the latex particles are dispersed
in the emulsified aqueous phase. In fact, one of the advantages of invert emulsion
fluids is that they can achieve at least some of the benefits of having an aqueous
phase without requiring the aqueous phase to be in direct contact with the borehole
wall [67].
Drill cuttings removal
It is often necessary to drill a wellbore through geological formations the constituent
materials of which swell or disintegrate on contact with water. In such cases an OBM
is used, that is a fluid in which the liquid phase consists of oil, or of water-in-oil
emulsions which are known in the art as invert emulsion fluids [68].
Invert emulsion types of mud have many advantages however, these must be
weighed against environmental problems, in particular for offshore drilling. The mud
itself is always recycled but the cuttings have to be removed after separating them on
the surface using mechanical separators for separating out the solids [69]. These are
vibratory screens, hydrocyclones, and centrifuges.
Under the strictest regulations, it is permitted to discharge cuttings into the sea
only when the cuttings contain less than 1% of organic substances. This amount is
greatly exceeded by using an invert emulsion type mud because the film of the mud
which contaminates the cuttings cannot be eliminated using mechanical techniques.
Therefore it has been proposed to wash the cuttings before discharging them
to the sea. However, the surfactants added to stabilize the invert emulsion are so
effective that the washing water itself is emulsified in the mud, so the oil is dispersed
in the washing water. Furthermore, both the volume and the viscosity of the mud
increase [69].
The addition of detergents to destabilize such emulsions is largely ineffective.
Moreover, detergents themselves cause environmental problems [69]. The combina￾tion of a non-ionic alkoxylated surfactant and an anionic sulfonate surfactant yields
a stable invert emulsion.
This is surprising, because neither of these agents, when used alone, is capable
of producing such an effect. The stable invert emulsion will rapidly and completely
destabilize and disperse by simple admixture with low salinity waters [68].
According to such a principle, the cuttings are separated from the wellbore fluid
and then washed with a wash water until the emulsion destabilizes. Alternatively, the
separated cuttings are brought into contact with a water, which will destabilize the
emulsion [68].
For copolymers with poly(oxyethylene) grafts the stability of a direct oil-in-water
emulsion increases with the proportion of grafts and with their length. Hydrophobic
modified poly(acrylates), with a hydrophilic backbone modified with long chain alkyl
acrylates or alkyl methacrylates can be used as surfactants [70]. Such emulsions can
be destabilized by adding an electrolyte.
A statistical copolymer from 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic
acid acrylate can be modified by amidification with n-alkylamines, such as21.2 Emulsions 917
di-n-dodecylamine [69]. Depending on the degree of modification of the monomers,
the polymers are effective as stabilizers for direct or invert emulsions. The emulsion
can be destabilized or reversed by reducing the salinity of the aqueous phase or
neutralizing the acid.
This phenomenon is used with advantage in fluids employed for petroleum or
analogous wells, in particular drilling, fracturing, acidizing, or completion fluids [69].
Thinners may be added to invert emulsions. Anionic surfactants are used,
particularly from the group of fatty alcohol sulfates. Thinners, which reduce the
viscosity of drilling fluids at low temperatures are oxethylated fatty acids [71].
21.2.2 WATER-IN-WATER EMULSIONS
When two or more different water-soluble polymers are dissolved together in an
aqueous medium, it is sometimes observed that the system phase separates into
distinct regions. Particularly, this happens when two polymers are chosen that are
each water-soluble but thermodynamically incompatible with each other. These
emulsions are termed as water-in-water emulsions, or also aqueous two-phase
systems [72].
In the food industry, such fluids are used to create polymer solutions that
mimic the properties of fat globules. In the biomedical industry, such systems are
exploited as separation media for proteins, enzymes, and other macromolecules that
preferentially partition to one polymer phase in the mixture.
Aqueous two-phase polymer-polymer systems are also of interest in oilfield
applications. These mixtures can be used to create low viscosity pre-hydrated
concentrated mixtures to allow the rapid mixing of the polymers at a well site to
achieve a low viscosity polymer fluid.
Solutions of guar and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) form aqueous phase￾separated solutions over a range of polymer concentrations. A phase-separated
mixture can be formed by simultaneously dissolving dry guar and dry HPC in a
blender. After continued stirring the solution is allowed to rest to achieve phase
separation. Afterwards, the phase-separated solution can be gently stirred to remix
the guar-rich and HPC-rich phases. The two-phase polymer solution can be activated
to become an elastic gel by thermal treatment, or by changing the ionic strength [72].
This behavior can be used for zone isolation.
21.2.3 OIL-IN-WATER-IN-OIL EMULSIONS
Oil-in-water-in-oil emulsions can be used as a drive fluid for enhanced oil recovery
operations or as a lubrication fluid. Such emulsions exhibit improved shear stability
and shear thinning characteristics in comparison to water-in-oil emulsions.
An oil-in-water-in-oil emulsion is prepared from an oil-in-water emulsion that is
subsequently dispersed in a second oil [73]. The second oil may contain a stabilizer,
i.e., micron to sub-micron-sized solid particles, naphthenic acids, and asphaltenes.918 CHAPTER 21 Dispersions, emulsions, and foams
21.2.4 MICROEMULSIONS
A microemulsion is a thermodynamically stable fluid. It is different from kinetically
stable emulsions which will be break into oil and water over time. The particle size
of microemulsions ranges from about 10-300 nm. Because of the small particle sizes,
microemulsions appear as clear or translucent solutions.
The particle sizes of microemulsions may be identified by dynamic light scat￾tering or neutron scattering. Microemulsions have ultralow interfacial tension (IFT)
between the water phase and the oil phase.
Water-in-oil microemulsions have been known to deliver water-soluble oilfield
chemicals into subterranean rock formations. Also known are oil-in-alcohol mi￾croemulsions containing corrosion inhibitors in antifreeze compositions [74].
Microemulsions can be used to deliver a wide variety of oil soluble oilfield
chemicals, including corrosion inhibitors, asphaltene inhibitors, scale inhibitors,
etc. Thereby the amount of organic solvent needed is reduced. The microemulsion
increases the dispersibility of oilfield chemicals into the produced fluids or pumped
fluids. In this way, the performance of the particular chemical is increased [74].
Microemulsions may be broken by a variety of mechanisms, such as by chemicals
or by temperature changes. However, the most simple way of breaking is by dilution.
An example of a microemulsion that caries a corrosion inhibitor is listed in
Table 21.2. The formulation in Table 21.2 can be easily diluted to the water
phase. If the amount of toluene is increased in favor of water, a microemulsion is
obtained that can be diluted by a hydrocarbon solvent. Still other examples are given
elsewhere [74].
21.2.5 SOLIDS-STABILIZED EMULSION
Emulsions can be stabilized using undissolved solid particles, which are partially
oleophilic [75]. Three-phase emulsions that are stabilized with solids have been
reviewed [76]. Further, the phenomenon of oil loss due to entrainment in emulsion

sludge layers has been assessed. A semi-empirical approach has suggested for
estimating the loss of oil.
The solid particles may be either indigenous to the formation or obtained from
outside the formation. Nonformation solid particles include clays, quartz, feldspar,
gypsum, coal dust, asphaltenes, and polymers. Preferably, however, the particles
contain small amounts of a ionic compound. Typically, the particles exhibits some
composite irregular shape [75].
The solid particles should have either some oleophilic character for making an
oil-external emulsion or some hydrophilic character for making a water-external
emulsion. This property is important for ensuring that the particles can be wetted
by the external continuous phase that holds the internal, discontinuous phase.
The oleophilic or hydrophilic character may be an inherent characteristic of the
solid particles or either acquired by a chemical treatment of the particles.
For example, oleophilic fumed silicas, e.g., Aerosil™ R972 or CAB-O-SIL™
consist of small spheres of fumed silica that have been treated with organosilanes
or organosilazanes to make the surfaces oleophilic. These are effective solids for
stabilizing many crude oil emulsions. Such particles are extremely small, having
primary particles consisting of spheres with diameters as small as about 10-20 nm,
although the primary particles interact to form larger aggregates. These silicas are
effective at concentrations of 0.5-20 g l−1.
Figure 21.4 shows the viscosity of an emulsion with solid particles at a shear rate
of 75 s−1 as a function of the water content.

The oil in the emulsion can be pretreated with a sulfonating agent prior to
emulsification, in order to enhance its ability to make a solids-stabilized water-in-oil
emulsion [77]. A specific procedure for the sulfonation of both the solids and the oil
has been disclosed [77]:
Preparation 21–1: The crude oil and the solid particles are co-sulfonated. Twelve grams
g of crude oil and solids comprised of 0.06 g of 2-methylbenzyl tallow intercalated
monomorillonite and 0.12 g of asphalt are stirred at 50 ◦C for 72 h. Subsequently,
concentrated sulfuric acid is added at 3 parts per 100 parts of oil at 50 ◦C during 24 h.
In a variant of the preparation method 21–1, the sulfonated crude oil can be
combined with a maleic acid grafted copolymer from ethylene and propylene [78].
In addition, instead of sulfonation, a photochemical treatment of the oil has been
examined [78]. Hereby, a bentonite clay gel is mixed with the crude oil before
photochemical treatment. In a dye sensitized photochemical treatment process, the
crude oil is first mixed with Rhodamine-B. Rhodamine-B is a red dye that increases
the quantum efficiency of the photochemical conversion of oil into oxidized products.
In Table 21.3, the differences in change of the compositions of a crude oil by
various methods of pretreatment is shown.
21.2.6 BIOTREATED EMULSION
Another pretreatment method to enhance the stability of a water-in-oil emulsion
consists in of biotreating the oil prior to emulsification. Water-in-oil emulsions made
from a biotreated oil exhibits an enhanced stability. Oil-degrading microbes are used
in the biotreatment process [78].
Preparation 21–2: For the biotreatment of the oil, the oil is placed into a bioreactor.
Water in an 10- to 100-fold excess should be present in the reactor. Oil-degrading
microbes, e.g., inoculum are then added to the reactor. Inoculum is a culture of microbes.

The concentration of microbes in the inoculum can be measured by colony forming units.
The oil-degrading microbes can be obtained from an oil waste water treatment facility.
Nutrients can be provided to feed the microbes. The nutrients will preferably contain
nitrogen and phosphorous. The bioreactor is purged with air or oxygen. at a temperature
of 20-70 ◦C.
After the biotreatment step, the biotreated oil can be separated from the aqueous
phase of the bioreaction prior to forming a water-in-oil emulsion with the biotreated oil.
However, it is preferred to form an emulsion using both the biotreated oil and the aqueous
phase of the bioreaction as the aqueous phase contains components that will help further
enhance the stability of the resulting water-in-oil emulsion.
It is believed that the biotreatment step promotes an enhanced stability of a water￾in-oil emulsion according to the following mechanisms [78]:
• Some of the aliphatic components of oil are oxidized and polar ketones or acid
functionality are introduced on the aliphatic chain. Organo sulfur compounds are
also susceptible to oxidization and can form corresponding sulfoxides. The
oxygenated compounds are more surface active than the aliphatic components
themselves and thus contribute to improving the stability of the water-in-oil
emulsion.
• If naphthenic acids are present as salts of divalent cations like calcium,
biooxidation is likely to convert these salts to decarboxylated naphthenic
hydrocarbons or lower carbon number naphthenic acids and the corresponding
metal oxide. These constituents serve to enhance the stability of the water-in-oil
emulsion.
• In the process of biotreating oil, the aqueous phase of the bioreaction also
undergoes substantial changes. Upon completion of the bioreaction, the aqueous
phase is a dispersion of biosurfactants, i.e., rhammanolipids produced by the
microbes, and dead microbe cells. These components act synergistically to
enhance the stability of water-in-oil emulsions. The aqueous phase of the
bioreaction may therefore be used to make the water-in-oil emulsion, and serve
to further enhance the stability of the resulting emulsion.
21.2.7 BIOCONCENTRATION FACTOR OF LINEAR ALCOHOL
ETHOXYLATES
Determination of the potential of surfactants to bioaccumulate in marine species has
long been problematic in the chemical-hazard and environmental impact assessments
performed for offshore operations [79]. Recently, this issue has become increasingly
significant because regulators have invoked the precautionary principle and assume
that all surfactants with molecular weight of less than 700 will bioaccumulate, lead￾ing to an increased number of oilfield-chemical products labeled as environmentally
unacceptable.922 CHAPTER 21 Dispersions, emulsions, and foams
A method for estimating the bioconcentration potential from the octanol water
partition coefficients has been presented already in 1983 [80]. The BCF is the most
commonly used as indicator of its tendency to accumulate in aquatic organisms
from the surrounding medium [81]. Because it is expensive to measure, the BCF
is generally estimated from the octanol/water partition coefficient, but currently used
regression equations were developed from small data sets that do not adequately
represent the wide range of chemical substances now subject to review.
The relationship between the bioconcentration factor (BCF) of nonsurfactant
substances and their corresponding octanol/water partition coefficient value is well
studied, and many relationships have been developed.
However, this methodology cannot be applied directly to surfactants because
the formal octanol/water partition coefficient of such substances is difficult, if not
impossible, to determine accurately. By their very nature, surfactants tend to form
emulsions or accumulate at interfaces. Therefore, the standard OECD 107 cannot
be used.
A simple method for accurately determining the BCF of linear alcohol ethoxylates
has been described [79].
Structure-activity relationships have been used to calculate a preliminary param￾eter. This hydrophobic parameter has been then correlated to BCF values determined
in flow-through experiments, with an excellent agreement. This method involves no
animal testing, is inexpensive to set up and perform, is accessible to all, quick and
easy to use and verify, and gives clear results [79].
Partition coefficient ( n-octanol/water) using shake flask method
The partition coefficient of n-octanol and water can be determined by OECD
standards Test No. 107 and Test No. 117. The test guideline describes a method to
determine experimentally Pow values in the range log Pow between -2 and 4 [82].
The method can not be used with surface active materials. The partition coefficient
is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium concentrations of a dissolved substance in
a two-phase system consisting of two largely immiscible solvents. There are three
runs with different volume ratio of n-octanol to water. Duplicate vessels containing
accurately measured amounts of the two solvents and stock solution are used in all
three runs. After agitation the separation of the two phases, in general, is achieved by
centrifugation. It is necessary to determine the concentrations of the test substance
in both phases. Analytical methods which may be appropriate are: photometry, gas
chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography. The total quantity of
substance present in both phases should be calculated and compared with the quantity
originally introduced [82]. Also, the HPLC method permits to determine the partition
coefficient n-octanol to water (Pow) [83].
High-pressure hydrocarbon systems
In order to emulate the low interfacial tensions often experienced in high-pressure
hydrocarbon systems, the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as model fluid has been
studied. It has been described, how the CO2 system behaves the conditions of21.2 Emulsions 923
saturation [84]. The results show that it is possible to obtain streams of droplets for
droplet experiments. The mean diameter in the studied regime with the particular
nozzle used was on the order of 100 μ m, while the smallest droplets possible to
track with the presented technique were approximately 40 μ m.
21.2.8 SHALE INHIBITION
In order to prevent bit balling and sloughing off of shale, it is necessary to provide
shale stabilization. It is possible to provide shale stabilization by using a high
concentration of an inorganic salt in the dispersed phase.
Clay chemistry has shown that cationic base exchange with the negatively charged
clay minerals commonly found in shale formations, limits their ability to hydrate,
soften, and swell, thereby rendering them more stable in the presence of water￾based fluids and reducing or preventing screen blinding. Unfortunately, concentrated
solutions of inorganic salts are toxic.
As an alternative, organic amines have been proposed as shale inhibitors. These
are selected from substituted or unsubstituted triethanolamines, diaminocyclohex￾anes, and hexamethylene diamines [85].
21.2.9 TRANSPORTATION
Water-external emulsions can be transported in pipelines to achieve higher net flow
rates of oil than in the transport of dry oil alone [86]. The percentage of oil in
water may vary between 70 and 80%. The oil is combined with an aqueous solution
comprising water, a pH enhancing agent, and solid particles and mixed until the
solids-stabilized oil-in-water emulsion is formed. The pH of the resulting oil-in-water
emulsion should be at 7.5-10.
In propagating the emulsion through a pipe it is preferred to contact the inner
walls of the pipe at first with a wettability altering agent to make the inner walls
of the pipe water-wet so to facilitate the propagation of the oil-in-water emulsion.
After contacting the inner walls of the pipe with the wettability altering agent, the
oil-in-water emulsion can be pumped through the pipe.
High-oil content, solids-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions are therefore good
candidates for transportation in pipelines using flow regimes of either self-lubricating
core annular flow or as uniform, lower-viscosity water-external emulsions [86]. In
core annular flow, the formation of a low-viscosity annulus near the pipe wall, further
reduces pressure drop.
The viscosity of water, i.e., the continuous phase, is not greatly affected by
temperature. Therefore, the viscosity of a solids-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions
is not greatly affected by the temperature, and such oil-in-water emulsions do not
have to be heated to high temperatures to maintain an acceptably low viscosity for
economical transport.924 CHAPTER 21 Dispersions, emulsions, and foams
Another benefit of the oil-in-water emulsion is that the oil phase does not tend
to wet the steel. Thus, these emulsions will have fewer tendencies to wet or foul the
pipeline walls than oil-external emulsions or dry oil [86].
21.2.10 ACID-RICH OILS
Crude oils produced from the North Sea, from the Far East, and from Western
Africa exhibit high total acid numbers. In addition, they have high concentrations
of naphthenic acids [87]. Such crude oils may form calcium naphthenate precipitates
or naphthenate stabilized emulsions.
Naphthenates can act as natural surfactants leading either to stabilized emulsions
or solid deposits following complexation with certain cations present in the aqueous
phase. Naphthenate inhibitors include strong acids that protonate the rather weak
naphthenic acids [87].
21.2.11 CHARACTERIZATION OF EMULSIONS
Hansen solubility parameters
For preparing emulsions and in general to estimate the miscibility, the Hansen
solubility parameters may be useful [88,89]. The Hansen solubility parameters are
an extension of the Hildebrand solubility parameters [90].
For a certain molecule, three Hansen parameters are needed, which have a
physical dimension as Pa1/2, which is an energy density.
The distance Ra of two solvents 1 and 2, δi = δi,1 − δi,2 between Hansen
parameters is
Ra2 = 4(δd)
2 + (δp)
2 + (δh)
2 (21.1)
δd is the energy density from dispersion bonds between molecules, δp is the
energy from dipolar intermolecular force between molecules, and δh is the energy
from hydrogen bonds between molecules.
Further, a radius of interaction R0 is needed. A pair of compounds is soluble, if
Ra
R0
> 1.
The solubility parameter of a liquid mixture is proportional to the amount of each
liquid assuming the two liquids are completely miscible.
The solubility parameters can be determined by the measurement of the solubility,
similar to the Hildebrand parameters. Several solvents are chosen and trials of the sol￾ubility of a substance with unknown Hansen solubility parameters are done. Another
method of access of the solubility parameters is by inverse gas chromatography [91].21.2 Emulsions 925
Solubility parameters are compiled in Perry’s standard tables [92]. Examples for
the use of the Hansen solubility parameters in petroleum applications are presented
elsewhere [93–95].
Micro-percolation test
Unstable emulsions will eventually form two separate macroscopic phases, i.e., an
oil emulsion phase and a water phase. The stability of an emulsion can be assessed
by the flow through porous media in a rapid and convenient assay [78].
A sample of an emulsion that would pass completely through porous media can
be centrifuged to form two distinct phases. The respective volumes can be used as a
measure of the stability of an emulsion. The emulsion is as more unstable as is greater
the proportion of water that forms a clear phase after passing the porous medium and
after subsequent centrifugation.
The brine-breakout is defined as the fraction of the water or brine that is in the
emulsion and that forms a distinct separate aqueous phase. The brine-breakout ranges
between one, indicating completely unstable and zero, maximally stable. Details of
the procedure have been presented elsewhere [78].
Field bottle test
Oilfield emulsions are often characterized using the field bottle test [96]. This test
has been used already in the 1950 [97]. Experimental details of this test have been
described [98,99]. However, the test is not standardized. So the bottle test does not
strictly prescribe a procedure that can be used as such for studying all cases of
emulsions [100].
Manning and Thompson have given the following procedure [99].
1. get the sample in a 5 gal can with a screw cap.
2. drain off all free water.
3. shake the can and determine sediments and water of the emulsion.
4. number the appropriate quantity of eight precipitation bottles.
5. add 100 ml of emulsion, normal emulsion breaker and revers emulsion
breakers to each bottle.
6. heat to the treating temperature, place the bottles into a shaker and shake for 3
min.
7. place into a thermostat and start the timer.
8. after the required time, read the water breakout in each bottle.
9. with a syringe remove some o the oil.
10. analysis of the oil.
By coupling the data obtained from field bottle test and data that characterize the
samples themselves, it is possible to gain insight into the factors that describe and are
responsible for the stability of the emulsion.
Since a lot of variables flow into the analysis, the method is considered as
multivariate. A broad spectrum of oils has been characterized using 18 different
parameters. Statistical analysis of the data sets has been performed. In order to predict926 CHAPTER 21 Dispersions, emulsions, and foams
the stability of an emulsion, it has been found that the solid content, but not the
asphaltene content or any other crude oil parameter is the best single predictor for the
stability of an emulsion. Statistical analysis reveals that the stability of an emulsion
is most aptly described using several crude oil parameters, as opposed to one single
factor [101,102].
Separation index
In order to characterize emulsions, the emulsion separation index has been developed.
This index has been used for selecting and screening demulsifiers.
The fraction of the total water separated in a regular bottle test using different
demulsifier dosages is averaged to determine a separation index. The separation index
ranges from zero with no separation up to 100%, which indicates full separation.
So the separation yields a measure of the stability of an emulsion. As lower the
index, as greater is the tightness or stability of the emulsion. The conditions of test
must be given, i.e., in particular the temperature of testing and the nature of demulsi￾fier system. Details, how to conduct a separation test have been given by Kokal [63].
Procedure 21–3: After delivery of the crude oil sample in the laboratory, the samples are
remixed with a standard bottle shaker for 1 min. The sample is added to 100 ml standard
centrifuge tubes, which are placed into a water bath to reach the desired temperature for
30 min. Then, the chemical to be tested (demulsifier) is added to the centrifuge tubes. The
tubes are shaken and again placed in the water bath. After some predefined time intervals,
e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20 min, the amount of water separated is controlled. After 20 min the tubes
are centrifuged and the final amount of water separated is measured.
The emulsion separation index I is then calculated by
I =
w
wfn × 100. (21.2)
Here, w is the water separation at a given demulsifier concentration as the percentage
of basic sediment and water after a certain time interval, i.e., it runs from 5, 10, 15,
20 min and final wf. n is the number of readings of the water content, here totally 5,
i.e., reading after 5, 10, 15, 20 min and final wf.
Examples how to evaluate the emulsion separation index have been presented
[63]. Using the separation index, the effect of various factors can be elucidated that
affect the oil-water separation, including
• temperature,
• shear,
• asphaltene content,
• watercut,
• demulsifier dosage, and
• mixing different crude oil types.21.2 Emulsions 927
The use of the emulsion separation index has in fact eliminated some of the
previous mysterious art associated with the selection of a demulsifier and diagnosing
emulsion treatment problems.
Field case studies have been described, where the emulsion separation index
was used to select the best demulsifier, diagnose, and ultimately solve emulsion
related problems during oil production. The results show a strong correlation of
asphaltene content in the crude oil with emulsion separation index or emulsion
tightness. Recommendations can be made for reducing and optimizing the dosage
of the demulsifier by adding other chemicals [62].
Differential scanning calorimetry
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is generally used to determine the composi￾tion of water-in-oil emulsions, as it can distinguish free water from emulsified water
[103,104]. Namely, free water crystallizes at higher temperatures than water droplets
in the emulsion.
This technique is based on the solidification and melting properties of droplets
and of the medium in which they are dispersed. The data obtained DSC give
information about [66]:
• the type of emulsion: simple (water-in-oil or oil-in-water) or multiple
(water-in-oil-in-water, or oil-in-water-in-oil respectively),
• the quantity of liquid and its state: bound or dispersed or free,
• the compositions of the free and dispersed forms,
• the mean diameter of the droplets and their evolution with time due to
coalescence or Ostwald ripening, and
• matter transfers between droplets due to their compositional differences.
Stability of invert emulsions
Stability of Invert Emulsions can be tested according by the following proce￾dures [85]:
Procedure 21–4: A small portion of the emulsion is placed in a beaker which contains
an oleaginous fluid. If the emulsion is an invert emulsion, the small portion will disperse
in the oleaginous fluid. Visual inspection determines whether the small portion added has
dispersed.
The electrical stability of the invert emulsion can be tested as follows:
Procedure 21–5: A voltage is applied across two electrodes immersed in the emulsion,
and the voltage is increased until the emulsion breaks and a surge of current flows between
the two electrodes. The voltage required to break the emulsion is a common measure of
the stability of an emulsion.928 CHAPTER 21 Dispersions, emulsions, and foams
21.2.12 LOW-FLUORESCENT EMULSIFIERS
Citric acid-based poly(amide) (PA) type emulsifiers for drilling applications have
been developed that exhibit a very low fluorescence.
PAs are conventionally prepared by first reacting a fatty acid with diethylene
triamine in order to form the amide. Afterwards the amide is reacted with citric
acid. These products exhibit a relatively high fluorescence. The reaction is shown in
Figure 21.5.
On the other hand, a PA with pendent citric acid units can be made via a cyclic
intermediate, an imidazoline structure. This is followed by ring opening to yield an
isomeric amide. The reaction is shown in Figure 21.6.
The products synthesized via the reaction shown in Figure 21.6 exhibit a much
lower fluorescence. Discharged fluids having low fluorescence are less likely to
impart a sheen to the ocean’s surface [105]. In this way, discharge operations will
become less obvious.

21.3 FOAMS
A foam is a liquid with gas cells enclosed. The first scientist deeply engaged with
foams was Joseph A. F. Plateau, whose monograph appeared in 1783 [106]. Foams
find use in
• foam drilling,
• foam cementing,930 CHAPTER 21 Dispersions, emulsions, and foams
• foam flooding,
• Foam-based fracturing, and
• water shutoff.
According to thermodynamics, in a spherical bubble there is an excess pressure
p, which is related according to the law of Young to the radius r and the surface
tension σ as
p = σ
r
. (21.3)
21.3.1 APHRONS
An aphron is a phase that is surrounded by a tenside like film, e.g., a soap bubble.
The term originates from the Greek αφρoσ for foam. The topic has been described
by Sebba, who obviously coined the term [107,108]. Aphrons have been also termed
as biliquid foams. In short, an aphron is a foam, where the liquid skin is built up
from two phases. So, in contrast to a conventional air bubble, which is stabilized by
a surfactant monolayer, the outer shell of an aphron consists of a much more robust
surfactant tri-layer.
Colloidal gas aphrons as proposed by Sebba are made up from a gaseous inner
core surrounded by a thin aqueous surfactant film composed of two surfactant layers.
In addition, there is a third surfactant layer that stabilizes the structure [109]. The
basic structure of a colloidal gas aphron is shown in Figure 21.7.
Core
Shell
Double layer
Bulk phase : Surfactant
FIGURE 21.7
Basic structure of an aphron [109].21.3 Foams 931
The aphron includes a spherical core, which is usually a gas. This gas is
encapsulated in a thin shell. This shell contains surfactant molecules. The surfactants
point with their hydrophobic, i.e., nonpolar ends into the gas core. The hydrophilic
ends point into a second phase, that may be water that contains a thickening agent
and an aphron stabilizer. In addition, the second phase contains surfactant molecules
at the outer boundary. These molecules are pointing with their hydrophobic ends into
the third outer phase. The third phase also contains an additional layer of surfactant
molecules whose hydrophilic ends extend into the bulk fluid.
Thus, the surrounding phase is a bilayer of surfactant molecules, which serves
as an effective barrier to coalescence with adjacent aphrons. It is believed that the
exterior surfactant layer is not strongly associated with the rest of the aphron that may
be shed when aphrons come into contact with each other so that they agglomerate
rather than coalesce. The surfactant molecules are not necessarily built up from the
same material. In other words, each surfactant layer may be comprised of different
types of surfactants [110]. Colloidal gas aphrons are of interest, because they [109]:
• have a comparatively large interfacial area,
• exhibit a relatively high stability,
• show similar flow properties to those of pure water, and
• can be easily separated from the bulk liquid phase.
Aphrons can survive a compression to at least 27.3 M Pa (4000 psig), whereas
conventional bubbles do not survive pressures much higher than a tenth of that
[111]. An apparatus for investigating the survivability of aphron bubbles under high
pressure has been designed [112, p. 35]. Two viewing cells simultaneously record
the size and the concentration of bubbles before and after filtration through a sintered
metal filter.
Aphrons are of importance in fluids used for oilfield applications [111,113]. The
first use of aphrons in a drilling fluid application has been described in 1998 [114].
When a drilling fluid migrates into a loss zone, aphrons move faster than the
surrounding liquid phase and quickly form a layer of bubbles at the front of the fluid.
This bubble front and the radial flow pattern of the fluid rapidly reduce the shear rate
and raise the fluid viscosity, resulting in diminishing the invasion of the fluid.
Further, aphrons exhibit only little affinity for each other or for the mineral
surfaces of the pores or fractures. Consequently, the sealings which they form are
soft. Their lack of adhesion enables them to be flushed out easily whenever desired
[111]. The aphrons reduce the density of a drilling fluid and provide bridging
and sealing of the formations contacted by the fluid as the bubbles expand to
fill the openings exposed while drilling. Low shear rate polymers strengthen the
microbubbles and act as fluid loss agents [115]. In this way, lost circulation is
prevented.
Moreover, the IFT between the base fluid and produced oils or gases is low. So
the fluids have no tendency to formation damage. Depleted wells, which are very
expensive to drill underbalanced or with other remediation techniques, have been
drilled overbalanced with the aid of aphron drilling fluids [111].932 CHAPTER 21 Dispersions, emulsions, and foams
In a foam of the water-lamella type small globules of oil are encapsulated in a
surfactant-stabilized film and separated from one another by a further thin lamella of
water. Biliquid foams are essentially of two types [107]:
• oil lamella and
• water lamella.
An oil lamella biliquid foam consists of aqueous cells coated with an oil film and
separated one from another by an oil lamella. In this type, the oil phase corresponds to
the aqueous phase in a conventional gas foam, and the water globules correspond to
the gas cells. The second type of biliquid foam is one in which the discontinuous
phase is the oil or a nonpolar liquid and the encapsulating phase is water or a
hydrogen-bonded liquid which contains a soluble surfactant. The encapsulating film
as well as the foam lamella are stabilized by the surfactant. In both types, the cells
are held together by capillary pressures, just as are the soap bubbles in a gas foam.
A water-lamella biliquid foam must be distinguished from oil-in-water emulsions in
which the discontinuous oil phase is separated from the continuous aqueous phase
by a single interface.
At moderate gas concentrations, the stability of bubbles in an aqueous medium
depends primarily on the viscosity of the bulk fluid and the IFT. More specifically, the
stability is determined by the rate of mass transfer between the viscous water shell
and the bulk phase. This transfer is known as Marangoni convection [116]. Carlo
Marangoni, published his results in 1865 in the course of his doctoral thesis at the
University of Pavia.
If, by some disturbing effects, e.g. a temperature gradient, a gradient in the surface
tension is locally induced, a convection or movement of liquid will occur. Thus, the
Marangoni convection contributes to the decomposition of foams. If the mass transfer
rate is high, aphrons will become unstable. Therefore, the shell fluid must be designed
to have certain viscosity to minimize the Marangoni effect [116].
Bulk viscosity is generally controlled by the addition of polymers and clays. The
IFT is usually lowered with a surfactant. In contrast to a typical bubble, an aphron is
stabilized by a very high interfacial viscosity of the second phase [115].
Fluids with a low share rate viscosity are helpful in controlling the invasion of a
filtrate by creating an impermeable layer close to the formation openings.
Since the fluid moves at a very slow rate, the viscosity becomes very high, and
the depth of invasion of the fluid into the formation is kept shallow.
Specific aphron stabilizers are PVA in combination with surfactants, such as
cocamidopropyl betaine or an alkyl ether sulfate [110]. The aphron stabilizer
modifies the viscosity of the water layer to such an extent that it creates an elastomeric
membrane. This elastomeric membrane allows the aphrons to display an improved
stability and sealing capability.
The surfactants required to create the aphrons must be compatible with the
polymers present in the fluid to create the desired low shear rate viscosity. Therefore,
the surfactants will generally be of the non-ionic or anionic type [115]. A series of
surfactants have been screened using a low pressure API filtration cell [117].21.3 Foams 933
Test procedure 21–6: The cylindrical body of the cell is made from plexiglas of a
thickness 0.5 in (1.3 cm). Two hundred grams of sand is added with a particle size of
50-70 mesh (210-297 μm). In this way, a sand bed depth of 2.1 cm is obtained. No filter
paper is used in the cell. 350 ml of the fluid to be tested is slowly added to the cell, the
cell assembled, and a pressure of nitrogen of 0.7 M Pa (100 psi) is applied. The pressure
is released after the nitrogen blows through the bed for 30 s. Upon releasing the pressure
the sand bed will expand in height as the bubbles in the sand bed expand. The average
increase in height of the bed is measured. Surfactants which increase the sand bed by at
least 50% are considered to be preferred for the generation of aphrons [115].
The average percent increase in height of the sand bed is given in Table 21.4,
tested according to test procedure 21–6.
The effects of polymer and surfactant concentration, surfactant type, shear rate,
mixing time and water quality on the bubble size of colloidal gas aphrons have been
studied [116].
Several other tests suitable to characterize aphrons have been described in detail,
including [112]:
• survivability of bubbles under high pressure,
• disk leak-off test,
• syringe sand pack leak-off test, and
• capillary flow test.

22 Defoamers
Defoaming compositions are commonly used in the oil and gas industry to prevent
the formation of foam, hinder the entrainment of a gas in a liquid, or to break a
previously formed foam. Defoaming is necessary in several industrial branches and
is often a key factor for efficient operation. A review on defoamers has been given by
Owen [1].
22.1 THEORY OF DEFOAMING
22.1.1 STABILITY OF FOAMS
Foams are thermodynamically unstable but are prevented from collapsing by the
following properties:
• surface elasticity,
• viscous drainage,
• reduced gas diffusion between bubbles, and
• thin-film stabilization effects from the interaction of opposite surfaces.
The stability of a foam can be explained by the Gibbs elasticity E. The Gibbs
elasticity results from reducing the surface concentration of the active molecules in
equilibrium when the film is extended. This causes an increase in the equilibrium
surface tension σ, which acts as a restoring force.
E = 2A
dσ
dA (22.1)
A is the area of the surface. In a foam, where the surfaces are interconnected, the
time-dependent Marangoni effect is important. A restoring force corresponding to
the Gibbs elasticity will appear, because only a finite rate of absorption of the surface
active agent, which decreases the surface tension, can take place on the expansion
and contraction of a foam. Thus the Marangoni effect is a kinetic effect.
The surface tension effects under nonequilibrium conditions are described in
terms of dilatational moduli. The complex dilatational modulus ε of a single surface
is defined in the same way as the Gibbs elasticity. The factor 2 is not used in a single
surface.

941942 CHAPTER 22 Defoamers
In a periodic dilatational experiment, the complex elasticity module is a function
of the angular frequency:
ε(iω) = |ε| cos θ + i |ε|sin θ = εd(ω) + ωηd(ω). (22.3)
εd is the dilatational elasticity, and ηd is the dilatational viscosity. It is charac￾teristic for a stable foam to exhibit a high surface dilatational elasticity and a high
dilatational viscosity. Therefore, effective defoamers should reduce these properties
of the foam.
This has been verified for poly(dimethylsiloxane)s added to crude oils. The
effect of the dilatational elasticities and viscosities on crude oil by the addition of
poly(dimethylsiloxane)s is shown in Table 22.1. Under nonequilibrium conditions,
both a high bulk viscosity and a surface viscosity can delay the film thinning and the
stretching deformation, which precedes the destruction of a foam. There is another
issue that concerns the formation of ordered structures. The development of ordered
structures in the surface film may also stabilize the foams. Liquid crystalline phases
in surfaces enhance the stability of the foam.
If the gas diffusion between bubbles is reduced, the collapse of the bubbles is
delayed by retarding the bubble size changes and the resulting mechanical stresses.
Therefore, single films can persist longer than the corresponding foams. However,
this effect is of minor importance in practical situations. Electric effects, such as
double layers, form opposite surfaces of importance only for extremely thin films,
less than 10 nm. In particular, they occur with ionic surfactants.
22.1.2 ACTION OF DEFOAMERS
At high bulk viscosity, lowering the surface tension is not relevant for the mechanism
of stabilization of foams, but for all other mechanisms of foam stabilization a change
of the surface properties is essential. A defoaming agent will change the surface
properties of a foam upon activation. Most defoamers have a surface tension in the
range of 20-30 m N m−1. The surface tensions of some defoamers are shown in
Table 22.2.

Tributyl phosphate 25.1
Two related antifoam mechanisms have been proposed for low surface tensions
of certain defoamer formulations:
1. The defoamer is dispersed in fine droplets in the liquid. From the droplets, the
molecules may enter the surface of the foam. The tensions created by this
spreading result in the eventual rupture of the film.
2. Alternatively, it is suggested that the molecules will form a monolayer rather
than spreading. The monolayer has less coherence than the original monolayer
on the film and causes a destabilization of the film.
Spreading coefficient
The spreading coefficient is defined as the difference of the surface tension of the
foaming medium σf, the surface tension of the defoamer σd, and the interfacial
tension (IFT) of both materials σdf.
S = σf − σd − σdf (22.4)
It can be readily seen that the spreading coefficient S becomes increasingly
positive as the surface tension of the defoamer becomes smaller. This indicates the
thermodynamic tendency of defoaming.
The above statements are adequate for liquid defoamers that are insoluble in
the bulk. However, experience has proven that certain dispersed hydrophobic solids
can greatly enhance the effectiveness of defoaming. A strong correlation between
the effectiveness of a defoamer and the contact angle for silicone-treated silica in
hydrocarbons has been established [300]. It is believed that the dewetting process of
the hydrophobic silica causes the collapse of a foam by the direct mechanical shock
occurring by this process.
22.2 CLASSIFICATION OF DEFOAMERS
Defoamer formulations currently contain numerous ingredients to meet the diverse
requirements for which they are formulated. Various classification approaches are944 CHAPTER 22 Defoamers
possible, including classification by application, physical form of the defoamer, and
the chemical type of the defoamer. In general, defoamers contain a variety of active
ingredients, both in solid and in liquid states, and a number of ancillary agents such as
emulsifiers, spreading agents, thickeners, preservatives, carrier oils, compatibilizers,
solvents, and water.
22.2.1 ACTIVE INGREDIENTS
Active ingredients are the components of the formulation that control the actual
foaming. These may be liquids or solids.
Liquid components
Because lowering the surface tension is the most important physical property of a
defoamer, it is reasonable to classify the defoamer by the hydrophobic operation of
the molecule. In contrast, the classification of organic molecules by functional groups
are often polar and hydrophilic, i.e., alcohol, acid, and salt are common in basic
organic chemistry. Four classes of defoamers are known as liquid phase components:
• hydrocarbons,
• poly(ether)s,
• silicones, and
• fluorocarbons.
Synergistic antifoam action by solid particles
Often, dispersed solids are active in defoaming in suitable formulations. Some liquid
defoamers are believed to be active only in the presence of a solid. It is believed that
a surface active agent present in the system will carry the solid particles in the region
of the interface and the solid will cause a destabilization of the foam.
For example, a synergistic defoaming occurs when hydrophobic solid particles
are used in conjunction with a liquid that is insoluble in the foamy solution [3].
Mechanisms for film rupture by either the solid or the liquid alone have been
elucidated, along with explanations for the poor effectiveness, which are observed
with many foam systems for these single-component defoamers.
Silicone antifoaming agents
Poly(dimethylsiloxane) is active in nonaqueaous systems, but it shows little foam￾inhibiting effect in aqueous systems. However, when it is compounded with a
hydrophobic-modified silica, a highly active defoamer emerges.
Several factors contribute to the dual nature of silicone defoamers. For example,
soluble silicones can concentrate at the air-oil interface to stabilize bubbles, while
dispersed drops of silicone can accelerate the coalescence process by rapidly
spreading at the gas-liquid interface of a bubble, causing film thinning by surface
transport [4].22.3 Uses in petroleum technology 945
Silicones exhibit an apparently low solubility in different oils. In fact, there is
actually a slow rate of dissolution that depends on the viscosity of the oil and the
concentration of the dispersed drops. The mechanisms of the critical bubble size and
the reason for a significantly faster coalescence at a lower concentration of silicone
can be explained in terms of the higher interfacial mobility, as can be measured by
the bubble rise velocities.
22.2.2 ANCILLARY AGENTS
In addition to the defoamer itself, certain ancillary chemicals are incorporated into
the formulation, for example, to effect emulsification or to enhance the dispersion in
the original formulation.
Surface active components
Emulsifiers are essential in oil-water emulsion systems. For example, oil-in-water
emulsifiers are used to promote the dispersion in aqueous foaming systems.
Carriers
The formulation of a defoamer should be suitable for a prolonged storage time
before use. A carrier system makes the defoamer easy to handle and dispersible
for delivering the active defoamer components to the foaming system and also to
stabilize the defoaming formulation.
Often, carriers are organic solvents with low viscosity. Aliphatic hydrocarbons
are most commonly used as carriers. The carrier itself may also exhibit defoaming
properties. Water is often used as carrier fluid. Here the defoamer formulation is
typically an oil-in-water emulsion.
22.3 USES IN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY
Defoamers are used in oil extraction, such as in drilling muds and cementation, and
also directly with crude oil itself.
22.3.1 ALKYL ACRYLATE COPOLYMERS
A method of inhibiting the formation of foam or defoaming crude oil includes the
step of adding an effective amount of the copolymer based on alkyl acrylate to
gasified crude oils with densities from 10◦ API to 40◦ API, and at concentrations
between 10 and 2000 ppm based on the amount of crude oil, in order to inhibit the
formation of foam [5]. The copolymer can have a molecular weight of 1-180 kD. The
copolymers can be obtained from monomers that are collected in Table 22.3.
The crude oil contains a dissolved gas where the copolymer is added in an amount
to prevent or inhibit foaming during degasification or processing of the crude oil that
can cause the dissolved gas to separate from the crude oil. The defoaming agent that946 CHAPTER 22 Defoamers

The formulation can be combined with the crude oil in an amount of 10-2000 ppm
based on the amount of the crude oil. Furthermore, the formulation can be combined
in an amount of about 100-500 ppm based on the amount of crude oil [5].
22.3.2 HIGH MOLAR MASS POLYETHERS
The presence of foam may cause problems in gas-liquid separators and its com￾plete elimination, by employing a silicon-free defoamer agent, poses a significant
challenge [6].
A series of high molar mass polyethers were synthesized using different epoxide
monomers (1,2-propylene oxide, 1,2-butylene oxide, 1,2-hexylene oxide, and 1,2-
dodecylene oxide), by varying their molar masses from 10 to 120 kg mol−1. The
monomers are shown in Figure 22.1.

The synthesis was performed with an anionic ring-opening polymerization using
as an initiation system an ammonium salt and triisobutylaluminum as a complexing
agent and monomer activator.
All the polymers were characterized by 1H NMR, SEC, and TGA, experimentally
evaluated as defoamer agents of gasified heavy crude oil (13.08◦ API), and compared
to a silicon-based defoamer.
The results of the study revealed that poly(1,2-butylene oxide) and poly(1,2-
hexylene oxide) with molar masses above 80 kg mol−1 show a high activity as foam
suppressors, similar to that of commercial silicon-based defoamer agents [6].
22.4 LOST CIRCULATION MATERIALS
22.4.1 AGRO-WASTE MATERIALS
New lost circulation materials were developed from agro-waste materials, which are
orange peel and sunflower seed [7]. The lost circulation materials were prepared in
three different sizes: fine, medium, and coarse, and also with different concentrations
ranging from 0.8% to 4%.
The performance of the drilling fluid with these lost circulation materials was
tested in terms of rheological and filtration properties. The apparent viscosities for
orange peel and sunflower seed samples are shown in Table 22.4.
The results in Table 22.4 show that as the sizes of the lost circulation materials are
increased, the values of the apparent viscosities reduce for all concentrations, when
the mud weight remains constant [7].

4.00 27.5 23 27 21948 CHAPTER 22 Defoamers
The results were compared with the commercial lost circulation material that has
been used in the industry, which is nut plug. The results showed that a drilling fluid
with the finest size and a high concentration yielded a good filtration control.
From these results, the two best sizes were chosen, combined, mixed, and tested.
The chosen sizes were fine and medium. This new combination of the lost circulation
material gave even better results compared to the fine-sized and high-concentration
lost circulation material [7].
Therefore, it can be concluded that to ensure good filtration control, the lost
circulation materials could be combined together since the combination of different
sizes minimizes the pores created in the mud cake, helping to reduce the potential of
loss circulation problems [7].
22.4.2 RESIN-COATED SOLID PARTICULATE
A method of reducing fluid loss may consist of pumping a wellbore fluid with a resin￾coated solid particulate into a wellbore having fractures therein [8]. The resin-coated
solid particulate can form a substantially impermeable plug in the fractures.
The solid particulate is a plant-based material, an inorganic material, a carbon￾based material, or mixtures from these materials [8]. Suitable examples of particulate
materials for use as lost circulation materials are listed in Table 22.5.
The resin for coating is a phenol-formaldehyde resin or an epoxy resin [8]. The
phenol-formaldehyde resin has a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol (F:P) from a
low value of about 0.6:1 to a high value of about 2.8:1. The epoxy resin can include
bisphenol A, bisphenol F, aliphatic, or glycidylamine epoxy resins, and any mixtures
or combinations thereof. Here, also more than one resin system may be used, such as

a first resin system being used as a cured undercoat, and a second system being used
as a curable or partially cured overcoat.
The resin coating can improve the attrition rate of the lost circulation material
because the resin coating makes the lost circulation material more resistant to the
grinding and other forces experienced during wellbore operations. Furthermore, the
resin coating may help a lost circulation material that absorbs/adsorbs fluid more
mechanically strong than an uncoated lost circulation material.
The resin-coated solid particulates may be capable of forming a seal/plug that
allows up to 25% less fluid loss, or up to 35-45% less fluid loss before a complete
failure of the seal/plug occurs [8].
22.4.3 SHAPE MEMORY POLYMERS
Despite extensive advances in the last couple of decades, lost circulation materials
used today still have disadvantages such as damaging production zones, failing to
seal large fractures, or plugging drilling tools [9].
A new class of smart expandable lost circulation material has been proposed to
control remotely the expanding force and functionality of the injected lost circulation
material. This smart lost circulation material is made from anionic shape memory
polymers that become activated by the natural heat in the formation [9,10].
Once activated, these particles can effectively seal the width of the fractures
without damaging pores in the production zone or plugging drilling tools. The
activation temperature of the proposed lost circulation material can be adjusted based
on the temperature of the formation [9].
22.4.4 FIBER SUSPENDING AGENT
Suspending agents can be used to distribute insoluble particles uniformly throughout
a base fluid [11]. It has been found that fibers can be added to a treatment fluid as a
suspending agent for lost circulation materials. The suspending agent may consist of
a plurality of fibers, wherein the fibers have a length to diameter aspect ratio of about
100:1 to about 5000:1, and the fibers have a distribution such that at least 90% of the
fibers have a length in the range of about 5-25 mm.
The fibers can be in dry form or in a liquid suspension. The fibers can be
natural, synthetic, biodegradable, and/or biocompatible. Examples of synthetic fibers
include polymers or copolymers composed of polypropylene, polyaramid, polyester,
polyacrylonitrile, and polyvinyl alcohol. Examples of biodegradable fibers include
fibers composed of modified cellulose, chitosan, soya, modified chitosan, polycapro￾lactone, polylactic acid, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), polyhydroxy-alkanoates, polyg￾lycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyorthoesters, polycarbonates, polyaspartic acid,
polyphosphoesters, soya, or copolymers thereof. Examples of other suitable fibers
include fibers of cellulose including viscose cellulosic fibers, oil-coated cellulosic
fibers, and fibers derived from a plant product like paper fibers, carbon including
carbon fibers, melt-processed inorganic fibers including basalt fibers, wollastonite950 CHAPTER 22 Defoamers
fibers, nonamorphous metallic fibers, ceramic fibers, and glass fibers. The fibers can
also be a composite fiber made from any combination of the preceding materials.
There can also be a mixture of fibers wherein the fibers are composed of different
substances [11].
A commercially available example of suitable fibers is BAROLIFT, a sweeping
agent, marketed by Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., which is a synthetic fiber [11].
22.4.5 CELLULOSIC FIBERS
Composites used for lost circulation contain a thermoplastic polymer and cellulosic
fibers have been developed [12].
It is important that the polymer and fiber are combined into a composite material,
and are not just a simple mixture. A composite is an engineered, solid-phase material
made from two or more constituent materials with significantly different physical
or chemical properties, in which the constituents remain separate and distinct
on a macroscopic level within the finished, solid-phase structure. Optionally, the
composites may also include additional components.
Preferred composites are extruded blends of cellulosic fibers, a thermoplastic
polymer matrix, calcium carbonate, and clay. The calcium carbonate can increase
the density of the materials as well as adding rigidity. Optionally, the composites
may also include oil and other blending agents or bonding agents to modify the
performance characteristics (e.g., rigidity, swelling, lubrication) or material handling
properties [12].
The thermoplastic polymer forms a matrix to bind the other components into
composite particles. The thermoplastic polymer may be any of the various ther￾moplastic materials known in the art, virgin or recycled, common or engineering
polymer. Examples of such polymers are listed in Table 22.6.
An example for the preparation is done as follows [12]:
Preparation 22–1: A thermoplastic cellulosic-fiber blend was made from recycled, film￾grade, low-density poly(ethylene) (38% by mass), a 20-mesh wood pine fiber from Amer￾ican Wood Fiber Company, Madison, WI (40% by mass), precipitated calcium carbonate
(Domino Sugar Corp., Chalmette, LA) with a mean diameter of about 20 μm (20% by
mass), and 2% by mass blending agents (maleated poly(ethylene), PE-g-MA, G-2608,
Eastman Chemical Company, Kingsport, TN). The compounding was performed with a
counter-rotating, twin screw extruder, CTSE-V/MARKII (C.W. Brabender Instruments
Inc., South Gackensack, NJ), operated at 50 rpm at a temperature profile along the length
of the extruder barrel of 140, 160, 170, and 170 ◦C. The extrudates were quenched in a
cold water bath and then granulated into particulate form.
Lost-circulation solutions may be classified into three principal categories [13]:
1. bridging agents;
2. surface-mixed systems; and
3. downhole-mixed systems.22.4 Lost circulation materials 951

Bridging agents, also known as lost-circulation materials, are solids of various
sizes and shapes, for example, granular, lamellar, fibrous, and mixtures thereof.
It has been discovered that fibers sized with lipophilic coupling agents or
lipophilic film-forming polymers demonstrate an improved compatibility with and
dispersibility in nonaqueous fluids [13]. The nonaqueous fluids may comprise oil￾base fluids, synthetic-base fluids, invert-emulsion-base fluids, and combinations
thereof. Fibers that can be used here are shown in Table 22.7.
Fibers made from poly(propylene), polyamide, glass, and alkali-resistant glass
are preferred [13]. Alkali-resistant glass fibers are particularly preferred. The fibers
have most preferably a length between 10 and 17 mm. In the case of alkali-resistant
glass, the preferred fiber length is between about 10 and 15 mm.
Suitable lipophilic coupling agents are nonpolymeric compounds with alkyl
groups, aromatic groups, acetic anhydride, n-alkyl isocyanate, titanates, trichloro-952 CHAPTER 22 Defoamers

s-triazine, and organosilanes. Suitable lipophilic film-forming polymers are
poly(urethane)s, poly(styrene)s, poly(vinyl chloride)s, poly(olefin)s, poly(ester)s,
or epoxy resins [13].
For lost-circulation materials, one or more fibers that are sized with a lipophilic
coupling agent are selected. The fibers are mixed with a carrier fluid that comprises an
oil-base fluid, a synthetic-base fluid, an invert-emulsion-base fluid, or combinations
thereof.22.4 Lost circulation materials 953
The fibers may be mixed with carrier fluid in the surface equipment employed
to prepare drilling fluid. The resulting fluid containing fibers is pumped into the
subterranean lost-circulation zone. The fluid may be a drilling fluid, a spacer fluid, or
a lost-circulation pill of limited volume. Lost-circulation pills may not return to the
surface, thereby avoiding plugging surface equipment [13].
22.4.6 FIBERS
A treatment fluid has been described that contains [14]:
1. a base fluid;
2. a plurality of a degradable type of fiber;
3. a plurality of a second type of fiber; and
4. a lost-circulation material.
The suggested fibers are summarized in Table 22.8.
The additional lost-circulation materials that can be used are summarized in
Table 22.9.
For testing the effect of fibers, two different treatment fluids (A and B) were

Fibers no. 2 are 3 mm synthetic poly(propylene) fibers that were used as the second
type of fiber.
Fluid loss testing was performed at 24 ◦C and at a pressure of 6.9 MPa. The fluid
loss versus the slot width for the two fluids is shown in Table 22.11.
As can be seen from Table 22.11, Fluid B, which contained the second type of
fiber in addition to the first type of fiber, exhibited much less fluid loss compared
to Fluid A, which only contained the first type of fiber. This indicates that the
combination of two different types of fibers creates a better fluid to combat fluid22.4 Lost circulation materials 955

loss into a subterranean formation. As can also be seen, Fluid B had very low fluid
loss even with a large slot size [14].
22.4.7 CANE ASH
The sugar cane industry burns the fibrous remains of the sugar cane stalks after the
sugar has been extracted [15]. This process results in waste products. One of the
waste products is an ash which may be referred to as cane ash. This may be used as a
soil fertilizer or stored in a disposal site. The large quantities in which the cane ash is
produced may cause environmental problems related to waste disposal in areas near
the producing factories.
Cane ash can be used in lost circulation materials [15]. It may be mixed with other
types of lost circulation materials. The cane ash by itself is not settable and thus may
be inert when used in the various examples of the treatment fluids, provided that the
treatment fluids do not contain a component which may induce a settable reaction in
the cane ash, for example, hydrated lime. Cane ash is an inorganic material and may
prevent the spread of bacteria which may consume organic types of lost circulation
materials such as seed and nut shells. The cane ash should be inert and may be
used in drilling fluids, spacer fluids, cement slurries, etc. without interfering with
the functionality of those fluids. Furthermore, the cane ash may have a broad particle
size distribution which may enable it to bridge both large and small fractures. Thus,
the cane ash lost circulation material may be used in applications where bridging of
lost circulation zones is desired [15].
Once placed into the wellbore, the cane ash in the treatment fluid may bridge
the fracture or other openings. This process may control the loss of subsequently
pumped treatment fluids, allowing for continued applications, for example, drilling.
The treatment fluids disclosed herein may be used to control lost circulation problems
encountered with any fluids that may be placed into the wellbore, for example,
drilling fluids, cements, spacer fluids, completion fluids, or fracturing fluids [15].
A sample of cane ash was subjected to X-ray diffraction analysis. It was found
that cane ash is mostly quartz (74%) with lesser amounts of potassium feldspar (8%)
and sodium feldspar (14%).
Flow loop testing for two slot sizes for a treatment fluid comprising cane ash
has been performed. The treatment fluid was a cement comprising water at a
concentration of 5.56 gal sack−1 of cement and Texas Lehigh Class H Portland
cement. Cane ash was added at a concentration of 6 lbs sack−1 of cement. The cement956 CHAPTER 22 Defoamers

sack size was 94 lbs. Two slot sizes were measured. The slot had a width of 30 mm
and varied in height according to the testing parameters. The two slots used for the
present tests had heights of 1 and 2 mm. Additionally, the back pressure as described
earlier was measured as was the filter cake thickness of the filter cake formed by the
cane ash. The results are illustrated in Table 22.12.
The results presented in Table 22.12 indicate that cane ash may be used as an
effective lost-circulation material in a treatment fluid [15].
22.4.8 RED MUD
A typical alumina plant may produce one to two times as much red mud as alumina
[16]. The alumina refining industry refines bauxite ore, and thus produces waste
products. One of the waste products is a sludge which may be referred to as red
mud. Red mud is produced through the Bayer process during bauxite ore refining.
Brown mud is also produced in this way [17]. Bauxite ore is digested with sodium
hydroxide under high heat and pressure and then the solid impurities are isolated
after an aqueous leaching cycle.
Red mud is typically held in disposal sites such as landfills, retention ponds, or
left exposed in piles on the surface. Red mud is difficult to dispose of and has no
recognized industrial use.
Treatment fluids may contain a lost circulation material and a base fluid. The lost
circulation material may contain a red mud. The red mud may be used in a variety of
treatment fluids. The base fluid content of the red mud may be as high as 25% [16].
22.4.9 FLAKY DATE FRUIT CAPS
Different types of loss control materials, such as granular, fibrous, and flaky
materials, are frequently used either alone or in combination to control the loss of
circulation [18].
The manufacture, use, and disposal of some conventional lost circulation materi￾als may pose a risk to sensitive environments, such as marine environments, because
they are not biodegradable and can be toxic to marine life. Additionally, the purchase
and importation of lost circulation materials to drilling locations may be expensive
and time-consuming.22.4 Lost circulation materials 957
A lost circulation material has been described that contains a plurality of date fruit
caps [18]. The date fruit caps have a diameter of 7-8 mm. The date fruit caps have a
surface area in the range of 38 to 50 mm2 when the flakes are spread.
The date fruit caps are obtained from date trees (also referred to as date palms),
which are used for the production of date fruits. The date fruit caps may be produced
as a waste by-product from date processing.
Each fruit-bearing panicle obtained from a date tree may include hundreds
of spikelets and thousands of date fruit caps, resulting in a relatively large and
sustainable source of date fruit caps for use in the date fruit cap lost circulation
material.
The nontoxic and environmentally friendly properties of the date fruit cap lost
circulation material may have superior environmental performance compared to
conventional flake lost circulation materials [18].
22.4.10 AQUEOUS FLUID SYSTEMS
Alcohols
Higher aliphatic alcohols with poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide) are
particularly effective at reducing the gas content of drilling solutions [19].
An aliphatic alcohol with 8-32 carbon atoms can be used together with a solid
carrier. The carrier is nonswelling in aqueous media and consists of small particles
with an average size of less than 150-200 μm. The carrier adsorbs the alcohol [20,21].
Some examples for solid carrier materials are sawdust, ground rice hulls, ground
nutshells, and clays. Other carrier materials may include solids that are commonly
added to drilling and other well fluids as fluid loss additives, bridging agents.
Fatty acid esters
Defoamers that are more environmentally acceptable than convential products are
based on fatty acid esters of hydroxy alcohols, such as sorbitan monooleate [22]
or sorbitan monolaurate in combination with diethylene glycol monobutyl ether
as a cosolvent [23]. These defoamer compositions are as effective as conventional
materials. Those based on acetylenic alcohols are less toxic, especially to marine
organisms, and are readily biodegradable. The defoamer compositions are used in
water-based hydrocarbon well fluids during oil and gas well drilling, completion,
and workover, especially in marine conditions.
Aerosil
Aerosil as a solid additive in combination with diesel is active as a defoamer [24].
The aerosil is modified with bifunctional silicoorganic compounds. The composition
is added to drilling solution in the form of a 3-5% suspension, in an amount of
0.02-0.5% of aerosil.958 CHAPTER 22 Defoamers
Poly(oxirane)
Poly(oxirane)-containing formulations have a low cloud point, good ability to reduce
surface and IFTs, good wettability, and limited tendency to dispersion. The oxirane￾methyloxirane copolymers [25] are nontoxic and show high stability in both acidic
and alkaline environments. Their poor stability against oxidation can be improved
through chemical modification (blocking hydroxide groups) or by using an alkaline
catalyst, which acts as an inhibitor of the self-oxidation process.
Poly(propylene glycol), particulate hydrophobic silica, and a fatty acid methyl
ester, or an olefin or linear paraffin as a liquid diluent, are proposed for well
stimulation jobs [26].
22.4.11 WELL TREATMENT AND CEMENTATION
When a foamed well treatment fluid must be disposed of on the surface, a defoaming
composition may be added to the fluid to destroy the foam, thus, facilitating disposal
of the liquid components of the treating fluid [27].
Examples of such defoaming compositions utilized in well treatment fluids
include compositions of glycerol tristerate and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Other de￾foaming compositions include propylene glycol and poly(ethylene oxide).
A defoaming composition is shown in Table 22.13. The defoaming composition
is suitable for cement compositions.
Poly(ethylene oxide) esters can be included in drilling or treatment fluids to
provide a demulsifying and defoaming action on foams [28]. The action of these
compositions is time and temperature dependent and therefore their action can be
controlled in situ.
Lecithin is a phospholipid, which is found in living organisms. Lecithin is one
of the major components in cell membranes, along with protein and cholesterol.
Lecithin may be synthesized from choline. Lecithin is used as a stabilizer and
emulsifier in foods. It is environmentally acceptable.
Lecithin can be used in defoaming agents in cement compositions. Because
of its high inherent viscosity, a solvent that is capable of reducing this viscosity
is preferably included in the composition, e.g. butanol. In addition, hydrophobic
particles may be added, such as calcium stearate [29].

22.4.12 PLUGGING AGENTS
The foaming of plugging agents with a large content of lignosulfonate can
be prevented by introducing a drilling mud antifoaming agent, consisting of
poly(methylsiloxane) and tributyl phosphate [30]. A synergistic effect is observed,
in that poly(methylsiloxane) simultaneously displaces the adsorbed molecules of the
foam stabilizer (lignosulfonate) from the foam film, and tributyl phosphate reduces
the surface viscosity of the film.
22.4.13 GAS-OIL SEPARATION
In its natural state, a crude oil contains dissolved gases at the pressure of the reservoir.
When the pressure is reduced, the gases are liberated and troublesome foam can
develop. There are three ways to prevent foaming in gas-oil separation [31]:
1. based on prior knowledge of crude oil foaming properties, a separator large
enough to cope with foam formation may be installed.
2. the amount of foam can be reduced by injecting a defoamer.
3. the gas-oil separator can be equipped with a mechanical device to destroy or
prevent a presumptive foam.
So, understanding the factors that inhibit the foaming power is of great im￾portance, because it yields a basic knowledge, how the materials produced will
perform with respect to foaming. It also serves to predict how individual crude oil
compositions would work with different defoamers.
Fluorosilicones and fluorocarbons
Early defoamers to remove gas from crude oil consisted of chlorofluorocarbons.
The use of these compounds has essentially ceased. They were substituted gradually
by pure fluorosilicones [32]. A formulation that is free of chlorofluorocarbons was
described in the early 1990s.
A water-continuous emulsion, suitable for use as an antifoam additive, contains
85-98% of a fluorosilicone oil and 2-15% of an aqueous surfactant solution [33].
The additive is suitable for use in separation of crude oil that contains associated
gas. The additive may be used in both aqueous and nonaqueous systems and
allows fluorosilicone oils to be used without the need for environmentally damaging
chlorofluorocarbons.
Freshly extracted degassing crude oil can be defoamed with fluorinated nor￾bornylsiloxanes [34]. The compounds are highly effective and show a broad area of
application for defoaming degassing crude oils of different origins. The compounds
can be used in concentrations as small as 20 ppm.
Polydienes
Polydienes that are modified with organosilicons have been described and find
application as antifoaming or deaeration agents for oil field treating of crude oil [35].960 CHAPTER 22 Defoamers
High-temperature defoamers
Poly(isobutylene) compounds are particularly effective in high-temperature of
150-540 ◦C treatments of hydrocarbon fluids [36,37], such as during the distillation
of crude oil and coking of crude oil residues. Poly(isobutylene) compounds are less
expensive than silicone-based compounds.
22.4.14 NATURAL GAS
Desulfurization of natural gas can be achieved by bubbling it through an alkaline
solution. Defoamers are added to avoid foaming.
A mixture of dialkylphthalate of higher isoalcohols, in excess of the respective
isoalcohols, is used as an antifoaming composition in purification of natural gas
where H2S and CO2 are removed by aqueous solution of amine [38]. Amyl alcohol
and diethyl disulfide are used to improve the properties of a defoaming formulation
for the removal of acidic components from natural gas [39]. The mixture contains
35-50% tributyl phosphate and 20-25% amyl alcohol. The rest, diethyl disulfide, is
an industrial waste.
Esters, for example, dialkyl polypropyleneglycol adipate and dibutyl adipate,
also find use as defoamers in the removal of H2S and CO2 from natural gas by
bubbling it through an amine solution [40]. Use of the these components increases the
efficiency of foam destruction. The compounds in question are shown in Figure 22.2.
22.4.15 DISTILLATION AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTION
Air entrainment and foaming in hydrocarbon liquids can cause operational problems
with high-speed machinery in physical-chemical processes such as petroleum pro￾duction, distillation, cracking, coking, and asphalt processing.

22.4.16 ANTIMICROBIAL ANTIFOAM COMPOSITIONS
In addition to the typical constituents of a defoamer formulation, a water carrier with
a quaternary ammonium salt silane compound [41] can be included, which acts as an
antimicrobial agent. The silane is fixed to the surface of the silica. The composition
makes the defoamer composition resistant to biologic degradation because of the
presence of microorganisms in the system.

23.1 EMULSIONS IN PRODUCED CRUDE OIL
In the production of crude oil, the greatest part of the crude oil occurs as a water-in-oil
emulsion. The composition of the continuous phase depends on the water to oil ratio,
the natural emulsifier systems contained in the oil, and the origin of the emulsion.
The natural emulsifiers contained in crude oils have a complex chemical structure.
To overcome their effect, petroleum-emulsion demulsifiers must be selectively
developed. As new oil fields are developed, and as the production conditions change
at older fields, there is a constant need for demulsifiers that lead to a rapid separation
into water and oil, as well as minimal-residual water and salt mixtures.
The emulsion must be separated by the addition of chemical demulsifiers before
the crude oil can be accepted for transportation. The quality criteria for a delivered
crude oil are the residual salt content and the water content. For the oil to have a
pipeline quality, it is necessary to reduce the water content to less than 1%.
The separated salt water still contains certain amounts of residual oil, where now
preferentially oil-in-water emulsions are formed. The separation of the residual oil
is necessary in oilfield water purification and treatment for ecologic and technical
reasons, because the water is used for secondary production by waterflooding,
and residual oil volumes in the water would increase the injection pressure. The
presence of water-in-oil emulsions often leads to corrosion and to the growth of
microorganisms in the water-wetted parts of the pipelines and storage tanks.
At the refinery, before distillation, the salt content is often further reduced by a
second emulsification with fresh water, followed by demulsification. Crude oils with
high salt contents could lead to breakdowns and corrosion at the refinery. The object
of using an emulsion breaker, or demulsifier, is to break the emulsion at the lowest
possible concentration and, with little or no additional consumption of heat, to bring
about a complete separation of the water and reduce the salt content to a minimum.
There are oil soluble demulsifiers and water-soluble demulsifiers, the latter being
widely used. Emulsions are variable in stability. This variability is largely dependent
on oil type and degree of weathering. Emulsions that have a low stability will break
easily with chemical emulsion breakers.
Broken emulsions will form a foam like material, called rag, which retains water
that is not part of the stable emulsions. The most effective demulsifier must always be

Oxialkylates Good hydrating agents used in mixtures
determined for the particular emulsion. Demulsifiers are often added to the emulsion
at the wellhead to take advantage of the temperature of the freshly raised emulsion to
hasten the demulsification step.
Chemical products that are used as crude oil demulsifiers and some application
properties are summarized in Table 23.1.
Chemical compounds with the largest range of application are polyethers, mainly
those that possess a block structure with a central sequence of hydrophobic propylene
polyoxide and chain ends with sequences of hydrophilic ethylene oxide. The
hydrophobic blocks in such copolymers ensure their dissolution and diffusion in
crude oil, whereas the hydrophilic blocks allow the destabilization of the water/oil
emulsion interface.
The performance of dehydrating copolymers depends on molecular parameters
such as:
1. chemical structure;
2. composition; and
3. molecular mass, that is, the length of the polymeric chain.
The influence the length of the polymeric chain was studied [2]. Here, a series of
copolymers consisting of a central block poly(propylene oxide) and two side block23.4 Desired properties 967
of ethylene oxide were synthesized. These copolymers were afterwards submitted to
a functionalization process, in order to graft some secondary amines to the ethylene
oxide segments, to increase their interactions with the aqueous phase dispersed in the
petroleum.
The average molecular weight of the functionalized copolymers was adjusted
according to the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the sample of superheavy
crude oil. The water removals from the petroleum sample were evaluated by bottle
testing, mainly varying the kind of functional group and copolymer content. It was
observed that these demulsifying agents have a better performance than traditional
compounds, such as nonfunctionalized block copolymers and commercial formula￾tions commonly used to remove water from superheavy crude oil. The existence of
maximal water separation at a certain concentration of the functionalized copolymers
was observed, and explained in terms of a saturation of the water/oil interphase with
polymeric chains [2].
23.2 WATERFLOODING
During improved oil recovery processes, waterflooding of the oil is applied. The
entrained water forms a water-in-oil emulsion with the oil. In addition, salts such as
sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride may be dissolved in the
emulsified water.
23.3 OIL SPILL TREATMENT
Demulsifiers, specifically, oil spill demulsifiers can be applied to oil spills in low
concentrations. They prevent mousse formation for significant periods of time and
cause a large reduction in oil-water interfacial tension (IFT). The best of these was
found to prevent emulsification at dosages as low as 1 part inhibitor to 20,000 parts
of fresh oil at 20 ◦C [3]. At dosages of 1:1000, at temperatures higher than 10 ◦C,
the chemical also results in significant and rapid dispersion of the oil. For very
low temperatures or highly weathered oil, the performance of the chemical falls
off sharply.
23.4 DESIRED PROPERTIES
Demulsifiers for crude oil emulsions should meet the following properties:
• rapid breakdown into water and oil with minimal amounts of residual water,
• good shelf life, and
• quick preparation.968 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers
23.5 MECHANISMS OF DEMULSIFICATION
23.5.1 STABILIZATION OF WATER-OIL EMULSIONS
The stabilization of water-oil emulsions happens as a result of the interfacial layers,
which mainly consist of colloids present in the crude oil-asphaltenes and resins. By
adding demulsifiers, the emulsion breaks up. With water-soluble demulsifiers, the
emulsion stabilizers originally in the system will be displaced from the interface.
In addition, a change in wetting by the formation of inactive complexes may
occur. Conversely, using oil soluble demulsifiers, the mechanism, in addition to the
displacement of crude colloids, is based on neutralizing the stabilization effect by
additional emulsion breakers and the breakup resulting from interface eruptions [4].
23.5.2 INTERFACIAL TENSION RELAXATION
The effectiveness of a crude oil demulsifier is correlated with the lowering of the
shear viscosity and the dynamic tension gradient of the oil-water interface. The IFT
relaxation occurs faster with an effective demulsifier [5]. Short relaxation times imply
that IFT gradients at slow film thinning are suppressed. Electron spin resonance
experiments with labelled demulsifiers indicate that the demulsifiers form reverse
micellelike clusters in the bulk oil [6]. The slow unclustering of the demulsifier at the
interface appears to be the rate-determining step in the tension relaxation process.
23.6 PERFORMANCE TESTING
The trial-and-error method of choosing an optimal demulsifier from a wide variety
of demulsifiers to effectively treat a given oilfield water-in-oil emulsion is time
consuming. However, there are methods to correlate and predict the performance
of demulsifiers.
The selection of the appropriate chemicals, also known as demulsifier or emulsion
breaker, is performed by an old, but well-accepted method in the oil industry, the
bottle test [7,8]. Even though it is widely used, this procedure may be very tedious
and time-consuming. A typical set of bottle tests may include the testing of several
hundred samples. This is partially due to the inability to preselect a promising set
of demulsifiers, and also due to the variability of crude emulsions. As a result, the
identification of new methods for fast evaluation of demulsifier performance is highly
desirable.
Chemical demulsifiers
Chemical demulsifiers are widely applied for demulsification of crude oil emulsions
which were generally formed with natural stabilizers during the extraction.
The demulsification performance of four classes of nonionic poly(ethylene oxide)
poly(propylene oxide) copolymer demulsifiers and sodium dodecyl sulfate, as well
as their dynamic demulsification process on the W/O light crude oil emulsion, were
analyzed by the multiple light scattering method [9].23.6 Performance testing 969
The demulsification mechanism of these demulsifiers were illuminated by the
measurement of dynamic interfacial tension, dynamic interfacial viscoelasticity,
rupture rate, and microscopic changes of oil film by the single droplet method.
The results have shown that demulsification performance does not depend on the
interfacial tension, though effective demulsifiers could have a lower interfacial
tension around 1 mN m−1 [9].
The multiple light scattering data and dynamic interfacial tension clarified the
demulsification process of efficient demulsifiers, quick diffusion and adsorption of
demulsifiers, palpable change in interfacial property, droplet coalescence, and sedi￾mentation. The capacities of demulsifiers to penetrate into the interface and to decrease
the interfacial viscoelasticity were the dominating demulsification mechanisms.
The quantitative interpretation of multiple light scattering data associated with the
dynamic interfacial tension and interfacial viscoelasticity illuminated the demulsifi￾cation mechanism of different demulsifiers. The rupture rate and dynamic rupture
process of the oil film between the aqueous phases also vividly showed the
differences in demulsification process.
The nonionic demulsifiers with aromatic groups had the highest speed and best
performance due to the similar aromatic groups with those in asphaltenes, which
produced the least stable oil film [9].
23.6.1 SPREADING PRESSURE
The performance of demulsifiers can be predicted by the relationship between the
film pressure of the demulsifier and the normalized area and the solvent properties
of the demulsifier [10]. The surfactant activity of the demulsifier is dependent on the
bulk phase behavior of the chemical when dispersed in the crude oil emulsions. This
behavior can be monitored by determining the demulsifier pressure-area isotherms
for adsorption at the crude oil-water interface.
23.6.2 CHARACTERIZATION BY DIELECTRIC CONSTANT
The dielectric constant can be used as a criterion for screening, ranking, and selecting
demulsifiers for emulsion breaking. In a study, the dielectric constants of emulsions
and demulsifiers were measured using a portable capacitance meter, and bottle tests
were conducted according to the API specification [11]. The results showed that the
dielectric constants can be used effectively to screen and rank demulsifiers, whereas
a confirmatory bottle test should be conducted on the best demulsifiers to assist in
the rapid selection of the most effective demulsifier.
23.6.3 SHAKER TEST METHODS
A study by Environment Canada and the U.S. Minerals Management Service
attempted to develop a standard test for emulsion breaking agents [12]. Nine types
of shaker test methods were tried. Although the results are comparable with different
tests, a stable water-in-oil emulsion must be used to yield reproducible results. Tests
with unstable emulsions showed nonreproducible and inconsistent results.970 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers
23.6.4 VISCOSITY MEASUREMENTS
Water content and viscosity measurements in certain systems show a correlation to
emulsion stability [13]. The viscosity provides a more reliable measure of emulsion
stability, but measurements of the water content are more convenient. Mixing time,
agent amount, settling time, and mixing energy impact the effectiveness of an
emulsifier.
23.6.5 SCREENING
Without knowing the structure in detail, nuclear magnetic-resonance spectroscopy
(NMR) information can be compiled by 13C on the structure using the chemical
shifts. The chemical shifts can be correlated with other data, such as bottle tests,
and evaluated by statistical methods. In a series of experimental work [14,15] using
principal component analysis, NMR data and bottle test data were used to cluster
more than 100 demulsifiers into only a few distinctly different chemical groups as
characterized by the NMR data. Similar chemical types had similar demulsification
performance, which means that demulsifier evaluations can be made based on
demulsifier chemistry.
Only a few of the distinctly different emulsifiers need to be tested before the
optimization procedure can start. Because the chemical characterization by NMR
imaging takes only a fraction of the time of a bottle test, it is possible to more rapidly
focus on optimizing the dosage of the demulsifier.
Microfludic technique
In a study, the microfluidic platform was explored in an effort to identify a novel,
fast, and accurate technique for the evaluation of crude oil demulsifiers [8]. An
X-junction microfluidic channel was used to generate water droplets in dry crude
oil in a controlled manner.
The addition of demulsifying agents in the oil phase resulted in the generation
of droplets of varying size, and droplet coalescence downstream in the device. In
an effort to understand better the microfluidic responses, and their relationship to the
macroscopic performance of demulsifiers, these results were examined and compared
against bottle test data of the crude oil/water emulsion [8].
A strong correlation among the water drop and oil dryness performance (bottle
test response) and the droplet coalescence and relative standard deviation of droplet
size (microfluidic response) was observed. This study proves that the microfluidic
platform has the potential to serve as an alternate and fast method for demulsifier
screening [8].
Single droplet in situ displacement method
The chemical demulsification process is related with the natural emulsifier displace￾ment by the demulsifier. A single droplet in situ displacement method was employed
to evaluate the displace capacity of the demulsifier [16].23.7 Classification of demulsifiers 971
In addition, an experimental device was built. This device determines the dis￾placement capacity of the demulsifier by measuring the oil-water interfacial tension,
demulsifier concentration, and saturated adsorption amount of demulsifier.
The displacement capacities of four commercially available poly(ether) demul￾sifiers and the relationship between demulsifier displacement capacity and demul￾sification performance were investigated. The results showed that the demulsifier
displacement capacity was not affected by natural emulsifier type (asphaltene, resin,
or a mixture of asphaltene) and was related to the demulsifier type, concentration,
and temperature. The demulsifier displacement capacity increased with the concen￾tration of the demulsifier and the temperature. However, only when the asphaltene
concentration was over 6.78% did the demulsification increase with demulsifier
displacement capacity [16].
Size exclusion chromatography
Demulsifiers are used in gas oil separation plants for the separation of water from
a crude oil emulsion [17]. One of the important parameters for the enhancement
of performance is the optimization of demulsifier formulation with respect to
oil composition and produced water chemistry. The consistency in the quality of
the formulation is essential to obtain the best separation of water throughout the
production period of crude oil.
The commonly used method to optimize formulations is the bottle test method.
However, this method remains laborious, time-consuming, imprecise, and requires
access to fresh crude oil, which is not convenient from a practical viewpoint. Instead,
routine physical and chemical properties are monitored to ensure the consistency
of the demulsifier quality. It was, however, observed that there was a significant
influence on the performance of a demulsifier from different batches with very close
physical and chemical properties.
A method was developed using size exclusion chromatography to determine the
molecular weight distribution of the demulsifier base material [17]. In the study,
an alkoxylated alkylphenol-formaldehyde resin was tested. It was found that all
the samples contained two well-separated species with one low molecular weight
of about 2700 g mol−1 and another one with a high molecular weight of about
15,000 g mol−1. The amount of oil-water separation as a function of amount of high
molecular species is shown in Figure 23.1.
The variation in the content of low and high molecular weight species was
identified to be a key parameter significantly influencing the separation performance.
It is apparent from this study that size exclusion chromatography can provide
some additional insights on demulsifier intermediate chain length dispersity, which
could be correlated to actual separation performance [17].
23.7 CLASSIFICATION OF DEMULSIFIERS
The chemicals used as demulsifiers can be classified according to their chemi￾cal structure and their applications. With the latter respect, a main division for972 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers

water-in-oil and oil-in-water applications exists. Furthermore, the demulsifiers can
be classified according to the oil type used.
From the view of chemical classification, two major groups exist:
• non-ionic demulsifiers and
• ionic demulsifiers.
23.7.1 COMMON PRECURSOR CHEMICALS
Poly(alkylene oxide)s
Poly(alkylene oxide)s are substances of the following general structure:
HO−(CH2−CHR−O)x−H
The most important additives are poly(ethylene oxide), poly(propylene oxide), and
poly(butylene oxide). They are also referred to as poly(alkylene glycol) (PAG), but
this name is correct strictly for derivatives of 1,2-diols.
Poly(propylene oxide) has a molar mass of 250-4000 Da. The lower molecular
homologues are miscible with water, whereas the higher molecular poly(propylene
oxide)s are sparingly soluble. They are formed by the polyaddition of, for example,
propylene oxide (PO) to water or propanediol. The simplest examples are di-, tri- and
tetrapropyleneglycol.
There are also block copolymers from ethylene oxide (EO) and PO,

Polytetramethyleneglycol (polytetrahydrofuran) is formed by ring opening

using polyfunctional alcohols such as trimethylolpropane and pentaerythrite, c.f.
Figure 23.2. The products are liquids or waxes depending on the molar mass.
Poly(alkylene oxide)s are often precursors for demulsifiers.
Poly(amine)s
Poly(amine)s are usually open chain compounds with primary, secondary, or tertiary
amino groups. Instead of poly(amine)s, poly(imine)s are used without a sharp
difference. Actually, imines are compounds with the =N− group or cycles such
as ethyleneimine. Examples of oligoamines and poly(amine)s are ethylene diamine,
propanediamine, and 1,4-butanediamine and the respective products of condensation
such as diethyleneamine, dipropylenetriamine, and triethylenetetramine. The com￾pounds are colorless to yellowish liquids or solids with alkaline reaction. Suitable
amines and ethers are shown in Figure 23.3.
Poly(amine)s can also be synthesized by cationic ring opening polymerization of
ethyleneimines (aziridines), trimethyleneimines (azetidines), and 2-oxazolines.
Poly(alkylene imine)s are poly(amine)s whose structure is classified into linear
and branched types as shown below.
Linear: H2N−(CH2−CH2−NH)xH and
Branched: H2N−(CH2−CH2−N(CH2−CH2−NH2))xH2.
Linear poly(alkylene imine)s have amino groups only in the main chain, and
branched poly(alkylene imine)s have amino groups in both the main and side
chains. In general, nitrogen atoms are at every third or fourth atom. Linear
poly(ethyleneimine) is insoluble in benzene, diethyl ether, acetone, and water at
room temperature and is soluble in hot water.
Ethoxylation
The reaction is also referred to as ethoxylation, oxethylation, or more generally, to
oxalkylation. Ethoxylation is an insertion of one or more CH2CH2−O− groups into
a molecule with EO. The reaction works with compounds with acid hydrogen atoms.974 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers

Suitable compounds for ethoxylation are fatty alcohols, alkyl phenols, fatty
amines, fatty acid esters, mercaptans, and imidazolines. The reaction runs at
120-220 ◦C under pressure (approximately 1-5 bar).
The products are generally linear ethers and poly(ether)s that have a hydroxyl
functionality at one end of the chain. Depending on the amount of EO used, a
distribution of homologous ethoxylates are formed. Alkaline catalysts such as sodium
methylate are used to obtain a broad Schulz-Flory distribution, whereas bivalent
salts (calcium acetate, strontium phenolate) cause a narrow Poisson distribution.
Acid catalysts, e.g., antimony pentachloride, also give a narrow distribution, but give
1,4-dioxan as an undesired byproduct.
Acetylenic surfactants
The class of acetylenic surfactants can be used to resolve or break water and
oil emulsions. The surfactants are of particular advantage in resolving crude oil
emulsions of the type encountered in desalter or oilfield dehydration vessels [18].
Some acetylenic compounds as precursors for surfactants are shown in
Figure 23.4. These tertiary acetylenic diols are reacted with EO or PO to from
oligomers. As catalyst, trimethylamine is recommended. This type of surfactant is
known for its good balance of equilibrium and dynamic surface-tension-reducing
capabilities with few of the negative features of traditional non-ionic and anionic
surfactants [19].23.8 Demulsifiers in detail 975

23.8 DEMULSIFIERS IN DETAIL
Common demulsifiers are listed in Table 23.2.
23.8.1 POLYOXYALKYLENES
A process for separating crude oil emulsions of the water-in-oil type based on certain
EO-PO block polymers and certain polyglycidol ethers of phenol-formaldehyde￾condensation products has been described [47–49].
Poly(propylene glycol) or a poly(butylene oxide) with a molecular weight in
the range of 7-20 kDa is modified with EO or a diglycidyl ether [50]. Glycide
derivates of poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEG)s can be prepared by the acid-catalyzed
or base-catalyzed reaction of PEGs with 0.5-10% diepoxides [51]. The diepoxides
are aromatic or aliphatic precondensates that are used commonly as constituents for
epoxide resins, such as the diglycidyl ether from bisphenol-A, and their oligomers.
The modification leads to increased molecular weight.976 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers

Because of the high molecular weight of the modified PAG, the oil dehydration
already occurs when used alone. The compound acts synergistically with other
conventional demulsifiers.
Several patents are proposing poly(alkylene oxide) block copolymers as demul￾sifiers. Variability exists in the mixtures. For example, the block copolymers can
be modified with a vinyl monomer [52]. In addition, diglycidyl ethers [53], i.e.,
precondensates for epoxides, can be used as modifiers. Another possibility is the
modification with poly(amine)s.
The preparation procedure can be quite complex. For example, a water-in-oil
demulsifier is prepared by the following steps [54]:
1. reacting a high-molecular-weight PAG with EO to form a PAG/EO adduct,
2. esterifying the PAG/EO adduct with a diacid anhydride to form a diester,
3. reacting the diester with a vinyl monomer, and
4. additionally esterifying the product of step (3) with a polyhydric material.
A demulsifier composition that is a blend of a propoxylated-ethoxylated block
copolymer of a bis-hydroxyalkyl ether and a propoxylated-ethoxylated block copoly￾mer of 2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol has been described [55,56].23.8 Demulsifiers in detail 977
The blend is partially crosslinked with a vinyl monomer when dissolved in an
organic aprotic solvent and has a pH of 5.0 or lower. The first block copolymer is
prepared by polycondensing a dipropylene glycol, or diethylene glycol with PO.
Next, the resulting propoxylated diol is reacted with EO to produce the block
copolymer. The second copolymer is prepared by polycondensing 2-amino-2-
hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol, with PO to provide a polymer having preferably
10-25 oxypropylene units.
Next, the propoxylated diol is reacted with EO to produce the block copolymer
having preferably 5-10 EO units. The two block copolymers are dissolved together
in an organic aprotic solvent, such as toluene, xylene, trialkyl benzene, cyclohexane,
heptane, or hexane.
Branched poly(ester)s contain oxalkylated primary fatty amines or oxalkylated
poly(amine)s together with at least trivalent oxalkylated alkanol that is respon￾sible for branching. The condensation is achieved with a dicarboxylic acid or a
dicarboxylic acid anhydride [57]. In this way, branched polyoxyalkylene mixed
poly(ester)s are formed. Suitable solvents are water or organic solvents.
The branched polyoxyalkylene mixed poly(ester)s possess a high demulsifier
effect. In the usual range of oil-processing temperatures, a complete water removal
and a reduction of the salt content is achieved after a short time.
In heavy oil reservoirs with highly porous sands, cyclic steamflooding may cause
the formation of stable emulsions. These emulsions can block the production paths
in the wellbore. In steam cycle treatments, a blend of oxyalkylated alkanolamines
and sulfonates showed a dramatic improvement over nonchemically enhanced steam
cycles [58].
Block polymers or copolymers of EO and PO can be chain extended or
crosslinked, respectively, with diisocyanates, dicarboxylic acids, formaldehyde, and
diglycidyl ethers [59].
A blend of a polyoxyalkylene-polysiloxane copolymer and an alkoxylated
phenol-formaldehyde resin is useful as a demulsifier [60,61]. The polyoxyalkylene
units in the copolymer have a molecular weight below 500 Da, and the polysiloxane
units have 3-50 silicon atoms. The resin has a phenol/aldehyde ratio of 2:1 to 1:5 and
an average molecular weight of 500-20,000 Da.
The composition shows synergistic demulsification activity when compared with
the individual components. The siloxane units can be either in blocks [62,63] of the
polyoxyalkylene-polysiloxane copolymer or randomly distributed [64,65].
23.8.2 VINYL POLYMERS
A water-soluble demulsifier is an emulsion tetrapolymer of methyl methacrylate,
butyl acrylate, AA, and methacrylic acid [66].
Styrene may also be added to give a pentapolymer. The polymer is of random
orientation and preferably has a molecular weight of approximately 10 kDa. The
polymer is a low viscous chalk-white fluid that is soluble in water at a pH of 6-7.978 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers
Emulsion breakers are made from AA or methacrylic acid (MA) copolymerized
with hydrophilic monomers [67]. The acid groups of AA and MA are oxalkylated by
a mixture of polyglycols and polyglycol ethers to provide free hydroxy groups on the
molecule.
The copolymers are made by a conventional method, for example, by free
radical copolymerization in solution, emulsion, or suspension. The oxalkylation is
performed in the presence of an acid catalyst, the acid being neutralized by an amine
when the reaction is complete.
Hydrophobic polymers with some hydrophilic groups can be obtained with an
emulsion polymerization technique. Suitable monomers are nitrogen containing
acrylics and methacrylics; allyl monomers such as dimethyl amino ethyl methacry￾late, dimethyl aminopropyl methacrylamide, diethylamino ethyl methacrylate,
dimethyl amino ethyl acrylate, diethylamino ethyl acrylate, and nitrogen containing
allyl monomers (e.g., diallylamine and N,N-diallylcyclohexylamine) [68,69].
Methacrylic momomers are shown in Figure 23.5.
If the polymer is to remain in emulsion form, it is important that the pH of the
water phase remain at or above 8. If the pH of the water phase falls below 8, the
polymer will commence dissolving in water, and the polymer emulsion will break.
Optionally, the pH of the aqueous phase of the broken emulsion, after doing the
job, can be adjusted to become alkaline. The salts of the polymers are converted into
inactive species and the aqueous phase of the broken emulsion can be reinjected into
a hydrocarbon-containing formation to recover additional hydrocarbons or bitumen
[70] as an improved oil recovery process.
Substrates coated with alkyl phenol-poly(ethylene oxide)-acrylate polymer [71]
are useful for demulsifying naturally occurring crude oils. The monomers include
oxethylated alkyl phenols, such as oxethylated nonyl phenol with 6-12 ethoxy units,
which are esterified with acrylate.
Quaternary ammonium salts of 1-acryloyl-4-methyl piperazine, c.f. Figure 23.6,
can be prepared by methylation with methyl chloride and dimethyl sulfate.
These monomers can be polymerized by means of radical polymerization, either
alone or with a comonomer [72]. A useful comonomer with appropriate monomer
reactivity ratios is acrylamide (AAm). Certain basic poly(amide)s can be further
prepared by reacting piperazine derivatives with amines [73].
A terpolymer can be obtained from a water-soluble non-ionic monomer, such
as AAm; a cationic monomer, such as 3-acrylamidopropyltrimethyl ammonium
chloride; and a hydrophobic monomer, such as an alkyl-AAm or alkyl acrylate [74] or
methacrylamide or methacrylate, respectively. The terpolymer is water-dispersible.
Similarly, a cationic copolymer that exhibits efficacy in breaking oil-in-water
and water-in-oil emulsions under a wide variety of conditions has been described.
The cationic copolymer is a copolymer of acryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium
chloride and AAm [75,76]. The preferred copolymer contains 40-80 mol%
acryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride. The copolymer is effective in a matrix
that includes high percentages of oil at high temperatures.23.8 Demulsifiers in detail 979

Methacrylic monomers for demulsifiers.
Special polymerization techniques have been described [77]. The polymerization
is performed in an aqueous solution together with a polyvalent anionic salt in the
presence of a water-soluble cationic polymer. The latter acts as a dispersant polymer.
Furthermore, a seed polymer that is water-soluble and a cationic polymer that is
insoluble in the aqueous solution of the polyvalent anionic salt are present.
A polymer of monoallylamine is water soluble [78,79]. It is used for breaking
oil-in-water emulsions.
A combination of aluminum chlorohydrate and a poly(amine), such as
poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride), in aqueous solution is effective at
elevated temperatures for an oil-in-water emulsion [26].980 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers

Quaternary ammonium salts of 1-acryloyl-4-methyl piperazine.
Copolymers of a cationic monomer and a vinyl alkoxysilane may be prepared
by conventional vinyl polymerization techniques. These techniques include solution
polymerization in water and emulsion polymerization with either free radical initia￾tors or redox initiators.
The cationic monomer can be a diallyl dimethyl ammonium halide, a dimethyl
amino ethyl acrylate quaternary salt, or a dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate
quaternary salt [80]. The copolymers may be in solid, dispersion, latex, or solution
form. In particular, copolymers of diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride and vinyl
trimethoxysilane will have a molecular weight in the range from 100 to 1000 kDa.
The following are monomers for copolymers of allyl-polyoxyalkylenes with
acrylics [25,81]:
• polyoxyalkylene ethers of allyl alcohol or methallyl alcohol,
• acrylic or methacrylic alkyl esters with up to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl group,
• acrylic or methacrylic acid, and
• acrylamide or methacrylamide.
The copolymers may be mixed with other demulsifiers, in particular with
alkoxylated novolaks and copolymers that are obtainable by copolymerization of one
or more polyoxyalkylene ethers of allyl or methallyl alcohol, c.f. Figure 23.7, with
vinylesters of alkyl monocarboxylic acids.
Polymers of vinyl phenol are obtained by hydrolyzing poly(acetoxystyrene), c.f.
Figure 23.8, [82,83]. The respective phenol salts can be used. The demulsifier is
applicable to oil-in-water emulsions and does not require the use of zinc or other
heavy metals. Therefore it does not cause the environmental problems inherent in
such metals.

23.8.3 POLY(AMINE)S
Expensive examples how to prepare poly(amine) based demulsifiers have been given
in the literature [84].
Poly(alkylene) poly(amine) salts are prepared by contacting poly(amine)s with
organic or inorganic acids. The poly(amine)s have a molecular weight of at least
1 kDa and ranging up to the limits of water solubility [85]. In a process of
demulsification of the aqueous phase of the broken bitumen emulsions, the pH is
adjusted to deactivate the demulsifier so that the water may be used in subsequent in
situ hot water or steam floods of the tar sand formation.
To mitigate the effects of corrosion resulting from the presence of salts, it is
advantageous to reduce the salt concentration to the range of 3-5 ppm. Typically,
brine droplets in crude oil are stabilized by a mixture of surface active components
such as waxes, asphaltenes, resins, and naphthenic acids that are electrostatically
bound to the surface of the droplets. Such components provide an interfacial film
over the brine droplet, resulting in a diminished droplet coalescence.
Adding water to the crude oil can decrease the concentration of the surface
active components on the surface of each droplet, because the number of droplets
is increased without increasing component concentration of the demulsifier.
The amount of added water required for desalting may be minimized by adding
a chemical emulsion breaker to the crude that is capable of displacing the surface
active components from the brine droplets. Quaternized carboxylic sulfonic acid
salts, shown in Figure 23.9, are useful for desalting [86]. Preferably, the chemical
emulsion breaker is used in combination with a delivery solvent, such as diethylene
glycol monobutyl ether.
Alkoxylated poly(ethyleneimine)s are obtained by reacting poly(ethyleneimine)
with a molecular weight of 2.5-35 kDa with an excess of PO and EO with respect
to the ethyleneimine unit in the poly(ethyleneimine) [27,87]. The compounds can
be used for the demulsification of petroleum emulsions in a temperature range of
10-130 ◦C.982 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers

FIGURE 23.9
Quaternized carboxylic sulfonic acid salts.
Alkyl amine ethoxylates may be used as quaternary salts [88]. The amount
necessary to break the emulsion is generally 1-100 ppm.
In the same way, a crosslinked oxalkylated poly(alkylene) poly(amine) can be
obtained by preparing a completely oxalkylated poly(alkylene) poly(amine) with a
degree of polymerization of 10 to 300, crosslinked with a polyalcohol.
The demulsifying agent is made from a mixture of the crosslinked oxalkylated
poly(alkylene) poly(amine) with 25-75% of an oxethylated or oxypropylated isoalkyl
phenol-formaldehyde resin [89].
Crosslinking can be achieved also, if the poly(amine) is modified with a vinyl
monomer [90–92]. Such mixtures are substantially free of copolymers derived from
a PAG and a diglycidyl ether.
Glycidyl ether additives are obtained by esterification of alkoxylated primary
fatty amines and additives of poly(ether)-block polymers and glycidyl ethers with
dicarboxylic acids [93]. They are used as demulsifiers to break oil emulsions and, as
quaternized products, they are suitable as corrosion inhibitors.
23.8.4 POLY(AMIDE)S
Cationic condensation products, namely, the reaction products of a dicarboxylic acid
or an ester or acid halide thereof and an aminoalkyl amine, that are quaternized are
recommended for breaking crude oil emulsions from fireflooding [94].
In general, poly(alkylene) poly(amide)s-amines are obtained by the condensation
of poly(alkylene) poly(amine)s with dicarboxylic acids. The materials are alkoxy￾lated with an excess of EO or PO or 1,2-butylene oxide [95].
Compositions of a N,N-dialkylamide of a fatty acid in a hydrocarbon solvent
and a mutual oil-water solvent are useful for the prevention of sludge formation or
emulsion formation during the drilling or workover of producing oil wells [96–98].
Ordinary dicarboxylic acids or dimeric fatty acids are condensed with fatty
amines to give emulsion breakers [99–102]. Oxalkylated fatty amines and fatty amine
derivatives have properties other than emulsion braking. In particular, they can act as
corrosion inhibitors and pour point depressants.
Quaternary oxalkylated polycondensates can be prepared by esterification of an
oxalkylated primary fatty amine with a dicarbonic acid. An organometallic titanium
compound is used as a catalyst for condensation [103]. The reaction product is23.8 Demulsifiers in detail 983

then oxalkylated in the presence of a carbon acid [104]. These polycondensates
can be used as demulsifiers for crude oil emulsions and as corrosion inhibitors in
installations for the production of natural gas and crude oil; they can and also be
used in processing.
23.8.5 PHENOLICS
A study on a commonly used demulsifier, namely, a phenol-formaldehyde resin, elu￾cidated how various parameters such as IFT, interfacial shear viscosity, dynamic IFT
gradient, dilatational elasticity, and demulsifier clustering affect the demulsification
effectiveness [6].
Products from oxalkylated alkyl phenol-formaldehyde resins, alcohols, bisphe￾nols, or amines have been described as demulsifiers [105].
Condensation products of cardanol (Figure 23.10), an alkyl phenol, and an
aldehyde can be further ethoxylated and may be sulfonated by the addition of sodium
bisulfite in the presence of a free radical initiator. Cardanol is a naturally occurring
phenol manufactured from cashew nut shell liquid.
Unsaturated acids may be added to the phenolic hydroxides of these resins, and
the resulting adduct may be copolymerized with AA [106]. The compositions show
good emulsion breaking performance, especially when used in blends with other
compositions.
23.8.6 ALKOXYLATED FATTY OILS
An alkoxylated fatty oil is used in a non-ionic composition [107]. The alkoxylated
fatty oil has low solubility in the main emulsion phase. The process is used for
breaking emulsions used in wellbore drilling fluids and in oil recovery.
Alkylacrylamide copolymers

monomer with another monomer selected from the group shown in Table 23.3.984 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers

Products from polyols and dicarboxylic acids
Demulsifiers have been developed from the reaction products of an alkoxylated
polyol or ester and a dicarboxylic acid [109]. Examples of such monomeric com￾pounds are shown in Table 23.4.
The alkoxylated polyol of ester is derived from the reaction of an alkylene oxide
with the polyol or the polyol ester. One or more equivalents of the alkylene oxide may
react with each polyol molecule. Preferably, the alkylene oxide is ethylene oxide or
propylene oxide, or a mixture thereof [109].
Optionally, the reaction product of the alkoxylated polyol or ester and the
dicarboxylic acid may further have an end-cap, such as a monocarboxylic acid.
Monocarboxylic acids are shown in Table 23.5 and some compounds are shown in
Figures 23.11 and 23.12.
A composition comprising sorbitan monolaurate and adipic acid in a 2:1 molar
ratio was produced as follows [109]:
Preparation 23–1: Of sorbitan monolaurate, 384 kg was added to the reaction vessel and
heated to 80 ◦C while stirring; 23 kg of adipic acid flakes was slowly added to the warm
stirred sorbitan monolaurate. The mixture was heated to 235 ◦C, observing the removal
of water by distillation. The reaction was continued until an acid value of the less than
5 mg KOH g−1 was observed. The reaction yielded 400 kg of the reaction product and
5.8 kg of water.986 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers

Performance tests were performed on the oil samples to determine the effective￾ness of the demulsifiers [109]. The tests were carried out using a TurbiScan TLab
Thermo manufactured by Formulaction. The demulsifiers were added to the crude
oil at a concentration of 100 ppm in xylene and analyzed in the TurbiScan at 1 scan
per minute for 60 min. The temperature of the TurbiScan was 60 ◦C.23.8 Demulsifiers in detail 987

The TurbiScan monitors the duration of the demulsification, along with the
transmission level and clarity of the resulting water phase and the quality of the
interface between the resulting water and oil phases [109].
The tests showed that the demulsifier shows the same or superior properties and
efficacy as the standard production chemicals, but it is environmentally friendly and
reaches or surpasses the rules of the OSPAR. OSPAR are the rules of the Convention
for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic [110,111].988 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers
In addition, the demulsifier shows good stability, so it can easily be stored onsite at
off-shore drilling locations until required for use. It also has superior biodegradability
and toxicity properties. Thus, it can be discharged safely into the sea or into the ocean
without further treatment of the aqueous phase of the demulsified emulsion being
required [109].
Hyperbranched poly(amido amine)
Two kinds of hyperbranched poly(amido amine) with abundant terminal amine
groups were synthesized to break oil-in-water emulsions consisting of microdroplets
[112].
The demulsification performance of hyperbranched poly(amido amine) was
systematically evaluated with the assistance of UV-Vis spectra, micrograph, DLS
and SAXS analyses.
The demulsifier with 1,3-propanediamine as initiator showed a striking demulsi￾fication ability with a small dosage of smaller than 40 mg l−1. The demulsification
equilibrium can be obtained within 30 min, and the oil removal ratio reaches up
to 92%, which is ascribed to the highly hyperbranched structure and the adequate
molecular weight [112].
The demulsifier molecules with hyperbranched structure easily diffuse to the oil￾water interface and reveal a high interfacial activity, which causes film break and
coalescence of oil droplets, and consequently leads to a high oil removal ratio.
The excellent demulsification performance of the hyperbranched poly(amido
amine) shows considerable potential for applications for wastewater treatment and
the petroleum industry [112].
In another study, a hyperbranched poly(amido amine) demulsifier was synthe￾sized by a modified one-pot method with 4,4-diaminodiphenyl methane as the central
core and ethylenediamine as the interior branches [113].
The structure of the demulsifier was confirmed by proton NMR and FTIR spec￾troscopy. The effects of the temperature and the concentration on the demulsification
performance were investigated. The performance was also compared to that of the
hyperbranched demulsifier with 1,3-propanediamine as the central core [113].
In the related study [112], 1,3-propanediamine and ethylenediamine were used
as the central cores, respectively, to synthesize two demulsifiers, and the demulsifier
with 1,3-propanediamine as the core showed a better performance. When ethylene￾diamine was used as the core and interior branches, its demulsification performance
was much lower than that of the demulsifier with the 4,4-diaminodiphenyl methane
core [113].
23.8.7 IONIC LIQUIDS
Ionic liquids with second demulsifiers
Demulsifying compositions formed by contacting ionic liquids and second demul￾sifiers have been noted to provide synergy, for example, the demulsification signifi￾cantly improves when a second demulsifier, other than the ionic liquid, is in contact23.8 Demulsifiers in detail 989

and some ionic liquids are shown in Figure 23.13. Exemplary second demulsifers are
shown in Table 23.7.
Amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids
It was attempted to use consumed poly(ethylene terephthalate) to prepare new
amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids [115]. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) was converted
into bis(2-hydroxyethylene) terephthalate. The produced bis(2-hydroxyethylene)
terephthalate was reacted with thionyl chloride to produce the corresponding dialkyl
halide, bis(2-chloroethyl) terephthalate.
N,N-bis-hexaoxyethlene octadecylamine and N,N-bis-hexaoxyethlene dodecy￾lamine were quaternized with bis(2-chloroethyl) terephthalate to produce the corre￾sponding gemini ionic liquids: N,N-bis-hexaoxyethlene octadecylamine-IL and N,N￾bis-hexaoxyethlene dodecylamine-IL, respectively [115].
The chemical structures were confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spec￾troscopy (FT-IR), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), and
13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR). The surface tension,
interfacial tension, and solubility were also investigated. In addition, the ability of
the prepared amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids to demulsify Arabian heavy crude oil
was evaluated. The results showed that their efficiency increased when the water
content in the water-in-oil emulsion increased [115].990 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers

Acrylic random copolymers
Two series of random acrylic copolymers were evaluated as petroleum demulsifiers.
These acrylic copolymers, with two different butyl acrylate and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate
contents, were synthesized by a semicontinuous emulsion polymerization method
[116]. Their weight-average molar mass (Mw) was varied by modifying the amount
of a chain transfer agent relative to the monomers from 0% to 8%. FTIR and 13C￾NMR spectroscopies confirmed that the conversion of the monomers was complete.
Then the synthesized acrylic copolymers were evaluated as demulsifier agents
in a Mexican heavy crude oil (10.24◦ API). Copolymers with 70% butyl acrylate
monomer and a weight-average molar mass above 11,000 g mol−1 presented the
greatest ability to remove emulsified water from the system. The demulsifying
capability of the copolymer was evidenced to be strongly dependent on their
molecular mass [116].
Acrylic-aminoacrylic random copolymers
Random copolymers of acrylic monomers and aminoacrylic monomers with proper￾ties as breakers of water/crude oil emulsions, drop coalescers, and clarifiers of the
aqueous phase have been shown [1].
The synthesis of these dehydrating agents of crude oil was carried out by a
semicontinuous emulsion [117]. The emulsion polymerization was carried out under
starved feed conditions, which ensures the copolymer homogeneity (no composition
drifts) and a random monomer distribution in the chain. The process requires the
use of chain-transfer agents, molecules that allow controlling the average molecular
mass of the polymeric chains. This molecular parameter is of great importance, since
the efficiency of dehydrating process of light or heavy crude oils depends largely
on it [1].
Monomers that can be used in the synthesis of the copolymers are shown in
Table 23.8.
It was observed that an acrylic/aminoacrylic copolymer was able to remove 100%
of dispersed water in only 20 min, whereas a commercial formulation, based on
conventional polyethers, just removed all the water after 2 h. This result implies
that the copolymer produced here is more effective in a range of 60% compared to
the commercial formulation at the same conditions. When the products were dosed
at 500 ppm, it was found that the performance of random copolymers decreases,
because it reached the 100% until 2 h of evaluation.
However, the commercial product could not remove more than 20% of water
throughout the testing. When the commercial formulation was dosed at twice the
concentration (1000 ppm), it behaved similarly to the copolymer at a concentration
of 500 ppm [1].
Branched poly(ether)s
A branched polyether has been prepared with 1,1,2,2-tetrakis (4-hydroxyphenyl)
ethane as a core, amino groups from tetraethylenepentamine as backbone, and
poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) chains as branches [118]. Thus, these992 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers

chains are based on a phenol-amine resin, propylene oxide, and ethylene oxide. The
monomers are shown in Figure 23.14.
The synthesis of the tetraethylenepentamine-based resins can be done as follows:
Preparation 23–2: In a 1-l three-necked round-bottom flask, fitted with a condenser,
an electromagnetic stirrer, and a thermometer, the mixture of tetraethylenepentamine
(1.6 mol) and 1,1,2,2-tetrakis (4-hydroxyphenyl) ethane (0.2 mol) is heated until the
mixture is fully dissolved. Formaldehyde (1.64 mol) in a constant pressure funnel is
dropped gradually into the above solution when the temperature decreases to 60 ◦C.
The product is stirred at the reaction temperature for 2 h and heated to 140 ◦C in the
presence of xylene (2 mol) with continuous stirring until the theoretical amount of water
was collected. Finally, the tetraethylenepentamine-based resins were dried at 60 ◦C for
20 h under vacuum.
Furthermore, the tetraethylenepentamine-based resin can be used to prepare branched
polyethers.
The surface activity is investigated by surface tension measurement at different
temperatures. The increase of the ratio of propylene oxide to ethylene oxide ratio or
chain lengths of poly(propylene oxide) improves the surface activity and decreases23.8 Demulsifiers in detail 993

the critical micelle concentration as well as increasing the temperature. The addition
of inorganic salts causes a slight increase in the critical micelle concentration [118].
The demulsification of water-in-crude-oil (W/O) emulsions, whether from poly￾mer flooding or not, shows that the branched polyether is a good demulsifier to break
the W/O emulsions. The stability of W/O emulsion in the presence of polyether
shows that the highest water dehydration is not necessarily the highest stability index
of W/O emulsion due to the turbidity of separated water. The demulsification process
is also observed by microscope. Distribution of the polyether after demulsification
was evaluated by partition coefficient at various concentrations [118].
In another study, a demulsifier with a high molecular weight and branch struc￾ture was prepared via the one-pot synthesis by using two poly(propylene oxide)-
poly(ethylene oxide) demulsifiers, acrylic acid, and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate as
materials [119]. The demulsification experiments showed that this demulsifier can
achieve a high water removal and produces a clear separated water.
Amine-based dendrimers
A series of amine-based dendrimer poly(amidoamine) demulsifiers with different
initial cores were synthesized and investigated in the demulsification process of
diesel-in-water emulsions [120]. With the aim of systemic evaluation of their demul￾sification performance, some important factors of the demulsification processes were
investigated including demulsifier dosage, settling time, temperature, oil content, and
kinds of diesel.
The demulsifier with the triethylenetetramine initial core provided an excellent
demulsification performance by removing oil with less dosage and at relatively low
temperature in short periods and reached a demulsification efficiency of 96.66% for
catalytic cracking a diesel emulsion [120].994 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers
In order to gain insight into the demulsification process and mechanism, some
measurement methods were adopted. Micrograph and droplet size distribution of
emulsions illustrated that the poly(amidoamine) demulsifier could lead to the breakup
of diesel-in-water emulsions by flocculation and coalescence. The surface tension
and interfacial tension gave a basic understanding of the demulsification mechanism.
The ζ -potential indicated that an emulsion had been broken up. The conductivity
measurement explained the demulsification mechanism from the aspect of the
electrostatic interactions of moving droplets [120].
Multibranched block copolymers
A series of multibranched block copolymers was synthesized by means of anionic
ring opening polymerization techniques, using various alkoxide salts obtained from
molecules that present different numbers of alcohol functions as initiators [121].
Propylene oxide and ethylene oxide were polymerized in two steps, to obtain
multibranched block copolymers with a demulsifying activity in petroleum [121].
A theoretical study by semiempirical AM1/NDDO has been carried out in order to
explain the growth of multiple branches from the initiators during the early stages of
the anionic polymerization [121]. AM1 (Austin Model 1) is a semiempirical method
for the quantum calculation of molecular electronic structure in computational
chemistry [122]. It is based on the NDDO integral approximation. In computational
chemistry, NDDO (neglect of diatomic differential overlap) is a formalism that
was first introduced by John Pople, and it is now the basis of most successful
semiempirical methods [123].
These simulations revealed complex patterns of polymer growth and increasing
polydispersities when initiators with a greater number of active sites were employed
to start the reactions. Afterward, the water removal efficiency, as a function of the
number of copolymer branches, was evaluated through bottle tests in two crude oils:
a heavy crude oil with 12.71◦ API and an extra-heavy crude oil with 9.68◦ API, with a
water content of 479% by volume and 39% by volume, respectively. A complex and
nonlinear behavior of the water removal, as a function of the number of the block
copolymer branches, was observed [121].
Alkylene oxide polymers have long been known for their use in breaking
emulsions. However, current demulsifiers are based on ethylene oxide and propylene
oxide copolymers. These conventional demulsifiers are hazardous to produce and are
not environmentally friendly [124].
Therefore, it would be desirable to develop methods and compositions for
economically and rapidly resolving or breaking petroleum emulsions that are more
environmentally friendly than current demulsifiers based on ethylene oxide and
propylene oxide copolymers.
It has been discovered that by replacing the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide
groups in conventional demulsifiers with materials that are similar Hansen solubility
parameters. Thus, an environmentally friendly demulsifier can be made by reacting
at least two different monomers with a resin, where at least one of the monomers is
selected from the group including a monomer having a Hansen solubility parameter23.8 Demulsifiers in detail 995

between 18 and 22 and is not ethylene oxide, a monomer having a Hansen solubility
parameter between 14 and 18 and is not propylene oxide [124].
The Hansen solubility parameters are a way of predicting that one material will
dissolve in another and form a solution [125,126].
For example, the solubility parameter of poly(ethylene oxide), 20 M Pa1/2, is
essentially the same as that of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) (20 M Pa1/2) and the solubility
parameter of poly(propylene oxide), 16 M Pa1/2, is essentially the same as that of
poly(caprolactone), 17 M Pa1/2 [124].
Suitable monomers with similar solubility parameters are collected in Table 23.9.
The demulsifiers have been shown to migrate to the oil-water interface by the fact
that they lower interfacial tension [124].
23.8.8 BIODEMULSIFIERS
Microbial demulsifying agents (biodemulsifiers) represent microbial cell surfaces.
Three bacteria, namely Nocardia amaraebacteria, Corynebacterium petrophilum,
and Rhodococcus aurantiacus, were tested for their ability to break simple and
complex water-in-oil and oil-in-water emulsions [127]. It was found that cells
harvested at the early stage of growth were more active in demulsification of water￾in-oil emulsions, whereas the cells harvested at a stationary phase of growth were
more active for oil-in-water emulsions.
The demulsifying capability was associated with the cell surface itself and could
not be destroyed by heating and drastic chemical treatments, except for alkaline
methanolysis, which destroyed the activity. Microbial aerobic and anaerobic sludges
have also been shown to demulsify water-in-oil emulsions, which opens interesting
opportunities in conjunction with biologic waste water treatment processes.
Cactus extract
A biodemulsifier has been developed that is based on a cactus extract, an activator
for the cactus extract, and a carrier liquid. The cactus extract is made from the leaves996 CHAPTER 23 Demulsifiers
and stems of the prickly pear or Opuntia family of cactus [128]. The leaves and stems
of the cactus are brought to a rolling boil in water at the ratio of about 1 pound of
prickly pear cactus parts to 1.75 gallons of water.
The fibrous solids are then separated from the extract by screening, filtering,
centrifuging, pressing, or other suitable techniques. The resulting liquid extract,
which has been separated from the fibrous solids, is then preferably treated with
citric acid to inhibit fermentation. The resulting cactus extract is most effective as a
water-oil separator and is accompanied by a detergent activator.
Alkylpolyglycosides
Oxalkylated alkylpolyglycosides have a low toxicity and are biodegradable [129].
The amount of demulsifier to be used to break crude oil emulsions is related to
the mass of the emulsion. The maximal mass is 1-1000 ppm; the temperature is
preferably 40-80 ◦C.
Lignocellulose
Lignocellulosic solutions from the oil palm empty fruit bunch organosolv pulping
process were tested as demulsifiers for the demulsification of crude oil emulsion
using a model of water-in-oil emulsion of crude oil and brine solution [130].
The results of the study indicated that the demulsification performance was
favored when only a lignin compound was contained in the demulsifier. The phase
separation capacity and rate were strongly affected by brine pH values, temperatures,
and demulsifier dosages. Complete phase separation capacity was achieved at
optimum conditions. It was found that the separated oil and water are useful for a
refining process and a water treatment, respectively [130].
Biosurfactants
Most of the used chemical demulsifiers, although effective, are environmental
contaminants and do not meet the desired levels of biodegradation. The application
of microbial biosurfactants as potential natural demulsifiers of petroleum derivatives
in water emulsions was investigated [131].
Biosurfactants crude extracts, produced by yeasts (Candida guilliermondii, Can￾dida lipolytica, and Candida sphaerica) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Pseudomonas cepacia, and Bacillus sp.) grown in industrial residues, were tested
for their demulsification capacity in their crude and pure forms [131].
The demulsification performance on motor oil emulsions and model emulsions
were evaluated by determining percentage oil separation ratio (OSR), water separa￾tion ratio (WSR), and emulsion breaking ratio (EBR) using the following equations:
OSR = VSTO
VOOE × 100 (23.1)
WSR = VWB
VWOE + VAM × 100 (23.2)References 997

CMC, critical micelle concentration.
EBR = 1 − VRM
VOOE + VWOE + VAM × 100 (23.3)
Here, VSTO is the volume of separate top oil layer, VOOE is the volume of oil
in the original emulsion, VWB is the volume of water at the bottom, VWOE is the
volume of water in the original emulsion, VAM is the volume of added material, and
VRM is the volume of remaining emulsion.
The biosurfactants that showed the best demulsification results identified by
statistical tests are shown in Table 23.10.
The critical micelle concentration (CMC) is that in which the lowest stable surface
tension is reached [132].
The best results obtained were for bacterial biosurfactants, which were able to
recover about 65% of the seawater emulsified with motor oil compared to 35-40%
only for yeasts products [131].
Biosurfactants were also tested with oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil
(W/O) kerosene model emulsions. No relationship between interfacial tension,
cell hydrophobicity, and demulsification ratios was observed with all the tested
biosurfactants [131].
