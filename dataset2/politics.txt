Praise for the 6th edition
‘Politics is a wide-ranging and indispensable textbook for covering all the basics of the study of politics without sacrificing 
nuanced analysis of crucial concepts. From ideology to global governance, this book does it all!’
– Stefanie Fishel, University of the Sunshine Coast, Australia
‘An admirable overview of crucial concepts and categories, providing a welcome introduction to the study of politics. By 
both situating its chapters in historical material and providing contemporary examples “in action” today, students should 
be well prepared to pursue study of any material that strikes their interest.’
– Philip D. Bunn, Covenant College, USA
‘Politics remains the go to textbook as an entry point into the study of political science. The “Politics in Action” boxes 
help to bring the subject matter alive and the use of diverse examples challenges students to think beyond their own 
preconceived views.’
– Tom Caygill, Nottingham Trent University, UK 
‘Heywood’s text remains the standout introduction to the general study of Politics and its various sub-disciplines. It is 
essential for any foundational course on politics across the academic spectrum and remains a key reference point for 
anyone working in areas that engage with the political process.’
– Owen Worth, University of Limerick, Ireland
‘The volume gives an excellent overview on what are relevant questions, discussions, topics and theories when studying 
politics. Having “To-the-Point” boxes on key concepts and thinkers, discussions, and politics in action, makes the book an 
entertaining as well as instructive read.’
– Rolf Frankenberger, University of Tübingen, Germany
‘Clearly constructed and empirically grounded, this book offers students critical insights on the nature and complexity of 
politics across a broad range of themes.’
– Caitlin Mollica, University of Newcastle, Australia 
Praise for earlier editions
‘Heywood’s Politics is by far the best introductory text to political science currently on the market. It does an excellent job 
of introducing vital concepts for the study of politics in an accessible, easy to grasp format.’
– Johannes van Gorp, American University of Sharjah, UAE
‘As with every edition that has preceded this latest, updated edition, Andrew Heywood manages to render complex 
concepts, ideas, institutions and debates accessible and engaging for students. This is a comprehensive and incredibly 
useful resource for both student and educator alike.’
– Narelle Miragliotta, Monash University, Australia
‘Heywood’s Politics stands out as one of the most comprehensive and accessible textbooks in the market. Students will 
benefit especially from its illustrations of case studies and debates in politics.’
– James Wong, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong
‘Politics remains the text that still best hits the sweet spot between accessibility and academic sophistication.’
– Stephen Thornton, Cardiff University, UK
‘This book is a marvel of erudition and compilation. It is accessible and user friendly. It remains the first stop for lecturers 
and students studying Politics.’
– Cillian McGrattan, University of Ulster, Ireland

PREFACE TO THE SIXTH 
EDITION
As the old maxim goes, ‘a week is a long time in politics’. And from the standpoint 
of the fifth edition of Politics, five years has been a particularly long time. Not long 
after its release in 2019, the Covid-19 pandemic swept the globe, claiming millions 
of lives and posing one of the most formidable challenges of the twenty-first century 
to governments around the world. The pandemic’s disruption of the global supply 
chain triggered an inflation crisis whose after-effects continue to be felt everywhere, 
reinforcing the notion that no country is truly an island in our increasingly globalized 
world.
The past five years have also witnessed a continuation of the decline in global 
democracy. Some transitions have been dramatic and overtly autocratic, such as 
the resumption of a military dictatorship in Myanmar in 2021 and the return of 
Taliban rule in Afghanistan that same year. Yet the greatest contributor has been 
the growing phenomenon of democratic backsliding, and the devolution of many 
political regimes into what might be described as ‘flawed’ democracies or hybrid 
regimes, in which democracy is only partial, even nominal. From Central America 
to Eastern Europe, from Southeast Asia to the Middle East, democracy has seemingly 
been in slow but steady retreat. Even in established democracies, the rise of populist 
politics and growing public discontent has presented unprecedented challenges to 
the traditional democratic order, no better demonstrated than by the storming of 
the United States Capitol in 2021 in an attempt to stop the legitimate election of 
President Joe Biden.
And yet everywhere, too, there have been signs of the public fighting back. The 
murder of George Floyd in May of 2020 sparked protests across the United States and 
the world, and a renewed focus on the institutional racism, inequality and injustice 
that persists in many societies. Widespread protests and revolt in Iran beginning in 
2022, led particularly by women, have posed one of the most serious challenges to 
its authoritarian Islamist regime since its inception. Popular uprisings have deposed 
autocratic elites and corrupt governments in Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan and Mali. And 
the valiant efforts of Ukraine to ward off an outright invasion by Russia have become 
a global symbol for the ongoing popular struggle for peace and freedom against 
authoritarianism.
This textbook has long sought to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date 
introduction to the study of politics. It is designed to be of use to students taking 
courses in any field of the discipline, as well as general readers with an interest in 
the subject. As such, this edition, like those previous, seeks to identify the actors, 
institutions, ideas, theories and themes that are the enduring building blocks of 
politics, while exploring their application and relevance through contemporary 
political developments. Chapter 5, for instance, has been largely rewritten to better 
capture the complexity of global political regimes, new ways of measuring and

classifying what constitutes democracy and new developments in its manifestation. 
Many chapters have been revised to account for the impact of populism on political 
institutions and practices; new scholarship around race and gender in politics; new 
issues in global policing, security and governance; and new ideas and developments 
in governance, political economy, globalization, law and the media.
The nature and significance of these and other major developments in contemporary 
politics are also discussed in a brand new set of ‘Politics in Action’ features. In 
recognition of the traditionally Western perspectives and examples presented in 
many political texts, new case studies have been purposefully chosen from a much 
wider pool of international examples in this edition, including topics as diverse as 
the rise of pirate parties in Europe (Chapter 2); democratic backsliding in Hungary 
(Chapter 5); the debate over Taiwanese nationalism (Chapter 6); India’s mixture of 
statist and market economics (Chapter 7); Bolivia’s Movement for Socialism (Chapter 
8); direct democracy in Switzerland (Chapter 10); the one-party state model of 
China (Chapter 11); the authoritarian turn in Turkey (Chapter 14); the balance of 
executive and legislative power in Uruguay (Chapter 15); the role of the civil service 
in Botswana (Chapter 16); the Tigray War in Ethiopia (Chapter 17); and the war 
against drugs in Mexico (Chapter 18). These new examples help to demonstrate the 
universality of many political concepts, theories and behaviours, while highlighting 
the diversity of political practice in our world.
We would like to thank all those at Bloomsbury who contributed to the development 
and production of this edition, particularly Emily Plater, and Elizabeth Holmes, who 
oversaw the production process. Feedback on the proposal and chapter plan for the 
sixth edition from a number of anonymous reviewers was both thought-provoking 
and encouraging.

USING THIS BOOK
Politics is, by its nature, an overlapping and interlocking field. The material encountered 
in this book therefore resists compartmentalization, which is why throughout there 
is regular cross-referencing to related discussions that occur in other chapters and 
particularly to relevant boxed material found elsewhere. Nevertheless, the book 
develops by considering what can be thought of as a series of broad issues or themes.
The first group of chapters is designed to provide a background understanding for 
the study of politics by considering a range of key conceptual and theoretical issues.
 Chapter 1 reflects on the nature of politics, provides an introduction to contrasting 
approaches to political analysis and considers how and why globalizing tendencies 
have reshaped our understanding of the subject.
 Chapter 2 examines political ideas from the perspective of the major ideological 
traditions, looking at how they offer competing ‘lenses’ on the political world.
 Chapter 3 considers the importance of the state in politics, examining debates 
about both the nature and the desirable role of the state, as well as whether the 
state is losing its central importance in politics.
 Chapter 4 discusses the nature and significance of political legitimacy, in particular 
the relationship between legitimacy and democracy, especially in the light of 
contrasting models of democratic governance and debates about how democracy 
operates in practice.
 Chapter 5 provides an introduction to the machinery of government by considering 
how systems of government are classified and examining the range of political 
regimes that exist in the modern world.
 Chapter 6 examines the key theories of nationalism, seeking both to understand the 
forces that underpin national identity and to reflect on the breadth of nationalist 
traditions, including their often quite different political implications.
The next group of chapters discusses the dynamics of political interaction by 
reflecting on the relationship between politics and economics, culture and society, 
and by examining the mechanisms through which societal pressures gain political 
expression.
 Chapter 7 discusses the linkages between economics and politics, focusing 
especially on the nature and different forms of capitalism, and on the dynamics 
and implications of economic globalization.
 Chapter 8 considers the relationship between politics and society, and reflects on 
the rise of identity politics, the different forms it has taken and its implications.
 Chapter 9 discusses the nature and significance of political culture, and examines 
the growing political importance of the media, including social media, especially 
in relation to its implications for democracy and governance.
9781350356801_txt_print_FM.indd 16 23-07-2024 18:11:22USING THIS BOOK xvii
 Chapter 10 looks at the nature of representation, the role of elections, including 
debates and controversies about electoral systems, and how voting behaviour can 
best be understood.
 Chapter 11 examines the key role played in politics by political parties, and also 
discusses the nature and significance of different party systems.
 Chapter 12 discusses the nature of group politics, including debates about 
the impact of groups on the distribution of political power, and the rise and 
implications of social movements.
The following group of chapters considers the machinery of government and the 
processes through which public policy is formulated and implemented.
 Chapter 13 considers the nature and purpose of constitutions, and examines the 
relationship between politics and law, notably in terms of the role and importance 
of the judiciary.
 Chapter 14 addresses the role of political executives, where power lies within the 
executive and, more broadly, the significance of political leadership and the forms 
it can take.
 Chapter 15 examines the role of assemblies or legislatures, considering also the 
significance of their internal organization and the factors that affect their impact 
on policy-making.
 Chapter 16 focuses on public policy, reflecting both on how decisions are made and 
the stages through which policy is developed; it also considers the link between 
bureaucracies and the policy process, as well as wider political developments.
The next group of chapters focuses on various issues that highlight overlaps between 
the domestic realm and the international realm, paying particular attention to the 
growing significance of global politics.
 Chapter 17 discusses multilevel politics, examining the territorial configuration 
of politics at a domestic level and at a transnational level, especially through 
regionalism.
 Chapter 18 focuses on the issue of security, examining the maintenance of order 
and security in the domestic realm, as well as debates about security in its national, 
international and global forms.
 Chapter 19 looks at the changing shape of twenty-first-century world order, 
reflecting on its significance for peace and stability, and also examines the nature 
and effectiveness of the emerging framework of global governance.
The final chapter attempts to draw together strands and themes that have featured in 
earlier chapters through a discussion of the alleged failings of conventional politics 
and how these failings may be addressed.
 Chapter 20 reflects on the issue of growing disenchantment with formal politics, 
examining both the nature and sources of popular discontent with politics and 
discussing possible ways of mending politics.

FOCUS ON . . . 
A social contract is a voluntary agreement made amongst individuals through which an organized
society, or state, is brought into existence. Used as a theoretical device by thinkers such as
Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau (see p. 105), the social contract has been revived by modern
theorists such as John Rawls (see p. 35). The social contract is seldom regarded as a historical
act. Rather, it is used as a means of demonstrating the value of government and the grounds of
political obligation; social-contract theorists wish individuals to act as if they had concluded the 
contract themselves. In its classic form, social-contract theory has three elements:
n The image of a hypothetical stateless society (or ‘state of nature’) is established. 
Unconstrained freedom means anarchy, and that for most life, is ‘solitary, poor, nasty,
brutish and short’ (Hobbes 1651).
n Individuals therefore seek to escape from this state of nature by entering into a social 
contract, recognizing that only a sovereign power can secure order and stability.
n The social contract obliges citizens to respect and obey the state, ultimately in gratitude 
for the stability and security that only a system of political rule can deliver.

KEY THINKER
English philosopher and politician. Locke studied medicine at Oxford University before becoming 
secretary to Anthony Ashley Cooper, an influential politician during the English Civil War and 
the Stuart Restoration. Locke’s political views were developed amidst these turbulent times, and 
are often seen as providing a justification for the ‘Glorious Revolution’ of 1688, which ended 
absolutist rule and established a constitutional monarchy in Britain. Locke was a key philosopher 
of early liberalism, placing particular emphasis on ‘natural’ or God-given rights, identified as the 
rights to life, liberty and property. An exponent of representative government and toleration,
Locke’s views had a considerable impact on the American Revolution. His most important
political works are A Letter Concerning Toleration (1689) and Two Treatises of Government(1690).

POLITICS IN ACTION
These engaging case studies 
examine some of the major 
events that have shaped, or are 
shaping, politics across the globe 
and help you to understand their 
significance for political analysis. 
DEBATING
Here, arguments for and against particular 
perspectives on a series of key controversies in 
politics are examined and highlighted.
DEBATING . . .
CAN POLITICS EXIST WITHOUT IDEOLOGY?
The term ‘ideology’ has traditionally carried pejorative implications, often expressed through predictions of its imminent 
(and usually welcome) demise. Nevertheless, despite its varied obituaries, political ideology has stubbornly refused to die. 
While particular ideologies may rise or fall, ideological forms of politics seem to be an enduring feature of world history. Is
politics intrinsically linked to ideology? Or may politics finally be able to emerge from the shadow cast by ideological belief?
KEY IDEAS
In Chapter 2, these boxes 
help to explain the key themes 
that characterize some of 
the world’s most well-known 
political ideologies: Liberalism, 
Conservatism, Socialism, 
Feminism and Green Ideology.
KEY IDEAS
LIBERALISM
n Individualism: Individualism (see p. 197) is the core principle of liberal ideology. It reflects a belief in the supreme 
importance of the human individual as opposed to any social group or collective body. Human beings are seen, first 
and foremost, as individuals. This implies both that they are of equal moral worth and that they possess separate and 
unique identities. The liberal goal is therefore to construct a society within which individuals can flourish and develop, 
each pursuing ‘the good’ as he or she defines it, to the best of his or her abilities. This has contributed to the view that 
liberalism is morally neutral, in the sense that it lays down a set of rules that allow individuals to make their own moral 
decisions.
n Freedom: Individual freedom (see p. 332), or liberty (the two terms are interchangeable), is the core value of 
liberalism; it is given priority over, say, equality, justice or authority. This arises naturally from a belief in the individual
and the desire to ensure that each person is able to act as he or she chooses. Nevertheless, liberals advocate ‘freedom 
under the law’, as they recognize that one person’s liberty may be a threat to the liberty of others. They therefore
endorse the ideal that individuals should enjoy the maximum possible liberty consistent with protecting the same 
liberties for others.
n Reason: Liberals believe that the world has a rational structure, and that this can be uncovered through the exercise 
of human reason and by critical enquiry. This inclines them to place their faith in the ability of individuals to make wise 
judgements on their own behalf, being, in most cases, the best judges of their own interests. It also encourages liberals 
rather than bloodshed and war.
n Equality: Individualism implies a belief in foundational equality: that is, the belief that individuals are born equal, 
at least in terms of moral worth. This is reflected in a liberal commitment to equal rights and entitlements, notably 
in the form of legal equality (‘equality before the law’) and political equality (‘one person, one vote; one vote, one 
value’). However, as individuals do not possess the same levels of talent or willingness to work, liberals do not endorse 
social equality or an equality of outcome. Rather, they favour equality of opportunity that gives all individuals an equal 
chance to realize their unequal potential.

 What are the main approaches to the study of politics as an academic discipline?

PREVIEW
Politics exists because people disagree. How should we live? Who gets what? How should power and other resources 
be distributed? Which values and ideas are important? What rules should we live by? And so on. People also disagree 
about how such matters should be resolved. How should decisions be made? Who should have a say? How much 
influence should each person have? And so forth. For Aristotle, this makes politics the ‘master science’: that is, 
nothing less than the activity through which human beings attempt to improve their lives and create a good society.
Politics is, above all, a social activity. It is always a dialogue, and never a monologue. A lone individual on an 
otherwise uninhabited island may be able to create a basic economy, produce art, establish traditions and so on. But 
there is no politics on this island until someone else shows up and starts arguing for their share of, say, food or water.
Like many broad areas of human endeavour, it can be hard to precisely define what constitutes ‘politics’. 
Traditionally, politics tends to get defined narrowly as the interactions that take place within government or on 
issues of public interest. Yet when considered more broadly, politics can be found everywhere, from how a national 
budget gets allocated to how a family divides up the weekly chores. Indeed, the political scientist Wallace Sayre 
once wryly observed that political intensity seemed to be inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake. 
Hundreds of billions of dollars are allocated every year to government programmes that may elicit very little 
scrutiny or debate, yet a dispute between siblings over who is doing their fair share around the house can get very 
political very quickly.
Disagreement about the nature of politics as an academic discipline means that it embraces a range of 
theoretical approaches and a variety of schools of analysis. Politics intersects with a great many disciplines, from 
sociology to economics and even neuroscience, and lines between these disciplines are not always easy to draw. 
Traditionally, ‘politics’ has constituted a separate field from ‘international relations’. Yet globalizing tendencies have 
encouraged some to speculate that the disciplinary divide between the two is becoming redundant.

DEFINING POLITICS
Politics, in its broadest sense, is the activity through which people make, preserve 
and amend the general rules under which they live. Politics is thus inextricably linked 
to the phenomena of conflict and cooperation. On the one hand, the existence of 
rival opinions, different wants, competing needs and opposing interests guarantees 
disagreement about the rules under which people live. On the other hand, people 
recognize that, in order to influence these rules or ensure that they are upheld, they 
must work with others – hence Hannah Arendt’s (see p. 8) definition of political 
power as ‘acting in concert’ (Arendt 1958). This is why the heart of politics is often 
portrayed as a process of conflict resolution, in which rival views or competing 
interests are reconciled. However, politics in this broad sense is better thought of as 
the search for conflict resolution than as its achievement, as not all conflicts are, or 
can be, resolved. Nevertheless, the inescapable presence of diversity (we are not all 
alike) and scarcity (there is never enough to go around) ensures that politics is an 
inevitable feature of the human condition.
Any attempt to clarify the meaning of politics must nevertheless address two major 
problems. The first is the mass of associations that the word has when used in 
everyday language: politics is a loaded term. Whereas most people think of, say, 
economics, geography, history and biology simply as academic subjects, what the 
public perceives of as politics can be quite different. Politics is often thought of as a 
dirty word: it conjures up images of trouble, disruption and even violence on the one 
hand, and deceit, manipulation, corruption and lies on the other. There is nothing 
new about such associations. As long ago as 1775, Samuel Johnson dismissed politics 
as ‘nothing more than a means of rising in the world’, while in the nineteenth century 
the US historian Henry Adams summed up politics as ‘the systematic organization 
of hatreds’. It is also an area where passions and suspicions run deep. Many, for 
instance, automatically assume that students and teachers of politics must in some 
way be biased, finding it difficult to believe that the subject can be approached in an 
impartial and dispassionate manner.
The second difficulty is that even respected authorities cannot agree what the subject 
is about. Politics can be defined as the exercise of power, the science of government, 
the making of collective decisions, the allocation of scarce resources, the practice 
of deception and manipulation and so on. The virtue of the definition advanced in 
this text – ‘the making, preserving and amending of general social rules’ – is that 
it is sufficiently broad to encompass most, if not all, of the competing definitions. 
However, problems arise when the definition is unpacked, or when the meaning 
is refined. For instance, does ‘politics’ refer to a particular way in which rules are 
made, preserved or amended (that is, peacefully, by debate), or to all such processes? 
Similarly, is politics practised in all social contexts and institutions, or only in certain 
ones (that is, government and public life)? From this perspective, politics may be 
treated as an ‘essentially contested’ concept, in the sense that the term has many 
acceptable or legitimate meanings (concepts which are discussed more fully later in 
the chapter).
It is helpful, however, to distinguish between two broad approaches that have 
traditionally been taken when defining politics (Hay 2002; Leftwich 2004). In 
Conflict: Competition 
between opposing forces, 
reflecting a diversity of 
opinions, preferences, 
needs or interests.
Cooperation: Working 
together; achieving goals 
through collective action.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_1.indd 2 23-07-2024 12:44:13WHAT IS POLITICS? 3
the first, politics is associated with an arena or location, in which case behaviour 
becomes ‘political’ because of where it takes place. In the second, politics is viewed as 
a process or mechanism, in which case ‘political’ behaviour is behaviour that exhibits 
distinctive characteristics or qualities, and so can take place in any, and perhaps 
every, social context. Each of these broad approaches has spawned alternative 
definitions of politics and has helped shape different schools of political analysis (see 
Figure 1.1). Indeed, the debate about ‘what is politics?’ is worth pursuing precisely 
because it exposes some of the deepest intellectual and ideological disagreement in 
the academic study of the subject.

Politics as the art of government
Chancellor Otto von Bismarck once told the German Reichstag ‘Politics is not a 
science, as the professors are apt to suppose. It is an art’. The art Bismarck had in mind 
was the art of government, the exercise of control within society through the making 
and enforcement of collective decisions. This is perhaps the classical definition of 
politics, developed from the original meaning of the term in Ancient Greece.
The word ‘politics’ is derived from polis, which literally means ‘city-state’. The Ancient 
Greek world was divided into a collection of independent city-states, each of which 
possessed its own system of government. The most enduringly influential of these 
city-states was Athens, often portrayed as the cradle of democratic government. In 
this light, politics can be understood to refer to the affairs of the polis. From this 
word we derive the modern term polity, a group of people who work together as 
an organized political entity. The modern form of this definition is therefore ‘what 
concerns the polity or state’ (see p. 61). This view of politics is evident in the everyday 
use of the term: people are said to be ‘in politics’ when they hold public office, or 
to be ‘entering politics’ when they seek to do so. When you speak of ‘politics’ to 
the average person, they are more likely to think of governments, elected officials, 
campaigning, public issues and so on. It is also a definition that academic political 
science has helped to perpetuate.
In many ways, this notion that politics amounts to ‘what concerns the state’ is the 
traditional view of the discipline, reflected in the tendency for academic study to 
focus on the personnel and machinery of government. This view is advanced in 
the writings of the influential US political scientist David Easton (1979, 1981), who 
Polis: The ‘city-state’ in 
Ancient Greek; a self￾governing city classically 
understood to imply 
the highest or most 
desirable form of social 
organization.
Polity: A society 
organized through the 
exercise of political 
authority; for Aristotle, 
rule by the many in the 
interests of all.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_1.indd 3 23-07-2024 12:44:134 POLITICS
defined politics as the ‘authoritative allocation of values’. By this, he meant that 
politics encompasses the various processes through which government responds 
to pressures from wider society, in particular by allocating benefits, rewards or 
penalties. ‘Authoritative values’ are therefore those that are widely accepted in society 
and are considered binding by the mass of citizens. In this view, politics is associated 
with ‘policy’ (see p. 399): that is, with formal decisions that establish a plan of action 
for the community.
However, what is striking about this definition is that it offers a highly restricted view 
of politics. It narrows politics to simply what is practised in cabinet rooms, legislative 
chambers, government departments and the like; and it is engaged in by a limited 
and specific group of people, notably politicians, civil servants and lobbyists. This 
means that most people, most institutions and most social activities can be regarded 
as being ‘outside’ politics. Businesses, schools and other educational institutions, 
community groups, families and so on are in this sense ‘non-political’, because they 
are not engaged in running the country. By the same token, to portray politics as an 
essentially state-bound activity is to ignore the increasingly important international 
or global influences on modern life, as discussed in the next main section.
A meeting of local citizens and interest groups in Douala, Cameroon in 2023 to 
discuss the problem of rising inter-tribal hostilities. Interactions such as these are 
by some definitions beyond the arena of formal politics, yet by others constitute 
the very heart of what politics is.

This definition of politics can be narrowed still further to those actors within 
government who are consciously motivated by ideological beliefs, and who seek 
to advance them through membership of a formal organization such as a political 
party. This is the sense in which politicians are described as ‘political’, whereas civil 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_1.indd 4 23-07-2024 12:44:14WHAT IS POLITICS? 5
servants are seen as ‘non-political’, as long as, of course, they act in a neutral and 
professional fashion. Similarly, judges are taken to be ‘non-political’ figures while 
they interpret the law impartially and in accordance with the available evidence, but 
they may be accused of being ‘political’ if their judgement is influenced by personal 
preferences or some other form of bias.
The link between politics and affairs of the state also helps to explain why negative 
or pejorative images have so often been attached to politics. This is because, in the 
popular mind, politics is closely associated with the activities of politicians. Put 
brutally, politicians are often seen as power-seeking hypocrites who conceal personal 
ambition behind the rhetoric of public service and ideological conviction. Indeed, 
this perception has become more widespread in the modern era, as intensified 
media exposure has more effectively brought to light examples of corruption and 
dishonesty, giving rise to the phenomenon of anti-politics (as discussed in Chapter
20). This rejection of the personnel and machinery of conventional political life is 
rooted in a view of politics as a self-serving and unprincipled activity, clearly evident 
in the use of derogatory phrases such as ‘office politics’ and ‘politicking’.
Such an image of politics is sometimes traced back to the writings of Niccolò 
Machiavelli, who in the sixteenth century developed an aggressively pragmatic 
account of politics that drew attention to the use by political leaders of cunning, 
manipulation and even cruelty to maintain power and achieve their goals. This cynical 
approach to politics reflects the essentially liberal perception that, as individuals are 
self-interested, political power is corrupting, because it encourages those in power 
to exploit their position for personal advantage at the expense of others. This is 
famously expressed in Lord Acton’s aphorism: ‘power tends to corrupt, and absolute 
power corrupts absolutely’.
Anti-politics:
Disillusionment with 
formal or established 
political processes, 
reflected in non￾participation, support for 
anti-system parties or 
the use of direct action.
Nevertheless, few who view politics in this way doubt that political activity is an 
inevitable and permanent feature of social existence. However venal some politicians 
may be, there is a general, if grudging, acceptance that they are always with us. 
Without some kind of mechanism for allocating authoritative values, society would

NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI (1469–1527)
Italian politician and author. The son of a civil lawyer, Machiavelli’s knowledge of public life 
was gained from a sometimes-precarious existence in politically unstable Florence. He 
served as Second Chancellor (1498–1512), and was dispatched on missions to France, 
Germany and throughout Italy. After a brief period of imprisonment and the restoration of 
Medici rule, Machiavelli embarked on a literary career. His major work, The Prince (1532), 
drew heavily on his first-hand observations of the statecraft of Cesare Borgia and the 
power politics that dominated his period. It was written as a guide for the future prince 
of a united Italy. The adjective ‘Machiavellian’ subsequently came to mean ‘cunning and 
duplicitous’. Source: Getty Images/

simply disintegrate into a civil war of each against all, as the early social-contract 
theorists argued (see p. 66). The task is therefore not to abolish politicians and bring 
politics to an end, but rather to ensure that politics is conducted within a framework 
of checks and constraints that guarantee that governmental power is not abused.
Politics as public affairs
A second and broader conception of politics moves it beyond the narrow realm of 
government to what is thought of as ‘public life’ or ‘public affairs’. In other words, the 
distinction between ‘the political’ and ‘the non-political’ coincides with the division 
between an essentially public sphere of life and what can be thought of as a private 
sphere. Such a view of politics is often traced back to the work of the famous Greek 
philosopher Aristotle. In Politics, Aristotle declared that ‘man is by nature a political 
animal’, by which he meant that it is only within a political community that human 
beings can live the ‘good life’. From this viewpoint, then, politics is an ethical activity 
concerned with creating a ‘just society’; it is what Aristotle called the ‘master science’.
However, where should the line between ‘public’ life and ‘private’ life be drawn? The 
traditional distinction between the public realm and the private realm conforms 
to the division between the state and civil society. The institutions of the state 
(the government, the courts, the police, the army, state schools and hospitals and 
so forth) can be regarded as ‘public’ in the sense that they are responsible for the 
collective organization and welfare of community life. Moreover, they are funded at 
the public’s expense, out of taxation. In contrast, civil society consists of institutions 
such as the family and kinship groups, private businesses, trade unions, clubs, 
community groups and so on. They are ‘private’ in the sense that they are set up and 
funded by individuals or groups to satisfy their own interests, rather than those of 
the larger society. On the basis of this public/private division, politics is restricted to 
the activities of the state itself and the responsibilities that are properly exercised by 
public bodies. Those areas of life that individuals can and do manage for themselves 
(the economic, social, domestic, personal, cultural and artistic spheres, and so on) 
are therefore clearly ‘non-political’.

ARISTOTLE (384–322 bce)
Greek philosopher. Aristotle was a student of Plato (see p. 13) and tutor of the young 
Alexander the Great. He established his own school of philosophy in Athens in 335 bce; 
this was called the ‘peripatetic school’ after his tendency to walk up and down as he talked. 
His twenty-two surviving treatises, compiled as lecture notes, range over logic, physics, 
metaphysics, astronomy, meteorology, biology, ethics and politics. In the Middle Ages, 
Aristotle’s work became the foundation of Islamic philosophy, and it was later incorporated 
into Christian theology. His best-known political work is Politics, in which he portrayed the 
city-state as the basis for virtue and well-being, and argued that democracy is preferable to 
oligarchy (see pp. 120–121).

An alternative public/private divide is sometimes defined in terms of subtler 
distinction; namely, that between ‘the political’ and ‘the personal’ (see Figure 1.2). 
Although civil society can be distinguished from the state, it nevertheless contains 
a range of institutions that are thought of as ‘public’ in the wider sense that they are 
open institutions, operating in public, to which the public has access. One of the 
crucial implications of this is that it broadens our notion of the political, transferring 
areas like the economy from the private to the public realm. A form of politics can 
thus be found in the marketplace and the workplace. Nevertheless, although this view 
regards institutions such as businesses, community groups, clubs and trade unions 
as ‘public’, it remains a restricted view of politics. According to this perspective, 
politics does not, and should not, infringe on ‘personal’ affairs and institutions.

apparatus of government

and so on
The notion that politics should exclude ‘the personal’ has nevertheless been 
challenged by feminist thinkers. From the feminist perspective, gender inequality 
has been preserved precisely because the sexual division of labour that runs through 
society has traditionally been thought of as ‘natural’ rather than ‘political’. The public 
sphere of life, encompassing politics, work, art and literature, has historically been 
the preserve of men, while women have been confined to an essentially private 
existence, centred on the family and domestic responsibilities. If politics takes 
place only within the public sphere, the role of women and the question of gender 
equality are issues of little or no political importance. Not only does this in effect 
exclude women from politics, but, as radical feminists (discussed in Chapter 2)
in particular argue, it excludes from political analysis the core processes through 
which male domination and female subordination are brought about. These include 
conditioning of gender roles and expectations within the family, the distribution 
of housework and other domestic responsibilities, and the politics of personal and 
sexual conduct.
The view of politics as an essentially ‘public’ activity has generated both positive 
and negative connotations. In a tradition dating back to Aristotle, politics has 
been seen as a noble and enlightened activity precisely because of its ‘public’ 
character. This position was firmly endorsed by Hannah Arendt, who argued in 
The Human Condition (1958) that politics is the most important form of human 
CONCEPT
Civil society
Civil society originally 
meant a ‘political 
community’. The term 
is now more commonly 
distinguished from the 
state, and is used to 
describe institutions 
that are ‘private’, in that 
they are independent 
from government and 
organized by individuals 
in pursuit of their own 
ends. Civil society 
therefore refers to a 
realm of autonomous 
groups and associations: 
businesses, interest 
groups, clubs, families 
and so on. The term 
‘global civil society’ has 
become fashionable as 
a means of referring 
to non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) 
(see p. 302) and 
transnational social 
movements (see p. 115).

activity because it involves interaction amongst free and equal citizens. It thus 
gives meaning to life and affirms the uniqueness of each individual. Theorists 
such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau (see p. 105) and John Stuart Mill (see p. 245)
who portrayed political participation as a good in itself have drawn similar 
conclusions. Rousseau argued that only through the direct and continuous 
participation of all citizens in political life can the state be bound to the common 
good, or what he called the ‘general will’. In Mill’s view, involvement in public 
affairs is educational, in that it promotes the personal, moral and intellectual 
development of the individual.

German political theorist and philosopher. Hannah Arendt was brought up in a middle-class 
Jewish family. She fled Germany in 1933 to escape from Nazism, and finally settled in the 
USA, where her major works were written. Her wide-ranging, even idiosyncratic, writing 
was influenced by the existentialism of Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) and Karl Jaspers 
(1883–1969); she described it as ‘thinking without barriers’. Her major works include The 
Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), which drew parallels between Nazi Germany and Stalinist 
Russia, her major philosophical work The Human Condition (1958), On Revolution (1963)
and Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963). The final work stimulated controversy because it stressed 
the ‘banality of evil’, by portraying Eichmann as a Nazi functionary rather than as a raving 
ideologue. Source: Getty Images/

In sharp contrast, however, politics as public activity has also been portrayed as a form 
of unwanted interference. Liberal theorists, in particular, have exhibited a preference 
for civil society over the state, on the grounds that private life is a realm of choice, 
personal freedom and individual responsibility. This is most clearly demonstrated by 
attempts to narrow the realm of what is considered political, commonly expressed 
as the wish to ‘keep politics out of ’ private activities such as business, sport and 
family life. From this point of view, politics is unwholesome quite simply because it 
prevents people acting as they choose. For example, it may interfere with how firms 
conduct their business, or with how and with whom we play sports, or with how we 
bring up our children.
Politics as compromise and consensus
The third conception of politics relates not to the arena within which politics is 
conducted but to the way in which decisions are made. Specifically, politics is seen 
as a particular means of resolving conflict: that is, by compromise, conciliation and 
negotiation, rather than through force and naked power. This is what is implied when 
politics is portrayed as ‘the art of the possible’. Such a definition is inherent in the 
everyday use of the term. For instance, the description of a solution to a problem as 
a ‘political’ solution implies peaceful debate and arbitration, as opposed to what is 
often called a ‘military’ solution. One of the leading modern exponents of this view 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_1.indd 8 23-07-2024 12:44:15WHAT IS POLITICS? 9
is Bernard Crick. In his classic study In Defence of Politics (1962), Crick offered the 
following definition:
Politics [is] the activity by which differing interests within a given unit of rule are 
conciliated by giving them a share in power in proportion to their importance to 
the welfare and the survival of the whole community. 
In this view, the key to politics is therefore a wide dispersal of power. Accepting 
that conflict is inevitable, Crick argued that when social groups and interests 
possess power they must be conciliated; they cannot merely be crushed. This is 
why he portrayed politics as ‘that solution to the problem of order which chooses 
conciliation rather than violence and coercion’ (Crick 1962). Such a view of politics 
reflects a deep commitment to liberal–rationalist principles. It is based on resolute 
faith in the efficacy of debate and discussion, as well as on the belief that society is 
characterized by consensus, rather than by irreconcilable conflict. In other words, the 
disagreements that exist can be resolved without resort to intimidation and violence. 
Critics, however, point out that Crick’s conception of politics is heavily biased 
towards the form of politics that takes place in Western pluralist democracies: in 
effect, he equated politics with electoral choice and party competition. As a result, his 
model has little to tell us about, say, one-party states, theocracies or military regimes.
This view of politics has an unmistakably positive character. Politics is certainly 
no utopian solution. Compromise means that concessions are made by all sides, 
leaving no one perfectly satisfied, yet it is undoubtedly preferable to the alternatives: 
bloodshed and brutality. In this sense, politics can be seen as a civilizing force. People 
should be encouraged to respect politics as an activity and should be prepared to 
engage in the political life of their own community.
Nevertheless, when politics is a process of compromise it is also necessarily difficult. 
Listening carefully to the opinions of others, reconciling vastly different opinions, 
weighing and debating options, and building a consensus is not easy and may take 
considerable time. Frustration with this process may readily contribute to popular 
disenchantment with democratic politics. This frustration is sometime expressed in 
the rise of populism (see pp. 55–58) and in the emergence of a style of politics that 
disdains compromise, and places much more emphasis on decisive action, dramatic 
change and political conflict. The election of various populists to high office around 
the world in recent years (see p. 12) is thought by some to illustrate this trend.
Politics as power
The fourth definition of politics is both the broadest and the most radical. Rather 
than confining politics to a particular sphere (the government, the state or the ‘public’ 
realm), this view sees politics at work in all social activities and in every corner of 
human existence. As Adrian Leftwich proclaimed in What is Politics? The Activity and 
Its Study, ‘politics is at the heart of all collective social activity, formal and informal, 
public and private, in all human groups, institutions and societies’ (2004). In this 
sense, politics takes place at every level of social interaction; it can be found within 
families and amongst small groups of friends just as much as amongst nations and on 
the global stage. However, what is it that is distinctive about political activity? What 
marks off politics from any other form of social behaviour?
CONCEPT
Consensus
Consensus means 
agreement, but it refers 
to an agreement of 
a particular kind. It 
implies, first, a broad 
agreement, the terms of 
which are accepted by a 
wide range of individuals 
or groups. Second, it 
implies an agreement 
about fundamental or 
underlying principles, 
as opposed to a 
precise or exact 
agreement. In other 
words, a consensus 
permits disagreement 
on matters of 
emphasis or detail. A 
procedural consensus 
is a willingness to make 
decisions through a 
process of consultation 
and bargaining. A 
substantive consensus is 
an overlap of ideological 
positions that reflect 
agreement about broad 
policy goals.

At its broadest, politics concerns the production, distribution and use of resources. 
In essence it is power: the ability to achieve a desired outcome, through whatever 
means. This notion was neatly summed up in the title of Harold Lasswell’s book 
Politics: Who Gets What, When, How? (1936). From this perspective, politics is about 
diversity and conflict, but the essential ingredient is the existence of scarcity: the 
simple fact that, while human needs and desires are infinite, the resources available 
to satisfy them are always limited. Politics can therefore be seen as a struggle over 
scarce resources, and power can be seen as the means through which this struggle is 
conducted. Power is that ability to decide how those scarce resources are allocated.
Often discussed alongside power is the concept of authority, which we can think of 
as the legitimate or accepted use of power. While some disputes over resources and 
rules may be resolved through the raw application of power, through inducement, 
coercion or even outright warfare, most contemporary political battles are for 
authority. Winning elections and securing public favour gives leaders the perceived 
right – the authority – to make decisions and to use the power and resources of state 
to achieve their goals. Their power is intrinsically linked to that authority, though, 
and they are powerful only so long as they are in office or have the backing of the 
public, their party or other institutions. Once that authority has been revoked, so 
goes most of their power.
Advocates of the view of politics as power include feminists and Marxists. The rise 
of the women’s liberation movement in the 1960s and 1970s, bringing with it a 
growing interest in feminism, stimulated more radical thinking about the nature 
of ‘the political’. Not only have modern feminists sought to expand the arenas in 
which politics can be seen to take place, a notion most boldly asserted through 
the radical feminist slogan ‘the personal is the political’, but they have also tended 
to view politics as a process, specifically one related to the exercise of power over 
others. This view was summed by Kate Millett in Sexual Politics (1970), in which 
she defined politics as ‘power-structured relationships, arrangements whereby one 
group of persons is controlled by another’. Starting with fathers in families and 
the raising of children, Millet argues that male dominance is rewarded and female 
passivity encouraged, leading to an ubiquitous sense of perceived male authority 
that underpins the power structures of every area of society, from religion to 
government to business (Millet 1970).
Marxists, for their part, have used the term ‘politics’ in two senses. On one level, 
Marx (see p. 43) used ‘politics’ in a conventional sense to refer to the apparatus of 
the state. In the Communist Manifesto (1848), he also referred to political power 
as ‘the organized power of one class for oppressing another’. For Marx, politics, 
together with law and culture, are part of a ‘superstructure’ that is distinct from the 
economic ‘base’ that is the real foundation of social life. However, he did not see the 
economic base and the legal and political superstructure as entirely separate. He 
believed that the superstructure arose out of, and reflected, the economic base. At 
a deeper level, political power, in this view, is therefore rooted in the class system; 
as Lenin (see p. 107) put it, ‘politics is the most concentrated form of economics’ 
(Lenin 1973). Thus, for Marxists, it is socio-economic relationships that constitute 
the heart of politics.
CONCEPT
Power
Power, in its broadest 
sense, is the ability 
to achieve a desired 
outcome, sometimes 
seen as the ‘power to’ do 
something. This includes 
everything from the 
ability to keep oneself 
alive to the ability of 
government to promote 
economic growth. In 
politics, however, power 
is usually thought of as 
a relationship; that is, as 
the ability to influence 
the behaviour of others 
in a manner not of their 
choosing. This implies 
having ‘power over’ 
people. More narrowly, 
power may be associated 
with the ability to punish 
or reward, bringing 
it close to force or 
manipulation, in contrast 
to ‘influence’ (see faces 
of power, p. 11).
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_1.indd 10 23-07-2024 12:44:15WHAT IS POLITICS? 11
Views such as these portray politics in largely negative terms. Politics is, quite simply, 
about oppression and subjugation. Radical feminists hold that society is patriarchal, 
in that women are systematically subordinated and subjected to male power. 
Marxists traditionally argued that politics in a capitalist society is characterized 
by the exploitation of the poorer classes by the wealthier ones. On the other hand, 
these negative implications are balanced against the fact that politics is also seen 
as an emancipating force, a means through which injustice and domination can be 
challenged. Marx, for instance, predicted that class exploitation would be overthrown 
by a working-class revolution, and radical feminists proclaim the need for gender 
relations to be reordered through a sexual revolution.
However, it is also clear that when politics is portrayed as power it need not be seen 
as an inevitable feature of social existence. Feminists look to an end of ‘sexual politics’ 
achieved through the construction of a non-sexist society, in which people will be 
valued according to personal worth, rather than on the basis of gender. Marxists 
believe that ‘class politics’ will end with the establishment of a classless communist 
society. This, in turn, will eventually lead to the ‘withering away’ of the state, also 
bringing politics in the conventional sense to an end.
FOCUS ON . . . 
‘FACES’ OF POWER
Power can be said to be exercised whenever A gets B to do something that B would not 
otherwise have done. However, A can influence B in various ways. This allows us to distinguish 
between different dimensions or ‘faces’ of power:
 Power as decision-making: This face of power consists of conscious actions that in 
some way influence the content of decisions. It is what most people think of power as 
being – the ability to determine or influence outcomes, such as a getting a law passed or 
shaping how a budget gets allocated. The classic account of this form of power is found 
in Robert Dahl’s Who Governs? Democracy and Power in an American City (1961), which 
made judgements about who had power by analysing decisions in the light of the known 
preferences of the actors involved.
 Power as agenda setting: The second face of power, as suggested by Bachrach and 
Baratz (1962), is the ability to shape which decisions get made in the first place, and 
how they are made. An individual does not necessarily have to a be decision-maker to 
be powerful – if they control which issues are brought to a decision-maker, how they 
are framed and what options are presented, the second face of powerful can be just as 
important, if not more, than the first.
 Power as thought control: The third face of power is the ability to influence another 
by shaping what he or she thinks, wants or needs. This is power expressed as ideological 
indoctrination or even psychological control. This is what Steven Lukes (1974) called the 
‘radical’ view of power, and it overlaps with the notion of ‘soft’ power (see p. 480). In 
political life, the exercise of this form of power is seen in the use of propaganda and, more 
generally, in the impact of ideology (see p. 238).
CONCEPT
Authority
Authority can most 
simply be defined as 
‘legitimate power’. 
Whereas power is the 
ability to influence the 
behaviour of others, 
authority is the right 
to do so. Authority is 
therefore based on an 
acknowledged duty to 
obey rather than on 
any form of coercion 
or manipulation. In this 
sense, authority is power 
cloaked in legitimacy 
or rightfulness. Weber 
(see p. 87) distinguished 
between three kinds of 
authority, based on the 
different grounds on 
which obedience can be 
established: traditional 
authority is rooted in 
history; charismatic 
authority stems from 
personality; and legal–
rational authority is 
grounded in a set of 
impersonal rules.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
RISE OF THE POPULISTS: A FLASH IN THE PAN OR A NEW ERA?
In late 2016, Donald Trump defied media and scholarly 
expectations by winning the United States presidency. 
Trumpism, a heady mix of nationalism, isolationism, 
protectionism and conservatism, was a new name for an 
old phenomenon: populism. And it was going global. Just 
months earlier, Rodrigo Duterte, an iron-fisted nationalist, 
had ridden a populist wave to power in the Philippines. 
Populist leaders like Nigel Farage had triumphed in the 
Brexit referendum which saw the United Kingdom leave 
the European Union. In 2014, Narendra Modi swept to 
power in India, fusing populist right-wing politics with 
Hindu nationalism, while in 2019, Jair Bolsonaro brought 
his own brand of Trumpism to Brazil. All around the world, 
in both established and emerging democracies, populism 
was on the rise.
Populism defies easy definition, but it goes to the very 
heart of what politics is. At its simplest, it can be thought of 
as politics of ‘the people’, in contrast to that of the political 
establishment. Populism is less about ideology and more 
about action and sentiment – the feeling that a leader 
or a movement represents the will of ‘the people’ and is 
willing to fight for them against a self-serving political 
and economic elite. Populists may thus emerge anywhere 
on the political spectrum, and their positions may not 
necessarily be ideologically consistent.
Populism appeals to the disenfranchised of a society, and in 
some regards, it is an important check on the power of the 
elite. When a political system becomes too out of touch 
with the public, it is natural that movements will arise to 
restore a popular voice to government. In recent decades, 
scholars have identified rising economic inequality, 
globalization, mass migration, changing social values and 
the transition to an increasingly automated and digital 
economy as issues which have left large groups feeling 
‘left behind’, and thus drawn to populist leaders who have 
sought to reverse these trends or serve their interests.
Populism does offer an important voice to those who feel 
ignored by the media and mainstream political parties. 
Yet populism can also be whipped up by ambitious leaders 
who are simply seeking a quick route to power and wish 
to harness the raw emotion of the public to overwhelm 
traditional political checks and balances. The rise of social 
media in contemporary politics has given populists much 
more powerful tools to do this, allowing counter-narratives 
and ‘alternative facts’ to reach millions quickly, bypassing 
traditional channels of discourse.
Moreover, populists often have autocratic tendencies, 
transgressing the democratic norms they are supposed 
to be upholding for the sake of ‘the people’. And populist 
movements tend to be better at vocalizing problems than 
solving them. Many of the issues which drive popular 
discontent in contemporary politics – wealth disparity, 
transformation of the economy, changing social values, 
demographic transition – are complex issues with no easy 
or quick solutions, if there really are ‘solutions’ to them at all 
(see ‘wicked problems’ on p. 503). Indeed, several prominent 
twenty-first century populists did not last – Trump and 
Bolsonaro lost re-election, and British public opinion has 
come to regret Brexit, with most voters not seeing the 
outcomes they’d been promised. Yet others, like Modi in 
India, or Viktor Orbán in Hungary, have gone on to fuse 
their populist appeal with lasting political power. Scholars 
have been divided on whether populism will become a more 
prominent feature of a more nihilistic, social media driven 
modern politics, or whether it will simply be a passing fad.

STUDYING POLITICS
Approaches to the study of politics
Disagreement about the nature of political activity is matched by controversy 
about the nature of politics as an academic discipline. One of the most ancient 
spheres of intellectual inquiry, politics was originally seen as an arm of philosophy, 
history or law. Its central purpose was to uncover the principles on which human 
society should be based. From the late nineteenth century onwards, however, this 
philosophical emphasis was gradually displaced by an attempt to turn politics 
into a scientific discipline. The high point of this development was reached in the 
1950s and 1960s with an open rejection of the earlier tradition as meaningless 
metaphysics.
Since then, however, enthusiasm for a strict science of politics has waned, and there 
has been a renewed recognition of the enduring importance of political values 
and normative theories. If the ‘traditional’ search for universal values acceptable 
to everyone has largely been abandoned, so has the insistence that science alone 
provides a means of disclosing truth. The resulting discipline is more fertile and 
more exciting, precisely because it embraces a range of theoretical approaches and a 
variety of schools of analysis.
The philosophical tradition
The origins of political analysis date back to Ancient Greece and a tradition usually 
referred to as ‘political philosophy’. This involved a preoccupation with essentially 
ethical or normative questions, reflecting a concern with what ‘should’, ‘ought’ or 
‘must’ be brought about, rather than with what ‘is’. Plato and Aristotle are usually 
identified as the founding fathers of this tradition. Their ideas resurfaced in the 
writings of medieval theorists such as Augustine of Hippo (354–430) and Thomas 
Aquinas (1225–74). The central theme of Plato’s work was an attempt to describe the 
nature of the ideal society, which in his view took the form of a benign dictatorship 
dominated by a class of philosopher kings.
KEY THINKER
PLATO (427–347 bce)
Greek philosopher. Plato was born of an aristocratic family. He became a follower of Socrates, 
who is the principal figure in his ethical and philosophical dialogues. After Socrates’ death in 
399 bce, Plato founded his own academy to train the new Athenian ruling class. Plato taught 
that the material world consists of imperfect copies of abstract and eternal ‘ideas’. His political 
philosophy, expounded in The Republic and The Laws, is an attempt to describe the ideal state 
in terms of a theory of justice. Plato was a sceptic of democracy, and both works are decidedly 
authoritarian and pay no attention to individual liberty. He instead believed that power should

Such writings have formed the basis of what is called the ‘traditional’ approach to 
politics. This involves the analytical study of ideas and doctrines that have been 
central to political thought. Most commonly, it has taken the form of a history of 
political thought that focuses on a collection of ‘major’ thinkers and a canon of 
‘classic’ texts. This approach has the character of literary analysis: it is interested 
primarily in examining what major thinkers said, how they developed or justified 
their views, and the intellectual context within which they worked. Although such 
analysis may be carried out critically and scrupulously, it cannot be objective in any 
scientific sense, as it deals with normative questions such as ‘Why should I obey 
the state?’, ‘How should rewards be distributed?’ and ‘What should the limits of 
individual freedom be?’
The empirical tradition
Although it was less prominent than normative theorizing, a descriptive or empirical 
tradition can be traced back to the earliest days of political thought. It can be seen 
in Aristotle’s attempt to classify constitutions (see pp. 120–121), in Machiavelli’s 
realistic account of statecraft, and in Montesquieu’s (see p. 375) sociological theory 
of government and law. In many ways, such writings constitute the basis of what is 
now called ‘comparative government’, and they gave rise to an essentially institutional 
approach to the discipline. In the USA and the UK in particular, this developed into 
the dominant tradition of analysis. The empirical approach to political analysis 
is characterized by the attempt to offer a dispassionate and impartial account of 
political reality. The empirical approach is ‘descriptive’, in that it seeks to analyse and 
explain, whereas the normative approach is ‘prescriptive’, in the sense that it makes 
judgements and offers recommendations.
Descriptive political analysis acquired its philosophical underpinning from the 
doctrine of empiricism, which spread from the seventeenth century onwards through 
the work of theorists such as John Locke (see p. 32) and David Hume (1711–76). 
The doctrine of empiricism advanced the belief that experience is the only basis 
of knowledge and that, therefore, all hypotheses and theories should be tested by 
a process of observation. By the nineteenth century, such ideas had developed into 
what became known as positivism, an intellectual movement particularly associated 
with the writings of Auguste Comte (1798–1857). This doctrine proclaimed that 
the social sciences, and, for that matter, all forms of philosophical enquiry, should 
adhere strictly to the methods of the natural sciences (Comte 1988). Once science 
was perceived to be the only reliable means of disclosing truth, the pressure to 
develop a science of politics became irresistible.
Behaviouralism
Since the mid-nineteenth century, mainstream political analysis has been dominated 
by the ‘scientific’ tradition, reflecting the growing impact of positivism. In the 1870s, 
‘political science’ courses were introduced in the universities of Oxford, Paris and 
Columbia, and by 1906 the American Political Science Review was being published. 
However, enthusiasm for a science of politics peaked in the 1950s and 1960s with the 
emergence, most strongly in the USA, of a form of political analysis that drew heavily
CONCEPT
Science
Science is the 
systematic study of 
human and natural 
world, to develop 
reliable explanations of 
phenomena through 
repeatable experiments, 
observation and 
deduction. The 
‘scientific method’, 
by which hypotheses 
are proven true by 
testing them against 
the available evidence, 
is seen as a means of 
disclosing value-free 
and objective truth. Karl 
Popper (1902–94), 
however, suggested 
that science can only 
disprove hypotheses, 
it cannot prove things 
to be absolute truths, 
since ‘facts’ may always 
be disproved by later 
experiments and 
discoveries (Popper 
1959). Social science is 
the branch of science 
devoted to the study 
of human society 
and relationships, 
and includes fields 
such as political 
science, sociology and 
economics.
Positivism: A philosophy 
that holds that only 
knowledge that can

scientific, logical or 
mathematical proof, is

on behaviouralism. For the first time, this gave politics reliably scientific credentials, 
because it provided what had previously been lacking: objective and quantifiable data 
against which hypotheses could be tested. Political analysts such as David Easton 
(1917–2014) proclaimed that politics could adopt the methodology of the natural 
sciences, and this gave rise to a proliferation of studies in areas best suited to the use of 
quantitative research methods, such as voting behaviour, the behaviour of legislators 
and the behaviour of municipal politicians and lobbyists. For instance, Seymour 
Martin Lipset’s Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics (1960) was a landmark 
work which demonstrated an empirically verifiable relationship between economic 
development and democracy. Attempts were also made to apply behaviouralism to 
international relations, in the hope of developing objective ‘laws’ of international 
relations. The rise of behaviouralism also gave a major impetus to the systemic study 
of comparative politics.
By the late 1960s however, behaviouralism came under growing pressure. In the 
first place, it was claimed that behaviouralism significantly constrained the scope 
of political analysis, preventing it from going beyond what was directly observable. 
Although behavioural analysis undoubtedly produces invaluable insights in fields 
such as voting studies, pioneered by political scientists like V. O. Key Jr (1908–63), a 
narrow obsession with quantifiable data threatens to reduce the discipline of politics 
to little else. More worryingly, it inclined a generation of political scientists to turn 
their backs on the entire tradition of normative political thought. Concepts such 
as ‘liberty’, ‘equality’ and ‘justice’ were sometimes discarded as being meaningless 
because they were not empirically verifiable entities. Dissatisfaction with 
behaviouralism has grown as interest in normative questions has revived since the 
1970s, as reflected in the writings of theorists such as John Rawls (see p. 35) and 
Robert Nozick (see p. 73).
Rational-choice theory
Amongst the more recent theoretical approaches to politics is what is called ‘rational￾choice theory’, variously known as ‘formal political theory’, ‘public choice theory’ (see 
p. 306) and ‘political economy’ (see p. 169). Pioneered by economists like Kenneth 
Arrow (1921–2017) and Anthony Downs (1930–2021), this approach to political 
analysis draws heavily upon economic theory to build models of political behaviour 
based on procedural rules, usually about the rationally self-interested behaviour of 
the individuals involved. Most firmly established in the USA, rational-choice theory 
provides a useful analytical device which may provide insights into the actions of 
voters, lobbyists, bureaucrats and politicians, as well as into the behaviour of states 
within the international system. The use of such techniques in areas such as party 
competition, interest-group behaviour and the policy influence of bureaucrats is 
discussed in later chapters.
This approach has also been applied in the form of game theory, which uses 
mathematical and logical models to help understand interactions between rational 
actors. A well-known thought experiment in game theory is the ‘prisoners’ dilemma’ 
(see Figure 1.3). For instance, William Riker’s influential Theory of Political 
Coalitions (1962) uses elements of game theory to explain how and why politicians

CONCEPT
Comparative 
politics
Comparative politics 
refers to both a 
disciplinary subfield and 
a method of analysis. As 
a disciplinary subfield, it 
is often taken to mean 
simply ‘the politics of 
foreign countries’. As 
a method of analysis, 
comparative politics 
involves identifying and 
exploring similarities and 
differences between 
political systems to 
develop theories, test 
hypotheses, infer 
causal relationships 
and produce reliable 
generalizations. The 
comparative method is 
sometimes seen as the 
most feasible technique 
for developing 
scientific knowledge of 
politics, in view of the 
practical difficulties of 
applying experimental 
techniques.
Behaviouralism: The 
belief that social theories 
should be constructed 
only on the basis of 
observable behaviour,

data for research.

form coalitions with each other. Game theory has also been used by international 
relations theorists to explain why states find it difficult to prevent, for instance, the 
overfishing of the seas, or the sale of arms to undesirable regimes.
By no means, however, has the rational-choice approach to political analysis been 
universally accepted. While its supporters claim that it introduces greater rigour into 
the discussion of political phenomena, critics have questioned its basic assumptions. 
It may overestimate human rationality – it ignores, for instance, that people seldom 
possess a clear set of preferred goals and rarely make decisions with full and accurate 
knowledge available (see p. 399). Furthermore, in proceeding from an abstract model 
of the individual, rational-choice theory pays insufficient attention to social and 
historical context, failing to recognize, for example, that human self-interestedness 
may be socially conditioned rather than innate. It also ignores the significant role 
that psychological factors, like belief and emotion, can play in the decision-making 
process, particularly in politics (Markwica 2018).
FOCUS ON . . . 
THE PRISONER’S DILEMMA
Two prisoners, held in separate cells, are faced with the choice of ‘squealing’ or ‘not squealing’ 
on one another. If only one of them confesses, but provides evidence to convict the other, he 
will be released without charge, while his partner will take the whole blame and be jailed for ten 
years. If both prisoners confess, they will each be jailed for six years. If both refuse to confess, 
they will only be convicted of a minor crime and they will each receive a one-year sentence. 
Figure 1.3 shows the options available to the prisoners and their consequences in terms of jail 
sentences.
In view of the dilemma confronting them it is likely that both prisoners will confess, fearing that 
if they do not the other will ‘squeal’ and they will receive the maximum sentence. Ironically, the 
game shows that rational behaviour can result in the least favourable outcome (in which the 
prisoners jointly serve a total of twelve years in jail). In effect, they are punished for their failure 
to cooperate or trust one another. However, if the game is repeated several times, it is possible 
that the prisoners will learn that self-interest is advanced by cooperation, which will encourage 
both to refuse to confess.

New institutionalism
From the late nineteenth century, the study of politics had strongly connected with 
the study of institutions – political structures like legislatures, bureaucracies and 
parties which make up a political system. This ‘traditional’ or ‘old’ institutionalism 
focused on the rules, procedures and formal organization of such institutions, and 
employed methods akin to those used in the study of law and history. Growing 
concerns with its largely descriptive methods and the ‘behavioural revolution’ led to 
institutionalism being marginalized during the 1960s.
However, interest in institutions was revived from the 1980s onwards by the 
emergence of what was called ‘new institutionalism’, pioneered by James G. 
March (1928–2018) and Johan Olsen (1939– ), which reasserted the importance 
of institutions in explaining political behaviour (March and Olsen 1989). This 
renewed interest in institutions was applied to political analysis in different ways. 
Sociological institutionalists, for instance, critiqued rational-choice theory and 
argued that institutions are culturally constructed, consisting of traditions, beliefs 
and conventions that are not inherently rational and yet powerfully drive political 
behaviour. In other words, people are strongly motivated to behave in a way that 
is ‘appropriate’ within an institutional context, rather than simply maximizing 
their self-interest. Rational-choice institutionalists, on the other hand, integrated 
institutions into rational-choice analysis by redefining institutions as systems of 
rules and incentives. They argued that rational self-interest was still the primary 
driver of political behaviour, but institutions represented the ‘rules of the game’ that 
constrained and shaped behaviour in certain ways.
Finally, historical institutionalism argued that the power of institutions lay in 
their stability and enduring nature, and that decisions in the past create historical 
institutions that may be hard to alter in the future, constraining future political 
behaviour. For instance, Paul Pierson’s Dismantling the Welfare State? (1994) argues 
that social programmes, once introduced, are very difficult to reform or repeal, 
because powerful constituencies will form that depend on these programmes and 
will impose significant political costs on politicians who try to change them.
New institutionalism remains an important and valuable approach to political 
analysis, but it is not without its critics, particularly as institutional theories struggle 
to handle individual free will and explain how and why things change. If institutions 
are so powerful in determining political behaviour, then politics should run like 
clockwork. Yet, as we know, is it far more chaotic and unpredictable. Even the most 
enduring institutions can find themselves suddenly sidelined by social revolutions, 
populist mavericks and unexpected change.
Critical approaches
Until the 1980s, Marxism was considered the principal alternative to mainstream 
political science. Indeed, Karl Marx can be seen as the first theorist to have attempted 
to describe politics in scientific terms. Using his so-called ‘materialist conception of 
history’ (see p. 43), Marx strove to uncover the driving force of historical development. 
This enabled him to make predictions about the future based on ‘laws’ that had 
the same status in terms of proof as laws in the natural sciences. Since the 1980s, 
Institution: A well￾established body with a 
formal role and status in 
a system. More broadly, 
a set of rules and norms 
that ensure regular and 
predictable behaviour 
within a system.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_1.indd 17 23-07-2024 12:44:1618 POLITICS
however, ‘critical’ approaches to political science, which seek to reveal, analyse and 
confront the power structures of society, have deepened and diversified significantly. 
Such approaches include feminism (see pp. 50–52), critical theory, green ideology 
(see pp. 53–54), constructivism, post-structuralism and postcolonialism (see p. 203).
Critical approaches exemplify two broad, and sometimes linked, characteristics. The 
first is that they are ‘critical’ in that, in their different ways, they seek to contest the 
political status quo, usually by aligning themselves with the interests of marginalized 
or oppressed groups. Each of them thus seeks to uncover inequalities and 
asymmetries that mainstream approaches tend to ignore. Feminism, for example, 
has drawn attention to systematic and pervasive structures of gender inequality 
that characterize politics in all its forms and at every level. Critical theory, which 
is rooted in the neo-Marxism (see p. 69) of the Frankfurt School, has extended the 
notion of critique to all social practices, drawing on a wide range of influences. Green 
ideology, or ecologism (see p. 53), has challenged the human-centred emphasis 
of established political and social theory, and championed holistic approaches to 
political understanding. Postcolonialism emphasizes the cultural dimension of 
colonial rule, showing how Western cultural and political hegemony (see p. 218)
over the rest of the world has been preserved despite the achievement of formal 
political independence across almost the entire developing world.
The second characteristic of critical approaches to politics is that, albeit in different 
ways and to different degrees, they have tried to go beyond the positivism of 
mainstream political science, emphasizing instead the role of consciousness in 
shaping social conduct and, therefore, the political world. These so-called post￾positivist approaches (sometimes called ‘interpretivism’ or ‘anti-foundationalism’) 
are therefore ‘critical’ in that they not only take issue with the conclusions 
of mainstream approaches, but also subject these approaches themselves to 
critical scrutiny, exposing biases that operate within them and examining their 
implications. This can be seen in relation to constructivism and post-structuralism. 
Constructivism has had a significantly greater impact on international relations 
than it has had on political science, with many now treating constructivism as a 
mainstream international relations theory. However, constructivism is not so 
much a substantive theory as an analytical tool. In arguing that people, in effect, 
‘construct’ the world in which they live, suggesting that the world operates through 
a kind of ‘inter-subjective’ awareness, constructivists have thrown mainstream 
political analysis’s claim to objectivity into question. For example, as subjective 
entities, political actors have no fixed or objective interests or identities; rather, 
these are fashioned (and can be re-fashioned) through the traditions, values and 
sentiments that prevail at any time.
Post-structuralism meanwhile emphasizes that all ideas and concepts are expressed 
in language which itself is enmeshed in complex relations of power. Influenced 
particularly by the writings of the French philosopher Michel Foucault (1926–84), 
poststructuralists have drawn attention to the link between power and systems of 
thought using the idea of discourse, or ‘discourses of power’. In crude terms, this 
implies that knowledge is power. However, in the absence of a universal frame 
of reference or overarching perspective, there exists only a series of competing 
perspectives, each of which represents a particular discourse of power.
Post-positivism: An 
approach to knowledge 
that questions the idea 
of an ‘objective’ reality, 
emphasizing instead the 
extent to which people 
conceive, or ‘construct’, 
the world around them.
Discourse: In 
sociology, a system of 
thought, knowledge or 
communication that 
shapes how the world is 
perceived or how certain 
ideas are understood.
CONCEPT
Constructivism
Constructivism is an 
approach to analysis that 
is based on the belief 
that there is no objective 
social or political reality 
independent of our 
understanding of it. 
To quote Friedrich 
Nietzsche, ‘facts 
do not exist, only 
interpretations’. 
Constructivism 
questions whether 
we can actually 
study something like 
politics objectively 
and scientifically, and 
whether experiments, 
data or models of 
social behaviour 
reflect anything more 
than our own biased 
interpretations of a 
constructed social 
reality.

DEBATING . . .
SHOULD STUDENTS OF POLITICS SEEK TO BE POLITICALLY NEUTRAL?
Many believe that a strict distinction should be drawn between studying politics and practising politics, between having 
an academic interest in the subject and being politically engaged or committed. But does this distinction stand up to 
examination? Should we (teachers as well as students) approach the study of politics in a neutral manner, adopting a stance 
of ‘scientific’ objectivity? Or should we accept that, in politics, interest and commitment are inevitably linked, and even that 
political conviction may drive political understanding?
YES NO
Desire to explain. The motives for studying politics 
and practising politics are – or should be – different. 
Students of politics should seek, above all, to understand 
and explain the (all too often complex and baffling) 
political world. As they want to make sense of things, 
any personal preferences they may hold must be 
treated as of strictly secondary importance. In contrast, 
practitioners of politics (politicians, activists and the like) 
are principally concerned with reshaping the political 
world in line with their own convictions or preferences. 
Political convictions thus blind people to ‘inconvenient’ 
truths, allowing political analysis to service the needs of 
political advocacy.
Objective knowledge. There is an approach to the 
acquisition of knowledge that has unrivalled authority 
in the form of scientific method, and this should be 
applied to all areas of learning, politics included. Using 
observation, measurement and experimentation, 
scientific method allows hypotheses to be verified or 
falsified by comparing them with what we know about the 
real world. Systematic enquiry, guided by such scientific 
principles, is the only reliable means of producing and 
accumulating knowledge. This knowledge is objective 
because it is generated through a value-free approach 
that is concerned with empirical questions and does not 
seek to make normative judgements.
Free-floating intellectuals. Education and intellectual 
enquiry are themselves a training ground in dispassionate 
scholarship, allowing students and teachers to distance 
themselves, over time, from the allegiances and biases 
that derive from social and family backgrounds. The 
German sociologist Karl Mannheim (1893–1947) thus 
argued that objectivity is strictly the preserve of the 
‘socially unattached intelligentsia’, a class of intellectuals 
who alone can engage in disciplined and dispassionate 
enquiry. As free-floating intellectuals, they can stand 
back from the world they seek to understand, and 
thereby see it more clearly.
Myth of neutrality. Whereas natural scientists may be able 
to approach their studies from an objective and impartial 
standpoint, this is impossible in politics. However politics 
is defined, it addresses questions about the structure and 
functioning of the society in which we live and have grown 
up. Family background, social experience, economic 
position, political sympathies and so on instil in all of us 
preconceptions about the political world we are seeking 
to study. Indeed, perhaps the greatest threat to reliable 
knowledge comes not from bias as such, but from the failure 
to acknowledge bias, reflected in bogus claims to political 
neutrality.
Emancipatory knowledge. Very few people are drawn to the 
study of politics through a disinterested quest for knowledge 
alone. Instead, they seek knowledge for a purpose, and that 
purpose invariably has a normative component. As Marx 
famously put it, ‘The philosophers have only interpreted 
the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.’ 
Such an approach is most clearly embraced by modern 
critical theorists, who adopt an explicit commitment to 
emancipatory politics. The purpose of critical theory is to 
uncover structures of oppression and injustice in domestic 
and global politics in order to advance the cause of individual 
and collective freedom.
Competing realities. Post-positivist theorists question the 
very idea of scientific objectivity, arguing that there is more 
than one way in which the world can be understood. There 
is thus no single, overarching truth about the ‘real world’ out 
there, separate from the beliefs, ideas and assumptions of 
the observer. If the subject (the student of politics) cannot 
in any reliable way be distinguished from the object (the 
political world), then dispassionate scholarship must be 
treated as, at best, an unachievable ideal, social and political 
analysis being an inevitably value-laden activity.

Concepts, models and theories
Concepts, models and theories are the tools of political analysis. However, as with 
most things in politics, the analytical tools must be used with care. First, let us 
consider concepts. A concept is a general idea about something, usually expressed in a 
single word or a short phrase. A concept is more than a proper noun or the name of a 
thing. There is, for example, a difference between talking about a cat (a particular and 
unique cat) and having a concept of a ‘cat’ (the idea of a cat). The concept of a cat is 
not a ‘thing’ but an ‘idea’, an idea composed of the various attributes that give a cat its 
distinctive character: ‘a furry mammal’, ‘small’, ‘domesticated’, ‘catches rats and mice’ 
and so on. In the same way, the concept of the ‘presidency’ refers not to any specific 
president but, rather, to a set of ideas about the organization of executive power.
What, then, is the value of concepts? Concepts are the tools with which we think, 
criticize, argue, explain and analyse. Merely perceiving the external world does not 
in itself give us knowledge about it. In order to make sense of the world, we must, in 
a sense, impose meaning on it, and this we do through the construction of concepts. 
Concepts, in that sense, are the building blocks of human knowledge. Nevertheless, 
concepts can also be slippery customers. In the first place, the political reality we 
seek to understand is constantly shifting and is highly complex. There is always the 
danger that concepts such as ‘democracy’, ‘human rights’ and ‘capitalism’ will be 
more rounded and coherent than the realities they seek to describe.
Max Weber (see p. 87) tried to overcome this problem by recognizing particular 
concepts as ‘ideal types’. This view implies that the concepts we use are constructed 
by singling out certain central features of the phenomenon in question, which means 
that other features are downgraded or ignored altogether. The concept of ‘revolution’ 
can be regarded as an ideal type in this sense, in that it draws attention to a process 
of fundamental, and usually violent, political change. It thus helps us make sense of, 
say, the 1789 French Revolution and the Eastern European revolutions of 1989–91 by 
highlighting important parallels between them. The concept must nevertheless be used 
with care because it can also conceal vital differences, and thereby distort understanding 
– in this case, for example, about the ideological and social character of revolution.
A further problem is that political concepts are often the subject of deep ideological 
controversy. Politics is, in part, a struggle over the legitimate meaning of terms. The 
problem is that words such as ‘freedom’, ‘democracy’ and ‘justice’ have different 
meanings to different people. In political debates, elections or even wars, is not 
unusual for opposing camps to both claim to be ‘defending freedom’ or ‘upholding 
democracy’. So how can we establish what is ‘true’ democracy, ‘true’ freedom or ‘true’ 
justice? The simple answer is that we cannot. Just as with the attempt to define politics, 
we must accept that there are competing versions of many political concepts. These 
are what W. B. Gallie described as essentially contested concepts, in which a single 
concept can encompass many different and potentially opposing interpretations, 
none of which is more correct than the other (Gallie 1955). Isaiah Berlin, in his 
famous essay Two Concepts of Liberty (1969), argued that liberty can be understood 
both as living free from interference from other people, and as being given the power 
and resources so that you are able to live freely. These two interpretations are equally 
valid, yet conflict with each other (see p. 206).
Essentially contested 
concept: A concept 
about which 
disagreement is so deep 
that no settled or neutral 
definition can ever be 
developed.

Models and theories are broader than concepts; they comprise a range of ideas 
rather than a single idea. A model is usually thought of as a representation 
of something, usually on a smaller scale, as in the case of a doll’s house or a toy 
aeroplane. In this sense, the purpose of the model is to resemble the original object 
as faithfully as possible. However, conceptual models need not in any way resemble 
an object. Rather they are analytical tools; their value is that they are devices through 
which meaning can be imposed on what would otherwise be a bewildering and 
disorganized collection of facts. Facts do not speak for themselves: they must be 
interpreted, and they must be organized. Models assist in the accomplishment of this 
task because they include a network of relationships that highlight the meaning and 
significance of relevant empirical data. Moreover, models provide simplifications of 
large, complex systems or processes that can help us understand how they work and 
to compare them with other systems.

interactions.

One example of an influential model in political analysis is the conceptual model 
of a political system developed by David Easton (see Figure 1.4). This ambitious 
model sets out to explain the entire political process, as well as the function of major 
political actors, through the application of what is called systems analysis. A system 
is an organized or complex whole, a set of interrelated and interdependent parts that 
form a collective entity. In the case of the political system, a linkage exists between 
what Easton calls ‘inputs’ and ‘outputs’. Inputs into the political system consist of 
demands and supports from the general public. Demands can range from pressure 
for higher living standards, improved employment prospects and more generous 
welfare payments to greater protection for minority and individual rights. Supports, 
on the other hand, are ways in which the public contributes to the political system 
by paying taxes, offering compliance and being willing to participate in public life. 
Outputs consist of the decisions and actions of government, including the making 
of policy, the passing of laws, the imposition of taxes and the allocation of public 
funds. These outputs generate ‘feedback’ which, in turn, shapes further demands 
and supports. The key insight offered by Easton’s model is that the political system 
tends towards long-term equilibrium or political stability, as its survival depends 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_1.indd 21 23-07-2024 12:44:1622 POLITICS
on outputs being brought into line with inputs (Easton 1957). Easton’s approach 
to modelling the political process here is highly simplified, and there are many 
other ways it could be modelled that may look nothing like this model yet still be 
equally useful. The purpose of a model, however, is not to exhaustively explain or 
reproduce something, but to provide a tool that helps further our understanding 
or ability to analyse it.
The terms ‘theory’ and ‘model’ are often used interchangeably in politics. Theories 
and models are both conceptual constructs used as tools of political analysis. 
However, strictly speaking, a theory is a proposition. It offers a systematic explanation 
of a body of empirical data. In contrast, a model is merely an explanatory device. 
In that sense, while theories can be said to be more or less ‘true’, models can only 
be said to be more or less ‘useful’. Clearly, however, theories and models are often 
interlinked: broad political theories may be explained in terms of a series of models. 
For example, the theory of pluralism (discussed in Chapters 3 and 4) encompasses 
a model of the state, a model of electoral competition, a model of group politics 
and so on.
Virtually all conceptual devices, theories and models contain hidden values or 
implicit assumptions. This is why it is difficult to construct theories that are 
purely empirical: values and normative beliefs invariably intrude. In the case 
of concepts, this is demonstrated by the tendency of words to have positive 
associations (for example, ‘democracy’, ‘freedom’ and ‘justice’) or negative 
associations (for example, ‘conflict’, ‘anarchy’ and even ‘politics’). Models and 
theories also necessarily make assumptions that are not value-neutral. Rational￾choice theory for instance assumes that human beings are basically egoistic and 
self-regarding, a view of human nature that some regard as inherently cynical and 
politically conservative.
Moreover, many analytical devices, such as models and microtheories, are constructed 
on the basis of broader macrotheories, which in turn reflect the assumptions and 
beliefs of major ideological traditions (see Figure 1.5). These traditions operate in 
a similar way to the ‘paradigms’ to which Thomas Kuhn refers in The Structure of 
Scientific Revolutions (1962). A paradigm constitutes the framework within which

CONCEPT
Paradigm
A paradigm is the broad 
framework of values 
and ideas within which 
we operate. Articulated 
most influentially 
by Thomas Kuhn
(1962), it is a pattern 
of basic assumptions 
used to structure the 
search for knowledge. 
Most science is the 
‘normal’ kind, in which 
research and discovery 
is made within the 
boundaries of the 
established paradigm. 
But occasionally 
‘revolutionary’ science 
might upend the 
entire paradigm itself, 
changing the very rules 
by which we understand 
things. For instance, 
physics research for 
centuries was conducted 
according to the basic 
rules of the universe set 
out by Isaac Newton. 
But Albert Einstein’s 
theory of relativity 
completely upended 
Newton’s rules, and 
forever changed the way 
we understand how the 
universe, and thus all 
physics, works.

the search for knowledge is conducted. According to Kuhn, the natural sciences are 
dominated at any time by a single paradigm; science develops through a series of 
‘revolutions’ in which an old paradigm is replaced by a new one (see p. 22). Political 
and social enquiry is, however, different, in that it is a battleground of contending and 
competing paradigms. These paradigms take the form of broad social philosophies, 
usually called ‘political ideologies’ – liberalism, conservatism, socialism, fascism, 
feminism and so on (see Chapter 2).
POLITICS IN A GLOBAL AGE
Beyond the domestic/international divide?
As an academic discipline, politics has conventionally focused on the state and 
particularly on its institutional framework: where power lies within it, how decisions 
are made and so on. This state-based paradigm is one in which politics has a distinct 
spatial or territorial character. In short, borders and boundaries matter. This 
especially applies in the case of the distinction between domestic politics, which 
is concerned with the state’s role in maintaining order and carrying out regulation 
within its own borders, and international politics, which is concerned with relations 
between or among states. In that sense, sovereignty (see p. 64), the supreme or 
unquestionable authority of the state, is a ‘hard shell’ that divides domestic politics 
from international politics.
This domestic/international divide also separates what have conventionally been 
seen as two quite different spheres of political interaction (see Figure 1.6). Whereas 
domestic politics has an orderly or regulated character, stemming from the ability of 
The New York Stock exchange in 2008. The financial crash illustrated how, in our 
globalized world, events in one country can have repercussions across the globe.

the state within the domestic sphere to impose rule from above, international politics 
has an anarchic character, derived from the fact that there is no authority in the 
international sphere higher than the sovereign state. The spatial division that the 
state-based paradigm has inculcated is, furthermore, reflected in a traditional sub￾disciplinary division of labour between ‘political science’ and ‘international relations’. 
While political science has tended to view states as macro-level actors within the 
political world, international relations has typically treated states as micro-level 
actors within the larger international arena.
The state-based paradigm of politics has nevertheless come under pressure because 
of recent trends and developments, not least those associated with globalization 
(see  pp. 181–182). In particular, there has been a substantial growth in cross￾border, or transnational, flows and transactions – movements of people, goods, 
money, information and ideas. As state borders have become increasingly porous, 
the conventional domestic/international divide has become more difficult to sustain. 
This can be illustrated both by the substantially greater vulnerability of domestic 
economies to events that take place elsewhere in the world, as demonstrated by the 
wide-ranging impact of the 2007–9 global financial crisis, and by the wider use of 
digital technologies that enable people to communicate with each other, such as 
mobile phones and the internet, that national governments find very difficult to 
control. And what were once purely domestic political areas are now increasingly 
interconnected with global considerations. Health care was once considered firmly 
in the domain of national politics, but, as global pandemics like AIDS and Covid-19 
have demonstrated, international cooperation is increasingly essential to the effective 
protection of public health. The increase in the scale, scope and, sometimes, nature of 
spatial interdependence has encouraged some to speculate that the disciplinary divide 
between political science and international relations should be dissolved (Hay 2010).

If political activity can no longer be seen to take place within discrete domestic and 
international spheres, politics is perhaps best understood in terms of interrelationships 
between and amongst a number of overlapping spheres – the global, the regional, the 
national and the local (see Figure 1.6). This approach is not entirely novel, though. 
Liberal international relations theorists, for instance, have long argued that the 
constitutional structure of the state influences its external behaviour, while political 
scientists studying the causes of revolution have always accepted that war and foreign 
invasion may sometimes be decisive factors in their outbreak.
Where does this leave us as far as political analysis is concerned? One of the 
implications of accepting that politics takes place not only in global, regional, national 
and local spheres, but also through relationships between these various spheres, is 
that it so expands the parameters and complexity of politics that it becomes difficult, 
and maybe impossible, to make sense of it as a whole. This would require that we study 
topics such as elections, political parties, constitutions and other aspects of national 
government alongside topics such as war and peace, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, 
economic development and so forth. And, indeed, we see these complexities bear 
out in conflicts like that which broke out between Hamas and Israel in October 2023, 
a conflict between a state actor and a semi-sovereign local government that cannot 
be understood without studying both its micro-domestic and macro-international 
dimensions. Yet while the domestic/international divide has undoubtedly been 
compromised by globalizing trends and the complexities of modern conflict, it is 
difficult to argue that it has been rendered meaningless. States continue to be the 
most significant actors in both the domestic and the international spheres, and while 
sovereignty may no longer be a ‘hard shell’ that separates domestic and international 
politics, it is a still a ‘soft shell’.
Although this book adopts a holistic approach, which accepts that what goes on 
within states and what goes on between states impact each other to a greater degree 
than ever before, it considers the interactions of politics from a primarily domestic 
perspective. In contrast, its companion volume, Global Politics, examines the 
interactions of politics from a primarily international or global perspective, and so 
gives particular attention to ideas, issues and theories that have conventionally been 
studied within the field of international relations.
Nevertheless, now perhaps more than ever, politics is a global subject, and any 
serious student of it should be mindful that no state is an island. From the murder 
of George Floyd in Minneapolis to a Taiwanese ship running aground in the Suez 
Canal, local events can have enormous ramifications for global politics.

FOCUS ON . . . 
POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: 
TWO DISCIPLINES OR ONE?
Are political science and international relations two separate disciplines, or should they be 
thought of as subfields within the same broad discipline of politics? In most contexts, political 
science and international relations emerged independently from one another. Political science 
was established as an academic discipline from the mid-nineteenth century onwards in the 
USA and across Europe, while international relations developed in the aftermath of the First 
World War and was largely shaped by the desire to uncover the conditions for enduring peace.
Politics and international relations constitute separate fields of knowledge, in the sense that 
the former addresses ‘domestic’ issues and developments (concerned with what goes on within 
the state), while the latter addresses ‘international’ issues and developments (concerned with 
what occurs between states). The two fields have therefore developed their own analytical 
tools and theoretical perspectives, helping each to enjoy the same degree of disciplinary 
authenticity as, say, economics or sociology.
However, the disciplinary divide between them may always have been arbitrary. In this view, 
politics and international relations can be seen not as discrete but as overlapping disciplines: 
they ask very similar questions, albeit about different (if always related) levels of political 
interaction. Both fields are primarily concerned with questions about power (its distribution, 
exercise, consequences and so forth), and both place a strong emphasis on the nature, role 
and activities of the state, even if political science views the state as a macro-level actor, while 
international relations views it as a micro-level actor.
Questions about the balance between conflict and cooperation in social relations are also 
central to both disciplines. The idea of a disciplinary divide has become particularly problematic 
due to the advent of an increasingly interdependent world, in which ‘the domestic’ and ‘the 
international’ influence one another to a greater degree than ever before. Globalization, climate 
change, multilevel governance, security and crime are only some of the issues that confound 
the traditional domestic/international divide, and perhaps suggest that rigid disciplinary or sub￾disciplinary fault-lines should be dispensed with (Hay 2002).

PREVIEW
All people are political thinkers. Whether they know it or not, people use political ideas and concepts whenever they 
express their opinions or speak their mind. Everyday language is littered with terms such as ‘freedom’, ‘equality’ 
and ‘justice’. In the same way, words such as ‘conservative’, ‘liberal’, ‘socialist’ or ‘feminist’ are regularly employed 
by people either to describe their own views, or those of others. However, even though such terms are familiar, 
even commonplace, they are seldom used with any precision. What, for instance, is ‘equality’? What does it mean 
to say that all people are equal? Are people born equal, should they be treated by society as if they are equal? 
Should people have equal rights, equal opportunities, equal political influence, equal wages? Similarly, words such 
as communist or fascist are commonly misused. What does it mean to call someone a ‘fascist’? What values or 
beliefs do fascists hold, and why do they hold them? How do communist views differ from those of, say, liberals, 
conservatives or socialists?
This chapter examines political ideas and the major ideological traditions. It focuses in particular on the ‘classical’ 
ideologies (liberalism, conservatism and socialism), but it also considers a range of other ideological traditions, 
which have arisen either out of, or in opposition to, the classical ones. Each ideological tradition constitutes a 
distinctive intellectual framework or paradigm, and so offers a particular lens on the political world. However, 
before examining the various ideological traditions, it is necessary to consider the nature of political ideology itself.

WHAT IS POLITICAL IDEOLOGY?
Ideology is one of the most controversial concepts encountered in political analysis. 
Although the term now tends to be used in a neutral sense to refer to a developed 
social philosophy or worldview, in the past the term has carried negative or pejorative 
connotations. During its long career, the concept of ideology has often been used as 
a political weapon to discredit the politics of others and condemn rival doctrines.
The term ‘ideology’ was coined in 1796 by the French philosopher Antoine Destutt 
de Tracy (1754–1836). He used it to refer to a new ‘science of ideas’ (literally, an idea￾ology) that set out to uncover the origins of conscious thought and ideas. Tracy’s hope 
was that ideology would eventually enjoy the same status as established sciences such 
as zoology and biology. However, a more enduring meaning was assigned to the term 
in the nineteenth century in the writings of Karl Marx (see p. 43). For Marx and 
Engels, ideology amounted to the ideas of the ruling class, ideas that therefore uphold 
the class system and perpetuate exploitation (1846). The defining feature of ideology 
in the Marxist sense is that it is false: it mystifies and confuses subordinate classes by 
concealing from them the contradictions on which all class societies are based. As far 
as capitalism is concerned, the ideology of the property-owning class fosters delusion 
or ‘false consciousness’ amongst the exploited working classes, preventing them from 
recognizing the fact of their own exploitation. That said, Marx did not believe that 
all political views had an ideological character. He held that his own work, which 
attempted to uncover the process of class exploitation and oppression, was scientific. 
In his view, a clear distinction could be drawn between science and ideology, between 
truth and falsehood. This distinction tended, however, to get blurred in the writings of 
later Marxists such as Vladimir Lenin (see p. 107) and Antonio Gramsci (see p. 219).
Alternative uses of the term ideology have also been developed by liberals and 
conservatives. The emergence of totalitarian dictatorships in the interwar period 
encouraged writers such as Karl Popper (1902–94), J. L. Talmon (1916–80) and 
Hannah Arendt (see p. 8) to view ideology as an instrument of social control to 
ensure compliance and subordination. Relying heavily on the examples of fascism 
and communism, this liberal use of the term treated ideology as a ‘closed’ system of 
thought, which, by claiming a monopoly of truth, refuses to tolerate opposing ideas 
and rival beliefs. In contrast, liberalism, based as it is on a fundamental commitment 
to individual freedom, and doctrines such as conservatism and democratic socialism 
that broadly subscribe to liberal principles, are by this definition not ideologies. 
These doctrines are ‘open’ in the sense that they permit, and even insist on, free 
debate, opposition and criticism.
A distinctively conservative use of the term ideology has been developed by thinkers 
such as Michael Oakeshott (see p. 220). This view reflects a characteristically 
conservative scepticism about the value of rationalism, born out of the belief that the 
world is largely beyond the capacity of the human mind to fathom. As Oakeshott put 
it, in ‘political activity, then, men sail a boundless and bottomless sea’ (1962). From 
this perspective, ideologies are seen as abstract sets of ideas that distort political 
reality because they claim to explain what is, frankly, incomprehensible. This is 
why conservatives have traditionally dismissed the notion that they subscribe to an 
ideology, preferring instead to describe conservatism as a disposition or attitude, 
and placing their faith in pragmatism, tradition (see p. 87) and history.
CONCEPT
Ideology
From a social-scientific 
viewpoint, an ideology is 
a coherent set of ideas 
that provides a basis 
for organized political 
action, whether this is 
intended to preserve, 
modify or overthrow 
the existing system of 
power relationships. 
All ideologies therefore 
(1) offer an account 
of the existing order, 
usually in the form of a 
‘worldview’, (2) provide 
a model of a desired 
future, a vision of an 
ideal society, and (3) 
outline how political 
change can and should 
be brought about. 
Ideologies are not, 
however, sealed systems 
of thought; rather, they 
are fluid sets of ideas 
that may overlap and 
even contradict one 
another.
Rationalism: The belief 
that the world can be 
understood and explained 
through the exercise of 
human reason, based on 
assumptions about its 
rational structure.
Pragmatism: A theory 
or practice that places 
primary emphasis on 
practical circumstances 
and goals. Pragmatism 
implies a distrust of 
abstract ideas.

DEBATING . . .
CAN POLITICS EXIST WITHOUT IDEOLOGY?
The term ‘ideology’ has traditionally carried pejorative implications, often expressed through predictions of its imminent 
(and usually welcome) demise. Nevertheless, despite its varied obituaries, political ideology has stubbornly refused to die. 
While particular ideologies may rise or fall, ideological forms of politics seem to be an enduring feature of world history. Is 
politics intrinsically linked to ideology? Or may politics finally be able to emerge from the shadow cast by ideological belief?
YES NO
Overcoming falsehood and delusion. Most critiques of 
ideology associate it with falsehood and manipulation, 
implying that reason and critical understanding can, 
and will, emancipate us from ideological politics. In this 
view, ideologies are, in effect, political religions, sets of 
values, theories and doctrines that demand faith and 
commitment from ‘believers’, who are then unable to think 
outside or beyond their chosen worldview. If ideologies are 
intellectual prisons, the solution is to see the world ‘as it is’, 
something that can be achieved through the application 
of value-free scientific method. The purpose of political 
science is thus to disengage politics from ideology.
Rise of technocratic politics. Political ideology arose 
in the form of contrasting attempts to shape emergent 
industrial society. The left/right divide (see p. 274) and the 
struggle between socialism and capitalism has always been 
at the heart of ideological debate. However, the collapse 
of communism and the near worldwide acceptance of 
market capitalism means that this rivalry has become 
irrelevant to modern politics. Politics has therefore come 
to revolve not around ideological questions to do with 
ownership and the distribution of wealth, but around 
‘smaller’ questions to do with the effective management 
of the capitalist system. Ideological politics has given way 
to technocratic politics.
Rise of consumerist politics. Ideology has little place in 
modern democratic systems due to the logic of electoral 
competition. Elections force political parties to behave 
like businesses in the marketplace, formulating ‘products’ 
(policies) in the hope of attracting the largest number of 
‘consumers’ (voters). Parties thus increasingly respond to 
consumer/voter demands, rather than trying to reshape 
these demands in the light of a pre-existing ideological 
vision. Whether parties have historically been left-wing, 
right-wing or centrist in orientation, they recognize the 
electoral value of ‘travelling light’ in ideological terms. 
Ideology as an intellectual framework. Political ideology will 
always survive because it provides politicians, parties and 
other political actors with an intellectual framework which 
helps them to make sense of the world in which they live. 
Ideologies are not systematic delusions but, rather, rival 
visions of the political world, each illuminating particular 
aspects of a complex and multifaceted reality. Ideologies are 
therefore neither inherently true nor false. Perhaps the most 
dangerous delusion is the notion of a clear distinction between 
science and ideology. Many of areas of policy-making – like 
civil rights, welfare, education and the environment – are 
areas where decisions will come down to a society’s values 
and beliefs, as much as technical considerations.
Ideological renewal. The secret of ideology’s survival and 
continued relevance is its flexibility, the fact that ideological 
traditions go through a seemingly endless process of 
redefinition and renewal. As old ideologies fade, new ones 
emerge, helping to preserve the relevance of political 
ideology. The world of ideologies does not stand still, but 
changes in response to changing social and historical 
circumstances. The declining relevance of the left/right 
divide has not led to the ‘end of ideology’ or the ‘end of 
history’; it has merely opened up new ideological spaces 
that have been filled by the likes of feminism, ecologism and 
multiculturalism.
The ‘vision thing’. As the principal source of meaning and 
idealism in politics, ideology touches those aspects of politics 
that no other political form can reach. Ideology gives people 
a reason to believe in something larger than themselves, 
because people’s personal narratives only make sense when 
they are situated within a broader historical narrative. A post￾ideological age would therefore be an age without hope, 
without vision. If politicians cannot cloak their pursuit of 
power in ideological purpose, they risk being seen simply as 
power-seeking pragmatists, and their policy programmes will 
appear to lack coherence and direction.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 30 23-07-2024 12:43:06Political Ideas and Ideologies 31
The drawback of each of these usages, however, is that, as they are negative or 
pejorative, they restrict the application of the term. Moreover, they tend to be 
self-serving. Marx, for instance, insisted that his ideas were scientific, while 
the programmes of others were ideological. Similarly, liberals have denied that 
liberalism should be viewed as an ideology, and conservatives have often claimed to 
embrace a pragmatic rather than ideological style of politics. An inclusive definition 
of ideology, one that applies to all political traditions, must therefore be neutral. It 
must reject the notion that ideologies are good or bad, true or false, liberating or 
oppressive. This is the virtue of the modern, social-scientific meaning of the term, 
which treats ideology as an action-orientated belief system, an interrelated set of 
ideas that in some way guides or inspires political action.
However, much of the debate about ideology since the mid-twentieth century 
has focused on predictions of its demise, or at least of its fading relevance. This 
came to be known as the ‘end of ideology’ debate. It was initiated in the 1950s, 
stimulated by the collapse of fascism at the end of the Second World War and the 
decline of communism in the developed West. In The End of Ideology (1960), the 
American sociologist Daniel Bell (1919–2011) declared that the stock of political 
ideas had been exhausted. In his view, ethical and ideological questions had 
become irrelevant because in most Western societies parties competed for power 
simply by promising higher levels of economic growth and material affluence. 
This debate was revived in the aftermath of the collapse of communism by ‘end 
of history’ theorists, such as Francis Fukuyama (see p. 124), who suggested that a 
single ideology, liberal democracy (see p. 108), had triumphed over all its rivals, 
and that this triumph was final. At the heart of such debates lie questions about the 
relationship between politics and ideology, and specifically about whether politics 
can exist without ideology.
CLASSICAL IDEOLOGICAL TRADITIONS
Political ideology arose out of the transition from feudalism to industrial capitalism. 
In simple terms, the earliest, or ‘classical’, ideologies – liberalism, conservatism and 
socialism – developed as contrasting attempts to shape emerging industrial society. 
This meant that the central theme in ideological debate during this period was the 
battle between two rival economic philosophies: capitalism and socialism. Political 
ideology thus had a strong economic focus. The battle lines between capitalism 
and socialism were significantly sharpened by the 1917 Russian Revolution, which 
created the world’s first socialist state. Indeed, from the outbreak of the First World 
War to the fall of Soviet Union in 1991, and particularly during the Cold War period, 
international politics was structured along ideological lines, as the capitalist West 
confronted the communist East. Although ideological debate has become richer 
and progressively more diverse since the 1960s, not least because of the rise of so￾called ‘new’ ideologies such as feminism and green ideology, the classical ideologies 
have retained their central importance. In large part, this has been because of their 
capacity to reinvent themselves. In the process of doing so, the dividing lines between 
them have often been blurred.

KEY THINKER
JOHN LOCKE (1632–1704)
English philosopher and politician. Locke studied medicine at Oxford University before becoming 
secretary to Anthony Ashley Cooper, an influential politician during the English Civil War and 
the Stuart Restoration. Locke’s political views were developed amidst these turbulent times, and 
are often seen as providing a justification for the ‘Glorious Revolution’ of 1688, which ended 
absolutist rule and established a constitutional monarchy in Britain. Locke was a key philosopher 
of early liberalism, placing particular emphasis on ‘natural’ or God-given rights, identified as the 
rights to life, liberty and property. An exponent of representative government and toleration, 
Locke’s views had a considerable impact on the American Revolution. His most important 
political works are A Letter Concerning Toleration (1689) and Two Treatises of Government (1690).

Liberalism
Any account of political ideologies must start with liberalism. This is because 
liberalism is the predominant ideology of the industrialized West, and is sometimes 
portrayed as a meta-ideology that embraces a broad range of rival values and beliefs. 
Although liberalism did not emerge as a developed political creed until the early 
nineteenth century, distinctively liberal theories and principles had been developing 
over the previous 300 years. Early liberalism certainly reflected the aspirations of a 
rising industrial middle class, and liberalism and capitalism have been closely linked 
(some have argued intrinsically linked) ever since.
In its earliest form, liberalism was a political doctrine. As reflected in the ideas of 
thinkers such as John Locke, it attacked absolutism (see p. 122) and feudal privilege, 
instead advocating constitutional and, later, representative government. By the 
early nineteenth century, a distinctively liberal economic creed had developed 
that extolled the virtues of laissez-faire (see p. 170) and condemned all forms of 
government intervention. This became the centrepiece of classical liberalism. From 
the late nineteenth century onwards, however, a form of social liberalism emerged 
that looked more favourably on welfare reform and economic intervention. Such an 
emphasis became the characteristic theme of modern liberalism.
Classical liberalism
The central theme of classical liberalism is a commitment to individualism. Human 
beings are seen as egoistical, self-seeking and largely self-reliant creatures. In what 
C. B. Macpherson (1962) termed ‘possessive individualism’, they are taken to be the 
proprietors of their own persons and capacities, owing nothing to society or to other 
individuals. This atomist view of society is underpinned by a belief in ‘negative’ 
liberty, meaning non-interference, or the absence of external constraints on the 
individual. This implies a deeply unsympathetic attitude towards the state and all 
forms of government intervention.
Meta-ideology: A 
higher or second-order 
ideology that lays down 
the grounds on which 
ideological debate can 
take place.
Atomism: The belief that 
society is made up of a 
collection of largely self￾sufficient individuals who 
owe little or nothing to 
one another.

KEY IDEAS
LIBERALISM
 Individualism: Individualism (see p. 197) is the core principle of liberal ideology. It reflects a belief in the supreme 
importance of the human individual as opposed to any social group or collective body. Human beings are seen, first 
and foremost, as individuals. This implies both that they are of equal moral worth and that they possess separate and 
unique identities. The liberal goal is therefore to construct a society within which individuals can flourish and develop, 
each pursuing ‘the good’ as he or she defines it, to the best of his or her abilities. This has contributed to the view that 
liberalism is morally neutral, in the sense that it lays down a set of rules that allow individuals to make their own moral 
decisions.
 Freedom: Individual freedom (see p. 332), or liberty (the two terms are interchangeable), is the core value of 
liberalism; it is given priority over, say, equality, justice or authority. This arises naturally from a belief in the individual 
and the desire to ensure that each person is able to act as he or she chooses. Nevertheless, liberals advocate ‘freedom 
under the law’, as they recognize that one person’s liberty may be a threat to the liberty of others. They therefore 
endorse the ideal that individuals should enjoy the maximum possible liberty consistent with protecting the same 
liberties for others.
 Reason: Liberals believe that the world has a rational structure, and that this can be uncovered through the exercise 
of human reason and by critical enquiry. This inclines them to place their faith in the ability of individuals to make wise 
judgements on their own behalf, being, in most cases, the best judges of their own interests. It also encourages liberals 
to believe in progress and the capacity of human beings to resolve their differences through debate and argument, 
rather than bloodshed and war.
 Equality: Individualism implies a belief in foundational equality: that is, the belief that individuals are born equal, 
at least in terms of moral worth. This is reflected in a liberal commitment to equal rights and entitlements, notably 
in the form of legal equality (‘equality before the law’) and political equality (‘one person, one vote; one vote, one 
value’). However, as individuals do not possess the same levels of talent or willingness to work, liberals do not endorse 
social equality or an equality of outcome. Rather, they favour equality of opportunity that gives all individuals an equal 
chance to realize their unequal potential.
 Toleration: Liberals believe that toleration (that is, the willingness of people to allow others to think, speak and act in 
ways of which they disapprove) is both a guarantee of individual liberty and a means of social enrichment. They believe 
that pluralism (see p. 109), in the form of moral, cultural and political diversity, is positively healthy: it promotes debate 
and intellectual progress by ensuring that all beliefs are tested in a free market of ideas. Liberals, moreover, tend to 
believe that there is a balance or natural harmony between rival views and interests, and thus usually discount the idea 
of irreconcilable conflict.
 Consent: In the liberal view, authority and social relationships should always be based on consent or willing agreement. 
Government must therefore be based on the ‘consent of the governed’. This is a doctrine that encourages liberals to 
favour representation (see p. 243) and democracy, notably in the form of liberal democracy (see p. 108). Similarly, 
social bodies and associations are formed through contracts willingly entered into by individuals intent on pursuing 
their own self-interest. In this sense, authority arises from below and is always grounded in legitimacy (see p. 86).
 Constitutionalism: Although liberals see government as a vital guarantee of order and stability in society, they 
are constantly aware of the danger that government may become a tyranny against the individual. They therefore 
believe in limited government. This goal can be attained through the fragmentation of government power, by the 
creation of checks and balances amongst the various institutions of government, and by the establishment of a 
codified or written constitution embodying a bill of rights that defines the relationship between the state and the 
individual.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 33 23-07-2024 12:43:0634 POLITICS
In Thomas Paine’s (see p. 246) words, the state is a ‘necessary evil’. It is necessary in 
that, at the very least, it establishes order and security, and ensures that laws and 
contracts are enforced, which is essential to stopping individuals from infringing 
on the liberties of others. However, it is ‘evil’ in that it imposes a collective will on 
society, thus limiting the freedom and responsibilities of the individual. The classical 
liberal ideal is therefore the establishment of a minimal state, with a role that is 
limited to the protection of citizens from the encroachments of fellow citizens. In 
the form of economic liberalism, this position is underpinned by a deep faith in the 
mechanisms of the free market and the belief that the economy works best when left 
alone by government. As argued by classical liberal economists like David Ricardo 
(1772–1823) and Adam Smith (see p. 170), laissez-faire capitalism could guarantee 
prosperity, uphold individual liberty and, as this allows individuals to rise and fall 
according to merit, ensure social justice.
Modern liberalism
Modern liberalism is characterized by a more sympathetic attitude towards state 
intervention. Indeed, in the USA, the term ‘liberal’ is invariably taken to imply 
support for big government rather than ‘minimal’ government. This shift was 
born out of the recognition that industrial capitalism had merely generated new 
forms of injustice and left much of the population subject to the vagaries of the 
market. Influenced by the work of John Stuart Mill (see p. 245), the so-called ‘New 
Liberals’ such as T. H. Green (1836–82), Leonard Hobhouse (1864–1929) and J. A. 
Hobson (1858–1940) championed a broader, ‘positive’ view of freedom. From this 
perspective, freedom does not just mean being left alone, which might imply nothing 
more than the freedom to starve. Rather, it is linked to personal development and the 
flourishing of the individual; that is, the ability of the individual to gain fulfilment 
and achieve self-realization.
This view provided the basis for social or welfare liberalism. This is characterized by the 
belief that state intervention can and must enlarge liberty by safeguarding individuals 
from the social evils that blight individual existence and helping them realize their 
full potential. American philosopher John Dewey (1859–1952), for instance, argued 
that a strong, well-funded public education system was essential to the individual 
realizing their full potential, and to effectively exercising their democratic and human 
rights (Dewey 1916). Social liberal reformers also argued for welfare programmes 
like unemployment insurance, disability insurance and old-age pensions to protect 
the individual from extreme misfortune that would severely limit their freedom. 
Such programmes could be paid for by new programmes of redistribution, like 
progressive taxation. Modern liberals abandoned their unconditional belief in 
laissez-faire capitalism, largely as a result of John Maynard Keynes’ (see p. 178) theory 
that growth and prosperity could be maintained only through a system of managed 
or regulated capitalism, with key economic responsibilities being placed in the hands 
of the state.
Nevertheless, modern liberal support for collective provision and government 
intervention has always been conditional. Their concern has been with the plight 
of the weak and vulnerable, those who are literally not able to help themselves. 
Economic liberalism: A 
belief in the market as a 
self-regulating mechanism 
tending naturally to deliver 
general prosperity and 
opportunities for all.
Big government:
Interventionist 
government, usually 
understood to imply 
economic management 
and social regulation.
Welfare: Government 
programmes designed to 
ensure that all members 
of a society have their

inequalities amongst 
members of a society by 
programmes that transfer 
wealth from the wealthier 
to the poor.

Their goal is to raise individuals to the point where they are able, once again, 
to take responsibility for their own circumstances and make their own moral 
choices. The  most influential modern attempt to reconcile the principles of 
liberalism with the politics of welfare and redistribution was undertaken by John 
Rawls in A Theory of Justice (1971), which argued that society should be structured 
so the greatest possible liberty can be given an individual without infringing on 
the freedoms of others, and inequality should only be allowed to persist if those 
at the bottom are better off than under an unequal arrangement than they would 
be in an equal one.
KEY THINKER
JOHN RAWLS (1921–2002)
US academic and political philosopher. His major work, A Theory of Justice (1971), is regarded as 
the most important work of political philosophy written in English since the Second World War. 
It has influenced modern liberals and social democrats alike. Rawls proposed a theory of ‘justice 
as fairness’ that is based on the belief that social inequality can be justified only if it is of benefit 
to the least advantaged. This presumption in favour of equality is rooted in Rawls’ belief that 
most people, deprived of knowledge about their own talents and abilities, would choose to live 
in an egalitarian society, rather than an inegalitarian one. As, for most people, the fear of being 
poor outweighs the desire to be rich, redistribution and welfare can be defended on grounds of 
fairness. Rawls’ other works include Political Liberalism (1993) and The Law of Peoples (1999).

Neoliberalism
Neoliberalism is an updated version of classical liberalism that was developed 
in the writings of free-market economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton 
Friedman (see p. 179), and philosophers such as Robert Nozick (see p. 73). The 
central pillars of neoliberalism are the market and the individual. The principal 
neoliberal goal is to minimize the role of state in the economy, in the belief that 
unregulated market capitalism will deliver efficiency, growth and widespread 
prosperity. For neoliberals, government, however well intentioned, invariably 
has a damaging effect on human affairs. Thus, neoliberalism prioritizes private 
enterprise over state enterprise or nationalization. Such ideas are associated 
with a form of rugged individualism, expressed in Margaret Thatcher’s famous 
assertion that ‘there is no such thing as society, only individuals and their 
families’. Neoliberals have critiqued welfare programmes and the creation of 
the so-called nanny state, which they argue breeds a culture of dependence, 
stifles the incentive to work hard and innovate, and undermines freedom, 
which is understood as freedom of choice in the marketplace. Instead, faith is 
placed in self-help, individual responsibility and entrepreneurialism. Neoliberal 
economic ideas gained significant traction in West in the 1980s and are widely 
seen to be advanced through the process of globalization (see p. 182), viewed by 
Nanny state: A state 
with extensive social 
responsibilities; the 
term implies that 
welfare programmes 
are unwarranted and 
demeaning to the 
individual.

some as neoliberal globalization. Though neoliberalism has increasingly become 
associated with conservative and right-wing politics, particularly the New Right 
(see pp. 39–40), its origins are firmly within the classical liberal tradition.
Conservatism
Conservative ideas and doctrines first emerged in the late eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries. They arose as a reaction to the growing pace of economic and political 
change, which was in many ways symbolized by the French Revolution. In trying to 
resist the pressures unleashed by the growth of liberalism, socialism and nationalism, 
conservatism stood in defence of an increasingly embattled traditional social order. 
However, conservatism is a very broad ideology, and how it has been expressed and 
practised has varied significantly throughout history.
Clear divisions in conservative thinking have been apparent right from the outset. 
In continental Europe, a form of conservatism emerged that was characterized by 
the work of thinkers such as Joseph de Maistre (1753–1821). This conservatism 
was starkly autocratic and reactionary, rejecting out of hand any idea of 
reform. A more cautious, more flexible and, ultimately, more successful form 
of conservatism nevertheless developed in the UK and the USA, characterized 
by Edmund Burke’s belief in ‘change in order to conserve’. This stance enabled 
conservatives in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to embrace the causes 
of social reform and democratization but at a more gradual pace that preserved 
traditional values and structures. The high point of this tradition came in the 
post-war period, when globally many conservative parties even came to accept 
and espouse their own versions of Keynesian social democracy. However, this 
stance increasingly came under pressure from the 1970s onwards because of the 
emergence of the New Right, whose radically anti-statist and anti-paternalist 
brand of conservatism draws heavily on classical liberal themes and values 
(Barry 1987).
Reactionary: Reactionary 
politics is that which 
opposes social, political 
and economic change, 
and/or seeks to return 
society to some previous 
state of affairs.
KEY THINKER
FRIEDRICH VON HAYEK (1899–1992)
Austrian economist and political philosopher. An academic who taught at the London School 
of Economics and the Universities of Chicago, Freiburg and Salzburg, Hayek was awarded 
the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1974. As an exponent of the so-called ‘Austrian School’, 
he was a firm believer in individualism and market order, and an implacable critic of socialism. 
The Road to Serfdom (1948) was a pioneering work that attacked economic interventionism. 
In later works such as The Constitution of Liberty (1960) and Law, Legislation and Liberty 
(1979), Hayek developed themes in political philosophy. Hayek’s writings fused liberal and 
conservative elements and had a considerable impact on the emerging New Right in global 
politics.

KEY THINKER
EDMUND BURKE (1729–97)
Anglo-Irish statesman and political theorist. Often seen as the father of the Anglo-American 
conservative tradition, Burke’s enduring reputation is based on a series of works, notably 
Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), that were critical of the French Revolution. 
Though sympathetic to the American Revolution, Burke was deeply critical of the attempt 
to recast French politics in accordance with abstract principles such as liberty, equality 
and fraternity, arguing that wisdom resided largely in experience, tradition and history. 
Nevertheless, he held that the French monarchy was, in part, responsible for its own fate 
since it had obstinately refused to ‘change in order to conserve’. Burke had a gloomy view of 
government, recognizing that it could prevent evil but rarely promote good. He supported 
free-market economics on the grounds that it reflected natural law. Source: Getty Images/

Paternalistic conservatism
The paternalistic strand in conservative thought is entirely consistent with 
principles such as tradition, hierarchy and duty, and it can therefore be seen as an 
outgrowth of traditional conservatism. Often traced back to the early writings of 
Benjamin Disraeli (1804–81), paternalism draws on a combination of prudence and 
principle. In warning of the danger of Great Britain being divided into ‘two nations: 
the Rich and the Poor’, Disraeli articulated a widespread fear of social revolution. 
This warning amounted to an appeal to the self-interest of the privileged, who 
needed to recognize that ‘reform from above’ was preferable to ‘revolution from 
below’. This message was underpinned by an appeal to the principles of duty and 
social obligation rooted in neofeudal ideas such as noblesse oblige. In this view, 
duty is the price of privilege; the powerful and propertied inherit a responsibility 
to look after the less well-off in the broader interests of social cohesion and unity. 
Disraeli’s resulting ‘One-Nation principle’, the cornerstone of what since the early 
nineteenth century has been termed a Tory position, reflects not so much the ideal 
of social equality as a cohesive and stable hierarchy that arises organically. For 
Tories, institutions like monarchy, the church and aristocracy are important pillars 
of stability that help create continuity and order. And prior to widespread acceptance 
of democracy, Tories also believed they constituted a natural aristocracy which 
was best placed to guide society and make the decisions that would ensure society’s’ 
survival and prosperity.
The One-Nation tradition embodies not only a disposition towards social reform 
but also an essentially pragmatic or ‘middle way’ attitude towards economic policy. 
This approach does not embrace either of the two ideological models of economic 
organization: laissez-faire capitalism on the one hand, or state socialism and central 
planning on the other. The former was rejected on the grounds that it results in a 
free-for-all, which makes social cohesion impossible, and penalizes the weak and 
vulnerable. The latter was dismissed because it produces a state monolith and crushes

KEY IDEAS
CONSERVATISM
 Tradition: The central theme of conservative thought, ‘the desire to conserve’, is closely linked to the perceived 
virtues of tradition, respect for established customs, and institutions that have endured through time. In this view, 
tradition reflects the accumulated wisdom of the past, and institutions and practices that have been tested by time, 
and it should be preserved for the benefit of the living and for generations yet to come. Tradition also has the virtue of 
promoting a sense of social and historical belonging.
 Pragmatism: Conservatives have traditionally emphasized the limitations of human rationality, which arise from the 
infinite complexity of the world in which we live. Abstract principles and systems of thought are therefore distrusted, 
and instead faith is placed in experience, history and, above all, pragmatism: the belief that action should be shaped 
by practical circumstances and ‘what works’. Conservatives have thus preferred to describe their own beliefs as 
an attitude or an approach to life, rather than as an ideology, although they reject the idea that this amounts to 
unprincipled opportunism.
 Human imperfection: The conservative view of human nature is broadly pessimistic. In this view, human beings are 
limited, dependent and security-seeking creatures, drawn to the familiar and the tried and tested, and needing to live 
in stable and orderly communities. In addition, individuals are morally corrupt: they are tainted by selfishness, greed 
and the thirst for power. The roots of crime and disorder therefore reside within the human individual rather than in 
society. For conservatives, the maintenance of order (see p. 452) requires a strong state, the enforcement of strict 
laws and stiff penalties.
 Organicism: Instead of seeing society as an artefact that is a product of human ingenuity, conservatives have 
traditionally viewed society as an organic whole, or living entity. Society is thus structured by natural necessity, with 
its various institutions, or the ‘fabric of society’ (families, local communities, the nation and so on), contributing to the 
health and stability of society. The whole is more than a collection of its individual parts. Shared values and a common 
culture are also seen as being vital to the maintenance of social cohesion.
 Hierarchy: In the conservative view, gradations of social position and status are natural and inevitable in an organic 
society. These reflect the differing roles and responsibilities of, for example, employers and workers, teachers and 
pupils, and parents and children. Nevertheless, in this view, hierarchy and inequality do not give rise to conflict, 
because society is bound together by mutual obligations and reciprocal duties. Indeed, as a person’s ‘station in life’ is 
determined largely by luck and the accident of birth, the prosperous and privileged acquire a particular responsibility 
of care for the less fortunate.
 Authority: Conservatives hold that, to some degree, authority is always exercised ‘from above’, providing 
leadership (see p. 365), guidance and support for those who lack the knowledge, experience or education to 
act wisely in their own interests. Although the idea of a ‘natural’ aristocracy was once influential, authority and 
leadership are now more commonly seen as resulting from experience and training. The virtue of authority is 
that it is a source of social cohesion, giving people a clear sense of who they are and what is expected of them. 
Freedom must therefore coexist with responsibility; it therefore consists largely of a willing acceptance of 
obligations and duties.
 Property: Conservatives see property ownership as being vital because it gives people security and a measure of 
independence from government, and it encourages them to respect the law and the property of others. Property 
is also an exteriorization of people’s personalities, in that they ‘see’ themselves in what they own: their houses, their 
cars and so on. However, property ownership involves duties as well as rights. In this view, we are, in a sense, merely 
custodians of property that has either been inherited from past generations or may be of value to future ones.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 38 23-07-2024 12:43:06Political Ideas and Ideologies 39
all forms of independence and enterprise. The solution therefore lies in a blend of 
market competition and government regulation, or what the UK prime minister 
Harold Macmillan called ‘private enterprise without selfishness’.
Similar conclusions were drawn after 1945 by continental European conservatives, 
who embraced the principles of Christian democracy, most rigorously 
developed in the ‘social market’ philosophy (see p. 176) of Germany’s Christian 
Democratic Union (CDU). This philosophy embraces a market strategy, insofar 
as it highlights the virtues of private enterprise and competition; but it is social, 
in that it believes that the prosperity so gained should be employed for the 
broader benefit of society. Such a position draws from Catholic social theory, 
which advances an organic view of society that stresses social harmony. Christian 
democracy thus highlights the importance of intermediate institutions, such as 
churches, unions and business groups, bound together by the notion of social 
partnership. The paternalistic strand of modern conservative thought is often 
linked to the idea of ‘compassionate conservatism’.
The New Right
The New Right represents a departure in conservative thought that amounted to a 
kind of counter-revolution against both the post-1945 drift towards state intervention 
and the spread of progressive social values. New Right ideas can be traced back to 
the 1970s and the conjunction between the apparent failure of Keynesian social 
democracy, signalled by the end of the post-war boom, and growing concern about 
social breakdown and the decline of authority. Such ideas had their greatest impact 
in the UK and the USA, where they were articulated in the 1980s in the politics and 
policies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. They have also had a wider, even 
worldwide, influence in bringing about a general shift from state- to market-orientated 
forms of organization, particularly with the fall of Eastern European communist 
regimes in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The New Right does not constitute a 
coherent and systematic philosophy as there have been several generations of ‘new 
right’ thinking, which have blended a variety of traditions, including neoliberalism 
(see p. 178), neoconservatism and paleoconservatism. Although there are political 
and ideological tensions between these traditions, the New Right can broadly be 
thought of as in favour of a strong but minimal state.
Neoconservatism
Neoconservatism is a political movement that advocates Western political and social 
values in international affairs and advocates for ‘peace through strength’, supporting 
strong national defence but also free trade and economic globalization. Many 
prominent early neoconservatives were former liberals who grew disillusioned with 
the counterculture of the 1960s and the perceived failures in domestic and foreign 
policy of the Kennedy–Johnson era. Neoconservatives are wary of the growing 
influence of supranational bodies such as the UN and the EU, particularly in the 
USA, where under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and George W. 
Bush, neoconservative thinking advocated more assertive intervention by the United 
States into global conflicts. Neoconservatives advocate for what they think of as 
Christian democracy:
An ideological 
tendency within 
European conservatism, 
characterized by 
commitment to social￾market principles and 
qualified interventionism.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 39 23-07-2024 12:43:0640 POLITICS
‘traditional’ Western values like the democracy, freedom of speech, personal liberty 
and self-reliance. Though many accept the broad free-market tenets of neoliberalism, 
neoconservatives are less dogmatic about economic questions, focusing more on 
social and foreign policy.
Paleoconservatism
Emerging in the same period as neoconservatism, paleoconservatives reassert 
nineteenth-century conservative social principles. The paleoconservative New Right 
wishes, above all, to restore authority and return to traditional values, notably those 
linked to the family, religion and the nation. Authority is seen as guaranteeing social 
stability, on the basis that it generates discipline and respect, while shared values 
and a common culture are believed to generate social cohesion and make civilized 
existence possible. They are particularly sceptical of permissiveness, the cult of 
the self and ‘doing one’s own thing’, thought of as the values of the 1960s, and have 
advocated traditional religious positions on questions such as gay marriage, abortion 
and education. Paleoconservatives tend to view the emergence of multicultural 
and multi-religious societies with concern, on the basis that they are conflict￾ridden and inherently unstable. This position also tends to be linked to an insular 
form of nationalism that is sceptical about both multiculturalism (see p. 205) and 
interventionism, as they see the state’s obligations as primarily to its own citizens 
rather than the international community.
Though contemporary conservatives tend to agree on questions of economics and 
the role of the state, sharp differences over foreign and social policy questions have 
brought neoliberals, neoconservatives and paleoconservatives into frequent conflict. 
Though traditionally the neoliberal and neoconservative traditions were more 
predominant in conservative politics and the New Right throughout the twentieth 
century, in the twenty-first century, paleoconservatives have arguably been on the 
ascendancy, particular with the rise of right-wing populists like Donald Trump and 
Jair Bolsonaro (see p. 12), who have courted evangelical Christianity, traditional 
moralism and nationalism as part of their platforms. The contemporary ‘alt-right’ 
movement is seen by some scholars as an extremist evolution of the paleoconservative 
tradition and an implicit rejection of the New Right (Hawley 2017).
Socialism
Although socialist ideas can be traced back to Thomas More’s Utopia (1516), or 
even Plato’s Republic, socialism did not take shape as a political creed until the early 
nineteenth century. It developed as a reaction against the emergence of industrial 
capitalism. Socialism first articulated the interests of artisans and craftsmen 
threatened by the spread of factory production, but it was soon being linked to the 
growing industrial working class. In its earliest forms, socialism tended to have 
a fundamentalist (see p. 55), utopian and revolutionary character. Its goal was 
to abolish a capitalist economy based on market exchange and replace it with a 
qualitatively different socialist society, usually to be constructed on the principle of 
common ownership. The most influential representative of this brand of socialism 
was Karl Marx, whose ideas provided the foundations for twentieth-century 
communism (see p. 43).
Permissiveness: The 
willingness to allow people 
to make their own moral 
choices; permissiveness 
suggests that there are no 
authoritative values.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 40 23-07-2024 12:43:06Political Ideas and Ideologies 41
From the late nineteenth century onwards, however, a reformist socialist tradition 
emerged that reflected the gradual integration of the working classes into capitalist 
society through an improvement in working conditions and wages, and the growth 
of trade unions and socialist political parties. This brand of socialism proclaimed 
the possibility of a peaceful, gradual and legal transition to socialism, brought 
about through democratic rather than revolutionary means. Reformist socialism 
drew on two sources. The first was a humanist tradition of ethical socialism, linked 
to thinkers such as Charles Fourier (1772–1837) and William Morris (1834–96). 
The second was a form of revisionist Marxism developed primarily by Eduard 
Bernstein (see p. 46).
During much of the twentieth century, the socialist movement was thus divided 
into two rival camps. Revolutionary socialists, following the example of Vladimir 
Lenin (see p. 107) and the Bolsheviks, called themselves ‘communists’, while 
reformist socialists, who practised a form of constitutional politics, embraced 
what increasingly came to be called ‘social democracy’. This rivalry focused not 
only on the most appropriate means of achieving socialism but also on the nature 
of the socialist goal itself. Social democrats turned their backs on fundamentalist 
principles such as common ownership and planning, and recast socialism in terms 
of welfare, redistribution and economic management. Both forms of socialism, 
however, experienced crises in the late-twentieth century that encouraged some to 
proclaim the ‘death of socialism’ and the emergence of a post-socialist society. The 
most dramatic event in this process was the collapse of communism brought about 
by the Eastern European revolutions of 1989–91, but there was also a continued 
retreat of social democracy from traditional principles, making it, some would 
argue, indistinguishable from modern liberalism.
Marxism
As a theoretical system, Marxism has constituted the principal alternative to the 
liberal rationalism that has dominated Western culture and intellectual enquiry in 
the modern period. As a political force, in the form of the international communist 
movement, Marxism has also been seen as the major enemy of Western capitalism, at 
least throughout the twentieth century. This highlights a central difficulty in dealing 
with Marxism: the difference between Marxism as a social philosophy derived 
from the classic writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (1820–95), and the 
phenomenon of twentieth-century communism, which in many ways departed from 
and revised classical principles.
Classical Marxism
The core of classical Marxism – the Marxism of Marx – rests on a philosophy of 
history known as historical materialism. This philosophy highlights the importance 
of economic life and the conditions under which people produce and reproduce 
their means of subsistence. Marx held that the economic ‘base’, consisting essentially 
of the ‘mode of production’, or economic system, conditions or determines the 
ideological and political ‘superstructure’. Following the ideas of Georg Hegel (see 
p. 62), Marx believed that the driving force of historical change was the dialectic, 
Revisionism: The 
modification of original 
or established beliefs; 
revisionism can imply the 
abandonment of principle 
or a loss of conviction.
Historical materialism:
The Marxist theory of 
history which holds that 
economic conditions 
ultimately structure 
law, politics, culture and 
other aspects of social 
existence.

a process of interaction between competing forces that results in a higher stage of 
development. In its materialist version, this model implies that historical change 
is a consequence of internal contradictions within an economic system, reflected 
in class conflict. Like all earlier class societies, capitalism is therefore doomed to 
KEY IDEAS
SOCIALISM
 Community: The core of socialism is the vision of human beings as social creatures linked by the existence of a 
common humanity. As the poet John Donne put it, ‘no man is an Island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the 
Continent, a part of the main’. This refers to the importance of community, and it highlights the degree to which 
individual identity is fashioned by social interaction and membership of social groups and collective bodies. Socialists 
are inclined to emphasize nurture over nature, and to explain individual behaviour mainly in terms of social factors, 
rather than innate qualities.
 Fraternity: As human beings share a common humanity, they are bound together by a sense of comradeship and 
fraternity. This encourages socialists to prefer cooperation to competition, and to favour collectivism over individualism 
(see p. 197). In this view, cooperation enables people to harness their collective energies and strengthens the bonds of 
community, while competition pits individuals against each other, breeding resentment, conflict and hostility.
 Social equality: Equality (see p. 511) is the central value of socialism. Socialism is sometimes portrayed as a form of 
egalitarianism, the belief in the primacy of equality over other values. In particular, socialists emphasize the importance 
of social equality, an equality of outcome as opposed to equality of opportunity. They believe that a measure of social 
equality is the essential guarantee of social stability and cohesion, encouraging individuals to identify with their fellow 
human beings. It also provides the basis for the exercise of legal and political rights. However, socialists disagree about 
the extent to which social equality can and should be brought about. While Marxists have believed in absolute social 
equality, brought about by the collectivization of production wealth, social democrats have favoured merely narrowing 
material inequalities, often more focused on equalizing opportunities than outcomes.
 Need: Sympathy for equality also reflects the socialist belief that material benefits should be distributed on the basis 
of need, rather than merit, status or labour. The classic formulation of this principle is found in Marx’s communist 
principle of distribution: ‘from each according to his ability, to each according to his need’. This reflects the belief 
that the satisfaction of basic needs (hunger, thirst, shelter, health, personal security and so on) is a prerequisite for a 
worthwhile human existence and participation in social life. Clearly, however, distribution according to need requires 
people to be motivated by moral incentives, rather than just material ones.
 Social class: Socialism has often been associated with a form of class politics. First, socialists have tended to 
analyse society in terms of the distribution of income or wealth, and they have thus seen social class (see p. 194) as a 
significant (usually the most significant) social cleavage. Second, socialism has traditionally been associated with the 
interests of an oppressed and exploited working class, and it has traditionally regarded the working class as an agent 
of social change, even revolution. Nevertheless, class divisions can be mended, and the socialist goal is the substantial 
reduction, if not eradication, of economic and social inequalities.
 Communal ownership: The relationship between socialism and communal (rather than private) ownership of 
property has been deeply controversial. Some see it as the end of socialism itself, and others see it instead simply as 
a means of generating broader equality. The socialist case for communal ownership is that it is a means of harnessing 
material resources to the common good, with private property being seen to promote selfishness, acquisitiveness and 
social division. Modern socialism, however, has moved away from this narrow concern with the politics of ownership.

collapse; in this case as a result of conflict between the bourgeoisie or capitalist 
class, the owners of productive wealth, and the proletariat, who are, in effect, 
‘wage slaves’. This conflict is irreconcilable, because the proletariat is necessarily 
and systematically exploited under capitalism, the bourgeoisie living by extracting 
‘surplus value’ from its labour.
According to Marx, the inevitable proletarian revolution will occur once a series 
of deepening crises have brought the proletariat to full class consciousness. This 
would allow the working masses to recognize the fact of their own exploitation 
and so become a revolutionary force. The proletarian revolution would usher 
in a transitionary ‘socialist’ period of development, characterized by the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. However, as class antagonisms fade and a fully 
communist society comes into existence, this proletarian state will slowly give way 
to a communist society that will be both classless and stateless. As a system of 
‘commodity production’ gives rise to one based on ‘production for use’ and geared 
to the satisfaction of genuine human needs, ‘the free development of each would 
become the precondition for the free development of all’ (Marx 1848).
Bourgeoisie: A Marxist 
term, denoting the 
ruling class of a capitalist 
society, the owners of 
productive wealth.
Proletariat: A Marxist 
term, denoting a class that 
subsists through the sale 
of its labour power; strictly 
speaking, the proletariat 
is not equivalent to the 
working class.
Dictatorship of the 
proletariat: A temporary 
proletarian state, 
established to prevent 
counter-revolution and 
oversee the transition 
from capitalism to 
communism.
KEY THINKER
KARL MARX (1818–83)
German philosopher, economist and political thinker. After a brief career as a university 
teacher, Marx took up journalism and became increasingly involved with the socialist 
movement. He settled in London after being expelled from Prussia and worked for the rest of 
his life as an active revolutionary and writer, supported by his friend and lifelong collaborator 
Friedrich Engels. In 1864, Marx helped found the First International, an organization of radical 
socialist groups and trade unions, which collapsed in 1871 because of growing antagonism 
between Marx’s supporters and the growing anarchist movement. Marx’s great work of 
economic analysis was the three-volume Capital (1867, 1885, 1894), though his best-known 
and most accessible works are the Communist Manifesto (1848) and Eighteenth Brumaire of 
Louis Bonaparte (1852). Source: Getty Images/

Marxism–Leninism
Marxism in practice is inextricably linked to the experience of Soviet communism, 
and especially to the contribution of the first two Soviet leaders, Vladimir Lenin 
(see p. 107) and Joseph Stalin (1879–1953). Indeed, nearly all twentieth-century 
communist movements are best understood as following a form of classical Marxism 
modified by a set of Leninist theories and doctrines. Lenin’s central contribution 
to Marxism was his theory of the revolutionary or vanguard party. This reflected 
Leninism: Lenin’s 
theoretical contributions 
to Marxism, notably his 
belief in the need for a 
‘vanguard’ party to raise 
the proletariat to class 
consciousness.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 43 23-07-2024 12:43:0744 POLITICS
Lenin’s fear that the proletariat, deluded by bourgeois ideas and beliefs, would not 
realize its revolutionary potential because it could not develop beyond ‘trade-union 
consciousness’: a desire to improve working and living conditions rather than to 
overthrow capitalism. A revolutionary party, armed with Marxism, was therefore 
needed to serve as the ‘vanguard of the working class’. In due course this party, 
composed of professional and dedicated revolutionaries, became the model for 
communist parties across the globe.
The USSR was, however, more profoundly affected by Stalin’s ‘second revolution’ in 
the 1930s than it had been by the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. In reshaping Soviet 
society, Stalin created a model of communism that was followed in the post-1945 
period by states such as China, North Korea and Cuba, and throughout Eastern 
Europe. What may be called Stalinism was initiated with the launch in 1928 of 
the first Five-Year Plan, which brought about the swift and total eradication of 
private enterprise. This was followed in 1929 by the collectivization of agriculture. 
All resources were brought under the control of the state, and a system of central 
planning was established. Stalin’s political changes were no less dramatic. During 
the 1930s, Stalin transformed the USSR into a personal dictatorship through a series 
of purges that eradicated all vestiges of opposition and debate from the Communist 
Party, the state bureaucracy and the military. In effect, Stalin turned the USSR into a 
dictatorship, operating through systematic intimidation, repression and terror.
Although the more brutal features of orthodox communism did not survive Stalin’s 
death in 1953, the core principles of the Leninism (hierarchical organization and 
discipline) and of Stalinism (state collectivization and central planning) stubbornly 
resisted pressure for reform. Over the subsequent decades, economic stagnation and 
decline, and growing social problems and unrest, eventually prompted the collapse of 
the Soviet Union in 1991, consigning Soviet communism to what Leon Trotsky (see 
p. 418) had, in very different circumstances, called ‘the dustbin of history’. However, 
political Stalinism survives in China, despite the embrace of market reforms, and 
North Korea remains an orthodox communist regime.
Neo-Marxism
A more complex and subtle form of Marxism developed in Western Europe. 
By contrast with the mechanistic and avowedly scientific notions of traditional 
Marxism, neo-Marxism tended to be influenced by Hegelian ideas and by the stress 
on ‘Man the creator’ found in Marx’s early writings. In other words, human beings 
were seen as makers of history and not simply as puppets controlled by impersonal 
material forces. By insisting that there was an interplay between economics and 
politics, between the material circumstances of life and the capacity of human beings 
to shape their own destinies, neo-Marxists were able to break free from the ‘base–
superstructure’ straitjacket.
Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukács (1885–1971) was one of the first to present Marxism 
as a humanistic philosophy. He emphasized the process of ‘reification’, through which 
capitalism dehumanizes workers by reducing them to passive objects or marketable 
commodities. In his Prison Notebooks (1929–35), Antonio Gramsci emphasized the 
degree to which capitalism was maintained not merely by economic domination, 
Stalinism: The structures 
of Stalin’s Soviet Union, 
particularly a one-party 
state and centrally 
planned economy 
sustained by systematic 
political oppression.

but also by political and cultural factors. He called this ideological ‘hegemony’ (see 
p. 218). A more overtly Hegelian brand of Marxism was developed by the Frankfurt 
School, the leading members of which were Theodor Adorno (1903–69), Max 
Horkheimer (1895–1973) and Herbert Marcuse. Frankfurt theorists developed 
the critical theory approach (see pp. 17–18), a blend of Marxist political economy, 
Hegelian philosophy and Freudian psychology, which had a considerable impact 
on the New Left in the 1960s. Later Frankfurt school members included Jürgen 
Habermas (see p. 90). While early critical theorists were primarily concerned with 
the analysis of discrete societies, later theorists have tended to give greater attention 
to uncovering inequalities and asymmetries in world affairs. This has been evident 
in an emphasis on the hegemonic power of the United States through globalization 
(Cox, R., 1987) and the analysis of capitalism as a ‘world-system’ (Wallerstein 1984).
KEY THINKER
HERBERT MARCUSE (1898–1979)
German political philosopher and social theorist, and co-founder of the Frankfurt School. A 
refugee from Hitler’s Germany, Marcuse lived in the USA from 1934. He developed a form 
of neo-Marxism that drew heavily on Georg Hegel and Sigmund Freud. Marcuse came to 
prominence in the 1960s as a leading thinker of the New Left and a ‘guru’ of the student 
movement. He portrayed advanced industrial society as an all-encompassing system of 
repression that subdued argument and debate, and absorbed opposition. His hopes rested 
not on the proletariat, but on marginalized groups such as students, ethnic minorities, women 
and workers in the developing world. His most important works include Reason and Revolution
(1941), Eros and Civilization (1955) and One-Dimensional Man (1964).

Social democracy
Social democrats reject the revolutionary politics of Marxist traditions and 
authoritarian, repressive nature of Leninism and Stalinism, seeking instead a 
peaceful transformation of a society towards socialism through open, democratic 
and cooperative means. On economic matters, social democracy lacks the theoretical 
coherence of, say, classical liberalism or fundamentalist socialism. Whereas the 
former is ideologically committed to the market, and the latter champions the cause 
of common ownership, social democracy stands for a balance between the market 
and the state, a balance between the individual and the community. At the heart of 
social democracy there is a compromise between, on the one hand, an acceptance of 
the free market as the central mechanism that generates wealth and, on the other, a 
desire to distribute wealth in accordance with moral, rather than market, principles. 
For social democrats, this conversion to market-thinking was a difficult, and at times 
painful, process that was dictated more by practical circumstances and electoral 
advantage than by ideological conviction.
Fundamentalist socialism:
A form of socialism that 
seeks to abolish capitalism 
and replace it with a 
qualitatively different kind 
of society.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 45 23-07-2024 12:43:0746 POLITICS
Social democracy cannot simply be confined to the socialist tradition, as it draws on 
a socialist belief in compassion and a common humanity, a liberal commitment to 
positive freedom and equal opportunities, and in some respects a conservative sense 
of paternal duty and care. Social democracy and social liberalism are ideologically 
close, and both embrace principles such as welfarism, redistribution and social justice. 
In the form of Keynesian social democracy, which was widely accepted in the early 
period after the Second World War, it was associated with a clear desire to ‘humanize’ 
capitalism through state intervention. It was believed that Keynesian economic 
policies (see pp. 177–178) would secure full employment, a mixed economy would 
help government to regulate economic activity and comprehensive welfare provision 
funded via progressive taxation would narrow the gap between rich and poor. The 
establishment of welfare states (see p. 75) in some parts of Europe, particularly the 
Nordic nations of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, are seen by some as examples of 
the success of social democracy in fusing liberal and socialist ideas into reality.
KEY THINKER
EDUARD BERNSTEIN (1850–1932)
German socialist politician and theorist. An early member of the German Social Democratic 
Party (SPD), Bernstein became one of the leading advocates of revisionism, the attempt to 
revise and modernize orthodox Marxism. Influenced by British Fabianism and the philosophy of 
Immanuel Kant (see p. 461), Bernstein developed a largely empirical critique that emphasized 
the absence of class war and proclaimed the possibility of a peaceful transition to socialism. 
This is described in Evolutionary Socialism (1898). He left the SPD over his opposition to the 
First World War, although he subsequently returned and was a minister during the Weimar 
Period. Bernstein is often seen as one of the founding figures of modern social democracy.

The third way
The ‘third way’ refers to a variety of attempts by social-democratic parties, particularly 
in Western developed nations like Germany, Italy and the UK, to reconcile old-style 
social democracy with, at least, the electorally attractive aspects of neoliberalism. 
Although ‘new’ social democracy is imprecise and subject interpretation, certain 
characteristic themes can nevertheless be identified. The first of these is the belief 
that socialism, at least in the form of ‘top-down’ state intervention, is dead: there is 
no realistic alternative to the market economy. With this goes a general acceptance 
of globalization and the belief that capitalism has mutated into a ‘knowledge 
economy’, which places a premium on information technology, individual skills and 
both labour and business flexibility. In this light, the state came to be seen not as a 
vehicle for wholesale social restructuring, but as a means of promoting international 
competitiveness; particularly by building up education and skills.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
PIRATE PARTIES? NEW IDEAS CUT ACROSS OLD IDEOLOGIES
Ideologies are constantly adapting in response to an ever￾changing political landscape, but periodically new issues 
emerge in politics which established political movements 
and ideologies do not cater to. In the twenty-first century, 
major parties in many mature democracies have seen their 
vote share decline as the public turns to alternative parties 
that better address their own issues and ideas. While these 
alternative parties may start off as vehicles to simply raise 
individual issues, over time they may evolve into more 
formalized traditions of political thought and systems of 
values, hence, ideologies.
Such is arguably evident in the case of pirate parties. In 
recent decades, copyright protection laws around the world 
have become far more extensive and restrictive, a move 
that has mostly benefited large media companies which 
hold copyrights on music, movies and images. Such laws 
have become more controversial in the digital age, where 
media can be shared freely and instantly, but ownership 
of that media may be restricted. Digital ‘piracy’ became a 
major issue in early 2000s as people began sharing music 
freely over the internet, while the music industry launched 
high-profile lawsuits to force people to pay for that music 
or punish those that refused to. Yet critics blanched at the 
heavy-handed tactics of billion-dollar music companies 
suing small offenders, and questioned the legitimacy of the 
laws which allowed such companies to charge high prices 
to listen to music which may be almost a century old and 
whose original recording artist had long since died. For 
those critics, the scales for copyright were now extremely 
imbalanced, giving rights owners too much power 
and creating a culture of litigiousness that suppressed 
knowledge sharing, creative transformation and legitimate 
non-commercial usage.
Frustrated at the lack of interest amongst Swedish 
politicians in addressing the problem of imbalanced 
copyright laws, Rick Falkvinge founded the Pirate Party 
of Sweden in 2006, and pirate parties appeared in several 
other countries that year. Initially, these parties focused 
on exempting non-commercial reuse from copyright 
enforcement and reducing the length and restrictiveness 
of copyright protections on media like music and movies. 
However, many pirate activists embraced a broader 
philosophy behind the issue – specifically, that copyright 
represented an illegitimate and unethical restriction on the 
freedom of information and knowledge. For example, most 
of the world’s research publications lie behind pay walls, 
making them inaccessible to most of the public, despite 
public funds often paying for that research in the first 
place. Pirate parties have expanded their policies into other 
areas, such as reducing the length and nature of patent 
protection on pharmaceuticals so they can be improved 
and made cheaply available to those who need them faster.
Though pirate parties began as a single-issue anti￾copyright movement, in recent years they have now come 
to represent a new ideology focused on freedom of speech, 
openness and stronger civil rights. They have been general 
advocates of consumer protection, public accountability, 
anti-corruption and greater transparency into government, 
court and police proceedings. Pirate parties have also 
embraced direct democracy and e-democracy, seeing the 
internet as a vessel through which the public should have 
a more direct voice in their political systems and even to 
vote on legislation directly. And though it began as a largely 
protest movement, in some countries, like Iceland and 
Czechia, the pirate movement has become mainstream, 
receiving more than 10 per cent of the vote in national 
elections and electing parliamentarians and mayors into 
office. Pirate politics transcends the traditional left–right 
divide in politics, and has evolved into a unique ideology 
that is growing in relevance in the digital age.

A further feature of ‘new’ social-democratic politics is that it has broken with socialist 
egalitarianism and embraced instead the liberal ideas of equality of opportunity 
and meritocracy. Third way politicians typically endorse welfare reform, rejecting 
both the neoliberal emphasis on ‘standing on your own two feet’ and the traditional 
social-democratic commitment to ‘cradle to grave’ welfare in favour of an essentially 
social liberal belief in ‘helping people to help themselves’. Or, as the former US 
President Bill Clinton put it, giving people ‘a hand up, not a hand out’. This has led to 
support for what has been called a ‘workfare state’, in which government provision of 
benefits or education is conditional on individuals seeking work and becoming self￾reliant. Critics of this new social democracy, on the other hand, argue either that it 
is contradictory, in that it simultaneously endorses the dynamism of the market and 
warns against its tendency to social disintegration, and that, far from being a centre￾left project, it amounts to a shift to the right.
While third way or social-democratic ideals have been increasingly popular 
amongst left-leaning parties in the developed world, there has been less enthusiasm 
in developing countries, and frustration that simply accepting the prevailing global 
economic market order can lock poorer countries into a permanent condition of 
underdevelopment (Giddens 2001). The election of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela 
in 1999 set off the so-called ‘pink tide’ in Latin America, with Bolivia, Ecuador, 
Argentina, Brazil and Chile prominently electing leaders promising more radical 
anti-neoliberal economic policies, including nationalization of major industries and 
more radical wealth redistribution, while spurning unfettered free trade. Tentatively 
termed ‘post-neoliberalism’, this emerging variant of socialism has embraced new 
issues like environmental protection, indigenous rights and women’s rights, whilst 
generally steering clear of Marxist economic theory or societal reorganization on a 
communist scale.
OTHER IDEOLOGICAL TRADITIONS
Liberalism, conservatism and socialism by no means exhaust the field of ideological 
politics. Other ideological traditions have nevertheless tended to develop either out of 
these core ideologies, or in opposition to them. Where they have drawn to a significant 
extent on liberal, conservative and/or socialist thinking, these other ideologies have a 
cross-cutting character, in that they incorporate elements from multiple ideological 
traditions. While nationalism and multiculturalism are examined in Chapters 6 and 
8 respectively, this chapter considers the following ideologies:
 anarchism
 fascism
 feminism
 green ideology
 religious fundamentalism
 populism.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 48 23-07-2024 12:43:07Political Ideas and Ideologies 49
Anarchism
Although not a mainstream political ideology today, anarchist movements were 
historically powerful in countries such as Spain, France, Russia and Mexico through 
to the twentieth century, and anarchist ideas continue to fertilize political debate 
by challenging the conventional belief that law, government and the state are either 
good or indispensable. Anarchist thinking has also been influential within the 
modern anti-capitalist, or anti-globalization, movement. The central theme within 
anarchism is the belief that political authority in all its forms, and especially in the 
form of the state, is both evil and unnecessary (anarchy literally means ‘without rule’). 
Nevertheless, the anarchist preference for a stateless society in which free individuals 
manage their own affairs through voluntary agreement and cooperation has been 
developed on the basis of two rival traditions: liberal individualism, and socialist 
communitarianism. Anarchism can thus be thought of as a point of intersection 
between liberalism and socialism.
The liberal case against the state is based on individualism, and the desire to 
maximize liberty and choice. Unlike liberals, individualist anarchists such as 
William Godwin (1756–1836) in Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (1793) believed 
that free and rational human beings would be able to manage their affairs peacefully 
and spontaneously, government being merely a form of unwanted coercion. Modern 
individualists have usually looked to the market to explain how society would be 
regulated in the absence of state authority, developing a form of anarcho-capitalism, 
an extreme version of free-market economics.
The more widely recognized anarchist tradition, however, draws on socialist ideas 
such as community, cooperation, equality and common ownership. Collectivist 
anarchists (sometimes called social anarchists) stress the capacity for social solidarity 
that arises from our sociable, gregarious and essentially cooperative natures. On 
this basis, the French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (see p. 429), for instance, 
developed an idealized concept of economic interaction he called mutualism. Other 
anarchists, such as the Russian Peter Kropotkin (1842–1921), advanced a form of 
anarcho-communism, the central principles of which were common ownership, 
decentralization and workers’ self-management. Modern thinkers influenced by 
anarchism include Noam Chomsky (see p. 227) and the American libertarian and 
social ecologist Murray Bookchin (1921–2006).
Fascism
Whereas liberalism, conservatism and socialism are nineteenth-century ideologies, 
fascism is a child of the twentieth century. Some would say that it is specifically an 
interwar phenomenon. Although fascist beliefs can be traced back to the late 1800s, 
they were fused together and shaped by the First World War and its aftermath, and 
by the potent mixture of war and revolution that characterized the interwar period. 
The two principal manifestations of fascism were the regimes of Benito Mussolini 
in Italy from 1922 to 1943, and Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945. 
Forms of neofascism and neo-Nazism have also resurfaced in recent decades, taking 
advantage of the combination of economic crisis and political instability that often 
followed the collapse of communism or, more widely, of increased anxieties over 
Anarcho-capitalism: An 
anarchist tradition which 
holds that unregulated 
market competition can 
and should be applied to 
all social arrangements, 
making the state 
unnecessary.
Mutualism: A system 
of fair and equitable 
exchange, in which 
individuals or groups 
trade goods and services 
with one another 
without profiteering or 
exploitation.
Anarcho-communism:
An anarchist tradition 
which takes common 
ownership to be the 
sole reliable basis for 
social solidarity, thereby 
linking statelessness to 
classlessness.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 49 23-07-2024 12:43:0750 POLITICS
immigration and multiculturalism. In this sense, fascism bears some stylistic and 
situational similarities to populism (see p. 56); however, true fascism is a far more 
extreme and ideologically driven programme.
In many respects, fascism constituted a revolt against the ideas and values that had 
dominated Western political thought since the French Revolution: in the words 
of the Italian Fascist slogan, ‘1789 is dead’. Values such as rationalism, progress, 
freedom and equality were thus overturned in the name of struggle, leadership, 
power, heroism and war. In this sense, fascism is defined largely by what it opposes: 
it is a form of anti-capitalism, anti-liberalism, anti-individualism, anti-communism 
and so on. A core theme that runs throughout fascism is the image of an organically 
unified national community. This is reflected in a belief in ‘strength through unity’. 
The individual, in a literal sense, is nothing; individual identity must be absorbed 
entirely into that of the community or social group.
The fascist ideal is that of the ‘new man’, a hero, motivated by duty, honour and self￾sacrifice, prepared to dedicate his life to the glory of his nation or race. Fascism is 
unusual and extreme amongst political ideologies in that it openly endorses violence 
as necessary and even desirable to achieve its aims. Fascism endorses the concept 
of social Darwinism, which sees nations and races as part of the same processes of 
natural selection that natural world is. For fascists, ‘survival of the fittest’ requires 
emphasis on youth, strength and vitality, while any perceived weakness or impurity 
in society must be expunged. By the same token, certain gifted individuals are ‘born 
to rule’ in society, and thus fascism places no faith in democracy, openly endorsing 
authoritarian rule under a single, all-powerful leader whose singular brilliance can 
lead the movement to victory.
Not all fascists, however, think alike. Italian Fascism was essentially an extreme 
form of statism (see p. 77) that was based on unquestioning respect and absolute 
loyalty towards the state. As the Fascist philosopher Giovanni Gentile (1875–1944) 
put it, ‘everything for the state; nothing against the state; nothing outside the state’. 
German National Socialism (or Nazism), on the other hand, was constructed 
largely on the basis of racialism (see p. 154). Its two core theories were Aryanism 
(the belief that the German people constitute a ‘master race’ and are destined 
for world domination), and a virulent form of anti-Semitism that portrayed the 
Jews as inherently evil and aimed at their eradication. Nazi Germany was an all￾encompassing totalitarian (see p. 78) and militaristic regime which sought to shape 
and control every aspect of the society the lives of its citizens.
Feminism
Although feminist aspirations have been expressed in societies dating back to 
Ancient China, they were not underpinned by a developed political theory until the 
publication of Mary Wollstonecraft’s (see p. 51) A Vindication of the Rights of Women
(1792). Indeed, it was not until the emergence of the women’s suffrage movement 
in the mid-eighteenth century that feminist ideas reached a wider audience, in the 
form of so-called ‘first-wave feminism’. The achievement of female suffrage in most 
Western countries in the early twentieth century deprived the women’s movement of 
its central goal and organizing principle. ‘Second-wave feminism’, however, emerged 
Social Darwinism:
The application of the 
evolutionary theories of 
Charles Darwin to human 
society, suggesting that

in the 1960s. This expressed the more radical, and sometimes revolutionary, demands 
of the growing Women’s Liberation Movement. Feminist theories and doctrines are 
diverse, but their unifying feature is a common desire to enhance, through whatever 
means, the social role of women. The underlying themes of feminism are therefore, 
first, that society is characterized by sexual or gender inequality and, second, that this 
structure of male power can, and should, be overturned.
Feminist thinking has traditionally been analysed in terms of a division between 
liberal, socialist and radical schools of thought. Liberal feminists, such as 
Wollstonecraft and Betty Friedan (see p. 317), have tended to understand female 
subordination in terms of the unequal distribution of rights and opportunities in 
society. This ‘equal-rights feminism’ is essentially reformist. It is concerned more 
with the reform of the public sphere; that is, with enhancing the legal and political 
status of women, and improving their educational and career prospects, than with 
reordering private or domestic life. In contrast, socialist feminists typically highlight 
the links between female subordination and the capitalist mode of production, 
drawing attention to the economic significance of women being confined to a family 
or domestic life where they, for example, relieve male workers of the burden of 
domestic labour, rear and help to educate the next generation of capitalist workers 
and act as a reserve army of labour.
Liberal feminism: A 
feminist tradition whose 
core goal is equal access 
for women and men to 
the public realm, based 
on a belief of genderless 
personhood.
Socialist feminism: A 
feminist tradition that 
seeks to restructure 
economic life to achieve 
gender equality, based in 
links between patriarchy 
and capitalism.
KEY THINKER
MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT (1759–97)
UK social theorist and feminist. Deeply influenced by the democratic radicalism of Rousseau, 
Wollstonecraft developed the first systematic feminist critique some fifty years before the 
emergence of the female suffrage movement. Her most important work, A Vindication of the 
Rights of Women (1792), was influenced by John Locke’s liberalism, and it stressed the equal 
rights of women, especially the right to education, on the basis of the notion of ‘personhood’. 
However, the work developed a more complex analysis of womanhood itself that is relevant to 
the concerns of contemporary feminism.

However, the distinctive flavour of second-wave feminism results mainly from the 
emergence of a feminist critique that is not rooted in conventional political doctrines; 
namely, radical feminism. Radical feminists believe that gender divisions are the 
most fundamental and politically significant cleavages in society. In their view, all 
societies, historical and contemporary, are characterized by patriarchy (see p. 72),
the institution whereby, as Kate Millett (1970) put it, ‘that half of the population 
which is female is controlled by that half which is male’. Radical feminists therefore 
proclaim the need for a sexual revolution, a revolution that will restructure personal, 
domestic and family life. The characteristic slogan of radical feminism is thus ‘the 
Radical feminism: A 
feminist tradition that 
aims to overthrow 
patriarchy through a 
radical transformation 
of all spheres of life, but 
especially ‘the personal’.

personal is the political’. Only in its extreme form, however, does radical feminism 
portray men as ‘the enemy’, and proclaim the need for women to withdraw from 
male society.
However, since the 1970s, feminism has, in many ways, moved beyond the threefold 
division into liberal, socialist and radical traditions. Although ‘new feminism’ or 
‘third-wave feminism’ are disparate, they tend to be characterized by doubts about 
the conventional goal of gender equality, placing an emphasis instead on differences, 
both between women and men and between women themselves. More recent 
developments in feminism are discussed in Chapter 8, in connection with gender 
and identity.
KEY IDEAS
FEMINISM
 Sex and gender: Feminists have traditionally drawn a sharp distinction between sex and gender. Sex, in this sense, 
refers to differences between females and males that are biologically based and therefore ‘natural’. The most important 
sex differences are those that are linked to reproduction. ‘Gender’, on the other hand, is a cultural term, and refers to 
the different roles society ascribes to women and men. Gender differences are typically imposed through contrasting 
stereotypes of masculinity and femininity. The central purpose of the sex/gender distinction is to counter the idea that 
‘biology is destiny’, in the sense that a woman’s physical make-up suits her to a subordinate and domestic role in society.
 Patriarchy: The concept of patriarchy is used within feminism to describe the power relationship between women and 
men. The term literally means ‘rule by the father’. Some feminists employ patriarchy only in this specific and limited 
sense, to describe the structure of the family and the dominance of the husband/father within it. However, feminists 
believe that the dominance of the father within the family symbolizes male supremacy in all other institutions. Many 
would argue, moreover, that the patriarchal family lies at the heart of a systematic process of male domination, in that 
it reproduces male dominance in all other walks of life.
 The personal is the political: Feminists have typically challenged the conventional belief that ‘politics’ is an activity 
that is confined to the affairs of government and other public bodies. Instead, they insist that politics takes place within 
all social groups. Politics exists whenever and wherever conflict is found. Radical feminists have been the keenest 
opponents of the idea that politics stops at the front door. Since, in their view, gender divisions are the deepest and 
most abiding divisions in society, the political process originates in the family itself, and specifically in the process of 
conditioning that structures gender relations in all other arenas.
 Gender equality: Feminism is often characterized as a movement for the achievement of gender equality. However, 
feminists have embraced contrasting notions of equality. Liberal feminists, for instance, have championed legal and 
political equality with men. They have supported an equal rights agenda which would enable women to compete in 
public life on equal terms with men, regardless of sex. Equality thus means equal access to the public realm. Socialist 
feminists, in contrast, argue that equal rights may be meaningless unless women also enjoy equality in terms of 
economic power. Radical feminists, for their part, are primarily concerned about equality in family and personal life.
 The politics of difference: A key fault-line within feminism is between those feminists who favour equality and those 
who instead embrace the idea of difference. The latter position is usually based on the essentialist assumption that 
women and men are fundamentally different at a psycho-biological level. The aggressive and competitive nature of men 
and the creative and empathetic character of women therefore reflect deeper hormonal and other genetic differences, 
rather than the structure of society. Women should recognize and celebrate the distinctive characteristics of the 
female sex; they should seek liberation through difference, as developed and fulfilled women, not as sexless persons.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 52 23-07-2024 12:43:07Political Ideas and Ideologies 53
Green ideology
Although green ideology, or ecologism, is usually seen as a new ideology that is 
linked to the emergence of the environmental movement since the late twentieth 
century, its roots can be traced back to earlier revolts against industrialization. 
Green ideology reflects concern about the damage done to the natural world by the 
increasing pace of economic development and the advent of phenomena like global 
warming, biodiversity loss, genetic engineering, nuclear technology and so on. It 
expresses anxiety about the declining quality of human existence and, ultimately, the 
survival of the human species. Such concerns are sometimes expressed through the 
vehicle of conventional ideologies. For instance, ecosocialism explains environmental 
destruction in terms of capitalism’s rapacious desire for profit. Ecoconservatism links 
the cause of conservation to the desire to preserve traditional values and established 
institutions. And ecofeminism locates the origins of the ecological crisis in the system 
of male power, reflecting the fact that men are less sensitive than women to natural 
processes and the natural world.
However, what gives green ideology its radical edge is the fact that it offers an alternative 
to the anthropocentric, or human-centred, stance adopted by all other ideologies; it 
does not see the natural world simply as a resource available to satisfy human needs. 
By highlighting the importance of ecology, green ideology develops an eco-centric 
worldview that portrays the human species as merely part of nature. One of the most 
influential theories in this field is the Gaia hypothesis, advanced by James Lovelock 
(1979, 2002). This portrays the planet Earth as a living organism that is primarily 
concerned with its own survival. Others have expressed sympathy for such radical 
holism by drawing on the ideas of Eastern religions that emphasize the oneness of life, 
such as Taoism and Zen Buddhism (Capra 1983). ‘Shallow’ or humanist ecologists, 
such as those in some environmental pressure groups, believe that an appeal to self￾interest and common sense will persuade humankind to adopt ecologically sound 
policies and lifestyles, usually in line with the principle of sustainable development. 
‘Deep’ ecologists, on the other hand, insist that nothing short of a fundamental 
reordering of political priorities, the restructuring of human society, and a willingness 
to place the interests of the ecosystem before those of any individual species, will 
ultimately secure planetary and human survival (Bookchin 1989).
Since the 1970s, green parties and movements have grown and become viable 
electoral forces internationally, particularly in Europe. Green ideology has evolved 
to embrace values beyond environmentalism – grassroots democracy, social justice 
and non-violent pacifism are the most common, placing most green parties on the 
left, and sometimes further to the left than traditional social-democratic parties. 
These new values have become increasingly relevant in defining the ‘green’ agenda, 
particularly as environmentalism is embraced by traditional political parties.
Religious fundamentalism
Religion has been an inseparable part of politics for millennia, and religious precepts 
played a significant role in most premodern political thinking. Conservatism, with 
its emphasis on traditional social values and structures, often inherently embraces 
religious concerns as well.
CONCEPT
Ecologism
Ecology is the study of 
the relationship between 
living organisms and their 
environment. It thus 
draws attention to the 
network of relationships 
that sustain all forms 
of life. Ecologism is a 
political doctrine that 
is constructed on the 
basis of ecological 
assumptions, notably 
about the essential link 
between humankind 
and the natural world: 
humans are part of 
nature, not its ‘masters’. 
Ecologism is sometimes 
distinguished from 
environmentalism, 
in that the former 
implies the adoption 
of a biocentric 
perspective, while the 
latter is concerned 
with protecting nature, 
ultimately for human 
benefit.
Anthropocentrism:
The belief that human 
needs and interests are 
of overriding moral and 
philosophical importance; 
the opposite of 
ecocentrism.
Holism: The belief 
that the whole is 
more important than 
its parts, implying 
that understanding is 
gained only by studying 
relationships among its 
parts.

KEY IDEAS
GREEN IDEOLOGY
 Ecology: The central principle of all forms of green ideology is ecology. Ecology conflicts dramatically with the notion 
of humankind as ‘the master of nature’ and instead suggests that a delicate network of interrelationships that had 
hitherto been ignored sustains each human community, indeed the entire human species. Green thinkers argue that 
humankind currently faces the prospect of environmental disaster precisely because, in its passionate but blinkered 
pursuit of material wealth, it has upset the balance of nature, endangering the very ecosystems that make human life 
possible.
 Shallow and deep ecology: The most important distinction in green ideology is between what are termed ‘shallow’ 
ecology and ‘deep’ ecology. Shallow ecology is a green ideological perspective that harnesses the lessons of ecology 
to human needs and ends, and is associated with values such as sustainability and conservation. Deep ecology, in 
contrast, rejects anthropocentrism, or human-centredness, and gives priority to the maintenance of nature; it is 
associated with values such as biocentric equality, diversity and decentralization.
 Holism: Green thinkers have been attracted to the idea of holism as an alternative to the reductionist or mechanistic 
scientific theories that have sustained the delusion that the natural world is merely a resource available to satisfy 
human needs. Holism is the belief that the whole is more important than its parts. It implies that understanding is 
gained by studying relationships among the parts of a larger entity, rather than by treating the parts as entities in their 
own right. In their search for new paradigms of holistic thinking, green theorists have looked, variously, to quantum 
mechanics, non-Western religions and the Gaia hypothesis.
 Sustainability: Green thinkers who subscribe to shallow ecological perspectives typically argue that humankind 
will only survive and prosper if it recognizes that it is merely one element of a complex biosphere, and that only a 
healthy, balanced biosphere will sustain human life. Policies and actions must therefore be judged by the principle 
of ‘sustainability’, the capacity of a system to maintain its health and continue in existence over time. Sustainability 
sets clear limits on human ambitions and material dreams because it requires that production does as little damage as 
possible to the fragile global ecosystem.
 Rejection of conventional ethics: Green ideology is concerned with extending moral thinking in several directions. 
This is because conventional ethical systems are clearly anthropocentric, orientated around the pleasure, needs and 
interests of human beings. In such philosophies, the non-human world is invested with value only to the extent that it 
satisfies human needs. In sharp contrast, deep ecologists suggest that nature has intrinsic value in its own right. From 
this perspective, environmental ethics have nothing to do with human instrumentality, and cannot be articulated 
through the extension of human values to the non-human world.
 Postmaterialism: Green thinkers have advanced a critique of materialism and consumerism that emphasizes their 
negative implications for both resource depletion and personal well-being. As a priority, humankind must therefore 
liberate itself from a ‘having’ attitude of mind. Green thinkers have often advocated a shift in emphasis from ‘having’ 
to ‘being’. ‘Being’ represents satisfaction that is derived from experience and sharing, leading to personal growth 
and even spiritual awareness. The key feature of ‘being’ as an attitude of mind is that it seeks to transcend the self, 
or individual ego, and to recognize that each person is intrinsically linked to all other things, and, indeed, to the 
universe itself.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 54 23-07-2024 12:43:07Political Ideas and Ideologies 55
Fundamentalism though refers to a particular fusion of political and religious 
ideology that has grown into a major force over the last half-century. Its most 
politically significant form has been Islamic fundamentalism, sometimes called 
Islamism (see p. 213). Often associated with the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, 
Islamic fundamentalism has been evident throughout the Middle East and parts 
of north Africa and Asia. However, forms of Christian fundamentalism, Hindu 
fundamentalism, Jewish fundamentalism, Sikh fundamentalism and even Buddhist 
fundamentalism have also emerged. It is difficult to generalize about the causes of this 
fundamentalist upsurge, because in different parts of the world it has taken different 
doctrinal forms and displayed different ideological features. It is nevertheless clear 
that fundamentalism arises in deeply troubled societies, particularly societies 
afflicted by an actual or perceived crisis of identity. Among the factors that have 
contributed to such crises since the final decades of the twentieth century have been 
the spread of secularism and the apparent weakening of society’s ‘moral fabric’, 
and the search in postcolonial states for a non-Western and perhaps anti-Western 
political identity.
The core idea of religious fundamentalism is that religion cannot and should not 
be confined to the private sphere; instead, it finds its highest and proper expression 
in the politics of popular mobilization and social regeneration. As Ayatollah 
Khomeini (see p. 213) put it, ‘politics is religion’. This implies that religious values 
and beliefs constitute the organizing principles of public existence, including law, 
social conduct and the economy as well as politics. While some claim that such 
a tendency can be identified in all of the world’s major religions, others argue 
that it is restricted to Islam, Protestant Christianity and possibly Catholicism, 
as only these religious traditions have the capacity to throw up comprehensive 
programmes of political renewal. In the case of Islam, this tendency may be 
particularly pronounced, as Islam has never been just a ‘religion’ as such; rather, 
it is a complete way of life, with instructions on moral, political and economic 
behaviour for both individuals and nations alike. Muslim fundamentalism has 
been the most potent form of political religion in recent decades, playing a major 
role in the politics of the Middle East and North Africa, and in particular the 
formation of fundamentalist regimes, including the Taliban in Afghanistan and 
the Islamic State in parts of Iraq and Syria.
In this light, politics may be more integral to Islam than it is to, say, Christianity, which 
has traditionally relied on the distinction between God and human government to 
separate the holy from the worldly. As Hindu, Sikh, Jewish and Buddhist forms of 
fundamentalism tend to be more narrowly concerned with helping to clarify or 
redefine national or ethnic identity, they are perhaps better classified as examples of 
ethnic nationalism (discussed in Chapter 6).
Populism
Populism is broad term that has been difficult to clearly define and has been variously 
described as an ideology (Mudde 2004), a discursive frame (Aslanidis 2016) and a 
political style (Moffitt 2016) amongst others. Broadly speaking, populist politics is 
anti-establishment – a populist leader is one who rails against the political system 
itself and seeks the broadest base of popular support. The central feature of populism 
Sustainable development: 
‘development that meets 
the needs of the present 
generation without 
compromising the ability 
of future generations to 
meet their own needs’ 
(United Nations 1987).
Secularism: The belief 
that religion should not 
intrude into secular 
(worldly) affairs, usually 
reflected in the desire to 
separate the state from 
institutionalized religion.
CONCEPT
Fundamentalism
Fundamentalism refers 
to a style of thought in 
which certain principles 
are recognized as 
essential ‘truths’ which 
have unchallengeable 
and overriding 
authority. Substantive 
fundamentalisms 
have little or nothing 
in common, except 
that their supporters 
tend to evince an 
earnestness or fervour 
born out of doctrinal 
certainty. Although it 
is usually associated 
with religion and the 
literal truth of sacred 
texts, fundamentalism 
can also be found in 
political creeds. The 
term is controversial 
because it is often used 
pejoratively, to imply 
inflexibility, dogmatism 
and authoritarianism.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 55 23-07-2024 12:43:0856 POLITICS
is the idea that society is divided into two warring groups: the ‘pure’ common people 
and the ‘corrupt’ ruling elite. From the populist perspective, ‘the people’ constitute 
the only source of moral worth in politics, their instincts and wishes providing the 
sole legitimate guide to political action (Mudde 2004).
Some scholars believe that there really is not a populist ideology, rather, there are 
only populists – leaders who attempt to gain power by rallying the crowd against 
the establishment and will use whatever policies or ideas they think are useful 
to achieve this. Another popular way to classify populism is as a ‘thin’ ideology, 
which means that it provides only a partial framework for political thinking and 
action. This is in contrast to ‘thick’ ideologies, like liberalism and socialism, which 
are intellectually deeper and much more comprehensive in scope (Freeden 1996). 
Consequently, populism by itself does not provide a complete political agenda 
and is usually fused with another ideological tradition to do so. Because populism 
transcends the traditional left–right divide in politics, populist movements can be 
found across the political spectrum, and may combine elements from a range of 
ideologies and persuasions in creating a platform. Populism in this sense might 
even be the antithesis of ideology – many populist movements have been critiqued 
for having impractical and incoherent agendas with ideas that implicitly conflict 
with other. Peronism, for example, is a political movement in Argentina begun by 
Juan and Eva Peron, who dominated Argentine politics from the 1940s to the 1970s. 
Peronism is complex and sometimes contradictory blend of nationalism, populism, 
socialism and conservatism, sometimes described as ‘right-wing socialism’.
Although populists are unified in portraying society in terms of a battle between ‘the 
people’ and ‘the elite’, left-wing and right-wing populists usually invest these terms 
with quite different meanings. Left-wing populists typically conceive of the people 
in class terms, and so tend to prioritize socio-economic concerns such as poverty, 
inequality and job insecurity. This form of populism is sometimes called egalitarian 
populism. Right-wing populists, by contrast, typically view the people in narrower 
and often ethnically restricted terms. As their focus is primarily on matters related to 
identity, they tend to prioritize socio-cultural concerns such as immigration, crime 
and corruption. Right-wing populism is sometimes divided into forms that place a 
particular emphasis on the culture and interests of the nation (national populism) 
and forms that primarily stress the imposition of social and moral order, often linked 
to cynicism about individual rights (authoritarian populism).
Populism is as old as politics. In the fifth century bce, the Greek politician Pericles 
gained power in Athens by whipping up the crowds with his lavish promises of 
benefits for the poor and middle classes, whilst sharply criticizing the rich political 
elite and seeking to exclude those without full Athenian parentage from participating 
in city politics. Populist movements have periodically arisen throughout history, 
though they have experienced a particular resurgence in the twenty-first century. 
The period since the early 2000s, and especially since the global financial crisis 
of 2007–9, has sometimes been dubbed the ‘age of populism’, associated with the 
emergence of figures such as Donald Trump (USA), Marine Le Pen (France), Geert 
Wilders (Netherlands), Rafael Correa (Ecuador), Rodrigo Duterte (Philippines) and 
Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil), and movements including Syriza (Greece) and the Five Star 
Movement (Italy) (Eatwell and Goodwin 2018).
CONCEPT
Populism
Populism (from the 
Latin populus, meaning 
‘the people’) has been 
used to describe both 
distinctive political 
movements and a 
particular tradition 
of political thought. 
Movements or parties 
described as populist 
have been characterized 
by their claim to support 
the common people 
in the face of ‘corrupt’ 
economic or political 
elites. As a political 
tradition, populism 
reflects the belief that 
the instincts and wishes 
of the people provide 
the principal legitimate 
guide to political action. 
Populist politicians, 
therefore, make a 
direct appeal to the 
people, and claim to 
give expression to their 
deepest hopes and fears.

Despite being ‘of the people’, populist movements have a marked tendency to focus 
on particular leaders or personalities whose charismatic appeal and rhetoric are 
essential to mobilizing popular support. Populists tend to place a particularly strong 
emphasis on the importance of both acquiring power and maintaining it within a 
political system, but the nature of populism suggests that ends can often justify the 
means to do so, insofar as the elite and establishment are defined as corrupt and 
doing whatever they can to stay in power and prevent ‘the people’ from receiving 
their due. This can give populist movements a revolutionary character, for both good 
and ill. Argentine critical theorist Ernesto Laclau (1935–2014), for instance, saw 
populism as a necessary and important counterweight to the natural domination of 
politics by the elite, and a critical way in which oppressed and marginalized peoples 
could be heard and unseat entrenched socio-economic interests (Laclau 2005). That 
said, how populists define ‘the people’ is often selective and sometimes exclusionary, 
usually seeing only particular ethnic, cultural, religious or socio-economic 
identities as constituting the ‘true’ people. The people are also taken to be strictly 
unified and homogeneous. Populism thus tends to be anti-pluralist in character, 
putting it at odds with liberalism in general and liberal democracy in particular. 
Not only does populism’s image of a society starkly divided into rival homogeneous 
groups – the people and the elite – clash starkly with liberalism’s emphasis on the 
individual, but populism has also been viewed as a cultural backlash against the 
seemingly relentless advance of liberal social values (Norris and Inglehart 2019). 
The ‘corrupt’ elite against which populists rail, and the institutions through which 
they rule, are therefore commonly thought to have an essentially liberal character. 
Populist movements, having taken power, have a marked tendency to take on an 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_2.indd 57 23-07-2024 12:43:0858 POLITICS
authoritarian character, with a many transgressing democratic norms and eroding 
individual rights in the name of empowering the people and defeating a corrupt elite 
(Kyle and Mounk 2018).
Many scholars see populism as a recurring theme of politics, and one that is naturally 
driven by popular frustration with dysfunctional political systems that do not seem to 
serve the public interest (see Chapter 20). Samuel Huntington (see p. 478), amongst 
others, has argued that populism is particularly prone to occur when governments 
and pre-existing parties fail to address rapid or unexpected social and economic 
changes. Socio-political changes like globalization, feminism, de-industrialization 
and multiculturalism have significantly disrupted the status quo in many societies. 
Regardless of whether such changers are for the better or worse, those ‘left behind’ 
by the changes might naturally turn to populist movements and ideas as a way to 
reassert their political voice and restore a previous state of affairs. Whether populist 
movements can deliver on this promise, however, is far more questionable, as by 
itself populism provides limited guidance on how to implement policies and create 
change once power has been won. As such ‘populism often asks the right questions 
but provides the wrong answers’ (Mudde and Kaltwasser 2017).
Yet regardless of whether populism is thought of as an ideology or not, there is no 
denying that it is a recurrent and powerful force in politics that has the power to unify 
people much as any ideology does. Moreover, populist movements highlight the fact 
that politics is not necessarily practised by those who have fully formed ideological 
programmes. While theorists and philosophers may develop the finer points of 
ideology, most politicians and activists operate in a much more fluid ideological 
environment. Many socialists are not experts in Marx, many social liberals have not 
read Rawls, and many neoliberal conservatives will not have read Hayek, and all 
three may have sympathies for or borrow ideas from the others. While ideologies 
as presented here are distinct intellectual traditions, in the maelstrom of everyday 
politics, the lines are far blurrier.

CHAPTER 3
POLITICS AND 
THE STATE
KEY ISSUES
 What is the state, and why does it play such a crucial role in politics?
 How has state power been analysed and explained?
 Is the state a force for good or a force for evil?
 What roles have been assigned to the state? How have responsibilities been apportioned between the 
state and civil society?
 To what extent does politics now operate outside or beyond the state?
PREVIEW
The shadow of the state falls on almost every human activity. From education to economic management, from 
social welfare to sanitation, and from domestic order to external defence, the state shapes and controls. Where it 
does not shape or control it regulates, supervises, authorizes or prohibits. Even those aspects of life usually thought 
of as personal or private (marriage, worship, entertainment, work and so on) are ultimately subject to the authority 
of the state. It is not surprising, therefore, that politics is often understood as the study of the state, the analysis 
of its institutional organizations, the evaluation of its impact on society and so on. Ideological debate and party 
politics, certainly, tend to revolve around the issue of the proper function or role of the state: what should be done 
by the state and what should be left to private individuals and associations?
This chapter examines the features that are usually associated with the state, from both a domestic and an 
international perspective. It considers the issue of the nature of state power, and, in the process, touches on some 
of the deepest and most abiding divisions in political theory. This leads to a discussion of the contrasting roles and 
responsibilities of the state and the different forms that states have assumed. Finally, it looks at whether, in the 
light of globalization and other developments, the state is losing its central importance in politics.

DEFINING THE STATE
Origins and development of the state
The state emerged in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe as a system 
of centralized rule that succeeded in subordinating all other institutions and 
groups, particularly the church, bringing an end to the competing, overlapping 
and personalistic authority systems that had characterized medieval Europe. By 
establishing the principle of territorial sovereignty (see p. 64), the Peace of Westphalia 
(1648), concluded at the end of the Thirty Years War, is often taken to have formalized 
the modern notion of statehood, by establishing the state as the principal actor in 
domestic and international affairs.
There is less agreement, however, about why the state came into existence. 
According to Charles Tilly (1990), for instance, the central factor that explains 
the development of the modern state was its ability to fight wars. In this view, the 
transformation in the scale and nature of military encounters that was brought 
about from the sixteenth century onwards (through, for instance, the introduction 
of gunpowder, the use of organized infantry and artillery, and the advent of 
standing armies) not only greatly increased the coercive power that rulers could 
wield, but also forced states to extend their control over their populations to pay 
for that power, by developing more extensive systems of taxation, conscription 
and administration. As Tilly (1975) thus put it, ‘War made the state, and the state 
made war’. Marxists, in contrast, have explained the emergence of the state largely 
in economic terms, the state’s origins being traced back to the transition from 
feudalism to capitalism, with the state essentially being a tool used by the emerging 
bourgeois class (Engels 1884). Most explanations, however, hinge around the 
growing economic, social and defensive responsibilities of government. Medieval 
‘government’ was basic, often just a network of personal relationships between a 
monarch and his or her nobles that did little more than defend the realm and 
maintain basic order. By the seventeenth century, technological, economic and 
social development required much more organized states of professional civil 
servants and permanent institutions that could build infrastructure, tax citizens, 
fight fires, regulate trade, subsidize industry, maintain fleets and colonies, provide 
justice and fund the arts and sciences. Those demands have only grown in 
subsequent centuries, particularly post-1945, when the modern welfare state saw 
governments taking a more direct role in helping its citizens live fulfilling lives, 
from old-age pensions to public health care.
The seventeenth century also saw the rise of the ‘nation’, in which political 
organization no longer centred on the personal holdings of a ruler, but instead 
around a people with a shared sense of language, culture, ethnicity and/or history. 
Borders were increasingly redrawn to unite common peoples into a single political 
entity – the nation-state. In the twentieth century, demands for self-determination 
and independence saw much of the globe reorganized into nation-states. From 
its original 51 member states in 1945, the UN grew to 127 members by 1970 and 
reached 193 members by 2011 (with the recognition of South Sudan). The state has 
therefore become a near-universal form of political organization around the world.
Nation-state: A sovereign 
political association within 
which citizenship and 
nationality overlap; one 
nation within a single state 
(see also p. 146).
CONCEPT
The state
The state is a political 
association that 
establishes sovereign 
jurisdiction within 
defined territorial 
borders, and exercises 
authority through 
a set of permanent 
institutions. These 
institutions are those 
that are recognizably 
‘public’, in that they 
are responsible for the 
collective organization 
of communal life and 
are funded at the 
public’s expense. The 
state thus embraces the 
various institutions of 
government, but it also 
extends to the courts, 
nationalized industries, 
social-security system 
and so forth.

Approaches to the state
Nevertheless, the term ‘state’ has been used to refer to a bewildering range of things: 
a collection of institutions, a territorial unit, a philosophical idea, an instrument of 
coercion or oppression and so on. This confusion stems, in part, from the fact that the 
state has been understood in four quite different ways: from an idealist perspective, a 
functionalist perspective, an organizational perspective and an international perspective.
The idealist approach to the state is most clearly reflected in the writings of Georg 
Hegel. Hegel identified three ‘moments’ of social existence: the family, civil society 
and the state. Within the family, he argued, a ‘particular altruism’ operates that 
encourages people to set aside their own interests for the good of their children or 
elderly relatives. In contrast, civil society was seen as a sphere of ‘universal egoism’ in 
which individuals place their own interests before those of others. Hegel conceived 
of the state as an ethical community underpinned by mutual sympathy, or ‘universal 
altruism’ (Hegel 1821). The drawback of idealism, however, is that it fosters an 
uncritical reverence for the state and, by defining the state in ethical terms, fails to 
distinguish clearly between institutions that are part of the state and those that are 
outside the state.
Idealism: A view of politics 
that emphasizes the 
importance of morality 
and ideals; philosophical 
idealism implies that ideas 
are more ‘real’ than the 
material world.
Functionalist approaches to the state focus on the role or purpose of state institutions. 
The central function of the state is invariably seen as the maintenance of social order 
(see p. 452), the state being defined as that set of institutions that uphold order and 
deliver social stability. Such an approach has, for example, been adopted by neo￾Marxists (see p. 69), who have been inclined to see the state as a mechanism through 
which class conflict is ameliorated to ensure the long-term survival of the capitalist 
system. The weakness of the functionalist view of the state, however, is that it tends 
to associate any institution that maintains order (such as the family, mass media, 
trade unions and the church) with the state as well, rendering its definition very 
broad. This is why an organizational approach to the definition of the state is adopted 
throughout this book.
KEY THINKER
GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL (1770–1831)
German philosopher. Hegel was the founder of modern idealism and developed the 
notion that consciousness and material objects are, in fact, unified. In Phenomenology of 
Spirit (1807), he sought to develop a rational system that would substitute for traditional 
Christianity by interpreting the entire process of human history, and indeed the universe 
itself, in terms of the progress towards self-realization. In his view, history is, in essence, 
a march of the human spirit towards a determinate endpoint. His major political work, 
Philosophy of Right (1821), portrays the state as an ethical ideal and the highest expression 
of human freedom. Hegel’s work had a considerable impact on Marx and other so-called 
‘young Hegelians’. It also shaped the ideas of liberals such as T. H. Green and influenced

The organizational view defines the state as the apparatus of government in its 
broadest sense; that is, as that set of institutions that are recognizably public, in that 
they are responsible for the collective organization of social existence and are funded 
at the public’s expense. The virtue of this definition is that it distinguishes clearly 
between the state and civil society. The state comprises the various institutions of 
government: the bureaucracy (see p. 409), the military, the police, the courts, the 
social-security system and so on. The organizational approach allows us to talk about 
‘rolling forward’ or ‘rolling back’ the state, in the sense of expanding or contracting 
the responsibilities of the state and enlarging or diminishing its institutional 
machinery.
In this light, it is possible to identify five key features of the state:
 The state is sovereign. It exercises absolute and unrestricted power and stands 
above all other associations and groups in society. Thomas Hobbes (see p. 65)
conveyed the idea of sovereignty (see p. 64) by portraying the state as a ‘leviathan’, 
a gigantic monster, usually represented as a sea creature, with reach into every 
sphere of life.
 State institutions are recognizably ‘public’, in contrast to the ‘private’ institutions 
of civil society. Public bodies are responsible for making and enforcing collective 
decisions, while private bodies, such as families, private businesses and trade 
unions, exist to satisfy individual interests.
 The state is an exercise in legitimation. The decisions of the state are usually 
(although not necessarily) accepted as binding on the members of society because, 
at least in theory, they are made in the public interest, or for the common good. 
Ideally, the state reflects the permanent and long-term interests of society.
 The state is an instrument of domination, as it must have the capacity to ensure 
that its laws are obeyed and that transgressors are punished. For Max Weber (see 
p. 87), the state was defined by its monopoly of the means of ‘legitimate violence’, 
for it is only the state that can legally use coercive power and restrict individual 
liberties to achieve its ends.
 The state is a territorial association. The jurisdiction of the state is geographically 
defined, and it encompasses all those who live within the state’s borders, whether 
they are citizens or non-citizens. On the international stage, the state is therefore 
regarded (at least, in theory) as an autonomous entity.
The international approach to the state views it primarily as an actor on the world 
stage; indeed, as the basic unit of international politics. In this sense, the state 
has two faces, one looking outwards and the other looking inwards. Whereas the 
previous definitions are concerned with the state’s inward-looking face, its relations 
with the individuals and groups that live within its borders and its ability to maintain 
domestic order; the international view deals with the state’s outward-looking face, 
its relations with other states and its ability to defend itself from external threats. 
The classic definition of the state in international law is found in the Montevideo 
Convention on the Rights and Duties of the State (1933). According to Article 1 of 
the Montevideo Convention, the state has four features: 1) a defined territory, 2) 
Civil society: A private 
sphere of autonomous 
groups and associations, 
independent from state or 
public authority (see p. 4).
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 63 23-07-2024 12:40:5464 POLITICS
a permanent population, 3) an effective government and 4) a capacity to enter into 
relations with other states.
This approach to the state brings it very close to the notion of a ‘country’. The 
main difference between how the state is understood by political philosophers and 
sociologists, and how it is understood by international relations scholars is that, 
while the former treat civil society as separate from the state, the latter treat civil 
society as part of the state, in that it encompasses not only an effective government 
but also a permanent population. For some, the international approach views 
the state essentially as a legal person, in which case statehood depends on formal 
recognition by other states or international bodies. In this view, the United Nations 
is widely accepted as the body that, by granting full membership, determines when 
a new state has come into existence.
DEBATING THE STATE
Rival theories of the state
What is the nature of state power, and whose interests does the state represent? 
From this perspective, the state is an essentially contested concept. There are 
various rival theories of the state, each of which offers a different account of its 
origins, development and impact on society. Indeed, controversy about the nature 
of state power has increasingly dominated modern political analysis and goes to the 
heart of ideological and theoretical disagreements in the discipline. These relate to 
questions about whether, for example, the state is autonomous and independent of 
society, or whether it is essentially a product of society and a reflection of the broader 
distribution of power or resources. Moreover, does the state serve the common or 
collective good, or is it biased in favour of privileged groups or a dominant class? 
Similarly, is the state a positive or constructive force, with responsibilities that should 
be enlarged, or is it a negative or destructive entity that must be constrained or, 
perhaps, smashed altogether? Four contrasting theories of the state, which we will 
examine in this chapter, can be identified as follows:
 the pluralist state
 the capitalist state
 the leviathan state
 the patriarchal state.
The pluralist state
The pluralist theory of the state has a very clear liberal lineage. It stems from the 
belief that the state’s principal role is to impartially enforce rules and maintain 
order in a diverse society of autonomous individuals. This view has also dominated 
mainstream political analysis, accounting for a tendency, at least within Anglo￾American thought, to discount the state and state organizations and focus instead 
on ‘government’. Indeed, it is not uncommon in this tradition for ‘the state’ to be 
dismissed as an abstraction, with institutions such as the courts, the civil service and 
CONCEPT
Sovereignty
Sovereignty, in its 
simplest sense, is the 
principle of absolute 
and unlimited power. 
However, sovereignty 
can be understood in 
different ways. Legal 
sovereignty refers to 
supreme legal authority, 
defined in terms of 
the ‘right’ to command 
compliance, while 
political sovereignty 
refers to absolute 
political power, defined 
in terms of the ‘ability’ to 
command compliance. 
Internal sovereignty is 
the notion of supreme 
power/authority 
within the state (for 
example, parliamentary 
sovereignty: see p. 326).
External sovereignty 
relates to a state’s place 
in the international order 
and its capacity to act 
as an independent and 
autonomous entity.
Pluralism: A belief in, 
or commitment to, 
diversity or multiplicity; 
or the belief that power in 
modern societies is widely 
and evenly distributed.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 64 23-07-2024 12:40:54POLITICS AND THE STATE 65
the military being seen as independent actors, rather than as elements of a broader 
entity. Nevertheless, this approach is possible only because it is based on underlying, 
and often unacknowledged, assumptions about state neutrality. The state can be 
ignored only because it is seen as an impartial arbiter or referee that can be bent to 
the will of the government of the day.
The origins of this view of the state can be traced back to the social-contract theories 
(see p. 66) of thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau (see p. 105), Thomas Hobbes 
and John Locke (see p. 32). The principal concern of such thinkers was to examine 
the grounds of political obligation, the grounds on which the individual is obliged 
to obey and respect the state. They argued that the state had arisen out of a voluntary 
agreement, or ‘social contract’ (see p. 66), made by individuals who recognized 
that only the establishment of a sovereign power could safeguard them from the 
insecurity, disorder and brutality of the state of nature. Without a state, individuals 
abuse, exploit and enslave one another; with a state, order and civilized existence are 
guaranteed and liberty is protected. As Locke put it, ‘where there is no law there is 
no freedom’.
Political obligation: The 
duty of the citizen towards 
the state and the basis of 
the state’s right to rule.
State of nature: A 
society devoid of political 
authority and of formal 
checks on the individual; 
usually employed as a 
theoretical device.
KEY THINKER
THOMAS HOBBES (1588–1679)
English political philosopher. Hobbes was the son of a minor clergyman who subsequently 
abandoned his family. He became tutor to the exiled Prince of Wales Charles Stuart and lived 
under the patronage of the Cavendish family. Writing at a time of uncertainty and civil strife, 
precipitated by the English Revolution, Hobbes developed a comprehensive theory of nature 
and human behaviour. His classic work, Leviathan (1651), discussed the grounds of political 
obligation and undoubtedly reflected the impact of the English Civil War. It provided a defence 
for absolutist government but, by appealing to reasoned argument in the form of the social 
contract, also disappointed advocates of the divine right of rulers.

In liberal theory, the state is thus seen as a neutral arbiter amongst the competing 
groups and individuals in society; it is a ‘referee’ that can protect each citizen from 
the encroachments of fellow citizens. The neutrality of the state reflects the fact that 
the state acts in the interests of all citizens, and therefore represents the common 
good or public interest. In Hobbes’ view, stability and order could be secured only 
through the establishment of an absolute and unlimited state, with power that 
could be neither challenged nor questioned. In other words, he held that citizens 
are confronted by a stark choice between absolutism (see p. *) and anarchy. Locke, 
on the other hand, developed a more typically liberal defence of the limited state. 
In his view, the purpose of the state is very specific: it is restricted to the defence 
of a set of ‘natural’ or God-given individual rights; namely, ‘life, liberty and 
Anarchy: Literally, 
‘without rule’; anarchy is 
often used pejoratively to 
suggest instability, or even 
chaos.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 65 23-07-2024 12:40:5466 POLITICS
property’. This establishes a clear distinction between the responsibilities of the state 
(essentially, the maintenance of domestic order and the protection of property) and 
the responsibilities of individual citizens (usually seen as the realm of civil society). 
Moreover, since the state may threaten natural rights as easily as it may uphold them, 
citizens must enjoy some form of protection against the state, which Locke believed 
could be delivered only through the mechanisms of constitutional and representative 
government.
These ideas were developed in the twentieth century into the pluralist theory of 
the state. As a theory of society, pluralism asserts that, within liberal democracies, 
power is widely and evenly dispersed. As a theory of the state, pluralism holds that 
the state is neutral, insofar as it is susceptible to the influence of various groups and 
interests, and all social classes. The state is not biased in favour of any particular 
interest or group, and it does not have an interest of its own that is separate from 
those of society. As John Schwarzmantel (1994) put it, the state is ‘the servant of 
society and not its master’. Two key assumptions underlie this view. The first is that 
the state is effectively subordinate to government. Non-elected state bodies (the 
civil service, the judiciary, the police, the military and so on) are strictly impartial 
and are subject to the authority of their political masters. The state apparatus is, 
therefore, thought to conform to the principles of public service and political 
accountability. The second assumption is that the democratic process is meaningful 
and effective. In other words, party competition and interest-group activity ensure 
that the government of the day remains sensitive and responsive to public opinion. 
Ultimately then, the state is only a weathervane that is blown in whichever direction 
the public dictates.
FOCUS ON . . . 
SOCIAL-CONTRACT THEORY
A social contract is a voluntary agreement made amongst individuals through which an organized 
society, or state, is brought into existence. Used as a theoretical device by thinkers such as 
Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau (see p. 105), the social contract has been revived by modern 
theorists such as John Rawls (see p. 35). The social contract is seldom regarded as a historical 
act. Rather, it is used as a means of demonstrating the value of government and the grounds of 
political obligation; social-contract theorists wish individuals to act as if they had concluded the 
contract themselves. In its classic form, social-contract theory has three elements:
 The image of a hypothetical stateless society (or ‘state of nature’) is established. 
Unconstrained freedom means anarchy, and that for most life, is ‘solitary, poor, nasty, 
brutish and short’ (Hobbes 1651).
 Individuals therefore seek to escape from this state of nature by entering into a social 
contract, recognizing that only a sovereign power can secure order and stability.
 The social contract obliges citizens to respect and obey the state, ultimately in gratitude 
for the stability and security that only a system of political rule can deliver.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 66 23-07-2024 12:40:54POLITICS AND THE STATE 67
Modern pluralists, however, have often adopted a more critical view of the state, 
termed the neopluralist theory of the state. Theorists such as Robert Dahl (see p. 303)
and J. K. Galbraith (see p. 195) have come to accept that modern industrialized 
states are both more complex and less responsive to popular pressures than classical 
pluralism suggested. Neopluralists, for instance, have acknowledged that business 
enjoys a ‘privileged position’ in relation to government that other groups clearly 
cannot rival. In Politics and Markets (1980), Charles Lindblom pointed out that, as 
the major investor and largest employer in society, business is bound to exercise 
considerable sway over any government, whatever its ideological leanings or 
manifesto commitments. Moreover, neopluralists have accepted that the state can, 
and does, forge its own sectional interests. In this way, a state elite, composed of 
senior civil servants, judges, police chiefs, military leaders and so on, may be seen 
to pursue either the bureaucratic interests of their sector of the state, or the interests 
of client groups. Indeed, if the state is regarded as a political actor in its own right, it 
can be viewed as a powerful (perhaps the most powerful) interest group in society.
The capitalist state
The Marxist notion of a capitalist state offers a clear alternative to the pluralist image 
of the state as a neutral arbiter or umpire. Marxists have typically argued that the 
state cannot be understood separately from the economic structure of society and 
thus that it is an instrument of class oppression: the state emerges out of, and in a 
sense reflects, the class system. Nevertheless, a rich debate has taken place in recent 
years that has moved the Marxist theory of the state a long way from this classic 
formulation. In many ways, the scope to revise Marxist attitudes towards the state 
stems from ambiguities that can be found in Marx’s (see p. 43) own writings.
Marx did not develop a systematic or coherent theory of the state. In a general 
sense, he believed that the state is part of a ‘superstructure’ that is determined or 
conditioned by the economic ‘base’, which can be seen as the real foundation of social 
life. However, the precise relationship between the base and the superstructure, and 
in this case that between the state and the capitalist mode of production, is unclear.
Two theories of the state can be identified in Marx’s writings. The first is expressed 
in his often-quoted dictum from The Communist Manifesto (1848): ‘The executive 
of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the 
whole bourgeoisie’. From this perspective, the state is clearly dependent on society 
and entirely dependent on its economically dominant class, which in capitalism is 
the bourgeoisie. Lenin (see p. 107) thus described the state starkly as ‘an instrument 
for the oppression of the exploited class’.
A second, more complex and subtle, theory of the state can nevertheless be found 
in Marx’s analysis of the revolutionary events in France between 1848 and 1851, 
The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852). Marx suggested that the state 
could enjoy what has come to be seen as ‘relative autonomy’ from the class system, 
the Napoleonic state being capable of imposing its will upon society, acting as an 
‘appalling parasitic body’. If the state did articulate the interests of any class, it was 
not those of the bourgeoisie, but those of the most populous class in French society, 
the smallholding peasantry. Although Marx did not develop this view in detail, from 
CONCEPT
Neopluralism
Neopluralism is a style 
of social theorizing 
that remains faithful 
to pluralist values while 
recognizing the need 
to revise or update 
classical pluralism in the 
light of, for example, 
elite, Marxist and 
New Right theories. 
Although neopluralism 
embraces a broad 
range of perspectives 
and positions, certain 
central themes can 
be identified. First, 
it takes account of 
modernizing trends, 
such as the emergence 
of postindustrial 
society. Second, while 
capitalism is preferred to 
socialism, free-market 
economic doctrines 
are usually regarded 
as obsolete. Third, 
Western democracies 
are seen as ‘deformed 
polyarchies’, in which 
major corporations 
exert disproportionate 
influence.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 67 23-07-2024 12:40:5468 POLITICS
this perspective the autonomy of the state is only relative, in that the state appears 
to mediate between conflicting classes, and so maintains the class system itself in 
existence.
Both these theories differ markedly from the liberal and, later, pluralist models of 
state power. In particular, they emphasize that the state cannot be understood except 
in a context of unequal class power, and that the state arises out of, and reflects, 
capitalist society, by acting either as an instrument of oppression wielded by the 
dominant class, or, more subtly, as a mechanism through which class antagonisms 
are ameliorated. Nevertheless, Marx’s attitude towards the state was not entirely 
negative. He argued that the state could be used constructively during the transition 
from capitalism to communism in the form of the ‘revolutionary dictatorship of the 
proletariat’. The overthrow of capitalism would see the destruction of the bourgeois 
state and the creation of an alternative, proletarian one.
In describing the state as a proletarian ‘dictatorship’, Marx utilized the first theory of 
the state, seeing the state as an instrument through which the economically dominant 
class (by then, the proletariat) could repress and subdue other classes. All states, 
from this perspective, are class dictatorships. The ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ was 
seen as a means of safeguarding the gains of the revolution by preventing counter￾revolution mounted by the dispossessed bourgeoisie. Nevertheless, Marx did not 
see the state as a necessary or enduring social formation. He predicted that, as class 
antagonisms faded, the state would ‘wither away’, meaning that a fully communist 
society would also be stateless. Since the state emerged out of the class system, 
once the class system has been abolished, the state, quite simply, loses its reason for 
existence.
Marx’s ambivalent heritage has provided modern Marxists, or neo-Marxists, with 
considerable scope to further the analysis of state power. This was also encouraged 
by the writings of Antonio Gramsci (see p. 219), who emphasized the degree to 
which the domination of the ruling class is achieved by ideological manipulation, 
rather than just open coercion. In this view, bourgeois domination is maintained 
largely through ‘hegemony’ (see p. 218): that is, intellectual leadership or cultural 
control, with the state playing an important role in the process.
Since the 1960s, Marxist theorizing about the state has been dominated by rival 
instrumentalist and structuralist views of the state. In The State in Capitalist Society
(1969), Ralph Miliband portrayed the state as an instrument of the ruling class, 
stressing the extent to which the state elite is disproportionately drawn from the 
ranks of the privileged and propertied. The bias of the state in favour of capitalism 
is therefore derived from the overlap of social backgrounds between, on the one 
hand, civil servants and other public officials, and, on the other, bankers, business 
leaders and captains of industry. Nicos Poulantzas, in Political Power and Social 
Classes (1968), dismissed this sociological approach, and emphasized instead the 
degree to which the structure of economic and social power exerts a constraint on 
state autonomy. This view suggests that the state cannot but act to perpetuate the 
social system in which it operates. In the case of the capitalist state, its role is to serve 
the long-term interests of capitalism, even though these actions may be resisted by 
sections of the capitalist class itself. Neo-Marxists have increasingly seen the state as 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 68 23-07-2024 12:40:54POLITICS AND THE STATE 69
the terrain on which the struggle amongst interests, groups and classes is conducted. 
Rather than being an instrument wielded by a dominant group or ruling class, the 
state is thus a dynamic entity that reflects the balance of power within society at any 
given time, and the ongoing struggle for hegemony.
The leviathan state
The image of the state as a ‘leviathan’ (in effect, a self-serving monster intent on 
expansion and aggrandizement) is one associated in modern politics with the New 
Right. Such a view is rooted in early or classical liberalism and a commitment to a 
radical form of individualism (see p. 197). The New Right, or at least its neoliberal 
wing, is distinguished by a strong antipathy towards state intervention in economic 
and social life, born out of the belief that the state is a parasitic growth that threatens 
both individual liberty and economic security. In this view, the state, instead of being, 
as pluralists suggest, an impartial umpire or arbiter, is an overbearing ‘nanny’, desperate 
to interfere or meddle in every aspect of human existence. The central feature of 
this view is that the state pursues interests that are separate from those of society 
(setting it apart from Marxism), and that those interests demand an unrelenting 
growth in the role or responsibilities of the state itself. New Right thinkers therefore 
argue that the twentieth-century tendency towards state intervention reflected not 
popular pressure for economic and social security, or the need to stabilize capitalism 
by ameliorating class tensions but, rather, the internal dynamics of the state.
New Right theorists explain the expansionist dynamics of state power by reference to 
both demand-side and supply-side pressures. Demand-side pressures are those that 
emanate from society itself, usually through the mechanism of electoral democracy. 
The New Right argues that electoral competition encourages politicians to ‘outbid’ one 
another by making promises of increased spending and more generous government 
programmes, regardless of the long-term damage that such policies inflict on the 
economy in the form of increased taxes, higher inflation and the ‘crowding out’ of 
investment. Supply-side pressures, on the other hand, are those that are internal to 
the state. These can therefore be explained in terms of the institutions and personnel 
of the state apparatus. In its most influential form, this argument is known as the 
‘government oversupply thesis’.
The oversupply thesis has usually been associated with public-choice theory 
(see p. 306), which examines how public decisions are made based on the assumption 
that the individuals involved act in a rationally self-interested fashion. For example, 
William Niskanen in Bureaucracy and Representative Government (1971) argued 
that as budgetary control in legislatures such as the US Congress is typically weak, 
the task of budget-making is shaped largely by the interests of government agencies 
and senior bureaucrats. Insofar as this implies that government is dominated by the 
state (the state elite being able to shape the thinking of elected politicians), there are 
parallels between the public-choice model and the Marxist view discussed above. 
Where these two views diverge, however, is in relation to the interests that the state 
apparatus serves. While Marxists argue that the state reflects broader class and other 
social interests, the New Right portrays the state as an independent or autonomous 
entity that pursues its own interests. In this view, bureaucratic self-interest invariably

Neo-Marxism
Neo-Marxism 
(sometimes termed 
‘modern’ or ‘Western’ 
Marxism) refers to 
attempts to revise or 
recast the classical ideas 
of Marx while remaining 
faithful to certain 
Marxist principles or 
aspects of Marxist 
methodology. Neo￾Marxists typically refuse 
to accept that Marxism 
enjoys a monopoly of 
the truth, and have 
thus looked to Hegelian 
philosophy, anarchism, 
liberalism, feminism and 
even rational-choice 
theory. Although still 
concerned about social 
injustice, neo-Marxists 
reject the primacy of 
economics over other 
factors and, with it, the 
notion that history has a 
predictable character.

supports ‘big’ government and state intervention, because this leads to an enlargement 
of the bureaucracy itself, which helps to ensure job security, improve pay, create 
promotion prospects and enhance the status of public officials. This image of self￾seeking bureaucrats is plainly at odds with the pluralist notion of a state machine 
imbued with an ethic of public service and firmly subject to political control.

Allegations of a leviathan or deep state have been a common rally cry for modern 
populist movements, which argue that the political system has been captured 
in many countries by a cabal of established interests who operate the machinery 
of government largely beyond the control even of nominally powerful elected 
representatives. Such critiques are not exclusive to the right wing, however, and 
elected politicians of all stripes have periodically expressed frustration with the 
sometimes-limited impact even national leaders can have on steering the ship of 
state. In part, this is because modern states are indeed enormous by any measure. 
Consider India’s federal government, which employs millions of people across 58 
ministries and 93 government departments to implement policies across 36 states 
and territories with a population of some 1.4 billion people. This is to say nothing 
of the many hundreds of other agencies, boards and bureaus which regulate and 
oversee countless areas of everyday life, from dredging ports to testing medicines 
to setting interest rates. While the growth of the state has not necessarily been ill 
intentioned, the sheer vastness of modern government means that individual 
politicians or administrations cannot possibly be across everything that it does, and

it can take a lot of work for a policy made in a politician’s office to be felt on the 
ground in far-flung corner of the country.
The patriarchal state
Modern thinking about the state must, finally, take account of the implications of 
feminist theory. However, this is not to say that there is a systematic feminist theory 
of the state. As emphasized in Chapter 2, feminist theory encompasses a range of 
traditions and perspectives, and has thus generated a range of very different attitudes 
towards state power. Moreover, feminists have usually not regarded the nature of 
state power as a central political issue, preferring instead to concentrate on the deeper 
structure of male power centred on institutions such as the family and the economic 
system. Some feminists, indeed, may question conventional definitions of the state, 
arguing, for instance, that the idea that the state exercises a monopoly of legitimate 
violence is compromised by the routine use of violence and intimidation in family 
and domestic life. Nevertheless, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly, 
feminists have helped to enrich the state debate by developing novel and challenging 
perspectives on state power.
Liberal feminists, who believe that sexual or gender (see p. 209) equality can be 
brought  about through incremental reform, have tended to accept an essentially 
pluralist view of the state. They recognize that, if women are denied legal and 
political equality, and especially the right to vote, the state is biased in favour of 
men. However, their faith in the state’s basic neutrality is reflected in the belief that 
any such bias can, and will, be overcome by a process of reform. In this sense, liberal 
feminists believe that all groups (including women) have potentially equal access to 
state power, and that this can be used impartially to promote justice and the common 
good. Liberal feminists have therefore usually viewed the state in positive terms, 
seeing state intervention as a means of redressing gender inequality and enhancing 
the role of women. This can be seen in campaigns for equal-pay legislation, the 
legalization of abortion, the provision of child-care facilities, the extension of welfare 
benefits and so on.
Nevertheless, a more critical and negative view of the state has been developed by 
radical feminists, who argue that state power reflects a deeper structure of oppression 
in the form of patriarchy. There are several similarities between Marxist and radical 
feminist views of state power. Both groups, for example, deny that the state is an 
autonomous entity bent on the pursuit of its own interests. Instead, the state is 
understood, and its biases are explained, by reference to a ‘deep structure’ of power 
in society at large. Whereas Marxists place the state in an economic context, radical 
feminists place it in a context of gender inequality and insist that it is essentially 
an institution of male power. In common with Marxism, distinctive instrumentalist 
and structuralist versions of this feminist position have been developed. The 
instrumentalist argument views the state as little more than an agent or ‘tool’ used 
by men to defend their own interests and uphold the structures of patriarchy. This 
line of argument draws on the core feminist belief that patriarchy is rooted in the 
division of society into distinct ‘public’ and ‘private’ spheres of life, men dominating 
the former while women are confined to the latter. Quite simply, in this view, the 
state is run by men, and for men.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 71 23-07-2024 12:40:5472 POLITICS
Whereas instrumentalist arguments focus on the personnel of the state, and 
particularly the state elite, structuralist arguments tend to emphasize the degree 
to which state institutions are embedded in a wider patriarchal system. Modern 
radical feminists have paid particular attention to the emergence of the welfare 
state, seeing it as the expression of a new kind of patriarchal power. Welfare may 
uphold patriarchy by bringing about a transition from private dependence (in which 
women as ‘home makers’ are dependent on men as ‘breadwinners’) to a system of 
public dependence in which women are increasingly controlled by the institutions 
of the extended state. For instance, women have become increasingly dependent on 
the state as beneficiaries of state services (such as child-care institutions, nursery 
education and social work) and as employees, particularly in the so-called ‘caring’ 
professions (such as nursing, social work and education).
The role of the state
Contrasting interpretations of state power have clear implications for the desirable 
role or responsibilities of the state. What should states do? What functions or 
responsibilities should the state fulfil, and which ones should be left in the hands of 
private individuals? In many respects, these are the questions around which electoral 
politics and party competition revolve. With the exception of anarchists, who dismiss 
the state as fundamentally evil and unnecessary, all political thinkers have regarded 
the state as, in some sense, worthwhile. Even revolutionary socialists, inspired by the 
Leninist slogan ‘smash the state’, have accepted the need for a temporary proletarian 
state to preside over the transition from capitalism to communism. Nevertheless, 
there is profound disagreement about the exact role the state should play, and 
therefore about the proper balance between the state and civil society. Among the 
different state forms that have developed are the following:
 minimal states
 developmental states
 social-democratic states
 collectivized states
 totalitarian states
 religious states.
Minimal states
The minimal state is the ideal of classical liberals, whose aim is to ensure that 
individuals enjoy the widest possible realm of freedom. This view is rooted in social￾contract theory (see p. 66), but it nevertheless advances an essentially ‘negative’ view 
of the state. From this perspective, the value of the state is that it has the capacity 
to constrain human behaviour and thus to prevent individuals encroaching on the 
rights and liberties of others. The state is merely a protective body, its core function 
being to provide a framework of peace and social order within which citizens can 
conduct their lives as they think best. In Locke’s famous simile, the state acts as a 
‘nightwatchman’, whose services are called upon only when orderly existence is 
Rights: Legal or moral 
entitlements to act or 
be treated in a particular 
way; civil rights differ from 
human rights.
CONCEPT
Patriarchy
Patriarchy literally 
means ‘rule by the 
father’, the domination 
of the husband–father 
within the family, and 
the subordination of his 
wife and his children. 
However, the term 
is usually used in the 
more general sense of 
‘rule by men’, drawing 
attention to the totality 
of oppression and 
exploitation to which 
women are subject. 
Patriarchy thus implies 
that the system of 
male power in society 
at large both reflects 
and stems from the 
dominance of the father 
in the family. Patriarchy 
is a key concept 
in radical feminist 
analysis, in that it 
emphasizes that gender 
inequality is systematic, 
institutionalized and 
pervasive.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 72 23-07-2024 12:40:54POLITICS AND THE STATE 73
threatened. This ‘nightwatchman’ state thus has three core functions. First and 
foremost, the state exists to maintain domestic order. Second, it ensures that contracts 
or voluntary agreements made between private citizens are enforced, and third, it 
provides protection against external attack. The institutional apparatus of a minimal 
state is thus limited to a police force, a court system and a military of some kind. 
Economic, social, cultural, moral and other responsibilities belong to the individual, 
and are therefore firmly part of civil society.
The cause of the minimal state has been taken up in modern political debate by 
the New Right. Drawing on early liberal ideas, and particularly on free-market 
or classical economic theories, the New Right has proclaimed the need to ‘roll 
back the frontiers of the state’. In the writings of Robert Nozick, this amounts 
to a restatement of Lockean liberalism based on a defence of individual rights, 
especially property rights. In the case of free-market economists such as Friedrich 
von Hayek (see p. 36) and Milton Friedman (see p. 179), state intervention is 
seen as a ‘dead hand’ that reduces competition, efficiency and productivity. From 
the New Right perspective, the state’s economic role should be confined to two 
functions: the maintenance of a stable means of exchange or ‘sound money’ (low or 
zero inflation), and the promotion of competition through controls on monopoly 
power, price fixing and so on.
KEY THINKER
ROBERT NOZICK (1938–2002)
US academic and political philosopher. Nozick’s major work, Anarchy, State and Utopia
(1974), had a profound influence on New Right theories and beliefs. He developed a form 
of libertarianism that was close to Locke’s and clearly influenced by nineteenth-century US 
individualists such as Lysander Spooner (1808–87) and Benjamin Tucker (1854–1939). He 
argued that property rights should be strictly upheld, provided that wealth has been justly 
acquired in the first place or has been justly transferred from one person to another. This 
position means support for minimal government and minimal taxation and undermines the 
case for welfare and redistribution. Nozick’s rights-based theory of justice was developed in 
response to the ideas of John Rawls (see p. 35). In later life, Nozick modified his extreme 
libertarianism.

Developmental states
The best historical examples of minimal states were those in countries such as the UK 
and the USA during the period of early industrialization in the nineteenth century. 
As a general rule, however, the later a country industrializes, the more extensive will 
be its state’s economic role. A developmental state is one that intervenes in economic 
life with the specific purpose of promoting industrial growth and economic 
development. In Japan and Germany, for instance, the state assumed a more active 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 73 23-07-2024 12:40:5574 POLITICS
developmental role from the outset. This does not amount to an attempt to replace 
the market with a socialist system of planning and control but, rather, to an attempt 
to construct a partnership between the state and major economic interests, often 
underpinned by conservative and nationalist priorities.
The classic example of a developmental state is Japan. During the Meiji Period 
(1868–1912), the Japanese state forged a close relationship with the zaibutsu, the 
great family-run business empires that dominated the Japanese economy. After 
1945, the developmental role of the Japanese state was largely assumed by the 
Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which, together with the 
Bank of Japan, helped to shape private investment decisions and steer the Japanese 
economy towards international competitiveness. A similar model of developmental 
intervention has existed in France, where governments of both left and right have 
tended to recognize the need for economic planning, and the state bureaucracy 
has seen itself as the custodian of the national interest. In countries such as 
Austria and, to some extent, Germany, economic development has been achieved 
through the construction of a ‘partnership state’, in which an emphasis is placed 
on the maintenance of a close relationship between the state and major economic 
interests, notably big business and organized labour. More recently, economic 
globalization has fostered the emergence of competition states, prominent 
examples of which are found amongst to so-called ‘tiger economies’ of East Asia, 
such as Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore (see pp. 138–139). Competition states 
are distinguished by their recognition of the need to strengthen education and 
training as the principal guarantee of economic success in a context of intensifying 
transnational competition. The success of the tiger economies has encouraged 
similar models of state intervention globally, particularly neighbouring countries 
such as Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, which in some ways were obliged to follow 
suit to remain competitive. As developmental states mature, however, they usually 
transition towards more minimal conceptions, as heavy-handed state intervention 
tends to diminish in its usefulness at higher levels of economic development. 
Japan’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry, for example, found its policy 
effectiveness declining as the Japanese economy boomed in the 1980s and was 
abolished altogether in 2001.
Social-democratic states
Whereas developmental states practise interventionism to stimulate economic 
progress, social-democratic states intervene with a view to bringing about broader 
social restructuring, usually in accordance with principles such as fairness, 
equality (see p. 511) and social justice. In countries such as Austria and Sweden, 
state intervention has been guided by both developmental and social-democratic 
priorities. Nevertheless, developmentalism and social democracy do not always go 
hand in hand. As David Marquand (1988) pointed out, although the state in the UK 
was significantly extended in the period immediately after the Second World War 
along social-democratic lines, it failed to evolve into a developmental state. The key 
to understanding the social-democratic state is that there is a shift from a ‘negative’ 
view of the state, which sees it as little more than a necessary evil, to a ‘positive’ view 
Economic globalization:
The incorporation of 
national economies 
into a single ‘borderless’ 
global economy, through 
transnational production 
and capital flows.
Competition state: A 
state which pursues 
strategies to ensure long￾term competitiveness in a 
globalized economy.
Social justice: A morally 
justifiable distribution of 
material rewards; social 
justice is often seen to 
imply a bias in favour of 
equality.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 74 23-07-2024 12:40:55POLITICS AND THE STATE 75
of the state, in which it is seen as a means of enlarging liberty and promoting justice. 
The social-democratic state is thus the ideal of both modern liberals and democratic 
socialists.
Rather than merely laying down the conditions of orderly existence, the social￾democratic state is an active participant, helping to rectify the imbalances and 
injustices of a market economy. It therefore tends to focus less upon the generation 
of wealth and more upon the equitable distribution of wealth. In practice, this 
boils down to an attempt to eradicate poverty and reduce social inequality. 
The twin features of a social-democratic state are therefore Keynesianism (see 
pp. 177–179) and social welfare. The aim of Keynesian economic policies is to 
‘manage’ or ‘regulate’ capitalism with a view to promoting growth and maintaining 
full employment. Although this may entail an element of planning, the classic 
Keynesian strategy involves ‘demand management’ through adjustments in fiscal 
policy, such as levels of public spending and taxation. The adoption of welfare 
policies has led to the emergence of so-called welfare states, whose responsibilities 
have extended to the promotion of social well-being amongst their citizens. In this 
sense, the social-democratic state is an ‘enabling state’, dedicated to the principle 
of individual empowerment.
Collectivized states
While developmental and social-democratic states intervene in economic life with 
a view to guiding or supporting a largely private economy, collectivized states 
bring the entirety of economic life under state control. The best examples of such 
states were in orthodox communist countries such as the USSR and throughout 
Eastern Europe. These sought to abolish private enterprise altogether and set up 
centrally planned economies administered by a network of economic ministries 
and planning committees. So-called command economies were organized 
through a system of directive planning that was ultimately controlled by the 
highest organs of the communist party. The justification for state collectivization
stems from a fundamental socialist preference for common ownership over private 
property. However, the use of the state to attain this goal suggests a more positive 
attitude to state power than that outlined in the classical writings of Marx and 
Engels (1820–95).
Marx and Engels by no means ruled out nationalization; Engels, in particular, 
recognized that, during the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’, state control would be 
extended to include factories, the banks, transportation and so on. Nevertheless, 
they envisaged that the proletarian state would be strictly temporary, and that it 
would ‘wither away’ as class antagonisms abated. In contrast, the collectivized state 
in the USSR became permanent, and increasingly powerful and bureaucratic. Under 
Stalin, socialism was effectively equated with statism, the advance of socialism being 
reflected in the widening responsibilities and powers of the state apparatus. Indeed, 
after Khrushchev announced in 1962 that the dictatorship of the proletariat had 
ended, the state was formally identified with the interests of ‘the whole Soviet peoples’. 
True collectivized states have virtually disappeared in the twenty-first century, as

DEBATING . . .
IS THE STATE A FORCE FOR GOOD?
Political debates so often revolve around the issue of the state and, in particular, the proper balance between the state and 
civil society. At one extreme, anarchists claim that states and, for that matter, all systems of rule are illegitimate. Other 
views range from a grudging acceptance of the state as a necessary evil to a positive endorsement of the state as a force for 
good. Does the state have a positive or negative impact on our lives? Should it be celebrated or feared?
YES NO
Key to civilized existence. The most basic argument 
in favour of the state is that it is a vital guarantee 
of order and social stability. A state is absolutely 
necessary because only a sovereign body that enjoys a 
monopoly of the means of coercion is able to prevent 
(regrettable, but inevitable) conflict and competition 
from spilling over into barbarism and chaos. Life in the 
absence of a state would be, as Hobbes famously put it, 
‘solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short’. This is a lesson 
that is underlined by the sad misfortunes suffered by 
so-called ‘failed’ states (see p. 75), where civil war 
and warlordism take hold in the absence of a credible 
system of law and order.
Foundation of public life. The state differs from other 
bodies and institutions in that it is the only one that 
represents the common or collective interests, rather 
than the selfish or particular ones. The state speaks 
for the whole of society, not just its parts. As such, the 
state makes possible a ‘public’ realm of existence, which 
allows people to be involved in something larger than 
themselves, discharging responsibilities towards fellow 
citizens and, where appropriate, participating in making 
collective decisions. In a tradition that dates back to 
Aristotle and Hegel, the state can therefore be seen to 
be morally superior to civil society.
Agent of social justice. The state is a key agent of 
modernization and delivers a range of economic 
and social benefits. Even supporters of free-market 
economics acknowledge this in accepting that the 
economy can only function in a context of civic order 
that can only be established by the state. Beyond 
this, the state can counter the inherent instability of a 
market economy by intervening to ensure sustainable 
growth and full employment, and it can protect people 
from poverty and other forms of social disadvantage 
by delivering publicly funded welfare services that no 
amount of private philanthropy can rival in terms of 
reach and quality.
Cause of disorder. As anarchists argue, the state is the 
cause of the problem of order, not its solution. The state 
breeds conflict and unrest because, by robbing people of 
their moral autonomy and forcing them to obey rules they 
have not made themselves, it ‘infantalizes’ them and blocks 
their moral development. This leaves them under the sway 
of base instincts and allows selfishness, greed and aggression 
to spread. As moral development flourishes in conditions of 
freedom and equality, reducing the authority of the state or, 
preferably, removing it altogether, will allow order to arise 
‘from below’, naturally and spontaneously.
Enemy of freedom. The state is, at best, a necessary 
evil. Even when its benefits in terms of upholding order 
are accepted, the state should be confined to a strictly 
minimal role. This is because, as state authority is sovereign, 
compulsory and coercive, the ‘public’ sphere is, by its 
nature, a realm of oppression. While anarchists therefore 
argue that all states are illegitimate, others suggest that this 
only applies when the state goes beyond its essential role of 
laying down the conditions for orderly existence. Freedom 
is enlarged to the extent that the ‘public’ sphere contracts, 
civil society being morally superior to the state.
Recipe for poverty. The economy works best when it is left 
alone by the state. Market economies are self-regulating 
mechanisms; they tend towards long-term equilibrium, as 
the forces of demand and supply come into line with one 
another. The state, in contrast, is a brute machine: however 
well-meaning state intervention in economic and social 
life may be, it inevitably upsets the natural balance of the 
market and so imperils growth and prosperity. This was a 
lesson most graphically illustrated by the fate of orthodox 
communist systems, but it has also been underlined by the 
poor economic performance of over-regulated capitalist 
systems.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_3.indd 76 23-07-2024 12:40:55POLITICS AND THE STATE 77
most countries, even those that continue to uphold a nominally communist ideology, 
have found some combination of the developmental and welfare state to be a more 
effective and realistic goal than a state in which all economic activity is subsumed 
within the state.
Totalitarian states
The most extreme and extensive form of interventionism is found in totalitarian 
states. The essence of totalitarianism is the construction of an all-embracing state, 
the influence of which penetrates every aspect of human existence. Totalitarianism 
brings not only the economy but also education, culture, religion, family life and so 
on under direct state control. The classic examples of totalitarian states are Hitler’s 
Germany and Stalin’s USSR, although modern regimes such as North Korea have 
similar characteristics. The central pillars of such regimes are a comprehensive 
programme of surveillance and terroristic policing, and a pervasive system of 
ideological manipulation and control. In this sense, totalitarian states effectively 
extinguish civil society and abolish the ‘private’ sphere of life altogether. This is a goal 
that only fascists, who wish to dissolve individual identity within the social whole, 
are prepared openly to endorse. It is sometimes argued that Mussolini’s notion of a 
totalitarian state was derived from Hegel’s belief in the state as an ‘ethical community’ 
reflecting the altruism and mutual sympathy of its members. From this perspective, 
the advance of human civilization can clearly be linked to the aggrandizement of the 
state and the widening of its responsibilities.
Religious states
On the face of it, a religious state is a contradiction in terms. The modern state 
emerged largely through the triumph of civil authority over religious authority, 
religion increasingly being confined to the private sphere, through a separation 
between church and state. The advance of state sovereignty thus usually went hand in 
hand with the forward march of secularization. In the USA, the secular nature of the 
state was enshrined in the First Amendment to the constitution, which guarantees 
that freedom of worship shall not be abridged, while in France the separation of 
church and state has been maintained through a strict emphasis on the principle of 
laïcité. In countries such as Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the UK, state religions
in the form of national churches have historically developed, although the privileges 
these religions enjoy stop well short of theocratic rule, and their political influence 
has generally been restricted by a high level of social secularization.
Nevertheless, the period since the 1980s has witnessed the rise of the religious state, 
driven by the tendency within religious fundamentalism (see p. 55) to reject the 
public/private divide and to view religion as the basis of politics. Far from regarding 
the political realm as inherently corrupt, fundamentalist movements have typically 
looked to seize control of the state and to use it as an instrument of moral and 
spiritual regeneration. This was evident, for instance, in the process of ‘Islamization’ 
introduced in Pakistan under General Zia-ul-Haq after 1978, the establishment of 
an Islamic state in Iran as a result of the 1979 revolution and, despite its formal 
CONCEPT
Statism
Statism is the belief that 
state intervention is the 
most appropriate means 
of resolving political 
problems, or bringing 
about economic and 
social development. 
This view is underpinned 
by a deep, and perhaps 
unquestioning, faith 
in the state as a 
mechanism through 
which collective action 
can be organized and 
common goals can be 
achieved. The state is 
thus seen as an ethical 
ideal, and as serving 
the public interest. 
Statism is most clearly 
reflected in government 
policies that regulate 
and control economic 
life, possibly extending 
to Soviet-style state 
collectivization.
Laïcité: (French) The 
principle of the absence 
of religious involvement in

commitment to secularism, the close links between the Sri Lankan state and 
Sinhala Buddhism, particularly during the years of violent struggle against Tamil 
separatism. Although, strictly speaking, religious states are founded on the basis of 
religious principles, and, in the Iranian model, contain explicitly theocratic features, 
in other cases religiously orientated governments operate in a context that retains 
a commitment to constitutional secularism. The foundation of the Islamic State in 
1999, and its dramatic expansion into Iraq and Syria in 2014 and 2015, is a significant 
recent case of an explicitly religious state reemerging in global politics, adopting as 
its model the medieval Islamic concept of the caliphate, in which the political and 
religious leadership of the Muslim world was to be united. Such a concept explicitly 
rejects the nation-state ideal – instead of a state built around a common national 
identity, the caliphate ignores ethnic, linguistic and cultural borders and seeks

ECLIPSE OF THE STATE?
Since the late 1980s, debate about the state has been overshadowed by assertions 
about its decline or ‘retreat’. The once-mighty leviathan – widely seen to be co￾extensive with politics itself – had seemingly been humbled, state authority having 
been undermined by the growing importance of, amongst other things, the global 
economy, the market, major corporations, non-state actors and international 
organizations. The desire thus grew for state-centric approaches to domestic and 
international politics to be rethought, or even abandoned altogether. However, it can 
be misleading to suggest that the state has only declined in the face of these forces. 
For example, although states and markets are commonly portrayed as rival forces, 
they also interlock and complement one another. Apart from anything else, markets 
cannot function without a system of property rights that only the state can establish 
and protect. Although states may have lost authority in certain respects; in others, 
they may have become stronger.
The challenge of globalization
The rise of globalization (see p. 182) has stimulated a major debate about the power 
and significance of the state in a globalized world. Three contrasting positions can be 
identified. In the first place, some theorists have boldly proclaimed the emergence of 
‘post-sovereign governance’ (Scholte 2017), suggesting that the rise of globalization 
is inevitably marked by the decline of the state as a meaningful actor. Power shifts 
away from the state and towards global marketplaces and transnational corporations 
(TNCs) (see p. 183) in particular. In the most extreme version of this argument, 
advanced by so-called ‘hyperglobalists’, the state is seen to be so ‘hollowed out’ as to 
have become, in effect, redundant. Others, nevertheless, deny that globalization has 
altered the core feature of world politics, which is that, as in earlier eras, sovereign 
states are the primary determinants of what happens within their borders, and remain 
the principal actors on the world stage. In this view, globalization and the state are not 
separate or, still less, opposing forces; rather, and to a surprising degree, globalization 
has been created by states and thus exists to serve their interests. Between these two 
views, however, there is a third position, which acknowledges that globalization has 
CONCEPT
Totalitarianism
Totalitarianism is an 
all-encompassing 
system of political rule, 
typically established by 
pervasive ideological 
manipulation and open 
terror. Totalitarianism 
differs from autocracy 
and authoritarianism 
(see p. 139) in that it 
seeks to politicize every 
aspect of social and 
personal existence, 
rather than just suppress 
political opposition. 
Totalitarian regimes are 
sometimes identified 
through a ‘six-point 
syndrome’ (Friedrich 
and Brzezinski 1963): (1) 
an official ideology; (2) a 
one-party state, usually 
led by an all-powerful 
leader; (3) a system of 
terroristic policing; (4) a 
monopoly of the means 
of mass communication; 
(5) a monopoly of 
the means of armed 
combat; and (6) state 
control of all aspects of 
economic life.

brought about qualitative changes in the role and significance of the state, and in the 
nature of sovereignty, but emphasizes that these have transformed the state, rather 
than simply reduced or increased its power.
Developments such as the rise of international migration and the spread of cultural 
globalization have tended to make state borders increasingly permeable. However, 
most of the discussion about the changing nature and power of the state has 
concerned the impact of economic globalization (discussed in more detail in Chapter
7). The central feature of economic globalization is the rise of supraterritoriality, 
the process through which economic activity increasingly takes place within a 
‘borderless world’ (Ohmae 1989). This is particularly clear in relation to financial 
markets that have become genuinely globalized, in that capital flows around the world 
seemingly instantaneously; meaning, for example, that no state can be insulated from 
the impact of financial crises in other parts of the world. If borders have become 
permeable and old geographical certainties have been shaken, state sovereignty, at 
least in its traditional sense, cannot survive. This is the sense in which governance 
in the twenty-first century has assumed a genuinely post-sovereign character. It 
is difficult to see how economic sovereignty can be reconciled with a globalized 
economy. Sovereign control over economic life was only possible in a world of 
discrete national economies; to the extent that these are being incorporated into a 
single globalized economy, economic sovereignty becomes meaningless. However, 
the rhetoric of a ‘borderless’ global economy can be taken too far. For example, there 
has been, if anything, a growing recognition that market-based economies can only 
operate successfully within a context of legal and social order that only the state can 
guarantee (Fukuyama 2005).
Non-state actors and international bodies
A further manifestation of the decline of the state is evident in the rise of non-state 
or transnational actors and the growing importance of international organizations. 
This reflects the fact that, increasingly, major aspects of politics no longer take place 
merely in or through the state but, rather, outside or beyond the state. Amongst non￾state actors, TNCs are often regarded as the most significant. They often dwarf states 
in terms of their economic size. Based on the (rather crude) comparison between 
corporate revenues and the gross domestic product (GDP) of national economies, as 
of 2022, more than half of the world’s 100 largest economies are corporations rather 
than countries. Walmart, the world’s largest corporation, is roughly the same size 
economically as Sweden. Amazon has revenues that exceed the GDP of Nigeria, a 
nation of more than 200 million people. However, economic size does not necessarily 
translate into political power or influence. States, after all, can do things that TNCs 
can only dream about, such as make laws and raise armies. Non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) (see p. 302) have also steadily grown in number and influence, 
particularly since the 1990s. Estimates of the total number of international NGOs 
usually exceed 30,000, with over 1,000 groups enjoying formal consultative status 
by the UN. Their expertise, moral authority and high public profiles enable NGOs 
such as Greenpeace, Amnesty International and Care International to exert a level 
of influence within international organizations that may at times rival, or even

surpass, that of national governments. Other non-state actors range from the 
women’s movement and the anti-capitalist movement to terrorist networks, such 
as ISIS, guerrilla armies and transnational criminal organizations. As such groups 
have a ‘trans-border’ character, they are often able to operate in ways that elude the 
jurisdiction of any state.
International bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO) have attracted 
significant protest, particularly in developing countries, where their power is seen to 
be compromising the ability of sovereign states to protect their economic interests 
and those of their citizens.

The growth of politics beyond the state has also been apparent in the trend towards 
political globalization. However, its impact has been complex and, in some ways, 
contradictory. On the one hand, international bodies such as the UN, the European 
Union (EU) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) have undermined the 
capacity of states to operate as self-governing political units. As the range and 
importance of decisions that are made at intergovernmental or supranational level 
has increased, states have been forced to exert influence in and through regional or 
global bodies, or to operate within frameworks established by them. In the case of 
the EU, a growing range of decisions (for example, on monetary policy, agriculture 
and fisheries policy, defence and foreign affairs) are made by EU institutions, rather 
than member states. This has led to the phenomenon of multilevel governance, (as 
discussed in Chapter 17), but it has also led to tensions with member states. The 
WTO, for its part, acts as the judge and jury of global trade disputes and serves as a 
forum for negotiating trade deals between and amongst its members. On the other 
hand, political globalization both expands and diminishes opportunities for the 
state. This occurs through the ‘pooling’ of sovereignty. For example, the Council of 
the European Union, the most powerful policy-making body in the EU, is very much

CONCEPT
Governance
Governance is a broader 
term than government 
(see p. 119). Although 
lacking a settled or 
agreed definition, it 
refers, in its widest 
sense, to the various 
ways through which 
social life is coordinated. 
Government can 
therefore be seen as 
one of the institutions 
involved in governance; 
it is possible to have 
‘governance without 
government’ (Rhodes 
1996). The wider use 
of the term reflects a 
blurring of the state/
society distinction, 
resulting from changes 
such as the development 
of new forms of public 
management and the 
growth of public–private 
partnerships.

a creature of its member states and provides a forum that allows national politicians 
to make decisions on a supranational level.
Failed states
In the developing world, debate about the decline of the state has sometimes been 
displaced by concern about weak, failing or collapsed states. Robert Cooper (2004) 
portrayed what he called the ‘pre-modern’ world as a world of postcolonial chaos, in 
which such state structures as exist are unable to establish a legitimate monopoly of 
the use of force, thus leading to endemic warlordism, widespread criminality and 
social dislocation. Such conditions do not apply consistently across the developing 
world, however. In cases such as India, South Korea and Taiwan, developmental 
states have been highly successful in pursuing strategies of economic modernization 
and social development.
Others, nevertheless, have been distinguished by their weakness, sometimes being 
portrayed as ‘quasi-states’ or ‘failed states’; examples include Yemen, Somalia and 
the Central African Republic. These states fail the most basic test of state power: 
they are unable to maintain domestic order and personal security, meaning that 
civil strife and even civil war become almost routine, and that there is no true 
central government or authority that extends over the country. The Fund for Peace’s 
Fragility Index has attempted to make more scientific the concept of state weakness, 
noting that while only some states may have explicitly collapsed, many more – like 
Myanmar, Mali and Eritrea – are extremely vulnerable and only partially fulfil our 
expectations of the modern state.
Weak or failed states have often been prompted by the experience of colonialism (see 
p. 163), which upon its demise bequeathed formal political independence to societies 
that lacked an appropriate level of political, economic, social and educational 
development to function effectively as separate entities, and often in situations where 
key economic resources had been expropriated or continued to be owned by former 
colonial masters. As the borders of such states typically represented the extent of 
colonial ambition, rather than the existence of a culturally cohesive population, 
postcolonial states also often encompass deep ethnic, religious and tribal divisions – 
there was a limited concept of a ‘nation’ behind these new states.
In more recent decades, ongoing sectarian violence and international conflict, and 
demographic pressures and mass migration, have been the more likely causes of 
state failure, particularly in conflict zones in the Middle East and North and Central 
Africa. Moreover, the globalized international economy has made states far more 
vulnerable to sudden shocks and external forces that can worsen state fragility.
Return of the state?
Discussion about the state in the early twenty-first century has been dominated 
by talk of retreat, decline or even collapse. The reality is more complex, however. 
For instance, although globalization may make state borders more permeable, 
globalization has not been imposed on unwilling states; rather, it is a process that 
has been devised by states in pursuit of what they identify as their national interests.

CONCEPT
Failed state
A failed state is a 
state that is unable to 
perform its key role of 
ensuring domestic order 
by monopolizing the 
use of force within its 
territory. Examples of 
failed states in recent 
years include Yemen, 
Somalia and the Central 
African Republic. Failed 
states are no longer 
able to operate as viable 
political units, in that 
they lack a credible 
system of law and order. 
And they are no longer 
able to operate as viable 
economic units, in 
that they are incapable 
of providing for their 
citizens or creating 
conditions for economic 
stability and growth. 
Although relatively 
few states collapse 
altogether, a much 
larger number barely 
function and are close to 
collapse.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
COVID-19: THE VIRTUES AND LIMITS OF THE STATE
In December 2019, a new coronavirus strain was officially 
identified by researchers in Wuhan, China – Covid-19. 
Though initially a small local outbreak, by January of 2020 
international travellers had spread the virus around the 
world. By the end of April there were millions of infection 
cases globally, and more than a quarter of a million deaths 
from the disease. A global pandemic had broken out on a 
scale unseen for generations.
Plagues and epidemics have claimed the lives of hundreds 
of millions over mankind’s long history, far in excess of even 
the most devastating wars and natural disasters. Yet prior 
to the advent of professionalized medicine and hospitals, 
public health services and the modern pharmaceutical 
industry, the state was largely powerless to act against 
them. The Black Death, which swept across Europe in 
the fourteenth century and wiped out perhaps a third of 
its population, raged with little effective response from 
authorities – indeed, in many places there was not even the 
infrastructure to do basic tasks like quarantine the sick or 
remove infected corpses. What authorities did exist, such 
as city-states and the church, largely confined themselves 
to praying for salvation. Many of these authorities simply 
collapsed in the face of this all-consuming tragedy, which 
completely transformed European society and politics.
Yet against Covid-19 stood the leviathan states of the 
modern world, armed with national and international health 
bureaucracies, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and 
research laboratories. In terms of employees, the Centers 
for Disease Control (CDC) is larger than the population 
of most medieval cities. In response to rapidly accelerating 
cases, the world’s governments took unprecedented steps 
to arrest the spread of Covid-19: travel bans, border 
closures, widespread quarantines, lockdowns and shelter￾in-place orders, bans on a wide range of public activities, 
mask requirements and eventually nationwide efforts to 
produce and distribute vaccines. Measures such as these 
could only be dreamed of in previous eras and highlight 
the central concern of the modern state – to protect its 
citizens from harm.
And yet the unprecedented intervention of the state at 
the height of the Covid-19 pandemic inevitably prompted 
furious debate over the appropriate role and limits of state 
power. Lockdowns and restrictions on individual liberties 
were particularly contentious. While more accepted in 
states with pre-existing traditions of a strong state, such 
as China and Japan, those with more minimalist state 
traditions, like the United States, faced significant public 
backlash and protest. Many key decisions of the pandemic 
response were driven by unelected bureaucrats and medical 
experts, leading to charges of a lack of democratic input 
and legitimacy. Some of the most strident critics even saw 
Covid-19 as merely an excuse for the state to expand its 
power over the citizenry. And, indeed, historically dramatic 
expansions of state power and even totalitarianism have 
come about during times of crisis or war, justified on the 
basis of protecting the public against extreme threats.
The Covid-19 pandemic also revealed the limits of the 
state, even amidst its contemporary sophistication. While 
most experts agree than public health measures may have 
saved hundreds of millions of lives, tens of millions have 
still perished and most governments, even those taking 
the most strident measures, failed to prevent a national 
outbreak at some point during the pandemic. After all, 
even the best-organized state responses to disease still 
require some degree of voluntary public compliance. 
The increasingly globalized nature of the world revealed 
the importance of non-state actors in a pandemic, like 
the World Health Organization and CDC, as well as the 
vulnerability of all states to external shocks far outside their 
control – while the Black Death took years to spread across 
Europe, Covid-19 became global in a matter of weeks. And 
the subsequent recession and inflation crises that emerged 
in its wake have demonstrated the interconnected ripple￾effect of state action.

Similarly, international organizations typically act as forums through which states 
can act in concert over matters of mutual interest, rather than as bodies intent on 
usurping state power. Moreover, several developments in recent years have helped to 
strengthen the state and underline its essential importance.
What explains the return of the state? In the first place, the state’s unique capacity to 
maintain domestic order and protect its citizens from external attack has been strongly 
underlined by new security challenges that have emerged in the twenty-first century; 
notably, those linked to transnational terrorism (as discussed in Chapter 18). This 
underlines what Philip Bobbitt (2002) viewed as a basic truth: ‘The State exists to master 
violence’; it is therefore essentially a ‘warmaking institution’. The decline in military 
expenditure that occurred at the end of the Cold War, the so-called ‘peace dividend’, 
started to be reversed in the late 1990s, with global military expenditure rising steeply 
after the September 11 terrorist attacks and the launch of the ‘war on terror’. Furthermore, 
counterterrorism strategies have often meant that states have imposed tighter border 
controls and assumed wider powers of surveillance, control and sometimes detention, 
even becoming ‘national security states’. In Europe, the USA and elsewhere, borders 
have also been strengthened in response to increased migratory flows.
However, threats to the public are broader and more complex today than simply 
war and migration. Cybercrime has the potential to reach into every connected 
computer and phone on the planet, and cybercriminal organizations have extremely 
sophisticated systems, sometimes state-backed, that most ordinary citizens cannot 
hope to defend against. Pandemics (see p. 82), environmental and natural disasters, 
and climate change represent regional and global challenges that require the state, 
and often many states, to combat.
Furthermore, the resurgence of the state has had an important economic dimension. 
Although the days of command economic management may be over, the state has 
sometimes reasserted itself as an agent of modernization. Competition states have 
done this by improving education and training to boost productivity and provide 
support for key export industries. States such as China and Russia each modernized 
their economies by making significant concessions to the market, but an important 
element of state control has been retained or re-imposed (examined in more detail 
in Chapter 7 in relation to ‘state capitalism’). On a wider level, the state’s vital role 
in economic affairs was underlined by the 2007–9 global financial crisis. Although 
the G20 (whose members include key developing powers as well as major developed 
ones) may have provided states with a forum to develop a coordinated global 
response, the massive packages of fiscal and other interventions that were agreed 
were, and could only have been, implemented by states. Indeed, one of the lessons 
of the 2007–9 crash, and of subsequent financial and fiscal crises, may be that the 
idea that the global economy works best when left alone by the state (acting alone, or 
through international organizations) has been exposed as a myth.

DEMOCRACY AND 
LEGITIMACY
KEY ISSUES
 How do states maintain legitimacy?
 Are modern societies facing a crisis of legitimation?
 Why is political legitimacy so often linked to the claim to be democratic?
 What are the core features of democratic rule?
 What models of democratic rule have been advanced?
 How do democratic systems operate in practice?
PREVIEW
Although states may enjoy a monopoly of coercive power, they seldom remain in existence through the exercise of 
force alone. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau put it, ‘the strongest is never strong enough unless he turns might into right 
and obedience into duty’. This is why all systems of rule seek legitimacy or ‘rightfulness’, allowing them to demand 
compliance from their citizens or subjects. Legitimacy is thus the key to political stability: it is nothing less than the 
source of a regime’s survival and success.
In modern politics, debates about legitimacy are dominated by the issue of democracy, so much so that 
democratic legitimacy is sometimes viewed as the only meaningful form of legitimacy. However, the link between 
legitimacy and democracy is both a relatively new idea and one that is culturally specific. Until well into the 
nineteenth century, the term ‘democracy’ continued to have pejorative implications, suggesting a form of ‘mob 
rule’; and, in parts of the developing world, democracy promotion continues to be associated with Westernization. 
Nevertheless, there is a sense in which we are all now democrats. Liberals, conservatives, socialists, anarchists 
and even communists are eager to proclaim the virtues of democracy, or at least, to stress their credentials as 
representatives of the popular will.
Indeed, as the major ideological systems have faltered or collapsed since the late twentieth century, the flame 
of democracy has appeared to burn yet more strongly. As the attractions of socialism have faded, and the merits 
of capitalism have been called into question, democracy has emerged as perhaps the only stable and enduring 
principle in the postmodern political landscape.

LEGITIMACY AND POLITICAL STABILITY
The issue of legitimacy – the rightfulness of a regime or system of rule – is linked 
to the oldest and one of the most fundamental of political debates: the problem of 
political obligation. Why should citizens feel obliged to acknowledge the authority of 
government? Do they have a duty to respect the state and obey its laws? In modern 
political debate, however, legitimacy is usually understood less in terms of moral 
obligations, and more in terms of political behaviour and beliefs. In other words, 
it addresses not the question of why people should obey the state, in an abstract 
sense, but the question of why they do obey a particular system of rule. What are 
the conditions that encourage people to see authority as rightful? How do these 
conditions shape the practice of politics? This reflects a shift from philosophy to 
sociology, but it also highlights the contested nature of the concept of legitimacy.
Legitimizing power
The classic contribution to the understanding of legitimacy as a sociological 
phenomenon was provided by Max Weber. Weber was concerned to categorize 
particular ‘systems of domination’, and to identify in each case the basis on which 
legitimacy was established. He identified three broad types of political authority:
 traditional authority
 charismatic authority
 legal–rational authority.
Each of these is characterized by a particular source of political legitimacy and thus 
different reasons that people may have for obeying a regime. In the process, Weber 
sought to understand how society had evolved politically, contrasting the systems of 
domination found in relatively simple traditional communities with those found in 
modern industrial societies.
Traditional authority
Weber’s first type of political legitimacy is based on long-established customs 
and traditions. In effect, traditional authority is regarded as legitimate because it 
has always existed: it has been sanctified by history because earlier generations 
have accepted it. Typically, it operates according to a body of well-established and 
unquestioned customs that do not need to be justified because they reflect the way 
things have always been. The most obvious examples of traditional authority are 
found amongst tribes or small groups in the form of patriarchalism (the domination 
of the father within the family, or the master over his servants) and gerontocracy 
(the rule of the aged, normally reflected in the authority of elders). Traditional 
authority is closely linked to hereditary systems of power and privilege, as reflected, 
for example, in the survival of dynastic rule in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Morocco. 
And although they are of marginal significance in advanced industrial societies, 
the survival of monarchies, albeit in a constitutional form, in Japan, Sweden and 
the United Kingdom, for example, helps to shape political culture by keeping alive 
values such as deference, respect and duty.
CONCEPT
Legitimacy
Legitimacy (from 
the Latin legitimare, 
meaning ‘to declare 
lawful’) broadly means 
‘rightfulness’. Legitimacy 
therefore confers on 
a decision a binding 
or unquestionable 
character, thus 
transforming power into 
authority (see p. 11).
Political philosophers 
treat legitimacy as 
a moral or rational 
principle; that is, as 
the grounds on which 
governments may 
demand obedience from 
citizens. The claim to 
legitimacy is thus more 
important than the fact 
of obedience. Political 
scientists, however, 
usually see legitimacy 
in sociological terms; 
that is, as a willingness 
to comply with a system 
of rule regardless of how 
this is achieved.

Tradition
Tradition may refer 
to anything that is 
handed down or 
transmitted from the 
past to the present, 
such as long-standing 
customs and practices, 
institutions, social or 
political systems, values 
and beliefs and so on. 
Tradition thus denotes 
continuity with the past. 
This continuity is usually 
understood to link the 
generations, although 
the line between the 
traditional and the 
merely fashionable 
is often indistinct. 
‘Traditional’ societies 
are often contrasted 
with ‘modern’ ones, the

KEY THINKER
MAX WEBER (1864–1920)
German political economist and sociologist. One of the founders of modern sociology, Weber 
championed a scientific and value-free approach to scholarship. He also highlighted the 
importance to social action of meaning and consciousness. Weber’s interests ranged from 
political power, organizations and law to religion and social structures. He is best known for the 
thesis that the Protestant ethic encourages the development of capitalism, and for his analysis 
of bureaucracy. Weber’s most influential works include The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of 
Capitalism (1905), The Sociology of Religion (1920) and Economy and Society (1922).

However, we should not think of traditional authority as a more primitive or autocratic 
form that has become redundant in modern politics. Cultural, social, religious and 
political norms provide powerful but often unwritten rules that underpin legitimacy 
in all political systems. For instance, a national leader who comes to power despite 
winning a smaller share of the vote than their opponent, or through deposing an 
elected leader in a party-room shuffle, might have done so completely legally, but 
will likely have their legitimacy questioned by the public, who by tradition expect 
their leaders to receive a clear electoral mandate from the public before serving.
Charismatic authority
Weber’s second form of legitimate domination is charismatic authority. This form of 
authority is based on the power of an individual’s personality; that is, on his or her 
‘charisma’ (see p. 88). Owing nothing to a person’s status, social position or office, 
charismatic authority operates entirely through the capacity of a leader to make a 
direct and personal appeal to followers as a kind of hero or saint. Mohandas Gandhi, 
for instance, is a rare case of an almost purely charismatic authority in modern politics. 
Gandhi commanded enormous respect and influence over hundreds of millions of 
Indians and shaped the course of Indian independence perhaps more than any other 
individual. Yet his status as the leader of the independence movement was entirely 
unofficial and, save a brief stint as president of the Indian National Congress, he 
never held any public or elected office. Instead, it was Gandhi’s articulate oration, 
common touch, non-violent philosophy and dedication to the cause that made him 
an authority in the eyes of millions.
Most charismatic authority, though, is married with traditional or legal authority, the 
former amplifying the latter. As a high-ranking Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini (see 
p. 213) could command significant traditional authority amongst ordinary religious 
Iranians. Yet it was his charismatic appeal which transformed him into a popular 
political authority which drove the Iranian Revolution. Other popular politicians, like 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 87 23-07-2024 12:35:2588 POLITICS
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher and Juan Peron, have augmented the 
legal powers of their office with their charismatic prestige; for it is often charismatic 
appeals to the public, and personal popularity, that most helps democratic leaders 
to convince legislatures, private interests and other stakeholders to get behind new 
policies or reforms.
Some personalist systems of rule, however, become underpinned by ‘cults of 
personality’ (see p. 367), the undoubted purpose of which is to ‘manufacture’ charisma 
and circumvent legal and traditional authority. When legitimacy is constructed 
largely through the power of a leader’s personality in this way, there are usually two 
consequences. The first is that, as charismatic authority is not based on formal rules 
or procedures, it often has no limits. The leader is a messiah, who is infallible and 
unquestionable; the masses become followers or disciples, who are required only to 
submit and obey. Some dictators like the Philippines’ Ferdinand Marcos and Peru’s 
Alberto Fujimori reached power initially through legitimate appointment or even 
elections, but once empowered reshaped their political systems completely around 
their personal authority, sweeping away any legal or traditional foundations. Second, 
so closely is charismatic authority linked to a specific individual that it is difficult 
for regimes of personal rule outlive their creators. Francisco Franco’s four-decade 
dictatorial regime in Spain, for instance, endured only a few years beyond the life of 
its creator before transitioning to democracy.
Legal–rational authority
Weber’s third type of political legitimacy, legal–rational authority, links authority 
to a clearly and legally defined set of rules. In Weber’s view, legal–rational authority 
is the typical form of authority operating in most modern states. The power of a 
president, prime minister or government official is determined in the final analysis 
by formal, constitutional rules, which constrain or limit what an office holder is able 
to do. The advantage of this form of authority over both traditional and charismatic 
authority is that, as it is attached to an office rather than a person, it is far less likely to 
be abused or to give rise to injustice. Legal–rational authority, therefore, maintains 
limited government and, in addition, promotes efficiency through a rational division 
of labour. However, Weber also recognized a darker side to this type of political 
legitimacy. The price of greater efficiency would, he feared, be a more depersonalized 
and inhuman social environment typified by the relentless spread of bureaucratic 
(see p. 409) forms of organization.
Although Weber’s classification of types of legitimacy is still seen as relevant, it has 
its limitations. One of these is that, in focusing on the legitimacy of a political regime 
or system of rule, it tells us little about the circumstances in which political authority 
is challenged as a result of unpopular policies, or a discredited leader or government. 
More significantly, as David Beetham (2013) points out, to see legitimacy, as Weber 
did, as nothing more than a ‘belief in legitimacy’ is to ignore how it is brought about. 
This may leave the determination of legitimacy largely in the hands of the powerful, 
who may be able to manufacture rightfulness through public-relations campaigns 
and propaganda.
processes. However, 
even in developed 
societies guided by the 
rule of law, traditions 
and customs still play a 
significant role in guiding 
public expectations of 
legitimacy.
CONCEPT
Charisma
Charisma was 
originally a theological 
term meaning the 
‘gift of grace’. This 
was supposedly the 
source of the power 
that Jesus exerted 
over his disciples. 
As a sociopolitical 
phenomenon, charisma 
refers to charm or 
personal power: the 
capacity to establish 
leadership (see p. 365)
through psychological 
control over others. 
Charismatic authority 
therefore includes 
the ability to inspire 
loyalty, emotional 
dependence and even 
devotion. Although it is 
usually seen as a natural 
capacity, all political 
leaders cultivate their 
charismatic qualities 
through propaganda, 
practised oratory and 
honed presentational 
skills.

Beetham thus suggests that power can only be said to be legitimate if three conditions 
are fulfilled. First, power must be exercised according to established rules, whether 
these are embodied in formal legal codes or in informal conventions. Second, these 
rules must be justified in terms of the shared beliefs of the government and the 
governed. Third, legitimacy must be demonstrated by an expression of consent 
on the part of the governed. This highlights two key features of the legitimation 
process. The first is the existence of elections and party competition, a system 
through which popular consent can be exercised (as discussed below in connection 
with democratic legitimacy). The second is the existence of constitutional rules that 
broadly reflect how people feel they should be governed (which are examined in 
Chapter 13).
Legitimation crises and revolutions
An alternative to the Weberian approach to legitimacy has been developed by 
neo-Marxist (see pp. 43–44) theorists. While orthodox Marxists were inclined to 
dismiss legitimacy as bogus, seeing it as nothing more than a bourgeois myth, 
modern Marxists, following Antonio Gramsci (see p. 219), have acknowledged that 
capitalism is in part upheld by its ability to secure political support. Neo-Marxists 
such as Jürgen Habermas (see p. 90) and Claus Offe (1984) have therefore focused 
attention not merely on the class system but also on the machinery through which 
legitimacy is maintained (the democratic process, party competition, welfare and 
social reform and so on). Nevertheless, they have also highlighted what they see 
as the inherent difficulty of legitimizing a political system that is based on unequal 
class power. In Legitimation Crisis (1973), Habermas identified a series of ‘crisis 
tendencies’ within capitalist societies that make it difficult for them to maintain 
political stability through consent alone. At the heart of this tension, he argued, 
lie contradictions and conflicts between the logic of capitalist accumulation, on 
the one hand, and the popular pressures that democratic politics unleash, on the 
other.
From this perspective, capitalist economies are seen to be bent on remorseless 
expansion, dictated by the pursuit of profit. However, the extension of political and 
social rights in an attempt to build legitimacy within such systems has stimulated 
countervailing pressures. In particular, the democratic process has led to escalating 
demands for social welfare, as well as for increased popular participation and social 
equality. The resulting expansion of the state’s responsibilities into economic and 
social life, and the inexorable rise of taxation and public spending, nevertheless 
constrain capitalist accumulation by restricting profit levels and discouraging 
enterprise. In Habermas’ view, capitalist democracies cannot permanently reconcile 
the popular demands for social security and welfare with the requirements of a 
capitalist market economy. Forced either to resist popular pressures or to risk 
economic collapse, such societies would find it increasingly difficult, and eventually 
impossible, to maintain legitimacy.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 89 23-07-2024 12:35:2590 POLITICS
A very similar problem has been identified since the 1970s in the form of what is 
called government ‘overload’. Writers such as Anthony King (1975) and Richard 
Rose (1980) argued that governments were finding it increasingly difficult to 
govern because they were subject to over-demand. This had come about both 
because politicians and political parties were encouraged to outbid one another 
in the attempt to get into power, and because pressure groups were able to besiege 
government with unrelenting and incompatible demands. Government’s capacity 
to deliver was further undermined by a general drift towards corporatism (see 
p. 304) that created growing interdependence between government agencies 
and organized groups. However, whereas neo-Marxists believed that the 
‘crisis tendencies’ identified in the 1970s were beyond the capacity of capitalist 
democracies to control, overload theorists tended to call for a significant shift 
of political and ideological priorities in the form of the abandonment of a ‘big’ 
government approach.
In many ways, the rise of the New Right since the 1980s can be seen as a response 
to this legitimation, or overload, crisis. Influenced by concerns about a growing 
fiscal crisis amongst welfare states, the New Right attempted to challenge and 
displace the theories and values that had previously legitimized the progressive 
expansion of the state’s responsibilities. This constituted a public philosophy that 
extolled rugged individualism and denigrated the ‘nanny state’. The success of this 
project is demonstrated by the fact that traditionally socialist or labour parties 
in states as different as Brazil, France, Chile, Israel, South Africa, Italy and the 
United Kingdom have accommodated themselves to broadly similar goals and 
values, turning significantly from statist policies towards more market-oriented, 
or ‘Third Way’ (see pp. 46–48) politics. As this happened, a political culture that 
once emphasized social justice, welfare rights and public responsibilities gave way 
to one in which choice, enterprise, competition and individual responsibility are 
given prominence.
KEY THINKER
JÜRGEN HABERMAS (BORN 1929)
German philosopher and social theorist. Growing up during the Nazi period, Habermas was 
politicized by the Nuremberg trials and the growing awareness after the war of Nazi crimes 
against humanity. Drawn to study with Theodor Adorno (1903–69) and Max Horkheimer 
(1895–1973), Habermas became the leading exponent of the ‘second generation’ of 
the Frankfurt School of critical theory. Habermas’ work ranges over epistemology, the 
dynamics of advanced capitalism, the nature of rationality and the relationship between 
social science and philosophy. During the 1970s, he developed critical theory into what 
became a theory of ‘communicative action’. Habermas’ main works include Towards a 
Rational Society (1970), Theory and Practice (1974) and The Theory of Communicative 
Competence (1988).

However, legitimation crises may have more dramatic consequences. When faltering 
support for a regime can no longer be managed by adjustments in public policy or 
a change in leadership, legitimacy may collapse altogether, leading either to a resort 
to repression, or to revolution. While evolutionary change is usually thought of as 
reform, revolution involves root-and-branch change. Revolutions recast the political 
order entirely, typically bringing about an abrupt and often violent break with the 
past. Although there is considerable debate about the causes of revolution, there is 
little doubt that revolution has played a crucial role in shaping the modern world. The 
American Revolution (1776) led to the creation of a constitutional republic independent 
from Britain and gave practical expression to the principle of representation. The 
French Revolution (1789) set out to destroy the old order under the banner of 
‘liberty, equality and fraternity’, advancing democratic ideals and sparking an ‘age of 
revolution’ in early nineteenth-century Europe. The Russian Revolution (1917), the 
first ‘communist’ revolution, provided a model for subsequent twenty-first-century 
FOCUS ON . . . 
WHY DO REVOLUTIONS OCCUR?
Why do regimes collapse? Should revolutions be understood primarily in political terms, or are 
they more a reflection of deeper economic or social developments? Contrasting theories of 
revolution have been advanced by Marxists and non-Marxists. In Marxist theory, revolution 
emerges out of contradictions that exist at a socio-economic level. Marx (see p. 43) believed 
that revolution marks the point at which the class struggle develops into open conflict, leading 
one class to overthrow and displace another. Just as the French Revolution was interpreted as 
a ‘bourgeois’ revolution, the Russian Revolution was later seen as a ‘proletarian’ revolution that 
set in motion a process that would culminate in the establishment of socialism and, eventually, 
full communism. However, revolutions have not come about as Marx forecast. Not only have 
they tended to occur in relatively backward societies rather than advanced capitalist countries 
(as Marx predicted), but pro-Marxist revolutions were often coup d’états rather than popular 
revolutions.
A variety of non-Marxist theories of revolution have been advanced. Systems theorists have 
argued that revolution results from disequilibrium in the political system, brought about 
by economic, social, cultural or international changes to which the system is incapable of 
responding. The idea of a ‘revolution of rising expectations’ suggests that revolutions occur 
when a period of economic and social development is abruptly reversed, creating a widening 
gap between popular expectations and the capabilities of government. The classic statement 
of this theory is found in Ted Gurr’s Why Men Rebel (1970), which links rebellion to ‘relative 
deprivation’.
The social-structural theory of revolution implies that regimes usually succumb to revolution 
when, through international weakness and/or domestic ineffectiveness, they lose their ability, 
or the political will, to maintain control through the exercise of coercive power. Theda Skocpol 
(1979) explained the outbreak of the French, Russian and Chinese revolutions in these terms, 
but they could equally be applied to the swift and largely bloodless collapse of the Eastern 
European communist regimes in the autumn and winter of 1989.
Revolution: A popular 
uprising, involving extra￾legal mass action, which 
brings about fundamental 
change (a change in the 
political system itself) 
as opposed to merely 
a change of policy or

Reform: Change

peaceful and incremental

improvement.

revolutions, including the Chinese Revolution (1949), the Cuban Revolution (1959) 
and the Ethiopian Revolution (1973). The Eastern European Revolutions (1989–91) 
nevertheless re-established the link between revolution and the pursuit of political 
democracy. Nevertheless, the ideological character of a revolutionary upheaval may 
be significantly out of step with subsequent developments. This can be seen in the case 
of the Arab Spring (2010–12), which delivered mixed results for the democratization 
of regimes across the Middle East.
The pro-democracy Arab Spring protests successfully deposed several authoritarian 
regimes across the Arab world. Yet their legacy is complicated. In Tunisia, where the 
protests began in 2010 (above), a dictatorship was ousted in 2011, only to return 
under new guises in 2021.

DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY
Modern discussions about legitimacy are dominated by its relationship to democracy, 
so much so that democratic legitimacy is now widely accepted as the only meaningful 
form of legitimacy. The claim that a political organization is legitimate may therefore 
be intrinsically linked to its claim to be democratic. The next main section examines 
competing models of democratic rule and debates how democracy operates in practice, 
but this section considers how, and how reliably, democracy is linked to legitimacy.
Democracy can be seen to promote legitimacy in at least three ways. In the first 
place, it does so through consent. Although citizens do not explicitly give their 
consent to be governed, thereby investing political authority with a formal ‘right 
to rule’, they do so implicitly each time they participate in the political process. In 
this respect, democracy underpins legitimacy by expanding the opportunities for 
political participation, most importantly through the act of voting, but also through 
activities such as joining a political party or interest group or by engaging in protests 
or demonstrations. Political participation, in this sense, binds government and the 
Consent: Assent or 
permission; in politics, 
usually an agreement to 
be governed or ruled.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 92 23-07-2024 12:35:26DEMOCRACY AND LEGITIMACY 93
people, encouraging the latter to view the rules of the political game as rightful and 
so to accept that they have an obligation to respect and obey those in authority.
Second, the essence of democratic governance is a process of compromise, 
conciliation and negotiation, through which rival interests and groups find a way of 
living together in relative peace, rather than resorting to force and the use of naked 
power. The mechanisms through which this non-violent conflict resolution takes 
place, notably elections, legislative debates, party competition and so forth, thus 
tend to enjoy broad popular support as they ensure that power is widely dispersed, 
each group having a political voice of some kind or other. Third, democracy operates 
as a feedback system that tends towards long-term political stability, as it brings the 
‘outputs’ of government into line with the ‘inputs’ or pressures placed upon it. As 
democracy provides a mechanism through which governments can be removed and 
public policy changed, it tends to keep ‘disequilibrium’ in the political system to a 
minimum, enabling legitimation crises to be managed effectively and substantially 
undermining the potential for civil strife, rebellion or revolution.
Nevertheless, the notion of an intrinsic link between legitimacy and democracy 
has also been questioned. Some, for example, argue that the high levels of political 
stability and low incidence of civic strife and popular rebellion in democratic 
societies can be explained more persuasively by factors other than democracy. 
These include the fact that, having in the main advanced capitalist economies, 
democratic societies tend to enjoy widespread prosperity and are effective in 
‘delivering the goods’. This is known as performance legitimacy (Gilley 2009). 
Singapore (see pp. 138–139) is considered by many observers to be only partially 
democratic, yet has enjoyed high levels public support for decades, largely on the 
back of its strong economic growth and welfare programmes. A further factor is 
that democratic societies tend to be liberal as well as democratic, liberal democracy 
(see p. 108) being the dominant form of democracy worldwide. Liberal societies 
offer wide opportunities for personal freedom, self-expression and social mobility, 
and these may be as important, or perhaps more important, in maintaining 
legitimacy than the opportunities that democracy offers for political participation.
Is democracy failing to deliver?
Even if democracy is accepted as the principal mechanism through which legitimacy 
is promoted, there are reasons for thinking that its effectiveness in this respect may be 
faltering. In particular, a growing number of mature democratic societies appear to be 
afflicted by a sense of political disenchantment and disaffection. This ‘democratic malaise’, 
seen by some as a crisis in democracy, has been expressed in two main ways. First, there 
has been a trend towards popular disengagement with established political processes, 
reflected in the decline in levels of political participation. Many mature democracies have 
thus experienced falls in electoral turnout, as well as declines in the membership and 
activist base of mainstream political parties. (This development is examined in greater 
detail in Chapter 11.) Second, new political forces have emerged which threaten, or at 
least sit uneasily with, conventional democratic structures. This has been evident in the 
rise of political ‘outsiders’, such as Donald Trump, and the advance, especially across much 
of Europe, of populist or anti-establishment parties and movements. The relationship 
between populism (see p. 56) and democracy is nevertheless both complex and contested.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
THE US CAPITOL INSURRECTION: A CRISIS OF LEGITIMACY
On 6 January 2021, several thousand supporters of 
presidential candidate Donald Trump, enraged at what 
they perceived to be the illegitimate election of his 
opponent Joseph Biden, descended on the United States 
Capitol building in Washington DC and stormed it in an 
attempt to halt the final certification of the 2020 election 
results. Virtually unprecedented in American history, the 
capital attacks shocked many domestic and international 
observers, and represented a new high watermark in an 
ongoing crisis of legitimacy over democratic government 
in the USA.
On one level, the Capitol insurrection highlights how 
complex the process of legitimation can be in a modern 
democracy. While David Beetham (2013) argues that 
legitimation is a matter of established rules or norms, 
rooted in shared beliefs, what happens when a society is 
deeply divided over those rules and norms, or increasingly 
struggles to find common shared beliefs? Donald Trump’s 
election in 2016 had been highly divisive in the United 
States, as it brought into sharp contrast the conflict 
between legal, traditional and charismatic authority. 
Trump’s outsider status, cavalier language, populist policies 
and lax attitude towards the rule of law outraged many, 
who saw his presidency as a contravention of long-standing 
political norms. Yet for Trump’s supporters, the established 
political system had for decades ignored their interests – 
in other words, those traditional and legal norms ought 
to be broken in order for government to return to a truly 
legitimate body that serves the public, rather than the elite.
After his loss in the 2020 election, Trump denied the 
legitimacy of the election, claiming it was ‘stolen’ by a 
shadowy elite to protect their interests and deny the will 
of the people. In an electoral system where hundreds of 
millions of votes are counted by fifty different states and 
thousands of counties, each with their own procedures 
and laws, it becomes very difficult for the public to clearly 
assess competing claims over the legitimacy of the process. 
It is made all the more impossible in a situation where a 
large part of the public trusts the charismatic authority of 
their candidate more than the legal authority of election 
officials.
Yet on another level, critical theorists might offer a broader 
perspective on the insurrection. Because although the 
catalyst was a dispute over the conduct of the election, 
the insurrection is rooted in a much broader crisis of 
legitimacy. Polls have shown that proportion of American 
who trust their government has declined dramatically, from 
77 per cent in 1964 to 20 per cent in 2022. Many theories 
have been advanced as the cause, but dissatisfaction over 
the economy and cost of living pressures, rising socio￾economic inequality and the perception of declining 
quality in health care, education and welfare support are all 
thought to be strong contributors. Habermas (see p. 90)
might argue that this is to be expected in a mature capitalist 
society like the United States, where it is increasingly 
difficult for government to both grow the economy and 
keep taxes low while delivering on basic public expectations 
for government services. Many of Trump’s supporters in 
2016 hoped that electing a radical outsider might break 
through on these issues where traditional politicians 
had failed, yet they were soon disappointed to find little 
progress made. Some argued that intransience by the 
bureaucracy and elites prevented real progress, a claim 
also advanced by Trump at various points. For those then, 
their reaction to Trump’s loss was not just about a disputed 
election, but an expression of frustration at a system that 
seems to systematically thwart outsiders and fails to make 
good on its promises. Yet for Habermas, perhaps they are 
really protesting a system that is increasingly doomed to 
fail, regardless of who nominally leads it.

9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 94 23-07-2024 12:35:27DEMOCRACY AND LEGITIMACY 95
How and why have mature democratic societies succumbed to this upsurge in 
populism? Democracy’s traditional success in generating legitimacy was linked to its 
ability, as a mechanism for dispersing power, to ensure that all individuals and groups 
had a political voice, even if this extended little beyond having the right to vote. 
Democracy, as an essentially egalitarian force, thus tended to counteract capitalism’s 
inherent tendency towards inequality. This, in practice, was achieved through the 
construction of systems of social protection, aimed at alleviating poverty and other 
forms of hardship.
However, in a process that started in the final decades of the twentieth century, 
democracy’s ability to generate legitimacy has been compromised by developments 
that have left growing sections of society feeling politically excluded and that the 
system does not ‘work’ for them. Chief among the developments have been the trend 
towards neoliberalism (see p. 178) and the advance of globalization (see p. 182).
Neoliberalism has had challenging implications for democracy, in that the shift it 
seeks to foster – away from the state and in favour of the market – has typically 
led to a widening gap between the rich and the poor. While tax cuts and financial 
deregulation have mainly benefited people who are well-off, the scaling back of 
welfare provision has tended to disadvantage people who are less well-off. As far 
as globalization is concerned, its tendency to destabilize the democratic system 
derives, in part, from the markedly reduced capacity of governments to control their 
increasingly ‘borderless’ economies. However, at least as significant has been the 
generation, especially in mature democratic societies, of new social cleavages, in 
the form of tensions between the winners and losers of the globalization process. 
The problem for democracy is that those that have lost out in the new world of 
intensified foreign competition, transnational production, increased migratory flows 
and, sometimes, global slumps are difficult to reach because they tend to believe 
that conventional political processes are biased in favour of elite or establishment 
interests. Arguably, then, this makes them susceptible to the appeal of other political 
messages and other political voices.
That said, by the same token it can also be argued that democratic regimes have been 
remarkably resilient, and far more so than most other types throughout the twentieth 
and twenty-first centuries. As argued by Tobern Iversen and David Soskice (2019), 
despite wars, economic crises, technological revolution and massive social change, 
the world’s democratic states have managed to continuously reinvent themselves and 
handle each new crisis of legitimacy – indeed, capitalism and democracy can be 
argued to have been mutually sustaining amidst centuries of upheaval which has 
seen fascist, communist, militarist and personalist regimes come and go. Though 
populism, globalization and inequality present challenges to democratic legitimacy, 
do they constitute an existential threat to it?
Non-democratic legitimacy
If democracy is taken to be the only genuine basis for legitimacy, this implies that 
non-democratic regimes are, by their nature, illegitimate. Nevertheless, some 
authoritarian regimes survive for many decades with relatively little evidence of mass 
political disaffection, still less concerted opposition. Clearly, this can very largely 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 95 23-07-2024 12:35:2796 POLITICS
be explained through the use of coercion and repression, fear rather than consent 
being the principal means through which citizens are encouraged to obey the state. 
However, non-democratic regimes rarely seek to consolidate their hold on power 
through coercion alone. They typically adopt a two-pronged approach in which 
political control is exercised alongside claims to legitimacy, and three key forms of 
non-democratic legitimation are commonly used.
Firstly, ideological legitimation has been used, either in an attempt to uphold the 
leader’s, military’s or party’s right to rule, or to establish broader goals and principles 
that invest the larger regime with a sense of rightfulness. Marxism–Leninism, 
fascism and religious fundamentalism are ideological traditions commonly used as 
sources of non-democratic legitimacy. Some dictatorial regimes go as far as to create 
entirely new ideologies to justify their continued rule. For example, while Colonel 
Muammar Gaddafi came to power in Libya through a coup in 1969, he proclaimed 
a ‘people’s revolution’ in 1973 and attempted to create a new ideological basis for 
his military regime based on nationalist, socialist, anti-imperialist and Islamic 
ideas, later published in The Green Book (1975). Ideological legitimation may also 
include appeals to traditional authority (see pp. 86–87), which may be very potent 
in highly religious or conservative societies. Theocracies (see p. 138) are regimes in 
which political legitimacy is tied to religious authority, and in which democracy is of 
secondary concern if at all (see Chapter 5).
Secondly, democratic legitimacy may be imitated through non-competitive 
elections that create an impression of popular support and to draw people into a 
ritualized acceptance of the regime. Communist East Germany even created multi￾party lists of electoral candidates to create an illusion of power-sharing amongst 
many interest groups, when in reality all candidates were hand-picked and 
ultimately subservient to the communist party. Ritualistic use of stage-managed 
elections is increasingly common in authoritarian regimes, particularly in Africa, 
and their use can be about securing international goodwill for the regime as much 
as domestic acceptance.
Finally, and perhaps most successfully, non-democratic regimes have sought to 
compensate for their lack of political rights by performance legitimation, based on 
their ability to deliver, amongst other things, rising living standards, public order, 
improved education and health care and so forth. China, for instance, has been 
described by David Bell (2016) as a ‘political meritocracy’ that emphasizes the delivery 
of a package of socio-economic benefits to their citizens and the regime’s capacity to 
generate high and sustained levels of economic growth. Indeed, some have argued 
that non-democratic regimes may enjoy advantages over democratic ones in this 
respect, not least because of their ability to undertake major projects of economic 
restructuring, resisting the pressures generated by short-term unpopularity in the 
hope of giving long-term rewards. However, many examples in this category are also 
buttressed by special circumstances. Brunei, for instance, is one of the last absolute 
monarchies in the world and allows very little public participation in government 
or opposition to the monarchy. However, this small country has become extremely 
wealthy through oil exports, allowing the government to dramatically improve 
living standards and construct a welfare state in which citizens pay no tax, have free

education and health care, and very cheap access to housing and energy. Combined 
with the Sultan’s very public association with the religious, cultural and moral 
traditions of the country, the legitimacy of Brunei’s regime is little questioned by 
its subjects. While few countries have this luxury, examples such as this highlight 
the fact that while democratic legitimacy may prevail as the international norm, 
pragmatic and material considerations cannot be ignored.
DEMOCRACY
Understanding democracy
Debates about democracy extend well beyond its relationship to legitimacy. These 
stem, most basically, from confusion over the nature of democracy. The origins of 
the term ‘democracy’ can be traced back to Ancient Greece. Democracy is derived 
from the Greek word kratos, meaning power, or rule. Democracy means ‘rule by 
the demos’ or ‘the people’, although the Greeks originally used demos to mean ‘the 
poor’ or ‘the many’. However, the simple notion of ‘rule by the people’ does not get 
us very far. The problem with democracy has been its very popularity, a popularity 
that has threatened the term’s undoing as a meaningful political concept. In Bernard 
Crick’s (1962) words, ‘democracy is perhaps the most promiscuous word in the 
world of public affairs’. A term that can mean anything to anyone is in danger of 
meaning nothing at all. Amongst the meanings that have been attached to the word 
‘democracy’ are the following:
 a form of government in which the people rule themselves directly and 
continuously, without the need for professional politicians or public officials
 a society based on equal opportunity and individual merit, rather than hierarchy 
and privilege
 a system of welfare and redistribution aimed at narrowing social inequalities
 a system of decision-making based on the principle of majority rule
 a system of rule that secures the rights and interests of minorities by placing 
checks upon the power of the majority
 a means of filling public offices through a competitive struggle for the popular vote
 a system of government that serves the interests of the people regardless of their 
participation in political life.
Perhaps a more helpful starting point from which to consider the nature of democracy 
is Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address (1863). Lincoln extolled the virtues of 
what he called ‘government of the people, by the people, and for the people’. What 
this makes clear is that democracy links government to the people, but that this 
link can be forged in a number of ways: government of, by and for the people. This 
section explores the implications of these links by considering three questions. Who 
are the people? In what sense should the people rule? And how far should popular 
rule extend?

Who are the people?
One of the core features of democracy is the principle of political equality, the 
notion that political power should be distributed as widely and as evenly as possible. 
However, within what body or group should this power be distributed? In short, who 
constitutes ‘the people’? On the face of it, the answer is simple: ‘the people’ surely 
refers to all the people; that is, the entire population of the country. In practice, 
however, every democratic system has restricted political participation, sometimes 
severely.
As noted, early Greek writers usually used demos to refer to ‘the many’: that is, 
the disadvantaged and usually propertyless masses. Democracy therefore implied 
not political equality, but a bias towards the poor. In Greek city-states, political 
participation was restricted to a tiny proportion of the population, male citizens 
over the age of twenty, thereby excluding all women, slaves and foreigners. Strict 
restrictions on voting also existed in most Western states until well into the twentieth 
century, usually in the form of a property qualification or the exclusion of women or 
ethnic minorities. The first country to grant all adults the right to vote regardless of 
sex or ethnicity was New Zealand in 1893. Racial voting equality was not achieved 
in the United States until 1965, and women’s suffrage was not granted everywhere 
in Switzerland until 1990. While most democracies today proclaim to have achieved 
universal suffrage by enfranchising all adults regardless of sex, race or class, there is 
still fierce debate as to whether this is true. Voting age, for instance, remains fiercely 
contested. Traditionally, the most common age to receive voting rights was twenty￾one, though it has dropped to eighteen in most places since the 1970s, and as low 
as sixteen in Cuba, Malta and Austria. Immigrants, emigrants, convicted criminals, 
the mentally incompetent and even unborn generations also raise thorny questions 
over how freely the right to vote should be given and whether it can be taken away 
(Beckman 2009).
And although ‘the people’ is now accepted as meaning virtually all adult citizens, the 
term can be construed in a number of different ways. The people, for instance, can be 
viewed as a single, cohesive body, bound together by a common or collective interest: 
in this sense, the people are one and indivisible. Such a view tends to generate a model 
of democracy that, like Rousseau’s theories (see p. 105), focuses upon the ‘general 
will’ rather than the ‘private will’ of each individual. Alternatively, as division and 
disagreement exist within all communities, ‘the people’ may in practice be taken to 
mean ‘the majority’. In this case, democracy comes to mean the strict application of 
the principle of majority rule, and yet this can also turn democracy into a ‘tyranny 
of the majority’. Although, thanks to the potency of political nationalism, ‘the people’ 
today is usually understood in national terms, the ideas of local democracy and, in 
the light of globalization (see p. 182), cosmopolitan democracy (discussed in the 
final section of the chapter) have also been advanced.
How should the people rule?
Most conceptions of democracy are based on the principle of ‘government by the 
people’. This implies that the people govern themselves – that they participate in 
making the crucial decisions that structure their lives and determine the fate of 
Universal suffrage: The 
idea that as many people 
as possible who are 
subject to the laws and 
powers of a government 
have a right to vote in its 
elections and participate 
in its political life.
Majority rule: The 
rule that the will of the 
majority, or numerically 
strongest, overrides 
the will of the minority, 
implying that the latter 
should accept the views of 
the former.
Cosmopolitan democracy:
A form of democracy that 
operates at supranational 
levels of governance and 
is based on the idea of 
transnational or global 
citizenship.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 98 23-07-2024 12:35:27DEMOCRACY AND LEGITIMACY 99
their society. This participation can take a number of forms, however. In the case of 
direct democracy, popular participation entails direct and continuous involvement 
in decision-making, through devices such as referendums (see p. 248), mass 
meetings or even interactive television.
The alternative and more common form of democratic participation is the act 
of voting, which is the central feature of what is usually called representative 
democracy. When citizens vote, they do not so much make the decisions that 
structure their own lives as choose who will make those decisions on their behalf. 
What gives voting its democratic character is that, provided that the election is 
competitive, it empowers the public to vote out governments or representatives 
who do not serve their interests, and thus makes politicians publicly accountable. 
However, exactly what the public is voting for and who is being held accountable 
is rarely clear-cut in an election. Attitudes towards national issues, party politics 
or specific leaders may heavily influence voter behaviour, irrespective of the office 
they happen to be voting for. Local elections in countries like the USA and UK, for 
instance, increasingly reflect the popularity of national parties and leaders rather 
than local issues or representatives, leading some to claim that now ‘all politics 
is national’ (Hopkins 2018). Moreover, historically the rate at which democratic 
representatives are voted out through elections is relatively low. In Austria, the 
Netherlands and Belgium, for example, at most elections since 1945, 80 to 90 per 
cent of legislators were re-elected. Elected politicians were much more likely leave 
office voluntarily or to be replaced by their own parties, rather than to be voted out 
(Gouglas and Maddens 2017). Is this a reflection of public satisfaction with their 
legislators? Or the limitations of representative democracy?
There are also models of democracy that are built on the principle of ‘government 
for the people’, and that allow little scope for public participation of any kind, 
direct or indirect. The most grotesque example of this was found in the so-called 
totalitarian (see p. 78) democracies that developed under fascist dictators such as 
Mussolini and Hitler. The democratic credentials of such regimes were based on 
the claim that the leader, and the leader alone, articulated the genuine interests of 
the people, thus implying that a ‘true’ democracy can be equated with an absolute 
dictatorship. In such cases, popular rule meant nothing more than ritualized 
submission to the will of an all-powerful leader, orchestrated through rallies, 
marches and demonstrations.
Although totalitarian democracies have proved to be a travesty of the conventional 
notion of democratic rule, they demonstrate the tension that can exist between 
‘government by the people’ (or popular participation), and ‘government for the 
people’ (rule in the public interest). Advocates of representative democracy, for 
example, have wished to confine popular participation in politics to the act of voting, 
precisely because they fear that the general public lack the wisdom, education and 
experience to rule wisely on their own behalf.
How far should popular rule extend?
Now that we have considered who the people are and how they should rule, it is 
necessary to consider how far their rule should extend. What is the proper realm

FOCUS ON . . . 
DIRECT DEMOCRACY OR REPRESENTATIVE 
DEMOCRACY?
Direct democracy (sometimes ‘participatory’ or ‘radical’ democracy) is based on the direct, 
unmediated and continuous participation of citizens in the tasks of government. Direct 
democracy thus obliterates the distinction between government and the governed, and 
between the state and civil society; it is a system of popular self-government. It was achieved 
in ancient Athens through a form of government by mass meeting; its most common modern 
manifestation is the use of the referendum (see p. 248). The merits of direct democracy 
include the following:
 It heightens the control that citizens can exercise over their own destinies, as it is the only 
pure form of democracy.
 It creates a better-informed and more politically sophisticated citizenry, and thus it has 
educational benefits.
 It enables the public to express their own views and interests without having to rely on 
self-serving politicians.
 It ensures that rule is legitimate, in the sense that people are more likely to accept 
decisions that they have made themselves.
Representative democracy is a limited and indirect form of democracy. It is limited in that 
popular participation in government is infrequent and brief, being restricted to the act of 
voting every few years. It is indirect in that the public do not exercise power themselves; 
they merely select those who will rule on their behalf. This form of rule is democratic only 
insofar as representation (see p. 243) establishes a reliable and effective link between the 
government and the governed. This is sometimes expressed in the notion of an electoral 
mandate (see p. 247). The strengths of representative democracy include the following:
 It offers a practicable form of democracy (direct popular participation is achievable only 
in small communities).
 It relieves ordinary citizens of the burden of decision-making, thus making possible a 
division of labour in politics.
 It allows government to be placed in the hands of those with better education, expert 
knowledge and greater experience.
 It maintains stability by distancing ordinary citizens from politics, thereby encouraging 
them to accept compromise.
of democracy? What issues is it right for the people to decide, and what should be 
left to individual citizens? In many respects, such questions reopen the debate about 
the proper relationship between the public realm and the private realm that was 
discussed in Chapter 1. Models of democracy that have been constructed on liberal 
individualism have usually proposed that democracy be restricted to a narrowly 
defined realm of political life. From this perspective, the purpose of democracy is to 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 100 23-07-2024 12:35:27DEMOCRACY AND LEGITIMACY 101
establish, through some process of popular participation, a framework of laws within 
which individuals can conduct their own affairs and pursue their private interests. 
Democratic solutions, then, are appropriate only for matters that specifically relate to 
the community; used in other circumstances, democracy amounts to an infringement 
of liberty. Not uncommonly, this fear of democracy is most acute in the case of direct 
or participatory democracy (see p. 102).
However, an alternative view of democracy is often developed by, for example, 
socialists and radical democrats. In radical democracy, democracy is seen not as 
a means of laying down a framework within which individuals can go about their 
own business but, rather, as a general principle that is applicable to all areas of social 
existence. People are seen as having a basic right to participate in the making of any 
decisions that affect their lives, with democracy simply being the collective process 
through which this is done. This position is evident in socialist demands for the 
collectivization of wealth and the introduction of workers’ self-management, both 
of which are seen as ways of democratizing economic life. Instead of endorsing 
mere political democracy, socialists have therefore called for economic democracy. 
Feminists, similarly, have demanded the democratization of family life, understood 
as the right of all to participate in the making of decisions in the domestic or private 
sphere. From this perspective, democracy is regarded as a friend of liberty, not as 
its enemy. Only when such principles are ignored can oppression and exploitation 
flourish.
The appropriate extent of popular rule is thrown into sharp relief when the subject of 
civil rights is considered. As John Stuart Mill (see p. 245) warned in On Liberty (1859), 
democratic rule can become what Alexis de Tocqueville (see p. 299) described as 
‘tyranny of the majority’ that results in the oppression of minorities and vulnerable 
groups. For instance, since the 2000s, many jurisdictions around the world have 
faced the question of whether to extend marriage rights to include same-sex couples. 
In some countries, this question has played out in the courts, in others through 
elected legislatures and in some countries the public at large has voted on the issue 
through referendums. The appropriateness of these methods is fiercely debated. 
For many supporters, same-sex marriage is a question of human rights – as such, it 
should be beyond democratic consideration, as human rights are eternal regardless 
of public opinion. For opponents, though, same-sex marriage is not a human right 
but a matter of social policy, and one that may contravene long-standing cultural 
or religious tradition. As such, it should be subject to public approval, rather than 
establishment by unelected elites.
Models of democracy
In response to some of the key questions as to the appropriate nature, role and extent 
of democracy in a political system, there are a number of rival theories or models of 
democracy, each offering its own version of popular rule. This highlights not merely 
the variety of democratic forms and mechanisms but also, more fundamentally, 
the very different grounds on which democratic rule can be justified. Even ‘liberal 
democracy’ (see p. 108) is a misleading term, as competing liberal views of

CONCEPT
Political equality
Political equality means, 
broadly, an equal 
distribution of political 
power and influence. 
Political equality can 
thus be thought of as 
the core principle of 
democracy, in that it 
ensures that, however 
‘the people’ is defined, 
each individual member 
carries the same weight: 
all voices are equally 
loud. This can be 
understood in two ways. 
In liberal-democratic 
theory, political equality 
implies an equal 
distribution of political 
rights: the right to vote, 
the right to stand for 
election and so on. In 
contrast, socialists, 
amongst others, link 
political influence to 
factors such as the 
control of economic 
resources and access 
to the means of mass 
communication.

democratic organization can be identified. Four contrasting models of democracy 
can be identified as follows:
 classical democracy
 limited or ‘protective’ democracy
 developmental democracy
 people’s or ‘socialist’ democracy.
Classical democracy
The classical model of democracy is based on the polis, or city-state, of Ancient Greece, 
and particularly on the system of rule that developed in the most influential Greek 
city-state, Athens. The form of direct democracy that operated in Athens during the 
fourth and fifth centuries bce is often portrayed as the only pure or ideal system of 
popular participation. Nevertheless, although the model had considerable impact on 
later thinkers such as Rousseau and Marx, Athenian democracy developed a very 
particular kind of direct popular rule, one that has only a very limited application in 
the modern world. Athenian democracy amounted to a form of government by mass 
meeting.
What made Athenian democracy so remarkable was the level of political activity of 
its citizens. Not only did they participate in regular meetings of the Assembly, but 
they were also, in large numbers, prepared to shoulder the responsibility of public 
office and decision-making. The most influential contemporaneous critic of this 
form of democracy was the philosopher Plato (see p. 13). Plato attacked the principle 
of political equality on the grounds that the mass of the people possess neither the 
wisdom nor the experience to rule wisely on their own behalf. His solution, advanced 
in The Republic, was that government be placed in the hands of a class of philosopher 
kings, whose rule would amount to a kind of enlightened dictatorship.
On a practical level, however, the principal drawback of Athenian democracy was 
that it could operate only by excluding the mass of the population from political 
activity. Participation was restricted to Athenian-born males who were over twenty 
years of age. Slaves (the majority of the population), women and foreigners had no 
political rights whatsoever. Indeed, Athenian citizens were able to devote so much 
of their lives to politics only because slavery relieved them of the need to engage 
in arduous labour, and the confinement of women to the private realm freed men 
from domestic responsibilities. The mass meeting model of democratic decision￾making has appeared periodically throughout history, from the Viking and Saxon 
things of the Middle Ages, to the town hall meetings of colonial New England in the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, to the popular assemblies that still operate in 
some cantons to Switzerland today (see p. 254).
Limited or ‘protective’ democracy
When democratic ideas were revived in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
they appeared in a form that was very different from the classical democracy of 
Ancient Greece. In particular, democracy was seen less as a mechanism through 
CONCEPT
Athenian 
democracy
Athenian democracy 
is characterized by the 
high level of citizen 
involvement in the 
affairs of the city-state. 
Major decisions were 
made by the Assembly, 
or Ecclesia, to which all 
citizens belonged. When 
full-time public officials 
were needed, they were 
chosen on a basis of 
lot or rota to ensure 
that they constituted a 
microcosm of the larger 
citizenry. A Council, 
consisting of 500 
citizens, acted as the 
executive or steering 
committee of the 
Assembly, and a fifty￾strong Committee, in 
turn, made proposals 
to the Council. The 
President of the 
Committee held office 
for only a single day, and 
no Athenian could hold 
this honour more than 
once in his lifetime.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 102 23-07-2024 12:35:27DEMOCRACY AND LEGITIMACY 103
which the public could participate in political life, and more as a device through 
which citizens could protect themselves from the encroachments of government. 
This view appealed particularly to early liberal thinkers whose concern was, above 
all, to create the widest realm of individual liberty. The desire to protect the individual 
from over-mighty government was expressed in perhaps the earliest of all democratic 
sentiments, Aristotle’s response to Plato: ‘who will guard the guardians?’
This same concern with unchecked power was taken up in the seventeenth century 
by John Locke (see p. 32), who argued that the right to vote was based on the 
existence of natural rights and particularly the right to property. If government, 
through taxation, possessed the power to expropriate property, citizens were entitled 
to protect themselves by controlling the composition of the tax-setting body: the 
legislature. In other words, democracy came to mean a system of ‘government by 
consent’ operating through a representative assembly. However, Locke himself was 
not a democrat by modern standards, as he believed that only property owners 
should vote, on the basis that only they had natural rights that could be infringed by 
government. The more radical notion of universal suffrage was advanced from the 
late eighteenth century onwards by utilitarian theorists such as Jeremy Bentham and 
James Mill (1773–1836). The utilitarian (see p. 104) case for democracy is also based 
on the need to protect or advance individual interests. Bentham came to believe that, 
since all individuals seek pleasure and the avoidance of pain, a universal franchise 
(conceived in his day as manhood suffrage) was the only way of promoting ‘the 
greatest happiness for the greatest number’.
However, to justify democracy on protective grounds is to provide only a 
qualified endorsement of democratic rule. In short, protective democracy is 
but a limited and indirect form of democracy. In practice, the consent of the 
governed is exercised through voting in regular and competitive elections. This 
thereby ensures the accountability of those who govern. Political equality is thus 
understood in strictly technical terms to mean equal voting rights. Moreover, this 
is, above all, a system of constitutional democracy that operates within a set of 
formal or informal rules that check the exercise of government power. If the right 
to vote is a means of defending individual liberty, liberty must also be guaranteed 
by a strictly enforced separation of powers via the creation of a separate executive, 
legislature and judiciary, and by the maintenance of basic rights and freedoms, 
such as freedom of expression, freedom of movement and freedom from arbitrary 
arrest. Ultimately, protective democracy aims to give citizens the widest possible 
scope to live their lives as they choose. It is therefore compatible with laissez￾faire capitalism (see p. 170, 173) and the belief that individuals should be entirely 
responsible for their economic and social circumstances. Protective democracy 
has therefore particularly appealed to classical liberals and, in modern politics, to 
supporters of the New Right.
Developmental democracy
Although early democratic theory focused on the need to protect individual 
rights and interests, it soon developed an alternative focus: a concern with the 
development of the human individual and the community. This gave rise to quite 
Natural rights: God￾given rights that are 
fundamental to human 
beings and are therefore 
inalienable (they cannot 
be taken away).
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 103 23-07-2024 12:35:27104 POLITICS
new models of democratic rule that can broadly be referred to as systems of 
developmental democracy. The most novel, and radical, such model was developed 
by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In many respects, Rousseau’s ideas mark a departure 
from the dominant, liberal conception of democracy, and they came to have an 
impact on the Marxist and anarchist traditions as well as, later, on the New Left. For 
Rousseau, democracy was ultimately a means through which human beings could 
achieve freedom (see p. 332) or autonomy, in the sense of ‘obedience to a law one 
prescribes to oneself ’. In other words, citizens are ‘free’ only when they participate 
directly and continuously in shaping the life of their community. This is an idea 
that moves well beyond the conventional notion of electoral democracy and offers 
support for the more radical ideal of direct democracy. Indeed, Rousseau was a 
strenuous critic of the practice of elections used in England, arguing in The Social 
Contract (1762) as follows:
The English people believes itself to be free, it is gravely mistaken; it is only free 
when it elects its member of parliament; as soon as they are elected, the people 
are enslaved; it is nothing. In the brief moment of its freedom, the English people 
makes such use of its freedom that it deserves to lose it.
However, what gives Rousseau’s model its novel character is his insistence that 
freedom ultimately means obedience to the general will. Rousseau believed the 
general will to be the ‘true’ will of each citizen, in contrast to his or her ‘private’ 
or selfish will. By obeying the general will, citizens are therefore doing nothing 
more than obeying their own ‘true’ natures, the general will being what individuals 
would desire if they were to act selflessly. In Rousseau’s view, such a system of radical 
developmental democracy required not merely political equality, but a relatively 
high level of economic equality. Although not a supporter of common ownership, 
Rousseau nevertheless proposed that ‘no citizen shall be rich enough to buy another 
and none so poor as to be forced to sell himself ’ (Rousseau [1762] 2009).

JEREMY BENTHAM (1748–1832)
UK philosopher, legal reformer and founder of utilitarianism. Bentham developed a moral 
and philosophical system that was based on the idea that human beings are rationally self￾interested creatures or utility maximizers, which he believed provided a scientific basis for legal 
and political reforms. Using the ‘greatest happiness’ principle, his followers, the Philosophic 
Radicals, were responsible for many of the reforms in social administration, law, government 
and economics in the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century. A supporter of laissez-faire
economics, in later life Bentham also became a firm advocate of political democracy. His 
utilitarian creed was developed in Fragments on Government (1776), and more fully in Principles 
of Morals and Legislation (1789).

Rousseau’s theories have helped to shape the modern idea of democracy taken up by 
New Left thinkers in the 1960s and 1970s. This extols the virtues of a ‘participatory 
society’, a society in which each and every citizen is able to achieve self-development 
by participating in the decisions that shape his or her life. This goal can be achieved 
only through the promotion of openness, accountability and decentralization within 
all the key institutions of society. At the heart of this model is the notion of ‘grass￾roots democracy’; that is, the belief that political power should be exercised at the 
lowest possible level. Nevertheless, Rousseau’s own theories have been criticized 
for distinguishing between citizens’ ‘true’ wills and their ‘felt’ or subjective wills. 
The danger of this is that, if the general will cannot be established by simply asking 
citizens what they want, there is scope for the general will to be defined from above, 
perhaps by a dictator claiming to act in the ‘true’ interests of society. Rousseau is 
therefore sometimes seen as the unintentional architect of so-called ‘totalitarian 
democracy’ (Talmon 1952).
However, a more modest form of developmental democracy has also been advanced 
that is compatible with the liberal model of representative government. This view 
of developmental democracy is rooted in the writings of John Stuart Mill (see p.
245). For Mill, the central virtue of democracy is that it promotes the ‘highest and 
harmonious’ development of individual capacities. By participating in political 
life, citizens enhance their understanding, strengthen their sensibilities and 
achieve a higher level of personal development. In short, democracy is essentially 
an educational experience. As a result, Mill proposed the broadening of popular 
participation, arguing that the franchise should be extended to all but those who are 
illiterate. In the process, he suggested (radically, for his time) that suffrage should 
also be extended to women. In addition, he advocated strong and independent 
local authorities in the belief that this would broaden the opportunities available for 
holding public office.

JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU (1712–78)
Geneva-born French moral and political philosopher. Rousseau was entirely self-taught. 
He moved to Paris in 1742, and became an intimate of leading members of the French 
Enlightenment, especially Diderot. His writings, ranging over education, the arts, science, 
literature and philosophy, reflect a deep belief in the goodness of ‘natural man’ and the corruption 
of ‘social man’. Rousseau’s political teaching, summarized in Émile (1762) and developed in 
The Social Contract (1762), advocates a radical form of democracy that has influenced liberal, 
socialist, anarchist and, some would argue, fascist thought. His autobiography, Confessions
(1770), examines his life with remarkable candour and demonstrates a willingness to expose 
weaknesses.

On the other hand, Mill, in common with all liberals, was also aware of the dangers 
of democracy. Indeed, Mill’s views are out of step with mainstream liberal thought 
in that he rejected the idea of formal political equality. Following Plato, Mill did not 
believe that all political opinions are of equal value. Consequently, he proposed a 
system of plural voting: unskilled workers would have a single vote, skilled workers 
two votes and graduates and members of the learned professions five or six votes. 
Mill’s particular concern was that democracy would undermine debate, criticism 
and intellectual life in general by encouraging people to accept the will of the 
majority, thereby promoting uniformity and dull conformism. Quite simply, the 
majority is not always right; wisdom cannot be determined by the simple device of a 
show of hands. Mill’s ideas therefore support the idea of deliberative democracy or 
parliamentary democracy.
Deliberation may take place on either a micro or a macro level. Micro deliberation 
occurs at a set time and place and usually involves face-to-face interaction, with 
examples including parliamentary debates, committee meetings, town hall 
gatherings and so on. Macro deliberation is deliberation that takes place in the wider 
public sphere; it is an ongoing and dispersed process that comprises, for instance, 
public debate, the free media and interest-group lobbying.
However, deliberation can only be said to have a democratic character if it 
involves all citizens who are substantially affected by the issue or question under 
consideration, and their participation is both free and meets at least minimal 
standards of equality (Chappell 2012). Among the arguments advanced in favour 
of deliberative democracy are that engagement in reasoned and reciprocal debate 
encourages citizens to better appreciate the viewpoints and preferences of others, 
so fostering consensus, if not unanimity, and that the ‘unforced force of the better 
argument’ helps to bring policy-making in line with the public interest (Steiner 
2012). Critics of deliberative democracy nevertheless claim, among other things, 
that, as deliberation typically favours the views of better-educated citizens who are 
skilled in the arts of persuasion, it tends to promote exclusion and inequality in 
practice.
People’s or ‘socialist’ democracy
The term ‘people’s democracy’ is derived from the orthodox communist regimes that 
sprang up on the Soviet model in the aftermath of the Second World War. It is here 
used, however, to refer broadly to the various democratic models that the Marxist 
tradition has generated. Although they differ, these models offer a clear contrast to the 
more familiar liberal-democratic ones. Marxists have tended to be dismissive of liberal 
democracy, seeing it as a form of ‘bourgeois’ or ‘capitalist’ democracy. Nevertheless, 
Marxists were drawn to the concept or ideal of democracy because of its clear egalitarian 
implications. The term was used to designate the goal of social equality brought about 
through the common ownership of wealth (‘social democracy’ in its original sense), in 
contrast to ‘political’ democracy, which establishes only a façade of equality.
Marx believed that the overthrow of capitalism would be a trigger that would allow 
genuine democracy to flourish. In his view, a fully communist society would come

that emphasizes the need 
for reasoned discussion 
and debate to help to 
formulate legitimate 
political outcomes.

into existence only after a transitionary period characterized by ‘the revolutionary 
dictatorship of the proletariat’. In effect, a system of ‘bourgeois’ democracy would 
be replaced by a very different system of ‘proletarian’ democracy. Although Marx 
refused to describe in detail how this transitionary society would be organized, 
its broad shape can be discerned from his admiration for the Paris Commune 
of 1871, which was a short-lived experiment in what approximated to direct 
democracy.
The form of democracy that was developed in twentieth-century communist 
states, however, owed more to the ideas of V. I. Lenin than it did to those of Marx. 
Although Lenin’s 1917 slogan ‘All power to the Soviets’ (the workers’ and soldiers’ 
and sailors’ councils) had kept alive the notion of commune democracy, in reality 
power in Soviet Russia quickly fell into the hands of the Bolshevik party (soon 
renamed the Communist Party). Armed with Marxism, the party claimed that it 
was able to perceive the genuine interests of the proletariat and thus guide it to the 
realization of its revolutionary potential. This theory became the cornerstone of 
‘Leninist democracy’, and it was accepted by all other orthodox communist regimes 
as one of the core features of Marxism–Leninism. However, Leninist thinking about 
democracy has by no means commanded universal support within Marxism. For 
example, Rosa Luxemburg (see p. 111) associated the notion of the vanguard party 
with the problem of ‘substitutionism’, in which a ruling party substitutes itself for 
the proletariat and, eventually, a supreme leader substitutes himself or herself for 
the party.

Russian Marxist theorist and active revolutionary. As leader of the Bolsheviks, Lenin 
masterminded the 1917 Russian Revolution, and became the first leader of the USSR. His

in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916); and his firm commitment to the 
‘insurrectionary road to socialism’, developed in State and Revolution (1917). Lenin’s reputation

Democracy in practice: rival views
Although there continues to be controversy about which is the most desirable form 
of democracy, much of contemporary debate revolves around how democracy works 
in practice and what ‘democratization’ (see p. 135) implies. This reflects the fact that 
there is broad, even worldwide, acceptance of a particular model of democracy, 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 107 23-07-2024 12:35:27108 POLITICS
generally termed liberal democracy. Despite competing tendencies within this broad 
category, certain central features are clear:
 Liberal democracy is an indirect and representative form of democracy, in that 
political office is gained through success in regular elections that are conducted 
on the basis of formal political equality.
 It is based on competition and electoral choice. These are achieved through political 
pluralism, tolerance of a wide range of contending beliefs, and the existence of 
conflicting social philosophies and rival political movements and parties.
 It is characterized by a clear distinction between the state and civil society. This 
is maintained through the existence of autonomous groups and interests, and the 
market or capitalist organization of economic life.
 It provides protection for minorities and individuals, particularly through the 
allocation of basic rights that safeguard them from the will of the majority.
Nevertheless, there is a considerable amount of disagreement about the meaning 
and significance of liberal democracy. Does it, for instance, ensure a genuine and 
healthy dispersal of political power? Do democratic processes genuinely promote 
long-term benefits, or are they self-defeating? Can political equality coexist with 
economic inequality? In short, this form of democracy is interpreted in different 
ways by different theorists. The most important of these interpretations are 
advanced by:
 pluralism
 elitism
 corporatism.
Pluralist view
Pluralist ideas can be traced back to early liberal political philosophy, and notably to 
the ideas of Locke and Montesquieu (see p. 375). Their first systematic development, 
however, is found in the contributions of James Madison (see p. 384) to The 
Federalist Papers (1787–9). In considering the transformation of America from a 
loose confederation of states into the federal nation-state, Madison’s particular fear 
was the ‘problem of factions’. In common with most liberals, Madison argued that 
unchecked democratic rule might simply lead to majoritarianism, to the crushing 
of individual rights and to the expropriation of property in the name of the people. 
What made Madison’s work notable, however, was his stress upon the multiplicity 
of interests and groups in society, and his insistence that, unless each such group 
possessed a political voice, stability and order would be impossible. He therefore 
proposed a system of divided government based on the separation of powers (see 
p. 377), bicameralism (see pp. 383–385) and federalism (see p. 430), that offered a 
variety of access points to competing groups and interests. The resulting system of 
rule by multiple minorities is often referred to as ‘Madisonian democracy’. Insofar 
as it recognizes both the existence of diversity or multiplicity in society, and the fact 
that such multiplicity is desirable, Madison’s model is the first developed statement 
of pluralist principles.
CONCEPT
Liberal democracy
A liberal democracy 
is a political regime 
in which a ‘liberal’ 
commitment to limited 
government is blended 
with a ‘democratic’ belief 
in popular rule. Its key 
features are: (1) the 
right to rule is gained 
through success in 
regular and competitive 
elections, based on 
universal adult suffrage; 
(2) constraints on 
government imposed 
by a constitution, 
institutional checks 
and balances, and 
protections for individual 
and minority rights; 
and (3) a vigorous 
civil society including 
a private enterprise 
economy, independent 
trade unions and a 
free press. The terms 
liberal democracy and 
pluralist democracy 
(see p. *) are often used 
interchangeably.
Madisonian democracy:
A form of democracy that 
incorporates constitutional 
protections for minorities 
that enable them to resist 
majority rule.

The most influential modern exponent of pluralist theory is Robert Dahl (see p.
303). As described in Who Governs? Democracy and Power in an American City
(1961), Dahl carried out an empirical study of the distribution of power in New 
Haven, Connecticut, USA. He concluded that, although the politically privileged 
and economically powerful exerted greater power than ordinary citizens, no ruling 
or permanent elite was able to dominate the political process. His conclusion 
was that ‘New Haven is an example of a democratic system, warts and all’ (Dahl 
1961). Dahl recognized that modern democratic systems differ markedly from the 
classical democracies of Ancient Greece. With Charles Lindblom, he coined the 
term ‘polyarchy’ (see p. 125) to mean rule by the many, as distinct from rule by all 
citizens. The key feature of such a system of pluralist democracy is that competition 
between parties at election time, and the ability of interest or pressure groups to 
articulate their views freely, establishes a reliable link between the government and 
the governed, and creates a channel of communication between the two. While this 
may fall a long way short of the ideal of popular self-government, its supporters 
nevertheless argue that it ensures a sufficient level of accountability and popular 
responsiveness for it to be regarded as democratic.
However, the relationship between pluralism and democracy may not be a secure 
one. For instance, one of the purposes of the Madisonian system was, arguably, to 
constrain democracy in the hope of safeguarding property. In other words, the system 
of rule by multiple minorities may simply have been a device to prevent the majority 
(the propertyless masses) from exercising political power. A further problem is the 
danger of what has been called ‘pluralist stagnation’. In a pluralist system where many 
diverse interests exist with roughly equal power, it becomes increasingly challenging 
to make decisions or set policies that will please a majority of those interests. In 
such circumstances, a kind of political paralysis can set in where change or reform is 
very difficult to secure (Beer 1982). Finally, there is the problem identified by Dahl 
in later works, such as A Preface to Economic Democracy (1985); notably, that the 
unequal ownership of economic resources tends to concentrate political power in 
the hands of the few, and deprive the many of it. This line of argument runs parallel 
to the conventional Marxist critique of pluralist democracy and has given rise to 
neopluralism (see p. 67).
Elitist view
Elitism (see p. 111) developed as a critique of egalitarian ideas such as democracy 
and socialism. It draws attention to the fact of elite rule, either as an inevitable and 
desirable feature of social existence, or as a remediable and regrettable one. Classical 
elitists, such as Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923), Gaetano Mosca (1857–1941) and Robert 
Michels (1876–1936), tended to take the former position. For them, democracy was 
no more than a foolish delusion, because political power is always exercised by a 
privileged minority: an elite. For example, in The Ruling Class, Mosca proclaimed 
that, in all societies, ‘two classes of people appear – a class that rules and a class that 
is ruled’ (1896). In his view, the resources or attributes that are necessary for rule are 
always unequally distributed, and, further, a cohesive minority will always be able 
to manipulate and control the masses, even in a parliamentary democracy. Pareto 
suggested that the qualities needed to rule conform to one of two psychological types: 
CONCEPT
Pluralism
In its broad sense, 
pluralism is a belief in, 
or a commitment to, 
diversity or multiplicity. 
As a descriptive term, 
pluralism may be used 
to denote the existence 
of party competition 
(political pluralism), 
a multiplicity of 
moral values (ethical 
pluralism) or a variety 
of cultural norms 
(cultural pluralism). As 
a normative term, it 
suggests that diversity 
is healthy and desirable, 
usually because it 
safeguards individual 
liberty and promotes 
debate, argument and 
understanding. More 
narrowly, pluralism 
is a theory of the 
distribution of political 
power. It holds that 
power is widely and 
evenly dispersed in 
society.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_4.indd 109 23-07-2024 12:35:27110 POLITICS
‘foxes’ (who rule by cunning and are able to manipulate the consent of the masses), 
and ‘lions’ (whose domination is typically achieved through coercion and violence).
Robert Michels in Political Parties (1911) developed an alternative line of argument 
based on the tendency within all organizations, however democratic they might 
appear, for power to be concentrated in the hands of a small group of dominant 
figures. He termed this ‘the iron law of oligarchy’ (see p. *). Michels argues that 
while classical or true democracy may be possible in small groups, once any body 
reaches a certain size, direct democracy becomes functionally impossible, and an 
administrative or leadership class must inevitably emerge to manage and make 
decisions. No matter how well intentioned, this leadership class in turn will inevitably 
come to hold most of the power within the organization or group, often with little 
real accountability due to the apathy, non-participation or ignorance of most of the 
rank-and-file. In this sense, democracy is only a theoretical check on the power of 
elites – in practice, it rarely occurs. This idea was famously demonstrated from the 
perspective of public choice theory (see p. 306) by Mancur Olson Jr. In The Logic of 
Collective Action (1965), he noted that the larger and more diverse a group is, the 
harder and more expensive it is for them to organize and act collectively. Moreover, 
as the benefits from any potential change will be diffusely spread over a large group, 
the incentive to act is lower than for smaller groups, for whom the benefits will be 
more concentrated. Michels and Olson turn the ‘tyranny of the majority’ concept on 
its head – by their logic, it is in fact small, organized elites that will almost inevitably 
dominate over large, diverse societies.
Classical Marxism offers a similar critique of democracy, insofar as most orthodox 
Marxists see any capitalist democratic system as having economic power too 
thoroughly concentrated in the hands of capitalist class for democracy to act as 
a genuine check on elites or for the public to meaningfully shape society. While 
elite theorists posit a variety of reasons, like education, social status or tradition 
as providing a basis for an elite to emerge in a society, Marxists concentrate more 
squarely on those who control the means of production and economic power in a 
society as being most able to steer the political system – a ‘ruling class’. However, 
there have long been divergent strands of Marxist and socialist thought with 
regards to the nature of electoral democracy. Orthodox Marxists, and eventually 
those who advocated revolutionary communism, argue that the ruling class is too 
deeply entrenched in capitalist societies for democratic change to be possible, and 
hence only an overthrow of the system can produce genuine change to liberate 
the oppressed classes. More moderate left-wing theorists, however, disagreed, and 
through what became democratic socialism sought to curb the power of the ruling 
class and redistribute wealth through electoral means.
Whereas Marxists and classical elitists strove to prove that democracy was always a 
myth, modern elitist theorists have tended to highlight how far particular political 
systems fall short of the democratic ideal. An example of this can be found in C. 
Wright Mills’ (1916–62) influential account of the power structure in the USA. 
In contrast to the pluralist notion of a wide and broadly democratic dispersal of 
power, Mills, in The Power Elite (1956), offered a portrait of a USA dominated by 
a nexus of leading groups. In his view, this ‘power elite’ comprised a triumvirate of 
big business (particularly defence-related industries), the US military and political 
CONCEPT
Pluralist 
democracy
The term pluralist 
democracy is sometimes 
used interchangeably 
with liberal democracy. 
More specifically, 
it refers to a form 
of democracy that 
operates through the 
capacity of organized 
groups and interests 
to articulate popular 
demands and ensure 
responsive government. 
The conditions for 
a healthy pluralist 
democracy include: 
(1) a wide dispersal of 
political power amongst 
competing groups; 
(2) a high degree of 
internal responsiveness, 
group leaders being 
accountable to 
members; and (3) a 
neutral governmental 
machine that is 
sufficiently fragmented 
to offer groups a number 
of points of access.

cliques surrounding the president. Drawing on a combination of economic power, 
bureaucratic control and access to the highest levels of the executive branch of 
government, the power elite is able to shape key history-making decisions, especially 
in the fields of defence and foreign policy, as well as strategic economic policy. The 
power-elite model suggests that liberal democracy in the USA is largely a sham.
Elitists have, moreover, argued that empirical studies have supported pluralist 
conclusions only because Dahl and others have ignored the importance of agenda￾setting (see p. 11, 404) as a manifestation of power. This critique has become more 
strident in recent decades, where focus has increasingly been on the domination 
of the elites and the media in setting the political agenda. Right-wing populists 
and Alt Right thinkers have criticized the mainstream media and political elites 
for formulating and controlling public narratives that prevent genuine debate over 
societal issues which are treated as ‘settled’ when in fact they are not. For instance, 
though mainstream commentators and politicians were caught by surprise by the 
results of the 2016 Brexit referendum, long-time supporters of the UK’s exit from 
the European Union argued that the result was only surprising because the issue 
had long been treated as a fringe issue by the mainstream media and political elites.
Certain elite theorists have nevertheless argued that a measure of democratic 
accountability is consistent with elite rule. Whereas the power-elite model portrays 
the elite as a cohesive body, bound together by common or overlapping interests, 
competitive elitism (sometimes called ‘democratic elitism’) highlights elite rivalry 
(see Figure 4.1). In other words, the elite, consisting of the leading figures from a 
number of competing groups and interests, is fractured. This view is often associated 
with Joseph Schumpeter’s (see p. 249) ‘realistic’ model of democracy outlined in 
Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942):
The democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political 
decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a 
competitive struggle for the people’s vote.
CONCEPT
Elitism
Elite originally meant, 
and can still mean, ‘the 
highest’, ‘the best’ or 
‘the excellent’. Used 
in an empirical sense, 
it refers to a minority 
in whose hands power, 
wealth or privilege is 
concentrated. Elitism 
is a belief in, or practice 
of, rule by an elite or 
minority. Normative
elitism suggests that 
political power should 
be vested in the hands 
of a wise or enlightened 
minority. Classical
elitism claims to be 
empirical (although 
normative beliefs 
often intrudes), and 
sees elite rule as an 
unchangeable fact of 
social existence. Modern
elitism is also empirical, 
but it is more critical and 
discriminating about the 
causes of elite rule.
KEY THINKER
ROSA LUXEMBURG (1871–1919)
A Polish-born socialist and exponent of revolutionary Marxism, Luxemburg advanced the first 
Marxist critique of the Bolshevik tradition from the point of view of democracy. Emphasizing 
the benefits of a broadly based democratic organization, she condemned Lenin’s conception 
of a tightly centralized vanguard party as an attempt to exert political control over the working 
class. By associating vanguardism with the rise of despotism, she predicted the subsequent 
course of Russian communism. In her most important theoretical work, The Accumulation 
of Capital (1913), Luxemburg examined the intrinsic connections between capitalism, 
nationalism, militarism and imperialism. In Social Reform or Revolution (1899), she condemned 
the revisionism of Eduard Bernstein and others for denying the objective foundations of the 
socialist project. Source: Alamy Stock

The electorate can decide which elite rules, but cannot change the fact that power 
is always exercised by an elite. This model of competitive elitism was developed by 
Anthony Downs (1957) into the ‘economic theory of democracy’. In effect, electoral 
competition creates a political market in which politicians act as entrepreneurs bent 
upon achieving government power, and individual voters behave like consumers, 
voting for the party with the policies that most closely reflect their own preferences. 
Downs argued that a system of open and competitive elections guarantees democratic 
rule because it places government in the hands of the party whose philosophy, 
values and policies correspond most closely to the preferences of the largest group 
of voters. As Schumpeter put it, ‘democracy is the rule of the politician’. As a model 
of democratic politics, competitive elitism at least has the virtue that it corresponds 
closely to the workings of the liberal-democratic political system. Indeed, it emerged 
more as an attempt to describe how the democratic process works than through 
a desire to prescribe certain values and principles – political equality, popular 
participation, freedom and so on.
Corporatist view
The origins of corporatism (see p. 304) date back to the attempt in Fascist Italy to 
construct a so-called ‘corporate state’ by integrating both managers and workers into 
the processes of government. Corporatist theorists, however, have drawn attention 
to parallel developments in the world’s major industrialized states. In the form of 
neocorporatism, or liberal corporatism, this gave rise to the spectre of ‘tripartite

government’, in which government is conducted through organizations that allow 
state officials, employers’ groups and unions to deal directly with one another. To a 
large extent, this tendency to integrate economic interests into government (which 
was common in the post-1945 period, and particularly prominent in, for example, 
Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Austria) was a consequence of the drift 
towards economic management and intervention. As government sought to manage 
economic life and deliver an increasingly broad range of public services, it recognized 
the need for institutional arrangements that were designed to secure the cooperation 
and support of major economic interests. Where attempts have been made to shift 
economic policy away from state intervention and towards the free market, the 
impact of corporatism has markedly diminished.
The significance of corporatism in terms of democratic processes is clearly considerable. 
There are those who argue that corporatism makes possible a form of functional 
representation, in that individuals’ views and interests are articulated more by the 
groups to which they belong than through the mechanism of competitive elections. 
What is called ‘corporate pluralism’ thus portrays tripartism as a mechanism through 
which the major groups and interests in society compete to shape government policy. 
Some commentators, however, see corporatism as a threat to democracy. In the 
first place, corporatism only advantages groups that are accorded privileged access 
to government. ‘Insider’ groups therefore possess a political voice, while ‘outsider’ 
groups are denied one. Second, corporatism can work to the benefit of the state, rather 
than major economic interests, in that the peak associations that the government 
chooses to deal with can be used to exert discipline over their members and to filter 
out radical demands. Finally, corporatism threatens to subvert the processes of 
electoral or parliamentary democracy. Policy is made through negotiations between 
government officials and leaders of powerful economic interests, rather than through 
the deliberations of a representative assembly. Interest-group leaders may thus exert 
considerable political power, even though they are in no way publicly accountable 
and their influence is not subject to public scrutiny.
The emergence of the New Right from the 1970s onwards has generated a very 
particular critique of corporatism in democratic politics. New Right theorists are 
keen advocates of the free market, believing that economies work best when left alone 
by government. The danger of corporatism from this perspective is that it empowers 
sectional groups and economic interests, enabling them to make demands on 
government for increased pay, public investment, subsidies, state protection and so 
on. In effect, corporatism allows well-placed interest groups to dominate and dictate 
to government. The result of this, according to the New Right, is an irresistible drift 
towards state intervention and economic stagnation (Olson 1984).
Moreover, voters and interest groups are attracted by promises of higher public 
spending, and politicians, consumed by the desire to win power, will attempt 
to outbid one another by making ever-more generous spending pledges to the 
electorate. The economic consequences are high levels of inflation fuelled by public 
borrowing, and a tax burden that destroys enterprise and undermines growth. Thus, 
as characterized by Marquand (1988), the New Right view is that ‘democracy is to 
adults what chocolate is to children: endlessly tempting; harmless in small doses; 
sickening in excess’.

DEBATING . . .
IS DEMOCRACY ALWAYS THE BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT?
In modern politics, democracy has come to be so widely accepted that it appears to be almost politically incorrect to 
question it. The ‘right’ solution to a political problem is thus the democratic solution; that is, one made either by the people 
themselves or, more commonly, by politicians who are accountable to the people. But why is democracy so widely revered? 
And are there circumstances in which democratic rule is inappropriate or undesirable?
YES NO
The highest form of politics. The unique strength 
of democracy is that it is able to address the central 
challenge of politics – the existence of rival views and 
interests within the same society – while containing 
the tendency towards bloodshed and violence. In short, 
democratic societies are stable and peaceful. This occurs 
because democracy relies on open debate, persuasion 
and compromise. People with rival views or competing 
interests are encouraged to find a way of living together 
in relative harmony because each has a political voice. 
Democracy is therefore a kind of political safety valve, 
democratic participation preventing the build-up of 
anger and frustration and, thereby, containing political 
extremism.
Democracy as a universal value. It is now widely argued 
that democracy is a human right: a fundamental and 
absolute right that belongs to all people, regardless 
of nationality, religion, gender and other differences. 
Rights of political participation and access to power, 
especially the right to vote, are universally applicable 
because they stem from the basic entitlement to shape 
the decisions that affect one’s own life – the right to 
self-rule. Indeed, an equal access to power and the right 
to political participation could be viewed not simply as 
virtues in their own right, but as preconditions for the 
maintenance of all other rights and freedoms.
Keeping tyranny at bay. All systems of rule are apt to 
become tyrannies against the people, reflecting the fact 
that those in power (and, for that matter, all people) 
are inclined to place self-interest before the interests 
of others. Governments and leaders therefore need 
to be checked or constrained, and there is no more 
effective constraint on power than democracy. This is 
because democratic rule operates through a mechanism 
of accountability, which ultimately allows the public to 
‘kick the rascals out’. Democratic societies are therefore 
not only the most stable societies in the world but also 
the societies in which citizens enjoy the widest realm of 
freedom.
The disharmony of democracy. Far from being a guarantee 
of stability, democracy is biased in favour of conflict and 
disharmony. This is because democracy sets up an ongoing 
electoral battle between opponents who are encouraged 
to condemn one another, exaggerating their faults and 
denying their achievements. Democratic politics is often, 
as a result, noisy and unedifying. While the disharmony of 
democracy is unlikely to threaten structural breakdown in 
mature and relatively prosperous societies, democracy in 
the developing world may make things worse rather than 
better (Hawksley 2009). ‘Democratization’ may therefore 
deepen tribal, regional or ethnic tensions, and strengthen 
the tendency towards charismatic leadership, thereby 
breeding authoritarianism.
Democracy as Westernization. Rather than being universally 
applicable, democracy is based on values and assumptions 
that betray the cultural biases of its Western heartland. 
Democracy is rooted in ideas such as individualism, notably 
through the principle of equal citizenship and ‘one person, 
one vote’, and notions of pluralism and competition that 
are intrinsically liberal in character. The dominant form of 
democracy is therefore Western-style democracy, and its 
spread, sometimes imposed and always encouraged, to the 
non-Western world can therefore be viewed as a form of 
cultural imperialism.
Good government not popular government. Democratic 
solutions to problems are often neither wise nor sensible. 
The problem with democracy is that the dictates of wisdom 
and experience tend to be ignored because the views of the 
well-educated minority are swamped by those of the less 
well-educated majority. Being committed to the principle 
of political equality, democracy cannot cope with the fact 
that the majority is not always right. This is a particular 
concern for economic policy, where options, such as raising 
taxes or cutting government spending, which may best 
promote long-term economic development, may be ruled 
out simply because they are unpopular.

Towards cosmopolitan democracy?
The idea of cosmopolitan democracy has received growing attention due to the 
advance of globalization and the ‘hollowing out’ of domestic democratic processes 
within the nation-state. If global interconnectedness means that policy-making 
authority has shifted from national governments to international organizations, surely 
democracy should be recast in line with this? However, what would cosmopolitan 
democracy look like, and how would it operate?
Two basic models have been advanced. The first would involve the construction 
of a world parliament, a body whose role would be to introduce greater scrutiny 
and openness to the process of global decision-making by calling to account 
established international organizations, such as the United Nations, the World Trade 
Organization, the International Monetary Fund and so forth. Very few advocates 
of such an idea contemplate the creation of a fully fledged world government or 
global state; most, instead, favour a multilevel system of post-sovereign governance 
in which no body or level is able to exercise final authority. David Held proposed a 
package of measures, including the establishment of a global parliament, reformed 
and more accountable international organizations, and the ‘permanent shift of 
a growing proportion of a nation state’s coercive capacity to regional and global 
institutions’ (1995). George Monbiot (2004), for his part, backed the creation of a 
popularly elected world parliament, composed of 600 representatives, each with a 
constituency of about 10 million people, many of which would straddle national 
borders.
The alternative model of cosmopolitan democracy is less ambitious and formalized, 
relying less on the construction of new bodies and more on the reform of existing 
international organizations, often linked to the strengthening of global civil society. 
This model places its faith in non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (see p.
302) to reconfigure global power by offering an alternative to top-down corporate 
globalization. This idea of ‘globalization from below’ amounts to a bottom-up 
democratic vision of a civilizing world order. Such an approach would be effective 
to the extent that NGOs and transnational social movements could introduce an 
element of public scrutiny and accountability to the working of international bodies, 
conferences, summits and the like, meaning that global civil society functions as a 
channel of communications between the individual and global institutions.
However, the prospects for cosmopolitan democracy are far from rosy. In the first 
place, states, and especially major states, are likely to block any trend towards global 
democracy, or ensure that any ‘alternative’ bodies that may be created will lack 
credibility and remain peripheral to global decision-making. In a wider sense, the 
egalitarian thrust implicit in the idea of cosmopolitan democracy is simply out of 
step with the deep economic, political and military disparities of the existing global 
system.
Aside from the obstacles confronting the transition to cosmopolitan democracy, 
critics have argued that the project itself may be profoundly misconceived. In 
the first place, however structured and composed, any global institution that is 
tasked with ensuring public accountability will struggle to establish and maintain 
their legitimacy. The inevitable distance between popularly elected global political

Global civil society
Global civil society 
refers to a realm in 
which transnational 
non-governmental 
groups and associations 
interact. These groups 
are typically voluntary 
and non-profitmaking, 
setting them apart 
from transnational 
corporations. However, 
the term ‘global civil 
society’ is complex and 
contested. In its ‘activist’ 
version, transnational 
social movements are 
the key agents of global 
civil society, giving it an 
‘outsider’ orientation, 
and a strong focus on 
cosmopolitan ideals. 
In its ‘policy’ version, 
NGOs are the key 
agents of global civil 
society, giving it an 
‘insider’ orientation 
and overlaying it with 
global governance (see 
p. 487).

institutions and ordinary citizens around the world would likely undermine any 
claims to democratic legitimacy. Democracy, in this light, is perhaps only meaningful 
if it is local or national, and all international organizations, whether these are regional 
or global, are destined to suffer from a debilitating democratic deficit. Second, the 
democratic credentials of NGOs and, for that matter, social movements may be 
entirely bogus. Large memberships, committed activists and the ability to mobilize 
popular protests and demonstrations undoubtedly give social movements and 
NGOs political influence, but they do not invest them with democratic authority. 
Quite simply, there is no way of testing the weight of their views against those of the 
population at large.

POLITICAL SYSTEMS
KEY ISSUES
 What is the difference between governments, political systems and regimes?

 Does the future belong to democracy or authoritarianism?
PREVIEW
Classifying forms of government has been one of the principal concerns of political analysis throughout the ages. 
This process can be traced back to the fourth century bce, when Aristotle made the first recorded attempt to 
describe the political regimes then in existence, using terms such as ‘democracy’, ‘oligarchy’ and ‘tyranny’ that are 
still commonly employed today. From the eighteenth century onwards, governments were increasingly classified as 
monarchies or republics, or as autocratic or constitutional regimes. During the twentieth century, these distinctions 
were further sharpened. The ‘three worlds’ classification of political systems, which was particularly fashionable 
during the Cold War period, created an image of world politics dominated by a struggle between democracy and 
totalitarianism.
However, in the light of modern developments such as the collapse of communism, the rise of East Asia, 
and the emergence of political Islam, all such classifications appear outdated. It is not entirely clear what these 
developments mean, though. Some interpret them as an indication that democratization, modelled around 
the principles of Western liberal democracy, is a natural and inevitable process. In this view, liberal democracy 
constitutes the final form of human government. Others argue that the modern world is becoming politically 
more fragmented. From this perspective, not only is liberal democracy culturally bound rather than universally 
applicable, but alternative regimes, including authoritarian systems and forms of illiberal democracy, are proving to 
be more successful and enduring than previously expected.

CLASSIFYING POLITICAL SYSTEMS
What is ‘government’, and how do governments differ from ‘political systems’ or 
‘regimes’? ‘Government’ refers to the institutional processes through which collective 
and usually binding decisions are made; its various institutions constitute the subject 
matter of Chapters 13–16 of this book. A regime, on the other hand, is a broader 
term that encompasses not only the mechanisms of government and the institutions 
of the state but also the structures and processes through which these interact with 
the larger society, and the values and ideas that underpin them.
A regime or political system is the system of rule endures beyond the life of any 
particular government. Whereas governments can be changed by elections, through 
dynastic succession, as a result of coups d’état (see p. 142), and so on, regimes or political 
systems can be changed only by constitutional overhauls, military intervention from 
without, or perhaps by some kind of revolutionary upheaval from within.
Why classify political regimes?
The interest in classifying political regimes stems from two sources. First, as in most 
social sciences, understanding in politics is acquired largely through a process of 
comparison, particularly as experimental methods are generally inapplicable. It is not 
possible, for instance, to devise experiments to test whether, say, the US government 
would be less susceptible to institutional government gridlock if it abandoned the 
separation of powers (see p. 377), or whether communism (see pp. 41–43) could have 
survived in the USSR had significant reforms been instigated a generation earlier. 
In consequence, we look to comparison to throw into relief what we are studying. 
Through the highlighting of similarities and differences between what might 
otherwise be a bewildering collections of facts, comparison helps us to distinguish 
between what is significant and meaningful and what is not. And through this we 
are able both to develop theories, hypotheses and concepts, and to some extent, test 
them. As Alexis de Tocqueville (see p. 299) put it, ‘without comparisons to make, 
the mind does not know how to proceed’. The attempt to classify systems of rule is, 
therefore, merely a device for making the process of comparison more methodical 
and systematic.
The second purpose of classification is to facilitate evaluation, rather than analysis. 
Since Aristotle (see p. 6), those who have sought to understand political regimes have 
often been as keen to improve and reform government as to understand it. In other 
words, descriptive understanding is closely tied up with normative judgements: 
questions about what is are linked to questions about what should be. In its extreme 
form, this process may involve a search for an ‘ideal’ system of rule, or even a utopia, 
and this can be seen in works such as Plato’s Republic, Montesquieu’s The Spirit of 
the Laws (1748) and Peter Kropotkin’s Fields, Factories and Workshops (1912). In a 
more modest form, this type of classification allows for qualitative judgements to be 
made in relation to political structures and governmental forms. Only a comparative 
approach, for instance, enables us to consider questions such as ‘should the transition 
from dictatorship to liberal democracy generally be encouraged?’, or ‘should India 
abandon federalism in favour of either a unitary system or regional independence?’ 
or ‘should the United Kingdom adopt a written constitution?’
Government gridlock:
Paralysis resulting from 
institutional rivalry 
within government, or 
the attempt to respond 
to conflicting public 
demands.
Regime: A set of 
arrangements, values, 
ideals and procedures for 
government, outlining 
how authority and 
legitimacy are established, 
and the nature of the 
political process.
CONCEPT
Government
Government, in its 
broadest sense, refers 
to any mechanism 
through which ordered 
rule is maintained, its 
central features being 
the ability to make 
collective decisions 
and the capacity to 
enforce them. However, 
the term is more 
commonly understood 
to describe the formal 
and institutional 
processes that operate 
at the national level to 
maintain public order 
and facilitate collective 
action. The core 
functions of government 
are, thus, to make law 
(legislation), implement 
law (execution) 
and interpret law 
(adjudication). In some 
cases, the political 
executive (see p. 346)
alone is referred to as 
‘the government’.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_5.indd 119 23-07-2024 13:14:45120 POLITICS
All systems of classification have their drawbacks, however, and as with all analytical 
devices, there is a danger of oversimplification. The classification of regimes under 
the same heading draws attention to the similarities that they share, but there is a 
risk that the differences that divide them will be ignored or disguised. For instance, 
regimes can structurally look very similar but can vary significantly in their political 
culture, a concept popularized by Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba in The Civic 
Culture (1963) (see pp. 216–217). Pakistan, Malaysia, Fiji, Jamaica and the United 
Kingdom, for instance are, on paper at least, parliamentary democracies with similar 
Westminster-style (see pp. 373–375) systems of rule. Yet how politics is actually 
practised varies greatly between the five.
A related problem is a possible failure to see that a phenomenon may have different 
meanings in different contexts. Comparative analysis is therefore hampered by the 
constant danger of ethnocentrism. In the case of the five previously mentioned 
systems, Western observers would only classify some of these as ‘true’ or ‘full’ 
democracies. Yet what truly constitutes a democracy is a value judgement – Western 
political culture tends to place a much higher emphasis on self-expression, secular￾rational values and electoral competitiveness than Middle Eastern or African 
political cultures. Finally, all systems of classification have the drawback that they are 
necessarily state-bound: they treat individual countries as coherent or independent 
entities in their own right. Although this approach is by no means invalid, it is 
now widely viewed as incomplete in the light of the phenomenon of globalization 
(see p. 182).
Classical typologies
Without doubt, the most influential system of classification was that devised by 
Aristotle in the fourth century bce, which was based on his analysis of the 158 Greek 
city-states then in existence. This system dominated thinking on the subject for 
roughly the next 2,500 years. Aristotle held that governments could be categorized on 
the basis of two questions: ‘Who rules?’, and ‘Who benefits from rule?’ Government, 
he believed, could be placed in the hands of a single individual, a small group or the 
many. In each case, however, government could be conducted either in the selfish 
interests of the rulers, or for the benefit of the entire community. He thus identified 
the six forms of government shown in Figure 5.1.
CONCEPT
Utopia
A utopia (from the 
Greek outopia, meaning 
‘nowhere’, or eutopia, 
meaning ‘good place’) 
is literally an ideal 
or perfect society. 
Although utopias of 
various kinds can be 
envisaged, most are 
characterized by the 
abolition of want, the 
absence of conflict 
and the avoidance of 
violence and oppression. 
Utopianism is a style of 
political theorizing that 
develops a critique of 
the existing order by 
constructing a model 
of an ideal or perfect 
alternative. However, 
the term is often used 
in a pejorative sense to 
imply deluded or fanciful 
thinking, a belief in an 
impossible goal.
Ethnocentrism: The 
application of values and 
theories drawn from one’s 
own culture to other

Aristotle’s purpose was to evaluate forms of government on normative grounds 
in the hope of identifying the ‘ideal’ constitution. In his view, tyranny, oligarchy 
and democracy were all debased forms of rule in which a single person, a small 
group and the masses, respectively, governed in their own interests and, therefore, 
at the expense of others. In contrast, monarchy, aristocracy and polity were to be 
preferred, because in these forms of government the individual, small group and 
the masses, respectively, governed in the interests of all. Aristotle declared tyranny 
to be the worst of all possible constitutions, as it reduced citizens to the status of 
slaves. Monarchy and aristocracy were, on the other hand, impractical, because they 
were based on a God-like willingness to place the good of the community before the 
rulers’ own interests. Polity (rule by the many in the interests of all) was accepted 
as the most practicable of arrangements. Nevertheless, in a tradition that endured 
through to the twentieth century, Aristotle criticized popular rule on the grounds 
that the masses would resent the wealth of the few, and too easily fall under the 
sway of a demagogue. He therefore advocated a mixed constitution that combined 
elements of both democracy and aristocracy, while leaving government in the hands 
of the middle classes who were neither rich nor poor.
The Aristotelian system was further developed by thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes 
(see p. 65) and Jean Bodin (1530–96). Their particular concern was with the 
principle of sovereignty (see p. 64), viewed as the basis for all stable political regimes. 
Sovereignty was taken to mean the ‘most high and perpetual’ power, a power that 
alone could guarantee orderly rule. Bodin’s The Six Books of the Commonweale (1576) 
offered a wide-ranging account of the locus of sovereignty in political regimes, both 
contemporary and classical. He concluded that absolutism was the most defensible of 
regimes, as it established a sovereign who makes law but is not bound by those laws. 
The overriding merit of vesting sovereignty in a single individual was that it would 
then be indivisible: sovereignty would be expressed in a single voice that could claim 
final authority. Bodin nevertheless argued that absolute monarchs were constrained 
by the existence of higher law in the form of the will of God or natural law. On the 
other hand, in Leviathan (1651), Hobbes portrayed sovereignty as a monopoly of 
coercive power, implying that the sovereign was entirely unconstrained.
These ideas were later revised by early liberals such as John Locke (see p. 32) and 
Montesquieu (see p. 375), who championed the cause of constitutional government. 
Locke, in Two Treatises of Government (1690), argued that sovereignty resided with the 
people, not the monarch, and he advocated a system of limited government to provide 
protection for natural rights; notably, the rights to life, liberty and property. In his epic 
The Spirit of the Laws (1748), Montesquieu attempted to develop a ‘scientific’ study 
of human society, designed to uncover the constitutional circumstances that would 
best protect individual liberty. A severe critic of absolutism and an admirer of the 
English parliamentary tradition, he proposed a system of checks and balances in the 
form of a ‘separation of powers’ (see p. 377) between executive, legislative and judicial 
institutions. This principle was incorporated into the US Constitution (1787), and it 
later came to be seen as one of the defining features of liberal-democratic government.
The ‘classical’ classification of regimes, stemming from the writings of Aristotle, 
was rendered increasingly redundant by the development of modern constitutional 
systems from the late eighteenth century onwards. In their different ways, the

leader whose control

on the ability to whip up 
hysterical enthusiasm.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_5.indd 121 23-07-2024 13:14:45122 POLITICS
constitutional republicanism established in the USA following the American War 
of Independence of 1775–83, the democratic radicalism unleashed in France by the 
1789 French Revolution and the form of parliamentary government that gradually 
emerged in the UK created political realities that were substantially more complex 
than earlier thinkers had envisaged. Traditional systems of classification were 
therefore displaced by a growing emphasis on the constitutional and institutional 
features of political rule. In many ways, this built on Montesquieu’s work, in that 
particular attention was paid to the relationships between the earlier branches of 
government. Thus, monarchies were distinguished from republics, parliamentary 
government (see p. 373) was distinguished from presidential government (see pp.
351–355) and unitary systems were distinguished from federal systems (see p. 430).
The ‘three worlds’ typology
During the twentieth century, historical developments once again altered the focus 
of political classification. The appearance in the interwar period of new forms of 
authoritarianism (see p. 139), particularly in Stalinist Russia, Fascist Italy and Nazi 
Germany, encouraged the view that the world was divided into two kinds of regime: 
democratic states and totalitarian states. The stark contrast between democracy and 
totalitarianism dominated attempts at regime classification through much of the 
1950s and 1960s, despite the fact that the fascist regimes had collapsed at the end 
of the Second World War. Nevertheless, there was a growing awareness that this 
approach was shaped by the antagonisms of the Cold War, which stimulated the 
search for a more value-neutral and ideologically impartial system of classification. 
This led to the growing popularity of the so-called ‘three worlds’ approach – the belief 
that the political world could be divided into three distinct blocs:
 a capitalist ‘first world’
 a communist ‘second world’
 a developing ‘third world’.
The three worlds’ classification had economic, political and strategic dimensions, 
though the boundary lines were primarily around ideology and foreign policy. 
The first world was wedded to Western values and ‘capitalist’ principles, such as 
the desirability of private enterprise, material incentives and the free market; the 
second world was committed to ‘communist’ values such as social equality, collective 
endeavour and centralized planning. This division was underpinned by a bipolar 
world order, in which a USA-dominated first world confronted a USSR-dominated 
second world, and was further reinforced by the emergence of two rival military 
alliances in the form of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The third world was the 
countries not officially aligned to either bloc and, not infrequently, the third world 
was the battleground for influence over which the first and second worlds conducted 
their geopolitical rivalry.
As the Cold War progressed, the first-, second- and third-world classification 
increasingly took on economic implications. Industrialized Western regimes were ‘first’ 
in economic terms, in that their populations enjoyed the highest levels of mass affluence. 
In 1983, these countries generated 63 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product
(GDP) while having only 15 per cent of the world’s population. Communist regimes

CONCEPT
Absolutism
Absolutism is the theory 
or practice of absolute 
government, most 
commonly associated 
with an absolute 
monarchy (see p. 122).
Government is ‘absolute’ 
in the sense that it 
possesses unfettered 
power: government 
cannot be constrained 
by a body external to 
itself. The absolutist 
principle, nevertheless, 
resides in the claim to 
an unlimited right to 
rule (as in divine right), 
rather than the exercise 
of unchallengeable 
power. As it is based 
on a principled claim, 
whether religious or 
rational, absolutism does 
not invest government 
with arbitrary power, 
unlike dictatorship 
(see p. 140).
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_5.indd 122 23-07-2024 13:14:45REGIMES AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS 123
were ‘second’, insofar as they were largely industrialized and capable of satisfying the 
population’s basic material needs. These countries produced 19 per cent of the world’s 
GDP with 33 per cent of the world’s population. The less-developed countries of Africa, 
Asia and Latin America were ‘third’, in the sense that they were economically dependent 
and often suffered from widespread poverty. They produced 18 per cent of the world’s 
GDP with 52 per cent of the world’s population (World Bank 1985).
It became typical for commentators and the public to associate the first, second and 
third worlds with political regimes as well – the USA and many of its key first-world 
allies were liberal democracies, whereas the USSR, China and most of the second world 
were one-party communist states and the third world might typically be authoritarian 
military or monarchical regimes. In practice, however, the alignment of the three worlds 
with economic and political systems was fairly loose and there were lots of exceptions. 
Portugal, governed by a semi-fascist dictatorship until the 1970s, was a founding 
member of NATO and the first world alliance, whilst Switzerland, a highly developed 
capitalist democracy, and moderately developed communist-ruled Yugoslavia, both 
remained unaligned and thus in the ‘third world’ throughout the Cold War.
The three worlds system of classification began to break down in the 1970s, as 
Cold War tensions subsided. African, Middle Eastern and Latin American nations, 
even those with democratic or communist regimes, increasingly opted for non￾alignment. New patterns of economic development brought material affluence to 
parts of the third world; notably, the oil-rich states of the Middle East and the newly 
industrialized states of East and Southeast Asia.
The fall of the Warsaw Pact regimes of Eastern Europe and the break-up of the 
Soviet Union in 1991 led to the dismantlement of second world and unleashed a 
process of political liberalization and market reform. The so-called ‘third wave’ 
of democratization saw many nations across the former second and third worlds 
transitioning towards democratic regimes (Grugel and Bishop 2013). Indeed, Francis 
Fukuyama (see p. 124) went so far as to proclaim that this development amounted 
to the ‘end of history’. He meant by this that ideological debate had effectively ended 
with the worldwide triumph of Western liberal democracy and market capitalism, 
now the only regimes capable of producing economic prosperity and political 
legitimacy in the modern world.
In some senses, the ‘end of history’ scenario of liberal-democratic triumphalism 
reflected the persistence of a Western-centric viewpoint. The image of a world 
of liberal democracies suggested the superiority of a specifically Western model 
of development and implied that values such as individualism (see p. 197) and 
democracy are universally applicable. One result of this was a failure to recognize the 
significance, for instance, of Islamic and Confucian political forms, which tended to 
be dismissed as mere aberrations. Another was that insufficient attention was given 
to the wider resurgence of authoritarianism, sometimes under democratic guises. 
Moreover, the old second world did not entirely disappear – though China adopted 
market-based reforms and opened to the West in the 1990s, it did not embrace 
liberal-democratic politics or a pro-Western foreign policy. Its rapid economic 
growth and expanding international influence since that time is hard to reconcile 
with the ‘end of history’ narrative.
CONCEPT
The West
The term ‘the West’ 
has two overlapping 
meanings. In a general 
sense, it refers to 
the cultural and 
philosophical inheritance 
of Europe, as exported 
through migration or 
colonialism. The roots 
of this inheritance lie 
in Judeo-Christian 
religion and the learning 
of ‘classical’ Greece 
and Rome, shaped in 
the modern period by 
the ideas and values of 
liberalism. In a narrower 
sense, fashionable 
during the Cold War, the 
West meant the USA￾dominated capitalist 
bloc, as opposed to 
the USSR-dominated 
East. Although Eastern 
Europe no longer 
belongs to the East in 
this sense, it has always 
been unclear whether 
Russia belongs to the 
West in the broader 
sense.

CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL SYSTEMS
Classifying twenty-first-century political systems can be a more complicated 
exercise than it was in previous centuries, as the language and formal structure 
of a regime may not provide a particularly accurate picture of how it operates in 
practice.
Most contemporary political regimes at least claim to be democratic, and all but a 
handful hold elections in some form. And as democracy is now generally accepted 
as the basis of modern political legitimacy (see Chapter 4), contemporary regime 
classification schemes tend to revolve around metrics designed to measure how
democratic a regime is. Modern democratic indices consider not just structural 
features of a regime like separation of powers (see p. 377) and elections (see 
Chapter 10) but also factors that have a significant impact on public participation 
in government, like freedom of speech and association, a free and independent 
media, civic values, corruption and the rule of law (see p. 335). There are many 
democratic indices, and they differ somewhat in how they classify their results, but 
for our purposes we will use the four classifications offered by the Democracy Index 
produced by Economist Intelligence Unit (2022) as a starting point for discussing 
contemporary political regimes. These include:
 full democracies
 flawed democracies
 hybrid regimes
 authoritarian regimes.
Full democracies
Full democracies are systems where free and fair elections are the norm, and public 
participation in government and political affairs is meaningful and ongoing. These 
are regimes where democratic norms are not just established in law, they are also 
strongly supported by the political culture, as well as entrenched respect for individual 
rights and freedoms like gender equality and freedom of speech.
KEY THINKER
FRANCIS FUKUYAMA (BORN 1952)
US social analyst and political commentator. He was a member of the Policy Planning Staff 
of the US State Department before becoming an academic. A staunch Republican, he 
came to international prominence as a result of The End of History and the Last Man (1992), 
which claimed that the history of ideas had ended with the recognition of liberal democracy 
as ‘the final form of human government’. In Trust (1996) and The Great Disruption (1999), 
Fukuyama discussed the relationship between economic development and social cohesion. 
In The Origins of Political Order (2011), he laid down the basis for a theory of political

Samuel Huntington (see p. 478) notably argued in the 1990s that full democracies were 
a product of the first two ‘waves’ of democratization. The first occurred between 1828 
and 1926, and involved countries such as the USA, France and the UK. The second 
occurred between 1943 and 1962, and involved countries such as West Germany, 
Italy and Japan. This view has become increasingly dated, however, and though most 
of these mature democracies continue to function as ‘full’ democracies, they have 
been joined in recent decades by relative newcomers. South Korea and Uruguay, for 
instance, only ended martial law and began allowing competitive elections in the 
1980s, but since then have become two of the world’s most democratic countries.
Full democracies tend to be distinguished by the combination of two general features. 
In the first place, there is a relatively high tolerance of opposition that is sufficient 
at least to check the arbitrary inclinations of government. This is guaranteed in 
practice by a competitive party system, by institutionally guaranteed and protected 
civil liberties, a free media and freedom of speech and expression, as well as a 
vigorous and healthy civil society. The second feature is that the opportunities for 
participating in politics are sufficiently widespread to guarantee a reliable level 
of popular responsiveness. The crucial factor here is the existence of regular and 
competitive elections operating as a device through which the people can influence 
and, if necessary, remove their rulers.
Under such conditions, full democracies might also be described as polyarchies,
literally the ‘rule by the many’, insofar as power is quite broadly dispersed within 
the system. This competitiveness is not confined to just political power, but ideally 
represents systems where the economy, the media and civil society are diversified 
and not concentrated in too few hands.
Though full democracies are an increasingly diverse category, constituting perhaps 
10–20 per cent of the twenty-first-century world’s regimes, this category has been 
traditionally dominated by a subset of regimes which we might term ‘Western 
liberal democracies’. These are marked not only by representative democracy and a 
capitalist economic organization but also by a cultural and ideological orientation 
that is largely derived from Western liberalism. The most crucial aspect of this 
inheritance is the widespread acceptance of liberal individualism. Individualism, 
often seen as the most distinctive of Western values, stresses the uniqueness of each 
human individual, and suggests that society should be organized so as to best meet 
the needs and interests of the individuals who compose it. The political culture of 
Western liberal democracies is influenced by liberal individualism in a variety of 
ways. It generates, for example, a heightened sensitivity to individual rights (perhaps 
placed above duties), the general perception that choice and competition (in both 
political and economic life) are healthy, and a tendency to fear government and 
regard the state as a potential threat to liberty. In the nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries, Western liberal values were seen by some as a precondition for a genuinely 
democratic and inclusive political culture; however, this Western-centric view 
of democracy has been increasingly disproven in recent decades, particularly as 
strong democracies have emerged in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Moreover, 
classical liberalism has not necessarily endured as the foundation of democratic 
culture uniformly in the West either. Some European countries, particularly the 
CONCEPT
Polyarchy
Polyarchy refers, 
generally, to the 
institutions and 
political processes of 
modern representative 
democracy. Polyarchy 
can be understood 
as a rough or crude 
approximation of 
democracy, in that 
it operates through 
institutions that force 
rulers to take account of 
the public’s wishes. Its 
central features are: (1) 
government is based on 
election; (2) elections 
are free and fair; (3) 
practically all adults 
have the right to vote; 
(4) the right to run for 
office is unrestricted; 
(5) there is free 
expression and a right 
to criticize and protest; 
(6) citizens have access 
to alternative sources 
of information; and (7) 
groups and associations 
enjoy at least relative 
independence from 
government (Dahl 1971).

Nordic regimes of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland, are sometimes 
described as social democracies, insofar these systems have mixed economies and a 
more socially orientated balance between individual rights and the common good.

traditions, Norway was ranked the most democratic nation in the world in 2022 by

Apart from the underlying political values that are enshrined in a regime, another 
significant dimension of political culture and behaviour that helps further classify 
democracies is what Arend Lijphart, in Patterns of Democracy (2012), identifies as 
‘majoritarian’ versus ‘consensus’ democracies. Majoritarian democracies are systems 
in which the political rules and electoral processes tend to produce situations 
where a single party will form government, and political power at any given time is 
relatively concentrated in the hands of the majority party. Historically, majoritarian 
democracies have been associated with Westminster systems (see pp. 373–375),
where executive government is formed from the party who commands a majority in 
the legislature. When combined with a two-party system and strong party discipline 
in the legislature, governments in Westminster systems tend to have broad powers 
to pursue their policy goals, at least until the next election.
Because elections are all-or-nothing affairs in majoritarian democracies, there also 
tends to be an adversarial political culture within such systems. In Westminster 
systems, for instance, this is formalized in the sense that there is an official ‘opposition’ 
in the parliament, whose job is to critique the government of the day, and whose 
primary goal is to drive down the popularity of the government, while improving 
their own electoral prospects.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_5.indd 126 23-07-2024 13:14:46REGIMES AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS 127
In contrast, other democracies are characterized by a diffusion of power throughout 
the governmental and party systems. When electoral rules or a divided electorate 
create circumstances where a coalition of many parties is usually required to form a 
government, this is when consensus democracy becomes the norm. In such systems, 
compromise and coalition, rather than confrontation, are required to secure power 
and hold onto it. Such systems may be called consensus, or sometimes consociational, 
democracies. Usually, consensus democracies emerge in systems where power is 
separated between the executive and legislature, and where multi-party, rather than 
two-party, electoral competition are the norm. Sometimes, consensus democracies 
are a natural by-product of divided societies. Belgium, with its complex history 
and strong religious, ethnic and linguistic divides, has a highly fragmented political 
system that requires its leaders to be diplomats and negotiators as much as politicians 
in order to craft a workable governing majority.
The line between a majoritarian and consensus democracy is not hard-and-fast. 
For example, the United States nominally has the structural features of a consensus 
democracy, insofar as its strong separation between the branches of government 
places significant limitations on the powers of the elected president, who must 
negotiate with Congress to pass budgets and legislation. Moreover, party discipline 
has historically been weak in the Congress, and high thresholds are required to 
pass legislation in the Senate, theoretically incentivizing bipartisan consensus￾building. However, political polarization, and an electoral system that encourages 
two-party politics, has made American political culture more majoritarian in 
nature, in which adversarial politics prevails (see p. 391) and government gridlock 
(see p. 119) is increasingly common.
Democracies may be further classified by their specific structural and institutional 
arrangements. The most common way to do so is to consider the relationship 
between the executive and legislative branches of government. Broadly speaking, 
there are three major democratic subtypes along this axis:
 Parliamentary democracies: Where government is formed in the legislature (or 
parliament), and rules only so long as it commands a majority. The public do not 
directly vote for the head of government (prime minister), but instead vote for 
representatives, who in turn select amongst themselves the head of government. 
Because the government commands a majority in the legislature, executive and 
legislative powers are combined in this system.
 Presidential democracies: Where the head of government (president) is directly 
elected by the public and their government and executive powers are structurally 
separated from the legislature. The president is not directly responsible to the 
legislature but must still work with it in order to pass laws and advance their agenda.
 Semi-presidential democracies: A diverse category in which there is both an 
elected president and a prime minister who forms a government in the legislature. 
Executive power is divided between the president and prime minister, though 
who is more powerful, and their responsibilities to the legislature, vary depending 
on the specifics of the system.
The implications of these arrangements and how they impact the work of 
government are more thoroughly explored in Chapters 14 and 15. But in a broad 
CONCEPT
Majoritarianism
As a descriptive 
concept, majoritarianism 
refers to a rule of 
decision-making in 
which the preferences 
of the majority overrule 
those of the minority, 
although it is unclear 
whether this refers to 
an ‘absolute’ or ‘simple’ 
majority. As a normative 
concept, majoritarianism 
refers to the belief that 
majority views should
prevail over minority 
views, with the possible 
implication that the 
defeated minority is 
morally obliged to come 
into line with views of 
the majority. Normative 
majoritarianism has been 
justified on the grounds 
that it provides the most 
practicable means for 
ensuring government in 
the public interest.
Consociational 
democracy: A form of 
democracy that operates 
through power-sharing 
and a close association 
amongst a number 
of parties or political 
formations.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_5.indd 127 23-07-2024 13:14:46128 POLITICS
sense, these structures do play an important role in shaping political culture and 
the nature of a regime. For instance, in presidential systems the head of government 
is directly elected by the public, and as such may be more prone to populists and 
outsiders, able to ride a wave of electoral popularity into office. And the separation 
of powers allows a president a reliable and usually fixed term of office in order to 
advance their agenda, insulated from the whims of the legislature. In parliamentary 
systems, by contrast, the head of government only serves so long as the legislature 
(and, in practice, their party) allows them to do, and theoretically they could be 
removed at any time. Prime ministers thus tend to be more immediately responsive 
to their party colleagues, and agendas may change quickly to maintain power. Even 
then, prime ministers being replaced within their party, or snap elections when a 
governing coalition breaks down, are common features in parliamentary systems. 
This can be disruptive to good governing and frustrating to the public, who may 
feel they have elected one prime minister, only to find they have another six months 
later.
That said, the specific structural arrangements of a political system may have little 
do with how democratic or autocratic a regime is. For example, both Uruguay and 
Venezuela are constitutionally designed as democratic presidential republics, but 
while the former is one of the most successful ‘full’ democracies in Latin America, 
the latter is now one of the world’s most autocratic regimes. Nor are institutional 
arrangements deterministic of political culture. In Australia, which uses the 
Westminster model, leadership ‘spills’, where a leader is subjected to a vote of 
confidence by their own party, are exceedingly common – there have been more 
than two dozen at the federal level since the 1970s and five prime ministers have 
been removed from office by their own party in this way. Yet in the Bahamas, 
another Westminster system, this kind of party-room revolt is virtually unheard of. 
So, to compare political systems meaningfully, particularly democracies, both their 
political culture and their institutional arrangements need to be considered.
Flawed democracies
Flawed democracies, also called defective democracies, embedded democracies 
or, in some cases, transitional democracies, today represent a large and complex 
category of regimes. At its simplest, these are regimes that structurally and culturally 
aspire to full democracy, but for any number of reasons are not entirely polyarchic, 
and have systemic issues that skew the distribution of power towards certain groups 
or individuals. Flawed democracies may not necessarily be considered ‘flawed’ by 
those who live in the system, and some ‘flaws’ may in fact be a product of cultural or 
historical factors within a regime.
Flawed democracies highlight exactly why comparative government is so difficult, 
and why simply classification schemas of political systems often fail to capture 
critical differences between systems that have a large impact on how they operate. 
Study and interest in flawed democracies has risen significantly in recent decades 
and have helped to identify dozens of factors which can be critical to whether a 
democracy is fully functional or just partially so. These undermining factors may 
be wider societal problems that are hard to solve, or even the result of exogenous 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_5.indd 128 23-07-2024 13:14:46REGIMES AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS 129
pressures. Colombia, for instance, has long presented a challenge for observers. 
Though it has a well-established system of free and fair elections, and strong checks 
and balances on political power, in practice its political culture has been heavily 
compromised by more than five decades of violent political conflict between 
paramilitary groups, revolutionaries, criminal syndicates and the government. 
Journalists, civil society activists, trade unionists and political candidates are 
frequently threatened or assassinated in Colombia, which has hampered freedom 
of speech, assembly and the media, while government attempts to control rebel and 
criminal violence has frequently infringed on civil liberties. The problem has been 
made worse by the ongoing crisis in neighbouring Venezuela, from which many 
armed groups are able to base themselves, beyond the reach of the Colombian 
military.
To further divide this large category of regimes, a well-regarded typology of flawed 
democracies has been established by Merkel et al. (2003, 2006):
 delegative democracies
 domain democracies
 exclusive democracies
 illiberal democracies.
Though not every flawed democracy necessarily fits within this schema, it provides 
a good foundation for exploring the category.
Delegative democracies are regimes where one branch of government has become 
so powerful that the other branches are unable to act as an effective check on 
its power. In other words, the separation of powers has become dysfunctional. 
Guillermo O’Donnell (1994) notes that presidential democracies are particularly 
susceptible to this. The Philippines, Brazil and Argentina are prominent examples 
of regimes where power is heavily skewed towards the presidency. Term limits, the 
rule of law and a broadly democratic political culture prevent the situation from 
degrading into an outright dictatorship, but presidential elections become high￾stakes battles for virtually unchallenged control over government for the next term.
Domain democracies are those in which powerful groups or interests outside the 
formal political system routinely act as ‘veto players’ (see p. 129) in certain areas of 
policy or government, limiting democratic oversight and control over these areas. Sri 
Lanka, for instance, holds relatively free and fair elections and maintains a decently 
robust system of civil and political rights. But in practice the military and several 
wealthy political families hold enormous influence over government, and in certain 
domains, such as economic development and trade, policy is made at the behest of 
these groups rather than the cabinet or parliament. A number of domain democracies 
feature arrangements where elections are held and democratic government generally 
prevails, but the military periodically intervenes in the political process to prevent 
outcomes unfavourable to their interests.
Exclusive democracies are systems where certain segments of the population are 
excluded from electoral rights and possibly other political rights as well, and thus 
elections and governments are not truly representative of the population at large. 
Apartheid-era South Africa is a clear-cut case of such a regime, insofar as relatively 
CONCEPT
Veto player
First described by 
George Tsebelis 
(2002), veto players 
are a conceptual way 
of understanding how 
political regimes work. 
A veto player is an 
institution or actor in 
the political system 
who has the power to 
stop something from 
happening. Many 
political systems 
have these as part of 
their constitutional 
arrangements – in 
presidential systems, 
often the president 
can veto laws passed 
by the legislature, and 
the legislature can 
in turn block certain 
presidential decisions or 
appointments. Just as 
likely, however, political 
systems will feature 
unofficial veto players 
whose influence over 
the political process is 
decisive. Major political 
parties or factions 
(see p. 284), other 
government institutions, 
the military or even 
large corporations may 
have sufficient influence 
to effectively ‘veto’ 
a political decisions. 
Generally speaking, 
the more veto players 
a system has, the more 
difficult passing major 
changes becomes.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_5.indd 129 23-07-2024 13:14:46130 POLITICS
free and fair elections within a democratic political framework took place, but only 
for the white minority. Black South Africans and other non-white groups were 
disallowed from participating in the political system at all until 1984, and not on 
equal basis until 1994. Explicitly exclusive democracies are today uncommon, but 
many democracies suffer from low integration of minorities into the political system. 
In Guatemala, for instance, Mayans and other indigenous peoples make up nearly 
half the population, yet are vastly under-represented in parliament, government and 
other areas of public life.
Illiberal democracy
Finally, illiberal democracies are perhaps the most numerous category of flawed 
democracies, and generally arise in regimes where the rule of law is relatively 
weak and frequently transgressed by the government. In his pioneering accounts 
of the phenomenon, Fareed Zakaria (1997) described illiberal democracies as 
democratically elected regimes that routinely ignore constitutional limits on their 
power and deprive citizens of basic rights and freedoms. These new authoritarian 
regimes differ from both traditional dictatorships and the totalitarian regimes of the 
past. Their features include the following:
 A system of regular elections that are sufficiently free and fair to contribute, albeit 
within limits, to the maintenance of legitimacy.
 A political process characterized by personalized leadership, a strong state, weak 
opposition and emaciated checks and balances.
Argentinian President-elect Alberto Fernández receives the presidential cane from 
outgoing President Mauricio Macri in 2019. Though Argentina enjoys regular and 
relatively free elections, the presidency’s domination of the political system has led 
some to call Argentina a ‘delegative democracy’.

 A weak or partially repressed culture around civil and political rights, particularly 
in relation to freedom of the media and political protest.
 A disposition towards majoritarianism (see p. 127) is reflected in a general 
intolerance of pluralism and, maybe, hostility towards ethnic, cultural or religious 
minorities.
An ‘illiberal democracy’ can seem like a contradiction to Western observers. Yet the 
uptick in the number of regimes that can be classified as illiberal democracies around 
the world has cast doubt on the idea of a necessary link between liberalism and 
democracy. Such a link can be questioned on both theoretical and historical grounds. 
In theoretical terms, liberal democracy (see p. 108) can be viewed, at best, as an uneasy 
compromise between, on the one hand, a ‘liberal’ commitment to individual freedom 
and constitutional government and, on the other hand, a ‘democratic’ commitment to 
free, fair and competitive elections. In historical terms, the process of liberalization in the 
West did not go hand in hand with democracy – in many places it preceded the process 
of democratization, often by decades or in some cases centuries.
Perhaps the most significant cluster of illiberal democracies is to be found among 
the transition regimes of Central and Eastern Europe. In countries such as Poland, 
Romania, Hungary and Serbia, democracy did not arise through centuries of socio￾political evolution or within a context where liberalism was well established. Instead, 
it was introduced rapidly after the collapse of former totalitarian communist 
regimes, while at the same time restructuring their economies towards capitalism 
and free trade. In such cases, although the old regime was removed and democratic 
structures introduced, these new structures have yet to become universally accepted 
and embedded in political culture, nor have Western-style liberal attitudes towards 
civil rights and political discourse necessarily been imported and internalized as part 
of this process. The end result is regimes where there is perhaps greater toleration 
for closed society, forceful government action and the infringement of civil liberties 
in the pursuit of particular policy goals. This may have been amplified in Eastern 
Europe by both the emigration of generally Western-leaning, young and educated 
people, and, since 2015, the impact of the European migrant crisis in what were 
largely culturally homogeneous countries (Krastev 2018).
Many international observers and organizations that publish democratic indices, 
including Freedom House and the Varieties of Democracy Institute, have observed 
that, in recent decades, regimes gradually becoming less democratic have become 
more numerous than those becoming more democratic (Freedom House 2023; V-Dem 
Institute 2023), and the Democracy Index has found flawed democracies, rather than 
full democracies, are now the most common type around the world (Economist 
Intelligence Unit 2022). This phenomenon, known as democratic backsliding, has 
been widely studied, and though certain regions like Eastern Europe have several 
noteworthy cases, it has been observed even in relatively established democracies 
like India, Brazil and Turkey (Haggard and Kaufman 2021). Such developments have 
turned the Francis Fukuyama (see p. 124) logic of an evolution towards an increasingly 
homogeneous world of liberal-democratic capitalist systems on its head – there is 
ample evidence now that some populations are willing to accept a more compromised 
or illiberal form of democracy if it means more decisive action on other issues, like 
unemployment, inequality, economic growth, public safety, immigration and welfare.

DEBATING . . .
IS LIBERAL DEMOCRACY THE ‘DEFAULT POSITION’ FOR HUMAN 
SOCIETIES?
The seemingly relentless advance of democratization since the early nineteenth century has encouraged some to believe 
that it is a natural and inevitable process. From this perspective, all systems of rule are destined, sooner or later, to collapse 
and be remodelled on liberal-democratic lines. Yet is liberal democracy the only ‘normal’ political regime?
YES NO
Mandate of history. Modernization clearly wears a 
liberal-democratic face. Although the liberal-democratic 
mix of limited government and popular rule has only 
been around for about 200 years, it has become the 
dominant form of government worldwide. Although 
initially confined to Western Europe and North America, 
its Western ‘homeland’, liberal democracy demonstrated 
its universal appeal through its spread to India and Japan 
after the Second World War, into Latin America and 
across Eastern Europe from the 1980s onwards and, 
more recently, into the Muslim world through the Arab 
Spring. This, and further waves of democratization, 
seems set to culminate in the establishment of a world of 
liberal democracies.
The ‘transition paradigm’. Democratization is driven 
forward through a strong internal dynamic, helping to 
explain why dictatorship eventually crumbles in the face 
of advancing liberal democracy. Following an opening 
phase in which cracks appear in a dictatorial regime that 
has lost legitimacy, the regime itself collapses and a new, 
democratic system emerges in its place. Over time, 
democratic structures gain greater substance, as the new 
democratic ‘rules of the game’ come to be accepted by 
both political elites and the mass of the population. In this 
view, once competitive elections have been held, even if 
democratic imperfections persist for some time, a return 
to dictatorship is unlikely, and may be impossible.
Unrivalled performance. Liberal democracy brings a 
unique collection of humanitarian, economic and political 
benefits in its wake. Liberal democracy’s humanitarian 
benefits derive from its capacity to uphold human rights 
and afford citizens the widest possible sphere of freedom 
unchecked by the state. Its economic benefits stem 
from its intrinsic relationship with capitalist economic 
structures, helping to explain why liberal-democratic 
regimes are also prosperous and developed. Its political 
benefits are evident in its tendency towards stability and 
consensus, open and pluralist politics, ensuring that no 
significant section of the population is permanently left 
ignored. 
Global context. In the aftermath of the Second World 
War, the advance of liberal democracy was underpinned in 
significant ways by the global hegemony of the USA. This 
both gave US-style liberal democracy a powerful appeal 
worldwide and was reflected in the adoption by the USA 
of a strategy of ‘democracy promotion’, using diplomatic, 
economic and, sometimes, military means. However, the 
shift in global power, from the US-led West to Asia in 
particular, has not only diminished the USA’s willingness and 
ability to promote democracy elsewhere, but also tarnished 
the US political and economic model. It is also notable 
that rising powers such as China and Russia represent very 
different political models.
Rise of illiberal democracy. Since the late 1990s, the 
democratization process has slowed down, leading to a 
‘democratic recession’ in the first decade of the twenty￾first century (Fukuyama 2011). Instead of the overthrow 
of dictatorship and holding of elections leading irresistibly 
to democratic consolidation, many transition countries 
have been left, perhaps permanently, in a ‘grey area’. These 
states have become ‘managed’ or ‘illiberal’ democracies, in 
which a form of electoral democracy operates alongside 
weak checks and balances, and the routine intimidation of 
oppositional forces. Such arrangements reflect the capacity 
of political elites to bend democratic politics to their own 
ends.
Discontents of liberal democracy. It is by no means clear 
that liberal democracy has performance advantages over 
other systems of rule. Liberal democracy’s difficulties 
and discontents include: a tendency towards plutocracy, 
reflecting the fact that capitalism is ultimately incompatible 
with popular rule; a trend towards atomism and declining 
civic engagement; and trade-offs between personal 
freedom and majority opinion that flow from the inherent 
tension between liberalism and democracy. The rise of state 
capitalism also challenges the idea that liberal-democratic 
regimes will always be more prosperous than other regimes, 
and liberal democracy may be culturally unsuitable for the 
non-Western world.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
HUNGARY: BACKSLIDING INTO A FLAWED DEMOCRACY
Hungary is one of the most notable cases of a flawed or 
illiberal democracy to have emerged in recent decades and 
has served as an important case for scholars studying the 
concept of democratic backsliding (see p. 131). Rapidly 
opening its society, economy and political system upon the 
fall of Communism in 1991, Hungary’s transition was painful – 
unemployment, crime and inflation skyrocketed, while 
living standards and government services dramatically 
declined. Post-independence, newly formed democratic 
and socialist parties commanded the greatest electoral 
support, but both struggled to overcome stagnation and 
make progress on these deep problems.
In 2006, socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány, in an 
expletive-laden private speech, admitted his government 
had done nothing to help Hungary in its three-year run 
and had no idea what to do next. Leaked to the press, the 
speech was a political earthquake that ruined the credibility 
of the left. At the subsequent 2010 election, Viktor 
Orbán and his nationalist party Fidesz won in a landslide, 
promising to do whatever it took to restore order and 
bring the country out of recession. Orbán made good on 
his promise, leading an energetic government that passed 
a wave of populist policies such as a flat tax on income, 
windfall taxes on foreign companies and the nationalization 
of several banks, allowing the government to provide 
cheap credit and mortgages. The Hungarian economy 
improved, and unemployment fell through state-created 
job programmes. Orbán’s position was further bolstered 
through generous pension and tuition payments that 
harkened back to the communist era, and high-profile 
projects like new sports stadiums.
At the same time, the Orbán regime progressively sought 
to limit the expression of opposition to the regime and 
those who might check the government’s power. The 
expansion of state-run media, combined with laws that 
allowed the censoring of ‘scaremongering’ by independent 
media outlets, curtailed the free press. Schools, 
universities and NGOs were also increasingly subjected to 
government oversight, further muzzling oppositional views. 
New pro-regime judges were appointed and their powers 
were reduced, rendering the courts unwilling or unable to 
challenge the validity of Orbán’s acts.
Orbán’s social policies are often described as illiberal. For 
instance, Orbán’s government made homelessness illegal 
and gave the police, now less restrained by courts, wide 
powers to remove, detain or arrest what the government 
classed as ‘social undesirables’, including immigrants and 
the Romani. In 2015, Orbán made international headlines 
with his heavy-handed response to the European migrant 
crisis, using the military to secure the borders and taking 
as few refugees as possible. While these moves have been 
popular with many voters, especially older Hungarians who 
have lauded Orbán’s return to the order and uniformity 
that was enjoyed during the communist era, they have 
made Hungarian democracy more majoritarian and illiberal. 
With the Hungarian government increasingly structured 
around Orbán personally, other political institutions like 
the parliament and cabinet are becoming irrelevant to 
decision-making.
Hungary’s democratic backslide has raised significant 
concerns in international circles and strained relations with 
neighbours and the European Union. Most international 
observers by the mid-2010s agreed that Hungary could 
no longer be classed as a fully free or democratic regime. 
However, neither had it become an autocratic regime. 
Relatively open and fair elections are still held on schedule, 
and most civil and political rights remain intact. Indeed, 
Orbán’s government has continued to enjoy quite high 
levels of public support, helped by its ability to pass, 
relatively unrestrained, popular policies. Surprise initiatives 
like ‘bonus’ pension payments and fixed prices for fuel

Non Western democracies
‘Flawed’ democracies may also be an inherently Western concept – while Western 
political cultures place a high premium on individual rights and liberties, others may 
be more disposed to values that support public order and the collective good over 
individual freedoms. It has been argued that this is particularly the case in East and 
Southeast Asia, where the influence of traditional value systems like Confucianism 
may result in a political culture that is more hierarchical, communitarian and 
conformist than is the norm in the West.
For instance, observers have noted that many Asian democratic regimes have a 
similar set of characteristics. First, they are orientated more around economic goals 
than around political ones. Their overriding priority is to boost growth and deliver 
prosperity, rather than to enlarge individual freedom in the Western sense of civil 
liberty. This essentially practical concern is most evident in the ‘tiger’ economies of 
East and Southeast Asia (those of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and 
Malaysia), but it has also been demonstrated in the construction of a thriving market 
economy in China since the late 1970s, despite the survival there of monopolistic 
communist rule. Second, there is broad support for ‘strong’ government. Powerful 
ruling parties have traditionally been tolerated, and there is general respect for 
and trust in the state. Although, with low taxes and relatively low public spending 
(usually below 30 per cent of GDP), there is little room for the Western model of 
the welfare state, there is nevertheless general acceptance that the state as a ‘father 
figure’ should guide the decisions of private as well as public bodies and draw up 
strategies for national development. This characteristic is sometimes accompanied, 
third, by a general disposition to respect leaders, argued to result from a Confucian 
stress on loyalty, discipline and duty. From a Western viewpoint at least, this invests 
East Asian regimes with an implicit, and sometimes explicit, authoritarianism. 
Finally, great emphasis is placed on community and social cohesion, embodied in 
the central role accorded to the family. The resulting emphasis on what might be 
called ‘groupthink’ (see p. 401) tends to restrict the scope for the assimilation of 
ideas such as individualism and human rights, at least as these are understood in the 
West (Kim 2014).
Yet the Confucianism argument has been increasingly questioned in recent decades, 
as has the contention that democracy will inevitably look different and be more 
limited or illiberal in Asia (Lim 2014). South Korea, which operated a developmental 
(see pp. 73–74) and illiberal-democratic regime for many decades, has since the 1980s 
have been introduced in the run-up to elections to win the 
majority over.
And while the government’s heavy influence over the 
media sector helps shape the narrative, Orbán’s illiberal 
policies are no secret to the voters – indeed, for many 
they are a key reason why they continue to vote for Orbán. 
This has made discussing Hungary’s democratic credentials 
challenging, since its illiberal elements have been largely 
approved, even encouraged, by the electorate. Moreover, 
it is not yet clear what Hungary’s trajectory is – will 
democratic backsliding continue, to the point where Orbán 
becomes an outright dictator? Or is criticism of Hungary’s 
regime, as argued by Orbán, largely the result of Western￾centric views about what a democracy should look like?
CONCEPT
Confucianism
Confucianism is a 
system of ethics 
formulated by 
Confucius (551–479 
bce) and his disciples 
that was primarily 
outlined in The Analects. 
Confucian thought has 
concerned itself with 
the twin themes of 
human relations and the 
cultivation of the self. 
The emphasis on ren
(humanity or love) has 
usually been interpreted 
as implying support for 
traditional ideas and 
values; notably, filial 
piety, respect, loyalty 
and benevolence. 
The stress on junzi
(the virtuous person) 
suggests a capacity for 
human development 
and potential for 
perfection realized, 
in particular, through 
education. The role 
within and compatibility 
of Confucianism with a 
democratic culture has 
been much debated in 
recent decades.

undergone several waves of democratization. Soft authoritarianism, big-business 
influence and corruption – long-standing features of the regime – are increasingly 
not tolerated by South Korean political culture. Pro-democracy protests on a scale 
virtually unprecedented in East Asia broke out in South Korea in 2017 in response 
to corruption allegations against President Park Geun-hye, who was subsequently 
impeached and removed from office.
In short, whilst perhaps the most common type of political regime found 
internationally today, ‘flawed’ democracy is a complex and contestable classification 
with a variety of underlying drivers, making it particularly hard to make comparisons 
within this category.
Hybrid regimes
Also termed anocracies, hybrid regimes have a mixture of democratic and autocratic 
features. Just where flawed democracies end and hybrid regimes begin is not always 
easy to determine, and indices will often disagree greatly on this point, as it often 
treated as the dividing line between a democratic and non-democratic regime. Yet 
while flawed democracies generally hold free and fair elections and the rule of law 
generally (if somewhat biasedly) prevails, hybrid regimes tend to have more substantial 
issues. In such regimes, elections fall significantly short of being free and fair, and 
key institutions, like the legislature and the judiciary, are heavily compromised and 
provide inadequate checks on government power. While the machinery of democracy 
and political rights may be in place, in practice public participation, influence and 
trust in government is limited (Diamond 2002). Democracy in these systems is 
thus more of an aspiration, or perhaps a front, than reality, as the electorate does 
not have true and ongoing representation in political decision-making. Moreover, 
hybrid regimes tend to have much more widespread issues with corruption and 
infringements of civil liberties (Hameed 2022).
Many hybrid regimes are classed as such because they are not polyarchic (see p.
125) and one group, party or interest has an effective monopoly on political power. 
In many hybrid regimes, this takes the form of a dominant-party system (see p.
288–290), in which only one political party forms government, rendering elections 
somewhat meaningless because there is no real electoral competition. The dominance 
of the governing party may be maintained through restrictive election laws and 
barriers to political candidacy, lopsided access to the media, a lack of resources for 
opposition parties to campaign, and sometimes outright electoral fraud. Dominant￾party systems may also arise when the politics of a nation is highly divided along 
ethnic, religious and/or class lines, the largest group of which consistently votes to 
keep its party in power and to exclude other groups from government.
Hybrid regimes of this sort are fairly common in sub-Saharan African nations, 
where one party often has an overwhelming reputation and level of organization, 
whilst high levels of illiteracy, poverty and rurality make it difficult for an opposition 
party to resource itself or gain widespread recognition. In Zimbabwe, for instance, 
the ZANU-PF party has held power continuously since 1980. One reason is its 
formidable historical reputation as the party which won Zimbabwe’s independence. 
Another reason is ethnic – historically, ZANU-PF has been associated with the 
CONCEPT
Democratization
Democratization 
refers to the process 
of transition from 
authoritarianism to 
liberal democracy. 
Democratization 
encompasses three, 
sometimes overlapping, 
processes. (1) The 
breakdown of the old 
regime, which usually 
involves a loss of 
legitimacy (see p. *) and 
the faltering loyalty of 
the police, military or 
other institutions that 
underpin the regime’s 
power. (2) ‘Democratic 
transition’ involves 
the overhaul of the 
political system and the 
implementation of new 
democratic structures 
and processes. 
(3) ‘Democratic 
consolidation’ sees these 
new structures and 
processes becoming 
so embedded in the 
minds of elites and 
the masses so that 
democracy becomes 
the only source of 
political legitimacy 
for the new regime 
(Przeworski 1991).

Shona people, who comprise a significant majority of Zimbabwe’s population. 
Another is Zimbabwe’s low level of development – most of the country is rural and 
very poor by global standards. ZANU-PF is the only party with a presence in many 
towns and villages and has been known to distribute food and government aid in 
exchange for votes. The principal opposition party in recent decades has found its 
support concentrated amongst urban and minority Ndebele voters but has made 
limited inroads into the rural and Shona voters who make up the great majority 
of the electorate. Despite these advantages, ZANU-PF has historically left little 
to chance, and has manipulated electoral laws and voter registration processes in 
its favour and engaged in various forms of coercion to limit its opposition. While 
dominant parties might use different tactics and patterns of support to maintain 
power, the effect is the same: there is insufficient separation between the party and 
the government and a lack of independence of key political and legal institutions, so 
free and fair elections do not occur.

However, even if a hybrid regime is highly biased towards those who hold power, 
there are usually some minimum commitments to political and civil rights, and 
mechanisms in place to prevent outright domination by lone individuals. In 
neighbouring Zambia, for instance, political violence is endemic and widespread, 
and political rights are routinely infringed, undermining the legitimacy of 
elections. Corruption is high and the rule of law is relatively weak, and there is little 
independent media, such that governments in Zambia face relatively few checks on 
their rule. Zambia is, however, a multi-party state that holds regular, if distorted, 
elections. Power is periodically transferred by democratic means to different 
governing parties, and the public does have some influence and representation 
within the regime.

Some hybrid regimes may be classed as such because although they do feature 
elections and the periodic transfer of power, this occurs only within a small elite, 
preventing outside candidacies from arising. Some hybrid regimes may hold 
reasonably regular elections that may even be considered relatively free, but certain 
undemocratic institutions, like the monarchy or the military, may frequently 
intervene or remove governments and subvert the democratic will. Thailand’s 
political system, for instance, has varied wildly in its democratic classification. Since 
the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932, there have been twenty-seven national 
elections, twelve military coups and twenty constitutional revisions. Though in recent 
decades it has become a nominal parliamentary democracy with an increasingly 
democratic political culture, the Thai monarchy and military still cast a significant 
shadow, blocking governments or policies that threaten their interests. In 2023 the 
pro-democracy Move Forward emerged as the largest party in the Thai elections. 
Promising significant social and political reform, including an end to conscription 
and laws that protect the royal family from criticism, Move Forward was unacceptable 
to the military establishment. The military-appointed Senate blocked Move Forward 
from forming government, and within days the Thai Constitutional Court suspended 
the party’s leader from parliament, citing an obscure shareholding issue from fifteen 
years prior. One of Move Forward’s coalition partners was convinced to drop much 
of the reform agenda and subsequently formed a government with the military’s 
blessing, though amidst widespread public protest.
Islamic regimes
A notable set of hybrid regimes can be found in the Islamic world. The rise of Islam 
as a political force has had a profound effect on politics in North Africa, the Middle 
East and parts of Asia.
Islam is not, however, and never has been, simply a religion. Rather, it is a complete 
way of life, defining correct moral, political and economic behaviour for individuals 
and nations alike. Islam is founded upon the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad 
(570–632) as revealed in the Koran, regarded by all Muslims as the revealed word of 
God, and the Sunna, or ‘beaten path’, the traditional customs observed by a devout 
Muslim that are said to be based on the Prophet’s own life. Political Islam thus aims 
at the construction of a theocracy in which political and social affairs are structured 
according to Islamic religious principles. Nevertheless, political Islam has assumed 
clearly contrasting forms, ranging from fundamentalist to pluralist extremes.
The fundamentalist version of Islam is most commonly associated with Iran. The 
Iranian system of government is a complex mix of theocracy and democracy. The 
Supreme Leader presides over a system of institutionalized clerical rule that operates 
through the Guardian Council, a body of twelve senior clerics. Although a popularly 
elected president and parliament have been established, all legislation is ratified 
and all candidates for office are approved by the Guardian Council, which ensures 
conformity to Islamic principles. Shari’a law continues to be strictly enforced 
throughout Iran as both a legal and a moral code. Iran’s political system thus does 
not work to enforce the continued rule of a particular leader or party, as there have 
been regular transitions of power between presidents of different parties and political 
Shari’a: Islamic law, 
believed to be based on 
divine revelation, and 
derived from the Koran, 
the Hadith (the teachings 
of Muhammad), and other 
sources.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_5.indd 137 23-07-2024 13:14:47138 POLITICS
agendas. Rather, it works to limit politics to a narrow band of ideas that are tolerated 
by the Supreme Leader and the Guardian Council, preventing reform-orientated or 
non-conformist candidates from gaining power.
However, evidence that Islam is compatible with a form of political pluralism 
can be found in Malaysia. Although Islam is the official state religion of Malaysia 
(see p. 329), with the Paramount Ruler serving as both religious leader and head 
of state, a functional if flawed democracy has emerged there. Though its post￾independence politics has been historically dominated by the nationalist and 
socially conservative United Malays National Organisation, the country features 
a multi-party system of regular elections, and opposition parties have been in 
power since 2018. By most measures, Malaysia has progressively become more 
democratic over the past two decades, with most parties and the public at large 
endorsing a democratic culture, though not necessarily a liberal, democratic 
one. Islamic law and teachings still heavily influence the application of law and 
interpretation of civil liberties, and political participation, speech and pluralism 
are somewhat constrained (Abdullah 2020).
Successful hybrid regimes
Hybrid regimes can be both effective and popularly supported. Singapore is an 
instructive example of a hybrid regime of this type. One of the most developed nations 
in the world, Singapore’s dramatic rise from a far-flung colonial port to an international 
trading entrepôt has been the envy of many of its neighbours. This rise occurred 
under the auspices of the People’s Action Party (PAP), which has ruled Singapore 
continuously since independence, and for long periods has won every single seat in 
the national legislature. This had made Singapore a de facto one-party state, and while 
elections are regular and unmarred by fraud, they are also heavily slanted in favour 
of the PAP through complex election laws that make it difficult for the opposition 
to field candidates or effectively campaign. The PAP completely dominates the legal 
system, bureaucracy and education system, while non-PAP organizations like trade 
unions and civil society groups have significant limitations placed on their operations. 
A strong corporatist (see p. 304) model of government pervades, where commercial 
and industrial conglomerates exercise significant influence over decision-making.
Western observers have long critiqued the Singaporean regime on democratic 
grounds, particularly during the reign of its longest serving prime minister, Lee Kuan 
Yew, who ruled Singapore virtually unopposed from 1959 to 1990. Yew strenuously 
defended the regime on the international stage, noting that Asian values were not 
the same as Western ones, and democracy was a relative concept. Yew also pointed 
out Singapore’s flourishing economy and dramatic improvements in the quality of 
life, at the same time noting that results in nearby ‘full’ democracies, like India, had 
been comparatively poor (Zakaria 1994). Moreover, there are few indications that the 
public are dissatisfied with the system. Public polling has routinely demonstrated that 
Singaporeans have some of the highest trust and satisfaction with their government 
in the world – far higher in some cases than those living in mature democracies. In 
this sense, the legitimacy of the Singaporean regime rests far more on its performance 
(see p. 93) as a manager of the economy than it does on its democratic credentials.
CONCEPT
Theocracy
Theocracy (literally ‘rule 
by God’) is the principle 
that religious authority 
should prevail over 
political authority. A 
theocracy is therefore 
a regime in which 
government posts are 
filled on the basis of 
the person’s position in 
the religious hierarchy. 
Theocratic rule is illiberal 
in two senses. First, 
it violates the public/
private divide, in that 
it takes religious rules 
and precepts to be 
the guiding principles 
of both personal life 
and political conduct. 
Second, it invests 
political authority with 
potentially unlimited 
power, because, as 
temporal power is 
derived from spiritual 
wisdom, it cannot 
be based on popular 
consent, or be properly 
constrained within 
a constitutional 
framework.

While many hybrid regimes represent incomplete democratic transitions or cynical 
misappropriation of democracy, examples like Singapore present a challenge to the 
notion that liberal democracy is an unqualified good and represents the end stage of 
political evolution – political systems involve trade-offs between competing values 
and imperatives, and societies can justifiably differ on which trade-offs they are 
willing to make. In short, as surmised by Henry Hale (2010), ‘hybrid regimes have 
their own distinct dynamics that do not simply amount to half of what we would see 
in a democracy plus half of what we would see in an autocracy’.
Authoritarian regimes
The Polity data series is one of the longest running that has attempted to track the world’s 
political regimes. When the project began in the late 1960s, authoritarian regimes – 
ones in which power is concentrated in the hands of an unelected elite – were the norm 
internationally, making up more than half of all governments. Since the end of the Cold 
War and the ‘third wave’ of democratization, the situation has changed dramatically – 
now the large majority of regimes, more than three-quarters, are considered by Polity
to be democratic or at least a hybrid regime of some kind. Other democratic indices 
have tended to be more expansive in their definition of authoritarian regimes, and 
democratic backsliding (see p. 131) in recent years has seen more regimes moving 
towards the authoritarian pole than away from it (V-Dem Institute 2023). Explicitly 
autocratic regimes, like absolute monarchies, are now rare in the contemporary world. 
But many nominally democratic regimes are still authoritarian in all but name.
Authoritarian regimes remain an important category, in part because several of the world’s 
largest nations, most notably China, have explicitly embraced them. Authoritarianism

CONCEPT
Authoritarianism
Authoritarianism is a 
belief in, or practice 
of, government 
‘from above’, in 
which authority is 
exercised regardless 
of popular consent. 
Authoritarianism thus 
differs from authority, 
as the latter rests on 
legitimacy, and so 
arises ‘from below’. 
Authoritarian regimes 
emphasize the claims 
of authority over 
those of individual 
liberty. However, 
authoritarianism is 
usually distinguished 
from totalitarianism (see 
p. 78). Authoritarianism, 
associated with 
monarchical absolutism, 
traditional dictatorships 
and most forms of 
military rule, seeks to 
exclude the masses 
from politics rather than 
abolish civil society.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_5.indd 139 23-07-2024 13:14:48140 POLITICS
has many different forms, as for much of human history most governments were 
variations of autocracy. During the lives of liberal political philosophers like John Locke 
(see p. 32) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (see p. 105) in the eighteenth century, nearly 
every state in the world was governed by a near-absolute monarch with few constraints 
on their power and even fewer democratic institutions. Today such regimes are a thing 
of the past, and nearly every state has undergone some degree of democratization since. 
Yet occasionally new autocracies have arisen, usually in response to the collapse of 
a political system or pressures like war and social disorder. Though they take many 
names, authoritarian regimes today generally take on of three forms:
 personalist regimes
 one-party states
 military regimes.
Personalist regimes
Personalist regimes are those where a single individual has a stranglehold on 
power and effectively rules government personally. Though sometimes called 
dictatorships, that term can be more broadly applied to other autocracies where 
larger groups of individuals rule, while personalist regimes are the narrowest 
form. In personalist regimes, the leader hand-picks the ruling elite, often their 
close friends and family members, and use those appointments to dominate 
all institutions, particularly the military and police. Personalist regimes may 
incorporate a cult of personality around the leader (see p. 367), whose image 
dominates public and political life. Because they are so utterly bound with an 
individual, personalist regimes tend to be unpredictable and prone to sudden 
policy changes. Such regimes are often marked by the absence of the basic features 
of modern government. Eritrea, for example, has been ruled since 1993 by Isaias 
Afwerki. After war with Ethiopia broke out in 1998, Isaias has progressively 
removed most checks on his power, suspending elections and governing the 
country personally through a clique of hand-picked generals and confidants. The 
cabinet rarely meets, there are no official budgets published and the country is 
ruled by presidential decree. The legislature has not met since 2002 and a special 
court system controlled by the president has been established with the power to 
overrule any decisions made by regular courts. Personalist regimes such as these 
are brittle – if the leader dies or is rendered incapable, the regime can quickly 
collapse or a bitter and violent struggle over succession may follow.
Some personalist regimes do have mechanisms for succession, however. The more 
formalized and traditional version of a personalist regime is an absolute monarchy, 
in which power is still concentrated entirely in a single person, but their power is 
legitimated more explicitly due to their membership of a traditional ruling family. 
Though monarchies were once the norm, many were abolished or transitioned to 
constitutional monarchies throughout the twentieth century – only a handful of 
absolute monarchies still exist. Saudi Arabia is perhaps the most prominent example, 
where the House of Saud has ruled since the nation’s formation in 1932. The king 
remains the most powerful figure in the state, and nearly all major state institutions 
are controlled by members of the very large Saudi royal family – around 200 princes 
occupy all major ministries, governorships and political posts.
Constitutional monarchy:
A political system 
where the powers of 
the monarch are limited 
and bound by laws and 
conventions, and power is 
shared with other bodies.
CONCEPT
Dictatorship
A dictatorship is, strictly, 
a form of rule in which 
absolute power is vested 
in one individual; in 
this sense, dictatorship 
is synonymous with 
autocracy. Dictators are 
thus seen as being above 
the law and as acting 
beyond constitutional 
constraints. Early 
examples of dictators 
were Sulla, Julius 
Caesar and Augustus 
Caesar in Rome, 
more recent ones are 
Hitler, Mussolini and 
Saddam Hussein. More 
generally, dictatorship 
is characterized by the 
arbitrary and unchecked 
exercise of power, as 
in ‘class dictatorship’, 
‘military dictatorship’ 
and ‘personal 
dictatorship’.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_5.indd 140 23-07-2024 13:14:48REGIMES AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS 141
Some personalist regimes do try and legitimate themselves through a façade of 
democracy, a phenomenon sometimes called electoral authoritarianism. Such 
elections can provide just enough democratic theatre to satisfy some sections of the 
electorate or to avoid too much scrutiny from the international community. Paul Biya, 
President of Cameroon since 1980, has been argued to be an archetypical example. 
Elections in Cameroon nominally exist, but they are not run on regular schedules, 
and when they are held are so stage-managed that most of the population do not 
bother to participate in them. A large class of post-communist states falls into this 
category, such as Turkmenistan, Belarus and Azerbaijan, where after a brief period of 
liberalization and democratization in the 1990s, cliques of powerful individuals have 
taken power and effectively halted the transition, running regimes that maintain the 
illusion of democracy but in fact operate much as they did previously.
One-party regimes
One-party states are those in which all power is held by a single political party. Unlike 
dominant-party systems, opposition to the ruling party is illegal and any elections 
held only allow candidates from the ruling party to run. One-party states are almost 
exclusively a holdover from the Cold War, as traditional Marxist–Leninist systems 
held that only a party constituted to establish a communist system were entitled to 
lead a worker’s state (see p. 288). As such, all key positions in the government are 
held by party members. China, Vietnam and Cuba are contemporary examples of 
one-party states.
In one-party states, status within the party, rather than in government, is more 
important, and the leader of the party is thus the most powerful individual within 
the state, regardless of what government titles they might hold. Such parties may 
be meritocratic, insofar as talented party members may rise through the ranks and 
ultimately become the leader. Most communist parties are also nominally democratic, 
insofar as its rank-and-file membership are allowed to vote for their regional and 
national delegates, who in turn may form party congresses and committees who 
vote on policy and elect leaders. In practice, though, collective solidarity is usually 
enforced, and power struggles take place behind the scenes between elites, with 
internal elections serving only as rubber stamps to approve what has already been 
negotiated by key leaders and factions.
One-party systems though are perhaps more capable of renewal and change than 
personalist regimes, and in contemporary examples, leadership tends to be collective 
rather than concentrated. The general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party 
is technically the most powerful individual in the Vietnamese political system, though 
in practice power is shared fairly evenly between the general secretary, prime minister, 
president and the secretariat and central committee of the party. Semi-regular power 
transitions occur, alternative factions are permitted and opposing viewpoints within 
the party are aired and sometimes do get adopted, such as Vietnam’s transition to a 
market-oriented socialist economy in the 1990s, a radical shift from its traditional 
position. All this takes place within a controlled environment of party elites – there 
is no genuine public input into these processes. However, there is some receptivity to 
pressure from the public and the rank-and-file of the party. When the Việt Á scandal 
came to light in 2021, revealing significant corruption amongst government and party

officials in the implementation of Vietnam’s response to Covid-19, widespread public 
and party outcry resulted in numerous high-profile prosecutions, and ultimately the 
resignation of President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc in 2023. (One-party states are covered in 
more detail in Chapter 11.)
Military regimes
Whereas most regimes are shaped by a combination of political, economic, cultural 
and ideological factors, some survive through the exercise, above all, of military 
power and systematic repression. The key feature of a military regime is that the 
leading posts in the government are filled on the basis of the person’s position within 
the military chain of command. Military regimes often arise as a result of a coup 
d’état, in which the government is forcibly removed from power. Normal political 
and constitutional arrangements are usually suspended, and institutions through 
which opposition can be expressed, such as elected assemblies and a free press, are 
either weakened or abolished.
Coup d’état: (French)

seizure of government 
power through illegal and 
unconstitutional action.

second that year, Ibrahim Traoré is sworn in by the military as the transitional 
President of Burkina Faso.

In some military regimes, the armed forces assume direct control of government. 
This operates as a form of collective military administration centred on a command 
council of officers who usually represent the major branches of armed services. Such 
regimes, also called juntas, are often characterized by rivalry between the services 
and between leading figures, the consequence being that formal positions of power 
tend to change hands relatively frequently.
Junta: (Spanish) Literally, 
‘a council’; a (usually 
military) clique that

The second form of military regime is a military-backed personalized dictatorship. 
In these cases, a single individual gains pre-eminence within the junta, often being 
bolstered by a cult of personality (see p. 367) designed to manufacture charismatic 
authority. Such is the case in Egypt, where General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power 
after the 2013 coup. El-Sisi was just one of a group of officers that overthrew the 
regime, but he established himself as its principal spokesperson, and then after an 
interim period resigned his military posts in order to take office as the new Egyptian 
president. Naturally, though, el-Sisi’s power continues to be sustained by the military 
he used to lead. Outright military regimes are increasingly rare, and those that do 
arise will quickly find, as they did in Egypt, a way to transform to a civilian form of 
government, at least for appearances’ sake.
Because the military represents the coercive force of a state, its power to determine the 
life or death of a regime is theoretically enormous. While in established democratic 
regimes prevailing political culture and norms prevent military interference in 
civilian and government affairs, in regimes where a democratic or civic political 
culture is not well embedded, or where the military maintains significant economic 
and social interests, the threat of military intervention is much higher (Finer 1975). 
However, the specific motives behind the formation of military regimes, and their 
consequences, can vary greatly. Many military regimes justify their legitimacy as 
temporary interventions into the political process in order to restore stability, protect 
civilians or even defend democracy. In 2005 in Mauritania, a military junta called 
the Military Council for Justice and Democracy deposed President Maaouya Ould 
Sid’Ahmed Taya, citing his government’s increasingly authoritarian and repressive 
policies, and promised a transitional regime to hold democratic elections in which 
no member of the junta would run. The junta made good on its promise and handed 
power to an elected civilian government in 2007. Other military regimes have arisen 
as a response to grave threats to the state. In 2022, the military of Burkina Faso 
deposed the elected government and took power, largely in response to the rapidly 
deteriorating security situation in the country caused by a Jihadist uprising which 
since 2015 has seized more than a third of the country. In such circumstances, the 
public may be receptive, even grateful, for military interventions. However, military 
regimes have a marked inclination to endure far longer than a ‘transition’ period 
would suggest, entrenching themselves as ongoing authoritarian regimes. Yet 
because the power and legitimacy of these regimes are entirely in the hands of the 
military, and usually tied to the authority and appeal of a singular leader, they can 
also be brittle and unpredictable. Coups tend to trigger more coups and can lead 
to prolonged periods of instability. Only in a relatively small number of cases, such 
as Myanmar, have military regimes become institutionalized with peaceful internal 
transitions of power between leaders.
While liberal democracy may not be the only model for legitimate rule in the twenty￾first century, the ideal of democracy is so deeply entrenched in modern political 
discourse that even authoritarian regimes find it necessary to at least maintain its 
façade. Thus, while there are other ways to classify political systems beyond their 
democratic credentials, no others are as well studied or influential, nor as important 
to understanding and comparing modern political regimes.

PREVIEW
For the last 200 years, the nation has been regarded as the most appropriate (and perhaps the only proper) unit 
of political rule. Indeed, international law is largely based on the assumption that nations, like individuals, have 
inviolable rights; notably, the right to political independence and self-determination. Nowhere, however, is the 
importance of the nation more dramatically demonstrated than in the potency of nationalism as a political creed. In 
many ways, nationalism has dwarfed the more precise and systematic political ideologies examined in Chapter 2. It 
has contributed to the outbreak of wars and revolutions. It has caused the birth of new states, the disintegration of 
empires and the redrawing of borders; and it has been used to reshape existing regimes, as well as to bolster them.
However, nationalism is a complex and highly diverse political phenomenon. Not only are there distinctive 
political and cultural forms of nationalism, but the political implications of nationalism have been wide-ranging 
and sometimes contradictory. This has occurred because nationalism has been linked to very different ideological 
traditions, ranging from liberalism to fascism. It has therefore been associated, for instance, with both the quest 
for national independence and projects of imperial expansion. There are also reasons to believe that the age of the 
nation may be drawing to a close. The nation-state, the goal that generations of nationalists have strived to achieve, 
is increasingly beset by pressures, both internal and external.

WHAT IS A NATION?
Many of the controversies surrounding the phenomenon of nationalism can be traced 
back to rival views about what constitutes a nation. So widely accepted is the idea of 
the nation that its distinctive features are seldom examined or questioned; that our 
world is divided up into nations is simply taken for granted. Nevertheless, confusion 
abounds. The term ‘nation’ tends to be used with little precision, and is often used 
interchangeably with terms such as ‘state’, ‘country’, ‘ethnic group’ and ‘race’. The 
United Nations, for instance, is technically misnamed, as it is actually an organization 
of states rather than national populations. What, then, are the characteristic features 
of the nation? What distinguishes a nation from any other social group, or other 
sources of collective identity?
The difficulty of defining the term ‘nation’ springs from the fact that all nations 
comprise a mixture of objective and subjective features, a blend of cultural and 
political characteristics. In objective terms, nations are cultural entities: groups 
of people who speak the same language, have the same religion, are bound by a 
shared past and so on. Such factors undoubtedly shape the politics of nationalism. 
The nationalism of the Québécois in Canada, for instance, is principally rooted in 
the linguistic differences between French-speaking Quebec and the predominantly 
English-speaking rest of Canada. In India, several nationalist movements have been 
motivated by religion, such as the struggle of Sikhs in Punjab for a separate homeland 
(Khalistan), and the campaign by Muslims for the incorporation of Kashmir into 
Pakistan. Nevertheless, it is impossible to define a nation using objective factors 
alone, as all nations encompass some degree of cultural and ethnic diversity. The 
Swiss nation has proved to be enduring and viable despite the use of three major 
languages (French, German and Italian) along with a variety of local dialects. 
Religion is not a unifying factor either, as the population is fairly evenly divided 
between Catholicism, Protestantism and secularism.
This emphasizes the fact that, ultimately, nations can only be defined subjectively 
by their members. In the final analysis, the nation is a psycho-political construct. 
What sets a nation apart from any other group is that its members regard 
themselves to be nation – it is a shared belief. Switzerland is a nation because 
its population believes it is, united by a common history and set of values, like 
neutrality, punctuality and a love of cheese. The Anglo-Irish political theorist 
Benedict Anderson (1936–2015) thus concludes that a nation is really an ‘imagined 
community’ (Anderson 1983).
This is what distinguishes a nation from an ethnic group. An ethnic group
undoubtedly possesses a communal identity and a sense of cultural pride, but, unlike 
a nation, it lacks collective political aspirations for independence or statehood. On 
a more modest level, however, they may consist of a desire to achieve a measure of 
autonomy, perhaps as part of a federation or confederation of states. For example, 
African Americans are an important ethnic group in the United States. While 
black nationalism (see pp. 148–149) has periodically gained popularity amongst 
some communities, most African Americans have generally not sought their own 
independent state. Rather, their political goals have been to secure respect, equality 
and equal rights as members of the American nation.
Ethnic group: A group 
of people who share a 
common cultural and 
historical identity, typically 
linked to a belief in 
common descent.
CONCEPT
Nation
Nations are complex 
phenomena that are 
shaped by a collection 
of factors. Culturally, 
a nation is a group 
of people bound 
together by a common 
language, religion, 
history and traditions, 
although nations 
exhibit various levels of 
cultural heterogeneity. 
Politically, a nation is 
a group of people who 
regard themselves 
as a natural political 
community, classically 
expressed through 
the quest for 
sovereign statehood. 
Psychologically, a nation 
is a group of people 
distinguished by a shared 
loyalty or affection in 
the form of patriotism 
(see p. 157).

The complexity does not end there, however. Nationalism is a diverse political 
phenomenon, and national identities evolve over time. Historically, two roots of 
nationalism – as cultural communities and as political communities – have been 
important in exploring the origins of the phenomenon, but all nations incorporate 
aspects of both.
KEY THINKER
JOHANN GOTTFRIED HERDER (1744–1803)
German poet, critic and philosopher, often portrayed as the ‘father’ of cultural nationalism. 
A teacher and Lutheran clergyman, Herder travelled throughout Europe before settling in 
Weimar in 1776, as the clerical head of the Grand Duchy. Although influenced in his early life 
by thinkers such as Kant (see p. 461), Rousseau (see p. 105) and Montesquieu (see p. 375),
he became a leading intellectual opponent of the Enlightenment and a crucial influence on the 
growth in Germany of the romantic movement. Herder’s emphasis on the nation as an organic 
group characterized by a distinctive language, culture and ‘spirit’ helped both to found cultural 
history, and to give rise to a particular form of nationalism that emphasized the intrinsic value 
of national culture.

Nations as cultural communities
The idea that a nation is essentially a cultural entity has been described as the 
‘primary’ concept of the nation (Lafont 1968). Its roots can be traced back to late 
eighteenth-century Germany and the writings of figures such as Johann Gottfried 
Herder and Johann Gottfried Fichte (1762–1814). For Herder, the innate character 
of each national group was ultimately determined by its natural environment, climate 
and physical geography, which shaped the lifestyle, working habits, attitudes and 
creative propensities of a people. A people’s faith, customs, traditions and shared 
history were thus the pillars upon which a sense of national unity was constructed. 
Above all, however, he emphasized the importance of language, which he believed 
was the embodiment of a people’s distinctive traditions and historical memories. In 
his view, each nation thus possesses a Volksgeist, which reveals itself in songs, myths 
and legends, and provides a nation with its source of creativity. Herder’s nationalism 
amounts to a form of culturalism that emphasizes an awareness and appreciation 
of national traditions and collective memories instead of an overtly political quest 
for statehood. Such ideas had a profound impact on the awakening of national 
consciousness in nineteenth-century Europe, reflected in the rediscovery of ancient 
myths and legends. Take, for example, the Kalevala, an 1835 anthology of Finnish￾language folk tales and myths, which was one of the catalysts that helped to define 
a Finnish identity and unified a people long dominated by Sweden and Russia to 
establish themselves as a new Finnish nation.
The implication of Herder’s culturalism is that nations are organic entities 
that can be traced back to ancient times and will, by the same token, continue 
to exist as long as human society survives. A similar view has been advanced 
Volksgeist: (German) 
Literally, the spirit of 
the people; the organic 
identity of a people 
reflected in their culture 
and, particularly, their 
language.
Culturalism: The belief 
that human beings 
are culturally defined 
creatures, culture being 
the universal basis for 
personal and social 
identity.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_6.indd 147 23-07-2024 12:38:27148 POLITICS
by modern social psychologists, who point to the tendency of people to form 
groups to gain a sense of security, identity and belonging. From this perspective, 
the division of humankind into nations reflects nothing more than the natural 
human propensity to draw close to people who share a culture, background and 
lifestyle that is similar to their own. Cultural nationalism commonly takes the 
form of national self-affirmation; it is a means by which a people can acquire 
a clearer sense of its own identity through the heightening of national pride 
and self-respect.
However, these perspectives overlook the fact that cultural nationalism can be the 
product of deliberate shaping as much as organic evolution. Though language is 
the starting point for many national identities, in the sense that a shared language 
is usually the medium through which a culture is created, much of the linguistic 
unity that we imagine nations possessing today is the result of deliberate policies of 
homogenization. For example, the many dialects of the Occitan language family once 
defined southern France, while the Celtic Breton language dominated the Brittany 
peninsula. Starting in the sixteenth century, and particularly in centuries after the 
French Revolution, language policies were put in place to cultivate a stronger sense 
of national unity and to strengthen political control over the provinces. With French 
enforced as the only language of government, newspapers, schools and churches, 
much of France’s linguistic diversity disappeared within a couple of generations, 
helping to create a more unified French national culture, but largely at the expense 
of dozens of cultural nations that once existed.
So cultural nationalism is not static, and it is also not limited to nations with ancient 
origins or shared languages, as romantically imagined by Herder. The modern state 
of Israel is constructed around the concept of a homeland for the Jewish people, a 
concept that emerged in the nineteenth century. Though Judaism is the most obvious 
basis of Israeli nationalism, the shared experience of extreme persecution during the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries is arguably just as relevant. And, initially, there 
was no shared language – Israel was formed by millions of refugees and immigrants 
from across the world. To facilitate a common tongue, the ancient Semitic language 
of Hebrew was revived and standardized into Modern Hebrew, which helped solidify 
Israeli nationalism, but also made it increasingly distinct from the rest of the Jewish 
diaspora – today, surveys reveal significant differences in language, culture and 
politics between Israeli and non-Israeli Jews.
Moreover, cultural nationalism can be expressed in the absence of statehood and 
formal political independence. Black nationalism in the USA, the West Indies and 
many parts of Europe, for instance, has a strong cultural character. Its emphasis is on 
the development of a distinctively black consciousness and sense of national pride, 
which, in the work of Marcus Garvey (see p. 149) and Malcolm X (1925–65), was 
linked to the rediscovery of Africa as a spiritual and cultural ‘homeland’ (Pinkey 
1976). And the Romani diaspora, spread across the world but particularly Europe 
and Latin America, are notable in sharing a distinctive culture, history and identity, 
yet explicitly do not demand statehood or desire even to participate in the nation￾state, traditionally arguing instead for their right to exist in peace and in their own 
closed communities.

At the extreme end of cultural nationalism is what can be termed ethnic 
nationalism. Ethnic nationalism argues that membership in the nation is rooted 
in heredity and continuity, and that simply adopting the language and mores of a 
culture is insufficient. Though this interpretation was rejected by Herder, his ideas 
nonetheless were used by others to justify racialist theories of nationhood, which 
ultimately formed the basis for some of the most extreme ideological movements of 
the twentieth century, and ultimately policies such as genocide (see p. 476).
Ethnic and cultural nationalism are hard concepts to fully disentangle, though, and, indeed, 
tensions between the two have always been the source of significant political and social 
friction. First-generation immigrants, even those who adopt the language and customs 
of their new nations, have often struggled to gain true acceptance, and it may take several 
generations before certain outgroups are fully integrated into a cultural nation. Moreover, 
some nations are rooted so deeply in racial experiences that accepting non-ethnic members 
is very difficult. The legacy of apartheid and the violent oppression of the black majority in 
South Africa historically by the white elite, for instance, have made it difficult for whites to gain 
full acceptance as South Africans in the post-apartheid era. Ethnic and cultural nationalism 
has undergone a notable resurgence in the West in recent decades through white nationalist 
and populist movements, often out of opposition to multiculturalism, globalization and the 
evolution of more ‘open’ national cultures (see pp. 221–222) (Schertzer and Woods 2022.)
Nations as political communities
The view that nations are essentially political entities emphasizes civic loyalties and 
political allegiances, rather than cultural identity. The nation is, thus, a group of 
people who are bound together primarily by shared citizenship, regardless of their 
cultural, ethnic and other loyalties. This view of the nation is often traced back to the 
writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (see p. 105). Although Rousseau did not specifically 
address the nation question, or discuss the phenomenon of nationalism, his stress 
on popular sovereignty (see p. 325), expressed in the idea of the ‘general will’, was 
Ethnic nationalism:
A closed concept of 
nationalism that is derived 
through descent from 
previous generations.
KEY THINKER
MARCUS GARVEY (1887–1940)
Jamaican political thinker and activist, and an early advocate of black nationalism. Garvey 
was the founder in 1914 of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). He 
left Jamaica for New York in 1916, where his message of black pride and economic self￾sufficiency gained him a growing following, particularly in Harlem. Although his black 
business enterprises failed, and his call for a return to Africa was largely ignored, Garvey’s 
emphasis on establishing black pride and his vision of Africa as a ‘homeland’ provided the 
basis for the later Black Power movement. Rastafarianism is also based largely on his ideas. 
Garvey was imprisoned for mail fraud in 1923, and was later deported, eventually dying in 
obscurity in London.

the seed from which nationalist doctrines sprang during the French Revolution of 
1789. In proclaiming that government should be based on the general will, Rousseau 
developed a powerful critique of monarchical power and aristocratic privilege. 
During the French Revolution, this principle of radical democracy was reflected in 
the assertion that the French people were ‘citizens’ possessed of inalienable rights 
and liberties, no longer merely ‘subjects’ of the crown. The form of nationalism 
that emerged from the French Revolution, therefore, embodied a vision of a people 
or nation governing itself, and was inextricably linked to the principles of liberty, 
equality and fraternity.
The idea that nations are political, not ethnic, communities has been supported by a 
number of theories of nationalism. Eric Hobsbawm (1983), for instance, highlighted 
the degree to which nations are ‘invented’ traditions. Rather than accepting that modern 
nations have developed out of long-established ethnic communities, Hobsbawm 
argued that a belief in historical continuity and cultural purity was invariably a myth, 
and, what is more, a myth created by nationalism itself. In this view, nationalism creates 
nations, not the other way round. A widespread consciousness of nationhood amongst 
the general population did not, for example, develop until the late nineteenth century, 
perhaps fashioned by the invention of national anthems and national flags, and the 
extension of primary education. Certainly, the idea of a ‘mother tongue’ passed down 
from generation to generation and embodying a national culture is highly questionable. 
Languages live and grow as each generation adapts the language to its own distinctive 
needs and circumstances. Moreover, it can be argued that the notion of a ‘national’ 
language is an absurdity, given the fact that, until the nineteenth century, the majority 
of people had no knowledge of the written form of their language and usually spoke a 
regional dialect that had little in common with the language of the educated elite.
Benedict Anderson (1983) also portrayed the modern nation as an artefact, in his case 
as an ‘imagined community’. Anderson pointed out that nations exist more as mental 
images than as genuine communities that require a level of face-to-face interaction to 
sustain the notion of a common identity. Within nations, individuals only ever meet 
a tiny proportion of those with whom they supposedly share a national identity. If 
nations exist, they exist as imagined artifices, constructed for us through education, the 
mass media and a process of political socialization (see p. 224). Whereas in Rousseau’s 
view a nation is animated by ideas of democracy and political freedom, the notion 
that nations are ‘invented’ or ‘imagined’ communities has more in common with the 
Marxist belief that nationalism is a species of bourgeois ideology. From the perspective 
of orthodox Marxism, nationalism is a device through which the ruling class counters 
the threat of social revolution by ensuring that national loyalty is stronger than class 
solidarity, thus binding the working class to the existing power structure.
Whether nations spring out of a desire for liberty and democracy or are merely 
cunning inventions of political elites or a ruling class, nationalism in which citizenship, 
ideology and values have greater political significance than ethnic, linguistic or 
cultural identity can be termed civic nationalism. Nations with a civic, rather than 
cultural, basis naturally tend to be marked by greater cultural heterogeneity. The 
USA is an archetypical example. As a ‘land of immigrants’, the USA has a distinctively 
multi-ethnic and multicultural character, which makes it challenging to construct 
a national identity primarily based on cultural and historical ties. Instead, a sense

of American nationhood has been consciously developed through the educational 
system, and through the cultivation of respect for a set of common values, notably 
those outlined in the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution. What 
such nations have in common is that, in theory, they were founded on a voluntary 
acceptance of a common set of principles or goals, as opposed to an existing cultural 
identity. It is sometimes argued that the style of nationalism that develops in such 
societies is typically tolerant and democratic. If a nation is primarily a political 
entity, it is an inclusive group, in that membership is not restricted to those who 
fulfil particular linguistic, religious, ethnic or suchlike criteria.
On the other hand, civic nationalism may at times fail to experience the organic 
unity and sense of historical rootedness that is found in cultural nations. For 
instance, after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the newly created 
state of Yugoslavia included within its borders more than a dozen distinct languages 
and peoples, including Croats, Bosnians, Serbs, Montenegrins, Slovenes and 
Macedonians. For almost a century, the Yugoslav state attempted to displace these 
traditional ethnic group identities with a new pan-Slavic civic nationalism. Efforts 
were particularly intense during the communist period, when leaders, schools 
and the state media constantly promoted brotherhood and unity amongst Slavic 
peoples and attempted to construct a new multicultural national concept focused 
on socialism, equality and progress. Yet despite decades of effort, ethnic divisions 
remained potent, prompting several political crises and constitutional revisions. 
When the communist regime collapsed in 1991, referendums held in the constituent 
republics returned near-unanimous results in favour of breaking up Yugoslavia into 
new nations based on traditional linguistic, cultural and ethnic boundaries.
On the anniversary of the death of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, an admirer holds 
flags of both the historical nation of Yugoslavia and the modern nation of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina. Many people in the Balkans embrace more than one cultural and 
even national identity.

DEBATING . . .
ARE NATIONS ‘NATURAL’ POLITICAL COMMUNITIES?
Nationalism is based on two core assumptions: first, that humankind is naturally divided into distinct nations and, second, 
that the nation is the most appropriate, and perhaps only legitimate, unit of political rule. This is why nationalists have 
strived, wherever possible, to bring the borders of the state into line with the boundaries of the nation. But is humankind 
‘naturally’ divided into distinct nations? And why should the national communities be accorded this special, indeed unique, 
political status?
YES NO
‘Natural’ communities: For primordialist scholars, 
national identity is historically embedded: nations are 
rooted in a common cultural heritage and language 
that may long predate statehood or the quest for 
independence (Smith 1986). In this view, nations evolve 
organically out of more simple ethnic communities, 
reflecting the fact that people are inherently group￾orientated, drawn naturally towards others who are 
similar to themselves because they share the same 
cultural characteristics. Above all, national identity is 
forged by a combination of a sense of territorial belonging 
and a shared way of life (usually facilitated by a common 
language), creating deep emotional attachments that 
resemble kinship ties.
Vehicle for democracy: The nation acquired a political 
character only when, thanks to the doctrine of nationalism, 
it was seen as the ideal unit of self-rule, a notion 
embodied in the principle of national self-determination. 
Nationalism and democracy therefore go hand in hand. 
Bound together by ties of national solidarity, people 
are encouraged to adopt shared civic allegiances and 
to participate fully in the life of their society. Moreover, 
democratic nations are inclusive and tolerant, capable 
of respecting the separate identities of minority groups. 
Nationality, thus, does not suppress other sources of 
personal identity, such as ethnicity and religion.
Benefits of national partiality: Nationalism inevitably 
implies partiality, the inclination to favour the needs 
and interests of one’s ‘own’ people over those of other 
peoples. This, as communitarian theorists argue, reflects 
the fact that morality begins at home. From this 
perspective, morality only makes sense when it is locally 
based, grounded in the communities to which we belong, 
and which have shaped our lives and values. National 
partiality is thus an extension of the near-universal 
inclination to accord moral priority to those we know 
best, especially our families and close friends. There 
is no reason, moreover, why national partiality should 
preclude a moral concern for ‘strangers’.
‘Invented’ communities: Rather than being natural or 
organic entities, nations are, to a greater or lesser extent, 
political constructs. Nations are certainly ‘imagined 
communities’, in the sense that people only ever meet a 
tiny proportion of those with whom they supposedly share 
a national identity (Anderson 1983). Marxists and others go 
further and argue that ruling or elite groups have ‘invented’ 
nationalism in order to bind the working class, and the 
disadvantaged generally, to the existing power structure 
(Hobsbawm 1983). National anthems, national flags and 
national myths and legends are thus little more than a form 
of ideological manipulation.
‘Hollowed-out’ nations: The nation has had its day as a 
meaningful political unit and as a basis for democracy and 
citizenship. Nations were appropriate political communities 
during an industrial age that was shaped through the 
development of relatively discrete national economies. 
However, the growth of an interdependent world, and 
the transfer of decision-making authority from national 
governments to intergovernmental or supranational bodies, 
has seriously weakened the political significance of the 
nation. Not only have nations been ‘hollowed out’ in terms 
of their political role, but the seemingly remorseless trends 
towards international migration and cultural diversity have 
fatally compromised the nation’s organic unity (if it ever 
existed).
Miniaturizing humanity: National identity encourages 
people to identify with part of humanity, rather than with 
humanity as a whole. As such, it narrows our moral sensibilities 
and destroys our sense of a common humanity. Worse, 
nationalism breeds inevitable division and conflict. If one’s 
own nation is unique or ‘special’, other nations are inevitably 
seen as inferior and possibly threatening. Nationalism 
therefore gives rise to, not a world of independent nation￾states, but a world that is scarred by militarism, aggression 
and conquest. For humankind to progress beyond struggle 
and war, nationalism must be abandoned and treated like 
the infantile disease it has always been.

Many postcolonial states have struggled with the challenge of crafting a national 
identity that is civic rather than ethno-cultural. Such states were often left with 
territorial boundaries inherited from their former colonial rulers, particularly in 
Africa, where borders between colonies were based on geopolitical expediency rather 
than cultural and linguistic considerations. The resulting mismatch of political and 
ethnic identities has bred recurrent tensions, as has been seen in Nigeria, Sudan, 
Rwanda and Burundi, for example. Such states have struggled to articulate a new 
national identity that can unify a wide range of ethnic, religious and regional groups 
that are bound together by little more than a shared colonial past.
NATIONALIST POLITCS
Though the drivers of modern nationalism are doubtless as old as society, as a political 
agenda, nationalism really takes shape only in the late eighteenth century, when wars, 
revolutions and popular protest began to redraw the boundaries of Europe around 
nationalities. Scholars have debated why at this point specifically national aspirations 
became so much stronger than they previously had in this period. In Nations and 
Nationalism (1983), Ernest Gellner emphasizes the degree to which nationalism 
is linked to modernization and to the process of industrialization. Gellner stresses 
that, while premodern or ‘agroliterate’ societies were structured by a network of 
feudal bonds and loyalties, emerging industrial societies promoted social mobility, 
self-striving and competition, and so required a new source of cultural cohesion. 
Nationalism therefore developed to meet the needs of particular social conditions 
and circumstances. And because a return to premodern societies and loyalties is now 
unthinkable, nationalism is an inevitable feature of contemporary politics.
However, in The Ethnic Origins of Nations (1986), Anthony Smith challenges the 
idea of a link between nationalism and modernization by highlighting the continuity 
between modern nations and premodern ethnic communities, which he called 
‘ethnies’. In this view, nations are historically embedded: they are rooted in a common 
cultural heritage and language that may long predate the achievement of statehood, 
or even the quest for national independence. Smith nevertheless acknowledges 
that, although ethnicity is the precursor of nationalism, modern nations came into 
existence only when established ‘ethnies’ were linked to the emerging doctrine of 
political sovereignty (see p. 64). This conjunction occurred in Europe in the late 
eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, and in Asia and Africa in the 
twentieth century.
Whatever the catalyst, since emerging onto the political stage, nationalism has 
been one of the most important, and most controversial, political ideas. On the one 
hand, nationalism can appear to be a progressive and liberating force, offering the 
prospect of national unity or independence. On the other, it can be an irrational 
and reactionary creed that allows political leaders to conduct policies of military 
expansion and war in the name of the nation. Indeed, nationalism shows every 
sign of suffering from the political equivalent of multiple-personality syndrome. At 
various times, nationalism has been progressive and reactionary, democratic and 
authoritarian, liberating and oppressive, and left-wing and right-wing.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_6.indd 153 23-07-2024 12:38:28154 POLITICS
The character of nationalism is very much moulded by the circumstances in which 
nationalist aspirations arise, whether cultural or civic criteria are considered 
decisive, and by the political causes to which it is attached. Thus, when nationalism 
is a reaction against the experience of foreign domination or colonial rule, it tends 
to be a liberating force linked to the goals of liberty, justice and democracy. When 
nationalism is a product of social dislocation and demographic change, it often has an 
insular and exclusive character, and can become a vehicle for racism and prejudice. 
Finally, nationalism is shaped by the political ideals of those who espouse it. In their 
different ways, liberals, conservatives, socialists, fascists and even communists have 
been attracted to nationalism. In this sense, nationalism is a cross-cutting ideology. 
Some traditional political manifestations of nationalism are:
 liberal nationalism
 conservative nationalism
 expansionist nationalism
 anti-colonial and postcolonial nationalism.
Liberal nationalism
Liberal nationalism can be seen as the classic form of European liberalism. It 
dates back to the French Revolution and embodies many of its values. Indeed, in 
continental Europe in the mid-nineteenth century, to be a nationalist meant to 
be a liberal, and vice versa. The 1848 Revolutions, for example, fused the struggle 
for national independence and unification with the demand for limited and 
constitutional government – they were forces arrayed against the monarchies and 
nobilities of Europe, who for centuries had created patchworks of territories for 
their own enrichment, with little thought to the communities that were divided 
by them. Nowhere was this more evident than in the ‘Risorgimento’ (rebirth) 
nationalism of the Italian nationalist movement, especially as expressed by the 
‘prophet’ of Italian unification, Giuseppe Mazzini (see p. 155). Since the Middle 
Ages, the Italian peninsula had been fragmented into dozens of small states, led by 
powerful autocratic noble families constantly warring with each other for territory 
and influence. Unification was Mazzini’s rallying call to bring together the Italian 
peoples into a peaceful union, but also to bring the people’s voice to government. 
Similar principles were espoused by Simon Bolívar (1783–1830), who led the Latin 
American independence movement in the early nineteenth century and helped to 
expel the Spanish from Hispanic America. Perhaps the clearest expression of liberal 
nationalism is found in US President Woodrow Wilson’s ‘Fourteen Points’. Drawn up 
in 1918, these were proposed as the basis for the reconstruction of Europe after the 
First World War, and provided a blueprint for the sweeping territorial changes that 
were implemented by the Treaty of Versailles (1919).
The characteristic theme of liberal nationalism is that it links the idea of the nation 
with a belief in popular sovereignty (see p. 246), ultimately derived from Rousseau. This 
fusion was brought about because the multinational empires against which nineteenth￾century European nationalists fought were also autocratic and oppressive. Mazzini, for 
example, wished not only to unite the Italian states, but also to throw off the influence of 
autocratic Austria and the Papal States. The central theme of this form of nationalism is 
CONCEPT
Racialism, racism
The terms racialism 
and racism tend to be 
used interchangeably. 
Racialism refers to any 
belief or doctrine that 
draws political or social 
conclusions from the 
idea that humankind is 
divided into biologically 
distinct races (a notion 
that has no, or little, 
scientific basis). Racialist 
theories are thus based 
on the assumption that 
cultural, intellectual 
and moral differences 
amongst humankind 
derive from supposedly 
more fundamental 
genetic differences. 
In political terms, 
racialism is manifest 
in calls for racial 
segregation (apartheid), 
and in doctrines of 
‘blood’ superiority and 
inferiority (Aryanism 
and anti-Semitism).

therefore a commitment to the principle of national self-determination. Its goal is the 
construction of a nation-state (see p. 165); that is, a state within which the boundaries 
of government coincide as far as possible with those of nationality.
Liberal nationalism is, above all, a principled form of nationalism. It does not uphold 
the interests of one nation against other nations. Instead, it proclaims that every 
nation has a right to freedom and self-determination. In this sense, all nations are 
equal. The ultimate goal of liberal nationalism, then, is the construction of a world 
of sovereign nation-states. Mazzini thus formed the clandestine organization Young 
Italy to promote the idea of a united Italian nation, but he also founded Young Europe 
in the hope of spreading nationalist ideas throughout the continent. Similarly, at 
the Paris Peace Conference that drew up the Treaty of Versailles, Woodrow Wilson 
advanced the principle of self-determination, not simply because the break-up of 
European empires served US national interests, but because he believed that the 
Poles, the Czechs, the Yugoslavs and the Hungarians all had the same right to 
political independence that the Americans already enjoyed.
National self￾determination: The 
principle that the nation 
is a sovereign entity; 
self-determination 
implies both national 
independence and 
democratic rule.
KEY THINKER
GIUSEPPE MAZZINI (1805–72)
Italian nationalist and apostle of liberal republicanism. Mazzini was born in Genoa, Italy, and 
was the son of a doctor. He encountered revolutionary politics as a member of the patriotic 
secret society, the Carbonari. This led to his arrest and exile to France and, after his expulsion 
from there, to Britain. He returned briefly to Italy during the 1848 Revolutions, helping 
to liberate Milan and becoming head of the short-lived Roman Republic. A committed 
republican, Mazzini’s influence thereafter faded as other nationalist leaders, including Garibaldi 
(1807–82), looked to the House of Savoy to bring about Italian unification. Although he never 
officially returned to Italy, Mazzini’s liberal nationalism had a profound influence throughout 
Europe, and on immigrant groups in the USA.

From this perspective, nationalism is not only a means of enlarging political freedom, 
but also a mechanism for securing a peaceful and stable world order. Wilson, for 
instance, believed that the First World War had been a consequence of an ‘old order’ 
that was dominated by autocratic and militaristic empires bent on expansionism and 
war. In his view, democratic nation-states would be essentially peaceful, because, 
possessing both cultural and political unity, they lacked the incentive to wage war or 
subjugate other nations. In this light, nationalism is not seen as a source of distrust, 
suspicion and rivalry. Rather, it is a force capable of promoting unity within each 
nation and brotherhood amongst nations based on mutual respect for national 
rights (Tamir 1995).
There is a sense, nevertheless, in which liberalism looks beyond the nation. This 
occurs for two reasons. The first is that a commitment to individualism (see p. 179)
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_6.indd 155 23-07-2024 12:38:28156 POLITICS
implies that liberals believe that all human beings (regardless of factors such as race, 
creed, social background and nationality) are of equal moral worth. Liberalism 
therefore subscribes to universalism, in that it accepts that individuals everywhere 
have the same status and entitlements. This is commonly expressed nowadays in the 
notion of human rights. In setting the individual above the nation, liberals establish 
a basis for violating national sovereignty, most clearly through humanitarian 
intervention designed to protect the citizens of another country from their own 
government. The second reason is that liberals fear that a world of sovereign nation￾states may degenerate into violence and disorder. Just as unlimited freedom allows 
individuals to abuse and enslave one another, national sovereignty may be used as 
a cloak for expansionism and conquest. Freedom must always be subject to the law, 
and this applies equally to individuals and to nations. Liberals have, as a result, been 
in the forefront of campaigns to establish a system of international law supervised 
by supranational bodies such as the United Nations and the International Court 
of Justice (see Chapter 19). In this view, nationalism and internationalism are not 
rival or mutually exclusive principles; rather, from a liberal perspective, the latter 
complements the former.
Criticisms of liberal nationalism tend to fall into two categories. In the first category, 
liberal nationalists are accused of being naive and romantic. They see the progressive 
and liberating face of nationalism; theirs is a tolerant and rational nationalism. 
However, they perhaps ignore the darker face of nationalism; that is, the irrational 
bonds of tribalism that distinguish ‘us’ from a foreign and threatening ‘them’. Liberals 
see nationalism as a universal principle, but they have less understanding of the 
emotional power of nationalism, which, in time of war, can persuade people to fight, 
kill and die for ‘their’ country, almost regardless of the justice of their nation’s cause. 
Such a stance is expressed in the assertion: ‘my country, right or wrong’.
Second, the goal of liberal nationalism (the construction of a world of nation-states) 
may be fundamentally misguided. The mistake of Wilsonian nationalism, on the 
basis of which large parts of the map of Europe were redrawn after the First World 
War, was that it assumed that nations live in convenient and discrete geographical 
areas, and that states can be constructed to coincide with these areas. In practice, all 
so-called ‘nation-states’ comprise multiple linguistic, religious, ethnic and regional 
groups, some of which may consider themselves to be ‘nations’, and many of which 
live in multicultural co-located communities. A clear case to emerge in the wake 
of the First World War was Hungary, which was given its independence from the 
former Habsburg Empire of Austria-Hungary. The problem, though, was that since 
the Middle Ages ethnic Hungarians had migrated widely throughout the Balkans, 
with large communities living amongst mixed populations of other peoples including 
Romanians, Slovakians and Croatians. With centuries of intermixing, there was no 
contiguous border that could be drawn that would encompass all the Hungarian 
peoples into a new state. The result negotiated in the Treaty of Trianon (1920) was 
a Hungary much smaller than its historical kingdom, with about 30 per cent of 
Hungarians left outside the new borders, including large areas of Transylvania now 
in Romania which had majority Hungarian populations, an outcome that was deeply 
resented in Hungarian politics for decades afterwards.

CONCEPT
Internationalism
Internationalism is 
the theory or practice 
of politics based on 
transnational or global 
cooperation. It is 
rooted in universalist 
assumptions about 
human nature that put 
it at odds with political 
nationalism. The 
major internationalist 
traditions are drawn 
from liberalism and 
socialism. Liberal 
internationalism is 
based on individualism 
reflected in the 
assumption that human 
rights have a ‘higher’ 
status than claims based 
on national sovereignty. 
Socialist internationalism 
is grounded in a belief 
in international class 
solidarity, underpinned 
by assumptions about a 
common humanity.

Conservative nationalism
Historically, conservative nationalism developed rather later than liberal nationalism. 
Until the latter half of the nineteenth century, conservative politicians treated 
nationalism as a subversive, if not revolutionary, creed. As the century progressed, 
however, the link between conservatism and nationalism became increasingly 
apparent; for instance, in Disraeli’s ‘One Nation’ ideal, in Bismarck’s willingness 
to recruit German nationalism to the cause of Prussian aggrandizement, and in 
Tsar Alexander III’s endorsement of pan-Slavic nationalism. In modern politics, 
though, nationalism has become an article of faith for most, if not all, conservatives. 
Particularly when arrayed against what is perceived as an increasingly liberal trend 
towards regional and international integration, and fear that national identities are 
being undermined by unchecked social and demographic change.
Conservative nationalism is concerned less with the principled nationalism 
of universal self-determination, and more with the promise of social cohesion 
and public order embodied in the sentiment of national patriotism. Above all, 
conservatives see the nation as an organic entity emerging out of a basic desire of 
humans to gravitate towards those who have the same views, habits, lifestyles and 
appearance as themselves. In short, human beings seek security and identity through 
membership of a national community. From this perspective, patriotic loyalty and 
a consciousness of nationhood is rooted largely in the idea of a shared past, turning 
nationalism into a defence of values and institutions that have been endorsed by 
history. Nationalism thus becomes a form of traditionalism. This gives conservative 
nationalism a distinctively nostalgic and backward-looking character. In the case of 
British nationalism for instance (or, more accurately, English nationalism), national 
patriotism draws on symbols closely associated with the institution of monarchy. The 
UK national anthem is God Save the King, and the Royal Family play a prominent 
role in national celebrations, such as Armistice Day, and on state occasions, such as 
the opening of Parliament. For conservatives, these are not just idle symbols, but the 
cultural glue that maintains a strong and unified state.
Conservative nationalism tends to develop in established nation-states rather than 
in those that are in the process of nation-building. It is typically inspired by the 
perception that the nation is somehow under threat, either from within or from 
without. One historical ‘enemy within’ has been class antagonism and the ultimate 
danger of social revolution. In this respect, conservatives have seen nationalism as 
the antidote to socialism: when patriotic loyalties are stronger than class solidarity, 
the working class is, effectively, integrated into the nation. Calls for national unity 
and the belief that unabashed patriotism is a civic virtue are, therefore, recurrent 
themes in conservative thought. Another had been the erosion of traditions through 
social change – conservatives are often fond of arguing that social liberality and 
erosion of traditional families, institutions and customs undermine the nation and 
sow disunity and disorder. Many Western nations once held that their Christianity 
was foundational to their identity, yet the rise of atheism and secularism has caused 
some conservatives to cite declining religious unity as the cause of many modern 
social ills and the slow erosion of happy, unified societies.
CONCEPT
Patriotism
Patriotism (from 
the Latin patria, 
meaning ‘fatherland’) 
is a sentiment, 
a psychological 
attachment to one’s 
nation (a ‘love of one’s 
country’). The terms 
‘nationalism’ and 
‘patriotism’ are often 
confused. Nationalism 
has a doctrinal character 
and embodies the 
belief that the nation 
is in some way the 
central principle of 
political organization. 
Patriotism provides the 
affective basis for that 
belief. Patriotism thus 
underpins all forms of 
nationalism; it is difficult 
to conceive of a national 
group demanding, say, 
political independence 
without possessing 
at least a measure of 
patriotic loyalty.

The ‘enemies without’ that threaten national identity, from a conservative 
perspective, include immigration and supranationalism. In this view, immigration 
poses a threat because it tends to weaken an established national culture and 
ethnic identity, thereby provoking hostility and conflict. This fear was expressed 
in the UK in the 1960s by Enoch Powell, who warned that further Commonwealth 
immigration would lead to racial conflict and violence. A similar theme was taken 
up in 1979 by Margaret Thatcher in her reference to the danger of the UK being 
‘swamped’ by immigrants. Anti-immigration campaigns waged by the British 
National Party, Le Pen’s National Rally in France and far-right groups such as the 
Freedom Party in Austria and the Danish People’s Party also draw their inspiration 
from conservative nationalism.
National identity and, with it, our source of security and belonging is perceived 
to be threatened in the same way by the growth of supranational bodies and 
by the globalization of culture. Resistance in the UK and in other EU member 
states to the continued integration of the European Union and a single European 
currency reflects not merely concern about the loss of political and economic 
sovereignty but also a belief that national laws, currencies and customs are vital to 
the maintenance of a distinctive national identity. Euroscepticism has flourished 
in recent decades, as a broader European identity has failed to crystallize, and 
many people struggle to connect with the institution as being relevant and 
representative to them.
Although conservative nationalism has been linked to military adventurism 
and expansion, its distinctive character is that it is inward-looking and insular. 
If conservative governments have used foreign policy as a device to stoke 
up public fervour, this is an act of political opportunism, rather than because 
conservative nationalism is relentlessly aggressive or inherently militaristic. 
This leads to the criticism that conservative nationalism is essentially a form of 
elite manipulation or ruling-class ideology. From this perspective, the ‘nation’ 
is invented, and certainly defined, by political leaders and ruling elites with a 
view to manufacturing consent or engineering political passivity. In crude terms, 
when in trouble, all governments play the ‘nationalism card’. A more serious 
criticism of conservative nationalism, however, is that it promotes intolerance 
and bigotry. Insular nationalism draws on a narrowly cultural concept of the 
nation; that is, the belief that a nation is an exclusive ethnic community, broadly 
similar to an extended family. A very clear line is therefore drawn between those 
who are members of the nation and those who are alien to it. By insisting on 
the maintenance of cultural purity and established traditions, conservatives may 
portray immigrants, or foreigners in general, as a threat, and so promote, or at least 
legitimize, racialism and xenophobia. But though there may be racialist elements 
to it, conservative nationalism is usually cultural rather than explicitly ethnic, 
insofar as those who assimilate and embrace the national culture are generally 
acceptable. Communities who maintain their own languages, customs and 
beliefs, especially those deemed incompatible with the majority culture, are the 
communities conservative nationalism seeks to prevent. Far-right nationalism, 
however, may veer towards a hard-line, ethnic view of the nation.
Euroscepticism:
Opposition to further 
European integration, 
usually not extending 
to the drive to withdraw 
from the EU (anti￾Europeanism).

Expansionist nationalism
The expression of political nationalism has historically had an aggressive, militaristic 
and expansionist character. In many ways, this form of nationalism is the antithesis of 
the principled belief in equal rights and self-determination that is the core of liberal 
nationalism. The aggressive face of nationalism first appeared in the late nineteenth 
century as European powers indulged in ‘the scramble for Africa’ in the name of 
national glory and their ‘place in the sun’. Nineteenth-century European imperialism 
(see p. 480) differed from the colonial expansion of earlier periods in that it was fuelled 
by a climate of popular nationalism in which national prestige was linked to the 
possession of an empire, and each colonial victory was greeted by demonstrations of 
popular enthusiasm, or jingoism. To a large extent, both world wars of the twentieth 
century resulted from this expansionist form of nationalism, in which the public 
was encouraged to believe in a great national destiny which would see their culture, 
politics or way of life as exemplary or superior and its goal was to spread it to others.
Thus expansionist nationalism is often rooted not in popular self-determination or 
even in cultural unity, but rather in a grand mythology of the nation, usually rooted 
in some vague notion of past greatness. Irredentism, a desire to reunite a nation 
with its historical territories, surged dramatically during the twentieth century, as 
new self-determination led large multinational empires to break up. Irredentism is 
often rooted in a distant past that does not reflect modern realities, and a desire to 
compensate for past wrongs. Some Armenian nationalists, for instance, advocate 
for a ‘United Armenia’ which would bring vast areas of Western Turkey into the 
modern Armenian state. Though historically the classical and medieval Armenian 
kingdoms ranged over this territory, centuries of migration and racial intermixing, 
and extensive deportation and ethnic cleansing by the Turkish state, have left most of 
this claimed land devoid of any significant Armenian populations. To reunite these 
territories under the Armenian flag would perhaps avenge historical injustices but 
would also ignore the popular will of those who now live there and turn Armenia 
from a relatively homogeneous cultural nation into state in which Armenians would 
comprise less than a third of the population.
Expansionist forms of nationalism are often associated with chauvinistic beliefs 
and doctrines. Derived from the name of Nicolas Chauvin, a French soldier noted 
for his fanatical devotion to Napoleon and the cause of France, chauvinism is an 
irrational belief in the superiority or dominance of one’s own group or people. 
National chauvinism therefore rejects the idea that all nations are equal in favour 
of the belief that nations have particular characteristics and qualities, and so have 
very different destinies. Some nations are suited to rule; others are suited to be ruled. 
The chauvinist’s own nation is seen to be unique and special, in some way a ‘chosen 
people’. British colonialism was driven not just by a desire for foreign markets and 
strategic territory but also by a belief that the British national character embodied 
modern progressive civilization, and thus it was Britain’s mission to spread itself to 
bring enlightenment to less fortunate peoples. Or so this convenient reasoning went.
No less important in this type of nationalism, however, is the image of another 
nation or race as a threat or enemy. In the face of the enemy, the nation draws 
Jingoism: A mood of 
public enthusiasm and 
celebration provoked 
by military expansion or 
imperial conquest.
Irredentism: A policy of 
advocating the return of 
former territories to a 
nation, usually those with 
strong historical, cultural 
and linguistic ties.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_6.indd 159 23-07-2024 12:38:28160 POLITICS
together and gains an intensified sense of its own identity and importance, achieving 
a kind of ‘negative integration’. Chauvinistic nationalism therefore establishes a clear 
distinction between ‘them’ and ‘us’. There must be a ‘them’ to fear or hate in order 
for a sense of ‘us’ to be forged. The world is thus divided, usually by means of racial 
categories, into an ‘in group’ and an ‘out group’. The ‘out group’ acts as a scapegoat 
for all the misfortunes and frustrations suffered by the ‘in group’. This was most 
graphically demonstrated by the virulent anti-Semitism that was the basis of German 
Nazism. Hitler portrayed history as a Manichean struggle between the Aryans and 
the Jews, respectively representing the forces of light and darkness, or good and 
evil. Though this is an extreme example, chauvinistic nationalism is a recurrent 
feature of politics. Even those nations with principally civic national foundations 
have always had strains of chauvinistic politics. For example, though founded on the 
principles of freedom of religion, anti-Catholic sentiment ran high for much of the 
late nineteenth century in the United States, with various political movements like 
the Know Nothings arguing that Protestantism was integral to the American nation, 
and Catholic culture incompatible with it.
A recurrent theme of expansionist nationalism is the idea of national rebirth or 
regeneration. This form of nationalism commonly draws on myths of past greatness 
or national glory. Mussolini and the Italian Fascists looked back to the days of Imperial 
Rome. In portraying their regime as the ‘Third Reich’, the German Nazis harked 
back both to Bismarck’s ‘Second Reich’ and Charlemagne’s Holy Roman Empire, the 
‘First Reich’. Such myths plainly give expansionist nationalism a backward-looking 
character, but they also look to the future, in that they mark out the nation’s destiny. 
If nationalism is a vehicle for re-establishing greatness and regaining national glory, 
it invariably has a militaristic and expansionist character.
Anti-colonial and postcolonial nationalism
The developing world has spawned various forms of nationalism, all of which have in 
some way drawn inspiration from the struggle against colonial rule. The irony of this 
form of nationalism is that it has turned doctrines and principles first developed through 
the process of nation-building in Europe against the European powers themselves. 
Colonialism, in other words, succeeded in turning nationalism into a political creed of 
global significance. In Africa and Asia, it helped to forge a sense of nationhood shaped 
by the desire for national liberation. Indeed, during the twentieth century, the political 
geography of much of the world was transformed by anti-colonialism. Independence 
movements that sprang up in the interwar period gained new impetus after the 
conclusion of the Second World War. The overstretched empires of Britain, France, the 
Netherlands and Portugal crumbled in the face of rising nationalism.
India had been promised independence during the Second World War, and it was 
eventually granted in 1947. A republic of Indonesia was proclaimed in 1949 after 
a three-year war against the Netherlands. A military uprising forced the French to 
withdraw from Vietnam in 1954, even though final liberation, with the unification 
of North and South Vietnam, was not achieved until 1975, after a further fourteen 
years of war against the USA. Nationalist struggles in Southeast Asia inspired 
similar movements in Africa, with liberation movements emerging under leaders 
such as Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana, Nnamdi Azikiwe in Nigeria, Julius Nyerere in 
Tanganyika (later Tanzania) and Hastings Banda in Nyasaland (later Malawi). The 
CONCEPT
Race
Race refers to physical 
or genetic differences 
amongst humankind 
that supposedly 
distinguish one group 
of people from another 
on biological grounds 
such as skin and hair 
colour, physique and 
facial features. A race is 
thus a group of people 
who share a common 
ancestry and ‘one 
blood’. The term is, 
however, controversial, 
both scientifically and 
politically. Scientific 
evidence suggests 
that there is no such 
thing as ‘race’ in the 
sense of a species-type 
difference between 
peoples. Politically, 
racial categorization is 
commonly based on 
cultural stereotypes, and 
is simplistic at best and 
pernicious at worst.

TAIWAN: WHAT CONSTITUTES A NEW NATION?
Facing imminent defeat in the Chinese Civil War, during 
the final months of 1949 the beleaguered army of the 
Republic of China (ROC) evacuated from the Chinese 
mainland to Taiwan, a large island off the coast. Along with 
them fled millions of Chinese, including many prominent 
intellectuals, officers and bureaucrats, fearing life under 
communist rule. Lacking sufficient naval or air support, the 
communists were not able to pursue ROC forces across 
the seas and so bided its time while it established a new 
revolutionary government on the mainland – the People’s 
Republic of China (PRC).
The ROC’s plan was always to regroup, rebuild and 
reinvade the Chinese mainland. Alarmed at the sudden fall 
of China to communism, the United States sent fleets to 
patrol the Taiwan Straits and vowed to counter any PRC 
invasion attempts. The ROC had survived total defeat, but 
it soon became apparent their remnant forces could never 
hope to build up to a point of reinvading the mainland. 
A long stalemate set in. By the 1970s, most countries 
acknowledged the new reality. US President Richard 
Nixon opened relations with the PRC in 1972, recognizing 
it as the legitimate government of the Chinese people. 
The United Nations and many other states followed suit, 
withdrawing diplomatic recognition for the ROC.
Marginalized, the ROC turned its attention towards survival 
in exile. Following the model of Singapore and South Korea, 
massive state-directed industrialization with foreign capital 
helped transform the island from an agricultural outpost 
to a global exporter. The island boomed, particularly as a 
manufacturer of high-tech and electronic components. 
Increasingly prosperous, the ROC eased marital law and 
began allowing elections in the 1980s.
It was around this time the ROC government slowly 
began to step back from its claims of being the legitimate 
government of China, instead promoting a new identity 
for itself: Taiwanese. Artists, poets, and musicians received 
funding to produce works with new styles and themes, 
and the indigenous cultures and languages of the island 
were promoted. Classroom textbooks began teaching 
Taiwan-centric, rather than China-centric, history. ‘Made 
in Taiwan’ was prominently printed on Taiwanese exports, 
helping to publicize the island around the world. By the 
1990s, a generation that had grown up post-civil war 
began to articulate a new sense of Taiwanese nationalism. 
But such a concept was contentious. Ethnically, both 
mainlanders and Taiwanese are mainly of Han Chinese 
descent. Taiwan speaks Mandarin Chinese, as does the 
mainland. Both Taiwan and the mainland share thousands 
of years of Chinese heritage, songs, traditions, customs 
and religious practices. Their only distinction, at least at 
first, was a dispute over who was the legitimate government 
of China.
But time and separation have started to create meaningful 
differences. Taiwanese Mandarin is an increasingly 
distinctive dialect of Chinese, particularly for words that 
have emerged since the Civil War – the Taiwanese have 
different words for ‘internet’, ‘briefcase’ and ‘software’, for 
instance. Bubble tea, a Taiwanese invention, has become an 
international icon of the island. A grass-roots subculture 
called Tai Ke has become popular with some young 
Taiwanese that involves dressing, speaking and behaving in 
ways considered rude in traditional Chinese culture.
The Democratic Progress Party (DPP), formed in 1986, 
began running for office on a platform of renouncing 
historical claims to China, and promoting a new form of 
civic nationalism for the island, based on democracy, social 
liberalism and progressive values. After winning power for 
the first time in 2000, the DPP began replacing ‘China’ 
with ‘Taiwan’ in names of official bodies, and abolished the 
National Reunification Council, ending the formal goal of 
reunification.

The PRC has responded with the same expansive nationalist 
view it has held since 1949. Known as the One China Policy, 
the PRC’s position is that China is a single, indivisible 
people who should be united within one nation-state, and 
that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. But the PRC’s 
territorial claims are not rooted in cultural or civic nationalism, 
but rather the historical boundaries of the Qing Dynasty. 
Those boundaries include many peoples who explicitly reject 
membership in the Chinese nation, including Uyghurs and 
Tibetans, who have historically enjoyed long periods of 
independence. To combat this, China has used methods like 
resettlement of ethnic Han Chinese to minority areas to 
homogenize the nation culturally and linguistically.
While there is no clear consensus in Taiwan on its 
nationhood, public polling has shown steady rises in support 
amongst the public for independence or separation, while 
only a small minority now desire eventual reunification 
with China. And while only a handful of countries 
recognize Taiwan diplomatically, it has gained de facto 
recognition – Taiwanese passports are accepted documents 
in most countries and Taiwanese athletes compete under a 
different flag at the Olympics and international sporting 
events. The PRC has warned, though, that any attempts 
to make independence official would trigger a military 
intervention. Thus the conflict remains a tense standoff, 
between two competing and incompatible nationalisms.
pace of decolonization in Africa accelerated from the late 1950s onwards. Africa’s last 
remaining colony, South West Africa, finally became independent Namibia in 1990.
Early forms of anti-colonialism drew heavily on ‘classical’ European nationalism 
and were inspired by the idea of national self-determination. However, emergent 
African and Asian nations were in a very different position from the newly created 
European states of the nineteenth century. For African and Asian nations, the quest 
for political independence was inextricably linked to a desire for social development 
and for an end to their subordination to the industrialized states of Europe and the 
USA. The goal of national liberation, therefore, had an economic as well as a political 
dimension. This helps to explain why anti-colonial movements typically looked not 
to liberalism but to socialism, and particularly to Marxism–Leninism, as a vehicle 
for expressing their nationalist ambitions. On the surface, nationalism and socialism 
appear to be incompatible political creeds. Socialists have traditionally preached 
internationalism, since they regard humanity as a single entity, and argue that the 
division of humankind into separate nations breeds only suspicion and hostility.
But the appeal of socialism to the developing world was at least partly based on 
the fact that the values of community and cooperation that socialism embodies 
are deeply established in the cultures of traditional, pre-industrial societies. In 
this sense, nationalism and socialism are linked, insofar as both emphasize social 
solidarity and collective action. By this standard, nationalism may simply be a 
weaker form of socialism, the former applying the ‘social’ principle to the nation, 
the latter extending it to cover the whole of humanity. More specifically, socialism, 
and especially Marxism, provide an analysis of inequality and exploitation through 
which the colonial experience could be understood and colonial rule challenged. 
In the same way as the oppressed and exploited proletariat saw that they could 
achieve liberation through the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism, developing￾world nationalists saw armed struggle as a means of achieving both political and 
economic emancipation, thus fusing the goals of political independence and social 
revolution. In countries such as China, North Korea, Vietnam and Cambodia, anti￾colonial movements openly embraced Marxism–Leninism. On achieving power, 
they moved to seize foreign assets and nationalize economic resources, creating 
Soviet-style planned economies. African and Middle Eastern states developed a 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_6.indd 162 23-07-2024 12:38:28NATIONS AND NATIONALISM 163
less ideological form of nationalistic socialism, which was practised, for example, in 
Algeria, Libya, Zambia, Iraq and South Yemen. The ‘socialism’ proclaimed in these 
countries usually took the form of an appeal to a unifying national cause or interest, 
typically championed by a powerful charismatic leader.
However, nationalists in the developing world have not always been content to 
express their nationalism in a language of socialism or Marxism borrowed from the 
West. For example, Mohandas Gandhi (see p. 164) advanced a political philosophy 
of swaraj that fused Indian nationalism with an ethic of non-violence, self-sacrifice 
and self-development that was ultimately rooted in Hinduism. ‘Home rule’ for India 
was thus a spiritual condition, not merely a political one, a stance underpinned by 
Gandhi’s anti-industrialism, famously embodied in his wearing of homespun clothes 
(Panter-Brick 2014).
In parallel to developing new postcolonial concepts of nation, many of the first wave 
of postcolonial politicians embraced forms of pan-nationalism, arguing that the 
artificial borders created by the colonial powers in Africa and the Middle East needed 
to give way to a genuine expression of nationhood based on broader communities 
united in their struggle to develop and throw off Western domination. Pan￾Africanism flourished in the 1950s and 1960s, as a wave of change swept the African 
continent, and intellectuals began to speak of a single African ‘nation’, forged through 
the shared experience of slavery, oppression and colonialism. The Organization 
of African Unity (OAU), formed in 1963, played a major role in helping to fight 
remaining colonial and white regimes in Africa, though internal philosophical and 
ideological disagreements prevented further integration. Pan-Arabism tried to go 
further, calling for the reunification of the Arab world into a single state melded by 
language, culture and religion, and united in its struggle against the former colonial 
powers. Several attempts at national mergers were made – in 1971, Egypt, Libya and 
Syria all voted overwhelmingly to merge into a single state, the Federation of Arab 
Republics, but final negotiations between the governments broke down. Various 
other pan-Arab projects were attempted, though none proved enduring.
Since the 1970s, Marxism–Leninism and pan-nationalism has largely been 
displaced by forms of religious fundamentalism (see p. 55), particularly, Islamic 
fundamentalism. This has given the developing world a specifically non-Western 
– indeed, an anti-Western, voice. In theory at least, Islam attempts to foster a 
transnational political identity that unites all those who acknowledge the teachings of 
the Prophet Muhammad within an ‘Islamic nation’. However, the Iranian revolution 
of 1979, which brought Ayatollah Khomeini (see p. 213) to power, demonstrated the 
potency of Islamic fundamentalism as a creed of national and spiritual renewal. The 
establishment of an Islamic republic was designed to purge Iran of the corrupting 
influence of Western materialism in general, and of the ‘Great Satan’ (the USA) in 
particular, through a return to the traditional values and principles embodied in the 
Sharia, or divine Islamic law. By no means, however, does Islamic nationalism have a 
unified character. In Sudan and Pakistan, for example, Islamification has essentially 
been used as a tool of statecraft to consolidate the power of ruling elites. But the rise of 
the Islamic State in 2013, which briefly occupied large areas of Syria and Iraq, showed 
the potency of the concept as a counterpoint to traditional national boundaries in the 
Middle East.
Pan-nationalism: A style 
of nationalism dedicated 
to unifying a disparate 
people through either 
expansionism or political 
solidarity (‘pan’ means all 
or every).
CONCEPT
Colonialism
Colonialism is the 
theory or practice of 
establishing control 
over a foreign territory 
and turning it into a 
‘colony’. Colonialism is 
thus a particular form 
of imperialism (see p.
480). Colonialism is 
usually distinguished 
by settlement 
and by economic 
domination. As typically 
practised in Africa 
and Southeast Asia, 
colonial government 
was exercised by a 
settler community from 
a ‘mother country’. 
Though colonialism as 
originally understood 
has largely disappeared, 
many developing nations 
may still find themselves 
in relationships of 
economic and political 
dependence with foreign 
powers, a phenomenon 
termed neocolonialism.

THE FUTURE OF NATIONALISM
A world of nation-states
From the final decades of the twentieth century, it became fashionable to declare that 
the age of nationalism was over. This was not because nationalism had been superseded 
by ‘higher’ cosmopolitan allegiances, but because its task had been completed: the 
world had become a world of nation-states. In effect, the nation had been accepted 
as the sole legitimate unit of political rule. Certainly, since 1789, the world had been 
fundamentally remodelled on nationalist lines. Of the 193 current member states 
of the United Nations, only fifteen existed in 1910. Well into the twentieth century, 
most of the peoples of the world were still colonial subjects of one of the European 
empires. Only three of the current seventy-two states in the Middle East and Africa 
existed before 1910, and no fewer than 108 states have come into being since 1959. 
These changes have been fuelled largely by the quest for national independence, with 
new states invariably assuming the mantle of the nation-state. However, although the 
number of aspiring nations has fallen markedly, independence movements remain 
active in many parts of the world. Examples of this include Catalonia, Scotland, Tibet, 
Quebec, Kurdistan, Western Sahara and the Basques.
KEY THINKER
MOHANDAS KARAMCHAND GANDHI (1869–1948)
Indian spiritual and political leader. Called Mahatma or ‘Great Soul’, Gandhi trained as a lawyer 
in the UK and worked in South Africa, where he organized protests against discrimination. After 
returning to India in 1915, he became the leader of the nationalist movement, campaigning 
tirelessly for independence, finally achieved in 1947. Gandhi’s ethic of non-violent resistance, 
satyagraha, reinforced by his ascetic lifestyle, gave the movement for Indian independence 
enormous moral authority. Derived from Hinduism, Gandhi’s political philosophy was based 
on the assumption that the universe is regulated by the primacy of truth, or satya, and that 
humankind is ‘ultimately one’. Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by a fanatical Hindu, becoming 
a victim of the ferocious Hindu-Muslim violence which followed independence.

History nevertheless seems to be on the side of the nation-state. The three 
major geopolitical upheavals of the twentieth century (the First World War, the 
Second World War and the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe) each 
gave considerable impetus to the concept of the nation as a principle of political 
organization. Since 1991, at least twenty-two new states have come into existence in 
Europe alone (fifteen of them because of the disintegration of the USSR), and all of 
them have claimed to be nation-states. The great strength of the nation-state is that 
it offers the prospect of both cultural cohesion and political unity. When a people 
who share a common cultural or ethnic identity gain the right to self-government, 
community and citizenship coincide. This is why nationalists believe that the forces 
that have created a world of independent nation-states are natural and irresistible, 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_6.indd 164 23-07-2024 12:38:28NATIONS AND NATIONALISM 165
and that the nation-state is ultimately the only viable political unit. This view implies 
that supranational bodies such as the European Union will never be able to rival 
the capacity of national governments to establish legitimacy and command popular 
allegiance. Clear limits should therefore be placed on the process of European 
integration because people with different languages, cultures and histories will never 
come to think of themselves as members of a united political community.
Beyond nationalism?
Nevertheless, just as the principle of the nation-state has achieved its widest support, 
other very powerful forces have emerged that threaten to make the nation-state 
redundant. A combination of internal pressures and external threats has produced 
what is commonly referred to as a ‘crisis of the nation-state’. Internally, nation-states 
have been subject to centrifugal pressures, generated by an upsurge in ethnic, regional 
and multicultural politics. This heightened concern with ethnicity and culture may, 
indeed, reflect the fact that, in a context of economic and cultural globalization (see 
pp. 182–183), nations are no longer able to provide a meaningful collective identity or 
sense of social belonging. Given that all nation-states embody a measure of cultural 
diversity, the politics of ethnic assertiveness cannot but present a challenge to the 
principle of the nation, leading some to suggest that nationalism is in the process 
of being replaced by multiculturalism (see p. 205). Unlike nations, ethnic, regional 
or cultural groups are not viable political entities in their own right and have thus 
sometimes looked to forms of federalism (see p. 430) to provide an alternative to 
civic nationalism. For example, within the framework provided by the European 
Union, the Belgian regions of Flanders and Wallonia have achieved such a degree of 
self-government that Belgium remains a nation-state only in a strictly formal sense. 
The nature of such centrifugal forces is discussed more fully in Chapter 17.
External threats to the nation-state have a variety of forms. First, advances in the 
technology of warfare, and especially the advent of the nuclear age, brought about 
demands that world peace be policed by intergovernmental or supranational bodies. 
This led to the creation of the League of Nations and, later, the United Nations, 
all designed to check the expansionist and singular visions of nationalism and 
maintain an inclusive global order. Second, economic life has been progressively 
globalized. Markets are now world markets, businesses have increasingly become 
transnational corporations (see p. 183) and capital is moved around the globe 
in the blink of an eye. Is there a future for the nation-state in a world in which 
no national government can control its economic destiny? And is globalization 
and multiculturalism diluting the social and linguistic distinctiveness that have 
traditionally formed the bedrock of nationalism? Thirdly, is the nation-state still 
equipped to handle the big challenges of the twenty-first century? Climate change, 
global recession, pollution, nuclear proliferation, the war on terror, Covid-19, sea 
rise, natural disasters, the international supply chain problem, drug-trafficking, 
cybercrime – these are all huge international issues which no single nation-state 
can solve, and, indeed, the difficulty of getting consensus between so many nations 
lies at the core of why tackling the problems in a unified way is so difficult. Has the 
nation-state outlived its usefulness as the organizational principle of global society, 
or is it just as important as ever?
CONCEPT
Nation-state
The nation-state is 
a form of political 
organization and a 
political ideal. In the 
first case, it is an 
autonomous political 
community bound 
together by the 
overlapping bonds 
of citizenship and 
nationality. In the 
latter, it is a principle, 
or ideal type, reflected 
in Mazzini’s goal: ‘every 
nation a state, only 
one state for the entire 
nation’. As such, the 
nation-state principle 
embodies the belief 
that nations are ‘natural’ 
political communities. 
For liberals and most 
socialists, the nation￾state is largely fashioned 
out of civic loyalties 
and allegiances. For 
conservatives and 
integral nationalists, it 
is based on ethnic or 
organic unity.

PREVIEW
At almost every level, politics is intertwined with economics. Politics affects economic outcomes in a variety of 
ways, ranging from the ability of the state to ensure a framework of public order in which property rights are 
protected and contracts are upheld, to the capacity of government to regulate the economy, or even exert direct 
control over economic life through planning and nationalization.
No less important are the ways in which economics affects political outcomes. Political parties, for instance, 
compete for power by promising to increase economic growth, reduce inflation, tackle poverty and so on. As 
President Clinton recognized, nothing has as much impact on the lives of people, and thus influences their vote, as 
the state of the economy. Governments win elections when the economy booms and unemployment is low but are 
likely to struggle amidst recessions or rising prices. Indeed, orthodox Marxists go further and suggest that politics 
is merely a part of a ‘superstructure’ determined or conditioned by the economic ‘base’, the political process being 
nothing more than a reflection of the class system. Although few people (including Marxists) now hold such a 
simplistic view, no one would deny that political life is intimately bound up with economic conditions and, most 
importantly, the nature of the economic system. The advent of globalization nevertheless threatens to overturn all 
conventional assumptions about the relationship between politics and economics, marking, some argue, the point 
at which economics finally triumphed over politics. When governments almost everywhere seem to be powerless 
in the face of the pressures exerted by global markets and intensifying international competitiveness, what role is 
left for politics?

CONCEPT
Nation
Nations are complex 
phenomena that are 
shaped by a collection 
of factors. Culturally, 
a nation is a group of 
people bound together 
by a common language, 
religion, history and 
traditions, although 
nations exhibit various 
levels of cultural 
heterogeneity. Politically, 
a nation is a group of 
people who regard 
themselves as a natural 
political community, 
classically expressed 
through the quest for 
sovereign statehood. 
Psychologically, a nation 
is a group of people 
distinguished by a shared 
loyalty or affection in the 
form of patriotism (see 
p. 157).
POLITICAL ECONOMY
Approaches to political economy
The term ‘political economy’ implies that the disciplinary separation of ‘politics’ from 
‘economics’ is ultimately unsustainable. Political factors are crucial in determining 
economic outcomes, and economic factors are crucial in determining political 
outcomes. In short, there is no escaping political economy. And this notion has an 
illustrious pedigree. From Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776) and David Ricardo’s 
Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817) to Karl Marx’s Economic and 
Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 (1932) and J. S. Mill’s Principles of Political Economy 
(1848), these seminal texts in what would now be called economics were considered 
works of ‘political economy’ in their time.
In what ways are politics and economics intertwined? The problem with this 
question is that they spawn many and various responses, suggesting that political 
economy encompasses a variety of perspectives and approaches. For example, 
political economy may focus primarily on the responsibilities of the state with regard 
to the economy. In this sense, it considers issues such as the implications of state 
intervention for growth and prosperity, and the respective strengths of the state 
and the market as a means of distributing wealth. Alternatively, political economy 
may focus on the ways in which economic factors affect political decision-making 
(Lindblom 1980). In this sense, it is concerned with issues such as the political 
influence of business groups, and the extent to which global markets serve as a 
constraint on national governments.
At a deeper level, however, political economy encompasses a range of competing 
traditions. The most important of these are the following:
 state-centric political economy
 classical/neoclassical political economy
 Marxist political economy.
State-centric political economy
State-centric political economy developed out of mercantilism, sometimes called 
‘economic nationalism’, which was most influential in Europe from the fifteenth 
century to the late seventeenth century. In this view, economic markets are not 
‘natural’, but exist within a social context that is largely shaped by the exercise of state 
power. The classic mercantilist strategy was to build up a state’s wealth, power and 
prestige by developing a favourable trading balance through producing goods for 
export while keeping imports low. The chief device for doing this was protectionism. 
Defensive mercantilism was designed to protect ‘infant’ industries and weaker 
economies from ‘unfair’ competition from stronger economies, while aggressive 
mercantilism aimed to strengthen the national economy in order to provide the basis 
for expansionism and war. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, an 
expansion of this concept was autarky, in which a state-managed economy would 
strive to produce everything it needed and free itself from reliance upon foreign 
trade. Both communism and fascism were attracted to the concept of autarky, 
as it reinforced political ideals of independence and self-sufficiency. However,

restrictions such as quotas 
and tariffs, designed 
to protect domestic 
producers from foreign 
competition.

system that is self￾sufficient and produces 
everything it needs.

mercantilism, protectionism and autarky have all declined in significance since the 
1930s, as such policies were deemed to have been a contributing factor to the Great 
Depression and the Second World War, and the experience of subsequent decades 
has consistently shown that trade, rather than isolation, is a more viable strategy for 
economic growth.
However, state-centric political economy is far from dead, and has been periodically 
revived in other forms, most notably state capitalism, discussed later in the chapter. 
Moreover, autarky and protectionism remain popular concepts amongst certain 
political movements, particularly nationalists.
Classical and neoclassical political economy
Classical political economy derives from the writings of Adam Smith (see p. 170) and 
David Ricardo (1772–1823). It is based squarely on liberal assumptions about human 
nature; notably, the idea that individuals, as rationally self-interested creatures, are 
the key economic actors. And as self-interested creatures, we should expect their 
behaviour to be driven by utility maximization – they will act so that they achieve 
the greatest pleasure over pain, calculated in terms of material consumption. In line 
with the deeper liberal belief in balance or harmony amongst competing forces, the 
key idea of classical political economy is that an unregulated market economy tends 
towards long-run equilibrium – everyone acting in their own self-interest leads to 
healthy competition that ultimately benefits everyone. Smith famously used the 
metaphor of an ‘invisible hand’ to describe the fact that in market economies, even 
in the absence of central direction, products and services that people want will be 
produced in great supply at reasonable prices that people can afford. This idea is 
expressed in Smith’s famous words: ‘it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the 
brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own 
interest’.
From the perspective of classical political economy, this implies a policy of laissez￾faire (see p. 175), in which the state leaves the economy alone and the market is 
left to manage itself. Economic exchange via the market is therefore a positive-sum 
game, in that greater efficiency produces economic growth and benefits everyone. 
Neoclassical political economy developed from the late nineteenth century onwards, 
drawing classical ideas and assumptions into more developed theories, in particular 
about the behaviour of firms and the optimal use of scarce resources in conditions 
of perfect competition.
The connections between classical economic thought and the political ideology of 
liberalism are readily apparent, and the two have profoundly influenced each other. 
Liberalism, which seeks to maximize individual liberty and freedom, is argued not 
just as a moral and political imperative, but an economic one, too – the public is 
happier and wealthier when able to prioritize its own interests, relatively free of state 
interference.
However, classic economic thinkers did not argue there was no role for the state, and 
much like liberal political thinkers, classical economists noted that certain conditions 
were needed to guarantee a free and undistorted market and a happy society. Smith, 
Perfect competition:
A hypothetical market 
structure in which 
markets are free and 
open, consumers have 
perfect knowledge, and no 
producer is large enough 
to affect the price of 
goods.

and economics. 
As a topic, political 
economy focuses on the 
relationship between 
states and markets. 
Although political 
economy, in this sense, 
encompasses a variety 
of approaches, the term 
has a long association 
with Marxism, reflecting 
the tendency within 
Marxist analysis to link 
power to the ownership 
of wealth. As a method, 
political economy 
refers to the use of 
theories and approaches 
developed within 
economics to analyse 
politics, and includes 
rational-choice, public￾choice, social-choice 
and games theories (see 
pp. 15–17).

for instance, noted that property rights and enforceable contracts, both essential to 
modern commerce, require a system of laws that will be enforced by the state, and 
that fair competition requires state action to prevent unfair cartels and monopolies 
from forming. He even argued a public education system was essential to creating a 
workforce that understood its economic and political rights, and so there could be 
mobility between the classes in society.
The debate amongst liberal economic and political thinkers, then, much as it is 
in all areas of political economy, is where the line lies between state intervention 
that is necessary and proper, and state intervention that is meddlesome and 
counterproductive.
Marxist political economy
Marxist political economy portrays capitalism as a system of class exploitation 
and treats social classes as the key economic actors. Karl Marx (see p. 43) defined 
class in terms of economic power; specifically, where people stand in relation to 
the ownership of productive wealth, or the ‘means of production’. He believed that 
capitalist society was increasingly divided into ‘two great classes’, the bourgeoisie (the 
capitalist class, the owners of productive wealth) and the proletariat (non-owners, 
who subsist through selling their labour). Crucially, for Marx and later Marxists, the 
relationship between these classes is one of irreconcilable antagonism, the proletariat 
being necessarily and systematically exploited by the bourgeoisie, the ‘ruling class’. 
This Marx explained by reference to the idea of surplus value. Capitalism’s quest for 
profit can only be satisfied through the extraction of surplus value from its workers, by 
paying them less than the value their labour generates. Economic exploitation is thus 
an essential feature of the capitalist mode of production, and it operates regardless of 
the meanness or generosity of particular employers. This irreconcilable class conflict 
invests capitalism with an inherent and, ultimately, fatal instability. As capitalism 
experiences deepening crises of overproduction, the proletariat will eventually be 
brought to class consciousness and will realize its destiny as the ‘gravedigger of 
capitalism’.
CONCEPT
Laissez-faire
Laissez-faire (in French, 
meaning literally ‘leave 
to do’) is the principle 
of non-intervention 
of government in 
economic affairs. It is 
the heart of the doctrine 
that the economy works 
best when left alone 
by government. The 
central assumption of 
laissez-faire is that an 
unregulated market 
economy tends naturally 
towards equilibrium. This 
is usually explained by 
the theory of ‘perfect 
competition’. From this 
perspective, government 
intervention is seen as 
damaging unless it is 
restricted to actions 
that promote market 
competition, such as 
checks on monopolies 
and the maintenance of 
stable prices.
KEY THINKER
ADAM SMITH (1723–90)
Scottish economist and philosopher. After holding the chair of logic and then moral philosophy 
at Glasgow University, Smith became tutor to the Duke of Buccleuch, which enabled him to 
visit France and Geneva, and to develop his economic theories. The Theory of Moral Sentiments
(1759) developed a theory of motivation that tried to reconcile human self-interestedness 
with an unregulated social order. Smith’s most famous work, The Wealth of Nations (1776), 
was the first systematic attempt to explain the workings of the economy in market terms, 
emphasizing the importance of the division of labour. Though he is often seen as a free-market 
theorist, Smith was nevertheless also aware of the limitations of the market.

Marxism is both an economic and a political body of thought, and Marxists see 
no real separation between these two domains of society. Yet while Marxism as a 
political movement has declined significantly in importance and popularity, aspects 
of Marxist political economy have strongly influenced left-wing politics, and the 
ideal that the state should intervene not just to create a level playing field in the 
market, but to help end the exploitation of economic underclasses, is still a powerful 
one in modern politics.
That debate rests firstly on whether the market works in the way it is argued by 
classical and neoclassical economies. Marxist and left-wing critics have questioned 
the ‘invisible hand’ concept, noting that in many market economies, economic 
power is highly distorted, powerful economic interests may collude rather than 
compete, and consumers and employees are often not in equilibrium with producers 
and employers.
VARIETIES OF CAPITALISM
In its broadest form, political economy examines how different economic systems
affect institutional and political arrangements and vice versa. Traditionally, this has 
involved the analysis of the nature and implications of two rival economic systems: 
capitalism and socialism. Either economic life was based on private ownership and 
organized by the market, as in the capitalist ‘first world’ (see p. 122–123), or it was 
based on state ownership and organized through a system of central planning, as in 
the communist ‘second world’. In practice, however, economic systems have always 
been more complex and difficult to categorize than this simplistic capitalism versus 
socialism model of economic organization implied.
No capitalist system is entirely free of ‘socialist aspects’, such as labour laws and 
safety net level of welfare. Nor has there been a socialist system that did not feature 
‘capitalist’ aspects or market mechanisms, or private ownership of at least some 
wealth.
Nevertheless, the abrupt abandonment of central planning following the Eastern 
European revolutions of 1989–91, and the introduction of market reforms in China, 
Vietnam and other surviving communist states, has radically altered the landscape of 
political economy, appearing to leave capitalism, as Francis Fukuyama argued, the only 
viable basis for economic organization across the world (see p. 124). This, however, has 
heightened the awareness that capitalism does not constitute just a single economic 
form but, rather, a variety of economic forms (Brown 1995; Hall and Soskice 2001).
But even if there is broad agreement that some of market-oriented capitalism is the 
most viable foundation for a prosperous economy, there are still major disagreements 
over the degree to which the market should be allowed to run free. Determining 
the boundaries of the market economy is as much a political question as it is an 
economic one.
Health care, for instance, is usually expensive, regardless of who pays for it or 
how, given the expense of modern medical technology and pharmaceuticals, and 
the cost of training and supporting highly skilled doctors and nurses. In a purely

of organization through 
which goods and services 
are produced, distributed 
and exchanged; seen by 
Marxists as a ‘mode of 
production’.

term denoting the value 
that is extracted from the 
labour of the proletariat 
through the mechanism of 
capitalist exploitation.

market economy, health care, especially for complex or chronic conditions, can be 
prohibitively expensive for lower income families. In the late nineteenth and early 
twentieth century, the public in many Western nations increasingly came to view 
health care as a right, rather than a privilege, and as such, political pressures increased 
for the state to intervene to lower the cost of health care. In some countries, this 
resulted in health care being removed entirely from the market and replaced with 
government-run health systems. In other countries, the state intervened in the health 
care market, providing subsidies, tax incentives, price controls and regulations to 
improve access to health care for those with limited incomes.
Health care is one of many areas of society where political and economic imperatives 
will clash, and governments face a delicate balancing act between competing 
interests. Though every country is unique in how they strike that balance, there are 
three broad strains of capitalism in the modern world that provide a philosophical 
foundation for economic policy and help explain why some countries differ so 
significantly in this respect:
 enterprise capitalism
 social capitalism
 state capitalism.
Enterprise capitalism
Enterprise capitalism (sometimes called ‘liberal capitalism’) is widely seen, 
particularly in the Anglo-American world, as ‘pure’ capitalism; that is, as an ideal 
towards which other capitalisms are inevitably drawn (Friedman 1962). Enterprise 
capitalism is based on the ideas of classical economists such as Smith and Ricardo, 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_7.indd 172 23-07-2024 17:40:30POLITICAL ECONOMY AND GLOBALIZATION 173
updated by modern theorists such as Milton Friedman (see p. 179) and Friedrich von 
Hayek (see p. 36). Its central feature is faith in the untrammelled workings of market 
competition, born out of the belief that the market is a self-regulating mechanism, 
in line with the principle of laissez-faire. In the USA, such free-market principles 
have helped to keep public ownership to a minimum and ensure that welfare 
provisions operate as little more than a safety net. American businesses are typically 
profit-driven, and a premium is placed on high productivity and labour flexibility. 
Labour unions, though not absent, have traditionally been weaker compared with 
European counterparts, reflecting the fear that strong labour organizations are an 
obstacle to profit maximization. The emphasis on growth and enterprise of this form 
of capitalism stems, in part, from the fact that productive wealth is owned largely by 
financial institutions such as insurance companies and pension funds that demand a 
high rate of return on their investments.
The undoubted economic power of the USA bears testament to the vigour of 
enterprise capitalism. The USA clearly enjoys natural advantages that enable it to 
benefit from the application of market principles, notably a continent-wide domestic 
market, a wealth of natural resources and a ruggedly individualist popular culture. 
However, its success cannot be put down to the market alone. For instance, the 
USA possesses, in the main, a strong and clear sense of national purpose, and has 
a network of regulatory bodies that constrain the worst excesses of competitive 
behaviour. The principles of enterprise capitalism have nevertheless become more 
prominent internationally and particularly in the Western world since the 1980s, a 
shift brought about by the adoption of neoliberal economic policies by the Reagan 
administration in the USA and the Thatcher government in the UK. The linkage 
between economic globalization and neoliberalism (see p. 182) has also ensured 
that the tendency towards enterprise capitalism has extended far beyond its Anglo￾American heartland.
Enterprise capitalism also has serious disadvantages. Perhaps the most significant 
of these is a tendency towards material inequalities and social fragmentation. For 
instance, the USA has significantly higher rates of poverty, particularly amongst the 
elderly, compared to many European nations. The USA also has one of the highest 
rates of income inequality amongst the developed world (OECD 2023). The tensions 
that such problems generate may be contained by growth levels that keep alive 
the prospect of economic and social mobility. A further problem is that the rapid 
economic growth experienced by many nations in the 1980s and 1990s, allegedly the 
result of neoliberal policies, may have less to do with the dynamism of unrestrained 
enterprise capitalism than with an unsustainable boom in the housing and financial 
markets, and the growth of public and private debt. This economic model may 
therefore be particularly vulnerable to the vagaries of financial markets and to shifts 
in consumer or business confidence, as perhaps demonstrated by the 2007–9 global 
financial crisis and the recession and inflation crises triggered in the aftermath of 
Covid-19 in 2020.
At the same time, however, enterprise capitalist countries like the USA are 
some of the wealthiest countries in the world on a per capita basis, with general 
levels of affluence far exceeding the average of most nations. And while levels of 
CONCEPT
Capitalism
Capitalism can be 
viewed as either an 
economic system 
or as an ideology. 
As an economic 
system, capitalism is a 
system of generalized 
commodity production. 
Its key features are: (1) 
productive wealth is 
predominantly privately 
owned; (2) economic 
life is organized 
according to market 
principles, resources 
being allocated through 
the price mechanism; 
(3) wage labour replaces 
bonded serfdom; and 
(4) material self-interest 
and profit maximization 
provide the motivation 
for enterprise and hard 
work. As an ideology, 
capitalism overlaps 
substantially with 
classical liberalism, both 
creeds defending private 
property, personal self￾striving and meritocracy.

income inequality and poverty in the USA may be higher than notable European 
counterparts, those levels are still far lower than most countries, particularly in the 
developing world. As a popular refrain among proponents of free markets goes: ‘a 
rising tide lifts all boats’.
Social capitalism
Social capitalism refers to the form of capitalism that has developed in much of 
central and Western Europe. Germany is historically the most associated with its 
development, but the principles of social capitalism have been adopted in various 
forms in Austria, Benelux, Sweden, France and much of Scandinavia. This economic 
form has drawn more heavily on the flexible and pragmatic ideas of economists such 
as Friedrich List (1789–1846) than on the strict market principles of classical political 
economy as formulated by Smith and Ricardo. List emphasized the importance of 
government policy in shaping the growth and competitiveness of an economy, arguing, 
for instance, that state intervention should be used to protect infant industries from 
the rigours of foreign competition until they can grow and compete on the open 
market. He also proposed the state should guide the development of infrastructure 
like railways to not only connect markets, but also allow the freer movement of 
people around an economy. Otto von Bismarck (1815–98), chancellor of Germany 
for nearly two decades, introduced some of the first social insurance schemes in 
the world, including disability and accident insurance, and old-age pensions. These 
programmes were overseen by the state but jointly funded by contributions by 
workers and employers. These were early attempts to marry the disciplines of market 
competition with the need for social cohesion and solidarity.
Germany’s modern social-market system is founded on a link between industrial and 
financial capital in the form of a close relationship between business corporations and 
regionally based banks, which are often also major shareholders in the corporations. 
This has been the pivot around which Germany’s economy has revolved since the 
Second World War, and it has orientated the economy towards long-term investment, 
rather than short-term profitability. Business organization in what has been called 
‘Rhine’ capitalism also differs from Anglo-American capitalism, in that it is based 
on social partnership. Trade unions enjoy representation through works councils 
and participate in annual rounds of wage negotiation that are usually industry￾wide. This relationship is underpinned by comprehensive and well-funded welfare 
provisions that provide workers and other vulnerable groups with social guarantees. 
In this way, a form of ‘stakeholder capitalism’ has developed that takes into account 
the interests of workers and those of the wider community. This contrasts with the 
‘shareholder capitalism’ found in the USA and the UK (Hutton 1995). The strengths 
of social capitalism were clearly demonstrated by the Wirtschaftswunder (‘economic 
miracle’) that transformed war-torn West Germany into Europe’s leading economic 
power by the 1960s. High and stable levels of capital investment, together with a 
strong emphasis on education and training, particularly in vocational and craft 
skills, enabled Germany to achieve the highest productivity levels in Europe.
However, the virtues of the social-market model are by no means universally accepted. 
One of its drawbacks is that, because it places such a heavy stress on consultation, 
negotiation and consensus, it tends to encourage inflexibility and make it difficult 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_7.indd 174 23-07-2024 17:40:30POLITICAL ECONOMY AND GLOBALIZATION 175
for businesses to adapt to changing market conditions. Further strain is imposed by 
the relatively high levels of social expenditure required to maintain a high-quality 
welfare provision. These push up taxes, and so burden both employers and employees. 
Whereas the supporters of the social market insist that social outcomes and the 
market are intrinsically linked, its critics argue that social capitalism is nothing more 
than a contradiction in terms. In their view, the price of financing ever-expanding 
social programmes is a decline in international competitiveness and a weakening of 
the wealth-creating base of the economy. In the twenty-first century, many European 
nations face sluggish economic growth, rising welfare costs, large budget deficits and 
growing national debt. Yet the expectations of the public in a social-market economy 
may be hard to lower. In 2023, French President Emmanuel Macron passed a law, 
without parliamentary approval, to raise the national retirement age from sixty-two 
to sixty-four. Regarded a betrayal of long-held social traditions and the work-life 
balance in France, Macron’s government faced nationwide strikes and protests in the 
aftermath. But the rationale is clear – the cost of France’s pension system is rising 
dramatically, particularly as life expectancy increases and the population ages. Yet 
economic growth remains low in France, and tax revenues are not keeping pace. 
Reform of some sort is needed to secure the sustainability of the system, yet few 
options are palatable.
State capitalism
In its modern usage, the term ‘state capitalism’ refers to capitalist economies in which 
the state plays a crucial directive role. These are often non-liberal capitalist societies. 
Hall and Soskice (2001) distinguished between ‘liberal market economies’, in which 
firms coordinate their activities on the basis of competitive market arrangements, and 
‘coordinated market economies’, which depend heavily on non-market arrangements. 
This was the model that the East and Southeast Asian ‘tigers’ (Japan, Hong Kong, 
South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore) eagerly adopted, and it has influenced emergent 
Chinese capitalism as well.
The distinctive character of state capitalism is its emphasis on cooperative, long￾term relationships. This allows the economy to be directed not by an impersonal 
price mechanism, but through what have been called ‘relational markets’. An 
example of this is the pattern of interlocking share ownership that ensures that there 
is a close relationship between industry and finance in Japan, enabling Japanese 
firms to adopt strategies based on long-term investment, rather than on short￾or medium-term profit. Firms themselves provide the social core of life in state 
capitalism. Workers (particularly male workers in large businesses) are ‘members’ 
of firms in a way that does not occur in the USA, or even in social-market Europe. 
In return for their loyalty, commitment and hard work, workers have traditionally 
expected lifetime employment, pensions, social protection and access to leisure and 
recreational opportunities. Particular stress is placed on teamwork and the building 
up of a collective identity which has been underpinned by relatively narrow income 
differentials between managers and workers. The final element in this economic mix 
is the government. Although East Asian levels of public spending and taxation are 
relatively low by international standards (often below 30 per cent of GDP) the state 
has played a vital role in ‘guiding’ investment, research and trading decisions.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_7.indd 175 23-07-2024 17:40:30176 POLITICS
The classic model here was undoubtedly the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI), which oversaw the Japanese ‘economic miracle’ in the post-1945 
period. Although the Japanese version of state capitalism was highly successful in 
the early post-1945 period, accounting for Japan’s ability to recover from wartime 
devastation to become the world’s second largest economy (Johnson 1982), Japan’s 
economic slowdown in the 1990s (sometimes called the ‘lost decade’) and the 1997 
Asian financial crisis cast a darker cloud over state capitalism. Its critics highlighted, 
amongst other things, its inflexibility and unresponsiveness to changing global market 
conditions, and the tendency for individualism and entrepreneurialism to be stifled 
by a continuing emphasis on values such as duty and hierarchy. In this context, China 
has become the standard-bearer for state capitalism, having consistently achieved 
growth rates of about 10 per cent for much of the period since the late 1980s, and 
having overtaken Japan to become the second largest economy in the world in 2011. 
China’s mixture of burgeoning capitalism and Stalinist political control has been 
remarkably effective in delivering sustained economic growth, benefiting from a 
huge supply of cheap labour and massive investment in the economic infrastructure. 
That said, below-expected growth and a crisis in China’s property sector since 2020 
have begun to raise doubts as to whether ‘market Stalinism’ will continue to remain 
a viable economic model as the twenty-first century progresses.
The major weakness of state capitalism is the contradiction between economic 
liberalism and non-liberal political arrangements, as authoritarianism (see p. 139) may 
either become a fetter on enterprise and innovation, or it may generate resentment and 
demands for political freedom that make such systems unsustainable. State capitalism 
will only constitute a viable alternative to Western-based capitalist models if it is possible 
for market economics to prosper in the long-term in the absence of political liberalism.
CONCEPT
Social market
A social market is 
an economy that is 
structured by market 
principles and largely 
free from government 
interference, 
operating in a society 
in which cohesion is 
maintained through a 
comprehensive welfare 
system and effective 
public services. The 
market is thus not an 
end in itself so much as 
a means of generating 
wealth in order to 
achieve broader social 
ends. A stress on 
partnership, cooperation 
and subsidiarity 
distinguishes a social 
market from a free 
market.

Yet transitioning away from state capitalism a fraught process, and Russia provides a 
particularly interesting case. The Russian conversion to a market economy occurred 
in the aftermath of the chaotic dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, when 
‘shock treatment’ market reforms were introduced under Boris Yeltsin. This include 
the rapid privatization of what had been previously state-owned enterprises (SOEs), 
some of them enormous in scale. The transition was haphazard, and many of the 
most valuable assets of the Soviet Union ended up in the hands of a small number 
of individuals who became extremely wealthy in the aftermath, a group known 
as the oligarchs. From 1999 onwards, Vladimir Putin has acted to reassert state 
power in both political and economic life. Some oligarchs were marginalized and 
prosecuted, while others were co-opted and given prominent positions in the Putin 
administration. Critics have called this manifestation crony capitalism, insofar as 
a nominally free enterprise system is in fact highly distorted by collusion between 
government and business.
A key aspect of Putin’s economic strategy has been to exploit Russia’s vast energy 
reserves, both as a motor for economic growth and to give Russia greater leverage 
over neighbouring states – and, indeed, over much of Europe. The chief weakness of 
Russian state capitalism, however, is its failure sufficiently to diversify the economy, 
meaning that Russia’s economic prospects are closely linked to the price of oil and 
natural gas as determined by global markets. This vulnerability was laid bare after 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, as boycotts on Russia by the European 
Union have caused a dramatic decline in Russian revenues.
Managed or unmanaged capitalism?
As this review of the world’s capitalisms makes clear, what is really at stake in 
many debates over political economy is the proper balance between politics and 
economics, and thus between the state and the market. As we have seen in the case 
of a social-market economy, there may be political and philosophical aspects to the 
answer to that question. But an important and related question regards whether a 
capitalist economy works best when it is left alone by government, or whether more 
stable growth and general prosperity can be achieved through more direct economic 
management? How much government intervention in the economy is helpful, and 
how much is harmful?
In the past century, this question has boiled down to an evaluation of two rival 
economic strategies: Keynesianism and neoliberalism. The centrepiece of Keynes’ 
challenge to classical political economy, advanced in The General Theory of 
Employment, Interest and Money (1936), was the rejection of the idea of a natural 
economic order based on a self-regulating market. He argued that laissez-faire
policies that established a strict distinction between government and the economy 
had merely resulted in instability and unemployment, most clearly demonstrated by 
the Great Depression of the 1930s.
In Keynes’ view, capitalist economies had spiralled downwards into deepening 
depression during the 1930s because, as unemployment grew, market forces brought 
about cuts in wages that further reduced the demand for goods and services. Keynes 
argued against free-market orthodoxy by stating that the level of economic activity 
Crony capitalism: A form

state and business, leading 
to limited competition and 
economic freedom.
Keynesianism: A theory 
(developed by J. M. 
Keynes) or policy of 
economic management, 
associated with regulating 
aggregate demand to 
achieve full employment.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_7.indd 177 23-07-2024 17:40:32178 POLITICS
is geared to ‘aggregate demand’; that is, the total level of demand in the economy, 
which government has the capacity to manage through its taxation and spending 
policies. When unemployment rises, government should ‘reflate’ the economy 
either by increasing public spending or by cutting taxes. The resulting budget 
deficit, Keynes suggested, would be sustainable because the growth thus brought 
about would boost tax revenues and reduce the need for government borrowing.
The advent of Keynesian demand management in the early post-Second World War 
period revolutionized economic policy and appeared to provide governments with 
a reliable means of delivering sustained growth and ever-widening prosperity. For 
many, Keynesianism was the key to the ‘long boom’ of the 1950s and 1960s, the most 
sustained period of economic growth the world has ever seen. Keynesianism proved 
so successful in this period that it was largely beyond question politically, even in 
the United States, the nominal home of free-market capitalism. The intellectual 
credibility of Keynesianism, however, was damaged by the emergence in the 1970s 
of ‘stagflation’, a condition that Keynes’ theories had not anticipated and could 
not explain. Politically, Keynesian ideas were undermined by their association 
with the ‘tax and spend’ policies that, free-market economists claimed, had sapped 
enterprise and initiative, and undermined growth by creating permanently high 
inflation. Amidst these circumstances, pre-Keynesian free-market ideas gained a 
renewed lease on life amongst a new generation of economists like Friedrich von 
Hayek (see p. 36) and Milton Friedman, who revived and revised classical theories 
to establish neoclassical economics. This was coupled with growing scepticism 
over the role of government in the economy amongst the political right, not just 
on economic grounds but also on the grounds that government intervention in 
the economy unduly impinged on freedom and stifled innovation. The resulting 
fusion of economic and political ideas was termed neoliberalism.
The rise of neoliberalism signalled a shift in economic priorities away from government 
intervention and towards the free market. In a move pioneered by ‘Reaganism’ in the 
USA and ‘Thatcherism’ in the UK, attempts were made to ‘roll back’ the frontiers 
of the state in order to release what was thought of as the natural dynamism of the

unemployment, and an

CONCEPT
Neoliberalism
Neoliberalism is an 
updated version of 
classical liberalism and, 
particularly, classical 
political economy. Its 
central theme is the idea 
that the economy works 
best when left alone by 
government, reflecting 
a belief in free-market 
economics and atomistic 
individualism. While 
unregulated market 
capitalism delivers 
efficiency, growth and 
widespread prosperity, 
the ‘dead hand’ of the 
state saps initiative and 
discourages enterprise. 
Key neoliberal policies 
include privatization, 
low public spending, 
deregulation, tax cuts and 
reduced welfare provision.

market. Many other nations followed suit, and a wave of global privatization and 
deregulation along neoliberal lines spread throughout the 1980s and 1990s.
Neoliberalism amounts to a form of market fundamentalism. The key virtue of the 
market, as articulated by Hayek, was that it operates as a vast nervous system that is 
capable of regulating the economy because it can convey an almost infinite number 
of messages simultaneously via the price mechanism. Influenced by monetarism, 
neoliberals sought to replace the Keynesian emphasis on achieving full employment 
with a focus instead on ensuring ‘sound money’, by achieving low or even zero inflation. 
By contrast, they argue, Keynesian policies designed to boost output and reduce 
unemployment merely fuel inflation by encouraging governments to borrow and 
‘print money’. The alternative is to shift attention away from demand-side policies that 
encourage consumers to consume, and towards supply-side policies that encourage 
producers to produce. For neoliberals, this invariably means deregulation and tax cuts.
To some extent modern economics has moved beyond the simplistic nostrums 
of Keynesianism and neoliberalism, and developed more sophisticated economic 
strategies, even a ‘new’ political economy. Neoliberalism, at the very least, succeeded 
in convincing Keynesians of the importance of inflation and of the significance of the 
economy’s supply side. On the other hand, the idea of an unregulated market economy 
has also been difficult to sustain, particularly in the light of the tendency for this type 
of economy to bring about low investment, short-termism and social fragmentation 
or breakdown. As Francis Fukuyama (1996) pointed out, wealth creation of any kind 
depends on social capital in the form of trust, and not just on impersonal market forces.
Though neoliberalism continues to dominate the contemporary political economy, 
the basic debate between government intervention and laissez-faire continues to be 
a potent one and is often revived in wake of economic crises. The global financial 
crisis of 2007–8, the European debt crisis and the economic crash and inflation 
issues caused by Covid-19 are recent examples where the neoliberal economic 
paradigm has been criticized, and calls for more state intervention, or even a revival 
of Keynesianism, are not uncommon in such contexts.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
INDIA: IS THERE A MIDDLE GROUND IN POLITICAL ECONOMY?
Since independence in 1947, India has historically been a 
case of a political economy that has mixed free-market 
and socialist ideas. India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal 
Nehru, was sympathetic to socialist thought, and believed 
in a strong, centralized government and a planned economy 
to industrialize a primarily agricultural nation. However, 
Nehru did not seek to eliminate private enterprise, which 
he recognized as critical to incentivizing innovation and 
growth. What evolved was a mixed economy, a common 
compromise adopted in the developing world that 
supposedly blended the best elements of free-market 
capitalism and classical economic thought with Keynesian 
and state capitalism. In India, major strategic and heavy 
industries would be controlled by the state, but a relatively 
free market operated in the other sectors. Meanwhile, a 
central planning commission would create five-year plans 
for the economy that prioritized social outcomes like 
poverty reduction. Though much of the economy was still 
left to private enterprise, the Indian state used regulations 
and permits to help direct economic activity and promote 
socially desirable outcomes. The resulting system became 
known as the ‘License Raj’. By the 1960s, India’s level of 
economic intervention was certainly far greater than the 
Keynesian approach in Western market economies, yet 
far more market-oriented Others communist and fully 
socialist regimes.
In the early years, state-driven development of strategic 
industries was considered broadly successful. In a 
postcolonial nation with limited private capital and a 
low skill base, state-backed enterprises were able to 
develop strategic sectors of the economy at a rapid pace, 
particularly in steel, petroleum, cement, energy, chemicals 
and shipping, sectors which are foundational to other areas 
of economic development. State-subsidized and regulated 
access to fertilizer, seed stock and farm equipment was 
critical for millions of private farmers in India to transition 
away from subsistence farming and move towards more 
productive mechanized methods with higher crop￾yields. State investment was also directed to traditionally 
neglected and impoverished areas.
But despite significant initial strides, India’s growth 
rate was often sluggish. And though key indicators like 
poverty and unemployment fell steadily, India’s economic 
progress lagged far behind many of its regional neighbours, 
particularly Japan and South Korea. Critics highlighted the 
arcane bureaucracy of the License Raj as a particular issue – 
by the 1970s it was not unusual for dozens of government 
agencies to be involved in granting production licences, 
creating huge delays and complexities, and effectively 
discouraging people from running businesses and growing 
the economy. Others questioned the ability of state￾backed companies to evolve and innovate due to a lack of 
competition. For example, in the 1970s a state-company – 
Scooters India – was established to manufacture scooters. 
Originally licensed from Italian designs, the company was 
initially a success with millions of Indians being able afford 
a scooter for the first time. However, the state enterprise 
did little to improve their designs or evolve their business 
strategy, and by the 1980s private companies began 
manufacturing better alternatives at competitive prices 
that started to outsell the state-produced version. By the 
2000s, Scooters India was running at a significant loss, 
subsidized by the taxpayers.
In the 1990s, a growing consensus emerged that the 
License Raj was not working, and several bursts of economic 
liberalization occurred. Price controls, quotas and rationing 
were some of the first regulations to go. Licensing 
requirements were abolished or significantly reduced for 
thousands of types of products and services. Foreign and 
private investment, rather than state investment, were 
encouraged. The results were promising – India’s growth 
rate picked up dramatically in the late 1990s, and within 
a decade, one of the largest declines in poverty on record 
was observed. While state-run industries like steel and

power continued to grow steadily, the lion’s share of the 
growth occurred in non-state sectors, like information 
technology, which has thrived in a comparatively 
unregulated environment, and has found a competitive 
advantage overseas in an increasingly globalized economy.
Critics, however, noted that this new growth has been 
highly concentrated in certain areas, and the gap between 
rich and poor, and between the rural and urban population, 
has increased dramatically in the same period. A crisis of 
rural suicides has emerged, particularly as many farmers, 
with less state support and increasingly indebted to private 
companies, have been unable to make ends meet. Less 
regulation has caused a significant surge in pollution and 
environmental issues. As a result, liberalization of the 
Indian economy remains partial, and though it has moved 
towards free-market capitalism, many areas remain under 
state control. Five-year plans were abandoned in 2014, 
though state direction of the economy is still significant. 
The major political parties of India are divided on whether 
to continue embracing the growth and further dismantle 
the License Raj, or whether to halt, or even reverse, 
the process to once again prioritize social, rather than 
economic, outcomes.
GLOBALIZATION
Understanding globalization
Globalization is a slippery and elusive concept. Despite intensifying interest in the 
phenomenon of globalization since the 1980s, the term is still used to refer, variously, to 
a process, a policy, a marketing strategy, a predicament or even an ideology. The problem 
with globalization is that it is not a single process but a complex of processes, sometimes 
overlapping and interlocking, but also at times contradictory and oppositional. It is 
difficult therefore to reduce globalization to a single theme. Perhaps the best attempt to 
do this was in Kenichi Ohmae’s (1989) idea of a ‘borderless world’. This not only refers 
to the tendency of traditional political borders, based on national and state boundaries, 
to become permeable; it also implies that divisions between people previously separated 
by time and space have become less significant and are sometimes entirely irrelevant. 
Jan Aart Scholte (2017) therefore argued that globalization is linked to the growth of 
supraterritorialrelations between people. For instance, huge flows of electronic money 
now surge around the world at the flick of a computer switch, ensuring that currency 
and other financial markets react almost immediately to economic events anywhere 
in the world. Similarly, cable and satellite technology allow telephone messages and 
television programmes to be transmitted around the world almost instantaneously.
The interconnectedness that globalization has spawned is multidimensional (see 
Figure 7.1). The popular image of globalization is that it is a top-down process, the 
establishment of a single global system that imprints itself on all parts of the world. In 
this view, globalization is linked to homogenization as cultural, social, economic and 
political diversity are destroyed in a world in which we all watch the same television 
programmes, buy the same commodities, eat the same food, support the same sports 
stars and follow the antics of the same celebrities. Nevertheless, globalization often 
goes hand in hand with localization, regionalization and multiculturalism (see p.
205). This occurs for a variety of reasons. In the first place, the declining capacity of 
the nation-state to organize economic and political life in a meaningful way allows 
power to be sucked downwards, as well as squeezed upwards. Thus, as allegiances 
based on the nation and political nationalism fade, they are often replaced by ones 
linked to local community or region, or religious and ethnic identity. Religious 
fundamentalism (see p. 55) can, for instance, be seen as a response to globalization. 
Supraterritoriality:
A condition in which 
social life transcends 
territory through the 
growth of ‘transborder’ 
and ‘transglobal’ 
communication and 
interactions.
Homogenization:
The tendency for all parts 
or elements (in this case, 
countries) to become 
similar or identical.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_7.indd 181 23-07-2024 17:40:34182 POLITICS
Second, the fear or threat of homogenization, especially when it is perceived as a 
form of imperialism, provokes cultural and political resistance. This can lead to a 
resurgence of interest in declining languages and minority cultures, as well as to a 
backlash against globalization, most obviously through the emergence of new ‘anti￾capitalist’ and anti-free-trade social movements. Third, rather than simply bringing 
about a global monoculture, globalization has in some ways fashioned more complex 
patterns of social and cultural diversity in developing and developed states alike. In 
developing states, Western consumer goods and images have been absorbed into 
more traditional cultural practices through a process of indigenization. Developed 
states, also, have not escaped the wider impact of cultural exchange, being, in return 
for Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and MTV, increasingly influenced by non-Western 
religions; medicines and therapeutic practices; and art, music and literature.
Indigenization:
The process through 
which alien goods and

CONCEPT
Globalization
Globalization is 
the emergence of 
a complex web of 
interconnectedness 
that means that our 
lives are increasingly 
shaped by events that 
occur, and decisions 
that are made, at a 
great distance from us. 
The central feature of 
globalization is therefore 
that geographical 
distance and territorial 
boundaries, such as 
those between nation￾states, are of declining 
relevance. By no 
means, however, does 
globalization imply 
that ‘the local’ and ‘the 
national’ are subordinate 
to ‘the global’. Rather, 
it highlights the 
deepening, as well as 
the broadening, of the 
political process, in the 
sense that local, national 
and global events 
constantly interact.

Figure 7.1 Systemic interdependencies
Distinctive forms of globalization can also be identified. The most significant of these 
are:
 economic globalization
 cultural globalization
 political globalization.
Economic globalization
Economic globalization is reflected in the idea that no national economy is now 
an island: all economies have, to a greater or lesser extent, been absorbed into an 
interlocking global economy. The OECD (1995) thus defined globalization as ‘a shift 
from a world of distinct national economies to a global economy in which production 
is internationalized and financial capital flows freely and instantly between countries’. 
The collapse of communism gave powerful impetus to economic globalization in 
that it paved the way for the absorption into the global capitalist system of the last 
significant block of states that had remained outside it. Economic globalization, for 
that matter, also helped to precipitate the collapse of communism, in that lower trade 
barriers, an end to exchange controls and freer movement of investment capital from 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_7.indd 182 23-07-2024 17:40:35POLITICAL ECONOMY AND GLOBALIZATION 183
the 1980s onwards had helped to widen the economic gap between the capitalist West 
and an economically stagnant communist East. Economic globalization has been 
reinforced and further accelerated by international institutions such was the World 
Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), which have sought to align global economic and trade policies. One of 
the key implications of economic globalization is the reduced capacity of national 
governments to manage their economies and, in particular, to resist their restructuring 
along free-market lines. In some cases, like the Eurozone of the European Union, 
countries have even willingly surrendered sovereignty over key economic policy 
levers to a supranational body to achieve better economic integration.
Cultural globalization
Cultural globalization is the process whereby information, commodities and images 
that have been produced in one part of the world enter into a global flow that tends 
to ‘flatten out’ cultural differences between nations, regions and individuals. Driven, 
in part, by the growth of transnational corporations (TNCs) and the emergence 
of global commodities, cultural globalization is also fuelled by the ‘information 
revolution’, the spread of satellite communication, telecommunications networks, 
information technology and the internet, and global media corporations. However, 
as pointed out earlier, culture both serves and constrains the forces of globalization. 
In addition to the ubiquity of Hollywood movies, Nike running shoes and Starbucks 
coffee houses, selling goods across the world requires a sensitivity to indigenous 
cultures and social practices. In recent decades, cultural globalization has become 
increasingly contentious, particularly as smaller nations fear their traditional cultures 
and languages are being threatened by the adoption of outside practices.
Political globalization
Political globalization is evident in the growing importance of international 
organizations, which exercise jurisdiction not within a single state, but across 
a transnational area comprising multiple states. Most such organizations have 
emerged in the post-1945 period. Some, like the United Nations, are truly global 
in scope, though arguably the most influential to develop have been regional in 
nature, such as the European Union, the Arab League, the African Union, NATO 
and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). When they conform to the 
principles of intergovernmentalism (see p. 446), international organizations provide 
a mechanism that enables states, at least in theory, to take concerted action without 
sacrificing national sovereignty. Supranational bodies, on the other hand, are able to 
impose their will on nation-states. The inter-state emphasis of political globalization 
sets it apart from the rival conceptions of economic and cultural globalization, 
which highlight the role of non-state and market-based actors. Moreover, insofar 
as it reflects an idealist commitment to internationalism and some form of world 
government, political globalization lags markedly behind economic and cultural 
globalization. Whereas a global state remains a seemingly distant prospect, a global 
economy and even a global civil society have perhaps already arrived. Though to 
what extent a truly ‘global’ economy or society can exist without a genuinely global 
politics or governance is debated (Hirst et al. 2009).
CONCEPT
Transnational 
corporations
A transnational 
corporation (TNC) is a 
company that controls 
economic activity in 
two or more countries. 
The term transnational 
corporation is now 
generally preferred 
to multinational 
corporation because 
it captures the extent 
to which corporate 
strategies and processes 
transcend national 
borders, rather than 
merely crossing them. 
Integration across 
economic sectors and 
the growth of intra￾firm trade has allowed 
TNCs to become 
economies in their own 
right, benefiting from 
geographical flexibility, 
advantages in product 
innovation and the 
ability to pursue global 
marketing strategies.

Rise of neoliberal globalization
Globalization in the modern period has gone hand in hand with the advance of 
neoliberalism, so much so that the two forces are commonly thought of as parts of 
the same larger phenomenon. A major reason for this is that intensified international 
competition has encouraged governments to deregulate their economies and reduce 
tax levels in the hope of attracting investment and preventing TNCs from relocating 
elsewhere. Strong downward pressure has also been exerted on public spending, 
and particularly welfare budgets, by the fact that, in a context of heightened 
global competition, the control of inflation has displaced the maintenance of full 
employment as the principal goal of economic policy. Such pressures, together with 
the revived growth and productivity rates of the US economy and the relatively 
sluggish performance of other models of national capitalism, meant that by the late 
1990s neoliberalism appeared to stand unchallenged as the dominant ideology of 
the ‘new’ world economy. Only a few states, such as China, were able to deal with 
neoliberal globalization on their own terms, limiting their exposure to competition 
by, for instance, holding down their exchange rate.
The remaking of the world economy along neoliberal lines was also stimulated by the 
conversion of the institutions of global economic governance, especially the World 
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to the ideas of what during the 
1990s came to be called the ‘Washington consensus’ (see p. 185). This led developing 
states and, after the collapse of communism, ‘transition’ states, to pursue policies 
such as free trade, the liberalization of capital markets, floating exchange rates, 
balanced budgets and so on. The advance of neoliberal globalization coincided not 
only with three decades of growth in the USA and its renewed economic ascendancy 
in the 1990s, but also three decades of growth in the world economy.
At the core of the neoliberal growth model are financial markets and the process of 
financialization. This was made possible by a massive expansion of the financial 
sector of the economy, explaining the growing importance of international financial 
centres like New York, London, Frankfurt and Singapore to the global economy. In 
the process, capitalism was turned into ‘turbo-capitalism’, benefiting from greatly 
expanded monetary flows that were seeking an outlet in increased investment and 
higher consumption. Although this process involved a considerable growth of public 
and private debt, this was thought to be sustainable due to the underlying growth 
such debt fuelled. Other key features of the neoliberal growth model included strong 
faith in open markets and trade liberalization, encouraged after 1995 by the creation 
of the WTO, and a shift in many developed economies from manufacturing to 
services, the former increasingly being outsourced to the developing world where 
labour and other costs are cheaper.
Neoliberal globalization, nevertheless, has its critics. Some have argued, for example, 
that, in rolling back welfare provision and promoting an ethic of material self￾interest, neoliberalism struggles to maintain popular legitimacy as an economic 
doctrine because of its association with widening inequality and social breakdown. 
This led to a modification, although not a rejection, of the ‘neoliberal revolution’ 
in many countries, such as New Zealand, Canada and the UK during the 1990s.

insecurities unleashed by the ‘shock therapy’ application of neoliberal principles in 
the 1990s, created a backlash against market reform and led to strengthened support 
for nationalist and authoritarian movements. At a deeper level, Robert Cox (1987) 
argued that what he called ‘hyper-liberal globalizing capitalism’ is rooted in major 
contradictions and struggles, meaning that its dominance is destined to be challenged 
and, eventually, overthrown. These contradictions include the ‘democratic deficit’ 
that is generated by the tendency of neoliberal states to respond to the dictates of 
the global economy rather than public opinion, the growing pressure to protect the 
environment from the ravages caused by economic growth, and the surrender of 
state authority to corporate and economic interests. A still darker interpretation 
of neoliberalism has been developed by Naomi Klein (2008). In highlighting the 
rise of ‘disaster capitalism’, she drew attention to the extent to which the advance 
of neoliberalism has been implicated with economic crashes, states of emergency 
and crises of one kind or another, thus suggesting that the USA’s foreign policy 
adventurism, from the CIA’s role in the overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile in 
1973 to the ‘war on terror’ (see p. 468) has been linked to the spread of neoliberalism.
Neoliberalism in crisis?
Despite the rapid globalization of neoliberalism, several global crises in the political 
economy in recent decades have caused many to question whether the new global 
economic order is ultimately sustainable. Perhaps the most potent challenge of the 
twenty-first century came with the 2007–9 global financial crisis, peaking in late 2008, 
when the 158-year-old US investment bank, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy. 
Amongst other things, the two government-sponsored mortgage corporations, 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, had to be bailed out by the federal authorities; the 
insurance giant AIG was only saved by a $58 billion government rescue package; 
and Wachovia, the fourth largest US bank, was bought by Citigroup, absorbing $42 
billion of bad debt. Banking crises erupted elsewhere and stock markets went into 
freefall worldwide, massively reducing share values and betokening the onset of a 
global recession. However briefly, global capitalism appeared to teeter on the brink 
of the abyss, threatening to tip over into systemic failure.
Debates about the implications of the 2007–9 crisis are closely linked to disagreements 
about its underlying causes. Was the crisis rooted in the US banking system, in 
Anglo-American enterprise capitalism, or in the nature of the capitalist system itself? 
At one level, the crisis was linked to the inappropriate lending strategies adopted 
by US banks and mortgage institutions, the so-called ‘sub-prime’ mortgage market. 
These high-risk loans to applicants with poor or non-existent credit histories were 
unlikely to be repaid and, when the scale of ‘toxic debt’ became apparent, shock 
waves ran through the US financial system that in turn destabilized the international 
financial system, as many foreign banks and investors had significant exposure to US 
securities. At a deeper level, however, the ‘sub-prime’ problem in the USA was merely 
a symptom of the vulnerabilities of the neoliberal capitalism that had taken root in 
many Western countries, based on free markets and an inflated and under-regulated 
financial system. Major economic crises followed in subsequent years in several 
other developed nations, like Iceland, Ireland and Cyprus, also driven by reckless 
lending practices by banks and property bubbles. In this view, the crisis highlighted

in Washington –

development as growth,

ideas of neoliberalism,

DEBATING . . .
IS GLOBAL CAPITALISM INHERENTLY UNSTABLE AND CRISIS-PRONE?
Whereas ideological debate once centred on the battle between capitalism and socialism, it now focuses on the benefits and 
drawbacks of the global capitalist system. Are risk, uncertainty and a tendency towards crisis inevitable features of global 
capitalism? Or is instability merely a symptom of the remarkable dynamism of capitalism, a dynamism that is ultimately 
capable of delivering global prosperity.
YES NO
Crises of overproduction. The earliest and most damning 
critique of capitalism was advanced by Karl Marx (see 
p. 43). Marx drew attention to capitalism’s tendency 
towards cyclical crises of overproduction. Booms and 
slumps were inevitable because of the tendency of 
businesses to over-expand output (overproduction) 
during times of growth but to over-contract output 
(underproduction) during times of recession. For 
Marx, these crises would become progressively deeper, 
eventually leading to systemic collapse. This analysis 
applies equally to domestic and global capitalism.
Creative destruction. For Joseph Schumpeter (1942), 
capitalism’s inherent instability stems from spurts of 
innovation that destroy established enterprises and yield 
new ones. The notion of ‘creative destruction’ captures 
both the idea that it is entrepreneurs who shape 
economies, generating growth and, through success or 
failure, setting business cycles in motion, and the idea 
that innovation is the main driver of wealth. Schumpeter 
(see p. 249) was pessimistic about the long-term 
prospects of capitalism, arguing that the human and 
social costs of periodic slumps, and the stifling of 
dynamism, creativity and individualism through the 
growth of elitism and state intervention would ultimately 
lead to capitalism’s demise.
Casino capitalism. Modern global capitalism’s heightened 
susceptibility towards crisis can be explained in terms 
of the emergence of a globalized financial system that 
leaves states vulnerable and exposed to the vagaries of 
global markets. In what Susan Strange (1996) dubbed 
‘casino capitalism’, massive amounts of ‘mad money’ 
surge around the world creating the phenomenon of 
financial contagion, which occurs as panic spreads well 
beyond the scope of an initial problem. Such instabilities 
are accentuated by the fact that most modern financial 
growth has occurred in the form of purely money￾dealing currency and security exchanges, such as so￾called ‘hedge funds’ and ‘derivatives’. Globalized financial 
flows thus create booms and slumps that may have little 
to do with the performance of ‘real’ economies. 
Dynamism within equilibrium. No supporter of capitalism 
would argue that a susceptibility to booms and slumps can 
ever be completely eradicated from the capitalist system. To 
deny this would be to misunderstand the essentially dynamic 
nature of capitalism, the fact that market economies exist 
always in conditions of flux. This flux, nevertheless, is much 
more creative than destructive: businesses and industries 
fail, but only to be replaced by ones that are more successful. 
Eradicate risk and uncertainty from a market economy and 
you rob it of its potential for growth. The point is that the 
tendency towards flux and dynamism within capitalism 
is neither random nor unstructured. At the heart of the 
capitalist system is a bias in favour of balance or equilibrium, 
brought about as the market draws resources towards their 
optimal use in terms of profitability, thus leading to greater 
efficiency and, over time, wider prosperity. Boom-and-bust 
cycles should therefore be seen as part of a process of long￾term economic development.
Regulated globalization. In an alternative defence of global 
capitalism, the tendency towards instability and crisis in 
the world economy can be substantially contained (but 
never eradicated) by regulation. This was borne out by 
the ‘long boom’ of the post-Second World War period, 
when Keynesian strategies dominated national economic 
policy-making and were embodied in the Bretton Woods 
system, constructed in 1944. The misfortune of early 
global capitalism was that it became entangled with a 
neoliberal philosophy that encouraged an undue faith in 
free markets, and that it flourished before the institutions 
of global economic governance had the capacity to exercise 
effective regulation. The result was a succession of financial 
crises that led up to and continued beyond the crisis of 
2007–9. Global capitalism can, nevertheless, be protected 
from itself. For example, greater stability could be injected 
into the global financial system if (as Keynes, in fact, had 
originally proposed) the IMF became a global bank, acting 
as the lender of last resort.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_7.indd 186 23-07-2024 17:40:35POLITICAL ECONOMY AND GLOBALIZATION 187
the flaws of market fundamentalism, providing a dramatic reminder of the need for 
financial regulation. At a deeper level still, the crisis has been interpreted as exposing 
serious flaws in the capitalist system itself. In this light, capitalism, in both its global 
and national forms, can be viewed as inherently unstable and crisis-prone.
The 2007–9 crisis was the first genuinely global crisis in the world economy since 
the ‘stagflation’ crisis of the 1970s, and it gave rise to some of the most severe falls 
in global production levels since the Great Depression of the 1930s. As most major 
economies returned to growth in 2009, it appeared that the massive efforts quickly 
initiated by national governments and coordinated by the world’s largest economies 
had been successful. These had seen the recapitalizing of banks, substantial cuts 
in interest rates and a boost to domestic demand by allowing spending to exceed 
taxation. However, renewed and severe economic problems emerged from late 2010 
onwards, not least in the form of sovereign debt crises in a number of ‘eurozone’ 
economies. This suggested that the legacy of the crisis may be more serious and far￾reaching than at first thought.
Of all the structural problems that have been exposed by the crisis, chronic public 
and private indebtedness in many developed economies is the most serious. This has 
occurred for at least three reasons. First, the failure of productivity growth to produce 
increases in real wages meant that many developed economies had lost their ‘demand 
engines’. In this context, growth could only be injected into the economy through 
ever-higher levels of borrowing (in the form of mortgages, bank loans, the use of 
credit cards and hire purchase and so on), which governments either condoned or 
actively encouraged. This has been called ‘privatized Keynesianism’ (Crouch 2009), 
reflecting the extent to which private debt had displaced public debt as the key motor 
of growth. Second, governments allowed sovereign debt to rise, both because they 
assumed that growth would continue, thus keeping tax revenues (and thus the ability 
to repay those loans) healthy, and because of the political benefits of sustaining or 
boosting public spending without commensurate tax increases. Third, the global 
economic downturn that occurred, particularly in the developed world, in the wake 
of the crisis substantially reduced tax revenues, often throwing public finances into 
chaos with a resulting explosion of borrowing.
However, the (obvious) cure to high levels of public borrowing may be worse than the 
disease, or, at least, it may make the disease worse not better. If chronic indebtedness 
is the problem, the solution would appear to be debt reduction, brought about by 
reducing public spending or increasing tax levels. This, however, brings with it major 
economic and political difficulties. The economic problem of deficit reduction is 
that what might make good sense for a single economy trying to get its finances in 
order spells catastrophe if adopted by a large number of economies at the same time. 
As suggested by the ‘paradox of thrift’, popularized by Keynes, the net result of 
everyone saving money (in this case, governments cutting spending levels or raising 
taxes) is that everyone suffers as insufficient demand in the economy which leads to 
economic stagnation.
One of the most widely anticipated consequences of the crisis was that it would lead 
to a re-evaluation, and possibly a rejection, of the neoliberal model of globalization. 
This was because the crisis originated, and was initially most severe, in those

economies that had embraced neoliberalism with the greatest enthusiasm, and 
because a major factor in explaining the crisis was an over-reliance on an, arguably, 
inherently unstable financial sector. Moreover, history seems to suggest that major 
crises lead to transformations in the management of the world economy (Casey 
2011). The Great Depression of the 1930s led, via Roosevelt’s New Deal in the USA, 
to a shift in the post-1945 world in favour of Keynesianism, while the ‘stagflation’ 
crisis of the 1970s contributed to the abandonment of Keynesianism and the rise 
of neoliberalism. But there was no shift of similar proportions in response to the 
2007–9 crisis, nor in response to other shocks.
More recently, the problems of our highly globalized economy were highlighted by 
the Covid-19 epidemic. Not only did the disease spread at an unprecedented rate 
around the world due to our interconnectedness, but shutdowns and slowdowns in 
afflicted countries disrupted the complex global supply chain, creating bottlenecks 
and shortages that were felt globally. However, unlike in the 1930s and 1970s, no 
political consensus has emerged over what economic philosophy should replace 
global neoliberalism, or even if it needs replacing at all.
Backlash against globalization
Globalization has never enjoyed universal support. Almost as soon as globalization 
was recognized as a new and important phenomenon in world politics, oppositional 
or resistant forces started to emerge. These, initially, took the form of the anti￾globalization movement. Also called the ‘anti-capitalist’, ‘anti-corporate’ or ‘global 
justice’ movement, the anti-globalization movement is a loose coalition of groups 
that embraces a broad leftist agenda, influenced by anarchist, revolutionary 
socialist, ecological and other forms of thinking. Among the issues that anti￾globalization activists have highlighted are the dominance of the world economy by 
the interests of the USA and other developed states, the threat to democracy posed 
by the growing power of transnational corporations, the trend towards widening 
global inequality and the problem of environmental degradation in its various 
forms. Though anti-globalization activism has undoubtedly helped to bring about 
cultural change, not least over matters such as global warming and the plight of 
the developing world, it has remained, essentially, a protest movement and has had 
limited impact on policy-making at either a domestic or international level. This 
has been compounded by the emergence, since the 1980s, of a pro-globalization 
consensus among mainstream political parties across the globe, brought about, 
in particular, by the willingness of centre-left parties to adopt a more pro-market 
ideological stance.
However, in a trend that dates back to the early 2000s but which accelerated markedly 
after the crisis of 2007–9, mainstream politics, particularly in Europe and North 
America, has been challenged by a rising tide of populism (see p. 56) of one kind 
or another. In many cases, this populism has been articulated by far-right parties, 
such as France’s National Rally and Austria’s Freedom Party, the latter’s candidates 
for the presidency having been defeated only narrowly in the 2016 election. In other 
cases, left-wing populism has been espoused often by newly created parties, such as 
Syriza in Greece, which was elected to power twice in 2015, and Podemos in Spain. 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_7.indd 188 23-07-2024 17:40:35POLITICAL ECONOMY AND GLOBALIZATION 189
In  Italy,  a government was formed in 2018 that was dominated by an alliance 
between a far-right party, Lega Nord and the populist Five Star Movement (see p.
506). In yet other cases, populist upsurges have erupted in mainstream parties such 
as the US Republican Party, where it was first evident in the emergence of the Tea 
Party movement in 2009, and the UK Labour Party, where it has been associated 
with Jeremy Corbyn’s election as party leader in 2015.
Resurgent populism was nevertheless perhaps most clearly demonstrated by the 
tumultuous events of 2016, which witnessed, in June, the Brexit referendum vote 
that endorsed the UK’s departure from the EU, the world’s largest trading bloc, and, 
in November, the election of Donald Trump, a businessman-media celebrity with no 
previous experience of holding public office, as US president. However, one of the 
characteristic features of these manifestations of populism is that each of them seeks 
to blend anti-elitism with hostility to developments associated with globalization. 
This has been reflected, most crucially, in calls for immigration, seen as a threat to 
national identity and social cohesion, to be banned or more effectively controlled, but 
other examples include opposition to the ‘European project’ (Euroscepticism) and 
the desire to protect domestic markets from supposedly unfair trading arrangements 
(protectionism or ‘Trumpism’).
The populist backlash against globalization in contemporary Europe and North 
America has undoubtedly been fuelled by frustrations and concerns that have an 
economic basis. In that sense, the developed West, in many ways the creative force 
behind the modern global economy, and the region in which globalization is most 
pervasive and entrenched, may have become a ‘victim’ of economic globalization. 
This has happened in at least three ways. First, rates of economic growth in the USA 
and Western Europe have dropped off since the 1970s, with inevitable consequences 
for living standards. ‘Real’ living standards for middle-income households in the 
USA have, for example, hardly risen for over thirty years. Sluggish growth in the 
West, and, consequently, stagnant living standards, may reflect a shift in the balance 
of power in the global economy, which (as discussed in the previous section) once 
favoured the USA and developed states generally, but now increasingly favours 
China, India and other emerging powers.
Second, since the 1980s most Western societies have experienced a marked 
increase in within-country inequality, helping to foster both resentment towards 
the elites and disillusionment with a democratic system that no longer seems to 
work for the less well-off. This has occurred as attempts to cut taxes and reduce 
economic regulation disproportionately benefit the wealthy, while the poor 
are kept poor by pressure to scale down welfare provision. Third, the modern 
global trading system makes it much easier for goods to be manufactured in 
lower-wage economies and then shipped back to advanced industrial ones. In 
what amounts to the export of manufacturing jobs, this confronts workers in 
developed societies, especially unskilled and semi-skilled workers, with the 
prospect of unemployment and job insecurity. Thus, ironically, in globalizing 
the economy and spreading its ideas, the West must now seemingly contend 
with a smaller share of the global economic pie and adjust its own systems and 
expectations as a result.

CHAPTER 8
POLITICS, SOCIETY 
AND IDENTITY
KEY ISSUES
 What have been the political implications of the emergence of postindustrial societies?
 Is the ‘information society’ a myth or a reality?
 How has the growth of individualism affected community and social cohesion?
 Why has the politics of identity become so prominent in recent years?
 How have race and ethnicity, gender and religion provided the basis for identity politics?
 Is identity politics a liberating force or a political dead-end?
PREVIEW
To suggest, as textbooks tend to do, that politics takes place in a social context fails to convey just how intimately 
politics and social life are related. Politics, by its very nature, is a social activity, and it is viewed by some as nothing 
more than the process through which the conflicts of society are articulated and, perhaps, resolved. In this sense, 
society is no mere ‘context’, but the very stuff and substance of politics itself. Although later chapters examine the 
interaction between society and politics in relation to particular channels of communication, such as the media, 
elections, political parties, interest groups and so on, this chapter focuses on the broader political implications 
of how society is structured and how it has changed and continues to change. For example, the transition from 
agrarian societies to industrial societies and then to so-called postindustrial society has profoundly altered levels 
of social connectedness and given rise to new political battle lines. Not only has postindustrialism been associated 
with the declining significance of social class, but technological change, particularly in the fields of information and 
communication, has altered the breadth and depth of connections between people, as well as the nature of these 
connections. These and related factors have been linked to the strengthening of individualism, with major political 
consequences. Modern thinking about the relationship between politics and society is, nevertheless, increasingly 
focused on the question of identity, which many claim is, giving rise to a new politics of group self-assertion, or 
identity politics. This trend has helped, amongst other things, to highlight the political significance of race and 
ethnicity, gender, religion and culture.

POLITICS AND SOCIETY
What do we mean by ‘society’? In its most general sense, a society is a collection of 
people who occupy the same territorial area. However, not every group of people 
constitutes a society. Societies are characterized by regular patterns of social interaction. 
This suggests the existence of some kind of social structure; that is, a usually stable set 
of interrelationships amongst a number of elements. Moreover, ‘social’ relationships 
involve a sense of connectedness, in the form of mutual awareness and, at least, a 
measure of cooperation. For example, warring tribes do not constitute a ‘society’, 
strictly speaking, even though they may live in close proximity to one another and 
interact regularly. That said, societies are also usually characterized by social divisions, 
in which groups and individuals occupy very different positions, reflecting an unequal 
distribution of status, wealth and/or power within the society. The nature of these 
divisions or cleavages, and the political significance of particular divisions (class, race, 
gender, age, religion and so on), of course, differ from society to society.
In all cases, though, society can be seen to shape politics in several important ways:
 The distribution of wealth and other resources in society conditions the nature of 
state power (as discussed in Chapter 3).
 Social divisions and conflicts help to bring about political change in the form of 
legitimation crises (as discussed in Chapter 4).
 Society influences public opinion and the political culture (as discussed in 
Chapter 9).
 Social structure shapes political behaviour; that is, who votes, how they vote, who 
joins parties and so on (as discussed in Chapters 10–12).
The nature of society, however, is one of the most contentious areas of political debate, 
with widely divergent views offered by different ideological traditions. Marxists, for 
instance, hold that society is characterized by irreconcilable conflict, while liberals 
tend to emphasize that harmony exists amongst competing interests and groups. 
Similarly, while liberals are inclined to view society as an artefact fashioned by 
individuals to satisfy their various needs, conservatives have traditionally portrayed 
it as organic, ultimately shaped by the forces of natural necessity.
Nevertheless, the nature of society, and therefore of social connectedness, have 
changed significantly over time. Modern society has been characterized by some 
as having transitioned from the ‘thick’ connectedness of close social bonds and 
fixed allegiances to the ‘thin’ connectedness of more fluid, individualized social 
arrangements. These changes have been linked to postindustrialism, the fading 
significance of social class (see p. 194), the emergence of so-called ‘information 
societies’, and the growth of individualism (see p. 197).
From industrialism to postindustrialism
Industrialization has been the most powerful factor shaping the structure and 
character of modern societies. It has, for instance, contributed to a dramatic increase 
in geographical mobility through the process of urbanization – by the beginning 
of the twenty-first century most of the world’s then 6.3 billion people had come to 
live in towns and cities, rather than in rural areas, which had been the norm for 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_8.indd 192 23-07-2024 12:46:11POLITICS, SOCIETY AND IDENTITY 193
most of human history. In the process, the nature of social connectedness underwent 
significant changes. One of the most influential attempts to convey this transition was 
undertaken by the German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies (1855–1936), who argued 
that the industrial revolution had transformed human society from what he termed 
Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft. Whereas pre-industrial societies had been marked 
by close-knit communities bonded by kinship, tribe or location, industrial society 
brought many diverse people together into larger and looser communities whose 
ties to each other were shallower (Tönnies 1887). The advance of industrialization 
had also changed the structure of society, with economically based class divisions 
displacing the fixed social hierarchies of more traditional societies, which were 
usually based on status and linked to land ownership. Socio-economic class thus 
emerged as the central organizing principle of society.
However, any analysis of the relationship between class and politics is bedevilled 
by problems, not least about how social class should be defined and the role that 
social classes play. The leading protagonists of class politics have come from the 
Marxist tradition. Marxists regard class as the most fundamental, and politically the 
most significant, social division. As Marx (see p. 43) put it at the beginning of the 
Communist Manifesto (1848), ‘the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history 
of class struggle’. From the Marxist perspective, capitalist societies are dominated 
by a ‘ruling class’ of property owners (the bourgeoisie) who oppress and exploit a 
class of wage slaves (the proletariat). This gives rise to a two-class model of industrial 
capitalism that emphasizes irreconcilable conflict and progressive polarization, with 
social classes being the key actors on the political stage. Marx predicted that, as 
capitalist development would be characterized by deepening crises, the proletariat 
would eventually achieve class consciousness and fulfil its destiny as the ‘gravedigger’ 
of capitalism. The proletariat would thus be transformed from a ‘class in-itself ’ (an 
economically defined category) and become a ‘class for-itself ’ (a revolutionary force).
Decline of class politics
The Marxist two-class model has, however, been discredited by the failure of Marx’s 
predictions to materialize, and by declining evidence of class struggle, at least in 
advanced capitalist societies. Even by the end of the nineteenth century, it was clear 
that the class structure of industrial societies was becoming increasingly complex, 
and that it varies from system to system, as well as over time. Max Weber (see p. 87)
was one of the first to take stock of this shift, developing a theory of stratification that 
acknowledged economic or class differences, but also took account of the importance 
of political parties and social status. In drawing attention to status as a ‘social 
estimation of honour’ expressed in the lifestyle of a group, Weber helped to prepare 
the ground for the modern notion of occupational class, widely used by social and 
political scientists. For some, however, the late twentieth century was characterized 
by the final eclipse of class politics. By the 1960s, neo-Marxists such as Herbert 
Marcuse (see p. 45) were lamenting the deradicalization of the urban proletariat, and 
looked instead to the revolutionary potential of students, women, ethnic minorities 
and the developing world. The traditional link between socialism and the working 
class was formally abandoned in works such as André Gorz’s Farewell to the Working 
Class (1982).

Most commentators agree that, behind the declining political significance of class, 
lies the emergence of so-called ‘post-industrial societies’. One of the key features of 
such societies has been the process of de-industrialization, reflected in the decline 
of labour-intensive heavy industries such as mining, metallurgy and manufacturing. 
These tended to be characterized by a solidaristic culture rooted in clear political 
loyalties and, usually, strong union organization. In contrast, the expanding service 
sectors of economies foster more individualistic and instrumentalist attitudes. 
Postindustrial societies are therefore distinguished by growing atomism and the 
weakening of social connectedness. The term ‘postindustrialism’ was popularized by 
Daniel Bell in The Coming of Post-industrial Society (1973). For Bell, postindustrial 
societies were characterized, amongst other things, by the transition from a 
labour theory of value to a knowledge theory of value, as implied by the idea of an 
‘information society’ (see p. 196). The shrinkage of the working class and growth of 
the middle class in postindustrial economies has led to the develop of what some 
have called a ‘two thirds, one third’ dynamic, where two-thirds of society enjoy a 
relatively prosperous and affluent position through employment in the service and 
information sectors, while the remaining third, if not necessarily in poverty, are in a 
more vulnerable position and do not enjoy the same access to education and income 
security (Hutton 1995). Moreover, most postindustrial societies have been marked 
by steady increases in income inequality and increasing concentration of wealth into 
the hands of a wealthy elite.
One of the most influential attempts to discuss the political implications 
postindustrialization is found in J. K. Galbraith’s The Culture of Contentment (1992). 
Galbraith (see p. 195) pointed to the emergence in modern societies, at least amongst 
the politically active, of a ‘contented majority’ whose material affluence and economic 
security encourages them to be politically conservative. This contented majority has 
provided an electoral base for the neoliberal anti-welfarist and tax-cutting policies 
that have become fashionable since the 1970s. Many socialist and labour parties, once 
powerful working-class political forces in Western democracies, began to reinvent 
themselves as parties of the middle class and to adopt ‘Third Way’ policies (see pp.
46–48) to electorally appeal to the more conservative, contented majority.
Debate about the plight of the less affluent ‘one third’ and about the nature of social 
inequality in modern societies has by contrast increasingly focused not so much 
on social class, but on what has been called the ‘underclass’. The underclass suffers 
less from poverty as it has been traditionally understood (deprivation of material 
necessities) and more from social exclusion, reflected in cultural, educational 
and social impediments to meaningful participation in the economy and society. 
However, attitudes towards social differentiation and debates about the appropriate 
response to the growth of an underclass are rooted in deeper disagreements about 
the causes and political implications of social inequality (see Chapter 2).
New technology and the ‘information society’
One of the features most associated with postindustrialism is the increased economic 
importance that is placed on intellectual capital rather than material capital – that is to 
say, on information, knowledge and brand rather than assets like buildings, equipment 
and products. This is often seen as a consequence of what has been called the ‘third’ 
CONCEPT
Social class
A class is, broadly, a 
group of people who 
share a similar social 
and economic position. 
For Marxists, class is 
linked to economic 
power, which is defined 
by the individual’s 
relationship to the 
means of production. 
From this perspective, 
the key class division is 
between the owners of 
productive wealth (the 
bourgeoisie) and those 
who live off the sale 
of their labour power 
(the proletariat). Non￾Marxist definitions of 
class are usually based 
on income and status 
differences between 
occupational groups. 
Distinctions are thus 
made between ‘middle’ 
class (or non-manual) 
workers and ‘working’ 
class (or manual) 
workers.
Postindustrial society:
A society based on service 
industries, rather than on 
manufacturing industries, 
and accompanied by a 
significant growth in the 
white-collar workforce.
Atomism: The tendency 
for society to be made 
up of a collection of self￾interested and largely 
self-sufficient individuals, 
operating as separate 
atoms.

modern information revolution, which has witnessed the advent of the internet age 
and unprecedented interconnectedness through mobile phones, cable and satellite 
television, personal computers and now social media. (The first revolution involved 
the development of the telegraph, telephone and radio, while the second centred on 
television, early-generation computers and satellites.) The extraordinary explosion 
that has occurred in the quantity and speed of information and communication 
exchanged made possible by digital technologies, has marked, some argue, the 
birth of the ‘information age’. Society has been transformed away from an industrial 
society towards an ‘information society’ (see p. 196) and the economy has become a 
‘knowledge economy’ as a consequence. For instance, in 1917 the largest companies 
in the United States were all industrial and manufacturing conglomerates, like US 
Steel, Standard Oil, International Harvester and Du Pont Chemical. A century later 
in 2017, the largest companies were almost all in the technology and financial sectors, 
such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and JP Morgan Chase.
The emergence of digital media has helped to alter both the scope and the nature 
of social connectedness. As far as the scope of social connectedness is concerned, 
digital media have given huge impetus to the process of globalization. Indeed, so￾called ‘hyperglobalist’ theorists subscribe to a kind of technological determinism 
in arguing that accelerated globalization became inevitable once new information 
and communication technologies became widely available (Ohmae 1989). While the 
industrial age (and the first two communications revolutions) created new mechanisms 
for communicating at a national, rather than a local, level, the technologies of the 
information age are, by their nature, transnational: mobile phones, satellite television 
and the internet operate regardless of borders. This, in turn, has facilitated the growth 
of trans-border groups, bodies and institutions, ranging from non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) (see p. 302), protest movements and transnational corporations 
(TNCs) (see p. 183) to international criminal organizations and global terrorist groups. 
Not only do states struggle to control and constrain organizations that have trans￾border structures, but they also have a greatly reduced capacity to control what their 
citizens see, hear and know. For instance, although states such as China, Myanmar

source of competitiveness

KEY THINKER
JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH (1908–2006)
Canadian economist and social theorist. Following wartime service as the Director of the US 
Strategic Bombing Survey, Galbraith became a professor of economics at Harvard University 
and served as the US Ambassador to India. Galbraith was closely identified with the Democratic 
Party and was perhaps the leading modern exponent of Keynesian economics (and certainly its 
most innovative advocate). He became one of the USA’s most eminent social commentators. 
In The Affluent Society (1958), Galbraith highlighted the contrast between private affluence 
and public squalor, arguing that economic resources are often used in the wasteful gratification 
of trivial wants. The New Industrial State (1967) advanced a critique of corporate power in the 
USA. His other major works include The Culture of Contentment (1992).

and Iran have, at various times, tried to restrict trans-border communications via 
mobile phones and the internet, the pace of technological change is very likely to 
weaken such controls in the longer term.
Not only do information societies connect more people to more other people, the 
nature of those connections has also changed. One of the most influential attempts 
to explain this was advanced in Manuel Castells’ (1996) notion of the ‘network 
society’. Whereas the dominant mode of social organization in industrial societies 
had been hierarchies, more complex and pluralized information societies operate 
either on the basis of markets (reflecting the wider role of market economics, as well 
as the impact of economic globalization, as discussed in Chapter 7), or on the basis 
of looser and more diffuse networks. According to Castells, businesses increasingly 
function as ‘network corporations’. Many TNCs, for instance, are organized as 
networks of franchises and subsidiaries. Similar trends can be witnessed in social 
and political life. For example, hierarchical bodies such as trade unions and pressure 
groups have increasingly lost influence through the emergence of network-based 
social movements (see Chapter 12), such as the anti-globalization movement and 
the environmental movement.
Nevertheless, opinions are divided over the implications of the wider use of 
new communications technologies for politics and society. Dating back to Ivan 
Illich’s pioneering Tools for Conviviality (1973), the potential for computer-based 
technologies to give individual citizens independent access to specialized knowledge, 
allowing them to escape from dependence on technocratic elites, has been lauded. 
In this light, digital media are a source of citizen empowerment and (potentially) 
a significant constraint on government power. Critics, in contrast, point out that 
the internet does not discriminate between good ideas and bad ones. It provides 
a platform for the dissemination not only of socially worthwhile and politically 
neutral views but also of political extremism, racial and religious bigotry, and 
pornography of various kinds. A further danger has been the growth of a ‘cult of 
information’, whereby the accumulation of data and information becomes an end in 
itself, impairing the ability of people to distinguish between information, on the one 
hand, and knowledge, experience and wisdom, on the other (Roszak 1994). Such a 
criticism is linked to allegations that ‘surfing’ the internet actually impairs people’s 
ability to think and learn by encouraging them to skim and jump from one piece 
of information to the next rather than concentrating on a subject in depth. Digital 
media may therefore be making people shallower rather than better-informed (Carr 
2008, 2010). The impact of digital media on democracy and governance is examined 
in greater detail in Chapter 9.
No such thing as society?
Although the advent of postindustrialism and the spread of IT-based, network 
relationships have encouraged the ‘thinning’ of social connectedness, at the heart 
of this trend lies a deeper process: the rise of individualism. In many parts of the 
world, the notion of ‘the individual’ is now so familiar that its political and social 
significance, as well as its relatively recent origins, are often overlooked. In traditional 
societies, there was far less emphasis on the individual as having their own interests 
or possessing unique identities. Rather, people were more commonly seen as

An information society 
is a society in which the 
creation, distribution 
and manipulation 
of information are 
core economic and 
cultural activities, 
underpinned, in 
particular, by the wider 
use of computerized 
processes and the 
internet. Information 
and knowledge are 
thus seen to have 
replaced physical 
capital as the principal 
source of wealth. In 
an ‘information age’, 
or ‘cyber age’, the 
principal responsibility 
of government is to 
improve education 
and training, both to 
strengthen international 
competitiveness and to 
widen opportunities for 
the individual.

members of the social groups to which they belonged: their family, village, tribe, 
local community and so on. Their lives and identities were largely determined by the 
character of these groups in a process that had changed little from one generation to 
the next. Indeed, traditional social and economic structures, like serfdom, caste and 
slavery, rigidly enforced classes and identities intergenerationally, leaving a limited 
scope for the individual to otherwise define themselves.
The rise of individualism is widely seen as a consequence of the establishment of 
industrial capitalism as the dominant mode of social organization, first in Western 
societies and, thanks to globalization, beyond. Industrial capitalism meant that 
people were confronted by a broader range of choices and social possibilities. They 
were encouraged to think of and define themselves in personal terms. A peasant, 
for example, whose family may always have lived and worked on the same piece of 
land, became a ‘free man’ and acquired some ability to choose who to work for, or 
maybe the opportunity to leave the land altogether and look for work in the growing 
towns or cities. As individuals, people were more likely to be self-seeking, acting in 
accordance with their own (usually material) interests, and they were encouraged to 
be self-sufficient, in the sense of taking responsibility for their economic and social 
circumstances. This gave rise to the doctrine of economic individualism.
A child of industrial capitalism, individualism has been further strengthened by the 
growth, especially since the 1960s, of consumer society and, later, by the general shift 
in favour of neoliberal economics, as examined in Chapter 7. Whereas earlier versions 
of industrial capitalism had linked people’s status in society to their productive roles 
(most clearly demonstrated by the importance traditionally placed on social class, 
a consumer society or consumer capitalism), individualism encouraged people to 
define themselves increasingly in terms of what they own and how much they own. 
While an emphasis on production tends to foster social solidarity, in that it highlights 
what people have in common with other people, consumerism encourages people 
to think and act more in individual terms, focusing on personal gratification, even 
seeing consumption as a form of self-expression. Daniel Bell (1976) interpreted 
this as evidence of a cultural contradiction that lies at the heart of the capitalist 
system, arguing that the ethic of acquisitiveness and immediate gratification (which 
encourages consumers to consume) was winning out over the ethic of asceticism 
and delayed gratification (which encourages workers to work).
There are many other factors potentially at play. In traditional societies, and even 
throughout the industrial revolution, public space like parks, plazas, taverns and 
even one’s local street were where most people, particularly the poor and working 
classes, would regularly congregate for entertainment and leisure. Rising prosperity 
after the Second World War meant that many people moved from cramped inner 
cities to larger houses in the suburbs, or into new modern apartment complexes 
that were created through urban renewal programmes. This shift, along with new 
entertainment options like radio and television, meant that relaxation and leisure time 
was increasingly spent in private rather than in social spaces. The rise of the car meant 
that people increasingly commuted, not on public buses or trains, but by themselves. 
The American sociologist Robert Putnam provides extensive substantiation of this 
concept in Bowling Alone (2000). He argues this is demonstrated in the United States 
by a 25–50 per cent drop in the number of voluntary clubs and associations since 
CONCEPT
Individualism
Individualism is the 
belief in the supreme 
importance of the 
individual over any social 
group or collective 
body. As such, 
individualism has two 
key implications. First, 
each individual has a 
separate, indeed unique, 
identity, reflecting 
his or her ‘inner’ or 
personal qualities. This 
is evident in the idea of 
individuality and is linked 
to the notion of people 
as self-interested, and 
largely self-reliant, 
creatures. Second, all 
individuals share the 
same moral status as 
‘persons’, irrespective 
of factors such as race, 
religion, nationality, sex 
and social position. This 
is reflected in the idea of 
rights, and especially in 
the doctrine of human 
rights (see p. 334).
Economic individualism:
The belief that individuals 
are entitled to autonomy 
in matters of economic 
decision-making; 
economic individualism is 
loosely linked to property 
rights.

1965, and by sharp declines in attendance at public, town and school meetings, as 
well as in the membership of, and work done for, civic organizations like political 
parties and trade unions. The title of the book references the fact that even as the 
sport of bowling increased in popularity since the 1960s, the proportion of people 
playing as part of bowling leagues or clubs has steadily declined.
The growing prominence of neoliberalism (see p. 178) from the 1980s onwards, 
especially in countries that had embraced free-market thinking with the greatest 
enthusiasm, such as the USA and the UK, further strengthened individualism. This 
occurred both through the tendency to extol the virtues of entrepreneurialism and 
individual self-striving, creating, critics argued, a philosophy of ‘greed is good’, and 
through the rolling back of welfare, based on the desire for people to ‘stand on their 
own two feet’. Margaret Thatcher’s famous assertion that ‘There is no such thing 
as society … only individual men and women and their families’, is often seen to 
encapsulate the thrust of neoliberal individualism.

US political scientist and social commentator. Putnam’s work has revived interest in civil 
society and focused attention on the importance of ‘social capital’: the social networks in a 
society that build trust and cooperation, and develop ‘the “I” into the “we”’. His most influential 
work, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community (2000), used the image 
of a man bowling alone, rather than in a team, to illustrate the decline of community activity 
and political engagement in the USA. Amongst the causes of this decline, Putnam identifies 
the growing influence of television, two-career families and longer commutes. His other major 
works include Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Italy (1993) and Better Together: 
Restoring American Community (2003).

What are the consequences of the rise of individualism? For many, the spread 
of individualism has profoundly weakened community and our sense of social 
belonging. For instance, academic sociology largely arose in the nineteenth century 
as an attempt to explore the (usually negative) social implications of the spread 
of industrialization and urbanization, both of which had encouraged increasing 
individualism and competition. The French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–
1917) thus emphasized the degree to which the weakening of social codes and norms 
had resulted in the spread of ‘anomie’. For Durkheim (1897), this had led to an 
increase in the number of suicides in industrial societies. Similar misgivings about 
the rise of individualism have been expressed by modern communitarian thinkers, 
who have linked the growth of egoism and atomism to a weakening of social duty 
and moral responsibility.
Communitarian theorists, such as Michael Sandel (1982) and Alisdair MacIntyre 
(1981), have argued that, in conceiving the individual as logically prior to and 
‘outside’ the community, liberal individualism has legitimized selfishness and 
greed, and downgraded the importance of the public good. Sandel as well as Robert 
Putnam described this process as a decline in social capital, and the implications 
Anomie: A weakening 
of values and normative 
rules, associated with 
feelings of isolation, 
loneliness and 
meaninglessness.
Social capital: The 
networks of relationships 
among people who live 
and work in a particular 
society, enabling that 
society to function 
effectively.

are significant, insofar as trust, reciprocity, charity and cooperation seem to 
diminish in societies with low social capital. They argue that anti-social behaviour 
and crime has risen, or at least, become harder to combat, because societies are less 
interconnected, people look out for each other less and individuals fall through the 
cracks more easily. Sociologists have also argued that the decline of social capital has 
significant implications for politics, as trust in government has declined, democratic 
participation has fallen and people in general are less involved in their communities 
and towns, leading to lower quality political outcomes and even poorer governance.
On the other hand, liberal theorists have viewed rising individualism as a mark of 
social progress. In this view, the forward march of individualism has been associated 
with the spread of progressive, even ‘enlightened’, social values; notably, toleration 
and equality of opportunity. If human beings are thought of, first and foremost, as 
individuals, they must be entitled to the same rights and the same respect, meaning 
that all forms of disadvantage or discrimination, based on factors such as gender (see 
p. 209), race (see p. 160), colour, creed, religion or social background, are viewed as 
morally questionable, if not indefensible.
All modern societies have, to a greater or lesser extent, been affected by the spread 
of such ideas, not least through the changing gender roles and family structures 
that have resulted from the spread of feminism. The link between individualism and 
the expansion of choice and opportunity has also been highlighted by the spread 
in modern societies of social reflexivity (Giddens 1994). This has occurred for a 
variety of reasons, including the development of mass education; much wider access 
to information through radio, television, the internet and so on; and intensified 
cultural flows within and between societies. However, social reflexivity brings 
both benefits and dangers. On the one hand, it has greatly widened the sphere of 
personal freedom, the ability of people to define who they are and how they wish 
to live, a tendency reflected in the increasing domination of politics by so-called 
‘lifestyle’ issues. On the other hand, its growth has coincided with a strengthening of 
consumerism and materialist ethics.
Nevertheless, it is important not to overstate the advance of individualism or, for 
that matter, the erosion of community. Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman (1925–
2017) saw the balance between individuality and community as a trade-off between 
freedom and security, and how that tension is resolved will depend on the cultural 
and political aspirations of a society (2001). Individualism has been embraced most 
eagerly in the English-speaking world, where it has been most culturally palatable, 
given the impact of Protestant religious ideas about personal salvation and the moral 
benefits of individual self-striving. In contrast, Catholic societies in Europe and 
elsewhere have been more successful in resisting individualism and in maintaining 
the ethics of social responsibility, reflected in a stronger desire to uphold welfare 
provision as both an expression of social responsibility and a means of upholding 
societal cohesion. Examples of successful less individualistic societies can also 
be found in Asia, such as Japan, China, South Korea and Singapore. Moreover, 
the concept of modern societies as being increasingly dominated by ‘thin’ forms 
of social connectedness has been undermined by the resurgence of ‘thick’ social 
connectedness through the rise of identity politics and the growing importance of 
ethnicity, gender, culture and religion in many parts of the world.

DEBATING . . .
DOES SOCIAL EQUALITY MATTER?
The issue of social equality lies at the heart of ideological debate and argument. While left-wingers tend to support equality, 
seeing it as the key to social justice, right-wingers typically accept inequality as inevitable, if not desirable. How does 
material inequality, particularly income inequality, affect politics and society? Do governments have a moral obligation to 
promote social equality, and, if so, on what grounds?
YES NO
Inequality and social dysfunction. Socialists have long 
argued that social inequality breeds resentment, hostility 
and strife, even, in the case of Marxists, associating 
class inequality with inevitable social revolution. Such 
concerns have also been borne out by empirical studies 
that link inequality to a range of negative personal and 
social outcomes. Comparative studies of ‘high’ inequality 
countries, such as the USA, the UK and Portugal, 
and ‘low’ inequality countries, such as Japan and the 
Scandinavian states, suggest that inequality leads to 
shorter, unhealthier and unhappier lives, reflected in 
increased rates of, for instance, teenage pregnancies, 
violence, obesity, imprisonment and addiction (Wilkinson 
and Pickett 2010).
Justice as equality. The moral case in favour of 
equality includes that poverty and social disadvantage 
impair people’s opportunities and life chances. As 
social differentiation more often results from unequal 
treatment by society than from unequal natural 
endowment, justice dictates that social rewards 
should generally be distributed more equally, and that 
this should be done through policies of welfare and 
redistribution. According to John Rawls (see p. 35), if 
people were unaware of their personal attributes and 
qualities, most would favour equality over inequality, as 
their fear of being destitute would outweigh their desire 
for great wealth.
Social citizenship. Social equality (or, more accurately, 
reduced social inequality) is a necessary condition for 
healthy democracy and meaningful citizenship. Citizens 
have to enjoy freedom from poverty, ignorance and 
despair if they are to participate fully in the affairs of 
their community, an idea embodied in the concept 
of social citizenship. Groups such as women, ethnic 
minorities, the poor and the unemployed, commonly 
regard themselves as ‘second class citizens’ if social 
disadvantage prevents their full civic and political 
participations. Social inequality thus correlates with low 
voter turnout and fuels dissent and civil unrest.
Inequality and economic growth. Liberal political 
economists link social equality to economic stagnation. This 
occurs because social ‘levelling’ serves to cap aspirations 
and remove the incentive for enterprise and hard work. 
The sterility and inertia of communist states was thus in 
large part a consequence of high levels of job security 
and low income differentials. In contrast, the USA, the 
world’s leading economy, demonstrates how inequality 
promotes economic vigour, as the rich can always get richer 
and the poor can always become more poor. Indeed, by 
strengthening incentives, inequality may actually benefit 
the poor, whose living standards may be higher in relatively 
unequal societies than they are in relatively equal societies.
Justice as inequality. Inequality is justifiable quite simply 
because people are different: they have different aspirations, 
talents, dispositions and so forth. To treat them as equals 
must therefore result in injustice. As Aristotle (see p. 4) put 
it, injustice arises not only when equals are treated unequally, 
but also when unequals are treated equally. Justice may 
require equality of opportunity, giving each person the same 
starting point in life, but certainly not equality of outcome. 
In line with the principle of meritocracy, the talented and 
hardworking should rise, while the lazy and feckless should 
fall. Pursuing equality thus involves penalizing talent.
Politics of envy. The socialist principle of equality is based on 
social envy, the desire to have what others possess. Instead 
of encouraging the less well-off to focus on improving 
their own living standards, it encourages them to resent 
the wealthy, seeing them, somehow, as the architects of 
their misfortune. As the politics of envy grows, individual 
freedom is diminished, both through the emergence of an 
extensive system of manipulation and ‘social engineering’, 
and by the fact that redistribution, in effect, legalizes theft 
(as government transfers wealth from one group of people 
to another without their consent).

IDENTITY POLITICS
Rise of identity politics
One of the prominent features of modern politics has been a growing recognition 
of the significance of cultural differences within society, often portrayed as identity 
politics, or the ‘politics of difference’. Identity politics is an orientation towards 
political agendas based on specific identities – like race, social background, gender – 
rather than a coherent body of ideas with a settled political character. It seeks to 
challenge the majority culture by reshaping a group’s identity through what amounts 
to a process of politico-cultural self-assertion. This reflects two core beliefs. The first 
is that group marginalization operates through values and stereotypes developed by 
dominant groups that structure how marginalized groups see themselves and are 
seen by others. These typically inculcate a sense of inferiority, even shame. The second 
belief is that subordination can be challenged by reshaping identity to give the group 
concerned a sense of pride and self-respect (for instance, ‘black is beautiful’ or ‘gay 
pride’). In seeking to reclaim a ‘pure’ or ‘authentic’ sense of identity, identity politics 
expresses defiance against marginalization and disadvantage, and serves as a source 
of liberation. This is what gives identity politics its typically combative character and 
imbues it with psycho-emotional force.
The foundations for identity politics were laid by the postcolonial theories that 
emerged from the collapse of the European empires after the Second World War. 
The significance of postcolonialism was that it sought to challenge and overturn the 
cultural dimension of imperial rule by establishing the legitimacy of non-Western – 
and sometimes anti-Western – political ideas and traditions. For example, Franz 
Fanon (1926–61) developed a theory of imperialism (see p. 480) that gave particular 
emphasis to the psychological dimension of colonial subjugation. For Fanon (1968), 
decolonization is not merely a political process, but one through which a new 
‘species’ of man is created. He argued that only the cathartic experience of violence 
is powerful enough to bring about this psycho-political regeneration. Edward Said 
(see p. 202) developed a critique of Eurocentrism through his notion of ‘orientalism’ 
(Said 1978). Orientalism highlights the extent to which Western cultural and political 
hegemony over the rest of the world, but over the orient (or eastern hemisphere) 
in particular, had been maintained through elaborate stereotypical fictions that 
belittled and demeaned non-Western people and culture. Examples of this would 
include notions such as the ‘mysterious East’, ‘inscrutable Chinese’ and ‘lustful Turks’.
However, manifestations of identity politics are varied and diverse. And although 
identity politics has arisen in association with oppressed or minority groups within 
society, in recent decades it has become an increasingly prevalent feature of political 
thinking even amongst majority groups. This is because identity can be shaped 
around many principles and can be motivated by both real and perceived injustices. 
The most important of these are:
 race and ethnicity
 culture and diversity
 gender and identity
 religion and politics.
Eurocentrism: A culturally 
biased approach to 
understanding that treats 
European, and generally 
Western, ideas, values and 
assumptions as ‘natural’.
Identity politics:
A style of politics that 
seeks to counter group 
marginalization by 
embracing a positive 
and assertive sense of 
collective identity.

Race and ethnicity
Racial and ethnic divisions are a significant feature of many modern societies. There is 
nothing new, however, in the link between race and politics (Fenton 2010). Racialist 
(see p. 154) political theories were developed in the nineteenth century against the 
background of European imperialism. Works such as Arthur de Gobineau’s Essay on 
the Inequality of Human Races (1855) and H. S. Chamberlain’s The Foundations of 
the Nineteenth Century (1899) attempted to provide a pseudoscientific justification 
for the dominance of the ‘white’ races of Europe and North America over the ‘black’, 
‘brown’ and ‘yellow’ peoples of Africa and Asia. Anti-Semitic political parties and 
movements emerged in countries such as Germany, Austria and Russia in the late 
nineteenth century. The most grotesque twentieth-century manifestation of such 
racialism was found in German Nazism, which, through the so-called ‘Final Solution’, 
attempted to carry out the extermination of European Jewry. Apartheid (Afrikaans 
for ‘apartness’) in South Africa consisted of the strict segregation of whites and non￾whites between the election of the Nationalist Party in 1948 and the establishment 
of a non-racial democracy under the leadership of the African National Congress 
(ANC) in 1994. Elsewhere, racialism has been kept alive through campaigns against 
immigration, organized, for example, by the British National Party (BNP) and Le 
Pen’s National Rally (RN) in France.
Very different forms of racial or ethnic politics have, nevertheless, developed out 
of the struggle against colonialism (see p. 163) in particular, and as a result of 
racial discrimination and disadvantage in general. Indeed, in seeking to challenge 
economic and social marginalization, black nationalism in the USA and elsewhere 
constituted the prototype for identity politics, especially through its emphasis on 
‘consciousness raising’. The origins of the black consciousness movement date back 
to the early twentieth century and the emergence of a ‘back to Africa’ movement, 
inspired by activists such as Marcus Garvey (see p. 149). Black politics, however, 
gained greater prominence in the 1960s with an upsurge in both the reformist

and revolutionary wings of the movement. In its reformist guise, the movement 
took the form of a struggle for civil rights that reached national prominence in 
the USA under the leadership of Martin Luther King (1929–68) and the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The strategy of 
protest and non-violent civil disobedience (see p. 313) was, nevertheless, rejected 
by the emerging Black Power movement, which supported black separatism and, 
under the leadership of the Black Panther Party, founded in 1966, promoted the 
use of physical force and armed confrontation. Of more enduring significance, too, 
has been the Nation of Islam, who advocate a separate creed based on the idea that 
black Americans are descended from an ancient Muslim tribe. Founded in 1930, the 
Nation of Islam was led for over forty years by Elijah Muhammad (1897–1975), and 
they counted amongst their most prominent activists in the 1960s the militant black 
leader Malcolm X (1925–65). Despite these sometimes radically different agendas, 
all these movements contributed significantly to raising the consciousness of black 
oppression in the United States and created an impetus for major political change, 
particularly in civil and voting rights reform. Black Americans subsequently became 
a far more influential electorate in US politics, forming a significant part of the 
Democratic Party’s voter base and an influential caucus in the US Congress.
In recent decades, new black political movements have arisen to continue the 
work of raising consciousness amongst a new generation. The international 
activist movement Black Lives Matter (BLM), founded in 2013, campaigns against 
violence and systemic racism towards black people in the USA and elsewhere. The 
organization was formed after the acquittal of a Florida police officer in the fatal 
shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African American teenager. BLM gained 
significant traction over the subsequent years, using social media to shine a spotlight 
on police violence against black Americans. Mass protests have been organized in 
response to injustice, most notably in 2020 in the wake of the murders of Breonna 
Taylor and George Floyd. Unlike the movements of the 1960s, BLM operates as a 
decentralized network with no formal hierarchy and no central leadership. Yet its 
effectiveness in raising consciousness and influencing political discourse has been 
highly effective, and its influence has spread internationally as other countries also 
reckon with legacies of racial oppression and prejudice (Dunivin et al. 2022).
The rise of ethnic consciousness has by no means occurred only in the West. Ethnic 
rivalry (often portrayed as ‘tribalism’) is not uncommon in African and Asian 
politics, and some of these rivalries are long-standing. But in many cases, the divide￾and-rule policies of the colonial period bequeathed a legacy of bitterness to newly 
independent nations. For instance, tensions and conflicts between the many ethnic 
groups of modern-day Myanmar can be traced back more than a millennium to the 
first Kingdom of Bagan. However, British rule over Myanmar significantly worsened 
the situation, as certain groups were given preferential treatment and access to 
government jobs over others, fostering resentments that broke out into armed conflict 
post-independence. Ethnic conflict has also been exacerbated in the postcolonial era 
by the attempts of majority ethnic groups to consolidate their dominance in new 
nations under the guise of ‘nation-building’. Such tensions, for instance, resulted in 
the Biafran war in Nigeria in the 1960s, a long-running civil war in Southern Sudan, 
and decades of domestic terrorism by Tamils of Sri Lanka. The worst recent example 
CONCEPT
Postcolonialism
Postcolonialism is a 
trend in literary, cultural 
and political studies that 
seeks to expose and 
overturn the cultural 
and psychological 
dimensions of colonial 
rule. It recognizes that 
inner subjugation can 
persist among former 
colonized peoples 
even long after the 
outward structures of 
colonialism have been 
removed. A major thrust 
of postcolonialism has 
been to establish the 
legitimacy of non￾Western, and sometimes 
anti-Western, political 
ideas and traditions. 
Postcolonialism has 
nevertheless taken a 
variety of forms. These 
range from Gandhi’s 
attempt to fuse Indian 
nationalism with ideas 
rooted in Hinduism 
to forms of religious 
fundamentalism.

of ethnic bloodshed, however, occurred in Rwanda in 1994, where an estimated 
800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered in an uprising by militant Hutus. The Rwandan case 
also highlights the constructed nature of identity politics, as the very idea that the 
Hutu and Tutsi constitute distinct races was largely propagated by colonial Belgian 
authorities based on pseudoscientific theories and questionable evidence.
Culture and diversity
One of the most powerful factors underpinning the global significance of identity 
politics has been the increase in international migration, particularly since the 1950s, 
and the consequent growth in cultural diversity. And though culture and race may be 
historically related, in many countries and in contemporary politics, the dividing lines 
of identity are often cultural rather than racial. Values, beliefs, customs and practices, 
and especially language, can be much more potent markers of identity and politics in 
many places, particularly in multicultural societies. As a growing number of countries 
have come to accept as an irreversible fact that their populations have a multi-ethnic, 
multi-religious or multicultural character, various attempts have been made to reconcile 
cultural diversity and identity-related difference with civic and political cohesion.
But how can political stability be maintained in societies in which the monocultural 
bonds of political nationalism have been significantly weakened? Some, indeed, view 
this as the central political challenge of the twenty-first century. Attempts to balance 
diversity against cohesion are usually dubbed multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is 
a broad and often ill-defined term, which may simply stress cultural differentiation 
that is based on race, ethnicity or language. However, multiculturalism not only 
recognizes the fact of cultural diversity; it also holds that such differences should be

respected and publicly affirmed. Such ideas have been applied most systematically 
in immigrant nations like Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but have also been 
important in Africa to help foster a sense of unity in postcolonial nations that 
typically incorporated many different ethnic groups.
The central theme within all forms of multiculturalism is that individual identity is 
culturally embedded, in the sense that people largely derive their understanding of 
the world and their framework of moral beliefs from the culture in which they live. 
Distinctive cultures therefore deserve to be protected or strengthened, particularly 
when they belong to minority or vulnerable groups. This leads to the idea of minority 
or multicultural rights, sometimes seen as ‘special’ rights. Will Kymlicka (1995) 
identified three kinds of minority rights: self-government rights, polyethnic rights 
and representation rights. Self-government rights belong, Kymlicka argued, to what 
he called ‘national minorities’, peoples who are territorially concentrated, possess a 
shared language and are characterized by a ‘meaningful way of life across the full 
range of human activities’. In these cases, he argued, the right to self-government 
should involve the devolution of political power, usually through federalism (see p.
430), although it may extend to the right of secession and, therefore, to sovereign 
independence. Karakalpakstan, for instance, is an autonomous republic within the 
nation of Uzbekistan that covers a vast desert area with a distinct culture, language 
and history to the rest of the country. Constitutionally, Karakalpakstan maintains 
its own legislature with significant powers that may veto (see p. 129) any decision 
concerning its affairs made by the national government, and it has a right to secede 
from Uzbekistan if its population votes to do so via referendum.
Polyethnic rights are rights that help ethnic groups and religious minorities that 
have developed through immigration to express and maintain their cultural 
distinctiveness. They would, for instance, provide the basis for legal exemptions, such 
as the exemption of Jews and Muslims from animal slaughtering laws, the exemption 
of Sikh men from wearing motorcycle helmets and the exemption of Muslim girls 
from school dress codes. Such rights can be controversial, as they may reveal a clash 
of values and beliefs between cultures. Language rights also fall into this category, as 
language is often seen as a core way through which culture and identity is expressed.
Finally, representation rights attempt to redress the under-representation of minority 
or disadvantaged groups in education, and in senior positions in political and public 
life. Such rights, sometimes called affirmative action, imply the practice of reverse 
or ‘positive’ discrimination, which attempts to compensate for past discrimination 
or continuing cultural subordination. Their justification is not only that they ensure 
full and equal participation, but also that they are the only means of guaranteeing 
that public policy reflects the interests of all groups and peoples, and not merely 
those of traditionally dominant groups.
However, there is neither a settled view of how multicultural societies should operate, 
nor of how far multiculturalism should go in positively endorsing communal 
diversity. The liberal model of multiculturalism, for instance, limits the tolerance of 
views, values and social practices to those that are themselves tolerant; that is, to those 
that are compatible with personal freedom and autonomy. Liberal multiculturalists 
may therefore be unwilling to endorse practices such as female circumcision, forced 
CONCEPT
Multiculturalism
Multiculturalism is used 
as both a descriptive 
and a normative term. 
As a descriptive term, 
it refers to cultural 
diversity arising from 
the existence within a 
society of two or more 
groups whose beliefs 
and practices generate 
a distinctive sense of 
collective identity. 
As a normative term, 
multiculturalism implies 
a positive endorsement 
of communal diversity, 
based on either the 
right of cultural 
groups to respect and 
recognition, or the 
alleged benefits to the 
larger society of moral 
and cultural diversity. 
Multiculturalism 
acknowledges the 
importance of beliefs, 
values and ways of life in 
establishing a sense of 
self-worth for individuals 
and groups alike.

(and possibly arranged) marriages and female dress codes. Others, however, might 
disagree with this and believe that such practices are crucial to the maintenance of 
their cultural identity. Moreover, some have charged this kind of multiculturalism 
as too rooted in Western cultural values, as liberalism itself has Eurocentric origins. 
Other have thus argued that true multiculturalism requires value pluralism as well. 
Developed in particular in the writings of Isaiah Berlin, value pluralism holds that 
people are bound to disagree about the ultimate ends of life. As values conflict, 
the human predicament is inevitably characterized by moral conflict. In this view, 
liberal or Western beliefs, such as support for personal freedom, democracy and 
secularization, have no greater moral authority than rival beliefs.
Value pluralism: The 
theory that there is 
no single, overriding 
conception of the ‘good 
life’ but, rather, many 
competing and equally 
legitimate conceptions.
KEY THINKER
ISAIAH BERLIN (1909–97)
Russian-British historian of ideas and philosopher. Berlin was born in Riga, Latvia, and came 
to Britain in 1921. He developed a form of liberal pluralism that was grounded in a lifelong 
commitment to empiricism and influenced by the ideas of counter-Enlightenment thinkers, 
including Giambattista Vico (1668–1744), Herder (see p. 147) and Alexander Herzen (1812–
70). Basic to Berlin’s philosophical stance was a belief in moral pluralism, the idea that conflicts 
of values are intrinsic to human life. His best-known political writing is Four Essays on Liberty
(1958), in which he extolled the virtues of ‘negative’ freedom over ‘positive’ freedom. Berlin’s 
writings constitute a defence of Western liberalism against totalitarianism.

Whatever way it is implemented, since the 1990s multiculturalism has been the target 
of mounting criticism, leading, in effect, to a ‘backlash against difference’. In line 
with this, there has been a retreat from ‘official’ multiculturalism, evident, among 
other things, in bans on the wearing of veils by Muslim women in public places, such 
as those introduced in France and Belgium. Hostility towards multiculturalism has 
been most prominently associated with resurgent populist nationalism (discussed in 
Chapter 6), at the heart of which typically resides a fierce attack on what are seen as 
the related evils of immigration and cultural diversity.
Such a stance is based on essentially conservative assumptions. The chief conservative 
objection to multiculturalism is that shared values and a common culture are a 
necessary precondition for a stable and successful society. Increased cultural 
diversity can, therefore, only threaten national identity, perhaps leaving it fatally 
damaged. The basis for such thinking is the belief that human beings are drawn 
to others who are essentially similar to themselves, implying that a fear or distrust 
of strangers or foreigners is unavoidable. From this perspective, multiculturalism 
is inherently flawed: multicultural societies are inevitably fractured and conflict￾ridden societies, in which suspicion, hostility and even violence come to be accepted 
as facts of life.

Criticisms of multiculturalism nevertheless go well beyond the idea that cultural 
diversity is fundamentally incompatible with a clear sense of national identity. For 
example, multiculturalism has been condemned on the grounds that it serves to 
undermine inequality and legitimize illiberal or repressive cultural practices, such 
as female circumcision, forced marriage and the imposition of female dress codes 
(Barry 2002). As these practices tend disproportionately to affect women and girls, 
seemingly consigning them to a subordinate position in society, multiculturalism has 
been seen as the defence for patriarchy (see p. 72). Rather than balancing diversity 
against unity, multiculturalism may endorse diversity at the expense of unity. Finally, 
multiculturalism has been blamed for disadvantaging the very minority groups that, 
in theory, it exists to protect. Minority groups may pay a high price for their failure to 
integrate into the wider society in terms of socio-economic marginalization. It is not 
uncommon, therefore, for minority or immigrant groups to suffer from, for instance, 
low educational attainment, high unemployment, poor quality housing conditions 
and low-grade employment. One of the consequences these critiques has been 
increased interest in what is called ‘interculturalism’, seen as an updated version of 
multiculturalism, in which the presence of other cultures is not just passively accepted 
in society but embraced and engaged through ongoing dialogue and interaction.
Multiculturalism also has complex implications for the politics of identity. In a society 
where the dividing lines between cultures are clear, identity politics is a natural 
recourse, particularly in situations where one culture is at risk of being dominated 
by another. Yet in multicultural societies, the relationship between culture and 
politics is more variable. In Scotland, for instance, the Scottish National Party, which 
has dominated there in recent years, is organized primarily around the concept of 
the Scottish independence. For them, their Scottish identity outranks all others in 
political consideration. However, other parties, like the Scottish Conservative and 
Labour parties, while not denying a Scottish identity, are nonetheless organized 
around political ideology and non-cultural agendas. And some parties, like the 
Scottish Green party, are pro-independence, but see environmental issues, rather than 
the Scottish identity, as their primary concern. Yet even if not explicitly campaigning 
on identity, politicians may use all sorts of signals rooted in culture and identity. 
During the 2016 presidential election campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary 
Clinton, when asked on a black-hosted radio programme to name something she 
always had in her purse, responded ‘hot sauce’. Although her affinity for hot sauce is 
well documented, the move was roundly criticized as pandering to identity politics, 
as hot sauce is strongly associated with African American cuisine and culture.
Voters, too, will vary in the degree to which they will prioritize their cultural identity 
over other issues, though there can be significant social pressure to conform, 
particularly amongst minority communities. African Americans, for example, 
have in recent decades overwhelmingly been associated with Democratic and left￾wing politics. Black conservatives and Republicans, like former Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice, have faced criticism for serving with the ‘enemy’. The  result is 
that identity politics in multicultural societies does not always manifest in a clear-cut 
manner. While political parties may not be explicitly organized around a particular 
cultural identity, there may nonetheless be well-established patterns of political 
behaviour that are anchored in cultural norms.
CONCEPT
Interculturalism
Interculturalism is an 
approach to diversity 
which strongly 
emphasizes the 
benefits of dialogue and 
interaction between 
cultures. As such, it has 
been seen as a response 
to the question how 
to live in, rather than 
with, diversity. The 
intercultural approach 
is based on three key 
assumptions. First, it 
rejects the idea that 
cultures are fixed and 
unchanging, instead 
emphasizing that they 
are fluid and internally 
differentiated. Dialogue 
thus takes place within 
cultures as well as 
between them. Second, 
contest, debate and 
argument are seen to be 
intrinsically worthwhile, 
reflecting an underlying 
faith in reason. Third, 
cultures are taken to 
be distinguished more 
by what they have in 
common than by what 
divides them.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
BOLIVIA’S MOVEMENT FOR SOCIALISM: THE POLITICS OF IDENTITY
Although often talked about in isolation, the reality is that 
identity politics is not a specific type of politics only practised 
by some. Rather, identity infuses all politics, and even when it 
is not an overt aspect of a campaign, debate or movement, 
issues around identity are usually not far below the surface. 
Bolivia’s Movement for Socialism (MAS) provides a good 
contemporary example of how political movements often 
involve a complex balancing act between identity and ideology.
Founded by Evo Morales in 1998, the MAS was explicitly 
formed around two agendas – a socialist policy platform 
that was explicitly fighting for the rural peasantry and 
the poor, and an association with Bolivia’s indigenous 
population, historically under-represented in Bolivian 
politics. In many respects, these agendas overlapped in 
Bolivia – the indigenous population were predominantly 
poor and rural as well. Prior to the MAS, Morales had come 
to prominence as leader of the cocalero movement, which 
sought to protect the indigenous right to farm the coca 
plant, which the Bolivian government, under enormous 
pressure from the United States, was working to eradicate. 
While coca is the precursor to the drug cocaine, it has been 
used in far less harmful forms by the indigenous people of 
the Americas for millennia and plays a major role in many 
spiritual and customary rituals. Morales gained national 
attention by using coca prominently in his campaigns, even 
wearing wreaths made entirely of coca leaves, helping to 
establish it as a potent symbol of indigenous Bolivians.
The MAS gained significant traction throughout the early 
2000s campaigning on hot-button issues that highlighted 
the plight of the rural, the poor and the indigenous peoples 
in a Bolivian regime traditionally dominated by urban 
Bolivians of non-indigenous descent. Morales was one 
of the first mainstream Bolivian politicians to channel his 
indigenous identity. For instance, he deliberately avoided 
suits and often dressed in traditional rural clothing, and 
he frequently sported the Wiphala, a flag associated with 
pre-Columbian Andean culture. Yet critics pointed out 
that while Morales and his movement emphasized their 
indigenousness and contrasted it with mainstream ‘white’ 
Bolivian politics, the reality is that nearly 70 per cent of 
the Bolivian population is ‘mestizo’ – that is, is of mixed 
European and indigenous heritage. They argued that 
Morales was a populist who exploited identity politics in a 
way that was misleading and encouraged people to think 
more narrowly about their ethnic identity.
Millions of Bolivian voters did not see it this way, and Morales 
was swept into office in 2005, a watershed moment in 
Bolivian history. The Morales government introduced 
sweeping economic and social reforms, even seeking to 
recast the identity of Bolivia itself, by officially renaming it 
the ‘Plurinational State of Bolivia’ and having the Wiphala 
added as a second official flag. In power, the MAS has made 
huge inroads into significant social problems, dramatically 
reducing poverty rates while improving literacy, school 
access, health care and infrastructure.
Yet many decisions of the Morales government found 
the competing identities of the MAS in tension with 
each other. For instance, part of the new employment 
and prosperity created by the government involved 
controversial decisions, including building highways and 
allowing resource extraction in protected indigenous areas. 
And some indigenous activists were angered by Morales’ 
compromises with mainstream politicians and white 
Bolivian interests, which became more prominent over 
time as Morales sought to transition to a broader governing 
and electoral coalition. Though real progress was made 
during the MAS years for traditionally under-represented 
groups, the new era of identity politics has left a bitter 
legacy in Bolivia. After controversies in the conduct of the 
2019 election, in which Morales attempted to secure an 
unprecedented and constitutionally questionable fourth 
term as president, Morales was forcibly removed from 
office. Widespread protests and political violence have 
followed in the subsequent years, and though the MAS 
returned to power under a new leader in 2020, it has 
done little to diminish widespread mistrust and ill-feeling 
between different groups in Bolivian society.

Gender and identity
Feminism (discussed in Chapter 2) has traditionally been associated with – some 
would say defined by – the quest for gender equality, whether this means the 
achievement of equal rights (liberal feminism), social equality (socialist feminism) 
or equal personal power (radical feminism). In what may broadly be called 
equality feminism, difference implies oppression or subordination; it highlights 
legal, political, social and other advantages that men enjoy but which are denied to 
women. Women, in that sense, must be liberated from difference. Such thinking is 
based on the belief that human nature is basically androgynous. All human beings, 
regardless of their sex, possess the genetic inheritance of a mother and a father and 
therefore embody a blend of both female and male attributes and traits. Women and 
men should, therefore, be judged not by their sex, but as individuals, as ‘persons’. In 
this view, a very clear distinction is drawn between sex and gender. As Simone de 
Beauvoir put it, ‘Women are made, they are not born.’
However, although most feminists have regarded the sex/gender distinction as a 
source of empowerment, others have attacked it. These attacks have been launched 
from two main directions. The first, associated with so-called difference feminism, 
suggests that there are profound differences between women and men. From an 
‘essentialist’ perspective, accepted by some but by no means all difference feminists, 
social and cultural characteristics are seen to reflect deeper biological differences. 
The second attack on the sex/gender distinction challenges the categories 
themselves. Postmodern feminists have questioned whether sex is as clear-cut a 
biological distinction as is usually assumed. For example, the features of ‘biological 
womanhood’ do not apply to many who are classified as women: some women 
cannot bear children, some women are not sexually attracted to men and so on. If 
there is a biology–culture continuum rather than a fixed biological/cultural divide, 
the categories ‘female’ and ‘male’ become more or less arbitrary, and the concepts of 
sex and gender become hopelessly entangled.
Intersectionality
Since the 1990s, feminist discourse has moved beyond the campaigns and demands 
of the women’s movement in the 1960s and 1970s, with a range of new issues being 
addressed. However, if there is a unifying theme within contemporary feminism, it is 
a more radical engagement with the ‘politics of difference’. Instead of just emphasizing 
that women are different from men, greater attention has been given to differences 
between women. In so doing, contemporary feminists have tried to rectify an over￾emphasis in earlier forms of feminism on the aspirations and experiences of middle￾class, white women in developed societies, thereby illustrating the extent to which 
the contemporary women’s movement is characterized by diversity, hybridity and 
a greater awareness of intersectionality (see p. 211). This has allowed the voices of 
low-income women, women in the developing world and women of colour to be 
heard more effectively. Black feminism has been particularly effective in this respect, 
challenging the tendency within conventional forms of feminism to ignore racial 
differences on the assumption that women endure a common oppression by virtue 
of their sex. Especially strong in the USA, and developed in the writings of theorists 
such as bell hooks, black feminism portrays sexism and racism as linked systems of

CONCEPT
Gender
Gender refers to 
social and cultural 
distinctions between 
males and females (as 
opposed to ‘sex’ which 
highlights biological, and 
therefore ineradicable, 
differences between 
men and women). 
Gender is therefore a 
social construct, usually 
based on stereotypes of 
‘feminine’ and ‘masculine’ 
behaviour. Feminists 
typically emphasize 
the distinction in order 
to demonstrate that 
physical or biological 
differences (sexual 
differences) need not 
mean that women and 
men must have different 
social roles and positions 
(gender differences). In 
short, gender equality 
is based on the belief 
that sexual differences 
have no social or political 
significance.
Difference feminism:
A form of feminism 
that holds that there 
are deep and possibly 
ineradicable differences 
between women and men, 
whether these are rooted 
in biology, culture or 
material experience.

oppression, and highlights the particular and complex range of gender, racial and 
economic disadvantages that confront women of colour.
The concept of intersectionality helps makes sense of the role gender plays in 
political behaviour, insofar as gendered patterns of political support have been 
historically harder to establish in evidence than cultural or racially driven ones. 
There is little evidence, for example, that in elections women will cross party lines 
just to vote for a female candidate, and studies in several democratic nations have 
found that cultural, religious or racial identity is often a better predictor of how a 
person will vote than gender is. More than anything, this highlights that identity 
politics is further complicated by the fact that people have multiple identities that 
imply competing political interests. Moreover, some specific identities may be much 
more deeply felt than others – for some women, gender may play a leading role 
in how they define themselves, while for others, it may not be as relevant as their 
religion, culture or ideology.
KEY THINKER
SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR (1908–86)
French novelist, playwright and social critic. De Beauvoir’s work cast new light on 
the issue of gender politics and foreshadowed many of the ideas of later radical 
feminists. She rejected the idea that women can be understood either in terms of 
their biological function or in terms of the idea of the eternal feminine. In The Second 
Sex (1949), she developed a complex critique of patriarchal culture, in which the 
masculine is represented as the positive, or the norm, while the feminine is portrayed 
as the ‘other’. This fundamentally limits women’s freedom and denies them their 
true humanity. ‘Otherness’ thus explains the imbalances and inequalities that exist 
between men and women; while men are free and autonomous beings, women are 
merely man’s ‘other’.

BELL HOOKS (1952–2021)
American cultural critic, feminist and writer. Gloria Jean Watkins (better known by her pen 
name, bell hooks) emphasized that feminist theorizing must take account of intersectionality 
and be approached from the lenses of gender, race and social class. In her classic Ain’t I a 
Woman (1981), hooks examined the history of black women in the USA. Arguing that, in the 
USA, racism takes precedence over sexism, she advanced a powerful critique of the implicit 
racism of the mainstream women’s movement. This critique emphasized not only that the 
women’s movement had focused primarily on the concerns of white, college-educated and 
middle-/upper-class women, but also that it had portrayed feminism as a lifestyle choice rather 
than a political commitment.

Gender and trans theory
The emergence, during the second decade of the twenty-first century, of the trans 
movement (sometimes called the transgender movement) has thrown up challenging 
new thinking about gender. Although what is called ‘trans politics’ is not associated 
with a single or simple theory of gender, its defining theme is a rejection of the 
binary conception of gender, with a stress, instead, on gender and sexual ambiguity, 
sometimes based on the idea of a gender continuum. From the trans perspective, 
gender is not something attributed to individuals by society, or something that is 
imposed on them by cultural stereotypes. Instead, gender is fundamentally a matter 
of self-definition and, as such, is based on inner feelings. In this vein, Judith Butler 
(see p. 212) advanced a theory of gender that emphasizes the crucial role of social 
performance.
Such thinking has nevertheless been viewed as deeply problematic by traditional 
feminists, not least because of the importance they placed on culturally defined 
gender in explaining the oppression of women. Over time there has been greater 
willingness by some feminists to take on board issues raised by the trans movement, 
while supporters of trans politics have increasingly recognized the extent to which its 
thinking may be applicable to all women, demonstrating a growing awareness of the 
parallels and overlaps that exist between sexism and transphobia. Notwithstanding, 
feminist support for transgender issues remains extremely varied, particularly 
between generations, insofar as gender identity is seen as much more rooted in sex 
by older feminists than younger ones.
The issue of trans identity and its association with feminism highlights what has 
always been a thorny issue of the politics of identity, as the boundaries of what 
constitutes an identity is not fixed or even necessarily clear. Thus, the politics of 
identity does not just entail debate between groups but within them as well. Debates 
over who is entitled to claim an identity have not been confined to feminism. 
Indigenous groups around the world, for instance, have struggled to define who 
can legitimately claim indigenous identity, particularly as those identities may be 
connected special rights, political representation or material benefit.
Religion and politics
The impact of religion on political life had been progressively restricted by the spread 
of liberal culture and ideas, a process that has been particularly prominent in the 
industrialized West. Nevertheless, liberal secularism is by no means an anti-religious 
tendency. Rather, it is concerned to establish a ‘proper’ sphere and role for religion. 
Emphasizing the importance of the public/private divide, it has sought to confine 
religion to a private arena, leaving public life to be organized on a strictly secular 
basis. However, the emergence of new, and often more assertive, forms of religiosity, 
the increasing impact of religious movements and, most importantly, a closer 
relationship between religion and politics, especially since the 1970s, has confounded 
the so-called ‘secularization thesis’ (see p. 212).
This was dramatically demonstrated by the 1979 ‘Islamic Revolution’ in Iran, which 
brought the Ayatollah Khomeini (see p. 213) to power as the leader of the world’s 
CONCEPT
Intersectionality
Intersectionality, 
first articulated 
by legal scholar 
Kimberlé Crenshaw, 
is a framework for the 
analysis of injustice 
and social equality 
that emphasizes the 
multidimensional or 
multifaceted nature 
of personal identity 
and of related systems 
of domination. In this 
view, women do not just 
have a straightforward 
gender-based identity 
but rather one in which, 
for instance, race, social 
class, ethnicity, age, 
religion, nationality and 
sexual orientation can 
overlap, or ‘intersect’, 
with gender. This implies 
that women may be 
subject to interlocking 
systems of oppression 
and discrimination, 
as sexism becomes 
entangled with 
racism, xenophobia, 
homophobia and so on.
Transgender: A term 
denoting or relating 
to people who do not 
conform to prevailing 
expectations about 
gender, usually by crossing 
over or moving between

Secularism: The belief 
that religion should not 
intrude into secular 
(worldly) affairs, usually 
reflected in the desire to 
separate the state from 
institutionalized religion.

KEY THINKER
JUDITH BUTLER (BORN 1956)
US philosopher and gender theorist. Butler has challenged currents in feminist thinking that 
unwittingly enforce a binary view of gender identity, in which human beings are divided into 
two clear-cut groups: women and men. She rejects, in particular, the idea that the sex/gender 
divide reflects an underpinning nature/culture divide, arguing instead that gender encompasses 
the discursive and cultural means whereby ‘sexed nature’, or ‘a natural sex’, is produced. Butler 
thus contends that not only gender but sex itself – the fact of being biologically male or female 
– is, at least to some extent, a ‘performative’ social construct; that is, it is constituted by action 
and speech. Butler’s most influential work is Gender Trouble (1990).

first Islamic state. Nevertheless, it soon became clear that this was not an exclusively 
Islamic development, as fundamentalist movements emerged within Christianity, 
particularly in the form of the so-called ‘new Christian Right’ in the USA, and within 
Hinduism and Sikhism in India (religious fundamentalism is examined in Chapter
2). Other manifestations of this include the spread of US-style Pentecostalism in 
Latin America, Africa and East Asia; the growth in China of Falun Gong, a spiritual 
movement that has been taken by the authorities to express anti-communism; the 
regeneration of Orthodox Christianity in post-communist Russia; and growing 
interest across Western societies in myriad forms of Eastern mysticism, and spiritual 
and therapeutic systems (yoga, meditation, Pilates, Shiatsu and so forth).
Although religious revivalism can be seen as a consequence of the larger upsurge in 
identity politics, religion has proved to be a particularly potent means of regenerating 
personal and social identity in modern circumstances. As modern societies are 
increasingly atomistic, diffuse and pluralized, there is, arguably, a greater thirst for 
the sense of meaning, purpose and certainty that religious consciousness appears to 
offer. This applies because religion provides believers with a worldview and moral 
vision that has higher, or indeed supreme, authority, as it stems from a supposedly 
divine source. Religion thus defines the very grounds of people’s being; it gives them 
an ultimate frame of reference, as well as a moral orientation in a world increasingly 
marked by moral relativism. In addition, religion generates a powerful sense of social 
solidarity, connecting people to one another at a ‘thick’ or deep level, as opposed to 
the ‘thin’ connectedness that is conventional in modern societies.
Islamism
The link between religion and politics has been clearest in relation to Islam, where 
it has been reflected in an upsurge in Islamic fundamentalism, often termed 
‘Islamism’. Fundamentalism in Islam does not imply a belief in the literal truth of 
the Koran, for this is accepted by all Muslims and, in that sense, all Muslims are

fundamentalists. Instead, it means an intense and militant faith in Islamic beliefs as 
the overriding principles of social life and politics, as well as of personal morality. 
Islamic fundamentalists wish to establish the primacy of religion over politics. In 
practice, this means the founding of an ‘Islamic state’, a theocracy, ruled by spiritual 
rather than temporal authority, and applying the Shari’a. The Shari’a lays down a 
code for legal and religious behaviour, including a system of punishment for most 
crimes, as well as rules of personal conduct for both men and women.
However, Islam should be distinguished from Islamism. Islamism refers either to a 
political creed based on Islamic ideas and principles, or to the political movement 
that has been inspired by that creed. It has three core aims. First, it promotes pan￾Islamic unity, distinguishing Islamism from traditional political nationalism. Second, 
it seeks the purification of the Islamic world through the overthrow of ‘apostate’ 
leaders of Muslim states (secularized or pro-Western leaders). Third, it calls for 
the removal of Western, and especially US, influence from the Muslim world, and 
possibly a wider politico-cultural struggle against the West itself (Barber 1995). The 
rise of Islamism has sometimes been interpreted as evidence of an emerging ‘clash 
of civilizations’ (see p. 477) between Islam and the West, a notion that has profound 
implications for both global politics and for Western societies which have significant 
Muslim communities (Tibi 2012).
Regardless of the form it takes, there is no doubt that identity politics in its various 
guises has fundamentally reshaped politics over the past half-century, and in 
turn, reshaped society as well. Many identities once hidden from public view, like 
homosexuality and indigeneity, are now very much part of mainstream politics in 
many societies, which has in turn influenced the political agenda and expanded civil 
rights, protections and affirmative action policies to traditionally disadvantaged 
groups. While the politics of identity has not displaced ideological politics, it has 
(for better or worse) created new political cleavages, articulated new agendas and 
placed greater emphasis on the expression of the individual in politics.
KEY THINKER
AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI (1900–89)
Iranian cleric and political leader. Khomeini was one of the foremost scholars in the major 
theological centre of Qom until he was expelled from Iran in 1964. His return from exile in 
1979 sparked the ‘Islamic Revolution’, leaving the Ayatollah (literally, ‘gift of Allah’) as the 
supreme leader of the world’s first Islamic state until his death. Breaking decisively with the 
Shi’a tradition that the clergy remain outside politics, Khomeini’s worldview was rooted in a clear 
division between the oppressed (understood largely as the poor and excluded of the developing 
world) and the oppressors (seen as the twin Satans: the USA and the USSR, capitalism and 
communism). Islam thus became a theo-political project aimed at regenerating the Islamic 
world by ridding it of occupation and corruption from outside.

CONCEPT
Islamism
Islamism (also called 
‘political Islam’ or ‘radical 
Islam’) is a politico￾religious ideology, as 
opposed to a simple 
belief in Islam. Although 
Islamist ideology has no 
single creed or political 
manifestation, certain 
common beliefs can be 
identified, as follows. 
(1) Society should be 
reconstructed in line 
with the ideals of Islam. 
(2) The modern secular 
state should be replaced 
by an ‘Islamic state’. (3) 
The West and Western 
values are viewed as 
corrupt and corrupting, 
justifying, for some, the 
notion of a jihad against 
them. However, distinct 
Sunni and Shi’a versions 
of Islamism have been 
developed, the former 
linked to Wahhabism, 
the latter to Iran’s 
‘Islamic Revolution’.

CHAPTER 9
POLITICAL CULTURE 
AND THE MEDIA
KEY ISSUES
 How do individuals and groups acquire their political attitudes and values?
 Do democratic regimes depend on the existence of a distinctive ‘civic culture’?
 How has the relationship between politics and the media been understood?
 Has the use of social media revolutionized the media’s political role?
 Do we now live in a ‘post-truth’ world?
PREVIEW
Politics is about perception as much as it is about reality. What we believe about to be true about our government 
and society may be more important than the reality of its power structure, and the actual distribution of resources 
and opportunities within it. Perception may not only be more important than reality; in practical terms, perception 
may be reality. This highlights the vital role played by what is called ‘political culture’. People’s beliefs, traditions and 
values structure both their attitude to the political process and, crucially, their view of the regime in which they live.
The issue of the political culture also draws attention to the extent to which the politics of modern societies 
is conducted through the media in its various forms. The media constitute much more than a channel of 
communications; they are part of the political process, affecting, and not merely reflecting, the distribution 
of power in society at large. As such, it has long been accepted that print and broadcast media (newspapers, 
magazines, television, radio and so on) have a major impact – for good or ill – on politics. However, the advent of 
electronic-based digital media, and especially the increasing incorporation of social media into everyday life, has 
transformed the role of the media in shaping political discourse. With such change have come concerns about 
foreign and corporate influence on domestic politics, and questions about the implications of the spread of ‘fake 
news’ and the increasingly partisan nature of media consumption by the public.

POLITICAL CULTURE
Political thinkers through the ages have acknowledged the importance of attitudes, 
values and beliefs. However, these past thinkers did not see them as part of a ‘political 
culture’. Burke (see p. 37), for instance, wrote about custom and tradition, Marx (see 
p. 43) about ideology and Herder (see p. 147) about national spirit. All of them, 
nevertheless, agreed on the vital role that values and beliefs play in promoting the 
stability and survival of a regime.
Political scientists began to study the idea of political culture more systematically 
in the 1950s and 1960s, as new techniques of behavioural analysis displaced more 
traditional approaches to the subject. The classic work in this respect was Gabriel 
Almond and Sidney Verba’s The Civic Culture (1963), which used opinion surveys 
to analyse political attitudes towards democracy in five countries: the USA, the UK, 
West Germany, Italy and Mexico. This work was stimulated, in part, by a desire to 
explain the collapse of representative government in interwar Italy, Germany and 
elsewhere, and the failure of democracy in many newly independent developing 
states after 1945. Although interest in political culture faded in the 1970s and 1980s, 
the debate has been revitalized since the 1990s because of efforts in Eastern Europe 
to construct democracy out of the ashes of communism, growing anxiety in mature 
democracies about the apparent decline of social capital (see pp. 198–199) and 
the advent of culture wars. However, there is also a growing debate as to whether 
political culture is shaped, or distorted, by the ideas and interests of elite groups. 
This, in turn, is linked to rival views of the mass media (see p. 226) and the extent 
to which governments, interest groups or corporations can now manipulate political 
communication, considered later in the chapter.
Approaches to political culture
The civic-culture approach
Debate about the nature of political culture has often focused on the idea of ‘civic 
culture’, usually associated with the writings of Almond and Verba (1963, 1980). 
They set out to identify the political culture that most effectively upheld democratic 
politics. They identified three general types of political culture:
 A participant political culture. This is one in which citizens pay close attention to 
politics, and regard popular participation in government as both desirable and 
effective.
 A subject political culture. This is characterized by more passivity amongst citizens, 
and the belief that they have only a very limited capacity to influence government.
 A parochial political culture. This is marked by the absence of a sense of citizenship, 
with people identifying with their locality, rather than the nation, and having 
neither the desire nor the ability to participate in politics.
Although Almond and Verba accepted that a participant culture came closest to the 
democratic ideal, they argued that the most describable ‘civic culture’ is a blend of all 
three, in that it reconciles the participation of citizens in the political process with 
the need for the public to broadly accept the authority of government in order for it 
to govern effectively. Democratic stability, in their view, is underpinned by a political 
Culture war: A political 
battle over values and 
lifestyles usually reflecting 
the tension between 
social conservatism 
(traditionalism) and social 
liberalism (progressivism).
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 216 23-07-2024 12:47:12POLITICAL CULTURE AND THE MEDIA 217
culture that is characterized by a blend of activity and passivity on the part of citizens, 
and a balance between obligation and performance on the part of government.
In their initial study (1963), Almond and Verba concluded that the UK came closest 
to a civic culture, exhibiting both participant and subject features. In other words, 
while the British thought that they could influence government, they were also 
willing to obey authority. The USA also scored highly, its relative weakness being 
that, as participant attitudes predominated over subject ones, Americans were not 
as willing to conform to authority. The difficulty of building or rebuilding a civic 
culture was underlined by the examples of both West Germany and Italy. By the 
early 1960s, neither country appeared to have a strong participant culture; while 
the subject culture was dominant in Germany, parochial attitudes remained firmly 
entrenched in Italy. Almond and Verba’s later study (1980) highlighted a number of 
shifts, notably declining national pride in the UK and the USA, which contrasted 
with a rise in civic propensities in West Germany, suggesting that political cultures 
do change.
The civic-culture approach to the study of political attitudes and values has, however, 
been widely criticized. In the first place, its model of the psychological dispositions 
that make for a stable democracy is highly questionable. In particular, the emphasis 
on passivity and the recognition that deference to authority is healthy has been 
criticized by those who argue that vigorous political participation is the very stuff 
of democratic government. Almond and Verba suggested, for instance, that low 
democratic participation indicates broad satisfaction with government, which 
politicians, in turn, will be anxious to maintain. Yet when less than half of the adult 
population bothers to vote, as increasingly occurs in some established democracies, 
this could simply reflect widespread alienation and ingrained disadvantage.
Second, the civic-culture thesis rests on the unproven assumption that political 
attitudes shape political behaviour, and not the other way round. In short, a civic 
culture may be more a consequence of democracy than its cause. If this is the case, 
political culture may provide an index of the health of democracy, but it cannot be 
seen as a means of promoting stable democratic rule. Finally, Almond and Verba’s 
approach tends to treat political culture as homogeneous; that is, as little more 
than a cipher for national character. In so doing, it pays little attention to political 
subcultures and tends to disguise fragmentation and social conflict.
In contrast, other approaches to political culture tend to highlight the significance 
of social divisions, such as those based on class, race and gender, which may view 
and interact with politics differently, perhaps radically differently, to mainstream 
society (see Chapter 8). Graham Little in Political Ensembles (1985) argued 
that political culture may even vary between people based on personalities and 
psycho-social needs. Some people, Little argues, even in thriving and healthy 
democracies, may have personality traits or personal histories that lead them to 
desire strong leaders and a subject-style political culture that emphasizes order 
and certainty. Yet others in that same society may completely reject this style of 
politics and seek out parties and leaders that are more inclusive, considered and 
group-oriented (Little 1985).
CONCEPT
Political culture
Culture, in its broadest 
sense, is the way of life 
of a people. Sociologists 
and anthropologists 
tend to distinguish 
between ‘culture’ and 
‘nature’, the former 
encompassing that 
which is passed on from 
one generation to the 
next by learning, rather 
than through biological 
inheritance. Political 
scientists, however, use 
the term in a narrower 
sense to refer to a 
people’s psychological 
orientation, political 
culture being the 
‘pattern of orientations’ 
to political objects such 
as parties, government 
and the constitution, 
expressed in beliefs, 
symbols and values.

The Marxist approach
A very different view of the role and nature of political culture has been developed 
within the Marxist tradition. Although Marx portrayed capitalism as a system of 
class exploitation and oppression operating through the ownership of the means of 
production, he also acknowledged the power of ideas, values and beliefs. Subsequently, 
Marxists argue two theories of culture. The first suggests that culture is essentially 
class-specific: as members of a class share the same experiences and have a common 
economic position and interests, they are likely to have broadly similar ideas, values 
and beliefs. Proletarian culture and ideas can therefore be expected to differ markedly 
from bourgeois ones. The second theory of culture emphasizes the degree to which 
the ideas of the ruling class pervade society and become the ideas of mainstream 
politics. As Marx and Engels put it in The German Ideology (1846), ‘the ideas of the 
ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas’. In this view, political culture, or 
even civic culture, is thus nothing more than bourgeois ideology. What is important 
about this view is that it sees culture, values and beliefs as a form of power. From the 
Marxist perspective, the function of ideology is to reconcile subordinate classes to 
their exploitation and oppression by propagating myths, delusions, distortions and 
falsehoods – what can be termed ‘false consciousness’.
Modern Marxists have been quick to acknowledge that in no sense do the ‘ruling 
ideas’ of the bourgeoisie monopolize intellectual and cultural life in a capitalist 
society, excluding all rival views. Rather, they accept that cultural, ideological and 
political competition does exist, but stress that this competition is unequal. Quite 
simply, ideas and values that uphold the capitalist order have an overwhelming 
advantage over ideas and values that question or challenge it. Such ideological 
hegemony may, in fact, be successful precisely because it operates behind the illusion 
of free speech, open competition and political pluralism – what Herbert Marcuse 
(see p. 45) termed ‘repressive tolerance’.
The most influential twentieth-century exponent of this view was Antonio Gramsci. 
Gramsci drew attention to the degree to which the class system is upheld not simply 
by unequal economic and political power but also by bourgeois hegemony. This 
consists of the spiritual and cultural supremacy of the ruling class, brought about 
through the spread of bourgeois values and beliefs via civil society, the mass media, 
the churches, youth movements, trade unions and so forth. What makes this process 
so insidious is that it extends beyond formal learning and education into the very 
common sense of the age. The significance of Gramsci’s analysis is that, for socialism 
to be achieved, a ‘battle of ideas’ has to be waged through which proletarian 
principles, values and theories displace, or at least challenge, bourgeois ideas.
The Marxist view of culture draws attention to what Stephen Lukes (1974) called a 
‘radical view of power’ (see p. 10). John Gaventa in Power and Powerlessness (1980) 
studied a mining valley in America’s Appalachia region where despite the presence 
of great mineral wealth, its workers and local residents were generally poor, and 
disability, health problems and malnutrition were common. Yet its local political 
culture was seemingly one of acquiescence, with local residents generally supporting 
conservative, pro-business politicians and rarely agitating for political change. The 
implication of cases like this is a much debated one – to what degree are our perceived 
Bourgeois ideology: A 
Marxist term, denoting 
ideas and theories that 
serve the interests of the 
bourgeoisie by disguising 
the contradictions of 
capitalist society.
CONCEPT
Hegemony
Hegemony (from the 
Greek hegemonia, 
meaning ‘leader’) is, 
in its simplest sense, 
the ascendancy or 
domination of one 
element of a system 
over others. In Marxist 
theory, the term is 
used in a more specific 
sense. In the writings of 
Gramsci (see p. 219),
hegemony refers to the 
ability of a dominant 
class to exercise power 
by winning the consent 
of those it subjugates, as 
an alternative to the use 
of coercion. As a non￾coercive form of class 
rule, hegemony typically 
operates through 
the dissemination of 
bourgeois values and 
beliefs throughout 
society.

interests shaped, even manipulated, by the dominant political culture or interests? 
Can we be brainwashed into misunderstanding where our true interests lie?
Some have argued that it is unwarrantedly patronizing to suggest that the values 
and beliefs of ordinary people have been foisted upon them by manipulation and 
indoctrination. The acceptance of capitalist values and beliefs by the working classes 
may, for instance, merely reflect their perception that capitalism works. And while 
a ‘ruling’ ideology may provide a dominant class with self-belief and a sense of 
purpose, it is less clear, as Abercrombie et al. (1980) argued, that subordinate classes 
have been successfully integrated into this value system. There is tendency found 
in all societies for powerful groups to propagate self-serving ideas. Whether this 
constitutes a dominant value system, in which a coherent and consistent message 
is disseminated through the media, schools, the churches and so on, is rather more 
questionable.
KEY THINKER
ANTONIO GRAMSCI (1891–1937)
Italian Marxist and social theorist. The son of a minor public official, Gramsci joined the 
Socialist Party in 1913, and in 1921 became the General Secretary of the newly formed Italian 
Communist Party. Although an elected member of parliament, he was imprisoned by Mussolini 
in 1926. He remained in prison until his death. His Prison Notebooks, written in 1929–35, 
tried to counterbalance the emphasis within orthodox Marxism on ‘scientific’ determinism 
by stressing the importance of the political and intellectual struggle. Although proponents of 
Eurocommunism have claimed him as an influence, he remained throughout his life a Leninist 
and a revolutionary.

The conservative approach
Conservative thinkers have long supported their own view of political culture in 
the form of tradition (see p. 87) and, in particular, ‘traditional values’. These are 
values and beliefs that have supposedly been passed down from earlier generations 
and so constitute a kind of cultural bedrock. Conservative politicians regularly call 
for such values to be strengthened or defended, believing that they are the key to 
social cohesion and political stability. Not uncommonly, such values are linked to 
the family, the church and the nation; that is, to long-established institutions that 
supposedly embody the virtues of continuity and endurance.
In his essay ‘Rationalism in Politics’, Michael Oakeshott (1962) argued that 
traditional values and established customs should be upheld and respected on 
account of their familiarity, which engenders a sense of reassurance, stability and 
security. This suggests that there is a general human disposition to favour tradition 
over innovation, the established over the new. To be a conservative, Oakeshott 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 219 23-07-2024 12:47:13220 POLITICS
suggested, is ‘to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, 
fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbound, the near to the 
distant, the sufficient to the super abundant, the convenient to the perfect, present 
laughter to utopian bliss’ (Oakeshott 1962). The defence of traditional values and 
established beliefs has been one of the central themes of neoconservatism, advanced 
in the USA by social theorists such as Daniel Bell (1976) and Irving Kristol (1983), 
who have warned against the destruction of spiritual values brought about both by 
market pressures and by the spread of permissiveness.
The problem with this position, however, is that it assumes there is an authoritative 
moral system upon which order and stability can be based. The simple fact is that, 
in modern multicultural and multi-religious societies, it is doubtful whether any set 
of values can be regarded as authoritative. To define certain values as ‘traditional’, 
‘established’ or ‘majority’ values may simply be an attempt to impose a particular 
moral system on the rest of society. Indeed, empirical evidence appears to support 
the view that political culture is becoming increasingly fragmented, and that modern 
societies are characterized by growing moral and cultural diversity (as discussed in 
Chapter 8).
KEY THINKER
MICHAEL OAKESHOTT (1901–90)
UK political philosopher. Oakeshott was a professor of political science at the London School 
of Economics from 1951 until his retirement in 1968. His collection of essays Rationalism in 
Politics and Other Essays (1962) and his more systematic work of political philosophy, On 
Human Conduct (1975), are often seen as major contributions to conservative traditionalism. 
By highlighting the importance of civil association and insisting on the limited province of 
politics, he also developed themes closely associated with liberal thought. Though often seen 
as an advocate of a non-ideological style of politics, in line with the ideas of Edmund Burke (see 
p. 37), Oakeshott influenced many of the thinkers of the New Right.

Political culture in crisis
Decline of social capital?
The process of political and economic reconstruction in former communist states has 
stimulated renewed interest in the issue of political culture since the 1990s. This is 
because pervasive state control over several generations had arguably suppressed the 
social connections and sense of civic responsibility that usually sustain democratic 
politics. In other words, there was a perceived need to rebuild civil society, in the sense 
of a realm of autonomous groups and associations, including businesses, interest 
groups, clubs and so on. Indeed, such ideas can be traced back to Alexis de Tocqueville 
(see p. 299), who, in the nineteenth century, had explained the USA’s egalitarian 
institutions and democratic practices by reference to the American’s propensity for 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 220 23-07-2024 12:47:13POLITICAL CULTURE AND THE MEDIA 221
participation and civic association (Tocqueville 1835). No sooner had this revived 
concern with political culture arisen in relation to post-communist states than it was 
being applied to perceived problems in mature democracies. Robert Putnam (see 
p. 198), for example, argued that variations in the quality of local government in 
different regions of Italy were determined by the presence, or absence, of traditions of 
civic engagement, reflected in differing levels of voter turnout, newspaper readership 
and membership of choral societies and football clubs (Putnam 1993).
An alternative view of the social capital debate suggests not that there has been a 
decline of civic engagement or social connectedness, but that the forms these have 
taken have changed. According to Ronald Inglehart (1977, 1990), such shifts are 
linked to the spread of affluence and to the growth, particularly amongst young 
people, of ‘postmaterial’ values. As new generations have grown up since the 1960s 
accustomed, in advanced industrial countries at least, to economic security and 
material well-being, ‘traditional’ ideas about subjects such as sex, marriage and 
personal conduct have been displaced by more ‘liberal’ or ‘permissive’ attitudes. At 
the same time, traditional political attitudes and allegiances have been weakened 
and sometimes replaced by growing interest in issues such as feminism, nuclear 
disarmament, animal rights and environmental protection. Thus, party membership 
and electoral turnout may have declined but there has been a growth of interest 
in single-issue protest politics and campaigning groups. Other theorists argue that 
such cultural changes are irresistible because they are linked to a wholesale shift in 
economic and political organization that is bringing about a decline in deference 
and a rise of individualism (see p. 197).
Culture wars
Concerns about the health of the political culture are not restricted to the fear 
that social capital is being undermined by the trend towards individualization. An 
additional source of disquiet has focused on the tendency, particularly in mature 
democracies, towards political polarization. In a polarized society, compromise and 
consensus politics are generally displaced by antagonism, brinkmanship and even 
hatred. Although this development has been fuelled in many Western societies by 
a combination of stagnant (or sometimes declining) living standards and rising 
inequality, it reflects a general shift in the political focus of such societies from the 
economy to culture. Whereas the dominant tendency since the 1980s has been for 
economic choices to get narrower, boiling down to a choice between some version 
of market economics, cultural choices are typically starker and offer less scope for 
compromise. This is because they deal with who we are and how we define ourselves. 
People’s views on issues like abortion, gay marriage, gun rights and crime tend to be 
more entrenched and rooted in deeply held religious or ideological beliefs, and often 
speak to questions of identity. Thus political battles around these issues will almost 
inevitably be more polarized and passionate than would be the case on economic or 
foreign policy (Klein 2021).
Culture wars have gained their greatest impetus from the advance of globalization 
(see p. 182) and the various changes it has set in motion. This has been particularly 
evident in the upsurge in populism (see p. 56) in the USA and across much of 
CONCEPT
Postmaterialism
Postmaterialism is a 
theory that explains 
the nature of political 
concerns and values 
in terms of levels of 
economic development. 
It is loosely based on 
Abraham Maslow’s 
(1908–70) ‘hierarchy 
of needs’, which places 
esteem and self￾actualization above 
material or economic 
needs. Postmaterialism 
assumes that conditions 
of material scarcity 
breed egoistical and 
acquisitive values, 
meaning that politics is 
dominated by economic 
issues. However, in 
conditions of widespread 
prosperity, individuals 
express more interest in 
‘postmaterial’ or ‘quality 
of life’ issues, typically 
concerned with morality, 
political justice and 
personal fulfilment.

Europe that occurred in response to the Great Recession, which came in the wake 
of 2007–9 global crisis, and the onset of the European migration crisis in 2015. In 
this light, it is sometimes argued that politics has come to be better understood 
less in terms of the essentially economic left/right divide, and more in terms of the 
culturally based ‘open/closed’ divide. People with ‘open’ political attitudes generally 
favour globalization, are tolerant or welcoming of cultural diversity, sympathize 
with an inclusive view of national identity and typically support liberal social norms 
and values. By contrast, people with ‘closed’ attitudes are suspicious of, or oppose, 
globalization, fear cultural diversity, are drawn to an exclusive view of national 
identity and usually support conservative social norms and values. These contrasting 
attitudes tend to have implications for a preferred political culture as well – open 
political attitudes by their nature are more attuned to participant political cultures, 
open governments and process-oriented political leaders; while closed political 
attitudes tend to seek stronger, outcome-focused leaders who will protect traditional 
values and act decisively against outside ‘threats’ (Johnston et al. 2017).
Poland, for example, has been mired in what many observers have described a 
culture war since the collapse of the communist regime in 1990, but has become far 
more acute since the Law and Justice Party took power in 2015. Geographically split 
between a more open, globally oriented West and a more conservative, tradition￾oriented East, Poland’s closely divided population has struggled to unite over cultural 
flashpoints like LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, immigration and environmentalism. The 
Law and Justice Party itself has opposed liberal, participant democracy, seeing it as 
a foreign concept, and has pursued a style of soft authoritarianism that has been 
popular with its supporters but deeply concerning in the broader international and 
European community.
One of the challenges of studying, and understanding, political culture is that it is 
often deeply emotive and personal, and thus can motivate political behaviour very 
powerfully in ways that ordinary political issues cannot. For instance, strength of 
the open/closed cultural divide was demonstrated by the 2016 Brexit referendum 
in the UK, and the deep and abiding antagonism that surfaced between so-called 
‘Remainers’ and so-called ‘Leavers’. Although nominally the referendum campaign 
was centred on policy issues regarding trade and immigration with the European 
Union, as Campanella and Dassù (2019) argue, many in the ‘Leave’ camp were more 
meaningfully driven by strong feelings of political nostalgia, an idealization of the 
British past, and an emotive nationalism that trumped rational argument. In the 
analysis of Goodhart (2017), the division was also socio-economic, between people 
who have portable ‘achieved’ identities based on educational and career success, 
making them comfortable and confident with new places and people, and thus 
likely to support the remain camp, versus those who have not benefited from the 
globalized economy to the same degree, are more rooted in a geographical identity, 
and who find the rapid changes of the modern world unsettling.
All of this suggests that political culture is a highly complex phenomenon. While 
countries, as Almond and Verba argued, may exhibit broad characteristics that 
are suggestive of a national political culture, there is undoubtedly a great deal of 
heterogeneity and diversity within a population, and sometimes deep and abiding 
cultural divides within communities as well.

THE MEDIA AND POLITICS
Any examination of the factors that influence people’s psychological orientation to 
politics, whether their long-term beliefs and values (political culture) or their short￾term reaction to particular policies or problems (public opinion), must, in modern 
circumstances, take account of the crucial role played by the media. Political media is 
nothing new – on Mount Behistun in Iran you can find a royal inscription from the 
Persian king Darius the Great dating from the sixth century bce. In various languages 
the inscriptions proclaim Darius’ divine right to rule and the vast territories over 
which he presides. In the ensuing millennia, however, new technologies and social 
changes have allowed the media to reach ever more people at an ever-faster pace, 
with several highly significant implications for politics.
The first is the greatly expanded potential reach of political communication. 
Beginning with radio in the 1920s, then television in the 1950s, the internet in 
the 1990s and social media services like Facebook and Twitter in the 2000s, new 
technologies have allowed political communication to reach progressively wider 
audiences. In 2023, it is estimated that nearly 2 billion households worldwide have 
at least one television, and more than two-thirds of the planet have access to the 
internet (ITU 2023). The public now has access to, and relies on, the media more 
heavily than ever before.
The second regards the relationship between politicians and the public. With 
every advance in information technology, not only has the reach of the political 
class into the minds and ears of the public expanded, but so too has its ability to 
Pro-European Union and pro-Brexit campaigners debate the merits of the United 
Kingdom’s exit from the European Union in 2019. Despite voting to leave in 2016, a 
cultural and political divide has remained between ‘remainers’ and ‘leavers’ amongst 
the British population.

directly interact with them. During the eighteenth century, kings and presidents 
were distant figures, glimpsed only through stylized portraits or speeches reprinted 
(or sensationalized) by the newspapers, but almost never seen or heard directly by 
the vast majority of the public. Yet with the invention of radio, within a generation 
everyone could hear their politicians speak directly. With television they could see 
them too. And in the age of social media, they can even interact with them on a near 
instantaneous basis. The implications for how people interact with politics, how 
politicians communicate and campaign and how political ideas are disseminated 
have been profound.
These first two changes have caused a third, insofar as the so-called ‘primary’ agents 
of political socialization, such as the family and social class, have declined at the 
expense of the broader media landscape. Traditionally people acquired, in late 
childhood and adolescence in particular, a framework of political sympathies and 
leanings from their immediate families, church, school and local community that 
adult experience tended to modify or deepen, but seldom radically transformed. 
But this has been weakened in modern society by greater social and geographical 
mobility, and by the spread of individualist and consumerist values. This, in turn, 
widens the scope for the media’s political influence, as they are the principal 
mechanism through which information about issues and policies, and therefore 
political choices, are presented to the public. The result, some have argued, is 
dealignment, where citizens in many political systems have become less likely to 
strongly identify with particular parties or political ideologies, and where class 
and background are less likely to predict a person’s political persuasions as they 
traditionally would have (Dalton and Flanagan 2017).
Nevertheless, the relationship between the media and politics continues to be 
surrounded by debate and disagreement. These debates focus, not least, on the 
nature of the political biases that operate within the traditional or mass media (see p.
226), and the extent to which the way that political processes have come to be shaped 
or framed by the media has changed due to the shift in usage from traditional media 
to digital media, and especially social media. While it is certainly true that the media 
plays a profound role in shaping contemporary political discourse and culture, the 
degree to which that has changed with new technology, and whether this has had 
a positive or negative effect on political culture and politics in general, is less clear.
Theories of the media
Few commentators doubt the media’s ability to shape political attitudes and values or, 
at least, to structure political and electoral choice by influencing public perceptions 
about the nature and importance of issues and problems, thereby. However, there is 
considerable debate about the political significance of this influence. A series of rival 
theories offer contrasting views of the media’s political impact. The most important 
of these are the following:
 the pluralist model
 the dominant-ideology model
 the elite-values model
 the market model.
Social media: Forms of 
electronic communication 
that facilitate social 
interaction and the 
formation of online 
communities through 
the exchange of user￾generated content.
Dealignment: A trend 
in which an increasing 
proportion of the 
electorate no longer adopt 
stable or predictable 
partisan, party or 
ideological affiliations.
CONCEPT
Political 
socialization
Political socialization 
is the process through 
which individuals acquire 
political beliefs and 
values, and by which 
these are transmitted 
from one generation 
to the next. Families 
and schools are usually 
viewed as ‘primary’ 
agents of political 
socialization, while the 
workplace, peer groups 
and the media are 
viewed as ‘secondary’ 
agents of political 
socialization. Interest 
in political socialization 
peaked during the 
so-called ‘behavioural 
revolution’, as external 
stimuli were seen to 
explain (and possibly 
determine) political 
attitudes or behaviour.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 224 23-07-2024 12:47:13POLITICAL CULTURE AND THE MEDIA 225
Pluralist model
Pluralism (see p. 109) highlights diversity and multiplicity generally. The pluralist 
model of the mass media portrays the media as an ideological marketplace in which a 
wide range of political views are debated and discussed. While not rejecting the idea 
that the media can affect political views and sympathies, sometimes dramatically, 
this nevertheless suggests that their impact is essentially neutral, in that they tend to 
reflect the balance of forces within society at large.
The pluralist view, nevertheless, portrays the media in strongly positive terms. In 
ensuring an ‘informed citizenry’, mass media both enhances the quality of democracy 
and guarantees that government power is checked. Investigative journalism in 
particular has played a notable role since the nineteenth century in exposing political 
corruption and criminality to the broader public. This ‘watchdog’ role was classically 
demonstrated in the 1974 Washington Post investigation into the Watergate scandal, 
which led to the resignation of Richard Nixon as US president.
Some argue that the advent of the digital media, and particularly the internet, has 
only strengthened pluralism and political competition by giving protest groups 
a relatively cheap and highly effective means of disseminating information and 
organizing campaigns, as discussed later in the chapter. To them, the political 
communication has not only increased its reach, it has also become more accessible 
and democratic. However, the pluralist model suffers from significant deficiencies. 
For example, weak and unorganized groups are excluded from access to mainstream 
publishing and broadcasting, meaning that the mainstream media’s ideological 
marketplace tends to be relatively narrow and generally pro-establishment in 
character. While social media is more accessible, it also consists of a relatively small 
elite of ‘influencers’ whose voices have a far greater reach than most. In addition, 
private ownership and formal independence from government may not be sufficient 
to guarantee the media’s oppositional character in the light of the increasingly 
symbiotic relationship between government and broadcasters.
Dominant-ideology model
The dominant-ideology model portrays the mass media as a politically conservative 
force that is aligned to the interests of economic and social elites and serves to 
promote compliance or political passivity amongst the masses. Rooted in the larger 
Marxist critique of political culture and particularly the ideas of Gramsci, it suggests 
that the media propagate bourgeois ideas and maintain capitalist hegemony, acting 
in the interests of major corporations and media moguls. Ownership, in other words, 
ultimately determines the political and other views that the mass media disseminate, and 
ownership is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small number of global media 
conglomerates. Mass media companies like News Corporation (USA), Bertelsmann 
(Germany), Vivendi (France) and Televisa (Mexico) own hundreds of news outlets, 
movie studios, radio stations, music labels and publishing houses. These traditional 
media outlets have been more recently joined by ‘new media’ companies like Google 
(Alphabet) and Facebook (Meta), which own dozens of social media platforms and may 
have potentially enormous influence over what we see and hear on the internet. From this 
perspective, the media play an important role in promoting globalization (see p. 182),
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 225 23-07-2024 12:47:13226 POLITICS
in that their tendency to spread ideas, images and values that are compatible with 
Western consumerism helps to open up new markets and extend business penetration 
worldwide. Yet their influence is vast, and in an increasingly deregulated global media 
environment, difficult to effectively regulate or check, leading many observers to 
question just how ‘plural’ the views we are presented with are.
One of the most influential and sophisticated versions of the dominant-ideology 
model was developed by Noam Chomsky (see p. 227) and Ed Herman in 
Manufacturing Consent (2006), in the form of the ‘propaganda model’. They identified 
five ‘filters’ through which news and political coverage are distorted by the structures 
of the media itself. These filters are as follows:
 the business interests of owner companies
 a sensitivity to the views and concerns of advertisers and sponsors
 the sourcing of news and information from ‘agents of power’, such as governments 
and business-backed think-tanks
 ‘flak’ or pressure applied to journalists, including threats of legal action
 an unquestioning belief in the benefits of market competition and consumer 
capitalism.
Chomsky’s analysis emphasizes the degree to which the mass media can subvert 
democracy, helping, for example, to mobilize popular support in the USA for foreign 
wars and interventionist policies. The dominant-ideology model is, nevertheless, 
also subject to criticism. Objections to it include that it underestimates the extent 
to which the press and broadcasters, particularly public service broadcasters, 
pay attention to progressive social, racial and development issues. Moreover, the 
assumption that media output shapes political attitudes is determinist and neglects 
the role played by people’s own values in filtering, and possibly resisting, media 
messages. Over the last decade, public polling has consistently found less than half 
the American public express a high degree of trust in the reporting of the mass 
media and increasing receive their news from alternative sources (Brenan 2022).
Elite-values model
The elite-values model shifts attention away from the ownership of media corporations 
to the mechanism through which media output is controlled. This view suggests that 
editors, journalists and broadcasters enjoy significant professional independence, 
and that even the most interventionist of media moguls are able only to set a broad 
political agenda, but not to control day-to-day editorial decision-making. The 
media’s political bias (see p. 228) therefore reflects the values of groups that are 
disproportionally represented amongst its senior professionals. However, there are 
several versions of this model, depending on the characteristics that are considered 
to be politically significant.
One version of the elite-values model holds that the anti-socialist and politically 
conservative views of mainstream newspapers, magazines and television stations 
derive from the fact that their senior professionals are well paid and generally 
from middle-class backgrounds. A quite different version is sometimes advanced 
by conservatives, who believe that the mainstream media conversely reflects the 
CONCEPT
Mass media
The media comprise 
those societal 
institutions that 
are concerned with 
the production and 
distribution of all 
forms of knowledge, 
information and 
entertainment. The 
‘mass’ media channel 
communication 
towards a large and 
undifferentiated 
audience using relatively 
advanced technology. 
The clearest examples 
are the ‘broadcast’ 
media (television and 
radio) and the ‘print’ 
media (newspapers 
and magazines). 
The ‘new’ media 
(cable and satellite 
telecommunications, 
the internet and so 
on) has subverted the 
notion of mass media by 
dramatically increasing 
audience fragmentation.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 226 23-07-2024 12:47:13POLITICAL CULTURE AND THE MEDIA 227
views of university-educated, liberal intellectuals, whose values and concerns are 
quite different from those of the mass of the population. In its feminist version, 
this model highlights the predominance of males amongst senior journalists and 
broadcasters, implying that this both explains the inadequate attention given to 
women’s issues by the mass media, and accounts for the confrontational style of 
interviewing sometimes adopted by journalists. Although the elite-values model 
helps to explain why the range of political views expressed by the mass media is 
often more restricted than pluralists might suggest, it also has its limitations. Chief 
amongst these is that it fails to account for the significant pressures that bear upon 
senior media professionals; these, for example, include the views and interests of 
owners and commercial considerations; notably, ‘ratings’ figures.
KEY THINKER
NOAM CHOMSKY (BORN 1928)
US linguistic theorist and radical intellectual. Chomsky first achieved distinction as a scholar 
in the field of linguistic studies. His Syntactic Structures (1957) revolutionized the discipline 
with the theory of ‘transformational grammar’, which proposed that humans have an innate 
capacity to acquire language. Radicalized during the Vietnam War, Chomsky subsequently 
became the leading radical critic of US foreign policy, developing his views in an extensive 
range of works including American Power and the New Mandarins (1969), World Orders Old 
and New (1994) and Hegemony and Survival (2004). In works such as Manufacturing Consent
(1988), he developed a radical critique of the mass media and examined how popular support 
for imperialist aggression is mobilized.

Market model
The market model of the mass media differs from the other models, in that it dispenses 
with the idea of media bias: it holds that newspapers and television reflect, rather than 
shape, the views of the general public. This occurs because, regardless of the personal 
views of media owners and senior professionals, private media outlets are, first and 
foremost, businesses concerned with profit maximization and thus with extending 
market share. The media therefore give people ‘what they want’ and cannot afford to 
alienate existing or potential viewers or readers by presenting political viewpoints with 
which they may disagree. Indeed, the market model turns the logic of the previous 
three on its head, raising the interesting prospect that it is consumer behaviour which 
most drives how media companies operate, and that the news we hear is actually a 
reflection of our own interests and biases. Such considerations may be less pressing in 
relation to public service broadcasters, such as Britain’s BBC or Japan’s NHK, which 
are more insulated from commercial and advertiser pressures. But even in these cases, 
the tyranny of ratings and market pressures are increasingly evident, as politically 
these broadcasters must still justify their existence as taxpayer-funded entities.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 227 23-07-2024 12:47:13228 POLITICS
Nevertheless, although this model dispenses with the idea that at least the 
privately owned mass media should be seen as part of the political process, it helps 
to explain some significant trends in political life. One of these may be growing 
popular disenchantment with politics resulting from the trivialization of political 
coverage. Fearful of losing market share, television companies have reduced their 
coverage of serious political debate, and thus abandoned their responsibility for 
educating and informing citizens, in favour of ‘infotainment’. Trivial news coverage 
may be preferable to none, though – across the Western world particularly, public 
consumption of mainstream news has significantly declined, with dramatic 
implications for the financial viability of news outlets. In the USA, for instance, must 
still local and regional newspapers have closed over the past twenty years, creating 
a phenomenon termed ‘news deserts’ where localities have no local media coverage 
at all (Abernathy 2020).
Impact of the traditional media
Enhancing or threatening democracy?
The impact that the media have on democracy is one of the most widely debated 
aspects of the relationship between the media and politics. For many, the existence of 
a free press is one of the key features of democratic governance. But just how do the 
media act as custodians of democracy? And why have some questioned the media’s 
democratic credentials, even arguing that they may undermine it?
The capacity to provide a civic forum in which meaningful and serious political 
debate can take place is often viewed as the key role of the media in a democracy. The 
virtue of this is that better-informed citizens with more independent and considered 
views will be more politically engaged. The media are therefore agents of political 
education. Indeed, the media may have largely replaced formal representative 
institutions, such as legislatures, parliaments and local councils, as arenas for the 
dialogue, debate and deliberation that are the very stuff of democratic politics. 
This has happened because the media are, arguably, better suited to this role than 
are traditional representative bodies. In addition to offering the public perhaps its 
only meaningful opportunity to watch politicians in action (through, for example, 
interviews with politicians and televised debates), the media provide a forum for the 
expression of a much wider range of viewpoints and opinions than is possible within 
representative institutions composed only of elected politicians. Thus, academics 
and scientists, business leaders and trade union bosses, and representatives of 
interest groups and lobbyists of all kinds can express views and engage in public 
debate through the mechanism of media. Not only do the media substantially widen 
the range of views and opinions expressed in political debate, but they also present 
debate and discussion in a way that is lively and engaging for the public, devoid 
of the formality, even stuffiness, that characterizes the exchanges that take place in 
legislatures and council chambers around the world.
The ‘watchdog’ role of the media is, in a sense, a subset of the political debate 
argument. The role of the media, from this perspective, is to ensure that public 
accountability takes place, by scrutinizing the activities of government and exposing 
abuses of power. Once again, in carrying out this role the media is supplementing 
CONCEPT
Political bias
Political bias refers 
to political views that 
systematically favour 
the values or interests of 
one group over another 
as opposed to ‘balanced’ 
or ‘objective’ beliefs. 
Bias, however, may take 
various forms (McQuail 
1992). Partisan
bias is explicit and 
deliberately promoted, 
such as newspaper 
editorials. Propaganda
bias is deliberate but 
unacknowledged 
and subtle, using for 
example terms like ‘lazy’ 
students or ‘militant’ 
Muslims. Unwitting
bias occurs through 
seemingly professional 
considerations that 
impact which news 
stories get selected and 
how much coverage is 
given. Finally, ideological
bias operates through 
the assumptions and 
value judgements that 
are embedded in a 
particular belief system.
Free press: Newspapers 
(and, by extension, other 
media outlets) that are 
free from censorship and 
political interference by 
government and, usually, 
are privately owned.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 228 23-07-2024 12:47:14POLITICAL CULTURE AND THE MEDIA 229
and, to some extent, replacing the work of formal representative institutions. Media 
professionals such as researchers, journalists and television presenters are particularly 
suited to this role because they are ‘outside’ politics and have no interest other than 
to expose incompetence, corruption or simply muddled thinking whenever and 
wherever it can be found. By contrast, if public accountability is left solely in the 
hands of professional politicians, it may be constrained by the fact that those who 
attempt to expose ineptitude or wrongdoing wish themselves, at some stage, to hold 
government power. This may not only taint their motives, but it may also discourage 
them from criticizing processes and practices that they may wish to take advantage 
of in the future. However, the media can only perform this role effectively if they 
are properly independent. Democratic governance therefore requires either that 
the publicly financed media are accountable to an independent commission, or that 
there is an appropriate level of competition from ‘free’ or privately financed media.
However, reservations have also been expressed about the capacity of the media 
to promote effective democratic governance. The first of these, as advanced by 
dominant-ideology and elite-values theorists, is that, far from providing citizens 
with a wide and balanced range of political views, the content of the media is tainted 
by clear political biases. Whether political bias stems from the opinions and values 
of editors, journalists and broadcasters, or from a more general alignment between 
the interests of the media and those of economic and social elites, it is difficult to 
see how the media’s duty to provide objective information and remain faithful to 
public-service principles can be discharged reliably. Particular emphasis has, in this 
respect, been placed on the implications of media ownership, and the fact that the 
views and interests of major corporations or powerful media moguls cannot but, at 
some level, influence media output. Insofar as the mass media affects the political 
agenda, this agenda is likely to be politically conservative and, at least, compatible 
with the interests of dominant groups in society.
Second, as the mass media is not subject to public accountability, it is the classic 
example of ‘power without responsibility’ (Curran and Seaton 2009). However well￾informed, knowledgeable and stimulating the views of journalists and broadcasters 
may be, and however eager they may be to portray themselves as the ‘voice of the 
people’, media professionals – unlike elected politicians – ‘represent’ no one other than 
themselves and have no meaningful basis for claiming to articulate public opinion.
Third, there are reasons for doubting the independence of the media from 
government. Media outlets to some degree rely on political elites to feed them 
stories, interviews and information, while political elites rely on the media in 
turn to promote their interests and present them favourably in the public arena. 
Subsequently, a cooperative, even symbiotic relationship often develops between 
media professionals and the political elite which constrains both the mass media’s 
political views and their capacity to act as an effective ‘watchdog’.
The media and political leadership
Apart from its impact (for good or ill) on democracy, the prominence of the mass 
media in an ‘information age’ has affected the processes of governance (see p. 80)
through the transformation of political leadership, particularly through growing 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 229 23-07-2024 12:47:14230 POLITICS
interest in the personal lives and private conduct of senior political figures, at the 
expense of serious and ‘sober’ policy and ideological debate. This, in part, stems 
from the public’s, and in turn the media’s, fascination with image rather than issues, 
and with personality rather than policies. However, as Garzia et al. (2021) argue, 
declining partisan affiliation and ‘dealignment’, and the very personal and immediate 
degree to which leaders can now use the media to connect directly with the public, 
have also been major drivers of this shift.
Such trends reflect not so much conscious bias on the part of the media, as an 
attempt to ‘sell’ politics to a mass audience that is deemed to be little interested in 
issues and policies. This also accounts for the tendency to treat elections as simply 
competitions for power between rival personalities, with the public’s attention being 
focused less on the policy significance of the outcome and more on who is going 
to win. These two tendencies invariably coincide, turning elections into ‘beauty 
contests’ between leading politicians, each of whom serves as the ‘brand image’ 
of their party. Leaders are therefore judged largely on the basis of their televisual 
skills (relaxed manner, sense of humour, ability to demonstrate the ‘popular touch’ 
and so on), rather than their mastery of political issues and capacity for serious 
political debate. In the UK and other parliamentary systems, this phenomenon 
has been termed the ‘presidentialization’ of politics (as discussed in Chapter
13), referring to the perceived tendency of presidential systems (particularly the 
United States) to concentrate political power and influence around individual 
leaders. Yet even American politics has become progressively more personalized 
and image-focused with the development of mass media over the twentieth and 
twenty-first centuries.

There can be little doubt that the advent of the media age has also changed the 
behaviour and career prospects of politicians. Presentational factors, such as 
personal appearance, hairstyle, dress sense and so on, have become more important 
in determining political preferment or advancement. However, such developments 
have not merely changed the image of modern politics; they have reordered power 
relationships both within the political executive and between the executive and the 
legislature. The presidentialization of politics gives the political leaders the ability 
to make personalized appeals to the voters, creating the phenomenon of spatial 
leadership. This allows leaders to appeal ‘over the heads’ of their senior colleagues, 
parties and government institutions, directly to the public. US President Theodore 
Roosevelt famously termed this the ‘bully pulpit’, and its strength has only grown 
over time, as political leaders have gained unprecedented access to platforms like 
radio, television and social media to broadcast their agenda to millions of people 
directly. Furthermore, the messages they give, and the policy and ideological stances 
they adopt, are increasingly shaped by an ever-expanding band of public-relations 
consultants, media managers, pollsters and publicity directors.
One of the consequences of this is that junior politicians may have an additional 
reason for deferring to their leaders: their fear of damaging their leader’s image and 
reputation. If the leader is damaged, especially by splits and internal criticism, all 
members of his or her party or government suffer. This has become particularly 
evident in Westminster systems like Australia and Canada, where even though 
voters only vote for their local member of parliament at elections, the popularity of 
a party’s national leader is very strongly correlated with the fate of the party’s local 
candidates, regardless of the quality of such candidates.
Political power thus comes to be structured on the basis of the publicity and media 
attention received by individual politicians, particularly the national leaders. 
The greater the media attention, the greater the political leverage. However, 
media attention is far from an unqualified benefit for political leaders. Although 
their triumphs and successes can be publicly trumpeted, their flaws, failings and 
transgressions can also be ruthlessly exposed. Indeed, the ultimate vulnerability of 
contemporary political leaders may well be that negative media coverage may turn 
them into ‘electoral liabilities’, encouraging their parties and colleagues to remove 
them to save the party or their own political careers.
Culture of contempt
A further way in which the media has affected governance is through its impact on 
the political culture. The media is sometimes charged with having created a climate of 
corrosive cynicism amongst the public, leading to growing popular disenchantment 
with politics generally, and a lack of trust (see p. 501) in governments and politicians 
of all complexions (Lloyd 2004). A critical stance towards politicians in general 
and governments in particular is, of course, vital to the maintenance of democratic 
governance. However, the distinction between legitimate criticism and systematic 
and relentless negativity may, in practice, be difficult to uphold. This occurs, in 
part, because increasingly intense commercial pressures have forced the media to 
make their coverage of politics attention-grabbing and exciting. Facts are absorbed

parties and governments

progressively more quickly into a swirl of comment and interpretation, blurring the 
distinction between what happens and what it means. Routine political debate and 
policy analysis receive less and less attention, as the media focus instead on scandals 
of various kinds and allegations of incompetence, policy failure or simple inertia. 
Though this nihilistic shift in media emphasis can be found in the politics of many 
countries, the problems have become particularly acute in nations with very low 
levels of political trust, like Greece and Italy, where the continuous media emphasis 
on sensationalism, scandal and partisanship has eroded trust in the media as well. 
Leading politicians have, as a result, come to live in a kind of ongoing reality-television 
programme, the sole purpose of which appears to be to embarrass and denigrate 
them at every possible turn. The public, for their part, tend to view politicians as 
untrustworthy and deceitful, according them the same level of respect they would 
accord any other reality-television star. (The implications of such developments are 
examined further in Chapter 20.)
Policy-making in a media age
The final way in which the media has influenced governance is through its impact 
on the policy-making process. This has happened in at least two ways. The first is 
that, just like everyone else in society, government is bombarded by a much greater 
quantity of information arriving almost immediately. Knowing too much can 
sometimes be as dangerous as knowing too little. Moreover, as news and information 
spreads around the globe at a faster pace, governments are forced to react to events 
more quickly, and often before they have been fully discussed and digested. An age of 
‘24/7 news’ inevitably becomes one of ‘24/7 government’. Politicians are encouraged, 
even forced, to take a stance on issues simply to avoid being criticized for inertia or 
inactivity, leaving little time for the analysis of policy options and their implications.
Second, greater reliance on the media means that it can often be the media, and not 
government, that sets the political agenda and dictates the direction of policy-making. 
This can be positive, insofar as media attention to stories on neglected areas can drive 
policy attention sorely needed from politicians. For example, in India, women’s issues 
like domestic violence and social justice have traditionally received little attention 
from the government and politicians, but in recent decades mass and social media 
have played an enormous role in forcing the political and legal establishment to 
act in dire cases (Balhera 2018). Yet sometimes it can drive political attention in 
unproductive ways. Crime, particularly personal crimes like assault, rape and murder, 
have long been a mainstay of news media and elicit significant public attention – ‘if it 
bleeds it leads’. That media attention has been blamed by some for stoking unjustified 
public fears around crime. For instance, violent crime rates have fallen significantly 
since the 1990s in the United States, yet in the same period, the perception of crime 
has risen to record highs. As a result, law and order are frequently major issues in 
US election campaigns, with politicians, particularly conservatives, campaigning on 
more resources for policing and ‘tough on crime’ policies, despite scant evidence that 
they are necessary or effective. At the same time, growth in cybercrime has exploded 
since the 1990s, yet this problem is seldom reported on by the media, and seemingly 
as a consequence, rarely addressed by American politicians.

Social media and politics
The revolution in communication technologies brought about since the 1990s, 
especially by the spread of satellite and cable television, mobile phones, the internet 
and digital technology, has transformed the media and society, helping to create 
what has been called an ‘information society’ or a ‘network society’ (as discussed 
in Chapter 8). Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Wikipedia and Google, some 
unknown until only a few years ago, have become part of many people’s everyday 
lives. But how, and to what extent, has social media affected politics?
Viable e-democracy?
In its early phase, the use of new information and communications technology for 
political purposes was widely seen as a progressive step, leading to an improvement 
in the quality of political life, particularly by transferring power from governments 
and political elites to the public at large. This was reflected in growing interest in the 
idea of ‘e-democracy’. Harem Karem, for instance, argues that e-democracy has the 
potential to significantly increase mass participation in politics, allow more robust 
political debate, allow greater transparency and accountability of government and, 
in the process, perhaps reverse the downward trend in public trust and engagement 
amongst mature democracies (Karem 2023).
However, e-democracy (sometimes called ‘digital democracy’ or ‘cyberdemocracy’) 
is a vague and contested term which covers a diverse range of activities. Some of 
these are top-down activities (initiated by government or other public bodies) 
while others are bottom-up (initiated by citizens and activists), with a further 
distinction being made between those that involve a one-way flow of information 
from government to citizens and those involving a two-way process of interaction. 
Examples of e-democracy include the following:
 online voting (e-voting) in elections or referendums
 online petitions (e-petitions) organized by governments or other bodies
 accessing political information, news and comment via websites, blogs and so on
 the use of social networking sites and apps to allow citizens to engage in political 
argument and debate and, possibly, policy-making
 the use of smartphones and social media to organize popular protests and 
demonstrations.
Advocates of the use of social media in politics typically argue that the benefits of 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and other platforms is that they offer 
citizens wider and easier access to information and political comment. For the first 
time, citizens and citizen groups are privy to a quantity and quality of information 
that may rival that of governments, which has generally empowered non-state 
actors at the expense of national governments and traditional political elites. Non￾governmental organizations (see p. 302) and interest groups (see Chapter 12) have 
thus become more effective in challenging the positions and actions of government 
and, sometimes, even displaced government as an authoritative source of views and 
information about specialist subjects, ranging from the environment and global 
poverty to public health and civil liberties.

use of computer￾based technologies to 
deepen and enhance 
citizens’ engagement in 
democratic processes.

A further development has been the impact of social media on journalism. The 
rise of the blog and social media have greatly expanded the contours of political 
commentary, allowing writers, academics, politicians and others to share their 
observations and opinions about political matters with whomever may be interested 
in accessing them. There has also been enormous growth in user-generated content 
and ‘citizen journalism’, stemming from the increased willingness of private citizens 
in newsworthy or politically charged situations to share their thoughts, experiences 
and, frequently, pictures with others via social media. This creates a network of 
exchanges involving a potentially unlimited number of people.
Social media has also been credited with having supported the development of new 
political and social movements and increasing their effectiveness. The key advantage 
of social media, from this perspective, is not just that it opens up new opportunities 
for political participation, but also that these forms of participation are, by their 
nature, decentralized and non-hierarchical. For example, armed with smart 
phones, and through the development of online communities, anti-globalization 
or anti-capitalist protesters had been able to mount demonstrations and engage in 
agitation and direct action. This trend first became apparent during the so-called 
‘Battle of Seattle’ in 1999, when some 50,000 activists, some communicating via 
mobile phones, forced the cancellation of the opening ceremony of a World Trade 
Organization meeting. The political potential of Facebook was demonstrated by its 
role in facilitating the spread of pro-democracy protests in the early phase of the 2011 
Arab Spring. The capturing by witnesses and citizen activists of the violent deaths of 
several African Americans at the hands of police officers in recent years, such as the 
murder of George Floyd in 2020, have been instrumental in bringing wider public 
attention to issues of racial injustice and creating grass-roots movements for change, 
like Black Lives Matter (see pp. 203–204). Online movements have also sprung up, 
aiming to give a political voice to individuals who may otherwise not be heard, such 
as #MeToo, which campaigns against sexual harassment and assault by collecting 
and disseminating personal accounts from those affected. Some critics, though, 
have termed this new form of politics as ‘clicktivism’, due to the relatively low effort 
required to participate, arguing these campaigns fail to engender meaningful or deep 
engagement with the issues at stake. They have also questioned whether, despite its 
impressive reach, social media movements are capable of producing genuine political 
change in the same way as traditional activism and political organization has.
A further drawback of e-democracy is that it assumes that new communication 
technologies are, in themselves, progressive and liberating. In reality, technology is 
either liberating or oppressive depending on who is using it, and the uses to which 
it is put. It is worth remembering that the technologies that helped in the spreading 
and coordination of pro-democracy demonstrations during the Arab Spring are the 
same ones that, in other circumstances, have been used to spread racial or religious 
bigotry, or to promote political extremism generally. The deployment of the ‘Great 
Firewall’ to censor internet traffic in China, combined with laws and restrictions on 
the operations of foreign technology companies, has demonstrated how technology 
can be used to control as well as liberate.

DEBATING . . .
DOES THE WIDER USE OF DIGITAL MEDIA ENRICH POLITICS?
It is generally accepted that new digital or computer technologies are having a profound impact on society and politics, but 
it is less clear what that impact is. Is the digital age a motor for decentralization and democracy, or may new technologies 
debase politics and threaten freedom?
YES NO
Modernizing politics. Technological development reflects 
an ongoing desire to use science and innovation to make 
human existence more convenient and comfortable, 
and this applies in politics as well as other spheres of life. 
E-voting and ‘virtual’ referendums thus enable citizens to 
express their views easily and conveniently, possibly without 
having to leave home. Falling electoral turnouts may 
therefore simply be a consequence of the failure of the 
democratic process to keep up to date with how citizens in 
an ‘information society’ wish to participate in politics.
Knowledge is power. New technologies massively 
enlarge citizens’ access to information, making possible, 
for the first time, a truly free exchange of ideas and views. 
The internet already makes available to private citizens 
specialist information that was once only available to 
governments. Accessing information through Wikipedia 
and the myriad other online sources is not only almost 
instantaneous, but it also exposes the public to a rich 
diversity of views, including radical and dissident ones.
Citizen empowerment. The great advantage of new 
technologies is that they make possible a two-way 
transmission of views, thereby promoting active and 
engaged citizenship. Instead of participating in politics 
simply through the act of voting every few years, citizens 
can express views and opinions on an almost continuous 
basis, through, for instance, online consultations on draft 
legislation and online petitions. More radically, digital 
media may foster direct popular participation, making a 
reality of Athenian-style democracy, for so long dismissed 
as impracticable, or relevant only to township meetings.
Decentralized activism. The broadest claim made for 
digital media is that, in contributing to a wholesale shift 
in power from political elites to the public at large, it is 
bringing about a process of radical democratization. This 
occurs because new technologies are implicitly egalitarian 
(being relatively cheap, easily accessible and simple to 
use), and also facilitate decentralized and spontaneous 
social action. As modern protest movements clearly 
demonstrate, the use of mobile phones and social 
media in particular helps to make leadership and formal 
organization unnecessary, even irrelevant. 
Technological ‘Big Brother’. Technology has always been 
developed to serve the interests of elite or powerful groups, 
and digital technology is no exception. Contrary to the 
popular image that they are tools of liberation, mobile 
phones and the internet actually provide the police, security 
forces, tax officials and so on with access to a massive 
amount of information about the movements, views and 
activities of private citizens. As such, digital media provide 
a highly effective means of controlling dissident behaviour 
and containing political opposition.
Dangers of information anarchy. Many of the new political 
spaces opened up by digital media have been polluted by 
both the nature of the views they feature and the style of 
expression they tend to encourage. The internet provides 
a platform for religious fundamentalists, racists, ethnic 
nationalists and other extremists, who would otherwise 
struggle to attract public attention. Similarly, the 
blogosphere tends to be dominated by shrill, uncivil and 
opinionated views, fashioned, seemingly, by the desire to 
create notoriety.
New inequalities. The claim that new technologies are 
implicitly egalitarian is bogus. Most obviously, a ‘digital 
divide’ has opened up, based on the fact that access to 
new communication technologies is not universal. The 
‘information rich’ have come to dominate the ‘information 
poor’. In the feminist version of this argument, computers 
and technology generally have been seen to benefit men, 
since they reflect essentially male interests and patterns 
of thought. Digital media also provide private business 
with new opportunities to advertise, generate profits and 
improve their public image.
Impoverished, debased democracy. E-democracy, or 
‘virtual’ democracy, threatens to turn the democratic 
process into a series of push-button referendums while 
citizens sit alone in their own living rooms. This further 
erodes the ‘public’ dimension of political participation, 
reducing democratic citizenship to a set of consumer 
choices, somewhat akin to voting in the television show Big 
Brother. By weakening face-to-face human interaction, 
the danger is that people will be consumed by their own 
opinions, and become indifferent to those of others.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 235 23-07-2024 12:47:14236 POLITICS
E-campaigning and political marketing
One of the aspects of politics most clearly influenced by social media is digital 
campaigning. Indeed, some argue that the advent of digital campaigning, or 
e-campaigning, is bringing about a change as significant as the shift from door-to￾door canvassing and local election meetings to what essentially became television￾orientated campaigning. Websites, emails and podcasts provide candidates and 
parties with a fast and cheap means of getting their message across to a (potentially) 
large audience, in the process, aiding in the recruitment of campaign volunteers and 
the raising of campaign funds. E-campaigning has the advantage that it is particularly 
effective in reaching younger people, who have often been the most difficult section 
of the population to engage through the use of conventional strategies. Furthermore, 
social media allow campaigns to customize their messages on the basis of selected 
demographics (age, educational achievement, region and so forth), by giving them 
access to a wealth of personal information about the people who follow them. Finally, 
social media are structured to allow campaigns to ‘go viral’, through the use, for 
instance, of the ‘Share’ function on Facebook and the ‘re-tweet’ function on Twitter.
Although the internet has been used in campaigning since the mid-1990s, it 
became particularly prominent during Barack Obama’s US presidential campaigns 
in 2008 and 2012. Obama’s team used forums and social media platforms to build 
relationships, particularly with supporters, encouraging the spread of wider 
networks of support via the website MyBarackObama.com. Sympathizers were 
also sent regular updates on Obama’s policy positions by email and text messages. 
Nevertheless, new technologies were certainly not the be-all and end-all of the 
Obama campaigns, which also relied heavily, and spent most money, on traditional 
strategies such as television advertising. Donald Trump’s seemingly instinctive 
understanding of social media, particularly during the 2016 US presidential 
campaign and since, has further demonstrated the power of social media in 
modern politics. By posting tweets on a daily basis, often expressing controversial 
views, and by re-tweeting posts with predominantly right-wing content, Trump 
has used Twitter not only to speak directly to voters (without any cost), but also to 
set the news agenda for the day ahead. Trump’s tweets have thus, in effect, become 
news events in their own right.
Erosion of civility and centre politics
Social media may have helped to alter both the tone of political debate and its 
ideological focus. In recent years, there has arguably been a tendency for political 
debate to become shriller, sometimes through calculated attempts to shock or, 
perhaps, be offensive, in order to attract attention. Provoking shock and even outrage 
may help to generate profit, by extending reach and so helping to boost advertising 
revenues. In other words, in the internet age, it may pay to be offensive. The growth 
of blogs, social media and news websites has drawn new voices, and new types of 
voice, into the arena of political discourse. This applies, in particular, to people whose 
radical views and abrasive or ‘straight-talking’ political style probably makes them 
ill-suited to a career in conventional politics or journalism. But, critically, these 
technological developments have also allowed consumers of media to be increasingly

election of candidates for

selective in what information they see, and to patronize sources of news that merely 
confirm their pre-existing opinions and biases, rather than provide exposure to 
alternative points of view. Narrowcasting is one term used to describe this new 
tendency. Whereas in the past media organizations aimed to broadcast their views to 
the widest possible audience, now some news agencies specifically market themselves 
to niches of the population by expressing certain views.
Examples of such news websites include Breitbart, and the cable news channel One 
American News Network (OAN), often seen as one of the key mouthpieces for 
the ‘alt-right’ (alternative right) in the USA. They have created successful business 
models by appealing only to a narrow, but dedicated, segment of the news market. 
In the UK, the left-wing media outlet, The Canary, was founded in 2015 with the 
purpose of supporting Jeremy Corbyn’s attempts to carry through a comprehensive 
radicalization of the Labour Party. And news outlets that once sought to appeal 
to broader audiences may increasingly turn to a narrowcasting model in order to 
maintain commercial viability amongst an increasingly partisan electorate. The 
French television network TF1, established in 1935, has since the 1990s come under 
increasing criticism from commentators for its increasingly commercial, populist 
focus, the decline in the quality of its news coverage and growing right-wing 
editorial positions, all designed, some argue, to secure loyalty and maintain market 
share amongst the conservative French viewing public rather than present a broad 
view of French politics. The result of all these changes is that moderate, sober and 
centrist political positions and analysis may be crowded out by the sensationalism 
of the extremes. Moreover, polarization (see pp. 221–222) is seemingly reinforced as 
people increasingly consume media and ideas tailored to pre-existing views.
POST-TRUTH POLITICS?
Politics and truth
Politics has always had an uncomfortable relationship with truth. There has never 
been a golden age when politics and truth marched confidently hand in hand, with 
honesty being the dominant rule of the political sphere. This is because, as politics 
is inevitably concerned with the acquisition and exercise of power, it cannot but be 
entangled with manipulation, exaggeration, concealment and downright lies. This is 
particularly the case when government power is largely or entirely unchecked, and the 
media are controlled, directly or indirectly, by government and used as a propaganda 
machine. The classic example of a propaganda machine was that constructed under 
Joseph Goebbels in Nazi Germany. The Nazis set out to ‘coordinate’ German society 
through an elaborate process of ideological indoctrination. For example, youth 
organizations were set up in the form of the Hitler Youth and the League of German 
Maidens; the school curriculum was entirely revised and all teachers were coerced 
to join the Nazi Teachers’ League; and the German Reliever Front replaced free 
trade unions, providing workers with recreational facilities through the Strength 
through Joy organization. As chief propagandist of the Nazi Party, in 1933 Goebbels 
created a new department, the Reich Ministry of Information and Propaganda, 
which inundated Germany with an unending flood of propaganda and oversaw 
Narrowcasting: The 
dissemination of 
information (usually via 
internet, radio, newspaper 
or television) to a narrow 
audience, rather than 
to the broader public at 
large.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_9.indd 237 23-07-2024 12:47:14238 POLITICS
a programme of systematic censorship. Underlying these developments was the 
assumption that, as Goebbels put it, ‘if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, 
people will eventually come to believe it’. During the Nazi period, the theory of the 
‘big lie’ was applied, not least, to the ‘Final Solution’, the planned extermination of 
European Jewry.
Constitutional and political checks on government power, including a free media 
and electoral democracy, undoubtedly modify the disposition within politics 
towards dishonesty and deceit, but by no means eradicate it altogether. Apart from 
anything else, the need to win elections means that, among politicians and political 
parties, the desire to accentuate the positive and conceal the negative is irresistible. 
Moreover, although liberal-democratic structures rule out the cruder tactics of 
ideological manipulation, governments have come to shape the news agenda by 
new techniques for the control and dissemination of information, often described 
as news management, or ‘spin’. The favourable presentation of information and 
policies has thus become a major preoccupation of governments across the globe. 
The art of spin, carried out by so-called ‘spin-doctors’, includes practices such 
as the control of sources of information to ensure that only an official position 
is presented, the use of unattributable briefings or sources and the release of 
information close to media deadlines to prevent checking and the identification of 
counterarguments.
However, in recent years, the frequency with which often-sensational political news 
has appeared despite having no basis in fact, and the tendency for stories deemed 
to be damaging to a particular candidate or cause to simply be dismissed as ‘fake 
news’, has given the impression that politics had entered a ‘post-truth’ era. Although 
the growth in ‘fake news’ is often linked to changes in the media, and notably the 
absorption of social media into everyday life, the advent of post-truth politics 
can be seen as essentially a consequence of the rise of populism and of the anti￾establishment sentiments that it typically brings in its wake.
The drift towards anti-intellectualism
Finally, the rise of any ‘post-truth’ era may be in part blamed on what some have seen 
as a growing culture of anti-intellectualism, driven by populist political impulses. 
As Michael Gove, one of the leaders of the ‘Leave’ campaign in the 2016 Brexit 
referendum, put it, people have ‘had enough’ of experts. All too often, experts have 
come to be seen as members of a derided establishment, set apart from the mass of 
the population by the lives they lead, the language they speak and, indeed, by their 
very expertise. In that sense, their education is a source of corruption, imbuing them 
with a sense of self-regard and encouraging them to believe that they are somehow 
‘above’ the mass of the population. Such a view clashes sharply with the conventional 
notion that expertise derives from a disinterested (and probably public-spirited) 
search for knowledge. Populists, by contrast, place their faith in the opinions of the 
many, not of the few. This is based both on the assumption that the (albeit untutored) 
instincts of the masses have a moral purity that does not apply in the case of the elite, 
and the belief that ‘the crowd’ has greater wisdom than either a small group or a 
single individual (Surowiecki 2004).
CONCEPT
Propaganda
Propaganda is 
information (or 
disinformation) 
disseminated in a 
deliberate attempt 
to shape opinions 
and, possibly, 
stimulate political 
action. Propaganda 
is a pejorative term, 
implying both untruth 
or distortion, and a 
desire to manipulate and 
control public opinion. 
Propaganda differs 
from political bias in 
that it is systematic and 
deliberate, whereas the 
latter may be partial 
and unintentional. A 
distinction is sometimes 
drawn between ‘black’ 
propaganda (blatant 
lies), ‘grey’ propaganda 
(distortions and half￾truths) and ‘white’ 
propaganda (the truth).
Spin: The presentation of 
information so as to elicit 
the desired response, or 
being ‘economical with the 
truth’.
Fake news: False and 
usually sensational 
information disseminated 
under the guise of news 
reporting.
Post-truth: A condition 
in which objective, 
evidence-based 
knowledge has lost its 
authority, meaning that 
the distinction between 
truth and lies becomes 
immaterial.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
THE GLOBAL RISE OF FAKE NEWS
In the fall of 2016, Colombians went to the polls to vote 
in one of the most important referendums in their history. 
On the ballot was the ratification of a peace deal that had 
been struck between the government and the rebel FARC 
group to end nearly six decades of violent conflict that had 
claimed more than 100,000 lives. Although both ‘Yes’ and 
‘No’ campaigns were formally established, soon the media 
began reporting on a dramatic surge in fake news around 
the upcoming vote. The ‘No’ campaign focused on viral 
messaging through WhatsApp, one of the most popular 
communication apps in Colombia, though many of its 
messages were criticized as misleading, even dishonest. 
One of the most widely spread claims was that Colombian 
pensioners were going to have their benefits cut to pay 
off guerrilla fighters, which incensed and confused many 
voters. Photoshopped images, false quotes and sensational 
lies proliferated, and were eventually propagated by 
both sides of the campaign. The peace deal was narrowly 
rejected at the referendum, with commentators observing 
that ultimately many voters had been deeply misinformed 
as to the terms of the agreement, and the campaign had 
been far more bitter and divisive due to the rampant fake 
news.
Social media platforms have long been recognized as 
playing significant roles in politics, and, indeed, have been 
credited for playing a constructive and important role in 
coordinating political opposition during the Arab Spring 
uprisings, and Ukraine’s Euromaidan revolution in 2013. 
But in recent years attention has turned more to its role 
in propagating misinformation, particularly in the wake of 
Donald Trump’s election to the US presidency in 2016. The 
allegations included the claim that social media platforms 
were widespread purveyors of ‘fake news’, that they had 
swayed the outcomes of elections and referendums, that 
they had facilitated foreign, and usually Russian, meddling 
in domestic politics and that they had breached users’ 
privacy on a massive scale. In April 2018, Mark Zuckerberg, 
CEO of Facebook, was called before the US Congress 
for a two-day grilling about this and related matters. 
This happened in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica 
scandal, in which the defunct political consultancy, which 
had worked on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, 
was accused of improperly obtaining and passing on to its 
political clients personal data that Facebook had harvested 
from up to 87 million of its users.
Critics of Facebook and other social media platforms argue 
that these platforms lie at the heart of the problem of ‘fake 
news’. It stems from the fact that social media’s focus 
on user-generated information means that politicians, 
political groups and political campaigns can make direct 
contact with perhaps millions of voters, unconstrained 
by the ‘filters’ and checks that would apply in the case 
of traditional journalism. In the absence of effective 
mechanisms for checking facts and ensuring accountability 
and/or political balance, partisanship flourishes and truth is 
routinely bent to serve the interests of partisan agendas. 
This is compounded by a business model that arguably 
favours falsehood over truth, because the often shocking 
or outrageous nature of the former tends to mean that 
stories are shared faster and more widely, in the process 
attracting increased revenue from advertising.
Yet sometimes it is state actors themselves that act as 
the principal propagators of fake news or use the fight 
against fake news as a cover for their own attempts at 
censorship. In 2022 the Russian government passed a 
law prohibiting ‘fake news’ that was explicitly designed to 
suppress accurate reporting of its war in Ukraine. Russia 
has also routinely used hacking groups and foreign agents 
to sow misinformation in other countries, particular during 
election campaigns. China, Malaysia and other countries 
have been accused of similar acts. Legitimate attempts 
by states to combat fake news have thus far proven

Moreover, as populism draws much of its potency from its ability to offer simple 
solutions to simple problems, it offers little scope for the complexities that are 
an inevitable feature of intellectual analysis. For example, during the 2016 US 
presidential election, Donald Trump repeatedly stated a commitment to solve the 
problem of immigration from Mexico by building a wall that Mexico would pay 
for. However, he did this without addressing difficult questions about, among other 
things, how and exactly where the wall would be constructed, how much the wall 
would cost, how Mexico could be persuaded to pay for it and who would pay for the 
wall if Mexico refused to pay up. Politicians may, therefore, only be able to adopt 
bold, confident stances on matters that deeply trouble the electorate if they either 
choose not to think too deeply about the matter in hand or choose not to share their 
deeper thinking with the electorate.
To be sure, politicians are generally not experts in specific policy areas. They have 
always made promises, sometimes outlandish or impractical, to appeal to the public, 
who want to hear solutions rather than problems and excuses. But the willingness 
of some populist politicians to insist on popular yet unviable policies, or to make 
claims even in the face contradictory evidence, represents a particular challenge 
in electoral democracies. The public generally lacks the expertise to adjudicate 
competing arguments and may be more attracted to the exciting and reassuring, 
even if unproven, narratives of the charismatic politician over the more informed, 
yet likely more complicated and equivocal, explanation of the ‘expert’. This problem 
is only exacerbated by the decline of trusted traditional journalism, which has 
traditionally served to question and contest the claims of the political elite.
Finally, populists are keenly aware that, in the age of anti-politics (see Chapter
20), sustained political engagement is often more likely to be achieved through 
feelings and emotions than it is through reason and analysis. This is because the 
disenchantment that builds up in sections of the electorate that feel ignored by 
conventional politicians and parties makes them less susceptible to balanced debate 
and argument and more susceptible to an appeal based on anger or hope. Populists 
seek to exploit this by forging an emotional connection with disaffected voters and 
do so through the use of simple, aspirational slogans. Examples of this include ‘Make 
America Great Again’, from Trump’s 2016 election campaign, and ‘Taking Back 
Control’, from the Brexit referendum campaign. The effectiveness of these campaigns 
demonstrates both the centrality of political communication and marketing in 
contemporary politics, and the enormous impact changing telecommunications 
technology is having on how politics is practised.
unsuccessful, in part because the rapid and viral nature of 
modern information dissemination means that it is very 
hard to catch and retract a lie once it is out, and often very 
hard to trace the origin point as well.
Fake news is not itself new, and throughout history the best 
and most reliable defence against fake news has been an 
informed citizenry, with the skills and judgement to discern 
between what is truth and what is deliberate falsehood. Yet 
with digital manipulation and artificial intelligence being 
able to create ever-more sophisticated forgeries and ‘deep 
fakes’, commentators have noted that soon fake news will 
be virtually indistinguishable from real news.

VOTING

PREVIEW
In any genuine democracy, elections are the heart of the political process. Elections are the means through which 
the people can control their government, and endorse or reject parties and their policies. Those whom the public 
elect to be their representatives and govern over them do so, at least in theory, only at the behest of and with the 
approval of the voters. And if they fail to meet expectations, elections are the means by which the public can ‘kick 
the rascals out’.
Although it is widely accepted that elections play a pivotal role in the process of representative democracy, 
electoral systems are many and various, and debate has long raged over the merits and drawbacks of each. Different 
electoral systems have different strengths or advantages, but there is no consensus over the criteria that should be 
used for assessing them. And, more broadly, there is considerable disagreement about what representation really 
means and how it can be achieved in practice. Finally, elections need voters, but there is little agreement about why 
voters vote as they do, and especially about the extent to which their behaviour is rationally based, as opposed to 
being influenced by underlying psychological, social or ideological forces.

REPRESENTATION
One of the central challenges of any democracy is how to translate the will of the 
public into a system of government. The simplest way is direct democracy – that 
is, the people literally rule themselves by meeting regularly and voting on major 
decisions and courses of action. This was the system used in the earliest formalized 
democracies of Ancient Greece and represented the pinnacle of ‘consent of the 
governed’ for many political philosophers (see Chapter 4).
However, as communities become larger, and government more complex, direct 
democracy rapidly becomes impractical. A town of a hundred or even a thousand 
people can probably bring its citizens together easily enough to debate and vote 
on issues. But how could a modern city of several hundred thousand do so and 
still allow everyone their say? Or a country of several million, with its population 
spread over vast distances? Moreover, governments make complex decisions on 
a staggering array of issues every day – from planning highways to approving 
medicines to setting interest rates to negotiating foreign treaties. Amidst their jobs, 
families and other interests, even the most engaged citizens could not possibly 
develop the expertise needed or meet regularly enough to understand and vote on 
everything a government must do. Hence the creation of representative democracy. 
In such systems, the public periodically elect people who will represent them in the 
decision-making process and rule on their behalf. In theory, an election will produce 
a body of representatives who are a microcosm of the wider electorate, whose job 
it will be to debate the issues and make decisions that represent the collective will.
In practice, the representative aspect of democracy is deeply controversial and complex. 
How can one person be said to represent another, and what it is that he or she represents? 
Is it the views of the represented, their best interests, the groups from which they come or 
what? Should representation be restricted to those who have the competence, education 
and, perhaps, leisure to act wisely and think seriously about politics, or should anyone 
be allowed this role? And what are the obligations of the representative to those who 
elected them? Scholars and voters alike have long debated these questions.
Theories of representation
There is no single, agreed theory of representation. Rather, there are a number of 
competing theories, each of which is based on particular ideological and political 
assumptions. Particular models of representation dictate very different behaviour 
on the part of representatives. For instance, should elected politicians be bound by 
policies and positions outlined during an election and endorsed by the voters, or 
is it their job to lead public opinion and thereby help to define the public interest? 
Moreover, it is not uncommon for more than one principle of representation to 
operate within the same political system, suggesting, perhaps, that no single model is 
sufficient in itself to secure representative government.
Four principal models of representation have been advanced:
 trusteeship
 delegation
 the mandate
 resemblance.
CONCEPT
Representation
Representation is, 
broadly, a relationship 
through which an 
individual or group 
stands for, or acts 
on behalf of, a larger 
body of people. 
Representation differs 
from democracy in 
that, while the former 
acknowledges a 
distinction between 
government and the 
governed, the latter, 
at least in its classical 
form, aspires to abolish 
this distinction and 
establish popular 
self-government. 
Representative 
democracy may 
nevertheless constitute 
a limited and indirect 
form of democratic 
rule, provided that the 
representation links 
government and the 
governed in such a way 
that the people’s views 
are articulated, or their 
interests secured.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_10.indd 243 23-07-2024 12:48:09244 POLITICS
Trustee model
A trustee is a person who acts on behalf of others, using his or her superior 
knowledge, better education or greater experience. The classic expression of 
representation as trusteeship is found in Edmund Burke’s (see p. 37) speech to the 
electors of Bristol in 1774:
You choose a member indeed; but when you have chosen him he is not member 
of Bristol, but he is a member of parliament … Your representative owes you, not 
his industry only, but his judgement; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he 
sacrifices it to your opinion.
For Burke, the essence of representation was to serve one’s constituents by the 
exercise of ‘mature judgement’ and ‘enlightened conscience’. In short, representation 
is a moral duty: those with the good fortune to possess education and understanding 
should act in the interests of those who are less fortunate. Moreover, James Madison 
(see p. 384) saw representation as a way of not just representing the public will 
but also tempering it. Madison counselled against the dangers of ‘mob rule’ in a 
democracy, insofar as on controversial or emotional issues, it is easy for a crowd 
to make impulsive or dangerous decisions. The trustee model hopes that cooler 
heads should prevail in government in such situations. This view has strongly elitist 
implications though, since it stresses that, once elected, representatives should think 
for themselves and exercise independent judgement on the grounds that ordinary 
people do not know their own best interests.
A similar view was advanced by John Stuart Mill in the form of the liberal theory 
of representation. This was based on the assumption that, although all individuals 
have a right to be represented, not all political opinions are of equal value. Mill 
therefore proposed a system of plural voting in which four or five votes would 
be allocated to holders of learned diplomas or degrees, two or three to skilled or 
managerial workers, and a single vote to ordinary workers. He also argued that 
rational voters would support politicians who could act wisely on their behalf, rather 
than those who merely reflected the voters’ own views. Trustee representation thus 
portrays professional politicians as representatives, insofar as they are members of 
an educated elite. It is based on the belief that knowledge and understanding are 
unequally distributed in society, in the sense that not all citizens know what is best 
for them.
This notion of representation has also attracted severe criticism, however. For 
instance, it appears to have clearly anti-democratic implications. If politicians should 
think for themselves because the public are ignorant, poorly educated or deluded, 
then surely it is a mistake to allow the public to elect their representatives in the 
first place. Second, the link between representation and education is questionable. 
Whereas education may certainly be of value in aiding the understanding of intricate 
political and economic problems, it is far less clear that it helps politicians to make 
correct moral judgements about the interests of others. There is little evidence, for 
example, to support Burke’s and Mill’s belief that education breeds altruism and 
gives people a broader sense of social responsibility. Moreover, in many societies 
Trustee: A person who 
is vested with formal 
(and usually legal) 
responsibilities for 
another’s property or 
affairs.
Altruism: A concern 
for the welfare of 
others, based on either 
enlightened self-interest, 
or recognition of a 
common humanity.

education levels are closely related to wealth, race and gender. Educated and wealthy 
men dominated European parliaments in Burke’s era, and their policies tended 
to reflect the interests of that group rather than the public as a whole, as Mary 
Wollstonecraft (see p. 51) famously argued in A Vindication of the Rights of Men 
(1790), which was directed at Burke. Finally, there is the fear traditionally expressed 
by radical democrats such as Thomas Paine (see p. 246) that, if politicians are allowed 
to exercise their own judgement, they will simply use that latitude to pursue their 
own selfish interests. In this way, representation could simply become a substitute 
for democracy. In his pamphlet Common Sense (1776), Paine came close to the rival 
ideal of delegate representation in insisting that ‘the elected should never form to 
themselves an interest separate from the electors’.
Delegate model
A delegate is a person who acts as a conduit conveying the views of others, while 
having little or no capacity to exercise his or her own judgement or preferences. 
Ambassadors and trade representatives, for example, receive instructions from 
their home governments on how interact with foreign entities, and in most 
circumstances have very little authority to make independent decisions. Those who 
favour a delegate model for elected representatives usually support mechanisms 
that ensure that politicians are bound as closely as possible to the views of the 
represented. These include what Paine referred to as ‘frequent interchange’ between 
representatives and their constituents in the form of regular elections and short 
terms in office. In addition, radical democrats have advocated the use of initiatives 
and the right of recall as means of giving the public more control over politicians. 
Although delegation stops short of direct democracy, its supporters nevertheless 
usually favour the use of referendums (see p. 248) to supplement the representative 
process.
Delegate: A person who is 
chosen to act for another 
on the basis of clear 
guidance and instruction; 
delegates do not think for 
themselves.
Initiative: A type of 
referendum through 
which the public are 
able to raise legislative 
proposals.
Recall: A process whereby 
the electorate can call 
unsatisfactory public 
officials to account and 
ultimately remove them.
KEY THINKER
JOHN STUART MILL (1806–73)
UK philosopher, economist and politician. Mill was subject to an intense and austere regime 
of education by his father, the utilitarian theorist James Mill (1773–1836). This resulted in 
a mental collapse at the age of twenty, after which he developed a more human philosophy 
influenced by Coleridge and the German Idealists. His major writings, including On Liberty
(1859) and Considerations on Representative Government (1861), had a powerful influence on 
the development of liberal thought. In many ways, Mill’s work straddles the divide between 
classical and modern liberalism. His distrust of state intervention was firmly rooted in 
nineteenth-century principles, but his emphasis on the quality of individual life looked forward 
to later developments.

The virtue of what has been called ‘delegated representation’ is that it provides 
broader opportunities for popular participation and serves to check the self￾serving inclinations of professional politicians. It thus comes as close as is possible 
in representative government to realizing the ideal of popular sovereignty. Its 
disadvantages are, nevertheless, also clear. In the first place, in ensuring that 
representatives are bound to the interests of their constituents, it tends to breed 
narrowness and foster conflict. This is precisely what Burke feared would occur if 
members of the legislature acted as ambassadors who took instructions from their 
constituents, rather than as representatives of the nation. To create budgets and 
legislation that serve the national interest, inevitably compromises and trade-offs 
must be made, which in turn requires representatives to be flexible and willing to 
make sacrifices their local constituents may be less enthusiastic about. A second 
drawback is that because professional politicians are not trusted to exercise 
their own judgement, delegation limits the scope for leadership (see p. 365) and 
statesmanship. Politicians are forced to reflect the views of their constituents or even 
pander to them and are thus not able to mobilize the people by providing vision and 
inspiration. Indeed, politicians who are willing to abandon their values or change 
their policies whenever the political winds change are often derided by voters as 
weak and untrustworthy.
Mandate model
Both the trustee model and the delegate model were developed before the emergence 
of modern political parties, and therefore view representatives as essentially 
independent actors. However, individual candidates are now rarely elected on the 
basis of their personal qualities and talents alone. In most democracies, they are seen 
much more as foot soldiers for a party and are elected because of their party’s public 
image or programme of policies. New theories of representation have therefore 
emerged. The most influential of these is the so-called mandate model. This is based on 
Popular sovereignty: The 
principle that there is 
no higher authority than 
the will of the people 
(the basis of the classical 
concept of democracy).
KEY THINKER
THOMAS PAINE (1737–1809)
UK-born writer and revolutionary. Paine was brought up in a Quaker family and spent his early 
years as an undistinguished artisan. He went to America in 1774 and fought for the colonists 
in the War of Independence. He returned to England in 1789, but, after being indicted for 
treason, fled to France as a supporter of the republican cause, where he narrowly escaped 
the guillotine during the Terror. Paine’s radicalism fused a commitment to political liberty with 
a deep faith in popular sovereignty, providing inspiration for both liberal republicanism and 
socialist egalitarianism. He was an important figure in revolutionary politics in the USA, the 
UK and France. He was made famous by his revolutionary pamphlet, Common Sense (1776), 
but wrote many other important works, including The Rights of Man and The Age of Reason 
(Paine 1995). Source: The Miriam and

the idea that, in winning an election, a party gains a popular mandate that authorizes 
it to carry out whatever policies it campaigned on during the election campaign. As 
it is the party, rather than individual politicians, that is the agent of representation, 
the mandate model provides a clear justification for party unity and party discipline. 
In effect, politicians serve their constituents not by thinking for themselves or acting 
as a channel to convey their constituent’s views, but by remaining loyal to their party 
and its policies.
The strength of the mandate doctrine is that it takes account of the undoubted 
practical importance of party labels and party policies. Moreover, it provides a means 
of imposing some kind of meaning on election results, as well as a way of keeping 
politicians to their word. Nevertheless, the doctrine has also stimulated fierce 
criticism. First, it is based on a highly questionable model of voting behaviour, insofar 
as it suggests that voters select parties on the grounds of policies and issues. Voters 
are not always the rational and well-informed creatures that this model suggests. 
They can be influenced by a range of ‘irrational’ factors, such as the personalities of 
leaders, the images of parties, habitual allegiances and social conditioning.
Second, even if voters are influenced by policy platforms, it is likely that they will 
be attracted by certain policy commitments, but be less interested in, or perhaps 
opposed to, others. A vote for a party cannot therefore be taken to be an endorsement 
of its entire platform or, indeed, of any single election promise. Third, the doctrine 
imposes a straitjacket. It limits government policies to those positions and proposals 
that the party took up during the election and leaves no scope to adjust policies in 
the light of changing circumstances. What guidance do mandates offer in the event 
of, say, unforeseen wars or economic crises? Finally (as discussed in the next main 
section of this chapter), the doctrine of the mandate can be applied only in the case 
of majoritarian electoral systems, and its use even there may lack credibility if the 
winning party fails to gain 50 per cent of the popular vote.
Resemblance model
The final theory of representation is based less on the manner in which representatives 
are selected than on whether they typify or resemble the group they claim to 
represent. This notion is embodied in the idea of a ‘representative cross-section’, as 
used by market researchers and opinion pollsters. By this standard, a representative 
government could sometimes be said to constitute a microcosm of the larger society, 
containing members drawn from all groups and sections in society (in terms of social 
class, gender, age and so on), and in numbers that are proportional to the size of the 
groups in society at large. The idea of descriptive representation has traditionally 
been endorsed by scholars concerned with equality and justice. They argue that 
the under-representation of groups such as the working class, women and racial 
minorities in key political and government institutions results in their interests being 
marginalized or ignored.
Few advocates of descriptive representation argue that only a member of a minority 
group can represent the interests of the group, implying, in the case of gender, that 
men are simply incapable of representing women’s interests. Instead, it is accepted 
that male feminists, or ‘pro-feminist’ males, can and do advance gender-equitable 
CONCEPT
Mandate
A mandate is an 
instruction or command 
from a higher body that 
demands compliance. 
The idea of a policy 
mandate arises from 
the claim on behalf 
of a winning party in 
an election that its 
manifesto promises have 
been endorsed, giving 
it authority to translate 
these into a programme 
of government. The 
doctrine of the mandate 
thus implies that the 
party in power can only 
act within the mandate 
it has received. The 
more flexible notion of 
a governing mandate, or, 
for an individual leader, 
a personal mandate, 
has sometimes been 
advanced, but it is 
difficult to see how this 
in any way restricts 
politicians once they are 
in power.
Microcosm: Literally, a 
little world; a miniature 
version of a larger body, 
but exact in its features 
and proportions.

model of representation 
that takes account of 
politicians’ social and 
other characteristics, 
sometimes based on the 
idea that they should be a 
‘representative sample’ of 
the larger society.

policy agendas in meaningful ways. At the same time, there is a recognition that it is 
women office-holders who most often, most vocally, and most thoroughly address 
public policy issues that are of most salience to women. This is sometimes explained 
in terms of the difference between empathy, in the sense of ‘putting oneself in the 
shoes of another’ and having direct personal experience of what other people go 
through. A further advantage of descriptive representation is that, by countering the 
systematic exclusion of minority groups, and so increasing the level of diversity in 
elected bodies, it ensures that better decisions are made for the common good.
However, the resemblance model is not without its challenges and critics. Argentina, 
for instance, introduced quotas in 1991 to ensure greater female representation in its 
legislature; a policy that has been since followed in several Latin American countries. 
Scholars have found mixed outcomes, however, noting that increased female

REFERENDUMS: FOR OR AGAINST?
A referendum is a vote in which the electorate can express a view on a particular issue of 
public policy or law. It differs from an election in that the latter is essentially a means of filling 
a public office and does not provide a direct or reliable method of influencing the content of 
policy. The referendum is therefore a device of direct democracy (see p. 102). It is typically 
used not to replace representative institutions, but to supplement them. Referendums may be 
either advisory or binding. They may raise issues for discussion (initiatives), be used to decide 
policy questions (propositions or plebiscites) and in some systems they are the means by which 
changes to constitutions or political systems are ratified (amendments).
Amongst the advantages of referendums are the following:
 They check the power of elected governments, ensuring that they stay in line with public 
opinion.
 They promote political participation, thus helping to create a more educated and better￾informed electorate.
 They strengthen legitimacy by providing the public with a way of expressing their views 
about specific issues.
 They provide a means either of settling major constitutional questions, or of gauging 
public opinion on issues not raised in elections because major parties agree on them.
The disadvantages of referendums include the following:
 They leave political decisions in the hands of those who have the least education and 
experience, and are most susceptible to media and other influences.
 They provide, at best, only a snapshot of public opinion at one point in time.
 They allow politicians to manipulate the political agenda and absolve themselves of 
responsibility for making difficult decisions.
 They tend to simplify and distort political issues, reducing them to questions that have a 
yes/no answer.

representation has not necessarily led to significant progress on women’s issues there 
and had paradoxically reinforced negative stereotypes of female politicians amongst 
some voters (Franceschet and Piscopo 2008).
KEY THINKER
JOSEPH SCHUMPETER (1883–1950)
Austrian-American economist and sociologist. Following an early academic career and a brief 
spell as Minister of Finance in post-First World War Austria, Schumpeter became professor 
of economics at Harvard University in 1932. His economic thought, developed in Theory of 
Economic Development (1912) and Business Cycles (1939), centred on the long-term dynamics 
of the capitalist system and in particular the role of ‘risk-loving’ entrepreneurs. In Capitalism, 
Socialism and Democracy (1942), Schumpeter drew on economic, sociological and political 
theories to advance the famous contention that Western capitalism was, impelled by its very 
success, evolving into a form of socialism.

ELECTIONS
Although controversy continues to rage about the nature of representation, there is 
one point of universal agreement: the representative process is intrinsically linked 
to elections and voting. Indeed, some thinkers have gone further and portrayed 
elections as the very heart of democracy. This was the view developed by Joseph 
Schumpeter in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942), which portrayed 
democracy as an ‘institutional arrangement’, as a means of filling public office by 
a competitive struggle for the people’s vote. As he put it, ‘democracy means only 
that the people have the opportunity of accepting or refusing the men [sic] who are 
to rule them’. In interpreting democracy as nothing more than a political method, 
Schumpeter, in effect, identified it with elections, and specifically with competitive 
elections. While few modern democratic theorists are prepared to reduce 
democracy simply to competitive elections, most nevertheless follow Schumpeter in 
understanding democratic government in terms of the rules and mechanisms that 
guide the conduct of elections. This focuses attention on the very different forms 
that elections can take.
First, which offices or posts are subject to the elective principle? Although elections 
are widely used to fill those public offices whose holders have policy-making 
responsibilities (the legislature and executive, in particular), key political institutions 
are sometimes treated as exceptions, such as the Canadian Senate and the British 
House of Lords. And opinions differ on which areas of government should be 
subjected to democratic input. Judges, for instance, often make crucial decisions on 
the interpretation of constitutions and legislation that have enormous ramifications 
for society and the political system. While some uphold the principle that the law 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_10.indd 249 23-07-2024 12:48:10250 POLITICS
should be above politics, others contend that such a position is naive and elitist. For 
example, Bolivia, Switzerland, Japan and some states of the USA practice forms of 
judicial elections (see pp. 337–340).
Second, who is entitled to vote, and how widely is the franchise drawn? As pointed 
out, restrictions on the right to vote based on factors such as property ownership, 
education, gender and racial origin have been abandoned in most countries. 
However, some restrictions like age are still relevant and debated. While suffrage at 
eighteen years old is the norm globally, it is as high as twenty-five in the United Arab 
Emirates and there has been a growing push to extend the franchise to those who 
are sixteen or seventeen years old, as was done in Austria in 2007. Moreover, there 
may be informal restrictions, as is the practice in most US states, of leaving electoral 
registration entirely in the hands of the citizen, with the result that non-registration 
and non-voting are widespread. On the other hand, in Australia, Belgium and Brazil, 
for instance, voting is compulsory (see p. 251).
Third, how are votes cast? Although public voting was the norm in many countries 
in the nineteenth century, and it is still widely practised in small organizations in 
the form of a show of hands, modern political elections are generally held on the 
basis of a secret ballot (sometimes called an ‘Australian ballot’, as it was first used in 
South Australia in 1856). The secret ballot is usually seen as the guarantee of a free 
and fair election, in that it keeps the dangers of corruption and intimidation at bay. 
Nevertheless, electoral fairness cannot simply be reduced to the issue of how people 
vote. It is also affected by the voters’ access to reliable and balanced information, 
the range of choice they are offered, the circumstances under which campaigning is 
carried out and, finally, how scrupulously the vote is counted.
Finally, are elections competitive or non-competitive? This is usually seen as the most 
crucial of distinctions, as until the 1990s, only about half of the countries that used 
elections offered their electorates a genuine choice of both candidates and parties. 
Single-candidate elections, for example, were the rule in orthodox communist states. 
This meant that public office was effectively filled through a nomination process 
dominated by the ruling party. Electoral competition is a highly complex and often 
controversial issue. It concerns not merely the right of people to stand for election 
and the ability of political parties to nominate candidates and campaign legally, but 
also broader factors that affect party performance, such as their sources of funding 
and their access to the media. From this point of view, the nature of the party system 
may be as crucial to the maintenance of genuine competition as are rules about 
who can stand and who can vote. Many ‘flawed’ democracies (see Chapter 5) are 
classified as such because, for a variety of reasons, there is a limited choice of parties 
or candidates at the ballot box.
Functions of elections
Because of the different kinds of elections, and the variety of electoral systems, 
generalization about the roles or functions of elections is always difficult. Nevertheless, 
the advance of democratization (see p. 135) in the 1980s and 1990s, stimulated in 
part by the collapse of communism, has usually been associated with the adoption 
of liberal-democratic electoral systems, characterized by universal suffrage, the

DEBATING . . .
SHOULD VOTING BE COMPULSORY?
In 2013, some twenty-two countries operated a system of compulsory voting for some or all elected bodies, although only 
in a minority of cases was this enforced through the threat of punishment (usually by a small fine, or community service). 
However, while some argue that compulsory voting strengthens democracy, even seeing it as a civic duty, others point out 
that ‘non-voting’ is a basic civil right, whose infringement may make a mockery of the democratic process.
YES NO
Increased participation. The almost certain consequence 
of introducing compulsory voting would be that turnout 
rates will increase. Voter turnout in Australia has thus 
been consistently around 94–6 per cent since the 
introduction of nationwide compulsory voting in 1924, 
having previously been as low as 47 per cent. Compulsory 
voting would, at a stroke, resolve the ‘participation crises’ 
that afflict so many mature democracies, in the process 
counteracting longer-term trends against voting in 
modern, individualized and consumerist societies.
Greater legitimacy. Governments formed on the basis 
of compulsory voting would be much more likely to rest 
on a popular majority (a majority of those eligible to 
vote), not just an electoral majority (a majority of those 
who actually vote). Declining turnout in the UK’s non￾compulsory system meant that, in 2005, the Labour 
Party was able to gain a comfortable parliamentary 
majority with the support of just 22 per cent of the 
electorate. Compulsory voting would therefore 
strengthen democratic legitimacy and ensure that 
governments do not neglect sections of society that are 
less active politically.
Civic duty. Citizenship is based on reciprocal rights and 
responsibilities. The right to vote therefore involves a 
duty to exercise that right, and legal compulsion simply 
ensures that that duty is fulfilled (treating it like paying 
taxes, jury service and (possibly) military conscription). 
Moreover, enforcing the responsibility to vote has 
educational benefits, in that it will stimulate political 
activism and create a better-informed citizenry.
Countering social disadvantage. Voluntary voting 
traditionally disadvantages the most vulnerable elements 
in society, the poor and less educated – those who are, as 
research consistently shows, least likely to vote. Genuine 
political equality requires not only that all can vote, but 
that all do vote, and compulsory voting not only helps 
ensure a broader cross-section of society participate, 
but it is also thought to have a socializing effect, insofar 
as unengaged groups tend to increase their political 
engagement when compelled to vote. 
Abuse of freedom. Compulsion, even in the name of 
democracy, remains compulsion: a violation of individual 
freedom. The right not to vote may, in some senses, be as 
important as the right to choose for whom to vote. Non￾voting may thus be a conscientious act, a product of rational 
and considered reflection, an attempt to draw attention to, 
amongst other things, the lack of choice among mainstream 
political parties or, perhaps, to express a principled rejection 
of the political system itself.
Cosmetic democracy. Compulsory voting addresses the 
symptoms of the problem but not the cause. Making voting 
compulsory would undoubtedly increase the electoral 
turnout, but it would not address the deeper problems 
that account for a growing decline in civic engagement. 
Higher turnout levels brought about through compulsion 
may therefore simply mask deeper problems, making it less 
likely, rather than more likely, that issues such as the decline 
in trust in politicians, and a lack of effective responsiveness 
and accountability, will be properly addressed.
Worthless votes. Generally, those who do not vote have 
the least interest in and understanding of politics. Forcing 
would-be non-voters to vote would therefore simply 
increase the number of random and unthinking votes 
that are cast. This may particularly be the case when 
some voters, because they only turn up through a fear of 
punishment, may feel resentful and aggrieved. This is an 
especially worrying prospect as such ‘worthless’ votes may, 
ultimately, determine the outcome of an election.
Responsiveness. Compulsory voting tends to encourage 
mainstream parties to adopt centrist, uncontroversial 
positions in an attempt to seize the middle ground, and they 
generally need to campaign less than their non-compulsory 
counterparts (Singh 2021). Critics contend this has made 
politics more stagnant and less responsive in compulsory 
systems.

secret ballot and electoral competition. The significance of such systems is, however, 
more difficult to determine. As Harrop and Miller (1987) explained, there are two 
contrasting views of the function of competitive elections. The conventional view is 
that elections are a mechanism through which politicians can be called to account 
and forced to introduce policies that somehow reflect public opinion. This emphasizes 
the bottom-up functions of elections: political recruitment, representation, making 
government, influencing policy and so on. On the other hand, a radical view of 
elections, developed by theorists such as Benjamin Ginsberg (1982), portrays them 
as a means through which governments and political elites can exercise control 
over their populations, making them more quiescent, malleable and, ultimately, 
governable. This view emphasizes top-down functions: building legitimacy, shaping 
public opinion and strengthening elites. In reality, however, elections have no single 
character; they are neither simply mechanisms of public accountability, nor a means 
of ensuring political control. Like all channels of political communication, elections 
are a ‘two-way street’ that provides the government and the people, the elite and 
the masses, with the opportunity to influence one another. The main functions of 
elections include the following:
 Recruiting politicians: In democratic states, elections are the principal source of 
political recruitment, taking account also of the processes through which parties 
nominate candidates. Democratic politicians thus tend to possess talents and skills 
that are related to electioneering, such as charisma (see pp. 87–88), oratorical skills 
and good looks, not necessarily those that suit them to carrying out constituency 
duties, serving on committees, running government departments, and so on. 
Elections are typically not used to fill posts that require specialist knowledge or 
experience, such as those in the civil service or judiciary.
 Making governments: Elections determine governments single-handedly only in 
states such as the USA, Russia and Venezuela, in which the political executive is 
directly elected. In parliamentary systems and some semi-presidential systems, 
elections only influence the formation of governments, most determinatively 
when the electoral system tends to give a single party a clear parliamentary 
majority. In systems or cases where elections do not produce any party or coalition 
with a clear majority, governments are formed through post-election deals, and 
those governments can be made and unmade without the need for an election. 
This is more common in systems where proportional representation is used (see 
p. 243) or where the electoral support is traditionally split between many parties. 
For instance, no party in the Netherlands had achieved an electoral majority since 
1894, meaning every election must be followed by extensive negotiations amongst 
parties to form a government.
 Influencing policy: Elections certainly deter governments from pursuing radical 
and deeply unpopular policies; however, only in exceptional cases, when a single 
issue dominates the election campaign, can they be said to influence policy directly. 
And short of the use of initiatives and the recall, the electorate has no effective 
means of ensuring that policy mandates are carried out, apart from its capacity 
to inflict punishment at the next election. It can also be argued that the range of 
policy options outlined in elections is typically so narrow that the result can be of 
only marginal policy significance. Others suggest that government policy is, in 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_10.indd 252 23-07-2024 12:48:10REPRESENTATION, ELECTIONS AND VOTING 253
any case, shaped more by practical dictates, such as the state of the economy, than 
it is by electoral considerations.
 Educating voters: The process of campaigning provides the electorate with 
an abundance of information, about parties, candidates, policies, the current 
government’s record, the political system and so on. However, this leads to 
education only if the information that is provided, and the way it is provided, 
engages public interest and stimulates debate, as opposed to apathy and alienation. 
As candidates and parties seek to persuade, rather than to educate, they also have 
a strong incentive to provide incomplete and distorted information.
 Building legitimacy: One reason why even authoritarian regimes bother to 
hold elections, even if they are non-competitive, is that elections help to foster 
legitimacy (see Chapter 3) by providing justification for a system of rule. This 
happens because the ritual involved in campaigning somehow confers on an 
election a ceremonial status and importance. Most importantly, by encouraging 
citizens to participate in politics, even in the limited form of voting, elections 
mobilize active consent.
 Strengthening elites: Elections can also be a vehicle through which elites can 
manipulate and control the masses. This possibility encouraged Pierre-Joseph 
Proudhon (see p. 429) to warn that ‘universal suffrage is counter-revolution’. 
Political discontent and opposition can be neutralized by elections that channel 
them in a constitutional direction and allow governments to come and go while the 
regime itself survives. Elections are particularly effective in this respect because, 
at the same time, they give citizens the impression that they are exercising power 
over the government.
Electoral systems: debates and controversies
An electoral system is a set of rules that governs the conduct of elections. Not only 
do these rules vary across the world; they are also, in many countries, the subject of 
fierce political debate and argument. These rules vary in a number of ways:
 Voters may be asked to choose between candidates or between parties.
 Voters may either select a single candidate, or vote preferentially, ranking the 
candidates they wish to support in order.
 The electorate may or may not be grouped into electoral units or constituencies.
 Constituencies may return a single member or a number of members.
 The level of support needed to elect a candidate varies from a plurality to an 
overall or ‘absolute’ majority, or a quota of some kind.
For general purposes, however, electoral systems available can be divided into two 
broad categories based on how they convert votes into seats. On the one hand, 
there are majoritarian systems (see p. 127), in which larger parties typically win a 
higher proportion of seats than the proportion of votes they gain in the election. 
This increases the chances of a single party gaining a majority in the legislature and 
being able to govern on its own. In the UK, for example, single-party government 
prevailed between 1945 and 2010 even though no party achieved more than 50 
per cent of the popular vote at any election during this period. On the other hand, 
there are proportional systems, which guarantee an equal (or, at least, more equal) 
Plurality: The largest 
number out of a 
collection of numbers, not 
necessarily an absolute 
majority (50 per cent or 
more of all the numbers 
combined).

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
SWITZERLAND: A SEMI-DIRECT DEMOCRACY?
Switzerland is one of the oldest constitutional democracies 
in the world. It is also one of the most unique and 
complicated, and its high degree of citizen input into its 
political system has led some scholars to identify it as 
perhaps the world’s only ‘semi-direct’ democracy.
In the first place, Switzerland does not have a singular head 
of state or head of government (see p. 347). Executive 
power is exercised collectively by the seven-member Swiss 
Federal Council, who are elected by the Federal Assembly. 
The chair of the council is rotated every year, but the 
position confers no particular power, and all decision-making 
is made by consensus. And although the Federal Council 
and the Federal Assembly are the elected representatives 
of the Swiss people and authorized to pass laws and run 
government, there are numerous mechanisms by which the 
public may also directly influence policy. In the first instance, 
any law passed by the legislature may be challenged in a 
nationwide vote if 50,000 signatures are collected within 
100 days. These are known as Optional Referendums. More 
than 200 federal laws have been challenged in this way, and 
nearly 50 per cent of them have been repealed because of 
an adverse public vote. A second type of referendum, the 
Mandatory Referendum, is triggered when the government 
wishes to modify the constitution, sign international treaties 
or introduce urgent legislation. And though the public 
cannot suggest laws directly, a third type of referendum, the 
Federal Popular Initiative, allows a national vote if 100,000 
signatures are collected in favour of an amendment to the 
Swiss constitution. Because there are few limitations on 
the form these can take, Federal Popular Initiatives have 
become a de facto means by which the Swiss public can 
pass laws. Between the three types of referendums, the 
Swiss public vote up to four times a year – from 2011 to 
2022 alone, 108 referendums were held. And that is not 
counting a wide array of democratic engagement at the local 
level as well. For instance, in the Canton of Glarus, with a 
population of approximately 12,000, all citizens are entitled 
to assemble in the main square every May and directly vote 
on the laws and budget for the canton. Any citizen may take 
the stage to argue their case, and any legislative proposal or 
constitutional amendment may be put to a public vote with 
the support of just one eligible voter.
The high degree of popular input into the political system 
encourages a strongly consensus-style of government in 
Switzerland. Because elected officials may readily have 
their decisions overturned, governments tend to engage in 
extensive public consultation and attempt to build a broad 
consensus before any law or policy is introduced. And polling 
has routinely found the Swiss have some of the highest rates 
of trust and satisfaction in government in the world.
But Swiss democracy is not without its critics. The 
emphasis on consensus can make change slow – for some, 
glacially so. Swiss Green parties, for instance, have grown 
significantly in recent years, exceeding 20 per cent of 
the vote for the Federal Assembly in 2019, yet have had 
minimal impact on policy and have not obtained a seat 
on the Federal Council due to lack of consensus from 
the other parties. And Switzerland was one of the last 
European nations to grant women’s suffrage. Because it 
required a majority of voters (that is, men) to approve such 
a change, it did not finally pass federally until 1971 (and in 
one canton, not until 1990).
Moreover, some scholars have argued that the ease with 
which the public can overturn legislation inhibits innovation 
and prevents change that may be unpopular but necessary. 
Tax reform, for instance, has been particularly difficult 
for the government to pass, and numerous attempts to 
do so have been overturned. At the same time, several 
controversial decisions have been made via referendum that 
highlight the tensions between majority rule and minority 
rights. In 2009, a citizen initiative to constitutionally ban 
the construction of minarets in Switzerland was passed, 
over the objections of the government and many experts, 
who saw the measure as incompatible with Swiss religious 
freedoms and minority rights.

relationship between the seats won by a party and the votes gained in the election. 
In a pure system of proportional representation (PR), a party that gains 45 per cent 
of the votes would win exactly 45 per cent of the seats. PR systems therefore make 
single-party majority rule less likely, and are commonly associated with multi-party 
systems and coalition government (see p. 292). The electoral systems described in 
the following Focus boxes range from the most majoritarian type of system to the 
purest type of proportional system.
Although in some countries the electoral system provokes little debate or interest, in 
others it is an issue of pressing political and constitutional significance. France, for 
instance, has changed its electoral system so many times that any statement about 
it runs the risk of being out of date. The second ballot (see p. 257), for instance, 
was abandoned for parliamentary elections in 1985, when France switched to a 
regional-list system (see p. 263), but it was reintroduced for the 1993 election. In the 
UK, the majoritarian single-member plurality (SMP) system (see p. 256) continues 
to be used for general elections; however, since 1999 more proportional systems 
have been introduced for elections to the devolved bodies in Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland. The confusing thing about electoral reform is that shifts reflect no 
consistent pattern. In 1993, while New Zealand adopted proportional representation 
in place of the SMP system, Italy moved in the opposite direction, replacing the 
party list with the less proportional additional member system (see p. 260), before, 
in 2005, returning to the list system.
Electoral systems attract attention, in part, because they have a crucial impact on party 
performance and, particularly, on their prospects of winning (or, at least, sharing) 
power. It would be foolish, then, to deny that attitudes towards the electoral system are 
shaped largely by party advantage. President Mitterrand’s twists and turns in France 
in the 1980s and 1990s were dictated mainly by his desire to strengthen Socialist 
representation in the National Assembly. Similarly, the UK Labour Party’s interest in 
electoral reform since the 1980s has waxed and waned according to whether it appeared 
that the party could win under SMP rules. The party’s conversion to PR for devolved 
bodies and its commitment in 1997 to holding a referendum on electoral reform for 
the House of Commons were, in part, a consequence of spending eighteen years in 
opposition. It is notable that Labour’s landslide victories in 1997 and 2001 coincided 
with declining interest in the party in changing Westminster elections. However, other 
less cynical and more substantial considerations need to be taken into account. The 
problem, though, is that there is no such thing as a ‘best’ electoral system.
The electoral reform debate is, at its core, a debate about the desirable nature of 
government and the principles that underpin ‘good’ government. Is representative 
government, for instance, more important than effective government? Is a bias in 
favour of compromise and consensus preferable to one that favours conviction and 
principle? These are normative questions that do not permit objective answers. 
Moreover, in view of the complex role they play, elections can be judged according 
to a diverse range of criteria, which not uncommonly contradict one another. 
Electoral systems therefore merit only a qualified endorsement, reflecting a balance 
of advantages over disadvantages and their strength relative to other systems. These 
criteria fall into two general categories: those related to the quality of representation, 
and those linked to the effectiveness of government.
CONCEPT
Proportional 
representation
Proportional 
representation is the 
principle that parties 
should be represented 
in a legislature in 
direct proportion 
to their overall 
electoral strength, 
their percentage of 
seats equalling their 
percentage of votes. The 
term is generally used 
to refer not to a single 
method of election but 
to a variety of electoral 
mechanisms, those able 
to secure proportional 
outcomes, or at least a 
high and reliable degree 
of proportionality. 
The best-known 
PR systems are the 
party-list system, the 
single-transferable￾vote system and the 
additional member 
system.

ELECTORAL SYSTEMS: SINGLE-MEMBER 
PLURALITY (SMP) SYSTEM
Used: The UK, the USA, Canada, Ethiopia, Malaysia and India, for example.
Type: Majoritarian.
Features:
 The country is divided into single-member constituencies, usually of equal size.
 Voters select a single candidate, usually marking his or her name with a cross on the ballot 
paper.
 The winning candidate needs only to achieve a plurality of votes.
Advantages:
 The system establishes a clear link between representatives and constituents, ensuring 
that constituency duties are carried out.
 It offers the electorate a clear choice of potential parties of government.
 It allows the formation of governments that have a clear mandate from the electorate, 
albeit often on the basis of plurality support amongst the electorate.
 It keeps extremism at bay by making it more difficult for small radical parties to gain seats 
and credibility.
 It makes for strong and effective government in that a single party usually has majority 
control of the legislature.
 It produces stable government, in that single-party governments rarely collapse as a 
result of disunity and internal friction.
Disadvantages:
 The system ‘wastes’ many (perhaps most) votes, those cast for losing candidates and 
those cast for winning ones over the plurality mark.
 It distorts electoral preferences by ‘under-representing’ small parties and ones with 
geographically evenly distributed support (the ‘third-party effect’).
 It offers only limited choice because of its duopolistic (two-major-parties) tendencies.
 It undermines the legitimacy of government, in that governments often enjoy only 
minority support, producing a system of plurality rule.
 Since a change in government can lead to a radical shift of priorities and direction, it can 
lead to a lack of policy continuity.
 It leads to unaccountable government in that the legislature is usually subordinate to the 
executive, because the majority of its members are supporters of the governing party.
 It discourages the selection of a socially broad spread of candidates in favour of those who 
are attractive to a large body of voters.

Majoritarian systems are usually thought to be at their weakest when they are 
evaluated in terms of their representative functions. To a greater or lesser extent, 
each majoritarian system distorts popular preferences, in the sense that party 
representation is not commensurate with electoral strength. This is most glaringly 
apparent in their ‘unfairness’ to small parties and parties with evenly distributed 
geographical support, and their ‘over-fairness’ in relation to large parties and those 
with geographically concentrated support. For example, at the 2021 Canadian 
elections, the Bloc Québécois, whose support is concentrated in the French￾speaking Quebec, won 32 seats with 7.64 per cent of the national vote. Yet the New 
Democratic Party (NDP), whose support is spread more evenly throughout the 
country, won just 25 seats, despite garnering more than double the vote with 17.82 
per cent nationally. The governing Liberal party, who at 32.62 per cent won a little 
less than twice as many votes as the NDP, nevertheless won six times as many seats 
with 160.

ELECTORAL SYSTEMS: SECOND-BALLOT SYSTEM
Used: Most common system used for electing heads of state globally, including the presidency 
of Russia, Iran and most Latin American and African nations. Some nations, like France, use it 
for both the president and members of the legislature.
Type: Majoritarian.
Features:
 There are single-candidate constituencies and single-choice voting, as in the single￾member plurality (SMP) system.
 To win on the first ballot, a candidate needs an overall majority of the votes cast.
 If no candidate gains a first-ballot majority, a second run-off ballot is held between the 
leading two candidates.
Advantages:
 The system broadens electoral choice: voters can vote with their hearts for their preferred 
candidate in the first ballot, and with their heads for the least-bad candidate in the second.
 As candidates can win only with majority support, they are encouraged to make their 
appeal as broad as possible.
 Strong and stable government is possible, as with SMP systems.
Disadvantages:
 As the system is little more proportional than the SMP system, it distorts preferences and 
is unfair to ‘third’ parties.
 Run-off candidates are encouraged to abandon their principles in search of short-term 
popularity, or as a result of deals with defeated candidates.
 The holding of a second ballot may strain the electorate’s patience and interest in politics.

Two-party systems and single-party government are thus ‘manufactured’ by the 
majoritarian bias of the electoral system, and do not reflect the distribution of popular 
preferences. Moreover, the fact that parties can come to power with barely two-fifths 
of the popular vote (in 2005 in the UK, for example, the Labour Party gained a 
House of Commons majority with 35.3 per cent of the vote) strains the legitimacy of 
the entire political system, and creates circumstances in which dominant parties can 
remain in power for prolonged periods with little pressure to broaden their appeal or 
incentive to work with or incorporate the views of the opposition. For instance, the 
Liberal Democratic Party has dominated Japanese politics since the Second World

ELECTORAL SYSTEMS: ALTERNATIVE VOTE (AV) 
SYSTEM
Used: Australia, Papua New Guinea and the US states of Maine and Alaska.
Type: Majoritarian.
Features:
 There are single-member constituencies.
 There is preferential voting. In AV, voters rank the candidates in order of preference: 1 for 
their first preference, 2 for their second preference and so on.
 Winning candidates must gain 50 per cent of all the votes cast.
 Votes are counted according to the first preferences. If no candidate reaches 50 per cent, 
the bottom candidate is eliminated and his or her votes are redistributed according to the 
second (or subsequent) preferences. This continues until one candidate has a majority.
Advantages:
 Fewer votes are ‘wasted’ than in the SMP system.
 Unlike the second-ballot system, the outcome cannot be influenced by deals made 
between candidates.
 The cost and delay of having to run a second ballot is avoided.
 Although winning candidates must secure at least 50 per cent support, single-party 
majority government is not ruled out.
Disadvantages:
 The system is not much more proportional than the SMP system, and so is still biased in 
favour of large parties.
 The outcome may be determined by the preferences of those who support small, possibly 
extremist, parties.
 Winning candidates may enjoy little first-preference support, and have only the virtue of 
being the least unpopular candidate available.

War, thanks to a plurality electoral system and lack of a unified opposition. The result 
has been decades of conservative, pro-Western and pro-business policies which have 
rarely been challenged politically, despite support for the LDP and its policies falling 
well below 40 per cent in some elections.
Looked at in this light, proportional electoral systems seem to be manifestly more 
representative. Nevertheless, it may be naive simply to equate electoral fairness with 
proportionality. For instance, much of the criticism of PR systems stems from the 
fact that they make coalition government (see p. 292) much more likely. Although 
it can be argued that, unlike single-party governments, coalitions enjoy the support 
of at least 50 per cent of the electors, their policies are typically thrashed out in 
post-election deals, and thus are not endorsed by any set of electors. An additional 
danger is that parties within a coalition government may not exert influence in 
line with their electoral strength. The classic example of this is when small centre 
parties (such as the Free Democrats in Germany) can dictate to larger parties (for 
example, the CDU or the SPD in Germany) by threatening to switch their support 
to another party.
The defence of majoritarian systems is more commonly based on government 
functions, and specifically on the capacity of such systems to deliver stable and 
effective rule. In other words, a lack of proportionality may simply be the price 
that is paid for strong government. In these systems, the bias in favour of single￾party rule means that the electorate can usually choose between two parties, each of 
which has the capacity to deliver on its election promises by translating its manifesto 
commitments into a programme of government. Supported by a cohesive majority 
in the legislature, such governments are usually able to survive for a full term in 
office. And a dominant party does not necessarily mean stagnation or a lack of 
political debate. Japan’s LDP is strongly factional, and within the party itself there is 
significant internal debate and power shifts that have generated policy change and 
new leadership (see pp. 288–289).
By contrast, coalition governments tend to be weak and unstable, in the sense that 
they are endlessly engaged in a process of reconciling opposing views and are always 
liable to collapse as a result of internal splits and divisions. The classic example here 
is post-1945 Italy which, up to 2023, has had no fewer than sixty-eight governments. 
Supporters of PR argue, on the other hand, that having a strong government, in the 
sense of a government that can push through policies, is by no means an unqualified 
virtue, tending as it does to restrict scrutiny and parliamentary accountability. 
Instead, they suggest that ‘strong’ government should be understood in terms of 
popular support, and the willingness of citizens to obey and respect the government. 
Broadly based coalitions may possess these qualities in greater abundance than 
do single-party governments. By the same token, ‘stable’ government could mean 
a consistent development of government policies over a number of governments, 
rather than a government with the ability to survive for a single electoral term. This 
is more likely to be achieved by coalition governments (in which one or more parties 
may remain in power over several governments, albeit re-shuffled) than by single￾party governments, in which more sweeping changes in personnel and priorities are 
unavoidable when power changes hands.

Type: Proportional.
Features:
 A proportion of seats (50 per cent in Germany, but more in Italy and South Korea, for 
instance) are filled by the SMP system using single-member constituencies.
 The remaining seats are filled using the party-list system (see p. 263).
 Electors cast two votes: one for a candidate in the constituency election, and the other 
for a party.
Advantages:
 The hybrid nature of this system balances the need for constituency representation 
against the need for electoral fairness. The party-list process ensures that the whole 
legislature is proportionally representative.
 Although the system is broadly proportional in terms of its outcome, it keeps alive the 
possibility of single-party government.
 It allows electors to choose a constituency representative from one party and yet support 
another party to form a government.
 It takes account of the fact that representing constituents and holding ministerial office 
are very different jobs that require very different talents and experience.
Disadvantages:
 The retention of single-member constituencies prevents the achievement of high levels 
of proportionality.
 The system creates two classes of representative, one burdened by insecurity and 
constituency duties, the other having higher status and the prospect of holding ministerial 
office.
 Constituency representation suffers because of the size of constituencies (generally, 
twice as large as in SMP systems).
 Parties become more centralized and powerful under this system, as they decide not only 
who has the security of being on the list and who has to fight constituencies, but also 
where on the list candidates are placed.

The electoral reform debate, however, constantly risks overestimating the 
importance of electoral systems. In practice, elections are only one amongst a 
variety of factors that shape the political process, and may not be the most crucial. 
Indeed, the impact of particular electoral systems is conditioned largely by other 
circumstances; namely, the political culture, the nature of the party system, and the 
economic and social context within which politics is conducted. Generalizations 
about the nature of coalition government are always highly suspect, for instance. 
Whereas coalitions in Italy have typically been weak and short-lived, in Germany 
they have usually produced stable and effective government. And yet, despite Italy’s 
famed political instability, often blamed on its now-abandoned party-list electoral 
system, in the post-Second World War period the north of the country at least 
experienced steady economic growth, making Italy, by the 1990s, the third most 
prosperous state in the EU.
What do elections mean?
The importance of elections cannot be doubted. At the very least, they provide the 
public with its clearest formal opportunity to influence the political process, and also 
help, directly or indirectly, to determine who will hold government power. From 
this perspective, elections are about results – in other words, who wins and who 
loses. This view is encouraged by media coverage, which, with the aid of opinion 
polls, increasingly turns elections into horseraces. Nevertheless, politicians are not 
backward in claiming that elections have a broader and more profound meaning. 
Elections are, in this sense, seen as nothing less than a visible manifestation of the 
public interest; in short, ‘the public has spoken’. Political commentators also express 
their opinions, proclaiming, for instance, that elections reflect a ‘shift in the popular 
mood’. The problem, however, is that all such claims and interpretations have

FOCUS ON . . . 
ELECTORAL SYSTEMS: SINGLE-TRANSFERABLE￾VOTE (STV) SYSTEM
Used: Ireland, Northern Ireland, Malta and Australia (Senate).
Type: Proportional.
Features:
 There are multimember constituencies, each of which usually returns between three and 
eight members.
 Parties may put forward as many candidates as there are seats to fill.
 Electors vote preferentially, as in the alternative vote system.
 Candidates are elected if they achieve a quota. This is the minimum number of votes 
needed to elect the stipulated number of candidates. Most STV systems use the Droop 
formula to determine the quota:
For example, if 100,000 votes are cast in a constituency that elects four members, the quota 
is 100,000/(4 + 1) + 1 = 20,001.
 The votes are counted according to first preferences. If not all the seats are filled, the 
bottom candidate is eliminated. His or her votes are redistributed according to second 
preferences and so on, until all the seats have been filled.
Advantages:
 The system is capable of achieving highly proportional outcomes.
 Competition amongst candidates from the same party means that they can be judged on 
their records and on where they stand on issues that cut across party lines.
 The availability of several members means that constituents can choose to whom to take 
their grievances.
Disadvantages:
 The degree of proportionality achieved varies, largely on the basis of the party system.
 STV is one of the most complex electoral systems. It can take a long time for the results 
to be calculated, and the system can be confusing for voters.
 In situations where there are many candidates or the vote is heavily fragmented, the results 
of STV can be unpredictable, depending on the order in which candidates are eliminated. 
In 2013, Ricky Muir, who only received 0.51 per cent of the vote, was nonetheless elected 
Australian Senator after twenty-three other minor parties were eliminated and their 
votes were transferred to him, allowing him to achieve the final quota.

FOCUS ON . . . 
ELECTORAL SYSTEMS: PARTY-LIST 
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION (LIST-PR) 
SYSTEM
Used: Many countries across Europe, Africa and Latin America, including Spain, Israel, 
Argentina, Belgium and the European Parliament.
Type: Proportional.
Features:
 Either the entire country is treated as a single constituency, or, in the case of regional 
party lists, there are a number of large multimember constituencies.
 Parties compile lists of candidates to place before the electorate, in descending order of 
preference.
 Electors vote for parties, not for candidates.
 Parties are allocated seats in direct proportion to the votes they gain in the election. They 
fill these seats from their party list.
 A ‘threshold’ may be imposed (5 per cent in Germany) to exclude small, possibly 
extremist, parties from representation.
Advantages:
 This is the only potentially pure system of proportional representation, and is therefore 
fair to all parties.
 The system promotes unity by encouraging electors to identify with their nation or region, 
rather than with a constituency.
 The system makes it easier for women and minority candidates to be elected, provided, of 
course, they feature on the party list.
 The representation of a large number of small parties ensures that there is an emphasis 
upon negotiation, bargaining and consensus.
Disadvantages:
 The existence of many small parties can lead to weak and unstable government and more 
frequent elections as a result.
 Post-election negotiations can produce governing coalitions that do not necessarily 
reflect the election results, and small parties can have outsized influence since they can 
be just as crucial as large ones to maintaining a governing majority.
 The link between representatives and constituencies is entirely broken.
 Parties become heavily centralized, because leaders draw up party lists, and junior 
members have an incentive to be loyal in the hope of moving up the list.

a strongly arbitrary character; any attempt to invest an election with ‘meaning’ is 
fraught with dangers. The people may have spoken, but it is frustratingly difficult to 
know what they have said.
Many of these problems stem from the difficult notion of the ‘public interest’. If such a 
thing as a public interest exists, it surely reflects the common or collective interests of all 
citizens. This is precisely what Rousseau (see p. 105) implied in the idea of the ‘general will’, 
which he understood to mean the will of all citizens, provided each of them acts selflessly.
The difficulty with this view is obvious. Quite simply, individuals do not, in practice, 
act selflessly in accordance with a general or collective will; there is no such thing as 
an indivisible public interest. All generalizations about ‘the public’ or ‘the electorate’ 
must therefore be treated with grave suspicion. Indeed, Walter Lippmann argued in 
The Phantom Public (1925) the very idea of a ‘public’ interest is an illusion. There 
is no electorate as such, only a collection of electors who each possess individual 
preferences, sympathies, allegiances and so on. Those preferences may not be 
particularly rational or considered and may be heavily influenced by prejudice 
and the media. At best, then, elections represent just a vague and likely distorted 
snapshot of public preferences at a brief moment in time – not, in Lippmann’s view, 
a reliable guide on which to base public policy.
The difficulty in interpreting election results lies in the perhaps impossible task of 
knowing why voters vote as they do. As is made clear in the next section, generations 
of political scientists have grappled with the question of electoral behaviour but have 
failed to develop a universally accepted theory of voting. Voting, on the surface a 
very simple act, is shaped by a complex set of factors, conscious and unconscious, 
rational and irrational, selfish and selfless. All theories are therefore partial and must 
be qualified by a range of other considerations. This can be seen in relation to the 
so-called ‘economic theory of democracy’, advanced by Anthony Downs (1957). This 
theory suggests that the act of voting reflects an expression of self-interest on the part of 
voters, who select parties in much the same way as consumers select goods or services 
for purchase. On this basis, the winning party in an election can reasonably claim that 
its policies most closely correspond to the interests of the largest group of voters.
On the other hand, it can be argued that, rather than ‘buying’ policies, voters are 
typically poorly informed about political issues and are influenced by a range of 
‘irrational’ factors such as habit, social conditioning, the image of the parties and 
the personalities of their leaders. Moreover, the ability of parties to attract votes may 
have less to do with the ‘goods’ they put up for purchase than with the way those 
goods are ‘sold’ through advertising, political campaigning, propaganda and so on. 
To the extent that this is true, election results may reflect not so much the interests of 
the mass of voters, as the resources and finances available to the competing parties.
A further – and, some would argue, more intractable – problem is that no elective 
mechanism may be able reliably to give expression to the multifarious preferences of 
voters. This is a problem that the US economist Kenneth Arrow described in terms 
of his ‘impossibility theorem’. In Social Choice and Individual Values (1951) Arrow 
drew attention to the problem of ‘transitivity’ that occurs when voters are allowed to 
express a range of preferences for candidates or policy options, rather than merely cast 
a single vote. The drawback of casting but a single vote is not only that it is a crude 
CONCEPT
Public interest
The public interest 
consists of the general 
or collective interests 
of a community; that is, 
that which is good for 
society as a whole. Two 
contrasting notions of 
the public interest can 
be identified. Strong 
versions distinguish 
clearly between the 
interests of the public 
as a collective body and 
the selfish or personal 
interests of each 
individual. In the view 
of Rousseau and many 
socialists, the interests 
of the public are 
‘higher’ than, or morally 
superior to, those of the 
individual. Weak versions 
recognize only private 
interests, and therefore 
see the public interest as 
nothing more than the 
sum of private interests.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_10.indd 264 23-07-2024 12:48:12REPRESENTATION, ELECTIONS AND VOTING 265
all-or-nothing device, but also that no single candidate or option may gain majority 
support. For instance, candidate A may gain 40 per cent of the vote, candidate B 34 
per cent and candidate C 26 per cent. The situation could, nevertheless, become more 
confused if second preferences were taken into account. Let us assume, for the sake of 
argument, that the second preferences of all candidate A’s supporters go to candidate C, 
the second preferences of candidate B favour candidate A and the second preferences 
of candidate C go to candidate B. This creates a situation in which each candidate 
can claim to be preferred by a majority of voters. The first and second preferences 
for candidate A add up to 74 per cent (40 per cent plus B’s 34 per cent). Candidate B 
can claim 60 per cent support (34 per cent plus C’s 26 per cent) and candidate C can 
claim 66 per cent support (26 per cent plus A’s 40 per cent). This problem of ‘cyclical 
majorities’ draws attention to the fact that it may not be possible to establish a reliable 
link between individual preferences and collective choices. In other words, election 
results cannot speak for themselves, and politicians and political commentators who 
claim to find meaning in them are, to some extent, acting arbitrarily.
Nevertheless, the latitude that this allows politicians is not unlimited, because they 
know that they will be called to account at the next election. In this light, perhaps 
the most significant function of elections is to set limits to arbitrary government 
by ensuring that politicians who claim to speak for the public must ultimately be 
judged by the public. And to that end, elections do seem to serve that purpose. David 
Mayhew in the landmark Congress: The Electoral Connection (1974) found that fear 
of losing re-election was the single most powerful influence on the behaviour of 
American legislators, and many studies have subsequently found this to be the case 
across most democracies. Indeed, perhaps elections work too well, as a common 
public complaint of politicians is that they are single-mindedly focused on seeking 
re-election rather than governing.
VOTING BEHAVIOUR
The growth of academic interest in voting behaviour coincided with the rise of 
behavioural political science. As the most widespread and quantifiable form of 
political behaviour, voting quickly became the focus for new techniques of sample 
surveying and statistical analysis. The American Voter (Campbell et al. 1960), the 
product of painstaking research by the University of Michigan, became the leading 
work in the field and stimulated a wealth of similar studies, such as Butler and Stokes’ 
Political Change in Britain (1969). At the high point of the behavioural revolution, it 
was thought that voting held the key to disclosing all the mysteries of the political 
system, perhaps allowing for laws of mass political psychology to be developed. 
Even though these lofty hopes have not been fulfilled, psephology (the scientific 
study of voting behaviour) still commands a central position in political analysis. 
This is because voting provides one of the richest sources of information about the 
interaction between individuals, society and politics. By investigating the mysteries 
of voting behaviour, we are thus able to learn important lessons about the nature of 
the political system, and gain insight into the process of social and political change.
Voting behaviour is clearly shaped by short-term and long-term influences. Short￾term influences are specific to a particular election and do not allow conclusions to be 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_10.indd 265 23-07-2024 12:48:12266 POLITICS
drawn about voting patterns in general. The chief short-term influence is the state of 
the economy, which reflects the fact that there is usually a link between a government’s 
popularity and economic variables such as unemployment, inflation and disposable 
income. Optimism about one’s own material circumstances appears to be particularly 
crucial here. Indeed, it is often alleged that governments attempt to create pre￾election booms, or introduce carefully timed tax cuts and benefit increases, in the 
hope of improving their chances of gaining re-election. The chances that political and 
business cycles can be brought into conjunction are clearly strengthened by flexible￾term elections that allow the government to choose when to ‘go to the country’. 
Another short-term influence on voting is the personality and public standing of 
party leaders. This is particularly important because media exposure portrays leaders 
as the brand image of their party. This means that a party may try to rekindle popular 
support by replacing a leader who is perceived to be an electoral liability. Another 
factor is the style and effectiveness of the parties’ electoral campaigning. The length of 
the campaign can vary from about three weeks for flexible-term elections to up to two 
years in the case of fixed-term elections, such as those for the US president. Opinion 
polls are usually thought to be significant in this respect, either giving a candidate’s 
or party’s campaign momentum, or instilling disillusionment, or even complacency, 
amongst voters. A final short-term influence, the media (see Chapter 9), may also 
be of long-term significance if biased or partisan coverage reflects structural, and 
therefore continuing, factors such as press ownership. However, the pattern of media 
coverage may change from election to election. For instance, under Tony Blair’s 
leadership, the UK Labour Party made concerted attempts to secure the support of 
the traditionally conservative-supporting Murdoch newspapers, helping to explain 
the party’s longest period in power, between 1997 and 2010.
All such considerations, nevertheless, operate within a context of psychological, 
sociological, economic and ideological influences on voting. These are best examined 
in relation to rival models of voting. The most significant of these are the following:
 the party-identification model
 the sociological model
 the rational-choice model
 the dominant-ideology model.
Theories of voting
Party-identification model
The earliest theory of voting behaviour, the party-identification model, is based on 
the sense of psychological attachment that people have to parties. Electors are seen 
as people who identify with a party, in the sense of being long-term supporters who 
regard the party as ‘their’ party. Voting is therefore a manifestation of partisanship, 
not a product of calculation influenced by factors such as policies, personalities, 
campaigning and media coverage. This model places heavy stress on early political 
socialization (see p. 224), seeing the family as the principal means through which 
political loyalties are forged. These are, then, in most cases, reinforced by group 
membership and later social experiences. Many political parties had their origins 
in representing specific socio-economic groups, which in turn encouraged in-group 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_10.indd 266 23-07-2024 12:48:12REPRESENTATION, ELECTIONS AND VOTING 267
political loyalty passed down through families and community identity. Sweden’s 
Centre Party, for instance, began as an agrarian movement, with generations of rural 
farmers loyally supporting the party at successive elections.
In this model, attitudes towards policies and leaders, as well as perceptions about 
group and personal interests, tend to be developed on the basis of party identification. 
This partisan alignment tends to create stability and continuity, especially in terms of 
habitual patterns of voting behaviour, often sustained over a lifetime. From this point 
of view, it should be possible to calculate the ‘normal’ vote of a party by reference 
to partisanship levels. Deviations from this ‘normal’ level presumably reflect the 
impact of short-term factors.
One of the weaknesses of this model is the growing evidence from a number of 
countries of partisan dealignment. This indicates a general fall in party identification 
and a decline in habitual voting patterns. Where once the Centre Party drew support 
nearly exclusively from Swedish farmers, it today has a much more diverse support 
base and campaigns as a broadly centrist party, with some of its highest vote share 
now coming from urban districts. The rise of independent and small parties in many 
democracies also provides some evidence of diminishing partisan identification.
Sociological model
The sociological model links voting behaviour to group membership, suggesting 
that electors tend to adopt a voting pattern that reflects the economic and social 
position of the group to which they belong. Rather than developing a psychological 
attachment to a party on the basis of family influence, this model highlights the 
importance of a social alignment, reflecting the various divisions and tensions within 
society. The most significant of these divisions are class, gender, ethnicity, religion 
and region. Although the impact of socialization (see p. 224) is not irrelevant to this 
model, social-base explanations allow for rationality insofar as group interests may 
help to shape party allegiances. For many analysts, the sociological model is best 
understood as an ‘interest plus socialization’ approach to voting (Denver et al. 2012). 
This has perhaps been clearest in relation to social class (see p. 194).
Not uncommonly, party systems have been seen to reflect the class system, with the 
middle classes providing the electoral base for right-wing parties, and the working 
classes providing the electoral base for left-wing parties. The Labour–Conservative 
two-party system in the UK was traditionally understood in precisely this light. 
Peter Pulzer (1967) was able to declare, famously, ‘class is the basis of British party 
politics; all else is embellishment and detail’. The sociological model, however, has 
been attacked on the grounds that, in focusing on social groups, it ignores the 
individual and the role of personal self-interest. Moreover, there is growing empirical 
evidence that the link between sociological factors and party support has weakened 
in modern societies. In particular, attention has been paid to the phenomenon of 
class dealignment (see p. 269). Evidence of class dealignment can be found in most 
Western societies. For example, absolute class voting (the proportion of voters who 
support their ‘natural’ class party) fell in the UK from 66 per cent in 1966 to 47 per 
cent in 1983. In 1997, the Labour Party, for the first time, received more votes from 
non-manual workers than from manual workers.
CONCEPT
Partisan 
dealignment
Partisan dealignment 
is a decline in the 
extent to which people 
align themselves with 
a party by identifying 
with it. This implies that 
the ‘normal’ support 
of parties falls, and 
a growing number 
of electors become 
‘floating’ or ‘swing’ 
voters. As party loyalties 
weaken, electoral 
behaviour becomes 
more volatile, leading to 
greater uncertainty and, 
perhaps, the rise of new 
parties, or the decline of 
old ones. The principal 
reasons for partisan 
dealignment are the 
expansion of education, 
increased social mobility 
and growing reliance on 
television as a source of 
political information.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_10.indd 267 23-07-2024 12:48:12268 POLITICS
Rational-choice model
Rational-choice models of voting shift attention onto the individual, and away 
from socialization and the behaviour of social groups. In this view, voting is seen 
as a rational act, in the sense that individual electors are believed to decide their 
party preference on the basis of personal self-interest. Rather than being habitual, a 
manifestation of broader attachments and allegiances, voting is seen as essentially 
instrumental; that is, as a means to an end. Rational-choice models differ in that 
some, following the example of V. O. Key (1966), see voting as a retrospective 
comment on the party in power and how its performance has influenced citizen’s 
choice. Others, such as Himmelveit et al. (1985), portray voters as active, in the 
sense that they behave like consumers expressing a choice amongst the available 
policy options.
The latter view stresses the importance of what is called ‘issue voting’ and suggests 
that parties can significantly influence their electoral performance by revising 
and reshaping their policies. It is generally accepted that this has been one of the 
consequences of partisan and class dealignment. This has also been encouraged by 
the pluralism and individualism that postmaterialism (see p. 221) has fostered. The 
weakness of rational-choice theories is that they abstract the individual voter from 
his or her social and cultural context. In other words, to some extent, the ability 
to evaluate issues and calculate self-interest (the essence of instrumental voting) is 
structured by broader party attachments and group loyalties.
Issue voting: Voting 
behaviour that is shaped 
by party policies and 
(usually) a calculation of 
personal self-interest.
A farmer votes in the 2019 elections in El Salvador. Rural voters have traditionally 
formed a distinctive and reasonably unified bloc of voters in many democracies. 
In some countries, specifically farmer or country parties have formed to represent 
these voters and their issues.

Dominant-ideology model
Radical theories of voting tend to highlight the degree to which individual choices are 
shaped by a process of ideological manipulation and control. In some respects, such 
theories resemble the sociological model, in that voting is seen to reflect a person’s 
position in a social hierarchy. Where these theories differ from the sociological 
model, however, is in emphasizing that how groups and individuals interpret their 
position depends on how it has been presented to them through education, by the 
government and, above all, by the media. (The influence of the media on political 
debate and party competition is examined in greater detail in Chapter 9.)
In contrast to the earlier view that the media merely reinforce pre-existing preferences, 
this suggests that the media are able to distort the flow of political communications, 
both by setting the agenda for debate and by structuring preferences and sympathies. 
The consequence of this is that, if voters’ attitudes conform to the tenets of a dominant 
ideology, parties will not be able to afford to develop policies that fall outside that 
ideology. In this way, far from challenging the existing distribution of power and 
resources in society, the electoral process tends to uphold it. The weakness of the 
dominant-ideology model is that, by overstating the process of social conditioning, 
it takes individual calculation and personal autonomy out of the picture altogether.
The wide variety of theories and models regarding elections and voting behaviour is 
testament to the fact that elections, far from being the decisive statements of public 
interest we might imagine them, are in fact complex and sometimes poorly understood 
affairs. Moreover, despite vast sums invested by parties and news organizations to 
poll public opinion with increasingly sophisticated techniques, even in the twenty￾first century elections are unpredictable and their results sometimes difficult to 
decipher. Nevertheless, they are undoubtedly the cornerstone of democratic politics, 
and the most significant way in which the public can participate in and influence 
their government and the political system.
CONCEPT
Class dealignment
Class dealignment is 
the weakening of the 
relationship between 
social class and party 
support. Social class 
may nevertheless remain 
a significant (even the 
most significant) factor 
influencing electoral 
choice. The impact of 
dealignment has been 
to undermine traditional 
class-based parties 
(notably, working-class 
parties of the left), 
often bringing about a 
realignment of the party 
system. Explanations 
of class dealignment 
usually focus on changes 
in the social structure 
that have weakened the 
solidaristic character of 
class identity, such as 
postindustrialism.

CHAPTER 11
PARTIES AND 
PARTY SYSTEMS
PREVIEW
So fundamental are political parties to the operation of modern politics that their role and significance are often 
taken for granted. Yet parties as we know them are a relatively recent invention. As political machines organized to 
win elections and wield government power, parties came into existence only in the early nineteenth century. Now, 
however, they are virtually ubiquitous. The only parts of the world in which they do not exist are those where they 
are suppressed by dictatorship or military rule. Quite simply, the political party has become the central organizing 
principle of modern politics. Political parties are the vital link between the state and civil society, between the 
institutions of government and the groups and interests that operate within society. However, parties are by no 
means all alike. Not only do they differ in terms of organizational structure and ideological orientation, but they 
also carry out different roles within a political system. Political parties have thus been both lauded as the great tools 
of democracy and criticized as a source of tyranny and repression. Their impact, moreover, is crucially influenced 
by what is known as the party system, the network of relationships between and among parties, structured by the 
number of parties in existence. One-party systems operate very differently from competitive party systems, but 
there are also important contrasts between two-party and multi-party systems. Nevertheless, parties and party 
systems have increasingly come under attack. They have been blamed for failing to articulate the new and more

PARTY POLITICS
Political parties are found in nearly all political systems. Parties may be authoritarian 
or democratic; they may seek power through elections or through revolution; and 
they may espouse ideologies of the left, right or centre. Or they may disavow political 
ideas altogether. However, parties of some kind exist from Brazil to Burundi and from 
Norway to New Zealand. The development of political parties and the acquisition 
of a party system came to be recognized as a mark of political modernization. By 
the late 1950s, some 80 per cent of the world’s states were ruled by political parties. 
During the 1960s and early 1970s, however, a decline set in, with the spread of 
military rule in the developing world. Political parties were accused of being divisive, 
and in the developing world, of failing to solve entrenched problems such as poverty, 
corruption and ethnic conflict. They also proved to be inconvenient for economic 
and military elites. The upsurge of democratization (see p. 135) since the 1980s 
has, nevertheless, led to a renewed flourishing of parties. In Asia, Africa and Latin 
America, the relaxation or collapse of military rule was invariably accompanied by 
the re-emergence of political parties. In former communist states, one-party rule was 
replaced by the establishment of competitive party systems.
It would be a mistake, however, to assume that parties have always been with us. 
Political parties are part of the structure of mass politics, ushered in by the advent 
of representative government and the progressive extension of the franchise during 
the nineteenth century. Until then, what were called ‘factions’ (see p. 284) or ‘parties’ 
were little more than groups of like-minded politicians, usually formed around a 
key leader or family. So-called ‘court’ parties, for instance, often developed within 
autocratic monarchies out of a struggle for influence amongst notables and advisers. 
Thus, when Edmund Burke (see p. 37) in the late eighteenth century described a 
party as ‘a body of men united … upon some particular principle upon which they 
all agree’, he was thinking about fluid and informal groupings such as the Whigs and 
the Tories, and not about the organized and increasingly disciplined machines into 
which they were to develop.
Parties of the modern kind first emerged in the USA. This is in spite of the fact 
that Thomas Jefferson (see p. 277), James Madison (see p. 384) and several other 
‘founding fathers’ of the US Constitution portrayed parties in deeply negative terms, 
seeing them as a source of discord and political regimentation. Nevertheless, the 
Federalist Party (later the Whigs and, from 1860, the Republican Party) appeared 
as a mass-based party during the US presidential election of 1800. Most liberal 
and conservative parties started life as legislative factions – groups of like-minded 
politicians who negotiated and voted as a bloc to wield greater power. However, as the 
voting franchise expanded in mid-nineteenth century, parties were forced to appeal 
to an ever-widening electorate, and they began to develop a broader machinery of 
constituency branches, permanent staff, fundraising and so on to support party 
efforts to engage with voters and campaign during elections. In contrast, socialist 
parties and parties representing religious, ethnic and language groups were invariably 
born as social movements, or interest groups, operating outside government. 
Subsequently, they developed into organized political parties with hopes of winning 
formal representation and shaping public policy. By the beginning of the twentieth 
century, parties and party systems had, in effect, become the political manifestation 
of the social and other cleavages that animated society at large.
CONCEPT
Political party
A political party is a 
group of people that 
is organized for the 
purpose of winning 
government power, 
by electoral or other 
means. Parties typically 
exhibit the following 
characteristics. (1) 
They aim to exercise 
government power 
by winning political 
office (small parties 
may nevertheless use 
elections more to gain 
a platform than to win 
power). (2) They are 
organized bodies with 
a formal membership. 
(3) They typically 
adopt a broad issue 
focus, addressing each 
of the major areas of 
government policy 
(small parties, however, 
may have a single￾issue focus). (4) To 
varying degrees, they 
are united by shared 
political preferences 
and a general ideological 
identity.

Classifying parties
Parties take many different forms, and there have been many different schemas 
developed to help categorize and make sense of political parties. Three of the most 
important aspects of classifying parties include:
 their ideological leanings, i.e. left-wing versus right-wing parties
 how they recruit members, i.e. cadre versus mass parties
 how they seek to obtain power, i.e. constitutional versus revolutionary parties.
Left- and right-wing parties
One of the oldest, and for many voters, most important characteristics of a party 
is its ideological leaning. While there are many specific ideologies a party might 
adhere to (as covered in Chapter 2), broadly speaking, most parties can be labelled 
as either broadly left-wing or right-wing (see p. 274). Left-wing parties, sometimes 
termed ‘progressive’, are characterized by a commitment to change, in the form of 
either social reform or wholesale economic transformation. These have traditionally 
drawn their support from the ranks of the poor and the working classes, though 
increasingly in developed countries they draw support from urban voters and the 
educated middle classes. Right-wing parties, often termed ‘conservative’, generally 
uphold the existing social order and are, in that sense, a force for continuity. Their 
biggest supporters have traditionally included business interests and the materially 
contented middle classes, but increasingly rural, religious and working-class voters 
have been attracted to right-wing politics.
The left/right classification is pervasive in how people perceive and discuss politics, 
and in highly polarized political systems the divide between the two can be appear 
very rigid. And most voters, even those who describe themselves as ‘independents’ 
or ‘moderates’, tend to express views and vote consistently towards one side of 
politics (Drutman 2019). Nevertheless, the left/right party divide is simplistic and 
often misleading, and it is not unusual for voters and parties alike to adopt ideas 
and polices from across the political spectrum. The Netherlands People’s Party for 
Freedom and Democracy (VVD), for instance, is avowedly pro-capitalist and typically 
considered on the right wing of the politics due to its economic and security policies. 
However, it is also pro-euthanasia, pro-choice, pro-internationalism and supports 
universal health care, all positions traditionally seen as left-wing. Moreover, the shift 
away from old class polarities and the emergence of new political issues such as the 
environment, animal rights and feminism has challenged and perhaps rendered the 
conventional typologies of left and right increasingly redundant (Giddens 1994).
Cadre and mass parties
The term cadre party originally meant a ‘party of notables’ that were dominated 
by group of leaders who saw little point in building up a mass organization. Such 
parties developed out of parliamentary factions at a time when the franchise was 
limited. However, the term `cadre’ is now more commonly used to denote trained 
and professional party members who are expected to exhibit a high level of political 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_11.indd 273 23-07-2024 17:42:35274 POLITICS
FOCUS ON . . . 
THE LEFT/RIGHT DIVIDE
The left–right political spectrum is a shorthand method of describing political ideas and 
beliefs, summarizing the ideological positions of politicians, parties and movements. Its origins 
date back to the French Revolution – at the first meeting of the French Estates-General 
in 1789, traditionalists who supported the king sat on right of the chamber, while those who 
supported revolutions sat on the left. The terms ‘left’ and ‘right’ do not have exact meanings, 
however. In a narrow sense, the linear political spectrum (see Figure 11.1) summarizes different 
attitudes to the economy and the role of the state: left-wing views support intervention and 
collectivism, right-wing views favour the market and individualism. This supposedly reflects 
deeper ideological or value differences, as listed below:
Left Liberty Authority Right
Equality Hierarchy
Fraternity Order
Rights Duties
Progress Tradition
Reform Reaction
Internationalism Nationalism
An alternative, horseshoe-shaped political spectrum (see Figure 11.2) was devised in the post￾Second World War period to highlight the totalitarian and monistic (anti-pluralist) tendencies 
of both fascism and communism, by contrast with the alleged tolerance and openness of 
mainstream creeds. Those, like Hans Eysenck (1964), who have developed a two-dimensional 
political spectrum (see Figure 11.3) have tried to compensate for the crudeness and 
inconsistencies of the conventional left–right spectrum by adding a vertical authoritarian–
libertarian one. This enables positions on economic organization to be disentangled from those 
related to civil liberty.
Regardless of the scheme used to map political values, the meaning of ‘left’ and ‘right’ are not 
fixed in politics, and which values are associated with which end of the spectrum may vary 
greatly between historical and cultural contexts (Bobbio 1997).
Communism Socialism Liberalism Conservatism Fascism

commitment and doctrinal discipline. The distinguishing feature thus of cadre 
parties is their relatively restrictive membership requirements, and their reliance on a 
politically active elite or ‘cadres’ (usually subject to quasi-military discipline) that can 
offer ideological leadership to the masses. Most communist parties have traditionally 
adopted this model, but other ideologically driven parties, like the German and 
Italian fascist parties, and some Islamic parties, have also adopted similar structures.
A mass party, on the other hand, places a heavy emphasis on broadening membership 
and constructing a wide electoral base. Although the extension of the franchise forced 
liberal and conservative parties to seek a mass appeal, the earliest examples of mass 
parties were European socialist parties, such as the German Social Democratic Party 
and the UK Labour Party, which constructed organizations specifically designed to

mobilize working-class support. The key feature of such parties is that they place 
heavier stress on recruitment and organization than on ideology and political 
conviction. Although such parties often have formally democratic organizations, 
except for a minority of activists, membership usually entails little in the way of 
participation and only general agreement about principles and goals.
Many modern parties fall into the category of what Otto Kirchheimer (1966) termed 
‘catch-all parties’, sometimes also called ‘big tent’ parties. These are parties that 
drastically simplify their ideological programmes in order to appeal to the largest 
possible number of voters. Kirchheimer noted that in Germany in the post-war 
period, the major political parties like the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) were 
progressively dispensing with ideological constancy in favour of broadening their 
appeal, and that politics was becoming less about ideas and values and more about 
management of the state. Many once socialist political parties have similarly dropped 
much of their founding ideology to become more electorally competitive. They are 
not a purely contemporary development, however – the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI), which governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000, largely avoided any fixed 
ideology, embracing whatever policies seemed expedient to maintain its dominant 
electoral position. Supporters argue that such parties are pragmatic, guided by ‘what 
works’ rather than abstract ideologies.
Sigmund Neumann (1956) offers another way to think about the goals of mass 
parties and cadre parties – mass parties might be described as ‘representative’ parties, 
insofar as their mission is to reflect public opinion and respond to the concerns of the 
electorate, while cadre parties are ‘integrative’ as they seek to shape public opinion 
and mobilize the public towards a certain end. But as with any schema to categorize 
parties, the lines are not always that clear-cut. Though the German Nazi party was 
undoubtedly elite-driven and ideologically focused, its leaders were keenly aware of 
public opinion and often adopted populist policies to attract broader support. And 
mass parties can at times adopt a more integrative stance – under Margaret Thatcher, 
the UK Conservative Party embraced ‘conviction politics’ in pursuing a mobilizing 
strategy based on firm support for cutting taxes, encouraging enterprise, promoting 
individual responsibility, tackling trade union power and so forth.
Constitutional and revolutionary parties
Parties can also differ in their strategies for gaining power. Constitutional parties 
acknowledge the rights and entitlements of other parties and, thus, operate within 
a framework of rules and constraints. They acknowledge that there is a division 
between the party and the state, between the party in power (the government of 
the day) and state institutions (the bureaucracy, judiciary, police and so on) that 
enjoy formal independence and political neutrality. Above all, constitutional parties 
acknowledge and respect the rules of electoral competition. They recognize that they 
can be voted out of power as easily as they can be voted in. Mainstream parties in 
liberal democracies all have such a constitutional character.
Revolutionary parties, on the other hand, are anti-system or anti-constitutional parties, 
either of the left or of the right. Such parties aim to seize power and overthrow the 
existing constitutional structure using tactics that range from outright insurrection 
Big tent: A type of party 
that tolerates a broad 
spectrum of beliefs 
amongst its membership 
and focuses on maximizing 
its electoral appeal.

and popular revolution to the quasi-legalism practised by the Fascists. In some cases, 
revolutionary parties are formally banned by being classified as ‘extremist’ or ‘anti￾democratic’. When such parties win power, however, they invariably become ‘ruling’ 
or regime parties, suppressing rival parties and establishing a permanent relationship 
with the state machinery. In one-party systems, regardless of the ideology it was 
created to serve, the distinction between the party and the state is so weakened that 
the ‘ruling’ party, in effect, substitutes itself for the government, creating a fused 
‘party–state’ apparatus. It was common in the USSR, for instance, for the General 
Secretary of the CPSU to act as the chief executive or head of government without 
bothering to assume a formal state post.
Genuinely revolutionary parties are now a rarity; however, populists parties, with 
their anti-establishment character and sometimes casual attitude towards rules 
and norms, share characteristics with revolutionary parties. After all, populists 
also challenge the authority of a political establishment deemed to be deceitful, 
arrogant and self-serving, and claim the only legitimate source of political and 
moral authority rests with ‘the people’ (Norris and Inglehart 2019). Parties such 
as the French National Rally (formerly the National Front), the Danish People’s 
Party, Jobbik in Hungary and Poland’s Law and Justice Party have thus been dubbed 
anti-party parties. This gives rise to a form of politics that tends to have a combative, even 
insurrectionary, character. Populist parties also reject conventional politics’ obsession 
with the centre ground in favour of a more narrowly focused electoral and political 
strategy. For example, right-wing populist parties, which account for the majority of 
populist parties worldwide, target people who have been ‘left behind’ by contemporary 
society, especially those who have been disadvantaged by the onset of globalization 
(see p. 95). This includes people who have suffered from economic grievances such as 
stagnant living standards and job insecurity, and those whose sense of social esteem has 
been undermined by, for instance, the changing role of women, the spread of minority 
rights and the general advance of liberal values. Finally, if they achieve power, populist 
parties differ from mainstream ones in their desire to dismantle ‘politics as normal’. This 
is particularly the case when they seek to subvert safeguards on executive power, such as 
institutional checks and balances, judicial independence and the rule of law.

THOMAS JEFFERSON (1743–1826)
US political philosopher and statesman. A wealthy Virginian planter who was Governor of 
Virginia 1779–81, Jefferson served as the first US Secretary of State, 1789–94. He was the 
third president of the USA, 1801–9. Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of 
Independence and wrote a vast number of addresses and letters. He developed a democratic 
form of agrarianism that sought to blend a belief in rule by a natural aristocracy with a 
commitment to limited government and laissez-faire, sometimes called Jeffersonianism. He 
also demonstrated sympathy for social reform, favouring the extension of public education, 
the abolition of slavery and greater economic equality.

Functions of parties
Although political parties form primarily to fill political offices and wield the power 
of government, they serve a much broader and more complex set of functions within 
a political system. Their main functions can be summarized follows:
 representation
 elite formation and recruitment
 goal formulation
 interest articulation and aggregation
 socialization and mobilization
 organization of government.
Representation
Representation (see p. 243) is often seen as the primary function of parties. It refers to 
the capacity of parties to respond to and articulate the views of both the members and 
the voters. In the language of systems theory, political parties are major ‘inputting’ 
devices that ensure that government heeds the needs and wishes of the larger society. 
Clearly, this is a function that is best carried out, some would say only carried out, in 
an open and competitive system that forces parties to respond to popular preferences. 
Rational-choice theorists, following Anthony Downs (1957), explain this process by 
suggesting that the political market parallels the economic market, in that politicians 
act essentially as entrepreneurs seeking votes, meaning that parties behave very 
much like businesses. Power thus ultimately resides with the consumers, the voters. 
This ‘economic model’ can, however, be criticized on the grounds that parties seek to 
‘shape’ or mobilize public opinion, as well as respond to it; that the image of voters as 
well-informed, rational and issue-orientated consumers is questionable; and that the 
range of consumer (or electoral) choice is often narrow.
Elite formation and recruitment
Parties of all kinds are responsible for providing states with their political leaders. 
In most democratic systems, politicians achieve office by virtue of their party post: 
contestants in a presidential election are usually party leaders (whether formally 
or de facto), while in parliamentary systems the leader of the largest party in the 
legislature normally becomes prime minister. Cabinet and other ministerial posts are 
usually filled by senior party figures as well.
Those party leaders usually have long careers within their parties, perhaps 
serving a variety of junior posts before taking the top job. Parties therefore often 
provide a training ground for politicians, equipping them with skills, knowledge 
and experience; and offering them some form of career structure, albeit one that 
depends on the fortunes of the party. Parties may directly recruit candidates for 
elections or seats on the basis of their talent or public profile. Prime Minister of 
Denmark Mette Frederiksen, for example, started her political career in the youth 
wing of the Social Democrats in the 1990s. Her talent, passion and hard work as a 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_11.indd 278 23-07-2024 17:42:38PARTIES AND PARTY SYSTEMS 279
campaigner were noticed, and she was recruited by the party to run for a seat in the 
2001 election. Winning the seat, Frederiksen was then selected by the party to act 
as a spokesperson on culture and gender issues, where she gained a reputation for 
her frankness and gained public notice for her bold proposals. Her growing profile, 
experience and popularity led to further promotions – she served as deputy leader 
of her party, Minister of Employment and then Minister of Justice before becoming 
leader of the party and then prime minister in 2019.
On the other hand, the stranglehold that parties exert over government offices 
can be criticized for ensuring that political leaders are drawn from a relatively 
small pool of talent: the senior figures in a handful of major parties. For example, 
given that Frederiksen has spent nearly her entire career as an operative within the 
Social Democrat party, she is a case of what some have called ‘career politicians’, 
a phenomenon sometimes critiqued as lacking broader occupational experience 
and for being unrepresentative of the public at large (Allen et al. 2020). In some 
systems, however, like the USA and Chile, the stranglehold of parties in nominating 
the political elite has been weakened by primary elections, which reduce the control 
that a party has over the process of candidate selection and allow genuine outsiders 
to enter the political system.
Goal and policy formulation
Political parties have traditionally been one of the means through which societies 
set collective goals and mobilize so that they are carried out. Parties play this role 
because, in the process of seeking power, they formulate programmes for government 
with a view to attracting popular support. Not only does this mean that parties are a 
major source of policy initiation, it also encourages them to formulate coherent sets 
of policy options that give the electorate a choice amongst realistic and achievable 
goals.
Most political parties will adopt a central manifesto or platform that identifies the key 
policy initiatives it wishes to pursue. Parties often hold conventions or conferences at 
frequent intervals which allow internal debate on the platform and for new promises 
and ideas to be adopted.
Nevertheless, the tendency towards de-ideologized catch-all parties, and the fact 
that electoral campaigns increasingly stress personality and image over policies and 
issues, has generally reduced the impact that parties have on policy formulation. 
Party programmes, moreover, are almost certain to be modified by pressure from the 
civil service and interest groups, as well as in the light of domestic and international 
circumstances.
Despite widespread cynicism around the ‘promises’ made by politicians, studies 
have found that party platforms tend to be reliable predictors of politician behaviour 
in office, and most parties will attempt to deliver on their platforms (Payne 2013). 
Whether a party can truly implement their promises is another matter, though, 
depending on their degree of political strength in office and that of competing parties 
and interests. Moreover, implementation is usually carried out by bureaucracies 
rather than parties and can be a slow and complex process – what sounds good as 
CONCEPT
Primary election
A primary election is 
an intra-party election 
in which candidates 
are selected to contest 
a subsequent ‘official’ 
election. During the 
twentieth century, 
primaries became the 
principal nominating 
device used in the 
USA, also being used 
to choose convention 
delegates and party 
leaders. Most US states 
hold ‘closed’ primaries, 
in which participation is 
restricted to registered 
supporters of the party; 
‘open’ primaries allow 
all voters to participate, 
regardless of party 
affiliation. Primary 
elections give rank￾and-file voters more of 
a voice in party affairs 
and lead to a more 
candidate-orientated 
and less party-orientated 
style of politics.
Party platform: The 
formal set of goals, values 
and priorities for a political 
party which it campaigns 
on and promises to enact 
if elected to office.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_11.indd 279 23-07-2024 17:42:38280 POLITICS
a single line on a party platform can take considerable time and resources to put 
into effect. (The bureaucracy and its role in policy implementation is explored in 
Chapter 16.)
Interest articulation and aggregation
In the process of developing collective goals, parties also help to articulate and 
aggregate the various interests found in society. Parties, indeed, often develop as 
vehicles through which business, labour, religious, ethnic or other groups advance 
and defend their various interests. Socialist and labour parties, for instance, were 
established with the aim of achieving working-class representation, and many still 
maintain formal links with trade unions and workers’ groups.
National parties invariably articulate the demands of a multitude of groups, forcing 
them to aggregate these interests by drawing them together into a coherent whole, 
balancing competing interests against each other. Constitutional parties are clearly 
forced to do this by the pressures of electoral competition, but even monopolistic 
parties articulate and aggregate interests through their close relationship with the 
state and the economy, especially in centrally planned systems. However, not even in 
competitive party systems are all interests articulated, those of the poor being most 
vulnerable to exclusion.
Socialization and mobilization
Through internal debate and discussion, as well as campaigning and electoral 
competition, parties are important agents of political education and socialization. 
The issues that parties choose to focus on help to set the political agenda, and the 
values and attitudes that they articulate become part of the larger political culture (see 
p. 217). In the case of monopolistic parties, the propagation of an ‘official’ ideology 
(be it Marxism–Leninism, National Socialism or simply the ideas of a charismatic 
leader) is consciously acknowledged to be its central, if not supreme, function.
Mainstream parties in competitive systems play no less significant a role in 
encouraging groups to play by the rules of the democratic game, thus mobilizing 
support for the regime itself. For example, the emergence of socialist parties in the late 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was an important means of integrating the 
working class into industrial society. Nevertheless, the capacity of parties to mobilize 
and socialize has been brought into doubt by evidence in many countries of partisan 
dealignment (see p. 267) and growing disenchantment with conventional pro￾system parties. The problem that parties have is that, to some extent, they themselves 
are socialized (some would say corrupted) by the experience of government, making 
them, it appears, less effective in engaging partisan sympathies and attracting 
emotional attachments. (These issues are discussed more fully in Chapter 20.)
Organization of government
It is often argued that complex modern societies would be ungovernable in the 
absence of political parties. In the first place, parties help with the formation of 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_11.indd 280 23-07-2024 17:42:38PARTIES AND PARTY SYSTEMS 281
governments, in parliamentary systems, to the extent that it is possible to talk of 
‘party government’ (see p. 291). Parties also give governments a degree of stability 
and coherence, especially if the members of the government are drawn from a single 
party and are, therefore, united by common sympathies and attachments. Even 
governments that are formed from a coalition of parties are more likely to foster 
unity and agreement than those that consist of separate individuals, each with his or 
her own priorities.
Parties, furthermore, facilitate cooperation between the two major branches of 
government: the legislature and the executive. In parliamentary systems, this is 
effectively guaranteed by the fact that the government is usually formed from the 
party or parties that have majority control of the legislature. However, even in 
presidential systems the chief executive can wield some influence, if not control, 
through an appeal to party unity. Finally, parties provide, in competitive systems at 
least, a vital source of opposition and criticism, both inside and outside government. 
As well as broadening political debate and educating the electorate, this helps to 
ensure that government policy is more thoroughly scrutinized and, therefore, more 
likely to be workable.
Party organization: where does power lie?
Because of the crucial role that political parties play, considerable attention has been 
focused on where power lies within parties. The organization and structure of parties 
thus provides vital clues about the distribution of power within society as a whole.

DEBATING . . .
DO PARTIES BREED DISCORD AND CONSTRAIN POLITICAL DEBATE?
So common are parties in modern politics that it is often forgotten how controversial they were when they first emerged. 
Although some welcomed them as the agents of a new age of mass politics, others warned that they would deepen conflict 
and subvert the politics of individual consciousness. The trend towards falling party membership and declining party 
identification in the modern period has served to revive such criticisms.
YES NO
Sacrificing personal conscience. By their nature, 
parties are collective entities, groups of people who 
agree a common platform, and advance shared views 
and opinions. Without unity and cohesion, parties have 
very little reason to exist. And yet this unity comes at 
the price of personal conscience, as it is inconceivable 
that any member would genuinely support all of a party’s 
policies in all circumstances. Over small and sometimes 
large matters, parties therefore come to ‘think for’ 
their members, whether this comes about through 
party discipline and the fear of punishment (including 
expulsion from the party) or, more insidiously, through 
an emotional or ideological attachment to the party and 
its goals.
Disharmony and adversarialism. Party politics is based 
on partisanship, adherence and, maybe, even devotion 
to a particular cause or group. This inevitably breeds a 
tribal mentality in which the flaws and failings of other 
parties are exaggerated, while those of one’s own 
party are consistently denied. Parties thus promote a 
one-sided view of politics in which political issues and 
debates are constantly distorted by considerations 
of party advantage. This tendency towards mindless 
adversarialism – disagreement for the sake of 
disagreement – is hardly a sound basis for advancing the 
public good.
Domination by the cunning and ambitious. Parties serve 
to concentrate political power rather than disperse it. In 
the ‘iron law of oligarchy’ (see p. 282), this tendency is 
explained in terms of organization. However, elite rule 
also reflects the fact that, within parties, ‘foot soldiers’ 
are required to do little other than obey and follow, 
encouraged by the knowledge that loyalty and discipline 
will be rewarded, while dissent and, in particular, criticism 
of the leadership will be punished. Those who climb the 
‘greasy pole’ and gain advancement within the party 
are therefore likely, in George Washington’s words, to 
be ‘cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men’. Political 
parties are, in this sense, a particular example of the 
corruption of power (as discussed in Chapter 20).
Forums of debate. The image of parties as austere, 
monolithic bodies, in which free debate is sacrificed in 
the cause of party unity, is accurate only in the context of 
authoritarianism. In other circumstances, parties are vibrant 
and multifarious; indeed, the existence of rival factions and 
tendencies ensures unending debate about policy issues 
and strategic concerns. Rather than requiring members to 
sacrifice personal conscience, parties provide their members 
with an education in politics, helping them to strengthen 
their knowledge and skills and making them more engaged 
citizens. Party membership is therefore an important 
vehicle for the aspect of personal self-development.
Engaging the people. Parties provide a channel of 
communication through which political leaders both 
mobilize citizens and respond to their needs and concerns. 
This applies most clearly when the electoral process forces 
parties to compete for the popular vote in order to win or 
retain government power, but it can also occur (albeit to a 
limited extent) in authoritarian systems, through attempts 
by ‘ruling’ parties to maintain legitimacy. The need to 
engage with the ideas and interests of the people generates 
pressure within parties to permit, even encourage, internal 
debate and argument among their members, rather than 
uncritical obedience.
Cross-party interaction. Bipartisanship is more common 
than is often supposed. For instance, the use of proportional 
electoral systems typically creates a bias in favour of 
consensus-building and alliances amongst parties based 
on the fact that no single party is likely to have sufficient 
parliamentary strength to rule on its own. The resulting 
coalition governments are held together by the fact that 
conflicts between the parties involved are resolved through 
a process of ongoing cross-party dialogue. A similar 
dynamic can develop in presidential systems due to the 
phenomenon of cohabitation, whereby the executive is in 
the hands of one party while the legislature is dominated by 
another party.

Can parties function as democratic bodies that broaden participation and access to 
power? Or do they simply entrench the dominance of leaders and elites?
One of the earliest attempts to investigate internal party democracy was undertaken 
in Mosei Ostrogorski’s Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties (1902), 
which argued that the representation of individual interests had lost out to the 
growing influence of the party machine and control exerted by a caucus of senior 
party figures. This view was more memorably expressed by Robert Michels (1876–
1936) in Political Parties (1911). Michels, a prominent elite theorist, wished to 
analyse the power structure of the German Social Democratic Party, and he found 
that despite the party’s formally democratic organization, power was concentrated 
in the hands of a small group of party leaders who effectively dictated policy and 
appointments. For Michels, the situation he observed spelled the inevitable failure 
of ‘democratic’ socialism and the seeming inevitability of a small elite to dominate 
a political system. Michel’s termed this phenomenon the ‘iron law of oligarchy’. 
Critics, however, point out that Michels’ observations are generalizations made on 
the basis of a single political party at a particular moment in time. In practice, party 
elites have often proved to be more faction-ridden and less monolithic, and mass 
memberships of parties less deferential and quiescent to party leaders than Michels 
suggested.
Attempts have been made to strengthen the democratic and participatory 
features of parties through reform. One of the clearest examples of this occurred 
in the USA in the 1960s and 1970s. US parties differ in many respects from their 
European counterparts. As ‘big tent’ coalitions of sometimes conflicting interests, 
they are highly decentralized and generally have fairly loose ideological and policy 
programmes. Traditionally, state-based or city-based party bosses (a legacy of the 
machine politics of the early twentieth century) acted as power brokers and exercised

CONCEPT
Party democracy
Party democracy is a 
form of popular rule that 
operates through the 
agency of a party. There 
are two models of party 
democracy. In the first 
(intra-party democracy), 
parties are democratic 
agents, in that power 
within them is widely and 
evenly dispersed. This 
implies, for instance, 
that there should be 
broad participation in the 
election of leaders and 
selection of candidates. 
In the second model, 
democracy dictates that 
policy-making power 
should be concentrated 
in the hands of party 
members who are 
elected and, therefore, 
publicly accountable. 
In this view, the first 
model may lead to the 
tyranny of non-elected 
constituency activists.
FOCUS ON . . . 
THE IRON LAW OF OLIGARCHY
Oligarchy is government or domination by the few. The ‘iron law of oligarchy’, formulated by 
Robert Michels (1911), suggests that there is an inevitable tendency for political organizations, 
and by implication all organizations, to be oligarchic. Participatory or democratic structures 
cannot check oligarchic tendencies; they can only disguise them.
Michels advanced a number of arguments in support of his law:
 Elite groups result from the need for specialization. Elite members have greater expertise 
and better organizational skills than those possessed by ordinary members.
 Leaders form cohesive groups because they recognize that this improves their chances 
of remaining in power.
 Rank-and-file members of an organization tend to be apathetic and are, therefore, 
generally disposed to accept subordination and venerate leaders.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_11.indd 283 23-07-2024 17:42:41284 POLITICS
a decisive influence at nominating conventions. Following protests and clashes at the 
1968 Democratic national convention in Chicago, a reform movement sprang up, 
aimed at weakening the power of local party leaders and strengthening the role of 
rank-and-file members.
This was accomplished largely through the wider use of nominating primaries and 
caucuses. These, first with the Democrats and later with the Republicans, attracted 
a growing number of issue and candidate activists into party politics, leading to 
the nomination of more ideological candidates such as George McGovern for the 
Democrats in 1972 and Ronald Reagan for the Republicans in 1980. Such tendencies 
generated concern, particularly amongst Democrats, who feared that more open 
and participatory structures could simply result in the nomination of unelectable or 
radical candidates. Both the main US parties responded to this by modernizing and 
strengthening their committee structures, especially at national, congressional and 
senatorial levels. Although this has been portrayed as a process of party renewal, it 
is evidence of the parties’ desire to provide better electoral support for individual 
candidates, rather than of the emergence of European-style, party-focused elections.
The existence of factions and factional tendencies is as important as formal 
organization in determining the location of power within a party. While all parties, 
even those with an apparently monolithic character, embrace some measure of 
political and ideological rivalry, the degree to which this rivalry is reflected in 
conflict between organized and coherent groups is crucial in determining the degree 
of authority of party leaders. In some cases, factions can break away from parties 
in the manner that European communist parties often emerged out of socialist 
parties in the years following the 1917 Russian Revolution. Factionalism is often 
linked to the weight that parties place on political ideas and ideological direction. 
Whereas pragmatic right-wing parties usually merely have to balance or conciliate 
rival tendencies, more ideological parties of the left often have to deal with open 
disagreement and institutionalized rivalry. Together with their inclination to endorse 
internal democracy, this has generally made socialist parties more difficult to lead 
than liberal or conservative parties.
Perhaps a more significant consideration, however, is the extent to which parties 
have a secure hold on power. Factionalism is, in a sense, a luxury that only long￾time parties of government can afford and helps explain the deeply factional nature 
of ‘dominant’ parties such as the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan (see 
pp. 288–289) and the Italian Christian Democratic Party (DC). The UK Conservative 
Party is an example of a party with an ethos that once stressed, above all, deference 
and loyalty. However, the party became increasingly factionalized in the 1980s and 
1990s through a combination of its more ideological character and its prolonged 
electoral success after 1979. Bottom-up pressures thus gave the Conservative Party 
a more democratic character than its formal leader-dominated structure suggested 
was possible. The most conspicuous casualty of this process was Margaret Thatcher, 
who was forced to stand down as party leader in 1990 despite having won three 
successive general elections. Albeit to different degrees, all subsequent Conservative 
leaders have experienced difficulties in confronting factional resistance inside and 
outside Parliament.

A faction is a section

formation, usually a 
political party. Its aims

be compatible with 
those of its host party; 
otherwise the group is a 
‘party within a party’. A

and ‘tendencies’, the 
latter being looser 
and more informal 
groups, distinguished 
only by a common 
policy or ideological 
disposition. Factionalism

proliferation of factions, 
or to the bitterness of 
factional rivalry. The

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
CHINA: PARTY POLITICS IN A ONE-PARTY STATE
With over 96 million members, the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) is one of the largest political parties in 
the world. More than that, it is the sole ruling party 
of the People’s Republic of China and the locus of all 
legitimate political activity within the country. While in 
democracies, elections and the public discourse are used 
to understand politics, in China nearly all politics takes 
place at the intra-party level, and requires observers to 
study the key players, institutions and internal workings 
of the CCP.
Despite is huge size, the CCP is a cadre party. It only 
admits about one in ten applicants for membership and 
requires all those wishing to join to take an examination 
on party ideology and history. Educational achievement, 
employment history, social background and perceived 
loyalty are also considered. Because the CCP fills all key 
positions within government, public institutions and state￾run industries, joining the party is a prerequisite for those 
with ambitions of high office. As such, the party prioritizes 
recruiting those whose talents and character it desires to 
rule the country. Beyond the regular party membership is 
a special class of members known as ‘cadres’. They become 
professional full-time operatives and are eligible to occupy 
senior leadership positions in the party and government. 
Cadres undergo extensive ideological training at one of the 
party schools and only around one in fifty party members 
are brought into this group.
The CCP operates under the principle of what is termed 
‘democratic centralism’. Nominally at least, the supreme 
organ of the party is the National Congress, which 
meets every five years and allows thousands of local 
party representatives from across the country to vote on 
the party’s leadership and policies. Whatever decisions 
are made, though, are binding on all members of the 
party, and adherence to the party platform is vigorously 
enforced by the cadres. In reality, however, the party 
congresses are carefully stage-managed affairs, and 
nearly all key decisions have been made long-prior 
– most votes are unanimous, upholding the external 
appearance of unity.
Behind the scenes, though, there is vigorous debate and 
politicking. The lead-up to party congresses involve intense 
periods of internal campaigning and bargaining, as various 
factions vie for leadership positions and changes to the 
party platform. Hence, even amidst a very disciplined party 
organization, the CCP is far from stagnant – its ideology 
and policy platform has evolved dramatically over time, 
from the Marxist–Leninist ideas of Mao Zedong to the 
market–socialist reforms of the 1990s.
The factions who compete for influence within the CCP 
are not formal groupings, but rather informal cliques of 
influential cadres clustered around a specific leader. The 
current leader of China, Xi Jinping, leads what some have 
called the Tsinghua clique, a group with reformist ideas who 
wish to co party that represent the ongoing ntinue market￾style socialism in China. The Tsinghua clique has in the 
last decade managed to appoint its allies to many senior 
leadership positions, which has allowed Xi to consolidate 
his grip on the party. But there are broader intellectual 
movements within the party that represent the ongoing 
debates over policy and ideology as China develops. The 
New Left, for instance, is an intellectual movement that 
has criticized China’s free-market reforms since the 1990s 
and seeks a return to more socialist economic policies and 
to focus on reducing the growing gap between rich and 
poor. Bo Xiliai, the party secretary for the province of 
Chongqing, was considered one of the most prominent 
New Left politicians. Provincial party leaders have some 
leeway to experiment in the application of party policy 
– Xiliai rose to prominence by implementing a New Left 
economic model in Chongqing that gained significant 
attention and was touted as a great success at creating 
wealth amongst the working classes and disadvantaged

PARTY SYSTEMS
While just about every country has political parties of some form, the number of 
parties, their relationship with government and each other, and their relative power 
differ significantly depending on what comparative political scientists call the party 
system.
The most familiar way of distinguishing between different types of party system is by 
reference to the number of parties competing for power in a political system. On this 
basis, Maurice Duverger (1954) distinguished between ‘one-party’, ‘two-party’ and 
‘multiparty’ systems. Although such a typology is commonly used, party systems 
cannot simply be reduced to a ‘numbers game’. Because as important as the number 
of parties competing for power is their relative size, as reflected in their electoral 
and legislative strength. As Giovanni Sartori (2005) pointed out, what is vital is to 
establish the ‘relevance’ of parties in relation to the formation of governments and 
whether their size gives them the prospect of winning, or at least sharing, government 
power. This approach is often reflected in the distinction made between ‘major’, or 
government-orientated, parties and more peripheral, ‘minor’ ones (although neither 
category can be defined with mathematical accuracy). A third consideration is how 
these ‘relevant’ parties relate to one another. Is the party system characterized by 
cooperation and consensus, or by conflict and polarization? This is closely linked to 
the ideological complexion of the party system, and the traditions and history of the 
parties that compose it.
The mere presence of parties does not, however, guarantee the existence of a party 
system. The pattern of relationships amongst parties constitutes a system only if 
it is characterized by stability and a degree of orderliness. Where neither stability 
nor order exists, a party system may be in the process of emerging, or a transition 
from one type of party system to another may be occurring. For instance, this can 
be said of early post-communist Russia. The collapse of communist rule in 1991 
and the initial banning of the CPSU was always going to make the emergence of a 
competitive party system a difficult, perhaps tortuous, business. Russia’s problem 
was a proliferation of parties and political groupings, none of which came close to 
establishing a mass membership or a nationwide organization. No fewer than forty￾three parties contested the 1995 parliamentary elections, with the largest of these,

groups. However, Bo was prominently charged with 
corruption in 2012 and removed from office in what 
many believe was a politically motivated case designed to 
discredit the New Left within the party.
But though the outward emphasis may be on solidarity 
with the party line, the CCP like all parties does all seek to 
aggregate a broad range of interests. There are hundreds of 
interest-group organizations affiliated with the CCP – like 
the China Association for Science and Technology and the 
All-China Women’s Federation. These groups take part in 
the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, 
or CPPCC, which can offer advice and proposals to the 
party. Like many party congresses, CPPCC meetings 
are carefully orchestrated to prevent open dissent. But 
the body encourages discourse between the party and 
various social, economic and religious groups in society, 
and has offered thousands of proposals and ideas, some 
of which have influenced party policy. At the same time, 
the CPPCC helps the CCP mobilize support and solidarity 
amongst hundreds of millions of non-members across all 
walks of Chinese society.

the Russian Communist Party, gaining just 22 per cent of the vote. The subsequent 
introduction of measures such as electoral thresholds and registration on the basis 
of petitions greatly reduced the number of parties, meaning, for instance, that just 
seven parties contested the 2011 Russian Duma elections. However, some have 
argued that, in an age of partisan dealignment and volatile voting patterns, party 
systems are generally losing their ‘systematic’ character, making it more difficult 
to distinguish one system from another. Moreover, where subnational bodies exert 
significant influence, different party systems may operate at different levels within 
the political system.
The major party systems found in modern politics are, nevertheless, as follows:
 one-party systems
 two-party systems
 dominant-party systems
 multi-party systems.
One-party systems
Strictly speaking, the term one-party system is contradictory since ‘system’ 
implies interaction amongst multiple entities. The term is, nevertheless, helpful in 
distinguishing between political systems in which a single party enjoys a monopoly of 
power through the exclusion of all other parties (by political or constitutional means) 
and those systems characterized by a competitive struggle amongst multiple parties. 
Because monopolistic parties effectively function as permanent governments, with 
no mechanism (short of a coup or revolution) through which they can be removed 
from power, they invariably develop an entrenched relationship with the state 
machine. This allows such states to be classified as ‘one-party states’, their machinery 
being seen as a fused ‘party–state’ apparatus. Two rather different types of one-party 
system can be identified, however.
The first type has been found in state socialist regimes where ‘ruling’ communist 
parties have directed and controlled virtually all the institutions and aspects of society. 
Such parties are subject to strict ideological discipline, traditionally linked to tenets 
of Marxism–Leninism, and they have highly structured internal organizations, in line 
with the principles of democratic centralism. These are cadre parties (see pp. 273–
275), in the sense that membership is restricted on political and ideological grounds.
In this type of party, the party core consists of well-paid full-time officials, the 
apparatchiki, who run the party apparatus, and exercise supervision over both the 
state machine and social institutions. A central device through which communist 
parties control the state, economy and society, and ensure the subordination 
of ‘lower’ organs to ‘higher’ ones, is what was called the nomenklatura system in 
the Soviet Union. All key leadership positions in a communist society – not just 
government, but industry, agriculture, education and so on – were filled by party 
members who had been vetted for their loyalty and ideological conformity.
The orthodox communist justification for both the party’s monopoly of power, 
and its supervision of state and social institutions, lies in the Leninist claim that

the party acts as the ‘vanguard of the proletariat’ in providing the working masses 
with the ideological leadership and guidance needed to ensure that they fulfil their 
revolutionary destiny. Vanguardism has, however, been criticized for being deeply 
elitist and providing the seed from which Stalinism later grew. Leon Trotsky (1937) 
and Milovan Djilas (1957) on the other hand, offered an alternative interpretation 
by suggesting that, far from the ‘ruling’ party dominating Soviet development, its 
formal monopoly of power merely concealed the burgeoning influence of the state 
bureaucracy.
While most one-party systems have been socialist or communist, justified at least in 
part by Lenin’s vanguardist concept, throughout the twentieth century other regimes 
have periodically enforced one-party rule, though these have usually been built 
around the dominant role of a charismatic leader and drawn whatever ideological 
identity they have possessed from the views of that leader. Not uncommonly, 
these parties are weakly organized (very different from the tight discipline found 
in communist one-party states), and they play, at best, only a peripheral role in 
the process of policy-making. Their monopolistic position, nevertheless, helps to 
entrench authoritarianism (see p. 139) and to keep alive the danger of corruption. 
For instance, from 1933 to 1974, Portugal was ruled by the so-called ‘Estado Novo’ 
regime under Antonio de Oliveria Salazar’s National Union. His party was largely a 
vehicle to sustain his rule – it lacked an ideological basis and little political activity 
occurred within it, but it was the only political entity that could legally exist or 
compete in elections, and it effectively functioned as a patronage machine, awarding 
government jobs and perks in exchange for supporting the regime.
In some developing nations, one-party systems may be justified by their leaders in 
order to bring stability and progress. In Ghana, Tanzania and Senegal, for example, 
the ‘ruling’ party developed out of an independence movement that proclaimed the 
overriding need for nation-building and economic development.
Dominant-party systems
Dominant-party systems should not be confused with one-party systems, although 
they may at times exhibit similar characteristics. A dominant-party system is 
competitive in the sense that a number of parties compete for power in regular and 
popular elections – unlike a one-party system, political opposition is legal. But these 
systems are nonetheless dominated by a single major party that consequently enjoys 
prolonged periods in power. This apparently neat definition, however, runs into 
problems, notably in relation to determining how ‘prolonged’ a governing period 
must be for a party to be considered ‘dominant’. Japan is usually cited as the classic 
example of a dominant-party system. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been 
in power since its foundation in 1955, except for two periods between 1993 and 1994 
and 2009 to 2012. In its early decades, the LDP’s dominance was underpinned by 
the Japanese ‘economic miracle’. However, it has also reflected the powerful appeal 
of the party’s neo-Confucian principles of duty and obligation in the still traditional 
Japanese countryside, and the strong links that the party has forged with business 
elites. These advantages have enabled the LDP to withstand challenges posed by 
economic stagnation, deep factionalism and the advance of the Democratic Party

of Japan, which, in 2009, became the first opposition party since 1945 to win a 
parliamentary majority. The African National Congress (ANC) has similarly been 
the dominant party in South Africa since the ending of apartheid in 1993, its position 
being based on its pre-eminent role in the long struggle against white rule, and the 
fact that the main opposition party of South Africa is, historically, associated with 
the white minority.
The most prominent feature of a dominant-party system is the tendency for the 
political focus to shift from competition between parties to factional (see p. 284)
conflict within the dominant party itself. Within the LDP, for instance, perennial 
struggles for power have taken place, as various subgroups coalesced around rising 
or powerful individuals. Such factionalism was maintained at the local level by the 
ability of faction leaders to provide political favours for their followers, and at the 
parliamentary level through the allocation of senior government and party offices. 
Although the resulting infighting may have been seen as a means of guaranteeing 
argument and debate in a system in which small parties were usually marginalized, 
in Japan factionalism tended to revolve more around personal differences than 
policy or ideological disagreement. One example of this was the conflict between 
the Fukuda and Tanaka factions during the 1970s and 1980s, which continued long 
after the two principals had left the scene.
Apart from a tendency towards stability and predictability, a dominant-party system 
is usually seen as an unhealthy phenomenon. In the first place, it tends to erode the 
important constitutional distinction between the state and the party in power. When Source: Getty Images/Andalou Agency
Fumio Kishida, leader of Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), places roses next

an example of a dominant party, having formed government almost continuously 
in Japan since 1955.

governments cease to come and go, an insidious process of politicization takes place 
through which state officials and institutions adjust to the ideological and political 
priorities of the dominant party. Second, an extended period in power can engender 
complacency, arrogance and even corruption in the dominant party. The course of 
Japanese politics has, for example, regularly been interrupted by scandals, usually 
involving allegations of financial corruption. Third, a dominant-party system is 
characterized by weak and ineffective opposition. Criticism and protest can more 
easily be ignored if they stem from parties that are no longer regarded as genuine 
rivals for power. Finally, the existence of a ‘permanent’ party of government may 
corrode the democratic spirit by encouraging the electorate to fear change and to 
stick with the ‘natural’ party of government.
Two-party systems
A two-party system is duopolistic in that it is dominated by two ‘major’ parties that 
have a roughly equal prospect of winning government power. In its classical form, a 
two-party system can be identified by three criteria:
 Although a number of ‘minor’ parties may exist, only two parties enjoy sufficient 
electoral and legislative strength to have a realistic prospect of winning government 
power.
 The larger party is able to rule alone (usually on the basis of a legislative majority); 
the other provides the opposition.
 Power alternates between these parties; both are ‘electable’, the opposition serving 
as a ‘government in the wings’.
The UK and the USA are the most frequently cited examples of states with two-party 
systems, though others include Ghana, Jamaica, Malta and the Bahamas. Archetypal 
examples of two-party politics are, nevertheless, rare, and in most such systems there 
have been periods where the two-party domination has lessened in the face of third￾party challenges. Moreover, in many of the traditional two-party system examples, 
there has been a significant rise in support for third parties, regional movements and 
independents in recent years.
Even the seemingly incontrovertible two-party nature of the USA – which, for 
instance, sees the Republicans and Democrats usually holding between them all the 
seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate – can be questioned. On the 
one hand, the presidential system allows one party to capture the White House (the 
presidency) while the other controls one or both houses of Congress, meaning that it 
may not be possible to identify a clear government–opposition divide. On the other 
hand, ‘third’-party candidates are sometimes of significance. Ross Perot’s 16 per cent 
of the vote in the 1992 presidential election not only highlighted the decline of the 
Republican and Democratic parties, but also, arguably, proved decisive in securing 
victory for Bill Clinton.
Two-party politics was once portrayed as the surest way of reconciling responsiveness 
with order, representative government with effective government. Its key advantage 
is that it makes possible a system of party government (see p. 291), supposedly 
characterized by stability, choice and accountability. The two major parties can offer 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_11.indd 290 23-07-2024 17:42:44PARTIES AND PARTY SYSTEMS 291
the electorate a straightforward choice between rival programmes and alternative 
governments. Voters can support a party knowing that, if it wins the election, it will 
have the capacity to carry out its manifesto promises without having to negotiate or 
compromise with coalition partners. This is sometimes seen as one of the attractions 
of majoritarian electoral systems that exaggerate support for large parties. Two-party 
systems have also been praised for delivering strong but accountable government 
based on relentless competition between the governing and opposition parties. 
Although government can govern, it can never relax or become complacent because 
it is constantly confronted by an opposition that acts as a government in waiting.
Two-party systems, moreover, are theorized to have a bias in favour of moderation. 
The heaviest concentration of voters is thought to be towards the centre of the political 
spectrum, so it stands to reason that in a two-party system the major parties will 
attempt to capture as many of those voters as possible. Or at least that is the theory. 
But in recent decades, several studies have found that two-party systems are in fact 
amongst the most polarized and adversarial – the USA and UK being prominent 
examples. Adversarial two-party politics has often been explained by reference to the 
class nature of party support (party conflict being seen, ultimately, as a reflection of 
the class struggle), or as a consequence of party democratization and the influence of 
ideologically committed grass-roots activists.
A further problem with the two-party system is that two evenly matched parties 
are encouraged to compete for votes by outdoing each other’s electoral promises, 
perhaps causing spiralling public spending and fuelling inflation. This amounts to 
irresponsible party government, in that parties come to power on the basis of election 
manifestos that they have no capacity to fulfil. A final weakness of two-party systems 
is the obvious restrictions they impose in terms of electoral and ideological choice. 
While a choice between just two programmes of government was perhaps sufficient 
in an era of partisan alignment and class solidarity, it has become quite inadequate in 
a period of greater individualism (see p. 197) and social diversity.
Multi-party systems
A multi-party system is characterized by competition amongst more than two parties, 
reducing the chances of single-party government and increasing the likelihood 
of coalitions. However, it is difficult to define multi-party systems in terms of the 
number of major parties, as such systems sometimes operate through coalitions 
including smaller parties that are specifically designed to exclude larger parties from 
government. If the likelihood of coalition government (see p. 292) is the index of 
multi-partyism, this classification contains a number of subcategories.
West Germany, for example, was described as having a ‘two-and-a-half-party’ system, 
in that the CDU and SDP alternated for control of government from the 1940s to the 
1980s. However, a third party, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), reliably won around 
10 per cent in the Bundestag, and the CDU or SDP usually had to go into coalition 
with the FDP to maintain a parliamentary majority, ensuring they were represented 
in just about every West German cabinet. Post-reunification, German politics has 
seen the rise of several other third parties, particularly the Greens, The Left and the 
Alliance for Germany, such that the party system might increasingly be described as 
CONCEPT
Party government
Party government is a 
system through which 
single parties are able 
to form governments 
and carry through policy 
programmes. Its key 
features are as follows. 
(1) Major parties possess 
a clear policy programme 
and thus offer the 
electorate a meaningful 
choice between potential 
governments. (2) The 
governing party enjoys 
sufficient ideological 
and organizational 
unity to deliver on its 
manifesto commitments. 
(3) Responsibility 
is maintained by 
the government’s 
accountability to the 
electorate through its 
mandate, and by the 
existence of a credible 
opposition that acts as a 
balancing force.

multi-party, though the CDU and SPD are the two largest parties and thus the only 
ones likely to lead a governing coalition.
Sartori (2005) distinguished between two types of multi-party system, which he 
termed the ‘moderate’ and ‘polarized’ pluralist systems. In this categorization, 
moderate pluralism exists in countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway, 
where ideological differences between major parties are slight, and where there is a 
general inclination to form coalitions and move towards the centre ground. Polarized 
pluralism, on the other hand, exists when more marked ideological differences 
separate parties, some of which adopt an anti-system stance. Evidence of polarized 
pluralism can be found in Italy, where in 2018 a government was formed by two rival 
populist parties, the Five Star Movement and the anti-immigrant League (formerly 
known as the Northern League).
The strength of multi-party systems is that they create internal checks and 
balances within government and exhibit a bias in favour of debate, conciliation 
and compromise. The process of coalition formation and the dynamics of coalition 
maintenance ensure a broad responsiveness that cannot but take account of competing 
views and contending interests. Thus, in Germany, the liberal Free Democrats act as 
a moderating influence on both the conservative CDU and the socialist SPD. Where 
SPD–Green coalitions have been formed in the Länder (provinces), the Green 
presence has helped to push environmental issues up the political agenda. Similarly, 
the multi-party features of the Swedish system, which make coalition government 
more common than not, have encouraged the Swedish Social Democratic Party to 
build a broad welfare consensus, and to pursue moderate policies that do not alienate 
business interests.
The principal criticisms of multi-party systems relate to the pitfalls and difficulties 
of coalition formation. The post-election negotiations that take place when no 
single party is strong enough to govern alone can take weeks or sometimes months, 
to complete. More seriously, coalition governments may be fractured and unstable, 
paying greater attention to squabbles amongst coalition partners than to the tasks 
of government. This is especially true in systems with proportional representation 
(see Ch. 10) and a highly fragmented electorate. For instance, from 2018 to 2022 
there were five elections in Israel, triggered by a crisis over the leadership of Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu’s right wing and nationalist policies, 
combined with investigations over corruption, made him a divisive figure, with 
the governing Likud Party steadfastly supporting their leader, but the opposition 
parties determined to remove him. The public were similarly divided – at the April 
2019 elections, Likud and the main opposition party won thirty-five seats each. 
But nearly half the electorate voted for neither, and the remaining fifty seats were 
split amongst nine minor parties. With sixty-one seats needed for a majority, at 
least four of these small parties would be needed to form a governing coalition, 
something that proved almost impossible to secure with opinions so divided over 
Netanyahu. Moreover, some small parties (like the Arab nationalist party Balad) 
were unwilling to join any coalition. With no party able to form a government, 
new elections were called in September 2019, and again in March 2020, after 
CONCEPT
Coalition
A coalition is a grouping 
of rival political actors 
brought together either 
through the perception 
of a common threat, or 
through a recognition 
that their goals cannot 
be achieved by working 
separately. Electoral 
coalitions are alliances 
through which parties 
agree not to compete 
against one another, with 
a view to maximizing 
their representation. 
Legislative coalitions are 
agreements between 
two or more parties 
to support a particular 
bill or programme. 
Governing coalitions 
are formal agreements 
between two or more 
parties that involve a 
cross-party distribution 
of ministerial portfolios. 
A ‘grand coalition’ or 
‘national government’ 
comprises all major 
parties.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_11.indd 292 23-07-2024 17:42:44PARTIES AND PARTY SYSTEMS 293
which a grand coalition was formed. However, it collapsed within a year, as did 
the coalition that formed after the March 2021 elections as well. Only after a fifth 
and final election in November 2022 did a coalition of seven parties finally gain a 
majority. It would, nevertheless, be a mistake to suggest that coalitions are always 
associated with instability, as the record of stable and effective coalition government 
in countries like Germany and Sweden clearly demonstrates. Since the 1970s, at 
least four and as many as six parties have been needed to form a government in 
Finland, but most cabinets have lasted a full term, and Finland is considered one of 
the world’s most stable democracies.
A final problem is that the tendency towards moderation and compromise may 
mean that multi-party systems are so dominated by the political centre that they 
are unable to offer clear ideological alternatives. Coalition politics tends, naturally, 
to be characterized by negotiation and conciliation, a search for common ground, 
rather than by conviction and the politics of principle. This process can be criticized 
as being implicitly corrupt, in that parties are encouraged to abandon policies and 
principles in their quest for power. It can also lead to the over-representation of 
centrist parties and centrist interests, especially when a small centrist party is 
the only viable coalition partner for both of the larger conservative and socialist 
parties. Indeed, this is sometimes seen as one of the drawbacks of proportional 
representation electoral systems, which, by ensuring that the legislative size of 
parties reflects their electoral strength, are biased in favour of multi-party politics 
and coalition government. Source: Getty Images/Ariel Schalit

2022. After five elections in just four years, no fewer than seven different parties 
were required to form a governing coalition.

A CRISIS OF PARTY POLITICS?
On the face of it, to suggest that party politics is in crisis is preposterous. Rather 
than declining, the number of political parties across the globe continues steadily 
to grow. Throughout the democratic world, the path to political power is exclusively 
through a political party. Thus, for anyone with political ambitions in democratic 
societies, whether liberal or illiberal, the first step to realizing those ambitions was, is 
and is likely to remain joining, or possibly founding, a political party (Pettitt 2014). 
And yet, there is clear evidence in recent decades of the decline of political parties 
as agents of representation, meaning that they have become less effective as links 
between government and the people. This can be seen in the decline of both party 
membership and partisanship, reflected in partisan dealignment (see p. 267).
For example, party membership has long been declining in the UK. In the 1950s 
around 7 per cent of the British electorate was a member of a political party, but 
today it has fallen to around 1 per cent. The Conservative Party claimed more than 
1.2 million paying members in the 1980s, but in 2022 that had fallen to around 
170,000. And with the average age of a party member in the UK well over fifty, those 
numbers seem likely to continue falling. Falling voter turnout also illustrates the 
declining capacity of parties to mobilize electoral support. For instance, Wattenberg 
(2000) found that, in nineteen liberal democracies, turnout had declined on average 
by 10 per cent between the 1950s and the 1990s, the trend having been particularly 
prominent in the USA, Western Europe, Japan and Latin America. The decline has 
only continued since then, falling to around 66 per cent globally in the mid-2010s, 
down from almost 80 per cent in the 1950s (Solijonov 2016).
However, if there is a crisis in party politics, it centres not on all parties, but on 
a certain type of party, that is, the mass or mainstream party. Indeed, the decline 
in party membership and partisanship may merely be one aspect of a wider trend 
towards anti-politics (see p. 500), which has also witnessed the birth of new parties, 
or the emergence of parties from the political fringe. What these newly founded and 
once-fringe parties usually have in common is an antipathy towards conventional 
centres of power and opposition to established parties of government, linking this 
development to the advance of populism. Examples of relatively new political parties 
include Syriza in Greece, which came to power in 2015 having been founded in 
2004; the Five Star Movement in Italy, which entered government in 2018 having 
been created in 2009; and En Marche! in France, which was founded by Emmanuel 
Macron in 2016 to support his successful 2017 presidential bid. However, although 
En Marche! resembles other such parties, in being leader-centric and rejecting 
the authority of established parties, it is centrist, liberal and pro-European, being, 
perhaps, an example of anti-populist populism. (Leader-centric politics is considered 
in greater depth in Chapter 14.)
Most of the existing parties that have grown in electoral terms in recent years, 
especially in Europe, have been right-wing populist parties, whose appeal is often 
based on their strong anti-immigration stance. During 2016 and 2017, almost one in 
five Europeans voted in national elections for parties of the populist right, compared 
with roughly 10 per cent in 2000 and just 2 per cent in 1980. Nevertheless, the populist 
upsurge has not only had an impact on newly founded and once-fringe parties; 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_11.indd 294 23-07-2024 17:42:46PARTIES AND PARTY SYSTEMS 295
some mainstream parties have clearly benefited from an injection of populism. For 
example, Donald Trump’s success in winning the Republican Party’s presidential 
nomination in 2016 meant that, in the presidential election itself, the appeal of 
the Republicans extended deep into so-called ‘Rust Belt’ states such as Michigan, 
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, traditionally safe territory for Democratic nominees. 
However, many question whether the incorporation of populist leadership is the 
best way of salvaging a mainstream party. Instead, it may, in the long run, be a recipe 
for chaos and disorder, so deeply do populist and mainstream political sensibilities 
clash.
How can the decline of mainstream parties be explained? One of the problems that 
such parties suffer from is their real or perceived oligarchical character. Parties are 
seen as bureaucratized political machines, whose grass-roots members are either 
inactive, or engaged in dull and routine tasks (attending meetings, sitting on 
committees and so on). In contrast, social movements or single-issue protest groups 
have been more successful in attracting membership and support, particularly from 
amongst the young, partly because they are more loosely organized and locally based, 
and partly because they place a heavier emphasis on participation and activism. The 
public image of parties has been further tarnished by their links to government and 
to ‘career politics’. In the process, parties may be tainted by the power, ambition 
and corruption that is often associated with high office. In other words, parties are 
not seen as being ‘of the people’; too often, they appear to be consumed by political 
infighting and the scramble for power, so becoming divorced from the concerns of 
ordinary people.

CHAPTER 12
GROUPS, 
INTERESTS AND 
MOVEMENTS
PREVIEW
Patterns of political interaction were transformed in the twentieth century by the growing prominence of organized 
groups and interests. Indeed, in the 1950s and 1960s, at the high point of enthusiasm about ‘group politics’, it 
was widely asserted that business interests, trade unions, farm lobbies and the like had displaced legislatures and 
parties as the key political actors. The interest-group universe was further expanded by the growth of single-issue 
protest groups taking up causes ranging from consumer protection to animal rights, and from sexual equality to 
environmentalism. Such groups were often associated with broader social movements (the women’s movement, 
the civil rights movement, the green movement and so on) and were characterized by the adoption of new styles 
of activism and campaigning. Interest groups and political movements have only continued to thrive in mature 
democracies, and they come in all shapes and sizes, carrying out a wide range of functions, from serving as agents of 
citizen empowerment to even becoming part of the machinery of government. Considerable debate, nevertheless, 
surrounds their nature and significance, especially in relation to their impact on the democratic process. While 
some believe that organized groups serve to distribute political power more widely and evenly in society, others 
argue that groups empower the already powerful and subvert the public interest. These issues are related to 
questions about how groups exert influence and the factors that allow them to exert political influence. Social 
movements have been both praised for stimulating new forms of decentralized political engagement and criticized 
for encouraging people to abandon the formal representative process.

GROUP POLITICS
Interest groups (see p. 301), like political parties (see Chapter 11), constitute one of the 
major linkages between government and the governed in modern societies. In some 
respects, their origins parallel those of parties. They were the children of a new age 
of representative government and came into existence to articulate the increasingly 
complex divisions and cleavages of an emerging industrial society. While political 
parties sought to build coalitions of support and broaden their appeal, interest groups 
usually staked out a more distinct and clear-cut position on a particular issue or set 
of issues, in accordance with the aspirations or values of the people they represented. 
Moreover, parties generally looked to secure direct influence over a political system, 
by winning elections and occupying the seats of power. Interest groups, on the other 
hand, worked towards indirect influence over the political process, by arguing their 
case and putting pressure on government.
Interest groups predate the age of representative government; for example, the 
Abolition Society, which was founded in Britain in 1787 to oppose the slave trade. 
It was highly effective in raising public awareness of the brutality and immorality of 
the slave trade, and it finally persuaded the British Parliament to abolish it in 1807. 
Its mission complete, the society was dissolved, but their success prompted other 
advocacy groups to form. William Wilberforce, one of the parliamentarians who 
had been persuaded by the Abolition Society, helped found the Royal Society for the 
Protection of Animals (RSPCA) in 1824. Dedicated to promoting animal welfare, 
the RSPCA helped change public attitudes towards animals and pass numerous anti￾cruelty laws – a role it still plays today. RSPCA-style organizations were founded in 
many countries throughout the nineteenth century, and are examples of some the 
first interest groups to wield significant influence over a particular policy area.
After visiting the USA in the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville (see p. 299) reported 
that interest groups, which he called ‘associations’, had already become a ‘powerful 
instrument of action’. Nationalist movements, like Young Italy, set up in 1831 by the 
Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini (see p. 155), became the model for sister nationalist 
organizations that later sprang up throughout Europe. Similarly, the Society for 
Women’s Rights, founded in France in 1866, stimulated the formation of a worldwide 
women’s suffrage movement. By the end of the nineteenth century powerful farming 
and business interests operated in most industrial societies, alongside a growing 
trade union movement. However, most of the interest groups currently in existence 
are of much more recent origin. They are, in the main, a product of the explosion 
in pressure and protest politics that has occurred since the 1960s. As such they 
may be part of a broader process that has seen the decline of political parties and a 
growing emphasis on organized groups and social movements (see p. 316) as agents 
of mobilization and representation.
Types of group
The task of defining and classifying groups is fraught with danger, given the imprecise 
nature of groups and their multiplicity of forms. Do we focus only on cohesive groups 
that have a certain level of organization and visibility? Or should we consider any 
collection of like-minded people an interest group? Must they pursue broader causes 
Cleavage: A social division 
that creates a collective 
identity on both sides of 
the divide.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_12.indd 298 23-07-2024 12:50:18GROUPS, INTERESTS AND MOVEMENTS 299
or public goals, or can they also pursue selfish and material interests? There is also 
the difficult issue of the relationship between interest groups and government. Are 
interest groups always autonomous, exerting influence from outside, or may they 
operate in and through government, perhaps even being part of the government 
machine itself?
This confusion is compounded by the lack of agreed terminology amongst political 
scientists active in this field. For instance, whereas the term ‘interest group’ is used in 
the USA and elsewhere to describe all organized groups, it tends to be used in the UK 
to refer only to those groups that advance or defend the interests of their members. 
The term ‘pressure group’ is therefore usually preferred in the UK, ‘interest group’ 
tending to be used as a subcategory of the broader classification.
Groups can nevertheless be classified into three types:
 communal groups
 institutional groups
 associational groups.
Communal groups
The chief characteristic of communal groups is that they are embedded in the social 
fabric, in the sense that membership is based on birth, rather than recruitment. 
Examples of such groups are families, tribes, castes and ethnic groups. Unlike 
conventional interest groups, to which members choose to belong, and which possess 
a formal structure and organization, communal groups are founded on the basis of 
a shared heritage and traditional bonds and loyalties. Such groups still play a major 
role in the politics of developing states. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, ethnic, 
tribal and kinship ties are still an important basis of interest articulation. Communal 
groups also continue to survive and exert influence in advanced industrial states, 
as the resurgence of ethnic nationalism and the significance of Catholic groups in 
countries like Italy and Ireland demonstrate.
KEY THINKER
ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE (1805–59)
French politician, political theorist and historian. Following the July Revolution of 1830 in 
France, de Tocqueville visited the USA, ostensibly to study its penal system. This resulted in his 
epic two-volume Democracy in America (1835/40), which developed an ambivalent critique of 
US democracy with its equality of opportunity, but warned against the ‘tyranny of the majority’. 
His political career was ended by Louis Napoleon’s coup in 1849, leaving him free to devote 
his time to historical work such as The Old Regime and the French Revolution (1856). A friend 
and correspondent of J. S. Mill, de Tocqueville’s writings reflect a highly ambiguous attitude 
to the advance of political democracy. His ideas have influenced both liberal and conservative 
theorists, as well as academic sociologists.

Institutional groups
Institutional groups are groups that are part of the machinery of government and 
attempt to exert influence in and through that machinery. They differ from interest 
groups in that they enjoy no measure of autonomy or independence. Bureaucracies 
and the military are the clearest examples of institutional groups, and, not 
uncommonly, each of these contains a number of competing interests. In the case of 
authoritarian or totalitarian states, which typically suppress autonomous groups and 
movements, rivalry amongst institutional groups may become the principal form of 
interest articulation. The highly centralized Stalinist system in the USSR, for instance, 
was driven largely by entrenched bureaucratic and economic interests, in particular 
those centred on heavy industry. Similarly, the apparently monolithic character of 
the Hitler state in Germany (1933–45) concealed a reality of bureaucratic infighting 
as Nazi leaders built up sprawling empires in an endless struggle for power.
Institutional groups are not only of significance in non-democratic regimes. Some go 
so far as to argue that the bureaucratic elites and vested interests that develop in the 
ministries, departments and agencies of democratic systems in effect shape the policy 
process: they serve to constrain, some would say dictate to, elected politicians and 
elected governments. Such groups certainly also form alliances with conventional 
interest groups, as in the case of the celebrated ‘military–industrial complex’. The 
significance of the bureaucracy, and the importance of the interests that operate in 
and through it, is discussed in Chapter 16.
Associational groups
Associational groups are ones that are formed by people who come together to 
pursue shared, but limited, goals. Associations are characterized by voluntary action 
and the existence of common interests, aspirations or attitudes. The most obvious 
examples of associational groups are thus what are usually thought of as interest 
groups or pressure groups. However, the distinction between these and communal 
groups may sometimes be blurred. For example, when class loyalties are strong and 
solidaristic, membership of an associational group such as a trade union may be 
more an expression of social identity than an instrumental act aimed at furthering a 
particular goal. Although associational groups are becoming increasingly important 
in developing states, they are usually seen as a feature of industrial societies. 
Industrialization both generates social differentiation, in the form of a complex web 
of competing interests, and, in a capitalist setting at least, encourages the growth of 
self-seeking and individualized patterns of behaviour in the place of ones shaped by 
custom and tradition. When their primary function is to deal with government and 
other public bodies, such groups are usually called interest groups.
Interest groups appear in a variety of shapes and sizes. They are concerned with 
an enormous array of issues and causes, and use tactics that range from serving 
on public bodies and helping to administer government programmes to organizing 
campaigns of civil disobedience (see p. 313) and popular protest. Similarly, they 
may operate at a local, national or (as discussed later) international level, or at a 
combination of these.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_12.indd 300 23-07-2024 12:50:18GROUPS, INTERESTS AND MOVEMENTS 301
Anti-constitutional and paramilitary groups are often excluded from this 
classification. Groups such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), for instance, might 
not be considered interest groups because they sought fundamentally to restructure 
the political system, not merely to influence it, and used the tactics of terrorism (see 
p. 468) and direct action instead of pressure politics. There is a fine line though 
– many effective and legitimate interest groups have used direct action as part of 
broader pressure campaigns, without necessarily pursuing revolutionary goals.
Structure must, however, be imposed on the apparently shapeless interest-group 
universe by an attempt to further differentiate associational groups. The two most 
common classifications are:
 sectional and promotional groups
 insider and outsider groups.
Sectional and promotional groups
Sectional groups exist to advance or protect the (usually material) interests of their 
members. Trade unions, chambers of commerce, trade associations and professional 
bodies are the prime examples of this type of group. Their ‘sectional’ character is 
derived from the fact that they represent a section of society: workers, employers, 
consumers, an ethnic or religious group and so on. Strictly speaking, however, only 
groups engaged in the production, distribution and exchange of goods and services 
can be seen as ‘functional’ groups. In the USA, sectional groups are often classified 
as ‘private interest groups’, to stress that their principal concern is the betterment and 
well-being of their members, not of society in general.
In contrast, promotional groups (sometimes termed cause or attitude groups) are set 
up to advance shared values, ideals or principles. These causes are many and diverse. 
They include ‘pro-choice’ and ‘pro-life’ lobbies on abortion, campaigns in favour of 
civil liberties or against sex and violence on television, protests about pollution and 
animal cruelty, or in defence of traditional or religious values. In the USA, promotional 
groups are dubbed ‘public interest groups’, to emphasize that they promote collective, 
rather than selective, benefits. The term non-government organization (NGOs) is 
also often used for such groups. Promotional groups are therefore defined by the 
fact that they aim to help groups other than their own members. Save the Whales, 
for instance, is an organization for whales, not one of whales. Some organizations, 
of course, have both sectional and promotional features. The National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) addresses the sectional interests 
of American black people (by opposing discrimination and promoting employment 
opportunities) but is also concerned with causes such as social justice and racial 
harmony.
Insider and outsider groups
The alternative system of classification is based on the status that groups have in 
relation to government and the strategies they adopt in order to exert pressure. Insider 
groups enjoy regular, privileged and usually institutionalized access to government 
through routine consultation or representation on government bodies. In many cases 
there is an overlap between sectional and insider classifications. This reflects the 
ability of key economic interests, such as business groups and trade unions, to exert 
Direct action: Political 
activism that employs 
physical or economic 
power, rather than 
political, legal or 
diplomatic means. Direct 
action may range from 
passive resistance to 
terrorism.
CONCEPT
Interest group
An interest group (or 
pressure group) is an 
organized association 
that aims to influence 
the policies or actions 
of government. Interest 
groups differ from 
political parties in the 
following ways. (1) They 
seek to exert influence 
from outside, rather 
than to win or exercise 
government power. 
(2) They typically 
have a narrow issue 
focus, in that they 
are usually concerned 
with a specific cause

Interest groups are 
distinguished from social 
movements by their 
greater degree of formal 
organization.

powerful sanctions if their views are ignored by government. Government may also 
be inclined to consult groups that possess specialist knowledge and information that 
assists in the formulation of workable policy. In Australia, for instance, ‘peak bodies’ 
is the term for various nationwide associations that advocate for the interests of their 
sector, and most have significant access to ministers and influence over government 
policy. Many such bodies are aligned with important sectors of the economy, like 
the Minerals Council of Australia (mining) and the National Farmers Federation 
(agriculture). The Australian Council of Social Service represents social workers 
and the community sector, and advocates for the disadvantaged and is frequently 
consulted on social policy. Insider status is not without its drawbacks, however. 
Influence over government from the inside is about lobbying (see p. 311) and 
negotiation, which sometimes means compromising principled goals for pragmatic 
gains. Moreover, interest groups too closely associated with government tend to be 
viewed with suspicion by grass-roots activists.
Outsider groups, on the other hand, are either not consulted by government or 
consulted only irregularly and not usually at a senior level. In many cases outsider 
status is an indication of weakness, in that, lacking formal access to government, these 
groups must instead try to build popular support or electoral influence in the hope of 
exercising indirect pressure on the policy process. Ironically, then, there is often an 
inverse relationship between the public profile of an interest group and the political 
influence it exerts. Radical protest groups in fields such as environmental protection 
and animal rights may have little choice about being outsiders. Not only are their 
goals frequently out of step with the priorities of government, but their members 
and supporters are often attracted by the fact that such groups are untainted by close 
links with government. In that sense, groups may choose to remain outsiders, both to 
preserve their ideological purity and independence, and to protect their decentralized 
power structures.
Models of group politics
The nature of interest-group politics within a political system depends very much on 
factors like political culture, party system, institutional arrangements and so on. But, 
from a broad standpoint, we can also conceptualize and understand group politics 
from the standpoint of the rival theories of the state examined in Chapter 3. The most 
influential of these as models of interest-group politics are the following:
 pluralism
 corporatism
 the New Right.
Pluralist model
Pluralist theories offer the most positive image of group politics. They stress the 
capacity of groups to both defend the individual from government and promote 
democratic responsiveness. The core theme of pluralism (see p. 109) is that political 
power is fragmented and widely dispersed. Decisions are made through a complex 
process of bargaining and interaction that ensures that the views and interests

CONCEPT
Non￾governmental 
organization
A non-governmental 
organization (NGO) 
is a private, non￾commercial group or 
body which seeks to 
achieve its ends through 
non-violent means. 
NGOs are usually active 
in international politics 
and may be accorded

Operational NGOs are 
those whose primary 
purpose is the design 
and implementation of 
projects that are usually 
either development￾related or relief-related. 
Advocacy NGOs exist 
to promote or defend a 
particular cause, and are 
more concerned with 
expertise and specialist 
knowledge than with 
operational capacity.

of a large number of groups are taken into account. One of the earliest and most 
influential attempts to develop a pluralist ‘group theory’ was undertaken by Arthur 
Bentley in The Process of Government (1908). Bentley’s emphasis on organized 
groups as the fundamental building blocks of the political process is neatly summed 
up in his famous dictum: ‘when the groups are adequately stated, everything is stated’. 
David Truman’s The Governmental Process (1951) is usually seen to have continued 
this tradition, even if his conclusions were more narrowly focused on the US political 
process.
Enthusiasm for groups as agents of interest articulation and aggregation was 
strengthened by the spread of behaviouralism in the 1950s and early 1960s. Systems 
analysis, for example, portrayed interest groups as ‘gatekeepers’ that filtered the 
multiple demands made of government into manageable sets of claims. At the same 
time, community power studies carried out by analysts such as Robert Dahl (1961) 
and Nelson Polsby (1963) claimed to find empirical support for the pluralist assertion 
that no single local elite is able to dominate community decision-making.
From the pluralist perspective, group politics is central to a healthy democratic process, 
and some argued that a form of pluralist democracy (see p. 110) had superseded 
more conventional electoral democracy, in that groups and organized interests had 
replaced political parties as the principal link between government and the governed.
The central assumptions of this theory are that all groups and interests have the 
potential to organize and gain access to government, that they are internally responsive 
in the sense that leaders broadly articulate the interests or values of their members, 
and that their political influence is roughly in line with their size and the intensity of 
their support. One way in which this was demonstrated was by evidence that political 
power is fragmented in such a way that no group or interest can achieve dominance 
for any period of time. As Robert Dahl (1956) put it, ‘all the active and legitimate 
groups in the population can make themselves heard at some crucial stage in the 
process of decision’. The alternative idea of ‘countervailing powers’, developed in John 
Kenneth Galbraith’s (see p. 195) early writings, suggests that a dynamic equilibrium 
naturally emerges amongst competing groups, as the success of, say, business merely

US political scientist. Appointed professor of political science at Yale University in 1946, 
Dahl subsequently became one of the USA’s most eminent political analysts. In 1953 (with 
Charles Lindblom) he coined the term ‘polyarchy’ (rule by the many) to distinguish modern 
societies from classical democracy. Dahl’s early writings reflect the impact of positivist and 
behaviouralist doctrines and, in the 1950s and early 1960s, he developed a conventional 
pluralist position. From the late 1960s, however, together with Lindblom and Galbraith, he 
developed a radicalized form of liberalism, ‘neopluralism’ (see p. 67), that revealed an increasing 
concern with the power of major capitalist corporations. His major works include A Preface to 
Democratic Theory (1956), Who Governs? (1961) and Dilemmas of Pluralist Democracy (1982).

encourages opponents, such as labour or consumers, to organize to counter that 
success. Group politics is thus characterized by a rough balance of power.
This highly optimistic view of group politics has been heavily criticized by elitists 
and Marxists. Elitists challenge the empirical claims of pluralism by suggesting that 
they recognize only one ‘face’ of power: the ability to influence decision-making (see 
p. 11). In contrast to the notion that power is widely and evenly distributed, elite 
theorists draw attention to the existence of a ‘power elite’, comprising the heads of 
business corporations, political leaders and military chiefs (Mills 1956). Marxists, for 
their part, have traditionally emphasized that political power is closely linked to the 
ownership of productive wealth, which suggests the existence of a capitalist ‘ruling 
class’. For neo-Marxists such as Ralph Miliband (1969) this is reflected in ‘unequal 
competition’ between business and labour groups, the former enjoying a control of 
economic resources, a public status and a level of access to government that the latter 
cannot match. The rise of globalization (see p. 182) has renewed such arguments, 
leading some to suggest that the increased mobility of capital and a free-trade 
international system has resulted in the ‘corporate takeover’ of government (Hertz 
2001). In the face of such criticism, a more critical or qualified form of pluralism, 
neopluralism (see p. 67), emerged. This has perhaps been most clearly expressed in 
Charles Lindblom’s Politics and Markets (1980), which highlighted the privileged 
position that business groups enjoy in Western polyarchies, while acknowledging 
that this seriously compromises the claim that such societies are democratic.
Corporatist model
Corporatist models of group politics differ from pluralism in that they attempt to trace 
the implications of the closer links that have developed in industrialized societies 
between groups and the state. Corporatism is a social theory that emphasizes the 
privileged position that certain groups enjoy in relation to government, enabling 
them to influence the formulation and implementation of public policy. Some 
commentators regard corporatism as a state-specific phenomenon, shaped by 
particular historical and political circumstances. For example, in Hong Kong, almost 
half of the legislature’s seats are allocated to so-called ‘functional constituencies’, 
which represent the various commercial interest groups in the city, such as insurance, 
banking and wholesaling. Moreover, pro-business organizations like the Hong Kong 
General Chamber of Commerce work very closely with government to coordinate 
policy, making Hong Kong an explicitly corporatist system.
Others, however, see corporatism as a general phenomenon that stems from 
tendencies that are implicit in economic and social development, and thus believe that 
it is manifest, in some form or other, in all advanced industrial states. Even the USA, 
usually portrayed as the model of pluralist democracy, has invested its regulatory 
agencies with quasi-legislative powers, thereby fostering the development of formal 
bonds between government and major interests. From this perspective, corporatist 
tendencies may merely reflect the symbiotic relationship that exists between groups 
and government. Groups seek ‘insider’ status because it gives them access to policy 
formulation, which enables them better to defend the interests of their members. 
CONCEPT
Corporatism
Corporatism, in its 
broadest sense, is a 
means of incorporating 
organized interests 
into the processes 
of government. 
There are two faces 
of corporatism. 
Authoritarian
corporatism (‘state’ 
corporatism) is an 
ideology or economic 
form closely associated 
with Italian Fascism. 
It was characterized 
by the political 
intimidation of industry 
and the destruction 
of independent 
trade unions. Liberal
corporatism (‘societal’ 
corporatism or 
‘neocorporatism’) 
refers to the tendency 
found in mature liberal 
democracies for 
organized interests to 
be granted privileged 
and institutional access 
to the process of policy 
formulation.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_12.indd 304 23-07-2024 12:50:18GROUPS, INTERESTS AND MOVEMENTS 305
Government, on the other hand, needs groups, both as a source of knowledge and 
information, and because the compliance of major interests is essential if policy is 
to be workable. In increasingly differentiated and complex industrial societies the 
need for consultation and bargaining continues to grow, with the result that, perhaps 
inevitably, institutional mechanisms emerge to facilitate it.
The drift towards corporatism in advanced capitalist states, particularly pronounced 
in the 1960s and 1970s, provoked deep misgivings about the role and power of 
interest groups. In the first place, corporatism considerably cut down the number 
and range of groups that enjoyed access to government. Corporatism invariably 
privileges economic or functional groups, because it leads to a form of tripartitism
that binds government to business and organized labour. However, it may leave 
consumer or promotional groups out in the cold, and institutionalized access is likely 
to be restricted to confederations that speak on behalf of a range of organizations and 
groups.
A second problem is that, in contrast to the pluralist model, corporatism portrays 
interest groups as hierarchically ordered and dominated by leaders who are not 
directly accountable to members. Indeed, it is sometimes argued that the price 
that group leaders pay for privileged access to government is a willingness to 
deliver the compliance of their members. From this point of view, ‘government by 
consultation’ may simply be a sham concealing the fact that corporatism acts as a 
mechanism of social control. Third, concern has been expressed about the threat 
that corporatism poses to representative democracy. Whereas pluralism suggests 
that group politics supplements the representative process, corporatism creates 
the spectre of decisions being made outside the reach of democratic control and 
through a process of bargaining that is in no way subject to public scrutiny. Finally, 
corporatism has been linked to the problem of government ‘overload’, in which 
government may effectively be ‘captured’ by consulted groups and thus be unable 
to resist their demands. This critique has been advanced most systematically by the 
New Right.
New Right model
The antipathy of the New Right towards interest groups is derived, ideologically, 
from the individualism that lies at the heart of neoliberal economics. Social groups 
and collective bodies of all kinds are therefore viewed with suspicion. This is clearly 
reflected in the New Right’s preference for a market economy driven by self-reliance 
and entrepreneurialism. However, the New Right has expressed particular concern 
about the alleged link between corporatism and escalating public spending and the 
associated problems of over-government.
New Right anti-corporatism has been influenced by public-choice theory, such as 
Mancur Olson’s The Logic of Collective Action (1965), which argued that people 
join interest groups largely to secure ‘public goods’ – goods that can be enjoyed by 
individuals regardless of whether they contribute to their acquisition or maintenance. 
A pay increase, for instance, is a public good in that workers who are not union 
members, or who choose not to strike in furtherance of the pay claim, benefit

equally with union members and those who did strike. This creates opportunities 
for individuals to become ‘free-riders’, reaping benefits without incurring the various 
costs that group membership may entail. This analysis is significant because it 
implies that there is no guarantee that the existence of a common interest will lead 
to the formation of an organization to advance or defend that interest. The pluralist 
assumption that all groups have some kind of political voice therefore becomes 
highly questionable. Olson also argued that group politics may often empower small 
groups at the expense of large ones. A larger membership encourages free-riding 
because individuals may calculate that the group’s effectiveness will be little impaired 
by their failure to participate.
This analysis was further developed in Olson’s later work, The Rise and Decline of 
Nations (1984), which advanced a trenchant critique of interest group activity, 
seeing it as a major determinant of the prosperity or economic failure of particular 
states. The UK and Australia, for example, were seen as suffering from ‘institutional 
sclerosis’. This occurred as strong networks of interest groups emerged that were 
typically dominated by coalitions of narrow, sectional interests, including trade 
unions, business organizations and professional associations. The message is that 
there is an inverse relationship between strong and well-organized interest groups, on 
the one hand, and economic growth and national prosperity on the other. Analyses 
like these had a powerful impact on New Right thinking. The clearest demonstration 
of this was the backlash against corporatism from the 1980s onwards, spearheaded 
in the USA by Reagan and in the UK by Thatcher. In the USA, this took the form of 
an attempt to deregulate the economy by weakening regulatory agencies; in the UK, 
it was evident in the marginalization and later abolition of corporatist bodies and a 
determined assault on trade union power.
Patterns of group politics
How important are interest groups?
It is widely accepted that interest-group activity is closely linked to economic and 
social development. Whereas agrarian or traditional societies tend to be dominated 
by a small number of interests, advanced industrial ones are complex and highly 
differentiated. Interest groups thus come to assume a central importance in 
mediating between the state and a more fragmented society, especially as the spread 
of education extends political awareness and organizational skills. However, the roles 
and significance of organized interests vary from system to system, from state to state, 
and over time. The principal factors determining group influence are the following:
 the political culture
 the institutional structure
 party politics
 the nature and style of public policy.
The political culture (see Chapter 9) is crucial for two reasons. First, it determines 
whether interest groups are viewed as legitimate or non-legitimate actors, whether 
CONCEPT
Public choice
Public-choice theory is 
a subfield of rational￾choice theory (see pp.
15–16). The ‘public’ 
character of public￾choice theory stems 
from its concern with 
the provision of so￾called ‘public goods’. 
These are goods that are 
delivered by government 
rather than the market, 
because (as with clean 
air) their benefit cannot 
be withheld from 
individuals who choose 
not to contribute to 
their provision. Public￾choice theorists have 
generally highlighted 
the failures and defects 
of government in this 
respect, focusing on 
issues such as the policy 
impact of self-serving 
bureaucrats, and the 
consequences of 
interest-group politics.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_12.indd 306 23-07-2024 12:50:18GROUPS, INTERESTS AND MOVEMENTS 307
their formation and influence is permitted and encouraged, or otherwise. Second, it 
affects the willingness of people to form or join organized interests or to engage in 
group politics. At one extreme, regimes can practise monism, suppressing all forms of 
voluntary associational activity in order to ensure a single, unchallengeable centre of 
state power. This typically occurs in military regimes and one-party states. Although 
no contemporary or historical state has succeeded in stamping out all forms of group 
or factional activity, monistic regimes at least push group activity underground or 
ensure that it is expressed through the party–state apparatus and is thus entangled 
with the political and ideological goals of the regime.
Pluralist regimes, on the other hand, not only permit group politics, but encourage 
and even, in some cases, require it. Groups may be asked to participate in policy 
formulation or to be represented on public bodies. One of the reasons for the generally 
high level of group activity found in the USA, for instance, is the recognition in 
US political culture of the right of private groups to be heard. This is enshrined in 
constitutional guarantees of free speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly 
and so forth. In Japan, the absence of clear distinctions between the public and private 
realms has created a political culture in which, in pre-democratic and democratic 
periods alike, a close relationship between government and business has been taken 
for granted.
By contrast, in some European states, organized interests are regarded with suspicion. 
This has traditionally been the case in France, where, influenced by Jacobin ideology,

DEBATING . . .
DO INTEREST GROUPS ENHANCE DEMOCRACY?
Controversy about interest groups largely centres on their impact on democracy and the distribution of political power. 
While pluralists view group politics as the very stuff of democracy, elitists and others claim that it weakens or undermines 
the democratic process. Do interest groups empower citizens and widen access to government, or do they strengthen 
special interests and narrow the distribution of power?
YES NO
Dispersing power. Interest groups empower groups 
of people who would otherwise be marginalized and 
lack political representation. Organized interests, for 
instance, give a political voice to minorities that tend to 
be ignored by political parties, which, because of electoral 
pressures, are more concerned about the views of 
numerically strong groups. Few people, moreover, exist 
outside the interest-group universe. Promotional groups 
are thus formed to act on behalf of people (such as the 
poor, the elderly or consumers) who find it difficult, for 
various reasons, to organize themselves, and the use of 
‘outsider’ tactics enables groups to exert influence even 
though they may lack wealth and institutional power.
Political education. Groups stimulate debate and 
discussion, helping to create a better-informed and 
more educated electorate. Not only do interest groups 
provide citizens with alternative sources of information, 
but their specialist knowledge and level of technical 
expertise may even, at times, rival those of government. 
This is particularly important when it means that 
radical or critical views (which are inconvenient to the 
political establishment) can be expressed. Further, 
interest groups do not support a single viewpoint but 
rival viewpoints; the most stimulating political debate 
often takes place between interest groups rather than 
between interest groups and government.
Boosting participation. While party membership and 
voter turnout decline, the number of groups and their 
membership size has steadily increased, meaning that 
organized interests have become the principal agents of 
participation in modern political systems. In particular, 
there has been an explosion of cause or promotional 
groups, as well as of NGOs. Not only has single-issue 
politics proved to be popular, but the grass-roots activism 
and decentralized organization embraced by many 
campaigning groups have often proved to be attractive 
to young people and to those who are disillusioned with 
conventional politics. 
Entrenching political inequality. Interest groups typically 
empower the already powerful. Interest groups that possess 
money, expertise, institutional leverage and privileged links 
to government are substantially more powerful than other 
groups, helping to create a ‘power elite’. At the heart of 
this elite are major corporations, whose influence, in most 
cases, greatly exceeds the influence of, say, trade unions, 
charities or environmental groups. By the same token, there 
are significant, and sometimes large, sections of society 
that benefit little from interest-group representation. This 
is usually because they lack resources and are difficult, or 
impossible, to organize.
Non-legitimate power. Unlike conventional politicians, 
interest group leaders are not popularly elected. Interest 
groups are therefore not publicly accountable, meaning that 
the influence they wield is not democratically legitimate. 
This problem is compounded by the fact that very few 
interest-groups operate on the basis of internal democracy. 
Leaders are rarely elected by their members and, when they 
are (as, sometimes, in the case of trade unions), turnout 
levels are typically low. Indeed, there has been a growing 
trend for interest groups to be dominated by a small number 
of senior professionals.
Subverting representative democracy. Interest groups 
exert influence in ways that are democratically questionable. 
Insider groups operate ‘behind closed doors’, their meetings 
with ministers and government officials being unseen by 
the public, the media or democratic representatives. No 
one knows (apart from occasional leaks) who said what 
to whom, or who influenced whom, and how. Groups 
subvert representative democracy by both circumventing 
assemblies and forging direct links with executives, and 
exerting control over parties and politicians through 
the provision of campaign finance. Protest groups also 
undermine democracy when they achieve their objectives 
through the use of direct action, operating outside the 
established legal and constitutional framework. 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_12.indd 308 23-07-2024 12:50:19GROUPS, INTERESTS AND MOVEMENTS 309
groups have been seen to both undermine the ‘general will’ of the people and 
challenge the strength and unity of the French state. At its high point in 1975, for 
instance, only 24 per cent of the French workforce belonged to a union, a figure that 
had fallen to 8 per cent by 2008. However, French political culture also embodies a 
tradition of direct action. This has been demonstrated variously by the use by French 
farmers of roadblocks and even lorry hijacks, by the rebellion of students and trade 
unionists during the political troubles of May 1968, and by clashes between ‘yellow 
vest’ (gilets jaunes) protesters and the police that began in November 2018.
The institutional structure of government is clearly significant in terms of interest￾group activity in that it establishes points of access to the policy process. Unitary 
and centralized political systems, such as the UK’s, tend to narrow the scope of 
group politics and concentrate it around the executive branch of government. 
Although this does not condemn groups to a marginal existence, it places heavy 
emphasis on ‘insider’ status and broadens the capacity of the government of the day 
to choose whether or not to respond to group pressure. This has been most clearly 
demonstrated in the UK since the 1980s in the downgrading of corporatist bodies 
and the marginalization of the trade unions. Interest-group activity in France is 
similarly focused on direct consultation with the administration, particularly since 
the strengthening of presidential government and the weakening of the National 
Assembly in the Fifth Republic.
The US government, on the other hand, is fragmented and decentralized. This reflects 
the impact of bicameralism, the separation of powers, federalism and judicial review. 
The range of ‘access points’ that this offers to interest groups makes the US system 
peculiarly vulnerable to group pressures. Groups know, for instance, that battles 
lost in Congress can be refought in the courts, at the state or local level and so on. 
Although this undoubtedly acts as a stimulus to group formation, and enlarges the 
number of influential groups, it may also be self-defeating, in that the activities of 
groups can end up cancelling each other out.
The relationship between political parties and interest groups is always complex. In 
some senses, they are clearly rivals. While parties seek to aggregate interests and form 
political programmes typically based on broad ideological goals, interest groups 
are concerned with a narrower and more specific range of issues and objectives. 
Nevertheless, interest groups often seek to exert influence in and through parties, in 
some cases even spawning parties in an attempt to gain direct access to power. Many 
socialist parties, such as the UK Labour Party, were effectively created by the trade 
unions, and institutional and financial links, albeit modified, endure to this day.
The pattern of interest-group politics is also influenced by the party system. 
Dominant-party systems tend, quite naturally, to narrow the focus of group politics, 
concentrating it on the governing party. Major industrial and commercial interests 
in Italy and Japan therefore traditionally tried to exert pressure through ‘ruling’ 
parties such as the Christian Democrats and the Liberal Democratic Party, which, 
in the process, did much to entrench the factional tendencies within these parties. 
Multi-party systems, on the other hand, are fertile ground for interest-group activity, 
because they broaden the scope of access. The legislative influence of interest groups 
is perhaps greatest in party systems like the USA’s, in which political parties are 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_12.indd 309 23-07-2024 12:50:19310 POLITICS
weak in terms of both organization and discipline. This was demonstrated in the late 
1970s by the capacity of business interests effectively to destroy President Carter’s 
energy programme, despite the existence of Democrat majorities in both the House 
of Representatives and the Senate.
Finally, the level of group activity fluctuates in relation to shifts in public policy,
particularly the degree to which the state intervenes in economic and social life. As a 
general rule, interventionism goes hand in hand with corporatism, although there is 
a debate about which is the cause and which is the effect. Do interventionist policies 
force government into a closer relationship with organized interests in the hope of 
gaining information, advice and cooperation? Or do groups exploit their access to 
government to extract subsidies, supports and other benefits for their members? 
Whatever the answer, it is clear that, amongst Western states, the integration of 
organized interests, particularly functional interests, into public life has been taken 
furthest where social-democratic policies have been pursued.
The Swedish system is the classic example of this. Interest groups constitute an 
integral part of the Swedish political scene at every level. There are close, if not 
institutional, links between the trade unions and the Social Democratic Labour Party. 
The legislative process in the Riksdag is geared to wide consultation with affected 
interests, and state officials recognize ‘peak’ associations such as the Swedish Trade 
Union Confederation and the Employers’ Confederation as ‘social partners’. A similar 
pattern of corporate representation has developed in the Austrian ‘chamber’ system, 
which provides statutory representation for major interests such as commerce, 
agriculture and labour. In Germany, key economic groups such as the Federation 
of German Employers’ Associations, the Federation of German Industry and the 
German Trades Union Federation are so closely involved in policy formulation that 
the system has been described as one of ‘polyarchic elitism’.
How do groups exert influence?
Interest groups have at their disposal a broad range of tactics and political strategies. 
Indeed, it is almost unthinkable that a group should confine itself to a single strategy 
or try to exert influence through just one channel of influence. The methods that 
groups use vary according to a number of factors. These include the issue with which 
the group is concerned and how policy in that area is shaped. Similarly, the nature 
of the group and the resources at its disposal are crucial determinants of its political 
strategy. These resources include the following:
 public sympathy for the group and its goals
 the size of its membership or activist base
 its financial strength and organizational capabilities
 its ability to use sanctions that in some way inconvenience or disrupt government
 personal or institutional links it may have to political parties or government 
bodies.
Interventionism:
Government policies 
designed to regulate 
or manage economic 
life; more broadly, a 
policy of engagement or 
involvement.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_12.indd 310 23-07-2024 12:50:19GROUPS, INTERESTS AND MOVEMENTS 311
Business groups are more likely than, say, trade unions or consumer groups to employ 
professional lobbyists or mount expensive public-relations campaigns, because, quite 
simply, they have the financial capacity to do so. The methods used by interest groups 
are shaped by the channel of access through which influence is exerted.
In all states, interest-group activity tends to centre on the bureaucracy as the key 
institution in the process of policy formulation. Access via this channel is largely 
confined to major economic and functional groups, such as large corporations, 
employers’ associations, trade unions, farming interests and key professions. In 
Austria, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian states, for example, corporatist 
institutions have been developed specifically to facilitate group consultation, usually 
giving these peak groups representing employers’ and employees’ interests a measure 
of formal representation. More commonly in other political systems, the consultative 
process is informal yet institutionalized, taking place through meetings and regular 
contacts that are rarely publicized and are beyond the scope of public scrutiny.
The crucial relationship here is usually that between senior bureaucrats and leading 
business or industrial interests. The advantages that business groups enjoy in this 
respect include the key role they play in the economy as producers, investors and 
employers, the overlap in social background and political outlets between business 
leaders and ministers and senior officials, and the widely held public belief that 
business interests coincide with the national interest. The relationship is a necessary 
one on some level – changing something like health care policy is enormously 
complex and may involve coordination with hundreds of interest groups and large 
corporations, from pharmaceutical manufacturers to health insurers. Bureaucrats 
rely to some degree on the expertise and compliance of such groups to make policy 
changes workable, but there is a fine line to tread, and the relationship can easily 
become too cosy. This relationship is often consolidated by a ‘revolving door’ through 
which bureaucrats, on retirement, move into well-paid jobs in private business. In 
Japan this practice is so clearly established that it is known as amakudari, literally 
meaning ‘descent from heaven’. Two factors that have further strengthened big 
business’s control over ministers and bureaucrats are the greater ease with which 
corporations can relocate production and investment in a global economy, and the 
advent of the ‘new’ public management (see p. 415) in which governments become 
increasingly dependent on the private sector for investment in, and sometimes the 
delivery of, public services (Monbiot 2001).
Influence exerted through the legislature, often called lobbying (see p. 311), is another 
important form of interest-group activity. One manifestation of this is the growth in 
the number of professional lobbyists, more than 12,000 of whom were registered 
in Washington DC in 2022. Interest-group activity surrounding the US Congress is 
usually seen as the most intense in the world. This reflects the strength of Congress 
in terms of its constitutional independence and powerful committee system, and the 
fact that its decentralized party system allows individual representatives to be easily 
recruited by groups and causes. Much of this influence is exerted through financial 
contributions made to election campaigns by political action committees (PACs). For 
example, the National Rifle Association (NRA) owes much of its considerable power 
on Capitol Hill to the success of its PAC, the Political Victory Fund, in challenging 
CONCEPT
Lobby
The term lobby is 
derived from the 
areas in parliaments or 
assemblies where the 
public may petition 
legislators, or politicians 
meet to discuss political 
business. In modern 
usage, the term is both 
a verb and a noun. 
The verb ‘to lobby’ 
means to make direct 
representations to a 
policymaker, using 
argument or persuasion. 
Broadly, ‘a lobby’ (noun) 
is equivalent to an 
interest group, in that 
both aim to influence 
public policy, as in the 
case of the farm lobby, 
the environmental lobby 
and the roads lobby. 
Narrowly, following US 
practice, a lobbyist is a 
‘professional persuader’: 
that is, a person hired to 
represent the arguments 
of interest-group 
clients.

gun-control candidates for Congress and supporting gun-owners’ rights candidates. 
In 2016, the NRA had an estimated membership of over 6 million and during that 
election year was able to raise some $366 million to spend on political activities.
Policy networks (see p. 405) have also developed through institutionalized contacts 
between legislators (particularly key figures on legislative committees) and ‘affected’ 
groups and interests. In the USA these form two ‘legs’ (executive agencies being 
the third leg) of the so-called ‘iron triangles’ that dominate much of domestic 
policy-making. Like bureaucrats, however, there is an element of necessity to the 
relationship – legislators are required to make decisions on a staggering array of 
issues, most which they are not likely to be experts on. Some scholars have found 
that lobbyists act a sort of ‘adjunct staff ’ to legislators, providing them with crucial 
policy information and political intelligence that allows them to do their jobs (Hall 
and Deardorff 2006). As lobbyists are not neutral brokers of information, however, 
and some interest groups are better funded and lobby more effectively than others, 
the view legislators have through this process will invariably be distorted. Lobbying 
activities focused on the legislature are less extensive and less significant in states like 
Canada and the UK in which party discipline is strong and parliaments are usually 
subject to executive control. Nevertheless, a US-style lobbying industry has spread 
internationally. Scandals over lobbyist influence and access in the UK, Germany 
and Austria in recent decades have prompted attempts to better limit and make 
transparent the activities of lobbyists.
In systems in which the courts are unable to challenge legislation and rarely check 
executive actions, interest-group activity focused on the judiciary is of only limited 
significance. This applies in states like the UK and New Zealand, despite a general 
tendency since the 1990s towards judicial activism, which has encouraged civil 
liberties and environmentalist groups in particular to fight campaigns through the 
courts. Where codified constitutions invest judges with the formal power of judicial 
review, however, as in Australia and the USA, the court system attracts far greater 
attention from interest groups. Civil rights organizations like NAACP in the USA 
throughout the twentieth century used a variety of tactics, from direct action to 
political lobbying, to achieve its goals, but perhaps its most notable victories came 
through the courts, including the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling 
in 1954, which rejected the constitutionality of segregation laws. The NAACP had 
lobbied the US legal community for several years to shift attitudes on issues such as 
race and segregation and helped to sponsor the case. The American Civil Liberties 
Union, which seeks to defend individual liberties and the constitutional rights of 
citizens, often uses litigation and legal briefs to advance its cause, and has frequently 
won cases before the Supreme Court.
Interest-group pressure is often also exerted through political parties. In some cases, 
parties and groups are so closely linked by historical, ideological and even institutional 
ties that they are best thought of as simply two wings of the same social movement. 
The UK and Australian Labour parties began in this way, and still function, if to a 
lesser extent, as part of a broader labour movement. Agrarian parties such as the 
Centre parties in Sweden and Norway are still part of a broad farmers’ movement, 
and even Christian Democratic parties in central Europe can be seen as part of a 
Iron triangle: A closed, 
mutually supportive 
relationship in US politics 
between an executive 
agency, a special 
interest group and a 
legislative committee or 
subcommittee.

broad Catholic movement. In other cases, however, the relationship between parties 
and groups is more pragmatic and instrumental.
The principal means through which groups influence parties is via campaign 
finance, and the benefits they hope to achieve are clear: ‘he who pays the piper calls 
the tune’. Throughout the world, conservative or right-wing parties and candidates 
are funded largely by business contributions, while support for socialist or left-wing 
ones traditionally came mainly from organized labour. Spending levels are higher 
in the USA, where Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump together spent $6.8 billion 
during the 2016 presidential election campaign, mainly donated by business or 
corporate interests. However, groups may also have good reasons for avoiding too 
close an association with parties. For one thing, if ‘their’ party is in opposition, the 
government of the day may be less sympathetic to their interests; for another, open 
partisanship may restrict their ability to recruit members from amongst supporters of 
other parties. As a result, groups such as Shelter and the Child Poverty Action Group 
in the UK have assiduously guarded their non-partisan status. There are, in addition, 
examples of political parties that have sought to ‘divorce’ themselves from interest 
groups. In the 1990s, the UK Labour Party thus reduced the influence of affiliated 
trade unions at every level in the party in an attempt to destroy the image that the 
Labour Party is merely a puppet of the union movement. However, as this was being 
achieved, the party was also engaged in a ‘charm offensive’ to attract business backers, 
the success of which helped to consolidate its shift to the ideological middle ground.
Very different methods are employed by groups that seek to influence government 
indirectly via the media and public opinion campaigns. Tactics here range from petitions, 
protests and demonstrations to civil disobedience and even the tactical use of violence. 
Interest groups use such methods for one of two reasons. They may either reflect the 
group’s outsider status and its inability to gain direct access to policymakers, or they 
may follow from the nature of the group’s activist base or the character of its ideological 
goals. The traditional practitioners of this form of politics were trade unions, which 
utilized their ‘industrial muscle’ in the form of strikes, pickets and marches. However, 
the spectacular rise of promotional groups since the 1960s has seen the emergence of 
new styles of activist politics practised by peace campaigners, environmental lobbyists, 
animal rights groups, anti-roads protesters and so on. A common aim of these groups 
is to attract media attention and stimulate public awareness and sympathy. The internet 
and social media have transformed the nature of such campaigns, giving outsider 
groups much greater access to platforms to reach millions of people, even without the 
help of the mainstream media, as explored later in the chapter.
Finally, since the closing decades of the twentieth century, interest-group activity 
has increasingly adjusted to the impact of globalization and the strengthening 
of international organizations. Amongst the groups best suited to take advantage 
of such shifts are charities and environmental campaigners that already possess 
transnational structures and an international membership. Since its creation in 
1961, Amnesty International has developed into a global organization with fifty-two 
sections worldwide and a presence in about 100 more countries, and over 3 million 
members and supporters. Many NGOs enjoy formal representation on international 
bodies or at international conferences; some 2,400 representatives of NGOs were, for 
CONCEPT
Civil disobedience
Civil disobedience is 
law-breaking that is 
justified by reference to 
‘higher’ religious, moral 
or political principles. 
Civil disobedience is an 
overt and public act; it 
aims to break a law in 
order to make a point, 
not to get away with it. 
Indeed, its moral force 
is based largely on the 
willing acceptance of 
the penalties that follow 
from law-breaking. 
This both emphasizes 
the conscientious or 
principled nature of 
the act and provides 
evidence of the depth of 
feeling or commitment 
that lies behind it. The 
moral character of civil 
disobedience is normally 
demonstrated by the 
strict avoidance of 
violence.

instance, present at the 1992 Rio ‘Earth Summit’. The better-funded NGOs now have 
permanent offices in New York and Brussels, which monitor the work of the United 
Nations and European Union respectively, and conduct regular lobbying campaigns. 
Some commentators have argued the new global capital for lobbying is rapidly 
becoming Brussels, as an estimated 25,000 lobbyists and 2,600 interest groups operate 
there trying to influence the policies of the EU (The Economist 2021). Sectional 
interest groups in EU member states have adjusted to the fact that, in a number 
of policy areas, key decisions are increasingly made by EU institutions rather than 
national ones. This particularly applies in relation to agriculture, trade agreements, 
competition policy and social and workers’ rights. The most financially powerful 
and best-organized groups operating at the EU level are undoubtedly business 
interests. Their influence is exerted in various ways: through direct lobbying by large 
corporations, and through the activities of a new range of EU peak groups such as the 
European Round Table of Industrialists and the Union of Industrial and Employers’ 
Confederations of Europe (UNICE). Much of the lobbying in the EU focuses on 
influencing the work of the Commission in Brussels and Parliament in Strasbourg 
and tends to depend on building up long-term relationships based on trust (see p.
501) and reciprocity. However, in 2022 the Qatargate scandal revealed a much more 
sinister and aggressive form of direct lobbying, after millions in laundered cash and 
equipment were seized by police in connection with bribery and influence-buying 
amongst several European members of parliament by the government of Qatar. The 
scandal has also been connected with an NGO that lobbies for human rights, raising 
concerning questions about how well the agendas of various groups in Brussels are 
understood.
POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
ENVIRONMENTAL INTEREST GROUPS: A DILEMMA OF TACTICS
In late 2018, fifteen-year-old Swedish school student 
Greta Thunberg decided to stop attending school on 
Fridays and instead sit outside the Swedish Parliament 
by holding up a sign calling for action on climate change. 
Her blunt, no-nonsense style and her ‘Fridays for Future’ 
campaign quickly gained attention on social media. By 2019, 
hundreds of thousands of students in dozens of countries 
had joined the Friday strikes. Inspired by Thunberg, in 
the years since, dozens of youth environmental groups 
have formed that have focused on dramatic direct action 
to draw more attention to the climate crisis. In 2021, a 
movement called the Tyre Extinguishers appeared, with 
teenagers placing lentils in the valve caps of SUVs and 
other high-emission vehicles, which would cause the tyres 
to deflate without damaging them. In 2022, the Just Stop 
Oil group formed and attempted to disrupt oil operations 
in the UK by standing in front of terminals, blocking roads 
and climbing onto oil tankers. In mid-2022 they gained 
worldwide attention after gluing themselves to the walls 
in art galleries and throwing soup on Vincent van Gogh’s 
Sunflowers.

‘NEW’ SOCIAL MOVEMENTS
Interest in social movements has been revived by the emergence of so-called ‘new’ 
social movements since the 1960s: the women’s movement, the environmental 
or green movement, the peace movement and so on. What is ‘new’ about these 
movements? In the first place, whereas their more traditional counterparts were 
movements of the oppressed or disadvantaged, contemporary social movements 
have more commonly attracted the young, the better-educated and the relatively 
affluent. This is linked to the second difference: new movements typically have a 
postmaterial (see p. 221) orientation, being more concerned with ‘quality of life’ 
Some expressed sympathy and support for this new 
wave of activism, noting that after decades of inaction, 
dramatic moves are needed to force attention on the 
growing climate crisis. Moreover, these new protests were 
a legitimate expression of frustration amongst the youth 
who have a limited voice in the political process but will 
one day inherit the planet. Other commentators, though, 
vehemently denounced the actions as vandalism unrelated 
to climate policy, and ultimately counterproductive, as it 
encourages the public to see environmental causes as 
extremist rather than legitimate interests.
The debate over the tactics of the environmental 
movement is nothing new – since its beginnings in the 
1960s, different strands of environmental activism have 
emerged with sometimes radically different approaches 
to achieving their goals. Direct action remains some of 
the most visible in the eyes of the public. Organized mass 
protests, sit-ins and strikes have long been mainstays of 
groups like Greenpeace. These tactics were particularly 
effective in the 1960s and 1970s, when public awareness 
of environmental problems was relatively low. And in some 
cases, public pressure campaigns forced policy changes – 
the anti-nuclear movement across the Western world, for 
instance, was surprisingly successful, and since the 1970s 
very few nuclear plants have been commissioned. Yet some 
groups desired to go further. Groups like Earth First! and 
the Earth Liberation Front had their roots in anarchist and 
anti-capitalist ideologies, and thus saw their movements as 
opposing the established economic and political system as 
well as advocating for the environment. Radical activism 
soon emerged as their chosen tactic, some going as far as 
to physically disrupt or even sabotage industrial facilities, 
eliciting both support and condemnation.
Still others sought a political route. In the Australian state 
of Tasmania, activists and protesters trying to stop a dam 
from being built formed a political party in 1972 to field 
candidates at the next state election. It was the first green 
political party in the world, and since winning parliamentary 
seats in 1989 has been the key player in state politics. Many 
countries have  since had their own green political parties 
form, and since the 2000s, some have achieved electoral 
breakthroughs and significant representation, even cabinet 
positions, in various governments. This has allowed much 
more direct influence over political decision-making. 
Inevitably, though, many green parties have moderated or 
discontinued much of their radicalism in order to broaden 
their electoral appeal and to negotiate with other parties 
to pass legislation. Grass-roots activists though have 
sometimes derided such parties as ‘selling out’ to mainstream 
interests and compromising their values for power.
Still more groups have chosen a third route. The Sierra 
Club is one of the oldest environmental organizations 
in the United States, predating much of the modern 
movement. A member-driven nature society, it has largely 
avoided radicalism, instead seeking to lobby government 
behind the scenes. It has commissioned scientific studies 
to attempt to persuade bureaucrats and industry, and 
used endorsements and donations to attempt to get like￾minded politicians elected. And in recent decades, it has 
had particular success with the Beyond Coal campaign, 
which has used courts, regulatory boards and local 
government processes to block or rescind permits for 
more than 150 coal power plants. These activities have 
rarely been publicized – indeed, some of its proponents 
argue that it has been successful exactly because of that, 
using the behind-the-scenes tactics large corporations 
have traditionally used themselves.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_12.indd 315 23-07-2024 12:50:19316 POLITICS
issues than with social advancement. Although the women’s movement, for example, 
addresses material concerns such as equal pay and equal opportunities, it draws from 
a broader set of values associated with gender equality and opposition to patriarchy. 
Third, while traditional movements had little in common and seldom worked in 
tandem, new social movements subscribe to a common, if not always clearly defined, 
ideology. In broad terms, their ideological stance is linked to New Left ideas and 
values. Such a stance challenges prevailing social goals and political styles, and 
embraces libertarian aspirations such as personal fulfilment and self-expression. It 
is therefore not surprising that there is a significant membership overlap, as well as 
mutual sympathy, amongst the women’s, environmental, animal rights, peace, anti￾roads, ‘anti-capitalist’ or anti-globalization and other movements.
Another difference between traditional and new social movements is that the latter 
tend to have organizational structures that stress decentralization and participatory 
decision-making and have also developed new forms of political activism. They thus 
practise what is sometimes called ‘new politics’, which turns away from ‘established’ 
parties, interest groups and representative processes towards a more innovative and 
theatrical form of protest politics. The most dramatic early examples of this have been 
the so-called ‘Battle of Seattle’ in 1999, in which mass demonstrations against the 
World Trade Organization degenerated into violent clashes between the police and 
groups of protesters, and other similar ‘anti-capitalist’ or anti-globalization protests, 
for example, in the Occupy movement that sprang up in 2011. Such demonstrations 
involve a disparate range of environmental, development, ethnic nationalist, anarchist 
and revolutionary socialist groups, with the internet and mobile phones providing 
the principal means of communication. The ideas of the emergent anti-globalization 
movement have been articulated in the writing of authors such as Noam Chomsky 
(see p. 227) and Naomi Klein.
The diffuse and decentralized nature of new social movements has been further 
enhanced by the large-scale horizontal communication that has been made possible 
by the advent of the internet age. Contemporary social movements are often, 
CONCEPT
Social movement
A social movement is 
a particular form of 
collective behaviour 
in which the motive 
to act springs largely 
from the attitudes and 
aspirations of members, 
typically acting within 
a loose organizational 
framework. Being part 
of a social movement 
requires a level of 
commitment and 
political activism, rather 
than formal or card￾carrying membership: 
above all, movements 
move. A movement 
is different from 
spontaneous mass 
action (such as an 
uprising or rebellion), in 
that it implies a level of 
intended and planned 
action in pursuit of a 
recognized social goal.

NAOMI KLEIN (BORN 1970)
Canadian journalist, author and anti-corporate activist. Klein’s No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand 
Bullies (2000) is a wide-ranging critique of lifestyle branding and labour abuses, and discusses 
emerging forms of resistance to globalization and corporate domination. It has been described 
as ‘the book that became part of the movement’, but has had wider significance in provoking 
reflection on the nature of consumer capitalism and the tyranny of brand culture. Klein is 
a frequent and influential media commentator. She lives in Toronto but travels throughout 
North America, Asia, Latin America and Europe tracking the rise of anti-corporate activism 
and supporting movements campaigning against the negative effects of globalization. Her 
writings also include The Shock Doctrine (2008), which analyses the rise of ‘disaster capitalism’.

therefore, online social movements. Not only do the internet and social media 
facilitate cheap and immediate communication between and among activists and 
greatly enhance their access to information, but they are also highly effective in 
spreading the message of the movement. An example of how digital communication 
helped a social movement to gain influence and to grow at remarkable speed is the 
Occupy movement. Occupy started life as a loosely organized demonstration of about 
5,000 people who, in September 2011, gathered in New York and started to make 
their way to Zuccotti Park, located in the Wall Street financial district. Setting up a 
semi-permanent protest camp, their chief slogan was: ‘Occupy Wall Street!’. Within 
a month, tens of thousands of similar Occupy protesters had taken to the streets in 
some eighty-two countries around the world, affecting more than 750 towns and 
cities.
The emergence of a new generation of social movements practising new styles 
of activism has significantly shifted views about the nature and significance of 
movements themselves. The experience of totalitarianism (see p. 78) in the period 
between the two world wars encouraged mass society theorists such as Erich Fromm 
(1900–80) and Hannah Arendt (see p. 8) to see movements in distinctly negative 
terms. From the mass society perspective, Fromm speculated that social movements 
had a psychological basis and reflected an ‘escape from freedom’ (Fromm 1941) – 
an attempt by alienated individuals to achieve security and identity through 
commitment to a cause and obedience to a leader. In contrast, new social movements 
are usually interpreted as rational and instrumental actors, whose use of informal 
and unconventional means merely reflects the resources available to them (Zald and 
McCarthy 1987). The emergence of new social movements is widely seen as evidence 
of the fact that power in postindustrial societies is increasingly dispersed and 
fragmented. The class-based politics of old has thus been replaced by a new politics 
based on what Laclau and Mouffe (2001) called ‘democratic pluralism’. Not only do 
new movements offer new and rival centres of power, but they also diffuse power 
more effectively by resisting bureaucratization and developing more spontaneous, 
affective and decentralized forms of organization.
CONCEPT
New Left
The New Left comprises 
the thinkers and 
intellectual movements 
(prominent in the 1960s 
and early 1970s) that 
sought to revitalize 
socialist thought by 
developing a radical 
critique of advanced 
industrial society. The 
New Left rejected both 
‘old’ left alternatives: 
Soviet-style state 
socialism and de￾radicalized Western 
social democracy. 
Common themes within 
the New Left include a 
fundamental rejection 
of conventional 
society (‘the system’) 
as oppressive, 
disillusionment with the 
role of the working class 
as the revolutionary 
agent, and a preference 
for decentralization 
and participatory 
democracy.
KEY THINKER
BETTY FRIEDAN (1921–2006)
US feminist and political activist. Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique (1963) is often 
credited with having stimulated the emergence of ‘second wave’ feminism, and the broader 
women’s liberation movement of the 1960s. In it, she examined ‘the problem with no name’: 
the sense of frustration and despair afflicting suburban American women. In 1966, she helped 
to found the National Organization of Women (NOW), becoming its first president. In The 
Second Stage (1981), Friedan drew attention to the danger that the pursuit of ‘personhood’ 
might encourage women to deny the importance of children, the home and the family. Her 
later writings include The Fountain of Age (1993).

political rootlessness;

pessimistic trends in

Nevertheless, the impact of social movements is more difficult to assess than that 
of political parties or interest groups. This is because of the broader nature of 
their goals, and because, to some extent, they exert influence through less tangible 
cultural strategies. However, it is clear that, in cases like the women’s movement 
and the environmental movement, profound political changes have been achieved 
through shifts in cultural values and moral attitudes brought about over a number 
of years. For example, the Women’s Liberation Movement (WLM) emerged in the 
1960s as a collection of groups and organizations mobilized by the emerging ideas 
of ‘second wave’ feminism, as expressed in the writings of such as Betty Friedan (see 
p. 317), Germaine Greer (1970) and Kate Millett (1970). Despite the achievement 
by the women’s movement of advances in specific areas, such as equal pay and the 
legalization of abortion, perhaps its most significant achievement is in increasing 
general awareness of gender issues and the eroding of support for patriarchal attitudes 
and institutions. This is a cultural change that has had a deep, if unquantifiable, 
impact on public policy at many levels.

CHAPTER 13
CONSTITUTIONS, 
LAW AND JUDGES
PREVIEW
In the 1950s and 1960s, the study of constitutions and constitutional issues became distinctly unfashionable. 
Political analysts turned instead to what were seen as deeper political realities, such as political culture and the 
distribution of economic and social power. To be interested in constitutions was to perpetuate an outdated, legalistic 
and, frankly, boring approach to politics – to focus on how a political system portrays itself, rather than on how it 
actually works. Since the 1970s, however, constitutional questions have moved to the centre of the political stage. 
Constitutions have become battlegrounds not just for legalistic questions about how political systems work, but 
also fundamental questions of human rights. Hot-button social issues, like the right to privacy, marriage, adoption, 
abortion, citizenship and free speech have played out in courts of law as much as they have legislatures and elections.
Such issues, in turn, have had major implications for the role of law and the position of judges. Law has widely 
been seen as a vital guarantee of public order, but disagreement about the relationship between law, society and 
morality, and especially about the extent to which law should uphold individual freedom, have long been core 
themes in political theory. As far as the position of judges is concerned, although the courts have usually been 
viewed as strictly separate from politics, in many parts of the world they have acquired a growing capacity to shape 
public policy. This has encouraged a search for a revised balance between judicial, executive and legislative power, 
and also calls for the reform of the courts and the judiciary.

CONSTITUTIONS
Nature and origins
Traditionally, constitutions have been associated with two key purposes. First, they 
were believed to provide a description of government itself, a neat introduction to 
major institutions and their roles. Second, they were regarded as the linchpin of 
liberal democracy (see p. 108), even its defining feature. Sadly, neither view is correct. 
While constitutions may aim to lay down a framework in which government and 
political activity are conducted, none has been entirely successful in this respect. 
Inaccuracies, distortions and omissions can be found in all constitutions. Similarly, 
although the idea of constitutionalism (see p. 327) is closely linked to liberal values 
and aspirations, there is nothing to prevent a constitution being undemocratic or 
authoritarian.
Why, then, bother with constitutions? Why include in an account of the machinery 
of government a discussion of constitutions? The reason is that the objective of 
constitutions is to lay down certain meta-rules for the political system. In effect, 
these are the rules that govern the government itself. Just as government establishes 
ordered rule in society at large, the purpose of a constitution is to bring stability, 
predictability and order to the actions of government.
The idea of a code of rules providing guidance for the conduct of government has an 
ancient lineage. These codes traditionally drew on the idea of a higher moral power, 
usually religious in character, to which worldly affairs were supposed to conform. 
Egyptian pharaohs acknowledged the authority of Ma’at or ‘justice’, Chinese 
emperors were subject to Ti’en or ‘heaven’, Jewish kings conformed to the Mosaic Law 
and Islamic caliphs paid respect to Shari’a law. Not uncommonly, ‘higher’ principles 
were also enacted in ordinary law, as seen, for example, in the distinction in the 
Athenian constitution between the nomos (laws that could be changed only by a 
special procedure) and the psephismata (decrees that could be passed by a resolution 
of the assembly). However, such ancient codes did not amount to constitutions in the 
modern sense, in that they generally failed to lay down specific provisions relating 
to the authority and responsibilities of the various institutions, and rarely established 
authoritative mechanisms through which provisions could be enforced and breaches 
of the fundamental law punished.
The first documents that began to do this appeared in the Middle Ages, though the 
focus was often limited. Japan’s ‘Seventeen-Article Constitution’ of 604, for instance, 
does lay down some rules for imperial government, though it focuses heavily on 
the virtues expected of government officials. The Manden Charter of Kurukan 
Fuga, promulgated in the Malian Empire of West Africa around 1235, is a more 
comprehensive early example, insofar as it took what had previously been traditional, 
oral and tribal understandings of government and documented them, while explicitly 
establishing basic human, social and economic rights. Constitutions in the modern 
sense, however, began during the Age of Enlightenment, with Sweden’s Instrument of 
Government in 1634, the US constitution in 1787 and the French Declaration of the 
Rights of Man and the Citizen in 1789. The examples of the USA and revolutionary 
France not only provided in form and substance a model for later constitution-makers 
to follow, but also shed light on why and how constitutions come about.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 321 23-07-2024 12:51:51322 POLITICS
The enactment of a constitution often marks a major breach in political continuity, 
usually resulting from an upheaval such as a war, revolution or national independence. 
Constitutions are, above all, a means of establishing a new political order following 
the rejection, collapse or failure of an old order. In general, it can be said that political 
conflicts assume a constitutional dimension only when those demanding change seek 
to redraw, and not merely re-adjust, the rules of the political game. Constitutional 
change is therefore about the reapportionment of both power and political authority.
CONCEPT
Constitution
A constitution is a set 
of rules, written and 
unwritten, that seek 
to establish the duties, 
powers and functions of 
the various institutions 
of government; regulate 
the relationships 
between them; and 
define the relationship 
between the state 
and the individual. 
The balance between 
written (legal) and 
unwritten (customary 
or conventional) rules 
varies from system 
to system. The term 
‘constitution’ is also used 
more narrowly to refer 
to a single, authoritative 
document (a ‘written’ 
constitution), the aim 
of which is to codify 
major constitutional 
provisions; it constitutes 
the highest law in the 
land.
The US Constitution (1787) was an early written constitution that provided a model 
for many later examples.

Constitutions can be classified in many different ways. These include the following:
 the form of the constitution and status of its rules (whether the constitution is 
written or unwritten, or codified or uncodified)
 the ease with which the constitution can be changed (whether it is rigid or flexible)
 the degree to which the constitution is observed in practice (whether it is an 
effective, nominal or façade constitution)
 the content of the constitution and the institutional structure that it establishes 
(whether it is, for example, monarchical or republican, federal or unitary, or 
presidential or parliamentary).
Written and unwritten constitutions
Traditionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on the distinction between 
written and unwritten constitutions. Written constitutions are, in theory, constitutions 
that are enshrined in laws, while unwritten constitutions are embodied in custom 
and tradition (see p. 87). The former are human artefacts, in the sense that they have 
been ‘created’, while the latter have been seen as organic entities that have evolved 
through history.
This system of classification, however, has now largely been abandoned. In the first 
place, an overwhelming majority of states now possess basic written documents 
that lay down constitutional provisions. Only a handful of states, such as the 
United Kingdom, Israel, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand, are considered to have 
constitutions that are largely unwritten, but even then there are usually certain 
statutes or ‘basic laws’ that are considered to play a constitutional role. Moreover, 
the written/unwritten classification has always been misleading. No constitution is 
entirely written, in the sense that all its rules are formal and legally enforceable. Few 
constitutions, for instance, specify the roles of, or even mention, political parties and 
interest groups. Similarly, no constitution is entirely unwritten, in the sense that none 
of its provisions have any legal substance. Every constitution is a blend of written and 
unwritten rules, although the balance varies significantly. In countries such as France 
and Germany, in which constitutional documents specify in considerable detail the 
powers and responsibilities of political institutions, the emphasis is clearly on written 
rules. The US constitution is, however, a document of only 7,000 words that confines 
itself, in the main, to broad principles, and so lays down only a loose framework 
for government. US institutions of undoubted constitutional significance, such as 
Congressional committees, primary elections (see p. 279) and the bureaucracy (see 
Chapter 16), have simply evolved over time. Other constitutions, even when written, 
place considerable stress on conventions. For example, the Australian constitution 
runs to 128 sections over eight chapters, but not once is the prime minister, the leader 
of the government and most important figure in Australian politics, described or 
even mentioned. The role and powers of the prime minister are instead understood 
as Westminster parliamentary conventions, inherited from the British system of 
government, which is itself largely uncodified. The contemporary trend, however, 
is to favour the adoption of written and formal rules. Not only has the number of 
unwritten constitutions diminished, but also, within them, there has been a growing 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 323 23-07-2024 12:51:52324 POLITICS
reliance on legal rules. For example, the passage in New Zealand of the Constitution 
Act 1986 and the adoption in 1990 of a bill of rights (see p. 331) has been interpreted 
by many commentators as indicating that New Zealand should no longer be classified 
amongst the ranks of states with unwritten constitutions.
More helpful (and more accurate) than the written/unwritten distinction is the contrast 
between codified and uncodified constitutions. A codified constitution is one that 
is based on the existence of a single authoritative document. As pointed out above, 
most constitutions can be so classified, even though they may differ in the degree 
to which constitutional detail is specified and the extent to which other provisions 
are unwritten. The significance of codification is, nevertheless, considerable. First, 
in a codified constitution, the document itself is authoritative, in the sense that it 
constitutes ‘higher’ law; indeed, the highest law of the land. The constitution binds 
all political institutions, including those that enact ordinary law. The existence of a 
codified constitution thus establishes a hierarchy of laws. In unitary states, a two-tier 
legal system exists, in which the constitution stands above statute law. In federal 
states, there is a third tier, in the form of ‘lower’ state or provincial laws.
Second, the status of the codified document is ensured by the fact that at least certain 
of its provisions are entrenched, in the sense that it is difficult to amend or abolish 
them. The procedure for establishing the constitution, and for subsequently revising 
it, must therefore be in some way more complex and difficult than the procedure for 
enacting ordinary statute laws. Finally, the logic of codification dictates that, as the 
constitution sets out the duties, powers and functions of government institutions in 
terms of ‘higher’ law, it must be justiciable, meaning that all political bodies must be 
subject to the authority of the courts and, in particular, a supreme or constitutional 
court. This substantially enhances the importance of judges, or at least senior judges, 
who become, in effect, the final arbiters of the constitution, and thereby acquire the 
power of judicial review (see p. 342).
Uncodified constitutions, although few in number, have very different 
characteristics. The UK constitution, which is properly thought of as an uncodified 
but partly written constitution, draws on a variety of sources. Chief amongst these 
are statute law, which is made by Parliament, common law, conventions and various 
works of authority that clarify and explain the constitution’s unwritten elements. 
Unlike codified constitution, these laws are not specially entrenched, and thus can be 
changed or repealed by Parliament much as any law can be.
The absence of a codified document implies, most importantly, that the legislature 
enjoys sovereign or unchallengeable authority. It has the right to make or unmake 
any law whatsoever, no body having the right to override or set aside its laws. By 
virtue of its legislative supremacy, the UK Parliament is the ultimate arbiter of the 
constitution: the constitution means what it says it means.
In the UK though, this has stimulated deep controversy and widespread criticism. 
Parliamentary sovereignty (see p. 326) has been held responsible for what Lord 
Hailsham (1976) termed ‘elective dictatorship’; that is, the ability of a government 
to act in any way it pleases as long as it maintains majority control of the House of 
Commons. The concentration of power in the hands of the executive to which this 
leads, and the consequent threat that it poses to individual rights and liberties, has 
Codified constitution: A

from a variety of sources,

Common law: Law based

law that is supposedly 
‘common’ to all.
CONCEPT
Convention
A convention, in 
everyday language, 
is either a formal 
political meeting, or 
an agreement reached 
through debate 
and negotiation. 
A constitutional 
convention, however, 
is a rule of conduct or 
behaviour that is based 
not on law, but on 
custom and precedent. 
These non-legal rules 
are upheld either by a 
sense of constitutional 
propriety (what is 
‘correct’), or by practical 
circumstances (what is 
‘workable’). Conventions 
of this sort exist in all 
constitutional systems, 
usually providing 
guidance where formal 
rules are unclear or 
incomplete, but they are 
particularly significant in 
‘unwritten’ constitutions.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 324 23-07-2024 12:51:52CONSTITUTIONS, LAW AND JUDGES 325
encouraged some to argue that the UK has no constitution at all. If governments 
can, once elected, act in whatever way they wish, they are surely at liberty to enlarge 
their own powers at will, and are thereby unconstrained by constitutional rules of 
any kind. In Griffith’s (2010) phrase, the constitution in the UK is ‘what happens’. 
Such concerns fuelled, in the 1980s and 1990s, a growing campaign in the UK for 
radical constitutional reform. From 1997 onwards, the Blair government reshaped 
important aspects of the UK’s constitutional landscape. Devolution (see p. 437) was 
introduced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; referendums (see p. 248) and 
proportional electoral systems were more widely used; the European Convention on 
Human Rights (1950) was incorporated into UK law through the Human Rights Act 
(1998); freedom of information legislation was passed; the Constitutional Reform 
Act (2005) created a Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which has a stricter 
separation of judicial, legislative and executive powers. Although this programme 
stopped short of codification, some have argued that it brought about a shift from 
parliamentary sovereignty to popular sovereignty (see p. 246) (Hazell 2008).
Rigid and flexible constitutions
An alternative form of classification distinguishes between rigid and flexible 
constitutions. What procedures exist for amending a constitution? How easily 
FOCUS ON . . . 
A CODIFIED CONSTITUTION: STRENGTHS 
AND WEAKNESSES
The strengths of a codified or written constitution include the following:
 Major principles and key constitutional provisions are entrenched, safeguarding them 
from interference by the government of the day.
 The power of the legislature is constrained, cutting its sovereignty (see p. 64) down to size.
 Non-political judges can police the constitution to ensure that its provisions are upheld 
by other public bodies.
 The codified document has an educational value in that it highlights the central values and 
overall goals of the political system.
The drawbacks or weaknesses of codification include the following:
 A codified constitution is more rigid and may therefore be less responsive and adaptable 
than an uncodified one.
 Government power may be more effectively constrained by regular elections than by a 
constitutional document.
 With a codified constitution, constitutional supremacy resides with non-elected judges, 
rather than with publicly accountable politicians.
 Constitutional provisions enshrined in custom and convention may be more widely 
respected because they have been endorsed by history and not ‘invented’.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 325 23-07-2024 12:51:52326 POLITICS
does the constitution adapt to changing circumstances? On the face of it, codified 
constitutions are likely to be relatively inflexible because their provisions are in some 
way entrenched in ‘higher’ law. By the same token, uncodified ones appear to be 
flexible and adaptable, because laws of constitutional significance can be changed 
through the ordinary legislative process and conventions are, by their nature, based 
on conduct and practice. However, there is no simple relationship between written 
constitutions and rigidity, or unwritten ones and flexibility.
Moreover, whether constitutional change comes through wholesale replacement or 
through piecemeal amendment has less to do with the flexibility of constitutions and 
more with the political conditions surrounding the desire for change. Revolutions, war 
and dramatic regime changes are more likely to lead to constitutions being rewritten, 
while slow amendment tends to occur during long periods of stability. For instance, 
whereas the original US constitution has endured, albeit with amendments, since 
1787, France has had, over the same period, no fewer than seventeen constitutions, a 
result of its more turbulent and revolutionary political history.
And amendment procedures may be more or less complex or difficult. In Australia, 
Denmark, Ireland and Spain, for example, referendums are used to obtain the public’s 
approval for constitutional amendments or to ratify those endorsed by the legislature. 
In some countries the threshold of public approval may be very high. In Kazakhstan, 
three-quarters of the population need to vote in favour of any amendments, and 
a majority needs to be in favour in at least two-thirds of the provinces and major 
cities. In other cases, special majorities must be achieved in the legislature, as in 
the requirement in Germany’s Basic Law (1949) that amendments must have two￾thirds support in both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. In the USA, in addition 
to two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, constitutional amendments 
must be ratified by three-quarters of the fifty states. This requirement has meant that 
only twenty-seven constitutional amendments have been passed, with ten of these 
(the so-called ‘Bill of Rights’) having been introduced in the first two years of the 
constitution’s existence. Constitutions may also have entrenched provisions which 
require additional conditions to amend or may even be permanently fixed. Honduras 
and Tunisia, for instance, have clauses in their constitution that limit the number and 
duration of terms a president can serve, and those clauses are specifically defined as 
being unamendable.
The seeming rigidity of constitutional amendment, however, can be misleading. 
Despite high thresholds for public approval, Kazakhstan’s constitution has been 
significantly amended several times by referendum, in part due to the overwhelming 
influence of the government over voters. And even when constitutions remain largely 
unamended over long periods, like the US constitution, their meanings are subject 
to constant revision and updating through the process of judicial interpretation and 
reinterpretation. The role of the judiciary in this respect is examined in the final main 
section of this chapter.
Effective and nominal constitutions
A third system of classification takes account of the relationship between 
constitutional rules and principles, on the one hand, and the practice of government 
Entrenched clause: A 
constitutional provision 
that makes certain 
kinds of constitutional 
amendments more 
difficult or even impossible 
to pass.
CONCEPT
Parliamentary 
sovereignty
Parliamentary 
sovereignty refers to the 
absolute and unlimited 
authority of a parliament 
or legislature, reflected 
in its ability to make, 
amend or repeal any law 
it wishes. Parliamentary 
sovereignty is usually 
seen as the central 
principle of the UK 
constitution, and 
results from (1) the 
absence of a codified 
constitution, (2) the 
supremacy of statute 
law over other forms 
of law, (3) the absence 
of rival legislatures and 
(4) the convention 
that no parliament can 
bind its successors. 
Parliamentary 
sovereignty is a strictly 
legal, and not political, 
form of sovereignty.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 326 23-07-2024 12:51:52CONSTITUTIONS, LAW AND JUDGES 327
(the ‘working’ constitution), on the other. As early as 1867, Walter Bagehot in The 
English Constitution distinguished between the ‘dignified’ parts of the constitution 
(the monarchy and the House of the Lords), which promoted popular allegiance but 
exercised little effective power, and its ‘efficient’ parts (the cabinet and the House of 
Commons). An effective constitution is one that fulfils two criteria. First, in major 
respects at least, the practical affairs of government correspond to the provisions 
of the constitution. Second, this occurs because the constitution has the capacity, 
through whatever means, to limit governmental behaviour.
An effective constitution therefore requires not merely the existence of constitutional 
rules, but also the capacity of those rules to constrain government and establish 
constitutionalism. As we shall see below, however, all constitutions are violated to 
a greater or lesser extent; the real issue is thus the significance and regularity of 
such violations. Some constitutions can be classified as nominal, in that their texts 
or principles may accurately describe governmental behaviour but fail to limit it. 
For instance, the 1982 Chinese constitution acknowledges that China is ‘a socialist 
state under the people’s dictatorship’, but the constitution lacks significance because 
the judiciary, charged with interpreting the constitution, is kept under firm party 
control. Indeed, the constitution largely avoids specifying clear directions or limits 
on many of the major issues of governance, allowing such matters to be determined 
by Chinese Communist Party as it sees fit (Li and Zhou 2019). Other states have sham 
or façade constitutions. These differ substantially from political practice and tend to 
fulfil, at best, only a propaganda role. This is particularly the case in dictatorial or 
authoritarian states, where the commitment to individual rights and liberties extends 
little further than the content of the state’s constitutional documents. In some cases, 
certain special provisions are used to effectively circumvent or suspend a constitution, 
like states of emergency declarations, which sometimes endure for decades.
Rival institutional structures
Constitutions have also been classified in terms of their content and, specifically, by 
the institutional structure they underpin. This enables a number of distinctions to 
be made. For example, constitutions have traditionally been categorized as either 
monarchical or republican. In theory, the former invest constitutional supremacy 
in a dynastic ruler, while, in the latter, political authority is derived from the people. 
However, the emergence of constitutional monarchies (see p. 140), in which power 
has effectively been transferred to representative institutions, has meant that, apart 
from in the surviving absolute monarchies such as Swaziland, Oman and Saudi 
Arabia, this distinction is no longer of central importance. More widely used, though, 
is the distinction between unitary and federal constitutions (discussed in Chapter
17); that is, the difference between constitutions that concentrate sovereignty in a 
single national body and ones that divide it between two levels of government.
Yet another approach is to differentiate between what are seen as parliamentary 
constitutions and presidential constitutions. The key here is the relationship between 
the executive and the legislature. In parliamentary systems, the executive is derived 
from and accountable to the parliament; in presidential systems the two branches 
of government function independently on the basis of the separation of powers 
CONCEPT
Constitutionalism
Constitutionalism, in 
a narrow sense, is the 
practice of limited 
government ensured 
by the existence 
of a constitution. 
Constitutionalism can, 
thus, be said to exist 
when government 
institutions and 
political processes are 
effectively constrained 
by constitutional 
rules. More broadly, 
constitutionalism is a set 
of political values and 
devices that fragment 
power, thereby creating 
a network of checks and 
balances. Examples of 
such devices include 
codified constitutions, 
bills of rights, the 
separation of powers, 
bicameralism and 
federalism.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 327 23-07-2024 12:51:52328 POLITICS
(see p. 377). These different systems are examined in Chapters 14 and 15. Finally, 
pluralist constitutions can be contrasted with monopolistic ones. The former are 
characteristic of liberal democracies, in that they ensure that political power is 
dispersed, usually through guarantees of participatory rights and party competition. 
The latter are more commonly found in communist or authoritarian states where 
the unquestionable authority of a ‘ruling’ party or supreme leader is formally 
entrenched, thus demonstrating that a constitution and liberal constitutionalism do 
not necessarily go hand in hand.
The purpose of a constitution
Not only do the vast majority of states have constitutions, but also most institutions 
and organized groups have rules that have some kind of constitutional effect. This 
applies in the case of international bodies such as the United Nations and the 
European Union, and is also true of regional and provincial government, political 
parties, interest groups, corporations, churches, clubs and so on. The popularity of 
constitutional rules draws attention to the fact that they play a vital role not just in 
the running of states and organizations, but serve several other important purposes, 
including:
 empowering states and organizations
 establishing unifying values and goals
 providing stability
 protecting rights and freedom
 legitimizing regimes.
Empowering states and organizations
Although the popular image of constitutions is that they limit government power, a more 
basic function is that they mark out the existence of states and make claims concerning 
their sphere of independent authority. The creation of new states (whether through 
the overthrow of colonialism, the fragmentation of larger states or the unification of 
smaller ones) is invariably accompanied by the enactment of a constitution. Indeed, 
it can be increasingly argued that such states exist only once they have a constitution, 
since without one they lack formal jurisdiction over a particular territory, or a governing 
apparatus that can effectively administer that jurisdiction. The official declaration of 
recently independent states, like East Timor in 2002 and South Sudan in 2011, has 
coincided exactly with new constitutions for those states coming into effect.
The need for empowerment also applies to subnational and supranational bodies. 
In federal systems, for example, constituent provinces or states have their own 
constitutions in order to guarantee their sphere of authority relative to that of central 
government. Although the idea of a formal EU constitution was abandoned in 2005, 
following its rejection by the Netherlands and France, a collection of treaties – 
including the Treaty of Rome (1957), the Single European Act (1986), the Treaty on 
European Union (1993) and the Treaty of Lisbon (2009) – have constitutional effect, 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 328 23-07-2024 12:51:52CONSTITUTIONS, LAW AND JUDGES 329
in that they authorize EU bodies to intervene in various ways in the affairs of member 
states. This highlights the fact that, although treaties differ from constitutions, the 
former can constitute part of the latter. EU law and treaties, for instance, serve as a 
source of the constitution for each EU member state.
Establishing values and goals
In addition to laying down a framework for government, constitutions invariably 
embody a broader set of political values, ideals and goals. This is why constitutions 
cannot be neutral; they are always entangled, more or less explicitly, with ideological 
priorities. The creators of constitutions therefore seek to invest their regime with a 
set of unifying values, a sense of ideological purpose and a vocabulary that can be 
used in the conduct of politics. In many cases, these aims are accomplished explicitly 
in preambles to constitutional documents, which often function as statements of 
national ideals. These ideals can vary from a commitment to democracy, freedom 
or the welfare state to a belief in socialism, federalism or Islam. The 1982 Turkish 
constitution was dedicated to ‘the concept of nationalism as outlined by Atatürk’, the 
founder of the republic, while Germany’s Basic Law states a determination to ‘serve 
the peace of the world’.
There may also be implicit values and ideological priorities established by constitutions. 
Charles Beard (1913), for example, argued that the provisions of the US constitution 
were shaped essentially by economic interests, in particular the desire to defend 
property against the rising power of the propertyless masses. Some scholars go as 
far as to call these implicit values the ‘invisible’ constitution of a state, the influence 
of which may even eclipse the ‘visible’ constitution in power. Malaysia’s constitution, 
for instance, is outwardly largely secular, guaranteeing freedom of worship and 
specifying a limited role for religion in government. Yet some commentators argue 
that because Islam provides much of the contextual backdrop to the original framing 
of the Constitution and its subsequent legal interpretation, what seem like ambiguous 
or vague constitutional provisions regarding Islam have nonetheless been interpreted 
in ways that have helped maintain its dominance in Malaysian public life (Tew 2018).
Providing government stability
In allocating duties, powers and functions amongst the various institutions of 
government, constitutions act as ‘organizational charts’ or ‘institutional blueprints’. 
As such, they formalize and regulate the relationships between political bodies and 
provide a mechanism through which conflicts can be adjudicated and resolved. 
The Indian constitution, for instance, contains a highly detailed description of 
institutional powers and relationships in a lengthy document containing almost 
400 articles. Despite varying in their degree of specificity and their effectiveness, all 
constitutions fulfil the vital function of introducing a measure of stability, order and 
predictability to the workings of government. From this point of view, the opposite 
of constitutional government is random, capricious or arbitrary government. This is 
precisely why constitutions go hand in hand with organization. Complex patterns 
of social interaction can be maintained only if all concerned know the ‘rules of the 
game’ and, therefore, who can be expected to do what.

9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 329 23-07-2024 12:51:52330 POLITICS
Constitutional provisions regarding powers, functions and procedures tend to be 
more detailed and less open to interpretation than broad values or aspirations are. 
Accordingly, while constitutions aim to provide a stable and reliable blueprint for 
government, they can become outdated as new situations arise or provisions are 
found to be dysfunctional. In many countries, most constitutional amendments 
concern not the promulgation of new values or rights, but corrections to maintain 
smooth government. There have been more than 100 amendments to the Indian 
Constitution, mostly dealing with technical matters, like the accession of new states 
and territories to the union or updating taxation and salary schedules.
Occasionally, however, unforeseen circumstances arise for which constitutions 
provide insufficient, conflicting or unclear directives, which can create power 
struggles called constitutional crises. In 2011, Michael Somare, Prime Minister of 
Papua New Guinea, had become largely incapacitated by illness and his government 
increasingly dysfunctional and unpopular. Complex negotiations between allies and 
opponents of the government resulted not in a motion of no confidence to dismiss 
Somare, the standard procedure under Westminster convention (see pp. 373–375), 
but rather a declaration that the office had fallen vacant due to incapacitation. The 
parliament then elected a new prime minster, Peter O’Neill. The constitutional 
provisions regarding incapacity had never been tested and the Supreme Court of 
Papua New Guinea ultimately determined the right conditions had not been met, 
declaring Somare was still the prime minister. Arguing the principle of parliamentary 
sovereignty (see p. 326), however, and after passing additional laws that legitimated 
the change, the parliament refused to restore Somare, and government continued 
under O’Neill. For almost a year the standoff between the parliament and the courts

remained unresolved, with both Somare and O’Neill claiming to be the legitimate 
prime minister amidst conflicting constitutional guidance, both written and 
unwritten. Only elections in 2012, which gave a clear victory to O’Neill’s party and 
government, ended the crisis.
Protecting freedom
In liberal democracies, it is often taken for granted that the central purpose of a 
constitution is to constrain government with a view to protecting individual 
liberty. This is why constitutions tend to be viewed as devices for establishing and 
maintaining limited government. Certainly, constitutions often lay down the 
relationship between the state and the individual, marking out the respective spheres 
of government authority and personal freedom. They do this largely by defining civil 
rights and liberties, sometimes through the means of a bill of rights.
The impact of liberal constitutionalism has ensured that, in many cases, ‘classic’ or 
traditional civil liberties (see p. 456), such as freedom of expression, freedom of 
religious worship, freedom of assembly and freedom of movement, are recognized as 
‘fundamental’ in that they are constitutionally guaranteed. These so-called ‘negative 
rights’ have a liberal character in that, because the state is thus prevented from 
encroaching on the individual, they mark out a sphere of government inactivity. A 
growing number of states have, in addition, entrenched a range of economic, social 
and cultural rights, such as the right to health care, the right to education and, even, 
the right to work. These positive rights, however, have caused controversy, because 
they are linked to the expansion, not contraction, of government, and because their 
provision is dependent on the economic and social resources available to the state in 
question. Can these rights and freedoms be thought of as ‘fundamental’ when there 
is no practical way of guaranteeing their delivery? In the Indian constitution, this is 
acknowledged through the qualification that the right to work, for example, is secured 
‘within the limits of economic capacity and development’. Like procedural constitutional 
provisions, rights and freedoms, and interpretation of their extent, evolve over time, 
and these aspects of the constitutional order tend to be the most controversial in the 
public arena and thus frequently challenged in courts or by legislatures.
Legitimizing regimes
The final function of a constitution is to help build legitimacy (see p. 86). This explains 
the widespread use of constitutions, even by states with constitutions that are merely 
nominal or a complete façade. This legitimation process has two dimensions. In 
the first place, the existence of a constitution is almost a prerequisite for a state’s 
membership of the international community and for its recognition by other states. 
And non-state organizations like the United Nations, International Criminal Court 
and the World Trade Organization rely entirely on treaties and charters to empower 
them to operate through the mutual consensus of member states and to provide 
legitimacy to those operations.
More significant, however, is the ability to use a constitution to build legitimacy 
within a state through the promotion of respect and compliance amongst the 
domestic population. This is possible because a constitution both symbolizes and 
Limited government:
Government operating 
within constraints, 
usually imposed by 
law, a constitution or 
institutional checks and 
balances.
Negative rights: Rights 
that mark out a realm 
of unconstrained 
action, and thus check 
the responsibilities of 
government.
Positive rights: Rights 
that make demands of

the provision of resources 
and support, and thus 
extend its responsibilities.
CONCEPT
Bill of rights
A bill of rights is a 
constitutional document 
that specifies the rights 
and freedoms of the 
individual, and so defines 
the legal extent of civil 
liberty (see p. 456).
Entrenched bills of rights 
can be distinguished 
from statutory ones. 
An entrenched bill of 
rights is enshrined in 
‘higher’ law and, thus, 
provides the basis for 
constitutional judicial 
review (see p. 342). A 
statutory bill of rights, 
or statute of rights, 
can be amended or 
repealed through the 
same processes as 
other statute laws. 
Unlike an entrenched 
bill of rights, it does not 
breach parliamentary 
sovereignty (see p. 326).
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 331 23-07-2024 12:51:53332 POLITICS
disseminates the values of the ruling elite, and invests the governmental system 
with a cloak of legality. To make the constitution more effective in this respect, 
attempts are often made to promote veneration for the constitution itself, either as a 
document of historical importance or as a symbol of national purpose and identity.
Do constitutions matter?
The value of a constitution is often taken for granted. The existence of a constitution, so 
the assumption goes, provides benefits such as political stability, limited government 
and guaranteed rights and liberties. Nowhere is this faith in a constitution more 
developed than in the USA, where it amounts, in Louis Hartz’s (1955) words, to ‘the 
cult of constitution worship’. Of course, this faith has been severely tested, not least 
by allegations during the Watergate crisis that President Richard Nixon had helped 
to cover up illegal acts by senior White House officials during the 1972 election 
campaign. Nevertheless, Nixon’s resignation in 1974 enabled his successor, Gerald 
Ford, to declare that ‘our constitution works’, reiterating the classic sentiment of 
constitutionalism: ‘we have a government of laws, not of men’. However, the mere 
existence of a constitution does not ensure that a government is constitutional. 
Indeed, there is little evidence that a constitution is a major guarantee against tyranny, 
still less that it offers a ‘ticket to Utopia’.
Constitutions ‘work’ in certain circumstances. In other words, they serve their 
various purposes only when they are supported by a range of other cultural, political, 
economic and social conditions. In particular, constitutions must correspond to and 
be supported by the political culture; successful constitutions are as much a product 
of the political culture as they are its framers. This is why so many of the model liberal￾democratic constitutions bequeathed to developing states by departing colonial 
rulers failed to take root. Constitutional rules guaranteeing individual rights and 
political competition may be entirely irrelevant in societies with deeply entrenched 
collectivist values and traditions, especially when such societies are struggling to 
achieve basic economic and social development.
In the same way, the various Soviet constitutions not only enshrined ‘socialist’ values 
that were foreign to the mass of the people, but also failed to develop popular support 
for such values during the seventy-four years of the USSR’s existence. The 1936 
Constitution of the Soviet Union, passed under the rule of Joseph Stalin, enumerated 
a broad range of rights, from universal suffrage and direct election of government 
officials to freedom of speech, worship and assembly. In practice of course, the Soviet 
Union was a totalitarian and collectivist society, and its constitution ultimately 
powerless when in the hands of Soviet judges and bureaucrats. Yet even in broadly 
liberal and open societies, constitutional guarantees often struggle in the face of 
social prejudice and traditionalism. The Indian constitution explicitly outlawed 
‘untouchability’ in 1950, a social convention of widespread discrimination and 
exclusion practised against the Dalits, traditionally the lowest social class in the caste 
hierarchy of India; however, constitutional protections and government programmes 
have failed to unwind centuries of prejudice and tradition.
A second key factor is whether or not a constitution is respected by rulers and 
accords with the interests and values of dominant groups. Codified or uncodified, 
CONCEPT
Freedom
The term ‘freedom’ 
(or liberty) means, in 
its broadest sense, the 
ability to think or act as 
one wishes. A distinction 
is nevertheless often 
made between ‘negative’ 
and ‘positive’ liberty 
(Berlin 1969). Negative 
freedom means non￾interference: the 
absence of external 
constraints on the 
individual. Freedom, 
in this sense, is a 
private sphere within 
which individuals are 
‘at liberty’ to act as 
they wish. Positive
freedom is linked to 
the achievement of 
some identifiable goal 
or benefit, usually in 
the sense of personal 
development, self￾realization or self￾mastery.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 332 23-07-2024 12:51:53CONSTITUTIONS, LAW AND JUDGES 333
constitutions are not self-enforcing – they are merely words, and ultimately require 
other institutions with real power – like the government, military or police – 
to enforce them. In most states, this is rarely tested because governments and 
institutions operate with self-restraint and willingly uphold constitutional principles. 
But constitutional orders can be compromised with surprising rapidity when the 
public or powerful institutions are unwilling to defend them. Germany’s Weimar 
constitution (1919), for example, despite the fact that it enshrined an impressive 
array of rights and liberties, was easily set aside in the 1930s as Hitler constructed 
his Nazi dictatorship. Not only did the competitive democracy of the Weimar regime 
conflict with the ambitions of the Nazis and conservative elites in business and the 
military, but it was also poorly supported by a population facing economic crisis 
and little accustomed to representative government. In India, under Indira Gandhi 
during 1975–7, and in Pakistan, under General Zia ul-Haq during 1977–81, major 
provisions of the constitutions were abrogated by the declaration of ‘states of 
emergency’. In these cases, the support of the military leadership proved to be far 
more crucial than respect for constitutional niceties.
The final factor is the adaptability of a constitution and its ability to remain relevant 
despite changing political circumstances. No constitution reflects political realities, 
and few set out specifically to do so. Generally, successful constitutions are sufficiently 
flexible to accommodate change within a broad and enduringly relevant framework. 
The US constitution is particularly interesting in this respect. Its ‘genius’ has been its 
concentration on broad principles and the scope it therefore provides to rectify its 
own deficiencies. US government has thus been able to evolve in response to new 
challenges and new demands. The formal amendment process, for example, allowed 
US institutions to be democratized and, in the twentieth century, judicial interpretation 
made possible the growth of presidential powers, a shift of authority from state to 
federal government, and, in certain respects, a widening of individual rights.
However, constitutions can also be over-flexible, in the sense that, rather than shackling 
rulers, they can too easily be reshaped to serve rulers’ interests. This can be seen in the 
extent to which the rise to power of populists and so-called ‘strongmen’ in the early 
twenty-first century has been accompanied by a process of constitutional remodelling. 
Although populism (see p. 56) is commonly portrayed as anti-constitutional, or, 
more widely, as anti-institutional, by virtue of its preference for a direct, unmediated 
relationship between the leader and the people, populist leaders have often been 
happy to rule within a constitutional framework, so long as it can be bent to their will. 
For example, Vladimir Putin exploited a loophole in the 1993 Russian constitution 
enabling him to serve as president for more than the maximum two full terms, by, 
in 2008, assuming the post of prime minister once his first two terms as president 
were complete. This allowed him, subsequently, to return to the presidency for a third 
and later fourth term. In addition, the term of the Russian president was extended 
from four to six years. In a similar vein, in 2017, President Erdogan of Turkey fought 
and won a constitutional referendum that effectively transformed the country from a 
parliamentary democracy to a presidential republic, and, in the process, provided for 
the abolition of the post of prime minister (see pp. 355–356). In 2018, China’s president, 
Xi Jinping, secured the near-unanimous backing of the National People’s Congress for 
the abolition of term limits, creating the possibility that he could rule for life.

THE LAW
Law, morality and politics
The relationship between law and morality is one of the thorniest problems in 
political theory. On the surface, law and morality are very different things. Law is a 
distinctive form of social control, backed up by the means of enforcement; it defines 
what may and what may not be done. Morality, on the other hand, is concerned with 
ethical questions and the difference between ‘right’ and ‘wrong’; it prescribes what 
should and what should not be done. Moreover, while law has an objective character, 
in that it is a social fact, morality is usually treated as a subjective entity; that is, 
as a matter of opinion or personal judgement. Nevertheless, natural law theories 
that date back to Plato (see p. 13) and Aristotle (see p. 4) suggest that law is, or 
should be, rooted in a moral system of some kind. In the early modern period, such 
theories were often based on the idea of God-given ‘natural rights’. This assertion of 
a link between law and morality became fashionable again as the twentieth century 
progressed, and it was usually associated with the ideas of civil liberties or human 
rights.
However, the rise in the nineteenth century of the ‘science of positive law’ offered 
a very different view of the relationship between law and morality. Its purpose was 
quite simply to free the understanding of law from moral, religious and mystical 
assumptions. John Austin (1790–1859) developed the theory of ‘legal positivism’, 
which defined law not in terms of its conformity to higher moral or religious 
principles, but in terms of the fact that it was established and enforced: the law is the 
law because it is obeyed. This approach was refined by H. L. A. Hart in The Concept 
of Law (1961). Hart suggested that law stemmed from the union of ‘primary’ and 
‘secondary’ rules, each of which had a particular function. Primary rules regulate 
social behaviour and can be thought of as the ‘content’ of the legal system: criminal 
law is an example. Secondary rules, on the other hand, are rules that confer powers on 
the institutions of government. They lay down how primary rules are made, enforced 
and adjudicated, thus determining their validity.
Hart’s distinction is reflected to some degree in the two forms of law found in most 
democratic systems. Primary legislation is the statutes passed by a state’s legislative 
bodies and are what most people typically think of when using the word ‘law’. Yet 
statutes are generally confined to broad principles on any given topic, and further 
refinement and specificity over how to implement those principles is generally left 
to secondary legislation, which is created by the executive branch in the form of 
executive orders, regulations and policy. The latter process is also called rule-making,
and while it often attracts far less attention than the passage of laws by a legislature, 
it can be just as powerful. The Clean Air Act, first passed by the US Congress in 
1963 and amended several times since, gives the US Environmental Protectional 
Agency (EPA) significant powers to act to control and reduce air pollution. But its 
provisions are often broad, and it is left to the EPA to make critical decisions about 
which specific pollutants to regulate, to what degree and how. Accordingly, the actual 
impact of the Clean Air Act has varied significantly, with EPA administrators varying 
wildly in their approach to rule-making.

CONCEPT
Human rights
Human rights are rights 
to which people are 
entitled by virtue of 
being human; they are 
a modern and secular 
version of ‘natural 
rights’. Human rights 
are universal (in the 
sense that they belong 
to human beings 
everywhere, regardless 
of race, religion, gender 
and other differences), 
fundamental (in that 
a human being’s 
entitlement to them 
cannot be removed), 
indivisible (in that civic 
and political rights, 
and economic, social 
and cultural rights are 
interrelated and co￾equal in importance) and 
absolute (in that, as the 
basic grounds for living 
a genuinely human life, 
they cannot be qualified).
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 334 23-07-2024 12:51:53CONSTITUTIONS, LAW AND JUDGES 335
In view of the crucial role that law plays in regulating social behaviour, no one can 
doubt that law has immense political significance. Nevertheless, questions about 
the actual and desirable relationship between law and politics – reflecting on the 
nature of law, and its function and proper extent – have routinely arisen. Much 
of our understanding of law derives from liberal theory. This portrays law as the 
essential guarantee of civilized and orderly existence, drawing heavily on social￾contract theory (see p. 66). In the absence of the state and a system of law – that is, 
in the ‘state of nature’ – each individual is at liberty to abuse or threaten every other 
individual. The role of law, then, is to protect each member of society from his or her 
fellow members, thereby preventing their rights and liberties from being encroached 
on. However, the notion that the central purpose of law is to protect freedom has 
provoked deep controversy (see p. 336).
As this protection extends throughout society and to every one of its members, law 
has, liberals insist, a neutral character. Law is therefore ‘above’ politics, and a strict 
separation between law and politics must be maintained to prevent the law favouring 
the state over the individual, the rich over the poor, men over women, the ethnic 
majority over ethnic minorities and so on. This is why liberals place such a heavy 
emphasis on the universal authority of law, embodied in the principle of the rule of 
law. This view of law also has significant implications for the judiciary, whose task it is 
to interpret law and adjudicate between parties to a dispute. Notably, judges must be 
independent, in the sense that they are ‘above’ or ‘outside’ the machinery of government 
and not subject to political influence. It is a mistake, though, to think of the rule of law 
as being only, or even mostly, upheld by the threat of coercion and punishment. Or 
that an orderly society requires a system of law. Even in anarchic societies where the 
rule of law has broken down, most people will not engage wantonly in murder, theft 
or violence (though some certainly will). Whether this is out of a sense of reciprocity 
towards others or an innately moral sense in humans (Wilson 1993), many people 
willingly adhere to the principal of ‘live and let live’ and thus do not seek to interfere 
with the freedom of others, as long as their own freedom is not threatened.
The question of international law
Law has usually been thought of as a distinctively domestic entity. This is because law 
reflects the will of a sovereign power, meaning that it is both compulsory and takes 
precedence over all other norms and social rules within a particular political society. For 
law to be law it must be backed up by a system of coercion and punishment that ensures 
enforcement, something that does not exist in the international sphere. International 
law is thus ‘soft’ law rather than ‘hard’ law. However, the remarkable thing about 
international law is just how high levels of compliance tend to be, even though violations 
of international law are often grotesque and highly publicized (examples range from the 
1994 Rwandan genocide, which witnessed mass slaughter of Tutsi by members of the 
Hutu majority government, to the invasion of Iraq by the USA and its allies in 2003). 
Why, then, is international law usually obeyed? The main reason is that states typically 
calculate that, in the long run, complying with international law will bring them benefit 
or reduce the harm that is done to them. The key to this is reciprocity. For example, 
diplomatic immunity is upheld because states recognize that it is the only way of 
ensuring their own diplomats in foreign lands can live and work in safety and security.
CONCEPT
Rule of law
The rule of law is the 
principle that the law 
should ‘rule’, in the sense 
that it establishes a 
framework to which all 
conduct and behaviour 
must conform. This 
requirement applies 
equally to all the 
members of society, be 
they private citizens or 
government officials. 
As such, rule of law is a 
core liberal-democratic 
principle. In continental 
Europe, it has often 
been enshrined in the 
German concept of 
the Rechtsstaat, a 
state based on law. In 
the USA, the rule of 
law is closely linked 
to the status of the 
constitution as ‘higher’ 
law and the doctrine 
of ‘due process’. In 
the UK, it is grounded 
in common law and 
implies that a codified 
constitution is not 
needed.
 ‘Soft’ law: Law that is 
not binding and cannot 
be enforced; quasi-legal 
instruments that impose 
only moral obligations.
‘Hard’ law: Law that 
is enforceable and so 
establishes legally binding 
obligations.
Reciprocity: A 
relationship of mutual 
exchange that ensures 
favours in return for 
favours or punishments in 
return for punishments.

DEBATING . . .
IS THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF LAW TO PROTECT FREEDOM?
At the heart of questions about the relationship between law and morality is the issue of freedom and the proper balance 
between those moral choices that should be made by society and enforced through law, and those that should be reserved 
for the individual. While liberals have typically argued that laws are only justifiable if they enlarge, rather than contract, the 
sphere of freedom, conservatives and others have claimed that law serves interests beyond those of the individual. 
YES NO
Personal and social development. The classic liberal 
belief is that law and freedom are intrinsically related. 
Freedom is only possible ‘under the law’ (because each 
citizen is a threat to every other citizen) but, at the same 
time, the sphere of law should not extend beyond the 
protection of freedom (otherwise law is non-legitimate). 
In On Liberty (1859), J. S. Mill (see p. 245) thus asserted 
that, ‘Over himself, over his own body and mind the 
individual is sovereign’. Mill was prepared to accept the 
legitimacy of law only when it was designed to prevent 
‘harm to others’. This so-called ‘harm principle’ can 
be justified in two ways. First, it reflects the fact that 
human beings will only grow or develop if they enjoy the 
widest possible scope for unconstrained action, allowing 
them to make their own moral decisions. Second, a 
wider sphere for freedom promotes healthy debate 
and discussion, so advancing the cause of reason and 
promoting social progress.
Fundamental freedoms. An alternative defence for 
liberty-based law derives from attempts to establish 
freedom as a fundamental value. In Immanuel Kant’s 
(see p. 461) view, freedom consists in being bound by 
laws that are, in some sense, of one’s own making, as 
individuals should be treated as ‘ends in themselves’. 
However, in modern political debate the notion of 
human beings as autonomous agents is most commonly 
grounded in the doctrine of human rights. Human 
rights are rights to which people are entitled by virtue 
of being human. They are therefore ‘fundamental’ 
rights, in that they are inalienable: they cannot be 
traded away or revoked. The doctrine of human rights 
implies that civil liberties – especially classic civil liberties 
such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press and 
freedom of movement and assembly – are fundamental 
entitlements, which are upheld for all people and in all 
circumstances. To treat such rights and freedoms, not 
as moral absolutes, but as matters of convenience, is to 
leave the door open to tyranny and oppression.
Order over freedom. The flaw in the liberal theory of law 
is a failure to recognize that law exists, primarily, not to 
defend freedom, but to uphold order; and that, by widening 
freedom, order can be put at risk. In this view, liberals 
can only argue that the protection of freedom should be 
set above other considerations because they embrace 
an optimistic model of human nature in which people are 
portrayed as rational and moral creatures. Citizens can thus 
be endowed with freedom because they can be trusted, in 
normal circumstances, not to use and abuse their fellow 
citizens. Conservatives, in contrast, adopt a pessimistic, 
even Hobbesian, view of human nature, but one which they 
argue is more realistic. As individuals are greedy, selfish and 
power-seeking creatures, orderly existence can only be 
maintained through strict laws, firm enforcement and, where 
necessary, harsh penalties. ‘Soft’ laws or the treatment of 
civil liberties as fundamental freedoms threaten to bring 
about a descent into crime and delinquency.
Enforcing morality. Instead of promoting personal and 
social development, unrestrained freedom may damage 
the fabric of society. At issue here is the moral and cultural 
diversity which Mill’s view permits, or even encourages. A 
classic statement of this position was advanced by Patrick 
Devlin in The Enforcement of Morals (1968), which argues 
that there is a ‘public morality’ which society has the right 
to enforce through the instrument of law. Underlying this 
position is the belief that society is held together by a 
‘shared’ morality, a fundamental agreement about what is 
‘good’ and what is ‘evil’. In particular, Devlin argued that Mill’s 
notion of harm should be extended to include ‘offence’, at 
least when actions provoke what Devlin called ‘real feelings 
of revulsion’, rather than simple dislike. The central theme 
of such arguments is that morality is simply too important 
to be left to the individual. Where the interests of society 
and those of the individual conflict, law must always take the 
side of the former.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_13.indd 336 23-07-2024 12:51:53CONSTITUTIONS, LAW AND JUDGES 337
The most far-reaching attempt to date to apply the rule of law to international 
disputes has been through the construction, in 1945, of the International Court 
of Justice (commonly referred to as the World Court, or the ICJ). The ICJ is the 
principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Its role is to settle, in accordance 
with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by states, and to give advisory 
opinions on legal questions referred to it by UN organs and specialized agencies. 
The Court’s successes include the settlement of the border dispute between El 
Salvador and Honduras, which had led to the ‘soccer war’ of 1969. However, the 
fact that the jurisdiction of the Court is strictly limited to states prevents it from 
taking action over a wide range of human rights and humanitarian issues affecting 
individuals or sub-state groups. This has led to the establishment of a number of 
international criminal tribunals, including those set up to examine alleged war 
crimes in Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, and in 2002 to the construction of the 
International Criminal Court (ICC). As these tribunals and courts have tended to 
enmesh states within a framework of rules and norms that have a higher and binding 
authority, in the manner of a constitution, they have transformed international law 
into ‘supranational’ or ‘world’ law.
THE JUDICIARY
The judiciary is the branch of government that is empowered to decide legal disputes. 
The central function of judges is therefore to adjudicate on the meaning of law, in the 
sense that they interpret or ‘construct’ law. The significance of this role varies from 
state to state and from system to system. However, it is particularly important in states 
with codified constitutions, where it extends to the interpretation of the constitution 
itself, and so allows judges to arbitrate in disputes between major institutions of 
government, or between the state and the individual.
One of the chief characteristics of the judiciary – in liberal-democratic systems, its 
defining characteristic – is that judges are strictly independent and non-political 
actors. Indeed, the ability of judges to be ‘above’ politics is normally seen as the 
vital guarantee of a separation between law and politics. However, this image of the 
judiciary is misleading, and judiciary is best thought of as a political, not merely 
a legal, institution. As central figures in the legal process, judges play a vital role 
in such undeniably political activities as conflict resolution and the maintenance of 
state authority. Much more concerning to most, though, is whether judges act in way 
that is overtly partisan or political beyond that core role. First, are judges political 
in that their actions are shaped by political considerations or pressures? Second, do 
judges make policy in the sense that they encroach on the proper responsibilities of 
politicians?
Are judges political?
Certain political systems make no pretence of judicial neutrality or impartiality. In 
orthodox communist regimes, the principle of ‘socialist legality’ dictated that judges 
interpret law in accordance with Marxism–Leninism, subject to the ideological 
authority of the state’s communist party. Judges thus became mere functionaries who

carried out the political and ideological objectives of the regime itself. China’s judicial 
system, for instance, is explicitly under the supervision of the Chinese Communist 
Party. In other states, however, judges are expected to observe strict political neutrality. 
In states that subscribe to any form of liberal constitutionalism, the authority of law is 
linked to its non-political character, which, in turn, is based on the assumption that 
the law is interpreted by independent and impartial judges.
External bias
Judges may be political in two senses: they may be subject to external bias or to 
internal bias. External bias is derived from the influence that political bodies, such 
as parties, the assembly and government, are able to exert on the judiciary. Internal 
bias stems from the prejudices and sympathies of judges themselves, particularly 
from those that intrude into the process of judicial decision-making. External bias 
is supposedly kept at bay by respect for the principle of judicial independence. In 
most liberal democracies, the independence of the judiciary is protected by their 
security of tenure (the fact that they cannot be sacked), and through restrictions on 
the criticism of judges and court decisions. However, in practice, the independence 
of judges may be compromised because of the close involvement of political bodies 
in the process of judicial recruitment and promotion.
Federal judges in the USA supposedly hold office for life on condition of ‘good 
behaviour’. Federal judges, including Supreme Court judges, however, are appointed 
by the US president, and these appointments are subject to confirmation by the 
Senate. Because federal judges, particularly supreme court judges, play a crucial 
role in determining the constitutionality of government policy and the application 
of constitutionally guaranteed rights, during particularly contentious periods of 
American history, high-stakes battles have emerged in which both parties have 
attempted to sway the federal judiciary with appointees they believe will be friendly 
to their desired interpretations on constitutional matters (see p. 339). Politics 
may also intrude into the US judiciary due to the practice found in some states of 
choosing some, most or all of their judges through contestable popular elections, 
some of which are openly partisan. Supporters of this practice argue that democracy 
requires that the electoral principle should apply as much to those who interpret law 
as to those who make law. Otherwise, judges are accountable to no one, being able 
to act according to their own views and preferences, rather than those of the public 
(Davis 2005). On the other hand, critics of elected judges point out not only that 
elections inevitably draw judges into partisan politics, and so make judicial neutrality 
impossible, but also that selecting judges on the basis of popularity may compromise 
their expertise and specialist knowledge.
Judicial independence:
The constitutional 
principle that there 
should be a strict 
separation between 
the judiciary and other 
branches of government; 
an application of the 
separation of powers.
CONCEPT
Neutrality
Neutrality is the 
absence of any form 
of partisanship or 
commitment; it consists 
of a refusal to ‘take 
sides’. In international 
relations, neutrality is a 
legal condition through 
which a state declares 
its non-involvement in 
a conflict or war. As a 
professional principle, 
applied to the likes of 
judges, civil servants, 
the military and other 
public officials, it implies, 
strictly speaking, the 
absence of political 
sympathies and 
ideological leanings. 
In practice, the less 
exacting requirement 
of impartiality is usually 
applied. This allows that 
political sympathies 
may be held as long as 
these do not intrude 
into, or conflict with, 
professional or public 
responsibilities.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
THE BATTLE FOR THE US SUPREME COURT
Ratified on 21 June 1788, the United States Constitution is 
the oldest constitutional document still in force today. As 
new challenges and situations have arisen, it has fallen to the 
Supreme Court to interpret and defended the constitution 
amidst an ever-changing world. While the framers of the 
US Constitution promoted the concept of a Supreme 
Court free of political influence, the court routinely 
finds itself arbitrating over some of the most contentious 
political issues of the day, with far-reaching ramifications 
for public policy. This has created an increasingly high￾stakes game between Democrats and Republicans to 
control appointments to the court, thereby influencing its 
ideological make-up, which has become a defining feature 
of contemporary American politics (O’Brien 2020).
The current era of politicization arguably began with the 
Warren Court (1953–69). Taking a more activist approach 
to judicial review, the Warren Court made a series of 
landmark decisions expanding civil rights, including ending 
racial segregation in schools, ending prayer in public schools 
and expanding the rights of criminals and defendants. Then, 
in 1973, the court found in Roe v. Wade a constitutional 
right to abortion, a deeply controversial decision 
which heavily divided American society. In response, 
conservative activists began to focus more intensively on 
shaping the composition of the Supreme Court. The 1987 
nomination of Robert Bork, a conservative judge who 
vowed to overturn decisions like Roe v. Wade, triggered 
an unprecedented public campaign of opposition and 
highly politicized senate vote in which Bork’s nomination 
was defeated. In the decades that have followed, Supreme 
Court nominations have become increasingly partisan, with 
even well-qualified candidates receiving few votes from 
political opponents, and presidents nominating younger, 
more ideologically driven justices who, as life appointees, 
can more enduringly influence the court.
In recent decades, the battle for the court has spilled over 
to become a major election issue. In 2016 Antonin Scalia, 
a key conservative on the Supreme Court, died. Prior to his 
death, the court was considered evenly balanced, with four 
conservative justices, four liberal justices and one centrist 
or ‘swing’ justice. However, the Republican-dominated 
Senate refused to hold hearings or vote on Democratic 
President Barack Obama’s nominee for Scalia’s 
replacement. Though against long-standing precedent, 
the Republicans recognized that allowing Scalia to be 
replaced with a liberal nominee would significantly alter the 
ideological balance of the court. In the election of 2016, 
the Republicans campaigned explicitly on the need to elect 
Donald Trump to allow them to pick Scalia’s replacement, 
a point considered persuasive to many conservative 
Christians who might otherwise have opposed Trump. 
After taking office in 2017, Trump appointed conservative 
Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy instead, maintaining the 
balance.
More significantly, however, in 2018 he nominated Brett 
Kavanaugh, a conservative, to replace the retiring Anthony 
Kennedy, who had often acted as the court’s swing vote. 
Kavanaugh’s successful confirmation by the Senate, in 
polarized circumstances and amidst accusations of sexual 
misconduct, seemingly created a conservative majority 
on the court. Then in 2020, two months before the 
next presidential election, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of 
the court’s leading liberal justices, died. Foreseeing the 
likelihood of Trump’s defeat by Democrat Joe Biden, the 
Republican-dominated Senate broke their previously 
established precedent and rushed through the appointment 
of a conservative replacement, Amy Coney Barrett, 
before the election could be held. Through questionable 
tactics and amidst howls of protest from Democrats, the 
Republicans had secured a six-three conservative majority 
in just one presidential term.
The conservatives were quick to reap the rewards, however.

Although judicial elections are rare outside the United States, external political 
pressure on the judiciary is inevitably found in just about every political system. 
Court ‘packing’ is a common tactic, where the executive or legislature explicitly 
shapes the judiciary through political appointments. In 1990, Argentinian President 
Carlos Menem increased the number of seats on the Argentinian Supreme Court 
from five to nine, creating four new vacancies which he filled with political allies 
and an ‘automatic majority’ on the court that would rule in favour of his expansive 
and sometimes controversial policies. In 2017, the Polish government lowered the 
mandatory retirement age for judges from sixty-seven to sixty, creating nearly 100 
new vacancies that the government could fill with friendly judges. Such actions 
may be branded as necessary by governments and their supporters to overcome 
entrenched opposition to change by an unelected judiciary, but opponents are liable 
to see them as dangerous power grabs that disrupt the checks and balances of the 
political system.
Internal bias
Judicial independence is not the only issue; bias may creep in through the values and 
culture of the judiciary as easily as through external pressure. From this perspective, 
the key factor is not so much how judges are recruited, but who is recruited. A long￾standing socialist critique of the judiciary holds that it articulates the dominant values 
of society, and so acts to defend the existing political and social order. This tendency 
is underpinned by the social exclusivity of judges and by the peculiar status and 
respect that the judicial profession is normally accorded. Griffith (2010) argued that 
this conservative bias is particularly prominent in the UK’s higher judiciary, and that 
it stems from the remarkable homogeneity of senior judges, who are overwhelmingly 
male, white, upper-middle-class and public school and ‘Oxbridge’ educated. Similar 
arguments have been used to suggest that judges are biased against women, racial 
minorities and, indeed, any group that is poorly represented within its ranks. On the 
other hand, Canada’s Supreme Court has been notable to counter these tendencies in 
its appointments. By law, appointees must represent a balance of Canada’s provinces, 
ensuring geographic diversity, and governments of recent decades have attempted to 
maintain gender parity on the court and appoint justices from visible minorities as 
well. Nevertheless, even critics of the judiciary recognize that there is a limit to the 
extent to which judges can be made socially representative. To achieve a judiciary 
that is a microcosm of the larger society, it would be necessary for criteria such as 
experience and professional competence to be entirely ignored in the appointment 
of judges.
guarantees of abortion rights. The next year, the court also 
found affirmative action policies to be unconstitutional, 
another issue long targeted by conservative activists. These 
decisions on major areas of social concern and impact 
occurred largely in the absence of democratic input, and 
in the case of abortion, with a clear majority of polled 
Americans opposed to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. 
Some commentators have decried the Supreme Court 
thus as not just an increasingly politicized body, but also 
an anti-democratic one, allowing whoever most influences 
the court’s composition to achieve policy outcomes they 
would never have sufficient support to enact through 
regular legislative or executive means.

Do judges make policy?
The image of judges as simple appliers of law has always been a myth. Judges cannot 
apply the so-called ‘letter of the law’, because no law, legal term or principle has a single, 
self-evident meaning. In practice, judges impose meaning on law through a process of 
‘construction’ that forces them to choose amongst a number of possible meanings or 
interpretations. In this sense, all law is judge-made law. Clearly, however, the range of 
discretion available to judges in this respect, and the significance of the laws that they 
invest with meaning, vary considerably. Two factors are crucial here. The first is the clarity 
and detail with which law is specified. Generally, broadly framed laws or constitutional 
principles allow greater scope for judicial interpretation. The second factor is the existence 
of a codified or ‘written’ constitution. The existence of such a document significantly 
enhances the status of the judiciary, investing it with the power of judicial review.
There are numerous theories of legal interpretation, derived from the experience 
of US constitutional interpretation, that prescribe a varying degree of freedom to 
judges in interpreting the law, and therefore a variably political role in the political 
system. On one end of the spectrum, the doctrine of originalism holds that when 
interpreting constitutions or laws, judges should seek to uphold the original intention 
of the authors at the time at which they were written, and only apply meanings that 
would have been ordinarily understood by people at the time they were passed. 
This doctrine prescribes a fairly narrow role for judges, in that they should as far 
as possible avoid ‘creating’ law by finding new meanings. At the other end of the 
spectrum, the doctrine of judicial pragmatism holds that laws and constitutions 
should be kept ‘alive’ by allowing them to evolve with changing times and to deal with 
issues that the original authors could not have imagined. This doctrine gives far more 
leeway to judges to make decisions than can, sometimes radically, alter previously 
accepted meanings of the law.
Both doctrines have their merits and demerits. While originalism seemingly provides 
clear guidelines, the original intent behind laws and constitutions may not always 
be clear centuries later. Moreover, originalism cannot provide guidance on issues 
that were not imagined in previous eras. For instance, when the Fifth Amendment 
to US Constitution was passed in 1791, it prohibited private property from public 
use without compensation. In 1791, property was commonly understood to extend 
infinitely into the air above someone’s land. In 1956, when a farmer in North 
Carolina sued the US government for flying military aircraft over his farm without 
compensating him, the US Supreme Court acknowledged that the understanding of 
property rights behind the Fifth Amendment was impossible to sustain in the era of 
aircraft, a technology unforeseen when then amendment was written. So it redefined 
the meaning of property rights to allow planes to fly cross-country without having 
to compensate every property beneath it. Moreover, whilst originalism is argued by 
is adherents to safeguard against a politicized judiciary, traditional interpretations of 
the laws tend to favour the established order, and thus conservative politics. Because 
constitutions are generally difficult to amend, originalism can dramatically impede 
progress on issues, even amidst significant societal support for change.
On the other hand, judicial pragmatism can easily lead to claims of judicial 
activism, with unelected judges potentially making decisions of enormous

consequence over the wishes of legislatures, executives and even the public. Since 
the 1990s, Mexico’s Supreme Court has dramatically increased its willingness to 
make constitutional rulings on controversial social and political issues, lauded by 
its supporters as necessary to break political deadlocks and provide guidance in 
the absence of the executive and legislature doing so (Calabresi 2021). However, 
determinations like establishing the constitutional right to abortion and same￾sex marriage have been deeply divisive in the light of a traditionally conservative 
Catholic society, undoubtedly beyond the intent of the framers when the 
constitution was written in 1917, opening the court up to significant criticism 
and increasing politicization as governments have attempted to curb its power or 
change its composition. Moreover, if judges are policymakers, they must operate as 
part of the broader machinery of government and within constraints established 
by the political culture and public opinion – judicial independence and protection 
from outside influence is predicated in part on judicial impartiality. If judges are 
acting as partisan activists, that judicial independence arguably creates a special 
class of political actors who are not subject to the same checks and balances applied 
to the legislative and executive branches.
While some national judiciaries have gained reputations for activism in their judicial 
review, the increasing politicization of the judiciary in many nations has been thrust 
upon courts. Contentious social issues like abortion, same-sex marriage, affirmative 
action or the death penalty may be so divisive that legislatures, governments and the Source: Getty Images/Ulises Ruiz

CONCEPT
Judicial review
The power of judicial 
review is the power 
of the judiciary to 
‘review’, and possibly 
invalidate, the laws, 
decrees and the actions 
of other branches of 
government. In its 
classical sense, the 
principle stems from the 
existence of a codified 
constitution and allows 
the courts to strike down 
as ‘unconstitutional’ 
actions that are deemed 
to be incompatible with 
the constitution. A 
more modest form of 
judicial review, found in 
uncodified systems, is 
restricted to the review 
of executive actions in 
the light of ordinary law 
using the principle of 
ultra vires (beyond the 
powers) to determine 
whether a body has 
acted outside its powers.

public may struggle to develop a consensus to pass laws or guidelines on them. And, 
in their absence, inevitably judiciaries must step in when genuine legal questions 
are raised that must be resolved – while legislatures and governments can choose 
not to act, judiciaries must rule on all cases they hear, making them the final 
arbiter. The judiciary therefore sits in a complex political space and must carefully 
balance between competing impulses to be effective in its role whilst simultaneously 
protecting itself from damaging politicization.

CHAPTER 14
POLITICAL 
EXECUTIVES AND 
LEADERSHIP
PREVIEW
The executive is the irreducible core of government. Political systems can operate without constitutions, legislatures, 
judiciaries and even parties, but they cannot survive without an executive branch to formulate government policy 
and ensure that it is implemented. Such is the potential power of executives that much of political development has 
taken the form of attempts to check or constrain them, either by forcing them to operate within a constitutional 
framework, or by making them accountable to a popular assembly or democratic electorate. Political executives, 
and particularly chief executives, are certainly the face of politics with which the public is most familiar. This is 
because the executive is the source of political leadership. This role has been greatly enhanced by the widening 
responsibilities of the state in both the domestic and international realms, and the media’s tendency to portray 
politics in terms of personalities.
Debates about the nature, extent and implications of executive power are, nevertheless, linked to the wider issue 
of political leadership. Widely seen as a vital ingredient of politics, providing it with a necessary sense of purpose and 
direction, leadership has been interpreted in a variety of ways, ranging from a personal gift to a bureaucratic device. 
Similarly, leadership can involve a variety of styles, strategies and approaches, affecting not only how effective it is 
but also the relationship between leadership and democracy.

ROLE OF THE EXECUTIVE
What is the executive?
The executive is, technically, the branch of government that is responsible for the 
execution or implementation of policy. The division of government into executive, 
legislative and judicial institutions has been sustained by the doctrine of the 
separation of powers (see p. 377), and has been the traditional basis on which to 
analyse government since the time of Montesquieu (see p. 375). From this point of 
view, three distinct branches of government can be identified:
 Legislatures make law; they enact legislation.
 Executives implement law; they execute law.
 Judiciaries interpret law; they adjudicate on the meaning of law.
In practice, however, the executive’s responsibilities tend to be substantially broader, 
as well as more complex. This complexity also extends to the composition of the 
executive. Members of executives have been categorized in one of two ways. First, 
a distinction is often drawn between the ‘political’ executive and the ‘bureaucratic’ 
executive. This highlights the differences between politicians and civil servants, 
and, more broadly, between politics and administration (see Chapter 16). Second, 
various levels of status and responsibility have been identified within executives. 
Whereas assemblies tend to respect at least the formal equality of their members, 
executive branches are typically pyramidal, organized according to a clear 
leadership structure.
The distinction between political and bureaucratic, or official, posts is most clear￾cut in the case of parliamentary executives, where differences in recruitment, 
responsibility, status and political orientation can be identified. In parliamentary 
systems, the political executive comprises elected politicians, ministers drawn from, 
and accountable to, the assembly: their job is to make policy, in accordance with the 
political and ideological priorities of their party, and to oversee its implementation. 
The official executive comprises appointed and professional civil servants whose job 
it is to offer advice and administer policy, subject to the requirements of political 
neutrality (see p. 412) and loyalty to their ministers. Nevertheless, in parliamentary 
systems such as those in Australia, Canada, India and the UK, the political/
bureaucratic distinction is blurred by the fact that senior civil servants often make 
a substantial contribution to policy-making (see Chapter 16) and because use is 
commonly made of temporary, politically committed advisers.
The overlap is usually even greater in presidential executives. In the USA, for 
example, the president and vice president are the only elected politicians in the 
executive. Cabinet members are, in effect, appointed officials, and all the senior and 
many middle-ranking civil servants ultimately serve at the pleasure of the president, 
although there are various conventions and laws that protect the bureaucracy to a 
limited degree. In communist executives, though, the distinction is rendered virtually 
redundant by the all-pervasive reach of the ‘ruling’ communist party. Chinese 
bureaucrats are thus ‘political’, in the sense that they are, in all cases, ideologically 
committed supporters, and usually members, of the Chinese Communist Party.
Parliamentary executive:
An executive, typically 
composed of a prime 
minister and cabinet, 
that is drawn from, and 
accountable to, the 
parliament, and is formed 
through parliamentary 
elections.
Presidential executive: An 
executive that is headed 
by a separately elected 
president, who enjoys 
political and constitutional 
independence from the 
parliament.
CONCEPT
Executive
In its broadest sense, 
the executive is the 
branch of government 
that is responsible for 
the implementation 
of laws and policies. 
More commonly, the 
term is now used in 
a narrower sense to 
describe the smaller 
body of decision￾makers who take 
overall responsibility 
for the direction 
and coordination of 
government policy. This 
group of senior figures is 
often called the political 
executive (roughly 
equivalent to ‘the 
government of the day’, 
or ‘the administration’), 
as opposed to the 
official executive, 
or bureaucracy (see 
p. 409). For ‘core’ 
executive, see p. 363.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_14.indd 346 23-07-2024 12:53:18POLITICAL EXECUTIVES AND LEADERSHIP 347
In comparison with political/bureaucratic distinctions, hierarchical divisions within 
executive branches are easier to identify. In the first place, executives tend to be 
centralized around the leadership (see p. 365) of a single individual. As Montesquieu 
put it, ‘this branch of government, having need of dispatch, is better administered by 
one than by many’ (1748). Two separate posts can, nevertheless, be identified. On 
the one hand, there is the head of state, the person who holds the foremost authority 
to represent the state as a whole. On the other, there is the head of government, or 
the chief executive, who leads the day-to-day operations of government. However, 
the actual power of these positions varies greatly across political systems. In many 
parliamentary systems, for instance, the head of state is largely a figurehead role 
responsible for discharging certain constitutional responsibilities and to provide 
continuity amidst changing governments, like the King of Denmark. Whereas in fully 
presidential systems, like the United States, the head of state and head of government 
are merged into a single office and thus hold all executive powers. In between the two 
lie semi-presidential systems, which vary greatly in the division of executive power 
between the head of state and head of government.
Beneath the chief executive, a range of ministers or secretaries have responsibility 
for developing or implementing policy in specific areas. There is often a hierarchy 
amongst these departmental bosses, imposed either by the importance of their 
policy areas (economics and foreign ministers generally hold leading positions), 
or by their entitlement to sit in the cabinet or in senior committees. As discussed 
further below, cabinets have responsibilities that range from the sharing of policy￾making power in a form of collective leadership to the offering of advice and the 
broader coordination of executive policy. At a lower level are the massed ranks of 
bureaucrats and administrators (discussed in Chapter 16) who, at least in theory, are 
concerned less with policy formulation than with policy implementation. Finally, 
there are enforcement agencies, such as the police force and armed forces, and an 
array of quasi-governmental bodies. These are part of the executive insofar as they 
help to put government policy into effect, but they are staffed by personnel who enjoy 
at least formal independence from the government itself.
Functions of political executives
At its most simple, the task of the political executive is to provide leadership. In this 
sense, the executive functions as the ‘commanding heights’ of the state apparatus, 
the core of the state itself. This role extends over a variety of areas, which means that 
the members of the political executive may carry out several leadership functions, 
sometimes simultaneously. Some examples include:
 policy-making leadership
 popular leadership
 bureaucratic leadership
 coercive leadership
 ceremonial leadership.
Head of state: The 
personal embodiment 
of the state’s power and 
authority. As the leading 
representative of the 
state, they enjoy the 
highest status in the land.
Head of government: The 
leader of the government 
of the day with 
responsibility for policy￾making and administration 
over the nation.
Cabinet: A group of 
senior ministers that 
meets formally and 
regularly, and is chaired 
by the chief executive; 
cabinets may make policy 
or be consultative.

Policy-making leadership
The key function of the political executive is to direct and control the policy process. In 
short, the executive is expected to ‘govern’. This role was substantially expanded during 
the twentieth century in response to the broadening responsibilities of government. 
The political executive develops coherent economic and social programmes that meet 
the needs of more complex and politically sophisticated societies, and to control the 
state’s various external relationships in an increasingly interdependent world. One 
important consequence of this has been the growth of the executive’s legislative powers, 
and its encroachment on the traditional responsibilities of the parliament or assembly.
Not only do political executives usually initiate legislative programmes and help, by 
persuasion or direction, to make the legislative process work, but, in many cases, they 
also exercise a wide range of law-making powers, using decrees, orders and other 
instruments. However, it is misleading to imply that the political executive always 
dominates the policy process. Much policy, for instance, is initiated by political parties 
and interest groups. Moreover, by virtue of their expertise and specialist knowledge, 
bureaucrats or civil servants may play a crucial role in policy formulation; at best, 
leaving the political executive to establish the overall direction of government policy 
(see pp. 417–420).
Popular leadership
The popularity of the political executive, more than any other part of the political 
system, is crucial to the character and stability of the regime. At a policy level, it 
is the ability of the executive to mobilize support that ensures the compliance and 
cooperation of the general public. When new polices are proposed, it is the executive 
which must make the case to the public and generate sufficient political support to 
introduce them. And in a broader sense, the political executive has by far the greatest 
power to shape the political discourse, to influence public opinion, and to define 
what the most pressing issues are and how they might be addressed. And without 
support from the public, or from key groups in society, implementation of new 
polices becomes difficult, perhaps impossible.
Moreover, the political executive’s popularity is linked to the legitimacy of the broader 
regime. While other popular bodies may exist, like legislatures, it is nearly always the 
political executive onto which the public ultimately projects both their desires and 
their frustrations. The unpopularity of a particular government or administration 
does not, in itself, weaken support for the political system, but it may do so in 
the absence of a mechanism for removing and replacing that government. This 
goes some way towards explaining the widespread use of regular and competitive 
elections. Of course, this is not to say that unpopular and immovable executives 
always spell systemic breakdown. Such regimes can survive, but only by resorting 
to authoritarianism (see p. 139), meaning that popular compliance is brought about 
through repression and ideological manipulation.
Bureaucratic leadership
Its task of overseeing the implementation of policy means that the political 
executive has major bureaucratic and administrative responsibilities. In this sense, 
chief executives, ministers and secretaries constitute a ‘top management’ charged 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_14.indd 348 23-07-2024 12:53:18POLITICAL EXECUTIVES AND LEADERSHIP 349
with running the machinery of government. This work is organized largely along 
departmental lines, senior ministers having responsibility for particular policy areas 
and for the bureaucrats engaged to administer those areas. At a higher level, there is 
a need for policy coordination, which is usually accomplished through some kind of 
cabinet system.
This necessary function makes the executive by the far the largest branch of any 
government. While judiciaries may oversee systems of courts, and legislatures may have 
significant staffs to support their work, the executive sits atop a public service that will 
be orders of magnitude larger. Overseeing the vast, nationwide bureaucracy is necessary 
for the smooth day-to-day operation of vital services across a nation, from hospitals 
and libraries to airports and bridges, yet is often a hidden and underappreciated aspect 
of what political executives do (Hess 2020). It also means that what the executive does 
has a far more immediate impact in the lives of citizens.
Coercive leadership
At a fundamental level, the political executive is critical because it alone can exercise 
coercive power. While judges or a legislature may determine that a certain act is 
criminal, somebody must ultimately ‘execute’ or carry out that decision by arresting 
and detaining those who have committed such crimes. This gives the executive 
unique coercive powers in a political system, for it commands resources like the 
police, military and emergency services.
A crucial advantage such powers give the political executive is the ability to take swift 
and decisive action. When crises break out, in either domestic or international politics, 
Sultan Abdullah of Pahang is sworn in as king of Malaysia in 2019. The Malaysian 
monarch serves a limited constitutional role, but has broad powers to provide 
stability in a crisis. The king played a vital role in finding a peaceful solution to the 
2020–2 Malaysian political crisis.

it is invariably the executive that responds, by virtue of its hierarchical structure and 
the scope it provides for personal leadership. It is therefore common for assemblies to 
grant political executives near-dictatorial powers in times of war, and for executives to 
seize ‘emergency powers’ when confronted by domestic crises such as natural disasters, 
terrorist threats, industrial unrest and civil disorder. Clearly, however, the power 
to declare ‘states of emergency’ and to impose effective executive rule is subject to 
abuse. Not uncommonly, governments have used these powers to weaken or eradicate 
political opposition under the guise of constitutionalism (see p. 327).
Ceremonial leadership
Heads of state, chief executives and, to a lesser extent, senior ministers or secretaries 
‘stand for’ the state. In giving state authority personal form, they represent the larger 
society and symbolize, accurately or otherwise, its unity. This role is largely formal 
and ceremonial, and covers, for example, state occasions, foreign visits, international 
conferences and the ratification of treaties and legislation. Non-executive presidents 
and constitutional monarchs are sometimes charged with these essentially 
ceremonial responsibilities, allowing other executive officers to get on with the day￾to-day business of government. The role is, nevertheless, of broader significance for 
two reasons. First, it provides a focus for unity and political loyalty, and so helps to 
build legitimacy (see Chapter 4). Second, it allows those at the top of the executive 
to portray themselves as ‘national leaders’, which is vital to the maintenance of public 
support and electoral credibility.
POWER IN THE EXECUTIVE: WHO LEADS?
The roles and responsibilities of the political executive have been substantially 
enhanced by the emergence of democratic politics, growing government intervention 
and political and economic globalization (see Chapter 4). During the twentieth 
century, political executives acquired ever-wider policy-making and legislative 
responsibilities, took command of sprawling bureaucratic machines and increasingly 
became the focus of popular politics and media attention. These developments have, 
in turn, profoundly affected the internal organization of the executive branch of 
government, and the distribution of power within it. By common consent, the main 
beneficiary of this process has been the chief executive. Heads of government now 
commonly have institutional responsibilities, a political status and a public profile 
that sets them clearly apart from their cabinet or ministerial colleagues.
Nevertheless, this image of growing centralization and the rise of personal power 
conflicts sharply with evidence of leadership failure, and the growing incapacity of 
chief executives to carry out what people have elected them to do (see Chapter 20).
The complex dynamics of executive power can be examined more closely by looking at 
the three most common arrangements – presidential systems, parliamentary systems 
and semi-presidential systems. In all three systems, however, three dimensions of 
power must be borne in mind:
 the formal dimension of power: the constitutional roles and responsibilities of 
executive officers and the institutional frameworks in which they operate
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_14.indd 350 23-07-2024 12:53:19POLITICAL EXECUTIVES AND LEADERSHIP 351
 the informal dimension of power: the role of personality, political skills and 
experience, and the impact of factors such as parties and the media
 the external dimension of power: the political, economic and diplomatic context 
of government, and the broader pressures that bear on the executive branch.
Presidential systems
In a presidential system of executive government, sometimes known just as 
presidentialism, the role of both head of state and head of government are merged 
into a single office, the presidency. In such systems, the president shares power with 
the legislature, but is elected directly by, and thus is responsible primarily to, the 
electorate (see Figure 14.1).
The three principal features of a presidential system are thus:
 All executive authority is concentrated in the hands of a president,
 there is formal separation between the legislative and the executive branches,
 the executive and the legislature are separately elected.
Within presidential systems, presidential executives may be either limited or 
unlimited. Limited presidential executives operate within constraints imposed by a 
constitution, political democracy, party competition and some form of separation 
of powers. Above all, the powers of the president are counterbalanced by those of 
a popularly accountable assembly. The United States is the most notable example, 
but most South American and Central American nations also follow this model. In 
unlimited presidential executives, on the other hand, the president is invested with 
near-unchecked powers, either formally or informally, meaning that these regimes 
are, effectively, dictatorships (see p. 140). They are commonly found in one-party 
states that rest heavily on the support of the military. Unlimited executives can be 
found, for example, in Cameroon, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Just where the balance 
of power lies between the executive and other branches in a presidential system, and, 
indeed, any system, is liable to change depending on the times and circumstances. 
For instance, especially charismatic and popular presidents may come to dominate 
their political systems and become far more powerful than the other branches of 
Presidentialism:

government, or they may do so in times of crisis when the state looks to the president 
for decisive leadership.
Because of the historical significance of the United States in establishing modern 
republican and democratic rule, the presidential system created by the founding 
fathers in the US Constitution has been highly influential, and its evolution is 
instructive in understanding many presidential systems. In investing executive 
power in a presidency, the architects of the US constitution were aware that they 
were, in effect, creating an ‘elective kingship’. Wishing to avoid the abuse of power 
they believed had occurred under the British Crown, they established an intricate 
separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches. This 
was more accurately described by Richard Neustadt (1991) as ‘separated institutions 
sharing powers’. Thus, although the president was designated head of state, chief 
executive, commander-in-chief of the armed forces and chief diplomat, and was 
granted wide-ranging powers of patronage and the right to veto legislation, Congress 
was invested with strong counterbalancing powers. In particular, Congress could 
declare war and override presidential vetoes, and the Senate was empowered to 
approve appointments and ratify treaties. Indeed, until the early twentieth century 
the presidency and the Congress both provided policy leadership on more or less 
equal terms, and for long stretches of the nineteenth century, Congress was even 
considered the more dominant of the two.
The status of the US presidency was then transformed by two key developments. 
First, a national economy developed that required the government to abandon 
its traditional laissez-faire policies (see p. 170) and adopt a more interventionist 
approach to economic and social life. Second, the USA was forced to drop its policy 
of isolationism and accept a global role, assuming after the Second World War a 
superpower status, in a bipolar, and subsequently unipolar, world system. Since 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal in the 1930s, US presidents have 
played the role of chief legislator, and since 1945 have worn the mantle of the leader 
of the ‘free world’. Alarmed by the ease with which Lyndon Johnson and Richard 
Nixon escalated the Vietnam War without war being formally declared by Congress, 
Arthur Schlesinger (1974) went so far as to proclaim the emergence of an ‘imperial 
presidency’.
Nevertheless, presidential power commonly continues to be fragile and insubstantial. 
Neustadt’s classic text Presidential Power (1991) remains correct: the chief power of 
the US president is the ‘power to persuade’; that is, the ability to bargain, encourage 
and even cajole, but not dictate. This principle is broadly true of most presidential 
systems, as the ability of presidents to get their way depends on three crucial 
relationships, specifically those with the legislature, the federal bureaucracy and 
the media. The president’s relationship with a legislature is undoubtedly the most 
crucial. The success of particular presidents, for instance, is often quantified in terms 
of their ‘success rate’ with the legislature; that is, the proportion of their programmes 
or policy agenda passed by the legislature. While in most presidential systems the 
legislature has less popular support and political capital than the president, they 
usually maintain control over several vital levels of power in a state. Foremost 
amongst them is budgetary powers – nearly all political systems place the power to 
allocate funds in the hands of the legislature, rather than the executive. Government’s 
Imperial presidency:
A presidency that has 
broken free from its 
constitutional bounds and 
threatens to dominate 
the other two branches of 
government.

cannot implement policies without funding, so this necessitates cooperation and 
often arduous negotiation between the legislature and executive for government 
to operate. Beyond this, many major policies require new legislation or treaties to 
authorize, although in many presidential systems executives have become more 
creative in bypassing these requirements. Furthermore, many presidential systems 
require legislatures to approve presidential appointments, from cabinets to judges, 
again necessitating some degree of cooperation.
Presidents do have a variety of powers at their disposal, however. Firstly, because 
presidents are directly elected by the people, and they campaign on particular policy 
platforms, they have a reasonable claim to a popular mandate (see p. 247) when elected. 
Their greater visibility in the public eye, and usually a much stronger presence in the 
media (see Chapter 9), also gives them the ability, as Theodore Roosevelt once noted, 
to use the ‘bully pulpit’ and create public support for an agenda that can persuade the 
legislature to act as desired (Edwards 2006). Secondly, the human and informational 
resources at the disposal of executive government are usually far greater than that 
of the legislature, giving it a much clearer sense of the needs of the state. Thirdly, 
presidents can use various inducements to build factions in their legislatures to 
support their agenda. If a president is politically popular, for instance, legislators will 
benefit from their endorsement in elections. Budget negotiations may involve direct 
benefits to districts, like pork barrelling (see p. 378) to win over legislators, and in 
some presidential systems political appointments are explicitly made with the aim of 
rewarding supporters and securing influence.
One of the greatest challenges posed in presidential systems is that, unlike the 
parliamentary system, the executive and legislature are separately elected. This means 
its entirely possible for a presidency to be held by one party, and the legislature to 
be held by another. Yet even when both branches are controlled by the same party, 
the interests and agendas of the branches can easily diverge. This creates a recipe 
for sometimes arduous inter-branch conflict between presidents and legislatures 
and increases the chance of deadlock when neither branch can pass its agenda. In 
some presidential systems, prolonged deadlock has encouraged presidents to find 
ways to bypass their legislatures rather than work with them. Presidential decrees, 
for instance, may allow the executive to create policy without legislative approval. 
Although many amount only to rule-making (see p. 334), in some systems these can 
have the force of law or have implications that effectively amount to law-making. In 
Argentina, for instance, Necessity and Urgency Decrees are orders that can be issued 
by the president with force of law in times of special need, with the proviso that the 
legislature must review and approve their continuation. Such executive actions can 
be necessary to end deadlock and keep government functioning, but they can also be 
readily abused to allow executives to rule without legislative oversight. Argentinian 
President Nestor Kirchner issued more than 270 ‘urgent’ decrees during his presidency 
between 2003 and 2007, many of which concerned non-urgent affairs, and none of 
these were ultimately reviewed by the legislature. In 2012, US President Barack Obama 
announced an executive order that would allow eligible undocumented immigrants 
to avoid deportation and receive work permits. This effectively amounted to non￾enforcement of US immigration laws for millions of technically illegal aliens, which 
opponents decried as an unconstitutional abuse of executive power.

Beyond the power of budgets and legislation, in most presidential systems the legislature 
has the final power to remove a president from office through impeachment, though 
usually with a high bar required to do so. Impeachment proceedings are usually 
reserved in constitutions for situations where serious crimes have been committed 
by the executive, though just as often their use represents a complete breakdown in 
the relationship between the legislature and executive. For instance, since 2017, a 
political crisis in Peru has seen the Peruvian Congress launch seven impeachment 
attempts, two of which resulted in the removal of the president, while another 
resigned during the proceedings. At the heart of the crisis lies thus far irresolvable 
agreements over the policy direction of the country, deep divisions amongst different 
groups in Peruvian society, and a highly fragmented political system with control 
split over many different parties. The presidential system of Peru gives the president 
power to veto legislation and to dissolve the legislature and call fresh elections, while 
the legislature in turn has the power to control budgets and legislation and impeach 
the president. This mutual ability to deny the other to act, and dismiss each other, has 
resulted in a nearly perpetual cycle of inter-branch recrimination.
By contrast, in theory, the federal bureaucracy exists solely to serve the executive in 
presidential systems, though in practice, it often acts as an embarrassing constraint. 
For example, although US presidents make, directly or indirectly, about 4,000 
appointments at senior and middle-ranking levels in their administrations, this is 
a minimal proportion of the total number of professional bureaucrats in the USA, 
who number over 2 million. Moreover, it is widely argued that these bureaucrats 
frequently respond to interests at odds with the priorities of the administration. As 
Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson, future president Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt described influencing the Navy Department as like punching a feather 
mattress: ‘you punch and punch but it remains the same’.
For this reason, presidents must also manage and cultivate their relationship with 
the bureaucracy, rather than assume unrivalled control over it. Sometimes called the 
‘managerial’ presidency, this aspect of executive government requires presidents to 
strategically manage their staffs and their offices, appoint strong allies to key positions 
to manage subordinates and think in an entirely different way about how policy will get 
implemented (Pfiffner 1999). Yet this aspect of government is often far less visible to 
the public than relations between the executive and the legislature. Chiefs of staff, for 
instance, are crucial figures appointed by presidents to manage their offices, oversee 
staff appointments, manage requests, coordinate the bureaucracy and negotiate with 
other executives. Their unrivalled access to the president, and ability to influence 
what they see and respond to, makes them very powerful, and yet they are unelected 
and often largely invisible. In Brazil, the position is known as the Head of the Civilian 
House of the Presidency, and it is often described as the second most powerful role in 
the country, and yet most occupants have been little known by the public.
The final key relationship is that between the president and the media. In nearly all 
presidential systems, the media is vital to presidents who need to appeal directly to the 
public and influence the legislative agenda. In this respect, presidents such as Ronald 
Reagan, a former actor and journalist, were remarkably successful in ‘managing’ 
media coverage and ensuring favourable comment. Nevertheless, presidents who live 
by the media may also die by them. For instance, the media are often portrayed as 
Impeachment: A formal 
process for the removal 
of a public official in the 
event of personal or 
professional wrongdoing.

the USA’s fourth branch of government, which prizes both its political independence 
and its reputation for seeking truth. President Bill Clinton owed much to his media 
charm and favourable news coverage in his rise as relatively unknown Governor of 
Arkansas to winning the Democratic primaries and ultimately presidency in 1992. 
Yet relentless coverage of the Whitewater affair, Travelgate and then the Lewinsky 
scandal had seriously weakened the Clinton administration by the end of his second 
term. The importance of the media as a key lever of informal power in a political 
system has meant that executive governments of all types have greatly expanded their 
emphasis on media management in recent decades, and large communication staffs 
are attached to most presidential and prime-ministerial offices.
POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
TURKEY: A NEW SULTAN?
In the late evening of 15 July 2016, residents in Istanbul 
became aware that the Bosphorus Bridge and the Fatih 
Sultan Mehmet Bridge had been closed, while the noise 
of gunshots reverberated in the capital Ankara, where 
military jets and helicopters were seen flying overhead. In 
the early morning of the following day, President Recep 
Tayyip Erdoğan urged people to take to the streets to 
protest what he described as an attempted coup by a 
minority faction with the military. As the day unfolded, it 
became clear that the Erdoğan regime had survived the 
coup. Turkish authorities also laid the blame for the putsch 
on the US-based Islamist cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who had 
controlled Turkey, together with Erdoğan, for many years, 
until a power struggle led to a falling out in 2013.
The leader of the Islamist political party, the Justice and 
Development Party (AKP), Erdoğan served as Turkey’s 
prime minister from 2003 to 2014, before being elected 
president of Turkey in 2014. In these roles, he has pursued 
a moderate conservative politics based on Islamic values, 
which, some argue, has compromised Turkey’s identity as 
a constitutional republic, committed to the rule of law, 
popular sovereignty and a strict separation of politics from 
religion. His critics have also alleged that, by strengthening 
his own powerbase and systematically undermining political 
opposition, he has transformed the Turkish political system 
from one based on limited presidentialism to one based 
on unlimited presidentialism, or ‘one-man rule’. This has 
been evident in a number of developments. For example, 
the aftermath of the coup attempt saw not only the arrest 
of some 200 journalists and the closure of over twenty 
media outlets, but also the imposition of a three-month 
state of emergency, during which tens of thousands of 
government officials and public-sector workers alleged to 
be associated with the ‘traitorous’ Gulen movement were 
purged. Some critics of the government went so far as to 
suggest that the coup had been staged to provide a pretext 
for what would otherwise have been a naked power grab 
by  Erdoğan. A constitutional referendum held in April 
2017, and Erdoğan’s successful re-election in June 2018, 
greatly extended the president’s sphere of control. Turkey’s 
parliamentary system was replaced by a presidential 
system, and the post of prime minister was abolished.
However, this image of President Erdoğan’s regime may 
be a gross distortion of facts. For one thing, the claim that 
the Gulen movement constituted an anti-constitutional 
threat against which Erdoğan’s presidency had to be 
defended may not have been fanciful. The exiled cleric 
had built up an empire of schools, universities and media 
companies in more than 160 countries worldwide, and his 
followers occupied key positions in the Turkish military and 
the state system generally. For another thing, it is widely

Parliamentary systems
The structure and form of executive power found in parliamentary systems differs 
significantly from that in presidential ones. Parliamentary executives have three 
essential features:
 The executive is drawn from the legislature and the branches are only partially 
separated.
 Only the legislature is directly elected, and the executive is responsible to the 
legislature.
 Executive authority lies principally with the head of government, while there is 
usually a separate head of state with largely ceremonial powers.
The external dynamics of executive power in parliamentary systems thus contrast 
sharply with those found in presidential ones. In short, parliamentary executives are 
forced to govern in and through legislatures, while presidential executives tend to 
rely on a personal mandate and an independent set of constitutional powers. This 
undoubtedly also affects the internal dynamics of power. In particular, it creates 
a greater pressure in parliamentary executives for collective decision-making and 
collaboration, often reflected in the higher status of the cabinet in these systems. 
However, many commentators have argued that the growth of prime-ministerial 
power has effectively turned prime ministers into quasi-presidents (see p. 230).
Prime ministers are heads of government whose power is derived from their leadership 
of the majority party, or coalition (see p. 292) of parties, in the legislature. The range of 
formal powers with which the office of prime minister is invested is typically modest 
in comparison with those of executive presidents. The most important of these 
accepted that, as elements in Turkey’s officer corps had yet 
to be reconciled to the shift in power from the military to 
civilians, a military coup was a very real possibility. After 
all, Turkey’s generals had staged military coups on four 
occasions between 1960 and 1997, the last of which had 
forced the country’s first Islamist prime minister from 
office. Finally, despite its creeping authoritarianism under 
Erdoğan, Turkey’s democracy retains a reasonable degree 
of vitality and diversity. Support for the AKP in still deeply 
conservative rural Turkey has been supplemented by 
Erdoğan’s attempt to turn Turkey into a major regional 
power, while, lacking an overall majority in the National 
Assembly, the AKP is left dependent on its junior coalition 
partner, the largely secular, anti-Kurdish Nationalist 
Movement Party.
In May of 2023, Erdoğan was elected to a third term 
as president. His candidacy was controversial, as the 
Turkish constitution limits the president to serving two 
terms, but the Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey, 
composed largely of Erdoğan allies, determined that the 
2017 constitutional referendum had ‘reset’ the count, 
allowing Erdoğan to run again. As with previous elections, 
Erdoğan’s victory was narrow at around 52 per cent, and 
demographically split, with rural areas overwhelmingly 
backing Erdoğan, while urban centres and Kurdish regions 
supported the opposition. Though international observers 
raised concerns about various advantages the government 
enjoys in media coverage and campaigning, most concede 
the elections were competitive and conducted fairly. Over 
two decades, Erdoğan has transformed Turkish politics 
and greatly strengthened the power of the executive, 
leading some to dub him the ‘new sultan’ of Turkey. And 
yet consistent, if slim, electoral majorities have seemingly 
backed and legitimated this transformation from a semi￾presidential system to a fully presidential one with very few 
checks on presidential power.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_14.indd 356 23-07-2024 12:53:20POLITICAL EXECUTIVES AND LEADERSHIP 357
powers is the control of patronage – the ability to hire and fire, promote and demote, 
ministers. Though in the Netherlands and Australia, for example, even this power is 
exercised by the legislature or the majority party. As the job of prime minister can 
have only a loose constitutional description, it is no exaggeration to say that the post 
is what its holder chooses to make of it or, more accurately, is able to make of it.
In practice, this boils down to two key sets of prime-ministerial relationships. The 
first set is with the cabinet, individual ministers and government departments; the 
second is with his or her party and, through it, the legislature and the public. The 
support of the cabinet is particularly crucial to prime ministers who are designated 
primus inter pares (first among equals), such as those in the UK, India and Australia. 
This status forces prime ministers to operate through a system of collective cabinet 
government (see p. 362). Their power is therefore a reflection of the degree to which, 
by patronage, cabinet management and the control of the machinery of government, 
they can ensure that ministers serve under them. In contrast, German chancellors 
are personally empowered by Article 65 of the Basic Law (1949) to decide the general 
lines of government policy. However, the same article also constrains their power by 
stipulating that ministers enjoy autonomy in relation to their departments.
There is no doubt that the key to prime-ministerial power and influence lies in his or 
her position as party leader. Indeed, the modern premiership is largely a product of 
the emergence of disciplined political parties. Not only is the post of prime minister 
allocated on the basis of party leadership, it also provides its holder with a means of 
controlling the assembly and a base from which the image of a national leader can 
be constructed. The degree of party unity, the parliamentary strength of the prime 
Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison, the twenty-ninth and thirtieth prime 
ministers of Australia. Between 2008 and 2018, Australia has had six different 
prime ministers.

minister’s party (in particular, whether it rules alone or as a member of a coalition), 
and the authority vested in the assembly (or, at least, its first chamber), are therefore 
important determinants of prime-ministerial power. For instance, in Japan, factional 
rivalry within the LDP has often ensured that the tenure of prime ministers is short 
(nineteen prime ministers came and went between 1974 and 2012) and cabinets have 
frequently been reconstructed (see pp. 288–289). In Australia, a combination of a 
short three-year election cycle, the use of the alternative vote electoral system (see 
p. 258) and compulsory voting has created a situation in which prime ministers are 
unusually vulnerable to pressure from MPs and cabinet colleagues, especially when 
their approval ratings slump. The appointment in 2018 of Scott Morrison in place of 
Malcolm Turnbull, for example, marked Australia’s sixth change of prime minister in 
eleven years.
Nevertheless, there is agreement that despite their differing constitutional and 
political positions, prime-ministerial power has grown in recent years. This results 
in part from the tendency (of the broadcast media, in particular) to focus on 
personalities, meaning that prime ministers become a kind of ‘brand image’ of their 
parties. The growth of international summitry and foreign visits also provides prime 
ministers with opportunities to cultivate an image of statesmanship and gives them 
scope to portray themselves as national leaders. In some cases, this has led to the 
allegation that prime ministers have effectively emancipated themselves from cabinet 
constraints and established a form of prime-ministerial government. For instance, in 
India an imperial style of premiership developed under Indira Gandhi and her son 
Rajiv that reached its peak during the state of emergency, 1975–7. This was possible 
because of the secure majorities that the Congress Party enjoyed in parliament, the 
ruthless control exerted over the apparatus of central government and the sway that 
the Gandhi dynasty continued to exert over important sections of the Indian public.
Although prime ministers who command cohesive parliamentary majorities can 
wield power that would be the envy of many a president, they are also subject to 
important constraints. By no means, for instance, do prime ministers have a free 
hand in terms of hiring and firing. The need to maintain party unity by ensuring that 
the various factions and ideological wings of the party are represented in the cabinet, 
and the pressure in countries such as Canada to maintain regional and linguistic 
representation, act as important checks on prime-ministerial power. Ultimately, 
prime ministers are only as powerful as their cabinets, parties and broader political 
circumstances allow them to be. This can be seen in India, where, following the 
excesses of the emergency in the 1970s, prime ministers such as Desai, Singh and 
Rao, leading coalition or minority governments, reduced the size of the prime 
minister’s staff, were willing to respect the autonomy of government departments 
and interfered less in the affairs of state governments.
In the UK, Gordon Brown’s premiership, 2007–10, was blighted, despite his 
parliamentary majority, both by his personal limitations as a political communicator 
and the severe recession that was triggered by the 2007–9 global financial crisis. This 
effectively destroyed Brown’s and Labour’s reputation for economic competence. 
The principal source of weakness of the UK’s next two prime ministers, both 
Conservative, was that their freedom of manoeuvre was substantially constrained by 
the lack of a Commons majority. In the case of David Cameron, this forced him into 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_14.indd 358 23-07-2024 12:53:20POLITICAL EXECUTIVES AND LEADERSHIP 359
a coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats in 2010, although he was released from 
this by the slim majority he won in 2015, before standing down the following year 
after being defeated in the EU referendum. In the case of his successor, Theresa May, 
her catastrophic decision to call a premature general election in 2017 left her reliant 
on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party and exposed her to increasingly 
bitter factionalism within her own party, especially over the issue of Brexit.
Parliamentary executives are also not the head of state, which means, at least formally, 
some of the most important powers of the state lie elsewhere. In constitutional 
monarchies, those powers lie with the monarch. In other systems, like India, Israel 
and Germany, this role lies with non-executive presidents. In most parliamentary 
systems, the head of state’s responsibilities are confined largely to ceremonial duties, 
and nearly all real executive power is wielded by the prime minister. However, usually 
the head of state does have reserve powers to dismiss governments, call elections, 
command the armed forces and in some cases veto legislation or make emergency 
decrees. These powers are absolute, rather than subject to checks and balances, and 
are sometimes essential to resolve deadlocks or political crises. For instance, in 
1975, the Governor-General of Australia, a largely ceremonial head of state, used his 
reserve powers to sack the government of Gough Whitlam and called fresh elections, 
after a prolonged deadlock between the legislature and the executive prevented the 
passage of a budget and the funding of the government. It is by convention that the 
head of state exercises these powers with great restraint.

PRIME-MINISTERIAL GOVERNMENT: A VIRTUE 
OR A VICE?
Prime-ministerial government has two key features. First, the office of prime minister is the 
central link between the legislative and executive branches of government, its holder being 
drawn from and accountable to the assembly, and also serving as chief executive and head 
of the bureaucracy. Second, prime-ministerial government reflects the centralization of 
executive power in the hands of the prime minister and the effective subordination of both the 
cabinet and departmental ministers. In this, it parallels presidentialism.
Prime-ministerial government has been criticized for the following reasons:
 It strengthens centralization by weakening the constraints formerly exerted by the 
cabinet and government departments.
 It narrows policy debate and weakens scrutiny by excluding criticisms and alternative 
viewpoints.
However, it can be defended on the following grounds:
 It reflects the personal mandate that prime ministers acquire in general elections.
 It gives government policy clearer direction by checking the centrifugal pressures embodied 
in departmentalism (see p. 420) and the ‘nudge and fudge’ of collective decision-making.

Semi-presidential systems
The third major category of executive arrangements is the semi-presidential system, 
which sits somewhere between parliamentary and presidential systems. These are 
hybrid systems. They comprise, as in presidential systems, a separately elected 
president invested with a range of executive powers and, as in parliamentary systems, 
a government, usually featuring a prime minister and a cabinet, drawn from and 
accountable to the legislature. Semi-presidential systems vary significantly in the 
balance of power between the president and the prime minister, and the behaviour of 
political executives within them will vary. In Namibia, for instance, the prime minister 
and cabinet are appointed from the legislature by the president, subject to the approval 
of legislature, but may be dismissed by the president at any time. Though the prime 
minister technically leads the government, this arrangement makes the president the 
most powerful executive and the main driver of policy. In Mongolia, by contrast, the 
prime minster is elected by the legislature and cannot be removed by the president, and 
thus policy leadership generally comes from the legislature. However, the Mongolian 
president does have significant powers of appointment and veto, and often provides 
influential input into government, as well as having a highly visible public and policy 
role. Still other systems split policy domains. In Finland and Austria, for example, the 
FOCUS ON . . . 
THE MONARCHY DEBATE
A monarchy is a system of rule dominated by one person (it literally means ‘rule by one person’). 
In general usage, however, it is the institution through which the post of head of state is filled 
through inheritance or dynastic succession. In absolute monarchies, the monarch claims, if 
seldom exercises, a monopoly of political power (examples being Saudi Arabia, Swaziland and 
the Vatican City). In constitutional monarchies, the monarch fulfils an essentially ceremonial 
function largely devoid of political significance (for example, in Spain, the Netherlands and 
the UK).
The advantages of a constitutional monarchy are as follows:
 It provides a solution to the need for a non-partisan head of state who is ‘above’ party 
politics.
 The monarch embodies traditional authority, and so serves as a symbol of patriotic loyalty 
and national unity.
 The monarch constitutes a repository of experience and wisdom, especially in relation to 
constitutional matters, available to elected governments.
The disadvantages of a constitutional monarchy include the following:
 It violates democratic principles, in that political authority is not based on popular consent 
and is in no way publicly accountable.
 The monarch symbolizes (and possibly supports) conservative values such as hierarchy, 
deference and respect for inherited wealth and social position.
 The monarchy binds nations to outmoded ways and symbols of the past, thus impeding 
progress.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_14.indd 360 23-07-2024 12:53:20POLITICAL EXECUTIVES AND LEADERSHIP 361
president tends to concentrate on foreign affairs and broader constitutional issues, 
while the prime minister and cabinet take charge of domestic policy.
Because semi-presidential systems split executive power and policy leadership roles 
between the head of state and head of government, the prospect of cohabitation
arises when the president and prime minister belong to opposing parties. How 
problematic this is depends on how evenly split executive powers are. Cohabitation 
is most notable in France, where the president effectively operates as the pre-eminent 
driver of policy and is the foremost elected executive, but the head of government, 
responsible only to legislature, holds significant powers. This situation led Arend 
Lijphart to observe that, when the president and legislature were controlled by one 
party, France operated more like a presidential system, but in periods of cohabitation 
operated more like a parliamentary system, with power shifting to the prime minister 
(Lijphart 2012). Thus, the specific dynamics of semi-presidential systems can depend 
greatly not just on the formal constitutional arrangements but also various situational 
factors, and the relative power between the two executives may change over time.
Cabinets
Virtually all political executives feature a cabinet of some sort. A cabinet is a 
committee of senior ministers who represent the various government departments 
or ministries. This term is not to be confused with ‘cabinet’, as used in France and the 
European Union to denote small groups of policy advisers who support individual 
ministers. The widespread use of cabinets reflects the political and administrative 
need for collective procedures within the political executive. In the first place, 
cabinets enable government to present a collective face to assemblies and the public. 
Without a cabinet, government could appear to be a personal tool wielded by a single 
individual. Second, cabinets are an administrative device designed to ensure the 
effective coordination of government policy. They allow individuals to specialize in 
specific aspects of government and provide focused leadership in individual policy 
areas. Thirdly, they provide a formal forum for policy discussion and decision￾making, and a conduit for ideas and advice to head of government.
The precise role and political importance of cabinets vary from system to system and 
state to state. In presidential systems such as the USA’s, cabinet secretaries serve the 
president by acting as a policy advisers and administrators of the bureaucracies of the 
government, rather than as policymakers. Indeed, in the second half of the twentieth 
century, executive growth in the USA occurred largely at a non-cabinet level, in the form 
of the construction of the Executive Office of the President (discussed in Chapter 16). In 
contrast, the cabinet, in theory at least, is the apex of the executive in states that respect 
the principle of cabinet government, such as the UK, most of the Commonwealth and 
several European countries (including Italy, Sweden and Norway).
It is, nevertheless, difficult in practice to find examples of collective executives that 
operate through a cabinet or equivalent body. In theory, a form of collective leadership 
operates in China, reflecting the Marxist–Leninist belief that the Communist Party 
(CCP), rather than a single leader, is the leading and guiding force in Chinese society. 
In practice, the leadership system in China has been dominated by a paramount 
individual. In the cases of Mao Zedong (see p. 482), during 1949–76, and Deng 
Xiaoping, during 1978–97, they wielded such supreme power that they retained their

position until they died. More recent Chinese leaders have combined their position 
with the posts of general secretary of the CCP and President of the People’s Republic 
of China. In Germany, and commonly throughout continental Europe, a tradition of 
departmental specialization discourages ministers from seeing themselves as ‘team 
players’, and so counters any tendency towards cabinet government.
Even in the UK system, supposedly the archetypal example of cabinet government, 
it is difficult to see the cabinet as a decision-making body, let alone as a democratic 
forum. This is because the rise of prime-ministerial power subverted the collective 
nature of UK government, and the growth in the range and complexity of government 
policy has also ensured that most decisions are effectively made elsewhere, and thus 
reach the cabinet in a pre-packaged form. This highlights the important contribution 
that government departments make to policy formulation, as well as the impact of 
cabinet committees and, indeed, subcommittees. In the UK and elsewhere, the full 
cabinet is merely the hub of a cabinet system, comprising committees of subject 
specialists able to examine policy proposals in greater detail and depth than is 
possible in the cabinet itself. This system weakens the cabinet, both because it 
strengthens the levers of control that are available to the prime minister, who sets up 
and staffs committees, and because full cabinets usually lack the time and expertise to 
FOCUS ON . . . 
CABINET GOVERNMENT: ADVANTAGES AND 
DISADVANTAGES
Cabinet government is characterized by two central features. First, the cabinet constitutes 
the principal link between the legislative and executive branches of government; its members 
are drawn from and accountable to the parliament, but also serve as the political heads of 
the various government departments. Second, the cabinet is the senior executive organ, and 
policy-making responsibility is shared within it, the prime minister being ‘first’ in name only. 
This system is usually underpinned by collective responsibility – all the cabinet ministers are 
required to ‘sing the same song’ and support official government policy.
The virtues of cabinet government are the following:
 It encourages full and frank policy debate within the democracy of cabinet meetings, 
subjecting proposals to effective scrutiny.
 It guarantees the unity and cohesion of government, since the cabinet makes decisions 
collectively and collectively stands by them.
However, cabinet government has been criticized for the following reasons:
 It acts as a cloak for prime-ministerial power because it forces dissenting ministers to 
support agreed government policy in public.
 It means that government policy becomes incoherent and inconsistent, as decisions are 
based on compromises between competing ministers and departmental interests.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_14.indd 362 23-07-2024 12:53:21POLITICAL EXECUTIVES AND LEADERSHIP 363
challenge proposals that emanate from committees. The complex relationships that 
result from this have been explained by some commentators in terms of the idea of a 
‘core executive’ (Rhodes and Dunleavy 1995).
On the other hand, it would be a mistake to dismiss cabinets as merely ‘dignified’ 
institutions. In multi-party parliamentary systems, for instance, cabinets are the primary 
means by which a governing coalition is constructed. When such cabinets break apart 
over policy disagreement, the coalition, and often the government, will fall as well. In 
2023, after months of disagreement over immigration policy and other matters, the Dutch 
cabinet dissolved and Prime Minister Mark Rutte, no longer commanding a governing 
majority in the legislature, resigned. Numerous governments of the Netherlands have 
fallen in this manner, often precipitating new elections, and thus Dutch prime ministers 
must carefully manage their cabinets to maintain their governing coalitions.
Yet even in the absence of multiple parties, cabinets often represent key factions and 
interests within the governing party (see p. 284), and prime ministers are sometimes 
removed as a result of pressure from within the cabinet, or from senior party figures. 
Margaret Thatcher interpreted her fall in 1990 in precisely these terms. Thatcher 
claimed to have been ousted by a cabinet coup through the withdrawal of ministerial 
support once she had failed to secure re-election as party leader on the first ballot 
(Thatcher 1993). In July 2022, Boris Johnson, amidst repeated missteps and scandals, 
and plummeting popularity in opinion polls, stepped down as prime minister. 
Although he had survived a vote of no confidence the previous month, was several 
years from facing election and commanded a comfortable parliamentary majority, it 
was the mass resignation of nearly half his cabinet that made his leadership untenable 
and compelled his resignation.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte meets with his cabinet in 2012. In the 
Netherlands, as with many multi-party democracies, assembling a cabinet that 
balances the interests of its participants and can endure over the long-term is the 
key task for forming government.

CONCEPT
Core executive
The core executive 
is a network of 
institutions and people 
who play key roles in 
the overall direction 
and coordination of 
government policy. It 
usually encompasses the 
prime minister, senior 
policy advisers, leading 
cabinet members, 
cabinet committees 
and staff in strategically 
important government 
departments. The core 
executive model gets 
away from the simplistic 
‘prime minister versus 
cabinet’ debate by 
acknowledging that 
these bodies operate 
within an institutional 
context. It also 
acknowledges the extent 
to which policy influence 
is exerted through the 
building up of alliances 
and coalitions of support.

LEADERS AND LEADERSHIP
Leadership: its fall and rise?
In some respects, the subject of political leadership appears to be outdated. The 
division of society into leaders and followers is rooted in a pre-democratic culture of 
deference and respect in which leaders ‘knew best’ and the public needed to be led, 
mobilized or guided. Democratic politics may not have removed the need for leaders, 
but it has certainly placed powerful constraints on leadership; notably, by making 
leaders publicly accountable and establishing an institutional mechanism through 
which they can be called to account and removed. In other respects, however, the 
politics of leadership has become increasingly significant, helping to contribute 
to the establishment of a separate discipline of political psychology, whose major 
concerns include a study of the psychological make-up and motivations of political 
leaders (Kressel 1993).
This growing focus on leadership has occurred for a number of reasons. For instance, 
to some extent, democracy itself has enhanced the importance of personality by 
forcing political leaders, in effect, to ‘project themselves’ in the hope of gaining 
electoral support. This tendency has undoubtedly been strengthened by modern 
means of mass communication, which tend to emphasize personalities, rather than 
policies, and provide leaders with powerful weapons with which to manipulate their 
public image. Furthermore, as society becomes more complex and fragmented, 
people may increasingly look to the personal vision of individual leaders to give 
coherence and meaning to the world in which they live. Ironically, then, leadership 
may never have been so important, but also so difficult to deliver.
This tendency in politics towards ‘personalization’ has, arguably, become more 
prominent in the twenty-first century for at least two reasons. The first is the decline 
of political parties, discussed in the final section of Chapter 11. This has been evident 
in attempts by leaders either to rebrand or even reconstruct their party around their 
own personal beliefs and policy inclinations, or to win power by, effectively, waging 
war against their own party. An example of the former is Emmanuel Macron, a former

KEY THINKER
FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE (1844–1900)
German philosopher. A professor of Greek at Basel by the age of twenty-five, Nietzsche 
became increasingly interested in the ideas of Schopenhauer (1788–1860) and the music 
of Wagner (1813–83). Growing illness and insanity after 1889 brought him under the 
control of his sister Elizabeth, who edited and distorted his writings. Nietzsche’s complex 
and ambitious work stressed the importance of will, especially the ‘will to power’, and it 
anticipated modern existentialism in emphasizing that people create their own worlds and 
make their own values. He attacked conventional values based on God, truth and morality, 
and sought to replace these with new values and a new ideal of the human person. His best 
known writings include Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883), Beyond Good and Evil (1886) and 
On the Genealogy of Morals (1887).

member of the Socialist Party, who, in 2016, founded the political movement En 
Marche! to provide the basis for his presidential bid the following year. An example 
of the latter is Donald Trump, who won the 2016 Republican presidential nomination 
largely by attacking the policies and values of the Republican establishment. The 
second reason is the diminishing significance of political ideology, in general, 
and the left/right divide, in particular. In these circumstances, leaders may seize 
the opportunity to forge a personally based ideological identity (‘Reaganism’, 
‘Thatcherism’, ‘Blairism’, ‘Trumpism’ and so on) and parties are more likely to use 
credible or dynamic leadership as a means of gaining a competitive advantage at 
election time.
Theories of leadership
The question of political leadership is surrounded by controversy. To what extent is 
leadership compatible with freedom and democracy? Does personalized leadership 
inspire and motivate, or does it subdue and repress? Are strong leaders to be admired 
or feared? At the heart of these disagreements lie differing views about the nature 
of political leadership. What does the phenomenon of leadership comprise? Where 
does leadership come from? There are four different ways that observers have tended 
to describe as the origins of leadership:
 a natural gift
 a sociological phenomenon
 an organizational necessity
 a political skill.
A natural gift
The traditional view of leadership sees it as a rare but natural gift. As Aristotle (see p. 4)
put it, ‘men are marked out from the moment of birth to rule or be ruled’. From this 
perspective, leadership is strictly an individual quality, manifest in the personalities 
of what were traditionally thought of as ‘men of destiny’. The most extreme version 
of this theory is found in the fascist ‘leader principle’ (Führerprinzip). This is based 
on the idea of a single, supreme leader, who alone is capable of leading the masses to 
their destiny. Such an idea was, in part, derived from Friedrich Nietzsche’s (see p. 364)
notion of the Übermensch (the ‘overman’ or ‘superman’), who rises above the ‘herd 
instinct’ of conventional morality and so achieves self-mastery (Nietzsche 1883). In a 
more modest form, this theory of leadership is embodied in the idea of charisma (see 
p. 88), generally understood to mean the power of personality. The classic examples 
of charismatic leaders are usually seen as forceful personalities (such as Castro, 
Gandhi and Mandela), although the more modest, but no less effective, ‘fireside chats’ 
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the practised televisual skills of many successful 
modern leaders also exemplify charismatic qualities. Charismatic leaders have been 
much studied, for they seem to have an ability to persuade others and shape politics 
far beyond what is normally observed. In many cases, they foster deeply emotive 
and psychological attachments between themselves and their followers, and thus 
command more loyalty and more leeway with their publics. This connection may be 
CONCEPT
Leadership
Leadership can be 
understood either as a 
pattern of behaviour, or 
as a personal quality. As 
a pattern of behaviour, 
leadership is the 
influence exerted by 
an individual or group 
over a larger body to 
organize or direct its 
efforts towards the 
achievement of desired 
goals. As a personal 
attribute, leadership 
refers to the character 
traits that enable the 
leader to exert influence 
over others; leadership is 
thus effectively equated 
with charisma (see p.
88). In both respects, 
however, leadership 
requires ‘followership’. 
For a claim to leadership 
to be upheld, others, 
the followers, must 
recognize and act on 
that claim.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_14.indd 365 23-07-2024 12:53:21366 POLITICS
reinforced by natural qualities on the part of the leader and circumstances of need or 
crisis in which people feel particularly fearful or isolated (Willner 1984; Nye, 2008).
A sociological phenomenon
An alternative view of leadership sees it as a sociological, rather than psychological, 
phenomenon. From this perspective leaders are ‘created’ by particular socio￾historical forces. They do not so much impose their will on the world as act as a 
vehicle through which historical forces are exerted. This is certainly the approach 
adopted by Marxists, who believe that historical development is structured largely 
by economic factors, reflected in a process of class struggle. More recent scholars, 
like Stephen Skowronek, have argued that while leadership characteristics are not 
without importance, the most effective and successful leaders in history were so 
because the confluence of historical, situational and political factors allowed, even 
demanded, major change. Wars and crises also tend to produce ‘great’ leaders in 
historical memory. By contrast, many gifted and talented leaders have come to power 
representing ideas whose time had not yet come, or in times where circumstances 
precluded transformative leadership (Skowronek 1993). Sociological factors have 
also provided the basis for the very different idea that political leadership is largely 
a product of collective behaviour. In his seminal The Crowd (1895), Gustav Le Bon 
analysed the dynamics of crowd psychology, arguing that leaders are impelled by the 
collective behaviour of the masses, not the other way round.
An organizational necessity
The third theory of leadership sees it in largely technical terms as a rational, or 
bureaucratic, device. In this view, leadership is essentially an organizational necessity 
that arises from the need for coherence, unity and direction within any complex 
institution. Leadership therefore goes hand in hand with bureaucracy (see p. 409).
Modern large-scale organizations require specialization, which, in turn, gives rise 
to a hierarchy of offices and responsibilities. This bureaucratic leadership conforms 
to what Weber (see p. 87) called legal-rational authority, in that it is essentially 
impersonal and based on formal, usually written, rules. This view was more 
memorably expressed by Robert Michels in Political Parties (1911) in the form of the 
‘iron law of oligarchy’. Michels was a prominent elite theorist, and in analysing the 
power structure of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, he noted that, despite 
the party’s formally democratic organization, power was concentrated in the hands 
of a small group of party leaders. He concluded that any organization or political 
body, once it reached a certain size and complexity, inevitably required a leadership 
class in order to effectively administer it.
The rise of constitutional government has undoubtedly invested political leadership 
with a strongly bureaucratic character by ensuring that power is vested in a political 
office, rather than the individual office-holder. This, nevertheless, conflicts with 
democratic pressures that force political leaders to cultivate charisma and emphasize 
personal qualities in order to win and retain power. However, the media and public 
itself has often driven this trend, as specific leaders tend to become the focus on 
public interest much more that larger, faceless bodies like legislatures and courts. 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_14.indd 366 23-07-2024 12:53:21POLITICAL EXECUTIVES AND LEADERSHIP 367
Even in parliamentary systems where heads of government are not directly elected by 
the people, party leaders and prime-ministerial candidates tend to dominate election 
campaigns and heavily influence voter choices.
A political skill
The final theory of leadership portrays it very much as an artefact; that is, as a 
political skill that can be learned and practised. Political leadership, in this sense, is 
akin to the art of manipulation, a perhaps inevitable feature of democratic politics 
in an age of mass communications. This can be seen most graphically in the cults 
of personality that were constructed to support the dictatorial leaderships of figures 
such as Mao Zedong (see p. 482), Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein. Indeed, 
many of the classic examples of charismatic leadership can, in practice, be seen as 
forms of manufactured leadership. Stalin, for example, bolstered his own popularity 
by building up an elaborate cult of Lenin in the 1920s; he erected statues, renamed 
streets and towns, and placed Lenin’s embalmed body in a mausoleum in Red 
Square. During the 1930s, having carefully linked himself to Lenin’s heritage, Stalin 
transferred this cult to himself. Similarly, Hitler’s performances at the Nuremberg 
rallies were carefully stage-managed by Albert Speer. His every word and gesture were 
carefully rehearsed and choreographed; the whole event was designed to build up 
emotional tension that would be released by Hitler’s appearance. Modern democratic 
politicians have no less strong a need to project themselves and their personal vision, 
though the skills appropriate to the television age tend to be refined and sophisticated 
compared with those suitable for mass rallies and public demonstrations.
CONCEPT
Cult of personality
A cult of personality 
(or cult of leadership) 
is a propaganda device 
through which a political 
leader is portrayed as 
a heroic or God-like 
figure. By treating the 
leader as the source of 
all political wisdom and 
an unfailing judge of 
the national interest, 
the cult implies that 
any form of criticism 
or opposition amounts 
to treachery or lunacy. 
Cults of personality 
have typically been 
developed in totalitarian 
regimes (first by Stalin) 
through the exploitation 
of the possibilities of 
modern means of mass 
communication, and the 
use of state repression 
to cultivate a form of 
ritualized idolatrization.

DEBATING . . .
SHOULD PERSONALIZED LEADERSHIP ALWAYS BE FEARED?
Questions about leadership become particularly controversial when leaders draw less on their office and its formal powers 
and more on their own personal qualities and characteristics. When leadership becomes more an individual rather than an 
institutional phenomenon, does it become sinister or threatening? Or is personalized leadership more meaningful, even 
inspiring, than ‘bureaucratic’ forms of leadership?
YES NO
Recipe for authoritarianism. The fact that, as democracy 
has advanced, political leadership has increasingly been 
‘depersonalized’ (by being subject to constitutional and 
institutional constraints) is no coincidence. When a 
leader’s authority derives more from his or her personality 
than his or her office, government power is apt to be 
abused. This reflects the long-standing concern that, 
as charisma (charm, or the power of personality) is not 
based on formal rules or procedures, potentially, it has 
no limit. In line with Lord Acton’s warning that ‘absolute 
power corrupts absolutely’, leaders may also become 
more greedy, selfish and insensitive to the views of 
others to the extent that they feel they can manipulate 
them (Blaug 2010).
Infantilizing society. Personalized leadership may 
not only affect leaders but also followers, the public 
at large. Charismatic leadership has a near-mystical 
character, operating as it does through the belief that 
leaders possess special, even God-like qualities. As the 
relationship between leader and followers has a quasi￾religious dimension, it generates uncritical loyalty, 
amounting perhaps to devotion. Personalized leaders are 
obeyed not because of what they say or do, but because 
of who they are. The rise of personalized leadership 
therefore infantilizes society, instilling a political passivity 
and unwillingness to engage in questioning, argument and 
debate that is incompatible with a healthy democracy.
Doomed to fail. Leaders who come to power largely 
as a result of personal gifts or qualities tend to be poor 
leaders whose political careers typically end in failure. 
Personalized leaders ‘shine’ in the theatre of politics, 
where their oratorical (and often televisual) skills are 
most in evidence, but their administrative and policy￾making skills may be much less developed. Moreover, 
their capacity to engender optimism and enthusiasm 
may mean that they build up hope and expectation 
to a level that cannot be fulfilled, thereby making 
disappointment inevitable. Finally, when leaders believe 
they can persuade anyone of anything, they become 
susceptible to hubris and self-delusion.
Charisma and democracy. The idea that charismatic 
leadership is irreconcilable with democracy is a gross 
over-statement. While no one would deny that charisma 
continues to be significant in the democratic age, its political 
character has changed fundamentally. Rather than being 
aloof, domineering and bombastic, modern charismatic 
leaders cultivate ‘soft’ qualities, hoping to be liked rather 
than feared and trying to resemble ordinary citizens 
rather than overlords. What is more, however attractive 
a leader’s personality and however fluent and persuasive 
a communicator he or she may be, no modern leader has 
the capacity to use their personal skills to escape from the 
electoral and constitutional constraints of a democratic 
system.
Leadership with a human face. Leadership works only if it 
is personal. Leaders must move us: they must ignite our 
passions and inspire the best in us, and, in the process, help 
us recognize the potential of our society. They do this not 
simply because of the office that they hold, but because 
they are living, breathing human beings, who are capable 
of articulating a narrative that is meaningful precisely 
because it derives from the leader’s life, values and sense 
of vision. Perhaps the foremost attribute of leadership in 
contemporary circumstances is the ability to formulate and, 
most importantly, communicate a message that resonates 
with large sections of the electorate.
Being above politics. Personalized leaders are able to 
distance themselves from the political and institutional 
context that may otherwise define them. This is most 
evident in relation to party politics and the danger that, 
being a party leader, a president or prime minister may 
use their position primarily to advance the interests of 
their party and its associated groups. Whereas party 
leadership entails partisanship, so leading to a one-sided 
approach to politics, personalized leadership opens up the 
possibility of bipartisanship, as the leader is able to rise 
above party divisions and appeal to a wider body of people 
and groups.

Populism and leadership
There is no necessary link between populism (see p. 56) and leadership. Populism 
may coexist with many types of leadership and can even be leaderless. An example of 
leaderless populism can be found in the ‘yellow vests’ (gilets jaunes), the grass-roots 
protest movement that sprang up in 2018 in opposition to the policies of French 
President Emmanuel Macron. Indeed, the belief that the instincts and wishes of the 
people provide the principal legitimate guide to political action suggests support 
for popular self-government, or direct democracy (see p. 100). And yet, in practice, 
most populist movements place a heavy emphasis on political leadership and, 
in the process, endorse a particular style of leadership, sometimes called populist 
leadership. This is because, despite their veneration for the people, populists rarely 
hold that the people can and do speak for themselves. Leadership, usually in the 
form of a single dominant figure, is therefore needed both to give the people a voice 
and to awaken them to their ‘real’ interests. Strictly speaking, populist leaders do not 
portray themselves as representatives of the people, for this would imply speaking 
for, or on behalf of, the people, as a separate, and perhaps superior, entity. Rather, 
populist leaders cast themselves as an integral part of the people, their role, in effect, 
being to create or even embody the people. In this respect, there are parallels between 
populist leadership and the fascist leader principle (discussed earlier in the chapter).
Populist leadership is shaped, in practice, by the phenomenon of ‘anti-politics’ (see 
p. 500) and the claim to offer a new and more ‘authentic’ style of politics. This is 
done in a variety of ways. First, anti-political politicians – such as Marine Le Pen, 
Nigel Farage, Geert Wilders, Narendra Modi, Viktor Orbán and Giorgia Meloni – 
typically cultivate a distinctive, even idiosyncratic, public image, relying as much 
on factors such as mannerisms and personal appearance as on what they say and 
do. The purpose of this is to set them apart from conventional politicians, who for 
some increasingly look the same and sound the same. By being different, they are 
advertising that they are, quite simply, themselves, people who have substance and 
who voters can relate to, rather than the ‘manufactured’ politicians who otherwise 
seem to dominate the political scene. Populism and charisma thus tend to overlap. 
Second, anti-political politicians tend to portray themselves as political ‘outsiders’, 
people who can be trusted because they have not been corrupted by the experience 
of holding senior public office and the compromises which that (perhaps inevitably) 
entails. Third, anti-political politicians stand apart from conventional politicians 
because of their policy or ideological boldness, giving the impression that they are 
motivated by deep convictions and, in particular, believe in something other than just 
advancing their own careers. Fourth, their boldness is also reflected in a willingness 
to court controversy and outrage their opponents, often, in the process, showing a 
wanton disregard for the conventional norms of political interaction.
Donald Trump is often considered to be the archetypal contemporary example of 
a populist leader. However, in his initial forays into politics, Trump placed far too 
much emphasis on ‘selling himself ’ and emphasizing his personal qualities, especially 
as a ‘deal-maker’, to be clearly classified as a populist. It was only from about mid￾2016 onwards, possibly through the influence of Steve Bannon, who assumed control 
of Trump’s presidential bid and later (albeit briefly) served as White House chief 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_14.indd 369 23-07-2024 12:53:22370 POLITICS
strategist, that Trump started to present himself as a ‘vehicle for the people’ and 
embraced an unmistakably populist leadership style. Trump’s success was based on 
the recognition that the brash, self-aggrandizing and almost cartoonish persona that 
he had cultivated in a career as a celebrity businessman and reality TV star could, 
without modification or qualification, provide a basis for a yet more successful 
career in politics. Similarly, he keenly understood that, far from being a drawback, 
his lack of previous political experience was a powerful advantage in an age of anti￾politics. Trump’s strong populist leanings are also evident in his rhetorical style. By 
using short, simple slogans and direct language (a style of address particularly well 
suited to use on social media), Trump ensures readability and simplicity, his anti￾intellectualism making him sound ‘real’ or natural, unlike conventional politicians. 
Finally, Trump has eagerly flouted the rules of political correctness, happily 
adjusting to the view that politics, in essence, is a cultural war (see pp. 220–222). He 
was, perhaps, prepared for this by his early mentor, Roy Cohn, who had served as 
an aide to Senator Joseph McCarthy, during the 1950s. Cohn’s advice to the young 
Donald Trump is reputed to have included: ‘Never settle, never surrender; counter￾attack, counter-sue immediately; claim victory and never admit defeat.’
The Trump presidency proved less effective than his rhetoric, insofar as many of the 
key promises of his election campaign remained unfulfilled at the end of his first 
term. Notable failures included the inability to repeal Obamacare, to boost economic 
growth by 4 per cent annually, to reduce the federal deficit, to lower the prices of 
prescription drugs and to build a southern border wall that Mexico would pay 
for. This is often the case for many populist leaders, as they quickly discover when 
taking office that, as Neustadt argued, their primary power still resides in being the 
‘persuader in chief ’, and they must negotiate and compromise with other branches 
of government and centres of power to achieve policy outcomes. Trump proved a 
poor manager of the federal bureaucracy, soured relations with Congress and many 
in his party, and had a combative relationship with the media, all of which conspired 
to greatly limit his effectiveness in getting his initiatives passed or implemented. 
Populism may therefore provide a route to achieving executive power, but not 
necessarily an effective strategy for wielding it.
Political correctness:
Language, behaviour 
or opinions that are 
supposedly ‘correct’ 
because they comply 
with egalitarian, non￾discriminatory, anti￾authoritarian and other 
standards.

LEGISLATURES
PREVIEW
Legislatures (sometimes called ‘parliaments’ or ‘assemblies’) occupy a central position in the machinery of 
government. Traditionally, they have been treated with special respect and status as the public, even democratic, 
face of government. In written constitutions they are usually accorded pride of place, being described before 
executives and judiciaries. Legislatures are respected because they are composed of lay politicians who claim to 
represent the people, rather than expert government officials. Moreover, they act as national debating chambers, 
public forums in which government policies and the major issues of the day can be openly discussed and analysed. 
In most cases, they are also invested with formal law-making power, giving them some capacity to shape, or at least 
influence, public policy.
Not all legislatures are alike, however. Their role and significance are crucially affected by wider constitutional 
and institutional factors – especially whether they operate within a parliamentary, presidential or semi-presidential 
system – as well as by their internal structures, including whether they comprise two legislative chambers or one. It 
is widely alleged that, since the twentieth century, there has been a progressive weakening of parliamentary power 
reflected in a decline of legislatures relative, in particular, to executives. Although most still play an important role 
in the policy process, some legislatures have been reduced to mere ‘talking shops’ that do little more than rubber￾stamp decisions that have effectively been made elsewhere. Others claim that, for various reasons, recent decades 
have witnessed a revival of legislature power.

ROLE OF LEGISLATURES
In practice, a bewildering variety of terms are used to describe political bodies with 
very similar functions: congress (USA), national assembly (Angola), national diet 
(Japan), parliament (Singapore), general council (Andorra) and so on. These are 
all examples of legislatures, which vary widely in size, composition and structure 
around the world, but at a fundamental level they are all assemblies of people with 
the authority to make law, and whose primary function is to do so.
That said, institutions that are formally classified as legislatures rarely monopolize 
law-making power. For instance, executives possess some ability to make law, 
through devices such as decrees or orders (see p. 353), or administrative rule-making 
(see p. 334). They often also have the capacity to influence, if not shape, the formal 
legislative process. Furthermore, the enactment of law is only one of the functions 
of legislatures, and not necessarily their most important. Legislatures may have 
influence or control over appointments to key positions, may oversee the elections or 
particular state functions, may determine budgets and how money is spent, or may 
have investigative and judicial powers. And regardless of their legislative powers and 
representative features, parliaments are, above all, debating chambers; that is, forums 
in which policies and political issues can be openly discussed and scrutinized. The 
term ‘parliament’ (from the French parler, meaning ‘to speak’) is used by some 
legislatures to reinforce this principle.
Parliamentary, presidential and semi-presidential systems
As noted in Chapter 14, one of the key features of any political system is the 
relationship between the legislature and the government and, therefore, the 
relationship between legislative and executive authority. In exceptional cases, a form 
of ‘legislature government’ may develop in which executive and legislative power 
are vested in the legislature, there being no separate executive body. Such a system, 
for example, emerged briefly under Robespierre and the Jacobins during the French 
Revolution, influenced by the radical democracy of Rousseau (see p. 105). In other 
cases, notably in orthodox communist regimes, both the legislative and the executive 
bodies are often subordinated to the unchallengeable authority of a ‘ruling’ party. 
However, legislature–executive relations more commonly conform to one of three 
institutional arrangements: parliamentary, presidential or semi-presidential systems 
(see Chapters 5 and 14).
Many liberal democracies have adopted some form of parliamentary government 
(see Figure 15.1). These are often Westminster-style systems, in that they are based 
on the model of the UK Parliament. Often portrayed as the ‘mother of parliaments’, 
the origins of the Westminster Parliament can be traced back to the thirteenth 
century, when knights and burgesses were incorporated into the king’s court. During 
the fourteenth century, separate chambers (the House of Commons and the House 
of Lords) were created to represent the knights and burgesses on the one hand, and 
the barons and churchmen on the other. Parliament’s supremacy over the king was, 
nevertheless, not established until the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and its capacity 
to call government to account not recognized until the gradual emergence of a 
democratic franchise during the nineteenth century.
CONCEPT
Parliamentary 
government
A parliamentary system 
of government is one in 
which the government 
governs in and through 
the legislature or 
parliament, thereby 
‘fusing’ the legislative 
and executive branches. 
The chief features 
of a parliamentary 
system are as follows: 
(1) governments are 
formed as a result of 
legislature elections; 
(2) the personnel of 
government are drawn 
from the legislature; 
(3) the government 
rests on the legislature’s 
confidence and can 
be removed if it loses 
that confidence; (4) 
the government can, 
in most cases, ‘dissolve’ 
the legislature; and (5) 
parliamentary executives 
are generally collective.
Legislature: The branch of 
government whose chief 
function is to make laws, 
although it is seldom the 
only body with legislative 
power.

Westminster-style parliamentary systems were adopted by most of the UK’s colonies, 
such as Australia, Jamaica and the Solomon Islands. Other nations, Denmark 
and Italy, for example, independently developed nearly identical systems. Non￾Westminster parliamentary systems have evolved too, including in Germany, 
Ethiopia and Armenia. But the central feature of these systems is a fusion of legislative 
and executive power: government is parliamentary, in that it is drawn from and

The UK House of Commons. Owing to its early adoption of a parliamentary system 
of government, and its once significant colonial empire, many countries use a 
variant of the Westminster system, named for the Palace of Westminster where the 
House of Commons sits.

accountable to the legislature or parliament. The strength of this system is that it 
supposedly delivers effective but responsible government. Government is effective 
in that it rests on the confidence of the legislature and so can, in most cases, ensure 
that its legislative programme is passed. In short, parliamentary executives can get 
things done. However, responsible government is maintained because the executive 
can govern only as long as it retains the confidence of the legislature. In theory, the 
legislature has the upper hand because it has the ultimate power: the ability to remove 
the government.
Unfortunately, parliamentary systems often fail to live up to these high expectations. 
Certainly, there are examples such as Sweden in which, supported by strong norms 
of consultation and partnership, the legislature (the Riksdag) exerts a strong 
policy influence without threatening to immobilize the workings of government. 
However, parliamentary government is often associated with the problem of 
executive domination. This is the case in the UK, where a combination of strict 
party discipline and a disproportional electoral system normally allows government 
to control Parliament through a cohesive and reliable majority in the House of 
Commons. This encouraged Lord Hailsham (1976) to dub UK government an 
‘elective dictatorship’.
Parliamentary systems have also been linked with weak government and political 
instability. This usually occurs when the party system is fractured, and it is often 
associated with highly proportional electoral systems. In the French Fourth 
Republic during 1945–58, for instance, twenty-five governments came and went in 
little over twelve years. During this period, no French government could command 
a stable majority in the National Legislature, in which both the Communists on 
the left and the Gaullists on the right were implacably opposed to the regime 
itself. Similar problems afflicted post-Second World War Italian politics. A 
polarized multi-party system led to the establishment of no fewer than fifty-nine 
governments between 1945 and 2001. Such apparent immobilism may, however, 
be misleading. In Italy, for example, changes in government typically involve a 
reshuffling of ministerial personnel, not a political upheaval, and only occasionally 
result in general elections.
Responsible government:
A government that is 
answerable or accountable 
to an elected legislature 
and, through it, to the 
people.
Elective dictatorship:
An imbalance between 
the executive and the 
legislature that means 
that, once elected, the 
government is only 
constrained by the 
need to win subsequent 
elections.
Immobilism: Political 
paralysis stemming from 
the absence of a strong 
executive, caused by 
multiple divisions in the 
legislature and (probably) 
society.
KEY THINKER
CHARLES-LOUIS DE SECONDAT MONTESQUIEU (1689–1775)
French political philosopher. Montesquieu came from an aristocratic family and became a legal 
advocate and literary figure. After settling in Paris in 1726, he travelled throughout Europe 
studying political and social institutions. Montesquieu’s masterpiece, The Spirit of the Laws (1748), 
is a long and rambling comparative examination of political and legal issues. He championed a 
form of parliamentary liberalism that was based on the writings of Locke (see p. 32) and, to some 
extent, a misreading of English political experience. Montesquieu emphasized the need to resist 
tyranny by fragmenting government power, particularly through the device of the separation of 
powers.

The principal alternative to parliamentary government is a presidential government 
(see Figure 14.1). Presidential systems are based on the strict application of the 
doctrine of the separation of powers (see p. 377), associated with Montesquieu. 
This ensures that the legislatures and executives are formally independent from 
one another and separately elected (see Figure 15.2). The classic example of this is 
found in the USA, where the so-called ‘founding fathers’ were particularly anxious to 
prevent the emergence of an over-strong executive, fearing that the presidency might 
assume the mantle of the British monarchy.
The resulting system therefore incorporated a network of checks and balances. 
Congress, the US presidency and the Supreme Court are separate institutions, in the 
sense that no overlap of personnel is permitted but, nevertheless, possess the ability to 
constrain one another’s power. Thus, while Congress has the ability to make law, the 
president can veto it; but Congress can, in turn, override this veto with a two-thirds 
majority in both houses. In the same way, although the president has the power to 
make senior executive and judicial appointments, these are subject to confirmation 
by the upper house, the Senate. Outside the USA, presidential systems have been 
adopted throughout Latin America, as well as sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia.
There are, however, ‘hybrid’, or semi-presidential, systems as well. They feature a ‘dual 
executive’ in which a separately elected president works in conjunction with a prime 
minister and cabinet drawn from, and responsible to, the legislature. How such a 
system works in practice depends on a delicate balance between, on the one hand, 
the personal authority and popularity of the president and, on the other, the political 
complexion of the legislature. Semi-presidential systems have become more common 
in recent decades, particularly due to their adoption by many post-communist and 
postcolonial states, such as Lithuania, Mauritania and Mozambique. However, 
they range from forms of ‘balanced’ semi-presidentialism, in which the parliament 
exercises effective constraint over the presidency, to forms of ‘asymmetrical’ semi￾presidentialism, in which the parliament lacks independence and is routinely 
controlled by the presidency. In Russia, this imbalance is so severe that the system 
can be described as an example of ‘superpresidentialism’.
The principal virtue of presidential systems is that, by separating legislative power 
from executive power, they create internal tensions that help to protect individual 
rights and liberties. As Hobbes (see p. 65) put it, ‘liberty is power cut into pieces’. In 
the USA, for instance, the danger of executive domination is protected against by the 
range of powers vested in the Congress. Congress has the right to declare war and 
raise taxes, the Senate must ratify treaties and confirm presidential appointments, 
and the two houses can combine to charge and impeach the president. 
Such fragmentation, however, may also have drawbacks. In particular, presidential 
systems may be ineffective and cumbersome because they offer an ‘invitation to 
struggle’ to the executive and legislative branches of government. Critics of the US 
system, for example, argue that, since it allows the president to propose and Congress 
to dispose, it is nothing more than a recipe for ‘government gridlock’. A similar 
problem occurs in semi-presidential systems in the form of cohabitation (see p. 361)
when the president is forced to work with a hostile prime minister and legislature.
Superpresidentialism:
A president-heavy 
constitutional order in 
which the presidency is 
invested with great power 
and the legislature or 
parliament operates as a 
mere ‘rubber stamp’.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_15.indd 376 23-07-2024 12:54:15LEGISLATURES 377
Regardless of whether a system is parliamentary, presidential or semi-presidential, 
though, the power of the legislature relative to the executive is not fixed or always 
easy to discern. The Parliamentary Powers Index, for instance, is an attempt to 
measure how powerful legislatures are within their political systems, based on an 
assessment of the thirty-two formal powers a legislature might hold, such as the 
power to declare war, or the power to appoint the head of government (Fish and 
Kroenig 2011). However, there are often big disparities between the formal and 
informal power a legislature exercises. For example, the parliament of Bangladesh 
scores relatively highly on the Parliamentary Powers Index due to its significant 
formal powers. But its governing rules prohibit members from voting against their 
party, resigning from their party or abstaining for voting – should any member do 
so, they are automatically expelled from parliament. Motions of no confidence to 
dismiss the government are also disallowed. Because Bangladesh has a Westminster 
parliamentary system, where the executive is drawn from the largest party in the 
parliament and the prime minister is also party leader, these rules make it virtually 
impossible for the parliament to act independently of the governing party or to act as 
a meaningful check on it.
Functions of legislatures
To classify legislatures simply as debating chambers or representative bodies obscures 
their true significance. In fact, the serve a variety of roles in political systems, the five 
most common of which include:
 representation
 legislation
 scrutiny
 political recruitment
 legitimacy.
CONCEPT
Separation of 
powers
The separation of 
powers is the principle 
that each of the three 
functions of government 
(legislation, execution 
and adjudication) 
should be entrusted 
to a separate branch 
of government (the 
legislature, the executive 
and the judiciary) 
(see Figure 15.2). Its 
purpose is to fragment 
government power in 
such a way as to defend 
liberty and keep tyranny 
at bay. In its formal 
sense, it demands 
independence, in that 
there should be no 
overlap of personnel 
between the branches. 
However, it also implies 
interdependence, in the 
form of shared powers 
to create a network of 
checks and balances.

Representation
Above all, legislatures provide a link between government and the people, a channel 
of communication that can both support government and help to uphold the regime, 
and force government to respond to public demands and anxieties. In many systems 
they are the ‘voice of the people’ and the only bodies which are directly elected by 
the public.
Historically, the principal purpose of ancient assemblies was to bring together various 
interests to allow for collective decision-making. In ancient Germanic and medieval 
Viking societies, for instance, ‘things’ or ‘moots’ were assemblies of clans and tribes 
that had the power to elect chieftains and make laws. Iceland’s parliament, the Althing, 
is considered to have first met in just such a manner as early as 930 ce. While many 
ancient and medieval assemblies tended to be composed of leaders of powerful clans, 
families or interests, the extension of the franchise and the eventual achievement of 
universal adult suffrage turned legislatures into popular forums, bodies that ‘stood 
for’ the people themselves. For this reason, the power of a legislature within the 
political system is usually seen as an important index of democratic government.
Representation (see p. 243) is a complex principle that has a number of contrasting 
implications. For example, Westminster-style parliamentary systems based on UK 
traditions have often portrayed representatives as trustees whose prime responsibility 
is to exercise their own judgement and wisdom on behalf of their constituents. 
However, this Burkean notion of representatives as independent actors conflicts 
sharply with the strict party discipline now found in most legislatures, particularly 
those in parliamentary systems. The alternative theory of representation, the doctrine 
of the mandate (see p. 247), views parties, not legislatures, as the central mechanism 
through which representation takes place.
In other states, the idea of constituency representation takes pride of place. This 
applies particularly to the US Congress, as a result of its relatively weak party system 
and the unusually short two-year terms of Representatives. The primary concern of 
both Representatives and Senators is to be advocates for their districts and states by 
passing laws and budgets that serve their constituents’ interests. Congress is therefore 
commonly dominated by what is called ‘pork barrel politics’, in which budgets 
and legislation might include significant concessions designed to win over specific 
districts or states. However, it is the very effectiveness of Congress in serving this 
representative function that undermines its role as a policymaker, as policies for the 
good of the nation as a whole can sometimes be inimical to the interests of individual 
districts or states. If every member chooses to act only from the perspective of 
their own constituents, it can be very difficult to design legislation that can achieve 
majority support.
This dilemma is often revealed on so-called ‘not in my back yard’ or NIMBY issues. 
Airports, for instance, are essential to the modern economy and benefit the entire 
nation, but they also create a great deal of noise, traffic and pollution that is unpleasant 
for any nearby residents. No one wants to live near an airport, and any legislator 
would be expected by their constituents to oppose airports being built or expanded 
in their districts. But airports must go somewhere, and legislatures have an obligation 
to make necessary, if difficult, decisions that represent the best interests of the nation. 
Pork barrel politics:
Government projects 
whose only, or primary, 
purpose is to bring 
money or jobs to a 
representative’s district or 
constituency.

Legislatures must then always reconcile a tension between the narrow interests of 
constituencies, and the broader interests of the nation they are elected to serve.
In the USSR and other communist states, in the absence of electoral choice and party 
competition, representation was often based on the degree to which legislatures 
resembled the larger society. The Supreme Soviet thus came far closer to being a 
microcosm of Soviet society (in terms of gender, nationality, occupation and so 
on) than legislatures in the developed West have ever done. Such a concern with 
descriptive representation continues to apply to China’s National People’s Congress, 
the largest parliament in the world, where attempts are made to ensure consistent 
levels of female and ethnic-minority representation.
Legislation
Making law is often seen as the key function of legislatures. Legislatures are typically 
vested with authoritative and binding law-making powers that make them on many 
matters the highest decision-making body in a political system. Legislatures in most 
cases are designed to be deliberative bodies in which proposed laws can be discussed, 
debated and amended by representatives of the people.
As pointed out, legislatures rarely monopolize legislative authority. Constitutional 
law is usually placed beyond the competence of the legislature. In Ireland, for 
example, the constitution is amended by referendums and, in Belgium, by special 
constitutional conventions. Executive officers, such as the French president, are 
often able to make law by decree, or, like the US president, can veto laws when they 
have been passed. And rule-making by the executive and bureaucracy (see p. 409)
constitutes the development of secondary law which, in many ways, may be far more 
influential and beyond the scrutiny of the legislature.
More significantly, legislatures often exercise little positive legislative power. The 
right of initiative is the power to propose a bill in a legislature and have it debated, 
and systems vary in who has this right. Furthermore, in nearly all states legislative 
proposals and programmes emanate, in the main, from the executive, which has 
the organizational coherence and access to specialist advice and information 
necessary for policy formulation. In parliamentary systems, because the government 
is drawn from the legislature, it also by default leads the parliament and manages 
its business. Non-government bills may be proposed by other members (known as 
private member’s bills in Westminster systems), but these are usually debated only 
if the government is prepared to make time for them alongside its own legislative 
programme.
In presidential and semi-presidential systems, the executive may or may not have 
the right of initiative, but in most such systems the executive still coordinates closely 
with their allies in the legislature to control the legislative agenda. Approximately 80 
per cent of the legislation considered by the US Congress, for example, stems from 
presidential initiatives. Usually only in situations where opposing parties control 
the executive and legislature, or significant disagreements emerge between the two 
branches, will legislatures attempt to take control of the legislative agenda.

The negative legislative power of legislatures – that is, their ability to reject or 
amend proposed laws – is usually more potent, particularly in presidential or semi￾presidential systems where the executive does not necessarily command a legislative 
majority. In Mexico, for instance, in recent decades the president’s party has rarely 
commanded a majority in the legislature, frustrating the executive’s policy agenda. 
As Mexican President Vicente Fox, whose signature tax reform bills were voted down 
three years in a row, noted, ‘the President will propose, and the Congress will dispose’. 
Depending on their governing rules, legislatures may also have significant powers to 
determine if, how and when a bill is considered, especially if the executive does not 
have a right of initiative.
Alternatively, legislatures may choose to amend and refine government proposals 
in sometimes significant ways. In cases such as the Dutch States-General, up to half 
of all legislative measures are significantly redrafted as a result of parliamentary 
consultations. Budgets, particularly in presidential systems, tend be subject to 
significant negotiation and amendment by the legislature to secure passage. 
Once more, however, this proclivity varies from system to system. In the UK, for 
instance, government defeats in the House of Commons are usually rare events, 
and amendments in the House of Commons or House of Lords are not especially 
common.
Scrutiny and oversight
Perhaps because of their greater negative powers, many legislatures have increasingly 
become scrutinizing bodies, the principal role of which is to deliver responsibility 
(see p. 381) or accountability, and to provide checks and constraints on executive 
power. Most legislatures have developed institutional mechanisms designed to 
facilitate this role. Parliamentary systems, for example, usually subject ministers to 
regular oral or written questioning, the classic example being ‘question time’ in many 
Westminster systems. This allows the prime minister to be cross-examined once a 
week, and subjects other senior ministers to similar scrutiny about once a month. 
Germany and Finland use the practice of ‘interpellation’, a process of oral questioning 
followed by a vote to establish the confidence of the legislature in the answers given.
Since questioning and debate on the floor of a chamber inevitably tend to be 
generalized, much of the scrutinizing work of legislatures is carried out by committees 
set up for this purpose. The powerful standing committees of the US Congress have 
served as a model for many other legislatures in this respect. Committees tend to 
develop specialization over time, allowing more sophisticated scrutiny than can be 
provided by the legislature as a whole. Most legislatures have public accounts or 
expenditure committees for instance, whose job it is to analyse bills in terms of costs 
to the nation and impact on the economy. Such committees are usually chaired by 
experienced legislators, and have large professional staffs attached to them, allowing 
them to provide detailed and often influential recommendations.
However, legislatures are not always effective in calling executives to account. For 
instance, it can be argued that, in Westminster-style systems, the principal function 
of the legislature is to uphold and support government, since the majority of the 
members of the legislature belong to the governing party. The job of scrutiny thus

passes to the opposition parties, which, as long as the government retains majority 
control, have no power to remove it.
A further key factor is the ability of the legislature to extract information from the 
executive. Knowledge is power; without full and accurate information, meaningful 
scrutiny is impossible. Oversight of the executive requires that parliamentary 
representatives have meaningful investigative powers, and also be well resourced 
and have access to research services and expert advice. Here, the contrast is 
dramatic internationally. US Congressional committees have significant powers to 
subpoena documents and compel the testimony of witnesses and officials during 
its investigations, and have large, independent, well-funded staffs attached to their 
operations. The standing committee of Vietnam’s National Assembly by contrast has 
almost no power or resources to conduct independent investigations and largely 
reviews only what the ruling party provides it.
Recruitment and training
Legislatures often act as major channels of recruitment, providing a pool of talent 
from which decision-makers emerge. This applies less in authoritarian states, where 
rubber-stamp legislatures seldom attract serious politicians. In parliamentary 
systems, however, service in the legislature is a required career path for ministers 
and prime ministers, who then continue to hold their legislature seats alongside their 
executive offices. And in presidential systems, many candidates for executive office

CONCEPT
Responsibility
Responsibility can be 
understood in two 
contrasting ways. First, 
it means to act in a 
sensible, reasonable, 
or morally correct 
fashion. A government 
may, thus, claim to 
be ‘responsible’ when 
it resists electoral 
pressures and risks 
unpopularity by pursuing 
policies designed to 
meet long-term public 
interests. Second, 
responsibility means 
accountability or 
answerability. This 
implies the existence 
of a higher authority 
to which an individual 
or body is subject, 
and by which it can be 
controlled. Government 
is ‘responsible’ in this 
sense, if its actions are 
open to scrutiny and 
criticism, particularly by 
the legislature.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_15.indd 381 23-07-2024 12:54:16382 POLITICS
gain political exposure through service in the legislature. Thus legislatures recruit 
and train the next generation of political leaders, thus giving them experience of 
political debate and policy analysis.
On the other hand, legislatures can also be inadequate in this respect. 
Parliamentarians certainly gain experience of politics as rhetoric, or what is 
derogatorily known as ‘speechifying’, but they have few opportunities to acquire 
the bureaucratic and managerial skills required to run government departments 
and oversee the process of policy formulation. Moreover, it is sometimes argued 
that legislatures ‘corrupt’ politicians by socializing them into norms and values that 
distance them from the needs of their constituents and the instincts of grass-roots 
party workers. Parliamentary socialists, for example, may thus come to subscribe 
more passionately to the ideals of parliamentarianism than they do to the principles 
of socialism (Miliband 1972). In election campaigns, the importance of ‘governing’ 
or executive experience is sometimes raised, with some voters preferring mayors, 
governors, businesspeople or ministers over those with purely legislative experience.
Legitimacy
The final function of legislatures is to promote the legitimacy (see Chapter 4) of a 
regime by encouraging the public to see the system of rule as ‘rightful’. This is why 
most authoritarian and even totalitarian states tolerate legislatures; though, of 
course, those that have no legislative independence or policy-making power. The 
ability of legislatures to mobilize consent depends largely on their ability to function 
as popular conventions, endorsing laws and policies in the name of the public, as 
well as in their interest. In addition to having propaganda value, legislatures may 
also perform more creditable educational functions. Parliamentary debates can help 
to inform and instruct citizens about the affairs of government and the major issues 
of the day. Examples of this in the case of the UK House of Commons include the 
impassioned ten-hour debate in 2015 on the UK’s membership of an international 
coalition conducting air strikes against Islamist militants in Syria, and the debate in 
April 2018 which helped to expose the so-called Windrush scandal, the mistreatment 
of thousands of migrants who arrived in the UK after the Second World War, some of 
them aboard the ship, Empire Windrush.
To a growing extent, however, the propaganda/educational role of legislatures 
has been taken over by the mass media (see Chapter 9). The rise of the electronic 
media in the form of radio and television, and more recently of digital media, and 
in particular social media (see Chapter 9), has given government direct access to 
literally millions of voters, instead of having, as before, to rely on the reporting of 
parliamentary debates and discussions. As a result, the status that legislatures enjoy 
increasingly depends less on their constitutional position and more on the media 
attention they receive. This helps to explain why legislatures have been increasingly 
anxious for their proceedings to receive television coverage. The public impact of 
US congressional committees has long been enhanced by the televising of their 
hearings, particularly after the launch the dedicated cable channel C-SPAN, with 
surges in viewership during high-profile events like the impeachment of Bill Clinton 
in 1998.
Rhetoric: The art of using 
language to persuade or 
influence; rhetoric can 
imply high-sounding 
but essentially vacuous 
speech.

STRUCTURE OF LEGISLATURES
Structurally, legislatures vary widely in their design and features. Size differences are 
readily apparent. The tiny republic of Nauru has a parliament of eighteen members, 
each of whom represents approximately 518 people. At the other extreme, there is the 
almost 3,000-member National People’s Congress in China, in which one member 
represents over 465,000 people. Legislators maybe be elected or appointed, or they 
may contain both elected and appointed members. When members are elected, this 
may be on the basis of population (in the form of equal-sized constituencies), as 
representatives of regions or states. The franchise may be restricted or universal, and 
various electoral systems may be used (see Chapter 10).
However, the principal structural differences between legislatures are whether they 
comprise one chamber or two, and the nature and role of their committee systems.
Unicameralism or bicameralism?
Although Yugoslavia once experimented with a five-chamber legislature and South 
Africa, Iceland and Taiwan have previously used three-chamber legislatures, all 
current national legislatures have either one or two chambers. Single-chamber, or 
unicameral, legislatures have been common in much of Africa, in communist states 
such as China, and in post-communist states that have maintained an earlier tradition 
of unicameralism. Indeed, there has been a clear trend towards unicameralism in 
the post-Second World War period. For instance, in 1948, Israel established a single￾chamber parliament (the Knesset), and second chambers were abolished in New 
Zealand (1950), Denmark (1953), Sweden (1970), Iceland (1990) and Estonia (1992), 
although Morocco (1996) moved in the opposite direction. Such developments support 
the view that unicameral legislatures are more streamlined and effective than bicameral 
ones, especially in terms of responding to the needs of small and relatively cohesive 
societies. In the famous remark of the Abbé Sieyès in 1789: ‘if the second Chamber 
agrees with the first it is unnecessary; if it disagrees it is pernicious’. Nevertheless, just 
under half the world’s states retain two-chamber, or bicameral, legislatures (see p. 386).
In states where differing interests or constituencies require separate representation 
and power over the legislative process, multiple legislative chambers have historically 
been one solution. Many medieval European assemblies, like the Portuguese Cortes, 
were organized into ‘estates’ that represented the social classes, usually the clergy, the 
nobility and the commoners. Several bicameral legislatures today have their origins 
in this tradition, most notably the UK’s House of Lords.
Another motivation for a second chamber has been as a house of review. This was the 
case in the debates amongst the ‘founding fathers’ who drew up the US constitution 
in 1787. Delegates such as James Madison (see p. 384) saw the US Senate as a means 
of fragmenting legislative power and as a safeguard against executive domination, 
but also as a place where cooler heads would prevail. Appointed by state legislatures 
(rather than elected) and with longer terms of office, the Senate was intended to be 
counterbalance against the democratic passions of the House of Representatives and 
to provide experience and wisdom to the legislative process. Ireland’s upper house 
even more explicitly attempts to achieve this goal by requiring experts in areas like 
agriculture, industry and labour to be nominated to it.
Unicameralism: The 
principle or practice of 
having an legislature 
composed of a single 
legislative chamber.
Bicameralism: The 
principle or practice of 
fragmenting legislative 
power through the 
establishment of two 
(in theory, co-equal) 
chambers in the 
legislature.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_15.indd 383 23-07-2024 12:54:16384 POLITICS
Bicameralism is also important in federal states, where the sharing of sovereignty 
creates a constant danger of irreconcilable conflict between the centre and the 
periphery. All of the world’s sixteen fully federal states thus have bicameral 
legislatures, and in fourteen of them the second chamber represents the provinces or 
component states. These may enjoy equal representation, as in Australia, Switzerland 
and the USA, or they may be represented according to the size of their populations, 
as in Austria and Germany. Second chambers in some non-federal states are also 
used to achieve regional or ethnical representation. In France, most members of the 
second chamber, and in the Netherlands all members, are elected indirectly via local 
governments. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the upper house is equally split amongst 
the three major ethnicities in the country.
Most second chambers are constitutionally and politically subordinate to first 
chambers, which are usually seen as the locus of popular authority. This is particularly 
the case in parliamentary systems, in which government is generally responsible to 
and drawn, largely or wholly, from the lower house. In Norway, the Netherlands and 
Fiji, all bills must be introduced in the first chamber, as is the case with budgetary 
bills in India, Canada and the UK. Second chambers may also be denied veto powers. 
The Japanese first chamber, the House of Representatives, is thus able, by a two-thirds 
majority, to override the House of Counsellors. Not uncommonly, such weaker 
versions of bicameralism reflect the restricted representative basis of the upper house.
A stronger version of bicameralism is found in legislatures with two chambers that 
have broadly equal powers. The Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate, 
for example, are both elected by universal adult suffrage, and are legislatively co￾equal. An electoral college representing both chambers elects the president, and the 
prime minister and council of ministers are collectively responsible to the whole 
legislature.
One of the greatest drawbacks of legislative fragmentation is the possibility of 
conflict between the two chambers. When the houses have broadly equal powers, 
a device is needed to resolve differences and prevent institutional immobilism. 
The most common mechanism is that used in the US Congress, in which a special

of 1787, Madison was a strong proponent of US nationalism and a keen advocate of ratification. 
He later served as Jefferson’s Secretary of State (1801–9) and was the fourth president 
of the USA (1809–17). Usually regarded as a leading supporter of pluralism and divided 
government, Madison urged the adoption of federalism, bicameralism and the separation of 
powers. However, when in government, he was prepared to strengthen the power of national 
government. His best-known political writings are his contributions, with Alexander Hamilton 
and John Jay, to The Federalist Papers (Hamilton et al. 1787–9).

joint congressional committee, composed of senior figures from both chambers, is 
authorized to produce a compromise agreement. In Germany, although the lower 
chamber (the Bundestag) is, in most cases, legislatively dominant, the upper chamber 
(the Bundesrat) enjoys considerable veto powers in relation to constitutional 
questions and matters related to the Länder. When disputes occur, they are referred 
to a joint Bundestag–Bundesrat conciliation committee, the members of which are 
drawn from the two chambers in equal proportions.
Committee systems
Almost all legislatures have a committee system of some sort. Indeed, the trend 
towards the use of committees, in legislatures and elsewhere, is often seen as one 
of the distinctive features of modern politics. Committee systems have increasingly 
been portrayed as the powerhouses of legislatures, the very hub of the legislative 
process; whereas parliamentary chambers are for talking, committees are for 
working. As Woodrow Wilson (1885) put it: ‘Congressional government is committee 
government. Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition. Congress in its 
committee-rooms is Congress at work.’ It is therefore not surprising that legislatures 
are often classified according to their committees. In crude terms, strong legislatures 
have strong committees, and weak legislatures have weak committees.
Legislature committees usually have one of three functions. First, they may carry 
out detailed consideration of legislative measures and financial proposals. They thus 
not only help to relieve the legislative burden on chambers, but also engage in more 
thorough and exacting examination than is possible on the floor of a house. This task 
is usually carried out by standing committees, which may be broad and flexible, as Source: Xinhua/Alamy Stock Photo

systems, in Fiji all proposed legislation (bills) must be introduced in the first 
chamber.

DEBATING . . .
ARE TWO LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS BETTER THAN ONE?
Although there is wide agreement that legislatures play a vital role in upholding democracy and accountable government, 
there is considerable disagreement about whether these tasks are better discharged by bicameral legislatures or unicameral 
ones. Do second chambers protect political freedom and strengthen links between government and the people? Or do 
they merely get in the way, increasing the chances of legislative stalemate and political stagnation?
YES NO
Stronger checks and balances. The key advantage of 
having a second legislative chamber, or upper house, 
is that it serves as a check on both the first chamber 
and the government of the day. Bicameralism thus 
acknowledges that the best way of preventing 
government tyranny is through a system of fragmented 
government, making power a check on power. A 
fragmented legislature disperses legislative power and 
prevents the domination of a single chamber or, in 
practice, of the majority party or parties within that 
chamber. More importantly, fragmented legislatures 
enhance executive oversight because two chambers, 
not one, are charged with responsibility for exposing the 
flaws and failings of government.
Wider representation. So long as they are elected, 
second chambers establish stronger channels of 
communication between government and the people. 
The role of second chambers in providing representation 
for constituent provinces or states in federal systems, 
or in countries that are geographically expansive and 
possess large populations, is generally acknowledged. 
Bicameral legislatures, nevertheless, bring wider 
representative benefits. By using different electoral 
systems, the two chambers can articulate a different 
range of views and interests; by adopting different 
electoral terms, elections are held more frequently and 
government becomes more responsive. Indeed, such 
considerations may be becoming increasingly pressing 
as society itself becomes more diverse.
Better legislation. Second chambers ensure that 
legislation is more thoroughly scrutinized, while also 
relieving the legislative burden on the first chamber 
and rectifying its mistakes and oversights. Although this 
makes the legislative process longer and more complex, 
it greatly improves the quality of the resulting legislation. 
This applies even in cases of weak or asymmetrical 
bicameralism, where second chambers often operate as 
‘revising chambers’, using their expertise and experience 
to deal with legislative details that first chambers, more 
concerned about broad principles, tend to neglect.
Recipe for institutional conflict. Bicameral legislatures 
often result in government gridlock. Fragmenting legislative 
power can simply lead to delays and disagreement, especially 
as the two chambers are, of necessity, composed in different 
ways and, therefore, have different political complexions. In 
contrast, unicameral legislatures are more streamlined and 
efficient. Moreover, when bicameral legislatures are gripped 
by inter-chamber conflict, there is no guarantee that this 
will produce better-considered outcomes; instead, conflicts 
are typically resolved by joint committees, significantly 
narrowing access to policy-making. At a larger level, a 
strong second chamber may simply make the legislature 
over-powerful, leading to government immobilism and 
political stagnation.
Reduced accountability. The great advantage of a 
unicameral legislature is that legislators cannot blame the 
other chamber if legislation fails to pass, or if it proves to 
be unpopular. When some or all members of the second 
chamber are non-elected or indirectly elected, by 
challenging the first chamber, democratic accountability 
is weakened. When second chambers are fully elected this 
merely creates confusion about the location of democratic 
authority. Ultimately, public accountability requires that, 
over the major issues of the day, in particular, a single view 
is expressed that claims to represent the national interest. 
This can only be done if the legislature is a single, coherent 
body, comprising a single chamber.
Conservative bias. Second chambers often tip the balance 
within political systems in favour of conservatism and 
against radical change. For instance, as second chambers 
are often seen, formally or informally, as custodians of 
the constitution, they are typically circumspect about 
proposals for constitutional reform. Second chambers are 
also often composed of members of the political and social 
establishment. This occurs when, through appointment or 
indirect election, their members are drawn from the ranks 
of senior figures in politics, business, the academic world 
and public life generally.

in the UK and France, or permanent and highly specialized, as in Germany and the 
USA. Second, committees may be set up to scrutinize government administration 
and oversee the exercise of executive power. Such committees must be permanent 
and specialized, because, to be effective, they have to rival the executive in terms 
of detailed knowledge and expertise. In the US Congress, for example, legislative 
and scrutinizing responsibilities are vested in standing committees, whereas, in the 
UK Parliament and the French National Legislature, separate departmental select 
or supervisory committees are set up. Third, ad hoc committees may investigate 
matters of public concern. These may have extraordinary powers to investigate 
issues, subpoena witnesses or even recommend charges. Some of the most important 
examples of investigatory committees have been found in the USA, most notably the 
Senate Watergate Committee, which held hearings and gathered evidence that led 
to the resignation of President Richard Nixon and indictment of several dozen aides 
and officials in his administration.
FOCUS ON . . . 
COMMITTEES: ADVANTAGES AND 
DISADVANTAGES
A committee is a small work group composed of members drawn from a larger body and 
charged with specific responsibilities. Whereas ad hoc committees are set up for a particular 
purpose and disbanded when that task is complete, permanent or standing committees have 
enduring responsibilities and an institutionalized role. Committee structures have become 
increasingly prominent in legislative and executive branches of government, as deliberative 
and consultative forums and also as decision-making bodies.
Amongst the advantages of committees are the following:
 They allow a range of views, opinions and interests to be represented.
 They provide the opportunity for fuller, longer and more detailed debate.
 They encourage decisions to be made more efficiently and speedily by restricting the range 
of opposing opinions.
 They make possible a division of labour that encourages the accumulation of expertise and 
specialist knowledge.
However, committees have been criticized for the following reasons:
 They can easily be manipulated by those who set up and staff them.
 They encourage centralization by allowing a chairperson to dominate proceedings behind a 
mask of consultation.
 They narrow the range of views and interests that are taken into account in decision￾making.
 They divorce their members from the larger body, creating a form of sham representation
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_15.indd 387 23-07-2024 12:54:17388 POLITICS
If powerful committees mean a powerful legislature, what makes committees 
powerful? It is generally agreed that the US Congress has the most powerful 
committees found anywhere in the world, and these provide a model that many other 
legislatures have tried to adopt. Their power certainly stems from their specialist 
responsibilities, permanent membership and lavish support in terms of funding and 
access to information. This allows them to match the expertise of the bureaucracy 
(see p. 409). Moreover, their role in the legislative process is crucial. Whereas in the 
UK, France and Japan bills reach committees having been debated and approved in 
principle by the floor of the house, in Congress, committee scrutiny comes first. This 
means that many bills are completely redrafted, and others never see the light of day.
The strength and independence of legislative committees rests in part on the relative 
independence of the legislature from the executive, and the relative independence of 
legislators from their parties. In systems where the government commands a majority 
in the legislature, and/or party discipline is strict, as it is in many Westminster systems 
like Canada and New Zealand, then the committees are likely to reflect the interests 
of governing party. Resourcing is also critical. The National Assembly of Zambia is 
unusual insofar as the budget for its operations is controlled by the executive and 
it has fewer full-time staff supporting its operations than it has members. While its 
eighteen committees have nominally broad powers, in practice they have limited 
information, resources or time through which to exercise them. In an attempt to 
strengthen Parliament in the UK against the executive, a system of departmental 
select committees was established in 1979. These were consciously modelled on the 
US example, and the system sought to promote open government by allowing for 
the examination of government papers and the cross-examination of ministers and 
senior civil servants. It was hoped that these committees would become effective 
watchdogs that would be capable of influencing government policy. However, the 
experiment has proved disappointing, for a number of reasons. First, the hoped-for 
less partisan character of committees has failed to materialize, as the government has 
ensured that party disciplines intrude into the work of committees. Second, the select 
committees are inadequately resourced and have limited powers. Although they can 
send for ‘persons, papers and records’, they cannot force particular civil servants 
or ministers to attend; nor can they ensure that their questions are fully answered. 
Third, no alternative career structure has developed around the committees; MPs still 
look to advance their careers through jobs in government, and so tend to be more 
sensitive to party pressures than parliamentary ones.
PERFORMANCE OF LEGISLATURES
Do legislatures make policy?
The difficulty with assessing the performance of legislatures is that they carry out 
such a wide range of functions. Should they be judged on the quantity or quality 
of the legislation they pass, their effectiveness in mobilizing consent, the degree to 
which they represent public opinion or what? The greatest political concern, however, 
relates to the policy impact of legislatures; that is, their capacity to shape, or at least 
influence, what governments actually do. Do legislatures have power, in the sense

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
URUGUAY: A MODEL LEGISLATURE FOR PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEMS?
With some of the highest scores on international 
democracy indices, Uruguay has in recent decades 
garnered a reputation as one of the most functional and 
open democracies in Latin America. That reputation stems 
in no small part from its legislature, the General Assembly, 
which plays an active and balanced role in Uruguayan 
politics and has several noteworthy features that have 
attracted scholarly attention.
Modelled on the United States, Uruguay’s political system 
is fully presidential with a separated bicameral legislature. 
Unlike the American system, however, Uruguay elects its 
legislators using proportional representation, which means 
that the president’s party is unlikely to achieve an outright 
majority in either chamber of the assembly. Even if they 
do, however, the major parties of Uruguay are marked by 
well-defined factions with distinct leaders and agendas. 
This has encouraged presidents to try and construct what 
Cox and McCubbin (2007) have described as a ‘legislative 
cartel’ – strategic alliances and relationships that allow 
the president to control the policy agenda through the 
legislature. This is usually achieved through the president 
building his cabinet to balance the factions of their party 
in the legislature, or sometimes, coalitions of parties, to 
help create a consensus on a policy agenda. Some cabinet 
coalitions have been very broad – President Luis Lacalle 
Pou’s cabinet in 2020 included representatives of every 
party but one in the assembly. Because Uruguay presidents 
are limited to single five-year terms, and legislators of 
both houses also serve five-year terms and are elected 
simultaneously, there are no ‘mid-term’ elections and thus 
no incentive for the president to campaign during their 
term. The president is stuck with the assembly as elected 
for the term, so to achieve any of their agenda, they will 
have to work with it.
As the assembly has traditionally not been shy about 
asserting its prerogatives, the necessity of this strategy 
has been borne out, and presidents who have attempted 
a more forceful or single-minded route have been far 
less successful at advancing their agenda. Moreover, 
the Uruguay Constitution allows for a special chamber 
of the legislature consisting of four senators and seven 
representatives – the Permanent Commission – to 
operate and discharge the duties of the legislature while the 
main bodies are in recess. This means, unlike many states, 
the legislature of Uruguay is always ‘in session’, disallowing 
some of the tactics used in presidential systems like the 
United States during recesses to avoid congressional rules 
or scrutiny.
Another feature of the Uruguayan system that has 
attracted interest is with budgetary bills. Unlike most 
political systems, in Uruguay it is the president who has 
the sole power to propose budgets, and the legislature is 
constitutionally unable to offer amendments – it must 
simply vote it up or down. And if it does not act within 
120 days, the budget is automatically accepted. And even 
more uniquely, Uruguayan budget bills authorize spending 
for five years. While such a feature might seem to hand 
significant power to the executive, it also removes one 
of the most common sources of deadlock in some other 
presidential systems and diminishes incentives for pork 
barrelling (see p. 378) to secure legislator support.
The Uruguayan Assembly is also amongst the better 
organized to scrutinize legislation and government actions. 
It features a strong, well-resourced committee system 
like the United States, and a legislative library to support 
its operations that is one of the largest in Latin America. 
Also attached to the legislature is a special ombudsman 
and institute whose purpose is to analyse all proposed bills 
to ensure compliance with international and domestic 
human rights laws. Its committee system reflects the 
factional and party make-up of the assembly, thus further 
incentivizing relationship-building between the executive 
and legislature, particularly with factions with control over 
committees crucial to the president’s agenda.

that they affect the content of public policy, or are they merely talking shops that 
draw attention away from where the real business of government happens?
The key issue here is the nature of legislature–executive relations and the distribution 
of power between the two major branches of government. On this basis, the 
legislatures of the world can be classified into three broad categories:
 policy-making legislatures, which enjoy significant autonomy and have an active 
impact on policy
 policy-influencing legislatures, which can transform policy but only by reacting 
to executive initiatives
 executive-dominated legislatures, which exert marginal influence or merely 
rubber-stamp executive decisions.
Policy-making legislatures are rare. To exert a positive influence on the policy 
process, a legislature has to fulfil three criteria. First, it must command significant 
constitutional authority and respect. Second, it must enjoy meaningful political 
independence from the executive, and, third, it must possess sufficient organizational 
coherence and institutional leadership to undertake concerted action. In the modern 
period, the best-known example of a policy-making legislature is the US Congress. 
Congress is perhaps unique in that it enjoys an unusual combination of advantages. 
The separation of powers invests Congress with constitutional independence and an 
impressive range of autonomous powers. Relatively weak party cohesion deprives 
the president of the usual means of exerting legislative control, and Congress may, 
anyway, be controlled by the opposition party. A powerful committee system 
guarantees the organizational effectiveness of Congress. Finally, Congress has had the 
staffing and informational resources to operate without depending on the executive 
branch for assistance. Congress was considered the more dominant branch of the US 
government through much of the nineteenth century, and legislative leaders of the era 
like Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster were more influential than even 
presidents. However, Congress’s power has waned in the modern period, particularly 
amidst the rise of the imperial presidency (see p. 352), though it has periodically 
seized the initiative since then. The most striking example of Congress seizing control 
of public policy occurred after the 1994 elections, when the Republican Congress, 
led by the then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, pushed through a radical 
programme of tax and spending cuts under the slogan ‘Contract with America’ that 
ran counter to the policy agenda of Democratic President Bill Clinton.
Another metric of a policy-making legislature is to consider the proposal and success 
of non-government bills. While rare in most legislatures, there some exceptions. Since 
2000, for example, more than 5,000 private member bills have been introduced in the 
Portuguese Assembly, and more than 1,000 have become law. Non-government bills 
Naturally, like any political system, both branches have 
waxed and waned in power relative to each other to 
some degree in different periods. However, compared 
to the highly adversarial and sometimes dysfunctional 
legislative-executive relations witnessed in other Latin 
American countries in recent decades, Uruguay stands 
out as a successful model that has helped democratic and 
consensus-oriented government flourish.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_15.indd 390 23-07-2024 12:54:17LEGISLATURES 391
are also common in Israel, Austria and Belgium. But even in systems where private 
bills are rare, they can still have a very significant policy impact. For example, in 2013 
the New Zealand Parliament legalized gay marriage through a private member’s bill 
over the wishes of most government MPs.
That said, legislatures have traditionally played a policy-influencing role, rather than 
one of outright policy-making. Where exceptions have occurred, this has usually 
been a consequence of weak coalition government and a fragmented party system. 
More commonly, legislature–executive relations are structured by party divisions. 
This is most clearly the case when majoritarian or weakly proportional electoral 
systems invest a single party with majority control of the legislature (Olson 1994). 
In such cases, the central dynamic of the parliamentary system is an antagonistic 
relationship between the government and the opposition, usually termed ‘adversary 
politics’. Government governs in the sense that it is responsible for formulating, and 
later implementing, a legislative programme, while the opposition and legislature 
more broadly plays an essentially reactive role.
The scope that the legislature has to influence policy in these circumstances depends 
largely the strength in the legislature of the governing party and the party’s ability 
to maintain internal unity. In situations where the government has only a narrow 
majority in the legislature, there is greater scope for factions within the party (see p.
284) or even backbenchers to wrest concessions from the government in formulating 
policy. And in bicameral parliaments, government is not always assured a majority 
in the upper house. Since the introduction of the single transferable vote in 1949 
(see p. 262), Australian governments have seldom commanded a majority in the 
Senate, Australia’s upper house, requiring nearly all governments to negotiate with 
minor parties or the opposition in order to pass legislation through both chambers. 
As a result, even very small parties in the Australian Senate have an opportunity to 
significantly shape budgets, policy and law. The influence can be even larger in multi￾party systems, where the government typically will not command a majority in the 
FOCUS ON . . . 
ADVERSARY POLITICS: FOR OR AGAINST?
Adversary politics is a style of politics characterized by an antagonistic relationship between 
major parties that turns political life into an ongoing electoral battle. Parliamentary debate thus 
becomes a ‘continuous polemic’ before what is seen as the ‘bar of public opinion’.
Adversarialism has been defended on the following grounds:
 It offers voters clear alternatives, thus promoting electoral choice and democratic 
accountability.
 It checks government power by ensuring that there is opposition and scrutiny.
Its dangers, nevertheless, include the following:
 It discourages sober and rational debate, and precludes compromise.
 It fosters polarization, which, as governments change, gives rise to political instability.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_15.indd 391 23-07-2024 12:54:17392 POLITICS
legislature and will rule through a cabinet coalition. Such systems encourage and 
necessitate negotiation and compromise, rather than adversarial politics. Legislatures 
that typically exert a strong influence on policy in this way are the German Bundestag, 
the Norwegian Storting and the Swedish Riksdag.
Systems that have become accustomed to prolonged domination by a single 
party often have legislatures that are weak or executive-dominated. This can occur 
regardless of the specific institutional arrangements, and often happens when head of 
government and the executive is also head of the dominant party. The Japanese Diet 
(Kokkai) is an example of a traditionally subordinate legislature. Until the 1980s, the 
Diet was required to do little more than ratify the decisions of the executive: this was 
a consequence of the unbroken domination of the Liberal Democratic Party after 
1955. Rival parties were eternal outsiders, and factional divisions within the LDP 
were generally played out away from the Diet. However, the progressive decline in the 
sizes of LDP majorities led, by the 1970s, to a less adversarial and more conciliatory 
attitude towards parliamentary opposition. For instance, the membership of standing 
committees was broadened to include minority parties as the LDP started to relax its 
grip on the parliamentary process. A more effective system of parliamentary scrutiny 
and oversight finally emerged in Japan following the LDP’s defeat in the 1993 election, 
although the party returned to power in 1994 and has been in office ever since, except 
for the 2009–12 period.
Less ambiguous examples of marginal legislatures have been found in communist 
regimes and developing states. In the former, tight control by ‘ruling’ communist 
parties and the practice of non-competitive elections ensured that legislatures 
did little more than provide formal approval for the government’s programme. 
Significant levels of executive domination have also sometimes continued into 
the post-communist era. The weakness of the Russian Parliament has encouraged 
some to view it as a mere ‘rubber stamp’. In the developing states of Africa and 
Asia, legislatures have played a largely integrative role, rather than one of policy￾influencing. Their central function has been to strengthen legitimacy and so assist in 
the process of nation-building. It is a backhanded compliment to legislatures that the 
establishment of military rule has usually been accompanied by their suspension or 
abolition. This occurred in Chile, Pakistan and the Philippines in the 1970s, and in 
Turkey and Nigeria in the 1980s.
Legislatures in decline?
There is nothing new about the ‘decline of legislatures’ debate. Since the late 
nineteenth century, anxiety has been expressed about the strengthening of executives, 
and particularly bureaucracies, at the expense of legislatures. This anxiety has been 
heightened by the fact that, since the days of Locke (see p. 32) and Montesquieu, 
legislatures have been seen as the principal vehicles for delivering responsible and 
representative government. The notion that good government requires a strong 
legislature is questionable, however. Legislature power can certainly become 
‘excessive’, especially when it leads to immobilism and policy stalemate. The model 
of the US Congress, for instance, has as many critics as it has admirers. There is, 
nevertheless, general agreement that, during the twentieth century, the power and

role.

status of legislatures changed, and usually for the worse. Whether this amounts to 
a general decline of legislatures, or, rather, a shift in their purpose or function, is 
another matter. The principal factors that have brought about these changes are the 
following:
 the emergence of disciplined political parties
 the growth of ‘big’ government
 the organizational weaknesses of legislatures
 the rise of interest group and media power.
Disciplined political parties
As we have already seen, the emergence from the late nineteenth century onwards of 
mass-membership parties weakened legislatures in a number of respects. In the first 
place, the transition from loose factions (see p. 284) to disciplined party groupings 
undermined the ability of individual legislators to represent constituents as trustees 
by exercising their own judgement and conscience. Parties, rather than legislatures, 
thus became the principal agents of representation, operating through the doctrine 
of the mandate. Party loyalty also weakened legislatures in terms of their function 
as debating chambers. However articulate, impassioned or persuasive parliamentary 
oratory may be, it has little or no impact on voting in party-dominated legislatures, 
which means that debate becomes sterile or ritualized. As Richard Cobden (1804–
65) commented about the UK House of Commons, ‘In this House I have heard many 
a speech that moved men to tears – but never one that turned a vote.’ James Madison 
(see p. 384) during the debates over the American constitution warned against the 
dangers of ‘faction’, and many of the powers of the US Congress were envisaged in an 
era where parties were merely loose labels.
More important, however, is the tendency of party unity to facilitate executive 
domination. Loyalty to party means, for the majority of legislators, loyalty to the 
government of the day, which is formed, after all, from the leading members of their 
own party. Far from checking or even embarrassing the executive, many legislatures 
have, therefore, come to function as its willing accomplices or doughty defenders. 
This has profoundly changed the dynamics of political systems, insofar as the focus 
of leader attention shifts to maintaining tight control over the party, rather than 
managing relations with the legislature.
‘Big’ government
The growth in the role of government, especially in the areas of social welfare 
and economic management, has usually been associated with a redistribution of 
power from legislatures to executives. This occurs for three reasons. First, it leads 
to an increase in the size and status of bureaucracies, which are responsible for 
administering government policy and overseeing an ever-widening range of public 
services. Second, it places greater emphasis on the process of policy initiation and 
formulation. Although individual legislature members can initiate policy in specific 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_15.indd 393 23-07-2024 12:54:17394 POLITICS
areas, the task of developing broad and coherent government programmes is quite 
beyond them. During the twentieth century, most legislatures therefore adjusted 
to the loss of positive legislative power by accepting that their central role was to 
scrutinize and criticize, rather than to make policy. Third, ‘big’ government has 
meant that government policy is increasingly complex and intricate. This, in turn, 
has placed a higher premium on expertise, a quality more abundantly possessed by 
‘professional’ bureaucrats than by ‘amateur’ politicians.
Lack of leadership
By virtue of their function as representative forums and debating chambers, 
legislatures suffer from a number of organizational weaknesses. In particular, they 
usually comprise several hundred members, who enjoy formal equality, in the 
sense that they can all vote and contribute to debates. Although advantageous in 
other respects, the egalitarian and fragmented character of legislatures weakens 
their capacity to provide leadership and take concerted action. This problem has 
become more acute in an age in which the public looks to government to solve social 
problems and deliver sustained prosperity, and in which states have no choice but to 
participate in international affairs and global politics. Party-organized legislatures are 
certainly better able to adopt clear and coherent domestic and foreign policies, but, in 
these cases, leadership tends to be provided by parties and only through legislatures. 
As discussed in Chapter 14, it has generally been political executives, rather than 
legislatures, that have been able to respond to this need for leadership, by virtue of 
their greater organizational coherence and the fact that they are headed by a single 
individual, usually a president or prime minister.
Interest group and media power
Not only have power and public attention shifted from legislatures to executives, but 
they have also been lost to interests and groups external to government. The rise of 
interest groups (see Chapter 12) has threatened legislatures in a number of respects. 
The first is that the groups have provided the public with an alternative mechanism 
of representation. Often set up specifically for this purpose, interest groups tend to be 
more effective than legislatures in taking up popular grievances, and giving expression 
to the concerns and aspirations of particular groups. Single-issue groups, for instance, 
now engage in, and promote, the kind of public debate that previously took place 
only in parliamentary chambers. Second, while legislatures have increasingly been 
excluded from the process of policy formulation, organized interests have become 
more prominent, both as representatives of ‘affected groups’, and as sources of 
expert advice and information. Third, the susceptibility of legislatures to lobbying 
has undermined their legitimacy, not least because of the growing perception that 
legislature members are motivated more by self-interest than by a sense of public 
service. Finally, the media, and particularly television and new forms of electronic 
communication, have also helped to make legislatures appear redundant. This 
has occurred because newspapers, television and, increasingly, social media have 
displaced legislatures as the major forums for political debate, and because political 
leaders increasingly wish to deal with the public via the media, rather than indirectly 
through legislatures.

The rise of legislatures?
Many argue that the above analysis paints an over-gloomy picture. To some 
extent, the ‘decline of legislatures’ is too sweeping a notion, since it conceals the 
perhaps more important fact that the role of legislatures in the political process 
has fundamentally changed. Whereas their decline as legislatures and as policy￾shaping bodies can hardly be doubted, many agree with Jean Blondel (1973) that, 
if anything, they have become more important as ‘communicating mechanisms’. 
The willingness of a growing number of legislatures to open up their proceedings 
to television cameras and to provide growing amounts of web-based information 
has certainly helped to raise their public profiles and strengthen them as arenas of 
debate and agencies of oversight. In other words, the media can upgrade legislatures, 
as well as downgrade them. Similarly, there is a trend towards the professionalization 
of legislature work. Following the example of the US Congress, this has seen the 
adoption and strengthening of specialized committees, and an improvement in the 
staff and resources available to individual legislature members.
More broadly, there is evidence in the UK and elsewhere of legislatures becoming 
more critical and independent as a result of the decline of parties as tightly 
disciplined blocs. Not only may better-informed voters expect more of individual 
legislature members, but also better-educated and better-resourced members may be 
less willing to defer to a party line and act as ‘lobby fodder’. If nothing else, general 
recognition that the legitimacy and stability of a political system is linked to the 
perceived effectiveness of its legislature guarantees that, whenever legislature power is 
weakened, voices will be raised in protest. Ultimately, however, the desirable balance 
between the legislature and the executive boils down to a normative judgement about 
the need for representation and accountability, on the one hand, and for leadership 
and strong government, on the other.

CHAPTER 16
PUBLIC POLICY 
AND THE 
BUREAUCRACY
PREVIEW
Policy is the output of the political process. It reflects the impact of government on society; that is, its ability to 
make things better or make things worse. And since the 1960s and 1970s a distinctive area of study has developed: 
policy analysis. This sets out to examine how policy is initiated, formulated and implemented, and how the policy 
process can be improved. At a deeper level, policy analysis reflects on how and why decisions are made, the policy 
process being, in effect, a linked series of decisions, or bundles of decisions.
Studying the policy process often means, in practice, studying the bureaucracy, the massed ranks of public 
officials who are charged with the formulation and execution of public policy. As government has grown and the 
breadth of its responsibilities has expanded, bureaucracies have come to play an increasingly important role in 
political life. No longer can civil servants be dismissed as mere administrators or policy implementers; instead, they 
may dominate the policy process, and even, sometimes, run their countries. A reality of ‘rule by the officials’ may 
thus lie behind the façade of representation and democratic accountability. The control of bureaucratic power is 
therefore one of the most pressing problems in modern politics, and one that no political system has found easy to 
solve. Concern about how bureaucracies are organized has also become more acute as the image of bureaucratic 
efficiency and rationality has been challenged by critics who allege that civil servants are motivated primarily by 
career self-interest. This charge has led to radical attempts to restructure the administrative state.

THE POLICY PROCESS
The policy process relates to the mechanisms through which government policy is 
made. Policy-making is a process in two senses. First, it involves a linked series of 
actions or events. These commence with the germination of ideas and the initiation 
of proposals; continue with some form of debate, analysis and evaluation; and 
conclude with the making of formal decisions and their implementation through 
designated actions. Second, it is a process in the sense that it distinguishes the 
‘how’ of government from the ‘what’ of government; that is, it focuses on the way 
in which policy is made (process), rather than on the substance of policy itself and 
its consequences (product). The first section of this chapter considers how decisions 
are made, and examines the significance of the various stages in the policy process. 
The subsequent sections reflect on the role and significance of bureaucracies in the 
policy process.
Theories of decision-making
The making of decisions, and specifically of bundles of decisions, is clearly central to 
the policy process. Although policy-making also relates to the acts of initiation and 
implementation, the making of decisions and reaching of conclusions is usually seen 
as its key feature. However, it may be difficult to establish how and why decisions 
are made. Decisions are undoubtedly made in different ways by individuals and by 
groups, within small bodies and within large organizations, and within democratic 
and authoritarian structures. Nevertheless, a number of general theories of political 
decision-making have been advanced. The most important of these are the following:
 rational actor models
 incremental models
 bureaucratic organization models
 belief system models.
Rational actor models
Decision-making models that emphasize human rationality have generally been 
constructed on the basis of economic theories that have themselves been derived 
from utilitarianism (see p. 104). Such ideas provide the basis for public-choice 
theories (see p. 306), developed by thinkers such as Anthony Downs (1957), and 
enthusiastically taken up by the New Right. At the heart of such theories lies the 
notion of so-called ‘economic man’, a model of human nature that stresses the self￾interested pursuit of material satisfaction. In this light, decisions can be seen to be 
reached using the following procedures:
 The nature of the problem is identified.
 An objective or goal is selected on the basis of an ordering of individual preferences.
 The available means of achieving this objective are evaluated in terms of their 
effectiveness, reliability, costs and so on.
 A decision is made through the selection of the means most likely to secure the 
desired end.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 398 23-07-2024 12:55:36PUBLIC POLICY AND THE BUREAUCRACY 399
This type of process assumes both that clear-cut objectives exist, and that human 
beings are able to pursue them in a rational and consistent manner. For this to occur, 
it must be possible to compare the amount of satisfaction (pleasure or happiness) that 
each action would bring with that which would result from any other action.
The rational actor model is attractive, in part, because it reflects how most people 
believe decisions should be made. Certainly, politicians and others are strongly 
inclined to portray their actions as both goal-orientated and the product of careful 
thought and deliberation. When a mayor is elected on the promise of lowering crime 
in the city, we might imagine them ideally as sitting down with the police chief 
and experts to figure out exactly how many new police to hire and where to station 
them to make the greatest impact. When examined more closely, however, rational 
calculation may not appear to be a particularly convincing model of decision-making.
In the first place, the model is more easily applied to individuals, who may have 
an ordered set of preferences, than it is to groups, within which there are likely to 
be a number of conflicting objectives. Our mayor’s budget might be set by the city 
council, with some councillors from wards in which crime is not a problem and who 
do not want their constituents’ taxes spent on more policing. Other councillors may 
accept that crime is a problem, but disagree on the solution, wishing instead to fund 
programmes to combat underlying drivers of crime like drug abuse. Organizations 
may therefore be said to make rational decisions only if they are highly centralized 
and possess a strict command structure.
A second problem is that, in practice, decisions are often made on the basis of 
inadequate and sometimes inaccurate information. The mayor and the police chief 
do not have an omnipotent view of where crime is occurring in the city and only 
anecdotal evidence about what is driving it. And the costs and benefits associated 
with different policy options may not be particularly clear. Theoretically they could 
commission experts to study crime in their city and analyse the available policy 
options, though such a study would likely take months, if not years, to complete. 
Yet the mayor and the police chief must make policy and budget decisions on crime 
imminently. Such difficulties encouraged Herbert Simon (1983) to develop the notion 
of ‘bounded rationality’. Simon contended that, given the practical impossibility 
of analysing all possible courses of action, decision-makers must make do with 
finding options that are ‘satisfactory’, rather than most rationally optimal, given the 
information and time constraints they have.
The final drawback of rational actor models is that they fail to take account of 
psychological, emotional, cultural and social factors, each of which have the capacity 
to introduce irrationality into the process of decision-making (Braybrooke and 
Lindblom 1970). This has been acknowledged in economic theory by a declining 
emphasis on the idea of ‘economic man’ and the growing influence of behavioural 
economics. Apart from anything else, behavioural economics highlights the degree 
to which decision-making is influenced by ‘rules of thumb’ and ‘gut feelings’. Crime is 
one of the most emotive of all political issues, and passions run high when discussing 
policy options for addressing it, often depending on your own personal background 
and experiences.
CONCEPT
Policy
A policy, in a general 
sense, is a plan of action. 
To designate something 
as a ‘policy’ implies 
that a formal decision 
has been made, giving 
official sanction to a 
particular course of 
action. Public policy 
can therefore be seen 
as the formal or stated 
decisions of government 
bodies. However, policy 
is better understood 
as the linkage between 
intentions, actions 
and results. At the 
level of intentions, 
policy is reflected 
in what government 
says it will do. At the 
level of actions, policy

of government on the 
larger society.

Incremental models
Incrementalism is usually portrayed as the principal alternative to rational decision￾making, neatly summed up by Lindblom (1959) as the ‘science of muddling through’. 
This position holds that, in practice, decisions tend to be made on the basis of 
inadequate information and low levels of understanding, and this discourages 
decision-makers from pursuing bold and innovative courses of action. Policy-making 
is therefore a continuous, exploratory process: lacking overriding goals and clear￾cut ends, policymakers tend to operate within an existing pattern or framework, 
adjusting their position in the light of feedback in the form of information about 
the impact of earlier decisions. Indeed, incrementalism may suggest a strategy of 
avoidance or evasion, policymakers being inclined to move away from problems, 
rather than trying to solve them. Our mayor and police chief are much more likely to 
authorize a small drug abuse clinic on a trial basis to assess its effectiveness and any 
public reaction before rolling it out on a broader basis over time.
Lindblom’s case for incrementalism is normative, as well as descriptive. In addition 
to providing a more accurate account of how decisions are made in the real world, 
he argued that this approach also has the merit of allowing for flexibility and the 
expression of divergent views. In this sense, it has a distinctly anti-utopian character 
and is well-suited to policy-making in pluralist democracies: ‘muddling through’ at 
least implies responsiveness and flexibility, consultation and compromise. However, 
the model has also been criticized as profoundly conservative, in that it justifies 
a bias against innovation and in favour of inertia. Policymakers who embrace 
incrementalism are more likely to be concerned with day-to-day problems than with 
indulging in long-term visionary thinking. Their energy is channelled into keeping 
the ship on course, not into reflecting on where that course is leading.
A further difficulty is that incrementalism sheds little light on those political decisions 
that are radical, even revolutionary, in character. Hiring more police or funding drug 
abuse clinics are both known options in the city, but what about abolishing the police 
entirely and funding social workers and unarmed public safety officers? In view 
of such difficulties, Amitai Etzioni (1967) proposed the idea of ‘mixed scanning’, 
which attempts to bridge the gap between the rational approach and incrementalism. 
Mixed scanning allows for decision-making being carried out in two distinct phases. 
First, decision-makers broadly evaluate, or scan, all the available policy options in 
terms of their effectiveness in meeting pre-existing objectives. Then, a narrower and 
more incremental approach is adopted as the details of a selected policy option are 
reviewed. In this way, for example, a broad decision to cut public spending must be 
accompanied by a series of more narrowly focused decisions relating to the specific 
areas or programmes that may be affected.
Organizational models
Both rational actor and incremental models are essentially ‘black box’ theories of 
decision-making; neither pays attention to the impact that the structure of the policy￾making process has on the resulting decisions. Bureaucratic or organizational models, 
on the other hand, try to get inside the black box by highlighting the degree to which 
process influences product. This approach was pioneered by Graham Allison (1971). 
Incrementalism: The 
theory that decisions are 
made not in the light of 
clear-cut objectives, but 
through small adjustments 
dictated by changing 
circumstances.
Mixed scanning: A way 
of making decisions that 
uses rationalistic, or high￾order, processes to set 
a basic direction before 
incremental processes are 
employed.

Two contrasting, but related, models emerged from this study. The first, usually 
called the ‘organizational process’ model, highlights the impact on decisions of 
the values, assumptions and regular patterns of behaviour that are found in any 
large organization. Rather than corresponding to rational analysis and objective 
evaluation, decisions are seen to reflect the entrenched culture of the government 
department or agency that makes them. A police chief who has worked as a cop 
for thirty years is going to provide a policing-centric perspective on the policy 
options available to the mayor. The second theory, the ‘bureaucratic politics’ model, 
emphasizes the impact on decisions of bargaining between personnel and agencies 
each pursuing different perceived interests. This approach dismisses the idea of the 
state as a monolith united around a single view or a single interest, and suggests 
that decisions arise from an arena of contest in which the balance of advantage is 
constantly shifting. Policing is just one service in the city vying for attention, and 
the mayor’s advisers and department heads will all offer competing and sometimes 
self-serving perspectives on how to approach the crime problem and what emphasis 
to place on it.
Irving Janis (1972), on the other hand, suggested that many decisions made within 
organizations could be explained in terms of what he called ‘groupthink’. For example, 
if our mayor when meeting with advisers and department heads decides to speak 
first and passionately in favour of more police enforcement, this almost certainly 
puts pressure on everyone at the meeting to agree. After all, everyone owes their job 
to the mayor and wants to maintain good relations with them. If no one speaks up, 
then everyone gets the impression that the rest of the group is in agreement with the 
mayor’s course of action, and perhaps any individual doubts they have are misplaced. 
This helps to explain how and why contrary or inconvenient views may be squeezed 
out of consideration in organizational and group settings.
Groupthink: The 
phenomenon in which 
psychological and 
professional pressures 
conspire to encourage a 
group of decision-makers 
to adopt a unified and 
coherent position.

Although these models undoubtedly draw attention to important aspects of decision￾making, they also have their drawbacks. In the first place, the organizational process 
model allows little scope for political leadership (see Chapter 14) to be imposed from 
above. Second, it is simplistic to suggest, as the bureaucratic politics model does, 
that political actors simply hold views that are based on their own position and on 
the interests of the organizations in which they work. Although the aphorism ‘where 
you stand depends on where you sit’ may often be applicable, personal sympathies 
and individual goals cannot be altogether discounted. Finally, to explain decisions 
entirely in terms of black box considerations is to fail to give any weight to the external 
pressures that emanate from the broader economic, political and ideological context.
Belief system models
Models of decision-making that place an emphasis on the role of beliefs and ideology 
(see p. 29) highlight the degree to which behaviour is structured by perception. What 
people see and understand is, to an extent, what their concepts and values encourage 
them to see and understand. This tendency is particularly entrenched because, in 
most cases, it is largely unconscious. Although decision-makers may believe that they 
are being rational, rigorous and strictly impartial, their social and political values 
may act as a powerful filter, defining for them what is thinkable, what is possible, 
and what is desirable. Certain information and particular options are therefore 
not appreciated, or even considered, while other pieces of information and other 
courses of action feature prominently in the calculus of decision-making. Indeed, 
Kenneth Boulding (1956) underlined the vital importance of this process by pointing 
out that, without a mechanism to filter information, decision-makers would simply 
be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data confronting them. Crime is certainly 
one of those issues that most people have strong beliefs about – if our mayor, for 
example, holds pessimistic views about human nature and moralistic beliefs about 
behaviour like drug use, it’s likely they’ll see enforcement rather than rehabilitation 
as the ‘correct’ policy course.
An attempt to combine different approaches to decision-making that takes account 
of the impact of belief systems has been made by Paul Sabatier (1988). Sabatier’s 
principal concern was to explain how policy changes occur. In particular, he drew 
attention to the role of ‘policy subsystems’; that is, collections of people who in some 
way contribute to influencing policy in a particular area. A policy system may include 
not only interlocking groups of politicians, civil servants and interest groups but also 
researchers, academics and journalists concerned with that area, sometimes seen as 
an epistemic community.
Sabatier maintained that, within policy subsystems, ‘advocacy coalitions’ emerge 
that comprise collections of individuals who share broadly similar beliefs and values. 
These beliefs, nevertheless, operate on three different levels:
 deep core beliefs (fundamental moral or philosophical principles)
 near-core beliefs (policy preferences)
 secondary beliefs (views about implementation or application).
Epistemic community: A 
network of professionals 
who are recognized to 
possess expertise and 
policy-relevant knowledge 
in a particular issue area.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 402 23-07-2024 12:55:37PUBLIC POLICY AND THE BUREAUCRACY 403
The importance of such beliefs is that they provide what Sabatier called the ‘glue’ 
of politics, binding people together on the basis of shared values and preferences. 
However, while core beliefs are highly resistant to change, a greater measure of 
disagreement and flexibility is usually found at the near-core and secondary levels. 
Using this framework, Sabatier proposed that policy change could be understood 
largely in terms of the shifting balance of forces within a policy subsystem, in 
particular through the dominance of one advocacy coalition over others. This process 
may, nevertheless, be seen to be rational insofar as debate within a belief system, and 
rivalry between belief systems, promotes ‘policy-orientated learning’. In the hands 
of Marxists and feminists, however, such ideas can be used to draw very different 
conclusions (Hann 1995). Marxists have argued that the core beliefs within any policy 
subsystem – or, indeed, amongst policymakers and opinion-formers at large – are 
structured by ruling-class ideology and so favour the interests of dominant economic 
interests. Feminists, for their part, may argue that a preponderance of men amongst 
policymakers ensures that the ‘glue’ of politics is provided by patriarchal ideas and 
values. This results in policy biases that help to sustain a system of male power. 
Policing again provides many examples of this, as a traditionally male-dominated 
area and one often critiqued as focused on protecting wealthy and middle-class 
interests over addressing poverty and inequality.
Stages in the policy process
Policy-making cannot be understood simply in terms of how decisions are made. 
Policy involves not only clusters of decisions, in the sense of a number of related 
decisions concerning a particular policy area, but also different kinds of decisions. 
For instance, in the first place, there is the ‘decision to make a decision’. Such decisions 
arise from the perception that there are problems to solve and issues to address: in 
short, ‘something must be done’. The policy process then moves on to a different set 
of decisions about exactly what should be done, how it should be done and when it 
should be done. The matter does not stop there, however. Even when the decisions 
have been put into effect, other questions may emerge and other decisions must be 
taken. These relate to whether policy outcomes match policy intentions, and whether 
the content of policy, as well as the process of decision-making, can be improved in 
the future. The policy process can thus be broken down into four distinct stages:
 policy initiation
 policy formulation
 policy implementation
 policy evaluation.
Policy initiation
Where does policy come from? How do policy proposals arise in the first place? 
Such questions are significant not only because policy must start somewhere, but also 
because this stage in the policy process structures all subsequent debate, discussion 
and decision-making. Policy initiation, then, is crucial, in that it sets the political 
agenda, both by defining certain problems as issues and by determining how those 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 403 23-07-2024 12:55:37404 POLITICS
issues are to be addressed. The set of issues the media, public and politicians focus on 
at any given time is far smaller than the nearly endless list of problems and matters 
government could turn to.
The difficulty of studying policy initiation is that policy can originate in literally any 
part of the political system. Policy can stem ‘from above’ – that is, from political 
leaders, cabinets, government agencies and so forth; and it can arise ‘from below’, 
through pressure from public opinion, the mass media (see Chapter 9), political 
parties (see Chapter 11), interest groups (see Chapter 12), ‘think tanks’ and the like. 
In the form of political leadership, policy initiation consists of mobilizing support 
for initiatives emanating from the personal vision of the leader, or the ideological 
priorities of a ruling party or group. However, political leaders are rarely policy experts 
themselves and thus usually not a source of genuine policy innovation. It is in this area 
that writers, academics and philosophers seemingly unconnected with the world of 
practical politics may play a vital role in the process of policy initiation by developing 
‘core’ values and theories, later developed into specific policy proposals by leaders and 
parties. Much of the economic policy in developed Western states during the early 
post-Second World War period emanated from the ideas of John Maynard Keynes 
(see p. 178). Similarly, New Right policies aimed at ‘rolling back the state’, reducing 
taxes, targeting welfare spending and so on, originally sprang from the writings of, for 
example, Friedrich von Hayek (see p. 36) and Milton Friedman (see p. 179).
Policy initiation ‘from below’ is significant in all political systems. As UK prime 
minister, Harold Macmillan replied when asked about the decisive factors in political 
life, ‘Events, dear boy, events’. These events can range from strikes, riots and natural 
disasters to stock market crashes in foreign states and investment decisions made by 
transnational corporations. Events and crises can radically shift the policy agenda, 
even towards issues that were virtually invisible previously. Sewerage and wastewater, 
for instance, are usually not topical issues and rarely raised in campaigns or debates. 
However, when wastewater systems fail and sewage starts flooding towns and 
polluting rivers, then they quickly become major political issues.
As a rule, however, the more democratic and pluralistic the political system, the more 
significant are bottom-up pressures on policy initiation. Public opinion clearly plays 
a significant role in this process, insofar as regular and competitive elections force 
aspiring leaders to form policy proposals that take account of popular concerns and 
aspirations. However, these concerns and aspirations often remain shapeless and 
unformed until they are articulated by groups claiming to represent sections of the 
public.
Because there are so many potential issues to focus on, and public and political 
attention is limited, the media plays an enormous role in agenda setting, both by 
selecting and prioritizing the information available to the public, and by digesting 
and interpreting it through the process of editorialization. However, because the 
media is also a business, focus can slant towards those issues which the public will 
be most drawn to. For example, the old adage ‘if it bleeds, it leads’ has meant that 
many media outlets often prioritize stories about violent crimes, which in turn has 
meant that crime is a near-permanent issue in politics, and in turn governments tend 
to give plenty of attention to traditional policing and public safety. This is despite 
Agenda setting: The 
ability to structure policy 
debate by controlling 
which issues are discussed 
or establishing a priority 
amongst them.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 404 23-07-2024 12:55:37PUBLIC POLICY AND THE BUREAUCRACY 405
the fact that violent crime in most of the developed world has been in decline for 
decades. Contrast that with cybercrime, which has grown exponentially in the same 
period and now costs the global economy trillions every year. But media reporting of 
cybercrime is comparatively rare, and subsequently the problem rarely emerges as a 
pressing political issue.
Political parties and interest groups also play a key role in agenda setting. Opposition 
parties, for example, do not merely criticize government policy; they also develop 
alternative policies in an attempt to appear to be viable parties of government. 
Interest groups, for their part, highlight a broad array of grievances and concerns, 
promote causes and ideals, and give expression to the interests of diverse groups 
and sections of society. Since the 1970s, researchers have tended to play down the 
role of formal, representative institutions, and to give greater prominence to the 
informal processes through which policy is initiated and developed, a phenomenon 
sometimes described as policy networks (Marsh and Rhodes 1992).
Policy formulation
Once an issue, or set of issues, is on the political agenda, a process of detailed elaboration 
and analysis is required to develop systematic policy proposals. Conventionally seen 
as the most crucial stage in the policy process, policy formulation entails not only 
the translation of broad proposals into specific and detailed recommendations, but 
also the filtering out of proposals, and perhaps even the fundamental recasting of 
the issue under consideration. In their analysis of the policy cycle, Hogwood and 
Gunn (1984) identified a number of stages in the formulation process. The first stage 
involves decisions about how to decide; that is, decisions about which mechanisms 
or procedures and which political actors should be involved in the analysis and 
elaboration of policy. These decisions are clearly vital, as they determine the 
sympathies and interests that will be brought to bear on the policy as it is developed 
and discussed. The second stage involves issue definition and forecasting. This stage 
allows considerable scope for reinterpretation, as those who formulate policy may 
view ‘the problem’ very differently from those who raised the issue in the first place. 
Third, there is the setting of objectives and priorities. Although public opinion 
and the concerns of bodies such as the media, political parties and interest groups 
are likely to influence objective setting, there is, of course, no guarantee that the 
priorities identified by priority formulators will be the same as those advanced by 
policy initiators.
Finally, there is the analysis and review of the policy options, leading to the selection 
of a preferred option. This, in effect, means that an authoritative decision is taken. 
Various factors are likely to be taken into account at this stage in policy formulation, 
the political and electoral ramifications of particular options being no less important 
than considerations of administrative efficiency and effectiveness. It is important to 
note, however, that the final decision, which brings the formulation process to an end, 
may be little more than a formality, decisive argument and debate having happened 
at a much earlier stage. Cabinets, legislatures and international summits thus often 
ratify or ‘rubber stamp’ decisions that have effectively been made elsewhere.
CONCEPT
Policy network
A policy network (or 
policy community) 
is a systematic set of 
relationships between 
political actors who 
share a common interest 
or general orientation 
in a particular area. 
These relationships 
typically cut across 
formal institutional 
arrangements and 
the divide between 
government and non￾governmental bodies, 
and are particularly 
significant in the process 
of policy initiation. A 
policy network may 
therefore embrace 
government officials, 
key legislators, well￾placed lobbyists, 
sympathetic academics, 
leading journalists and 
others.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 405 23-07-2024 12:55:37406 POLITICS
It would be foolish to imply that the task of formulation has the same character 
in different systems and different states. Richardson (1984) attempted to unravel 
different policy-formulation processes by identifying contrasting national ‘policy 
styles’. In particular, he drew attention to two main dimensions: whether policy 
formulation is based on consultation or imposition, and whether governments 
engage in long-term planning or react to events on a more or less day-to-day basis. 
In this light, Sweden and Japan can perhaps be classified as states with policy styles 
that broadly favour both consultation and long-term planning. In both cases, there 
is an elaborate and formalized system of group consultation orientated around a 
widely agreed set of policy objectives and priorities. On the other hand, in the USA, 
although the fragmented nature of the federal government requires a high level of 
consensus for policy to be accepted, it also virtually rules out longer-term planning, 
and so entrenches a reactive, ‘fire brigade’ policy style.
A key feature of formulation, regardless of differences in national policy styles, is that 
it substantially reduces the range of actors involved in the policy process. While a 
broad variety of interests, groups and movements may play a role in policy initiation, 
policy formulation is the job of ‘insiders’ (government officials, key advisers, 
politicians and consulted groups), those who are either part of the machinery of 
government or have institutionalized access to it. This has left the formulation process 
open to a number of criticisms. One of these arises from the undue influence that 
civil servants supposedly exert by virtue of their role as policy advisers, examined in 
more detail later in the chapter. Other criticisms suggest that the tendency towards 
group consultation has meant that policy is shaped by powerful sectional interests, 
rather than by the broader public good (Olson 1965), and that, although elected 
politicians oversee the policy process and make the final decisions, the process itself 
often guarantees that their contribution is marginal.
Policy implementation
One of the major advances made in the discipline of policy analysis has been to 
underline the importance of the implementation stage. Traditionally, implementation 
was taken for granted, being seen as an aspect of administration (see p. 411), not as 
a feature of politics. Analyses of the Great Society programme in the USA in the 
mid-1960s, however, destroyed illusions about the politics–administration divide, 
and graphically illustrated how far policy ‘outputs’ may differ from the intentions of 
policymakers. For this reason, Wildavsky (1980) described policy analysis as ‘speaking 
truth to power’. The conditions required to achieve ‘perfect’ implementation, in the 
sense of ensuring that policy is delivered exactly as intended, were outlined by Hood 
(1976) as follows:
 a unitary administrative system with a single line of authority to ensure central 
control
 uniform norms and rules that operate throughout the system
 perfect obedience or perfect control
 perfect information, perfect communication and perfect coordination
 sufficient time for administrative resources to be mobilized.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 406 23-07-2024 12:55:37PUBLIC POLICY AND THE BUREAUCRACY 407
In view of the difficulty of achieving any of these conditions, let alone all of them, it is 
not surprising that the gap between decision and delivery is often significant. Indeed, 
not only may central control and strict obedience be unfeasible, they may also be 
undesirable. Although those who make policy may enjoy democratic legitimacy, 
those who implement it (civil servants, local government officers, teachers, doctors, 
police officers and so on) may have a better ‘street-level’ understanding of what will 
work and what will not work. Such considerations have led to a ‘bottom-up’ tradition 
of policy analysis that stresses the need for flexibility, as well as the value of leaving 
discretion in the hands of policy executors. This contrasts with the more conventional 
‘top-down’ view of implementation that emphasizes uniformity and control. Most 
commentators, however, now recognize the trade-off between central control and 
flexibility in application as the major dilemma in the area of policy implementation 
(Barrett and Fudge 1981).
Although perfect implementation may be neither possible nor desirable, most of the 
concerns expressed about policy implementation have focused on the dangers of 
flexibility in application. This was underlined by Pressman and Wildavsky’s (1973) 
pioneering study of implementation, subtitled How Great Expectations in Washington 
Are Dashed in Oakland; Or, Why It’s Amazing that Federal Programs Work at All … 
Flexibility may arise for a number of reasons. One of these is that those who execute 
policy may not merely be anxious to use their experience and ‘street-level’ knowledge 
to ensure that implementation is effective, they may also, as public-choice theorists 
point out, wish to protect their career and professional interests. Civil servants 
and public-sector professionals will then have an obvious incentive to filter out or 
reinterpret aspects of public policy that seem to be threatening or inconvenient.
Other concerns about policy implementation arise less from the inadequacy of 
political control from above and more from the absence of consumer pressure from 
below. From this perspective, poor implementation, especially in the delivery of 
public services, results from the fact that government typically operates outside the 
market mechanism and is usually a monopoly supplier of its ‘goods’. Civil servants, 
local government officers and public-sector workers can, in general, afford to be 
sloppy and inefficient because, unlike in private businesses, they do not have to keep 
the customer satisfied. An important response to this has been the emergence of the 
new public management (see p. 415).
Policy evaluation
The policy process culminates with the evaluation and review of policy, leading, 
in theory at least, to decisions being made about the maintenance, succession or 
termination of the policy in question. This stage completes the policy cycle, in the 
sense that information acquired through evaluation can be fed back into the initiation 
and formulation stages. This process can throw up new policy proposals, and help to 
refine and improve existing ones (see Figure 16.1).
As well as addressing substantive issues related to the appropriateness or effectiveness 
of public policy, typically carried out through the use of cost–benefit analysis, 
evaluation may also shed light on procedural issues, such as how the formulation 
stage is organized, who is consulted and when, and how implementation is 
Cost–benefit analysis: A 
technique to evaluate the 
feasibility of a project or 
plan, or the impact of a 
policy, by quantifying its 
costs and benefits.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 407 23-07-2024 12:55:37408 POLITICS
controlled. Unfortunately, despite its importance, governments have usually been 
reluctant to allocate funds for policy evaluation. Yet it is also true that the impact of 
policy is in many cases very difficult to quantify. How do we evaluate the value of a 
public amenity like a park? While there may be measurable increases in surrounding 
property values or improvements in a local microclimate, the happiness of the people 
who use the park and the increased sense of community the park fosters are by far 
the most desirable policy outcomes. Yet these latter benefits are hard to specifically 
quantify or capture in statistics.
What is clear is that the outcomes of the policy process are often very different from 
what was intended by those who formulated or made policy decisions. King and 
Crewe (2013) catalogued a remarkable collection of policy blunders that had been 
committed by UK governments in recent decades. These included the poll tax, a policy 
designed to control government spending but which ended up fomenting widespread 
civil unrest; a failed scheme to update London’s Underground system, in which up to 
£20 billion of public money was wasted; and the establishment of the Child Support 
Agency, which left tens of thousands of single mothers in poverty without financial 
support from absent fathers. For many, such policy failures highlight the pressing 
importance of open government (see p. 408) and public accountability. For the policy 
process to work effectively in translating inputs into appropriate outputs, it must be 
open, at all times, to scrutiny and criticism. All too frequently, a culture of secrecy 
merely conceals incompetence and provides scope for arbitrary and self-serving 
behaviour.
Such failures, though, also highlight the sheer difficulty of making effective public 
policy, particularly given the scale and complexity of modern programmes. For 
instance, in 1990, in response to a mass shooting and greater public activism, the 
Canadian government began developing a national gun registry to help the track 
firearms, which went into effect in 1995. The registry was part of a package of 
policies supported by Canadian police associations and gun-control advocates and 
received wide support from various experts and the general public. Yet within a few 
years, support for the policy began to disintegrate. Originally estimated to cost $2 
million annually, by the 2000s that figure had exploded to over $1 billion. Privacy 
and security breaches caused some to withdraw their support. And evaluating its 
impact on public safety has been difficult. Though some decreases in gun-related

crime have been observed since 1995, they have not been consistent or clearly related 
to the introduction of the registry. Recent public polls have found most Canadians 
believe the registry is ineffective and now support abolishing it. Thus, even a policy 
introduced with the right intentions and enacted with the support of political leaders, 
policy experts and the public at large can still fail to have the desired impact.
ROLE OF THE BUREAUCRACY
On the face of it, bureaucracies fulfil a single, but vital, function. Their primary 
concern is policy implementation: the execution and enforcement of the laws made 
by the legislature and the policies decided by the political executive. Indeed, while 
other functions of government (such as representation, policy-making and interest 
articulation) are carried out by a variety of institutions, policy implementation is 
solely the responsibility of civil servants, albeit working under their political masters. 
Moreover, in Max Weber’s (see p. 87) model of bureaucracy as a reliable, predictable 
and, above all, efficient means of social organization, there is a strict separation 
between the administrative world and the political world. According to this view, 
bureaucrats are simply cogs in a machine, administrators operating within a fixed 
hierarchy and according to clearly defined and rational rules. Indeed, Weber warned 
that the strict emphasis within bureaucracy on rationality may trap people in an 
‘iron cage’, meaning that bureaucrats become ‘specialists without spirit, sensualists 
without heart’ (Weber 1905). The reality is very different, however. Despite their 
formal subordination and impartiality, bureaucrats exert considerable influence on 
the policy process, and thus fulfil a number of key functions in any political system. 
The most important of these are the following:
 carrying out administration
 offering policy advice
 articulating and aggregating interests
 maintaining political stability.
Functions of the bureaucracy
Administration
The core function of the bureaucracy is to implement or execute law and policy: it is 
thus charged with administering government business. This is why the bureaucracy 
is sometimes referred to as ‘the administration’, while the political executive is termed 
‘the government’. This distinction implies that a clear line can be drawn between the 
policy-making role of politicians and the policy-implementing role of bureaucrats. 
Certainly, the vast majority of the world’s civil servants are engaged almost exclusively 
in administrative responsibilities that range from the implementation of welfare 
and social-security programmes to the regulation of the economy, the granting of 
licences and the provision of information and advice to citizens at home and abroad. 
The sizes of bureaucracies are, therefore, closely linked to the broader responsibilities 
of government and its presence in the life of the nation. In the Nordic countries, for 
instance, over a quarter of people are employed by the public sector, a result of the

pejorative term meaning 
pointless administrative 
routine, or ‘red tape’. In 
the social sciences, the 
concept of bureaucracy 
refers to phenomena 
as different as rule by 
non-elected officials, 
the process of public 
administration and 
a rational mode of 
organization. According 
to Max Weber (see 
p. 87), bureaucracy 
is characterized by 
rationality, rule￾governed behaviour and 
impersonal authority. In 
the field of comparative 
government, the 
term refers to the 
administrative 
machinery of the state, 
bureaucrats being non￾elected state officials or 
civil servants.

expansive welfare states (see p. 75) that operate there. In Cuba, where most economic 
entities are also state enterprises, more than three-quarters of the population work 
for the state.
Nevertheless, the image of bureaucrats as mere functionaries who apply rules and 
carry out orders issued by others can be misleading. In the first place, since much 
administrative detail is, of necessity, left to officials, civil servants may be allowed 
significant discretion in deciding precisely how to implement policy. Second, the 
degree of political control exercised over the bureaucracy varies greatly from state 
to state. Whereas state officials in China are subject to strict and continuous party 
supervision, in France and Japan their high status and reputation for expertise 
guarantee them a considerable degree of autonomy. Third, in their capacity as policy 
advisers, senior civil servants at least have the ability to shape the policies that they 
are later required to administer.
Policy advice
The political significance of the bureaucracy stems largely from its role as the chief 
source of the policy information and advice available to government. This policy role 
helps to distinguish top-level civil servants (who have daily contact with politicians 
and are expected to act as policy advisers) from middle-ranking and junior-ranking 
civil servants (who deal with more routine administrative matters). Debate about 
the political significance of bureaucracies therefore tends to concentrate on this elite 
group of senior officials.
FOCUS ON . . . 
OPEN GOVERNMENT: FOR OR AGAINST?
Open government is the principle that what happens in government should be open to 
public scrutiny and criticism on the basis of a free flow of information from public bodies to 
representative institutions, the mass media and the general public. As it is universally accepted 
that some information should be kept secret (on the grounds of national security, privacy and 
so on), open government is normally understood to imply a bias in favour of the public’s ‘right 
to know’. This is usually enshrined in a freedom of information act that forces the government 
to defend secrecy before the courts.
The advantages of open government include the following:
 It places a check on incompetence, corruption and tyranny.
 It promotes political argument and debate, and results in improved policy outcomes and a 
better-informed electorate.
Its drawbacks include the following:
 It hampers the efficiency of policy-making by exposing the formulation process to the 
glare of publicity.
 It discourages the consideration of unpopular, but nevertheless important, ideas and 
proposals.

In theory, a strict distinction can be drawn between the policy responsibilities of 
bureaucrats and those of politicians. Policy is supposedly made by politicians; 
bureaucrats simply offer advice. The policy role of civil servants therefore boils 
down to two functions: outlining the policy options available to ministers, and 
reviewing policy proposals in terms of their likely impact and consequences. The 
policy influence of senior officials is further restricted by the fact that they are either 
required to be politically neutral, as in the UK, Japan and Australia, or are subject to a 
system of political appointment, as in the USA. However, there are reasons to believe 
that the policy role of civil servants is politically more significant than is suggested 
above. For instance, there is no clear distinction between making policy and offering 
policy advice. Quite simply, decisions are made on the basis of the information 
available, and this means that the content of decisions is invariably structured by the 
advice offered. Moreover, as the principal source of the advice available to politicians, 
bureaucrats effectively control the flow of information: politicians know what civil 
servants tell them. Information can thus be concealed, or at least ‘shaped’ to reflect 
the preferences of the civil service. The principal source of bureaucratic power is, 
nevertheless, the expertise and specialist knowledge that accumulates within the 
bureaucracy. As the responsibilities of government expand and policy becomes 
more complex, ‘amateur’ politicians almost inevitably come to depend on their 
‘professional’ bureaucratic advisers (Kingdon 1984).
US President Barack Obama speaks with his senior advisers in the Oval Office in 
2011. Political advisers occupy an increasingly prominent role in executive decision￾making, yet even large groups of professionals can be liable to ‘groupthink’ and 
flawed decision-making.

CONCEPT
Administration
The term administration 
is used in a number of 
ways. It can be used 
to refer collectively to 
the senior personnel in 
the executive branch, 
as in the ‘Obama 
administration’. More 
generally, it means the 
task of coordinating and 
executing policy. More 
narrowly, administration 
means dealing with 
information and 
maintaining control. In 
this sense, it refers to 
the managerial duties 
of senior officials, as 
opposed to the day-to￾day job of execution. 
‘Public administration’ 
refers either to the 
mechanisms and 
institutions through 
which public policy is 
put into effect, or to 
the academic discipline 
that studies these 
mechanisms.

DEBATING . . .
CAN CIVIL SERVANTS EVER BE POLITICALLY IMPARTIAL?
Apart from political systems in which the state is committed to an explicit set of ideological goals, all or most civil servants 
are expected to be politically impartial, in the sense that they do not allow their own views and preferences to affect their 
professional activities. But is neutrality in this sense possible? Can administration be kept separate from politics, or may 
political impartiality be a mere pretence, concealing the pursuit of self-interest or other biases?
YES NO
Civil servants as rational actors. Civil servants differ 
fundamentally from politicians, in that they are primarily 
concerned with the rational and efficient organization of 
society, not the pursuit of partisan advantage. According 
to Max Weber, bureaucracy is a reliable, predictable 
and, above all, efficient means of social organization. 
Bureaucratic organization offers civil servants very little 
scope for personal discretion because they operate 
within a firmly ordered hierarchy, in which lower offices 
are closely supervised by higher ones; an emphasis is 
placed on evidence-based, rational decision-making; 
and appointment and advancement are determined by 
strictly professional criteria.
Permanence and its implications. For civil servants, 
permanence and professionalism go hand in hand. 
Except where spoils systems are in operation, incoming 
governments are confronted by the same body of 
officials who served the outgoing government. In these 
circumstances, civil servants are forced to become 
political chameleons, able to work loyally for whichever 
government happens to be in power, regardless of its 
political complexion or ideological leanings. Otherwise, 
their careers will be seriously damaged. In practice, 
political neutrality therefore means that any personal 
preferences that civil servants may have are never so 
strongly held that they prevent them from faithfully 
serving any political master.
Public service ethos. Civil servants, in the main, do 
not need to be forced to be politically impartial; it is 
something that is inculcated by the way civil servants 
are recruited, trained and operate. This occurs in a 
number of ways. People are drawn to public service by a 
concern for the larger interests of the state and society, 
a motivation clearly different from both the partisan 
passions that drive politicians and the self-interested 
concerns of those in private business. A public service 
ethos is also inculcated by the arrangements through 
which civil servants are recruited and trained, with a 
strong emphasis on cultivating expertise and specialist 
knowledge.
Bureaucratic self-interest. For public-choice theorists 
(see pp. 15-17), civil servants are primarily motivated by 
career self-interest and, thus, seek the expansion of the 
agency or department in which they work and an increase 
in its budget (Niskanen 1971). This is because bureaucratic 
growth guarantees job security, expands promotion 
prospects, improves salaries and brings top officials, at least, 
greater power, patronage and prestige. Supporters of the 
New Right therefore often explain the trend towards ‘big’ 
government in terms of the policy influence exerted by 
civil servants acting as ‘nature’s social democrats’. In order 
to advance free-market policies successfully, bureaucratic 
power must be checked or circumvented.
Conservative power bloc. Socialists, and particularly 
Marxists, highlight class biases that run through the state 
bureaucracy, turning senior civil servants into a conservative 
veto group that dilutes, even blocks, the radical initiatives 
of socialist governments (Miliband 1969). This happens, in 
part, because top civil servants share the same educational 
and social background as industrialists and business 
managers, and so share their values, prejudices and general 
outlook. Higher civil servants also work closely with the 
world of corporate capitalism, leading, amongst other 
things, to the ‘revolving door’ through which bureaucrats 
are increasingly recruited from the private sector, and civil 
servants are offered lucrative employment opportunities 
when they retire.
Departmental culture. Government agencies are not 
impersonal administrative machines (as suggested by 
Weber), but social institutions within which develop a set 
of shared (and usually unquestioned) beliefs, values and 
assumptions. Such ‘groupthink’ exerts a powerful influence 
over politicians, who are encouraged to ‘go native’ by the 
fact that they are both vastly outnumbered by officials and 
generally recognize that officials possess greater knowledge 
and expertise than they do themselves. Not uncommonly, 
a department’s culture is also shaped by the nature and 
interests of the client groups it serves.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 412 23-07-2024 12:55:38PUBLIC POLICY AND THE BUREAUCRACY 413
Articulating interests
Although by no means one of their formal functions, bureaucracies often help to 
articulate, and sometimes aggregate, interests. Bureaucracies are brought into 
contact with interest groups through their task of policy implementation, and their 
involvement in policy formulation and advice. This has increased as a result of 
corporatist (see p. 304) tendencies that have blurred the divisions between organized 
interests and government agencies. Groups such as doctors, teachers, farmers and 
business corporations thus become ‘client groups’, serviced by their respective 
agencies, and also serve as an invaluable source of information and advice. This 
clientelism may benefit the political system, insofar as it helps to maintain consensus. 
By virtue of having access to policy formulation, it is more likely that organized 
interests will cooperate with government policy. On the other hand, clientelism may 
also interfere with the public responsibilities and duties of civil servants. This, for 
instance, occurs when regulatory agencies end up being controlled by the industries 
they supposedly regulate, a phenomenon known as regulatory capture. When group 
interests coincide with those of the bureaucracy, a policy nexus may develop that 
democratic politicians find impossible to break down.
Political stability
The final function of bureaucracies is to provide a focus of stability and continuity 
within political systems. This is sometimes seen as particularly important in 
developing states, where the existence of a body of trained career officials may 
provide the only guarantee that government is conducted in an orderly and 
reliable fashion. This stability depends very largely on the status of bureaucrats 
as permanent and professional public servants: while ministers and governments 
come and go, the bureaucracy is always there. The Northcote–Trevelyan reforms 
of 1870 that created the modern UK civil service were based on the principles of 
impartial selection, political neutrality (see p. 412), permanence and anonymity. 
The term ‘permanent secretary’ used in the UK and other Commonwealth 
countries to denote the head of bureaucratic department emphasizes that stability. 
Dysfunctional bureaucracies on the other hand are often denoted by a spoils 
system for government appointments, where political connections, rather than 
merit, drive recruitment and promotion.
However, continuity can also have its disadvantages. In the absence of effective public 
scrutiny and accountability, it can undoubtedly lead to corruption, a problem that 
is found in many developing states, where it is compounded by widespread poverty 
and disadvantage. In other cases, permanence may breed in civil servants either 
a tendency towards arrogance and insularity, or a bias in favour of conservatism. 
Career civil servants can come to believe that they are more capable of defining the 
common good or general will than are elected politicians. They may, therefore, feel 
justified in resisting radical or reformist political tendencies, seeing themselves as 
custodians of the state’s interest.

Organization of the bureaucracy
One of the limitations of Weber’s theory of bureaucracy is that it suggests that the 
drive for efficiency and rationality will lead to the adoption of essentially similar 
bureaucratic structures the world over. Weber’s ‘ideal type’ of bureaucracy thus ignores 
the various ways in which bureaucracies can be organized, as well as differences that 
arise from the political, social and cultural contexts in which bureaucracies operate. 
The organization of bureaucracies is important for two reasons. It affects the degree 
to which public accountability and political control over the bureaucracy can be 
achieved and, as has been increasingly recognized since the 1980s, it influences its 
efficiency and effectiveness, and so has major implications for the performance and 
cost of public services.
All state bureaucracies are, in some way, organized on the basis of purpose or function. 
This is achieved through the construction of departments, ministries and agencies 
charged with responsibility for particular policy areas: education, housing, defence, 
drug control, taxation and so forth. Of course, the number of such departments and 
agencies varies over time and from state to state, as do the ways in which functional 
responsibilities are divided or combined. For example, after the September 11 attacks 
on the USA in 2001, President G. W. Bush established the White House Office of 
Homeland Security. This is a super-department that combines the departments 
of immigration, customs and domestic security, and is designed to ensure a fully 
coordinated response to the threat of terrorism.
Centralism or decentralism?
The most significant feature of these functionally defined bureaucracies is the 
degree of centralization or decentralization within them. The systems found in the 
remaining communist regimes, such as China and Vietnam, which are subject to 
strict party control and supervision at every level, are amongst the most centralized 
bureaucratic systems in the world. Beyond those, the most centralized liberal￾democratic bureaucracy has traditionally been that in France, which was constructed 
on the basis of the Napoleonic model of administration. This emphasized the 
importance of a highly centralized and hierarchically structured body of technical 
experts, wedded to the long-term interests of the French state. The Conseil d’État
(Council of State) is the supreme administrative body in France; it advises on 
legislative and administrative matters, and acts as the highest administrative court. 
The École Nationale d’Administration and the École Polytechnique function as training 
schools for civil servants, giving the so-called ‘grands corps’ (senior administrators 
and technical experts) unrivalled prestige.
The USA, in contrast, is an example of a decentralized bureaucracy. The federal 
bureaucracy operates under the formal authority of the president as chief 
administrator. However, it is so diffuse and unwieldy that all presidents struggle 
to coordinate and direct its activities. One reason for this fragmentation is that 
the responsibilities of the federal government overlap with those of state and local 
governments, whose cooperation is required to ensure effective implementation. 
A second reason is the impact of the separation of powers (see p. 377). While 
executive departments and agencies operate under presidential authority via their 
CONCEPT
Corruption
Corruption is 
dishonest, fraudulent 
or inappropriate 
conduct by those in 
official positions, and 
involves the abuse of the 
powers of someone’s 
office in the pursuit of 
private gain. In most 
cases, corruption has 
a material or narrowly 
financial character, its 
most common political 
manifestations being 
bribery. However, 
corruption may also 
involve political gain 
(such as smearing 
or jailing political 
opponents), vengeance 
(punishing personal 
enemies) or nepotism 
(giving government 
perks to friends and 
family members).
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 414 23-07-2024 12:55:38PUBLIC POLICY AND THE BUREAUCRACY 415
cabinet secretaries or directors, a bewildering array of independent regulatory 
commissions have been created, and are funded, by Congress. Although presidents 
appoint the members of these commissions, they cannot dismiss them or interfere 
with their responsibilities as laid down by Congress. A third reason is that there is 
tension between permanent civil servants and the much smaller number of political 
appointees in so-called ‘Schedule C’ posts. While the latter can be expected to make 
loyalty to the administration their priority, the former may be more committed to the 
growth of their bureaus or the continuance of their services and programmes.
Remaking the bureaucracy
The conventional structure of government bureaucracies has come under particular 
scrutiny and pressure since the 1980s. In extreme cases, this has led to attempts to 
restructure the administrative state. For instance, the Clinton administration in 
the USA was deeply impressed by the ideas developed in Osborne and Gaebler’s 
Reinventing Government (1992). The key idea suggested that the job of government 
is to ‘steer’ not to ‘row’; in other words, that government works best when it concerns 
itself with policy-making and leaves the delivery of services or policy implementation 
to other bodies acting as agents of the state. In theory, such an approach need 
not necessarily be linked to the contraction of state responsibilities, but its most 
enthusiastic advocates have undoubtedly come from the New Right, which has 
embraced this analysis as part of its broader attack on ‘big’ government.
These ideas have been influential in the USA and a number of other Western 
countries. This is turn has motivated the pursuit of smaller government and the 
adoption of New Public Management strategies, for instance in the UK, through the 
civil service reforms introduced by Thatcher and Major, and further developed by 
Blair and Cameron. A significant step in this process was taken with the launching 
in 1988 of the Next Steps initiative, which began dismantling a unified national 
administration by restricting ministries to their ‘core’ policy functions and handing 
over responsibility for implementation to executive agencies. In 2023, there were 
thirty-eight executive agencies in the UK, ranging from the Prison Service to 
the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. Attempts to compensate for alleged 
inefficiency and unresponsiveness in public administration have also led to the wider 
use of performance targets and quality measurement. From the late 1990s, the UK 
government attempted to extend a culture of target-setting and performance review 
across the UK public sector, linking target fulfilment to funding and being willing 
publicly to expose ‘under-performance’.
As governments struggle to keep public spending under control, such developments, 
especially the divorce between policy advice and policy implementation, are likely to 
become more common. However, the drive to streamline administration, promote 
efficiency and cut costs carries political costs. The most obvious of these is the 
weakening of public accountability and the emergence of a ‘democratic deficit’. The 
creation of semi-independent executive agencies tends to mean that elected politicians 
no longer take responsibility for day-to-day administrative or operational matters. 
A second problem is that the introduction of management techniques, structures 
and, increasingly, personnel from the private sector may weaken the public-service

New public 
management
New public management 
(NPM) stands broadly for 
the use of private sector 
management techniques 
in government and 
for the transfer of 
government functions 
to private bodies. The 
philosophy of NPM is 
that government should 
‘steer’ (decide policy) 
while private bodies 
should ‘row’ (deliver 
services), and that public 
bodies should be imbued 
with the ‘entrepreneurial 
spirit’. Examples of the 
latter include the use of 
performance-related pay, 
short-term contracts 
and open recruitment 
strategies. NPM also 
shifts the thinking about 
the citizens it serves, 
reconceptualizing them 
as ‘customers’ and 
thus the importance of 
metrics like customer 
satisfaction, service 
times and performance 
standards to the 
operations of the public 
service. NPM is based 
on assumptions about 
the inherent inefficiency 
and unresponsiveness 
of public bodies, and the 
power of quasi-market 
approaches to rectify the 
situation.

ethos that state bureaucracies have striven over the years to develop. The civil service 
culture in states as different as Japan, India, France and the UK may be criticized for 
its aloofness, even arrogance, but it is at least linked to ideas such as public service 
and the national interest, rather than private gain and entrepreneurialism. A third 
disadvantage is that, although this type of reorganization tends to be associated 
with the rolling back of the state, it may, in practice, lead to greater centralization 
and government control. This occurs because, as government relinquishes direct 
responsibility for the delivery of services, it is forced to set up a range of new bodies 
to carry out funding and regulatory functions.
POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
BOTSWANA: THE BENEFITS OF A STRONG BUREAUCRACY
Postcolonial African nations have faced enormous 
governance challenges. Upon independence, most of 
the colonial bureaucrats who had controlled their nations 
returned to Europe, creating an administrative vacuum that 
could not be easily or quickly filled by the local population, 
nearly all of whom had been denied the education or 
experience to take on such roles. The lack of functioning 
bureaucracies meant many postcolonial regimes were 
weak and with often limited reach beyond the major cities. 
Amongst other problems, this significantly undermined 
their ability to support economic and social development, 
to attract investment and in turn support the rule of law.
Botswana, however, has proven to be an outlier, and some 
have cited its development of a professional and centralized 
civil service (along with pluralistic institutions and political 
norms) as the key to its success story (Acemoglu and 
Robinson 2012). For several decades, Botswana has been 
one of the fastest growing economies in Africa, despite 
starting at a very low base of development. Like many of 
its neighbours, Botswana’s initial economic growth was 
greatly supported by the discovery of mineral resources, 
particularly diamonds. Unlike its neighbours, however, 
Botswana channelled those profits into its governance and 
public-sector spending which has supported a much more 
sustainable path of economic development. Revenues 
were also used to invest in education, as well as scholarships 
to send Botswanans to university educations overseas, with 
the proviso they would return to work in the civil service.
Botswana is one of only a handful of African countries that 
have independent boards responsible for the recruitment 
and promotion of civil servants. This is essential to prevent 
the bureaucracy from becoming a patronage tool in the 
hands of executives – in many other African nations, 
recruitment and promotion to government jobs are used 
by politicians to reward supporters. Botswana also has 
some of the highest rates of pay for civil servants across 
the continent. In many developing nations, poor pay rates 
incentivize corruption as civil servants attempt to use their 
offices to support themselves. In some systems, corruption 
is so routine that civil servants may even be expected to 
pay a cut of the expected profits to those who appoint 
them to their positions. Though corruption in Botswana is 
still present, particularly in rural areas and certain economic 
sectors with big private interests, it routinely ranks as the 
least corrupt nation in Africa.

service in turn supported the development of major

BUREAUCRATIC POWER: OUT OF CONTROL?
Sources of bureaucratic power
Despite their constitutional image as loyal and supportive public servants, 
bureaucrats have widely been seen as powerful and influential figures who collectively 
constitute a ‘fourth branch of government’. Theorists as different as Weber, J. Robert 
Michels (1911), James Burnham (1941) and Leon Trotsky have drawn attention 
to the phenomenon of bureaucratic power and the degree to which politicians are 
subordinate to it. For instance, while Michels explained this in terms of the ‘iron law 
of oligarchy’ (see p. 283), Trotsky argued that Russia’s workers state had degenerated 
through the transformation, under Stalin, of the communist party into a bureaucratic 
dictatorship (Trotsky 1937). Japanese civil servants, especially those in the once￾prestigious Japanese MITI, have often been viewed as the ‘permanent politicians’ who 
masterminded the Japanese ‘economic miracle’ of the 1950s and 1960s (see p. 178).
Kellner and Crowther-Hunt (1980) dubbed the UK’s civil service ‘Britain’s ruling 
class’. Similarly, there is a perception that the driving force in the EU behind political 
union is the Brussels-based administrative staff of the European Commission, the 
so-called ‘Eurocrats’.
Concern about bureaucratic power has been particularly acute amongst those on the 
political left and the political right who have dismissed the conventional notion of 
civil service neutrality. Marxists have traditionally argued that class interests operate 
through the bureaucracy, tending, in particular, to dilute radical policy initiatives by 
infrastructure projects. Expansion of roads and rail created 
links to the outside world, while stable governance and low 
rates of corruption attracted investors and capital into 
the country. Increasingly skilled civil servants engaged in 
careful economic planning that directed mineral revenues 
into other areas of economic development, avoiding many 
of the problems faced by unbalanced resource-extraction 
economies and spreading wealth across a wider cross￾section of the population, which in turn, fostered greater 
economic and human development (Charlton 1991).
The strength of Botswana’s bureaucracy naturally raises 
some questions over the relative power of elected 
politicians to unelected civil servants. The permanent 
secretaries of Botswana’s departments, particularly in key 
ministries like finance, are considered highly influential 
in policy-making, and their influence can readily eclipse 
inexperienced ministers. It is also not uncommon for 
senior bureaucrats to become ministers themselves. 
Although Botswana’s cabinet is drawn from the parliament, 
is has become common for the dominant Botswana 
Democratic Party (BDP) to nominate senior bureaucrats 
and businesspeople to run for safe parliamentary seats so 
they may be selected for the cabinet in the next term. 
Though this has created cabinets with significant expertise, 
some argue that it blurs the division between politicians 
and bureaucrats, undermines the representative character 
of the parliament and encourages groupthink and policy 
complacency between a cabinet and secretariat that 
likely share very similar outlooks. Botswana’s parliament 
is relatively small at just sixty-five members. Yet in 2022 
there were twenty-eight ministers and assistant minsters 
serving in cabinet, meaning that the cabinet itself almost 
commanded a majority in parliament. Combined with a 
historically weak opposition, this raises additional questions 
as to whether the legislature can impartially scrutinize or 
provide alternative policy viewpoints. That said, having 
dramatically improved just about every indicator of human 
and economic development over the past half-century, 
and now routinely topping lists for lowest corruption, 
adherence to the rule of law and most effective governance, 
the problems posed by a strong bureaucracy in Botswana 
are perhaps outweighed by the benefits.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 417 23-07-2024 12:55:38418 POLITICS
socialist governments. The New Right, for its part, insists that self-interested public 
officials foster state growth and are, thus, inclined to resist neoliberal or free-market 
policies. However, it is important to remember that the nature of bureaucratic power 
is, perhaps inevitably, shrouded in mystery and conjecture. This is both because, 
if civil servants exert power, they do so through private dealings with ministers 
who are not subject to public scrutiny, and because, in view of the myriad other 
pressures bearing on ministers, the influence of the civil service cannot be quantified. 
Nevertheless, three key sources of bureaucratic power can be identified:
 the strategic position of bureaucrats in the policy process
 the logistical relationship between bureaucrats and ministers
 the status and expertise of bureaucrats.
Strategic position
The policy process in all modern states is structured in a way that offers considerable 
scope for civil service influence. Most crucially, in their capacity as policy advisers, 
civil servants have access to information and are able to control its flow to their 
ministerial bosses. In government departments, knowledge is undoubtedly power, 
and it is officials who decide what ministers know and what they do not know. Policy 
options can thus be selected, evaluated and presented in such a way as to achieve a 
desired decision (Kingdon 1984). This need not, of course, imply that bureaucrats 
are deliberately manipulative or openly political, but merely that their preferences – 
conscious or unconscious – significantly structure policy debate and so can influence 
the content of decisions made.
Links that develop between the bureaucracy and organized interests further 
strengthen their position. As the major interface between government and business, 
labour, professional and other groups, the bureaucracy can build up powerful 
alliances and play a crucial role in formulating and reviewing policy options. This 
has led to the emergence of policy networks, which tend to be relatively impervious 
KEY THINKER
LEON TROTSKY (1879–1940)
Russian Marxist political thinker and revolutionary. An early critic of Lenin’s theory of the 
party and the leader of the 1905 St Petersburg Soviet, Trotsky joined the Bolsheviks in 
1917, becoming Commissar for Foreign Affairs and, later, Commissar for War. Isolated and 
out-manoeuvred after Lenin’s death in 1924, he was banished from the USSR in 1929, and

to influence from the public or elected politicians. Needless to say, bureaucratic 
power does not cease to play a role once policy decisions have been made. Whereas 
politicians can seek alternative sources of policy advice, they are compelled to leave 
policy implementation in the hands of the bureaucracy, whether organized as a 
unified entity, or as a series of semi-independent agencies. Control of implementation 
gives civil servants the opportunity to reinterpret the content of policy, as well as to 
delay, or even thwart, its introduction.
Logistical relationships
The second source of bureaucratic power is the operational relationship and 
distribution of advantage between ministers and civil servants. Ostensibly, ministers 
are political masters and appointed bureaucrats are loyal subordinates. However, 
there are reasons to believe that this relationship may be different, even reversed, in 
practice. The first of these is that politicians are heavily outnumbered by bureaucrats. 
The Prime Minister of Pakistan generally has around thirty cabinet ministers and 
two dozen advisers and special assistants around them to engage in policy-making. 
By contrast there are around 800 members of the Pakistan Administrative Service, 
the bureaucratic elite of Pakistan who run all the major departments and bureaus, 
most of whom have decades of experiences and contacts. To say nothing of the nearly 
3 million rank-and-file public servants working below them. A second factor is the 
different career structures of civil servants and elected politicians. Except where 
‘spoils systems’ operate (see p. 413), civil servants are permanent, in the sense that 
they remain in office while governments come and go. In contrast, ministers are 
only temporary, and in parliamentary systems where reshuffles are frequent, may 
remain in office for only a couple of years on average. The third advantage enjoyed 
by civil servants is that they are full-time policy advisers, while ministers are only 
part-time departmental bosses. The other demands on their time and energy include 
cabinet and cabinet-committee duties, sometimes parliamentary responsibilities 
and constituency work, media appearances, attendance at ceremonial and public 
functions, and foreign visits and summitry. However dedicated, tenacious and 
resourceful ministers may be, their role is therefore restricted to the offering of 
strategic guidance, knowing that much of the detail of policy and operational matters 
must be left to appointed officials.
Status and expertise
The final source of bureaucratic power is the status and respect that is often accorded 
to civil servants. This stems principally from their expertise and specialist knowledge. 
In many systems, senior bureaucrats are regarded as a meritocratic elite, and are 
invested with responsibility for the national interest. This is certainly reflected in an 
emphasis on merit and achievement in the recruitment and training of civil servants. 
Top German civil servants, for instance, are recruited by competitive examination 
from the ranks of university graduates, usually in law, and then endure a rigorous 
three-year training programme followed by a second state examination. In France, 
the École Nationale d’Administration was set up specifically to recruit and train the 
nation’s top generalist civil servants, thus supplementing the work of schools such as 
the École Polytechnique, which turns out technical experts.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 419 23-07-2024 12:55:38420 POLITICS
In comparison, governments and ministers often come into office ill-prepared, 
and in need of advice and support. Although governments are formed on the 
basis of party programmes and manifestos, they depend on civil servants to 
translate broad policy goals into practical and workable legislative programmes. 
This problem is particularly acute because of the mismatch between the skills 
and attributes required to win elective office and those needed to run an effective 
administration. In parliamentary systems in particular, ministers are appointed 
from an unusually small pool of talent (the members of the majority party or 
parties in the legislature), and it is rare for them to have either specialist knowledge 
of their departmental remit, or previous experience of administering a large-scale 
organization.
How can bureaucrats be controlled?
The perceived need to control the bureaucracy reflects a wide range of concerns. 
Most importantly, unchecked bureaucratic power spells the demise of representative 
and responsible government. For political democracy to be meaningful, appointed 
officials must, in some way, be accountable to politicians who, in turn, are accountable 
to the general public. Indeed, one of the long-standing criticisms of liberal democracy 
is that, behind the façade of party competition and public accountability, lies the 
entrenched power of bureaucrats who are responsible to no one. Guarantees against 
corruption, maladministration and the arbitrary exercise of government power 
must therefore be established.
Political control is also required because of the need to promote efficiency in 
a bureaucracy that may be bent on maintaining its professional comforts and 
material security, and because of the need for administrative coordination to resist 
the centrifugal pressures of ‘departmentalism’. Bureaucrats themselves may argue 
that external control is unnecessary in view of the self-discipline imposed by strict 
professional standards and a deeply ingrained public service ethos, especially in 
permanent civil services such as those found in Germany, France, India and the UK. 
On the other hand, such a civil service culture may be part of the problem, rather 
than part of the solution: it may entrench a lofty arrogance based on the belief that 
‘bureaucrats know best’. The principal forms of control over bureaucracies can be 
classified as follows:
 the creation of mechanisms of political accountability
 the politicization of the civil service
 the construction of counter-bureaucracies.
Political accountability
State bureaucracies can be made accountable to the political executive, the legislature, 
the judiciary or the public. The political executive is easily the most important of 
these bodies, because of its overall responsibility for government administration 
and its close working relationship with the civil service. The most elaborate system 
of executive control has been found in state socialist regimes such as China, where 
Maladministration:
Bad administration; the 
improper use of powers, 
biased application of 
rules, failure to follow 
procedures or simple 
incompetence.
CONCEPT
Departmentalism
Departmentalism 
refers to centrifugal 
pressures within a 
governmental structure 
that strengthen the 
identity of individual 
departments and 
agencies. Agencies 
are thus able to pursue 
their own separate 
interests, and resist both 
political control and 
broader administrative 
disciplines. The 
distinctive culture of 
a government agency 
is shaped by factors 
such as its policy 
responsibilities, the 
collective interests of its 
body of officials and the 
interests of the client 
groups that it serves. 
Departmentalism also 
operates through the 
tendency of ministers 
and senior officials to 
‘go native’, by being 
absorbed into the 
department’s culture.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 420 23-07-2024 12:55:38PUBLIC POLICY AND THE BUREAUCRACY 421
a hierarchically structured network of party organs has been constructed to run 
parallel to, and exercise supervision over, the state administration. However, so 
complex and extensive is the machinery of government in such regimes that even 
the pervasive influence of a ‘leading’ party fails to prevent the bureaucracy from 
developing interests of its own, or acting as conduits through which economic, social 
and regional interests are expressed.
In liberal democracies, especially those with parliamentary executives, political 
control depends largely on respect for the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. This 
holds that ministers alone are responsible to the legislature for the actions of their 
officials and the policies pursued by their departments. Ministerial responsibility 
has been developed in its most extreme form in the UK, where it is taken to imply 
that civil servants have an exclusive responsibility to their minister and, therefore, 
to the government of the day. The ability of this doctrine to deliver political control 
is, nevertheless, hampered by three factors. First, as discussed above, the expertise, 
size and complexity of modern bureaucracies make effective ministerial oversight 
virtually impossible. Second, ministers have been unwilling to sacrifice their political 
careers by resigning as a result of blunders made by officials (or themselves), and 
prime ministers have been reluctant to encourage resignations that will attract 
adverse publicity. Third, legislatures usually lack the expertise and political will to 
subject either ministers or civil servants to effective scrutiny.
Bureaucrats, however, can be made accountable to the public in a number of ways, 
formal and informal. One method – Scandinavian in origin, but later extended in 
different variations to other countries – is the ombudsman system. An ombudsman 
is an official charged to investigate complaints and grievances, usually against the 
government, bureaucracy or large institutions on behalf of the public. In some states 
auditors-general and inspectors-general may also exist, who have independent 
powers to audit the performance of government agencies and bureaucrats. The 
effectiveness of these institutions varies depending on their powers and resources. In 
Taiwan, for instance, the Control Yuan is a twenty-nine-member commission with 
a large staff and broad constitutional powers to audit, censure and even impeach 
government officials. In other jurisdictions, the position may rely more on generating 
public attention to create pressure. While serving as Serbian ombudsman between 
2007 and 2017, Saša Janković uncovered significant cases of bureaucratic misconduct 
but had few formal powers to pursue them, and instead used the media to publicize 
the incidents to try and shame the government.
Bureaucrats recognize that, regardless of the mechanisms of formal accountability, 
their status and public standing can be damaged by the exposure of scandals, 
corruption and administrative ineptitude. The publicity given to the Watergate affair 
in the USA in the 1970s thus led to tighter oversight of US government agencies such 
as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI). Similarly, the French newspaper Le Monde played a significant role in exposing 
the sinking in 1985 of the Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior, thus contributing 
to the resignation of the defence minister. On the other hand, such investigations 
can be severely hampered by the culture of secrecy that usually pervades state 
administration, and by the absence of open government.
CONCEPT
Ministerial 
responsibility
The doctrine of 
ministerial responsibility 
(‘individual’ responsibility) 
defines the relationship 
between ministers and 
their departments. The 
doctrine is observed 
in most parliamentary 
systems, and has two key 
features. First, ministers 
are responsible for the 
acts and omissions of 
their departments, 
maintaining the 
fiction that ministers 
themselves make all the 
decisions taken in their 
name. Second, ministers 
are accountable to the 
legislature, in the sense 
that they are answerable 
for anything that goes 
on in their departments, 
and are removable in the 
event of mistakes made 
by their civil servants.
CONCEPT
Ombudsman
An ombudsman is an 
officer of the state 
who is appointed to 
safeguard citizens’ rights 
in a particular sector and 
investigate allegations of 
maladministration (ranging 
from the improper use of 
powers to the failure to 
follow procedures) and 
simple incompetence. The 
role of an ombudsman 
is to supplement, not 
replace, normal avenues 
of complaints such as 
administrative courts or 
elected representatives.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 421 23-07-2024 12:55:38422 POLITICS
Politicization
One of the most common ways of exercising political control is to recruit the senior 
bureaucracy into the ideological enthusiasms of the government of the day. This 
effectively blurs the distinctions between politics and administration, and between 
politicians and public officials. Control is overtly accomplished through a system of 
political appointments. A spoils system (see p. 413) was introduced in the USA by 
Andrew Jackson in the early nineteenth century, when he replaced about 20 per cent 
of the federal civil service with his own supporters. Though civil service reform in 
the late nineteenth century significantly improved the situation, it is still true that 
when there is a new US president, the administration changes. Some 3,000 top posts 
are filled by political appointees, although fewer than 200 are likely to be made by 
president personally – the majority are likely to be career bureaucrats promoted 
from within.
The most extreme versions of the spoils system can be found in nations where 
democratic norms are fragile or regimes are unstable, in which government jobs are 
used as rewards to key political supporters and as a tool of maintaining control, while 
coups or transitions of power have seen much of the civil service purged. But creeping 
politicization has also become a feature of many states even with well-established 
traditions of civil service independence. For instance, in France, approximately 500 
senior posts are now filled at the discretion of leading government figures, and, since 
the 1980s, those appointed have usually had a highly partisan profile, or have been 
linked personally or politically with senior politicians. The French higher civil service, 
therefore, now resembles a patchwork of politicized clans, rather than a unified body 
standing above party politics.
The attraction of a politicized senior bureaucracy is plainly that it ensures that there 
is a higher level of loyalty and commitment in such a group than would be likely 
amongst politically impartial civil servants. Moreover, those observers who believe 
that neutrality is always a myth, arguing that some kind of political bias is inevitable in 
the state bureaucracy, generally hold that a system of overt politicization is preferable 
to one of covert politicization. However, political commitment also brings serious 
disadvantages. In the first place, politicization strikes at the very heart of the idea of 
a professional and permanent civil service. Once bureaucrats are selected on political 
grounds by the government of the day, or encouraged to share their ideological 
sympathies, their appointments become as temporary as those of their political 
masters. This, in turn, means that knowledge and experience are not accumulated 
over a number of governments, and, as in the USA for example, that a change in 
administration brings about a major breach in the continuity of government. 
Furthermore, it is difficult to have both political commitment and meritocracy 
within the civil service. In a politicized service, not only are appointments made on 
the basis of political affiliation and personal loyalty, rather than ability and training, 
but it may also be more difficult to attract high-calibre staff to work in temporary 
positions that offer no form of job security. A more insidious danger is that ideological 
enthusiasm may blind civil servants to the drawbacks and disadvantages of policy 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_16.indd 422 23-07-2024 12:55:38PUBLIC POLICY AND THE BUREAUCRACY 423
proposals. From this point of view, the virtue of neutrality is that it establishes an 
‘arm’s length’ relationship between bureaucrats and politicians, allowing the former 
to see the weaknesses, as well as the strengths, of the policy options they are required 
to examine.
Counter-bureaucracies
The final mechanism of political control is through structures designed to support or 
assist politicians, or to act as a counterweight to the official bureaucracy. The simplest 
such system is the use of political advisers or ‘outsiders’, which is now a feature of 
almost all modern states. More significantly, institutions of various kinds have been 
established to share ministers’ workloads and provide them with personal advisory 
staff. In the UK, this role is largely played by the Prime Minister’s Office, which is 
composed of a collection of senior officials and political advisers (numbering over 100) 
who advise the prime minister about policy and implementation, communications, 
party management and government relations. Of more general application is the 
device of the cabinet ministériel. These have long been established in France and have 
been taken up in states such as Italy and Austria, as well as by the EU. Cabinets are 
ministers’ personal teams of advisers (in France, usually 15–20 strong) that help to 
formulate policy, assist in supervising departmental activities and help ministers to 
carry out their various other responsibilities. The idea of a counter-bureaucracy has 
been most elaborately developed in the USA, in the form of the Executive Office of 
the President (EOP). This was established in 1939 by President Roosevelt following 
the Brownlow Committees’ declaration that ‘the President needs help’. The EOP is 
the president’s personal bureaucracy. It consists of a growing number of councils and 
offices, and employs about 1,400 staff. Its key agencies include the White House Office, 
which comprises the president’s closest political advisers; the Office of Management 
and Budget, which assists in the preparation of budgetary and legislative proposals; 
the National Security Council (NSC), which advises on defence and foreign affairs 
issues; and the Council of Economic Advisors, which provides the president with 
professional advice on economic policy.
The purpose of counter-bureaucracies is to compensate for the imbalance in the 
relationship between amateur, temporary and outnumbered politicians and their 
expert, permanent and professional officials. However, this form of political control 
has its drawbacks. In the case of the EOP, it leads to the duplication of government 
agencies, and so causes jurisdictional conflicts and a measure of bureaucratic in￾fighting. This has been particularly evident in the often-fraught relationship between 
the National Security Council and the State Department. A further difficulty is that 
allowing politicians to surround themselves with hand-picked advisers creates the 
danger that they will cut themselves off from political reality and be told only what 
they want to hear. This problem was highlighted in the USA by both the Watergate 
and the Iran–Contra affairs, when the respective presidents, Nixon and Reagan, 
became over-dependent on EOP advisers, partly because they believed that they 
could neither trust nor control an essentially hostile federal bureaucracy.

CHAPTER 17
MULTILEVEL 
POLITICS
PREVIEW
The nation-state has traditionally been viewed as the natural, and perhaps only legitimate, unit of political rule. 
Domestic politics therefore centred on the activities of the national government, while, in international politics, 
nation-states have been treated as discreet and unified entities. However, globalization and other developments 
have contributed to a process through which political authority has been both ‘sucked up’ and ‘drawn down’, creating 
what is called ‘multilevel governance’. States have always incorporated a range of internal divisions and levels of 
power; most significantly, territory-based divisions between central or national government and various forms of 
provincial, city or local government. These divisions are crucially shaped by a state’s constitutional structure; that 
is, by whether it has a federal or unitary system of government. Although each provides a distinct framework within 
which centre–periphery relationships can be conducted, both have been subject, in recent years, to a combination 
of centrifugal and centripetal pressures. At the same time, a trend towards transnational regionalism has emerged 
out of the fact that states are increasingly confronted by challenges that even the most powerful state struggles 
to meet on its own. This has created the spectre of an emerging ‘world of regions’. In this view, regionalism is both 
the successor to the nation-state and an alternative to globalization. Without doubt, the most advanced example 
of regionalism found anywhere in the world is the European Union (EU), but this raises questions about whether 
the EU regional model is exportable and, indeed, whether it is viable.

POLITICS, TERRITORY AND MULTILEVEL 
GOVERNANCE
Politics has always had a spatial, or territorial, dimension. As political rule involves 
making and enforcing general rules over a particular population, this must imply 
taking account of where those people live, even if their location is imprecise or 
shifting (as in the case of a nomadic tribe). The association between politics and 
territory became more formalized and explicit from the sixteenth century onwards, 
as a result of the emergence of the modern state. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) 
defined sovereignty (see p. 64) in territorial terms, and states were seen to be defined 
by their ability to exercise independent control over all the institutions and groups 
that live within their territorial borders. Two further developments consolidated the 
importance of territory. The first of these was the emergence of nationalism from 
the late eighteenth century onwards. As nationalist doctrines spread, so did the idea 
that national communities are, in part, forged by their sense of having a ‘homeland’. 
As states evolved into nation-states, territory therefore became a matter not just of 
legal jurisdiction but also one of identity and emotional attachment. The second 
development was the strengthened association between national power with territorial 
expansion that was brought about by imperialism (see p. 480). Political power is always 
linked to the control of territory because it allows rulers both to extract resources 
and to control geographically defined populations. European colonialism in Africa 
and Asia during the nineteenth century was motivated by a heightened sense of this 
link, encouraging some to argue that the destiny of states is essentially determined by 
geographical factors. This gave rise to the discipline of ‘geopolitics’, which explores the 
relationship between political power and territorial control.
Nevertheless, the unity and coherence of established nation-states, as well as their 
ability to maintain territorial sovereignty, have both been compromised in recent 
decades. Although the expansion of the state’s economic and social responsibilities 
during much of the twentieth century had helped to fuel political centralization, 
in the 1960s and 1970s countervailing forces emerged, particularly through the 
tendency to redefine identity on the basis of culture or ethnicity, as discussed in 
Chapter 8. This was evident in the emergence ethnic nationalism that sprang up 
in places such as Quebec in Canada, Scotland and Wales in the UK, Catalonia and 
the Basque area in Spain, Corsica in France and Flanders in Belgium. In former 
colonies and settler societies, indigenous movements have increasingly advocated 
for land rights and greater self-determination. As the pressure for political 
decentralization has grown, major constitutional upheavals have been precipitated 
in a number of states. Some of these struggles have triggered a major reassessment 
of national identity, suggesting, perhaps, that nationalism was being displaced by 
multiculturalism (see p. 205).
The process through which political authority has been ‘pulled down’ within the 
state has been complemented by a tendency for political authority also to be ‘sucked 
up’ beyond the state, especially through the creation, or strengthening, of regional 
organizations. This has occurred, first, through a substantial growth in cross-border, 
or transnational, flows and transactions – movements of people, goods, money, 
information and ideas. In other words, state borders have become increasingly

‘porous’, a development particularly associated with ‘accelerated’ globalization (see 
p. 182) since the 1980s. The second development, linked to the first, is that relations 
among states have come to be characterized by growing interdependence (see p. 490)
and interconnectedness. Tasks such as promoting economic growth and prosperity, 
tackling global warming, halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction and 
coping with pandemic diseases are impossible for any state to accomplish on its 
own, however powerful it may be. States, in these circumstances, are forced to 
work together, relying on collective efforts and energies. The combination of these 
processes, through which an increasing burden of political decision-making has been 
made both ‘above’ and ‘below’ the national level, has helped to reshape territorial 
politics and generate interest in the phenomenon of multilevel governance. This 
could best be examined by looking, respectively, at the governance processes that 
operate at the subnational level and at the transnational level.
SUBNATIONAL POLITICS
All modern states are divided on a territorial basis between central (national) 
and peripheral (regional, provincial or local) institutions. The balance between 
centralization and decentralization is shaped by a wide range of historical, cultural, 
geographical, economic and political factors. The most prominent of these is the 
constitutional structure of the state, particularly the location of sovereignty in the 
political system. Although modified by other factors, the constitutional structure 
provides, as a minimum, the framework within which centre–periphery relationships 
are conducted. The two most common forms of territorial organization found in the 
modern world are the federal and unitary systems. A third form, confederation, has 
generally proved to be unsustainable. As confederations establish only the loosest and

Geopolitics is an 
approach to foreign

relationships and 
significance of states in 
terms of geographical 
factors such as location, 
climate, natural 
resources, physical 
terrain and population. 
Key exponents of 
geopolitics include Alfred 
Mahan (1840–1914), 
who argued that the 
state that controls the 
seas would control world 
politics, and Halford 
Mackinder (1861–1947), 
who suggested that 
control of the land mass 
between Germany 
and central Siberia is 
the key to controlling 
world politics. The 
advance of globalization 
is sometimes seen to 
have made geopolitics 
obsolete.

most decentralized type of political union by vesting sovereign power in peripheral 
bodies, it is not surprising that their principal advocates have been anarchists such 
as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (see p. 429). The confederal principle is, in fact, most 
commonly applied in the form of intergovernmentalism (see p. 446), as embodied in 
international organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 
the United Nations (UN), the African Union (AU) and the Commonwealth of Nations. 
Modern examples of confederations at the nation-state level are, however, far rarer. The 
USA was originally a confederation, first in the form of the Continental Congresses 
(1774–81), and then under the Articles of Confederation (1781–9). Switzerland, too, 
was originally established as a confederation in the thirteenth century. However, the 
ever-increasing need for central governments capable of handling complex policy 
problems and managing national economies meant that by the eighteenth century 
nearly all such confederations had transformed into federations. In mid-twentieth 
century, several confederation projects were attempted, like the United Arab Republic 
(1958–61) which attempted a union of Egypt and Syria, and the Union of African 
States (1961–3) for Mali, Ghana and Guinea. However, these proved short-lived and 
half-hearted, as they were not able to reconcile the political, social and economic 
differences between the member states.
Federal systems

is a complex policy 
process in which political 
authority is distributed 
at different levels of 
territorial aggregation. 
The ‘vertical’ conception 
of multilevel governance 
takes account of the 
interdependence 
of actors in the 
policy process at 
subnational, national 
and transnational levels, 
creating a fluid process 
of negotiation. Much 
of the complexity of 
multilevel governance 
derives from ‘horizontal’ 
developments such 
as the growth of 
relationships between 
states and non￾state actors, and the 
emergence of new 
forms of public–private 
partnership.

structures are identical, the central feature of each is a sharing of sovereignty 
between central and peripheral institutions. This ensures, at least in theory, that 
neither level of government can encroach on the powers of the other (see Figure
17.1). In this sense, a federation is an intermediate form of political organization 
that lies somewhere between a confederation (which vests sovereign power 
in peripheral bodies) and a unitary state (in which power is located in central 
institutions). Federal systems are based on a compromise between unity and 
regional diversity, between the need for an effective central power and the need for 
checks or constraints on that power.
KEY THINKER
PIERRE-JOSEPH PROUDHON (1809–65)
French anarchist. A largely self-educated printer, Proudhon was drawn into radical politics 
in Lyons before settling in Paris in 1847. As a member of the 1848 Constituent Assembly, 
Proudhon famously voted against the constitution ‘because it was a constitution’. He was later 
imprisoned for three years, after which, disillusioned with active politics, he concentrated on 
writing and theorizing. His best-known work, What is Property? (1840), developed the first 
systematic argument for anarchism, based on the ‘mutualist’ principle; it also contained the 
famous dictum ‘property is theft’. In The Principle of Federation (1863), Proudhon modified his 
anarchism by acknowledging the need for a minimal state to ‘set things in motion’ (although 
by ‘federal’ he meant a political compact between self-governing communities – in effect, 
confederalism).

Why federalism?
When a list of federal states (or states exhibiting federal-type features) is examined, 
certain common characteristics can be observed. This suggests that the federal 
principle is more applicable to some states than to others. In the first place, historical 
similarities can be identified. For example, federations have often been formed by the 
coming together of a number of established political communities that nevertheless 
wish to preserve their separate identities and, to some extent, their autonomy 
(see p. 432).
This clearly applied in the case of the world’s first federal state, the USA. Although 
the thirteen former British colonies in America quickly recognized the inadequacy 
of confederal organization, each possessed a distinctive political identity and set 
of traditions that it was determined to preserve within the new, more centralized, 
constitutional framework. The reluctance of the former colonies to establish a 
strong national government was demonstrated at the Philadelphia Constitutional 
Convention of 1787, which drafted the US constitution, and by the ensuing debate 
over ratification. The ‘nationalist’ position, which supported ratification, was 
advanced in the so-called ‘Federalist Papers’, published between 1787 and 1789 
(Hamilton et al. ([1787–9] 1961). They emphasized the importance of establishing 
a strong centralized government while, at the same time, preserving state and 
individual freedoms. Ratification was finally achieved in 1789, but only through 
the adoption of the Bill of Rights and, in particular, the Tenth Amendment, which 
guaranteed that powers not delegated to the federal government would be ‘reserved 
to the states respectively, or to the people’. This provided a constitutional basis for 
US federalism.
A second factor influencing the formation of federations is the existence of an 
external threat, or a desire to play a more effective role in international affairs. Small, 
vulnerable states, for instance, have a powerful incentive to enter broader political 
unions. The willingness of the German states in the nineteenth century to enter into a 
federal union and accept effective ‘Prussification’ owed a great deal to the intensifying 
rivalry of the great powers, and, in particular, the threat posed by both Austria and 
France. Similarly, the drift towards the construction of a federal Europe, which began 
with the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952 
and the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957, was brought about, in part, 
by a fear of Soviet aggression and by a perceived loss of European influence in the 
emerging bipolar world order.
The final factor encouraging the adoption of federalism is cultural, linguistic and 
ethnic heterogeneity. Federalism, in short, has often been an institutional response 
to societal divisions and diversities. Nigeria, for instance, is a very diverse state, with 
several hundred ethnic groups and languages spoken, and major divide between a 
predominantly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. Nigeria’s thirty￾six states are constituted as co-equal with the federal government and attempt to 
provide self-governance for key ethnic and religious groupings in the country. 
Geographically large states tend to be culturally diverse and often possess strong 
regional traditions, thus many of the world’s largest nations, such as Russia, the United 
CONCEPT
Federalism
Federalism (from the 
Latin foedus, meaning 
‘pact’, or ‘covenant’) 
usually refers to legal 
and political structures 
that distribute power 
territorially within a 
state. Nevertheless, 
in accordance with its 
original meaning, it has 
been taken to imply 
reciprocity or mutuality 
(Proudhon 1863), 
or, in the writings of 
Alexander Hamilton 
and James Madison 
(see p. 384), to be part 
of a broader ideology 
of pluralism. As a 
political form, however, 
federalism requires the 
existence of two distinct 
levels of government, 
neither of which is 
legally or politically 
subordinate to the 
other. Its central feature 
is therefore shared 
sovereignty.

States, Brazil, India and Australia have federal structures. Canada’s ten provinces, 
for instance, reflect not only long-established regional traditions but also language 
and cultural differences between English-speaking and French-speaking parts of the 
country. The balance between federal and state powers is a complex one, though, and 
will not always satisfy regional demands.
Features of federalism
Each federal system is unique, in the sense that the relationship between federal 
government and state government is determined not just by constitutional rules 
but also by a complex mix of political, historical, geographical, cultural and social 
circumstances (Burgess and Gagnon 1993). In some respects, for example, the 
party system is as significant a determinant of federal–state relationships as are the 
constitutionally allocated powers of each level of government. Thus, the federal 
structure of the USSR, which unlike the USA granted each of its fifteen republics 
the right of secession, was illusory given the highly centralized nature of the ‘ruling’ 
Communist Party, to say nothing of the rigidly hierarchical central-planning system. 
And amongst more democratic federations, regional politics may be reflected in party 
politics to greater or lesser degrees. In the United States and Australia, for instance, 
the national two-party system is replicated in every state, and ‘national’ political 
issues between the parties are often (though not always) reflected in state politics 
as well. India, by contrast, has a strong history of regional parties who dominate 
the politics of a particular state and sometimes have an adversarial relationship with 
the national parties, and thus are more likely to fiercely defend local powers and 
prerogatives.
There is a further contrast between federal regimes that operate a ‘separation of 
powers’ (see p. 377) between the executive and legislative branches of government, 
and parliamentary systems in which executive and legislative power is fused. The 
former tends to ensure that government power is diffused both territorially and 
functionally, meaning that there are multiple points of contact between the two 
levels of government. This leads to the complex patterns of interpenetration between 
federal and state levels of government that are found in the US and Swiss systems. 
Parliamentary systems, however, often produce what is called ‘executive federalism’, 
most notably in Canada and Australia.
Nevertheless, certain features are common to most, if not all, federal systems:
 Two relatively autonomous levels of government: Both central government 
(the federal level) and regional government (the state level) possess a range of 
powers on which the other cannot encroach. These include, at least, a measure of 
legislative and executive authority, and the capacity to raise revenue; thus enjoying 
a degree of fiscal independence. However, the specific fields of jurisdiction of 
each level of government, and the capacity of each to influence the other, vary 
considerably. In Germany and Austria, for instance, a system of ‘administrative 
federalism’ operates in which central government is the key policymaker, and 
provincial government is charged with responsibility for the details of policy 
implementation.
Executive federalism:
A style of federalism in 
which the federal balance 
is largely determined by 
the relationship between 
the executives of each 
level of government.
Administrative 
federalism: A style of 
federalism in which 
central government is 
the key policymaker, and 
provincial government is 
charged with responsibility 
for policy implementation.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_17.indd 431 23-07-2024 12:58:44432 POLITICS
 Written constitution: The responsibilities and powers of each level of government 
are defined in a codified or ‘written’ constitution. The relationship between the 
centre and the periphery is therefore conducted within a formal legal framework. 
The autonomy of each level is usually guaranteed by the fact that neither is able 
to amend the constitution unilaterally; for example, in Australia and Switzerland 
amendments to the constitution must also be ratified by an affirmative referendum 
(see p. 248).
 Constitutional arbiter: The formal provisions of the constitution are interpreted 
by a supreme court, which thereby arbitrates in the case of disputes between federal 
and state levels of government. In determining the respective fields of jurisdiction 
of each level, the judiciary in a federal system is able to determine how federalism 
works in practice, inevitably drawing the judiciary into the policy process. The 
centralization that occurred in all federal systems in the twentieth century was 
invariably sanctioned by the courts.
 Linking institutions: In order to foster cooperation and understanding between 
federal and state levels of government, the regions and provinces must be given a 
voice in the processes of central policy-making. This is usually achieved through 
a bicameral legislature, in which the second chamber or upper house represents 
the interests of the states. The 105 seats in the Canadian Senate, for example, are 
assigned on a regional basis, with each of the four major regions receiving twenty￾four seats, the remainder being assigned to smaller regions.
Assessment of federalism
One of the chief strengths of federal systems is that, unlike unitary systems, they 
give regional and local interests a constitutionally guaranteed political voice. The 
states or provinces exercise a range of autonomous powers and enjoy some measure 
of representation in central government, usually, as pointed out above, through the 
second chamber of the federal legislature. On the other hand, federalism was not 
able to stem the general twentieth-century tendency towards centralization. Despite 
guarantees of state and provincial rights in federal systems, the powers of central 
government have expanded, largely as a result of the growth of economic and social 
intervention, and central government’s own greater revenue-raising capacities.
The US system, for instance, initially operated according to the principles of ‘dual 
federalism’. From the late nineteenth century onwards, this gave way to a system of 
‘cooperative federalism’ that was based on the growth of ‘grants in aid’ from the federal 
government to the states and localities. State and local government therefore became 
increasingly dependent on the flow of federal funds, a kind of fiscal federalism. 
There has also been a more forceful approach, ‘coercive federalism’, in which federal 
government has increasingly brought about the compliance of the states by passing 
laws that pre-empt their powers, and imposing restrictions on the states and localities 
in the form of mandates.
Such tendencies are usually not mere national power grabs, but like transnationalism 
(see p. 426), have been driven by the complexity of modern policy-making and the 
challenge of individual states in funding and coordinating large inter-state projects. 
Dual federalism: A 
style of federalism in 
which federal and state/
provincial government 
occupy separate and 
seemingly indestructible 
spheres of policy power.
Fiscal federalism: A style 
of federalism in which the 
federal balance is largely 
determined by funding 
arrangements, especially 
transfer payments 
from the centre to the 
periphery.
CONCEPT
Autonomy
Autonomy (from the 
Greek, meaning ‘law 
unto oneself’) literally 
means self-rule. 
States, institutions or 
groups can be said to 
be autonomous if they 
enjoy a substantial 
degree of independence, 
although autonomy 
in this connection is 
sometimes taken to 
imply a high measure 
of self-government, 
rather than sovereign 
independence. Applied 
to the individual, 
autonomy is closely 
linked to freedom (see p.
332). However, since it 
suggests being rationally 
self-willed, autonomy 
is classified as a form 
of positive freedom. 
By responding to inner 
or ‘genuine’ drives, the 
autonomous individual 
may be seen to achieve 
authenticity.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_17.indd 432 23-07-2024 12:58:44MULTILEVEL POLITICS 433
For instance, during the 1950s in many federal states the need to develop national 
highways to manage the economically vital flow of people and goods across nations 
created an imperative to centralize the management of what had traditionally been 
a regional matter.
A second advantage of federalism is that, in diffusing government power, it creates 
a network of checks and balances that helps to protect individual liberty. In James 
Madison’s (see p. 384) words, ‘ambition must be made to counteract ambition’. Despite 
a worldwide tendency towards centralization, federal systems such as those in the 
USA, Australia and Canada have usually been more effective in constraining national 
politicians than have been unitary systems. However, structures intended to create 
healthy tension within a system of government may also generate frustration and 
paralysis. One of the weaknesses of federal systems is that, by constraining central 
authority, they make the implementation of bold economic or social programmes 
more difficult. President Roosevelt’s New Deal in the USA, for example, was 
significantly weakened by Supreme Court decisions that were intended to prevent 
federal government from encroaching on the responsibilities of the states. Federal 
arrangements may also institutionalize and even deepen regional disparities. Poor 
states have fewer resources to serve their constituents than wealthy ones, and over 
time those gulfs may widen without national intervention. The state of Bihar, for 
instance, is the poorest in India, with more than half of its population living under 
the poverty line and a human development index more than 25 per cent lower than 
Kerala, in which less than 1 per cent of the population live in poverty.
Finally, federalism has provided an institutional mechanism through which fractured 
societies have maintained unity and coherence. In this respect, the federal solution 
may be appropriate only for a limited number of ethnically diverse and regionally 
divided societies but, in these cases, it may be absolutely vital. The danger of 
federalism, however, is that by breeding governmental division it may strengthen 
centrifugal pressures and ultimately lead to disintegration. The Comoros, a group of 
islands in the Indian Ocean, created a federal structure upon independence in the 
1970s as the only practicable way to manage the diverse interests of geographically 
separated entities with distinct local histories and identities. And yet, despite the 
relatively highly degree of autonomy granted to the constituent islands, there have 
been dozen of coups and several attempted successions largely driven by inter-island 
tensions. Some have argued, as a result, that federal systems are inherently unstable, 
tending either towards the guaranteed unity that only a unitary system can offer, or 
towards greater decentralization and ultimate collapse.
Unitary systems
The vast majority of contemporary states have unitary systems of government. These 
vest sovereign power in a single, national institution. In the UK, this institution is 
Parliament, which possesses, at least in theory, unrivalled and unchallengeable 
legislative authority. Parliament can make or unmake any law it wishes; its powers are 
not checked by a codified or written constitution; there are no rival UK legislatures that 
can challenge its authority; and its laws outrank all other forms of English and Scottish 
law. Since constitutional supremacy is vested with the centre in a unitary system, any 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_17.indd 433 23-07-2024 12:58:44434 POLITICS
system of peripheral or local government exists at the pleasure of the centre (see 
Figure 17.2). At first sight, this creates the spectre of unchecked centralization. Local 
institutions can be reshaped, reorganized and even abolished at will; their powers 
and responsibilities can be contracted as easily as they can be expanded. However, 
in practice, the relationship between the centre and the periphery in unitary systems 
is as complex as it is in federal systems – political, cultural and historical factors 
being as significant as more formal constitutional ones. Nevertheless, two distinct 
institutional forms of peripheral authority exist in unitary states: local government 
and devolved assemblies. Each of these gives centre–periphery relationships a 
distinctive shape.
Local government
Local government, in its simplest sense, is government that is specific to a particular 
locality; for example, a village, district, town, city or county. More particularly, it is a 
form of government that has no share in sovereignty, and is thus entirely subordinate 
to central authority – or, in a federal system, to state or regional authority. This level 
of government is, in fact, universal, being found in federal and confederal systems, 
as well as in unitary systems. In the USA, for instance, there are over 86,000 units of 
local government that employ 11,000,000 people, compared with a total of fewer than 
8,000,000 staff at federal and state levels. However, what makes local government 
particularly important in unitary systems is that, in most cases, it is the only form of 
government outside the centre.
It would, nevertheless, be a mistake to assume that the constitutional subordination 
of local government means that it is politically irrelevant. The very ubiquity of local 
government reflects the fact that it is both administratively necessary and, because 
it is ‘close’ to the people, easily intelligible. Moreover, elected local politicians have 
a measure of democratic legitimacy (see p. 86) that enables them to extend their 
formal powers and responsibilities. This often means that central–local relationships 
are conducted through a process of bargaining and negotiation, rather than by diktat 
from above. The balance between the centre and the periphery is further influenced 
by factors such as the political culture (particularly by established traditions of local 
autonomy and regional diversity) and the nature of the party system. For instance, 
the growing tendency for local politics to be ‘politicized’, in the sense that national 
parties have increasingly dominated local politics, has usually brought with it 
greater centralization. In the absence of the kind of constitutional framework that 
federalism provides, the preservation of local autonomy relies, to a crucial extent, on 
self-restraint by the centre. This tends to mean that the degree of decentralization in 
unitary systems varies significantly, both over time and from country to country. This 
can be illustrated by the contrasting experiences of the UK and France.
The UK traditionally possessed a relatively decentralized local government system, 
with local authorities exercising significant discretion within a legal framework 
laid down by Parliament. Indeed, respect for local democracy was long seen 
as a feature of the UK’s unwritten constitution. However, the pattern of local–
central relationships was dramatically restructured in the 1980s and 1990s, as the 
Local democracy: A 
principle that embodies 
both the idea of local 
autonomy and the goal of 
popular responsiveness.

Conservative governments of that period saw local government as an obstacle to 
the implementation of their radical market-orientated policies. Central control was 
thus strengthened as local authorities were robbed of their ability to determine their 
own tax and spending policies. Local authorities that challenged the centre, such as 
the Greater London Council and the metropolitan county councils, were abolished – 
their functions being devolved to smaller district and borough councils. The ultimate 
aim of these policies was fundamentally to remodel local government by creating 
‘enabling’ councils, whose role is not to provide services themselves, but to supervise 
the provision of services by private bodies through a system of contracting-out and 
privatization. Although later governments re-established a London-wide council, in 
the form of the Greater London Authority (2000), and supported the introduction 
of elected mayors for towns and cities, the overall shift in power from local to 
central government in the UK has not been reversed. Very different policies were 
nevertheless adopted in France over the same period.
During the 1980s, President François Mitterrand sought to dismantle the strict 
administrative control in regional government that operated largely through prefects 
(appointed by, and directly accountable to, the Ministry of the Interior), who were 
the chief executives of France’s ninety-six départements. The executive power of the 
prefects was transferred to locally elected presidents, and the prefects were replaced 
by Commissaires de la République, who are concerned essentially with economic 
planning. In addition, local authorities were absolved of the need to seek prior 
approval for administrative and spending decisions. The net result of these reforms 
was to give France a more decentralized state structure than it had had at any time 
since the 1789 revolution. Underpinning these developments was faith in the benefits 
of decentralization, reflecting the belief that political decisions should be made at the 
lowest possible level (see p. 436).

DEBATING . . .
SHOULD POLITICAL DECISIONS BE MADE AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE 
LEVEL?
Although all modern states are divided on a territorial basis, there is considerable debate about where the balance should 
lie between centralization and decentralization. Supporters of decentralization tend to argue that it is a core principle of 
democratic rule. But may local power only be achieved at the cost of efficient government and, maybe, social justice? 
YES NO
Boosting participation. Local or provincial government 
is a more effective agent of participation than central 
government. This is because far more people hold office 
at the local level than the national level, and even more 
are involved in standing for election or campaigning 
generally. By making political participation more 
attractive, devolving decision-making responsibility 
to lower levels helps to narrow the gap between the 
politically ‘active’ few and the ‘passive’ many.
Greater responsiveness. By being, quite literally, ‘closer’ 
to the people, peripheral bodies are more sensitive to 
their needs. This both strengthens popular accountability 
and ensures that government responds not merely to 
the general interests of society but also to the specific 
needs of particular communities. There is certainly a 
much greater chance that local or provincial politicians 
will have a personal knowledge of, and perhaps live in, the 
community they serve, bolstering their responsiveness.
Increased legitimacy. Physical distance from 
government affects the acceptability or rightfulness of 
political decisions. Decisions that are made at a local or 
provincial level are likely to be seen as intelligible, and 
therefore legitimate, whereas geographical remoteness 
engenders a sense of political remoteness, so weakening 
the binding character of political decisions. This is 
especially the case as centralized decision-making can 
only treat the public as an amorphous mass, rather 
than as a collection of different groups and different 
communities.
Upholding liberty. Decentralization and localism help to 
deter tyranny and, therefore, protect individual freedom. 
This happens because, as liberals emphasize, corruption 
increases as power becomes more concentrated, as 
there are fewer checks on politicians’ self-seeking 
inclinations. As political decisions are devolved to lower 
and lower levels, power is more widely dispersed and 
a network of checks and balances emerges. Strong 
peripheral bodies are more effective in checking central 
government power, as well as one another.
National disunity. Central government alone articulates 
the interests of the whole of society, rather than its various 
parts. While a strong centre ensures that government 
addresses the common interests and shared concerns, a 
weak centre allows people to focus on what divides them, 
creating rivalry and discord. Shifting political decision￾making to lower levels risks fostering parochialism and will 
make it more difficult for citizens to see the political ‘big 
picture’.
Uniformity threatened. Only central governments can 
establish uniform laws and public services that, for instance, 
help people move more easily from one part of the country 
to another. Geographical mobility, and therefore social 
mobility, are likely to be restricted to the extent that 
political decentralization results in differing tax regimes 
and differing legal, educational and social-security systems 
across a country. A lack of uniformity may also threaten the 
nationwide growth of businesses.
Inhibiting social justice. Devolving political decisions from 
the centre has the disadvantage that it forces peripheral 
institutions increasingly to rely on the resources available 
in their locality or region. Only central government can 
rectify inequalities that arise from the fact that the areas 
with the greatest social needs are invariably those with 
the least potential for raising revenue, and only central 
government has the resources to devise and implement 
major programmes of welfare provision. Decentralization 
therefore puts social justice at risk.
Economic development. Centralization and economic 
development invariably go hand in hand. Because of 
its greater administrative capacity, central government 
can perform economic functions that are beyond the 
capacity of local bodies. These include managing a single 
currency, controlling tax and spending, and providing an 
infrastructure in the form of roads, railways, airports and 
so on. Centralization also promotes efficiency because it 
allows government to benefit from economies of scale.

Devolution
Devolution, at least in its legislative form, establishes the greatest possible 
measure of decentralization in a unitary system of government – short, that is, of 
its transformation into a federal system. Devolved assemblies have usually been 
created in response to increasing centrifugal tensions within a state, and usually 
in an attempt to conciliate growing regional, and sometimes nationalist, pressures. 
Despite their lack of entrenched powers, once devolved assemblies have acquired 
a political identity of their own, and possess a measure of democratic legitimacy, 
they are very difficult to weaken and, in normal circumstances, impossible to abolish. 
Northern Ireland’s Stormont Parliament was an exception. The Stormont Parliament 
was suspended in 1972 and replaced by direct rule from the Westminster Parliament, 
but only when it became apparent that its domination by predominantly Protestant 
Unionist parties prevented it from stemming the rising tide of communal violence in 
Northern Ireland that threatened to develop into civil war.
One of the oldest traditions of devolved government in Europe is found in Spain. 
Although it has been a unitary state since the 1570s, Spain is divided into fifty 
provinces, each of which exercises a measure of regional self-government. As part 
of the transition to democratic government following the death of General Franco 
in 1975, the devolution process was extended in 1979 with the creation of seventeen 
autonomous communities. This new tier of regional government is based on elected 
assemblies invested with broad control of domestic policy, and was designed to 
meet long-standing demands for autonomy, especially in Catalonia and the Basque 
area, which maintain distinct ethnic and linguistic identities from the rest of 
Spain. The French government has also used devolution as a means of responding 
to the persistence of regional identities, and, at least in Brittany and Occitania, 
to accommodate forms of ethnic nationalism. As part of a strategy of ‘functional 
regionalism’, twenty-two regional public bodies were created in 1972 to enhance 
the administrative coordination of local investment and planning decisions. These, 
however, lacked a democratic basis and enjoyed only limited powers. In 1982, they 
were transformed into fully fledged regional governments, each with a directly 
elected council. The tendency towards decentralization in Europe has, however, also 
been fuelled by developments within the European Union (EU), and especially by the 
emergence since the late 1980s of the idea of ‘Europe of the Regions’. Regional and 
provincial levels of government have benefited from the direct distribution of aid 
from the European Regional Development Fund (1975), and have responded both 
by seeking direct representation in Brussels and by strengthening their involvement 
in economic planning and infrastructure development.
The UK was slower in embracing devolution. The revival of Scottish and Welsh 
nationalism since the late 1960s had put devolution on the political agenda (Bogdanor 
1979), but devolved bodies were not established until 1999. A system of ‘asymmetrical’ 
devolution was established. Legislative devolution operated in Scotland, through the 
Scottish Parliament’s ability to vary income tax and its primary legislative power; 
administrative devolution operated in Wales, as the Welsh Assembly had no control 
over taxation and only secondary legislative power; and so-called ‘rolling’ devolution 
was established in Northern Ireland, as the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly 
CONCEPT
Devolution
Devolution is the 
transfer of power from 
central government to 
subordinate regional 
institutions. Devolved 
bodies thus constitute 
an intermediate tier of 
government between 
central and local 
government. However, 
devolution differs from 
federalism in that 
devolved bodies have 
no share in sovereignty. 
In administrative 
devolution, regional 
institutions implement 
policies that are decided 
elsewhere. In legislative
devolution (sometimes 
called ‘home rule’), 
devolution involves the 
establishment of elected 
regional assemblies that

were linked to progress in the province’s ‘peace process’. Nevertheless, devolution in 
the UK quickly developed into a form of ‘quasi-federalism’, having gone beyond 
the simple handing down of power by a still sovereign Westminster Parliament. 
This has occurred because, although the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish bodies 
lack constitutional entrenchment, they enjoy a significant measure of democratic 
legitimacy by virtue of being popular assemblies that were set up following affirmative 
referendums. Moreover, the asymmetrical nature of UK devolution creates pressures 
for the ratcheting-up of devolved powers: the Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies 
have aspired to the powers of the Scottish Parliament, and the Scottish Parliament has, 
in turn, been encouraged to expand its powers in order to maintain its superior status. 
The Welsh Assembly thus acquired primary legislative powers in 2011, and, when the 
Scottish National Party (SNP) gained majority control of the Scottish Parliament in 
2011, it committed itself to holding a referendum on Scottish independence. When 
the referendum was held in 2014, it resulted in a defeat for independence, by a margin 
of 10 per cent.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
THE TIGRAY WAR: MULTILEVEL POLITICS AT ITS THORNIEST
Like many African nations, Ethiopia is a patchwork of 
diverse ethnicities, faiths, languages and cultures. Tensions 
and conflict between regional interests have been common 
throughout Ethiopian history, and most recently during 
the Tigray War of 2020–2, a complex multilevel conflict 
between Ethiopia, the Tigray region and the neighbouring 
nation of Eritrea.
The relationship between Tigray and Eritrea is very complex. 
Both regions are dominated by peoples who speak the 
Tigrinya language and are closely related historically and 
ethnically. However, the Tigray region is largely Christian, 
whilst Eritrea is predominantly Muslim, which has triggered 
a deep cultural split, despite linguistic and kinship ties. 
The creation of separate regional identities was further 
reinforced by colonization, as Eritrea was annexed by 
Italy as a colony in the nineteenth century, which brought 
economic development, Western influences and further 
cultural shifts, particularly in the capital Asmara. After 
decolonization, Eritrea was reabsorbed by Ethiopia, but 
the union proved unhappy, and a thirty-year struggle for 
independence ensued. Many Ethiopian Tigrayans, through 
the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), supported 
the Eritrean separatists, seeking greater independence 
for Tigray as well. Amidst separatist insurrections in 
other regions, the Ethiopian regime collapsed in 1993, 
and a political coalition led by the TPLF took power, with 
Eritrea gaining independence soon after as well. Within a 
few years, however, renewed conflict broke out over the 
Ethiopian – Eritrean border, which was difficult to define 
amidst a region with so much shared history. Another bitter 
war followed that now pitched Tigrayans against Eritreans. 
Several hundred thousand died, with Tigrayans making up 
the great majority of Ethiopian casualties.
The new Tigrayan Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi 
(1995–2012), introduced a model for the Ethiopian state 
called ethnic federalism. Nine new regional states were 
created, representing the major language and ethnic groups

TRANSNATIONAL REGIONALISM
Regionalism: its nature and growth
Types of regionalism
In general terms, regionalism is a process through which geographical regions become 
significant political and/or economic units. Regionalism has two faces, however. In 
the first place, it is a subnational phenomenon, a process of decentralization that 
takes place within countries, and is closely associated, as already discussed, with 
federalism and devolution. The second face of regionalism is transnational, rather 
than subnational. In this, regionalism refers to a process of cooperation or integration 
between countries in the same region of the world. An ongoing problem with 
regionalism has nevertheless been the difficulty in establishing the nature and extent 
of a region. What is a ‘region’? On the face of it, a region is a distinctive geographical 
area. Regions can therefore be identified by consulting maps.
This leads to a tendency to identify regions with continents, as applies in the case of 
Europe (through the EU), Africa (through the African Union, or AU) and America 
of Ethiopia, of which Tigray was one. Significant powers of 
self-government were granted, as was the unconditional 
right to secede from Ethiopia. Many government services 
were decentralized, and states were allowed to adopt 
their own official languages. Although touted as a solution 
to centuries of internal turmoil, many commentators 
observed that it only seemed to heighten separatist 
impulses. Moreover, as Ethiopia was largely a one-party 
state, the dominance of the ruling coalition federally and 
in most states undercut the actual independence enjoyed 
at the regional level.
In 2018, a transition of power occurred within the ruling 
party, and Abiy Ahmed became prime minister. Within 
months of taking office, Abiy began to negotiate with 
Eritrea on a peaceful path to end the long-running 
border conflict, ultimately relinquishing most of Ethiopia’s 
outstanding territorial claims. Though popular with much 
of the country, who wished to end the long and costly 
war, it was deeply unpopular amongst Tigrayans, many 
of whom had died fighting for the territory that was now 
being surrendered. Relations with Tigray worsened further 
as Abiy began to roll back ethnic federalism and centralize 
power – the TPLF, which had long dominated Ethiopian 
politics, left the governing coalition after Abiy attempted 
to merge it into a new national party. After Abiy delayed 
elections in 2020 during Covid-19, the TPLF claimed 
the federal government was no longer operating with a 
constitutional mandate and began obstructing federal 
officials from taking their posts in Tigray. War broke out 
soon after.
The Tigray War was soon being fought at many levels. 
Regionally, separatist groups in several other states, 
including Oromia and Sidama, joined forces with the TPLF, 
looking to protect or extend ethnic federalism against 
Abiy’s centralization push. Nationally, Ethiopia and Eritrea 
forswore old rivalries and now joined forces against Tigray, 
a bitter pill for many Tigrayans. Internationally, complex 
and sometimes conflicting politics came into play as 
well. Facing ethnic insurgencies of their own, and fearing 
a refugee crisis, most of Ethiopia’s other neighbours, 
including Djibouti and Somalia, supported the Ethiopian 
government against the Tigray region. Seeking greater 
influence in the region, several major powers, including 
China and Iran, supplied weapons to the Ethiopian 
government. Meanwhile, a blockade of the region by 
Ethiopian forces prevented food and humanitarian aid 
from entering, provoking denunciations from international 
bodies like Amnesty International and the United Nations.
Mediation by the African Union proved pivotal to the end 
of the conflict in 2022. Negotiated by Nigeria, Kenya, 
South Africa and the United States, the final treaty 
included renewed guarantees of autonomy for Tigray and 
the country’s ethnic federalism. However, with hundreds 
of thousands dead, and little more than a return to status 
quo negotiated, the many layers of conflict at play in Tigray 
remain largely unresolved.

(through the Organization of American States). However, many regional organizations 
are sub-continental, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), 
the Southern African Customs Unions and the Central American Common Market, 
while others are transcontinental, such as Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). An alternative basis 
for regional identity is socio-cultural, reflecting similarities of region, language, 
history or even ideological belief amongst neighbouring states. Cultural identity is 
particularly important in the case of bodies such as the Arab League and the Nordic 
Council, and it may also apply in the case of the EU, where membership requires an 
explicit commitment to liberal-democratic values.
Regionalism has taken a number of forms and been fuelled by a variety of factors. 
Security regionalism emerged in the early post-1945 period through the growth 
of regional defence organizations that gave expression to the new strategic tensions 
that were generated by the Cold War. NATO and the Warsaw Pact were the most 
prominent such organizations, although other bodies, such as the Southeast 
Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO), were also formed. Political regionalism has 
witnessed the construction of organizations such as the Arab League, which was 
formed in 1945 to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries; the 
Council of Europe, which was established in 1949 with the aim of creating a common 
democratic and legal area throughout the continent of Europe; and the Organization 
of African Unity (OAU), which was founded in 1963 to promote self-government and 
social progress throughout the African continent, and was replaced by the African 
Union (AU) in 2002. The most significant impetus towards transnational regionalism 
has undoubtedly been economic, however. Economic regionalism is therefore the 
primary form of regional integration and has become more so since the advent of 
so-called ‘new’ regionalism in the early 1990s.
Regionalism and globalization
‘New’ regionalism is manifest in the growth of regional trade blocs and the deepening 
of existing trade blocs. These agreements usually establish free trade areas through the 
reduction in internal tariffs and other barriers to trade; but, in other cases, they may 
establish customs unions, through the establishment of a common external tariff, or 
common markets (sometimes called ‘single markets’), areas within which there is a 
free movement of labour and capital, and a high level of economic harmonization. 
The advent of ‘new’ regionalism has nevertheless highlighted the complex, and 
sometimes contradictory, relationship between regionalism and globalization. As 
Bhagwati (2008) put it, regional trade blocs can operate as both ‘stumbling blocks’ and 
‘building blocks’ within the global system. Economic regionalism can be essentially 
defensive, in that regional organizations have sometimes embraced protectionism as 
a means of resisting the disruption of economic and, possibly, social life through the 
impact of intensifying global competition.
Nevertheless, regional trade blocs have also been motivated by competitive impulses, 
and not merely protectionist ones. In these cases, countries have formed regional 
blocs not so much to resist global market forces but, rather, to engage more effectively 
with them. Although states have wished to consolidate or expand trade blocs in the

Political regionalism:

same area to strengthen 
or protect shared values, 
thereby enhancing their 
image, reputation and 
diplomatic effectiveness.
Economic regionalism:

same region that are 
designed to create greater 
economic opportunities, 
usually by removing 
barriers to trade and 
developing common 
economic policies.

hope of gaining access to more secure and wider markets, they have rarely turned 
their back on the wider global market, meaning that regionalism and globalization 
are usually interlocking, rather than rival, processes.
Explaining regionalism
Wider explanations have also been advanced for the rise of regionalism. The earliest 
theory of regional, or even global, integration was federalism, drawing inspiration 
from its use in domestic politics. As an explanation for transnational regionalism, 
federalism relies on a process of conscious decision-making by political elites, 
attracted, in particular, by the desire to avoid war by encouraging states to transfer 
at least a measure of their sovereignty to a higher, federal body. This is often referred 
to as ‘pooled’ sovereignty. However, although a federalist vision is often said to have 
inspired the early process of European integration, federalism has had relatively little 
impact on the wider process of regional integration. Instead, even in the case of the 
European project, federalist thinking has had less impact than a functionalist road 
to integration. In the functionalist view, regional cooperation reflects the recognition 
that specific activities can be performed more effectively through collective action 
than by states acting individually. This also helps to explain why regional integration 
has a predominantly economic character, as this is the area in which the functional 
benefits of cooperation are most evident. The weakness of functionalism is, however, 
that it overemphasizes the willingness of states to hand over responsibilities to 
functional bodies, especially in areas that are political, rather than technical. 
Furthermore, there is little evidence that regional bodies are capable of acquiring 
a level of political allegiance that rivals that of the nation-state, regardless of their 
functional importance. As a result of these deficiencies, a growing emphasis has been 
placed on what is called ‘neofunctionalism’. Neofunctionalism has been particularly 
influential in explaining European integration, the most advanced example of 
regional integration found anywhere in the world.
Pooled sovereignty:
The sharing of decision￾making authority by 
states within a system of 
international cooperation, 
in which certain sovereign 
powers are transferred to

Functionalism: The 
theory that social and 
political phenomena can 
be explained by their 
function within a larger 
whole, implying that 
regional integration occurs 
because it has functional 
advantages over state 
independence.
Neofunctionalism: A 
revision of functionalism 
that recognizes that 
regional integration in one 
area generates pressures 
for further integration in 
the form of ‘spillover’.

European regionalism
The development of the EU
The ‘European idea’ (broadly, the belief that, regardless of historical, cultural and 
language differences, Europe constitutes a single political community) was born long 
before 1945. Before the Reformation in the sixteenth century, common allegiance to 
Rome invested the Papacy with supranational authority over much of Europe. Even 
after the European state system came into existence, thinkers as different as Rousseau 
(see p. 105), Saint-Simon (1760–1825) and Mazzini (see p. 155) championed the 
cause of European cooperation and, in some cases, advocated the establishment of 
Europe-wide political institutions. However, until the second half of the twentieth 
century aspirations to achieve this through consent (as opposed to military power, 
as in the case of Charlemagne and Napoleon) proved to be hopelessly utopian. Since 
the Second World War, Europe has undergone a historically unprecedented process 
of integration, aimed, some argue, at the creation of what Winston Churchill in 1946 
called a ‘United States of Europe’. Indeed, it is sometimes suggested that European 
integration provides a model of political organization that will eventually be accepted 
worldwide as the deficiencies of the nation-state become increasingly apparent. 
CONCEPT
Regionalism
Regionalism is the 
theory or practice of 
coordinating social, 
economic and political 
activities within a 
geographical region, 
which may either be part 
of a state (subnational 
regionalism) or 
comprise a number of 
states (transnational 
regionalism). On an 
institutional level, 
regionalism involves the 
growth of norms, rules 
and formal structures 
through which 
coordination is brought 
about. On an affective
level, regionalism implies 
a realignment of political 
identities and loyalties 
from the state to the 
region.

 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): This was established in 1967 by 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, with Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, 
Myanmar and Cambodia joining subsequently. ASEAN has attempted to promote 
a free-trade zone that would help south-east Asian states maintain their economic 
independence.
 Mercosur: The Mercosur agreement (1991) links Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and 
Uruguay with Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Guyana, Suriname and Bolivia as associate 
members. It is Latin America’s largest trade bloc, and operates as a free-trade union.
 Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS): Considered one of the 
most developed economic blocs in Africa, ECOWAS seeks to achieve ‘collective self￾sufficiency’ amongst its fifteen member states and has promoted economic integration, 
including introducing a single currency, the West African franc.

president (Ursula von der Leyen’s term of office as president began in 2019). It proposes 
legislation, is a watchdog that ensures that EU treaties are respected and is broadly 
responsible for policy implementation.

 The Council: This is the decision-making branch of the EU, and comprises ministers from 
the twenty-seven states who are accountable to their own assemblies and governments. 
Also known as the Council of Ministers, its presidency rotates amongst member states 
every six months. Important decisions are made by unanimous agreement, and others are 
reached through qualified majority voting or by a simple majority.
 The European Council: Informally called the ‘European Summit’, this is a senior forum in 
which heads of government, accompanied by foreign ministers and two commissioners, 
discuss the overall direction of the Union’s work. The European Council meets periodically 
and provides strategic leadership for the EU.
 The European Parliament: The EP is composed of 705 Members of the European 
Parliament (MEPs), who are directly elected every five years. Originally a scrutinizing 
assembly rather than a legislature, the passage of the Lisbon Treaty means that the EP 
now decides on the vast majority of EU legislation. The parliament is a co-legislator with 
the Council over matters including agriculture, energy policy, immigration and EU funds, 
with the parliament having the last say on the EU budget.
 The European Court of Justice: The ECJ interprets, and adjudicates on, European 
Union law. There are twenty-seven judges, one from each member state, and eleven 
advocates general, who advise the court. As EU law has primacy over the national law 
of EU member states, the court can ‘disapply’ domestic laws. A Court of First Instance 
handles certain cases brought by individuals and companies.

It is clear that this process was precipitated by a set of powerful, and possibly 
irresistible, historical circumstances in post-1945 Europe. The most significant of 
these were the following:
 The need for economic reconstruction in war-torn Europe through cooperation 
and the creation of a larger market.
 The desire to preserve peace by permanently resolving the bitter Franco-German 
rivalry that caused the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1) and led to war in 1914 and 
1939.
 The recognition that the ‘German problem’ could be tackled only by integrating 
Germany into a wider Europe.
 The desire to safeguard Europe from the threat of Soviet expansionism, and to 
mark out for Europe an independent role and identity in a bipolar world order.
 The wish of the USA to establish a prosperous and united Europe, both as a market 
for US goods and as a bulwark against the spread of communism.
 The widespread acceptance, especially in continental Europe, that the sovereign 
nation-state was the enemy of peace and prosperity.
To some extent, the drift towards European integration was fuelled by an idealist 
commitment to internationalism (see p. 156) and the belief that international 
organizations embody a moral authority higher than that commanded by nation￾states. However, more practical considerations, not least linked to economic 
matters, ultimately proved to be of greater significance. The European Coal and 
Steel Community (ECSC) was founded in 1952 on the initiative of Jean Monnet, 
adviser to the French foreign minister, Robert Schuman. Under the Treaty of Rome 
(1957), the European Economic Community (EEC) came into existence. The ECSC, 
EEC and Euratom (the body concerned with the peaceful use of nuclear energy) 
were formally merged in 1967, forming what became known as the European 
Community (EC). Although the community of the original ‘Six’ (France, Germany,

Pétain’s Vichy regime had been installed. Monnet took charge of the French modernization 
programme under de Gaulle in 1945, and in 1950 he produced the Schuman Plan, from 
which the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community 
were subsequently developed. Although Monnet rejected intergovernmentalism in favour of 
supranational government, he was not a formal advocate of European federalism.

Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) was expanded in 1973 with the 
inclusion of the UK, Ireland and Denmark, the 1970s was a period of stagnation. The 
integration process was relaunched, however, as a result of the signing in 1986 of the 
Single European Act (SEA), which envisaged an unrestricted flow of goods, services 
and people throughout Europe (a ‘single market’), to be introduced by 1993. The 
Treaty of European Union (the TEU or Maastricht treaty), which became effective 
in 1993, marked the creation of the European Union (EU). This committed the EU’s 
then-fifteen members (Greece, Portugal, Spain, Austria, Finland and Sweden having 
joined) to the principles of political union and monetary union (although Sweden, 
Denmark and the UK opted not to participate in monetary union). The centrepiece 
of this proposal was the establishment of a single European currency, the euro, which 
took place in 1999, with notes and coins being circulated in 2002. In 2004, the EU 
began its most radical phase of enlargement, as ten countries of Central and Eastern 
Europe and the Mediterranean joined, bringing about the reunification of Europe 
after decades of division by the Iron Curtain. Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007, 
and Croatia joined in 2013.
What kind of body is the EU?
The EU is a very difficult political organization to categorize. In strict terms, 
it is no longer a confederation of independent states operating on the basis of 
intergovernmentalism (as the EEC and EC were at their inception). The sovereignty 
of member states was enshrined in the so-called ‘Luxembourg compromise’ of 1966. 
This accepted the general practice of unanimous voting in the Council, and granted 
each member state an outright veto on matters threatening vital national interests. As 
a result of the SEA and the TEU, however, the practice of qualified majority voting, 
which allows even the largest state to be outvoted, was applied to a wider range of 
policy areas, thereby narrowing the scope of the national veto. This trend has been 
compounded by the fact that EU law is binding on all member states, and that the 
power of certain EU bodies has expanded at the expense of national governments. 
The result is a political body that has both intergovernmental and supranational 
features; the former evident in the Council, and the latter primarily in the European 
Commission and the Court of Justice. The EU may not yet have created a federal 
Europe, but because of the superiority of European law over the national law of the 
member states, it is perhaps accurate to talk of a ‘federalizing’ Europe.
As an economic, monetary and, to a significant extent, political union brought about 
through voluntary cooperation amongst states, the EU is a unique political body: the 
world’s only genuine experiment in supranational governance. The transition from 
Community to Union, achieved via the TEU, not only extended cooperation into 
areas such as foreign and security policy, home affairs and justice, and immigration 
and policing, but also established the notion of EU citizenship through the right 
to live, work and be politically active in any member state. This level of integration 
has been possible because of the powerful, and, some would argue, exceptional 
combination of pressures in post-1945 Europe that helped to shift public attitudes 
away from nationalism and towards cooperation, and to convince elites that national 
interests are ultimately better served by concerted action, rather than independence.
Political union: Although 
the term lacks clarity, 
it refers to the coming 
together of a number of 
states under a common 
government; can imply 
supranational governance.
Monetary union: The 
establishment of a single 
currency within an area 
comprising a number of 
states.
Veto: The formal power to 
block a decision or action 
through the refusal of 
consent.
Qualified majority voting:
A system of voting in 
which different majorities 
are needed on different 
issues, with states’ votes 
weighted (roughly) 
according to size.

Nevertheless, although the EU has done much to realize the Treaty of Rome’s goal 
of establishing ‘an ever closer union’, moving well beyond Charles de Gaulle’s vision 
of Europe as a confederation of independent states, it stops far short of realizing the 
early federalists’ dream of a European ‘superstate’. This has been ensured, partly, by 
respect for the principle of subsidiarity, embodied in the TEU, and by the pragmatic 
approach to integration adopted by key states such as France and Germany. Decision￾making within the ‘New Europe’ is increasingly made on the basis of multilevel 
governance, in which the policy process has interconnected subnational, national, 
intergovernmental and supranational levels, the balance between them shifting in 
relation to different issues and policy areas. This image of complex policy-making 
is more helpful than the sometimes sterile notion of a battle between national 
sovereignty and EU domination.
The EU in crisis
In 2008, as the global financial crisis reached its peak, the EU could still be seen as a 
remarkable success story, even as a model of regionalism that would, sooner or later, 
inevitably be adopted worldwide. Not only had the EU significantly ‘deepened’, as 
European integration was taken into areas not dreamed of elsewhere, but it had also 
‘widened’, expanding from its Western European origins into Central and Eastern 
Europe (Kelemen et al. 2016). In the process, the EU became the world’s largest 
trading bloc. The picture was far from uniformly positive, however. For example, 
long-standing challenges confronted the EU over matters such as how to resolve the 
tension between the organization’s ‘widening’ and ‘deepening’ agendas, as well as 
how to tackle its lack of public accountability, often seen as its ‘democratic deficit’. 
Some critics, indeed, went further, proclaiming that the EU is a fundamentally flawed 
political project, whose failure was just a matter of time. In this view, the level of 
diversity within the EU, in terms of history, traditions, language and culture, means 
that the EU can never match the capacity of the nation-state to engender loyalty and 
a sense of civic belonging, or to act effectively on the world stage. Such thinking has 
nevertheless received greater attention since 2008, as the EU has faced a series of 
daunting challenges. The most serious of these have been:
 the eurozone crisis
 the migration crisis
 the Brexit crisis.
Eurozone crisis
The eurozone crisis erupted as economic growth slowed and tax revenues contracted 
due to the Great Recession, which came in the wake of the 2007–9 global financial 
crisis. In the case of a number of weakly performing EU economies, these conditions 
pushed government debt up to unsustainable levels, requiring external intervention 
in the form of bailouts by the EU, the International Monetary Fund and the European 
Central Bank. This happened in Greece in 2010 and again in 2012, Ireland in 2010, 
Portugal in 2011, Spain in 2012 and Cyprus in 2013. In each case, the price of the 
bailout was the adoption of austerity policies (spending cuts and tax rises). At one

stage, matters became so serious in Greece that it looked as though the country 
would be forced to abandon the euro and, possibly, leave the EU itself.
For some, the eurozone crisis highlights the limitations and defects of the single 
currency project. In this view, transnational currencies are doomed because they 
do not have the flexibility to respond to disparate economies, operating according 
to different business cycles. In particular, underperforming eurozone economies 
wanting to stimulate growth are deprived of the ability to do so by devaluing their 
currency or lowering interest rates, as these are uniform across the eurozone. 
Nevertheless, although doubts continue to be voiced about the long-term viability of 
monetary union, the eurozone weathered this particular crisis without losing any of 
its members, and with a general acceptance that the best way of avoiding a repetition 
would be through stronger central control over fiscal decision-making.
Migration crisis
Although the principle of the free movement of people is embodied in the Treaty 
of Rome, the emphasis on free movement as a practical issue grew in tandem 
with the idea of the single market. The SEA thus stipulated that, along with goods, 
services and capital, workers must be able to move freely within the single market. 
Nevertheless, the implications of free movement tended to be restricted during the 
early decades of the organization’s existence by the fact that member states enjoyed 
broadly similar living standards. This, however, changed in 2004, with the accession 
of ten mainly post-communist states, followed by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 and 
Croatia in 2013. As these enlargements brought a group of relatively less prosperous 
states into the EU, they stimulated migratory flows from Eastern Europe generally 
to the more prosperous states of Central and Western Europe, spurred, in particular, 
by better employment prospects. Concurrently, migration from beyond Europe, 
particularly the Middle East and North Africa, has risen considerably in the past four 
decades, particularly to nations like France and the Netherlands. This has created 
tensions between those who seek to build a more ‘open’, multicultural society under 
an EU framework and those who wish to preserve of a Europe of more distinctly 
independent nation-states (Caldwell 2009). The concept of a ‘migration crisis’ began 
to emerge in 2015, when, in certain EU member states at least, migratory flows into 
Europe from beyond increased dramatically, particularly with the influx of refugees 
from Syria and other warzones in the Middle East.
Brexit crisis
The UK’s decision in 2016, made through a referendum, to leave the EU caused deep 
shock within the organization and beyond. It appeared to reverse a decades-old trend 
of enlargement, which, by 2013, had made the EU a twenty-eight-strong body, and 
confronted the EU with the prospect of its first contraction. The fact that the UK was 
at the time the world’s fifth largest economy, and second largest economy in the EU, 
made the likely damage to the EU’s prestige and its loss of ‘weight’ in international 
affairs all the more serious. What is more, critics of the EU were quick to claim 
that the process of the UK’s departure – or Brexit, as it became known – exposed a 
perhaps fatal structural flaw in the ‘European project’. This was that the integration 
process had been allowed to advance beyond the point at which it compromised state 
sovereignty, without ensuring public support for such a development. This could 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_17.indd 447 23-07-2024 12:58:45448 POLITICS
only lead to a building up of popular discontent, focused on EU institutions that lack 
legitimacy, and expressed through the demand to ‘take back control’ (see p. 189).
However, the greatest fear that Brexit provoked among EU leaders was the fear of 
‘contagion’, a rapid and uncontrolled spread of populist Euroscepticism from one 
member state to another, which could see the EU unravel from within. The EU sought 
to counter this possibility by ensuring, at minimum, that the UK’s trading position 
with the EU would not be more favourable after Brexit than it was before, thereby 
sending a message to other member states that may also consider withdrawal. Indeed, 
in some ways, the EU may benefit from the UK’s departure, which was finalized in 
2020. Not only did the ‘EU-27’ acquire a new sense of purpose in responding to the 
prospect of Brexit, but the development opened the possibility of the EU having a 
more cohesive future, its ‘awkward partner’ having departed. The fact that the UK 
had, for example, rejected the invitation to join the EEC in 1957, battled with the EC 
over its budget contribution in the 1980s and opted out of monetary union when the 
Treaty on European Union was being negotiated in 1991, perhaps demonstrates that 
the UK had never been reconciled to its identity as a European power.

PREVIEW
Security is the deepest and most abiding issue in politics. At its heart is the question: how can people live a decent 
and worthwhile existence, free from threats, intimidation and violence? The search for security is therefore linked 
to the pursuit of order; and for the establishment of relative peace and stability amongst individuals and groups 
with different needs and interests. These concerns are commonly thought to be resolved in the domestic realm by 
the existence of a sovereign state, a body capable of imposing its will on all the groups and institutions within its 
borders. Nevertheless, domestic security raises important issues, particularly about the roles of the institutions of 
the ‘coercive state’; the police and the military. However, the issue of security is often considered to be especially 
pressing in international politics because the international realm, unlike the domestic realm, is anarchical, and 
therefore threatening and unstable by its nature. There has been fierce theoretical debate about whether this 
implies that international conflict and war are inevitable features of world affairs, and about the extent to which 
states are able to keep war at bay through cooperation. These debates have become increasingly pressing due to 
the advent of new challenges to international security, such as the rise of transnational terrorism, the proliferation 
of nuclear weapons and the advent of cyberwarfare. Finally, growing interest in the concept of ‘human security’ has 
shifted attention from the security of the state to the security of the individual and, in the process, widened the 
notion of security to include, for instance, economic security, food security and personal security.

SECURITY BEYOND BOUNDARIES?
Although security, as the absence of danger, fear or anxiety, has a common character, 
a distinction is conventionally drawn between the maintenance of security in the 
domestic sphere and the maintenance of security in the international sphere. This 
implies that the domestic/international, or ‘inside/outside’, divide (discussed in 
Chapter 1) is of particular importance when it comes to security matters. From the 
‘inside’ of politics, security refers to the state’s capacity to maintain order within 
its own borders, using the instruments of the coercive state, such as the police and 
intelligence agencies, and at times, the military. Security, in this sense, deals with the 
relationship between the state and non-state actors of various kinds, ranging from 
criminal gangs to dissident groups and protest movements. In this respect, the state 
enjoys the great advantage that, in most cases, its sovereign power allows it to stand 
above all other associations and groups in society, ultimately by virtue of possessing 
a monopoly of the means of what Max Weber (see p. 87) called ‘legitimate violence’.
From the ‘outside’ of politics, security refers to the capacity of the state to provide 
protection against threats from beyond its own borders, especially the ability of its 
armed forces to fight wars (see p. 467) and resist military attack. Security, in this 
sense, has traditionally dealt with the state’s relationships with other states, reflecting 
the conventional assumption that only states possess the material and military 
resources to engage in warfare and, thereby, exert significant coercive influence on 
the international stage. However, whereas state sovereignty (see p. 64) supports the 
maintenance of security ‘inside’, it makes the maintenance of security ‘outside’ deeply 
problematic. As sovereignty means that there is no authority higher than the state, 
international politics is conducted in an environment that is anarchical, in the sense 
that it lacks enforceable rules or a pre-eminent power. It is commonly argued that 
this creates a bias in international affairs in favour of insecurity, rather than security.
Nevertheless, the ‘inside/outside’ divide in security matters has become increasingly 
difficult to sustain. This has been a result of recent trends and developments, not 
least those associated with globalization (see p. 182), which have seen a substantial 
growth in cross-border, or transnational, movements of people, goods, money, 
information and ideas. State borders may not have become irrelevant, but, in a 
technological age, they have certainly become more fragile or ‘porous’. This was 
dramatically demonstrated by the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 
11 September 2001. If the world’s greatest power could be dealt such a devastating 
blow to its largest city and its national capital, what chance did other states have? 
Furthermore, the ‘external’ threat in this case came not from another state but from a 
non-state actor, a terrorist organization that operated more as a global network than 
as a nationally based organization. Terrorist threats can originate from both within 
and beyond the state, and indeed across many different states, necessitating security 
measures and policy responses that can similarly cross those boundaries. And in 
some modern conflicts, like the Israel-Hamas conflict of 2023 or the Tigray War 
(see Chapter 17), the domestic and international divide becomes almost impossible 
to discern. In such conflicts, state, sub-state and non-state actors with varying and 
sometimes disputed degrees of sovereignty might be involved and may be receiving 
support both within and across political boundaries – boundaries which may 
themselves be in dispute.
Security: The condition 
of being safe from 
harm or threats, usually 
understood as ‘freedom 
from fear’, implying 
physical harm.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_18.indd 451 23-07-2024 12:59:51452 POLITICS
Moreover, the blurring of the domestic/international divide has widened the 
opportunities available to governments to frame security issues in ways that are 
politically or ideologically advantageous. Within days of 9/11, for instance, President 
George W. Bush portrayed the attacks as part of the ‘war on terror’, a term that 
dominated subsequent discourse about both the nature of the attacks themselves 
and how the USA and others should respond to them. By presenting 9/11 as an act 
of ‘war’, as opposed to a ‘crime’, it was lifted out of a domestic security frame and 
presented within an international frame. This, perhaps, served to prepare US public 
opinion, as well as the wider international community, for a response that had a 
clear international dimension, namely military intervention in Afghanistan and, for 
that matter, against any other country claimed to be implicated with ‘terror’. To have 
portrayed 9/11 as a criminal act would have been to suggest a more modest and 
focused response: namely, a police action against accused international murderers.
CONCEPT
Order
As a political principle, 
order refers to stable 
and predictable forms of 
behaviour and, above all, 
to those that safeguard 
personal security. 
Nevertheless, order 
has two very different 
political associations. 
Most commonly, it 
is linked with political 
authority and is thought 
to be achievable only if 
imposed ‘from above’ 
through a system of 
law. ‘Law and order’ 
thus become a single, 
fused concept. The 
alternative view links 
order to equality and 
social justice, and 
emphasizes that stability 
and security may arise 
naturally ‘from below’, 
through cooperation and 
mutual respect.
FOCUS ON . . . 
THE ‘WAR ON TERROR’
The ‘war on terror’ (or the ‘war on terrorism’), known in US policy circles as the Global War on 
Terror, or GWOT, refers to the efforts by the USA and its key allies to root out and destroy the 
groups and forces deemed to be responsible for global terrorism. Launched in the aftermath 
of 9/11, it supposedly mapped out a strategy for a ‘long war’ that addresses the principal 
security threats to twenty-first-century world order. It aimed to counter the historically new 
combination of threats posed by non-state actors and especially terrorist groups, so-called 
‘rogue’ states, weapons of mass destruction and the militant theories of radicalized Islam. 
Critics of the ‘war on terror’ argued that its inherent vagueness legitimized an almost unlimited 
range of foreign and domestic policy interventions, and that, in building up a climate of fear 
and apprehension, it allowed the USA and other governments to manipulate public opinion 
and manufacture consent for (possibly) imperialist and illiberal actions. Although declared to 
be over after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in late 2021, counter-insurgency operations 
are still ongoing in some parts of the world.
DOMESTIC SECURITY
The police and politics
The police force lies at the heart of the coercive state. The central purpose of a 
police force is to maintain domestic order. Police forces came into existence in the 
nineteenth century, largely as a result of the higher levels of social unrest and political 
discontent that industrialization unleashed. In the UK, a paid, uniformed, full-time 
and specially trained police force was established by Robert Peel in London in 1829, 
following the Peterloo Massacre of 1819 in Manchester, when cavalry had been used 
to break up a large but peaceful working-class demonstration. This type of police 
system was introduced throughout the UK in 1856 and was later adopted by many 
other countries. Although police forces and militaries are similar in that they are 
both disciplined, uniformed and (if to different degrees) armed bodies, important 
differences can be identified.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_18.indd 452 23-07-2024 12:59:51INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC SECURITY 453
In the first place, whereas the military’s essentially external orientation means that 
it is called into action only rarely (for example, in times of war, national emergency 
and national disaster), the police force’s concern with domestic order means that it 
has a routine and everyday involvement in public life. The police force is also more 
closely integrated into society than is the military: its members and their families 
usually live in the communities in which they work, although, as discussed below, 
a distinctive police culture often develops. Furthermore, the police typically use 
non-military tactics: because of their reliance on at least a measure of consent and 
legitimacy, they are either usually unarmed or their arms are primarily a form of 
self-defence. To some extent, however, modern developments have tended to blur 
the distinction between the police and the military. Not only have armed forces been 
called in to deal with domestic disorder, as during the Los Angeles riots of 1992, but 
some police forces have developed an increasingly paramilitary character. This is 
reflected in their access to progressively more sophisticated weaponry and, in many 
states, in their adoption of a quasi-military mode of operation.
There are three contrasting approaches to the nature of policing and the role that it 
plays in society:
 The liberal perspective regards the police as an essentially neutral body, the 
purpose of which is to maintain domestic order through the protection of 
individual rights and liberties. In this view, police forces operate within a broad 
consensus and enjoy a high measure of legitimacy, based on the perception that 
policing promotes social stability and personal security. The police are principally 
concerned with protecting citizens from each other. As policing is strictly 
concerned with upholding the rule of law (see p. 335), it has no broader political 
function.
 The conservative perspective stresses the police’s role in preserving the authority 
of the state and ensuring that its jurisdiction extends throughout the community. 
This view, which is rooted in a more pessimistic view of human nature, emphasizes 
the importance of the police as an enforcement agency capable of controlling 
social unrest and civil disorder. In this light, police forces are inevitably seen as 
mechanisms of political control.
 The radical perspective advances a much more critical view of police power. This 
portrays police forces as tools of oppression that act in the interests of the state, 
rather than of the people, and serve elites, rather than the masses. In the Marxist 
view, the police are seen specifically as defenders of property and upholders of 
capitalist class interests.
The role of the police force is also shaped by the nature of the political system in 
which it operates and the ways in which the government uses the police. Civil 
policing tends to be distinguished from political policing, and divisions are usually 
identified between liberal states and so-called ‘police states’.
Role of the police
Civil policing is the aspect of police work with which the general public is usually 
most familiar and which dominates the public image of the police force: the police 
force exists to ‘fight crime’. This process increasingly has an international character, 
Civil policing: The role 
of the police in the 
enforcement of criminal 
law.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_18.indd 453 23-07-2024 12:59:51454 POLITICS
brought about by the advent of major transnational criminal organizations associated, 
in particular, with drug-trafficking and people-trafficking. However, the routine 
process of maintaining civil order is very different when undertaken in, say, rural India 
than in modern cities such as New York, Paris and St Petersburg. It is widely accepted 
that while small and relatively homogeneous communities are characterized by a 
significant level of self-policing, this changes as societies become more fragmented 
(socially and culturally), and as large-scale organization depersonalizes relationships 
and interaction (see Chapter 9). The spread of industrialization in the twentieth 
century therefore brought about a measure of convergence in police organization 
and tactics in different parts of the world. Police forces everywhere tend to confront 
similar problems in the form of, for example, traffic infringements, car theft, burglary, 
street crime and organized crime.
However, contrasting styles of civil policing have been adopted. On the one hand, 
there is the idea of community policing. This system has traditionally operated in 
Japan. Japanese police officers are expected to know and visit the various families 
and workplaces that fall within their area of jurisdiction, operating either from 
police boxes (koban) or from residential police stations (chuzaisho). The success 
of this method, however, depends on the police being regarded as respected 
members of the local community and on citizens accepting that their lives will be 
closely monitored. Pressure for efficiency and cost cutting led to the phasing out of 
community policing in the UK and elsewhere in the 1960s and 1970s, with a shift 
towards what is called reactive policing. This emphasizes the capacity of the police 
to react to breaches of law when they occur, in the hope that crime will be prevented 
by the effectiveness of the police response. Reactive policing requires the adoption 
of harder, even paramilitary, tactics, and a greater emphasis on technology and arms. 
Pioneered in the early 1990s in New York, ‘zero tolerance’ policing has been widely 
adopted, formally or informally, in many parts of the world. Based on the so-called 
‘broken windows theory’, this relies on a strategy of strict enforcement in relation 
to minor offences (hence ‘zero tolerance’) in order to reduce levels of serious crime. 
It works on the basis that unrestrained petty crime creates the impression that no 
one is in control.
Policing can, nevertheless, be ‘political’ in two senses. First, policing may be carried 
out in accordance with political biases or social prejudices that favour certain 
groups or interests over others. Second, policing may extend beyond civil matters 
and impact on specifically political disputes. The first concern has traditionally been 
raised by radicals and socialists, who dismiss the idea that police forces (or any other 
state body) act in a neutral and impartial fashion. From this perspective, the training 
and discipline of the police force and the nature of police work itself tend to breed 
a culture that is socially authoritarian and politically conservative. The working 
classes, strikers, protesters, women and racial minorities are therefore likely to be 
amongst the groups treated less sympathetically by the police.
Despite mechanisms of public accountability and protestations of impartiality, 
there is undoubtedly evidence to support these allegations, at least in particular 
circumstances. The murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis in 
2020 set off a wave of protests internationally. Similar outcry followed the deaths of 
CONCEPT
Crime
A crime is a breach of 
criminal law, which is 
law that establishes the 
relationship between the 
state and the individual. 
Criminals (persons 
convicted of a crime) 
are usually seen as being 
motivated by self-gain 
of some kind, rather 
than broader political or 
moral considerations, 
as in the case of civil 
disobedience (see p.
313). However, the 
causes of, and remedies 
for, crime are hotly 
contested. The general 
divide is between 
those who blame 
individual corruption 
and place their faith in 
punishment, and those 
who blame deprivation 
and thus look to reduce 
crime through social 
reform.
Community policing: A 
style of policing in which a 
constant police presence 
in the community 
seeks to build trust and 
cooperation with the 
public.
Broken windows theory:
The theory that minor 
offences that are not 
speedily dealt with 
advertise that an area 
is not cared for and so 
lead to more, and more 
serious, offences.

Daunte Wright in New York 2021 and Nahel Merzouk in France in 2023, amongst 
numerous others. Cases such as these have been cited as examples of institutional 
racism, and representative of a dysfunctional policing culture that uses excessive 
and too-often lethal force against minority groups.
The level of political policing, meaning the use of the police as a political, rather 
than civil, instrument, has increased as societies have become more complex and 
fragmented. Some observers challenge the very distinction between civil and 
political areas of police work, arguing that all crime is ‘political’, in the sense that it 
springs from, and seeks to uphold, the established distribution of wealth, power and 
other resources in society. The neutrality of the police force in the eyes of the public 
is particularly compromised when it is used to control strikes, demonstrations and 
civil unrest that stem from deep divisions in society. The threat of terrorism (see 
p. 468), especially since the events of 11 September 2001, has drawn policing into 
some particularly difficult areas. Not only have many states strengthened national 
security legislation, but policing strategies have been adapted so as to take better 
account of particular threats posed by terrorism. Intelligence and surveillance have 
become increasingly essential tools for detecting and stopping threats to domestic 
security, but sometimes at the cost of personal privacy. Such developments have led 
to allegations that civil liberties have been compromised through the emergence of 
a national security state.
Police states
However, the widening of police powers has been taken further in so-called ‘police 
states’. In a police state, the police force operates outside a legal framework and is 
accountable to neither the courts nor the general public. Police states have totalitarian 
(see p. 78) features, in that the excessive and unregulated power that is vested in the 
police is designed to curtail civil liberty and create a climate of fear and intimidation 
in which all aspects of social existence are brought under political control. However, 
a police state is not run by the police force in the same way as a military regime is 
controlled by the armed forces. Rather, the police force acts as a private army that is 
controlled by, and acts in the interests of, a ruling elite. Syria, for instance, extensively 
monitors, intercepts and censors internet traffic to help the government track and 
trace enemies of the regime, reinforced by its general security, military intelligence 
and political security directorates, which have virtually unchallenged powers to 
arrest, detain and supress internal dissent.
At the same time, some states usually classified as ‘liberal’ have also found a role 
for the secret police. The CIA in the USA has certainly engaged in a range of covert 
external operations, including the 1973 Pinochet coup in Chile, several attempted 
assassinations of the Cuban leader Fidel Castro, and the supply of arms to Contra 
rebels who were fighting against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua in the 
1980s. It has also been subject to allegations of interference in domestic affairs, 
not least in the form of the still-unsubstantiated claim that it played a role in the 
assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. Terroristic policing was used in Northern 
Ireland in the late 1960s in the form of the B-Specials. This was an auxiliary unit of 
the Royal Ulster Constabulary formed to control civilian demonstrations and fight

the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The B-Specials engaged in partisan and routine 
intimidation of the Catholic community and were disbanded in 1969, but only as the 
British army took on a more prominent role in policing ‘the troubles’.
The military and domestic politics
The development of modern armed forces can be traced back to the period following 
the Middle Ages when European powers started to develop a standardized form 
of military organization, usually based on a standing army. During the nineteenth 
century, the military became a specialized institution with a professional leadership 
that was separate from the rest of society. European colonialism, in turn, ensured 
that this military model was adopted all over the world, turning the military into 
a near-universal component of state organization. Some small nations do not have 
armed forces, relying on security arrangements with other states. Only a handful of 
small nations, such as Saint Lucia, Grenada and Dominica, lack armed forces, having 
instead established collective security (see p. 462) arrangements through treaties. 
Costa Rica and Panama abolished their armies in the twentieth century, though their 
police have some paramilitary capabilities, and they enjoy security guarantees from 
the United States.
The military is a political institution of a very particular kind. Four factors 
distinguish the military from other institutions and give it a distinct, and at times 
overwhelming, advantage over civilian organizations. First, as an instrument of war, 
the military enjoys a virtual monopoly of weaponry and substantial coercive power. 
As the military has the capacity to prop up or topple a regime, its loyalty is essential 
to state survival. Second, armed forces are tightly organized and highly disciplined 
bodies, characterized by a hierarchy of ranks and a culture of strict obedience. They 
are, thus, an extreme example of bureaucracy (see p. 409) in the Weberian sense. 
Third, the military is invariably characterized by a distinctive culture and set of 
values, and an esprit de corps that prepare its personnel to fight, kill and possibly 
die. Sometimes portrayed as implicitly right wing and deeply authoritarian (by 
virtue of its traditional emphasis on leadership, duty and honour), military culture 
can also be grounded in creeds such as revolutionary socialism (as in China), or 
Islamic fundamentalism (as in Iran). Fourth, the armed forces are often seen, and 
generally regard themselves, as being ‘above’ politics, in the sense that, because 
they guarantee the security and integrity of the state, they are the ‘guardians’ of the 
national interest.
The character of particular armed forces is nevertheless shaped by internal and 
external factors. These include the history and traditions of the military and specific 
regiments or units, and the nature of the broader political system, the political 
culture and the values of the regime itself. For example, the political orientation of 
the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in China is deeply influenced by the decisive 
role it played in establishing the communist regime in 1949 and by strict party 
control at every level of the Chinese military. In Israel, the military enjoys an 
unusual position of trust and respect, based on its role in absorbing and socializing 
immigrants, and on its record of safeguarding the security of the Israeli state. Finally, 
although all militaries serve as instruments of war (examined later in the chapter), 
some militaries also play a major role in domestic politics.
CONCEPT
Civil liberty
Civil liberty refers to 
a private sphere of 
existence that belongs 
to the citizen, not 
the state. Civil liberty 
therefore encompasses 
a range of ‘negative’ 
rights (see p. 331),
usually rooted in the 
doctrine of human 
rights, which demand 
non-interference on 
the part of government. 
The classic civil liberties 
are usually thought to 
include the rights to 
freedom of speech, 
freedom of the press, 
freedom of religion and 
conscience, freedom of 
movement and freedom 
of association. These key 
freedoms are generally 
seen as vital to the 
functioning of liberal￾democratic societies.

Guarantee of domestic order
Although military force is usually directed against external entities and threats, it 
may also be a decisive factor in domestic politics. However, the circumstances in 
which militaries are deployed, and the uses to which they are put, vary from system 
to system and from state to state. One of the least controversial non-military tasks 
that armed forces may be called on to undertake is to act as an emergency service 
in the event of natural and other disasters. This type of involvement in domestic 
affairs is exceptional and is usually devoid of political significance. However, the 
same cannot be said of circumstances in which the armed forces are used to police 
domestic civil disturbances or disputes.
US troops, for instance, were deployed to implement federal racial desegregation 
orders during the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s. Similarly, in the UK in 
the 1970s and 1980s, the army was brought in during industrial disputes to provide 
emergency fire and ambulance services. Such actions provoke criticism, not only 
because the military is used in ways that encroach on responsibilities that usually 
belong to the police, but also because they compromise the traditional neutrality 
of the armed forces. This highlights the difficulty of distinguishing between the 
domestic use of the military as a ‘public’ instrument serving the national interest 
and its use as a ‘political’ weapon furthering the partisan goals of the government 
of the day. This distinction becomes still more blurred when the military is used to 
quell civil unrest or counter popular insurrection. Certain states confront levels of 
political tension and unrest that are quite beyond the capacity of the civilian police 
to contain. This occurs particularly in the case of serious religious, ethnic or national 
conflict. In such circumstances, the military can become the only guarantee of the 
integrity of the state, and may even be drawn into what may amount to a civil war 
to achieve this end. The Indian army has been used on a number of occasions to 
counter civil unrest and restore political order. These have included the eviction 
of Sikh separatists from the Golden Temple at Amritsar in 1984 at the cost of a 
thousand lives, and the seizure of Ayodhya from Hindu fundamentalists in 1992 
following the destruction of the Babri mosque. Russian troops were dispatched to 
the republic of Chechnya in 1994 to thwart its bid for independence in an operation 
that turned into a full-scale war, later developing into an ongoing guerrilla struggle.
In cases in which political legitimacy has collapsed altogether, the military may 
become the only prop of the regime, safeguarding it from popular rebellion or 
revolution. When this occurs, however, all semblance of constitutionalism (see p. 327)
and consent is abandoned, as the government becomes an outright dictatorship. 
During the Egyptian revolution in 2011, the unwillingness of the military to take 
action against rioters in Cairo and elsewhere eventually forced President Mubarak to 
step down and turn power over to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which 
prepared for the calling of elections. In 2013, however, in response to continued civil 
unrest and protests, this time in response to the new Muslim Brotherhood regime 
of Mohamed Morsi, the military acted to arrest the elected government and install 
a temporary military regime to restore order and hold new elections. As so often 
happens, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the head the army during these operations, 
was in turn installed as president and continues to rule with the backing of the 
armed forces he once led.

Alternative to civilian rule
The military’s capacity to intervene directly in domestic politics can lead, in extreme 
cases, to the establishment of military rule. Just as the military can prop up an 
unpopular government or regime, it can also remove and replace the governing 
elite, or topple the regime itself. The defining feature of military rule is that members 
of the armed forces displace civilian politicians, meaning that the leading posts in 
government are filled on the basis of the person’s position within the military chain 
of command. One version of military rule is the military junta. Most commonly 
found today in Africa, the military junta is a form of collective military government 
centred on a command council of officers whose members usually represent the 
three services (the army, navy and air force) (see p. 142). It is difficult, however, 
for military rule to exist in a stable and enduring political form. While military 
leaders may highlight the chronic weakness, intractable divisions and endemic 
corruption (see p. 414) of civilian government, it is unlikely that military rule will 
provide a solution to these problems, or that it will be perceived as legitimate, except 
during temporary periods of national crisis or political emergency. In January 2022, 
the military of Burkina Faso, frustrated by the ongoing failure to defeat a jihadist 
insurgency that had taken over more than a third of the country, staged a coup 
and removed the elected government, installing a military junta led by Paul-Henri 
Damiba. Yet Damiba’s regime proved even less effective at fighting the jihadists, 
and his legitimacy was so weak that a fellow officer, Ibrahim Traoré, staged another 
coup in September of that year and installed himself president. The new regime 
has similarly failed to make significant inroads against the insurgency. (For a more 
detailed account of military rule, see Chapter 5.)

INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
International security occupies a central position in the broader academic discipline 
of international relations (IR). Indeed, a recurrent theme in IR has been the search 
for ways of countering the risk, uncertainty and deep insecurity that are sometimes 
believed to be rooted in the international system itself. As pointed out above, such 
thinking is based on the principle of state sovereignty, which, in the domestic realm, 
implies order and stability (as no group or body can challenge the supreme authority 
of the state), but in the international realm implies disorder and possibly chaos (as no 
body stands above the state and can impose order upon it).
However, the issue of security in the international realm has been the subject of 
considerable theoretical debate, with quite different approaches to the prospects for 
international security being advanced by realist, liberal and critical theorists. Moreover, 
since the end of the Cold War a series of new security challenges have emerged 
that are particularly problematic, because, in various ways, they exploit the greater 
interconnectedness of the modern world. These include the shift from traditional, inter￾state war to so-called ‘new’ wars, the rise of transnational terrorism and an increase 
in nuclear proliferation. A further, and linked, development has been the tendency to 
rethink the concept of security at a still deeper level, usually through a concern with what 
has been called ‘human security’ (see p. 471), in contrast to ‘national’ or ‘state’ security.
Approaches to international politics
Realist approach
Realism (sometimes called ‘political realism’) has been the dominant perspective 
on international politics since the Second World War. It claims to offer an account 
of international politics that is ‘realistic’, in the sense that it is hard-headed and, 
as realists see it, devoid of wishful thinking and deluded moralizing. For realists, 
international politics is, first and last, about power and self-interest. This is why it is 
often portrayed as a ‘power politics’ model of world affairs. As Hans Morgenthau 
(1948) put it, ‘Politics is a struggle for power over men, and whatever its ultimate aim 
may be, power is its immediate goal and the modes of acquiring, maintaining and 
demonstrating it determine the technique of political action.’
The theory of power politics is based on two core assumptions. The first is that 
people are essentially selfish and competitive, meaning that egoism is the defining 
characteristic of human nature. This is an idea that provides the foundation for the 
political theories of Niccolò Machiavelli (see p. 5) and Thomas Hobbes (see p. 65).
However, whereas Machiavelli and Hobbes were primarily concerned to explain the 
conduct of individuals or social groups, realist international theorists have been 
concerned, above all, with the behaviour of states, seen as the most important actors 
on the world stage. The fact that states are composed of, and led by, people who 
are inherently selfish, greedy and power-seeking means that state behaviour must 
exhibit the same characteristics, human egoism implying state egoism. State egoism 
leads to international conflict, and possibly war, because each state pursues its own 
national interest, and these are, by their nature, incompatible.
From the 1970s onwards, new thinking within the realist tradition started to emerge 
which was critical of ‘early’ or ‘classical’ realism. Under the influence of Kenneth

the pursuit of power is the

descriptively.
CONCEPT
Realism
Realism is a theory of 
international politics 
whose core theme 
can be summed up as: 
egoism plus anarchy 
equals power politics. 
Some, nevertheless, 
argue that this 
formulation betrays a 
basic theoretical fault￾line within realism, 
dividing it into two 
schools of thought. 
Classical realism explains 
power politics largely 
in terms of human 
selfishness or egoism, 
suggesting that, as 
states prioritize self￾interest and survival, 
the international realm 
tends towards unending 
conflict. Neorealism 
(or structural realism) 
explains power politics in 
terms of the structural 
dynamics of an anarchic 
international system 
that forces states to rely 
on military self-help.
International security:
Conditions in which 
the mutual survival and 
safety of states is secured 
through measures taken 
to prevent or punish 
aggression, usually 
within a rule-governed 
international order.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_18.indd 459 23-07-2024 12:59:52460 POLITICS
Waltz (see p. 461), ‘neorealists’ or ‘structural’ realists started to explain the behaviour 
of states on the basis of assumptions about the structure of the international system 
and, in particular, the fact that, in the absence of world government, the international 
system is characterized by anarchy. Being, in effect, an international ‘state of nature’, 
the system tends towards tension, conflict and the unavoidable possibility of war 
because states are forced to ensure survival and security by relying on their own 
capacities and resources, rather than any form of external support. This leads to the 
creation of a ‘self-help’ system in which states inevitably prioritize the build-up of 
military power as the only strategy that promises to ensure survival.
The realist approach to international politics has important implications for security. 
Indeed, Waltz (1979) presented security as the ‘highest end’ of international politics. 
From the realist perspective, states have primary responsibility for maintaining 
security, as reflected in the notion of ‘national security’. The major threats to 
national security come from other states. In this way, the threat of violence and other 
forms of physical coercion are intrinsically linked to the prospects of inter-state war. 
National security is, thus, closely linked to the prevention of such wars, usually 
through the build-up of military capacity to deter potential aggressors. However, the 
fact that states are inclined to treat other states as enemies does not inevitably lead to 
bloodshed and open violence. Rather, realists believe that conflict can be contained 
by the balance of power. Classical realists have thus advocated that the balance of 
power be embraced as a policy which uses diplomacy, or possibly war, to prevent any 
state from achieving a predominant position in the international system. Neorealists, 
for their part, view the balance of power as a system, rather than as a policy; that 
is, as a condition in which no one state predominates over others, tending to create 
general equilibrium and discourage any state from pursuing hegemonic ambitions.
Liberal approach
The key themes of liberal ideology are examined in Chapter 2. However, liberalism 
has also had a major impact on the discipline of international relations. This draws 
on a much older tradition of so-called ‘idealist’ theorizing which dates back, via 
Kant’s (see p. 461) belief in the possibility of ‘universal and perpetual peace’, to the 
Middle Ages and the ideas of early ‘just war’ thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas 
(1225–74). Liberalism offers an optimistic vision of international politics, based, 
ultimately on a belief in human rationality and moral goodness (although liberals 
also believe that humans are naturally self-interested creatures). This inclines them 
to believe that the principle of balance or harmony operates in all forms of social 
interaction. Individuals, groups and, for that matter, states may pursue self-interest, 
but a natural equilibrium will tend to assert itself. Just as, from a liberal perspective, 
natural or unregulated equilibrium emerges in economic life (Adam Smith’s (see p.
170) ‘invisible hand’ of capitalism), a balance of interests develops amongst the states 
of the world. This inclines liberals to believe in internationalism (see p. 156) and to 
hold that realists substantially underestimate the scope for cooperation and trust to 
develop within the international system (see Chapter 19).
Nevertheless, liberals do not believe that peace and international order simply arise 
entirely on their own. Instead, mechanisms are needed to constrain the ambitions of 
National security:
Conditions in which the 
survival and safety of 
a particular nation or 
state is secured, usually 
through the build-up of 
military capacity to deter 
aggression.
Balance of power: A 
condition in which no 
one state predominates 
over others, tending to 
create general equilibrium 
and curb the hegemonic 
ambitions of states.
Just war: A war that 
in its purpose and 
content meets certain 
ethical standards, and 
so is (allegedly) morally 
justified.
Egoism: Greater concern 
with one’s own interests or 
well-being, or selfishness; 
the belief that one’s own 
interests are morally 
superior to those of 
others.
National interest: Foreign 
policy goals, objectives 
or policy preferences 
that supposedly benefit 
a society as a whole (the 
foreign policy equivalent 
of the ‘public interest’).

sovereign states, and these take the form of international regimes or international 
organizations. This reflects the ideas of what is called ‘liberal institutionalism’. The basis 
for such a view lies in the ‘domestic analogy’, the idea that insight into international 
politics can be gained by reflecting on the structures of democratic politics. This 
highlights the fact that, as Hobbes and Locke argued (see p. 32), only the construction 
of a sovereign power can safeguard citizens from the chaos and barbarity of the ‘state 
of nature’. If order can only be imposed ‘from above’ in domestic politics, the same 
must be true of international politics. This provided the basis for the establishment of 
an international rule of law, which, as US President Woodrow Wilson (1856–1924) put 
it, would turn the ‘jungle’ of international politics into a ‘zoo’. Liberals have therefore 
generally viewed the trend towards global governance (see p. 487) in positive terms (as 
discussed in Chapter 19). Against realist support for national security, they have also 
supported the idea of ‘collective security’ (see p. 462), the notion that underpinned the 
construction of the League of Nations and, later, the United Nations.

KEY THINKER
KENNETH WALTZ (1924–2013)
US international relations theorist. Waltz’s initial contribution to international relations, outlined 
in Man, the State, and War (1959), adopted a conventional realist approach and remains the 
basic starting point for the study of war. His Theory of International Politics (1979) was the 
most influential book of international relations theory of its generation. Ignoring human nature 
and the ethics of statecraft, Waltz used system theory to explain how international anarchy 
effectively determines the actions of states, with change in the international system occurring 
through changes in the distribution of capabilities between and amongst states. Waltz’s analysis 
was closely associated with the Cold War, and the belief that bipolarity provides a better 
guarantee of peace and security than does multipolarity.

IMMANUEL KANT (1724–1804)
German philosopher. Kant spent his entire life in Königsberg (which was then in East 
Prussia), becoming professor of logic and metaphysics at the University of Königsberg in 
1770. His ‘critical’ philosophy holds that knowledge is not merely an aggregate of sense 
impressions; it depends on the conceptual apparatus of human understanding. Kant’s 
political thought was shaped by the central importance of morality. He believed that 
the law of reason dictated categorical imperatives, the most important of which was the 
obligation to treat others as ‘ends’, and never only as ‘means’. Kant’s most important works 
include Critique of Pure Reason (1781), Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and Critique of 
Judgement (1790).

Critical approaches
Since the late 1980s, the range of critical approaches to international politics has 
expanded considerably. Until that point, Marxism had constituted the principal 
alternative to mainstream realist and liberal theories. What made the Marxist 
approach distinctive was that it placed its emphasis not on patterns of conflict 
and cooperation between states, but on structures of economic power and the role 
played in world affairs by international capital. It thus brought international political 
economy, sometimes seen as a subfield within IR, into focus. However, hastened by 
the end of the Cold War, a wide range of ‘new voices’ started to influence the study 
of world politics, notable examples including constructivism (see p. 18), critical 
theory, post-structuralism, postcolonialism, feminism and green ideology. In view 
of their diverse philosophical underpinnings and contrasting political viewpoints, 
it is tempting to argue that the only thing that unites these ‘new voices’ is a shared 
antipathy towards mainstream thinking. However, two broad similarities can be 
identified. The first is that, albeit in different ways and to different degrees, they have 
tried to go beyond the positivism of mainstream theory, emphasizing instead the 
role of consciousness in shaping social conduct and therefore world affairs. Second, 
critical theories are ‘critical’ in that, in their different ways, they oppose the dominant 
forces and interests in modern world affairs and so contest the international status 
quo, usually by aligning themselves with marginal or oppressed groups. Each of 
them, thus, seeks to uncover inequalities and asymmetries that mainstream theories 
tend to ignore.
The critical theories that have most clearly addressed the issue of security are 
constructivism and feminism. Constructivism has been the most influential post￾positivist approach to international theory, and has gained significantly greater 
attention since the end of the Cold War. Constructivists, who follow in the tradition 
of Alexander Wendt (1999), argue that interactions between states are mediated by 
beliefs, values and assumptions that structure both how states see themselves and 
how they understand, and respond to, the structures within which they operate. 
This implies, for instance, that state behaviour is not determined, as neorealists 
assert, by the structural dynamics of international anarchy, but by how they view 
that anarchy. As Wendt (1992) put it, ‘anarchy is what states make of it’. While some 
states view anarchy as dangerous and threatening, others may see it as the basis 
for freedom and opportunity. An ‘anarchy of friends’ is thus very different from an 
‘anarchy of enemies’. Constructivists argue that this leaves open the possibility that 
states may transcend a narrow conception of self-interest and embrace the cause of 
ethics and global justice, even cosmopolitanism (Appiah 2007). Feminists, on the 
other hand, have criticized the realist view of security on two other grounds. In the 
first place, it is premised on masculinist assumptions about rivalry, competition and 
inevitable conflict, arising from a tendency to see the world in terms of interactions 
amongst a series of power-seeking, autonomous actors. Second, feminists have 
argued that the conventional idea of national security tends to be self-defeating as 
a result of the security paradox. This creates what has been called the ‘insecurity 
of security’. For many feminists, the gendered nature of security is also reflected in 
the gendered nature of war and armed conflict, as highlighted by, amongst others, 
Jean Bethke Elshtain.
CONCEPT
Collective security
The idea of collective 
security, simply stated, 
is that aggression can 
best be resisted by 
united action taken by 
a number of states. It 
suggests that states, 
as long as they pledge 
themselves to defend 
one another, have 
the capacity either to 
deter aggression in 
the first place, or to 
punish the transgressor, 
if international order 
has been breached. 
Successful collective 
security depends (1) 
on states being roughly 
equal, (2) on all states 
being willing to bear 
the cost of defending 
one another, and (3) 
on the existence of an 
international body that 
has the moral authority 
and military capacity to 
take effective action.
Security paradox: The 
paradox that a build-up of 
military capacity designed 
to strengthen national 
security may be counter￾productive, in that it 
encourages other states 
to adopt more threatening 
and hostile postures.

New security challenges
From ‘new’ wars to cyberwars
International security has usually implied a search for the conditions in which 
traditional, inter-state wars can be ended or prevented. Since the birth of the modern 
international system through the Peace of Westphalia (1648), war has been seen as 
an instrument of state policy, a means through which states gained ascendancy over 
one another, or sought to resist other states’ bids for ascendancy. As the Prussian 
general and military theorist Karl von Clausewitz (1780–1831) put it, ‘War is merely 
a continuation of politics by other means.’ However, war and warfare have changed. 
Since the Second World War, the number of inter-state wars with twenty or more 
deaths per year rose to nine in 1987, then dropped to one in 2002, two in 2003 and 
zero in 2004. Starting with the tactics employed in the 1950s and 1960s by national 
liberation movements in places such as Algeria, Vietnam and Palestine, and then 
extending to conflicts in countries such as Somalia, Liberia, Sudan and the Congo, a 
new style of warfare has developed, possibly even redefining war itself. Following the 
break-up of the USSR and Yugoslavia in the 1990s, such ‘new’ wars occurred in the 
Balkans and in the Caucasus, as well as in Iraq and Afghanistan.
‘New’ wars tend to be civil wars, rather than inter-state wars. About 95 per cent of 
armed conflicts since the mid-1990s have occurred within states, not between states. 
Civil wars have become common in the postcolonial world, where colonialism 
(see p. 163) has often left a heritage of ethnic or regional rivalry, economic 
underdevelopment and weakened state power; hence the emergence of ‘quasi-states’ 
or ‘failed states’ (see p. 81). These states are weak, in that they fail the most basic test 
of state power: they are unable to maintain domestic order and personal security, 
meaning that civil strife, and even civil war, become routine. This is the point, 
however, where domestic security becomes entangled with international security, as 
the only effective protection for the domestic population may come from external 
sources in the form of humanitarian intervention (see p. 475). However, ‘new’ wars

JEAN BETHKE ELSHTAIN (BORN 1941)
US political philosopher. Elshtain’s Public Man, Private Woman (1981) made a major 
contribution to feminist scholarship in examining the role of gender in fashioning the 
division between public and private spheres in political theory. In Women and War (1987), 
she discussed the perceptual lenses that determine the roles of men and women in war, 
interweaving personal narrative and historical analysis to highlight the myths that men are 
‘just warriors’ and women are ‘beautiful souls’ to be saved. In Just War Against Terror (2003), 
Elshtain argued that the ‘war on terror’ was just, in that it was fought against the genocidal 
threat of ‘apocalyptic’ terrorism, a form of warfare that made no distinction between 
combatants and non-combatants.

DEBATING . . .
IS PEACE AND COOPERATION AMONGST STATES DESTINED TO REMAIN 
ELUSIVE?
International relations is centrally concerned with the balance between cooperation and conflict in world affairs, traditionally 
linked to the issues of war and peace. While realists argue that the tendency towards international conflict and, probably, 
war are ultimately irresistible, liberals and others highlight the possibility of trust and cooperation amongst states. Why are 
state relations so often characterized by fear and hostility, and can this fear and hostility ever be overcome?
YES NO
Absence of world government. The tragedy of 
international politics is that the only way of ensuring 
enduring peace and order – the establishment of world 
government – is either starkly unrealistic (states will 
never sacrifice their sovereignty to a higher body), or 
profoundly undesirable (it will lead to global despotism). 
As neorealists point out, international anarchy tends 
towards conflict because states are forced to survive 
through military self-help, and this is only contained by 
a fortuitous, but always temporary, balance of power. 
For ‘offensive’ realists (who believe that states seek to 
maximize power and not merely security), when the 
balance of power breaks down, war is the likely outcome 
(Mearsheimer 2001).
The security dilemma. Conflict and even war are inevitable 
because relations between states are always characterized 
by uncertainty and suspicion. This is best explained 
through the security dilemma. This is the dilemma that 
arises from the fact that a build-up of military capacity 
for defensive reasons by one state is always liable to be 
interpreted as aggressive by other states. The irresolvable 
uncertainty about these matters leads to arms races and 
a ratcheting-up of tension between states, especially 
because states are likely to assume that the actions of 
other states are aggressive because misperception in this 
respect risks national disaster.
Relative gains. International conflict is encouraged by 
the fact that the primary concern of states is to maintain 
or improve their position relative to other states; that is, 
to make ‘relative’ gains. Apart from anything else, this 
discourages cooperation and reduces the effectiveness 
of international organizations because, although all 
states may benefit from a particular action or policy, 
each state is actually more worried about whether 
other states benefit more than it does. In this view, 
international politics is a zero-sum game: states can only 
improve their position within the power hierarchy at the 
expense of other states. 
An interdependent world. Realism’s narrow preoccupation 
with the military and diplomatic dimensions of international 
politics, the so-called ‘high politics’ of security and survival, 
is misplaced. Instead, the international agenda is becoming 
broader with greater attention being given to the ‘low 
politics’ of welfare, environmental protection and political 
justice. Of particular importance is the growing tendency 
for states to prioritize trade over war, recognizing both that 
this opens up a non-military route to state progress and, by 
deepening economic interdependence, makes war perhaps 
impossible. States are concerned with making ‘absolute’ 
gains, engaging in cooperation in order to be better off 
in real terms, rather than a self-defeating struggle for 
‘relative’ gains.
International society. The realist emphasis on power politics 
has been modified by the recognition that interacting 
states constitute a ‘society’ and not merely a ‘system’. To 
a growing degree, international society is rule-governed 
and biased in favour of order and predictability, rather 
than risk and uncertainty. This occurs because, as states 
interact with one another, they develop norms and rules 
enabling trust and cooperation to emerge, a tendency 
supported by international law, diplomacy and the activities 
of international organizations.
Democratic peace thesis. Liberals have long argued that 
state relations are structured as much by the internal, 
constitutional structure of the state as they are by external 
factors such as the structural dynamics of the international 
system. In particular, strong empirical evidence that 
democratic states do not go to war against one another 
suggests a link between peace and democracy. ‘Democratic 
peace’ is upheld by the fact that public opinion normally 
favours the avoidance of war; that democracies are inclined 
to use non-violent forms of conflict resolution in all of their 
affairs; and that cultural ties develop amongst democracies, 
encouraging them to view each other as friends not enemies.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
MEXICO’S WAR ON DRUGS: A COMPLEX MODERN CONFLICT
On 5 January 2023, a Mexican government force made 
up of Army, Air Force, Navy, National Guard and state 
police elements arrested Ovidio Guzmán López, one 
of the leaders of the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel. In 
response, thousands of cartel gunmen rose up across the 
state, forcing the closure of many roads, airports, shops 
and services – it was not until 13 January that government 
forces finally restored order.
The uprising in Sinaloa is just one of the latest in Mexico’s 
decades-long war on drugs. Long a staging ground for illicit 
smuggling into the lucrative US drug market, Mexico’s 
illegal drug trade reached problematic scales in the 1960s, 
when police agencies on both sides of the border began 
attempting to interrupt the drug supply. These operations 
were only modestly effective, and the drug trade and 
associated violence continued to escalate over subsequent 
decades. This rise was in part due to the increasingly close 
association between the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI) and the cartels who controlled the drug 
trade. PRI politicians and officials were accused of openly 
collaborating with the cartels to maintain power. In 
1997, the PRI-appointed head of Mexico’s national drug 
enforcement agency was arrested for taking bribes from 
drug cartels, and two years later, a PRI governor was 
discovered to be trafficking cocaine through his state. 
In 2006, Felipe Calderón, a member of the opposition 
National Action Party, was elected President of Mexico 
and began a new era in the war on drugs after sending 
several thousand Mexican Army soldiers to directly fight 
the cartels. By 2008, there were nearly 50,000 troops 
deployed amongst the worst afflicted states. But the 
cartels, well-funded and long-established, fought back 
with a wave of violent resistance. That same year, over 
6,000 deaths were associated with the war on drugs, 
including high-profile assassinations and sometimes 
torture of politicians and police chiefs.
Mexico’s war on drugs is a complex, multifaceted conflict 
with global implications that has aspects of a civil war. 
The drug trade is extremely lucrative for some of the 
country’s poorest regions and is thought to employ over 
400,000 Mexicans. Mexico’s drug cartels can themselves 
act as pseudo-governmental institutions in their regions, 
providing not just employment and security, but in some 
cases even welfare support for their communities. The 
Jalisco New Generational Cartel (CJNG), one of the 
most powerful in the country, engages in extensive 
public-relations campaigns supported by a specialist arm 
of their operations. Their messaging often appeals to 
patriotism, while promoting the cartel’s work to support 
community projects and providing food and services to the 
poor. However, the CJNG uses political violence to cow 
politicians, intimidate journalists and skew elections – in 
one year alone, more than 100 candidates for office were 
assassinated. Moreover, corruption is endemic in many of 
Mexico’s poorer regions, which often allows the cartels to 
bribe local judges and police.
Felipe Calderon’s declaration of war and deployment of 
the armed forces, who are better paid and more loyal to 
the central government, was initially met with enthusiasm. 
However, the war soon sparked unintended consequences. 
Fiercely competitive amongst themselves for control of the 
drug trade, the cartels engaged in terror and assassination 
campaigns, and sometimes even cooperated with federal 
forces to eliminate rivals and take territory. As civilian 
deaths soared vigilante self-defence groups formed in 
rural areas, where policing was weak. While initially allies of 
law enforcement, some such groups were infiltrated by the 
cartels, and others began to militate against government 
forces, further confusing the politics of the war. Expansive 
new laws were passed to empower the government to more 
effectively dismantle the cartels, but these were fiercely 
criticized by civil society groups, noting they essentially 
gave the green light to violate human rights and bypass due 
process of law.

often pose a wider and more profound threat to civilian populations than did the 
inter-state wars of old. The civilian/military divide – which had been symbolized by 
the fact that traditional wars were fought by uniformed, organized bodies of men 
(national armies, navies and air forces) – has been blurred in a variety of ways.
The wide use of guerrilla tactics and the emphasis on popular resistance, or 
insurgency, has given modern warfare a diffuse character. As it tends to involve a 
succession of small-scale engagements, rather than major battles, the conventional 
idea of a battlefield has become almost redundant. War has developed into 
‘war amongst the people’ (Smith 2006), a tendency that has been deepened by 
the ‘collateral damage’ that has sometimes been caused by counter-insurgency 
operations. The blurring has also occurred because civilian populations have 
increasingly been the target of military action (through the use of landmines, 
suicide bombs, vehicle bombs and terrorism generally), its objective being to 
create economic and social dislocation, and to destroy the enemy’s resolve and 
appetite for war.
‘New’ wars are often asymmetrical wars, in which, compensating for a lack of 
sophisticated resources, warfare strategies are adapted to the needs of the weak. 
Over time, however, developed states have devised technologies and warfare 
strategies that are better suited to the needs of asymmetrical wars, not least the use 
of drones and remote aerial warfare generally. These and other such strategies have 
the advantage that they can be effective in circumstances in which the conventional 
idea of a battlefield is meaningless. In a further development in warfare, cyberspace 
has become an increasingly important arena for conflict and competition among 
states, giving rise to the phenomenon of ‘cyberwars’.
Examples of cyberwarfare have been many and various, and include the following:
 In 2006, the USA collaborated with Israel in a cyberattack (dubbed ‘Operation 
Olympic Games’) on Iran’s Natanz nuclear reactor. The attack destroyed almost a 
quarter of Iran’s nuclear centrifuges, which are used in the uranium-enrichment 
process.
 In 2016, hackers broke into the US Democratic National Committee’s servers 
and released, via WikiLeaks, emails that were embarrassing to the Democratic 
presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. US intelligence officials later asserted 
that the hacking was intended to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential 
election, and was conducted by, or on behalf of, the Russian government.
 In 2019, 2020 and 2021, a series of major cyberattacks on Sri Lankan national 
websites were launched by groups associated with the Tamil Tigers, a separatist 
Guerrilla war: (Spanish) 
Literally, ‘little war’; an 
insurgency or ‘people’s’ 
war, fought by irregular 
troops using tactics that 
are suited to the terrain 
and emphasize mobility 
and surprise, rather than 
superior fire power.
Insurgency: An armed 
uprising, involving irregular 
soldiers, which aims to 
overthrow the established 
regime.
Asymmetrical war: A 
war fought between 
opponents with clearly 
unequal levels of 
military, economic and 
technological power.
Cyberwar: The use of 
digital or network-based 
technology to disrupt 
the activities of a state 
or organization, usually 
for strategic or military 
purposes.
Further complicating matters is the international dimension 
of the war. The smuggling of firearms from neighbouring 
Guatemala and the United States to the cartels, for 
instance, has greatly escalated the violence of the conflict. 
US intelligence-sharing, funding and joint operations 
have been important to Mexican efforts but have also 
been controversial amongst Mexican voters, who see US 
pressure on Mexico to fight the cartels as compromising 
national sovereignty. As the cost and casualties of the war 
have mounted, new administrations have attempted to find 
alternative paths to deescalate the conflict. But even with 
the arrest of some of the highest profile drug lords, there is 
no end in sight to this complex and multifaceted war.

group in the north of the country that had fought a war of independence for 
several decades, thought to be a sign that what was once a terrestrial war against 
the government had moved into cyberspace.
The fear of digital warfare is often associated with the possibility of a massive 
attack that could cripple a state’s critical infrastructure, sometimes portrayed as a 
‘cyber-Pearl Harbor’. Much more commonly, however, cyberattacks focus on more 
limited targets – as when they involve, for instance, stealing intellectual property, 
meddling in elections and disrupting the work of public or private bodies – often 
linked to a wider desire to destabilize society by promoting discord or eroding trust. 
Securing cyberspace from such attacks is nevertheless a daunting task. In the first 
place, it is notoriously difficult to identify the perpetrators of such attacks, meaning 
that cyberwarriors tend to be ‘invisible’. Second, so great is the dependency of the 
corporate world and the political world on computerized information systems and 
digital technologies generally that cyberwarriors are confronted by an almost infinite 
choice of potential targets, many of which have invested inadequately in cybersecurity. 
Third, cyberwarfare is by no means a strategy that is confined to developed states 
because, compared with conventional warfare, cyberwars are cheap to plan and fight.
Transnational terrorism
During much of the post-1945 period, terrorism generally had a nationalist 
orientation. In the 1940s and 1950s, it was associated with Third World anti-colonial 
struggles in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, later being taken up by national 
liberation movements such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and 
groups such as Black September. Terrorism was also used by disaffected national or 
ethnic minorities in developed Western societies, notably by the IRA in Northern 
Ireland and on the UK mainland, by ETA (Euzkadi ta Askatsuna) in the Basque region 
of Spain, and by the FLQ (Front de libération du Québec) in Quebec. Nevertheless, 
the September 11 terrorist attacks convinced many people that terrorism had been 
reborn in a new and more dangerous form, leading some to conclude that it had 
become the principal threat to international peace and security.
The most obvious way in which terrorism has become more significant is that it 
has acquired a transnational, even global, dimension. Although the international 
character of terrorism can be traced back to the advent of aircraft hijackings in the 
late 1960s, 9/11 and other al-Qaeda, or al-Qaeda-linked, attacks and the emergence 
of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) or IS (Islamic State) have taken this process 
to a new level. Transnational terrorism is generally associated with the advance of 
globalization, in that it takes advantage of increased cross-border flows of people, 
goods, money, technology and ideas, and thereby creates the impression that 
terrorists can strike anywhere, at any time. Such terrorism has also been dubbed 
‘catastrophic’ terrorism or ‘hyper-terrorism’, highlighting its radical and devastating 
impact, as well as the greater difficulties experienced in counteracting it.
This applies for at least three reasons. First, an increased emphasis has been placed 
on terrorist tactics that are particularly difficult to defend against, notably, suicide 
terrorism. How can protection be provided against attackers who are willing to 
CONCEPT
War
War is a condition of 
armed conflict between 
two or more parties 
(usually states). The 
emergence of the 
modern form of war as 
an organized and goal￾directed activity stems 
from the development 
of the European state￾system in the early 
modern period. War has 
a formal or quasi-legal 
character, in that the 
declaration of a state of 
war need not necessarily 
be accompanied by the 
outbreak of hostilities. 
In the post-Cold 
War era it has been 
common to refer to 
‘new’ wars. These have 
been characterized, 
variously, by intra-state 
ethnic conflict, the use 
of advanced military 
technology and the use 
of terrorist and guerrilla 
strategies.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_18.indd 467 23-07-2024 12:59:53468 POLITICS
sacrifice their own lives in order to kill others? This contributes to the idea that, 
although it may be possible to reduce the likelihood of terrorist attacks, the threat 
can never be eradicated. Second, the potential scope and scale of terrorism has 
greatly increased as a result of modern technology, and particularly the prospect 
of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) falling into the hands of terrorists. Since 
9/11, governments have been trying to plan for the possibility of terrorist attacks 
using chemical or biological weapons, with the prospect of nuclear terrorism no 
longer being dismissed as a fanciful idea. Third, it is sometimes argued that modern 
terrorists not only have easier access to WMD but also have a greater willingness 
to use them. Allegedly, this is because they may be less constrained by moral and 
humanitarian principles than previous generations of terrorists. In the case of 
Islamist terrorism, this is supposedly explained by the radical politico-religious 
ideology which inspires it, in which Western society and its associated values are 
viewed as evil and intrinsically corrupt, an implacable enemy of Islam.
Upholding international security in an age of transnational terrorism has been a 
particularly difficult task. Three main counterterrorism strategies have been employed 
in the modern period. The first strategy involves the revision and strengthening of 
arrangements for state security, usually by extending the legal powers of government. 
States, for example, have asserted control over global financial flows; immigration 
arrangements have been made more rigorous, especially during high-alert periods; 
the surveillance and control of domestic populations, but particularly members of 
‘extremist’ groups or terrorist sympathizers, has been significantly tightened; and, in 
many cases, the power to detain terrorist suspects has been strengthened.
The second strategy is the use of force-based or repressive counterterrorism, which, 
in recent years, has been associated with the ‘war on terror’. Military responses to 
terrorism have been designed to deny terrorists the support or ‘sponsorship’ of 
regimes, or to launch direct attacks on terrorist training camps and terrorist leaders. 
Failed states like Afghanistan, Mali and Somalia have proven havens for terrorists 
and extremists, creating an imperative for the international community to provide 
assistance in stabilizing security and administration in those places. Nevertheless, as 
demonstrated by the US-led ‘war on terror’, military repression may sometimes be 
counterproductive, especially when military action against terrorism is seen to be 
insensitive to human rights and the interests of civilian populations. The third strategy 
is the use of political deals to encourage terrorists to abandon violence by drawing 
them into a process of negotiation and diplomacy. Although this is sometimes 
seen as an example of appeasement, a moral retreat in the face of intimidation and 
violence, the fact is that most terrorist campaigns have political endings. In part, 
this is because leading figures in terrorist movements tend to gravitate towards 
respectability and constitutional politics once they recognize that terrorist tactics are 
generally ineffective. However, there are many long-running domestic insurgencies 
which have proven seemingly immune to peaceable solutions. The New People’s 
Army communist rebellion in the Philippines has been ongoing since 1969, despite 
more than forty rounds of peace negotiations. Abu Sayyaf, a jihadist insurgency, 
has also terrorized in the Philippines since 1989, though relentless counter-terrorist 
operations backed by the United States and other Western allies have significantly 
reduced the power and reach of the movement.
CONCEPT
Terrorism
Terrorism, in its 
broadest sense, is 
a form of political 
violence that aims to 
achieve its objectives 
by creating a climate 
of fear, apprehension 
and uncertainty. The 
most common forms 
of terrorist action 
include assassinations, 
bombings, hostage 
seizures and plane 
hijacks, although 
9/11 and the advent 
of terrorism with 
a global reach has 
threatened to redefine 
the phenomenon. The 
term is highly pejorative 
and tends to be used 
selectively (one person’s 
terrorist is another’s 
freedom fighter). 
Often portrayed as 
a specifically anti￾government activity, 
some portray the use by 
governments of terror 
against their own or 
other populations as 
‘state terrorism’.

Nuclear proliferation
The ‘nuclear age’ was born on 6 August 1945, when the USA dropped an atomic 
bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. A second bomb was dropped three days 
later on Nagasaki. The unprecedented destructive potential of nuclear weapons
explains why the issue of nuclear proliferation has been at the forefront of the 
international security agenda since the Second World War. During the Cold War 
period, sometimes dubbed the ‘first nuclear age’, nuclear proliferation was primarily 
‘vertical’ (the accumulation of nuclear weapons by established nuclear states) rather 
than ‘horizontal’ (the acquisition of nuclear weapons by more states or other actors). 
The ‘nuclear club’ contained only the five permanent members of the UN Security 
Council (the USA, the USSR, China, France and the UK), but, during this period, the 
USA and the USSR built up the capacity to destroy the world many times over. By 
2002, the joint US and Russian nuclear capacity amounted to 98 per cent of all nuclear 
warheads that had been built. This nuclear arms race was fuelled, in particular, by the 
profound deterrence value of nuclear weapons. In view of the devastating potential 
of nuclear weapons, an attack on a nuclear power is almost unthinkable. A nuclear 
balance of power therefore developed in which both the USA and the USSR acquired 
so-called ‘second-strike’ nuclear capabilities that would enable them to withstand an 
enemy’s attack and still destroy major strategic targets and population centres. By the 
early 1960s, both superpowers had an invulnerable second-strike capability which 
ensured that nuclear war would result in Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), 
sometimes seen as a ‘balance of terror’.
However, although the end of the Cold War and the cessation of East–West rivalry 
produced early, optimistic expectations or declining concerns about nuclear 
proliferation, the ‘second nuclear age’ has proved, in certain respects, to be more 
troubling than the first. For one thing, established nuclear powers continue to use 
nuclear strategies. Thus, even though the new START Treaty, signed in 2010 by the 
USA and Russia, agreed to reduce the number of strategic nuclear missile launchers 
by half, both countries would still possess 1,550 nuclear warheads. The greatest 
concern has, nevertheless, arisen over further horizontal nuclear proliferation, 
fuelled by regional rivalries and the fact that, particularly since the break-up of the 
USSR, nuclear weapons and nuclear technology have become more readily available. 
India and Pakistan joined the ‘nuclear club’ in 1998, as did North Korea in 2006. 
Israel has been an undeclared nuclear power, possibly since 1979, and it is widely 
believed that Iran is in the process of developing an independent nuclear capacity. 
These new nuclear powers are not signatories to many of the anti-proliferation and 
nuclear control treaties signed by other states.
Anxieties over proliferation have intensified because of the nature of the states and 
other actors that may acquire nuclear capabilities. This particularly applies in the case 
of so-called ‘rogue states’, in which military-based dictatorial government combines 
with factors such as ethnic and social conflict, and economic underdevelopment, to 
dictate an aggressive foreign policy, particularly in the context of regional instability. 
North Korea is widely portrayed as a potential rogue nuclear state, which poses a 
threat not only to South Korea but also to Japan and even the USA. The acquisition of 
nuclear weapons by Iran has been seen as a profound threat to international security 
for a number of reasons. These include the possibility that Israel may launch a pre￾Nuclear weapons:
Weapons that use nuclear 
fission (atomic bombs) or 
nuclear fusion (hydrogen 
bombs) to destroy their 
targets, through the

radiation.

or strategy designed to 
prevent aggression by 
emphasizing the scale of 
the likely military response 
(the cost of an attack 
would be greater than any 
benefit it may bring).
Mutually Assured 
Destruction: A condition 
in which a nuclear attack 
by either state would 
only ensure its own 
destruction, as both 
possess an invulnerable 
second-strike capacity.
Rogue state: A state 
whose foreign policy poses 
a threat to neighbouring 
or other states, through its 
aggressive intent, build-up 
of weapons or association 
with terrorism.

emptive nuclear attack against Iran before it acquires nuclear capability; that Iran 
itself may launch an unprovoked nuclear attack on Israel; and that Iran’s acquisition 
of nuclear weapons may spark a destabilizing nuclear arms race across the entire 
Middle East, with increased pressure on states such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey 
to acquire nuclear weapons. However, others have argued that such concerns are 
alarmist and that the acquisition of nuclear weapons tends to foster caution, even 
statesmanship, based on the sense of security and national prestige that they bring, 
rather than nuclear adventurism. According to Waltz (2012) a nuclear Iran would 
bring stability to the Middle East, as Israel and Iran would then deter each other, 
without giving other countries in the region a greater incentive to acquire their own 
nuclear capability.

Human security
The post-Cold War period has not only seen the emergence of new threats to 
international and global security, but it has also witnessed the emergence of new 
thinking about the nature of security, as such. The key shift has been from viewing 
security as essentially an attribute of a state (as in ‘state security’ or ‘national security’) 
to viewing it as a matter for the individual, as implied by the idea of ‘human security’. 
Human security has recast the concept of security by taking on board the idea of 
human development, which has been used in the UN’s Human Development Reports 
since 1994. This switched attention from economic-based conceptions of poverty (for 
example, using an income of ‘a dollar a day’ as a standard of poverty) to conceptions 
built around human capabilities, such as the ability to acquire knowledge, access 
resources, achieve gender equality and so forth. Human security thus takes account 
not only of the extent to which threats posed by armed conflict have changed and, 
Human development:
A standard of human 
well-being that takes 
account of people’s 
ability to develop their 
full potential, and lead 
fulfilled and creative lives 
in accordance with their 
needs and interests.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_18.indd 470 23-07-2024 12:59:53INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC SECURITY 471
in some senses, intensified (as discussed earlier, in relation to ‘new’ wars), but also 
the degree to which modern armed conflict is entangled with issues of poverty and 
underdevelopment. Economic disruption and widening inequality, which stem from, 
amongst other things, disparities in the global trading system, are seen to heighten 
the vulnerability of states to civil war, terrorism and warlord conflict, while, at the 
same time, armed conflict disrupts economies and trade, and leads to other forms of 
human misery. In addition, human security takes account of non-military sources 
of insecurity, bringing issues such as the lack of an assured basic income, inadequate 
access to basic food and environmental degradation within the international security 
agenda.
A growing concern about human security has also, at times, encouraged the 
international community to assume a more interventionist stance. This can be seen 
in a greater willingness to undertake humanitarian interventions since the early 
1990s, and in support for the establishment of international tribunals and, since 
2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC). The conviction of Charles Taylor – 
the former President of Liberia, who was found guilty in 2012 of aiding and abetting 
murder, rape, enslavement and the use of child soldiers by the Special Tribunal for 
Sierra Leone – was thus meant to ensure that other heads of government or state 
would be less likely to act in such ways in the future. The Landmines Treaty (1997) 
was similarly designed to deter the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti￾personnel mines.
However, the concept of human security has also been criticized. Some have argued, 
for instance, that human security has deepened and widened the concept of security 
to such an extent that it has become virtually meaningless. This particularly applies 
as it extends security beyond the conventional idea of ‘freedom from fear’ to include 
the much broader notion of ‘freedom from want’. Furthermore, the notion may 
create false expectations about the international community’s capacity to banish 
violence and insecurity. In other cases, however, intervention by the international 
community that was intended to promote human security has proved to be highly 
controversial, not uncommonly provoking charges of ‘neocolonialism’. For example, 
the great majority of ICC investigations and indictments have thus far focused on 
Africa and the developing world.
CONCEPT
Human security
Human security refers 
to the security of 
individuals, rather than 
of states. As such, it 
embraces the notions 
of both ‘freedom from 
fear’ and ‘freedom from 
want’. Human security, 
nevertheless, has a 
variety of dimensions. 
These include economic 
security (having an 
assured basic income), 
food security (access 
to basic food), health 
security (protection 
from disease and 
unhealthy lifestyles), 
environmental security 
(protection from 
human-induced 
environmental 
degradation), personal 
security (protection 
from all forms of 
physical violence), 
community security 
(protection for 
traditional identities 
and values) and 
political security (the 
maintenance of political 
rights and civil liberties).

WORLD ORDER AND 
GLOBAL GOVERNANCE
KEY ISSUES
 What were the implications for world order of the end of the Cold War?
 Is the USA a hegemonic power, or a power in decline?
 How is rising multipolarity likely to affect world politics?
 Is global governance a myth or a reality?
 How effective is the system of global economic governance?
 Is the UN an indispensable component of the modern international system?
PREVIEW
The issue of world order is central to an understanding of international politics. The shape of world order affects 
both the level of stability within the global system and the balance within it between conflict and cooperation. 
However, since the end of the Cold War, the nature of world order has been the subject of significant debate 
and disagreement. Early proclamations of the establishment of a ‘new world order’, characterized by peace and 
international cooperation, were soon replaced by talk of a unipolar world order, with the USA taking centre stage 
as the world’s sole superpower. This ‘unipolar moment’ may nevertheless have been brief. Not only did the USA’s 
involvement in difficult and protracted counter-insurgency wars following September 11 strengthen the impression 
of US decline, but emerging powers, notably China, started to exert greater influence on the world stage. The notion 
that unipolarity has given way to multipolarity has been reinforced by the increasing importance of international 
organizations, a trend that is sometimes interpreted as emerging ‘global governance’. Of particular importance in 
this respect have been the major institutions of global economic governance – the International Monetary Fund, 
the World Bank and the World Trade Organization – and the centrepiece of the global governance system, the 
United Nations (UN). Although some argue that the trend in favour of global governance reflects the fact that, 
in an interdependent world, states must act together to address the challenges that confront them, others dismiss 
global governance as a myth and raise serious questions about the effectiveness of international organizations.

TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY WORLD ORDER
The ‘new world order’ and its fate
Although there is considerable disagreement about the nature of twenty-first￾century world order, there is considerable agreement about the shape of world 
order during the preceding Cold War period. Its most prominent feature was that 
two major power blocs confronted one another: a US-dominated West and a USSR￾dominated East. In the aftermath of the defeat of Germany, Japan and Italy in the 
Second World War, and with the UK weakened by war and suffering from long-term 
relative economic decline, the USA and the USSR emerged as ‘superpowers’. Cold 
War bipolarity was consolidated by the formation of rival military alliances – the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 and the Warsaw Pact in 1955, 
and was reflected in the division of Europe – symbolized by the Berlin Wall, erected 
in 1961. Although the Cold War remained ‘cold’, in the sense that the adversaries 
avoided direct confrontation, the period was characterized by protracted – and, at 
times, extreme – tension, reflected both in covert operations and proxy warfare and, 
most dramatically, in the build-up by both parties of massive armouries of nuclear 
weapons, creating a ‘balance of terror’. (see p. 469)
However, the end of the Cold War was dramatic, swift and unexpected. Over seven 
decades of European communism collapsed in just two years from 1989-91. And 
those communist regimes that survived, like China and Vietnam, largely did so 
by undertaking radical economic reforms. During the momentous year of 1989, 
communist rule in Eastern Europe was rolled back to the borders of the USSR by a 
series of popular revolutions; in 1990, representatives of NATO and the Warsaw Pact 
met in Paris formally to end the Cold War; and, in 1991, the USSR itself collapsed. 
While most explained these developments in terms of the structural weaknesses of 
Soviet-style communism, emphasis has also been placed on the disruption caused in 
the USSR by the accelerating programme of economic and political reform, initiated 
by President Gorbachev from 1985 onwards, and on President Reagan’s so-called 
‘second Cold War’ in the 1980s, when increased military spending put massive 
pressure on the fragile and inefficient Soviet economy.
The end of the Cold War produced a burst of enthusiasm for the ideas of liberal 
internationalism (see p. 156). The idea that the post-Cold War era would be 
characterized by a ‘new world order’ had first been mooted by Gorbachev in a speech 
to the UN General Assembly in 1988. In addition to proposing a strengthening of 
the United Nations and a reinvigoration of its peacekeeping role, Gorbachev called 
for the ‘de-ideologization’ of relations amongst states to achieve greater cooperation 
and reduce the use of force in international affairs. In his ‘Towards a New World 
Order’ speech to Congress in September 1990, President Bush Sr outlined his 
version for the post-Cold War world – its features included US leadership to ensure 
the international rule of law, a partnership between the USA and the USSR including 
the integration of the latter into the world economic bodies and a check on the use 
of force by the promotion of collective security. This post-Cold War world order 
appeared to pass its first series of major tests with ease. Iraq’s annexation of Kuwait 
in August 1990 led to the construction of a broad Western and Islamic alliance that, 
through the Gulf War of 1991, brought about the expulsion of Iraqi forces. The 
World order: The 
distribution of power 
between and amongst 
states and other key 
actors, giving rise to a 
relatively stable pattern 
of relationships and 
behaviours.
Bipolarity: The tendency 
of the international 
system to revolve around 
two major power blocs, or 
‘poles’.
CONCEPT
Superpower
A superpower (a term 
first used by William Fox 
in 1944) is a power that is 
greater than a traditional 
‘great power’. For Fox, 
superpowers possessed 
great power ‘plus great 
mobility of power’. As 
the term tends to be 
used specifically to 
refer to the USA and 
the USSR during the 
Cold War period, it is 
of more historical than 
conceptual significance. 
Nevertheless, 
superpowers are 
generally assumed 
to have: (1) a global 
reach, allowing them 
to operate anywhere 
in the world; (2) a 
predominant economic 
and strategic role within 
an ideological bloc or 
sphere of influence; and 
(3) preponderant military 
capacity, especially 
in terms of nuclear 
weaponry.

advent of a new moral consciousness in foreign affairs was also evident in the wider 
use of ‘humanitarian intervention’, notably in NATO’s campaign of aerial bombing 
that removed Serb forces from Kosovo in 1999.
FOCUS ON . . . 
HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION
Humanitarian intervention is military intervention that is carried out in pursuit of humanitarian 
rather than strategic objectives. The growth in humanitarian intervention reflects the wider 
acceptance of universalist doctrines such as human rights (see p. 334) and the fact that 
democratic support for warfare can increasingly be mobilized only on the basis of a moral 
cause. Supporters of humanitarian intervention see it as evidence of the inability of states in a 
global age to restrict their moral responsibilities to their own people.
Humanitarian intervention has been seen as justified in the following circumstances:
 In the case of gross abuses of human rights (such as the expulsion or extermination of 
large numbers of defenceless people).
 When such abuses threaten the security of neighbouring states.
 When the absence of democracy weakens the principle of national self-determination.
 When diplomatic means have been exhausted and the human cost of intervention is less 
than that of non-intervention.
Critics of humanitarian intervention, however, make the following points:
 Any violation of state sovereignty weakens the established rules of world order.
 International aggression can be disguised and sometimes legitimated by humanitarian 
justifications.
 Military intervention invariably leaves matters worse, not better, or draws intervening 
powers into long-term involvement.
However, the wave of optimism and idealism that greeted the post-Cold War 
world did not last long. Many were quick to dismiss the ‘new world order’ as little 
more than a convenient catchphrase, and one that was certainly not grounded in 
a developed strategic vision. Much of how this ‘new world’ would work remained 
vague. Moreover, alternative interpretations of the post-Cold War world order were 
not slow in emerging. Some heralded the rise not of a new world order but, rather, 
a new world disorder. The reason for this was the release of stresses and tensions 
that the Cold War had helped to keep under control. By maintaining the image of 
an external threat (be it international communism or capitalist encirclement), the 
Cold War had served to promote internal cohesion and given societies a sense of 
purpose and identity. However, the collapse of the external threat helped to unleash 
centrifugal pressures, which usually took the form of ethnic, racial and regional 
conflict. This occurred in many parts of the world, but was particularly evident in 
Eastern Europe, as demonstrated in the prolonged bloodshed in the 1990s amongst 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 475 23-07-2024 13:00:52476 POLITICS
Serbs, Croats and Bosnians in the former Yugoslavia. Far from establishing a world 
order based on respect for justice and human rights (see p. 334), the international 
community stood by in former Yugoslavia and, until the Kosovo crisis, allowed 
Serbia to wage a war of expansion and perpetrate genocidal policies. Nevertheless, 
the greatest weakness of the idea of an emerging liberal world order was a failure 
to take account of the shifting role and status of the USA. The main significance of 
the end of the Cold War was the collapse of the USSR as a meaningful challenger to 
the USA, leaving the USA as the world’s sole superpower, a hyperpower or ‘global 
hegemon’. Indeed, talk of a ‘new world order’ may have been nothing more than 
an ideological tool to legitimize the global exercise of power by the USA. In other 
words, the ‘liberal moment’ in world affairs turned out to be the ‘unipolar moment’. 
However, the implications of a unipolar world order only emerged over a period of 
time.
Genocide: An attempt 
to eradicate a people – 
identified by their 
nationality, race, ethnicity 
or religion – through acts 
including mass murder, 
forced resettlement and 
forced sterilization.
Hyperpower: A power 
that commands much 
greater power than any of 
its potential rivals, and so 
dominates world politics.
Unipolarity: An 
international system 
in which there is one 
pre-eminent state; the 
existence of a single great 
power.

that the end of the Cold War would bring about a new world order rooted in liberal

The ‘war on terror’ and beyond
The September 11 terrorist attacks are often seen as a defining moment in world 
history, the point at which the true nature of the post-Cold War era was revealed and 
the beginning of A period of unprecedented global strife and instability. In that sense, 
the advent of the ‘war on terror’, rather than the collapse of communism, marked the 
birth of the ‘real’ twenty-first century. On the other hand, it is possible to exaggerate 
the impact of 9/11. As Robert Kagan (2004) put it, ‘America did not change on 
September 11. It only became more itself.’
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 476 23-07-2024 13:00:52WORLD ORDER AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE 477
A variety of theories have been advanced to explain the advent of global, or 
transnational, terrorism (see p. 468) and the nature of the ‘war on terror’. The most 
influential and widely discussed of these is Samuel Huntington’s theory of a clash 
of civilizations. Huntington argued that the major civilizations (Western, Chinese, 
Japanese, Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist, Latin American and Orthodox Christian) 
would become, in the absence of the East–West ideological conflict and in reaction 
to globalization (see p. 182), the principal actors in world affairs. Such an analysis 
contrasted sharply with the expectation of ‘end of history’ theorists such as Francis 
Fukuyama (see p. 124) that politico-cultural divisions would narrow and ultimately 
evaporate as all parts of the world converged around support for liberal-democratic 
values and systems. Huntington particularly warned about the likelihood of conflict 
between China (wedded to distinctive Sinic cultural values, despite rapid economic 
growth) and the West, and between the West and Islam.
Huntington’s thesis has been widely criticized. The most common criticism is that 
it fails to recognize the extent to which globalization and other forces have already 
blurred cultural differences in many parts of the world. For instance, the notion 
of an ‘Islamic civilization’ or a ‘Western civilization’ fails to take account of either 
the extent of political, cultural and social division within each ‘civilization’, or the 
extent to which Islam and the West have influenced one another, and continue to 
do so. Moreover, the link between cultural difference and political antagonism is, 
at best, questionable, as most wars take place between states from the same, rather 
than different, civilizations. Finally, conflict between civilizations may be more an 
expression of perceived economic and political injustice than of cultural rivalry. 
The rise of political Islam (see p. 213), for instance, may be better explained by 
tensions and crises (in the Middle East in general and the Arab world in particular) 
linked to the inheritance of colonialism, the unresolved Israeli–Palestinian conflict, 
the survival of unpopular but often oil-rich autocratic regimes, and urban poverty 
and unemployment, than by cultural incompatibility between Western and Islamic 
value systems.
After 9/11, the USA’s approach to the ‘war on terror’ quickly started to take shape. 
Its opening act was the US-led military assault on Afghanistan that toppled the 
Taliban regime within a matter of weeks. The ‘war on terror’, however, moved in a 
more radical and controversial direction as it became clear that ‘regime change’ in 
Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was George W. Bush administration’s next objective. This 
led to the 2003 Iraq War, fought by the USA and a ‘coalition of the willing’. What 
made the Iraq War controversial was that, whereas the attack on Afghanistan had 
been widely seen as a form of self-defence (Afghanistan had provided al-Qaeda 
with the closest thing to a home base), the war against Iraq was justified using the 
doctrine of pre-emptive attack. Although the Bush administration alleged (with 
little substantiation) that there were links between the Saddam regime and al￾Qaeda, and asserted (contrary to subsequent evidence) that Iraq was in possession 
of WMD, the central justification was that a ‘rogue’ regime such as Saddam’s that 
actively sought, and may have acquired, WMD could not be tolerated in the twenty￾first century.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 477 23-07-2024 13:00:52478 POLITICS
In both Afghanistan and Iraq, despite swift initial successes (the overthrow of the 
Taliban and Saddam regimes), the USA and its allies found themselves fighting wars 
that proved to be more problematic and protracted than anticipated. Both developed 
into complex counter-insurgency wars against enemies whose use of the tactics 
of guerrilla warfare, terrorism and suicide bombings highlighted the limitations 
of preponderant US military power. As in the Vietnam War (1959–76), guerrilla 
warfare tactics proved to be highly effective against a much more powerful and 
better-resourced enemy, but the use of military means had also weakened the USA’s 
‘soft’ power (see p. 480) and damaged its reputation across the Middle East. In that 
sense, the USA was in danger of creating the very ‘arc of extremism’ that it had set 
out to destroy.
Significant shifts occurred in the ‘war on terror’ once President Obama was 
inaugurated in January 2009, building on a drift towards multilateralism (see p.
490) during Bush’s second term in office, 2005–9. In line with the advice of soft￾power theorists for the USA to ‘learn to cooperate, and to listen’ (Nye 2004), Obama 
altered the tone of the USA’s engagement with world affairs generally. However, 
even though the rhetoric of the ‘war on terror’ was quickly toned down and soon 
abandoned, and the strategic approach to it was revised, military engagement 
continued to play an important role under Obama.
Despite the initial promise of the Arab Spring in 2010, the end of the US combat 
mission in Iraq in 2011 and the death of Osama Bin Laden that same year, stability 
and democracy remained elusive in the Middle East, as did the hope of a multilateral 
approach to security in the region. Civil wars in Syria, Libya and Yemen have become 
proxy conflicts that have pitched traditional NATO allies against a loose coalition of 
anti-Western actors, including Iran and Russia. The deteriorating security situation 
created by these conflicts has allowed ethnic tensions and religious extremism to 
thrive, most notably the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which managed 
to take control of large swathes of Iraq and Syria for a period. As the American 
public grew weary of the seemingly endless commitment of forces and resources to

US academic and political commentator. Huntington made influential contributions in three 
fields: military politics, strategy and civil–military relations; US and comparative politics; and 
political development and the politics of less-developed societies. In The Third Wave (1991) he 
coined the notion of ‘waves of democratization’ and linked the process of democratization after 
1975 to two earlier waves, in 1828–1926 and 1943–62. His most widely discussed work, The

that, in the twenty-first century, conflict between the world’s major civilizations would lead to

CONCEPT
Pre-emptive 
attack
A pre-emptive attack 
(or preventative war) 
is military action that 
is designed to forestall 
or prevent likely 
future aggression. 
The attractions of 
pre-emptive attack 
include that greater 
destruction may be 
avoided and that military 
action is taken before 
a potential aggressor 
becomes too strong 
to be challenged. Its 
drawbacks include that 
calculations about future 
actions or threats may 
be flawed and that the 
notion may simply be 
a cloak for aggression. 
Pre-emptive attack is 
almost certainly illegal 
under the UN Charter, 
which authorizes war 
only in the case of self￾defence.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 478 23-07-2024 13:00:52WORLD ORDER AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE 479
stabilizing the region, Presidents Obama and Donald Trump progressively scaled 
back US involvement, culminating in the withdrawal of all remaining forces in 
Afghanistan in 2021 under President Joe Biden. The collapse of the Afghan regime 
within just weeks and subsequent seizure of power by the Taliban was a bitter pill 
after nearly twenty years of US operations and investment in the country, causing 
many to question the efficacy of US foreign policy and counterterrorism strategies. 
Though statistically there was a marked decline in global conflict in the decades 
immediately following the Cold War, from 2011 there has been a steady rise in 
casualties and foreign interventions in global conflicts. Such numbers suggest that a 
stable new world order of collective security may be increasingly illusory.
From unipolarity to multipolarity?
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq raised major questions about the nature and 
extent of the USA’s global leadership. In sharp contrast to the image of the USA 
as the ‘indispensable nation’, a benevolent hegemon whose widening influence 
brought peace and prosperity, radical theorists such as Noam Chomsky (see p. 227)
portrayed the USA as a ‘rogue superpower’, the principal source of terrorism and 
violence across the globe. Whether its hegemony (see p. 218) was benevolent or 
malign, the difficulty the USA experienced in achieving its military and political 
goals through the ‘war on terror’ convinced many that its global leadership was 
faltering, a conclusion supported by the 2007–9 global financial crisis (as discussed 
in Chapter 7). These developments, indeed, have been seen as part of a wider process; 
namely, a significant redistribution of global power, with unipolarity giving way to 
multipolarity. Rising multipolarity has been associated with three main trends:
 the decline of the USA
 the rise of China and other ‘emerging powers’
 the changing nature of power and power relations.
Decline of the USA?
Debates about the decline of the USA’s global hegemony are nothing new. They date 
back to the late 1950s and the launch by the USSR of the Sputnik satellite. During the 
1970s and 1980s, it became fashionable to proclaim that the USA had been eclipsed 
by resurgent Japan and Germany, the USA succumbing to a tendency, common 
amongst earlier great powers, to imperial over-reach (see p. 480). However, the 
issue has resurfaced with renewed force in the early twenty-first century. Although 
judgements about a state’s ranking within a hierarchy are bedevilled by the complex 
and multifaceted nature of global power, the idea of US decline has been linked to a 
number of developments.
The USA’s military dominance over the rest of the world is, undeniably, huge. In 
2022, the USA accounted for nearly 40 per cent of the world’s military spending, 
and nearly three times that of China, the second largest military spender. Even more 
significantly, the USA has unmatched power projection, allowing it to deploy its 
forces anywhere in the world, with several hundred foreign installations and facilities 
in over 100 countries, as well as an enormous lead in aircraft carriers, ballistic 
missiles and long-range aircraft. Yet, preponderant military power may no longer be 
Hegemon: A leading or 
paramount power.
Multipolarity: An 
international system in 
which there are three 
or more power centres, 
creating a bias in favour 
of fluidity and, perhaps, 
instability.
Great power: A state 
deemed to rank amongst 
the most powerful in a 
hierarchical state system, 
reflecting its influence 
over minor states.
Imperial over-reach:
The tendency for 
imperial expansion to be 
unsustainable as wider 
military responsibilities 
outstrip the growth of the 
domestic economy.
Power projection: The 
ability of a state to deploy 
and sustain military forces 
beyond its borders.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 479 23-07-2024 13:00:52480 POLITICS
a secure basis for hegemony. There is a huge gap between the destructive capacity of 
the US military machine and what it can achieve politically. The difficulty of winning 
asymmetrical wars in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrate how the use of terrorist, 
guerrilla and insurrectionary tactics can thwart even the most advanced power.
CONCEPT
Imperialism
Imperialism is, broadly, 
the policy of extending 
the power or rule of a 
state beyond its borders. 
In its earliest usage, 
imperialism was an 
ideology of conquest 
and expansion, designed 
either to extend 
dynastic authority or 
to further nationalist 
ambitions. The term is 
now more commonly 
used to describe 
any form of external 
domination, and includes 
both the imposition of 
direct political control 
through colonialism (see 
p. 163) and economic 
exploitation in the 
absence of political 
rule, or neocolonialism. 
Marxists and realists 
disagree over whether 
imperialism is essentially 
an economic or a 
political phenomenon.
FOCUS ON . . . 
DIMENSIONS OF GLOBAL POWER
There is no agreement about the precise factors that allow states and other key actors to exert 
influence on the world stage. Nevertheless, global power can be seen to have a number of 
dimensions:
 Military power: For many commentators, power in international politics boils down to 
military capacity. Realist theorists (see p. 459), for example, have traditionally favoured a 
‘basic force’ model of power, on the grounds that military capacity enables a country both to 
protect its territory and people from external aggression, and to pursue its interests abroad 
through conquest and expansion. Key factors are therefore the size of the armed forces; 
their effectiveness in terms of morale, training, discipline and leadership; and, crucially, 
their access to advanced weaponry and equipment. Nevertheless, military capabilities may 
not translate into genuine political efficacy, as the unusability of nuclear weapons in most 
circumstances demonstrates.
 Economic power: The ‘weight’ of states in international affairs is closely linked to their 
wealth and economic resources. This applies, in part, because economic development 
underpins military capacity, as wealth enables states to develop large armies, acquire 
modern weapons and wage costly or sustained wars. Modern technology and a vast 
industrial base also give states political leverage in relation to trading partners, especially 
if their national currency is so strong and stable that it is used as a means of international 
exchange. Liberals tend to argue that, in an age of globalization, trade has displaced war as 
the chief currency of international politics.
 ‘Soft’ power: Thinking about global power has conventionally focused on ‘hard’ power – 
the ability to affect the behaviour of others through the use of inducements or threats; 
in effect, a combination of economic and military power. ‘Soft’ power is ‘co-optive 
power’; it rests on the ability to shape the preferences of others by attraction, rather than 
coercion (Nye 2004). Whereas hard power draws on resources such as force, sanctions, 
payments and bribes, soft power operates largely through culture, political ideals and 
foreign policies (especially policies imbued with moral authority). However, soft-power 
strategies are seldom effective on their own – hard and soft power typically reinforce one 
another through what has been called ‘smart power’ (Nye 2008).
 Structural power: Structural power is the power to decide ‘how things are done’, reflected 
in the ability to shape the frameworks within which states relate to one another, relate 
to people or relate to corporate enterprises (Strange 1996). Of particular significance, 
in this respect, is the influence states exert through their participation within regimes 
and international organizations, allowing them to have a wider, if less tangible, impact 
on matters ranging from finance and trade to security and development. Nevertheless, 
structural power usually operates alongside ‘relational’ power (the direct influence one 
actor has on another actor), providing alternative ways of explaining how outcomes in 
international politics are determined.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 480 23-07-2024 13:00:52WORLD ORDER AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE 481
A major component of the debate about US power is the focus on its relative economic 
decline. Though the USA was by far the largest economy in the world throughout the 
twentieth century, it has now been largely equalled, and by some measures surpassed, 
by China, with India also catching up rapidly. On the other hand, the USA continues 
to account for about 40 per cent of world spending on research and development, 
giving it a significant technological lead over other countries and ensuring high 
productivity levels. Just as the British Empire remained a global hegemon until 
the mid-twentieth century, despite being overtaken in economic terms by the USA 
and Germany in the late nineteenth century, the USA may continue to exert global 
leadership in a world in which it is no longer the economic number one.
US power, nevertheless, may have declined more in terms of ‘soft’ power than in 
terms of ‘hard’ power. This has happened in a number of ways. The USA’s reputation 
has been damaged by its association with corporate power and by widening global 
inequality, with resentment developing against what has been seen as ‘globalization￾as-Americanization’. As discussed above, serious damage has also been done to the 
USA’s moral authority by the ‘war on terror’ generally and the Iraq War in particular, 
made worse by the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and in the Guantánamo 
detention camp. Such developments were nevertheless counterbalanced by the USA’s 
unrivalled structural power (see p. 480). This derived from the disproportional 
influence that the USA exercised over the liberal international system, composed, as 
it was, of multinational organizations (including the institutions of global economic 
governance (see pp. 488–491), the UN and NATO) and a network of alliances and 
partnerships. The willingness of the USA to shoulder the burden of responsibility for 
establishing and enforcing the rules of the international system essentially stemmed 
from the liberal internationalist belief that the interests of the USA coincided with 
those of the system itself. This applies, in particular, in ensuring the stability of the 
world economy.
Nevertheless, the election of President Trump, riding a tide of populist nationalism, 
has led to a direct and thoroughgoing attempt to disengage the USA from the liberal 
international system. By adopting the slogan ‘America First’ in his inauguration address 
in January 2017, Trump embraced a narrow sense of the USA’s national interest that 
appears to leave little scope for global leadership in its traditional sense. Evidence of 
this shift in foreign policy has included the withdrawal of the USA from a range of 
international treaties (including the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear agreement 
and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia), the adoption of a more 
questioning approach to the UN, NATO and NAFTA, and the introduction of steep tariffs 
on billions of dollars’ worth of goods from the EU, Canada, Mexico and China. While 
President Joe Biden’s election in 2020 heralded a return somewhat to internationalism in 
US foreign policy, some have claimed that the ‘American century’, which began in 1917 
with the USA’s entry into the First World War, ended 100 years later.
Rise of China and ‘the rest’
Of all the powers that may rival, or even eclipse, the USA, the most significant is 
undoubtedly China. Indeed, many predict that the twenty-first century will become 
the ‘Chinese century’, just as the twentieth century had been the ‘American century’. 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 481 23-07-2024 13:00:52482 POLITICS
The basis for China’s great power status is its rapid economic progress since the 
introduction of market reforms in 1978 under Deng Xiaoping, in a self-proclaimed 
‘second revolution’. Annual growth rates of between 8 and 10 per cent for almost 
thirty years (about twice the levels achieved by the USA and other Western states) 
meant that China became the world’s largest exporter in 2009, and in the 2010s, 
depending on the measure used, became the world’s largest economy. With the world’s 
largest population (1.43 billion in 2023), China has a seemingly inexhaustible supply 
of labour, allowing it to become the manufacturing heart of the global economy. 
China’s emerging global role is evident in the influence it now exerts within the 
World Trade Organization (WTO) and the G20 over issues such as climate change 
and in its burgeoning resource links with Africa, Australia and parts of the Middle 
East and Latin America. An often-neglected aspect of China’s growing influence 
is the extraordinary rise of its ‘soft’ power. This reflects both the significance of 
Confucianism (see p. 134) in providing a cultural basis for cooperation in Asia, and 
the attraction of its anti-imperialist heritage in Africa and across much of the global 
South. Chinese aid to the developing world has been ongoing since the 1970s and 
has grown significantly in recent decades, particularly to smaller or poorer nations 
in Africa, Central Asia and the Pacific. This chequebook diplomacy has allowed it 
to accumulate increasing structural power in international forums like the United 
Nations General Assembly, where such nations represent a significant voting bloc, 
and to help win international recognition for its territorial claims over Taiwan (see p.
161) and in the South China Sea.
Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who was appointed general secretary of the 
Chinese Communist Party (and thereby China’s president) in 2012, China has 
gone through what is sometimes called a third revolution (after the 1949 Maoist 
revolution and the beginning of market reforms under Deng in the late 1970s). 
Key developments in the domestic sphere have included the introduction of an 
anti-corruption campaign, the abolition of the deeply unpopular one-child policy 
and a consolidation of personal power that has seen Xi become the most powerful 
Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. In economic affairs, ‘Dengist’ economic reforms 
have either been slowed down or reversed, and the role of state-owned enterprises 
has been strengthened. Under Xi, China has also moved away from its traditional 
commitment to a low-profile foreign policy, becoming instead a growing presence 
on the international stage (Economy 2018). Among other things, this has been 
evident in China’s determination to extend its control over disputed islands in the 
South and East China Seas, and in the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, 
a massive regional infrastructure plan that stretches across Asia and which first 
carried transport in 2018.
Nevertheless, the rise of China is often seen as part of a larger shift in the balance 
of global power. It has been claimed that power has shifted from the West to the 
East, and specifically to Asia, and maybe from the USA to the BRICS countries, 
sometimes dubbed ‘the rest’, with the resurgence of Russia being part of the same 
process, as demonstrated by the conflict in Ukraine (see p. 486). While advanced 
Western economies like the US, Japan and the European Union accounted for nearly 
two-thirds of global economic output at the end of the Cold War, in the 2020s that 
share had fallen to around 40 per cent, with emerging and developing economies,

led by the BRICS, collectively overtaking them. An alternative scenario is that the 
twenty-first century will not so much be the ‘Chinese century’ as the ‘Asian century’, 
with India, Japan and South Korea also being key actors. The transformation of India 
into an emerging power has been based on economic growth rates only marginally 
less impressive than China’s. In 2023, China and India jointly accounted for half of 
the world’s GDP.
KEY THINKER
MAO ZEDONG (MAO TSE-TUNG) (1893–1976)
Chinese Marxist theorist and leader of the People’s Republic of China, 1949–76. Mao was 
the son of a peasant farmer in Hunan. He initially worked as a librarian and teacher. In 1921, he 
helped to found the Chinese Communist Party and, in 1935, became its leader. As a political 
theorist, Mao adapted Marxism–Leninism to the needs of an overwhelmingly agricultural and 
still traditional society. His legacy is often associated with the Cultural Revolution (1966–70), 
a radical egalitarian movement that denounced elitism and ‘capitalist roaders’ (these inclined 
to bow to pressure from bourgeois forces), and that resulted in widespread social disruption, 
repression and death. Maoism is usually understood as an anti-bureaucratic form of Marxism 
that places its faith in the radical zeal of the masses.

However, the continued forward march of a Chinese-led Asia, or the BRICS 
countries, cannot be taken for granted. In addition to showing signs of an economic 
slowdown since 2011, the Chinese economy remains heavily dependent on cheap 
labour, and a transition to a more highly technologized economy based on advanced 
skills and production techniques has yet to be achieved. The most serious challenge 
facing China, however, may be how it reconciles tensions between its political and 
economic structures. While the Chinese political system remains firmly based on 
single-party rule by the Chinese Communist Party (see p. 285), its economic system 
is increasingly market-orientated and firmly embedded in the global capitalist 
system. Although authoritarianism (see p. 139) may have advantages in terms 
of managing large-scale economic change and, for instance, pushing through 
audacious infrastructure programmes, it may be unable to cope with the pluralizing 
and liberalizing pressures generated by a market capitalist system.
Moreover, neither China nor any of the other BRICS countries have thus far openly 
challenged the diplomatic and political hegemony of the USA. This is both because 
they recognize that US hegemony has a variety of advantages (not least that the 
USA contributes disproportionately to maintaining the international frameworks 
through which they increasingly exert influence) and because their desire for 
economic development takes precedence over geopolitical leadership. Finally, the 
capacity of the BRICS countries to act as a single entity is severely restricted by 
political, ideological and economic differences among its members. The Shanghai 
Cooperation Organization (SCO), established jointly by China and Russia in 2001, 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 483 23-07-2024 13:00:53484 POLITICS
is the most concerted effort yet by several BRICS to exert political, economic and 
military power in a coordinated way that might rival Western organizations like 
NATO. However, conflicting agendas and a lack of financial commitment from 
member states have prevented the SCO from acting as little more than a forum for 
discussion and trade negotiations. Indeed, the principal significance of the BRICS 
countries may be less that they reflect the common interests of ‘the rest’ and more 
that they represent a device through which China can bolster its position in relation 
to the USA, without risking a direct confrontation that may endanger its ‘peaceful 
rise’ (see p. 485).
Changing nature of power and power relations
Multipolar trends are not only evident in the decline of old powers and the growth 
of new powers, but also in the wider diffusion of power beyond the control of any 
state. This has been evident in globalization’s tendency to strengthen the role of 
non-state actors. Transnational corporations (TNCs) (see p. 183), for example, 
increasingly dominate the global economy, accounting for about 50 per cent of world 
manufacturing production and over 70 per cent of world trade. Moreover, TNCs 
are able to elude political control because of the ease with which they can locate 
investment and production. Similarly, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (see 
p. 302) have proliferated since the 1980s, coming to exercise powerful influence within 
international organizations such as the European Union and the United Nations. 
As well as power being reapportioned amongst the states of the world, and between 
states and non-state actors of various kinds, there are reasons for thinking that the 
nature of power is changing in ways that make its concentration in a small number 
of hands increasingly difficult to sustain. This has happened in two main ways. First, 
due to technology, and in a world of global communications, rising literacy rates 
and educational standards, ‘soft’ power has become as important as ‘hard’ power 
in influencing political outcomes. Military power, the traditional currency of world 
politics, has certainly not become irrelevant, but its use is greatly undermined when 
it is not matched by ‘hearts and minds’ strategies. For instance, the use of ‘shock and 
awe’ tactics by the US military in Iraq, and other demonstrations of US coercive 
power, may have been counterproductive, in that they damaged the USA’s reputation 
and its moral authority, particularly across the Arab and Muslim worlds.
Second, new technology has, in a number of ways, altered power balances both 
within and between societies, often empowering the traditionally powerless. For 
instance, al-Qaeda’s influence on world politics after 9/11 was out of all proportion 
to its organizational and economic strength, because modern technology, in the form 
of bombs and aircraft, had given its terrorist activities a global reach. Advances in 
communication technology, particularly the use of mobile phones and the internet, 
have also improved the tactical effectiveness of loosely organized groups, ranging from 
terrorist bands to protest groups and social movements. Finally, public opinion around 
the world, and thus the behaviour of governments, is affected by the near-ubiquitous 
access to television and the wider use of satellite technology. This ensures, for example, 
that pictures of devastation and human suffering – whether caused by warfare, famine 
or natural disasters – are shared across the globe almost instantaneously.

DEBATING . . .
WILL CHINA’S RISE CONTINUE TO BE PEACEFUL?
China’s emergence is customarily referred to by Chinese authorities as its ‘peaceful rise’. This confounds the conventional 
expectation that emerging powers become great powers largely by building up military power and through the use of war. In 
this view, major shifts in world order are seldom accomplished peacefully, suggesting that war, in particular between ‘rising’ 
China and the ‘declining’ USA, is likely, if not inevitable. Is China a rising power of a different kind? Has military power 
become redundant in world affairs?
YES NO
Implications of interdependence. The key reason why 
China’s rise has been, and will continue to be, peaceful 
is that it is taking place within an international system 
shaped by globalization. Globalization reduces the 
incidence of war in two main ways. First, rising states 
such as China no longer need to make economic gains 
by conquest because globalization offers a cheaper and 
easier route to national prosperity, in the form of trade. 
Second, by significantly increasing levels of economic 
interdependence, globalization makes a Chinese 
recourse to war almost unthinkable. This is because of 
the economic costs that war would involve – destroyed 
trade partnerships, lost external investment and so on.
‘Soft’ balancing. Neorealist theorists argue that, 
confronted by a rising or major power, other states 
will tend to ‘balance’ (oppose or challenge that power 
for fear of leaving themselves exposed), rather than 
‘bandwagon’ (side with that power; that is, ‘jump on the 
bandwagon’). However, China’s inclination to ‘balance’ 
against the USA will be confined to the adoption of ‘soft’ 
(non-military) balancing strategies, because the latter’s 
huge military dominance is unlikely to be abandoned in 
the near future. Similarly, the likelihood that the USA will 
adopt ‘hard’ (military) balancing strategies against China 
has greatly reduced due to the difficulties it experienced 
in waging the ‘war on terror’.
Sino–US bipolar stability. As the twenty-first century 
progresses, world order may be reshaped on a bipolar, 
rather than multipolar, basis. The military, economic and 
structural strengths of the USA are not going to fade 
soon, and China, already an economic superpower, is 
clearly not merely one of ‘the rest’. Sino–US relations 
may, as a result, come to replicate US–USSR relations 
during the ‘long peace’ of the Cold War period. In other 
words, bipolarity will, once again, prove to be the surest 
way of preventing rivalry and hostility spilling over into 
aggression, as it provides the most favourable conditions 
for a stable balance of power.
Multipolar instabilities. China’s rise is part of a wider 
restructuring of world order, in which global power is 
being distributed more widely. Neorealists argue that such 
multipolarity creates conditions that are inherently prone 
to conflict and instability, making it increasingly unlikely 
that China will maintain its ‘peaceful rise’. As multipolarity 
favours fluidity and uncertainty, shifting alliances and power 
imbalances, it creates opportunities (just as in the run-up 
to the First World War and the Second World War) for 
ambitious states to make a bid for power through conquest 
and expansion. As states seek to maximize power, and not 
merely security, such circumstances make great powers 
prone to indiscipline and risk-taking (Mearsheimer 2001).
Cultural and ideological rivalry. Sino–US bipolarity may 
pose a greater threat to global peace than did Cold War 
bipolarity. Whereas antagonism between the USA and the 
USSR was primarily ideological in character, in the case of 
‘liberal-democratic’ USA and ‘Confucian’ China ideological 
differences are rooted in deeper cultural divisions. These may 
provide the basis for growing enmity and misunderstanding, 
in line with the ‘clash of civilizations’ thesis. The transfer 
of hegemony from the British Empire in the nineteenth 
century to the USA in the twentieth century may, thus, 
have remained peaceful only because of cultural similarities 
that allowed the UK to view the ‘rising’ USA as essentially 
unthreatening.
Flashpoints. There are various flashpoints that have the 
potential to turn tension and hostility into aggression. 
Chief amongst these is Taiwan, where US support for an 
independent and ‘pro-Western’ Taiwan (see pp. 161–162) 
clashes with China’s quest to incorporate Taiwan into 
‘greater China’ (Carpenter 2006). Other issues that 
may inflame Sino–US relations include Tibet, where 
Beijing’s policy of aggressive ‘Sinofication’ conflicts with 
Washington’s unofficial support for Tibetan independence; 
human rights generally, but especially China’s treatment 
of ‘pro-democracy’ dissidents; and the future of disputed 
islands in the East and South China Seas.

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: A CHALLENGE TO THE GLOBAL ORDER
In February 2022, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine, 
with infantry, armoured and air divisions crossing over its 
borders, and missile attacks striking Ukrainian cities. The 
pretext of the invasion was ‘peacekeeping’ to protect the 
breakaway pro-Russian republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, 
who, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, faced 
‘humiliation and genocide’ at the hands of Ukraine. Putin 
also claimed that the Ukrainian government was neo-Nazi 
in character and building up nuclear weapons and military 
forces, framing Russia’s attack as a pre-emptive strike to 
protect itself (see p. 478). The roots of the conflict go 
back much farther, however. Ukrainians and Russians are 
closely related, ethnically, culturally and linguistically, and a 
distinct Ukrainian identity only became widely recognized 
in the early twentieth century. United with Russia as part 
of the Soviet Union, Ukraine broke away in 1991, but with 
many unresolved questions over its borders, and a split in 
its population between a Ukrainian-speaking majority in 
the west of the country, and significant Russian-speaking 
minority in the east. The Ukrainian-speaking majority 
began to increasingly look to the West for economic and 
diplomatic relations. Russia, meanwhile, was anxious to 
prevent Ukraine from falling into the Western sphere of 
influence, seeing it as a crucial buffer state between itself 
and NATO. In its first decades of independence, a careful 
balancing act was the result.
That balance began to unravel in 2013 when Ukrainian 
President Viktor Yanukovych abandoned an agreement on 
closer ties with the EU, announcing instead that he would 
seek closer cooperation with Russia. A wave of popular 
protest followed that saw Yanukovych removed from power 
by the Ukrainian parliament, which in turn prompted outrage 
from pro-Russian Ukrainians. Within months, unmarked 
gunmen and pro-Russian militants had seized control of 
Crimea, a coastal region of Ukraine with a Russian-speaking 
majority, while two breakaway republics in Donetsk and 
Luhansk were established by insurrectionists secretly supplied 
by Russia. A tense standoff ensured. In 2020, President 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy began to engage in discussions about a 
possible path for Ukraine to join NATO, an outcome Vladimir 
Putin deemed unacceptable to Russian interests. The next 
year, Putin published an essay proclaiming the historical 
unity of the Russian and Ukrainian people and questioning 
the legitimacy of Ukraine’s independence. Putin’s positions 
were widely seen as part of a larger project imperialist project, 
aimed at eventually recapturing all the former territories of 
the Soviet Union (Snyder 2022). The purpose behind this 
larger project was not merely to decisively restore Russia’s 
great power status, but also to shore up Putin’s popularity and 
therefore the stability of his regime.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the next year, however, 
did not go to plan. Though it attempted, and perhaps 
expected, a quick victory by striking hard and fast at the 
capital Kyiv, Ukraine quickly arranged a dogged resistance, 
while Russia’s forces became overextended trying to fight 
across vast distances and multiple fronts. Within months, 
it became apparent that a quick victory would not be 
forthcoming, and Russia’s strategy changed to a more 
concentrated push in the east.
The international response to the invasion has been 
conflicted and evolving, reflecting the complexity of 
international action in a multipolar, globalized world. While 
nearly all have agreed that Russia’s invasion is an illegal 
act, direct foreign intervention has been ruled out by 
NATO and the EU, unwilling to risk a wider war in Europe. 
Economic sanctions and boycotts have been pursued, but 
these have come at a significant cost to all parties, due to 
the centrality of Russia to the global oil, mining, chemical 
and natural gas supply chains. Moreover, while not 
supporting the invasion outright, major powers like China 
and India have pursued a more ambivalent position and 
have continued to trade with Russia, preventing economic 
boycotts from being truly effective.

GLOBAL GOVERNANCE
Rise of global governance
The issue of world order tends to focus on an image of international politics in which 
states are assumed to be the primary actors, world affairs largely being determined by 
the (sometimes shifting) distribution of power amongst states. However, this only gives 
us partial insight into the workings of the modern international system. A further major 
component is the framework of global governance, which, to a greater or lesser extent, 
helps to shape interactions among states. But what is global governance? Why has it 
developed, and how significant is it? Global governance has been described as a ‘collection 
of governance-related activities, rules and mechanisms, formal and informal, existing at a 
variety of levels in the world today’ (Karns and Mingst 2009). Global governance hovers 
somewhere between the traditional idea of international anarchy (in which states interact 
in the absence of a supranational authority) and the fanciful idea of world government 
(in which all of humankind is united under one common political authority) (Bull 2002). 
As such, global governance is a process of interactive decision-making that allows still￾sovereign states to engage in sustained cooperation and, at times, undertake collective 
action. The growth in the number and importance of international organizations has 
certainly been a key factor in the emergence of a system of global governance, to such an 
extent that global governance is sometimes, in effect, used as a collective term describing 
the international organizations currently in existence. However, global governance 
and an international organization are not synonymous, as the former has mixed actor 
involvement, featuring (in addition to states and international organizations) NGOs, 
TNCs and other institutions of global civil society (see p. 115).
The rise of international organizations nevertheless provides an indication of the 
growing significance of global governance. The end of the Second World War marked 
the emergence of a global governance system with the creation of the United Nations 
and the institutions of the Bretton Woods system (examined in the next section). 
By 1949, the number of international organizations stood at 123, compared with 
forty-nine in 1914. Today, there are tens of thousands of international organizations 
serving a bewildering number of functions, from regulating tuna fishing to setting 
The greater victory for Ukraine has arguably come from 
its ‘soft’ power campaign. Global media coverage of the 
brave resistance of the Ukrainian people against a much 
larger aggressor, and the personal diplomacy of Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy, has won over public opinion in many nations, 
whose governments have progressively escalated financial 
and military aid. Crucial support for Ukraine has come in 
the form of military hardware and training to the Ukrainian 
armed forces, and tens of thousands of foreign volunteers 
who have travelled to Ukraine to join the fight. Meanwhile 
Russia’s international reputation has plummeted and has 
turned the Ukrainian population decisively towards a pro￾Western outlook. Ukraine became a candidate member 
of the European Union in late 2022, while Finland ended 
its traditional middle course between the West and Russia 
by joining NATO in 2023. To the extent that Russia was 
attempting to challenge the global order and assert itself 
as a rival power in European affairs, the Ukrainian invasion 
seems to have backfired. While Russia has received tacit 
support from counties like China, few would-be allies 
have been willing to risk the political fallout of openly 
collaborating with Russia. Rather than flexing the strength 
of the emerging global powers, the invasion of Ukraine 
seems to have reinforced the strength of the Western-led 
global order. As casualties and costs mount, commentators 
have questioned what the endgame could now be for 
Russia in a war that increasingly looks unwinnable.

Global governance
Global governance 
refers to a broad, 
dynamic and complex 
process of interactive 
decision-making at the 
global level, involving 
formal and informal 
mechanisms, as well as 
governmental and non￾governmental bodies. 
Global governance 
is characterized by 
polycentrism (different 
institutional frameworks 
and decision-making 
mechanisms operate in 
different issue areas), 
intergovernmentalism
(states and national 
governments retain 
considerable influence 
within the global 
governance system) and 
mixed actor involvement 
(the public/private divide 
is blurred through the 
involvement of NGOs, 
TNCs, and the like).

international postage rates. Liberals such as Robert Keohane tend to explain such 
developments in terms of growing interdependencies amongst states, associated 
with concerns about power politics, economic crises, human rights violations, 
development disparities and environmental degradation. International organizations 
are therefore a reflection of the extent of interdependence in the global system, an 
acknowledgement by states that, increasingly, they can achieve more by working 
together than by working separately. In this view, states will cooperate when each 
calculates that it will make ‘absolute’ gains as a result.
Realists, in contrast, tend to explain the growth of global governance in terms of the 
emerging hegemonic role of the USA, which saw the pursuit of US national interests and 
the promotion of international cooperation as mutually sustaining goals. International 
organization is linked to hegemony because only a hegemonic state possesses the power 
to tolerate the ‘relative’ gains that other states may make, so long as they make ‘absolute’ 
gains themselves. From this perspective, a hegemon needs not only to be able to enforce 
the ‘rules of the game’, but also to be committed to a system that brings benefit to the 
mass of states. Critical theorists, for their part, tend to view international organizations 
as devices constructed to serve the dominant interests of the global system – the 
hegemonic power; Western industrialized states generally; TNCs and social, ethnic and 
gender elites across the global North. In this view, international organizations reflect 
and, to some degree, exist to consolidate global inequalities and asymmetries.
The extent to which the modern world conforms to the features of a global 
governance system is nevertheless a source of debate. Liberal theorists, in particular, 
not only argue that global governance is a meaningful development, providing an 
alternative to the international anarchy of old, but also claim that the trend in its 
favour is unmistakable and, perhaps, irresistible. This is based on two factors. First, 
thanks to globalization and the development of a generally more interconnected 
world, states are increasingly confronted by challenges that are beyond their capacity 
to deal with when acting alone. In short, global problems require global solutions. 
Second, the growth of international organizations fosters further cooperation by 
strengthening trust amongst states, accustoming them to rule-governed behaviour. 
This suggests that the trend in favour of global governance generates an internal 
momentum, making it difficult to reverse. However, the extent to which the world 
as a whole has become orderly and norm-governed should not be exaggerated. It 
is more accurate to refer to an emerging global governance process, rather than 
an established global governance system. Moreover, the norms and rules of global 
governance are better established in some parts of the world than in others. Finally, 
the revival of nationalism, particularly from the second decade of the twenty-first 
century onwards, has dented faith in international or global solutions generally.
Global economic governance
Evolution of global economic governance
The trend towards global governance has been particularly evident in the sphere 
of economic policy-making. This is because economics is the most obvious area 
of interdependence amongst states, and the area where the failure of international 
cooperation can cause the clearest damage. Since 1945, a system of global economic

Interdependence
Interdependence 
refers to a relationship 
between two parties in 
which each is affected 
by decisions that are 
taken by the other. 
Interdependence implies 
mutual influence, 
even a rough equality 
between the parties 
in question, usually 
arising from a sense of 
mutual vulnerability. 
Keohane and Nye 
(1977) advanced 
the idea of ‘complex 
interdependence’ as an 
alternative to the realist 
model of international 
politics. This highlights 
the extent to which 
(1) states have ceased 
to be autonomous 
international actors; (2) 
economic and other 
issues have become 
more prominent in world 
affairs; and (3) military 
force has become a 
less reliable and less 
important policy option.

governance has emerged through a thickening web of multilateral agreements, formal 
institutions and informal networks, with the most important institutions being those 
established by the Bretton Woods agreement, negotiated just before the end of the 
Second World War. Known, in due course, collectively, as the ‘Bretton Woods system’, 
these bodies were:
 the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), better 
known as the World Bank
 the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was replaced in 1995 
by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
The Bretton Woods agreement is a clear example of the multilateralism (see p. 490)
that was to become increasingly prominent in the post-1945 period. However, it 
would be a mistake to portray Bretton Woods simply in terms of multilateralism and 
the recognition of mutual interests. This would be to ignore the crucial role played 
by the USA, which emerged from the Second World War as the world’s predominant 
military and economic power, and which linked its continuing prosperity to the 
establishment of an open and stable international economic system. At the centre of 
the Bretton Woods system was a new monetary order, overseen by the IMF, which 
sought to maintain stable exchange rates. This was achieved by fixing all currencies 
to the value of the US dollar, which acted as a ‘currency anchor’, with the US dollar 
being convertible to gold at a rate of $35 per ounce. For at least two decades, the 
Bretton Woods system appeared to be a remarkable success. Instead of the end of the 
Second World War, and the consequent drop in military expenditure, bringing back, 
as some had feared, the dark days of the Great Depression, it heralded the onset of 
the ‘long boom’ of the post-war period, the longest period of sustained economic 
growth the world economy had ever experienced.
However, the ‘golden age’ of the 1950s and 1960s was followed by the ‘stagflation’ 
of the 1970s, in which economic stagnation and rising unemployment were linked 
to high inflation. In this context, and with the US economy struggling to cope with

US international relations theorist. With his long-time collaborator, Joseph S. Nye, Keohane 
questioned some of the core assumptions of realist analysis in Transnational Relations and World 
Politics (1971), highlighting the increasing importance of non-state actors and of economic 
issues in world affairs. In Power and Interdependence: World Politics in Transition (1977), Keohane 
and Nye set out the theory of ‘complex interdependence’ as an alternative to realism. Since 
the publication of After Hegemony (1984), however, Keohane has attempted to synthesize 
structural realism and complex interdependence, creating a hybrid dubbed either ‘modified 
structural realism’ or ‘neoliberal institutionalism’.

spiralling spending at home and abroad, in 1971 the USA abandoned the system 
of fixed exchange rates – signalling, in effect, the end of the Bretton Woods system 
in its original form. The advent of ‘floating’ exchange rates initiated a major policy 
and ideological shift. In policy terms, it gave rise to the Washington consensus (see 
p. 185). In ideological terms, the IMF, GATT and the World Bank were converted 
during the 1970s and 1980s to the idea of an international economic order based on 
free-market and free-trade principles. The replacement of GATT by the World Trade 
Organization in 1995 strengthened the free-trade agenda and helped to accelerate 
the advance of economic globalization.
CONCEPT
Multilateralism
Multilateralism can 
broadly be defined 
as a process that 
coordinates behaviour 
amongst three or more 
countries on the basis of 
generalized principles of 
conduct (Ruggie 1992). 
For a process to be 
genuinely multilateral, 
it must conform 
to three principles. 
These principles are 
non-discrimination (all 
participating countries 
must be treated alike), 
indivisibility (participating 
countries must behave 
as if they were a single 
entity, as in collective 
security (see p. 462))
and diffuse reciprocity
(obligations amongst 
countries must have a 
general and enduring

Evaluating global economic governance
In its initial mission, as the guarantor of exchange rates stability, the IMF was highly 
successful for at least two decades. Nevertheless, the IMF became an increasingly 
controversial institution from the 1980s onwards. This was because it linked the 
provision of loans to developing and transition countries to conditions for ‘structural 
adjustment’ that reflected an unqualified faith in free markets and free trade. 
Supporters of the IMF argue that, despite short-term instability and insecurities, an 
adjustment to an open and market-based economy is the only reliable road to long￾term economic success. Other strengths of the IMF are that it will often provide loans 
to countries that can find no other source of finance, and that its interest rates may 
be more competitive than those otherwise available. However, critics have seen the 
IMF, and global economic governance generally, as the political arm of neoliberal 
globalization, forcing poor and vulnerable countries to accept a US business model

that better caters to the needs of Western banks and corporations than it does to 
long-term development needs. The fact that IMF intervention has often caused 
more problems than it has solved stems, critics allege, from its flawed development 
model, which fails to recognize the possibility of market failure or the drawbacks of 
economic openness. In the wake of the 2007–9 global financial crisis, the IMF was 
roundly criticized for not having prevented the crisis by highlighting the instabilities 
and imbalances that had produced it. This led to calls for the reform of the IMF, 
particularly with a view to strengthening its ability to regulate the global financial 
system. However, this has so far resulted in little more than a minor adjustment of 
voting rights in favour of developing states.
FOCUS ON . . . 
GLOBAL ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF): The IMF was set up to oversee the global rules 
governing money in general and, in particular, to maintain currency stability through a 
system of fixed exchange rates. Since 1971, the IMF has embraced a neoliberal economic 
model, and requires countries to carry out stringent market-based reforms as a condition 
for receiving assistance. The IMF has grown from its original twenty-nine members to 
190 members. Its headquarters are in Washington.
 The World Bank: The World Bank (formerly the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development) was designed to reduce the element of risk in foreign lending, thereby 
underpinning economic stability. Since the 1980s the Bank has geared its lending to 
‘structural adjustment’, the re-orientation of economies around market principles 
and their integration into the global economy. The World Bank’s headquarters are in 
Washington.
 The World Trade Organization (WTO): The WTO was established in 1995, replacing 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Created by the ‘Uruguay round’ 
of negotiations (1986–95), the WTO has wider and stronger powers than those of the 
GATT. The WTO’s mission is to ‘liberalize’ world trade and create an ‘open’ global trading 
system. However, the ‘Doha round’, which started in 2001, broke down in 2006 because 
of disagreements between developed and developing states. The WTO had 164 members 
in 2023, with a further twenty-five observer countries. Its headquarters are in Geneva.
In the early period, the World Bank concentrated on promoting post-war 
reconstruction. However, over time, promoting development became the principal 
focus of its work. During the 1970s, under the presidency of Robert McNamara 
(1968–81) the Bank placed an increased emphasis on poverty reduction. This 
involved, for example, promoting projects in rural development and concentrating 
on meeting basic needs. From the early 1980s onwards, and in conjunction with the 
IMF, the Bank embraced a strategy of ‘structural adjustment’. The market reforms 
that its programmes sought to promote were designed to re-establish as quickly as 
possible the credit-worthiness of developing countries in order to allow them to 
focus once again on the fight against poverty. During the 1990s, in the face of growing 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 491 23-07-2024 13:00:54492 POLITICS
criticism and the failure of many of its structural adjustment programmes, the Bank 
started to place less emphasis on macro-economic reform and greater emphasis on 
the social and human aspects of development. This new strategy has been dubbed 
the ‘post-Washington consensus’. Supporters of the World Bank highlight its success 
in transferring resources, through development projects, from wealthy countries to 
poorer ones. However, critics argue, variously, that its financing of development is 
insufficient; that its record of reducing poverty has often been poor; and that, together 
with the IMF and the WTO, it tends to uphold the imbalances and disparities of the 
global economic order, rather than challenge them.
In many ways, the emergence of the WTO was a response to the changing imperatives 
of the international trading system in the 1980s. The triumph of neoliberalism 
(see p. 178) and the acceleration of globalization created stronger pressure to advance 
the cause of free trade through a more powerful trade organization with broader 
responsibilities. The WTO is seen by some as a global economic government in the 
making. Its supporters argue that, in encouraging trade liberalization, it has made 
a major contribution to promoting sustainable growth in the world economy. Such 
a view is largely based on the belief that free and open trade is mutually beneficial 
to all the countries that engage in it. Trade liberalization is, thus, seen to sharpen 
competition, foster innovation and breed success for all. Nevertheless, the WTO has 
been no less controversial an organization than the IMF and the World Bank.
Many of the WTO’s critics focus on its basic principles, arguing that, far from bringing 
benefit to all, trade liberalization is responsible for structural inequalities and the 
weakening of workers’ rights and environmental protection. Furthermore, the WTO 
has been strongly critiqued for creating rules that are biased towards wealthy nations. 
For example, intellectual property rights have also been continuously expanded in 
recent decades, giving better and longer protection to the creators of copyrighted and 
patented works, mostly to the benefit of the developed world. For instance, products 
like medicines and genetically modified seeds may be kept artificially expensive and 
prohibited from replication for potentially decades in the developing world.
A final criticism highlights the weakness of the WTO, and specifically its inability to 
reconcile strongly held opposing views. This is evident in the near-collapse of the Doha 
Development Round of trade negotiations, which commenced in 2001. Negotiations 
have stalled because of disagreements, mainly over agricultural subsidies, between, 
on the one hand, developing countries and emerging economies, including China, 
and developed countries on the other hand. Such a failure has enabled the USA 
and the EU to maintain agricultural protectionism, while penalizing developing 
countries and the world’s poor, who would benefit most from reducing barriers and 
subsidies in farming.
The United Nations
Role of the United Nations
The United Nations is, without doubt, the most important international organization 
created to date and the heart of the emerging system of global governance. Established 
through the San Francisco Conference of 1945, it is the only truly global organization 
ever constructed, having a membership of 193 states and counting. The UN is, 
CONCEPT
Free trade
Free trade is a system of 
trading between states 
that is not restricted by 
tariffs or other forms 
of protectionism. In 
line with the theory of 
‘comparative advantage’, 
liberals argue that 
international trade 
benefits all countries 
that participate in 
it, not least through 
greater specialization. 
The political case for 
free trade is that, in 
deepening economic 
interdependence and 
fostering international 
exchange, it makes war 
less likely and, perhaps, 
impossible. Critics 
point out that free 
trade widens economic 
inequalities by giving 
dominant powers access 
to the markets of weak 
states, while having little 
to fear themselves from 
foreign competition.

nevertheless, a sprawling and complex organization, described by its second Secretary￾General, Dag Hammarskjöld, as ‘a weird Picasso abstraction’. Beyond its five major 
organs, it encompasses the so-called ‘three sisters’ – the World Bank, the IMF and 
the WTO – and also bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the 
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations High Commission 
for Refugees (UNHCR). Although this has created an organization that is highly 
cumbersome, often conflict-ridden and, some say, inherently inefficient, it also enables 
the UN to respond to myriad interests and to address an ever-widening global agenda.
The principal aims of the UN, spelled out by its founding Charter, are as follows:
 To safeguard peace and security in order ‘to save succeeding generations from the 
scourge of war’
 To reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights
 To uphold respect for international law
 To promote social progress and better standards of life.
FOCUS ON . . . 
HOW THE UNITED NATIONS WORKS
 The Security Council: This is the most significant UN body. Its key purpose is to ensure the 
maintenance of international peace and security, and so it is responsible for the UN’s role 
as a negotiator, observer and peacekeeper. The Security Council has fifteen members, but 
it is dominated by the P-5, its permanent ‘veto powers’ (the USA, Russia, China, the UK 
and France), which can block decisions made by other members of the Council.
 The General Assembly: This is the main deliberative organ of the UN, sometimes dubbed 
the ‘parliament of nations’. The Assembly consists of all members of the UN, each of 
which has a single vote. The Assembly can debate and pass resolutions on any matter 
covered by the Charter, but it has no legislative role and does not oversee or scrutinize, in 
any meaningful sense, the Security Council or the Secretariat.
 The Secretariat: This serves the other principal organs of the UN and administers the 
programmes and policies laid down by them. At its head is the Secretary-General (since 
2017, Antonio Guterres), who functions as the public face of the UN, as well as its 
chief administrative officer. The main activities of the Secretariat take place in the UN’s 
headquarters in New York.
 The Economic and Social Council: The ECOSOC consists of fifty-four members 
elected by the General Assembly. Its chief role is to coordinate the economic and social 
work of the UN. This involves overseeing the activities of a large number of programmes, 
funds and specialized agencies, such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) and 
the World Health Organization. Its main areas of concern are human rights, development 
and poverty reduction and the environment.
 The International Court of Justice: The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the UN. Its 
primary role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to 
it by states. Located in The Hague, Netherlands, the ICJ is composed of fifteen judges 
elected by the General Assembly and the Security Council, voting separately.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 493 23-07-2024 13:00:54494 POLITICS
Maintaining peace and security
The chief purpose of the UN is to maintain international peace and security, with 
responsibility for this being vested in the Security Council. Indeed, the performance 
of the UN can largely be judged in terms of the extent to which it has saved humankind 
from deadly military conflict. It is, nevertheless, difficult to assess the extent of the 
UN’s contribution to ensuring that the two world wars of the twentieth century have 
not been followed by World War III when other factors, not least the ‘balance of 
terror’ between the USA and the USSR, have also contributed (see p. 462). However, 
what is clear is that, being a creature of its members, the UN’s capacity to enforce a 
system of collective security (see p. 462) is severely limited. It can do no more than 
its member states, and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, 
permit. As a result, its role has essentially been confined to providing mechanisms 
that facilitate the peaceful resolution of international conflicts. During the Cold War, 
the UN was routinely paralysed by superpower rivalry that led to deadlock in the 
Security Council due to the power of its permanent members to veto resolutions. 
The UN, therefore, was a powerless spectator to Soviet interventions in Hungary, 
Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan; and American interventions in Vietnam, Panama 
and Grenada. A further weakness is that the UN has never been able to develop 
an armed force of its own, so that it has always had to rely on troops supplied by 
individual member states.
The end of the Cold War produced optimism about the capacity of an activist UN 
to preside over the ‘new world order’. The UN approved the US-led expulsion of 
Iraq from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War, and, in a few short years, the number of 
UN peacekeeping operations had doubled, and the annual budget for peacekeeping 
had quadrupled. Hopes for a more effective UN in the post-Cold War period 
were nevertheless dashed, both by a declining willingness of states, freed from 
East–West rivalry, to accept neutral, multilateral intervention, and by the 
eroding support, financial and military, of member states. A lack of political and 
military commitment by the USA and European states led to the collapse of UN 
peacekeeping missions in Somalia and Angola in 1990s. The unwillingness of UN 
forces to intervene to stop the Rwandan genocide has been particularly criticized 
as a failure of internationalism. Heightened tensions in an increasingly multipolar 
world have only exacerbated UN paralysis. For instance, almost no meaningful 
resolution on the Middle East has passed the Security Council in decades, despite 
being the most conflict-ridden region.
Economic and social development
As the membership of the UN expanded as a result of decolonization in the 1950s 
and 1960s, giving the developing world much greater influence over the General 
Assembly, the promotion of economic and social development became an increasingly 
prominent UN concern. The main areas of UN economic and social responsibility are 
human rights, development and poverty reduction, and the environment. In the case 
of human rights, the centrepiece of the international regime that has developed since 
the Second World War to promote and protect such rights has been the UN’s Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948. The incorporation of the Declaration 
into a legally binding codification of human rights – in effect, human rights law – was 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 494 23-07-2024 13:00:54WORLD ORDER AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE 495
achieved through the adoption in 1966 of the International Covenants on Civil and 
Political Rights, and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Collectively, the 1948 
Declaration and the two covenants are commonly referred to as the ‘International Bill 
of Human Rights’. However, the UN’s record of standing up to dictators, condemning 
human rights violations and intervening to prevent genocide and other comparable 
acts has been poor – a product, perhaps, of the moral relativism that has taken hold 
as the UN’s membership has expanded.
In the case of development and poverty reduction, the principal vehicle has been the 
UN Development Programme (UNDP), created in 1965. The UNDP has a presence 
in some 177 countries, working with them on their own solutions to global and 
national development challenges, and also helps developing countries to attract and 
use aid effectively. By focusing on the notions of ‘human development’ and ‘human 
security’ (see p. 471), the UNDP has fostered innovative thinking about poverty and 
deprivation, moving away from a narrowly economic definition of poverty. In 2015, 
the UN established seventeen Sustainable Development Goals to drive the work of 
global development, including the broader issues of human development, gender 
equality, affordable and clean energy, and inclusive and sustainable transportation.
In the case of the environment, the UN’s Conference on the Human Environment in 
Stockholm in 1972 laid the foundations for environmental action at an international 
level and prepared the way for the launch of the UN’s Environmental Programme 
(UNEP). Over time, the issue of climate change has come to dominate the UN’s 
environmental agenda, as a succession of high-profile conferences on the issue has 
been convened, albeit often with disappointing outcomes.
An indispensable body?
The UN is no stranger to controversy and criticism. Some, indeed, regard it as 
fundamentally flawed. In this view, the UN is a proto-world government, and has all 
the drawbacks of a would-be world government – a lack of legitimacy, accountability 
and democratic credentials. Not only does the UN interfere in the affairs of states, 
thereby eroding their sovereignty, but it also disrupts the workings of the balance￾of-power system, thus endangering the very peace and stability that it was set up to 
maintain. Others decry the UN’s ineffectiveness, rather than its capacity to meddle in 
world affairs. The organization is routinely sidelined as major world events unfold, not 
least because the Security Council can be so easily paralysed by conflict amongst the 
‘Big Five’. Further criticisms highlight the dysfunctionality of a body that functions as 
‘two UNs’, one of which serves as a voice for the great powers and operates through 
the Security Council, while the other articulates the interests of the developing world 
and operates through the General Assembly. While the former has huge potential 
power but seldom exercises it, the latter acts as little more than a debating society.
For all its flaws and failings, one central fact must be borne in mind: the world is a safer 
place with the UN than it would be without it. Although the UN will never be able 
to prevent all wars and resolve all conflicts, it provides an indispensable framework 
for cooperation, should the international community choose to use it. Moreover, the 
UN did not fossilize around its initial mission but, rather, succeeded in redefining 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_19.indd 495 23-07-2024 13:00:54496 POLITICS
itself in the light of new global challenges. Not only has the UN developed into the 
leading organization promoting economic and social development worldwide, but 
it has also helped to shape the agenda as far as new global issues are concerned. 
The World Health Organization, the UN agency dealing with health and medicine, 
played a leading role in coordinating the global response to Covid-19, and was 
particularly essential in providing assistance and supplies to the health agencies of 
poorer member nations to handle outbreaks in their communities. In short, if the 
UN did not exist, it would have to be invented.

BROKEN?
KEY ISSUES
 To what extent is political participation in crisis?

 If politics is broken, how can it be mended?
PREVIEW
In this concluding chapter, we return to some of the themes discussed in Chapter 1, and, in the process, draw 
together some of the themes set out at different points in the book. This is done by examining the nature and health 
of politics itself, taking particular account of how and why politics – and especially conventional, or ‘mainstream’, 
politics – has been subject to increasing criticism. Of course, there is nothing new about politics being viewed 
in a negative light – the term has long been used as a ‘dirty’ word, implying an activity that is distasteful, even 
demeaning. Politicians have usually borne the brunt of these attacks, with popular associations with ‘politician’ 
commonly including ‘liar’, ‘corrupt’, ‘careerist’ and ‘untrustworthy’. Nevertheless, commentators have expressed 
fears that we are now in an unprecedented era of disenchantment. Increasingly, politics appears to be losing its 
ability to engage and enthuse, as witnessed by declining levels of voter turnout and falling party membership – 
trends that are most pronounced in mature democracies and particularly affect younger people. However, this 
may be a misleading picture. Anxieties about growing political disenchantment, for instance, may ignore the extent 
to which political participation is not declining but changing, through, amongst other things, the rise of protest 
movements of various kinds or the spread of internet-based activism. It is also far from clear that the trends 
mentioned above can be laid at the door of politics and politicians; other possible culprits include the media and, 
perhaps, the public themselves. Finally, a better understanding of the causes of political disenchantment, at least in 
the realm of formal politics, should give us insight into how disenchantment and engagement of this kind can most 
effectively be countered. Among the possible solutions are extending the reach of democracy, rescaling politics on 
a more local basis, rebuilding citizenship and tackling inequality.

A CRISIS OF ‘ANTI-POLITICS’?
Having previously examined the idea of a crisis in democracy (in Chapter 4) and the 
notion of a crisis in party politics (in Chapter 11), this chapter focuses on the broader 
idea of a crisis in politics. On the face of it, it seems odd to suggest that politics is in 
crisis. In some respects, politics has never been healthier. Dramatic demonstrations 
of ‘people power’ have brought authoritarian regimes to their knees, as occurred 
in the Eastern European Revolutions of 1989–91 and at least the early phase of 
the Arab Spring. Insofar as politics (in the sense of compromise and consensus￾building) constitutes a distinctively non-violent means of resolving conflict, the 
long- and short-term decline in violence that has occurred mainly, but not only, in 
Western societies (Pinker 2011) surely provides evidence of both the effectiveness of 
politics and its wider use. Yet, in other respects, a heavy cloud hangs over politics. In 
particular, growing numbers of people appear to be disengaging from the political 
process, or expressing disenchantment with it. Why is ‘anti-politics’ on the march? 
Has politics become a problem, rather than a solution?
Declining political engagement?
It has long been assumed that the level of political engagement is an indication of the 
health of a political system. Democratic theorists have certainly argued that one of 
the key strengths of democratic rule (examined more fully in the final section of this 
chapter) is that it offers wider opportunities for popular participation than any other 
form of rule, ensuring not merely government for the people but also government by 
the people. Yet, however hard-won the rights of political participation (see p. 512)
may have been, especially the right to vote in free and fair elections, there is evidence 
(from mature democracies in particular) that citizens are becoming less interested in 
using these rights.
In Canada, for instance, voter turnout at federal elections averaged upwards of 75 
per cent between 1945 and 1990. Since that time, however, average voter turnout has 
declined to 64 per cent, including an all-time low of just under 59 per cent in 2008. 
Declining voter turnout in Canada has been particularly evident amongst younger 
voters, with eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds being the least likely to vote, and more 
than a third of Canadian voters cite a lack of interest in politics as a their primary 
reason for not voting (Statistics Canada 2022). Similar trends can be found across 
Western Europe, in Japan and in parts of Latin America, leading to the estimate that 
voter turnout has decreased globally by around 15 percentage points since the 1950s 
(Kostelka and Blais 2021). And declines in voter turnout at supranational, regional 
and local elections have tended to be even worse than declines in national elections 
(Lijphart 1996).
Civic disengagement goes well beyond non-voting, however. As discussed in 
Chapter 11, political parties in many parts of the world appear to be failing in their 
traditional role as agents of popular mobilization and political participation. This has 
been evident at a number of levels. Fewer people ‘identify’ with political parties than 
they once did, in the sense of having a psychological attachment or loyalty towards a 
party. This trend is called partisan dealignment (see p. 267) and has been associated 
with more volatile voting behaviour and a growing willingness to vote for ‘fringe’ 
Political engagement:
The participation of 
citizens in the life of their 
community, although this 
may range from formal 
political participation 
to wider communal 
activities or even ‘civic￾mindedness’.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_20.indd 499 23-07-2024 13:01:39500 POLITICS
parties. There is also evidence of a major long-term decline in party membership 
across established democracies. During 1980–2010, party membership dropped by 
1 million or more in Italy, France and the UK, around half a million in Germany and 
close to half a million in Austria. Norway and France have lost well over half their 
party members since the 1980s, while in 2010 fewer than 1 per cent of adults in the 
UK belonged to political parties, down from 7 per cent some fifty years ago.
Declines in party membership are also matched by declines in levels of party 
activism. Party members have increasingly become ‘cheque book members’, who are 
prepared to pay their membership fees but are less inclined to attend regular meetings 
or, in particular, get involved in canvassing or campaigning. Civic disengagement 
may nevertheless go beyond conventional forms of political participation, such as 
voting, party membership, and campaigning, and affect wider civic participation, in 
the form of church attendance, membership of professional societies, sports clubs, 
youth groups and parent-teacher associations, and the like. Robert Putnam (see 
p. 198) has interpreted such trends as evidence of declining ‘social capital’ in the 
USA and, by extension, other industrialized countries, and of the emergence of a 
‘post-civic’ generation.
However, the notion that modern societies suffer from a ‘participation crisis’ 
has also been criticized. The problem may not be so much that the overall level 
of political participation has fallen, but that there has been a shift from one kind 
of participation to another. In particular, as disillusionment and cynicism with 
mainstream politics has grown, there has been an upsurge in interest in pressure 
group politics, protest movements and the use of social media to facilitate political 
debate and activism. The rise of what has been called the ‘new politics’ – reflecting 
more fluid, participatory, non-hierarchical and, possibly, more spontaneous styles of 
political participation – has been linked, variously, to the emergence of postindustrial 
societies (as discussed in Chapter 8). As such, it may reflect a shift from a traditional 
conception of citizenship to a kind of ‘reflexive’ citizenship, through which citizens 
seek a more critical and reciprocal relationship with the structures of power.
The politics of ‘anti-politics’
The perception that politics is in crisis arises not merely from concerns about civic 
disengagement but also from evidence of growing cynicism about, and even anger 
towards, mainstream political parties, politicians, and even government more 
broadly. The Edelman Barometer, which tracks public trust in institutions, found in 
2023 that in most countries surveyed, corporations and industry were more trusted 
than governments. Moreover, trust in government was particularly problematic in 
established democracies – less than half of people surveyed in the USA, UK, Italy, 
Japan, Spain and Ireland expressed trust in their governments. This is in stark 
contrast with some autocratic regimes, where trust in government was higher than

What appears sometimes to be a breakdown in trust (see p. 501) between the public 
and the political class in general does not simply encourage citizens to turn away 
from politics and retreat into private existence. Instead, it has spawned new forms 
CONCEPT
Anti-politics
‘Anti-politics’ refers 
to a rejection of, 
and/or alienation 
from, conventional 
politicians and political 
processes, especially 
‘mainstream’ political 
parties and established 
representative 
mechanisms. One 
manifestation of anti￾politics is a decline in 
political engagement, as 
citizens turn away from 
politics and seemingly 
retreat into private 
existence. However, 
anti-politics has also 
spawned new forms 
of politics, which, in 
various ways, articulate 
disillusionment with 
established political 
structures and offer 
more ‘authentic’ 
alternatives.
Mainstream politics:
Political activities, 
processes and structures 
that are regarded as 
normal or conventional; 
the dominant trend in 
politics.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_20.indd 500 23-07-2024 13:01:39IS POLITICS BROKEN? 501
of politics, which, in various ways, seek to articulate resentment or hostility towards 
conventional political structures. Although such hostility is based on a common 
perception that established political elites are ‘out-of-touch’, ‘privileged’, ‘corrupt’ or 
‘self-serving’, anti-political groups and movements have taken very different forms. 
Certain forms of anti-politics clearly overlap with ‘new politics’, as in the case of the 
upsurge in anti-capitalist or anti-globalization protests since the late 1990s (see p.
316–318). The anti-capitalist movement has embraced an activist-based, theatrical 
style of politics. Its attraction, particularly to young people, is its resistance to 
compromise for the sake of political expediency, born out of a suspicion of structures 
and hierarchies of all kinds (including governmental arrangements and conventional 
parties), and the fact that it offers a form of politics that is decidedly ‘in the moment’.
However, anti-politics has also been articulated though a range of right-wing 
populist groups and movements that have arisen in recent decades. In many parts 
of Europe, for example, far-right groups have emerged that mix an appeal based on 
opposition to immigration, multiculturalism (see p. 205) and globalization (see p.
182) with avowed support for the ‘common man’ in the face of ‘corrupt’ economic 
and political elites. Similar tendencies were evident in the Tea Party movement in the 
USA, which emerged from 2009 onwards. Taking its name from the 1773 Boston Tea 
Party, the Tea Party built a separate and distinct political identity for itself around 
the commitment to tax cuts, reductions in federal government’s spending, support 
for unregulated markets, limited government and a strictly literal interpretation of 
the US constitution. While the significance of the Tea Party was largely restricted to 
its influence on the political balance within the Republican Party, other groups or 
movements deemed to be ‘anti-political’ have had a substantial and direct electoral 
impact. Examples of this include the 62 million people who backed Donald Trump 
in the 2016 US presidential election; the 17 million people who favoured Brexit in 
the UK’s EU referendum, also held in 2016; the more than 13 million people who 
supported Marine Le Pen in the 2022 French presidential election; and the 6 million 
people who voted for Alternative for Germany in the 2018 German general election.
WHY WE HATE POLITICS
However, as political disenchantment has moved from a predominantly ‘passive’ 
phase, associated largely with declining levels of political participation, to a more 
‘active’ phase, associated in particular with the upsurge in pluralism (see p. 109),
‘anti-politics’ has assumed a more raw and impassioned character. Mainstream 
politics does not just engender apathy and disengagement; it appears to breed 
frustration, anger and even hatred (Hay 2007). But where does this anger come from? 
Why, seemingly, do we hate politics? A number of explanations have been advanced, 
including the following:
 uninspiring party politics
 declining capacity to deliver
 the ‘wrong’ politicians
 media negativity
 the growth of consumerist politics.
CONCEPT
Trust
Trust means faith, 
a reliance on, or 
confidence in, the 
honesty, worth and 
reliability of another 
person. It is therefore 
based on expectations 
of others’ future 
actions. Political trust 
consists in the level 
of confidence people 
have in one another in 
discharging their civic 
responsibilities and, 
crucially, the confidence 
citizens have that 
politicians generally, and 
leaders in particular, will 
keep their promises and 
carry out their public 
duties honestly and 
fairly. In liberal theory, 
trust arises through 
voluntary contracts 
that we uphold through 
mutual self-interest. In 
communitarian theory, 
trust is grounded in a 
sense of social duty and 
a common morality.
Apathy: The absence of 
interest in, or enthusiasm 
for, things that are 
generally considered to be 
interesting.

Uninspiring party politics
There is no doubt that mainstream political parties have been the object of much of the 
criticism that is levelled at conventional politics. In large part, this has been because, 
under the pressures generated by electoral competition, the shift from programmatic 
political parties to ‘big tent’ parties (see p. 276) contributed to a process of ‘de￾ideologization’. As parties of both the left and the right became detached from their 
ideological roots, they lost their sense of purpose and direction, and failed to provide 
members and supporters alike with a basis for emotional attachment. Mainstream 
parties thus came to sell ‘products’ (leaders or policies), rather than hopes and 
dreams. Although their leaders became increasingly desperate to re-engage with 
what was called the ‘vision thing’, they had little idea how this could be accomplished.
A further implication of the displacement of ideological politics by managerial 
politics was that, regardless of party allegiance, all politicians came to look the same 
and sound the same. As major parties in particular sought to appeal to broadly 
the same groups of voters, party politics developed a strong centrist bias. Whereas 
elections once offered voters a choice between parties and policy programmes that 
had a distinctively left-wing or right-wing character, they came to be dominated by 
competition between centre-left and centre-right parties, with areas of disagreement 
being reduced, very much, to matters of detail or emphasis. The problem with this 
was that, by abandoning both major issues and ‘big’ choices, electoral battles became 
less gripping and less meaningful. In this context, politicians maintained their 
adversarial rhetoric by dramatically overstating minor or technical divisions – a 
psychological tendency that Sigmund Freud, the Austrian psychotherapist, referred 
to as ‘the narcissism of small differences’.
CONCEPT
Political 
participation
Political participation is 
the act of taking part in 
the formulation, passage 
or implementation of 
public policies. However, 
political participation 
takes place at very 
different levels. One 
classification scheme 
divides citizens into 
‘apathetics’ (who do 
not engage in formal 
politics), ‘spectators’ 
(who rarely participate 
beyond voting) and 
‘gladiators’ (who 
fight political battles) 
(Milbrath and Goel 
1977). Conventional 
participation most 
notably takes the 
form of voting, joining 
political parties or 
advocacy groups, 
campaigning, communal 
activity, running for 
office and contacting 
a representative or 
official about a particular 
personal matter.
David Cameron and Nick Clegg, who formed a coalition between their Conservative 
and Liberal Democrats parties after the UK general election of 2010, were often 
accused of looking and sounding the same.

Declining capacity to deliver
Growing political disenchantment may also reflect the declining capacity of political 
actors to ‘deliver the goods’ by affecting people’s lives and to bring about meaningful 
economic and social change. Particularly evident in the way in which national 
governments have experienced a narrowing span of control, this is a development 
that has raised questions about what politics is for. The loss of the capacity to deliver 
has happened in at least three ways.
First, the spread of neoliberalism (see p. 178) – which has occurred more dramatically 
in some countries than in others, but which has left few developed societies unaffected – 
has encouraged establishment forces generally to regard political involvement in 
matters of economics and social exchange as non-legitimate (Jones 2015). As the belief 
has taken root that the economy should, as far as possible, be ‘depoliticized’, projects of 
economic and social reform (such as nationalization, expanded social welfare and the 
redistribution of wealth from rich to poor), which were fashionable in the early post￾1945 period, became virtually unthinkable in mainstream political circles. The broader 
movement towards neoliberalism has also effectively disabled many of the traditional 
policy levers that governments used to manage the state and the economy for the 
public benefit. For instance, protectionist trade policies like tariffs and quotas were 
long used by governments to protect and grow domestic industries. Free trade has gone 
hand in hand with neoliberalism, and international treaties and organizations like the 
World Trade Organization (see pp. 488–491) have made it very hard for countries 
to pursue protectionist policies, particularly in developing countries. Combined with 
the enormous growth in the power of transnational corporations to influence policy, 
this can leave governments with a very constrained set of realistic policy options for 
governing, regardless of who is elected.
Second, a diminished capacity to deliver has been one of the key consequences 
of the advance of globalization (see p. 182). The growth of complex economic 
interdependence has meant, for example, that no state can be insulated from the 
impact of financial crises that take place in distant parts of the world, and that 
transnational corporations, which can switch investment and production to other 
parts of the world if state policy is not conducive to profit maximization, have 
become substantially more powerful. The ‘tyranny’ that global markets exercise over 
national economic decision-making places national politicians in the uncomfortable 
position that, while they may be confronted by rising demands and expectations 
on the part of the population at large, their ability to respond to these has shrunk. 
Domestic circumstances are thus increasingly shaped by events beyond government 
control. For instance, the Greek debt crisis and subsequent economic woes that 
began in 2007 led to several governments elected in and out of office over fifteen 
years by an electorate increasingly infuriated at the inability of each government to 
resolve the crisis. Yet Greece’s options were greatly constrained by its membership of 
the eurozone, and its economic dependence on large fellow members like Germany, 
which meant many of the most significant economic policy settings were determined 
by institutions beyond its borders.
Thirdly, there is a growing sense that many of the most important and publicly 
pressing issues faced by governments are so-called wicked problems. Such problems 
Wicked problem: A 
complex problem that is 
subject to changing and 
sometimes contradictory 
requirements, has no 
single solution and is 
intertwined with many 
other problems.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_20.indd 503 23-07-2024 13:01:40504 POLITICS
are complex, controversial, difficult to define and difficult to solve (Rittel and Webber 
1973). Homelessness, for example, has been on the rise internationally in the twenty￾first century, and governments around the world have faced significant public and 
media pressure to ‘solve’ the growing problem of people sleeping in public areas in their 
communities. Homelessness is a very complex problem with no single cause – housing 
affordability, unemployment, discrimination, climate, mental health, addiction, 
immigration, domestic violence and natural disasters are all contributing factors. 
Moreover, there is widespread public and political disagreement over the desirability 
of different policy options to deal with homelessness. Many options require significant 
resources to be implemented, high levels of coordination between different layers of 
government, and may take some time to before the effects are seen (Head 2022).
The ‘wrong’ politicians
There is nothing new about assaults on the character and reputation of politicians 
(Clarke et al. 2018). The first and, in a sense, ‘classical’ attack on politicians stresses the 
link between power and corruption, famously expressed in Lord Acton’s aphorism: 
‘Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.’ Politicians, 
furthermore, cannot avoid having ‘dirty’ hands. This is because so often they are forced 
to grapple with practical and moral dilemmas, making trade-offs that are, at best, 
ethically imperfect (Walzer 1974; Flinders 2012). However, the modern generation of 
politicians may be especially reviled. This may have happened due to the emergence, 
in recent decades, of a distinctive elected political class, whose members have little or 
no experience outside politics and so appear to live in a ‘bubble’, divorced from the 
cares and concerns of ‘ordinary’ people. In some countries, it has become increasingly 
common for political staffers, advisers and party operatives to become candidates for 
office themselves, or in some democracies for political dynasties within families to 
appear. Part of this may be driven by the growing cost and complexity of running 
for political office in democracies – the need for significant financial resources, 
widespread name recognition or connections within a political party, have made it 
harder for genuine ‘outsiders’ to run successful campaigns and win office. Several 
of the more successful populist ‘outsider’ campaigns have in fact been led by those 
with significant pre-existing wealth and media presence, like Thailand’s Thaksin 
Shinawatra, Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi, the US’s Donald Trump and the Kirchners of 
Argentina.
This tendency may be linked to the fact that communication and news management 
have become increasingly central to modern politics (as discussed in Chapter 9),
and this has impacted how politicians are recruited and behave. The spread of radio 
in the 1930s, and then television in the 1960s, made the ways politicians talked and 
looked far more important they had been in previous centuries, so much so that 
communications theorist Marshall McLuhan famously predicted that ‘the medium 
is the message’, meaning that how a person’s message was transmitted would be much 
more important than what they were saying (McLuhan 1962). This was seemingly 
confirmed by rise of a new generation of media-savvy politicians in the 1960s and 
1970s, like US President John F. Kennedy, Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, West 
German Chancellor Willy Brandt and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, 
whose public remarks, personalities and home lives played a far bigger role in media 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_20.indd 504 23-07-2024 13:01:40IS POLITICS BROKEN? 505
coverage and election campaigns than had previously been the case. Televised 
political debates and interviews became commonplace, and parties began investing 
significantly into media training and consultants. The rise of cable news, the internet 
and social media only increased the pressure throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Yet 
while politicians have become ever-more media conscious, scripted and polished in 
their public appearances, there has also arisen a problem of credibly – namely, voters 
are less inspired by prepared remarks, teleprompter speeches and carefully chosen 
words, instead desiring politicians who appear authentic – that is, more human, 
flawed and ‘real’ (Valgarðsson et al. 2021). US President Donald Trump’s brash and 
sometimes crude communication style, while unconventional, was a major draw 
card for some voters who took it as evidence of authenticity.
Media negativity
As discussed in Chapter 9, the media are sometimes charged with having created a 
climate of cynicism among the public, leading to growing political disenchantment 
and a lack of trust in governments and politicians of all complexions (Lloyd 
2004). This has occurred, in large part, because increasingly intense commercial 
pressures force the media to make their coverage of politics ‘sexy’ and attention￾grabbing. Routine political debate and analysis therefore receive less attention as the 
media focuses instead on – or ‘hypes’ – scandals of various kinds and allegations 
of incompetence, policy failure or simple inertia. No longer are there ‘problems’, 
‘challenges’ or ‘difficulties’, in politics; everything is a ‘crisis’. Healthy scepticism, 
which serves the interests of democracy and freedom, may, thus, have turned into 
corrosive and aggressive negativity. It is widely alleged that such a trend has become 
more pronounced due to the advent of social media. Not only is it argued that the 
civilities customarily observed in face-to-face interaction are often absent in online 
exchanges, but also lurid, sensational and sometimes outrageous posts travel further 
and faster on social media because they act as ‘clickbait’.
However, in many countries, the media itself is far less trusted than in previous eras 
(Edelman 2023), and media negativity is not anything new. Many newspapers in the 
eighteenth and nineteenth century, for instance, were far more openly partisan and 
party political than they are today. Neither is fake news or negative campaigning 
novel to the twenty-first century. For instance, French Queen Marie Antoinette did 
not bankrupt the French state through extravagant spending, was not promiscuous 
and never said ‘Let them eat cake’ – these were largely fabrications by revolutionary 
presses to discredit the royal family and broaden public support for their removal.
Growth of consumerist politics
Finally, are ‘we’ the problem? Is political disenchantment a ‘demand-side’ problem 
(stemming from the attitudes and behaviour of the public), rather than the ‘supply￾side’ problem (stemming from the performance of parties, politicians and so on)? 
The argument that ordinary citizens bear much of the blame for the broken state of 
formal politics is rooted in the allegation that consumerist attitudes and instincts, 
already widely evident in society at large, are increasingly being applied to politics. 
It is in the nature of consumerism (see pp. 196–198) that people seek to acquire as 
much as possible, but pay as little as possible in return. Insofar as citizenship is in

POLITICS IN ACTION . . .
ITALY: A VICTORY FOR ANTI-POLITICS?
In March 2018, Italy went to the polls in a general election. 
No political group or party won an outright majority, but 
two rival populist forces emerged triumphant: the right￾wing Lega coalition, with 37 per cent support; and the 
Five Star Movement, with 33 per cent. After months of 
fruitless negotiations, Giuseppe Conte, an independent 
law professor with no political experience, was appointed 
as prime minister as a compromise candidate to lead a 
government coalition of Lega and the Five Star Movement. 
With a cabinet almost entirely composed of populist 
ministers, it was described by some as the first truly 
populist government in Western Europe. Lega is a far-right 
party whose most prominent policy is robust opposition to 
immigration. Its insistence, during the election campaign, 
that the estimated 500,000 undocumented migrants in 
Italy must be deported ‘as a priority’ attracted criticism for 
threatening to take Italy down a xenophobic and possibly 
racist path. Five Star, which was founded in 2009 by the 
comedian Beppe Grillo as a vehicle for expressing hostility 
towards the political establishment, straddles the left/right 
divide in blending, for example, support for the free market 
with sympathy for environmentalism.
The rise of populist politics has come amidst public 
exasperation at decades of growing problems in Italy. 
Since the global economic crisis of 2007–8, Italy’s 
economy has largely stalled, with very little positive growth 
in two decades. The Italian population is both shrinking 
and ageing, while unemployment, particularly youth 
unemployment, and poverty, are high by global standards. 
Declining revenues and soaring public debt have forced 
the Italian government to scale back welfare programmes, 
which has increased inequality and been acutely felt by 
vulnerable groups. Italy has also faced a protracted crisis 
over migration and refugees, which spiked in the 2010s 
as hundreds of thousands attempted to cross the seas 
from North Africa every year, placing further strain on 
government services and deeply dividing Italian society. 
Long-standing problems of political corruption only adds 
to public distaste for establishment politics.
Whilst populist movements have raised public attention 
to these issues, and highlighted the failure of mainstream 
parties to find solutions for them, the formation of a series 
of populist governments in Italy since 2018 has thus far 
proved unsatisfying for many of those who hoped for 
a breakthrough. Conte’s self-styled ‘Government of 
Change’ attempted to use government interventionism 
to roll back some neoliberal policies in Italy; however, few 
of these manoeuvres were considered successful and 
economic growth remained sluggish. Despite hard-line 
policies, maritime refugees to Italy in fact rose during 
the Conte years. Attempts to ameliorate poverty and 
inequality through new welfare programmes were largely 
ineffective. And any broader programme of reform was 
greatly interrupted by Covid-19. Conte received initial 
praise for his government’s commitment to some of the 
strongest lockdowns in Europe, but these measures did not 
stop Italy from ultimately reporting some of the highest 
infection numbers in the world. Division over Covid-19 
policies ultimately caused Conte to be deposed and 
replaced by Matteo Draghi.
At the 2022 election the next year, support for both Lega 
and the Five Star Movement collapsed, and the Brothers 
of Italy, led by Giorgia Meloni, emerged as the new largest 
party. A far-right populist, Meloni has proposed even 
more extreme policies, including a naval blockade to stop 
refugees, the eradication of several welfare programmes 
while paying direct cash bonuses to families that have 
children, and has expressed strong opposition to euthanasia, 
same-sex marriage, and non-nuclear families. Meloni’s 
occasional praise for former Italian fascist leader Benito 
Mussolini, and new laws against illegal gatherings have 
raised concerns that Italy’s continued stasis and inability 
to tackle its serious structural problems are reminiscent 
of the conditions which allowed Mussolini to take power in

the 1920s. Others have decried such thinking as needless 
alarmism, as all major populist parties and leaders in Italy, 
including Meloni, have avowed continued support for Italy’s 
democratic institutions and freedoms. Either way, despite 
the rise and success of populist movements in taking 
control of the machinery of Italian democracy, thus far, it 
is not clear the new ‘anti-politics’ is any more successful 
than the establishment politics it sought to dislodge.
the process of being remodelled on consumerist lines, this implies that citizens are 
becoming ever-more demanding of politics and politicians whilst, at the same time, 
being less and less prepared to contribute to the maintenance of the political system 
in which they live. This creates two possibilities. In the first, we become a society of 
politically apathetic ‘free-riders’, who enjoy all the benefits of citizenship (schools, 
roads, free speech, economic progress, public order and so forth) without accepting 
the associated costs, and, especially, without bothering to vote. In the second, we 
become a society of frustrated and angry people, drawn to support leaders or parties 
that promise to disrupt the conventional political process largely because it has failed 
to satisfy the perhaps unreasonable demands we make of it.
A variety of cultural and social developments have contributed, in different ways, to 
forging these possibilities:
 First, we have witnessed a decline of deference. Responding to the expansion 
of educational opportunities and other factors, this has led to the adoption of 
more questioning attitudes towards authority, affecting politics, the family, the 
workplace and society at large.
 Second, linked to burgeoning affluence, there has been a growth, particularly 
among younger people, of ‘postmaterial’ values. By shifting the focus of politics 
away from narrowly economic issues, postmaterialism (see p. 221) has raised 
the profile of ‘quality of life’ issues such as women’s rights, gay liberation and 
environmental protection, which the conventional party system, accustomed to 
traditional left/right thinking, often struggles to accommodate.
 Third, the erosion of levels of social capital (see pp. 220–221) has led to a rise in 
individualism (see p. 197) and a faltering sense of civic and political duty. This has 
been reflected not only in declining voter turnout, but also in falling attendances 
at public, town and school meetings (Putnam 2000).
 Fourth, the spread of liberal social values has generated a backlash among those 
left behind by cultural changes (such as gender equality and the advance of 
multiculturalism (see p. 205)) that they deeply reject. Particularly affecting non￾college-educated white men in Western societies, this has generated hostility 
towards a political system that seems to ignore some of their deepest concerns 
(Norris and Inglehart 2019).
MENDING POLITICS?
If politics is broken, how can it be mended? Can conventional politics be salvaged, or 
is it simply beyond repair? Among the solutions that have been proposed to resolve 
the problem of political disenchantment are the following:
 more democracy
 scaling down politics
Free-rider: A person 
who enjoys collectively 
provided benefits without 
needing to pay associated 
costs, which are 
shouldered by others.
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_20.indd 507 23-07-2024 13:01:40508 POLITICS
 reviving citizenship
 rebuilding equality.
More democracy
Democracy and politics are closely linked, if not overlapping, concepts. For example, 
the idea that politics is, at its heart, a means of resolving conflict by compromise 
and negotiation, is intrinsically related to assumptions about pluralist democracy 
(see p. 110). In a wider sense, democracy, as the vital link between politics and 
people, is the chief source of legitimacy, and therefore the key to political stability. In 
this light, democracy is the antidote to political disengagement and disenchantment. 
And yet, all existing democratic systems are limited or imperfect, either because they 
place constraints of various kinds on popular participation, or because they allow 
some groups privileges and advantages not enjoyed by others. This opens the door to 
the spread of anti-politics. The door can nevertheless be firmly shut by a programme 
of democratic reform that may include any or all of the following:
 placing all political bodies with policy-making responsibilities on an elective basis
 widening the use of referendums and other forms of direct democracy (see p. 248)
 introducing proportional representation (see p. 255)
 shortening electoral terms
 democratizing parties by strengthening the role of grass-roots members or 
supporters
 democratizing the economy by introducing workers’ control self-management.
Nevertheless, democracy may be part of the problem of political disenchantment, 
not, as thought, part of the solution. This may be the case for two reasons. First, 
far from being a guarantee of legitimacy and stability, democracy may be biased in 
favour of conflict and disharmony. This is because democracy sets up an ongoing 
electoral battle between opponents who are encouraged to condemn one another, 
exaggerating their faults and denying their achievements. Democratic politics is 
often, as a result, noisy and unedifying. At the same time, in their desire to win 
the elections, parties are encouraged to promise the electorate more than they 
are able to deliver, thereby ensuring disappointment and frustration and eroding 
trust in politicians generally. Second, democracy is based on the dilemma that rule 
in the public interest (good government) may not be secured by a system based 
on political equality and popular participation. Government by the people may 
therefore make government for the people difficult or impossible. This is because, 
it is alleged, ordinary citizens lack the time, education and specialist knowledge 
to act wisely on their own behalf, a problem that becomes more serious the more 
democratic the political system is. Ironically, then, the solution may be somewhat 
less democracy, insofar as insulation from democratic pressures may create more 
scope for governments to pursue bolder and more effective policies (Jones 2020).
Scaling down politics
It may be no coincidence that the age of anti-politics has coincided with the age of 
internationalization and globalization. As regional trading blocs, international 
organizations, transnational corporations, global markets and the like have become 
more significant, the gap, in terms of physical distance, between decision-makers and 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_20.indd 508 23-07-2024 13:01:40IS POLITICS BROKEN? 509
‘decision-takers’ has grown substantially. Geographical remoteness, in turn, generates 
political remoteness, so creating the impression that people have lost control over the 
forces that shape their lives, and, in the process, weakening the binding character of 
political decisions. Small, then, is beautiful (Schumacher 1973), in the sense that, if 
political power is brought ‘closer’ to the people, the levels of public accountability and 
government responsiveness will both increase. Indeed, perhaps democratic rule is only 
effective when political decisions are made at the lowest possible level (see p. 436).
Such thinking may be reflected in support for any or all of the following: 
 withdrawing from, or abolishing, regional or international bodies that operate on 
the basis of supranationalism (see p. 446)
 ensuring that national law is ‘higher’ than international law
 reconstructing the state on the basis of federalism (see p. 430)
 in unitary states, introducing devolution (see p. 437) or strengthening the power 
of existing devolved bodies
 bolstering the power of local government and ensuring that it enjoys fiscal 
independence.
KEY THINKER
E. F. SCHUMACHER (1911–77)
German-born UK economist and environmental theorist. ‘Fritz’ Schumacher moved to the 
UK in 1930 as an Oxford Rhodes scholar. He went on to gain practical experience in business, 
farming and journalism before re-entering academic life. He was an economic adviser to 
the British Control Commission in Germany (1946–50) and the UK National Coal Board 
(1950–70). His seminal Small is Beautiful: A Study of Economics as if People Mattered (1973) 
championed the cause of human-scale production, and advanced a ‘Buddhist’ economic 
philosophy (economics ‘as if people mattered’) that stresses the importance of morality and 
‘right livelihood’. Schumacher founded the Intermediate Technology Development Group to 
help spread his ideas.

However, political decentralization may come at a high price, and that price may, 
in the long run, erode citizens’ attachment to the political process. This applies in 
particular to economic development, and therefore levels of prosperity. At both the 
national and the transnational level, centralization and economic development go 
hand in hand. In relation to the former, national or central government not only 
possesses greater administrative capacity than local government, but is also capable 
of performing economic functions that are beyond the capacity of local bodies. 
These include managing a single currency, controlling macro-economic policy 
and providing an infrastructure in the form of roads, railways, airports and so on. 
In relation to the latter, the emergence, since the 1980s, of an interlocking, global 
economy has created a powerful impetus to transfer responsibility for at least some 
key aspects of economic policy-making (such as regulating international trade) from 
9781350356801_txt_print_Ch_20.indd 509 23-07-2024 13:01:41510 POLITICS
national governments to regional or international bodies. Transnational problems 
require transnational solutions. In a world of economic interdependence, nation￾states may thus no longer be able to behave as if they are islands.
Reviving citizenship
The growth of consumerist politics and its consequences are often thought to have 
generated a crisis of citizenship; consumerism and citizenship being antithetical 
ideas. A citizen is a member of a political community or state, endowed with a set of 
rights and a set of obligations. As the ‘public’ face of individual existence, citizenship 
lies at the heart of political engagement. People are able to participate in the life of 
their communities to the extent that they possess entitlements and responsibilities. 
These entitlements have classically been taken to include three ‘bundles’ of rights: 
civil rights, political rights and social rights (Marshall 1950). However, each of these 
rights must be balanced against a reciprocal responsibility. For instance, the right to 
hold public office, a key political right, entails a duty, on the part of office-holders, to 
uphold standards in public life. Citizenship, and therefore political engagement, may 
be revived by any or all of the following:
 promoting citizenship education by making it the centrepiece of the school/
college curriculum
 introducing a system of compulsory community service or compulsory military 
service
 making voting compulsory (see p. 251)
 incorporating the principles of equal treatment and equal participation into law
 introducing a bill of rights that is consistent with established international 
frameworks of human rights
 strengthening the awareness of the diverse and pluralistic nature of modern 
societies (sometimes called ‘differentiated’ citizenship).
However, it is far from clear that political engagement will be enhanced by a revival 
of citizenship. This is because a balance between entitlements and responsibilities 
that is acceptable to all members of society may always remain elusive. Citizenship, 
in practice, tends to favour either entitlements or responsibilities, and both bring 
problems in their wake. In modern societies, attempts to bolster citizenship have 
usually focused primarily on strengthening rights and entitlements. This is largely 
because tipping the balance between the individual and the state in favour of the 
former and away from the latter is likely to be electorally more attractive than the 
opposite. Nevertheless, the danger of building a ‘citizenship of rights’ is that it risks 
fostering a culture of entitlement that replicates, albeit behind the guise of citizenship, 
some of the worst features of consumerism. On the other hand, the alternative, a 
‘citizenship of responsibilities’, risks fostering authoritarianism (see p. 139), by 
strengthening the state and the expense of the individual.
Rebuilding equality
One of the main reasons why anti-politics was largely absent during the early post￾1945 period may have been that this was a period of interventionist government, 
in which, as a consequence, the capacity of politics to bring about major economic 
CONCEPT
Citizenship
Citizenship is a 
relationship between 
the individual and the 
state in which the two 
are bound together by 
reciprocal rights and 
duties. Citizens differ 
from subjects and 
aliens in that they are 
full members of their 
political community 
or state by virtue of 
their possession of 
basic rights. Liberals 
advance the principle of 
a ‘citizenship of rights’ 
that stresses private 
entitlement and the 
status of the individual 
as an autonomous actor. 
Communitarians, in 
contrast, advance the 
principle of a ‘citizenship 
of duty’ that highlights 
the role of the state 
as a moral agency and 
the importance of 
community or social 
existence.

and social changes was rarely questioned. In developed societies in particular, the 
use of Keynesian (see pp. 177–178) techniques of economic management and the 
expansion of the welfare state helped to create a ‘long boom’, which saw levels of 
prosperity steadily rise and, perhaps crucially, levels of inequality steadily contract. 
This, nevertheless, changed as the ‘long boom’ petered out in the 1970s, leading to 
the adoption, albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm, of more market-orientated 
economic strategies (see Chapter 7 for a detailed account of economic policy and its 
implications). The general shift in economic policy from the state to the market has 
resulted, since the 1980s, in a clear trend towards growing within-country inequality. 
This, in turn, may have both fostered rising hostility towards economic elites and 
weakened the glue that holds society together. In this light, the problem of political 
disenchantment may be addressed by any or all of the following:
 introducing (or reintroducing) a system of economic planning, possibly linked to 
an expansion of public ownership
 increasing public spending and allowing public borrowing to expand in order to 
‘inject’ growth into the economy
 making the tax system more steeply progressive
 introducing (or reintroducing) tighter controls over the banking and financial 
sectors of the economy
 expanding the welfare state and better funding for both public services and the 
benefits system.
CONCEPT
Equality
Equality is the 
principle of uniform 
apportionment, but does 
not imply sameness. 
The term ‘equality’ has 
differing implications, 
depending on what 
is being apportioned. 
Formal equality means 
the equal distribution 
of legal and political 
rights, and is usually 
based on the assumption 
that human beings are 
‘born’ equal. Equality 
of opportunity means 
that everyone has the 
same starting point, 
or equal life chances, 
but may justify social 
inequality because talent 
and the capacity for 
hard work are unequally 
distributed. Equality 
of outcome refers to 
an equal distribution 
of income, wealth and 
other social goods.

Nevertheless, refashioning economic policy in order to promote equality has also 
attracted criticism. For example, the assumption that inequality should be regarded 
as a problem, in itself, has been challenged on the grounds that many accept that

DEBATING . . .
SHOULD POLITICAL PARTICIPATION BE WIDENED AND DEEPENED 
WHENEVER POSSIBLE?
Although the link between political participation and democratic rule is widely accepted, there is significant debate about 
the desirable level of citizens’ engagement with politics. Why have some seen virtues in low-participation societies, and even 
warned against the dangers of ‘excessive’ political participation? But why, also, have exponents of ‘participatory democracy’ 
viewed participation as a good in itself, and called for political participation to be widened and deepened whenever this is 
possible?
YES NO
Making better citizens. Political participation is often 
defended on educational or developmental grounds. 
Participatory democrats, such as J. S. Mill (see p. 245)
and, more recently, Pateman (1970), argue that the 
great benefit of citizens becoming directly involved in 
making political decisions is that it extends their moral, 
social and political awareness, and even their intellectual 
development. As people participate in the life of their 
community, they not only acquire a better appreciation 
of their own and others’ civic rights and responsibilities; 
they are also encouraged to reflect on often complex 
moral issues and to gain a better understanding of how 
their society works.
Meaningful democracy. A direct link can be made 
between the level of political participation and the 
health of a democratic system. This is based on the 
instrumental argument in favour of participation, which is 
that participation is a means of promoting or defending 
the interests of ordinary citizens. Quite simply, the 
more people participate in politics, the louder their voice 
becomes. A strong participatory culture therefore forces 
politicians to act in line with the public interest. By the 
same token, low levels of participation lead to a ‘hollowed￾out’ democratic system, in which politicians become self￾serving and, increasingly, heedless of public opinion.
Common good before private good. Political 
participation can also be justified on communitarian 
grounds. By participating in making collective decisions 
on behalf of their community, people acquire a stronger 
sense of social belonging, recognizing that there is more 
to life than their own narrow or selfish existence. Such 
arguments can be traced back to Aristotle’s (see p. 4)
assertion that human beings are ‘political animals’, who 
can only live the ‘good life’ as members of a political 
community. In Rousseau’s (see p. 105) view, the direct 
and continuous participation of all citizens in political life 
helps to bind the state to the common good.
Virtues of apathy. High levels of popular participation 
may be a recipe for discord, incivility and the breakdown 
of social order. This is because, as people become more 
involved in politics, they take their loyalties and allegiances 
more seriously and pursue their views with greater passion 
and determination. A high-participation society may, 
therefore, be a society of political zealots. The great 
virtue of apathy and political passivity is, thus, that they 
increase the likelihood that citizens will ‘put up with’ political 
decisions with which they disagree, or which conflict with 
their interests, something that is essential to any stable and 
peaceful political system.
Manageable democracy. Democratic systems may function 
best when political participation extends little beyond 
the act of voting every few years. For theorists such as 
Schumpeter (see p. 249), the essence of democracy is not 
popular participation, but a competition for leadership that 
forces those in power to act broadly in accordance with the 
public interest. Similar thinking is evident in the ‘sleeping 
dogs’ theory of democratic culture, which implies that low 
participation indicates broad satisfaction with government 
(Almond 1989). Thus, as the performance of government 
improves, not least through the promotion of economic 
growth, participation rates are likely to fall.
The right to disengage. Low participation or non￾participation is not a cause for concern because it results 
from choices made by free individuals. Non-voting, for 
instance, may be perfectly rational, as it reflects the fact 
that a single vote is highly unlikely to affect the outcome 
of an election. Infrequent and brief civic engagement, 
what has been called ‘attention deficit democracy’ (Berger 
2011), may occur simply because people calculate that they 
have better things to do with their time and energy than 
engage in politics. While ‘private’ life is seen as vibrant and 
stimulating, ‘public’ activities are deemed to be worthy but 
essentially boring.

unequal rewards are reasonable and just. This applies both when inequality reflects 
unequal talents and an unequal willingness to work hard, and when it promotes a 
culture of aspiration. Some argue, similarly, that the quest for equality is sustained 
not by fairness but by the ‘politics of envy’. However, the most strident objections 
to equality are usually made from the economic perspective. Liberal political 
economists link social equality to economic stagnation. This occurs because social 
‘levelling’ serves to cap aspirations and remove the incentive for enterprise. In this 
view, the sterility and inertia of orthodox communist systems was largely due to 
their high levels of job security, backed up by low income differentials. The poor may 
therefore be better off, in absolute terms, if they live in a relatively unequal, rather 
than a relatively equal, society.
