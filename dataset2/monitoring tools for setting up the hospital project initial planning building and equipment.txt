Preface
Hospital buildings are exceptionally complex compared to other commercial struc￾tures, making them challenging to plan, design, construct, and operate. The satisfac￾tion of patients, staff, and their families is directly linked to the hospital’s design. 
The effectiveness of the hospital is greatly infuenced by meticulous planning, 
design, and construction.
Once the hospital building is in the planning or design stage and ready for imple￾mentation, it is crucial to monitor the project on a daily basis. Inadequate monitor￾ing can lead to diffculties and impracticality in making changes or modifcations to 
the building. Considering the substantial investments involved in hospital projects, 
it is essential to monitor all aspects of the project from the very beginning to 
promptly address any issues.
Effcient monitoring during the implementation phase signifcantly reduces 
errors, ensures timely completion of tasks, and contributes to the overall success of 
the project. Hospital projects encompass a wide range of issues, including planning, 
procurement, construction, staffng, equipment, departmental setup, commission￾ing, and operationalizing services. Monitoring all these issues daily without proper 
tools is humanly challenging, if not impossible.
Therefore, based on my extensive experience in planning, designing, and moni￾toring numerous hospital projects, ranging from small nursing homes to large cor￾porate hospitals, I have developed a comprehensive set of monitoring tools in the 
form of checklists. This book contains 17 chapters that cover almost all the aspects 
of implementing and constructing a hospital project. The chapters address various 
critical issues, such as initial planning, feasibility reports, architectural drawings, 
material procurement, space planning, construction steps, support services setup, 
equipment planning, staff planning, departmental setup, testing, and 
commissioning.
Having spent 30 years in the healthcare industry, I felt compelled to share my 
experiences to facilitate the monitoring of hospital projects. It is important to note 
that these chapters are based solely on the practicality of working conditions as per 
my personal experience. While I have attempted to incorporate the norms of accred￾itation agencies like JCI and NABH, it is advisable for project promoters to consult viii
the applicable norms and regulations of their respective countries or governing bod￾ies. Details provided in these chapters may be accurate for some countries or indi￾viduals, but not necessarily for others, as space and facility requirements vary. Thus, 
you are encouraged to consider the issues that are relevant and benefcial to you, 
while disregarding those that do not apply.
I have tried to write this book in a very easily understandable English language. 
This book may be a great help to Medical Administrators, Architects, Planners, 
Project Managers, and Site Engineers.

Highlights of the Book
The checklists in the form of tables given in the book help in
• Posing the compulsion on the promoters to rethink on his/her decision on setting 
up the hospital/college based on a few self-answering questions.
• Considering the issues to be taken care of while preparing the Detailed Project 
Report (DPR).
• Considering the issues involved in conducting feasibility studies.
• Listing out the architectural drawing to be prepared.
• Calculating the total space required for the hospital or college.
• Considering the issues involved in actual construction inside the building.
• Considering the issues involved in construction outside the building.
• Landscaping and development of the site.
• Considering the issues related to the support services like Electricity, Plumbing, 
MGPS, HVAC, Net Working, CCTV, Fire Services Public Announcement, etc.
• Considering the issues involved during the planning of the medical and non￾medical equipment and procurement of the same.
• Considering the issues involved in the planning and appointment of staff. 
Framing the policies for employees. Formation of various committees.xi
How to Use the Checklists Given in the Book
• This book is basically a checklist to help the promoters and designers with self￾assessment and monitoring the ongoing project on a day-to-day basis.
• This book shall be used by the Promoter, Planner, Designer, Chief Engineer, or 
the Site In-charge.
• The Chief Engineer or the Site In-charges shall judiciously maintain the check￾lists, fll them up daily, make corrections, fx the new targets, review the previous 
day’s work and update the checklist.
• Once you start flling these checklists and using the monitoring tools, a lot of 
your energy will be saved as it will reduce the quantum of rounds. It is not 
humanly possible to remember all the activities all the time, but if it is in a writ￾ten form, just by glancing at it, you will remember the task or activity.
• Chief Engineer or the Site engineer shall summarize the checklist daily and sub￾mit the progress report to the top management.
• Start flling out checklist 1 for your self-assessment about the inception of the 
idea of the hospital. First of all, decide your requirement in terms of facilities, 
departments, and services you wish to start in phase 1. Also, you have to well 
plan future expansion like
– Departments you wish to start
– Number of beds to be provided including the ward-wise breakup of bed
– Equipment to be procured
– Services to be provided
– Land area available
– Building area allowed as per bylaws of the city
– Funds availability in terms of amount and period
– The demand of the area. Please access the services and facilities in demand by 
the community, and the type of diseases generally existing in the community.
• Start flling out this book immediately upon inception of the idea, as the frst 
chapter of the book will help you in assessing what you are planning and what 
you want to have in the proposed hospital.xii
• Please be clear that these checklists are designed for a full-fedged multi-specialty 
hospital setup. All the activities may or may not be related to you. The activities 
that are not related to your setup may please be ignored.
• Initially, the promoter, planner, and designer shall access the ideal time frame 
required for the completion of the entire project.
• This time frame shall then be divided into different phases, like the planning 
phase, designing phase, approval phase, construction phase, equipment installa￾tion phase, manpower requirement phase, testing and commissioning phase, etc.
• The designers shall then access the period required for each phase. Keep in mind 
the phases which can run simultaneously with another phase. Also, the designers 
shall estimate the time required for each construction activity like excavation, 
foundation, column and beam casting, slab casting, brick/block work, plaster, 
electrical and plumbing works, etc.
• It is advised to start flling up the checklists phase-wise. Initially, the checklist of 
construction activities shall be considered.
• Other checklists like Human Resources, Equipment, Licensing, etc. can be taken 
care of in later stages.
• Based on the period required for each activity, start flling up the start date and 
end date of the particular activity.
• You may fnd that some activities can run parallel to each other, whereas some 
activities may be linked to other activities. For example, once the brick/block 
work is over the electrical, plumbing, and MGPS activities can be carried out 
simultaneously. On the other side, plastering of the wall can only be commenced 
when all the electricity and plumbing pipeline are laid down. Hence, plastering 
is a linked activity.
• You are advised to fll up these lists with the lead pencil so that they can be modi￾fed as and when required just by erasing the same.

Introduction
Due to their complexity, planning, designing, and constructing, hospital buildings 
involve a multitude of tasks and activities. Therefore, it is crucial to closely monitor 
the project on a day-to-day basis. Effcient monitoring during the implementation 
stage greatly reduces errors, ensures proper scheduling, and facilitates timely com￾pletion of the project.
Inadequate monitoring can lead to signifcant mistakes or omissions, making it 
diffcult or impractical to make changes or modifcations to the building. Hospital 
projects encompass a wide range of tasks and activities, including planning, pro￾curement, construction, staffng, equipment acquisition, departmental setup, com￾missioning, and testing, all the way to operationalizing the hospital services. To 
facilitate proper monitoring of the project, the use of monitoring tools is necessary.
Therefore, this book provides a series of monitoring tools in the form of check￾lists to assist in the effective management of hospital projects. It is important to note 
that these chapters are based on the practicality of working conditions as per the 
author’s personal experience. While efforts have been made to highlight the norms 
of accreditation agencies such as JCI and NABH, project promoters are advised to 
consult the relevant norms and regulations applicable in their respective countries.
This book can be immensely valuable to medical administrators, architects, plan￾ners, project managers, and site engineers in understanding and scheduling all the 
tasks and activities involved in setting up a hospital project. Written in easily under￾standable English, it can also serve as a valuable resource for students studying 
hospital management, engineering, architecture, hospital promotion, planning, 
and design.

Chapter 1
Initial Planning of the Proposed 
Hospital Project
Typically, when a promoter envisions establishing a hospital, the process of plan￾ning commences immediately. The initial considerations revolve around the ques￾tions of ‘where, why, and when’ the hospital should be established. The answers to 
these questions are contingent upon various factors and the promoter’s personal 
perspective. These factors might include the promoter’s location, work environ￾ment, assumptions about expected patient load, and the presence of other hospitals 
in the area.
However, the question arises as to whether planners should consider factors lack￾ing evidence or documented assessments. To address this, promoters shall pose 
critical questions to themselves, as outlined in the checklists provided in this chapter.
Once these questions are addressed, and the city or location is fnalized, geo￾graphical data is collected, the next step is to conduct and surveys to compile a 
feasibility report. This report is based on surveys in the proposed hospital’s vicinity 
and nearby areas, aiming to assess the hospital’s potential for success in that loca￾tion. To enhance clarity and confdence in the project’s prospects, the report shall be 
substantiated with supporting documents, including evidence of the actual survey, 
analysis, and underlying assumptions.
The subsequent step involves preparing a detailed project report (DPR), a com￾prehensive set of documents illustrating the outcomes and projections in the proj￾ect’s planning and design phases. The DPR consists of projections and plans, 
encompassing fnancial calculations, detailed project scheduling, delineation of 
roles and responsibilities, timeframes for project completion, and resource require￾ments for project execution.
During this planning stage, a project blueprint is prepared on paper, facilitating 
an in-depth study and analysis of the steps required to transform the investment into 
a feasible and proftable venture.
Site selection for the hospital project comes next, with consideration of factors 
such as the land size required for the necessary hospital facilities. While determin￾ing land size, compliance with construction regulations and government guidelines 2
specifc to the region is imperative. This includes factors like maximum land cover￾age, foor area ratio (FAR), building height limits, setback area requirements, and 
more. Site selection also takes into account the land’s location, accessibility, utility 
availability, transportation access, road network, safety, environmental pollution, 
provision for protection from winds, earthquakes, foods, etc.
In the planning phase, promoters must plan and decide on the issues like number 
of beds, clinical and non-clinical departments, the range of services, diagnostic 
facilities, surgical departments, and supporting units like pharmacies, laundry, 
kitchen, mortuary etc. that are intended to be provided in the proposed hospital.
The next steps involve establishing the promoter’s legal identity, whether as a 
trust or a company. Following this, the project’s funding structure, encompassing 
resource acquisition and allocation, is fnalized.
Subsequently, plans are made for hiring a team of consultants and workers, along 
with preliminary considerations for electrical load, water supply, and drainage 
systems.
The checklists provided in this chapter serve as valuable tools to guide promoters 
in making informed decisions during the planning process, ultimately facilitating 
effective planning without major setbacks.
1.1 Purpose of a Hospital
See Table 1.1.
Once a promoter decides to establish a hospital, they should seek clarity by 
addressing several crucial questions to understand the purpose of the hospital proj￾ect and ensure the correctness of their decision.
The frst introspective question that the promoter should ask is, ‘Why did I 
choose to initiate a hospital project?’ There can be multiple motivating factors 
behind this choice. For instance, the promoter might hail from a family of medical 
professionals, possess a genuine passion for healthcare, view the hospital business 
as a proftable investment opportunity, or aspire to engage in social service by pro￾viding healthcare to the ill, potentially offering charitable treatment to the under￾privileged. Diverse promoters may have distinct reasons for embarking on a hospital 
project. Therefore, it is essential to frst respond to this fundamental question before 
proceeding further.
Once this is clarifed, the subsequent question to address is, ‘What is the purpose 
of the hospital?’ Is the promoter aiming to establish a commercial venture to gener￾ate profts, considering the creation of a medical college alongside a teaching hos￾pital, or planning to operate a government hospital in a public-private partnership 
(PPP) model? This question holds signifcance because the hospital’s purpose can 
infuence the project’s design and plans. For example, the architectural design and 
interior aspects of a commercial hospital must meet higher standards compared to

:-
those of other hospital types. The design, layout, and interiors will also vary between 
a charitable hospital and a hospital affliated with a medical college, considering the 
latter’s role as a teaching institution.
Furthermore, the promoter must defne the hospital’s philosophy, making it clear 
whether the institution is primarily proft-oriented or a charitable healthcare pro￾vider, potentially falling under categories like government hospitals, clinics, nursing 
homes, etc.
1.1 Purpose of a Hospital4
Another aspect to consider is hospital management. If the promoter has a medi￾cal background, they may choose to assume management responsibilities them￾selves. However, if the promoter lacks a medical background, they need to decide 
on the hospital’s management approach.
An additional crucial matter is succession planning for the hospital. The pro￾moter should have a clear understanding of who will manage the hospital after their 
death. Is there interest and commitment from their children or heirs to continue the 
hospital project?
If the hospital’s core purpose is charitable, the promoter must determine the 
nature of the charity they intend to provide. Will it be a free-of-charge hospital, 
operate with concessional rates, or offer services alongside free or subsidized bed 
options? The extent of charitable initiatives also needs to be defned, outlining the 
scale and scope of the promoter’s philanthropic intentions.
1.2 Status of the Hospital
See Table 1.2.
The promoter must now determine the legal status of the hospital. Will it be oper￾ated as a privately owned establishment, a partnership frm, a registered charitable 
trust/society, a private/limited company, or another form, such as a hospital under 
the government-owned Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model or one affliated 
with a medical college?
Once the decision on status is made, the process of initiating registration with the 
appropriate governing body will commence. This registration shall culminate in the 
acquisition of a registration number and an accompanying certifcate. The certifcate 
of registration shall include essential details, such as the date of registration, regis￾tration number, the hospital’s name, and the name of the registering authority, all 
bearing the signature and stamp of the respective authority.

Acquire and complete the information about the promoters. In the case of mul￾tiple promoters, the details of each individual involved must be provided.
The required particulars shall include the names of the promoters, their corre￾spondence addresses, residential addresses, contact numbers (both mobile and land￾line), fax numbers, email IDs, any associated website (if applicable), and most 
importantly, the professional background and experience of the promoters.
1.4 Area of Coverage
See Table 1.4.
Upon fnalizing the decision to establish the hospital, surveys must be conducted 
to evaluate the viability of the proposed venture. This process will enable the pro￾moter to confrm the soundness of their decision to establish the hospital.
To begin, the catchment areas, from which patients are anticipated to access the 
hospital’s services, shall be clearly defned. A comprehensive list of these catch￾ment areas, including cities, villages, and towns, shall be compiled, alongside key 
demographic details such as population, distance from the hospital, per capita 
income, primary occupations, prevalent diseases, and the relevant jurisdiction of the 
local police station. This data will be invaluable for the future marketing team once 
the hospital is operational.
Additionally, a comprehensive record of other hospitals within the specifed 
catchment area shall be compiled. The assessment shall encompass various criteria, 
including the size of these hospitals, available facilities, bed capacity, number of 
medical practitioners, specialists, and super-specialists, hospital charges, patient 
volume, local perceptions of the hospital’s reputation, and public satisfaction levels.
1.4 Area of Coverage6

What will be the expected area of coverage, the residents of which may avail of the 
services of the proposed hospital?
:-
How many will be cities or villages in which the hospital will provide services? :-
What is the approximate population in the coverage area, that is expected to avail of 
the services of the proposed hospital?
:-
Details of the other hospitals in the coverage area and vicinity along with the details 
like bed strength of these hospitals and full details of services being provided by 
them.
:-
Details of small hospitals, nursing homes, and individual practitioners in the 
coverage area and vicinity.
:-
Likewise, an evaluation of nursing homes and clinics within the designated 
catchment area is imperative. This assessment shall incorporate factors such as the 
size of these nursing homes or clinics, available facilities, bed capacity, specialized 
services offered, charges, patient traffc, and the reputation of these nursing homes.
This thorough survey will assist the promoters in estimating the expected patient 
infow for the proposed hospital. Moreover, it will enable them to anticipate poten￾tial competition and challenges that may arise once the hospital becomes operational.

Once the promoter has made the defnitive decision to undertake the hospital 
project, acquiring the geographical particulars of the potential hospital site becomes 
essential. These particulars shall be gathered for all the identifed pieces of land 
until the fnal selection is made.
These particulars will serve as the basis for the promoter’s ultimate choice of 
land, and the following details shall be collected:
1. The precise location of the land and its longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates, 
along with the directional orientation based on a compass.
2. The road on which the plot is situated, including the road’s width and the 
approach roads leading from the main thoroughfare.
3. Distances from key locations such as the railway station, bus terminal, airport, 
and taxi stand. Closer proximity to these points will facilitate easier access for 
patients to the proposed hospital.
4. Evaluate the availability and effciency of local transportation options for reach￾ing the proposed hospital. A robust public transport network will enhance public 
accessibility to the hospital.
5. Determine the jurisdiction of the local police station for the proposed site.

1.6 Demographic Details
See Table 1.6.
The time has come to gather the demographic data concerning the population 
residing within the catchment area of the proposed hospital. The following aspects 
need to be addressed during the collection of this demographic data.
Firstly, concerning population statistics, data shall be compiled regarding the 
total population in the area, including the count of males, females, children, and the 
specifc religions to which they are affliated.
Evaluate the primary occupations of the local populace within the catchment 
area, such as those engaged in agriculture, service-oriented roles, manufacturing 
industries, or trading activities.
1.6 Demographic Details8
Examine the per capita income of the community within the region, along with 
an assessment of their paying capacity and living standards. A higher per capita 
income and greater fnancial capacity indicate a likelihood of better affordability for 
the healthcare services provided by the hospital.
Identify the major industries present in the vicinity and their quantity. A higher 
concentration of industries suggests a potential increase in the patient base that may 
utilize the services offered by the proposed hospital.
Evaluate the number of employees and their family members residing in the 
catchment area. The more the number of such employees, the more will be the foot￾fall of patients in the hospital because these employees generally need not pay out 
of their pocket for hospital treatment. It is usually paid by the concerned state or 
central government.
Conduct an analysis of the prevalent types of diseases within the catchment area 
and ascertain the available options for managing these illnesses. Determine whether 
healthcare centres catering to these specifc diseases are accessible within the 
region, or if patients need to travel a considerable distance for treatment. This analy￾sis will aid the promoter in planning the range of services required to be offered by 
the proposed hospital.
Collect data about the literacy rate and unemployment rate prevalent in the tar￾geted catchment area. A higher literacy rate and lower unemployment rate are indic￾ative of enhanced health awareness among the local populace, resulting in an 
increased number of patients utilizing the hospital’s services.
Gather information on the number of individuals in the area who possess knowl￾edge about health insurance schemes. Greater awareness of health insurance implies 
a higher likelihood of patients seeking the hospital’s facilities, as these individuals 
typically do not bear the expenses for hospital treatments directly, with such costs 
generally covered by insurance companies.
Assess the potential to attract international patients by facilitating medical tour￾ism through the provision of relevant facilities.
1.7 Other Hospitals’ Details
See Table 1.7.
Given that other hospitals in the catchment area will serve as the main competi￾tors of the proposed hospital, it is imperative to conduct a thorough listing and 
assessment of these competing healthcare facilities. A comprehensive list must be 
prepared for these hospitals, categorized based on their respective bed capacities, 
which will aid in determining the scale of the hospital as either large, medium, or 
small. During the compilation of this detailed list, several crucial factors necessitate 
evaluation, including the hospital’s name, philosophy of the hospital (whether chari￾table, commercial, or government-operated), its size, distance from the proposed 
hospital, available facilities and services, number of patient beds, attending

Similarly, an exhaustive listing shall be conducted for nursing homes within the 
designated catchment area. This listing shall encompass pertinent details, such as 
the nursing home’s name, distance from the proposed hospital, size, available ame￾nities, bed count, specialized services offered, charges, patient volume, and local 
reputation.
Furthermore, a comprehensive directory of clinics and practitioners operating 
within the catchment area is necessary. This listing will serve as a resource for 
approaching skilled practitioners for potential collaboration with the proposed hos￾pital. The directory shall incorporate essential information, including the physi￾cian’s name, area of expertise, clinic name, distance from the proposed hospital, 
patient traffc, local reputation, and any arrangements made by the practitioner for 
admitting and operating on their patients. Special attention shall be dedicated to 
identifying super-specialists practising in the area.
Throughout this assessment, the surveyor must bear in mind that the proposed 
hospital will also require physicians, specialists, super-specialists, technicians, and 
nurses upon its operational launch. Therefore, when conducting the survey and 
compiling lists of physicians, specialists, and super-specialists within the area, the 
surveyor shall prominently highlight potential candidates who could be recruited as 
part of the proposed hospital’s medical team.
1.7 Other Hospitals’ Details10
1.8 Planned Services of the Hospital
See Table 1.8.
After completing all necessary surveys, conducting thorough data analysis, and 
making the fnal decision to proceed with the planning phase of the proposed hospi￾tal project, the subsequent critical stage involves planning the following aspects:
1. Determining the speciality and super-specialties departments to be incorporated.
2. Identifying the diagnostic services that will be offered.
3. Estimating the number of beds required for each category of wards.
The initial consideration revolves around the size of the hospital. Choices include 
establishing a small hospital with a capacity of no more than 50 beds, a medium￾sized hospital accommodating up to 100 beds, a large hospital with a bed count not 
exceeding 300, or an extensive hospital with more than 300 beds. This decision is 
necessary because the departments, services, and spaces in the hospital shall depend 
on the size of the hospital.
Why do the spaces depend on the size of the hospital and the number of beds in 
the hospital? This is because the area required for the hospital services is in propor￾tionate ratio with the number of beds. As per international standards, per bed usually 
requires up to 600 sq. ft. (all spaces put together) space in the building. Therefore, 
bed strength is an important decision to be taken before starting planning.
In addition to the bed count, prudent budgeting is of equal signifcance. Hence, a 
preliminary budget must be established well in advance. Given that all operations 
hinge on fnancial resources, the promoter must operate within the predefned proj￾ect budget. While the promoter may harbour ambitious plans and visions, adherence 
to the allocated budgetary constraints is imperative.
Subsequently, the decision-making process shall encompass the identifcation of 
the specifc speciality and super-speciality departments to be included. Both the 
promoter and the planners must decide on the particular specializations that the 
hospital will offer. The speciality departments may include:
• Anaesthesiology
• Dentistry
• Dermatology
• ENT
• General surgery
• Gynae and obs.
• Internal medicine
• Ophthalmology
• Orthopaedic
• Paediatric
• Physiotherapy
• Psychiatry
• Any other (Pl. specify)

1 Initial Planning of the Proposed Hospital Project17
Similarly, the promoters need to decide the services of which super-speciality 
departments have to be provided in the hospital. The following can be the super￾speciality departments:
• Burns and plastic surgery
• Cardio-thoracic surgery
• Cardiology
• Dental surgery
• Diabetes and endocrinology
• Gastro medicine
• Gastro surgery
• Multi-organ transplant
• Neo natology
• Nephrology
• Neuro surgery
• Neurology
• Oncology medicine
• Oncology surgery
• Paediatric surgery
• Pulmonology
• Radiation oncology
• Renal transplant
• Rheumatology
• Transfusion medicine
• Urology
• Any other (Pl. specify)
The subsequent consideration pertains to the Outpatient Department (OPD). The 
planning team and promoters must proactively determine whether the facility will 
provide services through a free OPD system or exclusively through a paid OPD 
model. Additionally, deliberations are necessary concerning the potential imple￾mentation of an evening OPD. The timing of the OPDs has also to be decided.
The next important decision is about the confguration of the OPD block layout. 
Before outlining the physical arrangement, a choice must be made regarding the 
design approach for the OPD layout. This may involve determining whether the 
OPD block will be structured as a Centralized Outpatient Department, a 
Decentralized Outpatient Department, or whether the OPDs will be situated in a 
Separate Block.
Subsequently, attention turns to the schematic blueprint for the OPD complex. 
Planners must determine whether the OPD complex will be designed as a Single 
Corridor OPD, a Double Corridor OPD, or a Clustered OPD Block, based on 
the overarching layout concept.
The next crucial decision revolves around the provision of Intensive Care Units 
(ICU). Essential considerations include the number of ICUs to be launched initially, 
along with the designated bed capacity for each unit. Furthermore, there is a need to 
establish expansion plans for the ICUs, including provisions for adding more ICUs 
1.8 Planned Services of the Hospital18
or increasing the bed capacity within each existing ICU. Both the promoters and 
planners must specify which ICUs will be initiated immediately and which ones are 
planned for future development. Potential types of ICUs might be:
• Cardiac ICU
• Medical ICU
• Surgical ICU
• Neo-Natal ICU
• Paediatric ICU
• Respiratory ICU
• CTVS ICU
• Neuro ICU
• Neuro surgical ICU
• Burn ICU
• Gynae ICU
• If any other (Pl. specify)
Another important consideration that necessitates careful consideration is the 
establishment of diagnostic facilities. Initially, it is essential to determine whether 
the hospital intends to incorporate in-house diagnostic facilities encompassing radi￾ology, clinical laboratory services, and other pertinent investigations. If affrmative, 
the subsequent decisions must address the following queries.
Regarding the Clinical Laboratory, in the Pathology Section, careful planning is 
required for establishing subsections such as clinical pathology, histopathology, 
anatomical pathology, molecular pathology, derma pathology, gynaecology pathol￾ogy, hematopathology, forensic pathology, toxicology, neuropathology, cytopathol￾ogy, renal pathology, pulmonary pathology, immunopathology, and oral maxillofacial 
pathology, among others.
Similarly, in the microbiology section, the decision to establish subsections is 
critical, including bacteriology, immunology, virology, mycology, parasitology, 
microbial physiology, microbial cytology, microbial ecology, general store, nema￾tology, cellular microbiology, microbial genetics, microbial systematics, microbial 
taxonomy, systems microbiology, generation microbiology, phylogeny, molecular 
microbiology, and nano microbiology, among others.
Concerning the biochemistry section, planning shall encompass subsections 
such as clinical biochemistry, metabolism, immunology, genetics, enzymology, 
molecular biochemistry, cell biology, and related felds.
Regarding the investigation facilities in the Department of Radio-Diagnosis, it is 
imperative to establish a clear blueprint before the planning phase commences. This 
includes determining the specifc radiological investigations the promoter intends to 
initiate, as well as establishing plans for future expansion or the introduction of 
additional radiological investigations.
Normally radiological investigations are
• CT scan
• MRI
1 Initial Planning of the Proposed Hospital Project19
• X-rays
• Ultrasound
• Mammography
• PET-MRI
• PET-CT
• Spect CT
• Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)
• Densitometry
• Gamma camera
• Cyclotron/radio pharmacy, etc.
In addition to determining the intended modalities of investigations to be incor￾porated within the radiology department, it is crucial to make decisions regarding 
the immediate installation of a specifc number of machines for each modality. 
Furthermore, the promoter must establish a coherent strategy concerning the future 
inclusion of new modalities and the expansion of the existing number of machines 
for each modality.
For other diagnostic facilities to be provided in the proposed hospital, the pro￾moter shall decide on the investigations relating to a particular speciality like
1. Cardiology: Echocardiography, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter analysis, 
Ambulatory Blood Pressure (ABP), Thread Mill Test (TMT), Tilt Table Test, 
Thallium Scan, Nuclear Heart Scan, Dobutamine Stress Test, Cath Lab, etc.
2. Pulmonology: Sleep Lab, Spirometry, Body Box Diffusion, six Min walk Test, 
Seno Test, Bronchoscopy, TBNA, ICTIC enter, DOTS Centre, etc.
3. Neurology: Brain Stimulation Test, Trans Cranial Doppler, EEG Lab, Neuro￾physiotherapy, NVC/EMG and BERA test, Speech and Swallowing Clinic, etc.
4. Nephrology: Dialysis.
5. Urology: Uro dynamics study, Uro fow meter, etc.
6. Gastroenterology: Gastro endoscopy, colonoscopy, etc.
Next in line is the strategic planning for the Emergency Department. A decision 
needs to be taken about the size of the emergency department. The size of the emer￾gency shall depend on the number of emergency cases expected to arrive in the 
emergency department. The initial decision involves establishing the number of 
beds in the triage. The second is whether the trauma shall be provided and if yes, up 
to which level. This means that levels of the emergency and trauma centre need to 
be established.
Moreover, a decision must be made regarding the hospital’s involvement in 
medico-legal cases (MLC). If the hospital plans to accommodate such cases, a pro￾jection of the expected case volume for this department is necessary.
Furthermore, an assessment is vital to ascertain the anticipated types of cases 
likely to be encountered in the emergency department, encompassing scenarios 
such as burn cases, sexual assault, gunshot wounds, stabbings, road traffc acci￾dents, and poisoning cases, among others. This evaluation is required because the 
1.8 Planned Services of the Hospital20
planning and designing of the emergency department may vary depending on the 
type of cases generally received in the department.
Subsequently, advance decisions are essential concerning the provision of an 
observation ward/room within the emergency department. If an observation ward is 
to be included, predetermined considerations shall cover the allocation of beds and 
the required facilities, such as medical gas and power supply, monitoring equip￾ment, and ventilation provisions.
Additionally, decisions must be made regarding the potential performance of 
surgeries within the emergency department. If surgical interventions are envisaged, 
the scale of surgeries shall be specifed, including whether only minor surgeries will 
be conducted or if provisions for major surgeries are necessary. For minor surgeries, 
minor operation theatres suffce, whereas major operation theatres may be required 
for conducting complex procedures within the emergency department.
If separate diagnostic facilities for radio-diagnosis or clinical laboratories are to 
be incorporated within the emergency department, these decisions must be made 
during the planning phase, considering potential spatial requirements for the opera￾tional and equipment aspects of such facilities.
Moving on to the surgical domain, the promoter must pre-determine the specifc 
surgical departments to be included within the proposed hospital, both for the 
immediate phase and as part of future expansion plans. Increased surgical depart￾ments will necessitate additional space requirements. Generally, the surgical depart￾ment is like
• General and bariatric surgery
• Urological
• Cardiac surgery including CABG
• Dental surgeries
• Gynaecological and obstetrical
• Eye
• ENT
• Plastic surgery
• Multi-organ transplant
• Neuro surgery
• Oncology surgery
• Orthopaedic surgery including joint, knee, hip, elbow, and shoulder replacement
• Paediatric surgery
• Paediatric neuro surgery
• Robotic surgeries
• Endoscopic surgeries
• Vascular surgery
• Cosmetic, reconstructive, and micro surgery
• Spinal surgery, etc
Now coming to the indoor patient areas of the proposed hospital. During plan￾ning, it is necessary to plan how many indoor beds are to be provided in the hospital. 
1 Initial Planning of the Proposed Hospital Project21
This plan shall clearly defne the category of indoor beds along with the number of 
beds in each category. Generally, the following are the categories of indoor beds:
• VIP suits
• Deluxe rooms
• Private rooms
• Semi-private rooms
• Isolation bed/rooms/ward
• Male general ward
• Female general ward
• Gynae ward
• Paediatric ward
To elaborate on each bed category, the VIP room or what is commonly referred 
to as the suites represents the most superior indoor area. This space is designated for 
a single patient and includes a room for the patient along with a family room. It is 
equipped with a comprehensive range of facilities such as a patient bed, bedside 
locker, step stool, overbed table, sofa set, chairs, centre table, attendant bed, refrig￾erators, a small pantry, an attached toilet, a dining table and chairs, a cupboard, and 
a television, among others.
Deluxe rooms are an upgraded version of private rooms, offering a single patient 
a room furnished with amenities like a patient bed, bedside locker, step stool, over￾bed table, sofa set, chairs, centre table, attendant bed, refrigerator, an attached toilet, 
and television, among others.
In a private room, a single patient is accommodated and provided with essential 
facilities including a patient bed, bedside locker, step stool, overbed table, chairs, 
attendant bed, refrigerator, an attached toilet, and a television, among other 
essentials.
A semi-private room, also known as a sharing bed, is a space where multiple 
patients share a single room. Typically, it is recommended for two patients to occupy 
one room, but the number can exceed two, up to a maximum of four patients. Each 
patient in this room is provided with specifc amenities such as a patient bed, bed￾side locker, step stool, overbed table, chairs, curtain partitions, attendant bed, televi￾sion, and a cupboard. The attached toilet is shared among the patients.
The isolation bed/room/ward is specifcally designated to house patients with 
communicable diseases, aiming to prevent cross-infection within the hospital. The 
number of beds allocated for such cases depends on the expected infow of patients 
with such conditions. These beds can be either single bedrooms or wards with mul￾tiple beds. However, it is recommended to opt for a single-bed occupancy room 
instead of a multiple-bed ward. These isolation rooms are equipped with necessary 
infection control provisions and are situated in a segregated area of the hospital. 
They are designed to be either negatively or positively pressurized based on specifc 
requirements, furnished with essentials such as a patient bed, bedside locker, step 
stool, overbed table, refrigerator, hand wash facilities, an attached toilet, a cup￾board, and television, among others.
1.8 Planned Services of the Hospital22
General wards, often referred to as economy wards due to their lower bed 
charges, accommodate more than two beds, with the capacity reaching up to 30 
beds in a single ward. It is advisable not to exceed 30 beds to ensure the provision 
of adequate and quality patient care. However, there are no such fxed norms or 
regulations on the number of beds to be accommodated in the ward. The number of 
beds in the ward is subject to the discretion of the promoters and planners. These 
wards can be classifed based on departments (medicine ward, surgery ward, paedi￾atric ward, gynaecology ward) or based on gender (male general ward, female gen￾eral ward). Facilities within the ward include patient beds, bedside lockers, overbed 
tables, curtain partitions, attendant chairs/beds, attached toilets, and cupboards.
Additionally, aside from indoor patient beds, there are other types of beds such 
as transit beds or recovery beds used after medical procedures or surgeries. Transit 
beds can be found in areas like triage and observation wards, post-operative units 
for short-term patient recovery, or patients undergoing procedures such as dialysis 
or endoscopy.
Decisions need to be made regarding the provision of ambulances, specifying the 
type (ACLS, BLS, etc.), and determining the number of ambulances required, 
ensuring appropriate parking space and facilities for drivers. Depending on the 
number of ambulances, provisions may need to be made for an automobile 
workshop.
In terms of the Pharmacy, it is essential to determine whether separate pharma￾cies for outpatient (OPD) and inpatient (IPD) patients are necessary or if a single 
pharmacy will suffce. Allocation of space for the pharmacy shall be considered 
during the planning phase. In cases where the promoter does not intend to establish 
pharmacies, alternative systems for providing medicines to both OPD and IPD 
patients must be devised.
When considering the inclusion of a library within the hospital, careful planning 
is essential. Determining the size of the library and estimating the number of books 
to be stocked is crucial. Furthermore, if reading areas are to be provided, decisions 
shall be made concerning the number of reading areas and the seating capacity.
The decision is required for setting up the eye bank. Operating eye banks requires 
a license and is governed by acts, rules, and regulations of the country or state. 
Hence, the spaces have to be allotted for eye bank, which shall comply with such 
acts, rules, and regulations of the appropriate authority.
Similarly, a decision that needs to be taken about the blood bank is whether it 
will stock whole blood or blood components and apheresis. Operating blood banks 
requires a license and is governed by acts, rules, and regulations of the country or 
state. Hence, the spaces to be allotted for blood banks shall comply with such acts, 
rules, and regulations of the appropriate authority.
Lastly, the inclusion of alternative medicine facilities such as Homeopathy, 
Ayurveda, Holistic Medicine, Acupuncture, Naturopathy, and Reiki shall be care￾fully considered. If the decision is affrmative, appropriate space allocation must be 
incorporated for these alternative medicine services.

healthcare service rates, and estimated operational costs for the hospital.
A comprehensive analysis of the region, considering the presence of other medi￾cal facilities, clinics, prevalent disease patterns, and the prevailing pricing struc￾tures, is undertaken either by the hospital’s personnel or by engaging a specialized 
agency for this purpose.
Has the comprehensive feasibility report been developed and compiled? If so, 
has it been formally presented to the management for careful assessment and 
evaluation?
Furthermore, has the compilation of contract drawings, which constitutes an 
integral component of the DPR, been fnalized and subsequently presented to the 
management for necessary approval and review?
The management must conduct a pragmatic assessment of the project, particu￾larly concerning the prospects of success in the designated area. This assessment 
shall encompass a thorough consideration of the local dynamics, existing infrastruc￾ture, and the potential impact of the project on the community.
Has the risk mitigation report been meticulously formulated and structured? This 
report shall be prepared conscientiously, to comprehensively understand the poten￾tial risks associated with the project, analyse their underlying causes, and devise 
effective solutions to counter and manage the anticipated risks effectively.
1.10 Budget and Source of Funds
See Table 1.10.
After the promoter and planners have determined the services and amenities to 
be offered at the hospital, created the Detailed Project Report (DPR), and confrmed 
the project’s feasibility, the next phase involves contemplating the means of 
fnancing.
The initial step involves estimating the approximate capital investment necessary 
for establishing the hospital project. When calculating the capital expenditure, the 
following expenses are to be incorporated in the projected outlay:
1. Cost of land
2. Building part
(i) Cost of structure
(ii) RCC bunkers (if radiotherapy has to be provided)
(iii) Civil construction
(iv) Site development and external works
(v) Electrifcation works including fttings

With the estimated funding requirements for the envisioned hospital project in 
place, the focus now shifts to strategizing the acquisition of funds. It is crucial to 
always bear in mind that insuffcient funds can potentially jeopardize the project. 
Insuffcient funds can lead to project stalling, causing delays, cost escalations due to 
infation, loss of potential earnings due to delayed operation, and increased interest 
burdens on the already disbursed amounts, thereby infating the overall project 
expenses.
There can be various sources from where the funds can be arranged.
1. Self-Financing: If the promoter intends to solely fnance the project, it is imper￾ative to ensure the availability of necessary funds in advance.
2. Term Loans from Banks or Financial Institutions: If a portion of the funds is 
to be procured from banks, the proposal for fnancing must be submitted on time, 
and arrangements for the margin money shall be made well in advance.
3. Share Capital: In the case of the proposed hospital functioning as a Private 
Limited or Limited company, efforts to raise share capital must be initiated 
on time.
4. Grants: If the proposed hospital is eligible for grants, applications for such 
grants shall be promptly fled.
5. Subsidies: If the proposed hospital is entitled to receive subsidies, proposals for 
securing such subsidies shall be promptly set in motion.
6. Donations: If the promoter seeks monetary or in-kind donations for the hospital 
project, comprehensive plans shall be formulated and potential donors shall be 
approached well in advance to ensure timely contributions.

1.11 Site Details
See Table 1.11.
Given that most decisions have been made and planning is underway, the time 
has come to choose and confrm the site for the proposed hospital. Selecting a suit￾able site for constructing a hospital is a crucial undertaking, involving careful con￾sideration of various factors.
The initial consideration pertains to determining the necessary land size for the 
hospital construction, which depends on the design and local construction 
regulations.
Concerning the design aspect, it is well understood that hospitals typically 
demand substantial space due to the diverse range of services they offer, as com￾pared to any other typical commercial buildings. Therefore, the planner must have 
a clear understanding of the services intended for the hospital, such as inpatient 
department (IPD), intensive care unit (ICU), outpatient department (OPD), diagnos￾tics, interventions, as well as provisions for storage, administrative areas, and wait￾ing rooms.

Once the services are identifed, the next step involves a meticulous assessment 
of the space required for current as well as potential future expansions over a mini￾mum period of 20 years. A comprehensive evaluation of the total covered area 
needed for the hospital building is essential. To calculate the total required area, frst 
of all, the rooms required for these services shall be worked out. Once the room list 
is fnalized, the sizes of the rooms have to be decided. Multiplying the sizes of the 
rooms with the number of rooms, the total area required in the hospital building is 
calculated. To these fgures, the spaces required for future expansion shall be added. 
Depending on the building type and design, to this area, an allowance for circulation 
spaces like corridors, elevators, ramps, and staircases, shall be added which typi￾cally ranges from 30% to 40% of the total area.
Upon establishing the total covered area required for the hospital, another critical 
factor to be considered is the land space necessary to accommodate the calculated 
covered area. This determination relies on the norms, regulations, and guidelines 
stipulated by government agencies or development authorities for constructing 
commercial buildings. Some key considerations include
1.11 Site Details30
1. Total FAR allowed: FAR means the Floor Area Ratio. Different cities may have 
different FAR. Based on the allowed FAR, the area of land shall be calculated.
2. Set Back Area: Generally, norms are prescribed by the authorities defning the 
Set back areas to be kept around the building for all commercial buildings. 
Generally, the set back area has to be left on all four sides of the hospital building.
3. Maximum Permissible Land Coverage: Authorities also lay down the norms 
of land coverage that are allowed out of the total land area of the site. The land 
coverage may vary from 25% to 50%, depending on the city, town, etc.
4. Maximum Permissible Height of Building: Authorities may also lay down the 
norms of building height that are allowed in the area. There can be various 
factors affecting the maximum height like the zone of the earthquake and aver￾age wind pressure, distance from the airport, etc.
Considering all these rules, regulations, norms, and guidelines as defned by 
the respective Govt. Agency or the Development Authorities, along with the 
covered area as calculated above, the land space required for the hospital 
building is worked out.
Now the promoter knows how much land is required for the proposed hospital.
As a hospital is a special type of building and has to deal with the sick and gen￾eral public, a few factors need to be considered while fnalizing the land:
• Approach to the site: The approach to the hospital site shall be convenient for 
the community and the service vehicles, including frefghting vehicles, etc.
• Location of the Land: The distance from the main road to the location of the 
land shall be considered. The nearer the main road from the land, the easier will 
be the approach to the hospital. The frontage of the land is also an important fac￾tor to be considered. The wider the frontage—the better will be the design of the 
hospital building.
• Availability of Transportation: For easy access to the hospital, a good public 
transport facility shall be available in the area. There can be different modes of 
transport like Local Trains, Local buses, Taxis, and Auto and Manual rick￾shaws, etc.
• Security: The area around the hospital shall have suffcient security measures to 
safeguard patients, families, personnel, and the public.
• Availability of Utilities: Facilities with reliable utilities like water, gas, sewer, 
and electricity supply shall be available near the hospital site. The electricity sup￾ply line shall be near the hospital and shall have a dependable and stable voltage 
and frequency. The water supply shall be adequate to cater to normal usage plus 
fre-fghting requirements. The sewerage line shall be very near the hospital 
building.
• Roads Network in the area: There shall be a proper and adequate road network 
for an easy approach to the hospital. The roads shall be wide enough for quick 
and easy traffc movement to and from the hospital.
• Environmental Pollution: The chosen site shall have the least environmental 
pollution.
1 Initial Planning of the Proposed Hospital Project31
• Wind and Earthquake: Before fnalizing the land, the history of the wind pres￾sure and the earthquake in the area shall be assessed.
• Flood Protection: If the planned site is prone to occasional foods, the area to be 
chosen must have adequate measures to handle the food situation.
Once the land selection process is complete, the next step involves initiating the 
groundwork for soil analysis, providing crucial insights to architects and structural 
engineers for designing a secure building structure.
The primary task involves conducting a land survey. During this phase, the sur￾veyor is tasked with measuring:
1. Precise dimensions and boundaries on all sides of the plot.
2. Angles of the plot.
3. Elevation levels of the land from the main road. Assessing the land levels at vari￾ous points enables easier land levelling if necessary.
Upon completion of the land survey, the surveyor translates the fndings into 
AutoCAD and forwards the data to the architects for further detailed work, such as 
site plans and layout plans.
Subsequently, soil analysis becomes a critical aspect. This process aims to evalu￾ate the land’s properties and its weight-bearing capacity. The surveyor excavates 
holes at different points on the land to obtain soil samples for laboratory analysis.
If the land flling is required from outside soil, it is always advised to fll up the 
land once the foundations are laid down because it is better if the excavation of the 
land for foundations is done from the raw land instead of flled-up land. This will 
improve the strength of the foundation. Secondly, the retaining wall will be avail￾able to hold the flled-up soil.
1.12 Building Details
See Table 1.12.
The next important issue which requires careful thinking, planning, and decision 
is the building, in terms of quality, facilities, interiors, landscaping, the concept of 
green building, air-conditioning, etc.
The frst decision that is required is the type or class of building. The promoter 
shall answer what he/she is aiming for about the proposed building. The buildings 
can be classifed as follows:
(i) State-of-the-art building
(ii) Super class building
(iii) Medium class building
(iv) Lower medium-class building
(v) Lower class building
(vi) Building in temporary sheds, etc.

1 Initial Planning of the Proposed Hospital Project33
Numerous factors collectively determine the classifcation of a building type and 
category. Some of these considerations include:
Flooring Type: The selection of fooring signifcantly impacts the aesthetics and 
ambience of a building. However, it also substantially infuences the project budget. 
Thus, careful consideration is necessary to determine the most suitable fooring 
material, ranging from options such as Italian marble, granite, ceramic tile, stone, 
mosaic, or basic PCC (Plain Cement Concrete).
False Ceiling: A decision must be made regarding the necessity of a false ceil￾ing. Typically, in hospital buildings, a false ceiling accommodates various service 
pipes and cables, making it a crucial consideration. Moreover, the type of material 
for the false ceiling, such as POP (Plaster of Paris), board or metal grid ceiling, or 
gypsum board ceiling, needs to be determined in advance, along with the corre￾sponding framework for installation.
Doors and Windows: The promoter also needs to choose the type and materials 
for the doors and windows, ranging from options like wooden fush doors, alumin￾ium doors, UPVC (Unplasticized Polyvinyl Chloride) doors, stainless steel doors, 
or simple iron doors.
Interior Design: The interior design signifcantly infuences the building’s 
ambience and comfort, but it also impacts the overall construction cost. Therefore, 
the promoter must decide whether to opt for high-class, medium-class, or standard 
interiors based on the allocated budget.
Landscaping: Similar to the interior design, landscaping choices profoundly 
affect the overall appearance and feel of the building. Consequently, the promoter 
must decide whether to invest in high-class, medium-class, or standard landscaping, 
considering the budget constraints.
Building Elevation: The building’s elevation primarily contributes to its appear￾ance and constitutes a signifcant portion of the overall construction expenses. The 
choices for building elevation include plain cemented elevation, tile or stone eleva￾tion, metal sheet elevation, or glass elevation.
Internal Roads: The decision-making process also involves selecting the type of 
internal roads within the hospital premises, which can be tar coal roads, PCC roads, 
RCC roads, or interlocking tiles, and some may prefer brick or stone roads.
Sizes of the rooms: A hospital is a place where the minimum space required for 
the effective performance of service is essentially required. The designer shall not 
reduce such spaces, otherwise providing services will be diffcult. However, some 
promoters prefer more spacious spaces, some want medium spaces and some com￾promise with reasonable spaces. The decision is required well in advance before 
starting the design of the hospital.
Air Conditioning: Another pivotal decision revolves around the air conditioning 
of the hospital building, including whether to implement air conditioning through￾out the entire building or selectively in specifc areas. Additionally, the choice of 
technology for air conditioning, such as central chilled water systems, VRV 
(Variable Refrigerant Volume) systems, ductable splits, or window air conditioners, 
must be determined accordingly.
1.12 Building Details34
Provisions for Future Expansion: Deliberate planning for future expansion 
spaces is essential, necessitating a forward-thinking approach of approximately 20 
years. Careful consideration is crucial to avoid the risk of either having surplus 
unutilized areas or facing a shortage of space for future expansion. The promoter, 
planner, and designer must collectively determine the percentage of space to reserve 
for potential expansion. Moreover, decisions are required regarding the expansion 
of specifc departments or services that might be necessary in the future.
Medical Gas Pipeline System (MGPS): Decision-making is also imperative 
concerning the centralized supply of medical gases. If a centralized supply is 
deemed necessary, it is advisable to centrally provide all required gases, including 
oxygen, suction, compressed air, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and argon, 
among others.
Information Technology (IT) Network: The designer needs to decide whether 
an IT network shall be integrated into the hospital building. If affrmative, strategic 
planning must outline the locations where computer systems are essential, along￾side early decisions on the placement of switches.
Public Address (PA) System: It falls upon the designer to determine the neces￾sity of a Public Address system within the hospital premises. If deemed necessary, 
meticulous planning is required to decide the locations for speakers and the 
announcement microphone.
Electronic Private Automatic Branch Exchange (EPABX): The inclusion of 
an EPABX system for internal communication warrants a decision from the designer. 
In case of an affrmative decision, the planning stage shall involve the determination 
of locations where intercoms will be necessary, as well as the strategic positioning 
of the primary EPABX control unit.
Cable Television (TV) Network: If a cable TV network is to be integrated 
within the hospital, the locations for television sets must be identifed. Additionally, 
the system for receiving television signals, whether through DTH (Direct-to-Home), 
local cable vendors, or a dedicated dish for the hospital, needs to be decided.
Drinking Water Facilities: If the provision of fltered drinking water is a prior￾ity, the designer shall assess the required drinking water capacity in litres per hour 
and accordingly design a reverse-osmosis (RO) plant. Early decisions must be made 
regarding the placement of drinking water taps and the RO plant.
Extra pipelines: Under the present scenario, it may be diffcult for the designer 
or planner to assess the requirement of electrical pipelines that may be required in 
future. Therefore, it is recommended that a few extra pipelines shall be laid down or 
concealed in the wall that can be used in future for any such purpose.
Lifts and Elevators: The decision shall be taken in advance if the promoters are 
planning for the lifts and elevators or are otherwise will manage with the staircases 
and/or ramps.

1.14 Land Details
See Table 1.14.
As previously mentioned in this chapter regarding site selection, once the site has 
been chosen and fnalized, the subsequent step involves the acquisition and pur￾chase of the land for the proposed hospital.
Before making any advance payments for the land purchase, the promoter must 
conduct a thorough verifcation process to ensure a clear title for the land. This veri￾fcation entails addressing and examining specifc issues such as:
1. Reviewing land records from the registering authority to confrm the land’s title.
2. Acquiring a non-encumbrance certifcate as evidence that the land is free from 
any kind of debt.
3. Ensuring that the land is not pledged as collateral to any bank or fnancial institu￾tion by requesting the original title deeds from the current landowner.
4. Verifying the chain of title deeds of the previous owners of the land.
5. Confrming that the land is devoid of any outstanding taxes, duties, penalties, or 
similar obligations.
6. Ensuring that the land is freely transferable without any associated lock-in period.

Upon the promoter’s satisfaction with the land’s ownership and the absence of 
any liens, the advance payment is to be made to the current owner, followed by the 
signing of a purchase agreement containing the agreed-upon terms and conditions 
by both parties.
If any permissions are necessary from relevant authorities, boards, or the govern￾ment, these shall be obtained well in advance before disbursing the advance or fnal￾izing the purchase agreement.
Once all requirements are fulflled, the title deed for the land purchase shall be 
prepared and registered in the name of the hospital’s ownership entity. Appropriate 
registration fees shall be paid to the designated registering authority as stipulated by 
the state or country’s government. After registration, it is essential to obtain the 
original title deed along with the entire chain of earlier title deeds from the seller.
Certain lands are designated for specifc purposes by state or governmental 
authorities, such as residential, commercial, agricultural, institutional, or industrial 
use. Therefore, the land’s designated use must be suitable for the construction of the 
proposed hospital. If the current land use does not align with the hospital’s intended 
purpose, appropriate measures shall be taken to seek a conversion of the land use 
from the relevant authorities.
1.15 Funding
See Table 1.15.
Now that the land acquisition is complete and the design and drawings are under￾way, the next crucial step is to arrange the necessary funds. Concerning the fnancial 
requirements throughout the construction phase, it is important to note that the

entire sum of funds isn’t immediately necessary. The fund requirements are stag￾gered over the construction period. Despite this phasing, it is imperative to strategi￾cally plan and secure the arrangement and sources of funds to ensure their availability 
as and when needed. Failure to do so could be signifcantly detrimental to the proj￾ect, potentially leading to a complete standstill.
In case the funds are self-fnanced, entire funds for the project shall be separated 
and kept in a separate account, so that they can be utilized as and when required. On 
the other hand, if the funds are to be fnanced by some bank or a fnancial institution, 
the initial step involves submitting the DPR to the bank or fnancial institution along 
with the request letter and forms (as per guidelines of the concerned bank or fnan￾cial institute) for a term loan.
Maintain regular communication with the bank or fnancial institution to monitor 
the status of the term loan approval. Provide any necessary clarifcations, additional 
information, and documents as requested by the bank or fnancial institution 
throughout the process.
Upon approval of the term loan, obtain the sanction letter from the bank or fnan￾cial institution and complete the necessary documentation formalities, ensuring all 
relevant documents are signed. Furnish the bank with the disbursement schedule as 
part of the process.
Following the completion of these formalities, proceed to open a current account 
with the bank designated for the disbursement of the funds.
1.16 Hiring Consultants/Staff

See Table 1.17.
Electrical Load Estimation: Before initiating the application process for elec￾tricity connection from the supply agency, it is imperative to conduct an accurate 
assessment of the power load. This involves calculating the power consumption of 
various components, such as medical equipment, fans, lighting, air-conditioning 
systems, and elevators within the facility.
The outcome of this load calculation aids in designing the requisite electrical 
equipment, including transformers, circuit breakers, bus bars, etc.
The hospital’s overall load is measured in KVA. Based on this, the maximum 
demand is determined, considering an overall diversity factor of 80% and a power 
factor of 0.8 (lagging). To meet this electrical load and assuming 80% transformer 
loading and 97% effciency of transformers, a sub-station shall be designed. To be 
on the safer side, a small spare capacity shall be considered and added to work out 
the total power load that has to be applied.

After accurately determining the actual electricity load required, the sanctioned 
load must be evaluated. Generally, the sanctioned load shall be approximately 25% 
to 50% higher than the calculated actual load to account for potential future increases 
in electricity demand. If not considered, again the process for sanctioning the 
increased load may have to be repeated. However, it is crucial to consider that if 
there are any fxed charges of sanctioned load and those charges are recurring in 
nature, the careful decision has to be taken that there is no recurring liability towards 
the fxed charges of sanctioned load.
Now coming to the connected load. The connected load shall be near the actual 
load. However, some extra load of about 10% to 20%, over and above the actual 
load requirement, shall be approved. Once again, the issue of any fxed charges of 
connected load shall be carefully considered. If any such charges are recurring in 
nature, the decision has to be taken that there is no recurring liability towards the 
fxed charges of the connected load.
Furthermore, it is essential to assess the distance of the main supply line from the 
hospital site and clarify which party will bear the cost of laying the lines from the 
main supply grid to the hospital’s transformer. Whether it will be borne by the ser￾vice provider or the hospital. If it has to be borne by the hospital, the provision shall 
be made in the project cost of the proposed hospital.
1 Initial Planning of the Proposed Hospital Project43
The question of whether the connection will be released from the 440 V line or 
the 11 kV line needs to be addressed, requiring provision for a Vacuum Circuit 
Breaker (VCB) near the meter room if connected to the 11 kV line.
Depending on the hospital’s size, a decision must be made whether to opt for a 
single-phase or three-phase power supply, with the latter being the preferred choice 
in most cases.
The location of the energy meter room shall be strategically determined during 
the site layout planning phase. Typically, it shall be placed at the hospital’s main 
entry gate to facilitate meter reading without the need to enter the main hospital 
building.
Emergency Power Generation System: If the hospital is planning to install 
captive generating sets, the rating of the Diesel Generator (DG) shall be decided 
while planning the load of the hospital. The rating will depend on the areas and the 
machinery which has to be connected to the generating set. Usually, the Air-Cooled 
Silent Diesel Generating sets shall be provided as a secondary source of power to 
meet the power backup for all services. It is always recommended that two or more 
numbers of DG sets shall be installed to make the DG power supply more fexible 
and economical.
The DG sets shall be located as near as possible to the sub-station and shall be 
compatible with the Programmable Logic Control (PLC) system panel.
The DG sets shall preferably be installed on a raised foundation, which shall be 
strong enough to tolerate the load and vibrations of the DG set. The DG set is fxed 
to the foundation with the help of fasteners, and anti-vibration pads shall be installed.
Suffcient provision shall be made for an independent exhaust pipe from each 
DG set and shall be connected to the chimney at 30-m height from the ground to let 
the smoke out into the atmosphere.
Uninterrupted Power Supply System (UPS): Uninterrupted power supply in 
the hospital is generally used to provide power supply to emergency lighting and for 
life-saving equipment. Most importantly, the UPS system is provided in the critical 
units and for sophisticated machines like MRI, CT, and LINAC. The UPS supply is 
also essential in critical units like operation theatres, all intensive care units, proce￾dural rooms, emergency, etc.
Apart from this, a UPS shall also be provided for the hospital server, and IT 
equipment like computers, CCTV, WIFI routers, fre panels, alarms, etc.
The rating and number of UPS shall be designed as per the requirement of the 
hospital which shall be worked out in detail and area-wise or machine-wise. The 
rating shall be worked out preferably, with at least a battery backup of 20–30 min 
with each UPS.
Earthing System: Ground earthing shall be provided to all the HT/LT distribu￾tion systems. This can be achieved by providing local maintenance-free earth sta￾tions and bonding the cables/equipment. Earthing shall also be provided for all the 
light and power points. The type of ground earthing shall be decided during the 
planning stage. The earthing can either be a chemical earthing or earthing using 
charcoal, copper plate, and strip.
1.17 Electrical Works44
Lightning Protection: The planners have to decide on the protection system 
from sky lightning. For this, suitable lightning arrestors, connected to copper strip/
cable shall be provided. A suitably protected zone shall be formed through the mast 
and connected to earthing stations through copper cable/strip.
1.18 Water Supply and Sewerage System
See Table 1.18.
The supply of water is necessary for the survival of human beings and similar is 
the requirement of a proper drainage system. Particularly in the case of hospitals, 
where the treatment of ill and critical patients is carried out, the water supply and 
drainage system have to be excellent and dependable. The importance of clean 
hygiene and good quality water and drainage is critical for any hospital. The quality 
of water that is supplied and the perfection of the drainage system have a great 
impact on issues like infection control, the life of the medical equipment, staff, and 
patients’ hygiene, etc.
The reliability of the water supply system is also an important issue. Thus, it 
shall be ensured that an uninterrupted water supply is available at all times in the 
hospital building. On the other hand, it shall be ensured that the volume of the water 
shall not be more than the required volume and water stagnation in the tanks shall 
be avoided.

Source of Water Supply: The planning about the source of supply of water shall 
be done well in advance. It can be from.
(i) Supply from the Water Network Supplier by connecting to their distribution 
network (maybe Govt. supply or others)
(ii) Deep borehole
(iii) Underground water wells
(iv) Connection to the portable water trucks
1.18 Water Supply and Sewerage System46
If water is sourced from a borehole, the type of pumps to be installed, such as 
submersible or Monoblock pumps, and their appropriate ratings, considering the 
pump head and output, need to be determined.
Has water quality been assessed? If not, a water quality analysis must be con￾ducted during the planning phase. Generally, the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)/
Parts Per Million (PPM) of raw water range from 80 PPM to 2000 PPM, subject to 
variation based on the water source. In cases where the PPM exceeds the permissi￾ble limit, water treatment is necessary to bring TDS/PPM levels to 0–150 PPM.
To ensure a reliable water supply, hospitals are advised to have at least two 
sources of water, providing a backup in case of any supply failure.
The designer shall calculate the anticipated maximum daily water consumption 
as well as the peak fow requirement. Additionally, assessing water pressure is cru￾cial during the design phase.
While designing the water supply system, the designer shall take into consider￾ation the expansion of the hospital that may occur in future. On average at least 25% 
of spare water capacity in the system shall be considered as a buffer for future 
expansion.
Water Storage: The hospital shall have its resources for storage of water equiva￾lent to 3 days of consumption. The storage sources can be the overhead storage tank 
or individual storage tanks provided on the rooftop of the building.
Water Treatment Systems: Given the need to control microbial growth, the 
installation of a water treatment plant must be deliberated during the planning 
phase. Treatment methods may include pasteurization, chemical treatment, chlorine 
water treatment, water softener plants, silver-copper ionization, reverse osmosis 
treatment, ultraviolet treatment, ozone water treatment, or distilled water systems.
Hot Water System: In the hospital, hot water is needed at places like CSSD, 
Hand Wash Basins, Kitchen, Scrub Sinks, Instrument washing area, Patient’s bath￾rooms, and a few Maintenance Areas. Different types of hot water systems are gen￾erally provided in hospitals. It can be like electrical hot water generation, hot water 
generation from boiler/steam by burning fuel, solar hot water generation, or stand￾alone hot water geysers.
Water Drainage System: Hospitals shall have an effective and dependable 
drainage system. This is still more important because the quality of effuent gener￾ated in the hospital is generally infective as compared to the effuent generated in 
any other commercial building. Also, while designing the drainage system, the 
quantity of the effuent generated shall be considered.
Considering the location of the hospital, the availability of a nearby network of 
drainage, main holes and connection points shall be assessed. The ground-level dif￾ferences between the hospital drain and the drainage network shall be assessed. 
Assess the type of effuent that may be discharged from the hospital like chemical, 
radiation grease, etc.
1 Initial Planning of the Proposed Hospital Project47
During the planning of the project, the drainage type shall be assessed. There are 
various types of materials to be drained from the hospitals. These are wastewater 
drainage, soil water drainage, stormwater drainage, chemical drainage, and radia￾tion drainage. All these types shall have supersite drainage systems like govt. sewer￾age system, septic tanks, soak pit, rainwater harvesting pit, etc.
It has to be ensured that the detailed planning and designing of all these drainage 
systems are prepared well in time during the planning and designing phase.

Detailed Project Report (DPR) 
and Techno-Commercial Feasibility Report 
(TCFR)
A detailed project report (DPR) is a bankable set of documents that are prepared 
while planning and designing a project. A DPR shows the tentative results and out￾puts of working based on the assumptions and projections made. It is a document 
containing detailed and elaborate projections and plans for the project, indicating 
the overall calculations, fnancials, roles and responsibilities of the persons involved 
in the project, the project’s detailed programme, time planning for the project and 
details of activities and resources required for completion of the project.
During the planning stage itself, a blueprint is prepared on paper, which is called 
a detailed project report (DPR) cum a techno-commercial feasibility report (TCFR). 
This set of documents provide a detailed analysis and study of what has to be done 
to convert the investment into a feasible and proftable venture. In this set of docu￾ments, top management’s policies and guidelines, their impact on the project span 
and appraisal of fnancial viability are all estimated and dealt with in depth.
A DPR mainly addresses issues like contract drawings, detailed technical feasi￾bility studies, fnancial feasibility calculations, execution of the project from a prac￾tical point of view, staff planning and the time for completion of the project and 
highlights the type and nature of inherited or other foreseeable external risks in the 
project and how they can infuence the outcome of the project. Moreover, a DPR 
should address and provide measures for risk management and risk mitigation.
A DPR is a document that also guides the management of the project’s progress 
and enables comparison of the present circumstances with projections to answer 
questions like
• Can the project be completed in the estimated time?
• Is the actual cost of the project within the reasonable limits of cost escalation?
• After completion, will the project be able to deliver the desired results relating to 
both quality and quantity and can patient satisfaction be achieved at a proft￾able cost.

A DPR should contain general information about the hospital project, the back￾ground and experience of the project promoters in the hospital industry, details of 
ward-wise beds in the hospital, details of the services and departments to be estab￾lished, schedule of the implementation period of the project, the detailed capital 
cost of the project, means and resources of fnances for the project, working capital 
requirements and arrangements thereof, assumed operational expenses, assumed 
rate of hospital services, assumed number of patients and procedures that can be 
performed, revenue-earning projections, revenue expense projections; proft and 
loss statements for the next 8–10 years, cash fow statements for the next 8–10 years 
and fnancial ratios.
A DPR should also contain staff planning, depreciation statements, interest cal￾culation on loans, projected balance sheets for the next 8–10  years, marketing 
arrangement to be made, mode and means of repayment of term loans and cash 
credit loans, government approvals required for the project, consents and statutory 
permissions required for the project from the local authorities and details of collat￾eral security to be offered to fnancial institutions.
A DPR should also provide guidelines for governing all types of contractual 
agreements that are likely to be entered with various agencies; resolution of any 
dispute that may arise in the future and arbitration procedures to be indicated; sup￾ply, erection, installation, commissioning and guarantee/warranty issues; choosing 
vendors and vendor shortlisting and networking.
A DPR should provide an estimate of the phase-wise fund’s requirement for 
capital expenditure, a schedule for ensuring an adequate fow of funds for the timely 
completion of the project, the project phase and a PERT chart depicting the time 
required for completion of a particular activity or the project as a whole.
Once the DPR is prepared, as the fnal onus of the project vests with the owners, 
the owner must have an appropriate mechanism and methods to evaluate the DPR.
This chapter will help promoters prepare both a DPR and a TCFR effectively and 
then deeply evaluate the report before making the fnal decision to approve the proj￾ect. If any amendment is required in the planning, then that can be carried out before 
making the fnal decision.
2.1 Details of Projections
See Table 2.1.
Before preparing a DPR, the frst stage is to solidify the estimations concerning 
the number of patients, income and expenditure, etc. These estimations play an 
important role in the formulation of a DPR. Some of the main topics that require 
estimations are as follows:
The number of patients expected in the outpatient department (OPD) per 
day: OPD patients can be further classifed as those visiting speciality departments 
like medicine, general surgery, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediat￾rics, etc., and those visiting super-speciality departments like neurology,

gastroenterology, urology, nephrology, etc. Furthermore, estimating patients 
department-wise will help gain a clearer picture of the revenue that will be obtained 
when preparing a DPR.
Bed occupancy: This means how many beds will be occupied per day out of the 
total number of beds available at the hospital. This is calculated in percentage. This 
percentage will help in calculating daily bed occupancy in each category of indoor 
wards. Let us understand this with an example.
Suppose that we have the following beds:
General ward 100
Private ward 20
Intensive care unit (ICU) 50
Suppose that the estimated occupancy percentage is 40%.
Then, the daily bed occupancy will be:
2.1 Details of Projections52
General ward 100 × 40% = 40 beds
Private ward 20 × 40% = 8 beds
ICU 50 × 40% = 20 beds
If we multiply this daily bed occupancy by 365 (the total number of days in a 
year), then we will get the bed day occupancy per year. This fgure multiplied by the 
charges of a bed per day will provide the total revenue obtained from beds per year.
Clinical laboratory investigations: As several different tests are conducted at 
the laboratory, it can be diffcult to estimate all of them. The best method is to esti￾mate the number of samples that the laboratory will recieve and the number of tests 
that it will conduct on a daily basis. Multiplying with 365 yields the total number of 
tests conducted per year. Regarding the charges of such tests, an average rate is 
worked out based on the experience, and when the number of tests is multiplied by 
the average charges, the total income obtained from the clinical laboratory can be 
derived.
Radiological investigations: In this context, several investigations are carried 
out modality-wise like X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scanning, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, etc. Hence, the expected number of such 
investigations should also be estimated modality-wise. One need not go into depth 
with a different type of investigation for a particular modality. For example, in the 
case of X-rays, the total number of X-rays can be estimated, but one need not go 
into details as to how many will be for the chest, how many will be for the knee, etc. 
Only the total number of X-rays is suffcient for a DPR. Regarding the charges, it is 
advised to calculate the average charges for all types of tests for a particular modal￾ity. The daily estimated fgure when multiplied by 365 (days) and the average charge 
will provide the income earned from radiology.
Other investigations: Apart from the above, several other investigations are car￾ried out in a hospital, namely, electrocardiogram (ECG ), echocardiogram, electro￾myography (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG), gastroscopy, etc. Depending on 
the facilities to be provided in the hospital, the estimation of all such investigations 
can be worked out, and, when the average rate of such investigations is multiplied 
by 365, we obtain the total income earned from a particular investigation.
Surgeries: Coming to a hospital’s major source of income, that is, surgeries, the 
estimation will be done for the number of major and minor surgeries per day. One 
need not go into the details of each type of surgery. For example, in the department 
of general surgeries, there can be several surgical procedures. We need not go 
through the details of each surgical procedure, and the total surgeries conducted in 
the department of surgery is suffcient. When the number of surgeries conducted 
across all departments is totalled, we obtain the total number of surgeries conducted 
per day. Coming to the charges of surgeries, the average charge of all the surgical 
procedures is worked out. However, one should concentrate more on the charges of 
commonly performed surgeries. When the number of surgeries is multiplied by 
365 (days) and the average charge, we get the total income earned from surgeries.
2 Detailed Project Report (DPR) and Techno-Commercial Feasibility Report (TCFR)53
Miscellaneous charges: Along with surgeries, some hospitals levy operating 
room (OR) charges and OR drug charges. OR charges are levied towards the facili￾ties used in the OR, and OR drugs charges are towards the drugs and consumables 
used in the OR during surgery. Usually, OR charges are a fxed percentage of sur￾gery charges, and OR drug charges are the actual amount spent on drugs and con￾sumables used. Next are anaesthesia charges, which consist of the fees of the 
anaesthetist and anaesthesia reagents and drugs used for anaesthetising the patient. 
Hence, the estimation of revenue from surgeries is worked out simply by multiply￾ing the number of surgeries (as calculated in the above paragraph) and the income 
under both these heads.
The department of emergency: The expected number of patients likely to land 
in the emergency department is worked out. One need not go into the details of each 
ailment of the patient landing in the emergency. Just the total number of patients 
arriving at the emergency department is suffcient. When these numbers are multi￾plied by 365 (days) and the average emergency charge, we get the income earned 
from the emergency department.
Here, we end with the projections and estimations of the number of patients and 
bed occupancy.
Now comes the schedule of charges of the proposed hospital. The schedule of 
charges is a statement depicting the amount that the hospital is intending to charge 
for a service provided and the charges towards investigations, surgeries and proce￾dures. For fnalising the schedule of charges, it is better if similar schedules are 
obtained from two to three other hospitals in the nearby area. These charges can be 
used to calculate the projected income of the hospital for incorporating it into 
the DPR.
Generally, the heads of income for a DPR are as follows:
• Admission charges
• Income from bed charges
• Income from ICUs
• Doctors visit charges
• Income from speciality OPD
• Income from super-specialty OPD
• Income from clinical laboratory
• Income from radiological investigations
• Income from other investigations
• Income from ventilator charges
• Income from dialysis
• Income from the sale of medicines from the pharmacy
• Miscellaneous income from audiometers, oxygen tanks , BioScan, physiother￾apy, incubators, gastroscopy, intubation, catheterisation, bronchoscopy, chemo￾therapy, Holter, pacemakers, vaccinations, ambulance, radiant warmers, 
phototherapy, etc.
• Income from surgeries
• Income from OR charges
2.1 Details of Projections54
• Income from anaesthesia charges
• Income from OR drugs
Another important component of a DPR is projected expenses. These expenses 
can be of varied types. First are fxed expenses, which generally do not vary with the 
number of patients and remain fxed, irrespective of an increase or decrease in the 
number of patients, like salaries, insurance, maintenance contracts, etc.
Second are semi-variable expenses, which may vary up to some extent depend￾ing on the increase or decrease in the number of patients. These can be electricity 
charges, advertisements, laundry expenses, generator running and maintenance, etc.
The third are variable expenses, which strictly vary with an increase or decrease 
in the number of patients. If the number of patients increases, then these expenses 
will increase, and vice versa. Such expenses include the doctor’s share, consumable 
and drug expenses, expenses on ward consumables, etc.
Generally, the following are the expenses that are incurred by a hospital.
Fixed Expenses
• Salary and allowances
• Annual maintenance contract
• Insurance
• Building maintenance
• Provident fund
Semi-Variable Expenses
• Electricity charges
• Advertisements
• Diet charges
• Laundry expenses
• Equipment repair
• Bad debts
• Bank charges
• General expenses
• Printing and stationery
• Postage and telephone
• Travelling
• Vehicle expenses
• Security expenses
• Generator running and maintenance
Variable Expenses
• Doctors’ share on visits, procedures and surgeries
• Consumables like OP drugs, cost of medicines, linen consumables, minor instru￾ments/equipment consumables, other ward consumables
• Other variable expenses like concession and discount, other unplanned 
expenses, etc.
2 Detailed Project Report (DPR) and Techno-Commercial Feasibility Report (TCFR)55
After estimating, collecting and calculating the fgures of various components of 
the DPR, it is time to start preparing the DPR. Please remember that a DPR should 
be prepared for at least 10 years.
First of all, the projected number of patients has to be calculated by increasing or 
decreasing the numbers on a year-to-year basis as expected by the planners and 
promotors. Then, the income has to be calculated for the next 10 years.
Similarly, the expenses for the next 10 years have to be calculated by increasing 
or decreasing the expenses as per the experience of the planner or promoter. This 
increase or decrease has to be based on some facts and backed up by some reasons 
or documents.
Here, we end with the revenue projection that will be incorporated into the DPR.
Now comes the capital expenditure part of the DPR. Capital expenditure is the 
amount to be spent to construct and equip the proposed hospital. This will include 
the cost of the land, building, equipment, instruments, frst-time consumables and 
furniture, backup services like generators, medical gas pipeline system (MGPS), 
computerisation, etc.
The cost of land is the price paid/has to be paid for the purchase of land. If the 
land was purchased earlier, say about 2 years back, its valuation should be done by 
an approved valuer, and this value will be taken into consideration when evaluating 
the capital cost of the project.
Next is the cost of the building. This includes all civil works, electrical works, 
sanitary and plumbing works, landscaping, lifts and elevators, fnishing the building 
including installation of doors and windows, fooring, steel works, painting, fre￾fghting, air conditioning, etc.
Equipment include all the mechanical and electronic medical equipment for all 
the departments.
Then, the cost of items required for backup services like MGPS, generators, 
curtain tracks, water coolers, ambulances and modular operation theatres (Ots), etc. 
should be ascertained.
First-time consumables like ward consumables, cleaning items, printing and sta￾tionery etc. can also be included in the capital cost and the same will be estimated 
for the DPR.
Next comes the cost of furniture. Generally, a hospital requires furniture for its 
patients such as patient beds, bedside lockers, over-bed tables, wheelchairs, stretch￾ers, etc. Similarly, offce furniture like chairs, offce tables, almirahs, flling racks, 
attendant beds, etc. are also required in a hospital. The cost of both types of furni￾ture should be estimated and added to the capital cost in the DPR.
2.2 Other Issues Relating to the DPR
See Table 2.2.
Now that we are ready with all the fgures and the facts, it is time to start prepar￾ing the DPR. The DPR should include the following.

General information about the hospital project: This information will contain 
details such as why this hospital was planned, who the promoters are, which areas 
will the hospital serve, what the facilities of the hospital will be, the mission and 
vision of the hospital, what category of beds will be available and also information 
about any special facility being planned in the proposed hospital.
The background, qualifcations and experiences of all the promoters, particularly 
in the healthcare sector, will be provided in the DPR.
A statement should be prepared containing information about the categories of 
beds available in each ward along with the number of beds.
A statement containing detailed information about the speciality and super￾speciality departments to be set up in the hospital should be provided. Along with 
this, a brief note containing information about the facilities to be provided in each 
department should be provided.
Other details that need to be included in the DPR are as follows:
(i) A management team deputed to manage the proposed project along with their 
designation, qualifcations and experience
(ii) Details of the land like area, location, distance from the main road, approach￾ability, etc.
(iii) Details of the building like the total covered area, zoning, class of construction 
and type of fnishing, etc.
(iv) Details of all the medical and non-medical equipment to be installed
(v) Details of the availability of all the infrastructural facilities like power, water 
supply, sewerage, transport, frefghting, police station, coach station, railway 
station and airport, etc.
(vi) A detailed note on the production, treatment and disposal of effuents, bio￾medical wastes, hazardous wastes, etc.
Manpower cost estimates: Location-wise staff requirement for all the shifts in 
the hospital and the number of staff members that may be required, both designa￾tion- and category-wise, should be calculated. Once this is done, the numbers should 
be multiplied by the average salaries and wages in the area. This will provide the 
total estimated expenditure on salaries and wages.
2.2 Other Issues Relating to the DPR58
Project completion period: The planners and designers should estimate the 
period required for the completion of the project. Timely completion of the project 
is the most crucial factor when setting up a hospital project. If the project is not 
completed on time and gets delayed, then it can have serious effects on the hospital 
and can be detrimental to it. The reason is that due to infation, the cost of the project 
may overrun, interest on the amount invested may increase and there may be loss of 
income for the delayed period. All the factors combined can have a serious fnancial 
impact on the project. Therefore, completion period estimation has to be highly 
accurate, and efforts should be made by all concerned to complete the project 
on time.
For better control of the time schedule, the best method is to prepare a pro￾gramme evaluation and review technique (PERT) chart. This chart is similar to a 
Gantt chart but is structured differently. This chart contains details of all the activi￾ties to be carried out, the period required for each activity and the tree chart for 
connected activities. This chart also defnes the start and end dates of each such 
activity. If the management judiciously sticks to these dates and time frames, then 
there is a very less chance of the project getting delayed.
It should be ensured that all the contract drawings, including the layout plans, are 
ready and signed by the architect, structural engineer and promoters, as the same is 
a part and parcel of the DPR.
Working capital statement: Once the operations of the hospital starts, there will 
be a requirement of funds for day-to-day expenses. Such expenses are called reve￾nue expenses. As far as the funds for setting up a hospital are concerned, the same 
is fnanced as a term loan by the bank or fnancial institutions and cannot be used for 
operating expenses. Therefore, the hospital may require free-fowing funds for its 
operations. This will be either contributed by the promotors or fnanced by the bank 
in the shape of working capital. Hence, based on the projections of surplus/defcit 
and the fund’s fow statement, the requirement of working capital should be assessed 
as this statement will be a part of the DPR.
Proft and loss statement: Once the fgures of income and expenses are ready, 
the statement of proftability after deducting the expenses from the income fgures 
can be drawn. This statement is called either a surplus or defcit statement or the 
proft and loss statement.
For preparing a bankable DPR, the same has to be repeated for 10 years and 
proftability has to be calculated for the next 10 projected years.
Fund fow statement: This is prepared after deducting the expenses from the 
income fgures, adding back the depreciation (because it is an expense without any 
cash outfow) and deducting the instalments paid towards the loans. This statement 
is called a fund fow statement or a cash fow statement. This statement should also 
be prepared for the next 10 years for the DPR.
Depreciation statement for the next 10 years: This statement shows the depre￾ciation of capital assets. The written-down value of the asset and the cost towards 
the addition of assets is the value on which depreciation is calculated. The rate of 
depreciation can be as per the norms prescribed by the taxation authorities from 
time to time. This statement is also required for the next 10 years.
2 Detailed Project Report (DPR) and Techno-Commercial Feasibility Report (TCFR)59
Interest on loans: The interest on all the loans, such as term loans, working capi￾tal loans or personal loans, should be calculated for the next 10 years or till the 
period that the loan amount is outstanding, whichever is earlier.
Balance sheet and the proft and loss account: A proft and loss account con￾sists of incomes and expenditures, and a balance sheet consists of assets and liabili￾ties along with the schedule of current assets and current liabilities. These statements 
also have to be prepared for the next 10 years.
Financial and proftability ratios: Parameters such as like return on investment 
(ROI, average of fxed assets), ROI (average of total assets), return on net worth 
(RONW, average of share capital), debt–service coverage ratio (DSCR), earnings 
per share (EPS) and debt–equity ratio should be calculated. These ratios are required 
by investors, banks and fnancial institutions for assessing the fnancial health of the 
proposed hospital project.
Break-even analysis: This calculation includes the proft–volume ratio (PVR), 
fxed expenses/cost and break-even point (BEP). These ratios are required by inves￾tors, banks and fnancial institutions for assessing the period by which the proposed 
hospital project will be fnancially viable and able to meet its expenses.
Sensitivity analysis: Assume that the projection may not work and either the 
expenses can be more than estimated or the income can be less than estimated. The 
frst sensitive statement is prepared by increasing the expenses by 5% or 10% and 
the second statement by decreasing the income by 5% or 10%. This will help in 
assessing the variations in the fnancial ratios under sensitive conditions.
Payback period: The payback period of the loans from banks, fnancial institu￾tions and personal loans along with the internal rate of return (IRR) should be 
calculated.
The resources and means of fnance as well as the means from where the fnances 
will be arranged for the project from time to time should be mentioned in the DPR.
Sometimes depending on the quantum of the loan and as per the policies of the 
funding agencies, banks may ask for collateral security from the promotors. This 
security is generally the personal property of the promoter. The promotor should 
identify such properties well in time so that they can be given to the funding agen￾cies as collateral security as and when demanded.
Market survey report: This report, made while planning the hospital project (as 
explained in Chap. 1 of this book), will be required to prepare the techno-feasibility 
report and will become a part of the DPR.
A techno-feasibility report: Lastly, the promoter should arrange for preparing a 
techno-feasibility report either using his resources or by hiring an agency to do the 
job. The techno-feasibility report is prepared based on the market survey report and 
the fnancial statements, as prepared above. This report helps in assessing the viabil￾ity of the project in terms of the investment involved and the returns on such an 
investment.

should be prepared separately and attached to this DPR.
5. Organisational details: The details of the organisational hierarchy, staff 
requirement to provide round-the-clock services at the hospital, the appoint￾ment procedure, qualifcations and experience required for appointment, salary 
scales, etc. should be included in the DPR. Details like status, address, capacity, 
services, etc. of the hospital and parent owner should also be included in 
the DPR,
6. Synopsis and project at a glance: This will include the overall synopsis and 
project details at a glance, like the services and facilities to be provided, justif￾cation of the charges levied, etc.
7. Industry analysis: The DPR should consist of the performance of the hospital 
industry compared with other hospitals in and outside the area.
8. Hospital management issues: The DPR should state the details of any issues 
faced by the management like funding problems, decentralisation of powers,

can be faced by the hospital, and attach it to the DPR. Challenges can include 
non-availability of physicians, nursing staff, technicians, etc.; shortage of funds; 
less footfall of patients; higher mortality rate; increased nosocomial infection 
and low patient satisfaction level due to fall in service quality etc.
14. Photographs of hospital equipment and facilities: Photographs of various 
locations of the hospital like wards, OTs, emergency department, intensive care 
units, etc. should be added. A few photographs of the main medical equipment

Chapter 3
Room Requirement and Building Area 
Calculation
After preparation of a DPR, acceptance of the feasibility studies and fnal approval 
of the promoter, the designers and planners will proceed further with the planning 
of building spaces. To plan the building spaces, the initial step is to calculate the 
space/room requirement. Calculation of the spaces and areas as per requirement is 
the foremost task that the designer should undertake. These requirements will be the 
basis on which the designer will begin the work of preparing architectural drawings.
Hospitals are one of the most complex building types and offer a wide range of 
services through their various departments and support services. These services 
include, but are not limited to, diagnostic and therapeutic functions performed in 
operating rooms, emergency, imaging, clinical laboratories, etc. There is also an 
indoor patient area where patients are admitted for treatment, which can be of dif￾ferent types like intensive care units (ICUs), multi-bed wards, single occupancy 
rooms, family suites, etc. This is followed by support services, such as food service, 
housekeeping, laundry, etc. Each of these functionalities of a hospital, including 
complicated electrical, information technology, mechanical and telecommunica￾tions systems, requires specialised expertise in and knowledge of designing. 
Furthermore, given the various rules, regulations, norms, guidelines and codes of 
various regulatory bodies or accreditation agencies, which govern hospital design, 
the designing of hospitals is much more complex.
While designing a hospital building, the design process must incorporate the 
suggestions and inputs from other medical professionals of the hospital, promotors 
and other key persons of the hospital, who have to perform, work and deliver results. 
The designer should also understand the requirements of the patients, physicians, 
visitors, support staff, equipment vendors and other suppliers who may or may not 
have a direct involvement in the design of the hospital building.
What does area requirement mean? The area denotes the space required for a 
particular department, service or functionality. This space is termed ‘carpet area’. 
The carpet area is the actual functional area inside the four walls. Another term used 68
is ‘total area’. If wall spaces and movement spaces like ramps, corridors, lifts, stair￾cases, etc. are added to the carpet area, then the resultant area is called ‘total area’.
This chapter will help designers to work out the room requirement and the area 
required for each room and will also help in knowing the ancillary rooms required 
for each functionality. If this checklist is exported to Excel, then auto calculation of 
the required area can be worked out.
3.1 Factors for Space Planning

3 Room Requirement and Building Area Calculation69
1. Emergency services: An emergency department provides services to patients 
once the OPD timing is over and to those who are critically sick or injured and 
also to trauma cases.
2. Entrance area: This is the area where patients or visitors initially land before 
moving on to any other department or availing any other service of the hospital.
3. OPD services: OPD constitutes outdoor consultation provided to patients who 
may not be critically sick or to follow-up patients.
4. Diagnostic services: This involves different types of diagnostic investigations 
that are performed to support the physicians in the actual diagnosis of the dis￾ease and to further manage and treat the patient. Diagnostic departments include 
imaging and clinical laboratories, and a diagnosis can be established with inves￾tigations like Cath Lab, electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), 
electroencephalogram (EEG), endoscopy, etc.
5. Other treatments: These include support or paramedical treatment depart￾ments like physiotherapy or dialysis.
6. Intensive care services: These are the areas where critical patients are admitted 
for strict monitoring and supervision and suitable treatments are provided.
7. Therapeutic services: These are the areas where surgeries and interventions 
are performed. These include operating rooms, delivery suites, etc. These areas 
also include the pre-operative and post-operative areas.
8. Intermediate care areas: Here, patients are admitted as indoor patients for 
further management and treatment. These can include multi-bed wards, two or 
three beds in each room on a sharing basis, single occupancy private rooms, 
deluxe rooms, suites with family rooms, isolation rooms, etc.
9. Administrative/ancillary services: These are areas where the administration 
staff are accommodated to carry out the administrative functions of the hospital. 
These areas include the directors’ offce, the medical superintendent’s offce, 
the nursing superintendent’s offce, information technology department, per￾sonnel/purchase/ accounts/marketing/transport offces, etc.
10. Hospital services: These include services such as the kitchen, Central 
Sterilization Supply Department (CSSD), stores, laundry, mortuary, etc., which 
provide indirect help in the management and treatment of patients
11. Engineering services: Engineering services come under the support depart￾ment, which keeps the systems of the hospital alive so that all other services and 
departments work smoothly. These services include biomedical engineering, 
mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), fre pro￾tection, medical gases, public health, communication and various other work￾shops, etc.
12. Other services: These include all other services like transport, security, medi￾cal records, housekeeping, conference rooms, library, etc.
3.1 Factors for Space Planning70
3.2 Room/Space Requirement
Once the functional areas are identifed, the next step is to prepare a list of rooms 
that will be required for each function along with the number of rooms and their 
dimensions in length and breadth.
There are several factors and issues based on which the number of rooms required 
shall be worked out. Some standard questions to be asked are as follows:
1. Have the norms and standards of accreditation agencies like 
National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) 
or Joint Commission International (JCI) been followed?
2. What are the estimates and projections regarding the number of patients 
expected to utilise the services of the hospital?
3. What is the estimated number of persons expected to arrive at the entrance lobby?
4. How many service counters like registration, cash, admission and discharge and 
shops are to be provided in the entrance hall?
5. How many and which specialities and super-speciality departments are to be 
made operational initially and in future?
6. What will be the system for conducting an OPD? Will a single OPD chamber 
be allotted to each one of the specialities or will there be a sharing system for 
the OPD chamber based on the available time slot?
7. Are there any departments for which OPDs have to be specifcally designed?
8. What are the diagnostic services and procedures that will be provided in the 
OPD? For example, in ophthalmology, will services like A-scan, B-scan, optical 
coherence tomography (OCT), etc. be provided? Similarly, in cardiology, will 
ECG and echocardiography devices, Holter monitoring, tilt testing, treadmill 
testing (TMT), ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) testing, thallium test, nuclear 
heart scanning, electrophysiology studies, dobutamine stress echocardiography, 
etc. be provided? Such services and procedures have to be listed for all the spe￾cialities and super-specialities, to work out the area and room requirements.
9. Will investigations such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scanning, mag￾netic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, mammography, positron emission 
tomography–CT (PET–CT), PET–MRI, gamma scan, etc. be provided in 
radiology?
10. Which investigations will be carried out in clinical laboratories in-house and 
which will be sent to outside labs? Detailed work has to be carried out for all 
the divisions of the clinical laboratories like pathology (including subdivisions 
like histopathology, cytology, histology, etc.); microbiology (including subdivi￾sions like parasitology, immunology, virology, etc.) and biochemistry.
11. What are the plans for the induction of new investigations in the future 
and when?
12. Will the blood bank be dealing with only whole blood or its components as 
well? What are the plans to provide services for apheresis?
13. Will high-end procedures like angioplasty, transplants, etc. be conducted at the 
hospital?
3 Room Requirement and Building Area Calculation71
14. Will oncological services be provided? If yes, will radiation therapy be 
provided?
15. How many and what types of patients are expected to arrive at the emergency 
department?
16. For surgeries in the emergency department, will the major operating room be 
provided or will a minor OT suffce?
17. Will paramedical treatment facilities like physiotherapy, occupational therapy, 
speech therapy, orthotics, etc. be provided at the hospital?
18. Will the dialysis facility be provided? If yes, how many dialysis machines are 
to be provided?
19. What types of intensive care units have to be provided? These can include the 
medical intensive care unit (MICU), surgical intensive care unit (SICU), respi￾ratory intensive care unit (RICU), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), neuro￾ICU, intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU), gynaecological ICU, paediatric ICU, 
orthopaedic ICU, pulmonary ICU, etc.
20. How many beds are to be provided in each ICU? Apart from this, future expan￾sion plans should be considered for design.
21. Will units like high-dependency units (HDUs) or step-down ICUs be required?
22. How many operating rooms are to be provided? Will there be any dedicated 
operating rooms for specialised surgeries like organ transplants etc.?
23. How many delivery rooms are to be provided? Out of these, how many are to be 
reserved for infectious patients?
24. How many beds are to be provided in each ward and department—e.g. the num￾ber of beds planned for the indoor wards, emergency department, triage, pre￾operative and post-operative rooms, etc.
25. How many single occupancy private rooms, twin- or three-bed rooms on a shar￾ing basis, deluxe rooms and VIP (very important person) suites with family 
rooms are to be provided?
26. What will be the size of the OPD and inpatient department (IPD) pharmacy? 
How many patients are expected to purchase drugs/medicines/consumables/
disposables from the pharmacy? What will be the approximate quantum of 
stock in the pharmacy, and how much area will be required for storage of drugs/
medicines/consumables/disposables?
27. How many administrative staff members are expected to be seated at 
any moment?
28. Will services like kitchen and laundry be outsourced or operative in-house?
29. Will medical gases be supplied centrally or through stand-alone cylinders? 
Similarly, will they be supplied through multiple cylinders or should a liquid 
oxygen plant be installed?
The answers to these types of questions will be obtained while initially working 
out the actual room requirement. However, it is also equally important to keep in 
mind the future expansion plans and provision for the same while calculating 
the areas.
3.2 Room/Space Requirement72
To answer such questions, it is advised that a team of experts be formed, includ￾ing physicians and statisticians, who can share their personal experiences. Details of 
these parameters can also be collected from other such hospitals. The feasibility 
studies conducted earlier can be of great help in answering most of these questions.
Once the answers to such questions are obtained, the actual exercise for working 
out the room requirement can be started. For preparing the list of rooms, the number 
of rooms required for each service or functionality should be worked out.
Another important issue to concentrate on is the requirement of ancillary rooms 
along with the main service room—e.g. the eye OPD may require a refraction room, 
a dark room, a laser room and a procedure room, a surgery OPD may require a 
dressing room, an orthopaedic OPD may require a plaster room, etc. Hence, a 
detailed working of the ancillary rooms has to be done for each service room.
3.3 Room Sizes
Once the list of the required rooms is fnalised, then comes the question: what will 
be the sizes of these rooms? Room sizes frst depend on the practical experience of 
the physicians, second the rules, regulations, norms and codes of the regulating 
authorities/agencies, third the number of patients expected to avail such services 
and, lastly, the actual space available for accommodating such rooms out of the total 
area available.
It is recommended that the rooms be of reasonable size and not too big, resulting 
in the wastage of space, or not too small, which may hamper working in that room.
While deciding on the fnal room sizes, the internal layout plan of the rooms 
should be considered—i.e. how will the bed/couch be placed, how will the equip￾ment/machinery be placed in the room, which furniture will be required in the room, 
the number of persons who will be present at a particular point in time and how 
much working and movement space is required in the room.
Based on the above working and layout, the dimensions (length and breadth) of 
the room can be decided. According to these dimensions, the area of the room can 
be worked out. It is recommended that such a list be prepared using a spreadsheet. 
The frst column will be the room’s name, the second column the number of rooms, 
the third the length, the fourth the breadth, the ffth the area per room and the sixth 
the total area of all such rooms. The block-wise total of this sheet will give the area 
required for each service and functionality.
Once the area of the rooms has been worked out, the area required for movement 
spaces like corridors, lift wells, lift lobbies, staircases, staircase lobbies, ramps, etc. 
should be added. These movement spaces cannot be allocated to any particular ser￾vice or functionality directly but are common to all.
The best way to is to add a percentage area, towards these movement spaces, to 
the room area actually worked out for each service and functionality. Again, the 
question that arises is: what percentage should be added for the movement areas? 
The percentage again depends on the rules, regulations, norms, guidelines and codes 
3 Room Requirement and Building Area Calculation73
of regulating agencies or is otherwise based on the practical experiences of users. 
Normally, it is believed that somewhere between 35% and 40% of the total func￾tional area should be added for the movement areas.
Once the movement areas is added to the room areas, the total area required for 
the building can be obtained and fnalised. It is this sheet on which the designer will 
start the work of placing departments, functionalities and services in the architec￾tural drawings.
3.4 Zoning
Another important factor while designing a hospital building is the zoning of the 
hospital. What is zoning? It is grouping different areas, services or departments of a 
hospital according to functionality and accessibility to patients. The entire building 
of the hospital is divided into different zones. Normally, hospitals have the follow￾ing zones:
1. The outer zone—a fast movement zone: The outer zone will accommodate 
those services and departments that most patients/attendants visit. This zone is 
usually open to all and should be immediately and easily accessible to the public. 
Services and departments like the entrance hall, reception, registration, admis￾sion and discharge counters, emergency services, outpatient departments, cafete￾ria, etc. should be placed in this zone.
2. The second zone—a semi-movement zone: Those services and departments 
that require the physical attendance of areas like radiology, laboratory and phar￾macy should be placed in this zone. Here, the patients are generally not in direct 
contact with the physicians or workers and neither the patients/attendants are 
frequently required to visit this zone.
3. The inner zone—a limited movement zone: This zone mainly accommodates 
the indoor wards. Services such as indoor admission, nursing care and manage￾ment of patients are provided in this zone. This zone should include all the inter￾mediate care areas like multi-bed wards, twin- or three-bed occupancy rooms on 
a sharing basis, single occupancy private rooms, deluxe rooms and VIP suites 
with family rooms, etc. Generally, the patients/attendants and guests of the 
patients are allowed in this zone.
4. The deep zone—a banned zone: This zone accommodates the critical units and 
the operation theatre complex. As these areas have to be highly sterilised and 
free from all types of microorganisms and infections, movement in this zone 
should be strictly banned. This zone should be totally segregated from the other 
public zones like the outer, second and inner zones. This zone includes function￾alities like all operation theatres, ICUs, delivery suites, neonatal ICUs, etc.
5. The isolation zone—a restricted zone: This zone is basically reserved for 
infected patients, who can easily transmit their disease to other patients or 
healthy people. Patients suffering from any infectious diseases like tuberculosis, 
3.4 Zoning74
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), etc. are admitted to this zone. Movements 
in this zone should be restricted and be allowed only after following all the nec￾essary precautions and protocols.
6. The service zone: This zone accommodates other service departments like 
housekeeping, MGPS, dietary, medical records, laundry, workshops, etc., which 
provide support services to the functionality of the hospital.
3.5 Room Requirement and Area Calculation 
of a Hospital Building
In each department, various types of rooms/spaces are required for the effcient 
functioning of the hospital. We have tried to mention all such areas in the table pro￾vided below. Please note that these rooms are generally required but are not limited 
to only these rooms. There can be more rooms other than these. The actual list of 
such rooms/spaces will depend on the requirement of the individual hospital.

Schematic Design and Contract Documents
A schematic design encompasses the complete project design through physical 
drawings on paper. It helps create a plan for a building by considering planning, 
design, and budget aspects. It allows you to visualize the building’s appearance once 
it is fnished.
Before diving into the schematic design of a building, the designer must consider 
how different functions, services, and departments in a hospital relate to one another. 
This involves describing various building systems, such as structural design, civil 
work, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, mechanical systems, frefghting, IT, CCTV, and 
more. Schematic drawings shall also outline rough ideas for the building’s interior 
and exterior fnishes. Additionally, they shall cover engineering considerations for the 
construction and operation of the hospital, specifying spaces, materials, equipment, 
and systems. These designs extend to foor plans, site layouts, and building elevations.
The design process starts with the creation of rough plans and sketches, known 
as schematics. These illustrate the general layout of departments and rooms, the 
fow of people and materials, the positioning of doors and windows, and the overall 
structure of the building.
Another crucial factor is soil analysis. It is essential to assess the site’s soil, con￾sidering load-bearing capacity and soil type, as the hospital’s structure relies signif￾cantly on soil conditions.
Architectural drawings are prepared before actual construction begins. They 
serve as technical representations of the building to be constructed and are typically 
created using software like AutoCAD on a defned scale. Two key types of architec￾tural drawings are the ‘planning drawing’, which conveys the concept, layout 
design, and appearance, and the ‘detailed drawing’, which provides in-depth techni￾cal construction information. The checklist specifes the various drawings that are 
usually prepared in this process.
The next step is to create construction documents. These documents include spe￾cifc information about the overall project and additional conditions. They consist of 
drawings, specifcations, the owner’s unique requests, any changes to the original 130
plans, and other materials that can be helpful for contractors and site engineers dur￾ing the construction process. These documents outline what the contractor and the 
project’s owner are responsible for, detailing the materials, equipment, and systems 
to be used, as well as all the elements necessary for building according to the own￾er’s requirements.
When constructing a hospital, different contractors are usually hired for various 
tasks, such as civil work, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, medical gas pipeline sys￾tems, frefghting, and more. Consequently, each contractor may require their own 
set of construction documents tailored to their specifc role. The checklist provides 
a list of the typical contractors involved in hospital projects.
Construction document: A construction document shall include comprehen￾sive information about the hospital project, the scope of work, the construction 
schedule, general contract conditions, special contract conditions, the construction 
agreement, technical specifcations, a bill of quantities, a cost estimate, a set of 
drawings, and any other necessary documents based on the project’s specifc 
requirements.
4.1 Confrmation of the Building Planning
See Table 4.1.
In the preceding planning chapter, the task assigned to the planner and designer 
was to determine room requirements, room sizes, and the total number of rooms.

Before moving forward, it is crucial to confrm that this assessment has been carried 
out and the data has been recorded in an Excel spreadsheet.
Summing up these room dimensions along with the necessary spaces for ele￾ments like elevators, staircases, restrooms, hallways, and ramps shall yield the over￾all building area for the proposed hospital. It is imperative to verify that this step has 
been completed.
Now, depending on the regulations and guidelines set by the local development 
authority or any relevant governing body, such as land coverage, building height, 
foor area ratio (FAR), and setback area, you can calculate the maximum allowable 
construction area on the plot. Without these calculations, it would be challenging to 
proceed.
Considering the building height permitted by these regulations and fnalizing the 
ceiling height for each foor shall determine the total number of foors that can be 
constructed. Have these calculations been fnalized?
Next, you need to make decisions about the construction of basements. Do you 
intend to build basements, and if so, how many? Keep in mind that constructing 
basements is nearly twice as expensive as building on above-ground foors. 
Basements can also present challenges like water seepage, wastewater manage￾ment, and ventilation.
The subsequent planning task involves zoning for hospital services. Well￾thought-out zoning can signifcantly reduce operational issues within the hospital. It 
is essential to ensure that the zoning plan for the hospital building has been fully 
established before proceeding further.
4.2 Architectural Drawings
See Table 4.2.
Before commencing the actual construction work, it is essential for the project’s 
stakeholders, including promoters, designers, planners, and project engineers, to 
ensure that a complete set of drawings has been prepared and endorsed by the archi￾tect or the individual responsible for creating the drawings.
These sets of drawings shall then undergo a thorough accuracy check and valida￾tion by an impartial third party. Once verifed, they shall receive approval and sig￾natures from the promoters, designers, planners, and project engineers.
All these drawings must be produced in triplicate and shall be on paper of at least 
A0 size. One set of these drawings shall be laminated and kept at the construction 
site, under the responsibility of the project engineer for daily reference. The other 
two copies shall be provided to the promoters and designers.
Once all these drawings are prepared, duplicate sets shall be kept ready for sub￾mission to the appropriate authorities for map approval.

4.2.1 Site Plan
A site plan is an architectural representation, including landscaping, that offers a 
top-down view of a property, encompassing the proposed building. This plan is 
drawn to a specifc scale and displays the layout of structures, landscaping, gardens, 
internal roads, pathways, parking areas, water features, utility locations, vegetation, 
4 Schematic Design and Contract Documents133
terrain, water supply and drainage systems, building footprint, trails, and lighting 
elements, among other elements.
The site plan comes into play once the promoters have given their approval to the 
schematic design. Designers and architects initiate the process by conducting a 
thorough site analysis, which involves measuring land characteristics such as shape, 
size, and slope. The architect also gathers information about the soil, vegetation, 
water features, orientation, and more. This information is then incorporated into the 
architectural drawing, clearly indicating the allowable land coverage area and the 
primary building’s placement.
The remaining area of the site or plot is designated for landscape design, garden￾ing, roadways, parking, and other hospital-related services, as depicted on the draw￾ing. Additionally, outdoor facilities like Transformer Rooms, Generator spaces, 
Bio-Medical Waste storage, STP/ETP Tanks, Liquid Oxygen Plants, Security huts, 
lawns with waiting areas, and other amenities are marked on the site plan.
4.2.2 Concept Drawings
Concept drawings serve as the initial project sketches and do not require intricate 
detailing. They are basic, rough outlines of the building, primarily intended to pro￾vide a general overview of its design.
4.2.3 Floor Plan
The foor plan illustrates the arrangement and positioning of various rooms, ser￾vices, and functions within a specifc area or level of the building. It offers a detailed 
representation of room layouts. These drawings aid in assessing various aspects 
such as the effciency of human and material movement, the adequacy of working 
spaces, the proper placement of support rooms, adherence to infection control mea￾sures, optimal restroom positioning, appropriate service shafts, adequate circulation 
space, accessible fre escape routes, consideration of natural light and cross￾ventilation, correct placement of doors and windows, and the potential for room 
layout adjustments to enhance the overall design.
4.2.4 Cross Section
These drawings provide a vertical perspective on the various elements within a 
building. They display all the building’s foors stacked vertically. These two￾dimensional illustrations are valuable for offering a comprehensive view of both the 
visible and concealed elements, fxtures, and the structure of the building.
4.2 Architectural Drawings134
4.2.5 Elevation
These drawings depict the building’s outer appearance and its external surfaces. 
They encompass details like window placement and the enhancement of exterior 
surfaces using materials like stone, paint, glass, grills, and more. Additionally, these 
drawings provide information about the building’s height and markings for both 
external and internal elements, such as doors and windows, including their visible 
sizes from the outside.
These drawings offer insights into the building’s orientation, helping the designer 
understand its direction, as well as the impact of sunlight and wind relative to the 
building. Even promoters often prefer to view a 3D representation of the elevation 
to envision how the building shall appear from an external perspective.
4.2.6 Landscape
These drawings illustrate the external aesthetics of the building and provide an aer￾ial view of the entire area where the building shall be constructed. They showcase 
how the open spaces on the land shall be enhanced and include designated areas for 
pathways, roads, sidewalks, parking lots, trees, street lighting, parks, pools, gar￾dens, shrubs, hedges, external services, and more.
4.2.7 Finishing Drawing
Finishing drawings contain intricate details regarding the fnishing touches within 
the building spaces. This encompasses specifcations for fooring, false ceilings, 
paint colours, plaster textures, doors, bathroom fxtures, electrical fttings, window 
designs, and other elements. Depending on specifc needs, these drawings can be 
further segmented into separate drawings, each focusing on one or more aspects. 
For instance, a distinct drawing might highlight the type, pattern, design, material, 
and size of doors and windows. Similarly, for electrical fxtures, separate drawings 
can specify their location, type, design, and colour.
4.2.8 Working Plan
Working plans, also known as construction plans, are intended for contractors to 
help them understand the project’s scope of work. These plans assist contractors in 
estimating and sourcing construction materials in accordance with the overall 
design. The legend included in the working drawings provides information about 
4 Schematic Design and Contract Documents135
the various components to guide the contractors. It shall include precise measure￾ments and dimensions for each element, and if necessary, enlarged drawings of 
specifc components shall be included in the fnal working plan.
4.2.9 Section Drawings
These drawings present the complete building structure in a sectional format, essen￾tially slicing the building into layers, which aids in identifying the primary structure 
of the building.
4.2.10 Structural Drawings
Structural drawings are engineering diagrams that focus on the structural elements 
of the building, including columns, beams, foundations, and slab casting. The struc￾tural design is a critical aspect of the building’s overall design because the build￾ing’s strength relies on its structure. Typically, these drawings are created and 
certifed by Structural Engineers. Using the foor plans as a guide, the engineer 
determines the column placements and designs the structure. During the design 
process, the engineer takes into account factors related to earthquakes, wind speed, 
soil analysis, fooding, load of the building itself, and the load inside the building. 
These drawings also provide specifcs regarding reinforcement and the composition 
of the concrete mix to be used.
4.2.11 Column Layout
Column layout drawings specifcally illustrate the design and placement of columns 
within the building. This drawing is one of the components of the Structural 
Drawings. Since the size of columns varies from foor to foor, these plans are cre￾ated on a foor-by-foor basis and specify the precise size and spacing between each 
column in the building, as well as marking the location of each column.
4.2.12 Plinth Beam Layout
Plinth beam layout drawings provide precise details about the positioning and 
dimensions, including length, width, and height, of the plinth beam. These drawings 
also encompass the cross-sectional design of the plinth beams, including specifcs 
like the size of the steel bars and the quantity of bars and rings to be used.
4.2 Architectural Drawings136
4.2.13 Lintel Beam Layout
Lintel beam layout drawings are prepared to depict the details of the Lintel Beams 
which are required to be constructed to support structures created above doors and 
windows to bear the weight above them, as the space below doors and windows is 
typically vacant without brickwork. These drawings indicate the positions, dimen￾sions, design, and quantity of lintel beams required.
4.2.14 Roof Beam and Shuttering Layout
Roof beam and shuttering layout drawings are prepared to depict the shuttering plan 
for casting the foor’s slab and upper beams.
4.2.15 Excavation Drawings
These drawings provide specifc information regarding the excavation necessary to 
initiate building construction. If there’s a basement, the drawing outlines the base￾ment’s details and the required excavation. Additionally, it provides details about 
excavations for the building’s foundations, which may consist of individual footing 
columns or a more extensive raft. These drawings indicate the length, depth, and 
width of the excavation area, as well as information about the extent of excavation, 
excavation methods, soil removal, and disposal. Various excavation techniques like 
trenching, wall shafts, tunnelling, and complete removal are used.
4.2.16 Electrical Drawings
Electrical drawings, typically prepared by an Electrical Engineer, outline the electri￾cal system required to power and operate the hospital building. These drawings 
depict the electrical planning for elements like Transformers, Energy meters, Main 
Panels, Floor Panel Circuit Diagrams, Line layouts, Distribution Boxes, Switch 
Boards, and Earthing. They also specify the location of electrical fttings and fx￾tures. Additionally, the drawings include calculations for capacity, design, and a bill 
of quantity.
4 Schematic Design and Contract Documents137
4.2.17 Plumbing Drawings
Plumbing drawings pertain to the water supply within the building and the disposal 
of wastewater. These drawings illustrate the water supply arrangements, including 
bore wells, government supply line access points, overhead tanks, roof tank layouts, 
in-building supply line layouts, and sanitary fttings. Likewise, for drainage, the 
drawing specifes drain pipelines, main holes, STP/ETP tanks, and connections to 
the main sewerage line. These drawings also showcase rainwater harvesting layouts.
4.2.18 Fire Fighting and Detection Drawings
Firefghting and detection drawings focus on setting up frefghting systems, fre 
detection, and fre escape routes. The frefghting drawings detail the frewater stor￾age tank, pump room, water supply line, yard hydrants, sprinkler line layout, sprin￾kler points, rooftop tank layout for downcomers, and hydrant locations within the 
building. For the fre detection system, the drawings indicate the location of the 
control panel, smoke detectors, hooters, and switches. They also provide escape 
route diagrams in case of a fre, displaying the routes alongside staircases, ramps, 
fre doors, and signage placements. Furthermore, these drawings indicate the loca￾tion of the pressurizing system for lift wells, lift lobbies, and staircases.
4.2.19 Shop Drawings
These are construction design drawings that illustrate the precise installation, ft￾ting, or manufacturing process of an object. They are typically created for services 
such as Air-Conditioning, MGPS, CCTV networks, EPABX networks, IT networks, 
Public Address System networks, and PTS (Pneumatic Tube System). These 
detailed line diagrams depict the machine’s placement and the system’s layout. For 
instance, in the case of MGPS, the drawing outlines the pipeline routes, gas point 
locations, manifold room design, pump room, and more. Similarly, for air condi￾tioning, the drawing showcases the layout of ducts, chilled water pipelines, AHUs, 
plant rooms, and cooling towers. These shop drawings are often prepared by con￾tractors, subcontractors, suppliers, manufacturers, or fabricators. However, they 
must adhere to the original design and specifcations provided by the designer.
4.2 Architectural Drawings138
4.2.20 Furniture Layout Drawings
A hospital’s requirement for furniture varies from room to room including patient 
furniture and offce furniture. Furniture layout drawings are essential for planning 
the placement of furniture within the hospital. These drawings vary according to 
room and space requirements, encompassing both patient furniture (e.g. beds, trol￾leys), and offce furniture (e.g. chairs, tables). The drawings provide a layout for 
each room, indicating the size and dimensions of the furniture.
4.2.21 Furniture Design Drawings
Most often, patient furniture has a fxed size and design, whereas offce furniture is 
tailored according to the needs. Furniture design drawings are especially important 
for customized offce furniture, describing the sizes, designs, materials, and fttings 
needed for manufacturing. These drawings help estimate the furniture’s cost.
4.2.22 Hospital Signage Drawings
Designing and providing signage in the hospital is a typical task which requires 
careful design. Finding signage location and design is even more important. The 
signage location has to be such that it gives an uninterrupted view of the signage to 
the people. This drawing depicts the location of the signage along with its design at 
various locations. The design of the signage may change from one location to 
another. Therefore, the signage drawing is prepared separately for each foor.
4.2.23 As-Built Drawings
At times it happens that during construction, due to some unavoidable circum￾stances or due to changes in the decision, the construction pattern and design may 
have to be changed as compared to what was planned in the working drawing or the 
foor plan. In such cases, As-built drawings are prepared either during the construc￾tion process or after the construction is complete. These drawings are prepared for 
comparison between what has been built versus the original plan to trace out the 
changes that have taken place during construction.
4 Schematic Design and Contract Documents139
4.2.24 PERT Charts
PERT Charts, or Program Evaluation and Review Technique charts, provide a time￾line for project completion. They outline the start and end dates for each activity, 
including dependencies between activities. PERT charts are a vital management 
tool for tracking project progress regularly.
4.2.25 General Note
A general note is not a drawing but contains comprehensive information about by￾laws, legends, construction methods, mapping forms, abbreviations, codes, and 
other necessary details and clarifcations for the construction process.

Civil Construction Works 
of the Hospital Building
Once the fundamental planning and designing phases of the hospital project have 
been completed, along with the preparation of all detailed drawings for execution, 
the construction phase can be initiated. At this stage, the selection of vendors should 
also have been fnalized, signifying that the groundwork for commencing actual 
construction is now set.
Commence the construction procedures. Before initiating the construction, there 
are a series of preliminary activities that must be undertaken. First and foremost, it 
is imperative to obtain approval for the maps and drawings in accordance with the 
governing by-laws of the area or land.
It is essential to hire contractors and provide advance payments for the mobiliza￾tion process, along with issuing instructions for mobilizing the teams. The selection 
of vendors for the supply of construction materials and subsequent procurement at 
the site is crucial. The initial steps involve laying the foundation stone and making 
provisions for necessary construction tools, temporary electricity, and water supply, 
as well as setting up site offces and stores.
The construction process commences with the demarcation of the layout on the 
land, either for basements (if included in the design) or for the foundation, followed 
by excavation work and subsequent foundation laying.
Upon completion of the foundation, the construction of the building commences, 
including the casting of columns and beams. The process of shuttering for slab cast￾ing begins, and once the slab shuttering is removed, brick/block work shall be 
initiated.
In addition to implementing reinforced concrete cement (RCC) works, the con￾struction process typically includes a range of activities such as civil works encom￾passing brick/block work, plastering of walls and ceilings, fxing of door/window 
frames, installation of fooring, doors/windows, and false ceilings, as well as wood, 
aluminium, steel works, and painting works, among others.
Considering the extensive number of activities required on each foor, simultane￾ous execution on the same foor may not be feasible for all tasks. Some activities can 148
run parallel to others, while certain tasks need to follow a sequential order. For 
instance, wall plastering can only be carried out once all the conduits are laid.
To optimize time management, the activities are allocated across different foors. 
For instance, when the ground foor slab is complete, the casting team can proceed 
to the frst foor for column, beam, and slab casting. Simultaneously, brick/block 
work can commence on the ground foor. Similarly, as the casting team moves to the 
third foor, brick/block work can commence on the second foor. Similarly, the work 
for laying conduits can be started on the ground foor, and so forth.
The attached checklist outlines the sequence of such tasks within the proposed 
building, facilitating the site engineer in planning the commencement and comple￾tion dates for each activity and monitoring the current status of each task.
5.1 Pre-Construction Activities
See Table 5.1.
Given that the construction of a multi-story hospital is classifed as a substantial 
undertaking, it necessitates a strong and stable foundation capable of bearing the 
weight of the structure. Additionally, the building must be resilient enough to with￾stand potential hazards such as earthquakes, foods, and lightning. It is crucial to 
conduct a thorough examination, especially if the land is located in flled areas or in 
proximity to water sources such as lakes, canals, rivers, or seas.
Consequently, the initial step involves a comprehensive analysis of the soil 
through soil testing. This process entails the engagement of a government-approved 
agency responsible for collecting various soil samples, which are then sent to a 
laboratory for thorough chemical analysis. The resulting report provides valuable 
insights into the ’s load-bearing capacity, serving as a critical reference point for the 
structural engineer in designing the building’s foundation.
Simultaneously, while awaiting the soil testing report, the land must undergo a 
meticulous survey to ascertain its topographical variations. It is common for the

land levels to differ across the entire plot, necessitating potential landflling in some 
areas. This preparatory step can be completed before the soil testing report is 
obtained.
Upon receiving the soil testing report, the fnal set of structural drawings, along￾side other necessary drafts, shall be meticulously prepared for submission to the 
relevant government authorities for map approval.
During this period, it is advisable to clear the plot and surrounding land area of 
any debris, vegetation, trees, rocks, or wooden stumps that could impede the con￾struction process. Eliminating these obstructions in advance is essential to facilitate 
the excavation process for laying the foundation or basement without any hindrances.
5.2 MAP/Drawing Approvals
See Table 5.2.
In virtually all the countries, there exists an established system governing con￾struction and development activities. Typically, government bodies, or other regula￾tory agencies designated for this purpose, oversee and approve building plans. 
These entities enforce a specifc set of regulations, including permissible Floor Area 
Ratio (FAR), building height, land coverage, and setback requirements. Additionally, 
parking area standards must be adhered to the prescribed by-laws.
Certain countries also maintain regulations pertaining to service standards such 
as electricity, water supply, drainage, lightning protection, and pollution control.

Currently, there is a growing emphasis on the implementation of green building 
principles worldwide.
In accordance with the regulations and standards established by the relevant 
approval authorities in the respective regions, a comprehensive set of drawings and 
essential documentation shall be prepared and submitted for approval of the pro￾posed maps and drawings.
If there are any charges associated with the approval process for the maps and 
drawings, the corresponding fees shall be remitted along with obtaining a receipt.
Should any discrepancies arise in the submitted maps and drawings, the approv￾ing authorities may request revisions. Only upon satisfaction with the compliance of 
the maps and drawings with the prescribed standards, the permission for construc￾tion will be granted.
The approved set of maps and drawings shall formally be endorsed and stamped 
by the approving authorities. A copy shall then be provided to the owner, serving as 
offcial authorization to commence the construction work.
Likewise, if necessary, written authorization from the relevant authorities should 
be obtained before commencing any land excavation to establish foundations or 
basements.
5.3 Engagement of Contractors
See Table 5.3.
With the completion of the detailed drawings and the approval of the project map 
from the pertinent authority, the subsequent phase involves the commencement of 
the construction process.
Naturally, the engagement of contractors is essential for the execution of the 
construction activities. Typically, each specifc task requires the involvement of 
separate contractors. These tasks may include land excavation, civil construction, 
reinforcement steel binding, plumbing and sanitary work, electrical and power 
installation, air conditioning, frefghting, CCTV system installation, information 
technology (computerization), public announcement system setup, modular OT 
(Operation Theatre), medical gas pipeline system installation, door and window ft￾ting, false ceiling installation, painting and polishing, fooring, elevation work, site 
development, staircase railing installation, landscaping, elevators/lifts installation, 
signage placement, curtain track system setup, nurse call system setup, and general 
furniture installation, among others. Although it is customary for each activity to be 
managed by individual contractors, some developers prefer to engage a single con￾tractor for the entire project on a turnkey basis. This primary contractor may subse￾quently appoint sub-contractors for each specifc activity.
The process of selecting contractors initiates with the release of an advertisement 
inviting applications from interested contractors. Subsequently, the contractors shall 
be shortlisted during the pre-bidding qualifcation round, where their capabilities 
shall be assessed through initial interviews, scrutiny of references and previous

works, and an evaluation of their overall reputation. Emphasis shall be placed on 
contractors with adequate resources, including manpower and the necessary tools to 
ensure the timely completion of the project.
Following the shortlisting of contractors, the qualifed ones receive a set of ten￾der documents. The bidding deadline shall typically be fxed, and contractors shall 
be instructed to submit their bids in sealed envelopes under the supervision of an 
authorized representative of the developer.
On the designated date, the sealed envelopes shall be opened in the presence of 
the contractors, and a comparative analysis shall be conducted to determine the low￾est bid. Further discussions shall be held with the shortlisted contractors, during 
which the developers ascertain their work experience, capabilities, previous project 
records, and the availability of essential resources.
Upon satisfaction with these aspects, the fnal terms and conditions of the agree￾ment shall be rediscussed and fnalized. Lastly, the negotiation on the price and 
costs shall be carried out. The terms of payment shall also be agreed upon and docu￾mented while placing the work order.
In preparation for the engagement of contractors, a set of construction docu￾ments shall be created, encompassing general and supplementary conditions, 
5 Civil Construction Works of the Hospital Building153
specifc requirements of the developers, detailed drawings, specifcations, change 
orders, and other documents provided by the designer or consultants. These docu￾ments shall outline the scope, type, and quality of materials, equipment, systems, 
and other elements necessary for the project, to be acknowledged and accepted by 
the developers. Given the need to engage different contractors for various activities, 
a separate set of construction documents shall be prepared for each activity or 
contractor.
For a more comprehensive understanding of the construction documents and 
contract awarding process, please consult Chap. 4 (Contract Documents) of 
this book.
Following the fnalization of the contractors, an advance for mobilization shall 
be disbursed to them, along with instructions to initiate their teams. Additionally, 
the contractors are required to submit material samples for the developer’s evalua￾tion, with these samples being retained for comparison with the actual materials 
used during the construction phase.
5.4 Selection of the Vendors for Materials Supply
See Table 5.4.
During the construction of any building, a variety of materials are essential, 
including but not limited to cement, steel, sand, conduits, hardware, sanitary wares, 
cables, panels, electrical fttings, etc. To ensure the unobstructed progress of the 
project, it is advisable to procure these materials well in advance and adequate 
quantities.
When awarding contracts for the construction and fnishing of a building, three 
scenarios may arise. Firstly, the promoter may supply the materials, and the contrac￾tors are solely responsible for the labour aspect. Secondly, the contract may encom￾pass both the materials and the labour. Lastly, it may involve a combination of both, 
where some tasks involve materials supplied by the promoter, and others solely 
entail labour.
Irrespective of the scenario, timely procurement of materials is imperative.
If the promoter supplies the materials, they need to request the designers and 
architects to prepare a Bill Of Quantity (BOQ) encompassing all the necessary 
items. This comprehensive list, including technical specifcations and make and 
model details of the materials, shall be prepared well in advance.
As soon as the BOQ is ready, an advertisement shall be released for the vendors 
to apply. After receiving the applications, the vendors shall be shortlisted in the pre￾bidding qualifcation round. In this round, the vendors shall be evaluated based on 
the initial interview to judge the capacity of the vendor, checking the reference and 
quality of the earlier supplies, the general reputation of the vendor, etc. During 
shortlisting the vendors, preference shall be given to such vendors, who are either 
the direct manufacturers or otherwise who are the distributors of registered agents

of the manufacturers. This will help the promoter to procure the original material at 
a cheaper price and will rule out the chances of any duplicate material.
Once the vendors are shortlisted, the set of BOQ shall be given to the vendors 
who qualify during the pre-bidding qualifcations. Generally, the last date for bid￾ding shall be fxed, and the vendors are advised to submit the bid on or before the 
last date. The vendors shall submit the bid in a sealed envelope under receipt from 
the authorized person of the promoter.
On the pre-decided date, the envelopes are opened in front of the vendors. The 
comparative sheet shall be prepared to work out the lowest vendor, and rounds of 
discussions shall be carried out with the vendors. Promoters shall satisfy themselves 
with the work experience, the capability of the vendors to supply the material, the 
vendor’s earlier experience, the availability of the required material with the ven￾dor, etc.
5.4 Selection of the Vendors for Materials Supply156
Upon the promoter’s satisfaction with the vendors, the fnal terms and conditions 
of the agreement shall be deliberated and concluded, followed by negotiations on 
pricing and costs. The agreed-upon terms shall be documented in the purchase 
order, including item details, technical specifcations, applicable taxes, warranty 
conditions, payment terms, delivery details, warranty, spare parts availability, after￾sales service, installation, commissioning and testing provisions, annual mainte￾nance contracts, and dispute resolution clauses.
To avoid overstocking or understocking, careful consideration shall be given to 
the delivery time of the materials. Overstocking may lead to material pilferage or 
expiry, while understocking may cause construction delays.
Upon fnalizing the vendors, an advance payment shall be made in accordance 
with the conditions specifed in the purchase order. Additionally, the vendors are 
required to provide samples of the materials outlined in the purchase order, which 
are retained by the promoter for comparison with the actual materials supplied.
In the case of contractors working with materials, the agreement shall clearly 
defne the items, technical specifcations, make, and model. Similar to the vendors, 
the contractors shall also be requested to submit samples of construction materials, 
which shall be retained for comparison with the materials actually used during the 
construction process.
5.5 Starting Preparing for Construction
See Table 5.5.
With the contractors appointed and the material orders issued, the focus now 
shifts to the preparations for initiating the construction work.
To begin with, the ceremonial laying of the foundation stone shall be arranged 
according to the preferences of the promoters. The promoters may even plan a cer￾emony for the foundation stone laying.
Arrangements for the storage of construction materials shall be made on-site, 
necessitating the construction of a temporary site store. This site store serves as the 
storage facility for materials, which are then issued to the contractors. It is advisable 
to employ a dedicated storekeeper responsible for overseeing and managing the 
inventory of materials received and issued. During the initial phase, key materials 
such as cement, steel, sand, bricks, and shuttering materials are typically in 
high demand.
In the case of large project sites, using cement bags and mixing them with stone 
pebbles to produce Reinforced Concrete Cement (RCC) on-site might not be practi￾cal. Hence, arrangements shall be made for the supply of pre-mixed RCC materials, 
either from an external plant or by setting up an on-site pre-mix plant, if feasible.
For administrative purposes, a temporary site offce shall be constructed, and 
equipped with the necessary furniture such as tables, chairs, cupboards, and racks. 
Additionally, electrical points and communication ports shall be installed. If 
required, the offce can be equipped with air conditioning.

5.5 Starting Preparing for Construction158
Considering the substantial manpower required for construction, contractors 
often request temporary housing facilities near the site for the accommodation of 
workers. Consequently, temporary huts with provisions for electricity, water, and 
sewerage shall be constructed.
In addition to materials and housing, other necessary items and facilities shall be 
arranged on-site. These may include temporary electricity supply, temporary water 
supply, and portable lighting, among others. Depending on the regulations of the 
country, these arrangements can be made either through government supply agen￾cies or through the promoter’s resources.
Effcient construction necessitates the availability of various tools and equip￾ment, such as cranes, lifters, winches, carts, and trucks. Depending on the terms 
outlined in the agreement with the contractors, these items shall be made available 
before the commencement of actual construction.
Furthermore, in adherence to the terms of the contract, either the contractors or 
the promoters shall be responsible for arranging the necessary safety equipment, 
including safety belts, gloves, helmets, and shoes.

5 Civil Construction Works of the Hospital Building159
With all preparations in place to commence construction, the initial step involves 
obtaining excavation drawings and carrying out precise layout markings on the plot. 
These markings should be clearly visible to the workers.
Proceed with the excavation of the land. Notably, if the building includes a base￾ment, the excavation will naturally be deeper, necessitating the use of tools such as 
excavators. To remove the excavated mud, the material carrying belts can be used, 
as it will save a lot of manpower.
In the absence of a basement, excavation is solely for the building’s foundation. 
The extent of excavation depends on the foundation type specifed in the design. For 
a raft-type foundation design, the entire demarcated area shall be excavated. 
Conversely, if the design pertains to standalone columns, the excavation shall be 
confned to the designated space for the column footings.
When excavating the entire area, the process should initiate from one point of the 
plot and systematically progress forward. It is crucial to simultaneously remove 
excavated mud or sand during the excavation process to prevent hindrances and 
avoid the soil becoming hardened, which may necessitate re-excavation.
For deeper excavations, it is imperative to implement adequate measures to pre￾vent unexcavated land from collapsing into the pit, as this could result in serious 
accidents. Following the advice of the designers and architects, precautionary mea￾sures shall be taken.
It is advisable to securely store a portion of the excavated soil or sand, as it will 
be required for backflling after the construction of basement walls or foundations. 
Insuffcient storage may lead to additional procurement of soil at an extra cost to the 
promoters or contractors.
Upon completion of the excavation, the surface of the excavated pit shall be 
appropriately levelled and prepared for laying the foundation. Incorporating level 
markers within the pit can facilitate the foundation-laying process.
5.7 Building Construction
See Table 5.7.
Given the signifcance of time in the construction process, it is crucial to expedite 
building construction as much as possible. Delays in construction beyond the esti￾mated timeframe can potentially lead to increased construction costs owing to 
infation, as well as postponement in the operational launch of the hospital, resulting 
in potential proft losses.

Conversely, timely completion of the building can lead to cost savings and facili￾tate the operational launch of the hospital. If the building is completed within or 
even before the designated time, it can serve as an added advantage for the promot￾ers, enabling them to generate revenue earlier than anticipated. If fnancially viable, 
the promoters may even consider offering incentives to the contractors for the timely 
completion of the project.
It is advisable to motivate the contractors to continue construction work in all 
three shifts, if feasible. Otherwise, construction shall at least progress in two shifts 
per day. This strategy helps ensure timely project completion, contributing to poten￾tial cost savings and early operationalization of the hospital.

Upon completion of the excavation and levelling of the pit, the foundation work 
shall be initiated.
To begin, ensure thorough compaction of the soil using appropriate heavy-duty 
tools, after moistening the soil with water. Random testing of the compacted soil 
shall be promptly conducted.
Next, proceed with the laying of the layer of Plain Cement Concrete (PCC) 
according to the structural design specifcations of the building. The thickness of the 
PCC layer shall comply with the designated requirements, followed by effective 
compaction.
Once the PCC layer is in place, proceed to mark the layout of the column foot￾ings or the raft.
Subsequently, carry out the binding of the steel for reinforcement and meticu￾lously verify the levels and alignment of the steel structure. Take necessary precau￾tions to ensure that the reinforced steel remains properly aligned during the process 
of shuttering for casting.
Arrange appropriate shuttering for the footings or the raft, utilizing materials 
such as wooden planks, plyboard, or steel plates.
Recheck the levels and alignment of the footings before commencing the casting 
of the foundation. During the casting process, ensure the use of vibrators for effec￾tive compaction of the RCC material.
Following casting, initiate a rigorous curing process from the following day 
onward. Extensive curing promotes a stronger molecular binding between the 
cement and stone pebbles, thereby enhancing the strength of the RCC casting.
During the casting process, ensure adequate provision of space for creating pits 
for the elevators in accordance with the specifcations provided by the elevator 
manufacturers.
5.9 Works from the Basement Up to the Plinth Level
See Table 5.9.
After the completion of the foundation casting and ongoing curing process, the 
next step involves marking the layout of the columns on the foundation approxi￾mately a week after the casting. This is followed by the commencement of rein￾forcement steel works and the erection of the steel structure at the designated 
column locations. Ensure that the steel structure is securely fxed, levelled, and 
aligned, with proper support in place to maintain its stability.
Proceed to install the shuttering for the columns, which can be made of wooden 
planks, plyboard, or preferably, the recommended steel box type shuttering. Prior to 
casting, verify and adjust the alignment and level of both the shuttering and the steel 
structure.
During the casting of the columns, utilize pin-type vibrators to ensure thorough 
compaction of the RCC material, eliminating any potential air pockets. Limit the 
height of the column casting to 2000 mm in a single operation, maintaining the top

Initiate the curing process for the column castings, ensuring water seepage from 
the sides and top to facilitate thorough curing. After 2–3 days, remove the shuttering 
and reposition it for the casting of the remaining section of the column. Upon com￾plete casting, allow the RCC to settle before removing the shuttering. The subse￾quent half of the column can then be cast, followed by another round of curing as 
recommended by the architects and structural engineers. Wrapping the column with 
gunny cloth and water application on the cloth can aid in improved curing.
For the outer walls of the basements, which are also constructed using RCC, 
ensure completion of reinforcement steel works, shuttering, casting, and curing in 
accordance with the design specifcations.
Following a week after the casting of the outer walls, commence the shuttering 
work for the beams and slabs, noting that the slabs and beams are cast 
simultaneously.
Upon completing the shuttering, adjust and level the beams and slab shuttering, 
and erect the reinforcement steel for the beams and slab as per the structural engi￾neer’s specifcations. Verify the alignment and level of the slab and beams after the 
steelworks, preparing them for the casting process.
5.9 Works from the Basement Up to the Plinth Level164
Cast the beams and slab in a single operation to avoid potential leakage from 
joints. Initiate curing by ensuring water retention on the top of the slab. After the 
recommended curing time, remove the shuttering from the slab, beams, and column.
Clean the foor by removing debris and preparing it for subsequent activities. 
Move the shuttering material to the next foor for reuse. Simultaneously, commence 
the internal brick/block work of the already cast basement while the structure work 
for the next upper basement or ground foor is in progress.
Once internal brick/block work is completed, the conduiting activities, including 
MEP, shall be completed, and proceed with the plaster work. Ensure proper affxing, 
alignment, and levelling of door and window frames, providing adequate support 
before installation. Attend to any necessary repairs for the chase cutting performed 
for the conduits, closing any openings in the walls and fnishing all edges and cor￾ners meticulously.
Before beginning the fooring, apply the recommended waterproofng treatment, 
particularly for the foor and toilets. Pay special attention to the proper and effective 
waterproofng of the RCC outer walls of the basement. Apply a waterproof com￾pound to the outer walls of the basement, followed by the fxing of Kota stone or any 
other non-porous hard stone.
After completing the treatment of the outer wall, proceed with the backflling of 
mud and sand, ensuring thorough compaction using appropriate tools and water.
Note: These civil activities need to be separately conducted for all the basements 
of the building. At this stage, the work has been completed up to the plinth level. It 
is now time to construct the ground foor and subsequent upper foors.
5.10 Civil Works
See Table 5.10.
After a week of the casting of the slab of the lower foor, the layout of the col￾umns shall be marked on the slab. Then, the reinforcement steel works shall be car￾ried on. The steel structure of the column shall be fxed, levelled, and aligned. It is 
essential to provide adequate support to maintain the stability of the column steel 
structure.
Install the shuttering for the column, choosing between wooden planks, ply￾boards, or the recommended steel box type shuttering. After the shuttering is in 
place, recheck and adjust the alignment and level of both the shuttering and the steel 
structure.
Move on to the casting of the column, utilizing pin-type vibrators for effective 
compaction of the RCC material, leaving no air gaps in the process. It is crucial to 
limit the column casting to a maximum height of 2000 mm in a single operation. 
Additionally, maintain the top surface of the casting at a 45-degree angle to prevent 
the formation of straight joints between different castings during subsequent 
operations.

Now is the time to start curing the column castings, the water is poured from the 
sides and top so that the water seeps inside the shuttering and from the top.
After 2 to 3 days, remove the shuttering and move it upwards for the next casting 
of the left-over column. Once the column is completely casted, let the RCC settle 
down. After settlement, remove the shuttering. The next half of the column is casted. 
Again, start curing. Curing shall be done for the duration as recommended by the 
architects and structure engineers. For better curing of the columns, it is advised to 
wrap the column with the gunny cloth and pour water on the gunny cloth.
Following the week after the column casting, begin the shuttering process for the 
beams and slab, keeping in mind that the slab and beams are casted 
simultaneously.
Once the shuttering is completed, ensure the levelness of the beams and slab 
shuttering. Erect the reinforcement steel for the beams and slab according to the 
design provided by the structural engineer.
Recheck the levelness of the slab and beams after the steelworks and prepare 
them for the casting of the beams and slab. Cast the beams and slab in one go to 
prevent potential leaks from joints. Initiate curing with the help of water retention 
on the top of the slab. Once the recommended curing duration is over, open the shut￾tering of the slab, beams, and column.
Clear the foor of debris and move the shuttering material to the next foor for 
reuse. Commence the structure work for the upper foor while simultaneously start￾ing the external and internal brick/block work of the previously cast foor.
Upon completing the external and internal brick/block work, begin and complete 
conduiting for other services before commencing plaster work. Refer to the appro￾priate section in this chapter for detailed information on the activities of other 
services.
After completing all the conduiting activities, including MEP, proceed with the 
plaster work. Remember to install the door and window frames, ensuring their 
alignment and levelness and providing appropriate support. Repair any chase cut￾ting done for the conduits, close all openings in the wall, and attend to any necessary 
repairs. Pay attention to fnishing all edges and corners on the walls.
Before fooring, apply the recommended waterproofng treatment for the foor, 
particularly focusing on effective waterproofng treatment for the toilets.
Note: All these civil activities have to be separately carried out for all the foors 
of the building.
5.11 Flooring
See Table 5.11.
Regarding the fooring of the hospital building, the choice of materials, including 
marble, ceramic tiles, or granite stone, depends on the preference of the promoters 
and designers. Regardless of the fooring type, the installation process remains rela￾tively the same.

Begin by checking and confrming the foor levels. Thereafter, the level markers 
shall be provided on the foor. Subsequently, affx the tiles, marble, or granite foor￾ing using cement. In case the tiles are used and the base foor is in level, the fxing 
compounds can also be used. However, cement is preferred on the raw surface to 
ensure more accurate and levelled fxing.
Allow the foor to dry for approximately 2 days and inspect for any air gaps 
beneath the fooring. If any gaps are identifed, it is advisable to remove the affected 
piece and reinstall it with a new one. Fill the gaps between the tiles or granite with 
cement or the compound recommended by the architect.
When using marble stone, initiate the grinding process as per the recommended 
guidelines once the foor is set. However, if ceramic tiles or granite are employed, 
no grinding is necessary. Protect the fnished fooring with a plastic sheet and apply 
liquid Plaster of Paris (POP) to the sheet to prevent breakage or scratches. Remove 
the sheet only when the building is entirely furnished and ready for operations.
Similarly, affx wall tiles in the toilets and install toilet fooring, ensuring the 
gaps are grouted and the tiles are thoroughly checked for any remaining air spaces, 
as done during the installation of room fooring.
For staircases, it is common to use granite or marble for fooring, following the 
same installation process as general fooring.
Regarding ramps, special attention must be paid to using rough tiles to prevent 
slips and accidents. The process of fxing the ramp fooring remains the same.
5.12 False Ceiling
See Table 5.12.
In hospital buildings, the false ceiling is essentially required as most of the ser￾vice line runs over the false ceiling and below the slab. These service lines typically

The false ceiling can be installed using various materials such as Plaster of Paris 
(POP), gypsum board, tiles, or PVC panels. Regardless of the material chosen, the 
installation process remains largely similar.
Before commencing the installation of the false ceiling, detailed drawings and 
designs of the false ceiling shall be prepared well in advance.
Begin by checking the level of the ceiling and marking out the levels to ensure a 
consistent false ceiling height. Subsequently, fx the perimeter on the wall, which 
serves as the support for the ceiling frame.
After the perimeter, the hangers shall be installed on the ceiling with the Fowler 
bolts to support the false ceiling frame. Thereafter, proceed with the erection of the 
ceiling frame.
Double-check the levels of the ceiling frame before securing the false ceiling.
Initiate the installation of the false ceiling using the predetermined material, such 
as Plaster of Paris (POP), gypsum board, tiles, or PVC panels, following the prede￾termined design.

To begin, attach the doors to the pre-installed door frames using hinges. Install 
door accessories such as locks, handles, stoppers, and door closers.
Set the margin on the door frame at the joint of the door frame and wall to ensure 
proper alignment.
Next, proceed with the window installation. Start by securing the window frame 
in the designated space for the windows. Then, fx the windowpanes onto the win￾dow frames. Attach accessories like handles, bolts, and stoppers to the window￾panes and fx the glass securely in place.
If the building is centrally air-conditioned and has fxed windows as per the 
design, the windowpanes are not affxed, and the glass is directly mounted onto the 
window frame.
Establish the margin on the window frame at the joint of the window frame and 
wall for accurate ftting. Install wire mesh either on the windowpanes or on the 
window frame, depending on the window type (single or double).
If included in the design, fx the security grills made of aluminium, mild steel 
(MS), or stainless steel (SS) for added safety.
5.14 Aluminium Work
See Table 5.14.
If the design calls for aluminium doors and windows rather than wood, the sub￾sequent step involves the installation of the doors and windows before the fnal 
room fnishing.
To begin, securely attach the door frame to the wall using proper screws. Proceed 
to mount the doors with hinges onto the pre-installed door frames. For double doors 
operating with foor machines, install the door machines by cutting out the foor to 
accommodate them. These doors, constructed from extruded aluminium sections 
and flled with board and/or glass, should have their accessories, including locks, 
handles, stoppers, and door closers, properly affxed.
Following the door installation, move on to the window fxtures. Start by fxing 
the window frame within the allocated window space. Attach the windowpanes onto 
the window frames and install accessories like handles, bolts, and stoppers as neces￾sary. Secure the glass onto the windowpanes.
In instances where the building is centrally air-conditioned and has fxed win￾dows according to the design, there is no requirement for separate windowpanes, as 
the glass can be directly installed onto the window frame.
Fix wire mesh either onto the windowpanes or directly onto the window frame, 
depending on the type of window (single or double).
If specifed in the design, attach security grills made of aluminium to ensure 
enhanced security.
Additionally, certain areas within the hospital might necessitate the installation 
of aluminium partitions. If so, the partitions shall be made out of extruded

5.15 Wall Guards
See Table 5.15.
Wall guards are fxed on the walls in the corridors and are used to prevent dam￾age to the walls while the movement of stretcher trollies or other movable items. 
Usually, while the movement of the materials in the corridors, the trollies strike the 
wall, hence damaging the wall. Wall guards are generally made up of aluminium, 
stainless steel, wood, or mild steel. The wall guards are generally installed at a 
height of about 1000 mm from the foors.
Another advantage of the wall guards is that it gives support to elderly people 
and physically compromised persons.
These guards are fxed on the wall with the help of screws or fasteners.
5.16 Curtain Track, IV Rods, and Corner Guards
See Table 5.16.
Usually, curtains are provided on all the patient beds in the hospital to provide 
privacy to the patient.
For providing the curtains on the bed, frstly the hangers need to be fxed above 
the bed. To fx the hangers, the rods are suspended from the ceiling wherein the 
lower end of the rods shall be at a height of about 2100 mm from the foor.
On the lower end of the rod, the curtain track is screwed. Other accessories like 
stoppers and curtain roller rings are installed. Once the painting and fnishing are 
complete, the curtains are hung in these curtain roller rings.
Similarly, the IV rods are also fxed by suspending them from the ceiling.
Corner guards are fxed on the corners of the walls and are used to prevent dam￾age to the corners. Corner guards are generally made up of aluminium, stainless 
steel, wood, or mild steel. The corner guards are generally 1000 mm in height.
These guards are fxed on the corners of the wall with the help of screws or 
fasteners.

5.20 Lifts/Elevators
See Table 5.20.
In a multi-story hospital, vertical lifts serve as a crucial means of effcient verti￾cal transportation between different foors. This system plays a pivotal role in the 
movement of patients, medical equipment, support services, personnel, and visitors 
within the facility.
Lifts also play a vital role in enabling evacuation protocols in the event of emer￾gencies or accidents. The operation of lifts is typically regulated by national statu￾tory regulations in the majority of countries. Hence, the lifts need to adhere to the 
stipulated requirements outlined by the relevant government authority.
To initiate the installation process for the lift, the frst step involves preparing the 
lift well. A lift well refers to the vertical shaft within which the lift operates. The 
construction of the lift well entails designing and preparing the necessary drawings 
based on the dimensions and specifcations provided by the original lift 
manufacturer.
The construction process involves erecting columns with beams on each foor, 
followed by the placement of brickwork between the columns and beams to shape

the shaft. Subsequently, the interior and exterior of the lift well are plastered, and a 
coat of paint is applied to both sides. Using wall putty inside the well and ensuring 
a smooth surface can minimize the likelihood of spider webs forming within the 
well. The exterior painting can be coordinated with the building’s overall aesthetic.
Considering the lack of natural light within the lift well, a lighting fxture shall 
be installed to facilitate maintenance work by ensuring clear visibility.
At the bottom of the lift well, a pit is also provided, where the springs are 
installed, for the easy and jerk-free landing of the lift car. As this well is below 
ground level, it is necessary to waterproof the surfaces of the pit to avoid any seep￾age of the water.
In the case of lifts that are not ‘Machine Room Less’ (MRL), a machine room 
must be built atop the lift well to house the lift’s machinery. However, MRL lifts are 
commonly installed nowadays.
Once the lift well is ready, for installation of the lift, it is handed over to the ven￾dor of the lifts for installation. The scaffolding shall then be erected in the entire 
well of the lift, to install the channels of the lift.
In the meantime, the electrical supply shall be provided to operate the lift. The 
power shall be adequate to operate the lift and shall be given from the dedi￾cated MCB.
Upon the installation of the door frames by the vendor, the front facade of the lift, 
where the doors open, undergoes wall treatment. Typically, marble or granite stone 
shall be used to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the lift’s front side.
Following this, the lift is handed over to the hospital authorities, who conduct a 
comprehensive assessment of the lift’s functionality and parameters. If everything is 
deemed satisfactory, the lift can be made available for regular use.
Once the lift has been installed, the same has to be commissioned by the vendor 
by checking the operation and safety parameters of the lift.
Subsequently, the lift shall be handed over to the hospital authorities, who in turn 
shall check the operation and all other parameters of the lift. If everything is found 
to be perfect, it can be approved for actual use.

Electrical Works of the Hospital Building
In any hospital project, it is crucial to evaluate the power needs for operating equip￾ment, providing general electrical outlets, operating air conditioning systems, light￾ing and other essential functions. Additionally, it is equally important to identify 
specifc areas that may require special power considerations such as magnetic reso￾nance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography–computed tomography 
(PET–CT), linear accelerators (LINACs) and other specialised equipment.
The enclosed checklist provides the sequence of all such electrical works that 
have to be conducted inside the proposed building, and thus helps the site engineer 
plan the start and end days of each activity along with the present status of that par￾ticular activity.
6.1 Internal Electrical Works Inside a Hospital Building
See Table 6.1.
Electrical services are one of the most important components of a hospital build￾ing and are carried out both inside the building—i.e. on foors—and outside the 
building—like substations etc.
Here, we highlight the works and activities that are to be carried out on the foors 
inside the building.
The frst step is laying conduits and fxing switch boxes. By cutting a chase in the 
wall, the conduits are laid and held in place with hooks. Similarly, switch boxes are 
also fxed to the wall after cutting a space in the wall. Once fxed, the walls are plas￾tered to conceal them. Similarly, as per the drawings and designs, conduits may or 
may not be laid on the ceilings or foors.
Once the conduiting of the rooms are completed, the main conduits are laid from 
the room to the main distribution box (DB) of the area. If required, cable trays are 
also laid either suspended from the ceiling or fxed to the wall.180

The next step is to lay electrical cables and wires. Cabling is done from the main 
DB to the concerned switchboard and then to the concerned electrical outlets. 
Separate cabling needs to be done for fans and electrical and power loads. In hospi￾tals, usually, bed head panels are provided to supply medical gases. In these bed 
head panels, electrical outlets are also provided. Hence, separate cabling needs to be 
done for these bed head panels. Inside hospital rooms, electrical outlets are provided 
for fans, light appliances and power points. The switchboards are fxed to the walls 
of the rooms.
Now comes the fxing of the distribution boards (DBs). DBs generally have min￾iature circuit breakers (MCBs), which control the supplies to the switchboards of 
the rooms. If an overload is noticed or there is any fault in the room lines, then the 
DB trips automatically. Individual wires are laid from the switchboard of the room 
to the respective DB.
From DBs, cables are laid to be terminated at the foor’s low-tension (LT) panel. 
In turn, the LT panel is connected to the main panel of the building.
Once painting of the rooms is done, electrical appliances like lights and fans are 
installed in the rooms, corridors, etc.
In case the hospital building is centrally air conditioned, air handling units 
(AHU) need to be installed. Electrical supplies will be provided to these AHUs from 
a separate MCB in the respective DB.
6.1 Internal Electrical Works Inside a Hospital Building182
As continuous power backup is essential in a hospital building, the provision will 
be made for either a centralised uninterruptible power supply (UPS) or separate 
UPSs for different areas. If a central UPS is designed, the cabling should be done 
separately for each area and should terminate at the different DBs. From the DB, the 
cabling should be laid, which should terminate at the respective UPS.
Adequate arrangements for emergency lights in all the important areas of the 
hospital must be made.
Hospitals provide several services, which require a heavy load of electricity. 
Apart from this, there are a few sophisticated and sensitive machines that may 
require good quality electricity. Hence, it is always advisable to install a separate 
electrical panel for these areas, so as to provide controlled and regulated electrical 
supply. These types of panels can be planned for heating, ventilation and air condi￾tioning (HVAC), imaging departments, clinical laboratories, operating theatres, 
Cath lab, linear accelerators (LINACs), frefghting, elevators, etc.
Note: Please note that all the above activities of various services have to be car￾ried out for all the foors of the building.
6.2 Centralised Electrical Works
See Table 6.2.
Both central and control works for effective supply of electricity to the end users 
are required to be carried out in the hospital building well in time. Once the electri￾cal internal works are completed, the works of the central and control works should 
be started. However, if time or progress allows, then these works can also be started 
simultaneously along with the internal electrical works.
The central and control works of electricity supply include various modalities 
like an High Tension (HT) substation, a main Low Tension (LT) panel, a foor panel, 
distribution boxes, Moulded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB) and Miniature Circuit 
Breaker (MCB), diesel generator sets, a UPS system, earthing, lightning arrestors 
and solar power system.
Now, let us discuss all these modalities one by one.
6.2.1 HT Substation Works
An HT substation of a hospital is usually required in case the connection to the 
hospital is released by the service provider through high-tension (HT) lines. In case 
the connection is supplied through low-tension (LT) lines, a complete substation is 
not required and only a meter room will suffce.
If it is an HT line, then the cables have to be laid from the grid and terminated at 
the energy meter installed in the hospital meter room. However, if it is an LT line,

then the cables need to be laid from the transformer of the service provider to the 
energy meter installed in the hospital meter room.
In either case, the cost of laying the cable has to be worked out and clarifed by 
the service provider as to who is going to bear this cost. In the case of the HT line, 
usually, the benefciary has to pay the amount, whereas, in the case of the LT line, 
the service provider bears the cost of laying these cables.
There is one more scenario, which is the independent feeder provided by the 
service provider. An independent feeder means that on this feeder, no other connec￾tion will be released to other users and the power will be supplied to only one ben￾efciary. In this case, the entire cost of cabling from the feeder to the energy meter 
in the hospital also has to be borne by the benefciary.
In either of the cases, the project engineer should ensure that the cable is laid 
properly and terminates in the meter room of the hospital.
Next is the installation of the energy meter. It is the responsibility of the hospital 
to provide an energy meter room at a convenient place near the main gate of the 
hospital so that the meter can be read by the service provider without entering the 
hospital building. The size of the meter room should be approximately 
3048 mm × 3048 mm. There should be proper ventilation in the room, and the door 
of the room should be about 915 mm wide. It has to be strictly ensured that there is 
no seepage in the room and that outside water or rain water cannot enter the room 
under any circumstances.
The meter should be fxed on one of the walls of the room, and the cable connect￾ing the grid should terminate at this meter.
The meter should be sealed by the service provider in the presence of the hospital 
authorities, and the meter sealing report and certifcate should be signed by both 
parties. One copy of this report cum certifcate should be safely secured by the hos￾pital authorities.
In case the supply to the hospital is from the HT line, the power in the energy 
meter will also be on HT. This HT power needs to be stepped down to LT power 
through the transformer. As there is always the chance of any fault in the HT line, a 
protection device should be installed between the energy meter and the transformer. 
Hence, a vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) is provided just after the energy meter.
To install a Vacuum Circuit Breaker (VCB), the foundation should be laid, prefer￾ably in a separate room (other than the meter room). The size of the foundation 
should be as per the specifcations provided by the manufacturer of the VCB. It is 
advised that the VCB be installed in front of the wall, which is common to both the 
rooms i.e. the meter room and the VCB room. Sleeves should be installed on this 
common wall to cross the cables from the energy meter to the VCB. The size of the 
VCB room should be approximately 3048 mm × 3048 mm. The room should have 
proper ventilation, and the door of the room should be about 915 mm wide. As in the 
case of the meter room, it should be ensured that the VCB room also has no seepage 
and that outside water or rain water cannot enter the room under any circumstances.
Once the foundation is ready, the VCB is installed by the vendor. Thereafter, the 
cable connecting the meter and the VCB is provided, and the VCB should be tested 
to ensure proper supply of power and working of the VCB.
6.2 Centralised Electrical Works186
Next is the installation of the transformer. A transformer is required to step down 
the HT voltage to the LT voltage. A transformer should be installed outside the 
building and should be open so that it can be properly cooled by air. The size and 
load-bearing capacity of the foundation should be as per the specifcations provided 
by the original manufacturer of the transformer. Although there are no specifed 
norms, it is recommended that the height of the transformer not be less than 
1000 mm from the ground level. While laying the foundation, all the norms of civil 
construction like the ratio of concrete, use of vibrator and curing should be 
adhered to.
Once the foundation is ready, the transformer should be installed and properly 
connected to the VCB through the HT cable. The transformer should be commis￾sioned and tested for proper output of the LT voltage.
Then comes the stage where the output of energy from the transformer has to be 
transmitted to the hospital building. The frst step is to provide the facility for laying 
cables or busbar from the transformer to the main LT panel of the hospital. The 
cable or busbar can be laid either in the trenches or in the overhead cable trays. As 
the substation is outside the main hospital building, it is recommended that the cable 
be laid in underground trenches. However, if cable trays are provided, then they can 
be also overhead. These connecting cables or the busbar should be connected to the 
output of the transformer and terminate in the main LT panel room.
It is further recommended that the main power supply be routed through the 
servo stabiliser installed in the hospital before entering the LT main panel. There are 
always chances of voltage fuctuations and, at such a time, a pure sine wave may not 
be obtained as output. Sensitive electronic medical devices can be damaged due to 
such fuctuations and spikes. Hence, providing a servo stabiliser with a spike burster 
is recommended. If such a stabiliser is installed, then the main cable or busbar from 
the transformer should terminate at this stabiliser. The output of this stabiliser 
should be connected to the main LT panel of the hospital.
In case of any fault in the transformer or the connecting cables/busbar and or 
precaution of the LT panel, a bus coupler should be provided between the trans￾former and the LT panel.
6.2.2 The LT Panel Room
The LT power obtained from the output of the transformer or the servo stabiliser, as 
the case may be, should be connected to the main LT panel installed in the hospital. 
The main LT panel is usually installed in the main building or in an annexure build￾ing near the main building. The LT panel acts as the main control panel for control￾ling the electricity of the entire hospital building. From this LT panel, various 
circuits are drawn and connected to the individual foor panels of the hospital.
The LT panel also facilitates connecting the power generated by the diesel gen￾erator (DG) set. The LT panel has a provision for incoming power from the main 
power supply and the power supply from the DG set. There is an automatic and 
6 Electrical Works of the Hospital Building187
manual bypass of the main power and the DG power. If the main supply is available, 
the the incoming from DG power will get disconnected, and vice versa.
From the main LT panel, various circuits are drawn and connected to the rising 
main cables or rising main busbar, provided in the building for the supply of power 
to different parts of the building. For laying down the rising main cable/busbar, a 
dedicated service shaft should be provided near the main LT panel room. This shaft 
should travel through the entire foor of the hospital building. These cables or the 
busbar should be properly affxed to the wall of the shaft with the help of fasteners, 
and the open spaces of the shaft should be properly sealed so that in case of fre, the 
smoke from the cable/busbar shaft does not travel to the upper or lower foors.
Along with the LT panel, a capacitor panel should be installed to control the 
power factor of the power. This panel is again connected to the main LT panel.
The rising main cable/busbar should terminate individually at all the foor panels 
installed on the individual foors of the hospital. To facilitate this, a small panel 
room should be provided on each foor just one above the other. An individual foor 
panel should be installed in these panel rooms, and the rising main cable/busbar 
should be connected to these foor panels.
From these foor panels, different circuits are formed and connected to the DBs 
at various locations on the foor.
6.2.3 Diesel Generator (DG) Sets
In a hospital setup, there are always chances of power failure due to any reason what 
so ever. Power failure in hospitals is unacceptable. Hence, there should be provision 
for the supply of uninterrupted power in hospitals and, as such, a backup power 
system should be facilitated. Although there are other sources like solar power etc., 
the best source is a diesel generator set.
What should be the capacity of a DG set? During the planning of the electrical 
load, the total load of the building is calculated. The rating of DG sets should be 
decided and calculated based on the power required at peak load and at normal non￾peak load. Considering this load, the power required for non-essential services like 
air conditioning, heavy lighting, etc. is deducted and the load required from the DG 
set is calculated. About 20% extra is added to this load to avoid overloading on the 
DG set. This will provide the total capacity required for the DG set. Furthermore, it 
is recommended that instead of going in for one DG set of the calculated capacity, 
it is better to opt for two DG sets of less capacity so that in case of failure of either 
of the DG sets, the other is available as a backup.
Once the order for the DG set is placed, the specifcation of the foundation from 
the manufacturer of the DG set in terms of the size of the foundation and its load￾bearing capacity considering the vibration load of the DG set should be taken. 
Accordingly, the foundation of the DG set should be constructed. Ensuring the 
proper curing of the foundation is also essential.
6.2 Centralised Electrical Works188
Now is the time for the installation of the DG set on the foundation. The DG set 
should be affxed with the help of fasteners. Proper vibration pads should be pro￾vided below the body of the DG set during installation. Other accessories like fuel 
tanks, silencers, etc. should be installed. The open end of a silencer should be at 
least 1524 mm higher than the height of the building.
Provision for onsite storage of diesel for generator sets should be provided. The 
amount of diesel to be stored is determined by the estimated running hours of 
the DG set.
If more than one DG set is installed, then it must be ensured that all such DG sets 
are of the same frequency so that they can be easily synchronised on a common 
busbar. Once all the DGs are installed, all these sets should be synchronised to a 
common busbar. These DG sets will provide power automatically in the absence of 
a primary power supply or when the supply voltage falls below a predetermined 
level. Hence, DG sets should have for the capacity to auto-start.
DG sets should be commissioned and tested. Thereafter, the output from the 
busbar should be taken to the DG panel (if provided separately) or otherwise con￾nected to the main LT panel provided in the hospital building, through the bus cou￾pler. This connection will be one of the incomers for the main LT panel.
6.2.4 Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Systems
In any hospital, there are a number of medical devices like ventilators, CT scanners, 
operation theatre devices, etc., which require uninterrupted power supply. If power 
is switched off even for a second, then these machines will shut down, which can 
prove fatal to patients. Hence, the best option is to install uninterruptible power sup￾ply (UPS) devices.
For calculating the capacity of a UPS, the electrical load of the medical devices 
should be worked out, about 20% should be added to this load (to avoid overloading 
on the UPS) and the required capacity of the UPS should be calculated. The next 
issue is the backup time. As a UPS works on a battery system, the more the backup 
time will be, the more the number of batteries that will be required. Usually, it is 
recommended that the backup be about 20–30 min.
Critical care units such as intensive care unit (ICU), neonatal care unit (NICU), 
emergency and so on must each have a dedicated UPS system connected to the 
concerned unit. Few light points (not all are required) and approximately half of the 
electrical outlets should be connected to the UPS circuit. These outlets should be 
used to connect life-saving machines such as monitors, invasive and non-invasive 
ventilators and so on. It is recommended that a three-phase online UPS be installed 
in all the ICUs separately. The UPS rating should be designed to meet the require￾ments. For example, the UPS rating for a 10-bed ICU should be around 5–10 kVA 
on average.
For emergency lighting in the hospital building, a single UPS or a foor UPS can 
be used. The UPS rating should be designed based on the load requirement.
6 Electrical Works of the Hospital Building189
As far as the operating rooms (ORs) are concerned, each OR should have a dedi￾cated UPS system. The plenum and peripheral lights should be connected through 
the UPS circuit. All the electrical outlets and sockets should also be connected to the 
UPS so that power can be supplied to the machines and equipment in the OR, in 
case of failure of the primary power. It is recommended that in ORs, a three-phase 
online UPS be provided. The rating of the UPS should be designed as per the 
requirement. Generally, the rating of the UPS for each OR should not be less 
than 10 kVA.
A UPS should also be provided for the hospital server and the working nodes and 
distribution switches located throughout the hospital. One dedicated UPS should be 
provided for each server, and a small offine UPS should be installed for each work￾ing node and distribution switches. Otherwise, a dedicated UPS power supply line 
can be installed in the building to provide power backup to all information technol￾ogy (IT) equipment such as computers, closed-circuit television (CCTV), wi-f rout￾ers, fre panels, alarms and so on. The UPS rating should be designed to meet the 
requirements.
For high-rated MRI, CT or LINAC machines, a dedicated UPS system for each 
should be provided. This UPS system for each machine should be placed near the 
concerned machine.
The next step is installing the UPS. If all the UPSs are placed at a common loca￾tion in the hospital, one room of adequate size should be constructed, which is 
generally not assessable. The size of the room should be determined based on the 
number of UPS systems to be installed in the room. Because battery life is heavily 
infuenced by room temperature, the temperature in UPS rooms should be kept 
between 18 and 22 °C. Alarm systems should also be installed in the UPS room, for 
warning in case the temperature rises above the normal range. As batteries produce 
fumes, the room should also have adequate provision for exhaust.
If individual UPS systems are to be provided at different locations in the hospital 
or for different machines separately, then there is no need to provide a separate 
room. Providing a separate enclosure for a UPS at the concerned location of the 
machine is suffcient.
Once the UPS is placed in position, the battery bank should be connected to the 
UPS. It must be ensured that the batteries are properly positioned on the stands and 
that they are connected to each other and, fnally, to the UPS.
In case a common UPS is provided for the emergency lighting of the building, 
the UPS output should be connected to the main LT panel kept in the hospital build￾ing, with auto switchover provision.
6.2.5 Earthing
For almost every electrical installation at the hospital, earthing should preferably be 
provided. Earthing should be provided for the entire HT/LT distribution system. 
This can be accomplished by establishing a local maintenance-free earth station and 
6.2 Centralised Electrical Works190
bonding the cables/equipment. Earthing should be accomplished using an insulated 
copper earthing wire that runs throughout the length of circuits, terminates at boxes 
or electrical fxtures and is bonded to the main earth.
Separate chemical earthing should be carried out using copper electrodes for the 
entire UPS system units, electronic private automatic branch exchange (EPABX), 
servers, lifts and low-voltage systems.
Most importantly, equipotential bonding for all hospital equipment is required. 
This is accomplished by connecting the metal bodies of the aforementioned equip￾ment to the earth bonding bar (EBB), which is then connected to the chemical earthing.
Critical units, such as ORs, should be earthed using a dedicated EBB that is 
located near the Operating Room (OR).  Other areas require Earth Bonding Bar 
(EBB) in the respective sub-electrical rooms where the fnal DBs are installed. 
Major machines, such as MRI machines, CT devices, LINACs, chillers and so on, 
should have supplementary earthing and bonding with a dedicated EBB.
All electrical panels and sub-panels should be bonded and earthed separately 
with a separate EBB.
It should be ensured that all the HT, LT and foor panels, including the DBs, are 
properly earthed.
Similarly, for medical devices for which separate earthing is recommended by 
the manufacturer of the device, earthing should be provided as per the specifcation 
provided.
6.2.6 Lightning Arrestors
A lightning arrestor is a device that is installed on the outside and top of a building 
to prevent structural damage caused by lightning and similar discharges. It also 
protects against secondary damage, such as strikes that cause branches of nearby 
trees to fall. Lightning arrestors also help protect a building’s vulnerable wires 
and cables.
The project engineer should ensure that lightning arrestors are installed properly 
at the recommended height. The arrestors should be properly secured and supported 
by wires so that they do not fall by wind pressure.
After installation, the arrestors should be properly earthed to the ground by the 
methods recommended by the manufacturers of the same.
6.2.7 The Solar Electrical System
Solar electrical power is a renewable source of energy. If the roof top of the hospital 
allows for the installation of a solar power system, then the promotor should opt for 
same. If it is planned, then the frst step should be calculation of the capacity of 
panels that can be installed considering the size of the solar panel, shading area and 
6 Electrical Works of the Hospital Building191
the direction of the sun. Once this exercise is done, the capacity and number of solar 
panels are fnalised.
Depending on the number of solar panels, the foundation should be prepared. It 
is recommended that the foundation not be directly placed on the fnal surface of the 
rooftop but on the slab, and it is preferrable that the reinforcement steel be screwed 
to the reinforced concrete cement (RCC) slab of the roof. Next is the casting of the 
foundation. Provisions for fxing the fastener of the solar panel structure on the 
foundation should be provided. The foundation should be properly cured.
Once the foundation is ready, the prefabricated Galvanized Iron (GI) / Mild Steel 
(MS) structure of the solar panel should be fxed on the foundation. It is this struc￾ture on which the solar panel will be mounted.
Now, the solar panel is mounted on the structure and screwed properly. The 
direction of the solar panel should be aligned.
The cables coming out of the solar panels should be connected to the inverter 
provided near the solar panel.
The output of the invertor should be connected to the solar panel kept near the 
main LT panel of the building. This solar panel should then be connected to the 
main LT panel as an incomer.
Last is the metering of solar power generation. If the hospital is using the entire 
power generated by the solar system, then it should have a meter of its own just to 
keep track of the power generated from the solar power plant. If there is excess 
power or the hospital does not want to use solar power, then this unutilised power 
can be fed into the main electrical grid of the service provider through the meter. 
The charges from power fed into the grid are ultimately adjusted in the total bill of 
electricity supplied to the hospital by the service provider.
6.3 The Street Lighting System
See Table 6.3.
Hospitals typically require higher-quality lighting as many of the users and visi￾tors will have poorer mobility, eyesight and general awareness, often due to illness 
or old age. This often translates into higher average lux levels, higher uniformity, 
fewer shadows and less clutter and should be aesthetically pleasing and provide 
scalable lighting.
Hospital outdoor lighting is required for all hospital entrances, hospital roads, 
parking lots, rest gardens and building exteriors, among other things. Bright, wel￾coming, exterior lighting not only provides a sense of security for patients who 
arrive at the hospital late at night but also delight patients, already admitted, who are 
sick or are suffering from pain.
For lighting of the internal roads, GI electrical poles should be provided along￾side the roads. Cabling should be done for all electrical poles. The pole-spacing 
confguration should be such that it can improve illumination uniformity. The height 
of the pole should be at least 7 m.

Inpatient rest gardens and lawns are primarily used to beautify the environment 
and provide patients with outdoor rest and walking space. Such spaces should be 
warmly lit, but not too brightly, using low-height garden lights. The inter-distance 
of these lights should be suffcient enough to adequately illuminate the entire area. 
Special attention should be paid to provide lighting to all the nooks and corners of 
the premises.
To highlight the building, high-lumen building highlighters should be used. 
These highlighter fttings should be fxed on the ground outside the building, with 
the beam angled in such a manner as to cover the entire building elevation.
For better security of the hospital premises, it is also advised to provide lights on 
the top of the boundary wall of the hospital. For lighting of the boundary wall, 
boundary lights can be used or, otherwise, a small pole with an electrical ftting on 
top can be used. In some cases, instead of fxing the lights on the top of the 
6 Electrical Works of the Hospital Building193
boundary, GI poles (as provided for roads) can be installed alongside the boundary 
for lighting.
Similarly, on top of the columns of the main gates, lights should be provided. 
Here, any fancy electric pillar lamps can be used.
Once all the poles and light fttings are installed, the next is to ft bulbs. It is 
advised to use Light Emitting Diode (LED) bulbs instead of any other conventional 
ones as the power consumption of LED bulbs is much less as compared to those 
of others.
Cables and electrical wires should be laid, and main switches at any convenient 
place, preferably near the main security post, should be provided. However, it is 
better if external lighting is provided with a timer controller for switching ON/OFF 
as per schedule.
In case solar lights have to be used for street lighting, the GI pole should have a 
provision for fxing photoelectric cells on top of the pole and a battery box should 
be provided in the middle of the pole to place the rechargeable battery.

Water Supply and Drainage Works 
of the Hospital Building
Water is an essential element for sustaining life, and a reliable water supply and 
effcient drainage system is vital for human survival. Their importance is particu￾larly heightened in hospitals, where the well-being of ill and critical patients is at 
stake. In such healthcare facilities, it is imperative to have an excellent water supply 
and drainage system that guarantees clean, hygienic and high-quality water.
The quality of water supply and the effectiveness of the drainage system both 
have a signifcant impact on critical factors such as infection control, the lifespan of 
medical equipment and the hygiene of staff and patients. Many systems and proce￾dures within hospitals rely either partially or entirely on the availability of clean and 
treated water for the well-being of both patients and staff. Moreover, the perfor￾mance of certain medical equipment is directly infuenced by the quality of water 
they receive. Equally important is the proper drainage and treatment of wastewater.
Ensuring the reliability of the water supply system is of utmost importance. It is 
crucial to have uninterrupted access to water at all times within the hospital build￾ing. However, it is also essential to regulate the volume of water to avoid unneces￾sary wastage and prevent water stagnation in storage tanks.
The enclosed checklist provides the sequence of works related to water supply 
and drainage, which has to be carried out for the building, and helps the site engi￾neer plan the start and end days of each activity along with the present status of that 
particular activity.
7.1 Sanitary Works Inside a Hospital Building
See Table 7.1.
First is the laying of the pipelines for the supply of water and drainage. For sup￾ply lines, the water supply pipes should be laid on the walls or foors (as per the 
design and drawings) by cutting a chase on the wall. The pipes are held in place by 196

As far as the drain pipes are concerned, in case the sunken portion of the toilets 
are provided, the pipes are laid from the outlet of the drain traps and are routed 
7 Water Supply and Drainage Works of the Hospital Building197
through the service shaft of the building, terminating at the main hole on the ground 
foor, which is generally provided outside the building. In case the sunken portions 
are not provided for toilets, fne-core cutting of the slab is carried out, pipes are 
fxed and effective sealing and waterproofng are carried out around the core cutting.
For the supply of hot water, separate insulated pipelines need to be laid from the 
hot water generation source till the utility end.
Similarly, separate pipelines should be laid for drinking water right from the 
reverse osmosis (RO) water supply source till the last user end.
Then, all the foor traps should be securely fxed and sealed to avoid water leak￾age. Ensuring proper connection of the drain pipes from the traps to the drain lines, 
which terminate at the main holes, is a must.
Once the toilets and rooms are painted and fnished, bathroom and sanitary ft￾tings, such as required taps, angle valves, fush valves, faucets, brackets, soap 
dishes, towel hangers, mirrors, wash basins, commodes, etc., should be installed.
In case a nuclear medicine testing facility is provided in the hospital, a separate 
settlement tank for radiation waste should be installed before connecting it to the 
main disposal line. The toilets to be used for these patients should be connected to 
the settlement tank.
All the pipelines, drains and bathroom fttings should be tested to ensure their 
proper working.
Note: Please note that all the above activities of various services have to be car￾ried out for all the foors of the building.
To supply water in and outside the hospital building, some external works are 
also required, such as water supply, hot water supply, drainage, rainwater harvest￾ing, irrigation water supply, sewage treatment plant/effuent treatment plant (STP/
ETP), pump rooms, RO water supply, etc.

7.2.1 The Water Supply System
A hospital has various sources of water supply. These can include water supply from 
a water network supplier by connecting to their distribution network (which could 
be government-owned or private), self-owned boreholes, underground water wells 
and connections for portable water trucks, among others.
If the water source is from a self-owned borewell, then a borewell needs to be 
dug. Before digging the borewell, the designer should assess the quantity of water 
that will be required at the hospital. While assessing the quantity, the designer 
should consider factors like weather (as summers may require more water as com￾pared to winters), the peak fow requirement of water (morning hours may require

more water), the number of toilets in the hospital, expected foot fall and the number 
of human beings expected to be housed in the hospital building and the quantity of 
water required to operate and run equipment. To this fgure, at least 25% spare water 
capacity to the system should be added. Moreover, the expansion plan of the hospi￾tal that may occur in future should also be considered.
Once the quantity of water required is determined, an assessment should be con￾ducted to ascertain how many borewells will be needed to fulfl the water require￾ment. It is recommended that the number of the borewells should be more than one, 
to maintain the backup, in case one fails. The next step is to calculate the working 
hours of the borewell and the total quantity of water required per minute. Now, 
considering the water required per minute and the head (height to which water has 
to be carried to fll up the tanks), the capacity and size of the water pump should be 
determined. If using a submersible pump (which is more common these days), then 
the diameter of the pump should be ascertained. Accordingly, the diameter of the 
borewell should be fnalised, which should be 25% more than the diameter of 
the pump.
The borewell can now be dug. While digging the borewell, it must be ensured 
that the loose mud or sand does not fall back into the borewell. Both casing and a 
flter pipe should be installed in the borewell. Care should be taken that when the 
work of digging the borewell is not in progress, the borewell is covered and guarded, 
to avoid any accidents.
Once the borewell is ready, the submersible to be installed in the borewell should 
be readied. The pump should be connected to the delivery water pipeline. Once 
ready, the submersible pump should be carefully lowered down into the borewell to 
install it. Caution must be exercised when holding the pump and delivery pipe 
securely, as there are chances that the pump may fall into the borewell. If this hap￾pens, then there are no means to take the pump out. If there are any means, the cost 
of taking the pump out can be tremendous.
Once the pump is installed, an electrical connection should be provided to the 
pump for its operation from a dedicated distribution box with miniature circuit 
breakers (MCBs) of appropriate rating.
7.2 Central Works of Water Supply and the Drainage System202
After supplying electricity to the pump, it must be operated to check its function￾ality and the quality of water checked. The pump should be allowed to run for a few 
hours and the initial stream of water should be discarded, as it contains mud, sand 
and impurities from the new borewell. This needs to be done till the submersible 
supplies clean water.
In the meantime, water storage tanks should be installed on the roof of the hos￾pital building. It is preferred that a separate storage tank be provided for every main 
supply line. It is recommended that if rooftop tanks are planned, then the number of 
such tanks should be more than one. It means that a cluster of toilets, or other loca￾tions where water supply is needed, should be clubbed and dedicated tanks should 
be provided for that cluster.
In case an overhead tank is planned, then this tank should be a stand-alone and 
also be able to provide water to larger areas, such as the whole of the hospital cam￾pus. This tank resembles the one built by the municipality to supply water to an 
entire colony.
Whatever the case may be, in both the scenarios, the output from the water 
source, should be connected to the incoming line of the tank. With this connection, 
the tank will start flling up as soon as the submersible is switched on. The tank also 
has an outlet through which water is supplied to the building. The outlet of the tank 
should then be connected to the main supply line of the building.
These days, flling of the water in the tank is generally automated, and this helps 
avoid water wastage caused by tank water overfow. This device is fxed in the tank, 
and as soon as the water level in the tank falls below the indicated mark, the device 
will energise the submersible and, as a result, the submersible will switch on and the 
tank will start flling up. When the tank flls up to the indicated level, the device will 
stop the pump immediately.
The next source of water supply can be the supply from a governmental or non￾governmental water network supplier by connecting to their distribution network. In 
this case, the connection should be sanctioned by the water supply agency. Once 
this is done, the hospital’s water line will be connected to the water supply line of 
the agency. At the point of connection, the water meter is installed, to take a reading 
of the water utilised by the hospital and, based on this, the agency bills the hospital 
for water consumption. Once a meter is installed, it will be sealed by the agency in 
front of the hospital authorities. The sealing certifcate should be signed by both 
parties. One copy of the same should be retained by the hospital.
Next, a water line should be installed to fll up the hospital storage tank. Usually, 
an underground water storage tank is constructed by the hospital to store the water 
provided by the water supply agency. The reason for installing an underground 
water tank is that the supply from the agency is usually at an extremely low pressure 
and the rooftop tank or the overhead tank cannot be flled up with this pressure. In 
any case, it has to be pumped up again. Therefore, the underground tank should be 
installed to store water and subsequently to pumped it to the tanks.
A connection will then be established from the underground tank to the rooftop 
tank or the overhead tank. Once this is done, the next step is to install a pump for 
flling up the tanks from the underground tank. The rating of the pump is determined 
7 Water Supply and Drainage Works of the Hospital Building203
considering the water fow and the head (height of the building). Once the pump is 
installed, the electrical connections are completed and the pump is ready to lift 
water to the tanks. The automation process for controlling pumps, as explained 
earlier, can also be considered for this pump.
When all these installations are in progress, side by side, the main supply down￾comer for water supply to the building should also be erected. This downcomer 
should be used for supplying water from the tank to the individual foors. This 
downcomer is then connected on each foor to the foor supply line, which in turn 
carries the water to the individual water outlet.
(Usually, the problem faced on some foors is that the water pressure is low at the 
outlet. This is due to the pressure difference in the main supply downcomer line. A 
high fow of water is required in hospitals for hygienic hand washing and cleaning. 
As a result, a hospital should have a system of constant and high-fow water pres￾sure to ensure a sanitary and infection-free environment. A booster pump may be 
installed to ensure that adequate water pressure is available throughout the hospital. 
Instead of single-stage pumps, it is recommended that a multi-stage booster pump 
be used. This is also known as a water pressurisation system.
To ensure the uninterrupted working of the booster pumps or say the pressurisa￾tion system, it should be connected to an emergency power supply like uninterrupt￾ible power supply (UPS).
7.2.2 The Hot Water Supply System
Hot water is required in a hospital at several locations, including scrub sinks, hand 
wash basins, patient bathrooms, kitchen, Central Sterile Supply Department 
(CSSD), maintenance areas and the area where instruments are washed. The hot 
water systems generally provided in hospitals include electrical hot water genera￾tion, hot water generation from boiler/steam by burning fuel, solar hot water genera￾tion and stand-alone hot water geysers. Out of all, the most commonly used are 
electric hot water generators and solar hot water generators.
As the frst step, the designer should assess the quantity of hot water that will be 
required at the hospital. While assessing the quantity, the designer should consider 
factors like weather (as winters may require more hot water as compared to sum￾mers), the peak fow requirement of the hot water (morning hours may require more 
water), the number of hand scrub stations and wash basins in the hospital, expected 
footfall and the number of human beings expected to be housed in the hospital 
building and the quantity of hot water required to operate and run equipment and 
clean instruments. To this fgure, at least 25% spare water capacity to the system 
should be added. Moreover, the expansion plan of the hospital that may occur in 
future should also be considered.
Now comes the installation of the hot water system. First, the main header line 
for supply from the generation point to the foor hot water supply line is laid. This 
main header should be connected from the hot water generator to the foor supply 
7.2 Central Works of Water Supply and the Drainage System204
lines on all the foors. The laying of the foor supply lines has been discussed in the 
previous chapter.
Once the pipelines are laid, they should be insulated with moulded insulation, 
which should be fame-proof with a jacket suitable to control the temperature.
Now is the time to install a hot water generator for heating water. In case the 
hospital opts for electrical hot water generation, the same should be installed some￾where on the top of the hospital building, preferrable on the roof. A hot water gen￾erator is primarily a cylindrical tank made of stainless steel, which has been insulated 
to prevent thermal losses. High-quality heating elements are installed at the tank’s 
bottom, where they heat the water.
A thermostat, which monitors the temperature of the water, controls these ele￾ments. When the water temperature falls below the set temperature, the elements 
turn on, and, when the water temperature rises to the set temperature, they turn off. 
This tank is then connected to the main header of hot water. In between the tank and 
the main header, a gate valve is provided for safety purposes.
Once the hot water generator is installed, an electrical connection should be pro￾vided to the hot water generator for its operation from a dedicated distribution box 
with miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) of appropriate rating.
If the hospital opts for a solar hot water generation system, then the frst step is 
to install a solar hot water plant on the roof of the hospital. Solar cells with conduc￾tive copper pipe capillary lines are installed on the rooftop where they are exposed 
to sunrays. Water fows through these copper tubes within the solar cells and heats 
up. This water is then stored in an insulated water tank, from which it is distributed 
to various locations. The tank should then be connected to the main header of hot 
water. In between the tank and the main header, a gate valve should be provided for 
safety purposes.
Individual stand-alone geysers are used to provide hot water in tiny hospitals 
because it is not feasible to establish a central hot water system. The input and exit 
pipelines must be laid because these geysers are situated at various sites. The neces￾sary power switch or socket should be present near the geysers.
7.2.3 The Drainage System
To safely dispose of sewage and prevent water stagnation, hospitals should design 
effective drainage and sewage systems. The general effuent drainage system should 
be gravity-driven. Contrarily, a pressure drainage system uses a sump and pump 
connection to drain wastewater from places like basements.
Hospital drainage systems of different types should be kept apart from one 
another. This is essential for both infection control and drainage system effciency. 
In hospitals, drainage has to be provided for wastewater drainage that comes from 
basins, sinks, scrub stations and foor drains and only has contaminated water in it; 
soil water drainage from restrooms and dirty linen, urinals and toilets that typically 
have human faeces in them; storm water drainage gathered from sprinklers or rain; 
7 Water Supply and Drainage Works of the Hospital Building205
chemical drainage produced by laboratories where the waste must be neutralised 
before being discharged to the main system and radiation drainage produced by hot 
labs, settlement toilets, etc.
The frst step for the drainage system is to lay the main downcomer pipes for the 
draining, which should be installed in the shafts provided outside the building. The 
main downcomer should be securely fxed to the wall. If the downcomer is laid in 
the closed shafts, then it should be ensured that a suitable window is provided on all 
the foors for easy maintenance of the downcomer pipe.
The main downcomer should subsequently be connected to the foor sewerage 
lines. While connecting the foor lines with the main downcomer, it should be 
ensured that the joints are properly secured to prevent any type of leakage from 
the joints.
The main drain downcomer terminates at the main holes provided on the ground 
foor. Hence, main holes and gully traps should be constructed as per the drawings 
provided by the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) engineers.
As far as the main header from the basement is concerned, the same will also be 
laid upwards and will terminate at the main hole. The waste will be pumped from 
the basement through the header to the main hole.
For each main downcomer, a separate main hole should be provided around the 
hospital building. Once all the main holes are ready, they have to be connected to 
each other to create the sewerage line. This line is the main sewerage line. All the 
main holes should be connected to this main line. Ensuring that a proper slope is 
provided in the main sewerage line so that the water fows by gravity is a must.
The next step is to provide vent pipes in the entire drainage system, to avoid the 
foul smell of the effuents coming out of the drainage.
Preferably, separate foor drain lines and a main downcomer drain should be 
provided for soil water drainage generated from toilets (WCs), urinals and dirty 
utilities. Similarly, the main sewerage line laid on the ground foor should be sepa￾rate for this type of waste and terminate at the water treatment plant.
In hospitals, where biohazardous materials with suspended living organisms are 
generated from areas like isolation rooms etc., a holding tank, called a ‘kill tank’, 
should be provided. The waste from all the areas should be deposited in this kill 
tank. After treatment of the waste with the help of chemicals, the waste should be 
discharged to the main sewerage line.
In hospital setups, where a municipality sewerage disposal system is not avail￾able, a septic tank should be provided for waste disposal. Hence, the construction of 
a septic tank should be carried out as per the design provided by the engineer. All 
the sewerage lines of the hospital should then be connected to this septic tank for 
further management.
For radiation waste, a settlement/holding tank should be provided near a toilet at 
a location where it remains harmless even after being subjected to radiation. Once 
the radiation effects are settled, the water should be pumped to the main sewer￾age line.
For greasy waste from the kitchen, a drainage system should be provided with a 
grease interceptor before discharging the effuents to the external drainage network.
7.2 Central Works of Water Supply and the Drainage System206
In the meantime, the sewerage water treatment plant should be constructed. All 
the main sewerage lines should terminate at the sewerage treatment plant, where the 
waste will be processed and the treated water will be stored to be used for irrigation 
purposes.
Once the drainage system is complete and is connected to the main holes of the 
buildings, the drain water should be treated before it is fnally drained into the main 
sewerage network provided by the municipality or is discharged in soak pits.
7.2.4 Rainwater Harvesting
For collecting and harvesting rainwater from the roof of the hospital, frst of all, 
horizontal pipes should be provided on the roof. The main precaution to be taken is 
that the slope of the roof should be such that the water automatically fows towards 
these horizontal pipes. These horizontal pipes are, in turn, connected to the vertical 
pipes provided alongside the building wall or in the shaft. These vertical pipes are 
then connected to either the holding tanks or the soak pits installed on the 
ground foor.
As far as other open areas of the hospital are concerned like roads and open 
grounds, for collection of the rainwater, a network of underground pipelines should 
be provided. The rainwater fows in these pipelines and the same is carried to the 
holding tanks or soak pits for further disposal.
The water collected in the holding tanks or soak pits penetrates into the earth and 
increases the underground water level.
7.2.5 Irrigation Water Supply
For offsetting up an irrigation water supply system, the frst task is to identify the 
source from where the water for irrigation should be taken. It is not always neces￾sary that fresh underground borewell water is used for irrigation. The best option is 
to use the wastewater that has already been treated by the water sewerage plant. This 
irrigation water can be used for either external or internal landscaping.
In that case, a dedicated storage tank should be provided where the treated water 
is to be stored. It should be ensured that the treated irrigation water does not get 
mixed up with any other water supply line. Preferably, this tank should be 
underground.
The next step is to lay a network of pipelines throughout the green area of the 
hospital to supply irrigation water. Thereafter, taps and outlets should be provided 
at the required locations from where the hoses have to be connected for irrigation.

7.2.6 Sewerage Treatment Plant/Effuent Treatment Plant
Before being disposed of, hospital wastewater needs to be appropriately treated to 
prevent major environmental harm and the spread of infectious diseases to humans. 
Hospitals therefore should have an effuent treatment plant.
Wastewater generated from hospitals, generally, contains chemicals and biologi￾cal waste, including radioactive isotopes, heavy metals, dangerous bacteria and 
viruses, medications, hazardous compounds, etc. Wastewater is continuously pro￾duced by a hospital’s different departments, including pathology, emergency, oper￾ating rooms (ORs), intensive care unit (ICU), hot lab, radiology, laundry and 
kitchen, among others.
Before water is utilised again in a hospital or released into the environment, 
organic matter and suspended solids are removed from it using an effuent treatment 
plant (ETP/STP).
The frst step is to provide a prefabricated STP/ETP plant. If not, an STP/ETP 
plant needs to be constructed as per the drawings and specifcations provided by the 
engineer and the designer.
7.2.7 The Drinking Water Supply System
Generally, hospitals provide a separate water supply line for drinking water, ftted 
with taps and fountains. This drinking water should be free from any impurities and 
should have low parts per million (PPM) and total dissolved solids (TDS). Hence, 
in hospitals, the best method is to treat water through reverse osmosis (RO) 
technology.
The maximum number of contaminants are removed using this technology by 
passing water under pressure through a semi-permeable membrane. RO equipment 
include flters such as a pre-flter, sand flters, charcoal flters, reverse osmosis and 
ultraviolet (UV) fltration.
The frst step is to install an RO plant of adequate capacity. The raw water taken 
directly from the borewell or the storage tank should be supplied to the RO plant at 
its input point. Hence, the input of the RO should be connected to the source of the 
water supply.
Once the RO plant has been installed, an electrical connection should be pro￾vided to the RO plant for its operation from a dedicated distribution box with min￾iature circuit breakers (MCBs) of appropriate rating.
The plant should be commissioned and the output water tested for its chemical 
analysis and properties.
The water duly treated by the RO plant should be stored in a tank provided for 
this purpose. Ensuring that the tank is properly covered from all sides, to avoid any 
contamination, is a must.
7.2 Central Works of Water Supply and the Drainage System208
From this storage tank, a separate pipeline should be laid to carry the water to the 
desired location where the drinking water outlet is provided.
7.3 The Steam Supply System
See Table 7.3.
In a hospital, there are various locations where steam may be required like laun￾dry, food and beverages, laboratories, sterile store, CSSD, etc. As the usage of dif￾ferent units is different, the quality of steam to be supplied to a unit will depend on 
the application for which it will be used e.g. areas like laundry or food and bever￾ages may require ordinary plant steam, CSSD and critical areas will be provided 
with clean steam and sensitive areas like laboratories or pharmaceutical preparation 
may require pure and fltered steam.
To prepare for steam supply, the frst step is to provide the infrastructure for the 
production of steam. For this, a boiler should be provided. This boiler can be electri￾cally operated, which is also called an electrical steam generator. However, boilers 
with other means of fuel like diesel, wood, coal, gas or biogas are also available. 
Depending on the quantity and quality of the steam required, the boiler is planned 
and procured.
Central steam generation vs. local steam generation: For steam generation, 
hospitals have the option of establishing a central plant or localised plants at differ￾ent locations. Although setting up a central plant is more economical, it is not that

effcient. Second, if steam consumption is too low, then the operational cost of the 
central plant will be high. The next factor is the distance between the generation site 
and the user site. If the distance is more, then the cost of laying and maintaining the 
pipeline will be more. Another advantage with localised plants is that in case any 
one of the plants fails, the other systems will work to provide backup. However, 
some hospitals prefer to operate using a combination of both systems.
If the boiler is electrically operated, the power should be provided near the boiler 
through a separate panel and MCB. If fuels like diesel, wood, coal, etc. are used, 
then fuel storage space and tanks (if required) have to be provided.
A proper exhaust chimney should be provided along with the boiler to exhaust 
the smoke. The exhaust pipe should be placed in accordance with the strict rules, 
regulations and norms prescribed by the authorised agency of the government.
The boiler should be connected with the water input line, to fll up the water tank 
of the boiler.
The steam outlet of the boiler should be connected with the main steam supply 
line that will carry the steam to the desired location. Piping must be made out of 
stainless steel as it is a hard and non-reactive metal and can resist corrosion as well. 
The steam supply line should be adequately insulated to maintain the temperature in 
the pipeline. If the temperature of the steam falls, then it may be converted back 
to liquid.

Apart from all the above jobs, care should be taken to cover all the main holes 
with proper main hole covers to avoid any type of accident.
Similarly, all the openings of the STP and ETP tanks should be covered. A proper 
exhaust for easy disposal of the fumes and smell from the main holes should be 
provided.

HVAC (Air Conditioning) Works 
of the Hospital Building
The HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system in a hospital is nota￾bly more intricate compared to those in other commercial buildings. Its functional￾ity goes beyond providing thermal comfort and encompasses various crucial aspects 
unique to the hospital environment.
In hospitals, the HVAC system plays a vital role in maintaining comfortable cli￾matic conditions for patients and employees while also ensuring a germ-free and 
clean environment to prevent the spread of diseases. The sensitivity of medical 
equipment further emphasises the need for precise air control to ensure optimal 
performance. Consequently, designers must give special attention to these consider￾ations when designing HVAC systems for hospitals.
The complexity of HVAC system design in hospitals is compounded by the fact 
that different rooms serve different purposes. Clear defnition and classifcation of 
zones and spaces are necessary. For instance, isolation rooms may be required to 
separate patients with contagious diseases, while other rooms cater to immune￾compromised patients. Hospitals inherently harbour a higher concentration of 
microorganisms and pathogens compared to commercial buildings, and some of 
these contaminants can travel through the air. Spaces such as ICU units, neonatal 
units, and operating rooms require effective measures to limit the arrival and growth 
of pathogens. Therefore, the air conditioning system must be highly sensitive to 
flter and eliminate such contaminants, safeguarding patients, staff, and visitors.
Furthermore, the HVAC system should include comprehensive air fltration, par￾ticularly for the supply of external air, which is introduced to the system for fresh 
air circulation and exchanges. This practice helps prevent the growth, spread, and 
accumulation of micro-particles and pathogens, enhancing overall air quality within 
the hospital.
The enclosed checklist provides the sequence of such works related to HVAC 
(air conditioning) that has to be done inside the building and helps the site engineer 
to plan the start and end day of each activity along with the present status of that 
particular activity.212

8.2 Central Control Works of Air Conditioning 
(HVAC) System
See Table 8.2.
There are various systems that can be adopted for the air conditioning of the 
hospital. These are central water chilled plant where the central chillers chill the 
water, which then travels to the pipelines and air handling units; DX (direct expan￾sion) chilling, where instead of chilled water, the refrigerant (gas) circulates in the 
pipelines; and split air conditioning.
Out of all, the frst one, i.e., central water chilled plant, is used most of the time. 
However, if the hospital project is very small, other systems may be thought of.
Therefore, in this chapter, we will be discussing about the set of the central water 
chilled plant only.
In this kind of system, central chillers chill water, which is subsequently trans￾ported via insulated pipelines to the coils of air handling units (AHUs). Fans posi￾tioned behind the coils of an AHU blow air into the space. The air that is blown is 
cooled, and it travels through ducts to its destination before being distributed 
throughout the spaces using diffusers.
Calculating the plant’s necessary capacity is the frst stage in designing an air 
conditioning system. This calculation should be done based on the size of the spaces 
and the area’s specifc air conditioning needs. Not just the total of the separate sys￾tem loads, but also the simultaneous peak load, shall be taken into consideration by 
the designer. The capacity of the central cooling plant shall also take into account a

variety of variables, including the heat load of the machinery in the spaces, the num￾ber of people in the spaces, the heat load of the lighting, thermal loss from sunlight 
in the room, etc.
8.2.1 HVAC Plant Room
The frst step for the setup of the HVAC system is to construct the space where the 
plant of HVAC has to be installed. The chillers, pumps, valves, pipelines, and elec￾tric panels are the items that shall be installed in the plant room. The plant room 
shall be of adequate size to accommodate all the machinery items. Furthermore, the 
provision for further expansion of the plant room shall also be considered while 
designing the space.
The plant room should ideally be located away from the patient or clinical areas. 
For this, the building’s basements, roof, or outside space (in the main or annexure 
structure) can be taken into consideration.
It must be confrmed that the building’s structure can support the load of the 
HVAC equipment before deciding on the chiller’s location, weight, and other related 
equipment.
A minimum of two chillers shall always be provided so that they can alternately 
operate. If one chiller fails, the other can serve as a buffer as well. Typically, two 
chillers shall be placed during the initial phase; however, places shall be made avail￾able for future installation of more chillers at the same location in consideration of 
the expansion of air conditioning facilities.
Once the capacity has been designed, the spaces in the plant room shall be organ￾ised appropriately because the size of the chiller varies with its capacity. Places for 
supply pumps and chiller pumps shall be designated in the plant room next to the 
chiller. Similar to this, space shall be set aside for the pipelines carrying chilled 
water to AHUs and the water supply for chillers. In addition, there shall be enough 
room for equipment removal and maintenance.
If air-cooled chillers are planned, there shall be enough space for fresh air to 
circulate around the chillers. If the design provides for heating of the building, space 
shall be set aside in the plant room for the installation of a hot water generator that 
produces warm water to be circulated to the AHU for heating the air.
The make-up tank of water, which makes up the level of water to be used for 
cooling the chillers as well as chilling the water, shall also be installed in the plant 
room. The electrical panel and major switches that deliver electricity to the system 
must also have space.
Once the spaces have been identifed for installation of the machinery in the plant 
room, the next step is to prepare the foundations for the chillers, pumps, electric 
panels, etc. The foundations shall preferably be separate for each machine. Before 
designing the foundations, the details and drawings of the foundations shall be 
taken from the original manufacturer of the machines. The foundation bolts shall be 
8 HVAC (Air Conditioning) Works of the Hospital Building219
properly provided in the foundation to securely fasten the machines on the 
foundations.
Now is the time to install the chillers, pumps, and electric panels on the founda￾tions. Depending on the design and recommendations of the manufacturers of the 
machines, the machines shall be mounted on a base plate only with desired mount￾ing anchor fasteners. As the vibration of the machines such as chillers is tremen￾dous, it is recommended that vibration pads shall be used.
Once the chillers are installed, the chilled water supply line and the chilled water 
return line shall be connected to the chiller. These lines are to carry and return the 
chilled water into the chiller.
Apart from this, the incoming and outgoing water lines shall be connected 
between the cooling tower and the chiller. These pipe lines are for cooling the 
chillers.
All the pipelines connected to the chillers shall be routed through the deliver 
pumps. For each line, two pumps are provided: one as a working pump and the other 
as a standby pump.
The isolation valves and other pipe fttings are also installed as per the drawings 
and specifcations. The chilled water lines are then insulated as specifed to maintain 
the temperature of the water inside the pipelines.
Proper raw water supply pipelines shall be provided to connect the raw water 
supply line to chillers, make-up tank, and cooling towers. In case the raw water, that 
has to be supplied to the plant, is hard, plan for providing the water softening plant. 
The raw water shall be treated with this plant before supply to the chillers, cooling 
towers, and the make-up tank. This will increase the life of the HVAC plant.
Then is the time to connect the chillers and the pumps to the electric supply. For 
the HVAC plant room, a separate electric panel shall be designed. For every machine, 
separate MCBs and switches of adequate capacity shall be provided. The pumps 
and chillers shall then be connected to the panel and are energised to be operated.
As soon as the plant room is ready to operate, switch on the chillers and pumps 
and test the performance of the plant. Now leave the plant till the entire HVAC sys￾tem is in place.
8.2.2 Cooling Towers
When the chillers are turned on, they generate a lot of heat, and as a result, the chill￾ers’ body also heats up. To keep the body of the chiller cold, the chillers are pro￾vided with a jacket wherein the water circulates. As the water circulates, the water 
also gets heated. Hence, the water is required to be cooled before being recirculated 
in the body of the chillers. This task is accomplished through the use of cooling 
towers. The cooling towers are factory-fabricated and tested, and they shall be 
induced draft type with counter-fow. The cooling tower’s structure and basin shall 
be made of stainless steel 304 grade, with FRP removable louvres. The cooling tow￾ers shall include a basin cleaning system.
8.2 Central Control Works of Air Conditioning (HVAC) System220
For the installation of a pair of cooling towers, open space shall be allotted either 
on the rooftop or in an area open to the sky. In the identifed area, the foundations 
for the cooling tower shall be constructed according to the design and specifcations 
received from the original manufacturer of the cooling tower. Once the foundations 
are ready, cooling towers shall be assembled and installed.
In the mean construct the foundations for installation of the tower pumps. Now 
install the tower pumps that will supply the water to the cooling tower. The tower 
pumps shall now be connected to the cooling tower.
For receiving and supplying water to the chillers, the tower pumps shall be con￾nected to the water pipelines. Also, to draw water from the make-up tank, for the 
cooling tower, a water pipeline shall be provided between the cooling tower and the 
make-up tank.
Once all the installations of the cooling tower and the pumps are over, connect 
the tower pumps and the cooling tower to the power supply to energise them. For 
every pump and cooling tower, separate MCBs and switches of adequate capacity 
shall be provided.
Start and test the working and performance of the cooling tower and the 
tower pumps.
8.2.3 Air Handling Units/Fan Coil Units
The air handling unit (AHU) or fan coil unit (FCU) is a box-like structure that takes 
in air, cools/warms it to the desired temperature, and sends it to the diffuser for 
distribution in the designated spaces. The AHU shall have provisions for drawing 
fresh air from the surrounding environment. The amount of air to be taken can be 
controlled by the damper installed in the AHU. In terms of fan coil units, these are 
typically installed in smaller rooms and serve as the AHU for that room only.
The AHU shall be installed closer to the area where cool air is required. A sepa￾rate room, preferably, shall be provided for the installation of the AHUs, with open￾ings for installing the air ducts and an opening for taking fresh air from the 
atmosphere. Alternatively, if the foor height permits and the ceiling have suffcient 
load-bearing capacity, ceiling-suspended AHUs shall be installed, which are sus￾pended from the ceiling using screw rods and fasteners.
Fan coil units are suspended from the ceiling at any convenient location in the 
room, preferably at the room’s entrance.
Each AHU shall be installed as a stand-alone unit with no interface to another 
AHU. AHUs shall not be stacked vertically.
Service access doors of the AHUs shall always open inside the AHU, i.e., on the 
door’s positive side. Internal parts of the AHU shall not obstruct the opening, and 
these doors shall be equipped with micro switches or safety switch interlocks to 
protect maintenance personnel from potential injuries.
8 HVAC (Air Conditioning) Works of the Hospital Building221
Once the AHU has been installed, the same shall be connected to the air supply 
duct. The duct and AHU are connected to each other by providing the collar made 
out of the canvas sheet.
Clean and install all the recommended and designed flters in AHUs. All AHUs 
must have a frst-stage fltration rating of at least MERV 8/ePM10 60%. Similarly, 
a fnal flter with a MERV 14/ePM1 70% rating shall be installed downstream of all 
wet air cooling coils and supply fans. Filters such as pre-flters, sand flters, micro 
V flters, and HEPA flters shall be used in the HVAC system where the design 
calls for it.
On the back end of the AHU is an opening for the intake of the return air shall be 
provided. This return air is again cooled in the AHU and after fltration is blown off 
in the space duly mixed up with the fresh air component. The AHU shall also be 
linked to the return air duct, or a return air vent shall be installed in the AHU to col￾lect returning air from the spaces.
For the intake of fresh air through the damper provided in the AHU, provide an 
opening in the wall from where the fresh air is taken by the AHU. In case the outer 
wall is not available near the AHU, provide the duct connecting the AHU and the 
opening on the outside wall. Please remember to provide the recommended flter 
between the AHU and the opening for fresh air so that fresh air can be fltered before 
entering the AHU.
AHU also has flters, such as pre-flters and micro V flters, installed in the air 
return pathway to flter the air before it is sent out. If necessary, ultraviolet (UV-C) 
disinfection shall be used to inactivate the microorganisms. To avoid fungal ampli￾fcation, UV-C is recommended for cooling coil surfaces. To reduce virus spread, 
upper air UV for patient rooms in critical care or isolation rooms shall be provided.
Connect the AHU/FCU to the necessary electrical power supply points to power 
it up. The use of variable frequency drives (VFDs) for AHUs is encouraged. VFDs 
shall be designed and confgured in such a way that if one fails, it does not disable 
the entire unit. A bypass switch can also be used for this.
Once everything is in place, switch on the AHU/FCU and check the working and 
performance.
8.2.4 Ducting
Cool air must be transported to the terminal point via ducts. The ducts are also 
sometimes utilised for sending the return air to the AHUs. Depending on the layout 
and availability of the spaces above the false ceiling, the duct shall be provided 
which can be rectangular, square, or round in shape.
Most ducts are constructed of galvanised steel. The duct is manufactured from 
aluminium for particular specifc areas, such as operating rooms. The anti-microbial 
coating must be applied to the interior surface of the ducts once they are ready. The 
exterior of the duct must be insulated, preferably with an adhesive-applied 
nitrile sheet.
8.2 Central Control Works of Air Conditioning (HVAC) System222
Once the ducts are ready to be installed, the marking on the ceiling shall be done. 
Now fx the screw rods and the hangers to suspend the duct from the ceiling. Place 
the duct on the hangers. Connect the ducts to each other.
The supply duct is connected to the AHU on one side and terminates at the VAV 
or the grills/dampers/diffusers on the other. The return duct is similarly connected 
to the grills and terminates by connecting to the AHU.
Provide the cut-outs in the duct, as per the drawings, and make the collar at the 
cut-out. Fix the grills, dampers, and diffusers as per the drawings.
Once the duct is in place and is connected to the AHU, switch on the AHU to 
blow air into the duct. This is required to clean the duct and make it free from any 
dust, insects, foreign particles, etc.
8.2.5 Grills, Diffusers, and Registers
Grills: The grill’s main purpose is to provide cover on the duct’s cut-out and allow 
air to enter and exit the room via it. Grills often do not have any moving parts or 
dampers, making them one of the simplest devices to maintain. However, it will not 
work if the airfow direction or the volume of air coming in and going out needs to 
be changed.
Registers: A grill-like device known as an air register has adjustable dampers 
inside of it. A register simply releases air, as opposed to grills, which are utilised for 
both air intake and air exhaust in a space. The dampers aid in directing airfow or 
stopping it altogether.
Diffusers: The airfow direction variability is different with a diffuser. Instead of 
the single air direction of a register, a diffuser and its dampers are constructed facing 
all directions.
The grills, diffusers, and registers are generally tailor-made as per the drawings 
and the specifcations. The sizes depend on the cut-outs provided in the duct. So, the 
frst step is to get the grills, diffusers, and registers fabricated.
Once ready, the grills, diffusers, and registers shall be placed at the specifc cut￾out of the duct. Screw it properly so that it does not fall or vibrate due to the high 
velocity of the air coming out of the grills, diffusers, and registers.
8.2.6 Electrical Control
The whole of the HVAC system is highly dependent on the electric supply. Hence, 
a proper set is required to be provided for the supply of good quality and uninter￾rupted power to the HVAC system. Hence, a separate LT panel shall be designed for 
the HVAC system.
The connections to this HVAC panel from the main hospital panel shall be done 
with the help of LT Armored XLPE, aluminium cables, or a Rising Main Bus-bar.
8 HVAC (Air Conditioning) Works of the Hospital Building223
The power supply from the HVAC panel shall be terminated at the lighting dis￾tribution board (LDB)/power distribution boards (PDB) installed at various loca￾tions throughout the HVAC plant room. It shall have both incoming MCBs and 
outgoing MCBs. The MCB rating shall be designed in accordance with the load 
factor on a specifc MCB.
The underground LT copper cable distributes power from the MCBs to various 
machines in the HVAC system. If necessary, cable trays can be used instead of going 
underground.
As far as the power connections of the AHUs are concerned, the same can be 
supplied from the individual foor electric panel. However, the supply to the AHU 
shall be from a dedicated MCB that shall be nearer to the location of the AHU.
Energise the HVAC panel and commission the panel. Test run all the machines of 
the HVAC plant.
8.2.7 Testing and Commissioning
Now as we are ready with the erection and installation of the HVAC plant, it is time 
to test and commission the plant. As the frst step, thoroughly test all the pipelines 
at high pressure. This testing is required to trace out leakages in the system so that 
remedial action can be taken. The pressure shall be at least double the actual pres￾sure that the line is exposed to. For pressure testing, double pressure shall be retained 
in the pipeline for at least 24 h. During this time, the fall in the pressure shall be 
monitored. If there is no fall in pressure, it means the system is ft to operate. In case 
the pressure falls, it indicates any leakage in the system. Trace out the leakage and 
rectify it. Again, go for the pressure testing. This exercise shall be repeated till there 
is the stability of the pressure in the pipeline.
Once the pressure run is conducted and found to be perfect for operations, switch 
on the entire HVAC system. Check for any leakages, vibrations, the fow of the air, 
cooling of the air, movement of the dampers, noise in the system, humidity levels 
and operation of the pumps, etc.
This is the stage where the commissioning of the plant is complete. Now run the 
entire plant for at least 24 h at full load to clean the entire pipeline and the ducts. The 
purpose is to make the system free from any kind of dust particles, foreign bodies, 
or insects in the system.

Fire Safety Works of the Hospital Building
Fire safety, protection, and detection regulations are established by the legislation of 
individual countries or states, which develop their own specifc rules and regula￾tions to manage fre safety. These regulations vary depending on the jurisdiction. In 
addition, there are universally accepted codes and standards set by organisations, 
such as the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), which have international 
recognition.
Similarly, in India, the “National Building Code of India 2016” has been imple￾mented and includes a comprehensive set of rules pertaining to fre safety, protec￾tion, and detection. While it is not feasible to discuss the regulations of all countries 
in detail, we will focus on providing an overview of the “National Building Code of 
India 2016” in this chapter.
It is important to note that the content presented in this chapter is a sum￾mary of the “National Building Code of India 2016” and is not intended to be 
considered as plagiarism. The purpose is to provide a general understanding of 
the code and its guidelines.

For sprinklers, the network of lines of various diameters (as per drawings) is laid 
down in the entire building. Before installation, please take care of the rules, regula￾tions, and guidelines of the country’s fre-controlling authorities and norms. Install 
the sprinklers as per the drawings. All these individual pipelines are connected to 
the main riser foorwise. The main riser is in turn connected to the main water sup￾ply line connected to the pump room.
For the hydrant system, the outlets are given in the main riser for connecting the 
hose pipe and the lay-fat fre canvas hose. The hydrant valves shall be provided, and 
the nozzles shall also be made available. The hydrant riser shall in turn be connected 
to the main water supply line connected to the pump room.
For the downcomer riser, the pipeline is laid from the roof and shall be termi￾nated to the lowest foor of the building. On the roof, the pipeline is connected to the 
main water supply pump which is in turn connected to the fre water tanks installed 
on the roof top. On the downcomer riser pipe, the hydrant valves shall be provided 
separately on each foor to connect the lay-fat fre canvas hose.
For the fre detection system, the network of the smoke detection system shall be 
provided. First, the cable is laid down by adopting the loop system. Loop means the 
wire starts from the central fre detection control panel, and terminates at the same 
control panel, hence creating a loop. In each loop, the smoke or heat detectors are 
installed so that the control panel is in regular communication with the smoke/heat 
detectors. Along with the smoke/heat detectors, the MCB and the hooters are also 
installed in the line.
Similarly, each loop is connected to the control panel, and after installation of the 
central control panel, the system is commissioned and tested.
The next step is installing the fre doors on all the fre exits. The doors shall be 
installed as per the drawings and designs.
For smoke suppression, all the staircases lift shafts, ramps, and lift lobbies shall 
be pressurised. For doing this, the tube axial fans are installed on the roof top and 
the duct is laid down from top to bottom with the opening on stairs, ramps, and lift 
lobbies on all the foors. Suitable diffusers or grills shall be provided for these 
openings.
Note: Please note that all the above activities of various services have to be car￾ried out for all the foors of the building

9.2.1 Fire Pump Room
Fire hydrant system is a set-up to supply the water inside and outside the building 
so that in case of fre the water can be poured on the fre to suppress the fre. This 
system is essentially a water supply system that delivers suffcient pressure and 
fows through pipes throughout a building to a strategically located network of 
valves for frefghting purposes.
The system starts from the fre pumps installed in the pump room and ends at the 
hydrant provided in the building.
The entire fre hydrant system consists of the following components:
1. Water supply and storage facility
2. Pipework and valves
3. Fire pump sets
4. Hydrant or landing valve and coupling
5. Fire brigade booster inlets
6. First-aid hose reels and lay fat fre hose
9 Fire Safety Works of the Hospital Building233
Let us start with the water supply and the storage of water for fre.
The fre water supply tank is the only source of water used in fghting fres, and 
it must always be accessible in the form of an underground static storage tank with 
a capacity determined in accordance with the standards established by the govern￾ment of the country in which the frefghting system has to be installed.
The tank shall have provisions for replenishing the water from the primary water 
supply, such as a bore well, etc. The necessary amount’s static water storage tank 
must be provided underground and constructed of reinforced concrete. The tank’s 
size and water-holding capacity shall determine the thickness of the tank’s walls. 
The local fre service’s fre tenders must have easy access to this tank. If it is antici￾pated that fre tenders will land on the fre tank, the slab thickness must be such that 
it can support the weight of the fre tender.
The household water supply tank must only be fed through an overfow arrange￾ment from the fre tank to maintain the level at the minimum stipulated capacity to 
prevent water in the static tank from becoming stagnant.
The static water storage tank shall have at least four 63-mm diameter instanta￾neous male inlets and outlets arranged in a valve box with an appropriate fxed pipe 
with a minimum diameter of 150 mm to discharge water into the tank.
Now the pump room, the most important part of the complete frefghting system 
is the frefghting pump room since it contains the equipment that will protect the 
building from fre and needs a suitable location for maintenance and operation.
The fre pump room shall be placed ideally outside the main building, at least 
6 m away from neighbouring buildings. The pump rooms shall generally have brick 
or concrete walls, a non-combustible ceiling, and suitable drainage, lighting, and 
ventilation systems.
If the pump house is inside, the building, whether on the ground foor or in the 
basement, needs to be separated from the rest of the building by a wall with a 2-h 
fre rating and have a fre check door installed at the entry. The fre door shall be 
rated for 1  h. Forced mechanical ventilation ought to be provided for the pump 
house in the basement. The pump house on the ground level shall be situated outside 
the building with easy access from a public space. The basement pump house needs 
to be easily accessible from the outside, preferably via ramp.
Depending on the space available, drawings, calculations, and data sheet, the 
pump house may be built above or below the level of the water tank. A pump house 
with pumps underneath the water tank is ideal for frefghting since it avoids the 
need for a negative suction system with a priming tank, foot valve, various auxiliary 
valves, etc.
The pump house shall have windows with extended metal guards for safety and 
suffcient natural ventilation. There shall be a mild steel girder available in the pump 
house at an appropriate height for fxing the chain pulley block to assist in the 
proper installation and maintenance of frefghting pumps.
To drain away any water seeping from glands, valves, etc., the pump house foor 
shall be slanted towards the farthest end.
Normal lighting and emergency lighting shall be available in the pump house 
from either a backup source or the generator.
9.2 Control Station of Firefghting and Detection System234
The pump house shall have enough space to accommodate all of the pumps, 
along with their supply pipes, fttings, starter control panel, air vessel, etc., and have 
enough room for circulation. It shall be capable of maintaining the pump with 
enough headroom all around it. For all pump houses, the headroom clearance shall 
be at least 2.75 m.
The pump control panel, which shall also be located in the pump room but shall be 
easily accessible, shall be large enough to include a triple pole and neutral (TPN) 
switch and a high rupture capacity (HRC) switch, both of which have adequate capac￾ities. Apart from this there shall be a space in the panel to install a selector switch, a 
voltmeter, an ammeter, phase indicating lights, start and stop push buttons, a single￾phase preventer, an auto-manual switch, and auxiliary contractors for interlocking/
sequence of (the busbar shall be made out of copper of appropriate thickness). The 
panel shall be separated and foor mounted, with suffcient grouting on the foor.
Where a diesel pump is provided, it shall have its own panel, which shall be situ￾ated in the same room as the pump or in a nearby separate room. The panel needs to 
have a separate battery, a battery charging system, and an auto-manual switchover 
set-up. To prevent the diesel pump and the electric pump from operating at the same 
time, it shall have an interlocking mechanism with the main pump panel. To prevent 
any fre emergency, adequate precautions shall be taken to prevent fuel spills.
Installing an air vessel with suffcient capacity and adding pressure switches to 
the delivery line shall be done. Two pressure switches are required. One has an 
upper and lower restriction for the jockey pump, whereas the main pump simply has 
a lower pressure limit on the other. Only a manual push button that is clearly marked 
on the pump panel shall be used to stop the main pumps.
To start the diesel pump automatically at a pre-set reduction in pressure, a similar 
lower pressure limit switch shall be added.
Pumps shall be mounted on a concrete foundation with a minimum grade of M15 
reinforced concrete in the initial stage of installation. Depending on the size of the 
pump, the foundation’s thickness shall range from 50 mm to 150 mm. The founda￾tion shall be large enough to accommodate the pump’s entire length and width, as 
well as at least 150 mm on each side and 75 mm on the sidewalls for clearance. The 
baseplate shall be long and wide enough to comfortably house the pump and motor.
Once the foundations with the baseplates are ready, next is to install two numbers 
of main pumps and two numbers of jockey pumps. Along with this one diesel engine 
pump along with the fuel tank and for discharging the exhaust, an exhaust pipe shall 
be provided which shall be extended to outside the pump house and terminate at an 
appropriate height in the open air.
The fre pump’s capacity shall be carefully selected to fulfl the standard for risk 
protection. All pumps shall have the option to “Auto Start” if the main hydrant sup￾ply line encounters a pressure drop.
Between each pump and the non-return valve on the delivery side, place pres￾sure gauges.
The electric supply to the pump set(s) shall be independent of any other equip￾ment in the space; in other words, it shall remain operational even if the power is 
turned off across the entire space. The connection for the pump(s) can be taken from 
the incoming side of the main L.T. breaker to achieve this. However, the connection 
9 Fire Safety Works of the Hospital Building235
may be made through the busbars in cases where two or more transformers and/or 
other supply sources are connected to a single busbar or if a bus coupler is provided 
between the busbar sections.
Once the pumps are installed, connect the pumps with the outlet of the water 
storage tank to the inlet of the fre pumps. Proper sluice valves shall be provided at 
a suitable place so that if required the water supply to the pumps can be stopped. 
Then, the outlet of the pumps shall be connected to the main hydrant line from 
where the water shall be supplied to the entire hydrant line.
Connect the pumps to the electrical panel and energise the pumps.
Switch on the pumps and test the pumps and mainline under high pressure. If no 
leakage is noticed, the pump house is ready to operate. Please also test that the 
pumps are running on auto mode so that the pumps automatically start as the water 
pressure in the main line falls down and is automatically switched off when the 
pressure reaches the set pressure.
9.2.2 Fire Hydrant System
The purpose of a fre hydrant system is to provide water for the fremen to fght a 
fre. It comprises of a system of pipework that is directly connected to the water 
supply main at every hydrant outlet. The water is pumped into the fre hydrant, and 
the fre tender withdraws the water from the hydrant and flls up the fre tender to 
spray onto the fre.
The fre hydrant system is basically a network of pipelines, which starts from the 
fre pumps and terminates at the hydrants provided around the entire building. The 
hydrants are also called yard hydrants. It is the yard hydrant, which is responsible to 
supply water to the fre tender, in case of fre, so the fre tender takes water from the 
yard hydrant and sprays it at the spot of fre.
For the hydrant system, the main header line is laid down from the outlet of the 
fre pump. Depending on the hydrants to be provided around the building, the diam￾eter of the main header line is determined.
In the meantime, a network of pipelines is created around the entire building to 
provide yard hydrants. This pipeline shall then be connected to the main hydrant 
line to supply water to the hydrant line. Water after fowing via a lay-fat fre hose to 
a nozzle, water from the hydrant is then directed towards the fre.
At the appropriate place of the hydrant line, the hydrants are provided. Along 
with the hydrant, the fat-lay fre hose shall be provided. Also, the brass nozzle is 
kept beside the lay-fat fre hose. This nozzle is connected to the lay-fat hose, and 
after opening the valve of the hydrant, the water can be sprayed on the fre.
A fre hydrant system is built to guarantee that there is enough water pressure and 
fow at the most of hydrant sites that are accessible. A fre hydrant system normally 
contains pressurised water that is ready for use in an emergency. The system’s water 
pressure decreases when a hydrant valve is opened. An electromechanical device 
that detects a decline in water pressure activates the booster pump or pumps, which 
pull water from the water supply to raise the system’s water pressure.
9.2 Control Station of Firefghting and Detection System236
9.2.3 Wet Riser
To supply water within a building for frefghting purposes, wet risers are used. 
Tall buildings shall have wet rising mains installed because it takes a lot of 
pressure to pump water up to those heights. A wet riser is a component of a 
building’s frefghting systems that supplies water to various foors or 
compartments.
The main vertical pipes of a wet rising system include landing valves on each 
foor of the building. The fre pumps located in the fre pump room are used to link 
the pipe system to a permanent water supply, which is often from the fre storage 
tank. This water is supplied to the pipe system by two automatic pumps: one on duty 
and one on standby. Wet risers have a constant water charge. Wet risers have landing 
valves at specifc positions on each foor.
At all the locations on each foor where the hydrant is provided on the wet riser, 
a set of landing valves, hose reel, hose, branch pipe, and lay-fat fre hose ftted with 
nozzle shall also be provided.
Once the wet riser has been installed, the wet riser from the ground foor shall be 
connected to the main hydrant line that in turn shall be connected to the fre pumps 
placed in the fre pump room.
As far as the specifcation of the wet riser is concerned, the same shall depend on 
the specifcations, as provided by the government of the respected country. Similarly, 
the distance of one hydrant to other shall also depend on the specifcations, as pro￾vided by the government of the respected country. Hence, while designing the wet 
riser system, the rules, regulations, norms, and specifcations of the respective coun￾try shall be checked.
9.2.4 Downcomer
Downcomer system is also a form of an internal hydrant for the fremen to use and 
is always charged with water tanks located at the top of a building.
The frst step is to prepare the roof of the hospital building for the installation of 
tanks. The fact is that at least 20,000 L of water shall always be available in the roof 
tanks for the downcomer hydrant. For accommodating 20,000 L of water, it can 
either be in one tank or be divided into more than one tank. Usually, 4 tanks of 
5000 L each shall be planned. Consider the tremendous weight of 20,000 L of water 
and the weight of tanks that the roof has to bear. Hence, it can be dangerous to place 
the tank directly on the roof.
The remedy is to raise the four adjoining existing columns of the building to 
make a square or rectangular shape. Install the iron girder on all the columns, and 
connect each of the raised columns. On the girders, place the iron platform for the 
installation of the tank. By this exercise, the entire weight of the water and the tanks 
9 Fire Safety Works of the Hospital Building237
are directly transferred to the columns of the building, leaving no weight on the roof 
directly.
Install the tanks on the platform made for this purpose. As per the norms relating 
to the downcomer, the monoblock pumps shall be provided at the outlet of the fre 
tanks. Hence, the pump needs to be placed on the roof. The inlet of this pump is 
connected to the outlet valve of the fre tanks. Hence, construct the foundation for 
the pump. Install the pump on the foundation. To save the pump from the rains, 
provide a covering all around the pump.
Connect the outlet of the pump with the downcomer pipeline. Connect the pump 
with the electric connection. The pump shall have a provision to switch on auto￾matically as soon as the pressure in the downcomer falls and switched off as soon as 
the pressure reaches the set level.
The next step is to connect all the fre tanks to each other so that all the tanks can 
be used simultaneously. Provide the pipeline from the source water to the fre tank 
to fll up the tank. Please ensure the pipeline from the water source shall be directly 
connected to the fre tank, and the overfow from the fre tanks shall be diverted to 
the other domestic tanks installed on the roof. With this exercise, water shall always 
be available in fre tanks in case of emergency and there shall be no stagnation of the 
water in the fre tanks.
The downcomer shall have an opening on each foor of the building. The hydrant 
valve shall be connected at this opening. Provide the frebox near the downcomer to 
place lay fat fre hose, and nozzle, so that in case of fre the same can be connected 
and used to suppress the fre.
Fill up the fre tanks and switch on the fre pump installed with the fre tank. 
Check the pressure of water in the downcomer on each foor. Check for any leakages 
in the downcomer. If any leakage is found, set it right and make the system ready 
for use.
9.2.5 Fire Detection System (Smoke/Heat Detectors)
Fire detection systems are designed to detect fres early in their spread when resi￾dents still have time to escape safely. Early detection improves the safety of those 
who respond to emergencies. Early detection helps prevent life and property loss 
and operational downtime because control efforts are initiated while the fre is still 
small. The majority of alarm systems alert emergency personnel to the location of 
the fre, which speeds up the frefghting process.
To be effective, detectors shall be used in conjunction with alarms. Alarm sys￾tems, at the very least time, notify the building’s occupants and typically send a 
signal to a manned monitoring station, either on-site or remote.
There are various types of fre alarm systems in the market such as:
1. Non-addressable fre alarm system (conventional)
2. Analogue addressable fre alarm system
9.2 Control Station of Firefghting and Detection System238
3. Radio fre alarm system (wireless)
4. Radio and analogue fre hybrid alarm system
5. Aspirating smoke detection systems
6. Fire suppression systems
7. OSID (Open Space Image Detector Systems)
8. Public address and voice alarm systems
Out of all, the frst two are important and mostly used for the fre detection 
system. Let us understand these.
Non-Addressable Fire Alarm System (Conventional): The smoke detec￾tors in a non-addressable system function as switches. They “Turn On” the panel 
when they are activated, which then “Turns On” the bells or sounders. These 
detectors at a specifc location are wired to a single circuit, known as a zone so 
that when a zone is activated, an indicator on the control panel shall light up to 
indicate which zone it is. Typically, each sounder circuit is wired separately. In 
small hospitals, non-addressable technologies are very useful and preferred. The 
sounders are located on the zone circuits in a newer form. The term “Two Wires” 
is used to describe these systems. Where there are many devices close to one 
another, two-wire systems are especially helpful.
Analogue Addressable Fire Alarm System: All smoke detectors in this kind 
of system are connected via ring circuits known as “loops.” The control panels 
and detectors communicate electronically. The smoke detectors’ devices send 
back their “analogue value” continually (information). The analogue value for a 
smoke detector corresponds to both the air temperature surrounding the device 
and the amount of smoke present. The “Intelligent” controls are capable of deter￾mining when a device has reached its “alarm” value. Some or all of the output 
devices may need to follow instructions from the controllers. The controls can be 
“Programmed” to operate specifc outputs based on the status of the smoke 
detectors. Larger hospitals can beneft from these solutions.
The frst step towards the installation of the smoke detection system is to 
mark the locations in the building where the smoke and heat detectors are to be 
installed. Identify and number the loop. Defne the route of the cable in that par￾ticular loop.
Now start the laying of the cable. The cable shall be laid on the wall just near 
the ceiling. The cable shall be properly clipped on the wall if it has to be exposed. 
Alternatively, the cable can also be concealed in the wall by providing the cable 
conduit. The other option is to lay the cable above the false ceiling. In that case, 
the cable shall be laid in the cable conduit and tied to the frame of the false ceil￾ing above the ceiling. At each location where the smoke or heat detector has to 
be installed, cut the cable, and connect it to the base of the detector. As it is a 
loop, both ends of the loop cable shall be terminated at the location where the fre 
control panel has to be installed because ultimately both ends of this loop cable 
shall be connected to the control panel to complete the circuit of the loop.
Along with the laying of the cable, the hooters and the MCPs shall also be 
fxed in the loop and installed on the wall. Now fx the smoke detectors and the 
heat detectors in the base frame of the detector.
9 Fire Safety Works of the Hospital Building239
The next step is to install the control panel for the fre detection system. All 
the cables of the loops shall be connected to the control panel. Supply power to 
the control panel having a power backup with the help of UPS. The electric sup￾ply to the control panel shall be made from a specially designed independent 
electric panel. This panel shall be fully automated and shall be continuously 
communicating with the control panel. Once the control panel receives the signal 
of any fre, the control panel gives a command to the electric panel to switch on 
the pressurisation fans and the smoke extraction system automatically. Similarly, 
once the temperature rises above 57°C, the heat detector shall send a signal to the 
alarm panel and trigger the alarm.
Switch on the power and check the control panel. Also, check all the loops 
connected to the control panel. Ensure that the panel detects all the detectors 
installed within a particular loop. If not, check the entire loop to detect the fault 
and set it right.
Once the panel is fully operative, programme the control panel and allot a 
unique ID to each detector. The complete list of all the detectors with their ID, 
location, and the room numbers where it is installed is fed into the control panel. 
In case of fre, the detector that has detected fre shall get activated and send 
signals to the control panel. The control panel shall command the hooter of that 
area to start beeping. The ID of the activated detector shall be displayed on the 
control panel, and the freman shall immediately come to know where the fre 
has been detected.
Test the entire fre detection system along with all the smoke and heat 
detectors.
9.2.6 Smoke Extraction System
The smoke extraction and ventilation systems are designed to effectively remove 
smoke from the areas affected by fre and, at the same time, proportionally supple￾ment the system’s output with external compensating air. This system is particularly 
important for the maintenance of the fre safety of buildings, basements, escape 
routes, staircases, etc. The smoke exhaust system is provided for the prevention of 
smoke spreading in case of fre, prevention of fumigation of evacuation corridors, 
sealing the smoke to spread in the areas not affected by fre, and saving the health 
and lives of occupants.
There are two types of smoke extraction and ventilation systems, which are static 
or dynamic.
In the static system, all fans in case of fre are stopped immediately. Why, the 
basic principle is that when there is no oxygen, there shall be no possibility of fre 
spreading further. This system is very basic and crude and is used only in a small 
set-up where the possibility of fre is less, and there are no other additional hazard￾ous factors.
9.2 Control Station of Firefghting and Detection System240
In the dynamic system, on the one hand, the smoke and heat are exhausted and 
simultaneously the fresh air from outside is inducted into the space, hence creating 
areas of excessive air pressure, functioning as smoke barriers.
The frst step for installation of the smoke extraction system is the fabrication of 
the smoke extraction ducts, pipes, and chimney. The fabrication shall be done as per 
the drawings and the specifcations provided by the engineers. Once the ducts, 
pipes, and chimneys are ready, they have to be mounted on the walls or suspended 
from the ceiling as per the drawings. Please remember that all the pipes, ducts, and 
chimneys are properly insulated by the material as per the fre norms of the state or 
country where it has to be installed. Apart from the main duct and pipe, the branches 
shall also be fabricated and installed so that all the zones of the area are fully cov￾ered with the smoke extraction system.
All the smoke ducts and pipes shall lead towards the smoke shaft which in turn 
shall terminate at the top of the building above the roof level. At the termination 
point of the smoke shaft, an exhaust fan shall be installed. Fans shall be mounted 
directly at the exit of the smoke mines. Above the fan, there is a small section of the 
shaft that leads to the sunroof.
Next are the ducts and pipes for the intake of the fresh air. These ducts and pipes 
shall be installed parallel to the exhaust ducts and pipes. The air vents shall be 
opened in the walls of the building and air dampers are provided. It is better if the 
dampers are automated. If automated, as soon as the exhaust starts, the intake air 
dampers are activated and opened to intake the fresh air.
Once the fabrication of the air induction ducting and piping is completed, the 
same shall be fxed on the wall or hung from the ceiling, just similar to the exhaust 
ducts and pipes. After installation, provide the air induction fans to suck air from 
outside and blow it off in the spaces of the building.
Both the exhaust and air induction fans shall be connected to the electrical panel 
to provide power for the fans to operate. Similarly, the dampers, if automated, shall 
also be provided with the electrical supply. The supply shall be in three phases, and 
the cables to be used shall be fre rated and non-combustible. To avoid the short￾circuiting and burning of the cables, please ensure that the cables shall not come 
into contact with the heating parts of the ducts, pipes, and chimney.
The fnal step is to automate the entire smoke extraction system. To do so, the 
electric supply to the smoke extraction system and the dampers shall be given from 
the fre control panel that is being used for the control panel of the smoke detection 
system. The purpose is that in case there is a fre in any particular zone of the hos￾pital, the smoke detectors shall communicate with the control panel. Once commu￾nicated to the control panel, the control panel shall communicate with the electrical 
panel, and in turn, the electrical panel shall activate the fans and dampers of the 
smoke extraction to start.
Once switched on, the fans and dampers shall start functioning and extract the 
smoke from the building and also provide fresh air intake. Test the entire smoke 
extraction system, and if found to be working properly, approve and certify it.

9.2.7 Automatic Sprinkler System
Installation of the sprinklers inside the building has already been mentioned in 
Chap. 5 of this book.
Once all the branches of the sprinkler pipeline in the building are connected to 
the main supply line of the building, the main supply line is in turn connected to the 
main water supply line that leads to the pump room.
The main water supply line is now connected to the fre pumps installed in the 
fre pump room.
Nowadays, the sprinkler system can also be automated through the fre control 
panel. For automation, the installation control valve is provided. In this case, as 
soon as the fre control panel activates the fre alarm, the control valve opens the 
valve of the sprinkler water supply line of that particular zone and the sprinklers 
start functioning.
Test the entire sprinkler system for any leakages, and if found OK, give approval 
for use.
9.2.8 Pressurisation of the Lift Wells, Stair Cases, 
and Lift Lobbies
During a fre, the smoke is more fatal than the fre itself. If people are escaping 
through the staircase, it has to be ensured that the smoke shall not enter the staircase 
and slow down the evacuation.
Furthermore, for frefghters to safely and effectively use the service lift, it has to 
be ensured that the smoke shall not enter the lift lobby as well.
Therefore, the staircase and lift lobby shall be pressurised.
The pressurisation system draws outside air and pressurises the staircase to pre￾vent the smoke from fowing in. To pressurise a staircase, all staircase doors shall 
have an automatic door closer (mechanical type).
For pressurisation of the staircases and the lift lobbies, frst of all, the vertical 
ducts, called pressurisation ducts, are installed starting from the roof itself. The top 
end of the duct is for fxing the fans. The ducts shall have a cut-out on all the foors 
in the staircase and lift lobby. The bottom end of the duct shall be closed. Air grills 
of dampers shall be provided on all the cut-outs of the ducts.
Now install the high-speed co-axial pressurisation fans on the rooftop. These 
fans are then connected to the vertical pressurisation duct.
For pressurisation of the lift wells, ducting is not required because the lift well is 
in itself a duct and only needs pressurisation. For lift well pressurisation, an opening 
is provided in the lift well on the top foor of the roof. The co-axial fan is directly 
ftted in the opening.
Connect all the fans with the automated electrical control panel, which in turn is 
connected to the main fre control panel. As soon as the fre control panel detects the 
9.2 Control Station of Firefghting and Detection System242
fre signals, an alarm is raised, and the control panel sends a command to the control 
panel of the pressurisation fan, which in turn switches on the pressurisation fans.
Provide electrical supply to the electrical control panel and activate the pressuri￾sation fans. Test the entire pressurisation system, and if found ok, give approval 
for use.
9.3 Firefghting Outside the Hospital Building
See Table 9.3.
For frefghting, outside the hospital premises, the arrangement shall be done for 
providing outlets for water supply in case of fre. These water outlets are used to 
spray the water on the building from the outside and are also used by the fre tender 
for reflling.
Hence, alongside the entire perimeter of the hospital building, the ring of the fre 
pipeline has to be provided. This ring is called the yard hydrant ring. At a suitable 
distance (as defned by the norms and regulations issued by the concerned state or 
country), the hydrants are provided.
Just near these hydrants, the box shall be fxed on the wall to accommodate the 
fay-lay canvas hose pipe. The fre nozzle, which can be fxed on this fat-lay canvas 
pipe, shall also be placed in this box.

The last step is the pressure test of the yard hydrant ring line, and if no leakage 
is noticed, the system can be approved for use.

ELV, ICT, IBMS, and Information 
Technology Works of the Hospital Building
ICT, which stands for Information and Communication Technologies, focuses on 
services related to processing information (data, voice, video) and connecting 
devices. On the other hand, ELV (Extra Low Voltage) systems concentrate on ser￾vices such as connectivity, security, safety, and automation.
Both of these systems play a crucial role in the functioning of a hospital. The 
local area network (LAN) infrastructure within a hospital is responsible for provid￾ing IP connectivity to various services.
These services may be located in different areas of the building but require con￾nectivity through the same physical network to share data or commands. Examples 
of applications that rely on this network infrastructure include CCTV, data sharing, 
public address systems, voice communication, video streaming, nurse call systems, 
queuing systems, Hospital Information Systems (HIS), Picture Archiving and 
Communication Systems (PACS), and more.
Effcient implementation of the IT or computer network is essential within a 
hospital. This is because the software used to operate the hospital, typically referred 
to as the Hospital Information System (HIS), is utilised in all locations and depart￾ments of the facility. As the software is installed on central servers within the hospi￾tal, it is necessary to connect all workstations to these servers to establish a complete 
network.
The enclosed checklist provides the sequence of works related to ELV, ICT, 
IBMS, and IT, which shall be completed inside the building, aiding the site engineer 
to plan the start and end day of each activity along with the present status of that 
particular activity.

10.2 Central Control Station for CCTV System
See Table 10.2.
The security of individuals and materials on the premises is a major concern for 
hospitals due to their size and complexity. Generally, there are a lot of people pres￾ent in hospitals, some of whom may be experiencing mental stress. Therefore, there 
is always a danger of suicide or self-harm. Additionally, there is a strong likelihood 
that expensive equipment will be stolen and hospital data will be leaked out. 
Hospitals must therefore have comprehensive and effcient closed-circuit television 
(CCTV) systems to tackle such concerns.
The system must keep track of every action that takes place inside the building, 
especially in high-risk areas, including entrance lobbies, cash stations, OPD waiting 
rooms, ICU complexes, emergency rooms, morgues, kitchens, and other busy, clut￾tered places. This recording can be used to track an incident if necessary.
The CCTV system makes it possible for video pictures to be displayed online, 
records them in real time, and makes them accessible for later tracking, as needed.

The following steps need to be followed to install the CCTV system in the 
hospital.
As was mentioned earlier in Chap. 5 of this book, the CCTV cameras shall be 
fxed in the building and these cameras shall then be connected to the central con￾trol unit.
As far as the control system is concerned, it includes network video recorder/
digital video recorder (NVR/DVR), a display screen, a computer server to record 
the videos, and a computer to display the recordings.
To establish the control room, the frst step is to install the NVR/DVR. All the 
cables originating from the cameras are terminated at this NVR/DVR. Along with 
this, the display screens also shall be installed near the NVR/DVR to display the live 
recording of the cameras, which is viewed by the security personnel or any other 
authorised person of the hospital to detect any mishappening immediately.
10.2 Central Control Station for CCTV System248
It is always recommended to record the live videos and save the same for a par￾ticular duration, say 2 to 3 months, so that they can be retrieved as and when needed. 
Hence, a central server, called a CCTV server, shall be installed and attached to the 
NVR/DVR, where the live streaming of the cameras is recorded. This server shall 
be placed at some other place away from the NVR/DVR, say in a separate room.
As it is recommended that the server shall not be used for day-to-day work, the 
personal computer (PC) needs to be hooked on to the CCTV server for routine 
work. This personal computer shall be placed in the control room, where the display 
screens are installed. This personal computer shall be connected to the CCTV 
server. The computer will thus help the security or other authorised person to 
retrieve the recordings or view the recordings as and when needed.
The next step is to connect all the cables, originating from the individual cam￾eras, to the NVR/DVR. The cable can either be the audio-visual cable or preferably 
the fbre cable.
Supply electric power to the NVR/DVR from a dedicated MCB. Please ensure 
that the power backup is provided to the NVR/DVR through the UPS so that the 
NVR/DVR is continually functioning.
Check the entire CCTV system, including the cameras, NVR/DVR, and the 
recordings of the cameras. Also, ensure that the cameras are positioned properly and 
are angled accurately to capture the area as required by you and there are no hurdles 
in between, which may hamper the recording. If everything is found to be satisfac￾tory, approve it and keep it ready for utilisation.
10.3 Public Announcement (PA) System Inside 
the Hospital Building
See Table 10.3.
For public address (PA) system, frst of all, the location of the speakers and the 
mikes shall be fnalised as per the design and drawings. Based on the location, the 
conduits are laid down for wiring. The conduits shall be either concealed in the 
walls or otherwise; if the drawings permit, they can be installed in the open above 
the false ceiling.
Now, wiring work shall be completed by using the recommended and designed 
wire. The wiring shall on one hand start from the location of the speakers and mike 
and shall terminate at the amplifer and PC server installed in the central PA con￾trol room.
Once the painting work and the fnishing jobs are over, the required speakers 
(wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted) and the mikes shall be installed and tested 
before fnal use.

10.4 Control Station of Public Announcement (PA) System
See Table 10.4.
In a hospital, communication is crucial to improving healthcare delivery and sav￾ing lives. At all times, staff must be able to contact the required medical specialists. 
The personnel must also be able to broadcast general and emergency announce￾ments across the hospital and ensure that the intended audience is receiving them. 
Hospital communication systems, including intercom and public address (PA) sys￾tems, are crucial in this situation.
Public address systems can be used in hospitals to broadcast prayers, play back￾ground music, and make announcements in waiting rooms and corridors in addition 
to emergency announcements.
As was mentioned earlier in Chap. 5 of this book, the speakers of the PA system 
are fxed in the building and these speakers are then connected to the central con￾trol unit.
As far as the setting up of the control room is concerned, frst of all, the ampli￾fers shall be installed in the control room of the hospital. Apart from the amplifers, 
the PA control unit also needs to be installed. This control system helps control the 
volumes, zoning of the building, sound quality, and amplifcation of the sound, etc.

Now comes the gas outlets. The gas outlets shall be installed above the patient 
bed. It can either be affxed on the wall directly or otherwise in the bed head panel 
affxed on the wall just above the patient bed. Once the outlets are affxed at the 
place, the outlet shall be connected to the drop pipe left during pipeline installation.
Fix the point accessories such as fow meter, suction jar, etc. Similarly, if the bed 
head panel accessories, such as a monitor tray or the utility basket, are supplied 
along with the bed head panel, the same shall be installed.
Test the entire system and connect it to the main control station of MGPS.

A set of components/equipment shall be installed to supply all of these gases to 
the fnal point of use. This system runs from the gas source to the outlet point on the 
patient’s bed. All of these system components are collectively referred to as MGPS 
systems. Each medical gas must be supplied by its own system. The gases shall 
never be mixed or cross-connected between systems.
The source for supply of the oxygen gas can be cryogenic vessels or a high￾pressure manifold where the tank is flled up with liquid oxygen; a manifold system 
where a set of gas cylinders are connected in a series and forming a bank of cylin￾ders or oxygen concentrators, which takes air from the atmosphere, separates the 
oxygen component, and flls up the tanks. Similarly, the source of nitrous oxide is 
generally a manifold system where a set of gas cylinders are connected in a series 
and forming a bank of cylinders. As far as the source for medical air and the vacuum 
is concerned, it is from the air compressors and the vacuum pumps.
Various components are used for setting up the MGPS system, such as:
(a) A copper pipeline distribution system that delivers gas or vacuum to endpoint 
or terminal units
(b) Valves to control the fow of the gases
11 Medical Gases Pipeline System (MGPS) Works of the Hospital Building269
(c) Warning and alarm systems to provide alerts in the event of system failure or 
inadequate gas pressures
(d) Area line pressure alarm boxes
(e) Outlets that are the MGPS’s fnal endpoints from where gases are delivered to 
patients
(f) Other materials such as hoses, gas fow meters, gauges, and vacuum regulators
Infrastructure-wise the MGPS shall have:
(a) Liquid oxygen tank area with landing bay (if a liquid oxygen tank is to be 
installed)
(b) Oxygen and nitrous oxide manifold room
(c) Pump room for installation of plants for compressor, vacuum units
11.2.1 Manifold Room
The manifold room is provided in the hospital to install the manifold for oxygen and 
nitrous oxide gases. The manifold is basically a system in which multiple cylinders 
are connected in series and in turn connected to a common outlet. This set of cylin￾ders connected in a series is called a BANK. Usually, “D-type” jumbo cylinders are 
used for the manifolds.
Each bank of cylinders may have 2–20 cylinders. The number of cylinders to be 
installed in each bank shall be decided based on the number of outlets that are 
required as of the date and adding the provision for additional outlets that may be 
required in future. Based on the number of cylinders to be installed in a bank, a 
common connecting copper pipe shall be fxed on the wall, and the outlet’s sockets 
shall be provided on this common pipe at a distance of about 1 ft. from each other. 
One socket shall be provided for each cylinder of the bank.
The copper tailpipe shall be attached to these sockets, which in turn shall be con￾nected to the regulator of the cylinders. Each cylinder shall have a separate tailpipe 
and regulator. This regulator shall be fxed on the cylinders. Now the common con￾necting pipe, on which all the cylinders of the bank are attached, is connected to the 
control panel, which controls the fow of the gas.
It shall be kept in mind that the temperature of the gas may fall as low as −30 °C 
as the gas passes through the regulator at maximum capacity. Hence, the equipment 
shall be designed accordingly.
To complete the manifold setup, two such banks are installed and both are con￾nected to the control panel. One bank is termed as a “Duty Bank” and the other as a 
“Standby Bank.” The control panel functions to control the fow of gases. As both 
the banks are connected to the control panel, this panel allows one bank to be oper￾ated at a time. As soon as the pressure of the current bank drops, the control panel 
automatically switches to the other bank. This job is done with the help of pressure￾regulating valves ftted with each bank. Once the empty bank is cut-off, the 
11.2 Central Plant Works of MGPS System270
cylinders of that bank are replaced with the flled cylinders and make it ready for the 
next use.
The control panel can either be automatic or semi-automatic type. The automatic 
control panel automatically switches between “Duty Bank” to “Standby Bank,” and 
vice versa. However, in the case of a semi-automatic panel, the warning is issued as 
soon as the bank pressure drops and the operator have to manually shift to the 
other bank.
The manifold headers shall be ftted with a non-return valve to allow the removal 
and replacement of any cylinder and to prevent the discharge of a bank of cylinders 
in the event of pig tail-pipe rupture.
From the control panel, the outlet shall be given which is connected to the copper 
pipe of the main supply line of the gas, which is also called the main riser. The main 
riser is the line that transports the gas to the hospital building.
To be on the safer side, it is anticipated that an emergency may arise at any time 
due to the failure of the manifold system. To overcome such an emergency, an emer￾gency manifold with two to four cylinders shall also be provided. The design of the 
emergency manifold shall be the same as that of the main manifold, with the differ￾ence that no control panel is provided on the emergency manifold.
The output of the emergency manifold shall be directly connected to the main 
supply line where the main manifold is already connected. In case of failure of the 
main manifold system, and as soon as the emergency manifold is switched on, the 
gas fow starts in the same main pipeline. A non-return valve and isolating valve 
shall be installed immediately upstream of the reserve manifold connection to the 
pipeline distribution system.
The manifold system shall be prepared for oxygen supply and the nitrous oxide 
supply. So, for both the gases, the main bank and the emergency supplies shall be 
provided.
11.2.2 Pump Room for Air
The production of medical air is done with the help of the compressor. The plant 
consists of electric motors, air compressors, air reservoir, an automatic/semi￾automatic control panel, bacteria flter, and the air dryer along with the required 
non-return valves, isolating valves, gauges and pressure switches, an operating and 
indicating system, an exhaust system, and a test point. There shall be a set of two 
such units as both will be operative reciprocally one after the other at a fxed interval 
of time.
The frst step is the construction of the foundation for placing the pump and air 
compressor. The foundation shall be raised from the ground level depending on the 
water logging in the room. It can be anywhere between 150 mm and 450 mm. The 
size of the foundation shall be able to easily accommodate two sets of air compres￾sors and also have some space all around the compressors for easy maintenance. 
There are two options. First is to have a combined foundation for both sets of 
11 Medical Gases Pipeline System (MGPS) Works of the Hospital Building271
compressors on the same foundation. Second is the construction of a separate foun￾dation for each compressor pump. Strength-wise, the foundation shall have the suf￾fcient load-bearing capacity to easily tolerate the load of the pump and also be able 
to tolerate the vibration load of the compressor pumps.
Similarly, the foundation has to be constructed for the air reservoir. The size and 
load-bearing capacity shall be decided as per the design given by the original manu￾facturer of the reservoir.
Once the foundations are ready, the next is to place the compressor pumps on the 
foundation. The compressor unit comprises two machines. One is the electric motor, 
and the second is the air compressor. Both these machines are mounted on the base 
frame, which is fabricated for this purpose. The coupling of both shall be done with 
the help of V-belts. This base frame (mounted with motor and compressor) shall be 
fxed on the pre-constructed foundation with the help of fasteners.
Please ensure to provide the anti-vibration pads while fxing the base frame as 
the unit creates a lot of vibration when operative. It has to be ensured that the com￾pressors shall be oil-free compressors, failing which there are chances that the pro￾duced air may have traces of oil, which may be harmful to the patients or medical 
devices. The plant shall have all-around access for maintenance purposes and allow￾ance shall be made for changing major components.
The outlet of both compressors shall be combined and connected to the air reser￾voir. The air reservoir is a tank made out of thick MS steel and is provided with an 
air inlet, air outlet, and gate valve to drain the water (collected in the tank due to the 
moisture in the air). This tank shall be installed on the raised foundation (say by 
150–450 mm).
The air normally contains traces of impurities such as carbon monoxide, carbon 
dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen monoxide and dioxide, moisture, and oils. These 
contaminants can enter the compressed air system from three sources: the atmo￾sphere, the compressor, and the pipeline distribution system. Hence, the air fltration 
unit has to be provided to flter the air before sending it out to the user end. This air 
fltration system can be in different stages depending on the type of flter. It can be 
from a single-stage flter to a four-stage flter. The air flters shall be provided just 
near the outlet of the air reservoir. Provide the electric point near the air fltration 
equipment to supply electricity to the flter equipment.
As the air contains moisture, it needs to be dried before sending it further to the 
user. If it is not dried, the wet air can be dangerous for the patients and also harmful 
to the medical equipment where it shall be used. The dryer system shall be a twin 
system, so only one is operational at a time and the other is on standby. From time 
to time, switching is done from one to another. Just at the outlet point of the flters, 
the dryer system shall be installed and connected to the flter system so that the fl￾tered air can reach the dryer unit. For both the dryer units, separate power supply 
outlets shall be provided near the dryer units.
The functioning of the air compressors is controlled by the automatic/semi￾automatic control panels. The electric connections to the motors shall be done 
through this control panel. The control panel switches from one set of compressor 
units to the other automatically at the pre-set interval of time. At any moment, both 
11.2 Central Plant Works of MGPS System272
compressors shall be in working condition. If one unit goes out of order, the other 
unit of compressors shall be able to take the entire load of the air requirement.
At last, the outlet from the dryer shall be connected to the main riser copper line 
that in turn shall be connected to the copper pipe network inside the hospital build￾ing to supply air till the fnal air outlet is used by the user.
Switch on the compressor plant and test both the compressor pumps, air reser￾voir, and pipeline for any leakage of the Air. If everything is found to be satisfactory, 
approve it and keep it ready for utilisation.
11.2.3 Pump Room for Vacuum
The creation of the vacuum is done with the help of vacuum pumps. The plant con￾sists of electric motors, vacuum pumps, vacuum reservoir, an automatic/semi￾automatic control panel, and a bacteria flter with drainage traps along with the 
required non-return valves, isolating valves, gauges and pressure switches, an oper￾ating and indicating system, an exhaust system, and a test point. There shall be a set 
of two such units as both will be operative reciprocally one after the other at a fxed 
interval of time.
The frst step is the construction of the foundation for placing the vacuum pump. 
The foundation shall be raised from the ground level depending on the water log￾ging in the room. It can be anywhere between 150 mm and 450 mm. The size of the 
foundation shall be able to easily accommodate two sets of vacuum pumps and also 
have some space all around the pumps for easy maintenance. There are two options. 
First is to have a combined foundation for both sets of vacuum pumps on the same 
foundation. Second is the construction of a separate foundation for each vacuum 
pump. Strength-wise, the foundation shall have the suffcient load-bearing capacity 
to easily tolerate the load of the vacuum pump and also be able to tolerate the vibra￾tion load of the vacuum pumps.
Similarly, the foundation has to be constructed for the vacuum reservoir. The size 
and load-bearing capacity shall be decided as per the design given by the original 
manufacturer of the reservoir.
Once the foundations are ready, the next is to place the vacuum pumps on the 
foundation. The vacuum unit consists of two parts. One is the electric motor, and the 
second is the vacuum pumps. Both these machines shall be mounted on the base 
frame, fabricated for this purpose. The coupling of both shall be done with the help 
of V-belts. This base frame (mounted with a motor and pump) shall be fxed on the 
pre-constructed foundation with the help of fasteners.
Please ensure to provide the anti-vibration pads while fxing the base frame as 
the unit creates a lot of vibration when operative. It has to be ensured that the vac￾uum pumps shall be oil-free. Water-sealed pumps shall not be used. It is desirable if 
rotary vane pumps are used instead of reciprocating vacuum pumps that are now 
obsolete. The plant shall have all-around access for maintenance purposes and 
allowance shall be made for changing major components.
11 Medical Gases Pipeline System (MGPS) Works of the Hospital Building273
The outlet of both the vacuum pumps shall be combined and connected to the 
vacuum reservoir. The vacuum reservoir is a tank made out of thick MS steel and is 
provided with an inlet connected to the vacuum pump, and an outlet connected to 
the fltration system. This tank shall be installed on a raised foundation (say by 
150 mm–450 mm).
The vacuum system shall be connected to the bacteria flters. The purpose is that 
any suction air coming towards the reservoir passes through the fltration system. 
Therefore, the bacteria flter station and secretion trap are provided in the system. 
The fltration system can be in different stages depending on the type of flter. It can 
be from a single-stage flter to a four-stage flter. Hence, the flter unit shall be con￾nected at the receiving end of the flter unit. The delivery end of the flter unit shall 
be connected to the vacuum reservoir.
The functioning of the vacuum pumps shall be controlled by the automatic/semi￾automatic control panels. The electric connections to the motors shall be done 
through this control panel. The control panel switches from one set of pumps to the 
other automatically at a pre-set interval of time. At any moment, both vacuum pump 
units shall be in working condition. If one unit goes out of order, the other unit of 
the pump shall be able to take the entire load of the vacuum requirement.
Switch on the vacuum plant and test both the vacuum pumps, vacuum reservoir, 
and pipeline for any leakage. If everything is found to be satisfactory, approve it and 
keep it ready for utilisation.
11.2.4 Liquid Oxygen Gas System
In hospitals where the consumption of oxygen is quite high, it practically becomes 
diffcult to handle the cylinders. Also, if the availability of the cylinders is not ade￾quate, the hospital may face problems in fulflling the demand for the oxygen 
required. Hence, the best option is to consider the installation of a bulk liquid oxy￾gen tank or so-called vessel. The tank used for storing the liquid oxygen is a cryo￾genic pressure vessel made of stainless steel supported within an outer vessel, 
similar to a vacuum fask.
The liquid oxygen plant consists of the cryogenic tank and the coils. The coils 
have a gas outlet, which is connected to the copper pipeline. Passing through the 
valves, pressure monitors, and pressure controller, this pipeline is ultimately con￾nected to the main oxygen supply line of the hospital. Working-wise, the liquid 
oxygen in the vessel fows to the coils where it is converted into the gaseous form. 
This gas then fows to the main pipeline for further supply to the endpoint.
Identify the space for the vessel, which shall be about 18 m × 9 m. On the front 
side, the space of about 9  m × 9 m shall be left empty for parking the vehicle car￾rying the liquid oxygen to unload the liquid gas into the tank.
For installation of the liquid oxygen tank, frst of all, the foundation shall be 
constructed. The size of the foundation shall depend on the size of the tank. 
Similarly, the foundations are prepared for the coils. Usually, the height of the 
11.2 Central Plant Works of MGPS System274
foundations shall be from 230 mm to 450 mm. It is advised that the detailed speci￾fcation and drawing shall be obtained from the original manufacturer of the tank.
Then, the vessel shall be installed on a pre-constructed foundation and properly 
screwed to the foundation with the help of heavy-duty fasteners. Install the coil 
units on the foundation constructed for that purpose. Connect the vessel with the 
inlet of the coil units.
Install the control unit consisting of the pressure regulator, pressure gauges, iso￾lation valve, etc. Connect the inlet of the control unit with the outlet of the coil unit.
Now connect the outlet of the control unit with the main riser copper pipeline to 
distribute the oxygen at the oxygen outlet at the patient end.
The fooring of the vehicle parking area on the front side of the vessel shall be 
made out of concrete, which shall be capable of bearing the load of the vehicle.
The entire plant area shall then be enclosed by the fencing to prevent unauthor￾ised entry into the plant area.
In the plant enclosure, a running water tap shall be provided for melting the ice 
accumulated on the copper pipeline from time to time.
Before installing the plant, it may be necessary to comply with local authority 
planning constraints in some areas. Even before installations, the drawings have to 
be approved from a competent authority such as the explosive department. Once 
completed, an inspection may be done by the department before issuing the licence 
to operate the plant.

Construction Works Outside the Main 
Building
To make the building fully operational, apart from the inside works, a few works 
have also to be carried out outside the main building. These works/activities are the 
part and parcel of services or otherwise for the elegant looks of the building.
Therefore, some of the activities/works to be carried out outside the building are 
internal road networks made out of RCC, PCC, tiles or bitumen; parking spaces for 
cars, two-wheelers, buses, and ambulances; elevation of the building, including sur￾face treatment and building highlighters; roof treatment and rainwater drainage; 
main gates of the hospital; security posts with barriers; landing bays and porches; 
boundary wall; and landscaping and plantation.
The enclosed checklist provided the list of such works and helps the site engineer 
to plan the start and end day of each activity.
12.1 Internal Roads
See Table 12.1.
The internal roads within the hospital compound are to connect the main approach 
road to the hospital complex. If the hospital compound is large enough and houses 
more than one building, the internal roads are used to connect all these individual 
buildings. Hence, the network of internal roads is as important as the main roads.
There can be various methods to build internal roads. It can be reinforced cement 
concrete (RCC) roads, plain cement concrete (PCC) roads, tiles roads, and black 
tarcoal bitumen roads.
Whatever types of roads are planned, the initial steps before starting the con￾struction of the roads are the same. First of all, the location where the roads have to 
be laid down needs to be levelled. Here, levelling is defned in terms of the level of 
the road from the building and the main approach road. Please ensure that the level 
of the internal roads is higher than the main approach road. The reason is that if the 276

level of the internal roads is low, the water will fow from the main approach road to 
the internal road, creating water logging. Similarly, the internal road level shall be 
lower than the hospital’s main building.
Second, the levelling means, the entire road to be laid down shall be at the same 
level. The slopes within the internal roads shall be avoided. For proper levelling of 
the internal roads, if the land flling is required, please do it.
Once the road is levelled, the next step is the compaction of the road area. Why 
compaction? The compaction is necessary to avoid sagging of the roads later on due 
to rains or landslides. The compaction shall be done by pouring the water on the 
road and pressing it with the help of the road roller. Please avoid hurrying in laying 
the roads, and wait till the road area is properly compacted.
Once the levelling and the compaction are completed, the surface may be consid￾ered ready for laying the road.
Let us discuss the road types one by one.
12.1.1 Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) Roads
The frst step for the RCC road is to lay the layer of stone grit. The size of the stone 
shall depend on the design and load-bearing capacity of the road. This layer is also 
known as water bound macadam (WBM). Compact the stone grit layer with the help 
of the road roller.
The next step is to lay the PCC layer on the compacted surface. Let it dry and set 
it down. There is another option for laying this layer, which is called dry lean con￾crete (DLC), Difference between the two is that in the case of PCC, the mixture is a 
wet mortar which is laid down. However, in the case of DLC, the dried mortar is laid 
down and compressed and levelled with the help of the road roller.
Lay down the steel bars for reinforcement. Please ensure that the steel bars are 
properly tied with the binding wire.
Apply the shuttering on the sides of the road before pouring the concrete mix￾ture. After pouring the concrete mixture, apply pin type vibrator and fatbed vibrator 
for proper compaction of the concrete mixture. Smoothen the upper surface of the 
concrete mixture. Do not forget to provide the expansion joint and construction 
joints as per the design and specifcations.
The thickness of all the individual layers and the specifcation of the materials 
shall be calculated during the design phase depending on the factors such as load 
bearing capacity of the road, size of the road, traffc movement on the road, etc.
Let the concrete mixture settle down. After 24 h, start curing the road. Cure it for 
7–21 days depending on the climatic conditions. Let the concrete settle down. Open 
the road for use after 15 days of curing.
12.1 Internal Roads278
12.1.2 Plain Cement Concrete (PCC) Roads
The frst step for the PCC road is to lay the layer of stone grit. The size of the stone 
shall depend on the design and load-bearing capacity of the road. This layer is also 
known as water bound macadam (WBM). Compact the stone grit layer with the help 
of the road roller.
Apply the shuttering on the sides of the road before pouring the PCC. The next 
step is to lay the PCC layer or the pavement quality concrete (PQC) on the com￾pacted surface. Let it dry and set it down. There is another option for laying this 
layer, which is called dry lean concrete (DLC). Difference between the two is that 
in the case of PCC, the mixture is a wet mortar which is laid down. However, in the 
case of DLC, the dried mortar is laid down and compressed and levelled with the 
help of the road roller.
The thickness of all the individual layers and the specification of the materi￾als shall be calculated during the design phase depending on the factors such as 
load bearing capacity of the road, size of the road, traffic movement on the 
road, etc.
Let the concrete mixture settle down. After 24 h, start curing the road. Cure 
it for 4–6 days. Let the concrete settle down. Open the road for use after 15 days 
of curing.
12.1.3 Tiled Roads
To lay the tiled road, once the road surface is ready after compaction, lay the layer 
of the stone grit. The size of the stone shall depend on the design and load-bearing 
capacity of the road. Compact the stone grit layer with the help of the road roller.
Now is the time to lay down the tiles in a pre-designed pattern. The top level of 
the tiles shall be the same and shall be laid down with the leveller. Avoid too much 
gap between the tiles. On the edges of the road, if full tile cannot be placed, cut the 
tile and palace the tile on the surface.
Next is to fll up the fller in between the tiles. Generally, fne sand is used for 
flling up. With the help of a wooden sheet or with a hard broom, fll all the gaps 
properly so the sand is flled in each gap.
Now pour enough water on the road, so that the fller sand settles down in the 
gaps. If after settlement more sand is required for the gaps, please fll it up again. 
Again, pour water on the road. Once the gaps are flled, the road is ready to 
be used.
In some cases, the engineers may want to grout the gaps between the tiles. 
The same can be done with the help of pure cement. However, over a period of 
time, the cement grouting may get peeled off, which may have to be done again 
and again.

12.1.4 Black Bitumen Road
The frst step for preparing the road surface is to remove all the pit holes or rust, if 
any, on the surface. These irregularities shall be flled up with premix chippings at 
least a week before laying the surface course.
Now lay the stone grit on the surfaced road. Depending on the utility of the road, 
the thickness and the layers of the stone grit shall be designed and decided. Generally, 
the lower layer is 50 mm–65 mm grit. This layer is known as WBM. The size of the 
stone may vary depending on the design and load-bearing capacity of the road. Roll 
the same with the roller by pouring the water. Now lay the stone grit of 10 mm–20 mm. 
This layer is also known as RBM. Again, roll it by pouring the water on it. Now the 
road surface is ready to lay the bitumen layer.
Now the surface is ready to apply a bituminous base course and a binder course 
on the ready surface. This coat is named as tack coat. This coat shall be applied 
manually or by machinery. These coatings spread to certain square meters accord￾ing to the size of roads and pavements. It applies in 6–7.5 kg per 10 m2
.
Now is the time to lay the premix, which has been prepared in a hot mix plant of 
a required capacity with the desired quality control. Please ensure that the content 
of bitumen in the premix is 4–5%. Lay the premix layer with the help of a mechani￾cal paver, taking care of the camber and the thickness of the layer as designed. The 
control of the temperatures during the mixing and the compaction is of great signif￾cance in the strength of the resulting pavement structure.
Once the premix is laid down, and before it is cooled, thoroughly roll the road 
with the road roller, so that the road is properly compacted.
Finishing of the road surface includes alignment, clearing undulations, etc. 
Provide the road markers with the road paint. Now the road is ready for use.
12.2 Elevation of Building
See Table 12.2.
Elevation of the hospital building shall be such which gives an appealing look 
from the outside. The design of the elevation is purely as per the desire of the pro￾moter and the designers. However, the design shall have suffcient provision for the 
entrance of natural light in the building and shall also have a provision for cross 
ventilation in the building.
The windows of the building shall be clearly demarcated in the elevations. The 
service shafts and the service ducts shall also be properly defned and placed while 
designing the elevations.
There are various materials that can be applied to the elevations such as simple 
painting, stonework, tiles work, glass work, aluminium composite sheet, etc. Also, 
factors such as budget and time are important before choosing the elevation.
The steps involved in completing the elevation are as follows.

:-
First of all, the service shafts and the service ducts, as soon as the service pipe￾lines are laid down in the service shafts and ducts, close these with the help of the 
brickwork or any other material, as prescribed by the designer. Please remember to 
prove the service windows in the service shafts according to the design provided by 
the designer.
Now fx the window frame at the proper locations, if not already fxed from the 
inner side of the building. If the building is centrally air-conditioned, the windows 
may be glass windows that are usually not openable. In such a case, leave the glass 
fxing for a later stage because if the glass is fxed before the completion of eleva￾tion, the glass may break.
If the windows are openable, fx the window frame and leave window panes to 
be fxed later on after the completion of the elevation work.
Now depending on the type of material to be used for elevation, the wall surface 
has to be prepared. If the plans are to use sheets for elevation, the framing needs to 
be done, on which the sheets will be fxed. The framing can again be done by the 
various types of extruded sections of mild steel or aluminium. Wooden framing 
shall be avoided, as it may get eroded over a period of time. If mild steel is used, do 
not forget to paint the frame structure properly to prevent the frame from rusting. 
Properly and securely fx the frame onto the wall with the help of the fasteners. Now 
12 Construction Works Outside the Main Building281
fx the sheets on the frame and fll up the gaps between the sheets to give a fnish￾ing look.
If the stone or tiles are to be used for elevation, the wall surface shall be rough so 
that the tile or stone can get proper binding. Fix the tiles or stone, as the case may 
be, on the wall surface. Fill up the gaps and fnish the surface.
If the elevation is simply to be painted, apply the frst coat of wall putty. Once the 
wall putty is dry, rub the same with the sandpaper. If required, again apply the sec￾ond coat of the wall putty and again rub the surface with the sandpaper till the wall 
surface is smooth. Now apply the wall primer on the wall surface. Once it is dry, 
apply the frst coat of paint. Let it dry. Apply the second coat of paint. If required, 
apply a third coat of paint on the wall.
Fix the glass or glass panes on the windows and clean them properly.
If the height of the building is more, to clean the outer surfaces and glass of the 
building, create a provision for the pressure washing, vacuum chamber, lifting 
cable, cleaning platform (operated manually or electrically), or the bosun’s chair. It 
is up to the designer of the elevation, which method he/she opts for cleaning the 
outer surfaces.
Prepare the ramps or the stairs in front of the entrances. The location, size, and 
design of the ramps and the stairs shall depend on the design as provided by the 
designer.
12.3 Roof Treatment
See Table 12.3.
One of the important issues with the building’s completion is the roof treatment. 
The advantages are that it improves structure durability, reduces the cost of repairs 
of the building, offers energy effciency, offers an easy fow of rainwater, prevents 
the onset of health concerns, and improves the life of interior work and furniture.
For roof treatment, the frst and foremost step is the waterproofng of the roof 
surface. As the chemicals used for waterproofng requires proper adhesion, cleaning 
the roof surface is important. Hence, the cleaning shall be done by removing all the 
dust particles and substances from the roof and then pressure washing the roof. Let 
it get dried.
All the penetrations on the roof such as vent pipes, skylights, drains, parapet 
walls and termination edge fashings, or rooftop HVAC units shall be properly 
treated. Special attention shall be paid to proper and correct capping over the para￾pet wall.
Next is the application of the primers on the surface. The primer improves the 
adhesion of the waterproof chemical and aids to block the bleeding of the bitumi￾nous oils from the existing roof through the liquid membrane.
Now is the time to apply a waterproof compound on the roof. The compound 
shall be applied in three coats: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. Let the waterproof 
compound dry.

As a precaution, some of the designers recommend affxing the layer of the bitu￾men tarcoal sheet on the roof for better waterproofng.
The next step is to apply a layer of mud faska on the roof. While laying the mud 
faska, please check the slope of the roof. Provide adequate slope for quick drainage 
of the rainwater. The slopes shall be towards the rainwater harvesting pipes. Let the 
mud faska dry up.
Once the surface is dried, lay the layer of PCC for preparing the surface to fx the 
tiles of bricks. Now fx the tiles or the bricks on the PCC layer. Properly fll up the 
gaps and grout the gaps.
If the designer recommends the mosaic foor on the roof, apply the mosaic layer 
on the PCC surface. After the mosaic, the water curing shall be done properly.
Please ensure that no gaps are left on the roof surface from where the water can 
sweep in the roof. This seepage of the water can be very dangerous for the building.
12.4 Main Gates
See Table 12.4.
The main gate of the hospital is the entrance through which patients and visitors 
enter the campus. This main gate serves as a link between the public road and the 
hospital road. The following issues shall be considered while erecting the main gate.
The frst step is to get the main gate fabricated as per the design. The gate shall 
be manufactured using mild steel or stainless steel. However, the material to be used

Typically, the hospital shall have two or more such main gates: one for entering 
and one for exiting. Please keep in mind that the main gate shall be at least 20 feet 
wide. In addition to the main gate for traffc, it is recommended that a small addi￾tional gate be provided for pedestrians. With the evolving technology, providing 
automated gates or automated barriers can also be considered.
Now as the gate is ready after fabrication, it is time to install the gate. The main 
gate shall be fxed in the boundary wall of the hospital. The gate shall be securely 
fxed with the columns provided for this purpose. Please ensure that the levels of the 
gate are perfect, and the gate is easily operatable. Avoid any hump or speed breaker 
at the main gate.
If required, paint the surfaces of the main gate. If the door is automated or electri￾cally operated, provide the necessary power point for the operation of the gate.
12.5 Security Posts
See Table 12.5.
Security posts are provided in the hospital to guard the main gate and other areas 
of the hospital around the clock. Hence, depending on the size of the hospital prem￾ises, one or more security pots shall be provided.
As a frst step, the security posts shall be either constructed with the masonry 
work or otherwise temporarily fabricated post. Paint the surfaces of the security post.
Whatever may be the structure, the post shall be provided with proper electrical 
points for the fan, light, charging points, and other security gadgets. Also, provide 
the telephone/intercom lines and the Closed Circuit Television System (CCTV) 
cameras.
Just at the entry of the hospital and near the security post, the security barriers 
shall be provided. The security barriers can be the manually operated boom barriers

12.6 Landing Bay and Porches
See Table 12.6.
There shall be landing bays outside all hospital entrances for patients and 
visitors to be dropped off and picked up. This landing bay shall preferably have 
a porch at the entrance gate to provide shelter from inclement weather. The 
porch shall be large enough to accommodate two vehicles at once. The porch’s 
height from the road shall be at least 4572 mm. Outside the lobby, there shall 
be a clear traffic pattern. A trolley bay outside the lobby shall be provided for 
the parking of wheelchairs and stretcher trollies so that patients arriving on the

12.6.1 RCC Structure
If the landing bay has to be built up by the masonry work using the concrete mix￾ture, the frst step is to cast the columns of the landing bay. Start with digging the 
soil for the foundation of the columns. Cast the foundation of the columns with 
RCC. Now cast the columns with RCC. Please ensure proper curing of the casted 
columns. Once the desired height of the columns is reached, prepare to cast the roof 
of the landing bay.
For casting the roof of the bay, the beams on which the roof will rest have to be 
casted. Hence, start with steel works for the beams. Place the shuttering for casting 
12.6 Landing Bay and Porches286
the roof slab. Next is to provide the steel reinforcement for the slab. Once ready, cast 
the beans and slab simultaneously.
After proper curing, of the slab, open the shuttering of the slab. Plaster the col￾umns and the ceiling of the landing bay. If the false ceiling is to be provided in the 
landing bay, the plastering of the slab can be avoided.
12.6.2 Steel Structure
If the landing bay is to be fabricated from mild steel, the frst step shall be to fabri￾cate the columns of the structure. For fxing the fabricated columns, the RCC foun￾dation shall be provided. To provide the RCC foundation, start with digging the soil 
for the foundation. Cast the foundation of the columns with RCC. The fabricated 
columns shall rest on this RCC foundation. Hence, as per designs and drawings, 
proper anchor bolts shall be casting the foundation.
Side by side the beams and purlin for the roof shall also be fabricated. Now place 
the columns on the foundation and tie them with the anchor bolts. Once the columns 
are ready, fx the beams and purlins. Next is to paint the entire mild steel structure 
with red oxide and fnally paint with enamel paint.
It is time to fx the sheets on the top of the porch. Tie the sheets properly with the 
help of bolts to avoid blowing off the sheets due to air velocity.
12.6.3 Common Activities for the Landing Bay
Whatever may the type of structure of the porch be, few works are common to both 
of them. Provide a proper mechanism of water drainage. The gutters and the drain￾age pipes shall be provided. The roof shall have a proper slope so that the water 
immediately fows into the gutter and is drained.
If the porch is not an open type, fx the sheets/glass/tiles on the lower surface of 
the porch, such as columns, side walls, etc.
If a false ceiling is designed, fx the same. The ceiling can be made out of plaster 
of paris, PVC sheets, or the grid ceiling. However, it is advised to avoid the false 
ceiling made out of plaster of paris as the same may get damaged due to moisture, 
particularly during the rainy seasons. Do not forget to provide cut-outs for the ceil￾ing lights in the false ceiling. Fix the lights in the ceiling or the walls, as designed.
As a lot of traffc shall be moving under the porch, the fooring of the porch shall 
have suffcient strength to bear the weight of the traffc. The fooring can be made 
by providing bitumen road, stones, tiles, or RCC.
The fnal painting of the porch shall now be done and make it ready for use.

12.7 Boundary Wall
See Table 12.7.
A boundary wall shall be provided to surround the hospital premises. The bound￾ary wall serves as the initial line of defence against intruders. Apart from this, it also 
helps to protect the hospital premises from animals and thieves.
There are various options to construct boundary walls. These are boundary walls 
constructed using cement concrete, bricks, stones, metal panels, and wooden pan￾els, and polyvinyl chloride fencing is often known as PVC fence, or wire mesh.
Generally, the boundary walls are constructed using brickwork or stones. Hence, 
we will explain the steps involved in constructing this type of boundary wall.
For the construction of the boundary wall, the frst step is to excavate the soil for 
laying down the foundation of the boundary wall. Once the soil is excavated and 
dressed properly, the PCC layer shall be laid down. The thickness of the PCC layer 
shall be as per the specifcation and drawings provided by the designer. Now lay the 
foundation on the PCC layer.
In case the length of the boundary wall is large, in between the brickwork, the 
support columns shall be provided. If designed for columns, the columns shall be 
constructed with the help of RCC as per the specifcation and drawings provided by 
the designer.

Once the foundation is complete, apply waterproofng on the top of the founda￾tion. For waterproofng, the waterproof compound shall be used and applied in two 
to three layers.
Now is the time to erect the boundary wall with bricks or stone blocks. These 
days, fy-ash blocks are also used instead of bricks. It will depend on the design and 
specifcations as provided by the designer. The standard height of the boundary wall 
shall range between 1000 mm and 2400 mm.
Once the brick/stone/block work is over, if required, the grill made out of mild 
steel or stainless steel shall be fxed on top of the boundary wall.
Provide conduit in the boundary wall by chase cutting and concealing the con￾duit in the wall. The conduiting is to lay electrical wires and cables for electric sup￾ply to the light ftting on the boundary wall.
Plaster the entire boundary wall from both sides. Once the plaster is dry, paint the 
entire boundary wall.
12.8 Landscaping and Plantation

psychological, and social well-being. The landscape at hospitals is not just gor￾geous. It promotes healing.
Plants, trees, and fowers increase positivity, relax muscle tension, lower blood 
pressure, and improve positive attitudes. They also reduce stress and anxiety. 
Patients who have a chance to look out of the windows onto trees, and green areas 
generally stay in the hospital for fewer days and require less pain medication than 
patients who do not get a chance to look at green areas and trees but look out onto 
buildings or concrete.
The hospital landscape shall include a peaceful walking path, which shall be 
wide enough and non-slippery, to burn off some stress, rejuvenate, and recuperate.
Plants and fower beds with lavender, roses, tuck rosemary, catnip, sweet marjo￾ram, and sage shall be encouraged. Positioning the trees, plants, and fowers, so they 
are visible from the inside, can be very pleasing to the admitted patients. Fountains 
or small waterfalls can be provided in the common areas, courtyards, and gardens.
As a frst step for landscaping is to level the land and the spaces reserved for the 
lawn. The levelling need not be in the same plane or say zero levelling. The levelling 
can be different for different zones, such as different levels for lawns, fower beds, 
etc. The zoning shall be done as per the specifcations and the drawings provided by 
the landscaping designer.
For irrigation, lay down the irrigation water supply pipeline under the soil. 
Provide suffcient outlets for water supply and fx the taps or valves on these water 
outlets.
Once the levelling is done, the grass shall be planted in the lawns. Before plant￾ing the grass, please prepare the lawn and prepare the lawn bed by putting the 
manure and required sand. Now plant the trees at the selected location. Please 
ensure that the protection cage is provided around the tree sapling so that it is not 
damaged. Plant the fower plants in the fower bed. If required, the artifcial plants 
can also be placed at the selected location.
If designed, construct or provide the fountains at the selected locations. Connect 
the fountains with the water supply for the operation of the fountain.
Complete the landscaping by providing other items such as pathways, sun shel￾ters, birdhouses, lightning, etc.
12.9 Car Parking Lots
See Table 12.9.
While preparing the site plan, the designer shall keep the provision of the car 
parking lots for parking the cars, two-wheelers, and buses that may be arriving in 
the hospital.
While preparing the design of the car parking area, separate spaces shall be allot￾ted for parking cars, two-wheelers, and big vehicles such as buses, trucks, etc., even 
a separate parking area shall be provided for the ambulances arriving in the hospital.
As a frst step for constructing the parking area, level the car parking area. It will 
be better if the whole of the parking area is at the same level.

small canteen or cafeteria inside the parking area, where the drivers can have their 
meals. If possible, provide a small restroom for the drivers in the parking area.
In some of the large hospitals, vehicle movement can be large and a big area may 
be required for parking. Providing such a large area may be diffcult and a costly 
affair due to the heavy costs of land. To this, if the spaces inside the hospital allow 
and the funds are available, multi-level parking can be thought of. The multi-level 
parking shall then be constructed as per the design provided by the designer.

Ancillary Activities and Implementation
To make the hospital operational, all the activities/works must be completed well in 
time. Although, in all the above monitoring tools, we have tried to mention all the 
activities, still some of them are left because there does not relate to any of the par￾ticular department/areas.
Some of such activities are as follows:
Formation of the identity as an owner of the hospital. It can be a sole proprietor, 
partnership frm, charitable trust, private limited company, or the limited company.
Then, there are some ancillary works such as printing of stationery, procurement 
of consumables, linen, medicines, and drugs.
Before giving the go-ahead for operations, the detailed and thorough checking of 
the services is essential to ensure the proper working of such services. Checking 
patient facilities, attendants’ facilities, equipment and instruments, electric supply, 
water supply, IT network, and medical gases is very essential.
Equally important are the approvals, registrations, and licences. Before starting 
the operations, the promoter has to ensure that all the approvals, registrations, and 
licences are obtained from the respective departments/agency and the same shall be 
in compliance with the law of the land.
Once everything is clear, the approval can be given to GO-LIVE.
This set of monitoring tools shall help the planner and designer to remember all 
such activities and ensure compliance well in time.
13.1 Other Ancillary Works

13.2 Facilities for Patients
See Table 13.2.
Every human being in his daily routine performs some activities that become the 
part and parcel of his life. Such activities can be like bed tea in the morning, getting 
fresh, shaving, bathing, and timely diet.
Similarly, all human beings are habitual in using basic facilities such as tele￾phones, refrigerators, air-conditioners, and television in their daily life.
If he/she is deprived of these activities, he/she may feel disturbed.
The same happens when the patient is sick and he/she is admitted to the hospital. 
As he/she is not provided with these facilities, he/she feels disturbed. Just imagine 
if all of these or even some of these facilities are provided to him/her in the hospital 
itself, how satisfed he/she will feel. This satisfaction also helps in the early recov￾ery of the patient.
Hence, the facilities mentioned in the above table shall be provided to the patient.

13.3 Facilities for Attendants
See Table 13.3.
While the patient is admitted to the hospital for treatment and care, the near and 
dear of the patient including friends and relatives are usually afraid and in a dis￾turbed state of mind, which may lead to irrational behaviour. The attendants need to 
be handled tactfully.
The second reason for the disturbance of the attendants can be the lack of facili￾ties for these attendants. If the necessary facilities are provided to these attendants, 
they may feel satisfed with the services of the hospital.
It is a fact that satisfed customers can promote the hospital much more than any 
other marketing technique. When we talk about patient satisfaction levels in the 
hospital, we mean how satisfed the patient is. But in a true sense, the satisfaction of

Just imagine if few facilities are provided to the attendants, where will be their 
satisfaction levels?
Therefore, it is recommended that the facilities mentioned in the above table 
shall be provided to the attendants of the patient. Some of these can be proper wait￾ing spaces, public utilities, drinking water, restrooms, place for meals and refresh￾ments, meeting spaces, meditation spaces, couches or sofa set in the patient’s room, 
and television.

This is the stage where all the departments have given the clearance that every￾thing including all the wards, laboratories, imaging, operating rooms, and emer￾gency are ready for operation and all the pieces of equipment have been installed 
and commissioned.
Once the clearances have been received from the staff, the management has to 
depute a team for the fnal testing of all the equipment and instruments and the trial 
run to be carried out. The team shall check and test every piece of equipment and 
instrument and check the confguration of these items before giving the fnal 
clearances.
Similarly, all the electrical points and the sanitary fttings have to be checked to 
ensure that everything is in place and working properly. This checklist shall be pre￾pared separately for every room.
The entire system of the Central Medical Gas Supply, including manifold, 
pumps, tanks, alarms, valves, outlets, etc., has to be checked and ensured that proper 
pressures are achieved, no leakage is noticed, and all the fttings are in place.
Similarly, all the doors, windows, and furniture have to be checked and ensured 
that they are in place, properly screwed, and all ftting such as handles, stoppers, 
latches, and locks are in place and working.
It also has to be ensured that the Hospital Management Software is working 
properly and that the staff is trained enough to handle the software. If required, a 
few dummy entries can be done in the software to check the authenticity of the 
software and the performance of the staff on the software. Once the software is 
ready, and performance is satisfactory, the dummy entries can be removed and the 
software may be made live.
The whole of these activities have to be recorded and signed by the concerned 
departmental head and the head of the team deputed for checking.
Once checklists are signed, the report shall be submitted to the management, 
along with the checklists, with the recommendation to start the operations of the 
hospital and go live.
13.7 Start and Go

Now is the stage for fnal testing and inspections so that the hospital can be given 
a green signal to start the operations of the hospital.
First of all, the OPDs. Before the start of the OPDs, ensure that each OPD is 
equipped with the required furniture such as a table, chairs, examination couch, and 
the patient stool. Check that all the required instruments such as BP apparatus, stetho￾scope, examination lamp, etc. are readily available. The requirement of the instru￾ments may vary from one OPD to the other and will depend on the discipline for 
which the OPD is to be used. For example, the requirement of the eye OPD may be 
different from that of Ear Nose Throat (ENT) OPD. Check the availability of the con￾sumables and the accessories such as cotton, gauze, thermometer, scissor, and forceps.

Equipment Planning, Procurement, 
Installation and Management
The defnition of equipment varies depending on the context, but in hospitals, it is 
typically understood to mean ‘the machines, items and implements required to 
accomplish specifed activities.’ When analysed for a hospital, the equipment con￾sists of the devices, instruments and processes that make it easier for healthcare 
professionals to conduct diagnostic tests to identify diseases and aid in their treat￾ment. True hospital equipment, as opposed to fxtures and fttings, refers to the 
electronic and mechanical devices used for diagnosis and treatment.
The hospital’s medical equipment includes anything from modest, simple devices 
like sphygmomanometers to large, complicated gadgets like magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) machines. This rating results from variations in the technologies 
used and the intended uses.
Fixed equipment or loose and mobile equipment can be found in hospitals. Fixed 
equipment is generally defned as equipment that is permanently attached to a build￾ing and can include X-ray, CT scan, MRI, mammography, LINAC or a large steril￾iser, among other things. Loose equipment is anything that is not attached to a 
building and can be easily moved to another location as needed. ECG machines, 
monitors, ultrasound machines and surgical instruments are examples of such items.
Similarly, medical equipment and machines can be either electronic or mechani￾cal machinery type. Nowadays, most medical equipment are electronically based, 
and very few are purely mechanical. Though some medical equipment is a combina￾tion of both electronics and mechanical.
As medical equipment is the most vital component in any hospital, it is important 
that hospitals effciently manage their medical equipment to keep their expenditures 
under control as well as ensure the quality of services delivered by the hospital.
The best tool for effcient controlling of medical equipment is ‘Medical 
Equipment Management (MEM).’
If a proper MEM system is implemented in the hospital, it will assist hospitals in 
properly developing, monitoring and managing their equipment, as well as promot￾ing the safe, effective and economical use and maintenance of equipment.308
Responsible organisations should set up and review MEM regularly to ensure 
that a suitable medical device is used following the manufacturer’s instructions, is 
kept in a safe and reliable condition and is disposed of properly at the end of its use￾ful life.
The total MEM consists of nine different stages, which are as follows:
1. Planning of the medical equipment in terms of requirements and specifcations
2. Identifcation of the vendors
3. The procurement process for the medical equipment
4. Preparing the purchase order
5. Inspection of the equipment delivered in terms of quality and quantity
6. Inventory and documentation of the equipment received
7. Installation, commissioning and testing of the equipment
8. User training and certifcation
9. Handing over the equipment
10. Monitoring the performance at regular intervals
11. Maintenance, safety and care of medical equipment
12. Condemnation, disposal and replacement of the equipment
14.1 Planning of the Medical Equipment in Terms 
of Requirements and Specifcations
Hospital planners shall conduct detailed planning and coordination, as well as an 
assessment of clinical needs and equipment requirements before proceeding with 
procurement.
Effcient hospital equipment planning necessitates a thorough understanding of 
clinical requirements as well as detailed knowledge of budgeting, architectural 
design and the construction process.
The ultimate goal of equipment planning is to ensure that all products chosen are 
appropriate for hospital operations, are within the budgeted amount and are pro￾cured, delivered and commissioned within the time frame specifed and following 
project requirements.
While assessing the requirement of the equipment, the following factors should 
be considered:
1. Which all medical departments are to be operative in the hospital? Like General 
Medicine, General Surgery, Paediatric, Gynaecology, Urology, Cardiology, 
Neurology, etc.
2. Which all medical equipment is required for a particular medical department?
3. Which investigations are to be carried out in the hospital?
4. What will be the level of the medical equipment? Will it be a low-ended machine 
or otherwise a high-ended machine?
5. Functionality of equipment.
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management309
6. Frequency of use of the equipment.
7. The fnancial cost of the equipment.
8. Income likely to be generated from the equipment.
9. The useful life of the equipment.
10. Period of return on investment for equipment.
11. Expected technology changes in the equipment.
12. Determine equipment reuse and relocation options.
After conducting interviews with department heads, the planner can understand 
equipment preferences, concerns and priorities. He shall also go over the architec￾tural drawings and details to ensure that all of the building’s elements meet the 
requirements for the equipment to work properly.
A variety of equipment is required in hospitals for the effcient operation of the 
facilities. Some are too small and less expensive, whereas others may require large 
spaces and are more expensive.
The step-wise activities for planning the medical equipment, machinery, instru￾ments and tools are as below (Table 14.1).
The frst activity for procurement of medical equipment, machinery, instruments 
and tools is to access the requirement of such items. Next is the fnalisation of the 
specifcation and confguration of the medical equipment. This has been described 
in Sect. 14.1 of this chapter.
As far as the number of each such medical equipment, machinery, instruments 
and tools to be procured is concerned, it is the planner who has to decide. While 
deciding, the planner has to keep in mind the number and type of beds in the hospi￾tal, the number of patients expected, the type of diseases generally prevailing in the 
area and the uptime of the equipment. The planner is advised to involve the medical 
physician, technicians and the actual users of such items, as they can be the better 
source who can guide the planner to decide the number of such items to be procured.
The planner and the promoter shall decide well in advance about the type of 
medical equipment to be procured. The medical equipment can be hi-tech equip￾ment with the latest technology, which will cost more. The second can be the 
medium-quality equipment, which will be a bit cheaper but the technological 
advancement will be compromised. Third can be the cost-saving equipment, which 
will be low costing but may have the older technologies, which might be obsolete in 
a short period. The planner and promoter have to jointly decide on this issue well in 
advance, considering the issues like budget for such medical equipment, the demand 
of the city where the hospital is located, paying capacity of the patient in that area, 
the type of diseases in the area and of course the fnancial viability of the said 
equipment.
The next issue is the manufacturer of equipment. In today’s world, medical 
equipment is being manufactured around the globe. Apart from foreign manufactur￾ers, indigenous manufacturers are available in most countries. It is the quality of the 
medical equipment which is an important issue. If the quality of indigenous equip￾ment is better, the planner shall decide to choose the same. However, if the quality 
of foreign equipment is better, the same shall be chosen.

14.1.1 General Issues to Be Considered while Planning 
and Purchasing the Medical Equipment
While planning, procuring, installation and commissioning, the following issues 
should be considered carefully.
14.1.1.1 Choosing the Desired Equipment
Once the planner has fnalised the list of equipment to be purchased, he or she shall 
select the desired equipment from the market.
In today’s competitive market, many manufacturers produce the same equipment 
and each manufacturer produces different models of the same equipment. Depending 
on the specifcations, confguration, capacity, size, performance and facilities, 
14.1 Planning of the Medical Equipment in Terms of Requirements and Specifcations312
different models may cost differently. It is up to the planner to determine what is 
required and which model best meets the requirements.
14.1.1.2 Quality of the Equipment
When selecting medical equipment, tools and devices, the quality of these items 
must not be compromised under any circumstances. Look for a vendor with a qual￾ity mindset that prioritises patient safety, product quality and compliance.
All healthcare facilities use a variety of medical equipment and devices, ranging 
from simple equipment to complex machines combined with various technologies. 
Whatever the case may be, the quality of such devices and equipment must be 
ensured and never compromised, even if the cost of such quality equipment is 
slightly higher. The primary factors in favour of quality assurance are as follows:
1. Low-quality products may have faws or malfunctions, exposing patients to seri￾ous risks such as injury, illness and even death.
2. Unstandardised equipment may not have been calibrated following standards, 
resulting in incorrect results and the physician’s inability to properly diagnose 
the ailment.
3. Quality products are generally safe and free of unacceptable risks to people, 
property or the environment.
4. Medical equipment and devices are subject to extensive rules and regulations all 
over the world, and there are a variety of different standards and regulation sys￾tems to follow. As a result, medical equipment and devices must meet the stan￾dards of regulating authorities such as the United States’s Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA); QSR to ensure product performance and safety; Standard 
ISO 13485 supplements the Medical Device Directive and so on.
5. It is true that if the quality of medical equipment and devices meets the estab￾lished standards, the equipment will last longer as compared to the nonstandard 
equipment and devices.
6. Quality equipment and devices will have lower repair and maintenance costs 
than others.
14.1.2 Points to Be Considered While Planning 
the Medical Equipment
As medical equipment is generally a costly proposition and is usually a one-time 
purchase, and buying being a tedious task, a lot of care, knowledge and skills are 
required for buying the medical equipment. Therefore, before fnalizing the pur￾chase of any medical equipment/machinery, the following few issues shall be con￾sidered and evaluated in detail.
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management313
14.1.2.1 Assessing the Requirement of the Medical Equipment
First of all, the list of medical equipment, instruments, tools and machinery required 
in the proposed hospital has to be prepared. While preparing this list, the factors like 
medical departments planned to be operative in the hospital; type of investigations 
to be provided in the hospital; type of surgeries to be undertaken in the hospital and 
other services to be made available in the hospital should be considered carefully.
After conducting interviews with department heads, the planner shall understand 
equipment preferences, concerns and priorities. He shall also go over the architec￾tural drawings and details to ensure that all of the building’s elements meet the 
requirements for the equipment to work properly.
14.1.2.2 Finalising the Specifcation and Confguration of Equipment
Once the list of the medical equipment, instruments, tools and machinery is fnal￾ised, the next step is to decide and fnalise the specifcations and confguration of all 
such items as mentioned in the list.
While fnalising the specifcation and confguration of the equipment, the medi￾cal professionals and/or the concerned technicians of the machines shall be taken 
into confdence and his/her requirements shall be considered carefully. It is fact that 
one particular medical equipment may have a different technical specifcation in 
different models, e.g. let us take the case of an ultrasound machine. This machine 
may have different platforms like radiology, gynaecology or cardiology. Again, for 
each platform, different types of transducers are available. Similarly, different mod￾els may have different software and facilities.
Now, it is up to the user and the planner as to what he/she exactly wants. The 
fnalisation of the specifcations and confguration requires a lot of skill and knowl￾edge and has to be done very carefully. If at this stage of planning, any errors are 
committed or if the planning is defective may lead to severe problems in future 
because medical equipment being a costly affair cannot be changed frequently. The 
hospital will be forced to bear with it, which may have an adverse effect on the 
services of the hospital.
The planner must consider the most recent technology and specifcations avail￾able in the market when fnalising the specifcation and confguration of the equip￾ment. The reason we insist on the most recent technology is that in today’s world, 
technologies change quickly and current technology may become obsolete in a few 
years. Adopting older technologies may make it diffcult for the hospital to compete 
with those that use cutting-edge technology. In such a case, the hospital will have no 
choice but to replace the equipment in a few years.
Another important factor while fnalising the specifcations is the cost of such 
medical equipment and its fnancial feasibility. It is the planner who has to balance 
the latest technology vs fnancial feasibility. However, a careful comparison must be 
made between the increased costs of newer equipment and the hospital’s technology 
requirements.
14.1 Planning of the Medical Equipment in Terms of Requirements and Specifcations314
14.2 Identifcation of the Vendor of Medical Equipment
After fnalising the specifcation and confguration of the medical equipment, that 
has to be purchased, the vendors who manufacturers or supplies the equipment with 
such specifcations have to be identifed.
There can be different sources to identify the vendors like personal contacts, 
internet surfng, advertisement in the print media or social media, enquiry from 
other hospitals and directories provided by different agencies.
While identifying the vendors, the following issues shall be kept in mind.
14.2.1 Warranty
Choose the vendor or manufacturer that offers the longest warranty period. The 
longer the warranty period, the less worried hospital administrators are about equip￾ment maintenance.
14.2.2 Maintenance Contracts
Many equipment manufacturers offer an Annual Maintenance Contract. The main￾tenance contract can include or exclude spare components. The maintenance con￾tract without spares is known as AMC, and the maintenance contract with spares is 
known as CMC (Comprehensive Maintenance Contract). It is preferable to select 
CMC over AMC because it allows hospital management to be less concerned about 
the cost of spares that need to be replaced. Select vendors who can offer better main￾tenance contract terms and conditions.
In some cases, the hospital chooses to pay an insurance company rather than the 
service provider directly. The insurance company then contacts a medical equip￾ment support service provider. If that is the case, when selecting vendors, the same 
shall be clarifed with the vendor, if he/she is willing to do so.
14.2.3 Availability of the Workshops and Service Engineers
Before procurement, the planner must ensure that the vendor has their own work￾shop and a team of engineers nearby so that the breakdown call can be attended to 
in the shortest time possible. Furthermore, the preventive maintenance schedule can 
be followed regularly. Besides that, it must be ensured that the vendors keep 
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management315
suffcient stock of the machine’s spare parts to repair it without having to call for the 
spare parts from a different location, which may result in a time delay and increase 
the machine’s downtime. As a result, discourage the vendor from a distinct location.
14.2.4 Period of Spare Part Availability
Before procurement, the planner must ensure that the vendors will be able to pro￾vide spare parts for the equipment for the specifed period or years. This period shall 
not be less than 10  years. Avoid such vendors or manufacturers who provide a 
shorter period for spares availability or a shorter duration of the service period.
14.2.5 Cost of Consumables
Some medical equipment, such as laboratory analysers, require consumables to 
function properly on a daily basis. Before purchasing the equipment, the cost of 
such consumables must be checked and compared to the cost of other vendors. 
Some laboratory equipment are designed using closed system technology (meaning 
that reagents from the same manufacturer can be used), while others are open sys￾tem (reagents of any make can be used). It is preferable to use an open system rather 
than a closed system because otherwise the hospital will have to rely solely on the 
same supplier for reagents, who can charge whatever he/she wants. Choose a vendor 
who can provide consumables at a lower cost; otherwise, the cost per test will rise, 
reducing the hospital’s margins.
14.2.6 Life Expectancy of the Equipment
The expected life of the equipment shall be ensured before purchase. In addition, an 
assessment of technological changes and improvements in the design or specifca￾tions of the equipment shall be assessed. Select the vendors or manufacturers who 
can provide more life expectancy of the equipment.
14.2.7 Vendors Evaluation
Planners must investigate the vendor’s track record in terms of the quality of after￾sales service, effciency, spare part availability, infrastructure for after-sales service 
and so on.
14.2 Identifcation of the Vendor of Medical Equipment316
14.2.8 Checking Regulations
Some of the equipment are bound by local building code regulations, controlling author￾ities, accreditation agencies, other norms and regulations of the federal and state legisla￾tures, and industry standards that the equipment must conform to. As a result, select 
vendors or manufacturers who adhere to the established standards and are certifed.
14.2.9 Assistance in Getting the Licenses or Approvals
Some of the equipment requires approval for operations like approval for operating 
the X-ray machine from the regulatory authority, or say providing a nuclear scan 
may require licensing, etc. Hence, choose the vendors or manufacturers who can 
assist the hospital in applying for and getting such licenses.
14.3 Procurement of the Medical Equipment
Once the vendors are identifed, now is the stage where the hospital can start the 
process of procurement. The steps involved in procurement are:
14.3.1 Inviting Financial and Techno-Commercial Quotations
After tracing out the vendors, the next step is to ask the vendor for detailed fnancial 
and techno-commercial quotations.
As far as the technical part of the quotation is concerned, the quotation shall 
clearly contain the details about the item name, make, model, detailed technical 
specifcations of the equipment, technical data sheet, the catalogue of the equip￾ment, comparison of the technical features with that of other manufacturers and 
pros and cons of his/her equipment.
Regarding the fnancial part of the quotation, the quotation shall contain the 
details of price, taxes, delivery period, packing, insurance and transport cost, war￾ranty, charges for a maintenance contract, installation cost, terms of payment, etc.
14.3.2 Comparative Statement of Financial 
and Techno-Commercial Quotations
After receiving the fnancial and techno-commercial quotation from the manufac￾turers or the vendors, two comparative sheets shall be prepared to have a sum￾marised view of the costing vis-à-vis the technical parameters of various vendors or 
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management317
manufacturers. One sheet is for the technical comparison, and the other is for the 
fnancial comparison. The format of such a comparative sheet can be like Tables 
14.2 and 14.3.
After or during the preparation of the technical and fnancial comparative sheets, 
the manufacturers or the vendors may be asked to provide the user lists of those who 
are actually using the said equipment. This user list shall have the name of the user, 
the concerned person’s name and the contact details. Based on this user list, the 
purchaser shall contact the concerned user and ask him/her about the satisfaction 
and performance of the equipment, services of the vendor or manufacturers, eff￾ciency in providing service by the manufacturer/vendor and other issues like reputa￾tion of the vendor etc.

14.3.3 Demonstration of the Equipment
Once confrmed and satisfed, the manufacturer or the vendor may be asked for a 
demonstration of the equipment. The vendor shall demonstrate the machine at the 
purchaser’s premises or at the place of another user.
14.3.4 Discussion and Negotiations
If everything is affrmative and the hospital is satisfed with the equipment and ser￾vices of the manufacturer/vendor, he/she may be called for further discussion and 
negotiations. The negotiations shall be carried out on the issues like changes in 
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management319
specifcations, price, taxes, transportation, warranty, maintenance contract, delivery 
period, installation and commissioning, the penalty for delay, dispute dissolu￾tion, etc.
Once the fnal negotiations have been concluded, the concluded points shall be 
recorded in the minutes of the meeting and signed by both parties. This is the stage 
where both parties have fnalised the deal.
14.3.5 Preparing the Purchase Order
The next step is to prepare the purchase order. The purchase order is a fnal docu￾ment wherein both the parties, i.e. the purchaser and the manufacturer/vendor, are 
bound with. Hence, the purchase order being an important document shall be pre￾pared in detail and shall be exhaustive. A complete description of preparing the 
purchase order has been given below in this chapter in Sect. 14.4.
Once the purchase order is prepared, checked and signed, the same shall be 
delivered to the manufacturer/vendor and the acceptance of the purchase order shall 
be taken from him/her.
The next step shall be paying the advance to the manufacturer/vendor against the 
accepted purchase order.
14.4 Purchase Order and its Contents
After all the specifcations, costing and other terms and conditions of the purchase 
are fnalised and settled, the purchase order shall be prepared.
The purchase order (PO) is an important document and once signed and accepted 
by the vendors, it becomes binding on both parties. The terms and conditions as 
detailed in the purchase order bind both parties for a long period as long as the 
machine/equipment is being used in the hospital.
Hence, the purchase order shall be drafted very carefully, and each sentence and 
word shall be carefully mentioned to keep binding both parties.
On acceptance by the vendor, the purchase order becomes a sort of agreement for 
the supply and fulfls all the terms and conditions of the purchase order.
The purchase order shall normally have the following conditions.
14.4.1 Purchase Order Number
The PO number shall be mentioned on the top of the purchase order and may be on 
the left-hand side.
14.4 Purchase Order and its Contents320
14.4.2 Purchase Order Date
The date of the PO shall also be mentioned on the top of the PO and maybe on the 
right-hand side
14.4.3 Name of the Vendor
The PO shall be addressed to the manufacturer/vendor along with the detailed off￾cial address. Sometimes, the manufacturer may supply equipment through their 
offcial dealer or distributors. In such a case, the PO shall be addressed to the origi￾nal manufacturer and after that mention ‘Supplies Through _________.’
14.4.4 Details of the Items
To mention the item number/code, quantity, rate and amount of the equipment, 
insert the table in the purchase order containing details of all the items like
1. Serial number of the items.
2. Item number/code number of the item or part thereof.
3. Mention the detailed name of all the items in this table, even if it is part of the 
total equipment.
4. Quantity of that particular item.
5. Rate of that particular item.
6. Amount towards that item.

purchase of the equipment. If these taxes and duties are included in the price, men￾tion them as ‘Inclusive of Taxes.’
If the taxes and duties are to be paid extra, please mention ‘Taxes and duties to 
be paid extra at actuals.’
It may also happen that at the time of the actual supply of material, the Government 
levies any additional taxes or otherwise increase/decrease the tax rates. At the time 
of placing the purchase order, it shall be decided and clearly mentioned in the pur￾chase order as to who will bear the liability against increase or decrease in taxes.
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management321
14.4.6 Technical Details
Mention full technical details of the equipment to be purchased. Give the detailed 
technical confguration as has been fnalised along with the accessories and soft￾ware fnalised along with the equipment. These technical details will help to bind 
the vendor for providing all the items with the same technical specifcations as has 
been mentioned in the order.
14.4.7 Currency Fluctuations
At the time, it happens that the equipment for which the order has been placed may 
not be manufactured in the home country and may have to be imported from other 
country/countries. Importing involves foreign currency transactions. In today’s 
world, currency conversion rates fuctuate very frequently. Due to this, the rates of 
equipment may also fuctuate. Hence, at the time of fnalizing the deal, it shall 
clearly be decided as to who will bear such currency fuctuation costs. The same 
shall be recorded in the purchase order.
14.4.8 Delivery and Installation Period
The purchase order shall clearly defne the issues relating to the delivery and instal￾lation of the equipment. The following issues need to be addressed for delivery and 
installation.
1. Specify the exact place of delivery and mention the address of the location along 
with the postal code and landmark.
2. Clearly specify the date by which the material will be delivered and installed.
3. If needed, the penalty clause for delayed delivery of installation can be imposed 
and mentioned in the purchase order.
4. Specify the issues relating to the transport documentation and approvals as to 
how and who will arrange them.
5. Clearly mention as to who will bear the cost of packing, forwarding, insurance, 
transportation, loading and unloading.

shall be one in English and the other in the local language.
14.4.9 Installation and Commissioning
As installation and commissioning are the responsibility of the vendor/manufac￾turer, the terms related to installation and commissioning shall be clearly defned in 
the purchase order. The following issues need to be addressed,
1. Clearly fx the responsibility of the vendor/manufacturer to install and commis￾sion the equipment.
2. Mention about the charges for installation and commissioning as to who will 
bear the cost of same.
3. Defne who will be responsible for transporting the equipment within the hospi￾tal to the installation site, opening the packages and installing it following the 
installation requirements.
4. After installation, the vendor must be held responsible for cleaning up any pack￾aging/shipping material and original boxes must be left with the purchaser for 
disposal.
5. The vendor/installer shall instal the equipment while taking into account the 
hospital’s construction characteristics.
6. Defne the vendor’s liability for any damage to hospital structures or fnishing 
caused during installation.
7. Mention in the purchase order that the vendor must test, calibrate and commis￾sion the equipment/machinery so that it is fully operational and ready to use after 
the completion of installation. The purchaser retains the right to observe the 
vendor’s testing and commissioning without relieving the vendor of his obliga￾tion to provide goods in fully operational condition.
8. Following the fnal receipt of the equipment, the purchaser shall be given a com￾plete set of commissioning forms, including the entire set of tests run and the 
results obtained.
14.4.10 Payment Terms
While fnalizing the deal, the payment terms shall be clearly settled down and 
clearly mentioned in the purchase order. The amount either in fgures or percentages 
shall be mentioned. Generally, some token advance is released along with the order 
and part payment after delivery, after installation and the last payment after success￾ful commissioning and handing over the equipment. However, if the payment terms 
are through a Letter of Credit (LC), no advance is required to be paid, just opening 
an LC will do.
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management323

14.4.16 Period to Attend After-Sale Service
The period required to attend any complaint during the warranty period shall be 
decided at the time of placing the purchase order and shall be mentioned in the PO.
14.4.17 Financial Guarantee Against Post-Sale Service
As a fnancial commitment, the vendor shall be bound to provide a kind of fnancial 
commitment against the performance of the post-sales service. It is rightly said that 
‘there is no commitment if fnance is not involved.’ This commitment can either be 
in the shape of a bank guarantee to be provided by the vendor or otherwise a reten￾tion amount which can be paid after the warranty period. The fnancial commitment 
can be a percentage of the total purchase order value like 10% of the invoice value.
14.4.18 Availability of Spares
During fnalization, a written undertaking shall be taken from the manufacturer or 
the authorised agent of the manufacturer regarding the number of years during 
which the spare part and maintenance service shall be made available. Even the 
penalty clause can be added that in case the manufacturer fails to provide spares, the 
manufacturer or the vendor shall be liable to pay the mentioned penalty.
14.4.19 Testing and Handing Over
Once the commissioning is over, the installation team shall conduct self-testing to 
ensure the proper functioning of the machine. Before transferring the ownership, 
the following issues need to be attended to and clearly mentioned in the pur￾chase order:
1. The equipment shall be inspected and tested by the Biomedical Engineer.
2. Following that, the equipment shall be tested on dummies and phantoms.
14.4 Purchase Order and its Contents326
3. Before giving the fnal approval, issues such as electrical safety inspection and 
radiation safety shall be addressed during testing.
4. The vendor/installer shall provide the purchaser with a written letter requesting 
offcial testing and commissioning.
5. Following the installation phase, the purchaser shall evaluate, item by item, the 
consistency of the goods and services supplied following the contract conditions 
and technical specifcations.
6. Offcial testing and commissioning are considered successful when all items of 
equipment function properly.
7. The hospital shall have all the right to inspect the delivered goods, including 
checking their quantity and integrity.
8. Once all the equipment is functioning properly, quantities and quality of equip￾ment are ascertained, all the terms and conditions are fulflled and the training 
has been provided, the hospital shall fnally take the handing over of the equip￾ment from the vendor.
14.4.20 Annual Maintenance or Comprehensive 
Maintenance Contract
At the time of discussions and negotiations with the vendor, the maintenance con￾tracts shall be fnalised for 10 years after/or (whichever the case may be) including 
the warranty period. All the details relating to the AMC/CMC (whichever the case 
may be), shall be specifcally mentioned in the PO. The details shall include the type 
of maintenance contract, number of years for which the contract is fnalised, amount 
to be paid annually, escalation of maintenance amount on a year-to-year basis, taxes 
to be paid, signing of the contract on a year-to-year basis, inclusion and exclusion 
in the maintenance contract, etc.
Usually, for AMC/CMC, the agreement is signed between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer/vendor every year on a year-to-year basis. It is advised that while 
placing the PO, a copy of the draft agreement of such AMC/CMC shall be asked 
from the manufacturer/vendor. This copy of the agreement shall be checked thor￾oughly, particularly the terms relating to the inclusion and exclusions of the spares, 
parts, accessories, maintenance kits, etc. After discussion with the manufacturer/
vendor settle the terms and conditions of the AMC/CMC agreement. It is also 
advised to make this agreement a part and parcel of the PO, so that the manufac￾turer/vendor and hospital are bound by these terms and conditions of AMC/CMC.
At times, it happens that the purchaser purchases the equipment from the dealer 
and the dealer himself/herself approves the AMC/CMC. However, down the years, 
the original manufacturer refuses to give the AMC/CMC support. The manufacturer 
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management327
gives the plea that the dealer has not taken any consent from the manufacturer for 
AMC/CMC support. Hence, if the purchase is being done from the dealer of the 
manufacturer, insist on the AMC/CMC approval from the original manufacturer of 
the equipment or otherwise enter into a triparty agreement with the dealer and origi￾nal manufacturer of the equipment.
Please be aware that this maintenance clause will be applicable and binding on 
both parties till the agreed tenure of the maintenance contract. Hence while men￾tioning this clause in the PO, utmost care shall be given and the words and language 
carefully drafted.
14.4.21 Government or Regulatory Approvals
Through the condition in the PO, the vendor shall be bound to arrange for the 
required approvals from the Government or the Regulatory authorities. In case, off￾cially it has to be done by the purchaser, the vendors shall be at obligation to help 
out the hospital in obtaining such approvals.
14.4.22 Other Conditions
If any specifc condition relating to the equipment has been agreed upon during the 
discussion or negotiations with the vendor, the same shall be mentioned in the PO.
14.4.23 Up-Gradation Clause
The vendor shall be made bound to upgrade the equipment including software that 
is available from time to time with the manufacturers. Please try to negotiate with 
the manufacturer/vendor and mention that this service of upgradation shall be 
free of cost and nothing needs to be paid against such service.
14.4.24 Dispute Dissolution
The procedure for dissolution of the dispute shall be agreed upon by both parties 
and the same shall be mentioned in the PO. This procedure shall be binding on both 
parties.

14.4 Purchase Order and its Contents332 14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management333
14.5 Inspection of the Equipment Delivered in Terms 
of Quality and Quantity
14.5.1 Inspection of the Material at the Time of Delivery
As soon as the packages containing the equipment arrive at the site, the Biomedical 
Department of the hospital shall inspect such packages. First, they shall count the 
number of packages and compare it with the numbers mentioned in the invoice and 
delivery challans. Second, they shall also ensure that all the packages are intact and 
none of them is broken, damaged or opened.
If everything is in order, he/she shall give a receipt of the same to the transporter. 
If any shortage is noticed or if any of the packages are found to be broken, damaged 
or opened, he/she shall immediately inform the vendor in writing and shall not issue 
any receipt of the material to the transporter.
Once the material is received, the Biomedical Department shall arrange for the 
safe custody of the material at the site. Please ensure that the material is kept in a 
lockable enclosure and protected from rain or sunlight.
It shall be strictly ensured that nobody, including the Biomedical Department, 
shall open any of the packages or boxes that have been received from the vendor. 
Why we stress this issue is that while opening the packages or boxes if any of the 
equipment, or part thereof is found to be broken, damaged or missing, the vendor 
might put the onus on the hospital for such damage or shortage. Opening of the 
packages or the boxes is the responsibility of the installation team of the vendor.
14.5.2 Inspection of the Material at the Time of Installation
Once the installation team arrives at the site for the installation of the equipment, 
frst of all, the Biomedical Department shall hand over all the packages and boxes, 
as were received from the transporter to the installation team under the written 
receipt.
Now, it is the responsibility of the installation to open the packages and the 
boxes. These boxes shall be opened in front of the Biomedical Department of the 
hospital. Please ensure that a quick check is not enough, and a detailed inspection is 
needed to avoid problems in the future.
Once the packages and the boxes are opened, the Biomedical Department of the 
hospital shall check the incoming equipment carefully for any possible shipping 
damage to the material. He/she shall verify that the equipment or part thereof is not 
damaged or broken. He/she shall also verify the number of items in the packages/
boxes, accessories, manuals, consumables and kits that may have been supplied 
with the equipment.
The Biomedical Department shall compare all these items with the purchase 
order and shall ensure that all the items have been supplied as was ordered and 
14.5 Inspection of the Equipment Delivered in Terms of Quality and Quantity334
complies with the specifcations as mentioned in the purchase order. If there is any 
shortage or any of the items are found to be damaged, broken or missing, or mis￾matched, he/she shall inform the vendor immediately in writing.
Another important issue that the Biomedical Engineer shall be vigilant of is that 
he/she shall ensure that the equipment supplied is brand new (if re-furbished equip￾ment is not purchased). To ensure himself/herself, he/she shall check the labels and 
stickers on the equipment containing the date of manufacturing or shipping from the 
original manufacturers. The vendors may supply the used equipment of the demo 
piece of equipment. If the Biomedical Engineer is intelligent enough, he/she may 
easily trace it out by checking the cleanliness of the equipment, scratches on the 
equipment, etc. If any irregularity is noticed, the installation process may be halted 
and the vendors shall be called for to take clarifcations.
14.6 Inventory and Documentation 
of the Equipment Received
Once the inspection of the equipment is completed, the Equipment Record File 
should be created both in physical mode and electronic mode. This fle shall contain 
every minute detail of the equipment right from the purchase order, store receipt 
details, issue details, installation, commissioning, testing, training, warranty, main￾tenance, preventive checks, log sheet, equipment ideal time, repairs history, repair 
expense, contact person of the vendor for repairs and service, etc.
This fle shall be open and active for the entire life of the equipment. Once the 
equipment is condemned and disposed of, the fle shall be closed and stored.
The hospital may have different types of medical equipment and each type may 
be in large quantities, e.g. the quantity of Multipara monitors may be large. Each 
item has a different serial number and may be placed in different departments of the 
hospital. Therefore, a ‘Unique Identifcation Number’ shall be allotted to every 
piece of equipment in the hospital. This number shall be marked in such a style that 
it gives details of the type of equipment, location, installation date etc.
Let us take an example: Suppose the Invasive Ventilator is installed in the ICU on 
12th May 2022 by ABC hospital, the unique ID shall be ABC/BME/ICU/
VEN/2021–22/001. Here,
ABC means: Name of Institute.
BME means: Biomedical Engineering.
ICU means: Location of the equipment.
VEN means: Invasive Ventilator.
2021–22 means: Year of Installation.
001 means: Item number in terms of the total quantity of a particular type of 
equipment.
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management335
The Equipment Record File shall generally contain documents and informa￾tion like
1. An Equipment Unique Identifcation Number (UIN).
2. Name of the equipment.

26. Details of disposal of the equipment after the end of life.
14.7 Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of the Equipment
The most important part of the entire equipment planning, procurement and man￾agement is the installation of the equipment. A lot of planning is required before 
placing the order for the equipment and after placing the order for the equipment.
While the delivery of the equipment is awaited, it is time to prepare the site 
where the equipment has to be installed. Depending on the requirement of the 
equipment, the preparation may include the construction of the foundation, 
14.7 Installation, Commissioning and Testing of the Equipment336
providing electrical, water, and gas supply lines, environmental control like air￾conditioning and humidity, lightening of the room, etc. Detailed issues for the 
installation, commissioning and testing of the equipment are given below.
14.7.1 Proper Location of Installation
While planning for the procurement of medical equipment, the location where it has 
to be installed shall also be fnalised. Each medical equipment may have a specifed 
area or department where it has to be used. Hence, it is advised to install that equip￾ment in that particular area only. For example, let us take the case of a CT scan or 
say MRI, as these are heavy machines, preferably shall be installed on the ground 
foor and in the department of radiology. It is still important because the delivery 
and unloading of the machines can be done direct-to-site where it has to be installed.
14.7.2 Area Requirement
The area required for medical equipment shall be planned well in advance while 
planning the layout of the hospital building. This is important because some of the 
medical equipment may require a certain defned area in terms of room size etc. 
Why it is so? There are various reasons for this.
First, the size of the medical equipment matters. For the size of the equipment, it 
will be better if the dimensions of the machine vis-à-vis the room size required are 
taken from the original manufacturer of the equipment.
Second, the service or attached rooms for the equipment. Some medical equip￾ment may require an attached service room, e.g. MRI requires the machine panel 
room, UPS room and the space for a chiller. Hence, it is advised that before fnalis￾ing the layout plan of the hospital, it will be better if the original manufacturer of the 
equipment is contacted and the requirement of such service/attached is taken 
from them.
Third, the operational area. Each medical equipment may require some opera￾tional area like a movement room etc. Such area shall be planned well in advance.
Next is the rules, regulation and guidelines of the regulatory authorities of the 
Government of the respective state of the country. E.g. for the installation of the 
nuclear scan equipment, the government may have certain regulations and guide￾lines, etc. Hence, the area planning shall be done considering all such regulations or 
guidelines.
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management337
14.7.3 Power Supply Requirements for Electrical 
Medical Devices
Mostly all medical equipment needs an electrical power supply to operate the equip￾ment. This power requirement may differ from one piece of equipment to other. 
Further, the source of the power supply may be different like supply from main 
electrical lines, a special separate power source or an internal one, such as a battery 
etc. Hence, while planning for the power supply of equipment, detailed equipment￾wise assessment is essential and this exercise shall be done well in advance. As the 
requirement of the power supply/electricity may vary from one piece of equipment 
to others in terms of electrical load requirement, voltage, ground earthing etc., it is 
advised to contact the original manufacturer of the equipment regarding such 
requirement of the power supply.
While planning for the power/electrical requirement, the following issues shall 
be considered and taken care of
1. The requirement shall specify the maximum rated mains voltage required for 
the equipment.
2. The range of the acceptable limits of voltage fuctuation shall be considered.
3. Similarly, the acceptable range of frequency of power shall be considered.
4. Because the majority of problems in this area involve the plugs, sockets and 
cables that supply electrical power, it is critical that:
A convenient and safe socket outlet should be provided to plug in the 
equipment.
As there are all the chances of water spillage on the electrical socket, it is 
advised that the socket outlets should be at least 2 m away from a sink or 
wash basin. If not possible, some kind of partitions shall be provided to 
avoid water spillage.
The capacity of the electrical socket outlet should be adequate to handle the 
load of the equipment.
All three pin sockets shall be properly grounded by providing the earthing. 
Two pin sockets need not be earthed.
The capacity of the plugs attached to the equipment supply cable shall match 
the socket outlets.
5. Since wiring of the electrical circuits is one of the most critical aspects of elec￾tricity/power supply, the following issues shall be addressed while laying the 
wiring and cables.
The size and capacity of the cables and wires shall be adequate to handle the 
load of the equipment. Under capacity or over capacity is not suggested.
The wiring of a plug is colour-coded to help guard against electrical acci￾dents. The colour codes of the wiring shall be maintained as per the rules, 
regulations and guidelines of the respective state of the country.
14.7 Installation, Commissioning and Testing of the Equipment338
The main cable and wires supplying electricity/power to the equipment shall 
be properly insulated and shall be freproof or at least fre retarded.
No bare metal or internal coloured wire should be used.
All the cables or the wire shall be underground. If the cable and wires are 
laid in the wall, the chase cutting shall be done on the walls, the conduit laid 
down and then the cable/wires shall pass through the conduit. Similarly, if 
the cable and wire are laid under the foor, they should also pass through the 
conduit.
Open wires and cables are not advisable, if the cable or wires are laid above 
the false ceiling, the same shall be through the conduit.
Conduits can either be made of metal or other fre retarded material.
The shortest possible fexible leads shall be used because long leads are 
harmful.
6. Ground earthing is one of the biggest safety features for any medical equip￾ment. Hence, it is suggested that all the major equipment shall be properly 
earthed. Heavy equipment like MRI or CT scan may require double earth￾ing also.
Electrical devices like UPS etc. may also require separate ground earthing.
If equipment is housed in a metal case, the earthing of that metal case is also 
necessary.
All the Distribution Boards (DBs) shall also be earthed.
7. The Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs) or fuses shall be of the specifed and 
correct rating and underrating or overrating MCBs or fuses shall not be used, as 
there are chances of getting the equipment damaged.
8. The voltage shall be constant, and the voltage fuctuation shall be within the 
acceptable range.
9. As most of the medical equipment are electronic, there are all the chances of 
electronic circuits of equipment being damaged because of the sudden spikes in 
the AC current. Hence, to achieve a pure Sine Wave of current, the Spike 
Bursters shall be installed at the main supply panels like the main switch panel, 
foor panels, servo stabilizers or the UPS.
10. It is advised that the hospital can arrange for a pre-installation Electrical Safety 
Inspection by a government-approved agency.
14.7.4 Positioning of the Medical Equipment
Equipment placement should always be given a thoughtful consideration. The 
below issues shall be addressed carefully:
1. Equipment should be positioned in dry, clean, well-ventilated areas on a sturdy 
level base and prevent damp situations.
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management339
2. Extension leads shall be avoided, and equipment shall be placed as close as fea￾sible to the electrical supply outlet.
3. If the equipment is to be positioned on the ground, a proper foundation shall be 
provided. Particular care shall be taken for heavy equipment like Linear accel￾erators, MRI or CT scan. As these equipment are very heavy, the foundation 
shall be designed in such a fashion that it can easily take the load of the equip￾ment. Before designing the foundation, it is advisable that the details of such 
foundation may be taken from the original manufacturer of the equipment.
4. The equipment shall be properly screwed to the foundation. If required, the 
vibration pads shall be used.
5. If the equipment is tabletop type, proper shelves or countertops shall be provided.
6. Proper furniture shall be provided for the equipment or accessories if required, 
like a computer table for computers and printers etc.
7. The room where the equipment has to be installed shall be properly painted.
8. The room or the area where the equipment is to be installed shall be lockable and 
the entry of an unauthorised person shall be restricted.
9. Interior of the room shall be pleasant and soothing. No fast colours shall be used.
14.7.5 Environmental Conditions
Environmental conditions include air-conditioning and humidity control. For eff￾cient working and the long life of the equipment, environmental control is neces￾sary. Hence, the below factors shall be taken care of:
1. Provide comfortable climatic conditions for patients and equipment.
2. Usually, the temperature in the room shall be between 22 °C and 24 °C. However, 
some equipment may require still lower temperatures. Therefore, it is advised 
that the original manufacturer of the equipment shall be contacted for details of 
the temperature in the room.
3. Similarly, the humidity in the room shall be between 50%rh and 60%rh. However, 
some equipment may require still lower or higher humidity levels. As humidity 
level can be one of the main causes of equipment being damaged, controlled 
humidity levels are very important. Therefore, it is advised that the original man￾ufacturer of the equipment shall be contacted for details of the humidity levels in 
the room.
4. Use air flters if required or if recommended by the original manufacturers of the 
equipment.
14.7.6 Other Issues
There are a few other issues which need to be addressed before preparing for the 
installation of the equipment. Some of them are
14.7 Installation, Commissioning and Testing of the Equipment340
1. Some of the equipment may require a supply of normal water for its operations, 
like a water supply for cleaning the endoscopes. Hence, the water supply shall be 
provided near the equipment.
2. Similarly, some of the equipment like dialysis may require demineralised water, 
purifed water, distilled water or water free from any microorganism. Hence, as 
per needs, the arrangements of water supply shall be provided by installing the 
demineralisation plant, reverse osmosis plant, distil water plant, etc.
3. There can also be a requirement for the drain lines near the equipment, the same 
shall be provided as per the requirement.
4. Some equipment like Invasive Ventilators may require compressed medical air 
for operation. The same shall be provided with either form the central medical 
gas pipeline system of the standalone air compressor.
5. Some of the equipment may require different gases for its operation, e.g. Invasive 
Ventilators require oxygen, CO2 laser or insuffators require carbon dioxide and 
anaesthesia workstations require nitrous oxide for their functioning. Hence, as 
per the requirement, the arrangement of the respective gas shall be done near the 
equipment.
14.7.7 Installation of the Equipment
Once the hospital is ready with the installation requirement, the clearance shall be 
given to the manufacturer/vendor to install the equipment, who in turn shall arrange 
to install the equipment. During installation, the following issues shall be 
taken care of
1. Once the delivered packages and boxes containing the equipment and accesso￾ries are opened, the inspection is done and the material shall be moved to the 
location of installation safely.
2. During installation the representative of the hospital, preferrable the Biomedical 
Engineer shall always be present at the site throughout the installation period.
3. The Biomedical Engineer shall ensure that the equipment is placed on the foun￾dation properly and screwed to the foundations. He/she shall ensure that there is 
no vibration due to inappropriate installation.
4. Biomedical Engineer shall ensure that the equipment is assembled correctly and 
as per the laid down standards.
5. Biomedical Engineer shall ensure that all the accessories are properly connected

9. Make sure to clear the area where the medical equipment is located of all pack￾ing materials and other trash. By doing this, you can guarantee that the workers 
who will be utilising the equipment frequently have a tidy, functional environ￾ment. It also guards against pollution and other workplace accidents.
14.7.8 Commissioning and Testing of the Equipment
Next is the commissioning and testing of the equipment. The manufacturer/vendor 
shall carry out the testing of the equipment, as per the testing protocol of the 
equipment.
During commissioning, in some of the equipment, the software needs to be acti￾vated and registered. The Biomedical Engineer shall ensure that all such registra￾tions are done and the software is working properly.
The medical apparatus should be functionally evaluated after assembly. 
Sometimes, even if everything seems to be working properly, there might be an 
invisible issue. Testing can reveal assembly errors in addition to equipment issues 
before any permanent damage occurs.
During testing, the Biomedical Engineer shall ensure that all the tests are per￾formed on the phantoms if required or on dummy patients if required.
It is necessary that the number of tests shall not be limited and shall be performed 
till the desired results are achieved.
14.7.9 Installation and Testing Reports
Once the equipment is tested, the manufacturer/vendor shall submit the installation, 
commissioning and testing report to the purchaser.

installation team of the vendor/manufacturer. The report shall be prepared on the 
letter pad of the vendor/manufacturer.
The installation report shall be signed by both the parties, i.e. by the hospital 
authorities (on the recommendation of the Biomedical Engineer) and the head of the 
installation team.
This report is prepared in duplicate. The frst and original copy shall be handed 
over to the hospital, and the second copy shall be retained by the installation team, 
later to be submitted to the vendor or manufacturer.
Along with the installation report, the vendor/manufacturer shall provide the 
quality assurance certifcates. Three such quality assurance certifcates shall be pro￾vided, which are IQ, OQ and PQ. Here,
IQ means—Installation Qualifcation (IQ)
OQ means—Operational Qualifcation (OQ)
PQ means—Performance Qualifcation (PQ)
14.7 Installation, Commissioning and Testing of the Equipment342
14.8 User Training and Certifcation
Once the equipment is ready for handing over after commissioning, the manufac￾turer/vendor shall be asked to provide training to the actual user or the technicians 
who may operate the equipment. If required, the manufacturer/vendor may be asked 
to provide the training certifcates to the users or the technicians as the case may be.
To reduce the possibility of equipment malfunction, the user of the equipment 
shall be provided with aggressive training by the vendor/manufacturer or the autho￾rised agency of the manufacturer. If the users are not trained properly, it may lead to 
the device malfunctioning. Incorrect use of medical equipment will also aggravate 
maintenance issues. As a result, user training shall be regularly monitored by the 
vendor/manufacturer to ensure that the appropriate skill level required for equip￾ment operation is maintained. In fact, training shall include all user staff as needed, 
including clinical and technical personnel.
1. During training, each user must be instructed on how to use the equipment 
properly, especially if it is a new model that has never been used by your hospi￾tal before.

staff of the hospital to facilitate the trouble-free operation of the equipment.
3. First, the user shall be explained about the hardware equipment and the compo￾nents of the equipment.
4. Then, the process of switching on and turning off the machine shall be explained.
5. Details of accessories and attachments have to be explained. How these acces￾sories are also an important issue shall also be explained.
6. Then comes the software of the equipment. The user shall be explained the 
purpose of the software and how to use the software. Particularly, the sequences 
that have to be followed to operate the software shall be explained.
7. The user shall be made to operate the machine in front of the trainer so that he/
she can check if the user has any problem operating the equipment.
8. The user is required to take a deep interest in learning and shall clear all his/her 
doubts during the training.
9. Now the user shall be asked to perform procedures on dummy patients or the 
phantoms.
10. If everything goes well, the user shall perform the procedure on the actual 
patient.
11. The trainer shall also provide training to the user regarding the proper mainte￾nance, cleaning and sterilizing of the equipment at the required intervals.

14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management343
14.9 Handing Over the Equipment
Now is the time to hand over the equipment to the hospital.
Before transferring the ownership and signing the fnal equipment commission￾ing reports and handing over the report, the Biomedical Engineer shall inspect and 
test the equipment thoroughly. Check all the hardware, software and accessories 
that are supplied with the equipment. Compare these items with the purchase order.
The Biomedical Engineer is also supposed to check the technical parameter of 
the equipment and compare it with the purchase order. While taking over the equip￾ment, the issues like electrical safety inspection, radiation safety, etc. shall also be 
taken care of before giving the fnal affrmation.
The Biomedical Engineer shall take charge of the equipment, its accessories, 
attachments, kits and consumables supplied along with the equipment.
All the operational manuals, service manuals, warranty cards and any other doc￾uments must be taken into the possession of the Biomedical Engineer.
The Biomedical Engineer shall take charge of all the spare parts supplied with 
the machine and store them carefully.
All the stock entries shall be completed by the Biomedical Engineer or other 
concerned persons of the hospital.
The handing over report shall be prepared by the authorised person of the ven￾dor/manufacturer in duplicate. The report is supposed to be signed by the person 
preparing the report and the Biomedical Engineer of the hospital. The head of the 
department where the equipment is installed shall also countersign the handing over 
report. Depending on the policies of the hospital, if required the authorised higher 
authority of the hospital shall also countersign the handing over report.

14.9 Handing Over the Equipment344
14.10 Monitoring Performance at Regular Intervals
One of the most common mistakes done by the hospital is to believe that the war￾ranty period is covered by the vendor, so no in-house technical attention is neces￾sary. This is absolutely wrong. Continuous monitoring of the performance of the 
equipment is equally important for a healthy life of the equipment and trouble-free 
operations.
The user, Biomedical Engineer and the head of the department shall regularly 
monitor the machine. He/she shall ensure that:
1. The operator or the user is operating the equipment as per the standard proto￾cols defned by the manufacturer of the equipment.
2. The desired results and output are being received from the equipment.
3. The equipment is regularly calibrated as per standards.
4. The equipment is cleaned and maintained properly.
5. The preventive maintenance of the equipment has been carried out as per 
schedule.
6. The electrical connection and other connections like water and gases are intact 
and leakproof.
7. Electrical safety shall be checked at the defned intervals.
8. Ensure that all the attachments and accessories are working properly.
9. Ensure that the approved consumable like kits, reagents, paper, etc. used and 
sub-standard material is not being used in the equipment.
10. Check the consumable part like lamps and electrodes of the equipment at regu￾lar intervals and ensure that they do not require replacement. If required, arrange 
for replacing them immediately.
14.11 Maintenance, Safety and Care of Medical Equipment
Equipment maintenance, care and service activities are necessary to ensure the con￾tinued functioning of the equipment and avoid breakage or operational failures. If 
the equipment is maintained and cared for properly, the downtime will be reduced, 
the quality and accuracy of the performance will be better and the life of the equip￾ment will increase. The primary goal of maintenance is to minimise or, if possible, 
eliminate the need for repairs.
There are a lot of issues which shall be taken care of for proper maintenance of 
the equipment; they can be related to the equipment directly or other issues like 
infrastructural issues or cleaning issues etc. We have described a few such issues 
which shall be taken care of.
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management345
First and the foremost requirement for equipment maintenance is to maintain the 
history and logbook of every major piece of equipment. For very small instruments 
like sphygmomanometers, monitors, etc., this log sheet need not be maintained. The 
history and the logbook can either be maintained on the electronic mode of the 
manual register. It is recommended that both soft and hard copies can be maintained.
First coming to the historical record of the equipment. The history sheet of the 
equipment shall be maintained by the Biomedical Department. The history sheet 
shall include details like
– Name of the equipment.
– Make, model and serial number.
– Purchase order detail like PO number and date of PO.
– Main terms and conditions of the PO.
– Payment details.
– Material receipt details with the date of receipt.
– Warranty clause.
– Maintenance contract details.
– Invoice number and date of invoice.
– Store entry details like MRN and date of receipt.
– Installation details with the date of installation.
– Equipment handing over details.
– User training details.
– Repair details like date of repairs, type of repair, spare parts used for repairs and 
the expenses on repairs.
– Name, address and contact number of the service provider for maintenance of 
equipment.
Now the Logbook
The logbook shall be maintained by the user and shall be placed in the department 
near the equipment. The logbook shall contain details like
– Time of switching on the equipment.
– Time of switching off the equipment.
– Actual running time of the equipment.
– If the equipment has been provided with running exposure meters, the reading of 
the same shall be recorded.
– Date and time of breakdown of equipment.
– Date and time of repair of equipment.
– Ideal time, dead time, etc.
– Date and time of preventive maintenance.
– Date and time of breakdown maintenance.
The sample format of the checklist is given in Table 14.4.

14.11.1 Equipment Checking
1. Preventive Maintenance (PM): Preventive maintenance is performed to 
extend the operational life of the equipment and to detect and correct problems 
that are not apparent to the user. PM procedures are planned and performed by 
the manufacturer of the equipment based on the factors like individual experi￾ence, equipment service history, etc. The maintenance services shall include all 
necessary actions that should be carried out on the equipment.
2. The equipment shall be properly switched on and off as and when required. For 
shutting down the equipment, standards shut down procedure shall be followed 
14.11 Maintenance, Safety and Care of Medical Equipment348
and not by just switching off the main supply to the equipment. If done, the 
software of the equipment may get corrupted.
3. Check the electrical wiring, sockets, plugs and switches at regular intervals, say 
weekly, and ensure that everything is working fne. If anything is found to be 
defective or damaged, arrange for an immediate replacement.
4. Daily check the voltage of the electricity and ensure that the constant voltage is 
received at the equipment end.
5. At regular intervals, check the ground earthing of the equipment or the electri￾cal sockets as the case may be.
6. Ensure that the accessories and the attachments on one piece of equipment shall 
not be replaced with that of other equipment, even if it is the same item, or of 
the same make or model.
7. Ensure that the generally required spare parts and accessories are always avail￾able in the stores for the continuous operation of the equipment.
8. The audio/visual alarms of the equipment, if any shall be taken seriously. On 
noticing any such alarm, immediately inform the Biomedical Department for 
corrective action.
9. If the equipment consists of any pressurised parts like gas or air cylinders, get 
the pressure testing done at regular intervals, as recommended by the manufac￾turers of the equipment.
10. Check all the seals, connectors and adapters at regular intervals. If the same is 
damaged, worn out or leaking, replace them immediately.
11. Most of the medical equipment is provided with battery backup. For hassle-free 
operations of the equipment, check the battery backup daily. Also, ensure that 
the batteries are put on continuous charging. If the equipment is not in use for a 
long duration, it is advised to disconnect the batteries.
12. Further check the battery health at regular intervals. If batteries are found to be 
worn out, replace them with new batteries.
13. Check all the bulbs, heaters, etc. of the equipment on regular basis. If any defect 
is noticed, inform the Biomedical Department to replace them immediately.
14. Replace oil, paper, electrodes, lamp and other consumable items as per the 
schedule recommended by the manufacturer of the equipment.
15. Check all the rubber parts as per the predefned schedule provided by the manu￾facturer. If any part is noticed to be torn, worn out or damaged, arrange for 
replacement from the Biomedical Department.
16. Check the vibration pads, if provided and ensure that they are in working condi￾tion. If required, the request shall be sent to the service department of the manu￾facturer to replace the pads.
17. At regular intervals, check that the equipment is properly screwed to the foun￾dation. If any looseness is noticed, inform the Biomedical Department to take 
care of the defect.
18. Daily check that all the gas, water and air supply lines are connected to the 
equipment, whereever required, e.g. oxygen lines are connected to the ventila￾tors, nitrous oxide lines to the anaesthesia work station, line for compressed air 
to the ventilator and pneumatic tools, CO2 line to the insuffator, etc.
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management349
19. Calibrate the equipment on regular basis as per the schedule provided by the 
manufacturer of the equipment.
20. It shall be strictly ensured that only recommended regents/kits/disposable/con￾sumables are used during the operations of the equipment. No local, substan￾dard or non-recommended material shall be used in the equipment.
21. Then, equipment shall always be screwed or tied up properly with the belts and 
straps. This will prevent the equipment from falling and avoid damage to the 
equipment.
22. Operation manual shall be kept near the equipment so that in case of any 
requirement the same can be referred to immediately.
23. Please ensure that the equipment when not in use shall be properly covered with 
the help of a water-resistant cover to prevent equipment from dust and liquid 
spilling.
24. Minor breakdown shall be attended to immediately and ratifed to prevent any 
big damage to the equipment.
25. If the equipment is a portable type, ensure that the wheels are intact and in 
working condition and are freely rotatable. The wheels shall be cleaned, oiled 
or greased at regular intervals.
26. While moving the portable equipment to another location, the movement shall 
be very polite. Sudden breaking, jerks and hitting shall be avoided as they may 
damage the equipment or any part thereof.
27. While moving, ensure that the equipment is handled strongly, to prevent drop￾ping the equipment and getting damaged.
28. Check the inventory of the equipment, including accessories, attachments, kits, 
spares, consumables, etc. at regular intervals to assess any variation.
29. The instruction for handling the equipment shall be very clearly given by the 
management. While giving such instructions, please ensure that no unauthor￾ised and unexperienced person shall be allowed to handle the equipment under 
any circumstances.
30. It is advised that every piece of equipment in the hospital shall have a mainte￾nance checklist, which shall be placed near the equipment and shall be regularly 
maintained by the user and audited by the Biomedical Engineer.
14.11.2 Cleaning Issues
1. Clean equipment, linen, foors, walls, etc. to make the area and equipment rela￾tively free from pathogenic organisms. The rooms where the equipment is 
installed shall be cleaned at least once a day. If required, it can be cleaned more 
than once also. The method of cleaning the foor depends upon the type of foor. 
Generally, the foors are mopped with mops. Vacuum cleaners can also be used 
wherever required. The foor may be washed with detergent or soap at regular 
intervals. The abrasives, the acids or the alkalise should be avoided to be used. If 
the foor stains, the stain remover should be used to clean the stain. The wooden 
14.11 Maintenance, Safety and Care of Medical Equipment350
foor should be kept well-polished. These should be mopped regularly. The water 
should be wiped off immediately to prevent staining. Cement foors can be 
cleaned with mild alkaline solutions such as soap, detergent, soda carb, etc. 
Occasionally polishing the foor keeps the foor surface glazing. For walls, the 
method of cleaning depends upon the type of walls. Cement or marble walls can 
be cleaned in the same way as foors. On the painted wall, never use acid or 
alkalise as it may damage the painted surface, but the usage of a damp cloth can 
clean the surface.
2. Due to the continuous use of the equipment, being exposed to dirt and continu￾ous touch by the operators and the patients, it is natural that the equipment will 
get dirty. Either the dust will accumulate on the equipment or the body of the 
equipment can become black due to continuous touches. Hence, regular cleaning 
and dusting of the equipment is necessary. Therefore, it is suggested that at least 
once a week, the equipment shall be dusted with a clean cloth (if necessary, use 
a low-suction vacuum cleaner). Thereafter, the panel and body of the equipment 
shall be scrubbed with soft cleaning solutions and dry it with a dry soft cloth. 
Avoid using harsh chemicals.
3. As medical equipment is a very delicate and sophisticated item and may easily 
get damaged if handled by an unexperienced or unauthorised person. Hence, 
none of these persons shall be allowed to touch the equipment even for clean￾ing. This type of equipment shall be cleaned by the user or technician him/
herself. He/she shall clean the main equipment and all the accessories and 
attachments.
4. The print heads of the printers, if any, shall be regularly cleaned according to the 
instructions given by the manufacturers.
5. As far as the diagnostic and operative endoscopes are concerned, shall be prop￾erly rinsed, dried and disinfected by the technicians him/herself. The cleaning 
process, as prescribed by the manufacturer, shall be strictly adhered to.
6. All the transducers, probes and connectors shall be cleaned with non-alcoholic 
tissues of the cloth, after every use.
7. The flters if any shall be cleaned routinely whether by blowing air or washing, 
as suggested by the manufacturer of the equipment.
8. Spilling of any type of liquid on the equipment can damage the equipment and 
may need major repairs. Hence, it shall be ensured that the spilling of water or 
any type of liquid is prevented. For this, the staff shall be instructed to keep the 
liquids away from the equipment. Further, if the equipment is not in use, cover it 
with water-resistant covers.
9. Surgical instruments and tools shall be cleaned and sterilised according to the 
protocol for cleaning them. The surgical instruments shall be pre-washed after 
every surgery. After pre-wash, the same shall be sent to the sterilization depart￾ment for sterilization as per the protocol. Sharp edge instruments shall not be 
sterilised and shall be disinfected by the chemical.
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management351
14.11.3 Infrastructure-Related Issues
1. Nowadays, most medical equipment is an electronic circuit based, which requires 
a particular environmental condition to work effciently. Further, some of the 
equipment may have tubes and other components which decapitate heat, which 
may require more cooling. Considering these issues, the environmental condi￾tion like temperature and humidity are very important (or to be said, the lifeline) 
of the equipment. If proper climatical conditions are provided in the room, the 
equipment will function effciently and the life of the equipment may also 
increase.
2. As far as the temperature of the room is concerned, every piece of equipment 
may have a different requirement. E.g. the room temperature in the case of MRI 
will be different, CT scan may require a different temperature and the modular 
operating room may require different temperatures and air exchanges, etc. 
Hence, the air-conditioning system of the hospital shall be very effective and 
designed carefully. As far as the temperature of the equipment room is con￾cerned, please obtain guidelines from the original manufacturer while planning 
the same. However, routine equipment and instruments may require a tempera￾ture ranging between 20 degrees centigrade and 24 degrees centigrade.
3. As in the case of temperature, the humidity levels are also equally important for 
medical equipment to operate and work effciently. The more the humidity, the 
more will be the breakdowns of the equipment. Hence, the humidity control 
system of the hospital shall be very effective and designed carefully. Therefore, 
while planning the same, please obtain guidelines from the original manufac￾turer. However, routine equipment and instruments may require a humidity level 
ranging between 50%rh and 60%rh.
4. The spaces provided shall be adequately secured and shall be lockable. No unau￾thorised person shall be allowed to enter that space. If required, the spaces shall 
be properly guarded.
5. The room where the equipment is installed, shall be adequately provided with 
cupboards, shelves, tables, counters, etc. to safely place the equipment and to 
store the attachments and accessories when not in use.
6. The equipment room shall be dust and insect free. Proper doors with door springs 
shall be provided. If required, the air curtains can also be used. Windows of the 
rooms shall preferably be fxed and non-openable type.
7. Equipment room shall have all the provisions for necessary gadgets for fre 
detection and frefghting like smoke detectors and sprinklers (if recommended) 
to handle the fre in case it happens.
8. Arrangements shall be done for regular pest control treatment in the room, and 
the room shall be free from rodents, insects and particularly rats.
9. Sky lightning may be a cause of major damage to the equipment in the hospital. 
Hence, the lightning arrestors shall be installed on the rooftop of the hospital and 
shall be effectively ground-earthed.
14.11 Maintenance, Safety and Care of Medical Equipment352
14.11.4 Other Issues
1. Ensure that regular refresher training is provided to the users of the equipment to 
make them aware of how to handle, operate, maintain and care for the equipment.
2. The medical equipment shall be properly insured for any such loss due to a 
major breakdown, fre, food or earthquake.
14.12 Condemnation, Disposal and Replacement 
of the Equipment
Every medical equipment in the hospital will reach a stage where the life of the 
equipment has ended.
14.12.1 Reasons for Replacement and Condemnation
There are various reasons why the equipment may have to be discontinued from use 
and have to be condemned and replacement taken with a piece of new equipment. 
These reasons can be like
– The cost–beneft ratio falls due to decreased dependability.
– Increased downtime.
– High repair costs or beyond economical repairs.
– Recurrent breakdowns of the equipment.
– Nonavailability of spare parts.
– Operations are hazardous and other safety issues.
– Compromised care.
– Increased operating costs.
– Changing regulations.
– Functional but obsolete.
– Simply obsolete technologies.
– The manufacturer declared the equipment as the end of life and service support 
is withdrawn.
– Very rare use of equipment or equipment not required at all.
14.12.2 Life Span of Medical Equipment
In any hospital set-up, there are a lot of medical equipment, devices, tool and instru￾ments and each of them has its own specifc requirement and use. These can be very 
small and low-valued items like stethoscopes and sphygmomanometers etc., 
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management353
medium-valued items like multipara monitors, etc. and high-valued items like linear 
accelerators, MRI, etc.
Usually, for these low-value items, the life spans are not strictly defned or deter￾mined. Hence, these items shall be condemned and replaced as and when it is 
beyond repairs.
Medium-valued items like monitors, ventilators, ultrasound machines and X-ray 
machines, usually have a defned lifespan. If we talk about developed countries, the 
lifespan generally is considered to be 5–7 years. However, in developing countries 
or underdeveloped countries, the lifespan can be up to 10 years. Few countries have 
their own laid-down rules, regulations and guidelines for replacement of the medi￾cal equipment, devices, tools and instruments.
If we talk about surgical instruments, the replacement depends on the effcient 
working of the instruments, e.g. if the sharpness of the scissors has gone out, the 
same shall be replaced. Similarly, the forceps, if the grasping power of the forceps 
is not good, it shall be replaced.
14.12.3 Condemnation Process
For the Condemnation of the medical equipment, devices, tools and instruments, 
there shall be set laid down guidelines for the hospital and everyone shall follow 
those set of guidelines. The general procedure to be followed shall be as:
14.12.3.1 Condemnation Committee
For the condemnation of any medical equipment, device, tools or instrument, the 
condemnation committee shall be formed. It is this committee where the proposal 
for condemnation shall be placed. The committee shall then evaluate the condemna￾tion proposal and decide whether or not an item/equipment should be condemned. 
The recommendation should be based on the user department’s recommendation, 
history/log sheet/alternative location of use and so on. The committee may be con￾strued with the following members:
• Head of the concerned department (HOD) where the equipment is being used.
• Designated Medical Offcer.
• Head of the Biomedical Department.
• A representative from Finance Department.
• A representative from Procurement Department.
• A representative from the Stores.
• A representative from the Administration Department.
• Any other member as nominated by the competent authority of the hospital.
14.12 Condemnation, Disposal and Replacement of the Equipment354
14.12.3.2 Proposal and Request for Condemnation
At the request of the user, the head of the department where the equipment is 
installed shall prepare the proposal and request for condemnation and replacement 
of the equipment, device, tool or instrument. While preparing the proposal, the head 
of the department shall check the history and life of the equipment. Also, he/she 
shall check the repair history of the item to be condemned. If he/she is satisfed and 
falls in one of the reasons for condemnation, he/she shall prepare the proposal and 
request letter. Copies of the proposal and request letters shall be sent to all the mem￾bers of the condemnation committee well in advance so that the members of the 
committee can review the case before attending the committee meeting. The com￾mittee shall examine every proposal and, after a thorough assessment, shall follow 
the guidelines for the condemnation of equipment.
The committee shall assess the life of the equipment that it has lived in. If the 
equipment is functioning well beyond its life shall continue to be used.
However, depending upon its usage, availability of the backup of services and 
repairs, technology and other related factors, equipment may be continued to be 
used even after the end of its life of the equipment.
Under the following circumstances, the medical equipment, devices, tools and 
instruments shall be considered for condemnation and replacement.
1. If substantial repairs have already been carried out during the lifespan of the 
equipment, it is expected that in future the higher costs of repairs are expected.
2. The equipment is nonfunctional, and the expected repair cost is equal to or more 
than 50% of the procurement cost of the equipment.
3. For equipment, which is nonfunctional and certifed as non-reparable by the ser￾vice agency/manufacturer due to the nonavailability of spare parts, irrespective 
of the asset life, the equipment can be considered for condemnation and 
replacement.
4. If the equipment is undergoing breakdown frequently, the dead time is more.
5. For equipment which is obsolete or hazardous or there are any other safety 
issues, irrespective of the equipment’s life or functionality, it shall be considered 
for condemnation.
6. In case, the cost of regents, kits and consumables used in that particular equip￾ment has increased enormously and the per test has increased and is not feasible 
to carry out the procedure.
7. Even after the setting, calibrations etc., the equipment is not providing the 
expected results.
8. In case, the technology of the equipment is outdated and not useful or new 
advanced technology is available.
9. At the time, the regulation, rules or guidelines of the Government changes and 
restricts the use of a particular technology, in that case, the equipment shall be 
condemned.
In some cases, equipment like X-ray and nuclear scan machines, which have 
been licensed, if condemned, has to be brought to the notice of the licensing 
14 Equipment Planning, Procurement, Installation and Management355
authority. This equipment has to be decommissioned and information has to be sent 
to the licensing authority before disposal.
In case, the procurement cost of the equipment is not available due to any reason, 
then the current cost of the same make and model or equivalent make or model can 
be used to assess the acceptable cost for repair.
The recommendation of the Condemnation Committee shall be put up to the 
competent authority for fnal approval.
Ongoing Annual Maintenance Contract/Comprehensive Maintenance Contract 
for such equipment, if any, shall be terminated from the effective date of 
condemnation.
The condemnation committee shall issue a certifcate certifying that the equip￾ment is nonfunctional and irreparable, as well as the reasons for irreparability and 
that it has been declared condemned.
14.12.3.3 Disposal of the Equipment
Once the equipment has been condemned, it has to be disposed of. There are various 
issues involved for disposal.
The condemned medical equipment, devices, tools and instruments shall be 
decontaminated before disposal.
Disposal of equipment must follow safety procedures to protect people and the 
environment. As most medical equipment, these days is electronic-based, after con￾demnation will generate E-waste. For the disposal of E-waste, most countries have 
set rules, regulations and guidelines. The hospital is bound to follow those guidelines.
Disposal as scrap: If the equipment is disposed of as scrap, it shall be clear that 
if E-waste has been generated after condemnation, the same has to be disposed of 
only to the licensed and approved vendor. It shall not be otherwise disposed of by 
any other person.
If it is normal scrap and not E-waste, it can be disposed of by any scrap dealer in 
the market.
Returns to vendors: If the hospital is planning to purchase new equipment, the 
vendor of the new equipment may allow the buy back of the old and condemned 
equipment. This may help the hospital in saving some costs of new equipment.
14.12.4 Replacement of the Equipment
After the condemnation of the equipment, the request for the replacement shall be 
placed by the concerned head of the department where the equipment has to be used.
For replacement, the entire process of procurement, as is done in the case of new 
equipment shall be repeated.
14.12 Condemnation, Disposal and Replacement of the Equipment356
However, in case the vendor is prepared to buy back the condemned equipment 
at an attractive amount, the preference shall be given to that particular vendor for 
procurement of the new equipment.

Department Wise Equipment Detailing
As stated earlier in Chap. 14 of this book, the selection of the medical equipment, 
instruments, machines and tools required in the hospital varies from one hospital to 
the other. The choice of equipment to be procured totally depends on various fac￾tors like:
1. Which all speciality and super speciality medical departments the promoters 
are planning to make operative in the hospital? These can be like General 
Medicine, General Surgery, Paediatric, Gynaecology, Urology, Cardiology, 
Neurology, etc.
2. Which all medical equipment is required for a particular medical speciality?
3. Which investigation departments are to be provided in the hospital, like radio￾logical and clinical laboratory, etc.?
4. What will be the level of investigations? Will it be the routine investigations or 
will it be the highly specialised investigations? Some hospitals may plan only 
for basic investigations like X-rays, ultrasound, etc., whereas others may decide 
to have CT scans and MRIs also. Still further, some may like to have 
PET-CT also.
5. Is the hospital planning to outsource any department like Radiology, 
Oncology, etc.?
6. What will be the level of the medical equipment? Will it be a low-ended machine 
or otherwise a high-ended machine with the latest technology?
7. The functionality of the equipment.
8. Frequency of use of the equipment.
9. The fnancial cost of the equipment.
10. Income likely to be generated by the equipment.
11. Period of return on investment for the equipment.
12. The useful life of the equipment.
13. Determine equipment reuse and relocation options.
14. Expected technology changes in the equipment.358
Therefore, very careful and in-depth planning is required for choosing the medi￾cal equipment to be procured. Similarly, deciding the specifcation and confgura￾tion of the equipment is a more cumbersome process. While planning, the planner 
shall understand equipment preferences, concerns and priorities after conducting 
interviews with the departmental heads. He/she shall also review the architectural 
drawing and details to ensure that all the elements of the building fulfl the require￾ment for the effcient functioning of the equipment.
Almost every medical equipment, machinery and tool to be installed in the hos￾pital may have some specifc requirements for installation of such equipment, 
machinery and tools. These requirements can be related to the civil infrastructure, 
electrical requirements, environmental conditions, cleanliness, sterility, security, 
etc. Mentioning all such requirements in detail is not feasible because frst each 
manufacturer of such equipment, machinery and tools may have a different require￾ment and that also may vary from one country to another. However, we have tried to 
brief out some of the general requirements which the manufacturers normally ask 
for. For detailed installation requirements of any equipment, machinery and tools, it 
is better to contact the manufacturer of such items.
With the growing technologies in the medical industry, there is a huge list of 
medical equipment, machinery, instruments and tools that can be installed in the 
hospital. It is not possible to compile a list of all the medical equipment available in 
the market today, but we have tried to list out a few of them along with the purpose 
for which it is used.
The below exercise will make the task of choosing a bit easier for the planner and 
promoter. However, the fnal list of equipment to be purchased shall entirely depend 
on the team of experts and the users, considering the budget that has been allotted 
for this purpose.

supply source should be liquid oxygen. As a backup, it is advised to provide one 
spare port of oxygen, so that it can be used in case of failure of the working port.
15.1 Emergency and Triage362
Infusion Pumps: An infusion pump is to deliver fuids, such as medications and 
nutrients, into the patient’s body in preset and controlled amounts or volumes.
Insuffator: Insuffator is to blow CO2 in the stomach while performing laparo￾scopic surgery.
Invasive Ventilators: Invasive mechanical ventilator is a life-saving device used 
after intervention for patients suffering from respiratory or breathing problems. The 
primary purpose of mechanical ventilation is to provide oxygen to the patient, 
remove CO2, decrease the efforts involved in breathing and reverse life-threatening 
conditions such as hypoxaemia, insuffcient oxygenation of arterial blood, acute 
progressive respiratory acidosis or build-up of CO2 in the blood.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Invasive Ventilator:
The invasive ventilator with the help of compressed air mixes the oxygen and 
forces it into the lungs of the patient, hence providing supportive breathing. 
Therefore, the ventilator requires compressed air and oxygen to ventilate the patient. 
Hence, apart from the routine installation requirements, the ports of centralised 
compressed air (4  bar) and oxygen shall be provided near the ventilator. As a 
backup, it is advised to provide one spare port for both the air and oxygen, so that 
it can be used in case of failure of the working port.

magnetic and radio frequency-based machine. The machine uses a high-power mag￾netic feld and computer-generated controlled radio frequency waves to create 
detailed images of the organs and tissues of the body. Magnetic felds align the 
protons of the cell in a unidirectional fashion. Then, the radiofrequency waves are 
fred on the protons, due to which the protons oscillate. This oscillation is captured 
by the machine, and an image is produced.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and 
Testing of MRI:
For details of infrastructure requirements for installation, commissioning and 
testing of MRI, please refer to Sect. 15.23 under the heading of ‘Radiology’ in this 
chapter.

Suction Machine, Electrical: A suction machine is a tracheostomy-care device 
used to remove any obstruction from a patient’s airway. The machine uses the tech￾nique of suction to pull out mucus, saliva, blood, secretions or other fuids stuck up 
in the airway, hence clearing the airway for easy breathing.
Surgical Operating Instruments: For any type of surgery, the surgeon apart 
from equipment needs a set of instruments to perform surgeries. The basic instru￾ments are like scissors, artery forceps, BP handle, Babcock, retractor, needle holder, 
dissecting forceps, speculum, etc. Further, every item of an instrument may have 
different variants based on shapes and sizes.
Syringe Pumps: To gradually administer specifc amounts of fuids to the patient 
(which has been preset), the syringe pump is used.
Telescopes: The telescopes transmit light coaxially through each barrel to pro￾vide converging light at the operative sight. The telescopes eliminate the need for 
constant realignment of loupes and headlights.
Ultrasound Machine: An ultrasound machine is used to take images of organs 
inside the body using the technique of high-frequency ultrasound waves. This 
machine sends out high-frequency sound waves, in the body, which refect off body 
structures. A computer receives the refected waves and considering the time lag of 
receiving the waves from different tissues of the body, creates a picture.

Ambulatory ABP Monitor: Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitor is to 
monitor the blood pressure continuously at specifed intervals over 24 h and thus get 
an overall profle of blood pressure variation in a day.
Cath Lab: A Cath Lab is an imaging equipment used to see the conditions of 
the arteries and check how well blood is fowing to and from the surface of the 
heart. Cath Lab helps to diagnose and treat blockages that may have occurred in 
the arteries. It is used to perform procedures like coronary and peripheral angio￾plasty, angiography, cardiac catheterisation, atherectomy, stent implantation, 
thrombectomy, etc.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Cath Lab:
The Cath Lab is an X-ray-based imaging machine, and a very high dose of the 
rays is produced when exposure is given. Hence, it requires the designing consider￾ation according to the norms and regulations as prescribed by the regulatory 
authority. Proper designing has to be done to avoid radiation leakages. Before 
designing the Cath Lab rooms, the guidelines and norms of the controlling 
authority of the country must be taken into account. Like in India, the author￾ity is Bhabha Atomic Research Institute.
The main issues to be considered while designing the Cath Lab spaces are:
For Cath Lab, if the machine is to be installed horizontally, a rectangular room 
shall be designed. If the machine is installed diagonally, a square room can also be 
considered. But, the suggestion is to install it horizontally in a rectangular room. 
The space of the room shall not be less than 42  m2
. The approx. size can be 
9144 mm × 4572 mm.
All the walls of the room shall be at least 229 mm thick with plaster on both sides. 
The ideal thickness for the primary wall of an X-ray room should be at least 250 mm 
of solid baked clay bricks or 150 mm in the case of mortar/concrete walls. Hollow 
bricks, if used, should be plastered with a thickness of 6 mm barium plaster and 
should be protected up to 2200 mm from the foor level.
The fooring shall be either tile/marble/granite. But, the fooring shall not be 
slippery to avoid the chances of an accident-causing injury to the patient.
The door shall have a proper 2 mm thick lead lining. The lining has to be done 
even on the door frame. There shall be no leakage of the radiation from any place in 
the door. Doors should overlap by a minimum of 100 mm on each side when closed. 
The door should be at least 1800 mm wide and 2000 mm high.
It is advised to provide air interlock spaces by providing an additional door 
before the Cath Lab room door.
Windows are not allowed in the Cath Lab.
Outside the door of the room, a warning light shall be given by providing a red 
colour bulb. The light must be connected to the X-ray generator in such a way that 
it will illuminate only during the activation of the X-ray tube.
While installing the machine, care shall be taken to leave at least 1829 mm space 
behind the machine for easy movement of the C-Arm of the machine. The machine 
shall be installed in the centre of the width of the room.
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing371
Depending on the capacity of the machine, the power load required by the 
machine shall be calculated and the main switch and cable shall be terminated in 
each Cath Lab room separately.
As the weight of the machine is more and the movement of the machine is very 
fast, it is advised to check the weight-bearing capacity of the foor. If needed, pro￾vide a foundation for the machine as per the suggestion of the machine manufac￾turer. If the machine is a ceiling suspended model, care shall be taken to access the 
load-bearing capacity of the ceiling. If required proper treatment with the help of 
guarders or angles shall be done to increase the load-bearing capacity of the 
ceiling.
The lightning in the room shall be normal LED light with suffcient lumens. No 
extra illumination is required in the room.
The temperature in the room shall be between 17 and 21 °C, and the humidity 
level shall not be more than 40%.
Cath Lab machine shall have proper ground earthing provisions.
Inside the Cath Lab room, outlets for medical gas supply shall be given. The 
outlets shall be 1 for oxygen, 1 for vacuum and 1 for air.
The proper two-way audio system shall be provided in the Cath Lab so that the 
patient can be directed by the technician from the control room itself.
Position the gantry and couch in such a position that the patient is completely 
visible from the control console during scanning.
Stand with heavy-duty hangers shall be provided outside the Cath Lab to hang 
the Lead Apron.
Also, a cabinet shall be provided inside the Cath Lab room, for keeping other 
radiation safety devices like, lead gloves, lead goggles, groin guards, lead col￾lars, etc.
Attached to the Cath Lab room, a console room shall be provided. There shall be 
a provision of a secondary computer for the transfer of images during the procedure 
and reporting later on. The size of the console room shall be a minimum of 
3658 mm × 3658 mm.
Preferably, an online UPS shall be provided with the machine. As the UPS is 
usually of high rating say above 100  KVA, a lot of batteries shall be required. 
Defnitely, for this, a separate room is required. This room shall be attached to the 
control room or the machine room. Some hospitals want to install all the UPS of the 
entire hospital in a common place away from the machine. UPS away from the Cath 
Lab is not recommended. Earthing of the UPS is also desirable.
The size of the UPS room shall be about 3658 mm × 3658 mm with a provision 
of racks to install the batteries. Because of the acid in the batteries, some fumes are 
formed in the room, so the UPS room shall have a provision of exhaust to remove 
these fumes from the room from time to time. As the UPS also generates heat, the 
UPS room shall be air-conditioned and the temperature shall be about 17–20 °C 
with an RH of not more than 40%.
Apart from the main machine where the tube and the detectors are fxed, other 
electronic parts are provided in the panels connected to the machine. These panels 
control the machine’s working but are not directly needed in the Cath Lab room. For 
15.5 Cardiology and Interventional Cardiology372
better protection of these panels, it is suggested to install them in a different room 
or enclosure attached to the Cath Lab room. Hence, such an area shall be designed 
after consulting the equipment manufacturer. The size and temperature, etc. shall be 
confrmed by the manufacturer of the machine.
At times, with the patient’s clothes which he/she is wearing, it becomes diffcult 
to perform the procedure. Hence, the change rooms shall be provided near the Cath 
Lab, to enable the patient to remove the outside clothes and change into the hospital 
dress. The size of this change room shall be 3658 mm × 3658 mm with a provision 
of a hanger rod and shelves for keeping the hospital dress.
Changing rooms shall also be provided in the Cath Lab to enable the doctors and 
staff to remove the outside clothes and change into the sterilised hospital dress. 
Different change rooms shall be provided for different categories of staff members. 
Also, the change rooms for males shall be separate from females.
Cath Lab shall have a separate waiting area near the lab for the family members 
of the patient whose procedure is being performed. The number of persons that can 
be allowed to wait in this lobby may be limited with proper spacing between 
their seats.
Cath Lab procedures require a lot of consumable materials like catheters, guide 
wires, fuid, etc. Hence, ample stock of these consumables shall be available in the 
lab. To stock these items, the department needs a store. This store shall be of the size 
of 3658 mm × 3658 mm. The store needs to have suffcient countertops, cupboards 
and drawers. The temperature of the room shall be between 17 and 21 °C.
After the procedure, the images are generally transferred to a CD or DVD. These 
CDs/DVDs are marked with the patient ID and name and are kept in the record 
along with other registers and reports. Hence, to stock these items, the department 
needs a store. This store shall be of the size of 3658 mm × 3658 mm. The store shall 
have suffcient countertops, cupboards and drawers. The temperature of the room 
shall be between 17 and 21 °C.
Defbrillator: Defbrillator sends an electric pulse or shock to the heart which 
restores the normal heartbeat. The defbrillator is also used to prevent or correct 
arrhythmia. Defbrillators can also be useful in restoring the heart’s beating, in case 
the heart suddenly stops. This device is also a life-saving device.
Electrophysiology Lab: Electrophysiology (EP) lab is used for electrophysiol￾ogy studies (EPSs). This is to monitor and map the electrical systems of the heart as 
well as treat heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias).
Echocardiogram (ECHO): Echocardiogram is used to see the anatomy of the 
heart. Echocardiography also allows monitoring of the functioning of valves of the 
heart. It also gives information about blood clots in the heart chambers.
Gamma Camera: The gamma camera, also called the scintillation camera, is 
used for imaging with nuclear medicine. It simultaneously detects radiation from 
the entire FOV and enables the acquisition of dynamic as well as static images of 
the area of interest in the human body. In cardiology, it can image the heart and help 
diagnose coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy and many other heart conditions.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Gamma Camera:
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing373
For details of infrastructure requirements for installation, commissioning and 
testing of the Gamma Camera please refer to Sect. 15.23 under the heading of

the electrical activity of a cardiovascular system for at least 24 and up to 72 h.
Hypothermia Device (Blanket, Plumbing and Heat Exchanger): This device 
is used to control the temperature of the body of the patient. After the surgery when 
the heart starts beating again, the body temperature of the patient needs to be low￾ered for a short time.
Instruments for Cath Lab: To perform the procedures in Cath Lab, the 
Cardiologist requires a set of instruments. The basic instruments are like scissors, 
artery forceps, BP handle, Babcock, retractor, needle holder, speculum, etc. 
Depending on the requirement of the cardiologist, different variants based on shapes 
and sizes shall be procured.
Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump: An intra-aortic balloon pump, or IABP, is to con￾trol the fow of blood through the aorta. The device uses a balloon, which gets 
defated when the heart pumps blood, to give way to the blood to fow out in the 
body. On the other side, the balloon gets infated when the heart relaxes to retain 
more blood in the heart.
Pacemaker Temporary: When the patient suffering from Brady Dysrhythmia 
and temporary treatment has to be provided, the Temporary Pacemaker is used. 
Such conditions may arise when either the permanent pacemaker is not necessary or 
is not immediately available.
TEE Probe with Ultrasound: TEE is an ultrasound probe which works on high￾frequency sound waves to take detailed pictures of the heart and the arteries that 
lead to and from it, from the backside of the heart. The probe of the TEE passes to 
the backside of the oesophagus to capture images of heart structures and valves.
Tilt Test Table: The tilt test table is to adjust the body position from horizontal 
to vertical for simulating standing up. The test is used to access faulty brain signals 
that may be causing low blood pressure.
TMT: TMT is a treadmill used to make the patient run and put the heart under 
stress. During different phases of stress on the heart, ECGs are taken to detect any 
abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) and also to diagnose any coronary artery 
disease. TMT is a treadmill used to make the patient run and put the heart under stress.

device in this machine which continuously monitors and measures the urine fow 
rate and volume and urine output in real time.
Columns for Immunoadsorption in Extracorporeal Systems: Extracorporeal 
Immunoadsorption (ECI) is used for selectively removing immunoglobulin’s (IgG) 
and circulating immune complexes (CICs) from patients, by using Protein A 
columns.
Cystoscope: Cystoscope is used to examine the lining of your urethra and blad￾der. The cystoscope consisting of a lens is inserted into the urethra and slowly 
pushed into the bladder.
Erectile Dysfunction Device: A vacuum constriction device (VCD) is for men 
who are suffering from erectile dysfunction. The VCD system consists of an acrylic 
cylinder with a pump and a constriction ring or band. The device creates a vacuum 
to help the penis become erect, whereas the band helps to maintain the erection.
ESW Lithotripter: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) generates 
shock waves and is used to break the kidney stone into small pieces. These small 
pieces of stone easily travel through the urinary tract and pass out from the body. 
With the help of X-rays or ultrasound, the exact location of the stone is determined 
and the shocks are delivered to the stone to break it into small fragments.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of ESW Lithotripter:
ESW lithotripter basically consists of two machines. One is the lithotripter, and 
the other is the C-Arm. Both of these can either be integrated or can be sepa￾rate units.
As far as the lithotripter is concerned, there are no specifc requirements for 
installation. However, for C-Arm, there are few requirements. Those are.
C-Arm is basically a machine working with the technology of X-rays. The X-ray 
generates the X-ray, and the CCD camera or the fat panel above the tube captures 
the rays and converts the same into an image format. As the machine is X-ray￾based, almost the same precautions shall be taken care of as in the case of an X-ray 
machine, like.
The walls of the room shall be at least 229 mm thick, with plaster on both sides. 
The ideal thickness for the primary wall of an X-ray room is at least 250 mm of solid 
baked clay bricks, and 150  mm of mortar/concrete walls for plain radiography. 
Hollow bricks should be plastered with a thickness of 6 mm barium plaster and 
should be protected up to 2200 mm from the foor level.
The door should be at least 1524 mm wide and 2000 mm high. The door and its 
frame need to have a 2 mm thick lead lining. There shall be no leakage of radiation 
from the door. Doors should overlap by a minimum of 100  mm on each side 
when closed.
A warning light (red colour bulb) shall be provided outside the door. This light 
must be connected to the X-ray generator in a way that it illuminates only during the 
X-ray tube activation.
Depending on the machine’s capacity, the power load required by the machine 
shall be calculated and the main switch and cable shall be separately terminated at 
each machine.
15.11 Urology384
The temperature in the room shall range between 18 and 21 °C, and the humidity 
level shall not be more than 60%.
Green Light Laser: The green light laser is used to treat enlargement of the 
prostate called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Green light laser evaporates 
prostatic tissue which is blocking the outlet of the bladder.
Holmium or Thulium Laser: Thulium laser (ThuLEP) and holmium laser 
(HoLEP) are used for endoscopic enucleation of the prostate glands.
Hydraulic Cytometric Device: Cystometry is a diagnostic tool to measure the 
amount of urine actually in the bladder vis-a-vis how full the bladder feels. In the 
process, the main muscles of the bladder wall (the detrusor) or urethra (the urethral 
sphincter) are diagnosed.
Nephoscope: Nephoscope is used to perform Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy 
(PCNL), wherein the kidney stones are located, viewed and removed with a mini￾mally invasive surgery.
Uro Dynamics and Urofometer: Uro dynamic and urofometer is a device to 
measure urine fow rates during micturition, including average fow rate, peak fow 
rate, time of voiding and voided volume.
Ureteroscope: Ureteroscope is also used to locate, vies and remove kidney 
stones. The difference between nephoscope and ureteroscope is that a ureteroscope 
is passed through the urethra, bladder and up the ureter to the point where the stone 
is in the kidney.
Wearable, smartphone-controlled device for treating premature ejaculation 
(PE): The device is placed on the perineum area which confuses the ejaculatory 
nerves before they go up to the brain. The device delivers a mild form of electrical 
energy through its four electrodes.
15.12 Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Pancreatology
See Table 15.12.
24 h pH Impedance: Esophageal 24-h pH/impedance refux monitor is used to 
measure the amount of refux (both acidic and non-acidic) in the oesophagus during 
24 h. This is also used to assess any symptoms that may be correlated with refux.
Breath Analyser: A breath analyser is used to estimate the alcohol contents in 
the blood (BAC) from a breath sample.
Capsule Endoscope: A capsule endoscope is a small capsule which is swal￾lowed while performing the procedure. This device consists of a tiny wireless cam￾era. This capsule when passes through the stomach, large intestine and small 
intestine, and the endoscope takes images. These images are then transmitted to the 
recording device worn on a belt around the waist of the technician. These recorded 
images are fnally processed in the central processing unit to get the report.
C-ARM: C-Arm is an X-ray-based imaging intensifer. The CCD camera or the 
fat panel X-ray detector is ftted on the top end of the C-shaped Arm. On the bottom

through a contactless method.
Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS): Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is used to assess 
gastrointestinal and lung diseases. The machine generates high-frequency sound 
waves and passes the same in the body through the endoscope. When used, the EUS 
produces a clear and detailed image of the lining and walls of the digestive tract like 
the pancreas, liver and lymph nodes and chest along with other nearby organs.
Enteroscope: An enteroscope is a device used to see inside the small bowel. This 
procedure is basically an endoscopy procedure and is used for the diagnosis and 
treatment of different types of digestive conditions.
Manometry Unit: The manometry system is used to evaluate the motor func￾tions of the oesophagus and for information for the diagnosis of diseases like acha￾lasia, dysphagia and hiatal hernia.
Upper Gastrointestinal Scope: An upper gastrointestinal (UGI) is used to 
examine the inside lining of the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. The scope is 
inserted from the mouth and gently moved down the throat and fnally into the 
oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. The camera and light mounted on the tip of 
the scope having a light bulb camera take the images under bright light conditions 
and transmit the images to the central processing unit for further processing of 
the images.
Upper GI Endoscope PEDIA: An upper gastrointestinal (UGI) is the same as in 
adults but with the difference that the scope is of smaller diameter and is used for 
paediatric patients.
Video Processor: The processor is used for processing and displaying the image 
received from the endoscopes.

Doppler Ultrasound for Foetal Evaluation: Doppler ultrasound is used in 
pregnancy to study blood circulation in the baby, uterus and placenta. A machine is 
an ultrasound machine and it uses sound waves to detect the movement of blood in 
vessels.
Heracell CO2 Incubator: The CO2 incubator provides optimal growth condi￾tions to enhance cell growth. Heracell CO2 incubators provide accurate, uniform 
and reliable culturing conditions. It provides samples with a uniform temperature, 
CO2 and humidity in the incubator.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Heracell CO2 Incubator:
Apart from the standard requirements, installation of the CO2 Incubator 
requires a connection and port for the supply of Carbon Dioxide gas. The source 
can either be the standalone CO2 cylinder or the centralised CO2 gas pipe line of 
the hospital.

ICE-lined Refrigerator: Ice-lined refrigerators are used to store vaccines in an 
ideal environment and to store blood bags. The temperature range of ice-lined 
refrigerator is from +2 °C to +8 °C.
Infantometer: Infantometer is for measuring the size (Length) of infants.
Infusion Pumps: An infusion pump is used to deliver medications, IV fuids and 
nutrients, to a patient’s body in preset and controlled volume or amount.
Multipara Monitor: This monitor is used to keep track of the vital of the patient. 
Generally, the fxed parameters are heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, respi￾ratory rate and temperature. Apart from these fxed parameters, the module’s other 
parameters can also be attached to the device like EtCo2, etc.
Neonatal CPAP (Bubble): Bubble CPAP, a noninvasive ventilation device, pro￾vides positive airway pressure (CPAP) which is delivered for the spontaneous 
breathing of newborns to maintain lung volumes during expiration, hence, is used 
for newborns with infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS).
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Neonatal CPAP:
As CPAP is used to provide oxygen to newborns, an oxygen port shall be pro￾vided near the CPAP machine. The supply source can be from the standalone oxy￾gen cylinder or the central oxygen pipe line of the hospital. As a backup, it is advised 
to provide one spare port of oxygen, so that it can be used in case of failure of the 
working port.
Oxygen Hoods: An oxygen hood is a dome or box made out of plastic-like mate￾rial having the facility of being warmed and humidifed oxygen inside. The oxygen 
hood is used for babies who can breathe on their own but still need extra oxygen.
Pediatric Ventilator: Paediatric ventilator is used for critically ill children, who 
require total or partial assistance to maintain adequate breathing. This invasive ven￾tilator provides breathing support to the child purely temporarily.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Invasive Paediatric Ventilator:
The invasive ventilator with the help of compressed air mixes the oxygen and 
forces it into the lungs of the baby at a very slow rate, hence providing supportive 
breathing. Therefore, the ventilator requires compressed air and oxygen to ventilate 
the patient. Hence, apart from the routine installation requirements, the ports of 
centralised compressed air (4 bar) and oxygen shall be provided near the ventilator. 
As a backup, it is advised to provide one spare port for both the air and oxygen, so 
that it can be used in case of failure of the working port.
Another important issue is to attach the humidifer along with the ventilator to 
humidify the oxygen being given to the baby.
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing393

15.21 Oncology
See Table 15.21.
Brachytherapy: Brachytherapy involves the induction of a radioactive sub￾stance into the patient’s body. Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy used to 
treat cancer. Brachytherapy is a method of radiating tumours in which radioactive 
sources are placed either in the tumour tissue or close to the tumour. Brachytherapy 
is also referred to as internal radiation.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Brachytherapy Machine:
While designing the Brachytherapy Unit, the following issues shall be considered:
1. The brachytherapy treatment room is used to deliver a radiation source through 
a tube or applicator implanted during surgery.
2. The brachytherapy room is similar to that of the external beam irradiation unit,
i.e., a bunker must be provided for brachytherapy. Therefore, all issues related to 
the bunkers must be addressed as mentioned above at LINAC.
3. In addition to the brachytherapy unit, there must be an equipped operating room 
with other facilities such as an anaesthesia induction room, washroom, recovery 
room, clean room, etc.
4. C-arm shall be provided in the brachytherapy unit for the placement of the appli￾cator, which shall be installed either in the procedure room or in the treatment 
room, depending on local practises.
5. The brachytherapy bunker shall have a wall and ceiling thickness of at least 
1000 mm.

6. The illustrated labyrinth is 1800 mm wide to allow easy access in case of emer￾gency, and the illustrated structure has no door.
7. The internal dimensions of the room are 4000 mm × 4000 mm × 3600 mm high 
(ceiling height 3000 mm) to allow suffcient space around the unit for manoeu￾vring a C-Arm and treatment cart when preparing the patient in the treat￾ment room.
8. Since the radiation source emits isotopic radiation, a shielded roof is required.
9. Apart from the wall thickness and dimensions of the brachytherapy bunkers, all 
other aspects of the LINAC bunkers must be considered when designing the bun￾kers for brachytherapy.
Cyber Knife 6MV: Cyber Knife is a system for Stereotactic Radio Surgery 
(SRS). SRS is a combination of principles of stereotactic or three-dimensional tar￾get radiation. In this procedure, beams from multiple directions strike the tumour at 
the exact location of interest. Because of its high precision, it is possible to direct 
higher doses of radiation to the target area with minimal damage to normal tissue 
and structures surrounding the tumour.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Cyber Knife:
As the Cyber Knife is also a high radiation machine, the infrastructure for instal￾lation, commissioning and testing shall be the same as that of the Linear Accelerator 
as mentioned under the head liner accelerator below.
Linac Linear Accelerators: A linear accelerator, also known as LINAC, is a 
device used to deliver external beam radiation to cancer patients. A linear accelera￾tor is a type of particle accelerator that accelerates charged subatomic particles or 
ions to a high velocity by exposing them to a series of oscillating electrical poten￾tials along a linear beam path.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Linear accelerator:
While designing the external beam radiation unit, the following issues shall be 
considered:
1. External beam radiotherapy LINAC shall be installed in bunkers. The bunkers 
shall be constructed of high-density RCC materials such as concrete or steel.
2. The wall thickness of the bunker is usually 2400 mm in primary areas. The roof 
also has a thickness of 2400 mm in the primary area.
3. The bunkers have a maze-like structure.
4. The interior space of the bunkers has a size of 7000 mm × 7000 mm, with the 
iso-centre approximately in the middle of the space.
5. The bunkers shall offer an area for the shape of the LINAC unit and the most 
longitudinal extension of a standard patient treatment desk.
6. The gantry and the patient treatment table shall be engineered to rotate round 
an iso-centre.
7. The width shall allow comfortable access around the gantry and the patient for 
all angles of rotation.
15.21 Oncology404
8. The plane of gantry rotation shall be parallel to the treatment control panel 
vicinity.
9. At the same time as designing the orientation of the bunkers, the issues of exces￾sive occupancy areas shall be taken into consideration.
10. The minimal structural room height shall be four meters, together with the 
maze. This height is vital for ease of getting admission while equipment is 
installed to offer the air conditioning, heating, exhaust and air fow device 
design, and for installing extra electrical deliver cabling.
11. A maze width of 2000 mm–2200 mm shall be provided to ensure an adequate 
turning circle for gadget shipping.
12. LINAC is a very heavy machine weighing about 8–9 tonnes. As a result, the 
fooring needs to be very strong to endure this type of weight.
13. While installing LINAC for the frst time, provision for the base-frame shall be 
provided. This base frame shall be measured from the centre to the back and 
shall be 6000 mm × 2000 mm × 610 mm deep excavation.
14. Two or more bunkers shall be designed adjoining each other to lessen costs by 
sharing the primary shielding.
15. The door shall be provided at the end of the maze, i.e. access to the bunkers, just 
to avoid unintentional entry inside the bunkers at the same time as the radiation 
is in progress. This door need not have shielding as this door is not for protection 
from radiation, but to offer a physical barrier and restrict access in the bunkers.
16. Getting admission to all through radiation shall be averted with an aggregate 
of mild sensors and/or push gates or barriers which might be interlocked to the 
control panel.
17. Usually, the bunker occupies 1.5 foors till the top of the bunker. Access to the 
roof of the bunkers shall be confned and cordoned off, with a security entrance, 
interlocked to the machine.
18. The equipment like the water chillier and the air-conditioning plants can be 
placed on the roof, as these varieties of the system require controlled access.
19. Linear accelerator bunkers require radiation protection that could include 
leading protection and concrete partitions, foors and ceilings to distinctive 
thicknesses. A neutron door can also be required relying on the type of linear 
accelerator used.
20. The radiation protection needs of the unit shall be assessed by using a licensed 
physicist or suitable agency. This assessment is to specify the sort, place and 
quantity of protection to be installed according to the fnal permitted layout and 
system choice. The radiation safety necessities shall be incorporated into the 
fnal plans and specs. An early session with the producers of radiotherapy 
equipment is usually recommended.
21. For LINAC with a maximum power of 10 MV, neutron defence is not always 
required.
22. The lifespan of the facility and the need to improve technology ought to be taken 
into consideration while specifying the radiation shielding required. It is far 
possible that the machines might be upgraded and more recent machines may 
or may not emit more potent radiation. Consequently, it is sensible to permit the 
highest energy system and widest beam that is likely to be used in the future.
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing405
23. The bunker shall be supplied with plumbing and electric provisions. The under￾ground conduits for these lines shall now not be straight but should be angu￾lated on the attitude of 45 tiers.
24. The bunker shall be provided with the provision of power being delivered to the 
LINAC according to the requirement of the machine. Therefore, the manufac￾turer of the gadget shall be contacted in advance even before designing the 
bunkers.
25. Provisions for joints, ducting and sleeves should not comply with the diver￾gence of the number one beam, and this is effortlessly executed by setting those 
in the secondary defensive and using a curved path.
26. The provisions of the mechanical, electric and safety shall all be taken into 
consideration like supplying dimmable lighting inside the room, emergency 
switches and the provision of standby lights.
27. Provision for ducting shall be provided in the bunker for connection between 
the gantry structure and the treatment control panel.
28. Further, isolated ducts should be provided for dosimeter cables and connectiv￾ity to the chiller system.
29. After the installation of the gadget, false ceilings shall be furnished within the 
bunkers.
30. Each bunker shall be furnished with control rooms. Those regions shall be posi￾tioned outdoors in the maze of the bunker.
31. The bunkers shall be supplied with a patient intercommunication tool and at 
least two closed-circuit tv monitors, to speak with the patient whilst the therapy 
is in development.
32. The working top within the control area shall be of adequate length to provide 
spaces to set up all of the video display units and other control devices in con￾junction with the patient information documents, sheets and images to be used 
at the same time as therapy is in progress.
33. Electric power outlets shall be provided alongside the whole length of the work￾top to allow a connection of devices to be powered, consisting of extra emer￾gency switches.
34. The X-ray viewing box with ambient lighting fxtures shall be provided inside 
the control room.
35. The area shall be provided alongside the control room for a networked imager 
or printer. This facility can also be shared with brachytherapy.

in case the coronary heart unexpectedly stops. This device is also a life-saving device.
EES Generator (Harmonic): The harmonic scalpel is similar to surgical cau￾tery but more advances and is used to cut and cauterise tissue concurrently.
Elec. Surgical Cautery: Electrosurgical cautery is used to cut and cauterise the 
tissue with a pencil-like probe connected to the device. With this pencil probe tech￾nique, the tissue is heated by using a high-voltage DC and is heated up.
Headlight: A headlight is a LED light equipped with microscopic lenses and is 
used for microsurgery or routine exam additionally.
Heavy Duty OT: Heavy duty tables are the tables which have more weight￾bearing capacities and are generally used for Bariatric patients.
Hyperthermia System, Extracorporeal: The hyperthermia system is to raise 
the overall core body temperature as much as 107–108 °F which helps in killing the 
malignant cells, that is often carried out by using hot water blankets or thermal 
chambers, which resemble massive, human-sized incubators.
Insuffator: Insuffator is to blow CO2 in the belly while performing the laparo￾scopic surgery.
Laparoscopy Set: Laparoscopes are thin telescopes ftted with a cold light 
source and a video digital camera on the distal end. These scopes pass inside the 
body, and the image is captured by digicam underneath brighter situations and

displayed on the screen. The laparoscopic gadgets are passed inside the body of the 
patient through the laparoscope, and the favoured surgical operation is accomplished.
Laser Scalpel: The light scalpel is a CO2 laser which produces a concentrated 
beam of light. The particularly focused CO2 laser beam vaporises and seals the 
blood vessels concurrently very cleanly and exactly.
LED Monitor Medical Grade: A LED scientifc monitor is a display that meets 
the high needs of clinical imaging. Medical monitor normally includes unique 
picture-enhancing technologies to make sure constant brightness, ergonomic read￾ing, noise-free photographs and automated compliance with DICOM and different 
medical standards.

light and transmits it to the end of the endoscope through the fbre-optic cable. The 
light source is available with halogen bulbs or LED bulbs.
Microprocessor-Controlled Electrosurgical Unit: ESU is a surgical cautery 
for cutting and cauterisation. However, it is managed through the fast microproces￾sor for processing all operating parameters.
Mobile Ultrasound System: Transportable ultrasound is a small and light device 
and is largely used within the OR or the patient’s bed for an ultrasound. The gadget 
operates with a battery power backup.
Modular Operation Theatre with Pendants: Modular running theatre is a the￾atre constructed with modules having a provision of air fltration through HEPA 
flters and air waft in a laminar fashion. It includes a modular wall, ceiling with 
slanted panels, control unit, plenum, PDR and HEPA flters with a provision of 
laminar foat to maintain the effective positive air pressure inside the OR. The OR 
has facility of electrical outlets and medical gas outlets alongside the surgical or 
anaesthetic pendants.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Modular Operating Rooms:
There are extraordinary styles of OR as follows:
There are different types of OR as follows:
1. Simple room OR.
2. Prefabricated modular OR.
3. Semimodular OR.
4. Modular OR.
5. Hybrid OR.
Simple Room OR: These are the simplest type of operating rooms without a 
precise provision of sterility, no environment consideration and no air exchanges. In 
these OR:
1. There is no specifc size of such OR and are purely built-up as per the require￾ment of the promotor.
2. The walls of the OR are all just simply plastered.
3. On the walls, either washable paint or glazed tiles are affxed.
4. The ceiling is normally plastered or at the maximum POP false ceiling is used.
15.22 Operating Rooms410
5. The fooring may be of everyday marble stone or glazed tiles.
6. The doorways can be of normal wood door or aluminium.
7. The OT is just placed in the centre of the room.
8. OT light is fxed at the ceiling in the centre of the room.
9. A proper pipeline for medical gases is not laid down.
10. For air conditioning, generally, split air conditioners are used.
Prefabricated Modular OR: These are the most commonly used type of operat￾ing room. They are evolved inside a room having partitions. These ORs fulfl the 
maximum needs of an ideal OR like sterility, environment, temperature, humidity, 
air exchanges, cleanliness, air fow, internal pressure, etc. The details of these ORs 
are as follows:
Size of the OR: Standard size of these ORs shall be 6096 mm × 6096 mm, i.e. 
37.16 m2
. But, for specialised surgeries such as Neuro, Cardiac, Robotic Surgery,
etc., the size has to be bigger and shall be about 46.45 m2
. Still further, for trans￾plant surgical procedures like renal, liver and coronary transplants, the area shall 
be about 74.32 m2
.
Walls of the OR: Walls of these types of ORs are artifcially created in front of 
the pre-built brick walls. Initially, the prefabricated panels are fxed on the wall. 
These panels are then arranged on the walls and fxed with rod fasteners about 
152 mm–254 mm far from the wall, hence creating a vacuum between the wall and 
the panel to further reduce the thermal losses. These sets of panels are now welded 
to each other so that no space is left between the panels. The extra welding spots are 
grinded to smoothen the panel surface. These panels have to be arranged in such a 
fashion that there are no sharp 90° corners because corners are not allowed in the 
ORs. Instead, the panels are laid and welded in such a fashion so that the angle of 
the corners are at 45° instead of 90°.
The ceiling of the OR: The ceiling of these ORs is likewise fabricated from the 
puff panel similar to that of the wall panels. In the centre of the OR, a Plenum is 
hung from the ceiling with the help of screw rod fasteners. Just in the centre of the 
Plenum, a round cut-out is given to hang the OT light from the ceiling. As no sharp 
corners are allowed in the ceiling also, slanted panels are provided on the vertical 
panels, which shall ultimately be jointed and welded to the ceiling panels.
Corners of OR: All four corners of the OR shall be covered and protected. First 
of all, the return air duct, which is a vertical duct fabricated from an aluminium 
sheet, is fxed with clamps screwed to the wall on all four corners of the OR. The 
leftover spaces in the corners, where the wall panels were not fxed earlier, are cov￾ered with the same type of puff panel as was fxed to the wall. These corner panels 
shall also be installed at a 45° angle to avoid corners.
Door of the OR: A prefabricated puff door shall be installed. The width of the 
door shall not be less than 1524 mm. This door shall be a hermetically sealed door, 
which enables sealing of all the surfaces of the door and wall and shall not permit 
any leakage of air in or out of OR. These doors can either be manually operated 
with a handle or can be motor-driven.
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing411
Window in OR: The window in the OR is fxed on the outer wall of the OR. The 
size of the window may be 610 mm–1000 mm in width and approximately 610 mm 
in height. The windows shall be a fxed type and not openable. The glass of the win￾dows shall be double-glazed glass with a vacuum in between. In the vacuum space, 
between two layers of glass, vanishing blinds can be provided, which shall be 
motorised and controlled by a switch button or remote.
Pass-Through Windows/Hatch Boxes: These are provided in the OR to pass 
clean supplies and material inside the OR without opening the doors of the OR. This 
window has two doors opening on both sides. While designing these windows, 
unique attention shall be paid that at any moment, only one door can be opened. If 
the material has to be passed from the outside of the OR, the outer door shall be 
opened and the inner door on the OR side shall be automatically locked. Once the 
outer door is closed, the inner door shall be opened and the outer shall automati￾cally be locked. This shall be applicable visa-versa also.
Plenum: As stated earlier, the plenum is a box-type structure hung from the ceil￾ing. Its main purpose is to fx HEPA flters for air fltration and form a unidirec￾tional glide of air. The plenum is closed from the bottom end either by fxing a 
framed silken fabric or by way of a stainless steel sheet which has multiple holes for 
the passage of the air.
Control Panel: The control panel is recessed in the panelled wall next to the 
entrance of the OR. This panel is used to control and govern the functioning of the 
entire OR. Normally, the control panel can manage the functions like OT light, ple￾num lights, peripheral lights, clock, time elapsed, hand-free intercom, temperature 
meter, medical gases pressure, humidity meter and the music system (if provided).
Writing Board: A magnetic white writing board is also recessed in the panelled 
wall adjoining the view box located in front of the surgeon.
View Box: The LED view box is recessed in the panelled wall which shall be 
located in front of the surgeon for easy visibility, while the surgeon is operating.
Pressure Relief Damper (PRD): To reduce the excess pressure in the OR, the 
PRD is installed. PRD is a set of stainless-steel fns connected at a specifc distance, 
and a stainless-steel weight is welded on one of the fns. The PDR is ftted at the 
bottom in the cut-out of a wall of the OR. This PDR automatically opens in case the 
pressure in the OR increases and automatically closes once the pressured reaches 
with in the normal limits in the OR.
Flooring: The OR shall have anti-static fooring, i.e. they have adequate earth￾ing properties. It is PVC fooring with a layer of carbon coating at the bottom. As 
soon as the tile or roll is glued, the joints are thermowelded with a PVC twine to fll 
any gaps in the fooring.
Painting: All surfaces (walls and ceiling) of the OR shall be painted. First of all, 
a coat of primer is applied. Then, the metal putty is applied to fll any gaps. After 
scrubbing the surfaces with sandpaper, at least two coats of washable antibacterial 
and anti-fungal paint shall be applied.
Peripheral Lights: In the straight panel of the ceiling of the OR, peripheral 
lights are recessed. The peripheral lights are LED lights packed in a unit and have 
15.22 Operating Rooms412
the facility of a dimmer. Usually, 8 such lights are fxed in the OR, two on each facet 
of the OR. These lights have a provision for dimming or switching off as per the 
choice of the surgeon.
Plenum Lights: Plenum lights are usually a set of about 15–30 LED tube lights 
fxed in the plenum. These lights have a provision for dimming or switching off as 
per the choice of the surgeon. These lights give an excellent look, and the OR bright￾ens up when these lights are switched on.
Anaesthetist Pendant: At the left-hand side of the patient, an anaesthetist pen￾dant shall be hung from the ceiling. The pendants can either be single-arm or 
double-arm pendants. The pendant ends up with a square or rectangular box-type 
structure. On the back wall of the pendant box, the outlets of medical gases shall be 
fxed. Two outlets of each supply, i.e. oxygen, suction, compressed air and vacuum 
shall be provided. On both, sidewalls of the box of pendant, electric and communi￾cation ports shall be provided. On the front wall of the pendant box, a service tray 
and drawers shall be provided.
Surgeon Pendant: On the right-hand side of the patient, a surgeon pendant can 
be given, if required. This is generally a fxed arm pendant which can simply revolve 
on its axis. This pendant is especially utilised by the surgeon and has electrical 
outlets on the sidewalls and a couple of of-three trays.
Air Conditioning and Environment of ORs: The OR shall be fully air￾conditioned, allowing manipulation of temperature, humidity and air exchanges. 
Suitable and safe air quality must always be maintained in the OR.
Special Air Requirements for OR: Based on the biological load and the area 
of the OR, the minimum total air changes shall be 20. Out of 20 air changes, the 
fresh air component of the air change shall be a minimum of 4. The airfow needs to 
be downwards on the OR table and shall be unidirectional. It is suggested that the 
velocity of the air shall be 25–35 FPM (feet per minute) from a non-aspirating uni￾directional laminar fow diffuser/ceiling array. The minimum positive pressure rec￾ommended is 2.5 Pascal (0.01 inches of water). Air shall be supplied through 
terminal HEPA flters installed in the plenum suspended from the ceiling. The HEPA 
flters can be at the AHU level or the terminal level inside the OR. AHU is the air 
purifcation and fltration unit. There shall be two sets of washable fange-type fl￾ters of effciency 90% down to 10 microns and 99% down to 5 microns with alu￾minium/stainless steel 304 frames within the AHU. The temperature inside the OR 
shall be maintained at 21 °C ± 3 °C (except for joint replacement where it shall be 
18 °C ± 2 °C). Similarly, the relative humidity shall be between 20 and 60%, though 
the ideal relative humidity is considered to be 55%.
Electrical Outlets: Suffcient number of electrical outlets shall be provided in 
the OR for connecting the medical/electrical appliances. It is recommended that at 
least two dual sets of 6/16 amp (it means 4 outlets) switch/sockets shall be provided 
on each wall of the OR. Importantly, all these electrical outlets shall have a supply 
through the UPS for an uninterrupted supply of power.
Other Communication Points in OR: R.J. 45 points for computer networking, 
R.J. 11 for Intercom and extension line shall be provided in each OR.
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing413
Modular OR: These types of OR are such where the complete structure is fabri￾cated using angles, sheets and channels, and other specialised sections made of 
either mild steel or stainless steel. These fabricated structures then are assembled, 
at a particular location demarked for OR, to give it a shape of a room-like structure. 
Henceforth, the prefabricated wall panels and ceiling panels are fxed in these fab￾ricated structures to make them a room.
Hybrid OR: It is an OR where multidisciplinary integration is done by combin￾ing advanced imaging diagnostics and surgery to the operating table, which allows 
surgeons, radiologists and other health care providers to use real-time images for 
guidance and assessment during complex surgeries. As different types of procedures 
such as cardiac, vascular and neurosurgery are performed in a hybrid OR, it 
requires a variety of imaging equipment to be used. Some examples of commonly 
installed imaging equipment in a hybrid OR are Angiography Equipment (Cathlab), 
Computed Tomography (CT) Scanners, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
Scanners, C-arm, X-ray, and Digital Subtraction Angiography Systems (DSA). A 
hybrid OR shall be at least 1.5 times larger than a normal OR.
Morcellator: A power morcellator is usually used during laparoscopic surgery to 
cut bigger chunks of tissue into smaller ones.

the patient is in an anaesthesia workstation. At times, this monitor is also used to 
monitor the vital parameters of sick patients in the ICU.
OT Light: An OT light is a ceiling-mounted LED/Halogen light used for surgery 
in the OR to aluminate the surgical feld. This light is a high-lumen light and facility 
to adjust the lumens as per the requirement of the surgeon. These lights are shadow 
less and cool lights and do not generate heat.
OT: An operating table is a table used to lay down the patient for surgery. The 
table is a multipositional adjustment table and has a provision to fx the required 
attachments to ease specialised surgeries like the spine and orthopaedic etc. Tables 
with different operating mechanisms are available like hydraulically operated, elec￾trically operated or a combination of both.
Pneumatic Tourniquet Electric: Pneumatic tourniquet is to apply and hold a 
pre-determined pressure on the arterial blood fow, through cuffs. This is required to 
create an environment for a bloodless surgical feld. The machine consists of a 
pressure-regulated control unit with infatable cuffs.

obstruction from a patient’s airway and is a tracheostomy-care device. By the tech￾nique of negative pressure, the machine help to create suction to pull out mucus, 
blood, secretions, saliva or other fuids stuck up in the airway, thereby clearing the 
airway for easy breathing.
Surgical Loupe: Surgical loupe is a device to enhance and magnify the feld of 
surgery and is generally head wearable.
Surgical Operating Instruments: For any type of surgery, the surgeon apart 
from equipment needs a set of instruments to perform surgeries. The basic instru￾ments are like scissors, artery forceps, BP handle, Babcock, retractor, needle holder, 
dissecting forceps, speculum, etc. Further, every item of an instrument may have 
different variants based on shapes and sizes. The instruments shall be procured as 
per the recommendation of the surgeon.

lithotripsy and is used in urology. The Holmium laser operates at 2120 nm and pro￾vides energy via optical fbres with core diameters starting from 200 μm to1000 μm.
Nephroscope: Nephroscope is used for a procedure called PCNL wherein small 
kidney stones and small tumours is removed from the kidney. In the process, through 
a small cut, the nephroscope is inserted inside the kidney to remove stones up to 
about 1 cm.
Paediatric Cystoscope: Paediatric cystoscope is slim in design as compared to 
the adult cystoscope. Cystoscopes varying different sizes and types like straight or 
angled channels and angled or straight ocular, both with 70o direction of view and 
4.2 Fr channel.
Resectoscope: Resectoscope is used to cut, remove or destroy tissue and control 
bleeding and also used to remove tissue from the body.
Urethrotome: Urethrotome is an endoscopic device and is used to treat urethral 
stricture under direct visualisation. This instrument consists of a knife blade that is 
deployed by the surgeon during surgeries.

Arthroscope Set with Accessories for Knee and Shoulder: Arthroscope is an 
endoscope-like instrument which is smaller in size. It is just about the size of a pen￾cil and is used for arthroscopic surgeries of joints like the knee and shoulder. An 
arthroscope consists of a lighting bulb, camera and lens mounted on the distal end 
of the arthroscope, which allows a surgeon to view inside a joint. The surgeries with 
the help of an arthroscope are performed through small incisions and the joint need 
not be fully opened.

Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Gamma Camera machine:
For details of infrastructure requirements for installation, commissioning and 
testing of the Gamma Camera please refer to Sect. 15.23 under the heading of 
‘Radiology’ in this chapter under the topic of Nuclear PET CT/PET MRI, because 
the Gamma Camera is also a nuclear scan similar to that of PET CT/PER MRI.
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing423
Computed Tomography (CT): CT is a computerised X-ray imaging-based 
machine consisting of the X-ray tube and the detectors opposite to each other and is 
placed in a single circular gantry. The patient is laid down between the gantry and 
the narrow beam of X-rays is aimed at the patient and the gantry is rotated around 
the body at a high speed. These X-ray beams after passing through the body of the 
patient are captured by the detectors on the other end of the gantry. The X-rays 
detected by the detectors are sent to the processing unit for processing. The process￾ing unit generates the cross-sectional images or slices of the body and displays the 
same on the screen. This is also called the spiral CT.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of CT Scan Rooms:
A separate zone for the CT Scan shall be created in the department of radiology. 
As this machine is also X-ra- based and when exposure is given, a very high dose of 
X-rays is produced. Therefore, special care needs to be taken while designing the 
CT room. Before designing the CT scan room, the guidelines and norms of the 
controlling authority of the country shall be taken into account. Like in India, 
Baba Atomic Research Institute issues all such norms and guidelines.
CT Scan Machine Room:
There shall be a separate room for each machine.
If the machine has to be installed horizontally, a rectangular room shall be 
designed. If the machine is to be installed diagonally, a square room design would 
be better. The space of the room shall not be less than 42 m2
, and the room size, if 
rectangular, shall be 9144 mm × 4572 mm.
The ideal thickness for the primary wall of a CT scan room shall be at least 
250 mm solid baked clay bricks, and 150 mm mortar/concrete walls for plain radi￾ography. All the walls of the room shall be plastered from both sides. Hollow bricks 
if used for the walls, shall be plastered with a 6 mm thick barium plaster and shall 
be protected up to 2200 mm from the foor level.
Flooring inside the CT scan room can be of tiles/marble/granite, but it shall not 
be slippery to avoid accidents and injury to the patient.
Air interlocks are suggested to be provided by placing an additional door before 
the CT room door.
The door of the CT scan room shall be at least 1500 mm wide and 2000 mm high. 
Doors should overlap by a minimum of 100 mm on each side when closed. The 
doors shall have a proper 2 mm thick lead lining. This lead lining is also required 
even on the door frame. Once the door is ready, it shall be tested for any leakage of 
radiation and ensured that there is no leakage of the radiation from any place in 
the door.
In the CT scan room, windows are not allowed.
Outside the door of the CT room, a warning light (red colour bulb) shall be pro￾vided. This warning light must be connected to the X-ray generator of the CT scan 
in such a fashion, that it illuminates only during the tube activation.
While installing the machine, ensure to leave at least 1829 mm space behind the 
machine for the Gantry of the CT scan to tilt. This space shall also help in the easy 
15.23 Radiology424
maintenance of the machine. Try to install the CT scan in the centre of the room 
width-wise.
Depending on the electric load required by the CT scan, the power load shall be 
calculated and the supply cable and main switch shall be terminated in each CT 
scan room separately for each machine.
CT scan being heavier in weight and the movement of the gantry of the machine 
is very fast, weight-bearing capacity of the foor shall be checked. If required, a 
foundation for the CT scan shall be provided as per the suggestions of the original 
manufacturer of the machine.
For mounting the machine on the foor or foundation, a base plate with desired 
mounting anchor fasteners, as specifed by the original manufacturer of the machine, 
shall be provided.
For lighting in the CT scan room, provide normal LED, with the suffcient lumen. 
Extra illumination in the room shall be avoided.
The temperature inside the CT scan room shall range between 18 and 21 °C. The 
humidity level shall be less than 60%.
Proper ground earthing provision shall be provided in the room.
As far as the piped medical gas supply in the CT scan room is concerned, provide 
1 outlet for oxygen, 1 for vacuum and 1 for air.
An effective two-way audio system shall be provided in the CT room, so that the 
technician sitting in the control room can direct the patient, without entering the 
CT room.
While positioning the gantry and couch in the room, position them in such a 
fashion that the patient is completely visible to the technician from the control con￾sole during scanning.
To hang the lead aprons, a stand with heavy-duty hangers shall be provided out￾side each room of the CT Scan.
To safely keep other radiation safety devices like lead goggles, lead collars, lead 
gloves, groin guards, etc., a cabinet shall be provided in each CT scan room.
A control room attached to the CT scan room needs to be provided. Strictly 
ensure that no person shall be allowed to enter the machine room while the scan is 
in progress. All controls shall be carried out only from the control room. The size of 
the control room shall be 3658 mm × 3658 mm. In the control room, a table to 
install the Control Unit of the machine shall be provided. Also, the provision shall 
be made to provide a secondary computer for transferring the CT images for pre￾paring reports. To ensure no leakage of the radiation from the CT scan room to the 
control room, a lead glass (provided with the machine) of about 1200 mm × 1000 mm 
shall be provided between the CT scan room and the control room. To install the 
lead glass, the glass shall be fxed in a wooden frame with 2 mm lead lining and 
fxed in the opening of the wall, provided for this purpose. To print CT flms, a cam￾era (printer) shall also be provided in the control room.
CT scan is an electronic machine that requires a continuous power supply. 
Therefore, consider providing the UPS room attached to the CT room. The size of 
this room shall be about 3658 mm × 3658 mm with several racks to install batteries. 
Because of the acid in the batteries, sometimes fumes are formed in the UPS room. 
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing425
Therefore, an exhaust shall be provided in the UPS room. Similarly, the UPS also 
generates a large amount of heat; thus, the room shall be properly air-conditioned 
and the temperature of about 17–20 °C shall be maintained with a relative humidity 
of not more than 40%. Earthing of this UPS is essential.
The CT scan machine consists of the main gantry where the X-ray tube and 
detectors are fxed. All other electronic parts are provided in the panels connected 
to the gantry. It is recommended that for better protection of these electronic panels, 
these panels shall be installed in a different room or enclosure, attached to the CT 
scan room.
A change room shall be provided near the CT scan room to enable the patient to 
remove all outside clothes and change into a hospital dress. The size of the change 
room shall be approximately 3048 mm × 3048 mm. the change room shall have a 
provision of personal lockers to keep patient belongings. Also, hooks, hanger rods 
and hangers shall be provided to hang clothes. A cabinet to keep sterilised dresses 
shall also be provided.
Cyclotron/Radio Pharmacy: A cyclotron is used to manufacture short-lived 
radioactive isotopes that can be used for medical imaging.
Densitometer, Bone (Dexa Scan): To measure the mineral density of the bone, 
bone densitometer is used. To perform the procedure, a small dose of ionizing radia￾tion is used to produce pictures of organs like the lower spine or hips to measure 
bone loss.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Dexa Scan Machine:
DEXA Scan Machine Room: Dexa Scan room is an area where there is an 
exposure of X-rays to the patient. Before designing the radiography rooms, the 
guidelines and norms of the controlling authority of the country must be taken 
into account. Like in India, Baba Atomic Research Institute issues all such 
norms and guidelines.
Some of the important points related to the designing of the radiography rooms 
are as follows:
For each Dexa Scan, a separate room shall be provided.
The room can either be square room or rectangular, depending on the design of 
the designer. Size wise the room shall not be less than 10 m2
.
The ideal thickness for the primary wall of a Dexa Scan room shall be at least 
250 mm solid baked clay bricks, and 150 mm mortar/concrete walls for plain radi￾ography. All the walls of the room shall be plastered from both sides. Hollow bricks 
if used for the walls shall be plastered with a 6 mm thick barium plaster and shall 
be protected up to 2200 mm from the foor level.
Flooring inside the Dexa Scan room can be of tiles/marble/granite, but it shall 
not be slippery to avoid accidents and injury to the patient.
Air Interlocks are suggested to be provided by placing an additional door before 
the Dexa room door.
The door of the Dexa Scan room shall be at least 1000 mm wide and 2000 mm 
high. Doors should overlap by a minimum of 100 mm on each side when closed. The 
doors shall have a proper 2 mm thick lead lining. This lead lining is also required 
15.23 Radiology426
even on the door frame. Once the door is ready, it shall be tested for any leakage of 
radiation and ensured that there is no leakage of the radiation from any place in 
the door.
In the Dexa Scan room, windows are not allowed.
Outside the door of the Dexa Scan Room, a warning light (red colour bulb) shall 
be provided. This warning light must be connected to the X-ray generator of the 
Dexa Scan in such a fashion, that it illuminates only during the tube activation.
To protect the staff from radiation exposure, a shielded barrier should be placed 
at the DEXA scan control console.
Depending on the electric load required by the Dexa Scan, the power load shall 
be calculated and the supply cable and main switch shall be terminated in each 
Dexa Scan room separately for each machine.
For lighting in the Dexa Scan room, provide normal LED, with the suffcient 
lumen. Extra illumination in the room shall be avoided.
The temperature inside the Dexa Scan room shall range between 18 and 
21 °C. The humidity level shall be less than 60%.
Proper ground earthing provision shall be provided in the room.
To hang the lead aprons, a stand with heavy-duty hangers shall be provided out￾side each room of Dexa Scan.
To safely keep other radiation safety devices like lead goggles, lead collars, lead 
gloves, groin guards, etc., a cabinet shall be provided in each Dexa Scan room.
Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA): Digital subtraction angiography 
(DSA) is a fuoroscopic technique and is used to visualise the soft tissues and the 
blood vessels inside the human body. This machine being X-ray-based, while per￾forming the procedure captures radiopaque structures such as bones. Subsequently, 
with the help of software in the DSA machine, these radiopaque substances are 
eliminated (‘subtracted’) digitally from these captured images, thus providing an 
accurate depiction of the opacifed soft tissues and blood vessels.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of DSA Unit:
As the DSA is more or less like the Cath lab and also a kind of X-ray-based 
machine with high doses of X-ray radiation, hence the requirements for installation, 
commissioning and testing will be more or less the same as for Cath Lab. Please 
refer to the topic of Cath Lab under the earlier heading in para number ‘9.5’ in 
‘Cardiology and Interventional Cardiology’ in this chapter.
Laser Imager Camera: These are dry imaging laser printers and are used to 
print multiformat images of digital radiology on the emulation coted X-ray flms.
Leakage Tester: Leakage tester is used for checking ant unwanted radiation 
leakage from within the source assembly except for the useful beam.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Spectroscopy: Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) is a magnetic and radio frequency-based machine. The machine 
uses a high-power magnetic feld and computer-generated controlled radio fre￾quency waves to create detailed images of the tissues and organs of the human body. 
These strong magnetic felds align the protons of the cell in a unidirectional fashion. 
Thereafter, the radio frequency waves are fred on the protons, due to which the 
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing427
protons oscillate. This oscillation is captured by the machine and after processing 
the image is produced.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of MRI Machine:
MRI Machine Room: Some of the important issues related to the designing of 
the MRI rooms are as follows:
For each MRI, a separate room shall be provided.
As MRI creates a very high magnetic feld, safety factors need to be considered 
when the installation of the MRI. The most crucial factor is to shield the magnet and 
procedure room from any external magnetic interferences, to ensure that the speci￾fed magnetic felds are not exceeded.
RF Shielding: As the MRI systems are highly sensitive to radio frequencies, the 
MRI machine shall be enclosed in a radio frequency (RF) shield. RF shield is essen￾tially a 6-sided copper-lined box around the room called a ‘Faraday Cage’ which 
protects the MRI system from exterior radio frequencies for the clarity of the scan. 
Though RF shielding can also be done with sheets made out of aluminium and gal￾vanised steel, copper is considered to be the best out of all the metals. Therefore, the 
wall of the MRI room shall often have three partitions, frst is the parent wall made 
out of clay brick, the second is RF shield fxed on the wall and the third is the inte￾rior fnishing of the wall. RF Shield is the actual metallic sheet, and the inner fnish￾ing is the artifcial decorative interior. The inner interior can be done using PVC 
panels, wooden panels or wallpapers etc.
The foor in the MRI exam room often has three layers. First is the structural 
subfoor, the second is the RF shielding and the third is the protective layer made 
out of fnishing materials. Subfoor is the originally constructed foor, RF shield is 
the metallic cage, and then the protective layer. The protective layer can be made of 
wood, as it does not affect the magnetic feld.
Another important factor while installing the MRI is to protect the public from a 
high magnetic feld. From the designing of protective, provisions shall be made to 
keep the public away from the most dangerous magnetic felds. The areas which are 
affected by the magnetic feld from the magnet’s iso-centre are called the Gauss 
Field. All the areas within the 5-Gauss line from the iso-centre are dangerous for 
anyone wearing ferrous metal or for any metal objects. Any metal object within the 
5-Gauss line will essentially become a part of the magnet and the magnet will force￾fully pull that metal object towards the iso-centre of the magnet. To avoid this and 
keep everyone safe, the designers shall design barriers to deter people from getting 
too close. Pacemakers, cell phones and credit cards are severely damaged when 
inside the 5-Gauss line.
MRI being heavier in weight, the weight-bearing capacity of the foor shall be 
checked. If required, a foundation for the MRI shall be provided as per the sugges￾tions of the original manufacturer of the machine.
For mounting the machine on the foor or foundation, a base plate with desired 
mounting anchor fasteners, as specifed by the original manufacturer of the machine, 
shall be provided.
Proper ground earthing provision shall be provided in the room.
15.23 Radiology428
While positioning the gantry and couch in the MRI room, position them in such 
a fashion that the patient is completely visible to the technician from the control 
console during the scanning.
Attached to the MRI scan room, a control room shall be provided. No person 
shall be allowed to enter the scan room while the procedure is going on. All controls 
shall be carried out from the control room only. The size of the control room shall 
be 3658 mm × 3658 mm. A meshed glass (provided with the machine) of about 
1200  mm  ×  1000  mm shall be fxed in a wooden frame with 2  mm lead lining 
between the MRI room and the control room to ensure no leakage of the radiation. 
To print MRI flms, a camera (printer) shall also be provided in the control room.
An effective two-way audio system shall be provided in the MRI room, so that the 
technician sitting in the control room can direct the patient, without entering the 
MRI room.
To safely keep other devices like phantoms, coils and other accessories of MRI
etc., a cabinet shall be provided in each MRI Scan room.
MRI is an electronic machine that requires a continuous power supply. It is more 
essential, as the cold head of the machine shall always be on, failing which the 
Helium gas flled in the magnet will boil, resulting in a potential lost. As UPS 
attached to the MRI is usually of high rating (above 150 KVA), a lot of batteries 
shall be required. Therefore, a separate room shall be provided for UPS of MRI. This 
room shall be attached to the MRI control room or the machine room. The size of 
this room shall be about 3658 mm ×3658 mm with several racks to install batteries. 
Because of the acid in the batteries, sometimes fumes are formed in the UPS room. 
Therefore, an exhaust shall be provided in the UPS room. Similarly, the UPS also 
generates a large amount of heat; thus, the room shall be properly air-conditioned, 
and the temperature of about 17–20 °C shall be maintained with a relative humidity 
of not more than 40%. Earthing of this UPS is essential.
The MRI machine consists of the main gantry where the magnet and RF devices 
are fxed. All other electronic parts are provided in the panels connected to the mag￾net. These panels control the working of the machine but are not directly needed in 
the MRI room. It is recommended that for better protection of these electronic pan￾els, these panels shall be installed in a different room or enclosure, attached to the 
MRI room.
While positioning the gantry and couch in the room, position them in such a 
fashion that the patient is completely visible to the technician from the control con￾sole during scanning.
Depending on the electric load required by the MRI, the power load shall be 
calculated and the supply cable and main switch shall be terminated in each MRI 
room separately for each machine.
The temperature inside the MRI scan room shall range between 16 and 20 °C. The 
humidity level shall be less than 60%.
For lighting in the MRI room, provide normal LED, with suffcient lumen. Extra 
illumination in the room shall be avoided.
Along with the MRI, a water chiller is required to cool down the gradient coil 
and liquid helium compressor. The whole refrigeration system of MRI is composed 
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing429
of a chiller, a helium compressor and a cold head. Through their joint work, the 
temperature inside the magnet is controlled at −269 °C, to maintain the supercon￾ducting state of the coil. To maintain this temperature inside the magnet, the heat of 
the superconducting coil is taken away by the vaporisation of liquid helium, which 
will cause the pressure inside the magnet to rise and thus the loss of liquid helium. 
If the MRI chiller fails, the entire refrigeration system will stop working; thus, it 
shall also be connected to the UPS for its continuous working. The chiller is usually 
installed outside the hospital building to keep it cool. It is provided with a water 
tank, from where the chiller takes the water, cools it and then sends it to the machine 
through a connected pipeline. This water cools the machine and returns to the 
chiller through a separate pipeline and is cooled again.
Change rooms shall be provided in the department to enable the patient to 
remove all outside clothes and change into a hospital dress. The room shall be 
approximately 3048 mm × 3048 mm in size. It shall have an adequate provision of 
personal lockers to keep patient belongings. Also, hooks, hanger rods and hangers 
shall be provided to hang clothes. There shall be a cabinet to keep sterilised dresses.
As far as the piped medical gas supply in the MRI room is concerned, provide 1 
outlet for oxygen, 1 for vacuum and 1 for air. The outlets of these medical gases 
shall be fxed on the wall outside the RF shield. From these outlets, the medical 
gases are supplied through the HP rubber hoses.
Mammographic Machine: Mammography is used for X-ray imaging of the 
breasts of female patients.
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of Mammographic machine:
Mammography Room: The mammography room is the actual room where the 
mammography machine is installed, and the exposure of X-rays is given to the 
patient. Before designing the radiography rooms, the guidelines and norms of 
the controlling authority of the country must be taken into account. Like in 
India, Baba Atomic Research Institute issues all such norms and guidelines.
Some of the important points related to the designing of the mammography 
rooms are as follows:
There shall be a separate room for each machine.
The room can either be a square room or rectangular ss designed by the designer, 
and the size of a room shall not be less than 10 m2
.
The ideal thickness for the primary wall of a mammography room shall be at 
least 250 mm of solid baked clay bricks and 150 mm mortar/concrete walls for plain 
radiography. All the walls of the room shall be plastered from both sides. Hollow 
bricks if used for the walls shall be plastered with a 6 mm thick barium plaster and 
shall be protected up to 2200 mm from the foor level.
No single wall dimension of the mammography room shall be less than 3000 mm.
Flooring inside the mammography room can be of tiles/marble/granite, but it 
shall not be slippery to avoid accidents and injury to the patient.
The door of the mammography room shall be at least 1000 mm wide and 2000 mm 
high. Doors should overlap by a minimum of 100 mm on each side when closed. The 
doors shall have a proper 2 mm thick lead lining. This lead lining is also required 
15.23 Radiology430
even on the door frame. Once the door is ready, it shall be tested for any leakage of 
radiation and ensured that there is no leakage of the radiation from any place in 
the door.
In the mammography room, windows are not allowed.
Outside the door of the mammography, a warning light (red colour bulb) shall be 
provided. This warning light must be connected to the X-ray generator of the mam￾mography in such a fashion that it illuminates only during the tube activation.
A shielded barrier should be placed at the mammography control console to 
protect the staff from radiation exposure.
Depending on the electric load required by the mammography, the power load 
shall be calculated and the supply cable and main switch shall be terminated in 
each mammography room separately for each machine.
If a digital type of machine is planned, then a separate small control room, 
adjoining the mammography room shall be provided. Between the two rooms, a lead 
glass shall be fxed in a wooden frame with a 2 mm lead lining.
Proper ground earthing provision shall be provided in the room.
For lighting in the mammography room, provide normal LED, with the suffcient 
lumen. Extra illumination in the room shall be avoided.
The temperature inside the mammography room shall range between 18 and 
21 °C. The humidity level shall be less than 60%.
To hang the lead aprons, a stand with heavy-duty hangers shall be provided out￾side each room of the mammography room.
To safely keep other radiation safety devices like lead goggles, lead collars, lead 
gloves, groin guards, etc., a cabinet shall be provided in each mammography room.
For mammography, generally, the upper body clothes have to be changed to a 
simple cotton gown. A change room shall be provided near the mammography room 
to enable the patient to remove outside clothes and change into a hospital dress. The 
size of the change room shall be approximately 3048 mm × 3048 mm. The change 
room shall have a provision of personal lockers to keep patient belongings. Also, 
hooks, hanger rods and hangers shall be provided to hang clothes. A cabinet to keep 
sterilised dresses shall also be provided.
CR system of the main radiology department can be used for mammography. Just 
the cassette needs to be carried from the mammography room to the radiology CR 
room. Other processes will remain the same.
MRI Fiber-Optic Pulse Oximeter: MRI pulse oximeter is designed in such a 
fashion that the magnetic felds do not affect the working of the pulse oximeter. This 
device is used to monitor a patient’s pulse and blood oxygen saturation during MRI 
scans. As MRI is a magnetic device, a normal pulse oximeter cannot be used inside 
the MRI room.
Nuclear Computed Tomography (PET-CT): Positron emission tomography–
computed tomography (PET-CT) is a combination of a positron emission tomogra￾phy (PET) scanner and computed tomography (CT) scanner in the same gantry of 
the machine. Both of these scanners capture sequential images in the same session, 
which when combined produces a single superimposed image. To perform the pro￾cedure, nuclear medicine is administered to the patient and the scan is performed.
15 Department Wise Equipment Detailing431
Requirements of Infrastructure for Installation, Commissioning and Testing 
of PET CT Machine:
PET CT Scan Machine Room: The infrastructure of the machine room shall be 
the same as a normal CT scan machine room. The only difference is that the wall 
shall be made out of 300 mm thick RCC.
The nuclear scan zone shall have two areas, i.e. the low-risk areas or cold areas 
and the high-risk areas or radiation exposure hot areas. Let us explain each of them.
Low-Risk Areas or Cold Areas.
Reception shall be located at the entrance of this low-risk zone, usually on the 
front side. The secretarial room, for administrative jobs like accounts, etc. can also

It is just like the sound refecting if loudly spoken in the hills creating an echo. A 
computer receives these refected waves and considering the time lag of receiving 
the waves from different tissues of the body, creates a picture.
15.23 Radiology434
Vascular Doppler: A Doppler ultrasound is a pencil-like thin ultrasound probe 
to send ultrasound waves at the précised small points and is used to estimate the 
blood fow through blood vessels by receiving back the bounced high-frequency 
sound waves by the red blood cells in the vessels.

Manpower Planning, Hospital Committees 
and Staff Policies
The organisation of the hospitals helps in delivering the optimal and the best service 
to the patients and thus fulfls the aims of the institution. To achieve this objective, 
control and coordination of hospital service are essential. In turn, better control and 
coordination will depend on a suitable organisational structure and adequate super￾vision. Activities to be performed and personnel needed shall be grouped in such a 
way as to achieve smooth functioning. An organisation chart is a working tool for 
the orderly arrangement of work and people. Through its design, it shall indicate the 
grouping of persons concerning one another and bring out the lines of authority. The 
chart shall ft the individual hospital. While human elements shall be taken into 
consideration, adjustments on this basis shall not violate the basic principles under￾lying lines of authority.
The medical staff is the chief agency through which the hospital achieves its 
prime objective, which is the proper care of patients who are sick or injured. Here, 
the doctor is the decision-maker on the major part of treatment whether as an out￾patient or in-patient. Hence, the proper choice and retention of doctors are extremely 
important for the smooth and competent functioning of the hospital.
The management philosophy of the hospital administrator will determine the 
philosophy of personnel management in each department and the relationship 
among the department heads. In most hospitals, patient care is the main objective. 
There can be other objectives in the hospital, which depend upon the size and the 
scope of the hospital, e.g. the training programme, the education programme, com￾munity health and the research activities, etc.
Human endeavour in this twentieth century has become so complex that the 
administration of any activity offers problems unknown in the simple enterprises of 
an earlier civilisation. Any organisation can only provide effcient service with a 
combined effort of men and materials and efforts made to prevent negligence of any 
duty or duplication of work, and thus to produce the required results. All this can be 
effciently achieved with the help of the predefned and designed ORGANISATIONAL 470
CHART, where all the duties and responsibilities of the individual are predefned 
and elaborated.
The Governing Body shall release that the medical staff of the hospital must be 
appointed with utmost care and only capable staff to be appointed so that the maxi￾mum care can be provided to the sick patient.
While preparing the organisational chart, it shall be made clear that all the duties 
are defned and there shall be no overlapping of duties, i.e. every individual shall 
have a predefned set of duties. Waste of effort and extravagance in the use of men 
and materials prevent the economy. In the organisational chart, the authority shall be 
centralised, responsibilities fxed and duties and interrelationships clearly defned.
First of all, department-wise and category-wise staff requirements shall be 
worked out based on factors like the number of beds; clinical departments; services 
provided; the number of patients; duty hours and availability of staff.
As a guide in selecting the medical staff and as a safeguard for preventing the 
appointment of those who are not desirable, certain minimum qualifcations shall be 
adopted and rigidly enforced.
The working of present days of most organisations is through committees. If car￾ried out properly, it can be of great help. It brings out the combined wisdom of 
knowledge of the people who discuss matters concerning the organisation. The 
committee views the problem from various angles, and fnally, a consensus emerges 
which is, hopefully, the best alternative. The committees elected from the staff 
appointed by the Governing Body may perform much of the work of the hospital. 
These committees are, normally, of two types (a) standing committees and (b) spe￾cial committees.
A good hospital runs just like a well-lubricated machine. Excellent and safe 
patient care can be achieved if all the pieces and processes work together. This result 
can only be achieved if the hospital has all of those systems, manpower and pro￾cesses in place. Staff members shall be made very clear as to what they have to do 
and what is expected from them. It is equally important that the staff shall be given 
an effective set of rules, regulations and procedures which shall guide them in their 
day-to-day tasks. In a hospital where the staff diverts from the defned, rules, regula￾tions, procedures and standards, it can be detrimental to the hospital. Inconsistency 
can deteriorate the quality of patient care and could be detrimental to the patient and 
can spoil the reputation of the hospital.
This is the reason why the set of rules, regulations, systems, policies and proce￾dures are important for hospitals. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a good 
and time-tested set of rules, regulation, systems, policies and procedures, to ease the 
staff to function effectively and effciently and ensures the safety of the patients 
and staff.
Hospital policies and procedures guide day-to-day operations and make sure that 
everything is running as it was expected. The policies and procedures defne the 
expectations and standards of staff, set guidelines for operations and improvements, 
and streamline processes.
To summarise, we can say that the main purpose of having these policies and 
procedures is to establish a high degree of understanding, effciency, cooperation 
16 Manpower Planning, Hospital Committees and Staff Policies471
and unity among the employees of the hospital. It also helps to provide uniform 
policies for all employees of the hospital, so that there are no discrepancies.
The enclosed checklist shall help the planner and designer to work out the staff 
requirement, appointment, form committees and framing of staff policies.
16.1 Staff Requirement
16.1.1 Administration
See Table 16.1.
Governing Body: For any hospital, the head is the Governing Body, by what￾ever name it may be called, either the ‘Board of Trustees’ or the ‘Board of Directors,’ 
etc. The duties of the Governing Body are to see that the services to be provided to 
the sick are effcient and at the lowest cost.
For fulflling these objectives of the hospital, the Governing Body appoints the 
executives and delegates all the powers to them, to achieve the objective of the hos￾pital. Such a person may be called the Administrator, the Medical Director or 
anything else, depending upon the need of the individual hospital. Practically, it is 
this person who will be responsible to the Governing Body and for fulflling his/her 
duties. Therefore, he/she may have the persons below his/her line reporting to 
him/her.

16.1 Staff Requirement472
In a hospital, there are two divisions, one dealing with patient care and the other 
with business management. These two divisions are again subdivided into different 
departments.
The Governing Body is the supreme authority in the hospital, and its selection 
shall be made from the representatives of the community to which it serves. While 
selecting, it shall be ensured that the members do justice with their position and give 
an uplift to the functioning.
Because the Governing Body has this duty and responsibility, it shall have the 
power to control. This power to control is derived from the charter of articles of 
incorporation of the hospital, its bylaws and its rules and regulations.
Size and the members of the Governing Body: The Governing Body shall ide￾ally consist of 8–15 members from the different sections of the society. All the 
members of the Governing Body shall either be the learned professional, the busi￾nessman, the representative of the labour or the infuential class of the society. The 
members of the Governing Body shall be such that the hospital can have the advan￾tage from their natural talents, special training, experience, etc.
The Governing Body is expected to take a genuine interest in the hospital's work; 
devote a great deal of time to the hospital’s affairs; shall think of the hospital plans 
and for its uplift; shall be regular in attending the meetings; shall actively discuss 
the new policies being formulated and shall review the working results of the hospi￾tal and give his comments on the same.
As the members of the Governing Body are not full-time employees, they need 
assistance in fulflling their objectives. For this, they appoint the Director.
Offcers of the Governing Body: Governing Body shall consist of
Chairman: The Chairman or President who shall be the head of the Governing 
Body and shall preside over the meeting of the Governing Body.
Vice Chairman: He shall be below the Chairman and acts as a Chairman in the 
absence of the latter.
Secretary: The Secretary keeps the record of the meetings, arranges for the 
meetings and presents the reports along with other facts and fgures.
Treasurer: The treasurer shall be for keeping the records of the funds, receipts 
and disbursements.
For effcient day-to-day working of the hospital, Governing Body shall appoint 
the following offcials:
CEO/Managing Director: The CEO/Managing Director shall be a person 
responsible for the overall management of the day-to-day affairs of the hospital. As 
the CEO/Managing Director cannot be available all the time and it is diffcult for 
handling all the jobs by himself/herself, he/she requires assistance for which he/she 
shall appoint the Medical Superintendent/Medical Director to look after the 
affairs of the medical administration and the medical care and the Administrator/
Director Administration for looking after the non-medical administrator or the 
business management.
Medical Superintendent/Medical Director: In a hospital, the overall in-charge 
of Professional/Medical care shall be the Medical Superintendent/Medical Director. 
For all the departments under the control of the Medical Superintendent/Medical 
16 Manpower Planning, Hospital Committees and Staff Policies473
Director, he/she shall be responsible, but depending on the size of the hospital and 
the workload, he/she may have one or more Deputy Medical Superintendent/Dy. 
Medical Director. Generally, the Medical Superintendent/Medical Director along 
with the help of the Deputy Medical Superintendent/Dy. Medical Director shall be 
directly responsible to manage and control the department like Medical Care of 
Indoor and OPD Patients, Radiology, Laboratory, Emergency Department, Medical 
Items Purchases, Medical Stores, Pharmacy, Nursing Care, Supporting Departments 
like Dietary services, Library and Social Service, etc.
Administrator/Director Administration: The Administrator/Director 
Administration in a hospital shall be responsible for Business Management and 
Non-Medical Administration. For all the departments under the control of the 
Administrator/Director Administration, he/she shall be responsible, but depending 
on the size of the hospital and the workload, he/she may have one or more Asst. 
Administrator/Deputy Director Administration. Administrator/Director 
Administration with the help of Asst. Administrator/Dy. Director Administration 
shall be responsible to manage and control the departments like Information 
Technology, Reception and Information, Accounts & Finance, Repair & 
Maintenance, House Keeping, Linen Supply Department, Non-Medical Purchases, 
Non-Medical Stores, Admission & Discharge, Transport, Medical Records, Security, 
Personnel department, Public relations, Volunteer department, etc.
16.1.2 Medical Care
See Table 16.2.
For effcient and effective medical care in the hospital, the medical staff shall be 
the chief agency through which the hospital achieves its prime objectives. The med￾ical staff consists of Physicians or so-called Doctors. They are the persons who 
decide on the major part of treatment whether as an out-patient or in-patient. It is the 
doctor who decides whether a patient is to be admitted or not, what investigations 
and treatments are to be carried out and when the patient is to be discharged.
Hence, the proper choice and retention of doctors are extremely important for the 
smooth and competent functioning of the hospital. For the achievement of the objec￾tives, the medical staff of the hospital must be appointed with utmost care and only 
capable staff to be appointed so that the maximum care can be provided to the sick 
patient.
This department shall be under the direct control of the Medical Superintendent/
Medical Director. Below the line shall be the Heads of the Departments, the 
Medical Offcers, the House Surgeons, the Senior Residents and the Interns.
The Heads of the Departments shall be generally the Specialists of various 
departments, or the Super Specialists, Pathologist, Biochemist, Microbiologist, 
Histopathologist, Radiologist and Anaesthetist.
The departments of the Laboratory, the Radiology and the Operation Theatre 
shall be assisted by the Technicians. Apart from this, there can be a few

Qualifcation of the Medical Staff: As a guide in selecting the medical staff and 
as a safeguard for preventing the appointment of those who are not desirable, certain 
minimum qualifcations shall be adopted and rigidly enforced. For appointing the 
doctor to the medical staff of a reputed, ethical hospital, a doctor shall be a graduate 
of a recognised medical college with a degree in Medicine or Surgery; shall be a 
post-graduate degree in his speciality and/or also Doctorate Graduation like DM, 
MCh in his/her super speciality; legally licensed to practise medicine or surgery in 
the country where the hospital is situated; enjoy the reputation of being an ethical 
and conscientious doctor; participate in the activities of organised medicine as dem￾onstrated by his/her membership in local, state and national medical societies; have 
served an internship of at least 1 year; and temperament and disposition to work in 
harmony with his/her colleagues, professional, technical and other personnel in the 
hospital; to create an effective understanding with the administration of the hospital.
16 Manpower Planning, Hospital Committees and Staff Policies475
Appointment of the Medical Staff: Since the Governing Body representing the 
ownership of the hospital has both a legal and moral responsibility to protect from 
foreseeable and preventable harm to all those who come to the hospital for treatment 
and to maintain the highest quality of medical care, the Governing Body shall select 
the medical staff carefully, to protect both patients and the hospital and to absolve 
the hospital from liability.
Since the Governing Board personally may not be qualifed to judge the compe￾tence of medical staff, it shall seek advice from expert medical professionals in this 
feld. To assure the character and standing of individual doctors, they shall take the 
reference from his/her previous employers, etc. before appointing the medical staff. 
For appointing the medical staff, the Governing Body shall formulate an advisory 
committee consisting of doctors, in whom the Governing Body has confdence.
Appointment Procedure: The procedures for the appointment of the doctors 
may vary depending on whether the hospital is government or private. In the Govt. 
hospital, whether central, state or local hospital, the selection is by the Public 
Services Commissions and other similar recruiting bodies. These selections are 
based on the results of tests and interviews. In other hospitals, the position is differ￾ent where the Governing Body appoints the doctors with the help of the Medical 
Superintendent/Medical Director/medical professionals.
Every doctor desirous of joining the hospital for professional care of the patients 
shall make an application in writing. This application shall usually be presented to 
the Medical Superintendent/Medical Director. The application of doctor shall con￾tain details as to (a) identifcation of the applicant, (b) his/her professional educa￾tion, including premedical and medical education and postgraduate education, (c) 
his/her experience in the internship, residencies, fellowship, assistantships, etc., (d) 
his/her professional experience, (e) references, (f) his/her papers presented, (g) his/
her special achievement in the feld of medicine or surgery, (h) his/her ability in 
research as evidenced by contributions to medical literature, (i) previous experience 
in specialities with the names of the preceptors and (j) applicants agree to abide by 
the rules and regulations of the hospital, etc.
This application shall be reviewed by the Credentials Committee. The Credentials 
Committee shall go through the application in detail and if needed, shall call the 
concerned applicant for an interview. The committee shall make its recommenda￾tions to the Governing Body for acceptance or rejection of the application.
Once the report of the Credential Committee is received, Governing Body shall 
discuss other terms and conditions like remuneration and perks, etc. and appoint the 
doctor to the team of medical staff.
16.1.2.1 Types of Medical Staff
Consultant doctors: The consultant medical staff consists of the specialists and the 
super specialists, in different disciplines of the medical feld, who are appointed as 
such because they can show evidence of qualifcations or experience as specialists. 
These doctors shall be recruited either on a fxed basis (Closed System of payment) 
16.1 Staff Requirement476
or sharing basis (Open system of payment) or otherwise on a salary plus incentive 
system. They shall attend OPD and operation theatre as and when required. They 
shall also be responsible for the morning and evening rounds of a patient admitted 
under his/her care in the hospital for treatment.
Honorary doctors: The honorary doctors consist of those doctors who have 
been active in the work of the hospital but who are now retired and those whom the 
hospital wishes to honour because of outstanding reputation or for some other rea￾son even though they may not be connected with the hospital. Doctors of this type 
have no active duties in the hospital, nor they can hold offce. They shall, however, 
be encouraged to attend conferences of the medical staff and have the privilege of 
participating in discussions. These types of doctors are appointed on a salary basis 
but on comparatively very low emoluments.
Visiting doctors: The visiting medical staff consists of the doctors who wish to 
attend to the patients in the hospital but do not desire to become a member of the 
active medical staff of the hospital. If the Governing Body feels that the income 
from a particular speciality or super-speciality will be less and the emoluments of 
the doctors of that speciality or super-speciality cannot be recovered, the doctors in 
those departments can be appointed on a visiting basis. These types of doctors shall 
conduct OPDs and are allowed to admit the patient and perform surgeries.
Courtesy doctors: The courtesy medical staff consists of the doctors who wish 
to avail the services of the hospital and is desirous of admitting, operating and treat￾ing his/her private patient. These types of doctors are appointed purely on sharing 
basis, and no fxed liability of salary is undertaken by the hospital. These doctors are 
generally not allowed to conduct OPD in the hospital and mainly bring their patients 
to the hospital.
Associate doctors: The associate doctors are junior or less experienced doctors 
and other doctors who have not been actively interested in the hospital but who wish 
eventually to become an active doctor as and when the vacancy arises. The members 
of this division are associated in a junior capacity with the members of active staff 
and perform such duties as may be assigned to them. These doctors mainly carry out 
the treatment of a patient under a consultant. They normally work under the control 
and guidance of the consultant or the senior doctor. This division of the medical 
staff is not necessary for the smaller hospitals. Under this category, there are two 
types of doctors: (1) Resident Doctors also called Senior Residents and (2) Junior 
Residents or General Duty Doctors
Senior resident doctors: These are the Resident Medical doctors with a post￾graduate degree like M.D. or M.S. and are called Senior Residents. These doctors 
shall be normally appointed on salary and shall be the full-time worker of the hos￾pital. These doctors shall normally not be allowed to practise outside the hospital. 
These doctors shall assist and help the consultant. They shall normally help the 
consultant in conducting the OPD and shall be on duty to attend the call from OPD, 
ward and Emergency department. They also shall assist the consultant in taking 
rounds in the wards and shall be responsible for the preparation of the discharge 
card of the patient at the time of discharge.
16 Manpower Planning, Hospital Committees and Staff Policies477
Junior resident doctors/general duty doctors: These shall be normally gradu￾ate doctors who are not postgraduate and shall be appointed in the hospital on a 
salary, i.e. full-time basis. They shall not be allowed to practise outside. These doc￾tors shall be on rotational duty and shall be present around the clock to attend to the 
complaints of the patient. They shall also be responsible for helping the consultants 
to take the rounds of wards. These doctors shall generally be posted in the intensive 
care wards like the ICU, ICCU, NICU, Emergency department or even on the 
foors, etc.
16.1.2.2 Remuneration Types of Medical Staff:
The Governing Body of the hospital shall be clear about the terms and conditions on 
which the doctors are to be appointed. There can be two systems of appointment, 
that can be CLOSED Type and OPEN Type.
Under the ‘OPEN’ type of the system, the attending doctor is appointed on a 
sharing basis, i.e. the doctor is paid remuneration in the shape of a particular per￾centage as a share of the doctor out of the total consultation fee collection of that 
doctor. Normally in a good hospital, the senior doctors and the superspecialist are 
appointed on this system as the expectations of these doctors are normally high and 
always may be diffcult for the hospital to afford them on a fxed salary basis.
Under the ‘CLOSED,’ the medical staff is appointed on the salary and they get 
the fxed remuneration in the shape of the salary. Under this system, the employee 
doctors are not allowed to practise outside the hospital.
Considering the pros and cons of both systems, nowadays hospitals prefer to 
appoint doctors adopting both systems, i.e. Open and Closed systems. It means that

As hospitals are now a days facing lots of challenges, and opportunities to brand 
themselves effectively and effciently. There have been major increases in the 
amount of consumer choice available on the market, and suddenly brands have to 
appeal to customers in ways that they have not had before. Branding is the path that 
establishes an image of the hospital in the eyes of the public and the patients.

views and requirements of the patients. Hospital branding is a promise as to what 
customer expects and how the hospitals fulfl the needs of the patients.

population aware of the services provided in the hospital, the quality of the services, 
the equipment and instruments in the hospital, the panel of experts in the hospital 
and the value addition by the hospital as compared to the other hospital in the vicin￾ity. This creates a high level of patient satisfaction levels so that the patient returns 
to the hospital again and again and recommends others to avail of the services of the 
hospital. Outreach to the population is essential and can be achieved through vari￾ous modes of advertisements, camps, seminars and conferences, etc.
A good marketing team can beneft the hospital by creating a stronger base of 
patients availing the services of the hospital; increasing local physician referrals; 
promoting important medical services and promoting health awareness in the 
population.

will adversely affect various functions of the hospital. As the purchase function 
involves a huge amount of funds, ineffcient management of the procurement 
and consumption can signifcantly reduce a lot of fnancial burden on the 
hospital.
The purchase department is responsible for the formation of the purchase 
committee; documenting the purchase policy; assessment of the requirement; 
vendor/supplier evaluation mechanism; fnalising the purchase requirement; 
processing the purchase order; negotiating the prices and purchase contracts; 
receiving the goods; processing the bills of the vendors and payment to the ven￾dors. The primary goal of the purchasing department is to obtain materials at the 
lowest possible price, procure the best quality material and ensure continuity 
of supply.
At the top of the purchasing department is a Purchase Manager who super￾vises the entire departmental staff and works closely with the hospital authori￾ties and workers of the hospital to plan and oversee the budget. The purchasing 
manager has to maintain close communications with departmental heads and 
other workers of the hospital to better understand their needs and consumption 
pattern. For the purchase of medical items, the purchase manager has to coordi￾nate with the Medical Superintendent/Medical Director, whereas for other pur￾chases, he/she needs to coordinate with the Administrator/Director of Hospital 
Administration.
Purchase Offcers and Purchasers work under the supervision of the purchase 
manager. Below the line are the General Duty Clerks, who assist the higher off￾cers in the purchasing department.

of the item. This situation would be a costly proposition to any hospital. Therefore, 
planning for the procurement of items and assets has to be well calculated and 
well on time. The department has to plan in advance as to what and how many of 
various items are to be kept in stock at a given time. The department even has to 
work out various levels of stock like minimum quantity, maximum quantity, re￾ordering quantity, etc.
The responsibilities of the Store is to maintain the adequate inventory of materi￾als; good information system regarding the items; right time for procurement; right 
quantity of purchase; low procurement and storage cost; consistency in the quality 
of the product; continuity in the supply of stores; forecasting requirement; aware￾ness of new materials and products; raise indent of material required; prepare GRN 
of materials received in stores; arrange check for quality of material from respective 
department of the hospital; receive the invoice/bill from the supplier; check the 
invoice with purchase order and the materials for the quantity, appropriateness of 
brand and batch number; checking the date of expiry; accepting goods and marking 
the receipt with seal with date and sign; return of rejected materials; moving the 
material to the appropriate place/rack in the store; issue of the indented material;

Types of Hospital Stores: Generally, the hospital maintains different types of 
stores like non-consumable stores; consumable stores; general stores; medical and 
drug stores; surgical stores; linen stores; dietary stores; stationery stores; engineer￾ing and maintenance stores, etc. It is not always necessary to provide all the stores 
in the hospital. However, depending on the size of the hospital, the management has 
to decide how many types of stores are to be provided.
The Stores Manager supervises all the different types of stores in the hospital. 
The Stores Manager has to work in close association with the organisation execu￾tives to plan and oversee the store's requirements. The Stores Manager has to main￾tain close communications with departmental heads and other users of the hospital, 
to better understand their needs and requirements of the items. For the medical 
items, the store manager has to coordinate with the Medical Superintendent/Medical 
Director, whereas for other items, he/she needs to coordinate with the Administrator/
Director Hospital Administration.

16.1.17 Linen Supply Department
See Table 16.17.
The laundry service of the hospital is responsible for providing an adequate, 
clean, sterilised and constant supply of linen to all users of the hospital. The basic 
tasks of the linen supply department are to ensure proper sorting, mending, wash￾ing, extracting, drying, ironing, folding and delivery of the linen. The main purpose 
of this department is to provide clean linen to the patients when required and ensure 
that hygienic conditions are maintained in the process.
The linen services in the hospital can be in-house or outsourced. A wide variety 
of linen is washed in the laundry like patient’s linen, curtains, kitchen linen, staff 
uniforms, doctors' dresses, OT linen and drapes, blankets, etc.
The hospital has got three options for a laundry set-up. First is that the hospital 
purchases the laundry equipment and hires workers and the laundry is operated by 
the hospital. The second option is that the hospital provides the spaces for laundry 
and the contractor is hired for setting up the equipment and operation of the laundry. 
Third is that the hospital enters into a contract with the laundry service providers 
who have an off-site laundry setup at some other place except the hospital premises. 
Under this option, the contractors carry the linen to its place and bring it back the 
linen to the hospital after washing and processing.
This department shall be headed by the Linen Manager who shall be in turn 
assisted by the laundry staff like Washerman, Ironing Persons, Tailors (for mend￾ing) and the General Duty Clerks.

16.1.19 Security
See Table 16.19.
Security service in a hospital is responsible for ensuring the security and safety 
of the hospital premises, assets, and other materials in the hospital. The department 
is also responsible for the security and safety of the hospital staff, personnel, 
patients, visitors and the public as well as regulating the traffc within the hospital 
premises. For the smooth functioning of the hospital, the security services of the 
hospital are also responsible to prevent and handle any disturbance or breach in 
security.
Therefore, the hospitals need to have a separate and specialised department of 
security service, entrusted with the responsibility to keep watch over the entire hos￾pital and to prevent anything untoward incident. However, nowadays, it is a trend to 
outsource the security service to an outside professional security agency.
The Security service shall be headed by a Security Offcer, who shall be fully 
trained in security procedures and techniques. Below the Security Offcer are the 
Security Supervisors and Guards, who shall be well-trained, tough and mature 
persons. The security team shall also include some female staff to check/frisk or 
otherwise handle the female staff/visitors.
In case, the hospital has a fre detection and frefghting system in place, it shall 
be headed by the Fire Offcer and assisted by the Fireman.
For operations of the lifts and elevators, the Lift Operators are deployed. These 
lift operators report to the Security Offcers if the operations of the lifts and eleva￾tors are under the security department or to the maintenance engineer.

16.1.20 Electricity
See Table 16.20.
In any hospital, it is very important to have a separate electricity department as 
the requirement of power for operating the equipment, operating air-conditioning 
plants, providing power for light and fans, providing general use electrical outlets, 
etc. is huge and the department has to ensure that a good quality of uninterrupted 
electricity supply is available round the clock. The second important factor is the 
immediate attention and removal of the electrical faults by the electrical mainte￾nance team.
The Electricity Department shall be headed by an experienced Electrical 
In-charge, who shall be a qualifed electrical engineer. Below the Electrical 
In-charge are the Electrical Supervisors. Down the line are the Electricians and 
the Line Mans.
For running and maintenance of the captative generation plants, the Generator 
Operators are deployed.
16.1.21 Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
See Table 16.21.
HVAC systems play an important role in hospitals by providing comfortable 
climatic conditions for patients and staff of the hospital and also providing a germ￾free, clean and hygienic environment to prevent the spreading of diseases. Further, 
the medical equipment in the hospital is very sensitive, its performance may be 
affected due to the uncontrolled temperature and humidity levels. Therefore, perfect 
air control in terms of temperature and humidity is essential to make the equipment 
work accurately.

Additionally, different rooms in the hospital have different uses, which further 
adds to the complexity of designing the HVAC systems. In a hospital, patient rooms 
are provided, where patients suffering from various diseases are admitted and 
treated. Out of all, some may be exposed to infectious-contagious diseases and may 
require the facility of isolation. Some of the patient rooms shall be required for 
patients who may be depressed or have weak immune systems. There are certain 
areas in the hospital, such as ICUs, neonatal units, etc., where it is necessary to 
restrict the arrival or growth of pathogens that may be present in the hospital. 
Hospitals are places where the concentration of micro-organisms and pathogens 
accumulation is very high as compared to any other commercial building.
Therefore, the hospital shall have its HVAC department operate and maintain the 
HVAC system.
The HVAC department shall be headed by an experienced HVAC In-charge, 
who shall be a qualifed HVAC engineer. Below the HVAC In-charge shall be the 
Senior and Junior AC Mechanics.
For running and maintenance of the HVAC plants, the Plant Operators are 
deployed.
16.1 Staff Requirement498
16.1.22 Water Supply and Drainage
See Table 16.22.
Though the supply of water and proper drainage system is necessary for the sur￾vival of human beings, still in the case of hospitals, where there is a question of 
treating the sick and critical patients, the water supply and drainage system have to 
be excellent. More importantly, in hospitals, clean hygienic, good quality of water 
and drainage is necessary. The quality of water supplied and the drainage system 
impact a lot on issues like infection control, the life of the medical equipment, staff 
and patients' hygiene, etc.
In hospitals, lot, many services like dialysis, etc. are fully or partially dependent 
upon clean and treated water supply. Also, the performance, accuracy and effciency 
of some of the medical equipment depend on the quality of water being supplied to 
the said medical equipment. Similarly, the drainage and treatment of wastewater are 
equally important.
The reliability of the water supply system is another important factor in the case 
of hospitals. Therefore, it has to be ensured that the system placed shall be such that 
it can ensure an uninterrupted water supply at all times in the hospital building. 
Also, it has to be ensured that the volume of the water shall not more than the 
requirement and that the stagnation of water in the tanks is avoided.
Therefore, the hospital shall have its own Water Supply and Drainage department 
to operate and maintain the water supply and drainage systems.
The Water Supply and Drainage department shall be headed by an experienced 
Sanitary and Water In-charge, who shall have suffcient experience in handling 
the systems. Below him/her shall be the Plumbers.
For running and maintenance of the water supply plant, the Pump Operators are 
deployed.

Medical gases are one of the main support services used in hospitals. Commonly 
used medical gases in hospitals are:
Oxygen (O2): Three sources are used for oxygen supply; liquifed oxygen tank 
also called Vacuum-Insulated Evaporator (VIE), Gas Cylinders and Oxygen 
Concentrator (PSA) system.
Nitrous oxide (N2o): Nitrous oxide is a medical gas administrated via an anaes￾thesia machine. Usually, a manifold supply system is the source of nitrous oxide gas.
Compressed Medical air 4 bar: In general, medical air 4 is used for respiratory 
applications. The source of supply can be a centralised medical compressor plant.
Compressed Medical air 7 bar: Medical air 7 is known as surgical air because it 
is used mainly to derive surgical equipment like drills, tourniquets, bone saws, etc. 
The supply source is similar to medical air is through a compressor plant.
Carbone dioxide (CO2): Carbone dioxide is a medical gas used for insuffations 
purpose in laparoscopy procedures. Usually, portable cylinders are the source of CO2.
Nitrogen (N2): Nitrogen for surgical power tools is likely to be used only on the 
sites where there is availability for the production of synthetic air.
Medical vacuum: Medical vacuum is provided through a vacuum central plant. 
In fact, it is not a gas; it is a negative pressure used for suctioning patients and anaes￾thetic gas scavenging system. Vacuum pipes are known for their yellow colour.
As the MGPS is one of the most important support services, the hospital shall 
have its own MGPS department to operate and maintain the gas supply system.
The MGPS Department shall be headed by a well-qualifed and experienced 
MGPS In-charge, who shall be a qualifed MGPS engineer. Below him/her shall be 
the MGPS Mechanics to maintain the MGPS system.
For running and maintenance of the liquid oxygen plant, manifold system and 
pump room, the Plant Room/Pump Operators are deployed.

repair and maintenance can either be carried out in-house or outsourced to any 
maintenance agency.
The disadvantage of outsourcing is, frstly the elevated repair and maintenance 
cost and secondly the times lag to repair and maintain the asset.
However, it is recommended that the repair and maintenance facilities in the 
hospital shall be developed in-house.
For building maintenance, the hospital requires personnel for repair and mainte￾nance of frefghting, building including, civil repairs, plumbing, electrical, paint￾ing, steel works, wooden works, aluminium works, landscape works, automobiles, etc.
To carry out the above repair and maintenance works, workshops are required. 
Depending on the load of the work or frequency of repair and maintenance, the 
workshops are designed and planned. There are some which shall necessarily be 
provided, but others can be clubbed with other workshops if a load of a single work￾shop is not enough. However, the total workshops required are Biomedical 
Workshop; MGPS Workshop; Electrical Workshop; Low voltage Workshop; HVAC 
Workshop; Mechanical Workshop; Building Maintenance; Fire Fighting Workshop 
Automobile Workshop, etc.
Out of all these most of the workshops are being managed by the concerned 
departmental heads.
As far as Building Maintenance is concerned, the department shall be headed by 
the Chief Engineer, who shall be a well-qualifed Civil Engineer with suffcient 
experience. He/she is assisted by the Maintenance Supervisors or the Site 
Engineers. These Maintenance supervisors or the Site Engineers shall get the work 
done from the Masons, Helpers, Carpenters, Welders, Gardner, Painters, etc.

This workshop is intended to be utilised for repair and maintenance of the bio￾medical equipment in the hospital like Ventilators, X-Ray, Defbrillator, Vital 
Monitor, Ultrasound, Lab instruments and other medical equipment used in the 
hospital.
In-house repair and maintenance of medical equipment is always the preferred 
choice of the management because the repairs can be quick and less costly as com￾pared to outside agency repairs. Only if there is any major fault, it shall be got 
repaired by the original manufacturer of the machine.
Therefore, the hospital shall have its own Biomedical Workshop.
The Biomedical workshop shall be headed by a well-qualifed and experienced 
Chief Biomedical Engineer who in turn shall be assisted by the Biomedical 
Engineer.

16.2 Procedure for Staff Appointment
See Table 16.29.
Now the procedural aspects of the manpower assessment and deployment
The frst step shall be the formation of the Governing Body. Once the Governing 
Body is in place, the actual work on building up the hospital project starts.
Next shall be the appointment of the Advisory Body. At the planning and design￾ing stage, the role of the advisory body is very crucial. It is the Governing Body and 
the advisory body who can jointly decide on the initial planning like, formation of 
the company/society, type of hospital needed, services to be provided in the hospi￾tal, DRP and feasibility report evaluation, arranging fnances, site selection, site 
development, building area calculation, applying for initial approvals, approving the 
concept drawings and the layout drawings, calculating electricity load requirement, 
approval of all the other drawings as given by the architects and consultants, etc.
The next step shall be to identify the team of offce bearers and engagement of 
the consultants and the hiring of the required engineers.
Thereafter, the construction works can be started. Once the civil works of the 
building are complete and fnishing works start, this is the stage where the Medical 
Superintendent and the Nursing Superintendent shall be appointed and deployed 
because these two people will play an important role in subsequent planning.
Now with the help of the Medical Superintendent and the Nursing Superintendent, 
and under the guidance of the Governing Body and Advisory body, the requirement 
of the staff shall be worked out. The recruitment and other staff policies shall be 
fnalised.
Now is the stage to appoint and deploy the Human Resource Manager and pre￾pare the schedule of Duties and Responsibilities of the staff members.
Once the requirement and the policies are fnalised, the advertisement for the 
requirement of staff shall be released. Please remember that the advertisement shall 
be released about 4 months before the completion and operational date of the hos￾pital services.

carried out properly, it can be of great help. It brings out the combined wisdom of 
knowledge of the people who discuss matters concerning the organisation. The 
committee views the problem from various angles and fnally, a consensus emerges 
which is, hopefully, the best alternative. The committees elected from the staff 
appointed by the Governing Body may perform much of the work of the hospital. 
These committees are, normally, of two types
Standing committees: The standing committees are those elected or appointed 
for the full year and having assigned duties and responsibilities, with possibly some 
degree of authority to act. The usual standing committees are:

16.4 Human Resource Policies
See Table 16.31.
To enhance coordination and collaboration and to enrich organisational culture, 
it is extremely important to stress legal and ethical issues of the employees, provide 
safety to the employees, place welfare and motivation schemes for employees and 
enhance the support activities. A healthcare sector is a place wherein there are 
patients and employees with a huge diversity of cultural backgrounds. Therefore, 
the Human Resources department needs to pay closer attention to the issues of 
recruitment, disputes, discipline, termination, leaves, overtime, etc. as these are the 
major factors that the day-to-day functioning of the hospital depends on.
To ensure the success of the systems, the Human Resources department must 
frame the set of policies which shall govern the recruitment and working of the 
employees in the hospital. There is a wide range of policies which needs to be 
worked out such as recruitment, Attendance, Leaves, employees’ benefts, travelling 
and conveyance, discipline, termination and suspension, overtime, performance 
evaluation, promotion, salary increment, reimbursement, security and safety, train￾ing and development, and workers compensation.
The set of policies as mentioned above in the table shall be prepared well in 
advance, and the employees shall be made aware of all such policies either at the 
time of recruitment or later.

Chapter 17
Policies and Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP)
To provide quality care to the patients, the hospital must run like a well-oiled 
machine. Right from admission onwards, all the pieces, activities, and processes 
must work together to provide consistent and excellent care. All these activities and 
processes include the patient’s assessment, treatment, investigation, nursing care, 
interventions, discharge, billing, etc.
This motive can only be achieved if the hospital has a well-defned set of policies 
and procedures in place. Staff members must know what is expected from them and 
be provided with a defned and detailed set of rules, regulations, responsibilities, 
and procedures to guide them in their day-to-day tasks.
In a hospital, deviating from the rules and standards can be detrimental to the 
hospital or the patient. Inconsistent practices will lower the quality of patient care 
and could even harm the patient and put the hospital at risk.
Hence considering the importance, the hospitals shall have good policies and 
procedures to function effectively and effciently and keep both employees and 
patients safe.
Still further considering the laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines as issued or 
prescribed by various government bodies or the accreditation agencies of the respec￾tive country, the policies and standard operating procedures shall be prepared and 
made applicable in the hospital.
Hospital policies and procedures regulate day-to-day operations and ensure that 
everything runs smoothly. They convey expectations and standards to employees, 
provide operational and improvement guidelines, and streamline procedures.
Hospital policies and procedures serve to hold personnel accountable for taking 
the proper steps when caring for patients. They standardize practises throughout the 
organization to guarantee that all patients receive the same level of care which also 
helps to keep patients safe.
Policies and procedures for disinfection, charting, and medication contribute to 
the prevention of common errors and infections. These standards prevent doctors 512
and nurses from having to guess what steps to take or how to perform a surgery. This 
results in fewer errors.
A hospital employee may interact with dozens of patients and other staff mem￾bers every day. Policies and procedures for hospitals improve and streamline inter￾nal communication.
The standard operating procedure (SOP) is developed for the hospitals based on 
the Health Care Standards involved over some time by the experts. SOPs refect the 
difference in opportunities, capacity, and vulnerability of the healthcare staff at dif￾ferent levels of the healthcare system. The purpose of the standard operating proce￾dures is to provide a clear and detailed description of step-by-step routine actions of 
the service providers providing services in the facilities.
Apart from SOPs, a few other essential activities need to be addressed. These are 
like designing and developing the formats of the hospital stationery, registers, 
records, operational policies, roles and responsibilities, templates, logbooks, rules 
and regulations, etc.
Once all these above SOPs and documents are in place, the quality of patient care 
will substantially improve.
This set of checklists shall help the planner and designer to remember all such 
activities and frame the desired hospital policies, SOPs, formats of the hospital sta￾tionery, registers, records, operational policies, roles and responsibilities, templates, 
logbooks, and rules and regulations well in time.
17.1 Policies
17.1.1 Hospital Policies
Joint Commission International (JCI) and National Accreditation Board of Hospitals 
(NABH) accreditation in India have established guidelines so that hospitals may 
attempt to develop a baseline that will help them provide better healthcare services. 
It will allow healthcare providers to benchmark their services against the fnest pro￾viders, allowing hospitals to remain competitive.
The JCI accreditation maintenance programme assures staff satisfaction as their 
opportunities for development and leadership expand, and they have the opportunity 
to work in a great environment. The development team will be properly trained and 
will adhere to standard operating practises. Furthermore, accreditation ensures that 
the staff receives consistent support.
Here, we will be discussing about the JCI standards, as these standards are appli￾cable throughout the globe (Table 17.1)
For more details on the norms as prescribed and laid down by the JCI, please 
refer to the “Joint Commission International Accreditation Standards for Hospitals. 
Including Standards for Academic Medical Center Hospitals 7th Edition”

17.2.2 Emergency Department
See Table 17.3.
An emergency department (ED) is a department in the hospital to provide imme￾diate and urgent medical treatment facilities to the patient by persons specialized 
in emergency medicine. Hence, emergency department plays an important role in 
providing the public with access to urgent and acute healthcare facilities apart from 
extending support to primary healthcare and community services.
The emergency department is also addressed as Accident & Emergency 
Department (A&E), Emergency Room (ER), or Casualty Department, etc. in 
different countries of different hospitals.
The emergency department of the hospital is the window or can say door of the 
hospital from where the patients enter the hospital. Therefore, an emergency depart￾ment creates the frst impression on the patients, relatives, and friends who come 
along with the patient. If the patients in the emergency department are handled 
quickly and effciently in a friendly environment, it leads to a positive impact on the 
patients or their relatives and friends, who in turn can form their opinion about the 
care they will receive. The quicker and more effcient the care, the more the chances 
to save lives and also reduce the severity and duration of illness.
The patients landing in the emergency department are of varied types like major 
trauma patients, elderly patients, patients with physical and mental disabilities, 
patients with mental health issues, patients with infectious diseases or who are 
immunocompromised, children and adolescents, sexual assault patients, domestic 
violence, custodial patients, victims of child abuse, and patients affected by chemi￾cal, biological or radiological contaminants, etc.

The staff in the emergency department should be professional experts in their 
feld who can effectively manage the patients, provide immediate critical care, 
resuscitate the patient, relieve the patient from pain, and save the life of the patient. 
The assistance of the support departments like radiology and pathology etc. is also 
crucial for the emergency department to perform. Hence, the set-up of these sup￾porting departments should be excellent and shall maintain good communication 
with an emergency department. The emergency department needs to establish a 
close relationship with all these support departments as well as with the other 
departments and units of the hospital.
The objective of the emergency department is to provide effective and immediate 
treatment to the patients, provide frst aid to the patients, and save the life of the 
patient and relieve him/her of pain. Also, the department has to attend to 
17 Policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)531
medico-legal cases and coordinate with the local police for the same, screening 
patients for admission and providing care during non-OPD hours or on holidays.
While planning and designing any emergency department in the hospital, it has 
to be ensured that all the works are complete and operational. Similarly, all the ser￾vices shall be operational before the emergency department starts taking patients.
On the other side, the emergency departments of the hospitals shall be operative 
24 h a day for all weekdays. Hence, it becomes very easy for the patient with acute 
illness or accidents to land in this department without a prior appointment, but who 
requires immediate medical attention.
There are a few issues which need to be ensured before the emergency depart￾ment is in operation. Such issues are like the required infrastructure is provided; the 
layout of the department is perfect; required services are available; proper furniture 
and fxtures are in place; required electrical points and communication ports have 
been provided; public utilities have been provided; signage, wayfnding, and display 
mechanisms are in place; required instrument/equipment/gadgets are available; 
required facilities are available; patient/staff/visitors safety mechanisms are avail￾able; proper lighting is ensured; proper environmental control with heating and air￾conditioning is available; security devices and mechanisms are provided; 
announcement systems are in place; and wall, ceiling, and interior decoration are up 
to mark and appealing, etc.
17.2.3 Outpatient (OPD) Services
See Table 17.4.
The department in a hospital where ambulatory patients receive consultation 
from specialists or superspecialists is known as the outpatient department (OPD) 
unit, also known as the ambulatory care unit. The OPD treats patients who do not 
need to stay in the hospital overnight.
The primary goal of OPD is to avoid crowding in the indoor department and to 
provide follow-up care for indoor patients after discharge. This is a win–win situa￾tion for everyone involved, including the doctor, the patient, society, and the 
hospital.
The OPD services in the hospital support the patient by providing consultation 
with medical specialists and super specialists; physical examination and investiga￾tions; referring the patient for admission to a hospital for inpatient services; follow￾up consultation and ongoing case management, providing treatment on a day-care 
basis; pre-operative screening of the patient; performing minor procedures; refer￾ring the patients to other specialities or super-specialities for a second opinion or 
on-going care and treatment; providing health education and counselling of the 
patients and families; centre for providing the training and education to the stu￾dents; etc.
There are a few issues which need to be ensured before the hospital is opera￾tional. Such issues are like required infrastructure has been provided; the layout of

17.2.4 Inpatient Department (IPD) Services
See Table 17.5.
The signifcance and usefulness of the patient rooms are important issues and 
shall not be ignored in any hospital setup. It is a place where the patients are kept 
while undergoing the necessary treatment and recovering. This is one of the places 
where the patient or family members can observe the standard of care given to the 
patient, along with other hospital services and treatments.
Patients depend on professionals to act immediately in an emergency, check on 
them frequently, and ensure a good recovery. However, the staff can only provide 
patients with appropriate care when they fulfl their responsibilities quickly and 
have access to suffcient tools and materials that may be required for the treatment 
and comfort of the patient. Therefore, the key aspects infuencing patient satisfac￾tion are the room's layout, furnishings, comfort, cleanliness, and safety as well as 
the nursing staff's attentiveness and care.
The following three crucial functions shall all be accommodated when designing 
a hospital room, which is one of the biggest obstacles faced by designers. The 
patient's room shall frst be relaxing and pleasant. Second, health professionals need 
to be able to move rapidly and effectively navigate the area. Finally, there needs to 
be a place where family members and other visitors can sit comfortably or sleep 
without interfering with the work of the staff or the patient's recovery. Small hospi￾tals might not always be able to do this, but the designer shall always make an effort 
to incorporate such areas.
In a hospital, there are various ward types, including Family Suites, Deluxe 
Rooms, Single-bed (Private) Rooms, Sharing beds (Semi-private) Rooms, General 
Ward (Multiple Beds), Isolation Ward, Postoperative Ward, ICU, ICCU, Nursery, 
etc. According to the patient's ability to pay and/or the severity of their illness, the 
patients in each of these wards shall be kept.
Some of the factors which shall be considered while designing these wards are,

The safety of the workers and patients shall come frst while creating the patient 
rooms. There shall be no hiding places, CCTV can be utilized for surveillance, and 
every corner of the room shall be visible from the exterior corridor, among other 
precautions. There shall not be any sharp-edged furniture, equipment, or accessories 
in the space that could be used as a weapon against other people or oneself. The 
space shall have as few curved angles, hidden, and pull-out items as possible; glass 
shall be avoided in the room; tempered glass shall be used in place of regular glass; 
plastic silver-coated mirrors shall be used in place of glass mirrors; the lowest height 
of the windows shall be higher so that the patient cannot leap out; all windows shall

cloth hanging rods shall be avoided. The fooring in the bathroom and the room shall 
be non-slippery and at zero level, and the bathroom shall  have the appropriate 
grab bars.
The degree of patient satisfaction, which contributes to a rise in the business, is 
one of the most crucial elements in a hospital setting. The degree of employee sat￾isfaction is above this. There are a few factors that can help patients and employees 
feel more satisfed, such as having outstanding facilities and attractive surround￾ings; maintaining average humidity levels; and keeping the room’s temperature 
which shall not be either too high or too low. Rooms shall also have adequate natu￾ral lighting, be odourless, be silent and free from disturbing sounds and noises, be 
constructed to allow cross ventilation, and have windows that provide views of the 
17 Policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)539
outdoors such as trees, gardens, etc. Similar to this, the room shall have space for 
the patient's family and friends to sit comfortably, be designed to be easily cleaned, 
and have entertainment options like television or small indoor/board games like 
ludo, playing cards, chess, etc., as well as attractive wall paintings, wall arts, and 
scenery. Additionally, patients shall have access to free Wi-Fi so they can use their 
smartphones or laptops to access the internet.
Ensure the family’s comfort and convenience. Anxious family members and 
friends frequently accompany patients to hospitals. Additionally, the support of the 
family helps the patient to recover and lowers morbidity. Hence, a Family Support 
Zone shall be provided and shall be situated close to the patient rooms. Facilities 
including a family lounge, consultation rooms, meditation areas, a family cafeteria, 
family sleep rooms, family laundry, etc. shall be available in this area.
17.2.5 Operation Theatre Services
See Table 17.6.
An operating room (O.T.) is a room used for performing operations, surgeries, 
and other invasive interventions. All employees entering the OT Complex are 
required to wear protective apparel such as shoe covers, masks, caps, eye shields, 
and other coverings to stop the spread of germs and microorganisms, creating a 
sterile atmosphere. The area is well-lit, and the humidity and temperature are kept 
within acceptable ranges.
The phrase “Operating Theatre Suite/Complex” cannot be fully defned by the 
Operating Theatre alone. It represents a bundle of distinct rooms located around the 
entire complex.
It must be verifed that before the beginning of the surgeries in the Operating 
Room, all construction work is fnished and services operational. Before the operat￾ing complex can be used to operate, a few things need to be addressed are like the 
necessary infrastructure has been provided, the necessary services are available, the 
proper furniture and fxtures are in place, the necessary electrical points and com￾munication ports have been installed, the required public utilities have been installed, 
the essential signage, wayfnding, and display mechanisms are in place, the relevant 
instrument/equipment/gadgets are available, the necessary facilities are available, 
and the appropriate patient/staff/visitor safety mechanisms are available.

babies. This shall be referred to as “LDR” for this chapter (Labor, Delivery, and 
Resuscitation).
To assess the LDR, the staff is required to wear protective apparel such as shoe 
covers, masks, caps, eye shields, and other coverings to stop the spread of germs and 
microorganisms, creating a sterile atmosphere. The area shall be well-lit, and the 
temperature and humidity kept within acceptable ranges.
Delivery Suits, on the other hand, are more like a collection of various rooms 
dispersed around the complex's many zones, such as the Unsterile Zone, Protective 
Zone, and Delivery Zone.
While planning and designing the Delivery Suite in the hospital, it has to be 
ensured that all the works are complete and operational. Similarly, all the services 
shall be operational before the delivery starts in the Delivery Suite.
Just like the Operating Complex, in Delivery Suite also few issues need to be 
ensured before the hospital is in operation. Such issues are like the required infra￾structure is provided; the layout of the department is perfect; required services are 
available; proper furniture and fxtures are in place; required electrical points and 
communication ports have been provided; public utilities have been provided; sig￾nage, wayfnding, and display mechanisms are in place; required instrument/

17.2.7 Imaging Department Services
See Table 17.8.
The department of Radiology is responsible for using medical imaging to diag￾nose and treat illnesses. Imaging modalities can be based on a variety of imaging 
techniques. X-rays, ultrasound waves, magnetic felds, and nuclear medicine are the 
main techniques.
X-ray radiography, ultrasound equipment, computed tomography (CT), mag￾netic resonance imaging (MRI), mammography imaging, nuclear positron emission 
computed tomography (PET-CT), nuclear positron emission magnetic resonance 
imaging (PET-MRI), SPECT-CT, cyclotron/radio pharmacy, densitometer, bone 
scan, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA), among other imaging modalities, 
are examples of various imaging devices.
Diagnostic vs. Therapeutic: Diagnostic radiology is a science that uses a variety 
of imaging techniques to diagnose diseases, leaving doctors to manage the actual 
treatment. In this case, diagnostic imaging aids doctors in correctly diagnosing an 
illness. On the other hand, therapeutic radiology includes both diagnosis and treat￾ment, such as peripheral shunting. Therapeutic radiology, including interventional 
radiology, enables the performing of (usually minimally invasive) medical proce￾dures under the guidance of imaging technologies.
It is important to highlight that the department of radio diagnosis is at the correct 
location in the hospital premises, shall have suffcient resources to ensure radiation 
exposure protection, and shall not obstruct the operation of other departments.
Radiology is the department that uses various types of imaging techniques based 
on which imaging modalities are worked out. These techniques are like X-ray, ultra￾sound waves, magnetic felds, and nuclear medicine.
Imaging modalities based on these above four techniques are:
• X-ray Radiography
• Computed Tomography (CT)
• Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
• Ultrasound Machines

services is the clinical laboratory, which should give the clinical services its whole￾hearted support. It is also known as the “LAB” in hospitals.
The laboratory offers the tools necessary to use scientifc methods in the diagno￾sis, treatment, and investigation of clinical phenomena related to a disease. To 
ensure that this department is being utilized to its fullest potential, it should be care￾fully planned and managed. Pathology laboratory tests are invaluable for confrming 
and enhancing clinical fndings, but a laboratory diagnosis which only addresses a 
few bodily processes must never take the place of a clinical diagnosis based on an 
evaluation of the patient as a whole.
Broadly, the laboratories are divided into three main branches, i.e., Pathology, 
Biochemistry, and Microbiology. Further, all these three branches are divided into 
different sub-branches.
General pathology is performed by specialists in the feld and focuses on analyz￾ing known clinical abnormalities that are precursors or markers for both infectious 
and noninfectious diseases. Clinical pathology and anatomical pathology are the 
two main specializations.
There are other specializations based on sample types (such as cytopathology, 
histopathology, and hematopathology), organs (such as renal pathology), physio￾logical systems (such as oral pathology), and examination focus (such as forensic 
pathology).
Promoters are responsible for determining which pathology branches and sub￾branches need to be provided at the hospital and how much space is needed for each.
The study of chemical reactions that take place inside and around living things is 
known as biochemistry. The sciences of structural biology, enzymology, and 
17.2 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)556
metabolism might be considered subfelds of biochemistry, a branch of both chem￾istry and biology. Biochemistry has excelled in explaining life processes through 
these three disciplines over the past few decades of the twentieth century. 
Biochemical methods and research are revealing and developing almost all aspects 
of the biological sciences. Understanding the chemical basis of biological mole￾cules and the interactions between and within live cells is the focus of 
biochemistry.
There are many sub-branches of biochemistry, and it is up to the promoters to 
select which branches and sub-branches should be provided at the hospital and how 
much space should be allocated as a result.
Bacteriology (the study of bacteria), phycology (the study of algae), mycology 
(the study of fungi), virology (the study of viruses, and how they function inside 
cells), and parasitology (the study of parasites) are some of the sub-disciplines that 
make up the feld of microbiology.
In addition to these main branches, microbiology has numerous sub-branches. It 
is up to the promoters to select which microbiology branches and sub-branches 
should be offered in the hospital and how much room will be needed for each.
17.2.9 Blood Bank Services
See Table 17.10.
A blood bank is a facility that collects and tests donated blood, separates it into 
components, stores it, and prepares it for transfusion to recipients.
Because the Blood Bank is a regulated department in the hospital, it is recom￾mended that the rules, regulations, norms, and guidelines of the controlling author￾ity of the respective country shall be considered before planning and designing the 
blood bank.
Blood banks have four major functions area
Receiving: The blood bank's receiving section is used to collect blood from 
donors and to give them facilities for recovering after bleeding
Storage: The storage area is used for storing untested blood, tested blood, and 
blood components.
Testing: A testing area is set aside for screening the blood donated for ruling out 
the presence of infectious diseases in the blood.
Distribution: This area is designated to distribute the tested blood to the patients 
for transfusion.
The testing area of the blood bank is designated for the testing of donated blood. 
There are two sections of the laboratory. One is the Serology Lab which is a division 
for blood group serology, and the second is the TT Lab for testing blood for hepati￾tis B antigens, HIV antibodies, etc.
Storing area of the blood bank is used for storing the blood that has still to be 
screened. Also, the post-screened blood is stored in these areas. If the blood that has 
to be stored is excessively high, the option of chilled rooms shall be considered.

17.2.10 Nursing Services
See Table 17.11.
Nursing care is extremely important for good patient outcomes. While the doctor 
plans the treatment and carries out some of the procedures, it is the nurse who 
implements most of the management of the patient. Whereas the doctor sees the 
patient for a short time, the nurse is with him/her for most of the time looking after 
and caring for. The treatment of the patient or the name of the hospital depends upon 
the quality of the nursing care provided.
A very important factor in the care of the patient is the close cooperation between 
the doctor and the nurse. Much depends on how his orders are carried out and on the 
nursing care rendered to the patient.
As a result of the development of nursing, it has become a highly complex func￾tion that demands much training and skill.
While planning the type of organization of nursing, the purpose of nursing is to 
be kept in mind. The primary purpose of a department of nursing is to provide safe, 
effective, and well-planned nursing care for patients.
The organization of the nursing department of the hospital will depend upon 
several factors, i.e. the size of the hospital, the type of the hospital, whether the 
student nurses are taken, and whether the purpose is to have the school of nursing or 
not, etc.
The motive of every hospital should be to provide the best medical care to the 
patient. In doing so, the major responsibility should be placed on the nursing depart￾ment, which bears a constant and intimate relationship to the patient throughout the 
entire period of his stay in the hospital. The requirements for effcient nursing care 
are essential. They comprise the following four factors:

the country. It may relate to the crime, i.e. Stab or the blunt injury caused by the 
weapon, traffc, or industrial accidents or attempted suicide, rape, drowning, electric 
shock, etc. In the case of the MLC, it is the responsibility of the hospital authority 
to inform the police regarding the details of the case. Except for the legal formalities 
involved, the procedure for handling the patient is the same as in the case of non￾MLC. In the case of MLC, care should be taken that no record is directly given to 
the police except with the written permission. The procedure in the case of the MLC 
is as follows:
As soon as the patient is received in the emergency, frst of all, it should be seen 
if the patient is of MLC nature. If the patient is of MLC nature, the police

The Emergency Medical Offcer (EMO) should take into custody the clothes of 
the MLC involved in rape, stab injury, bullet injury, etc. The EMO must sign the 
corresponding cut on the clothes. Then, these clothes should be packed in a parcel, 
sealed, and sent to the police. At the same time, the injury report should be flled up 
in duplicate and copy be kept with the hospital and the original be handed over to 
the police department as and when demanded by them. While flling up the injury 
report, care should be taken to mention the details in full as to the nature of the 
injury, the size of the injury, the person who brought the patient, the initial fndings 
as to the blood pressure, the pulse and the general condition of the patient, the mark 
of the identifcation, the thumb impression of the patient (LTI in case of the male 
patient and the RTI in the case of the female patients), time at which the patient was 
received, the address of the patient, etc.
Also at the time of flling up the injury report, the injury details should be flled 
up in the injury identifcation form. While getting the registration of the MLC, the 
seal in a red colour stating “MLC” should be stamped on every document as a sym￾bol that the patient is an MLC and no document should be given to the patient or the 
attendant thereof except with the written permission of the police.
17.2 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)566
In case the MLC patient expires, the body of the patient should be sent to the 
mortuary for the postmortem and should not be handed over to the relatives of the 
deceased. The body in such a case has to be handed over to the police and with the 
written permission of the police or the court of law, the body can be handed over to 
the relatives of the deceased.
17.2.12 Accounts/Financial Management
See Table 17.13.
In a hospital, accounting means maintenance of the records of the amounts of 
money received and spent, amount collectable and payable, borrowed, and 
lent. Preparation and presentation of the results of the income and expenditure of a 
particular period by preparing the Proft and Loss or Income and Expenditure 
Account. Calculating the position of the assets and liabilities on a particular date by 
preparing the Balance Sheet. At times prepare the Funds Flow Statement for ana￾lysing the movement of the funds collected. These statements are prepared for the 
owners, trustees, and shareholders of the hospital and various Government depart￾ments and lending institutions. The records under fnancial accounting are main￾tained in a format prescribed by the statutory authority, say income tax department, 
or the professional bodies. The role of fnancial accounting starts right from the 
billing and ends with the preparation of the Balance Sheet.
Management Accounting also a part of accounting can be defned as the process 
of identifcation, measurement, accumulation, analysis, and communication of 
information regarding the operations. The main purpose of this accounting is to 
provide the management with the required information to ensure a more effective 
discharge of their duties and responsibilities.
It helps the management to plan for the long-term and the short-term planning, 
enforcing indirect fnancial discipline over its operation, advising for making deci￾sions when faced with alternatives which have fnancial implications and of course 
the formulation of the policies of the hospital. Management accounting includes the 
preparation of the Budget based on the forecasting of the income and the expendi￾ture, etc. and the comparison of the actual transaction with the budget fgures and 
reasoning for the difference.
It also includes the Costing for determining the actual cost of the product and 
services and to calculate the cost of operating various centres, which in turn helps in 
the preparation of the charge list of the hospital.
The term management accounting also includes the Management Information 
System (MIS) to provide information on the activities of the hospital in terms of 
fgures and the analysis of the data. The information for management accounting is 
mainly derived from fnancial accounting and supporting records. This information 
is then analyzed to reach a particular conclusion. The information not only includes 
the fnancial fgures but also quantitative data such as the number of beds, the 
employees working, the number of laboratory tests done, the number of the X-rays

The term management accounting also includes Pricing, which means the struc￾turing of the rates to be charged to the patient for the service provided. The pricing 
also helps the management to take decisions as how much discounts can be given to 
the poor patient and also to decide how many patients can be treated for free.
Before the capital investment in the equipment or the building, the management 
has to decide the cost of the equipment or the building and the feasibility of the 
purchase of the same. The Capital Expenditure Appraisal Technique is the 
answer for the same.

17 Policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)573
control and coordination will depend on a suitable organizational structure and ade￾quate supervision. Activities to be performed and personnel needed shall be grouped 
in such a way as to achieve smooth functioning. An organization chart is a working 
tool for the orderly arrangement of work and people. Through its design, it shall 
indicate the grouping of persons concerning one another and bring out the lines of 
authority. The chart shall ft the individual hospital. While human elements shall be 
taken into consideration, adjustments on this basis shall not violate the basic prin￾ciples underlying lines of authority.
The medical staff is the chief agency through which the hospital achieves its 
prime objective, which is the proper care of patients who are sick or injured. Here, 
the doctor is the decision-maker on the major part of treatment whether as an outpa￾tient or inpatient. Hence, the proper choice and retention of doctors are extremely 
important for the smooth and competent functioning of the hospital.
The management philosophy of the hospital administrator will determine the 
philosophy of personnel management in each department and the relationship 
among the department heads. In most hospitals, patient care is the main objective. 
There can be other objectives in the hospital, which depend upon the size and the 
scope of the hospital, e.g. the training programme, the education programme, com￾munity health, the research activities, etc.
Human endeavour in this twentieth century has become so complex that the 
administration of any activity offers problems unknown in the simple enterprises of 
an earlier civilization. Any organization provides for a combined effort of men and 
materials and efforts made to prevent negligence of any duty or duplication of work, 
and thus to produce the required results. All this can be effciently achieved with the 
help of the predefned and designed ORGANIZATIONAL CHART, where all the 
duties and responsibilities of the individual are predefned and elaborated.
The Governing Body shall release that the medical staff of the hospital must be 
appointed with utmost care and only capable staff to be appointed so that the maxi￾mum care can be provided to the sick patient.
While preparing the organizational chart, it shall be made clear that all the duties 
are defned and there shall be no overlapping of duties, i.e. every individual shall 
have a predefned set of duties. Waste of effort and extravagance in the use of men 
and materials prevent the economy. In the organizational chart, the authority shall 
be centralized, responsibilities fxed, and duties and interrelationships clearly 
defned.
First of all, department-wise and category-wise staff requirements shall be 
worked out based on factors like the number of beds, clinical departments, services 
provided, the number of patients, duty hours, and availability of staff.
As a guide in selecting the Medical Staff and as a safeguard for preventing the 
appointment of those who are not desirable, certain minimum qualifcations shall be 
adopted and rigidly enforced.
The working of present days of most organizations is through committees. If car￾ried out properly, it can be of great help. It brings out the combined wisdom of 
knowledge of the people who discuss matters concerning the organization. The 
committee views the problem from various angles and fnally, a consensus emerges 
17.2 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)574
which is, hopefully, the best alternative. The committees elected from the staff 
appointed by the Governing Body may perform much of the work of the hospital. 
These committees are, normally, of two types (a) Standing committees and (b) 
Special committees.
A good hospital runs just like a well-lubricated machine. Excellent and safe 
patient care can be achieved if all the pieces and processes work together. This result 
can only be achieved if the hospital has all of those systems, manpower, and pro￾cesses in place. Staff members shall be made very clear as to what they have to do 
and what is expected from them. It is equally important that the staff shall be given 
an effective set of rules, regulations, and procedures which shall guide them in their 
day-to-day tasks. In a hospital where the staff diverts from the defned, rules, regula￾tions, procedures, and standards, it can be detrimental to the hospital. Inconsistency 
can deteriorate the quality of patient care and could be detrimental to the patient and 
can spoil the reputation of the hospital.
This is the reason why the set of rules, regulations, systems, policies, and proce￾dures is important for hospitals. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a good 
and time-tested set of rules, regulation, systems, policies, and procedures policies, 
to ease the staff to function effectively and effciently and ensures the safety of the 
patients and staff.
Hospital policies and procedures guide day-to-day operations and make sure that 
everything is running as it was expected. The policies and procedures defne the 
expectations and standards of staff, set guidelines for operations and improvements, 
and streamline processes.
To summarize we can say that the main purpose of having these policies and 
procedures is to establish a high degree of understanding, effciency, cooperation, 
and unity among the employees of the hospital. It also helps to provide uniform 
policies for all employees of the hospital, so that there are no discrepancies.
17.2.14 Central Sterile Supply Department (CSSD)
See Table 17.15.
In any hospital, the importance of sterilization cannot be overemphasized. 
Sterilization is a process that removes microorganisms from hospital instruments, 
linen, operating rooms, and other areas, ensuring infection prevention in the hospi￾tal. The sterilization process kills all microorganisms, whether they are disease￾producing or not. As a result, proper sterilization procedures shall be followed.
The Central Sterile Services Department (CSSD) in hospitals is a centralized 
location that sterilizes medical devices, instruments, linen, and consumables. This is 
a department that assists other hospital departments. This department’s primary 
functions include cleaning, preparing, disinfecting, packing, and sterilising reusable 
medical devices, linen, and surgical instruments.
The goal of the CSSD is to prepare and furnish other departments with sterile 
equipment and supplies needed in the patient's care in OR, ICU, dialysis, all wards,

items used in patient care; establish and follow protocols for effective, sterilization 
process, and maintain records; monitor and ensure controls necessary to prevent 
cross infection according to infection control policy; and maintain supplies and

The sterilization process can be broadly divided into the following categories:
1. Before preparing for sterilization, cleaning the instruments and the linen
2. Packing for sterilization
3. Sterilization
4. Storage after sterilization
5. Distribution of sterilized material to the end users

17.2.15 Dietetic Services
See Table 17.16.
Cooking and serving healthy meals to patients is the responsibility of kitchen 
services, a crucial hospital support service. The kitchen may also provide food to 
hospital workers and guests, depending on hospital policy.
The food service may also involve catering for events and meetings such as board 
meetings, seminars, conferences, and special occasions. Patients of all ages, from 
all religious, ethnic, and social backgrounds, as well as those who are nutritionally 
susceptible due to sickness, shall be able to recognize, enjoy, and enjoy the food.
The hospital kitchen shall be confgured and furnished to accommodate a variety 
of dietary requirements. The kitchen must be able to provide all prescribed diets 
because hospital patients are given diets based on their diseases.
17.2.16 Laundry and Linen Services
See Table 17.17.
The laundry service is to ensure that all users have an adequate supply of clean, 
sterile, and consistent linen. Their primary responsibilities include sorting, washing, 
extracting, drying, ironing, folding, mending, and delivering. This department's pri￾mary goal is to provide clean materials to patients while also maintaining hygiene 
throughout the process.
In hospitals, laundry can be set up in three ways: To begin, the hospital can buy 
laundry equipment and hire employees to run the laundry on hospital grounds. 
Second, the hospital can provide laundry space and hire a contractor to set it up and

17.2.17 Medical Records Department (MRD)
See Table 17.18.
A Medical Record Department (MRD) is responsible for maintaining systematic 
documentation of a patient's medical history as well as current treatment and care. 
The medical record serves as a foundation for future patient care planning, docu￾mentation of communication between the hospital and any other health profession￾als involved in patient care, and aids in the protection of both the patient's and the 
hospital’s legal interests in patient care.
Previously, the majority of medical records were stored in hard copies. As a 
result, a lot of space was needed to keep the hard copies of the records. However, 
most of the records are now being converted to electronic and digital formats as 
information technology advances. However, not all records can be kept digitally, 
and some have to be kept in hard copies. As a result, to effectively preserve medical

Electronic Medical Records (EMRs): It is a computerized recording system

also enables authorized clinicians to access patient records at any time and from any 
online location for assessments and further treatment of the patient. An EMR sys￾tem also necessitates the scanning of various paper records, which can come from 
outside the facility or be brought in by the patient.

and effective environment for both patients and hospital staff. A clean and sanitary 
atmosphere has a huge psychological impact on patients and visitors, and it indi￾cates everything about the level of service provided by the hospital. Because it is 
diffcult for lay people to assess the quality of medical care in a hospital, opinions 
about a hospital are frequently formed based on its appearance and cleanliness. 
Bacteriological purity, on the other hand, should not be overlooked.
Good housekeeping is a valuable asset and a great public relations tool. It has a 
direct impact on a hospital’s prestige and reputation. Because housekeeping is 
responsible for all departments and areas of the hospital, minimizing the risk of 
cross-infection and providing a clean, safe, and comfortable environment are essen￾tial components of any good housekeeping service. The housekeeping department 
is critical to providing quality service and must focus on both bacteriological clean￾liness and external cleanliness.
The job of the housekeeping department has advanced fast in recent years, neces￾sitating not just technical competence but also an awareness of the “Tools of 
Management.” Personnel management consumes a substantial portion of the house￾keeper's work, as the housekeeper must manage the cleaners, the largest and most 
demanding type of human resource to manage. The goal should be to establish an 
effcient department with the lowest feasible operating costs. The housekeeping 
department should not be thought of in isolation because it is a vital source of infor￾mation for many other departments. As a result, cooperative and cheerful personnel 
contribute to the hospital's welcoming and congenial atmosphere.
The cleaning department is a service department that does not generate income. 
A poorly operated department, on the other hand, wastes money and leaves a terri￾ble impression on patients, visitors, and employees, negatively affecting their view 
of the quality of treatment offered by the hospital. This, in turn, will have a negative 
17.2 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)590
impact on the frequency with which patients visit the hospital, affecting income 
indirectly.
Patients enter the hospital through the reception hall, and after completing the 
required basic examinations, they are sent to various places within the facility. The 
patient recognizes numerous features of hygiene and interior design that create a 
tasteful and pleasant mood in each of these locations.
Housekeepers must not only maintain basic cleanliness and hygiene, but also 
contribute to the smooth operation of many departments such as linen, pest con￾trol, trash management, garden care, power, water supply, carpentry, and food 
delivery.
17.2.20 Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Services
See Table 17.21.
Patients who are impaired, disabled, or handicapped can get multidisciplinary 
rehabilitation services and therapies from the Rehabilitation-Allied Health Unit.
The Allied Health Treatments for Rehabilitation include, but are not limited to:
1. Physiotherapy, including
(a) Electrotherapy
(b) Laser Therapies
(c) Manual Therapy
(d) Gait Analysis
(e) Hydrotherapy
(f) Electromyography
2. Occupational Therapy
3. Audiology
4. Speech Therapy
5. Orthotics
6. Podiatry
Both inpatients and outpatients use the services provided by these depart￾ments. In addition, long-term patients with a slow rate of recuperation make use 
of this department's services. The great majority of patients come to this section 
daily. This department shall provide services to patients both within the depart￾ment and in the indoor patient wards/rooms.
Physiotherapy and its allied services are the most important. As a result, in 
this chapter, we will go over the Department of Physiotherapy and Occupational 
Therapy in greater detail.

17.2.21 Front Desk Services
See Table 17.22.
Any hospital is a busy place. To function properly, rigorous administration, 
scheduling, communication, and dedication are required. The front offce personnel 
is in charge of these details. The front offce is the frst point of contact for patients 
during a hospital or medical facility visit, and it is critical to the organization's repu￾tation and fnancial stability.
Hospitals have specifc security and operating requirements. Every day, hospital 
facilities serve hundreds of thousands of patients and visitors. Managing these visi￾tors and patients in the reception area with a paper-based system is a time-consum￾ing and insecure operation. The visitor management system, for example, is one 
method of managing these guests in the welcome area. For hospitals, the visitor 
management system makes handling guest check-ins simple and secure.
A receptionist is essential in a medical facility because they provide customer 
service and administrative tasks such as organising appointments, answering 
patients’ inquiries, answering phone calls, and placing calls to confrm patients’ 
appointments.
17.2.22 Security Services
See Table 17.23.
Security service in a hospital is a service responsible for ensuring the security 
and safety of the hospital plant, personnel, patients and public as well as regulating 
the traffc within the hospital premises.
A hospital is a busy public place where people come to get care, comfort, and 
cures. Every day, thousands of people visit the hospital. It is quite impossible to spot 
any antisocial elements in a crowd or predict anyone’s intentions. As a result, 
unforeseen unfavourable circumstances like disputes, raucous scenes, accidents, or

thefts continue to occur in hospitals. In terms of security, the majority of hospitals 
are regarded as “soft targets.” As a result, they may be more susceptible to specifc 
security threats.
Although every staff member is responsible for safety and security, the technical 
staff, who are busy with patient care, do not have the time or training in these areas. 
Patients, on the whole, are incapable of protecting themselves or their families.
As a result, hospitals must have a separate and specialized department called 
security service, which is tasked with overseeing the entire hospital organization 
and preventing anything unpleasant (of a nonmedical, nontechnical type) from 
occurring.
The role of security services is to prevent and address any disruption or breach in 
security so that the hospital may operate effciently and without interruption.
Their primary responsibilities include the protection of the hospital, its staff and 
property, the patients/public and their property, traffc control, and the operation of 
a lost and found service.

17.2 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)598
Many people enter and exit large hospitals at various times of the day. Threats of 
violence, theft, and other crimes are real concerns in a hospital setting, and patients 
are most vulnerable when they are sick and admitted. If security measures are not in 
place, hospitals might be easy targets for theft of medical equipment or personal 
belongings of patients and staff members. Other disruptions, such as uninvited 
guests or inebriated visits, may cause patients unnecessary stress. Hospitals must 
also protect a large amount of personal information, which should be protected by a 
security system.
17.2.23 Stores, Purchase, and Materials Management
See Table 17.24.
Stores are an essential component of any hospital. It is the hub of activity where 
materials used in the hospital are managed.
The store’s primary goals are to ensure (1) the availability of a balanced and 
timely fow of all materials such as consumables, medical disposables, spare parts 
and components, tools and equipment, and other general supplies, (2) the receipt, 
inspection, and issue of the aforementioned supplies/stores to the hospital, and (3) 
the acceptance, storage, and disposal of scrap and unwanted supplies/stores.
Consumable stores, non-consumable stores, general stores, medical and phar￾macy stores, equipment stores, surgical stores, stationery stores, linen stores, engi￾neering and maintenance stores, dietary stores, and condemnation stores are the 
stores that a hospital requires.
This set of checklists shall assist the planner and designer in remembering all 
such issues relating to the design of stores and shall guide him/her in completing all 
works/activities on time. This shall assist him/her in ensuring that all works/activi￾ties are completed.
As medical equipment is the most vital component in any hospital. Therefore, it 
is, important that hospitals effciently manage their medical equipment to keep their 
expenditures under control as well as ensure the quality of services delivered by the 
hospital.
The best tool for effcient controlling of medical equipment is “Medical 
Equipment Management (MEM).”
If a proper MEM system is implemented in the hospital, it will assist hospitals in 
properly developing, monitoring, and managing their equipment, as well as promot￾ing the safe, effective, and economical use and maintenance of equipment.
Responsible organizations should set up and review MEM regularly to ensure 
that a suitable medical device is used following the manufacturer’s instructions, is 
kept in a safe and reliable condition, and is disposed of properly at the end of its 
useful life.
The total MEM consists of nine different stages, which are as follows:
1. Planning of the medical equipment in terms of requirements and specifcations
2. Identifcation of the vendors

The pharmacy plays an important role in the hospital because it is the centre for 
dispensing medicines, injectable, cotton and bandages, surgical disposables such as 
catheters, and so on to all inpatients and outpatients.
In most hospitals, there are two pharmacy units from which drugs shall be dis￾bursed. One unit is responsible for dispensing medications to inpatients, while the 
other is responsible for dispensing medications to outpatients.
For inpatients, medications are typically given directly from the pharmacy to the 
appropriate wards, eliminating the need for a separate drug dispensing counter. 
17.2 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)608
Nonetheless, a retail pharmacy counter shall be available for patients who are 
outsiders.
The pharmacy counter or store is essentially a licenced establishment, and both 
the inpatient pharmacy and the retail pharmacy counter need their own licenses. It 
shall be necessary to obtain a separate wholesale pharmacy license if the hospital 
distributes medications wholesale. Similar to this, additional licenses shall be 
needed to deal with narcotic medications like ketamine and other similar substances.
In the hospital, pharmacy services are provided in a variety of ways. These can 
be self-owned pharmacies for both inpatients and outpatients; outsourced retail 
pharmacies for both inpatients and outpatients; or self-owned pharmacies for inpa￾tients and outsourced retail pharmacies for outpatients. In any case, the hospital 
shall have dual pharmacies, one dealing with the inpatients and the other with the 
outpatients.
17.2.26 Maintenance Departments
See Table 17.27.
Any asset you develop shall, by defnition, require repairs and maintenance. All 
medical equipment and hospital buildings require repairs and maintenance. This can 
be outsourced, or in-house repair and maintenance facilities can be built. 
Outsourcing, on the other hand, raises the expense of repair and maintenance, and it 
sometimes takes longer to fx an asset. As a result, it is recommended that hospitals 
build up in-house repair and maintenance facilities.
For the upkeep and maintenance of the hospital assets, the hospital generally 
requires workshops such as biomedical workshops, electrical workshops, HVAC 
workshops, MGPS workshops, low voltage workshops, building maintenance, 
mechanical workshops, frefghting workshops, and automobile workshops, 
among others.
The maintenance service is responsible for ensuring the safe, cost-effective oper￾ation, and maintenance of hospital facilities and expensive equipment to create a 
hospital physical environment conducive to the well-being of the patients.
