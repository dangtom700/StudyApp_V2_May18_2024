Preface
Polymer-supported organic catalysts are largely insoluble in most reaction 
solvents, which allows for easy recovery and recycling of the catalysts. They are 
generally stable, readily available, and environmentally friendly, so they have 
attracted the interest of many synthetic chemists in the industrial and academic 
fields. The immobilization of achiral and chiral catalysts on polymer supports
has drawn the interest of many researchers. To date, much effort has been put 
into the design and development of polymer-supported organic catalysts with the 
goal of achieving high catalytic performance while also being reusable. Some of 
these catalysts have recently been extended to continuous-flow processes, making
them even more appealing tools in terms of operational simplicity, environmental 
compatibility, and cost efficiency. In this book, different types of polymer
supported catalysts based on peptides, polystyrene, polyethers, poly(acrylic acid), 
poly(ethylene imine), poly(2-oxazoline), poly(isobutylene), poly(norbornene), etc.,
as well as metals such as Ruthenium, Iridium, Cobalt, Copper, and Rhodium, are 
included with their synthetic organic synthesis applications. 
It is believed that this work will be of general interest to organic chemists, 
materials scientists, chemical engineers, polymer scientists and technologists. The 
editors would like to thank several scientists in this field at various institutes for 
their assistance in compiling unique knowledge of this class of materials.

1. Background 
Polymer-supported organic catalysts (PSOCs) are a class of heterogeneous 
catalysts that consist of an organic catalyst attached to a polymer matrix where 
organic catalysts can be defined by low molecular weight organic compounds 
able to boost a transformation in substoichiometric quantity (Shajahan et al. 
2022, Benaglia et al. 2003). PSOCs have procured significance possessing 
inert, non-volatile, innocuous, reusable, and indissoluble astounding properties 
provided with the use of catalyst support which offers an easy synthetic path, 
materials availability, and higher efficiency (Li et al. 2023, Clapham et al. 
2001). The use of PSOCs has gained significant attention in recent years as they 
offer several advantages over traditional catalysts such as ease of separation 
and recovery from reaction mixtures due to the immobilization on solid support 
resulting in easy filtration and removal (Liu et al. 2022, Ramey et al. 2023). 
These unique properties simplify the purification process by inhibiting the 
waste, making PSOCs more environmentally friendly than traditional catalysts 
(Wang et al. 2022a). These are highly versatile as the choice of polymers as well 
as catalysts can be tailored to suit a wide range of reactions (Silva et al. 2022). 
The polymer matrix can be compatible with various solvents, temperatures, and 
reaction conditions, making PSOCs suitable for use in a variety of industries, 
including pharmaceuticals, materials, and fine chemicals (Wang et al. 2022b, 
Chakravarthy et al. 2023).

2 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
The application by suitable mixes of polymer-supported reagents, catalysts, 
and or scavengers is a strong strategy for the synthesis and simultaneous synthesis 
of small organic compounds (Siewniak et al. 2022). The use of polymer supports 
in organic synthesis began with solid-phase synthesis where the synthetic target 
is synthesized and attached to the polymer (Sherrington 2001). For a variety 
of reasons, including ease of reaction monitoring and product characterization, 
shorter method development time, etc., the role of the polymer has gradually 
shifted to supporting reagents for reacting with solution-phase substrates in what 
is sometimes referred to as polymer-assisted-synthesis (Hodge 2005). 
The use of polymer supports in organic synthesis began with solid-phase 
synthesis where the synthetic target is synthesized and attached to the polymer 
(Kobayashi and Akiyama 2003). For a variety of reasons, including ease of 
reaction monitoring and product characterization, shorter method development 
time, etc., the role of the polymer has gradually shifted to supporting reagents 
for reacting with solution-phase substrates in what is sometimes referred to as 
polymer-assisted synthesis (Zhou et al. 2013). In this book, we have covered 13 
chapters discussing various organic syntheses with support of various polymers 
such as peptides, polystyrene, alkaloids, polyisobutylene, poly (ethylene imine), 
polyacrylic acid, poly (2-oxazoline), polyethers, polynorbornenes, and polymers 
coordinating with transition metals like ruthenium, iridium, palladium, cobalt, 
copper, and rhodium. 
In this context, chapter 2 discusses the peptides-supported catalysts including 
peptide catalysts in water and peptide catalysts in a mixture followed by their 
various synthetic approaches and applications. Chapter 3 includes polymer‐
supported phase transfer catalysts and discusses their types including quaternary 
ammonium and phosphonium salts, crown ethers, cryptands, and others. In 
addition, the chapter includes the principle and mechanism of phase transfer 
catalysts along with their numerous synthesis approaches. The characterization and 
applications of phase transfer catalysts have also been discussed in that chapter. 
Chapter 4 comprises the achiral polymer-supported organic reagents in which 
the opening of epoxides using polymer-supported organic catalysts has been 
discussed along with the application of polymer-supported organic catalysts in 
the formation of cyclic products. This chapter has also been complimented with 
hydrogenation reactions using polymer-immobilized catalysts and the application 
of polymer-supported organic catalysts in aldol reactions. Chapter 5 discusses 
about alkaloid supported catalyst. The chapter includes the classification of
alkaloids followed by pharmacological applications of alkaloids. The role of 
alkaloids has been discussed in the organic reactions as well as the discussion 
about platinum cinchona alkaloid catalyst for enantioselective α-Ketoester has 
also been given. The authors have summed up the chapter with conjugate addition 
reactions via cinchona alkaloid catalysts. 
Chapter 6 includes cross-coupling reactions, organic synthesis and 
applications of polystyrene supported catalysts. Chapter 7 is a detailed discussion 
of polyacrylic acid and its derivatives-supported catalyst. The chapter discusses  
Polymer-supported Organic Catalysts: An Introduction 3 
various derivatives of this catalyst using rhodium, platinum, palladium, TEMPO, 
and others. In a nutshell, applications of these catalysts have been discussed. 
Chapter 8 is a detailed discussion of polyether-supported catalysts comprising 
synthesis, properties such as selectivity, recyclability, stability, and applications 
in various sectors including organic synthesis, environmental remediations, 
pharmaceuticals, fuel cells, etc. 
Chapter 9 is a sum up of poly(ethylene imine) and poly(2-oxazoline)-
supported catalysts consisting of the general discussion about these followed 
by their synthetic approaches and applications in numerous sectors. Chapter 
10 discusses the polyisobutylene and polynorbornenes-supported catalysts and 
includes a discussion of the mode of isobutylene and norbornene polymerization 
and a detailed discussion about these followed by the applications in numerous 
reactions such as coupling reactions, Heck coupling reactions, Suzuki coupling 
reactions, Sonogashira coupling reaction, epoxidation and some more. Chapter

includes polystyrene-containing palladium catalysts. In addition the chapter 
describe about polystyrene supported palladium catalysts along with polymer 
support other than polystyrene. In a nutshell, chapter 14 includes cobalt, copper, 
and rhodium-containing polymer-supported catalysts. This chapter includes 
a detailed discussion about the chitosan-supported cobalt catalysts, chitosan￾supported copper catalysts and chitosan-supported rhodium catalysts.

1. Introduction 
The peptides can be used in several organic syntheses as catalysts. Almost every 
peptide catalyst consists of few amino acids and is not that complex. The scope 
of modulation by slightly changing the sequences of amino acids creates an 
probability to serve use in specific reactions. Various strategies that have been 
put forward for obtaining specifically capable catalysts are the unique design 
of peptide structures, their screening, and modification of the peptides that are 
naturally obtained. Specific amino acid in the peptide catalysts provides a base to 
bind with substrate and sometimes benefit of an active catalyst in water (Arnold 
et al. 2003). In some cases, peptides are also subjected to be used as templates 
for noble metals, which can finally be used as catalysts.
Due to their asymmetric structure, they are highly preferred for selective 
reactions as well (Lieblich et al. 2017).
The extravagant nature of these special metal catalysts supported on a peptide 
template makes way for multiple applications, out of which a predominant one 
is of Au nanoparticle acting as a catalyst. The entire process - beginning from 
its synthesis to its use in real, or we can say practical, world - is enhanced and 
makes the Au NPs more biocompatible. 
Further, the chapter includes an extended example of peptide-supported 
platinum and palladium catalysts with their applications in different fields and 
scope of modification by changing amino acid sequences in the peptide chain.

2. Peptide catalyst in water 
The use of tripeptide with an alkyl chain as a base for the study of proceeding 
reaction can be taken into consideration. 
For example: H-dPro-Pro-Glu-NHC12H151 
The salient feature of this peptide catalyst is that it is stereo selective in nature. 
It is incorporated for the addition reaction including formation of nitro olefins 
from aldehydes in water (sometimes in other organic solvents too) (Lummis 
et al. 2005). 
The first step of the reaction involves formation of intermediate (enamine). 
The factor affecting efficiency of the catalyst being used is the cis/trans ratio
of amide bond in dPro-Pro. Higher the ratio, higher is the expected efficiency 
(Holzberger and Marx 2010).
The water media provides the facility to form emulsion and increases the 
efficacy of water insoluble substrates through the alkyl chain. Further addition 
of any additives like alcohols, carboxylic acids or metal complexes could affect 
the way the peptide (Figure 1) reacts as it can form intermediates. Drop in the 
rate of formation of certain by-product can also be observed as one of the effects.
Figure 1. H-dPro-Pro-Glu-NHC12H25 (peptide 1)
Figure 1 shows high chemo selectivity even in the availability of abundant 
compounds and water as a medium. The functional groups present in the 
compounds too do not tend to interfere, thus a possible process in all. 
3. Peptide catalyst in mixture 
The peptide1 catalysis also functioned well in a mixture of multi components of 
approximately related nature. Various sources of water were basically projected 
for the study. 
Basically, they are alternative mixtures having water like solvents. The point 
where these mixtures differ is the varied pH, viscosity and polarity (and obviously
composition). These variation factors help to provide a suitable environment for  
 
 
 
 
Peptide-supported Catalyst: Synthesis and Applications 7 
Figure 2. Diagram illustrates the sources replicating water in terms of medium 
observing the effects each and every aspect can bring on the table (Schnitzer
et al. 2022). 
Various experiments showed that aldehydes and nitro olefins do not react
at all when a peptide 1 catalyst was not present whereas they showed a good 
yield of products in its presence (Chatterjee et al. 2022). There was an expected 
difference in their stereo selectivity as in different types of solvents (Figure 2). 
The ratios of diastereomers in different type of solvents are observed as follows: 
93:7 in vodka and 98:2 in green tea. 
4. Synthesis of peptide supported catalyst 
4.1 Peptide-supported noble metal nanoparticle 
Attributed to the high activity and selectivity of the noble metal catalysts (Wang 
et al. 2017), as per the Wang et al 2017 their use in various fields. However, 
the sustained and in control syntheses of such types of nanoparticles is still 
a challenge (Slocik et al. 2006). Therefore, to overcome this problem some 
peptides are used as templates. The key points for their effectiveness are their 
ability to bind specifically to some specific binding sites of the metal and their 
property of self-assembly. On the plus side, the peptides as templates provide: 
• Controlled size and shape
• Specific structure
• Desired composition
Enhancement in catalytic behavior is one of the perks too, in comparison 
with conventional catalysts. The factors that influence this increased activity
are improvements in electron conductivity, metal dispersion and exposure to 
reactive sites. 
The two types of variants which are studied extensively are: 
1. Bimetallic 
2. Monometallic  
 
 
 
 
 
8 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
The method which is widely used to synthesize such catalyst is chemical
reduction where ascorbic acid is employed as a reducing agent while the peptide 
acts as a capping agent (Kengo 2018). It has been reported that sometimes the 
peptide can act as a reducing agent as well. 
Various types of nanoparticle catalysts can be obtained by just varying the 
peptide sequence, peptide ratio, pH and time of the reaction shown in Figure 3. 
Figure 3. Flowchart illustrating the process of nanoparticle synthesis 
Some notable examples are: 
1. Peptide-supported Au catalyst 
2. Pd and Pt catalysts (Briggs et al. 2015, Wang et al. 2016a)
The formation of 1D and 2D metal nanostructures can be attained by changing 
metal/peptide ratio as in case of Pd catalyst where morphological changes were 
observed by surging the Pd/ peptide ratio from 60 to 120 (change was from
spherical structure to nanoparticle network) (Palafox-Hernandez et al. 2016).
4.2 Peptide-supported noble metal nanofilm 
There are some noteworthy peptide templates which have the capability of 
forming nanofilms by sequential association of nanofibers (Choi et al. 2011, 
Vinod et al. 2013). The example supporting the statement is of a conductive Au 
nano film, which was synthesized by Jelinek and others. 
• The nanofiber film was supported on a peptide monolayer. 
• A TEM grid was employed to load the peptide, i.e. ((Phe-Lys) 5-Pro) nano 
film which was further floated over solution of Au (SCN) 41A. Here it is to be 
specified that the Au complex was negatively charged so it could easily bind to 
the nano film of peptide. 
• Therefore, the complex eventually reduced into metallic Au. 
• This process was followed by fabrication (Vinod et al. 2013) to a great extent; 
this type of peptide based synthesis is proven to be an effective way for 
fabrication of noble metal catalysts.  
 
 
Peptide-supported Catalyst: Synthesis and Applications 9 
However, it’s a time consuming procedure, which is a primary concern while 
adopting this. Hence, a more time efficient modification towards this approach 
is required. 
Attributed to this, an advanced method of synthesizing nano film (peptide 
template noble metal) came into picture where argon glow discharge is used as 
an affordable electron source for electron reduction at room temperature (Li et 
al. 2016, Zhou et al. 2013a, Wang et al. 2014, 2016b). The method including
glow discharge is also referred to as the cold plasma phenomenon. Also, this 
process is free from usage of any reducing agents (Pan et al. 2015, Yan et al. 
2013). The fact that it takes place at room temperature leads to the formation of 
smaller nanoparticles. 
Through many experimental studies, the researchers came to the conclusion 
that the electron reduction approach is time saving. The difference of the time 
span is due to the formation of hydrating electrons (Pan et al. 2012).
5. Applications 
5.1 Application of peptide-supported gold-catalyst 
Recently, more efforts have been made for the synthesis of peptides and 
proteins-supported gold composites, which can behave like stabilizing and 
reducing agents (Yu et al. 2017). The size, shape, composition, arrangement 
and self-organization of gold nanoparticles play a vital role on its catalytic 
activities. As the preparation of Au-NP with controlled size, required dimensions 
and morphology, preferred biocompatibility and random aggregation is a very 
challenging task, biomimetic approach (Khalil et al. 2022) is the best option for 
formation of gold nanoparticles with required biocompatibility. 
Peptide functionalized gold-nanoparticles are found (Pengo et al. 2005) first 
to be hydrolytically active against carboxylate esters. Dipeptide-functionalized
Au-nanoparticles (3) showed more efficiency over monomeric catalyst (2)
on hydrolysis of 2,4-dinitrophenyl butanoate (DNPB) in lower pH. At pH<7,
nanoparticle-supported dipeptide (3) initiates a cooperative hydrolytic mechanism
with the formation of carboxylate and an imidazolium ion simultaneously which 
causes 300-fold rate acceleration of the hydrolytic process. This is not seen in 
case of an analogous monomeric dipeptide. 
The scope of peptide-supported gold-NPs as esterase was further extended 
towards larger catalyst system like Au-PEP (Pengo et al. 2007). Among the number
of ester compounds like 2,4-dinitrophenyl butyrate (DNPB) and the p-nitrophenyl
esters of benzyloxycarbonyl N-protected leucine and glycine (Z-Leu-PNP and
Z-Gly-PNP, respectively; PNP = p-nitrophenol), DNPB undergo hydrolysis at
low pH value than Z-Leu-PNP and Z-Gly-PNP. 
When the position of histidine amino acid is changed in the peptide chain 
linked with gold nanoparticles, a new set of catalyst system is generated, which 
can be denoted as Au@ExHy (x = heptad repeat, y = position of histidine residue) 
 
 
10 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Figure 4. Different functionalised peptide and ester molecules
(Mikolajczak et al. 2018), e.g. E3H8, E3H15 and E3H22. During the ester
hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenylacetate (4-NPA), it was observed that the hydrophilic 
esters are cleaved most rapidly by Au@E3H15 and more hydrophobic esters are 
efficiently cleaved by Au@E3H8 than Au@E3H22. 
Gold-peptide nanoparticle (GPNP) composites Au@Ac-IVFK-NH2 have 
been synthesized using an ultrashort peptide through a photochemical reduction 
method in absence of any reducing agents. The peptide nanofibers and Au@
NP are attached with each other through the noncovalent type interactions with 
the amino group of the lysine amino acid in the sequence. In presence of UV
irradiation on the aromatic residue, the photoionization of the peptide causes the 
reduction of gold ions. At the same time, the peptide takes the role of a capping 
and stabilizing, reducing agent. Furthermore, the pollutant p-nitrophenol can be 
reduced using these gold-peptide composites within a very short time. However, 
the rate of reaction depends on the peptide-gold nanocomposites’ concentration 
and the rate decreases on dilution of catalyst. This green synthetic method 
will establish new approaches in biocatalysis and environmental applications 
(Abbas et al. 2022).
Peptide-supported gold nanoparticles (pep-Au-NPs) are combined inorganic￾organic non-materials, where catalytically active peptides are immobilized onto 
the metal surface. However, Au-NPs are well known as cascade catalysts used for 
hydrogenation reactions (Corma and Serna 2006) or oxidative transformations (Jv
et al. 2010). In presence of Pep-Au-NPs catalyst, two sequential transformations 
occur under mild conditions in one pot. As an example of Cascade Catalysis, Au@ 
E1H8 can be used to hydrolyse 4-nitrophenylacetate (4-NPA) to 4-nitrophenol 
(4-NP) which will be further reduced to 4-aminophenol via NaBH4-mediated
hydrogenation in the same reaction medium in one pot reaction (Mikolajczak et 
al. 2018). Here in a single reaction system, peptide monolayer function as esterase 
mimic and Au-NP takes part in reduction process efficiently. 
Peptide-supported Catalyst: Synthesis and Applications 11 
Figure 5. Reduction of 4-nitrophenol catalysed by peptide-supported gold catalyst 
Another example of cascade catalysis is (AuNP@CDs-Azo-GFGH) where 
azobenzene terminated peptides (Azo-GFGH) are linked with β-cyclodextrin￾coated gold-nanoparticles (AuNP@CDs) via photo-switchable host-guest like
interaction. The imidazole moiety of histidine present in Azo-GFGH is also the 
active site of many natural hydrolases like protease, esterase, lipase and glycosyl 
hydrolase (Nothling et al. 2019). High load of peptide (Azo-GFGH) on Au-NP
enhances the ester hydrolysis. The azobenzene molecule, on UV irradiation,
undergoes photoisomerization, and leads to the disassembly of peptide (Tan
et al. 2021). The hydrolysis product 4-nitrophenol will be further reduced to 
4-aminophenol in presence of catalyst (AuNP@CDs) and reducing agent (NaBH4)
under same reaction medium. 
It has been found that β-sheet-forming hepta-peptide IHIHIQI (IHQ)-
supported gold nanoparticles (Au@IHQ-NQ) can mimic the in-vivo activities of 
esterase and Carbonic Anhydrase (CA) which contains zinc-based metalloenzyme
that can reversibly and efficiently convert CO2 into hydrogen carbonate (HCO3-). 
In carbonic anhydrase, zinc (Zn(II)) ion is coordinated by three histidine group

gold catalyst.

leaving a vacant space for water molecule association. We have already discussed 
that Peptide-Au-NP composite is a very efficient catalyst for ester hydrolysis.
It has been found that Zn(II)-associated peptide-gold nanoparticle conjugates
(Zn(II)-Au@IHQ-NP) show more efficiency towards ester hydrolysis and CO2 
hydration in comparison with un-conjugated peptide variants. The efficiency of 
Au@IHQ-NP remains almost intact (94%) even after five time run (Mikolajczak 
and Koksch 2019). 
5.2 Application of peptide-supported platinum-catalyst 
The peptide (Eosin Y) self-assembled biofilm supported platinum catalyst 
is found (Pan et al. 2015) to show very efficient visible-light-driven photo 
catalysis for the water splitting and CO2 reduction. The rate of reaction is found 
to be enhanced in presence of both visible light as well as peptide-Pt-biofilm 
composite catalyst. The result is not satisfactory if we remove any component 
of the catalyst system. In the visible-light driven photocatalytic water splitting 
and CO2 reduction with water on EY/Pt/Film, the highly conducive biofilm 
allows the transition of the photo-excited electrons from EY to Pt-nanoparticles, 
to supply more photo-induced electrons to participate in the reaction with H2O 
(or CO2 + H2O). This could be the main reason for the significantly improved 
performance of EY/Pt/Film. The Tri-ethanolamine (TEOA) is used as electron 
donor to reduce back EY.
An attractive method (Zhou et al. 2013b) has been seen for the immobilization
of platinum nanoparticle (Pt-NPs) on the surface of aniline-GGAAKLVFF peptide
(AFP) fibrils to form novel amyloid fibril platinum-nanoparticle composites
(Pt-AFP fibrils). The interactions between Pt-NPs and AFP fibrils are totally
electrostatic in nature. The excellent electro catalytic activities of Pt–AFP fibrils 
toward oxygen reduction make it attractive for its applications in batteries, polymer 
electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCS) and other electrodes. Electro-catalytic activity of 
Pt-AFP fibrils and Pt NPs on oxygen reduction was further studied and it was 
seen that the electro catalytic efficiency of Pt-AFP fibrils for oxygen reduction 
is better than Pt-NPs and bulk Pt electrodes. Further scope for metal-AFP fibrils 
can be studied with several nanoparticles (Ru, Pd, Au, CeO2 and others) and bio 
molecules via electrostatic assembly to generate new catalytic behaviors. 
5.3 Application of peptide-supported palladium-catalyst 
Self-assembling peptide template (Coppage et al. 2010, Bedford et al. 2015) can 
be used for the generation of non-spherical Pd-nanostructures. On the basis of 
Pd/peptide ratio, different catalytically reactive inorganic morphologies can be 
developed within the peptide scaffolds using linear nanoribbons, nanoparticles 
and complex nanoparticle networks (NPNs). The catalytic effects of bioinspired 
peptide based system have been discussed on two different reactions e.g. 
4-nitrophenol reduction and Stille C-C coupling. Enhanced reactivity was seen 
for the peptide catalyst with Pd-nanoparticles and NPNs than the nanoribbons 
for all type of reactions (Bhandari and Knecht 2011). 
Peptide-supported Catalyst: Synthesis and Applications 13 
Another type of peptide-supported palladium nano-materials was developed 
(Bedford et al. 2014) using water-soluble hydroxyl-terminated fourth generation 
poly-amidoamine (G4-PAMAM-OH) dendrimers framework covalently attached 
with R5-peptide and palladium nanomaterials. The R5-peptide/dendrimer/Pd￾nano-materials show multiple morphologies which were absent for free peptide 
template. The calculated turn over frequency (TOF) for the hydrogenation of
allyl alcohol was found to be higher for R5-peptide-dendrimer template Pd-nano￾materials in comparison to the catalyst generated using the dendrimer-free R5 
scaffold. After characteristics study, it was observed that R5-peptide/dendrimer/Pd￾nanomaterials have a more porous macrostructure in solution with more catalytic 
surface area of Pd-component in comparison to structure with native R5-template. 
6. Conclusion 
Ongoing research on the peptide-supported noble metal catalysts have shown 
that the peptide can act as excellent template for synthesis of various biocatalysts 
with required criteria by just controlling the metal/peptide ratios, peptide 
sequences and metal precursors. Therefore, the exposed metal surface area and 
the penetration depth of noble metal catalysts can be both tuned. In spite of 
few limitations of peptide-templated approach, the benefits have proven it as 
an effective and novel route for noble catalysts’ syntheses and applications. The 
field could be further explored via association with proteolytic enzyme activity 
which will enhance catalytic activity of noble metal nanoparticles after cleavage 
from peptides and new research directions may be opened up for the exploration 
of these opportunities.

1. Introduction 
Most of the useful chemical reactions are not easy to carry out because of the 
unavailability of the reactants towards each other. The addition of a solvent that 
has both water-like and organic-like properties, such as ethanol, which derives 
its hydrophilic nature from its hydroxyl group and its lipophilicity from the ethyl 
group, traditionally solves the crucial complexity of bringing a water soluble 
nucleophilic reagent and an organic, water insoluble electrophilic reagent 
together to carry out the required chemical reaction (Wang and Weng 1988). 
Now-a-days, phase transfer catalysis (PTC) is recognized in organic chemistry 
as a flexible and significant synthetic approach. In both liquid-liquid and solid￾liquid systems, phase transfer catalysis (PTC) allows interactions between 
reagents in two immiscible phases by using catalytic quantities of phase transfer

18 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
agents that enhance interphase transfer of species (Jensen et al. 2002). Many 
reviews on phase transfer catalysts (PTCs) as synthetic methods have also been 
published before (Brändström 1977, Dehmlow and Fastabend 1993, Gokel and 
Weber 1978, Starks et al. 1994, Freedman 1986). PTCs come in a variety of 
forms, including quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts, crown ethers, 
cryptands and others. The quaternary ammonium salts are among the most 
frequently used PTCs in the market since they are the cheapest of all (Wang 
2019). Although phase transfer catalysts (PTCs) are widely used in the industry, 
polymer-supported (PS) phase transfer catalysts, commonly referred as triphase 
catalysts, have not yet attracted extensive industrial recognition (Fiamegos and 
Stalikas 2005). 
The reaction between benzyl chloride and sodium bromide is previously 
studied by using two different phase transfer catalysts. One was water soluble 
phase transfer catalyst i.e. tetrabutylammonium bromide (QBr), which is slightly 
soluble in toluene also, hence the reaction system is two-phase (liquid-liquid), 
and another was a polymer-supported phase transfer catalyst, which was prepared 
by immobilizing tributylamine in chloromethyl polystyrene (Wang and Weng 
1988). The reaction was carried out in triphase mixtures of organic liquid, solid 
or aqueous inorganic salt; and solid catalyst, hence the reaction system is three￾phase (triphase). The authors have concluded that the rate of the reaction is higher 
in the latter case than that of the former one (when the same milliequivalents 
of quaternary ammonium ions are used) due to lower activation energy of the 
triphase system than that of the two-phase system. Triphase catalysis has been 
introduced as an immobilized phase transfer catalysis, where a polymer is the 
most suitable support for immobilizing the phase transfer catalysts (Marken et 
al. 2019). The method of triphase catalysis was initially introduced by Regen 
(Regen 1975). Initially, crown ether catalysts and polymer-bound quaternary 
onium ions in triphase were reported independently in the literature (Regen 
1975, Brown and Jenkins 1976, Cinouini et al. 1976). Polymer-supported (PS) 
phase transfer catalysts are heterogeneous types of catalysts which are insoluble 
in nature. They have covalently bound functional groups (FGs) which are active 
as catalysts for reactions between anions and neutral organic substrates. The 
active functional groups include quaternary ammonium or phosphonium ions, 
cryptands, crown ethers, grafted poly(ethylene glycols), analogues of dipolar 
aprotic solvents etc. (Srivastava et al. 2020). The two most often utilised polymer￾supports are poly(ethylene glycol) and the copolymer of polystyrene crosslinked 
with divinylbenzene (Lemanowicz et al. 2021). The 1% and 2% cross-linked 
polystyrenes have been used as supports for various catalysts in different organic 
reactions. Osada and Chiba (1979) used quaternized poly(4-vinylpyridine)
gels as catalysts in aspirin hydrolysis; Yamazaki et al. (1980) used quaternary 
ammonium ion substituted polystyrene gels as catalysts for decarboxylation of 
6-nitrobenzisoxazole-3-carboxylate anion in aqueous buffer solutions. Organic
or organometallic functional groups exhibiting higher specificity and lower
temperature stability are typically used as active sites in polymer-supported

catalysts. In the design of catalysts for specific reaction processes, the plethora 
of polymers and functionalization methods available provide controlled swelling 
properties, balanced hydrophilic/lipophilic ratio and the pore structure of the 
support (Zhao et al. 2019). The synthesis of alpha-amino esters, esterification
reactions, amidation reactions, polymerisation reactions and other organic 
chemical reactions use polymer-supported (PS) phase transfer catalysts as 
intermediates (Kaur et al. 2011, Thierry et al. 2001). Classical soluble phase￾transfer catalysts offer many disadvantages when compared with the analogous 
insoluble catalysts, which involve slow reaction rates, difficulty in separating
the catalyst from the reaction mixture, etc. (Mąkosza and Fedoryński 2020).
Soluble phase transfer catalysts like quaternary ammonium and phosphonium 
salts possess modest surfactant properties, which can cause emulsions resulting 
in difficulty for isolation of the product from organic phase (Polarz et al. 2018). 
Using insoluble polymer-supported (PS) phase-transfer catalysts, usually known as 
triphase catalysts, is a solution to all the problems related to the classical soluble 
phase transfer catalysts. Triphase catalysts can be easily removed from the reaction 
mixture by filtration or centrifugation (Yang et al. 2019). The lipophilicity of the 
triphase catalyst facilitates transport of the organic phase into the catalyst, thereby 
increasing the reaction rate (Nakade et al. 2020). Polymer-supported phase transfer 
catalysts offer an appealing method of reusing the catalyst after the reaction. Even
though they are more expensive than classical soluble phase-transfer catalysts, the 
recovery of the catalyst by its extensive recycling makes it available for continuous 
industrial phase transfer catalysis (Katole and Yadav 2019). This chapter presents 
the synthesis of polymer-supported phase transfer catalysts, their multifarious 
applications as intermediates in various organic chemical reactions, their reaction 
mechanisms, reactivity, selectivity and characterizations. 
1.1 Principle of phase transfer catalysis (PTC) 
Reuben and Sjoberg (1981) discussed the principle of phase transfer catalysis 
(PTC) (Reuben and Sjoberg 1981). The basis of PTC is the ability of specific 
“phase-transfer agents” or “phase transfer catalysts” to make it easier for one 
reagent to move from one phase into an opposite (immiscible) phase where 
the other reagent is present. Thus, the reagents that were initially in various 
stages and were not previously in close proximity to one another are combined 
to enable the reaction. However, for the phase transfer catalytic action to be 
efficient, it is also necessary that the transferred species be in an active state and 
that it be regenerated during the organic process (Brändström 1977). 
1.2 General mechanism 
The mechanism of PTC reaction was initially proposed by Starks and Halper 
(Starks and Halper 2012). He illustrated the complete mechanism by taking a 
classic example of a nucleophilic substitution reaction between 1-chlorooctane 
(R-X; R=C8H17) and aqueous sodium cyanide (M-Y). No desired product was  
 
 
 
 
20 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
obtained without the use of a catalyst irrespective of refluxing this two-phase 
mixture with vigorous stirring for 1 or 2 days. Although if 1% (w/v) of a 
quaternary ammonium salt (C6H13)4N+Cl–; Q+X) is added to the reaction system, 
the desired product, 1-cyanooctane (R-Y), was obtained with 100% selectivity 
and 100% conversion in 2-3 hrs. 
The author marked the following plausible mechanism for the above reaction: 
1. A quaternary ammonium salt (Q+X–), dissolved in the aqueous phase, 
transfers cyanide ion into the organic phase (Q+ Y–). 
2. In the organic phase, the cyanide ion (Y–) being quite nucleophilic 
undergoes a nucleophilic substitution reaction with 1-chlorooctane (R￾X; R=C8H17) forming the desired product (R-Y). 
3. The catalyst subsequently returns to the aqueous phase by transferring 
displaced chloride ion (X–) back to the aqueous phase (Q+X–) and the 
cycle continues. 
Due to its lipophilic nature, the ion-pair formed (Q+ Y-
) can cross the liquid￾liquid/solid-liquid interface and diffuses into the organic phase - this is the
“phase-transfer” step (Scheme 1a). 
2. Synthesis of polymer-supported phase 
transfer catalysts 
2.1 Synthesis of methyltributylammonium chloride catalyst 
The triphase catalyst, methyltributylammonium chloride, was prepared (Desikan 
and Doraiswamy 2000). In a 200 ml round-bottom flask, 50 ml of toluene was 
taken, then 5 g of chloromethylated polystyrene precursor, having 4.3 mmol of 
chlorine per gram of solid, was added to the flask. After purging the reaction 
mixture with nitrogen for 5 minutes, 40.13 g of 0.216 mol tributylamine was 
added into the flask and with the help of a magnetic stirrer, continuously stirred. 
The reaction mixture was left undisturbed for 36 hours at 90 °C (Scheme 1b). 
It was vacuum-filtered before being washed with toluene and then water, thrice. 
Using a soxhlet continuous extractor and refluxing toluene, the filtered solids 
were extracted. After extraction, solids were filtered to eliminate excessive 
toluene. The sample was dried for 24 hours at 90 °C under vacuum. 
2.1.1 Characterization 
Characterization is one of the important pieces of evidence that clearly indicates 
the surface morphology of the polymer matrix where the reaction occurs. 
Optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron spectroscopy 
for chemical analysis (ESCA), secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), ion 
scattering spectroscopy (ISS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), electron probe 
microanalyzer (EPMA), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and electron

paramagnetic resonance (EPR) are the several characterization techniques used 
for the analysis of the heterogeneous catalysts (Chou and Weng 1990). 
BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) analysis was used to measure the surface area 
of the polymer precursor with the nitrogen adsorption method. The catalyst support 
was found to have a very low surface area (0.40 m2
/g approx.), which indicates its 
nonporous nature. Volhard titration method and energy dissipation spectroscopy 
(EDS) were used for chloride analysis and elemental analysis of the polymer￾supported phase transfer catalyst, respectively (Desikan and Doraiswamy 2000). 
2.2 Synthesis of polyethylene-g-quaternary ammonium salt 
(PE-g-Q +
N ) 
A polymer-supported (PS) phase transfer catalyst, polyethylene-g-quaternary 
ammonium salt (PE-g-QN
+), was prepared through a three-step graft 
copolymerization (Kaur et al. 2011) (Scheme 2) through the following steps: 
1. In the first step, maleic anhydride (MAn), in 5 ml of acetone, was reacted 
with 100 mg polyethylene (PE), which was already suspended in 10 ml  
 
 
22 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
of xylene, by photochemical method using 1% benzophenone (Bz) as 
photosensitizer. Excess methanol was added to the reaction mixture and the 
product, polyethylene-g-maleic anhydride (PE-g-MAn), was filtered, washed 
with water and dried. 
2. Acid hydrolysis of polyethylene-g-maleic anhydride (PE-g-MAn) was carried 
out by refluxing the mixture of 0.100 g PE-g-MAn (Resin I) with water 
(20 ml) and concentrated H2SO4 (0.5 ml) for 4 hours. The product, PE-g￾succinic acid (Resin II), was filtered, then washed with water, and dried 
finally.
3. Resin II on further refluxing with 0.200 g of tetrabutylammonium bromide 
(TBAB) and 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF), upto the boiling temperature of 
THF, under basic conditions to obtain PE-g-QN
+ (Resin III). 
Scheme 2. Synthesis of polyethylene-g-quaternary ammonium salt (PE-g-QN+) 
The structural analysis for the polymer-supported phase transfer catalyst 
(Resin III) was done by using spectroscopic and conductometric techniques. The 
FTIR spectrum of PE-g-QN
+ (Figure 1) shows a characteristic peak of ammonium 
salt at 2367.1 cm-1. The characteristic bands at 1628.9 cm-1 and 1378.5 cm-1

are observed due to COO-

The similar IR spectral pattern during the synthesis of quaternary salt (Sarkar 
et al. 2021). 
Conductance measurements were made on the shedlosky conductance cell 
and conductivity bridge to confirm the ionic nature of quaternary salt, Resin III. 
The specific conductance of the aqueous solution of PE-g-QN
+ was observed at 
47×10-6 ohm-1, which was higher than that of PE-g-MAn (Resin I) i.e. 37×10-6 
ohm-1 indicating the ionic nature of the former one. 
3. Organic reactions 
On the polymer surface or within the polymer matrix, chemical reactions occur. 
More lightly cross-linked polystyrenes were developed as support in peptide 
synthesis (Erickson 1976, Merrifield 1963) and synthesis of polynucleotides 
(Letsinger and Kornet 1963), following the introduction of ion exchange 
resins based on polystyrene. These polymers expand and contract more than 
ordinary ion exchange resins, which are typically packed into columns for water 
treatment, even with just 1% or 2% divinylbenzene. Although more fragile, 
compressible, and difficult to filter than commercial ion exchange resins, the 
more swollen gels with increased solvent concentration have shown outstanding 
yields in peptide synthesis on a small scale. The lightly cross-linked polymers, 
as supports for general organic synthesis (Akelah and Sherrington 1981, Fréchet 
1981, Sherrington 2001) and for immobilized “homogeneous” transition metal 
catalysts (Kaneko and Tsuchida 1981, Ciardelli et al. 1982, Whitehurst 1980), 
were used in earlier times. Various organic reactions were carried out using 
polymer-supported phase transfer catalysts. Few of them are discussed below. 
3.1 Polymerization reaction 
+ There are various polymerization reactions obtained with PE-g-QN as a 
polymer-supported phase transfer catalyst reported in literature (Kaur et al. 
2011, Vajjiravel and Umapathy 2008). Different monomers like styrene, methyl 
methacrylate, acrylonitrile etc. are polymerized by refluxing them with the 
suitable amount of the catalyst under mild acidic condition to obtain polymers 
polystyrene (PS), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(acrylonitrile) 
(PAN). The residue obtained is treated with suitable solvent depending upon the 
polymer obtained; for instance, benzene was used for PS, acetone for PMMA 
and dimethyl formamide for PAN. 
3.2 Amidation reaction 
Amidation reaction of ethyl bromide was carried out by refluxing its suitable 
amount with the catalyst at boiling temperature of benzene under basic 
conditions (Kaur et al. 2011). The reaction mixture was filtered and the residue 
was washed with ethanol. The organic phase of the filtrate was separated and 1. Sodium hydroxide, in aqueous phase, undergoes mass transfer and 
intraparticle diffusion in the presence of the catalyst. 
2. Exchange of OH- with Cl- takes place at the active sites of the catalyst. 
3. Generation of organic anion, PhC(CH3)2OO- during mass transfer and 
intraparticle diffusion of cumyl hydroperoxide (PhC(CH3)2OOH).
4. Mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion of 1-bromobutane from the 
organic phase to the active sites of the catalyst. 
5. Organic ion, PhC(CH ) - 3 2OO and 1-bromobutane are now in close 
proximity and easily undergo chemical reaction at the active sites. 
6. Diffusion of the product obtained, PhC(CH3)2OOC4H9, into the organic 
phase. 
Reactivity of polymer-supported phase transfer catalysts 
Earlier, it was assumed that due to external and intraparticle diffusion resistances, 
the heterogeneous catalysts as compared to homogeneous catalyst were likely to 
show a lower reactivity (Ford and Tomoi 1984). But, literature provides a number 
of references where the scenario is totally opposite. Supported polyethylene 
24 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
the solution obtained was decanted and evaporated to give a crystalline solid 
product, N-ethyl benzamide. 
3.3 Esterification reaction 
A solution of sodium benzoate in water was refluxed with an appropriate amount 
of the catalyst, PE-g-QN
+, and a benzene solution of ethyl bromide (Kaur et 
al. 2011). The reaction mixture was cooled at rt. (room temperature), diluted 
with water and filtered to separate out the polymer-support. After separating the 
organic layer, it was washed with water and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The 
organic layer was decanted off and evaporated to give the product, that is, ethyl 
benzoate with a fruity smell. 
3.4 Synthesis of dialkyl peroxides 
Dialkyl peroxides are widely used as initiators of free radical reactions, cross￾linking agents or bleaching and oxidizing agents (Van Deurzen et al. 1997). The 
authors investigated the synthesis of dialkyl peroxides from alkyl hydroperoxides 
and alkyl bromides with the help of polymer-supported phase-transfer catalysts. 
In his work, Cumyl hydroperoxide was made to react with 1-bromobutane 
(Scheme 3) in the presence of aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (Baj 
et al. 2006). 
Scheme 3. Synthesis of dialkyl peroxide using polymer-supported PTC 
This process involves the following six steps as shown in scheme 4. Polymer‐supported Phase Transfer Catalyst 25 
Scheme 4. Proposed mechanism in the synthesis of dialkyl peroxide using polymer￾supported PTC. Q+ = quaternary onium cation 
glycols (PEG) and crown ethers have been shown to have higher reactivity 
than soluble ones (MacKenzie and Sherrington 1981, Regen and Nigam 1978, 
Kimura and Regen 1983, Hradil and Švec 1984). 
An esterification reaction between benzyl chloride in the organic phase and 
sodium acetate in the aqueous phase to form benzyl acetate was chosen as the 
model reaction (Desikan and Doraiswamy 2000). The reaction was preceded by 
“phase transfer catalysis” where different types of phase transfer catalysts were 
used to carry out the reaction. Different concentrations of polymer-supported
catalysts were used. A comparative study was done by taking their soluble 
correspondents of equal concentration. 
When 0.1 mol of benzyl chloride is reacted with 1 mol of sodium acetate 
by using 2 mmol of polymer-supported methyltributylammonium chloride at 
the agitation rate of 700 rpm, it has been found that a polymer bound phase 
transfer catalyst is actually more reactive than its soluble correspondents (Figure 
2). Desikan and Doraiswamy (2000) explained this rate enhancement very well 
in their work. The lipophilicity of the catalyst is increased by introducing the 
polymer-support to the catalyst, which results in the easier passage of the organic 
phase into the active sites of the catalyst, hence the reaction rate is increased. 
Now, the support is not at all inert as in the case of many other heterogeneous 
catalysts. This approach clearly concludes that the manipulations in the support 
system can result in the maximum conversions for a given reaction system. 
In another case, where the reaction conditions were same but this time 
polymer-supported phosphonium catalyst and its soluble analogous (2 mmol) 
were used, in this case also the rate enhancement effect due to the polymer-bound
catalyst is indeed significant (Figure 3).
In both the cases studied, the enhancement of the reactivity of the reaction 
is due to the polymer backbone, which is used as a support to the phase transfer 26 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Figure 2. Comparison between soluble and polymer-supported ammonium catalysts 
(equal concentration of 2 mmol Eq. of catalysts was used) (Desikan and Doraiswamy 
2000)

(equal concentration of 2 mmol Eq. of catalysts was used) (Desikan and Doraiswamy

catalyst. This was again proven by comparing the effects of soluble and polymer￾supported catalysts with silica-supported tributylmethylammonium chloride 
(1 mmol) during the same chemical reaction at the same reaction condition. Figure 
4 clearly shows that the silica-supported catalyst has lower reactivity than the 
soluble catalyst. This is again due to the increased lipophilicity of the polymer 
backbone, which is not the case of silica as a support to the catalyst. This is 
known as the “polymer effect”.
The reduction of external mass transfer effects of catalysts can also enhance 
the rate of some reactions. This is famously known as “microphase effect 
of the catalyst” (Mehra 1990). In his studies, reaction was carried out with 
chloromethylated polymer-support but without the phase transfer catalyst on 
it. It resulted in the same reaction rate as that in the case of a baseline reaction 
(where no catalyst was used), clearly indicating that there is no microphase effect
without the catalyst. 
Figure 4. Comparison between soluble, polymer-supported, and silica-supported 
methyltributylammonium chloride catalysts (equal concentration of 1 mmol Eq. of 
catalysts was used) (Desikan and Doriswamy 2000) 
4. Conclusion 
The triphase reactions involve three phases as a reaction system, viz. organic 
liquid, aqueous salt solution, and solid polymer-supported catalyst. Hence, 
the catalyst is named as a “triphase catalyst” although, with other traditional 
heterogeneous catalysts, the experimental reactivity of some chemical reactions is 
generally retarded due to mass transfer and intra particle diffusional restrictions. 28 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
However, the polymer-supported phase transfer catalysts are remarkably 
showing a trend of increased reactivity when they are compared with their 
soluble analogous. Polymer-supported quaternary ammonium and phosphonium 
catalysts are the examples that have been discussed within the chapter. They are 
successful to overcome such restriction by the lipophilic nature of the polymer 
backbone, with vigorous stirring. The use of lightly cross-linked polymer￾supports enhance the particle durability. The polymer-supported catalyst has 
reduced activation energy compared to the soluble form and to the baseline 
reaction where no catalyst is used. Polymer-supported phase-transfer catalysts 
are active in the synthesis of various chemical precursors like dialkyl peroxides, 
polystyrene, poly (acrylonitrile), alpha-amino acids, etc. Triphase catalysts 
are easy to separate from the reaction mixture. Without a significant loss of 
activity, they can be reused many times after the regeneration from the reaction 
mixture. The advantages of polymer-supported catalysts create the perception 
of using them for future manufacturing demands and needs of laboratories and 
research industries.

1. Introduction 
Polymers with catalytically active moieties are called polymer supported 
organic catalysts. Synthetic polymers like polystyrene, poly (ethylene glycol), 
polyethylene, polyisobutylene (PIB), polyester, alkylated polystyrene, etc. 
typically have an organic catalytic moiety connected to the side chain. Organic 
catalysts supported by polymers are utilised as catalysts in a variety of organic 
synthesis processes. Due to their insolubility, cross-linked polymers are 
frequently used as polymer support material. It is simple to remove insoluble 
polymer catalysts from the reaction mixture and recycle them. The polymer’s 
main chain has some organic catalysts inserted into it. Catalysts are typically 
needed in chemical reactions with green chemical processes in order to speed 
up the reactions under mild reaction conditions. When the reaction is finished, 
the catalysts must be removed from the reaction mixture. We can only hope 
that they are retrieved, renewed, and used again. However, the majority of the 
catalysts are difficult to recycle. It is straightforward to remove the cross-linked 
polymer catalyst from the reaction mixture when an organic molecule with 
catalytic activity is immobilized to it. Precipitation methods can also be used

to separate supports made of linear polymers. The use of polymer catalysts can 
lessen the toxicity and the odour because polymers are not volatile. Polymer 
catalysts are used in a wide variety of organic synthesis processes (Ding and 
Uozumi 2008, Itsuno et al. 2011, Shinichi et al. 2008, Yang and Bergbreiter 
2013). To demonstrate great selectivity and specificity, several organometallic 
complexes, for instance, have been utilized as catalysts for a variety of chemical 
processes. 
The polymer immobilisation approach is a crucial alternative since it is 
typically challenging to retrieve these complicated catalysts. Organic polymers 
like polystyrene, poly (ethylene glycol), polyethylene, etc. are used as polymer 
supports for the organic catalysts in order to use these catalysts in organic solvents. 
To limit the use of hazardous chemical solvents, however, using water as a solvent 
is equally crucial in greener organic synthesis (Chiwara et al. 2009, Hashiguchi 
et al. 1995, Terhalle et al. 1997). In several chemical reactions involved in the 
production of organic compounds, polymeric reagents have proven helpful. Easy 
setup, reuse of the supported reagent after regeneration, and sterile reaction 
conditions are a few benefits of polymer supported reagents (Arakawa et al.
2006, Haraguchi et al. 2010a, Li et al. 2004). The literature on using polymer￾bound organic and organometallic reagents in organic synthesis is covered in this 
chapter. In the last ten years, both polymer-supported chemistry and synthesis 
have experienced enormous progress. Recently, the ability to recycle the catalyst 
has received a lot of attention in the field of polymer supported organometallic 
and organic reagents, which is crucial from the perspective of green chemistry. 
A review of recent advancements in the use of organometallic and organic 
reagents supported by polymers in organic synthesis is given, with a particular 
emphasis on the process for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The traditional Suzuki, 
Sonogashira, and Heck couplings, as well as aryl amination, epoxide opening, 
rearrangements, metathesis, and cyclopropanation, are a few examples of the 
reactions addressed. Also explored are applications in the area of asymmetric
synthesis (Ley et al. 2000, Clapham et al. 2001, Bergbreiter et al. 2002, Leadbeater 
et al. 2002). 
2. Polymer-supported organic catalysts for 
various reactions 
Numerous significant organic reagents and catalysts have been created during 
the past few decades to meet the demands of synthetic chemists for reagents and 
catalysts for bond formation, functional group transformation, and the creation 
of complex organic frameworks. 
Therefore, research on the recovery and repurposing of these organocatalysts/ 
reagents has received a lot of attention. Despite the fact that many organocatalysts 
are air- and moisture-stable, column chromatography is frequently required to 
separate these catalysts from the end products. Since immobilisation can more 
effectively separate catalysts and can be used as a way to reuse these catalysts,  
Achiral Polymer-supported Organic Reagents 33 
which are frequently used at relatively high mol percent loadings, immobilisation 
of organocatalysts on polymer supports to facilitate recovery and reuse of these 
catalysts is a desirable strategy. Numerous recent papers describing separable 
insoluble polymer-supported organocatalysts have been published as a result of 
the potential economic and green chemical benefits of this method. Selective

3.1 Co catalyst attached to a dendronized polystyrene 
support (Salen) 
According to Weck and colleagues, a (salen) Co catalyst connected to a 
dendronized polystyrene support has proven successful in achieving kinetic 
resolution of epoxides by hydrolysis. Three units of the cobalt-salen catalyst can 
be attached to the dendron linker, improving cooperative contacts and raising 
the local catalyst concentration, enabling the use of a far lower catalytic loading 34 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
than was previously possible with a catalyst supported by a polymer for this 
process (Scheme 1) (Goyal et al. 2008). Depending on the epoxide’s substitution 
pattern, pre-activating the catalyst by oxidising Co(II) to Co(III) in the presence 
of air and acetic acid produced basically enantiomerically pure epoxide with 
yields between 40-47% (the maximum theoretical yield was 50%). 
Scheme 1. Epoxides are resolved hydrolytically and kinetically with a (salen)-cobalt 
catalyst supported by a polymer 
3.2 Amberlite IRA-400 supported phenoxide and 
naphthoxide anions 
Phenoxide and naphthoxide anions are readily produced on the IRA-400 supported 
by amberlite. These very air stable polymer supported reagents are employed 
for regioselective ring opening reactions of various epoxides to produce aryl 
ether alcohols in large quantities under accommodating reaction conditions. The 
reaction of Amberlite IRA-400 (Cl2 form) with an aqueous sodium salt of various 
substituted phenols or naphthols produced the Amberlite IRA-400 phenoxide or 
naphthoxide anion resin quickly and easily. These polymer-supported counterparts 
to conventional phenoxides or naphthoxides are highly air stable and can be 
stored for months without any oxidation. Ordinary phenoxides or naphthoxides 
are air sensitive and should be made only prior to their usage. The regioselective 
ring opening of several epoxides was accomplished using anions supported by 
polymers. Investigated were the effects of the solvent and polymer’s molar 
ratio on the ring opening process of epoxides. The reactions were conducted 
in ethanol, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, and benzene. The outcomes of the 
experiment demonstrated that ethanol was the best solvent. It was discovered 
that a 3.1 molar ratio between the polymer-supported phenoxide or naphthoxide Achiral Polymer-supported Organic Reagents 35 
and the epoxide worked best. The regenerated polymeric reagents can be used 
again without losing any of their reactivity. Additionally, it is equally simple 
to employ polymer-supported phenoxides bearing electron-withdrawing groups 
(Table 1). The results for opening the rings of various substituted epoxides using 
phenoxide and naphthoxide ions supported by polymers are displayed in Tables 
1 and 2. The benefits of using these air stable polymer-supported phenoxides 
or naphthoxides for the ring opening of epoxides over other methods described 
in the literature include nonaqueous and neutral reaction conditions, no catalyst 
used, easy reaction set-up, and the regeneration and reuse of the polymeric 
reagent (Akelah and Sherrington 1981, Akelah and Moet 1990, Tamami et al. 
1993, Tamami and Mahdavi 2001, Tamami and Mahdavi 2002, Chen et al. 1995) 
(Figure 2). 
3.3 Polystyrene-supported catalysts 
The widespread use of phase-transfer catalysis in organic synthesis has significantly 
aided in the development of organic catalysts as practical preparative materials. 
It has also been reported (Regen 1975, 1976, 1977, 1979, Margaret et al. 1980, 
Nishikubo et al. 1990) to immobilise quaternary ammonium salts on polystyrene 
cross-linked with 2% divinylbenzene (DVB) and to employ a polymer-supported 
catalyst to catalyse the nucleophilic ring opening of dioxiranes (Scheme 2). 
Scheme 2. Reaction catalyzed by insoluble polymer-supported phase-transfer catalysts 
(Regen et al. 1975) 
3.4 Ruthenium (III) complex was anchored to a polymer￾bound bis(2-picolyl)amine 
Kim and Lee have demonstrated assisted ruthenium catalysis for ring opening 
of epoxides. Both aromatic and aliphatic epoxides were reacted with either 
methanol or water using a ruthenium (III) complex that was tethered to a 
polymer-bound bis(2-picolyl)amine ligand with nearly full conversion (Scheme 
3). Styrene reacted quickly (1 h), whereas other epoxides took a little longer 
(2.5-35 h), and 1,2-epoxy-hexane required 200 h to completely convert. With 
no loss of catalytic activity, the polymer-bound catalyst may be recycled up to 
ten times. Although significant leaching was noted in the case of hydrolysis, the 
same kinds of reactions could also be carried out with a supported iron catalyst 
(Lee et al. 2007). Table 1. Epoxides reacting in ethanol using Amberlite IRA-400 supported X-C

4. Application of polymer-supported organic catalysts 
in formation of cyclic product 
4.1 Cycloaddition of an imine to N-phenylmaleimide 
In the past, Carretero and colleagues created a family of ferrocenes that could 
be employed as ligands in metal-catalyzed asymmetric transformations by 
substituting them with tert-butylsulfide and other phosphines (Priego et al. 2002). 
In order to permit attachment to Wang resin and Merrifield resin, one of these, 
the so-called Fesulphos ligand, was subsequently given two alternative handles 
and used in the copper-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides 
(Scheme 4) (Martin et al. 2007) 
It was discovered that copper coordination to the polymer-bound ligands 
was slower than the equivalent preparation in solution, taking an hour as 
opposed to a few seconds. The cycloaddition reaction of different imines with 38 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts

Scheme 4. In the copper-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an imine to 
N-phenylmaleimide, Fesulphos ligands attached to polymers are used 
N-phenylmaleimide and methyl fumarate, on the other hand, produced the 
cyclized products in high yield and with outstanding enantioselectivity thanks 
to the polymer-supported catalyst synthesized from ligand 1. Surprisingly, the 
same excellent stereoselectivity was achieved using Fesulphos ligand 2 linked to 
a Wang resin via a spacer, but the yields were reduced (Hein et al. 2010). 
4.2 Copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition 
Due to its ease of usage and high yields, the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne 
cycloaddition (also known as CuAAC) to produce triazole compounds is a 
popular technique for joining two molecules. Chan and Fokin have created a 
click-reaction-produced tristriazole ligand that stabilises Cu (I) and acts as a 
catalyst for CuAAC-type reactions. The ligand was attached to a NovaSynr 
TG amino resin (a polystyrene-polyethylene glycol support) to reduce copper 
contamination of the product, and it was tested in the click reaction between 
phenyl acetylene and benzyl azide (Scheme 5). By washing the resin-tethered 
ligand with a copper salt solution, copper (I) was preloaded onto it. When 
utilising a variety of solvents, the click reaction produced yield that was 
practically quantitative. The polymer-bound ligand could be recycled up to ten 
times with only a slight reduction in efficiency, and there was barely any copper 
leaching (Chan et al. 2004, 2007). 
4.3 Multi-Step organic synthesis 
In the presence of magnesium sulphate or molecular sieves, the readily 
accessible aldehyde 1 was treated with methyl hydrazine at room temperature to  
40 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Scheme 5. A copper-tris(triazolyl) complex supported by a polymer serves as a catalyst 
for the cycloaddition of an azide to an alkyne 
produce the hydrazone 2. The polymer-supported base BEMP (PS BEMP) was 
used to N-alkylate the compound 2 with a small excess of ethyl bromoacetate. 
Excellent yields were obtained, and any unreacted bromoester was removed 
with aminomethyl polystyrene (Hill et al. 1998, Ley et al. 1999a, 2000, Dale et 
al. 2000, Ryan et al. 1999). Trisamine that is supported by a polymer could also 
be employed for the sequestering process without affecting the achievable yields 
or purity. Then, using an ion exchange cyanide resin in a modified Strecker 
process, it was possible to convert 3 to 4. Two equivalents of the resin at reflux 
in ethanol containing a catalytic quantity of acetic acid were necessary for the 
ideal circumstances. With no unreacted starting material 36 found by either LC￾MS or 1H NMR, this reaction proved to be exceptionally efficient, producing 
solely the required hydrazine product, nitrile 4. For the oxidation of chemical 4 
to the matching hydrazone 5, many processes were looked into. 
Despite mostly producing the desired product, the polymer-supported 
pyridinium bromide perbromide also produced a number of unidentified by￾products that could not be eliminated by traditional sequestering methods. 
When compared to other “clean” oxidation methods, using Pd/C/cyclopentene 
or manganese dioxide produced only the oxidation product, though not in a fully 
converted state. However, treatment of the mixture with an isocyanate resin 
supported by a polymer made it easier to remove the unreacted starting material 
4 and produce a pure solution of 5. It was discovered that the phosphazene base 
PS-BEMP is appropriate for the quick deprotonation and concurrent cyclization 
of 5 to the tetra-substituted pyrazole 6. The ester 6 was then converted to the 
necessary amide 7 by dissolving it in a saturated solution of ammonia in methanol. 
Initial detection of two products - the amide 7 and the methyl ester produced by Achiral Polymer-supported Organic Reagents 41 
the transesterification of 6 - led to their identification. This substance underwent 
multiple transformations before becoming amide 7 (Kim et al. 1996, Pop et al. 
1997, Tronchet et al. 1993, Ian et al. 2000) (Scheme 6). 
4.4 Fixation of carbon dioxide in the form of a cyclic 
carbonate 
Jiang et al. reported on an intriguing derivatization of propargylic alcohols using 
supercritical carbon dioxide on a solid substrate (Jiang et al. 2008). They did this 
by using copper(I) iodide bonded to a dimethylamino-polystyrene resin to create 
alkylidene cyclic carbonates. The reaction was shown to have an optimal CO2-
pressure range of 14-18 MPa, resulting in a variety of cyclized compounds being 
produced in good yields. No product was produced when the substrate 2-phenyl￾3-butyn-2-ol or primary or internal alkynes were utilised in the reaction; the 
reaction was restricted to terminal secondary propargylic alcohols with aliphatic 
substitutents. An article by Cai and colleagues that demonstrates how copper 
(II) coordinated to a polymerbound proline can catalyse the cross-coupling 
of oximes with arylboronic acids in respectable yields should also be briefly 
mentioned (Wang et al. 2010) (Scheme 7).

4.5 Dichlorocyclopropane synthesis 
Numerous preparative uses for insoluble phase-transfer polystyrene-supported 
ammonium and phosphonium salts have been documented, including the synthesis 
of dichlorocyclopropane from substituted alkenes (Scheme 8). (Margaret et al. 
1980, Nishikubo et al. 1990).

4.6 Stereoselective reactions catalyzed by Cinchona 
alkaloid-derived polymer-supported catalysts 
Colonna and colleagues found that the epoxide product of the darzens reaction 
between 4-methylphenyl chloromethyl sulfone and 2-butanone (equation-1, 
Scheme 9) occurred at a maximum ee of 23% when it was conducted at room 
temperature in a two-phase system of acetonitrile and 50% aqueous sodium 
hydroxide. The more rigid structure of cinchona alkaloids, whose capacity 
to catalyse a range of activities had already been discovered at the time, was 
sought after for improvement in stereoselectivity. It’s intriguing how the alkaloid 
skeleton provides various locations for polymer attachment. Kobayashi and Iwai 
chose the more often used bridge-head nitrogen for the immobilisation of quinine 
by quaternization with regular and modified DVB cross-linked polystyrene. As 
a result, catalysts 2 (Y = Cl) and (Y = Br) (Figure-4) were made and used as 
catalysts (0.2 mol equiv) in the Weitz-Scheffer epoxidation of chalcone (Scheme Achiral Polymer-supported Organic Reagents 43

peroxide and toluene. Extremely low ee (up to 4%) were seen, with catalyst 3 
working better than catalyst 2. The catalyst 4 was employed in the cycloaddition 
of phenyl ketene with the N-tosylimine of ethyl glyoxalate to produce 
1-p-tolylsulfonyl-3-phenyl-4-carbethoxy â-lactam (Scheme 9, equation-3). The 
product, which is a 93:7 mixture of cis and trans-azetidinones, was produced 
with a 62% yield (Colonna et al. 1978, Kacprzak and Gawronski 2001, Hodge 
et al. 1983). The predominant diastereoisomer has a % ee. 44 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
4.7 New soluble-polymer bound ruthenium carbene catalysts 
and application in ring-closing metathesis 
Since this strategy should make it easier to both recycle the catalyst and purify 
the produced product, polymer supported catalysis has recently attracted more 
attention. A few synthetic and recycling investigations on ruthenium precatalysts 
supported by polymers have been published for this purpose. 
On a manual synthesizer, the reactions were carried out in parallel by reacting 
multiple diene systems 1a-f in CH2Cl2 in the presence of 5 mol% of catalysts 
3a or 3b (Scheme 10). The reaction mixture was then transferred to ether for 
precipitation and filtration after it had finished. After the filtrate was evaporated 
and the little quantity of Ru that had leached into the vessel was removed, column 
chromatography produced the cyclic products 2a-f in excellent yields (Table 3). 
Catalyst 3b was active enough to ensure cyclization of a substrate containing

4.8 Cyclization of Triketone 
(S)-Prolinamide was linked to polystyrene using a sulfonamide linkage to create 
2, which acted as a catalyst for the asymmetric cyclization of triketone 1 to 
create 3 and 4 (Scheme 12) (Pedrosa et al. 2013).  
46 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Scheme 12. Asymmetric cyclization of triketone
5. Hydrogenation reactions using 
polymer-immobilized catalyst 
5.1 Asymmetric hydrogenation of acetophenone 
One example of the most effective catalysts is the asymmetric hydrogenation 
catalysts created for ketone reduction, complexes generated from chiral 1, 
2-diamines, and RuCl2/diphosphines. For the asymmetric hydrogenation, a 
number of polymer catalysts that include the chiral Ru complex have been 
developed and employed. As chiral polymeric ligands of Ru catalyst, chiral 
1,2-diamines immobilised on polystyrene (PSt) and ones immobilised on PEG 
are both successfully employed. The polymer catalysts and their application in 
the enantioselective hydrogenation of acetophenone 1 are shown in (Scheme 13). 
In the asymmetric hydrogenation of aromatic ketones, the chiral Ru complex 
made from 3, XylBINAP ((S)-(-)-2,20-bis[di(3,5-xylyl) phosphino]-1,10-
binaphthyl) and RuCl2 has good catalytic activity. Numerous recycling cycles of 
these polymer catalysts are possible without losing any of their catalytic activity 
(Chiwara et al. 2009). 
Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, which is a promising catalytic
approach for the synthesis of chiral alcohols and amines, is a notable method of 
asymmetric reduction without hydrogen gas. TsDPEN transition metal complexes 
(TsDPEN14 p-toluenesulfonyl 1,2-diphenylethylenediamine), created by Noyori 
and Ikariya (Hashiguchi et al. 1995), are one of the potent asymmetric catalysts 
for the enantioselective reduction of carbonyl and imine compounds under the 
transfer hydrogenation reaction condition. The first instance of immobilising
monosulfonylated 1,2-diphenylethylenediamine into cross-linked polystyrene was 
described by Lemaire et al. (Ter et al. 1997) 
Lemaire’s cross-linked polymer catalyst has decreased catalytic activity 
with 84% ee in the enantioselective reduction of acetophenone. 94% of ee is 
produced by the comparable original low-molecular-weight catalyst in solution 
system. When quaternary ammonium sulfonate structure is added to cross-linked Achiral Polymer-supported Organic Reagents 47 
Scheme 13. Asymmetric hydrogenation of acetophenone with polymer-immobilized 
chiral diamine-Ru complex 
polystyrene, significant improvement is seen. By terpolymerizing 4, 5, and 6, the 
polymeric chiral ligand 3 is easily created (Scheme 14). 
In the reduction of acetophenone, the polymer catalyst containing quaternary 
ammonium sulfonate provides a quantitative conversion with a % ee (Arakawa 
et al. 2006). This illustration demonstrates the significance of changing the
structure of support polymers in order to increase the catalytic activity and 
stereoselectivity of polymer catalysts. Utilizing microspheres as a support polymer 
for the polymeric catalyst is another intriguing strategy. High catalyst loading 
is achievable since the microspheres’ surface area is rather large. Precipitation 
polymerization is used to create polymer microspheres that are functionalized 
with chiral TsDPEN ligand (Haraguchi et al. 2010b). 
Precipitation polymerization is successfully used to create monodisperse, 
cross-linked poly (divinylbenzene) and poly(methacrylic acid-co-ethylene glycol 
dimethacrylate) microspheres with (R,R)-TsDPEN moiety. By altering the order 
in which the matching monomers are added, the site of the introduction of the 
(R, R)-TsDPEN moiety into polymer microspheres can be controlled. Other 
polymer supports, such as PEG (Li et al. 2004b), PE (Xiao et al. 2012), and silica
(El-Shehawy and Itsuno 2005), are utilised in addition to polystyrene (Itsuno 
et al. 2013).

a hydrophobic polymer-supported N-toluenesulfonyl-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine 48 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Scheme 14. Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone in water using
polymer-immobilized catalyst 
(TsDPEN) ruthenium catalyst has been described by Haraguchi, Itsuno, and 
colleagues (Haraguchi et al. 2009). The polymer was made hydrophilic by adding 
pendant quaternary ammonium sulphate groups to the polymer backbone, allowing 
for the hydrogenation of ketones like acetophenone in water (Scheme 15). The 
level of cross-linking was also looked at; however, it was discovered to be less 
significant as even using a highly cross-linked polymer (20% DVB) as the catalyst
support resulted in a high yield of product (Arakawa et al. 2008a).
Chiral alcohol synthesis can be accomplished easily and safely using the 
catalytic ATH of ketones. For transfer hydrogenation, a variety of chiral catalysts 
based on complexes of Ti, Ru, Rh, and Ir have been created. The compound 
of Ru(II) and optically active N1-p-toluenesulfonyl-1,2-diphenylethylene-1,2-
diamine (TsDPEN) created by the research team of Ikariya and Noyori is now 
the most notable among them [6]. The complex was immobilised on a variety 
of supports, including silica, sulfonated polystyrene (Arakawa et al. 2008), PEG 
(Li et al. 2004b) and polystyrene copolymers that include phosphonates. These Achiral Polymer-supported Organic Reagents 49 
Scheme 15. Utilizing complexes of 1,2-diamine monosulfonamide and ruthenium, chiral

catalytic complexes that were immobilised worked well in watery media. Narrowly 
dispersed polymer microspheres 3 were created by precipitation polymerizing 
styrene, the crosslinking agent, and the TsDPEN monomer. For the reduction of

Scheme 16. Enantioselective reduction of ketone to form chiral alcohol 50 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
microspheres demonstrated stronger catalytic activity than other microsphere 
catalysts (Liu et al. 2013, 2004, Xu et al. 2013).
It has become possible to create synthetic-amino amides 3, which are 
produced from actual amino acids. In a high yield and with enantioselectivity of 
95%, their chiral Zn(II) complexes catalysed the enantioselective addition reaction 
between ZnEt2 and aldehyde 1 to form chiral secondary alcohol 2 (Scheme 17) 
(Escorihuela et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2014). 
Scheme 17. Enantioselective addition reaction between ZnEt2 and aldehyde 
1 to form chiral secondary alcohol 
On a polymethacrylate support, borane reduction of ketone was carried out 
under the catalysis of chiral oxazaborolidine. On crosslinked polymethacrylate, 
4-hydroxy,-diphenyl-(S)-prolinol was immobilised. The asymmetric borane 
reduction of ketones, such as the reaction of 1 to create 2, was carried out using 
the polymeric chiral amino alcohol 3 (Scheme 18). (Itsuno et al. 1998, Thvedt et 
al. 2011) obtained high catalytic activity and enantioselectivities. 
Scheme 18. Asymmetric borane reduction of ketones
5.2 Asymmetric hydrogenation of α-amide ketone 
The asymmetric hydrogenation under dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) 
conditions is another intriguing application of polymeric catalyst containing 
chiral 1,2-diamine ligand. A-(N-benzoyl-N-methylamino) propiophenone 1 is Achiral Polymer-supported Organic Reagents 51 
asymmetrically hydrogenated through DKR utilising the polymer catalyst made 
from polymer 3, (R)-BINAP, and RuCl2 to generate syn-b-amide alcohol 2 
solely with nearly complete enantioselectivity (Scheme 19). In a homogenous 
solution system, the polymer catalyst exhibits better stereoselectivity than the 
corresponding low-molecular-weight catalyst. This example demonstrates how 
the stereoselective performance of the catalyst is significantly influenced by 
the microenvironment produced in the polymer network. The hydroxyethyl 
methacrylate unit and methacrylate cross-linkage in polymer 3 offer the catalytic 
moiety a favourable micro environment (Kocienski et al. 1978). 
Scheme 19. Asymmetric hydrogenation of α-amide ketone
5.3 Haloform reaction of benzaldehyde 
The haloform reaction of benzaldehyde (Scheme 20) was carried out in the 
presence of 0.05 mol equiv of compound 3 in acetonitrile/50% aqueous sodium 
hydroxide two phase system at room temperature with good chemical yields and 
distinct steroeselectivity. The more rigid structure of Cinchona alkaloids, whose 
capacity to catalyse a range of activities had already been discovered at the time, 
was sought after for improvement in stereoselectivity. The alkaloid skeleton, it 
turns out, provides a variety of locations for polymer attachment (Stefane et al. 
2014). 
5.4 Asymmetric hydrogenation of keto ester 
BINAP 3 was produced by copolymerizing divinylbenzene with a chiral BINAP
monomer. In the asymmetric hydrogenation of the keto ester 1 to produce the 
-hydroxyester 2 with strong enantioselectivity and quantitative conversion 
(Scheme 21), the Ru complex of 3 demonstrated good catalytic activity (Du et 
al. 2014, Sun et al. 2012). 52 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts

Scheme 21. Asymmetric hydrogenation of keto ester
5.5 Asymmetric hydrogenation of imines 
A polymeric chiral monosulfonamide ruthenium complex was used for the 
ATH of cyclic sulfonimine 1. The ATH reaction in the organic solvent CH2Cl2 
performed best on polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene. But because 
of its great hydrophobicity, the polystyrene-based support did not react with 
the aqueous system. The facilitation of this reaction in water depends on the 
quaternary ammonium pendant group. Therefore, 95% ee was achieved for 
the conversion of 1 to 2 in water by employing the polymeric chiral ligand 3 
(Scheme 22) (Sugie et al. 2014). 
6. Application of polymer-supported organic 
catalyst in aldol reactions 
6.1 Aldol reactions between cyclic ketone and aryl aldehyde 
Quite efficient organocatalysts for a number of asymmetric reactions include 
proline and its derivatives. Proline derivatives immobilised on polymers have Achiral Polymer-supported Organic Reagents 53

been created and are effective catalysts for the asymmetric processes listed 
below. The anchoring of (S)-proline moieties on block copolymers 4 made of 
thermoresponsive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) and PEG-grafted polyacrylate 
blocks were recently described by Suzuki et al. Then, in aqueous solution, 12 
aldol reactions between ketone 1 and aryl aldehyde 2 were carried out. With a 
high yield and high diastereo- and enantioselectivity (96% ee) (Scheme 23), the 
aldol product 3 was produced (Suzuki et al. 2013). 
Scheme 23. Aldol reactions between ketone and aryl aldehyde54 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
6.2 Aldol reactions between acetone and aryl aldehyde 
A polymer was linked to a (S)-proline functionalized chiral amide alcohol to 
produce 4, which served as a catalyst for the asymmetric aldol reaction of 1 and 
2 to produce 3 (Heidlindemann et al. 2014) (Scheme 24). 
Scheme 24. As a catalyst for the asymmetric aldol reaction, a polymer was joined to a 
(S)-proline functionalized chiral amide alcohol 
6.3 Asymmetric aldol reaction of aldehyde and acetone 
A prolinamide structure was attached to a crosslinked polymer using an ester 
linkage and the hydroxy group of hydroxyl proline. In the asymmetric direct 
aldol synthesis of aldehyde 1 and acetone 2, the resultant polymeric prolinamide 
alcohol 4 was utilized as a catalyst to produce 3 (Scheme 25) (Rulli et al. 2013).

6.4 Asymmetric aldol reaction between cyclohexanone 
and aromatic aldehyde 
The asymmetric aldol reaction between cyclohexanone and aromatic 
aldehyde in water was successfully driven by (S)-proline moieties attached 
to a thermoresponsive polymer nanoreactor with outstanding yields and 
enantioselectivities. An azide-acetylene click reaction was used to join a 
crosslinked polymer to a (S)-proline structure. In a flow system (Scheme 26), the 
resultant polymeric proline 4 was utilized as a catalyst in the asymmetric aldol 
reaction between aromatic aldehydes 1 and 2 to generate 3 (Ayats et al. 2012).

6.5 Aldol reaction with high diastereoselectivity 
The direct aldol reaction of 1 and 2 was catalysed by polymer-immobilized 
prolinamide 4 to produce the aldol addition product 3 in an excellent yield and 
with strong diastereoselectivity (Scheme 27) (Qu et al. 2014). 
Scheme 27. Polymer-immobilized prolinamide catalyst was used as 
a direct aldol reaction 56 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
6.6 Stereoselective aldol reaction of aromatic 
aldehyde with ketone 
Other amino acids, besides proline and its derivatives, have been employed 
as chiral organocatalysts. L-threonine, whose hydroxy group facilitated its 
attachment to the polymer side chain, is one recent example. When aromatic 
aldehyde 1 reacts with ketone 2 to generate 3, the resulting polymeric L-threonine 
4 works as an easily recyclable, highly reactive, and stereoselective (up to 99% 
ee) catalyst (Scheme 28) (Henseler et al. 2014). 
Scheme 28. Stereo selective aldol reaction of aromatic aldehyde with ketone 
6.7 Aldol reaction of p-nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone 
Prolinamide pendant group-containing substituted polyacetylenes 4 were 
created. In order to produce the chiral aldol adduct 3 in an 80% yield with an 
80%t efficiency (Scheme 29), the prolinamide moiety of the polymer catalysed 
the asymmetric aldol reaction of p-nitrobenzaldehyde 1 and cyclohexanone 2 
(Zhang et al. 2012). 
Scheme 29. Asymmetric aldol reaction of p-nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone
6.8 Aldol and Michael addition reaction 
Wennemers et al. announced the development of the most reactive peptidic 
organocatalysts for the Aldol and Michael addition processes. In order to Achiral Polymer-supported Organic Reagents 57 
synthesise 3 in a continuous flow procedure with >99% yield and 80% efficiency 
from p-nitrobenzaldehyde 1 and aliphatic ketone 2 (Scheme 30), Wennemers’ 
tripeptide 4 was polymer-immobilized (Otvos et al. 2012, Itsuno et al. 2014).

1. Introduction 
Plants are the most important source of traditional medicine system that has 
alleviated human ailment and endorsed health for thousands of years (Ishtiyak 
and Hussain 2017, Sadia et al. 2018). Plants are a reservoir of an array of 
active constituents that have considerable medicinal applications like antiviral, 
anticancer, analgesic, antitubercular etc. (Rupani and Chavez 2018, Uniyal et al. 
2006). Among all of them, the alkaloids are significant secondary metabolites that 
were primarily discovered and applied as early as 4000 years ago and are well 
accepted for their rich medicinal potential as they have potential to harm, heal 
and relieve. The pain relieving alkaloids are morphine and cocaine, and alkaloids 
that can strain health care systems are nicotines (Amirkia and Heinrich 2014). 
A plethora of alkaloids which illustrate medicinal applications are paclitaxel, 
vincristine, the cephalosporins, the penicillins, atropine, pilocarpine, quinine, 
vincamine, etc. Alkaloids are known as biologically significant metabolites and 
necessary for life as they are highly effective, and restricted in their mode of 
action and application. Now it is recognized that alkaloids are ubiquitous in 
the biome, including plants and a variety of microorganisms, also isolated from 
amphibians (Dey et al. 2020). 
1.1 Background 
The first alkaloid isolated from opium in crude form, morphine, was reported 
by Serturner in 1805; it remains an important medicinal agent (Devereaux et 
al. 2018). A few years thereafter, the essential antimalarial agent quinine was 
obtained (Kaufman and Ruveda 2005). Alkaloids originated from the word

Alkaloid-supported Catalysts 65 
alkali. The term “alkaloids” was coined in 1819 by German pharmacist Wilhelm 
Meissner (Croteau et al. 2000). According to him, “alkaloids (which mean alkali￾like, alk-alkali, oid-like) were defined as basic nitrogen compounds isolated 
from plants.” In 1880, Konigs introduced that alkaloids should be defined as 
naturally occurring organic bases which contain a pyridine ring as shown in 
Figure 1 (Chatwal 2019). 
Figure 1. Alkaloid containing pyridine ring 
A broad definition of alkaloid is a class of naturally occurring compounds with
a basic character: containing one nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring structure, 
which is frequently found in plant kingdom (Dey et al. 2020). When alkaloids react 
with acid, nitrogen atoms behave as a base and form the salts like the inorganic 
alkalis in an acid-base reaction. Alkaloids in pure form are usually colourless, 
odourless crystalline solids, but sometimes they can be yellowish liquids. Quite 
often, they also have a bitter taste. 3000 alkaloids are known in more than 4000 
plant species (Debnath et al. 2018). 
1.2 Classification of alkaloids 
The conventional definition of alkaloids gives emphasis to their bitter taste, 
basic nature, origin from plant, and their physiological actions (Eguchi et al. 
2019). The current definition states that the basic nitrogenous plant products are 
mostly optically active and possess nitrogen heterocycle as their structural units 
with a pronounced physiological action. Since the amino acid skeleton is mainly 
retained in the alkaloid structure, alkaloids originating from the same amino acid 
show similar structural features (Kaur and Arora 2015). The presence of a basic 
nitrogen atom at any position in the molecule, which does not contain nitrogen 
in an amide or peptide bond, is the most important constraint for categorization 
as an alkaloid. In this connection, alkaloids can be classified according to their 
chemical structure; for example, alkaloids that contain an indole ring system 
are known as indole alkaloids. The major classes of alkaloids are the tropanes, 
pyrrolidines, purines, indoles, quinolines, isoquinolines, imidazole, steroids, and 
terpenoids (Figure 2) (Roy 2017). Based on their biological system, alkaloids 
are also classified based on the biological system in which they are found, like 
opium alkaloids occur in the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) (Devereaux et 
al. 2018, Debnath et al. 2018).  
66 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Figure 2. The major class of alkaloids 
Often alkaloids are classified based on their biosynthetic origins in the three 
central classes: (1) true, (2) protoalkaloids and (3) pseudoalkaloids (Eguchi et al. 
2019). The “true alkaloids” contain the nitrogen content in the heterocycle ring 
and originate from the amino acids like nicotine, cocaine, quinine, morphine, and 
atropine (Figure 3). True alkaloids are biologically active and extremely reactive 
in nature (Dewick 2002, Funayama and Cordell 2015). They form water-soluble 
salts, and are generally crystalline in nature, which conjugate with acid and form 
Figure 3. Few examples of true alkaloids  
 
Alkaloid-supported Catalysts 67 
a salt. Majority of true alkaloids are bitter in taste and solid, excluding nicotine, 
which is a brown liquid. This group also contains a few alkaloids that, besides 
nitrogen heterocycle, contain peptide fragments like ergotamine or terpene (e.g. 
evonine). The piperidine alkaloids coniceine and coniine can be considered as the 
true alkaloids, even though they are not originated from the amino acids. These 
alkaloids are found in plants: (a) in free-state, (b) as N-oxide, or (c) as salts. 
Various amino acids like L-phenylalanine/L-tyrosine, L-ornithine, L-histidine, 
L-lysine are the key sources of true alkaloids (Chatwal 2019, Eguchi et al. 2019, 
Dewick 2002, Funayama and Cordell 2015). 
The protoalkaloids are other nitrogen-containing alkaloids, derived from 
amino acids, peptide and cyclopeptide alkaloids or polyamine alkaloids but are not 
part of the heterocyclic ring system. For example, L-Tryptophan and L-tyrosine 
are the main precursors of this type of alkaloids. This class of alkaloids is applied 
in a variety of health disorders, including mental illness, pain, and neuralgia. 
(Funayama and Cordell 2014, 2015). 
The last group of alkaloid-like substances is compounds that include steroid, 
purine and terpene-like structures as well as capsaicin, ephedrine and caffeine. 
(Cordell 1981, Aniszewski 2015). Another class of alkaloids which is known 
as Pseudoalkaloids, not directly originated from amino acids; instead, they are 
connected with amino acid pathways where they are derived from by amination 
or transamination reaction, from forerunners or post-cursors of amino acid 
(Cappillino and Sattely 2014). 
1.3 Pharmacological applications of alkaloids 
Alkaloids were foundational in the development of organic chemistry and 
were among the first pharmaceuticals developed. They remain in a privileged 
position in present medicine, used extensively to treat pain, cancer, dementia and 
innumerable other ailments (Figure 4) (Aniszewski 2015). 
Plant alkaloids are one of the principal groups of natural products. Despite 
the recent advances in the field of synthetic drug discovery in recent decades, 
plant alkaloids have stayed a feasible source of bioactive compounds with 
significant medicinal potential (Bribi 2018). More than 12,000 alkaloids are
isolated from a variety of plant species. Many of these compounds possess rich 
therapeutic aspects. For example, the substantiated plant alkaloids include the 
narcotic analgesics, morphine and codeine, apomorphine (morphine derivative) 
used in Parkinson’s disease, the muscle relaxant papaverine, and have various 
antimicrobial activities (Kartsev 2004). The bark of homonym trees cultivated in 
equatorial climatic zones has more than 30 alkaloids, generally known as Cinchona 
alkaloids. Approximately 50% of alkaloids are represented by quinine, quinidine, 
cinchonidine and cinchonine (Hiemstra and Wynberg 1981). Quinine is the most 
well-known alkaloid and was used as the anti-malarial drug of choice for over 400 
years until chloroquine was discovered, while quinidine is employed as an anti￾arrhythmic agent. In chemistry, quinine, quinidine, cinchonidine and cinchonine 68 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Figure 4. Examples of pharmaceutical alkaloids with their therapeutic uses 
are used as economical chiral source. Many naturally occurring and synthesized 
alkaloids illustrated the enormous applications in the field of medicine, organic 
reactions and are well recognized as supported catalysts. Here in this chapter, we 
will explore the catalysts supported by alkaloids in organic reactions. 
2. Alkaloids in organic reactions 
Pasteur in 1853 firmly recognized the role of cinchona alkaloids in organic 
chemistry which ushered in an era of racemate resolutions by the crystallization 
of diastereomeric salts (Flack 2009). Organic catalysts supported by alkaloids 
are utilized as catalysts in a variety of organic synthesis reaction. Due to their 
insolubility, alkaloids are frequently used as a catalyst (Lichman 2021). Cinchona 
alkaloids and their derivatives, once known for the popular antimalarial drug, 
emerged as versatile organocatalysts in reactions as they activate the nucleophile 
by enamine and carbanion formation, and electrophile is activated via hydrogen 
bond. This can be also attributed to the plenty of Cinchona alkaloids in nature, 
their commercial availability at reasonable prices, nontoxicity, stability and 
effortless handling in laboratory, and their convenient modification by simple 
reactions (Kartsev 2004, Bribi 2018). Alkaloid-supported Catalysts 69 
2.1 Cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives: Versatile 
catalysts in asymmetric synthesis 
Remarkable progress in the area of asymmetric organocatalysis has been 
achieved in the last decades. Cinchona alkaloids are influential organocatalysts 
in the realm of asymmetric organocatalysis during the last 2 decades (Pellisier 
2007). Owing to high enantioselectivity and the presence of tunable functional 
groups, cinchona alkaloids are able to catalyze a broad range of reactions 
(Tanriver et al. 2016). The compounds of Cinchona are quinine (QN), quinidine 
(QD), cinchonidine (CD) and cinchonine (CN), shown in Figure 5 (Kacprzak 
and Gawronski 2001). 
As we can notice from the above Figure 5, the Cinchona skeleton consists of 
two rigid rings: an aliphatic quinuclidine and an aromatic quinoline ring joined 
together by two carbon-carbon single bonds. These compounds are diastereomers 
and having five stereogenic centers and a quinuclidine ring, bearing a tertiary and
chiral nitrogen atom. The chiral quinuclidinyl nitrogen is the most central feature 
of these compounds as it is responsible for the direct transfer of chirality during 
catalytic reactions (Marcelli and Hiemstra 2010). Furthermore, the quinuclidinyl 
nitrogen atom is 103 times more basic in comparison to quinoline nitrogen and 
is thus responsible for the basic character of the catalyst. Moreover, OH group 
present at C-9 position acts as Bronsted acid and several studies have shown 
that Cinchona compounds work as bifunctional catalysts as shown in Figure 6. 
Figure 5. Compounds of Cinchona alkaloids 
Figure 6. Bifunctional organocatalysts (both nucleophile and electrophile activation by 
basic quinine and quinidine)  
 
 
70 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
The acid and base coexist in these molecules, and thus, it is possible to activate 
both the nucleophile and the electrophile simultaneously to use as bifunctional 
organocatalysts (Yeboah et al. 2011, Kacprzak and Gawronski 2001, Marcelli 
and Hiemstra 2010). 
The Cinchona alkaloids occur in pairs, which differ in configurations at C8, 
C9, and N1 positions. For example, Quinine vs quinidine and cinchonidine vs 
cinchonine have opposite absolute configuration, which means that very often
these pairs of diastereomers act as enantiomers at C-9 position (Stegbauer 2012, 
Duan 2014). The eight major Cinchona alkaloids (Figure 7) are diastereomers, 
usually referred to as pseudoenantiomers, because they propose enantiomeric 
products when used as catalysts. The H-bonding groups, such as the hydroxyl 
group, urea, and thiourea at the C-9 position, activate the electrophile by hydrogen 
bonding. The relative orientation of the two rings, quinoline and quinuclidine, 
is responsible to create a “chiral pocket” around the reactive site, which further 
forces a specific approach of the substrates and also formation of enantioselective
product. When employed in diverse types of enantioselective syntheses by 
asymmetric catalysis, the yield, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity of 
products are determined by structural features of Cinchona alkaloids and their 
derivatives (Kacprzak and Gawro 2001, Salvadori et al. 1999). 
Figure 7. Structures of eight major Cinchona alkaloids 
2.1.1 Alkaloid-supported catalysts on cinchonidine and cinchonine 
The platinum catalyst modified by cinchonine (CN) or cinchonidine (CD) is the 
most widely studied system among the heterogeneous enantioselective catalysts, Alkaloid-supported Catalysts 71 
and has been applied to industrial processes on moderately large scales (Orito 
et al. 1979 a & b, Borszeky et al. 1997). Following the hydrogenation of ethyl 
benzoylformate, the product was obtained in quantitative yield with optical 
purities up to 80% (see Scheme 1). One notable property of the Orito reaction 
is that two chiral modifiers, CD and CN, are diastereomers of each other (Orito 
et al. 1979a & b, Borszeky et al. 1997). 
Scheme 1. The Orito reaction; enantioselective hydrogenation of ketone 
over CD- or CN-modified Pd
2.1.2 Aliphatic α,β-unsubstituted carboxylic Acids 
Huck et al. (1996) began to publish results for the enantioselective hydrogenation 
of aliphatic α,β-unsubstituted carboxylic acids shortly after the initial report 
by Hall et al. (Hall et al. 1996, Huck et al. 2000). The product ee-value was 
moderately high at 52% by using the CD-modified Pd/Al2O3 in a nonpolar 
solvent such as hexane under high-pressure hydrogen. One notable property 
of the aliphatic substrates, represented by (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid (tiglic 
acid), was formation of the S-product (see Scheme 2). 
Scheme 2. Stereo direction during the hydrogenation of α,β-dialkylpropenoic
2.1.3 Hydrogenation of pyrone derivatives 
The hydrogenation of 2-pyrone derivatives is a special case of the chiral modified 
palladium catalysis, for multiple reasons. The enantioselective hydrogenation 
of 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone over the CD-modified palladium catalyst was 
first reported by Huck and colleagues (Scheme 3) (Hall et al. 1996, Huck et 
al. 2000). The hydrogenation was performed with Pd/TiO2 in a protic solvent 
under atmospheric hydrogen pressure (the same as for the PCA family). The 
highest ee-value in the initial report was up to 85%, but this was obtained at 
only a 2% conversion. Such a low conversion was not due to suppression of the  
72 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
overreaction; rather, the main reason was the very slow hydrogenation of the 
substrate. Hydrogenation with the CD-modified Pd/TiO2 catalyst was 25-fold 
slower than the corresponding reaction with the unmodified Pd/TiO2.

CD-modified Pd/TiO2 and succeeding diastereoselective hydrogenation
Georg Breding studied the decarboxylation reaction in the presence of 
chiral alkaloids, such as nicotine or quinidine. The first asymmetric C–C bond 
forming reaction is accredited also to Georg Breding (Breding 1912). This 
milestone achievement was related to Rosenthaler’s work, who was able to 
prepare mandelonitrile by the addition of HCN to benzaldehyde in the presence 
of an isolated enzyme, emulsin (Rosentahler 1908). Breding was also able to 
perform this reaction in the presence of alkaloids as catalysts, such as the pseudo 
enantiomeric quinine and quinidine (Breding and Fiske 1912) (See Scheme 4). 
The determination of enantioselectivity was hampered by a lack of methods to 
Scheme 4. Preparation of Mandelonitrile by the addition of HCN to benzaldehyde 
using quinine and quinidine Alkaloid-supported Catalysts 73 
achieve not only efficient purification but also consistent analyses. Therefore, the 
presence of a chiral impurity, which often occurred from the catalyst, can spoil 
the determination of the correct, optical rotation-based ee-values (Prelog 1954). 
Breding and Fiske reinvestigated the synthesis of asymmetric cyanohydrin 
in the way of the more proficient reaction (Breding and Fiske 1912). Pracejus 
demonstrated that methyl phenyl ketene could be converted to (-)-α-phenyl 
methyl propionate in 74% ee by using O-acetyl quinine as catalyst (Pracejus 
1960) (Scheme 5). 
Scheme 5. Pracejus’ enantioselective ester synthesis from phenyl methyl ketene 
3. Platinum cinchona alkaloid catalyst for 
enantioselective α-ketoester hydrogenation 
However, the many variables associated with the physical and chemical 
properties of supported catalysts make mechanistic elucidation difficult. Catalyst 
modification is a strategy that has been widely applied in heterogeneous 
hydrogenations (Erathodiyil et al. 2011). However, this strategy has been 
successful only in a limited number of reactions due to the high substrate 
specificity of such catalysts, so that only a particular combination of a metal, a 
modifier and a substrate type would give rise to good enantioselectivity (Blaser 
et al. 1997). Metal nanostructures are of particular interest in this case because 
of their high activity under mild conditions which is associated with their large 
surface area, and because of their selectivity for catalytic transformations. Small 
variations in the metal, the modifier and the substrate type can lead to significant 
changes in enantiodiscrimination. 
Enantioselective hydrogenation is one of the most important industrial 
asymmetric processes to produce chiral molecules with excellent selectivity 
(Scheme 6) (Nandanan et al. 2011). 
Platinum nanoparticle catalysts supported on silica, alumina, titania and 
dendritic architectures are mainly used in the hydrogenation of activated 
α-ketoesters (Blaser et al. 1997). Orito and coworkers first reported the 
enantioselettive hydrogenation of α-ketoesters catalysed by a cinchona alkaloid 
modified supported platinum catalyst in 1978 Scheme 7 (Orito et al. 1979). 
Since then, the extensive research by Wells (Webb et al. 1992), Blaser (Blaser 
et al. 1991), Bradley (Bradley et al. 1987) and their co-workers has established 
the optimal reaction conditions and suggested a reaction mechanism. Platinum

Scheme 7. Hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate using Orito’s catalysts 
catalysts modified with cinchona alkaloids for the hydrogenation of activated
ketones have demonstrated ligand acceleration as a heterogeneous catalyst system 
(Erathodiyil et al. 2011). Modification of the platinum surface by naturally
occurring cinchona alkaloids not only affects the product enantioselectivity,
cinchonidine gives the (R)-product, whilst cinchonine, its pseudo enantiomer, 
furnishes the (S)-product (Schemes 8), but it also enhances the reaction rate by 
up to one hundred times over the racemic reaction (Collier et al. 1995, Arx et al. 
Schemes 8. Here catalyst is conventional unmodified supported platinum catalyst 
Alkaloid-supported Catalysts 75 
2002, Vayner et al. 2004). The reaction is well behaved giving quite respectable 
optical yields, as high as 94% under optimised conditions (Erathodiyil et al. 2011, 
Toukoniitty et al. 2004). 
In the initial studies, Astruc and co-workers (Astruc et al. 2005) focused on 
the racemic hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate. Quantitative conversion to ethyl 
lactate was achieved under a hydrogen pressure of 100 psi in 6 h with 1 mol% 
of nanowire catalyst (Scheme 9). Hydrogenation of other activated ketones also 
proceeded well, producing the corresponding alcohols in quantitative yields. The 
proposed catalytic cycle consisted of a fast adsorption of ketone and hydrogen 
on the Pt surface, stepwise addition of the two adsorbed hydrogen atoms to the 
C–O bond with the half hydrogenated intermediate, followed by the fast desorption
of the alcohol. 
Scheme 9. Hydrogenation of ketoesters 
3.1 Hydrogenation of 2,4-diketo acid derivatives 
Martin et al. (2000) reported the application of a cinchona-modified Pt catalysts 
use in a synthesis of the enantio- and chemoselective hydrogenation of several 
2,4-diketo acid derivatives to the corresponding 2-hydroxy compounds. In 
presence of catalyst the reaction can be carried out with chemoselectivities of 
>99% and enantioselectivities up to 86% (R) and 68% (S), respectively (Martin 
et al. 2000) (see Scheme 10).

3.2 Asymmetric ring-opening of prochiral acid anhydrides 
Jun et al. (1987) reported that the asymmetric ring-opening of prochiral acid 
anhydrides with methanol has been achieved by a catalytic quantity of cinchona 76 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
alkaloids. The product, the optically active half-ester and reaction rate of the ring￾opening selectivity dependent on the nature of the reaction medium, polarity of 
solvent, and substrate concentration (Scheme 11). They obtained enantiomeric 
excess of the reaction up to 70% and the reaction proceeds via general-base 
catalysis by the quinuclidine moiety of the base (Jun et al. 1987). 
Scheme 11. Cyclic acid anhydrides afforded ring-opened half-ester
Origin of enantioselectivity of the cinchona alkaloid modified Pt nanoparticles
has been extensively studied by Ma and co-workers. The surface chemistry and 
interactions between the ligands, Pt nanowires and substrates were critical in 
these reactions and have to be examined in the future (Ma et al. 2005, 2006, 
2007, Konigsmann et al. 2007). Using a similar approach for the hydrogenation 
of ethylbenzoyl formate, the corresponding ethyl mandelates were obtained in 
quantitative conversions and enantioselectivities of 54% to 57% (see Scheme 12). 
Scheme 12. Asymmetric hydrogenation of ethylbenzoyl formate over alkaloid-modified

4. Conjugate addition reactions via cinchona 
alkaloid catalysts 
Recently, cinchona alkaloids have been identified as effective catalysts for the 
enantioselective conjugate addition of dimethyl malonate, ethyl acetoacetate to  
Alkaloid-supported Catalysts 77 
nitroalkenes, and Michael addition between nitromethane, chalcones, thiols and 
various α,β-unsaturated ketones with high yields and enantiomeric excess (Li et 
al. 2004, Ding et al. 2011, Vakulya et al. 2005). 
McDaid and colleagues reported the catalytic asymmetric 1,4-addition of 
thiols to cyclic enones with modified cinchona alkaloid (C-1), which has been 
illustrated in Scheme 13 (Rana et al. 2010, McDaid et al. 2002). The Michael 
products can be isolated with high yield and enantioselectivity for a variety of 
derivatives with selectivities ranging from 93 to >99 % ee. 
Scheme 13. Enantioselective Michael addition of thiophenols to enones 
Later, highly enantio- and diastereoselective tandem Michael-aldol reactions, 
proficiently catalyzed by a 1 mol% cinchona alkaloid thiourea (C-2), were 
reported by Zu and others (Zu et al. 2007). This new one-pot method proceeds 
via synergistic noncovalent hydrogen-bonding activation of both the Michael 
donor and acceptor. The methodology succeeded in the construction of versatile 
chiral thiochromanes with the formation of three stereogenic centers from simple 
achiral compounds as shown in Scheme 14. 
Scheme 14. Reaction of 2-Mercaptobenzaldehyde with α,β-unsaturated oxazolidinone78 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
These results prompted us to examine conjugate additions involving 
trisubstituted carbon nucleophiles, especially those that could be conveniently 
generated in situ from readily available racemic carbonyl compounds. Similarly, 
the conjugate addition has been reported with catalyst C-3 for a direct, stereo 
controlled production of adjacent carbon- or heteroatom-substituted quaternary 
and tertiary stereocenters from readily available starting β-ketoester. Catalyst C-3 
provides excellent enantioselectivities (94 and 95% ee) for both diastereomers 
of the 1,4-adducts (see Scheme 15) (Li et al. 2005). 
Scheme 15. Asymmetric Michael addition reaction 
Chiral oxacyclic structures such as tetrahydrofuran rings are commonly 
found in many bioactive compounds. Cinchona-alkaloid-thiourea C-4 catalyzes 
the cycloetherification of ε-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated ketones with exceptional 
enantioselectivity, even with low catalyst loadings at room temperature. The 
plausible path of the reaction suggest that activation intermediate might go through 
the transition state (TS-1) illustrated in Scheme 16 (Connon 2008). Connon and 
co-workers exhibited a novel asymmetric synthesis method for THF via the 
catalytic cycloetherification of ε-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated ketones supported by 
cinchona-alkaloid-thiourea-based bifunctional organocatalysts. This catalytic 
process represents a highly practical cycloetherification method that provides
excellent enantioselectivities (Asano and Seijiro 2011). 
The catalyst C-4 can also catalyze the domino aza-Michael-Michael reactions 
of anilines with nitroolefin enoates to afford chiral 4-aminobenzopyrans bearing 
two consecutive stereogenic centers and one quaternary stereocenter (Scheme 
17). The products can be isolated with high yield and enantioselectivity (Wang 
et al. 2011). They optimized the reaction with the best results and found that in 
the presence of 2-propanol as solvent and at room temperature in the presence 
of 10 mol% of catalyst, C-4 gives 96% yield with 96% ee. 
Motoba et al. synthesized trifluoromethyl-substituted 2-isoxazolines by using

with a range of (E)-trifluoromethylated enone derivatives in the presence of N-3,5-
bis(trifluoromethyl benzyl) quinidinium bromide catalyst C-5 as a chiral phase

The readily available cinchonidine (C-7) and cinchonine (C-8) can be used 
for the catalysis of the hydroxyalkylation of heteroaromatics and was found 
to be a brilliant catalyst for the hydroxyalkylation reaction. For example, the 
hydroxyalkylation of indoles with ethyl-3,3,3-trifluropyruvate occurs to afford 
corresponding 3-substituted products. The reaction conditions (temperature, 
solvent, cinchona/trifluoropyruvate/indole ratios) were optimized and after 
that, reactivity and selectivity of cinchona derivatives were analyzed. The 
initial reaction rates depicted that the support of cinchona alkaloids as catalysts 
considerably enhanced the rate of reaction. While applying C-7 catalyst, the rate 
of hydroxyalkylation is higher than two orders of magnitude as compared to 
without catalyst and results in higher yield as well as enantioselectivity. In the 
presence of C-8 catalyst, the reaction proceeded with high yields and ee values 
(98% and 90%) as shown in Scheme 20 (Torok et al. 2005). 
4.2 Aldol reaction 
Perera et al. reported the cross-aldol reaction between enolizable aldehydes 
and α-ketophosphonates for the highly enantioselective synthesis of tertiary 
β-formyl-α-hydroxyphosphonates. The process can be accomplished by using 
9-amino-9-deoxy-epi-quinine (C-9) as a catalyst, as shown in Scheme 21. The 
reaction works especially well with acetaldehyde, which is a tough substrate Alkaloid-supported Catalysts 81

enantioselectivity with 96% ee and 67% yield was achieved for both electron￾withdrawing and electron-donating substituents and the end products have 
anticancer activities. 
4.3 Henry reaction 
The Henry reaction or nitroaldol reaction comprises a significant class of 
C–C bond forming reactions that afford easy access to important synthetic 
intermediates from readily accessible nitroalkanes and carbonyl compounds. 
The expansion of highly enantioselective and general catalytic nitroaldol 
reactions with ketones is a demanding yet enviable task in organic synthetic 
chemistry. Hongming and co-workers reported, for the first time, an asymmetric 82 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
nitroaldol reaction with α-ketoesters catalyzed by a new C6’-OH cinchona 
alkaloid (C-10) catalyst. C-10 is an outstanding catalyst to synthesize highly 
enantioenriched products from the reaction of α-ketoesters with nitromethane 
as shown in Scheme 22. The products of Henry reaction could be elaborated to 
aziridines, β-lactams and α-alkylcysteines. This reaction is operationally simple 
and affords high enantioselectivity as well as good to excellent yield for a broad 
range of α-ketoesters (Hongming et al. 2006 a & b, McCooey et al. 2007). This 
reaction is operationally simple and affords high enantioselectivity as well as 
good to excellent yield for a broad range of α-ketoesters.

4.4 Asymmetric Friedel-Crafts reaction 
The high efficiency of bifunctional cinchona alkaloid catalysts in the endorsement 
of mechanistically unrelated C–C bond formations led researchers to assume 
that they might function as efficient catalysts for enantioselective Friedel-Crafts 
reactions of indoles with carbonyl compounds (Wang et al. 2006, Magraner et al. 
2016). To validate this theory, Hongming and co-workers examined the cinchona 
alkaloid-catalyzed reaction of indole with an alkynyl α-ketoester as shown in 
Scheme 23 (Hongming et al. 2006a). Hongming and co-workers illustrated an 
efficient asymmetric Friedel-Crafts reaction that, unprecedently, is applicable to 
a wide range of both indoles and carbonyls. The use of a readily accessible 
catalyst in combination with a high enantioselectivity that is insensitive to 
reaction concentration, temperature, air, and moisture should allow this reaction 
to provide useful enantioselective access to new chiral indole derivatives. Here in Alkaloid-supported Catalysts 83 
Scheme 23, we can see that in Friedel-Crafts addition of Indoles to α-ketoesters, 
a complete reaction is proficient with C-11 catalyst to produce the corresponding 
Friedel-Crafts adduct in 96% yield and 88% ee (Hongming et al. 2006b).

5. Conclusion 
Our extensive studies of alkaloid-supported catalysis have led to the conclusion 
that alkaloid-supported catalysts can catalyze a wide variety of new, highly 
enantioselective, general, and clean reactions. Here in the chapter, we have 
studied various alkaloid and their derivative-supported asymmetric synthetic 
reactions. Bifunctional nature of Cinchona derivatives extends the application 
of alkaloids in vast catalytic reactions. Platinum based Cinchona derivatives 
are also studied in detail, and are used in the organic reactions as a catalyst, 
which provide significant enantioselectivity. In addition, we have explored a 
variety of modified cinchona alkaloids discovered from the Cinchona species 
used in conjugate addition reactions, Michael addition, Aldol reaction, Friedal￾Crafts, and Henry reaction. Cinchona alkaloid chemistry continues to contribute 
to medicinal chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, cross coupling reactions and 
asymmetric synthesis. The whole study opens up the scope of more alkaloid￾supported reaction and enormous use of alkaloids in the field of organocatalysis.

1. Introduction 
The advancement of eco-friendly synthetic procedures and technologies are 
necessary for improving the present state of living of the mankind. There is 
a need to reuse the catalysts for the optimization of resources (Drabina et al. 
2017, Islam et al. 2016, Qi et al. 2010). Binding of homogeneous catalysts 
with the mobile solids helps in procuring the renewable catalysts. Amongst the 
remunerative accessible organic polymers like conducting conjugated polymers 
and copolymers (Khokhar et al. 2021a, 2021b, 2022), cross-linked polymers of 
styrene pertain to the notable competent carriers. Polymer-supported catalyst 
facilitates several benefits such as recyclability, easy to separate, economical and 
their utilization in particular continuous flow processes (Ahadi et al. 2019, Hong 
et al. 2020, Islam et al. 2012, Iwai et al. 2013, Mane et al. 2018, Mikhaylov 
et al. 2016, 2018, Mohammadi and Movassagh 2016, Movassagh et al. 2018, 
Mpungose et al. 2018, Nejati et al. 2018, Roy and Uozumi 2018, Sedghi et al. 
*Corresponding authors: deepalikhokhar003@gmail.com; sjadoun022@gmail.com 90 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
2019), complex organic synthesis (Alza et al. 2011, Clot-Almenara et al. 2016, 
Howard et al. 2019, Islam et al. 2016, Kasaplar et al. 2012, Kazemi et al. 2018, 
Kitanosono et al. 2018, Nasrollahzadeh et al. 2019, Qi et al. 2010, Samuels 
et al. 2016, Whiteoak et al. 2014, Xu et al. 2018, 2010), precursors to natural 
materials (Albukhari et al. 2019, Murugesan et al. 2020), and pharmaceuticals 
(Albukhari et al. 2019, Burange et al. 2022, Li et al. 2019). The significance, 
ambit, and prospect of cross-coupling reactions for twain purposes that is in 
research and industries have seen remarkable interest lately and polymer￾supported catalysts (Nasrollahzadeh et al. 2019) have given them tremendous 
boom, especially the heterogeneous polymer-supported catalysts (Howard et 
al. 2019, Ju et al. 2019, Mohammadi and Movassagh 2018), offering notable 
advantages over homogeneous catalysts whose major limitation is the possibility 
of metal cessation with the end product, which hinders its recovery and reusability 
as a catalyst (Mikhaylov et al. 2018). To overcome these difficulties, a more 
promising solution is the availability of corresponding heterogeneous solid 
supports (Bartáček et al. 2019). The immobilized support has many advantages 
such as the ease of approach, stability, and catalyst recycling potential (Jia et al. 
2019) with continual processing and easy segregation (Mikhaylov et al. 2016). 
Amongst the economically accessible organic polymers, cross-linked polymers 
of styrene pertain to the highly relevant supported catalyst (Alza et al. 2011, 
Bartáček et al. 2020, Clot-Almenara et al. 2016, Islam et al. 2016, Kasaplar et 
al. 2012, Mikhaylov et al. 2016, 2018, Qi et al. 2010, Whiteoak et al. 2014, Xu 
et al. 2010) catalyst with various transition metals’ ions like zinc (Biswas et al. 
2018, 2019, Ghosh et al. 2018, Kim et al. 2018), silver (Jiang et al. 2021, Peng 
et al. 2016), Pd (Ahadi et al. 2019, Ju et al. 2019, Mohammadi and Movassagh 
2016, 2018, Movassagh et al. 2018, Sedghi et al. 2019), Ru (Izgi et al. 2020, 
Şen et al. 2018, 2019, Wang et al. 2020), Cu (Bahsis et al. 2019, Dehbanipour 
et al. 2018, Islam et al. 2016, Kodicherla and Mandapati 2014, Perumgani et al. 
2016, Sun et al. 2013, Yan et al. 2019), and many more helps in catalyzing the 
reaction by promoting bond formation. This book chapter presents multifarious 
applications of polystyrene-supported catalysts in cross-coupling and organic 
synthesis reactions defining their studied recycling potential, stability, selectivity, 
and catalytic activity. 
2. Cross-coupling reactions 
A heterogeneous catalytic system of palladium(II) acyclic diaminocarbene 
complex on polystyrene support was prepared by Mikhaylov and co-workers 
(Mikhaylov et al. 2016) via nucleophilic addition of the amine group of 
polystyrene to the (Pd(II)-ADC) complex. The synthesized catalytic system 
exhibited high and stable catalytic activity in sonogashira as well as Suzuki￾Miyura cross-coupling. PS-supported catalyst is retrievable and recycled many 
times besides notable efficacy loss. The enhanced reaction rate was discerned in 
the Sonogashira reaction with reduced level of palladium leaching and decreased 
catalytic amount (Mikhaylov et al. 2016).  
Polystyrene-supported Catalysts 91 
Based on theophylline, Mohammadi and Movassagh (Mohammadi and 
Movassagh 2016) reported a sustainable catalyst, N-heterocyclic carbine-Pd(II) 
complex (NHC-Pd(II)) immobilized onto polystyrene resin. This catalysis system 
is added in the Suzuki-Miyaura process of Ar-N2
+ BF4
-salts with Ar-(BOH)2 acid 
to biaryl derivative, gave adequate yield with no additives, showed enhanced 
life cycles, and was easily filtered from the reaction blend using the filtration
process, Figure 1.

4-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate with phenylboronic acid.

Iwai et al. (Iwai et al. 2013) synthesized polystyrene-phosphane (PS-Ph3P) 
hybrid, in which styrenes, divinylbenzene, and a tris(p-vinylphenyl)phosphane, 
are covalently attached via radical copolymerization. This hybrid catalyst system 
increased reactivity of reaction forming metal complex with minimum synthetic 
work. Its usage in different heterogeneous applications such as favouring 
Pd-catalysed cross-coupling reactions and Ir-catalysed and Rh-catalysed borylation 
process makes it versatile and attractive for developing more such types 
of catalysis. 
A novel heterogeneous and reusable polystyrene aided [PdCl-(SeCSe)], 
pincer type, complex catalyst was prepared by Mohammadi and co-workers 
(Mohammadi and Movassagh 2018) and the catalytic activity was evaluated. It is 
further used in Sonogashira reaction of 1,2-disubstituted alkynes with 1,3-enynes 
and resulted in high yield percentage of acetylenes and greatly enhanced the rate 
of reaction with high E-Z ratios, as well as readily isolated from reaction blend 
using filtration and reusable for six cycles successively without any substantial 
change in activity. 92 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
The catalysis activity of Pd(II)-N-heterocyclic carbene complex was 
investigated by Movassagh et al. (Movassagh et al. 2018) in the Suzuki-Miyaura 
reaction of arylboronic acid with aroyl chlorides, in the presence K2CO3 and 
acetone-water, to give aryl ketones. The good yield of the end product was 
received in the reaction and found that heterogeneous stimulant can be reusable 
up to 4 cycles with no major variation in its catalytic property and can easily be 
recovered from reaction. 
3. Organic synthesis 
Caballero et al. (Bañón-Caballero et al. 2010) synthesised polystyrene aided 
N-sulfonyl-(Ra)-binam-D-prolinamide, a catalytic system, using thiol-ene 
coupling (TEC) of mercaptomethyl polystyrene and styrylsulfonyl binam 
derivative. In order to study its properties as catalyst, it is then used in direct 
aldol process with benzoic acid in the solvent free conditions to provide high 
yield product and good diastereo-, regio- and enantioselectivity. Easily separable 
by filtration and recyclable 6 times without any substantial change in activity, 
oxidative A3 reaction was employed for the preparation of propargylamines 
with benzyl alcohols by Islam et al. (Islam et al. 2016) in aqueous media using 
prepared polystyrene-supported catalyst of Cu(I). The developed heterogeneous 
stimulated offers enhanced catalytic activity, recyclability, and appreciable 
efficacy. 
Biswas and co-workers (Biswas et al. 2018) explored the catalytic efficiency 
of chloromethylated polystyrene-supported [PS-Zn(II)L] complex in the formation 
process of organic cyclic carbonates, via CO2 fixation under 1 atm pressure and 
at room temperature, in solvent free conditions, from epoxides as well as organic 
carbamates which was synthesized from amines using green agent, dimethyl 
carbonate (DMC). High catalytic efficiency and recyclability up to 5 times was 
observed (Figures 2 and 3). 
Lai et al. (Lai et al. 2018) prepared novel PS supported cis-4-
hydroxydiphenylprolinol and examined its catalytic behaviour by reacting 
N-protected hydroxylamines and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes together and noticed 
that the synthesized catalyst is highly enantioselective, favouring enantioselective 
domino reaction with 83% yield, and reusable up to 10 cycles repeatedly without 
any significant loss in its activity.

Alza et al. (Alza et al. 2011) prepared CuAAC catalyzed diarylprolinol 
silyl ether, with the help of polystyrene as an insoluble supporting catalyst, 
and underwent Michael addition reactions via both enamine and iminium ion 
intermediates. In enamine ion catalysis, linear aldehydes are favoured over 
branched aldehydes. The mediation of dialkyl malonates and nitromethane through 
iminium ions leads to unsaturated aldehydes. The setting of CuAAC catalyzed 
ether on polystyrene provides for high catalytic activity and easy separation by 
simple method of filtration and expanding the reusable cycles.
A copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) of a chiral 
squaramide with the support of polystyrene (PS) was successfully reported 
by Kasaplar and co-workers (Kasaplar et al. 2012). The characteristics of the 
prepared organocatalyst include high catalytic behaviour, and easily filterable
from its reaction mixture. In addition to this, extended recyclability (can be 
reused 10 times) is also observed. In the asymmetric Michael addition reaction 
of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds and β-nitrostyrenes, when added with the organic 
catalyst provides good yield and enantioselectivity. 
Whiteoak and co-workers (Whiteoak et al. 2014) prepared pyrogallol (i.e. 
1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene) based and PS supported catalyst which is active at 
much lower temperatures (45°C) than earlier organocatalyst systems (>100°C) 
for the CO2 transformation and oxiranes into cyclic carbonates. Its reusability 
and regeneration of lost catalytic activity by treating with methyl iodide make it 
more promising and sustainable. 94 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Clot-Almenara et al. (Clot-Almenara et al. 2016) studied the catalytic 
properties of polystyrene aided TRIP catalyst and found high activity and highly 
enantioselective behavior of linear aldehydes. The immobilized organocatalyst 
onto PS resin, when put under rigorous test through 28 h flow experiment, obtained
a high yield of the product without any activity loss. Another characteristic of 
high recyclability makes it an attractive choice. 
PS-benzotriazole-gold (I) complex, prepared by immobilizing gold (I) 
catalyst on supported polystyrene by Cao and co-workers (Cao and Yu 2011), 
exhibited potential catalytic activity for the first time. They tested recyclability 
for three different reaction models, which includes Nazarov reaction of enynyl 
acetate, 1,6-enyne cyclization and the tandem 3,3-rearrangement and third is 
furan rearrangement. 
Samuels and co-workers (Samuels et al. 2016) developed polystyrene resin￾supported diphosphine catalysis by using facile method of processing solid phase 
synthesis with compatible ligand architecture. The yield and activity efficiency 
was tested by making use of the catalyst complex in Rh-catalysed asymmetric 
hydrogenation and observed good to excellent yield quantity and raised catalytic 
activity with selectivity in intermediate range in the process. 
Zuo et al. (Zuo et al. 2014) prepared novel chloromethyl polystyrene based 
catalyst by replacing chlorine atoms partly by sulfonic groups, containing acid 
as well as cellulose sites. High yield and high catalytic activity were observed 
after using catalyst compound in the conversion of microcrystalline cellulose. 
High catalytic behaviour is due to the presence of large amount of chlorine (–Cl) 
groups and sulfonic (–SO3H) groups over the catalyst moiety. 
Xu et al. (Xu et al. 2010) prepared exceptional PS-supported ionic liquid 
catalyst using esterification reaction chains showing augmented recyclability,
thermal stability, and catalytic activity, Figures 4 and 5.

acetate. With permission from Elsevier (Xu et al. 2010) 
An easy, potent and ecological process was explored by Qi et al. (Qi et 
al. 2010) for carboxylation of several aziridines and epoxides providing a high 
transformation rate, selectivity, recyclability, and stability, by employing PS 
supported amino acids acting as rigid activator support. 
4. Conclusion 
This particular subject of polymer-supported catalysts covers a quick advancing 
sphere that encloses fundamentals from almost all arenas of chemistry. 
It adumbrates a term that covers an entire class of synthesis that can be 
assisted with reprocessable catalysts and reusable reagents. Yet all academics 
in this sphere are aiming for exemplary retrievable catalysts having eminent 
performance attributed to reaction rates and their regio-, and stereoselectivity 
apart from leaching, reduction, etc., which can be efficiently restored. These 
immobilized polystyrene supports accord many more appealing and exhilarating 
features such as materialistic and environmental dynamic impulses that are 
functioning in coaction. Altogether, this is appealing and exceptional progress 
in integral chemistry and describes alluring prospects for futuristic investigation 
for developing ideal polystyrene immobilized support for green chemistry. 96 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts

1. Introduction
1.1 Polyacrylic acid 
Every year, millions of polyacrylic acid and its derivative are synthesized with 
other hydrophilic monomers. This type of polymers are widely utilized in 
applications like cleaning detergents, adhesives, sewage treatment, cosmetics, 
and medicine delivery. They are the chemical industry’s polymers (Buchholz 
2012). Polyacrylic acid has a low degradability due to its all-carbon backbone, 
although its widespread use in both practical and fundamental research. There is 
a demand for bio-degradable and bio-compatible polymers in the pharmaceutical 
and bio-medical industries for applications ranging from drug delivery to tissue 
engineering (Swift 1998, Gross 2002). Different type of techniques have been 
investigated to address these issues, including oligomer chain extension, vinyl 
polymerization, and so on (Paik et al. 1996, Gancet 1999, Chiellini 2003). 
These methods, however, are still acrylate-based, with the goal of adding fragile 
spots into the all type of carbon polymer backbone. In spite of these efforts, 
marketable success has been partial, and poly (acrylic acid) remains the industry’s 
preferred polymer. Many scientists have discovered different techniques from 
earlier approaches in that it incorporates a degradable carbonate linkage into 
the polymer backbone, resulting in a structural simulator of poly(acrylic acid),

102 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
namely, poly(acrylic acid) (glyceric acid carbonate). This method is atom￾efficient and delivers a degradation effect at per repeating unit, and yields CO2 
and glyceric acid as nontoxic, safe, and renewable degradation products. 
Figure 1. Structure of polyacrylic acid 
Polyacrylic acid and its derivatives are simple polymers made up of acrylic 
acid, that are unchanging in strong acids and bases. PAA is a frail anionic 
poly-electrolyte that can form composites with non-ionic polymers or with 
oppositely charged polymers. PAA has a gas transition temperature of 106 degrees 
Fahrenheit (Zhou 2008). On the other hand, it is a fluoro polymer-copolymer
based on sulfonated tetra fluoro ethylene that is likewise chemically resistant
(Mauritz 2004). 
1.2 Supported catalyst 
Most common transition metal cation complexes have insoluble supports and 
the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis can be united. 
Polymeric supports are particularly useful due to the different type of functional 
groups that may be produced for binding the catalytic group and the comfort 
with which the reaction products can be separated from the insoluble support. 
In several processes, natural polymers like cellulose, and synthetic compounds 
such as polyacrylic acid have been utilized as catalytic supports. Noble catalysts 
are mostly employed in industry as nanoparticles sustained on silica, zeolite, 
alumina or porous carbon surfaces (Tsonis 1984). Dispersed catalysts can be 
made using a variety of industrial techniques (Campbell 1988). They’ve been 
made in the centers of diblock copolymer micelles (Spatz 1995, Antonietti et al. 
1995, Watson 1999), cores of triblock nanospheres (Underhill 2000), cores of 
dendrimers (Balogh 1998, Zhao 1998, Vassilev 1999), hydrophilic area of diblock 
copolymer films (Ciebien 1998), conditions of homopolymers (Vorontsov 1998) 
or surfaces of polymer microspheres in more fresh academic endeavours (Pathal 
2000). They were made more easily by disperse reducing metal salts in solvent 
with polymer (Hirai 1998, Mayer 1996, Ahmadi et al. 1996). 
2. Polyacrylic acid and its derivatives-supported 
catalyst 
In sustainable chemistry, green catalysis for synthetic procedures and reactions 
is both thrilling and challenging. The development of numerous approaches to Polyacrylic Acid and Its Derivatives-supported Catalyst 103 
improve catalyst efficiency has sparked interest (Chang 2013). Immobilizing 
catalyst is a popular method for reusing catalyst and simplifying the purification 
process (Polshettiwar 2011). Catalyst immobilization on various support materials 
boosts catalyst production while also preventing dangerous catalysts since 
escaping from the environment (Biag 2013). Multiplicities of catalyst-supported 
materials have recently been created for immobilizing catalysts on beads, 
surfaces, and membranes, including polymer supports (Biag 2013, Bradshaw 
2018, Kasaplar 2013, Wu 2013, Strappaveccia 2013, Yang 2013, Hickey 2015), 
ionic liquid supports (Khedkar 2013, Shen 2012), inorganic supports (Zhao 
2011, Arya 2012, Genelot 2012, Wang 2013, Machado 2015, Mittal 2015), 
metal organic frame supports (Genna 2013), and nanocomposite supports 
(Pourjavadi 2015, Wang 2013, Zhu 2012). Magnetic iron oxide nanocomposites 
(Lu 2009) have been the most extensively utilized support material because they 
provide a large surface area with extra binding sites, reducing the drawbacks of 
heterogeneous catalysis (Zhang 2016). 
2.1 Polyacrylic acid and its derivatives-supported 
platinum catalyst 
Platinum (Pt) is one of the most often utilized materials as a catalyst for polymer 
support owing to its brilliant catalytic ability, solidity, and great conductivity. 
Unfortunately, because of the high cost of noble metal, it is difficult to scale up 
manufacturing of the devices. Many scientists and researchers, such as Neo and 
Ouyang in 2013, Li in 2016, Yang and Tang in 2016, are focusing on catalytic 
materials, that have flexible, quasi-solid-state, and solid electrolytes to overcome 
the problems. Shuyang et al. (2008) synthesized Pt nanoparticles, which were 
electroless dumped on grafted multiwall carbon nanotubes made of poly (acrylic 
acid). The thickness and homogeneity of Pt nanoparticles on MWNTs was found 
to be proportional to the density of PAA grafting. Pt on MWNTs showed the 
highest ratio of geranial/nerol, 5.2, which is 3 times higher than that of Pt/active 
carbon (Guo 2008). Wu (2012) used a doping, dedoping–redoping technique 
for doping PANI with PAA and poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS). These groups 
may be more conducive to Pt electro deposition than PANI–CO2H, PAA’s 
group. The activity and stability of the PANI–PSS–Pt electrode toward methanol 
oxidation are superior to those of the PANI/PAA/Pt electrode, according to 
cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric response studies. Kuo (2011, 2012) 
explained the PANI–PAA–Pt composite exhibit considerable improvement of 
electro activity for methanol oxidation. Although CPs are routinely utilized as 
catalyst supports, the precise role of the CP and the comparative influence of the 
dopant in a CP matrix on the development of the composite’s catalytic activity 
is yet unknown. 
2.2 Polyacrylic acid and its derivatives-supported 
rhodium catalyst 
Rhodium is used as catalyst for the hydrogenation of phenol and its nanoparticles  
 
104 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
supported by polyacrylic acid (PAA). An identical catalytic system was previously 
employed in an aqueous-alcoholic solution and ionic liquids (Maksimov 2013). 
The rhodium nanoparticles were made in a tetra-alkyl-ammonium ionic liquid by 
reducing an aqueous solution of rhodium tri-chloride with sodium borohydride 
in the presence of polymer, then adding -CD. 
Figure 2. Rhodium nanoparticles 
Because rhodium metal nanomaterials are notably agents in supported states 
for a range of catalytic applications, with CO hydrogenation (Kim 2012), hydrogen
generation (Celok 2012, Rogatis 2008), and chemo-selective hydrogenations 
(Jacinto 2008, Maksimov 2013, Nakamula 2011, Huang 2012). It’s of scientific 
interest to produce nano-sized particles on a fusion material, particularly if it 
results in particles or dispersions with exclusive features. Polymers were utilized 
as stabilizers in prior colloidal Rh particle studies. Valentini (1985) studied the 
catalytic efficiency of a polymer-bound catalyst may be greatly increased by
optimizing the preparative approach and changing the characteristics of the 
support via a crosslinking procedure linking the polymer’s reactive clusters. In 
the case of polyacrylic acid, a great scattering of metal parts within the reactant 
has no promising impact on the catalytic movement of the committed metal 
species. Edersson (1998) synthesized the coupling of 2-diphenyl phosphino-2-
diphenyl phosphino-methyl pyrrolidine (PPM) to polyacrylic acid outcomes in 
a simple water-soluble equivalent of the parental ligand. The macromolecular 
ligand has a high water solubility. The reaction of the macromolecular ligand 
with bis-norbornadiene rhodium triflate Rh produces a polymer-bound cationic 
rhodium. Phosphine compound catalyst may be used for enantioselective 
hydrogenation in water or under biphasic conditions. Maksimov (2013) detected 
the hydrogenation of phenols in ionic liquids, and original catalyst scheme based 
on rhodium nanoparticles stabilized by polyacrylic acid has been proposed. The 
introduction of ionic liquid cations hooked on the surface layer self-possessed 
with polyacrylic acid has been exposed to expressively reduce particle size and 
diminish nanoparticle aggregation using TEM and XPS methods. Reyed (2014) 
prepared poly vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (Jaini 2012, Ashida 2007), poly vinyl 
alcohol (PVA) (Jaini 2012), and poly acrylic acid (PAA) (Maksimov 2013) 
polymers that are often employed as protective agents. This type of polymer 
has effectiveness and characteristics property as protective agents in mixed￾media colloids. As a result, it’s crucial to look at how hybrid materials work as Polyacrylic Acid and Its Derivatives-supported Catalyst 105 
rhodium nanoparticle support protectors. The hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was 
examined by SIHN produced from PAA/Al2O3 and various concentrations of 3-tri￾methoxysilyl propyl methacrylate (TMPM) as a connecter agent. Kuklin (2015) 
observed the hydrogenation of phenol in aqueous solution and ionic liquid; the 
inspiration of cyclodextrins on the doings and selectivity of a catalytic scheme 
based on rhodium nanoparticles stabilized by polyacrylic acid was examined. 
The reaction intermediate and the composition of the cyclodextrin (CD) were 
revealed to have an important impact on the pace of reaction and the circulation 
of reaction products. 
2.3 Polyacrylic acid and its derivatives-supported 
palladium catalyst 
The use of supported heterogeneous catalysts has a brief history. Catalysts made 
of palladium are a good example of this sort of material. Pd–C catalysts, for 
example, are frequently used in alkene hydrogenation (Augustine 1995). They 
have the benefits of wide availability, low handling and preparation costs, and 
activity that is often on par with or better than the more “modern” hydrogenation 
catalysts that are rarely reported. While hydrogenation is important, other 
palladium-catalyzed processes, such as allylic substitutions and cross-coupling 
chemistry, are currently of greater interest. A number of palladium catalysts have 
been developed for various purposes (Farina 2004). At very mild conditions, the 
author discovered a few years ago that classical Pd–C catalysts have reactivity 
similar to the well-known homogeneous Pd catalyst, tetrakis (triphenylphosphine) 
palladium (Bergbreiter 1992, 1983). The allylic substitution of allyl acetates by 
nucleophiles such as secondary amines might be catalyzed by a supported Pd 
species produced from an organometallic derivative of cross-linked polystyrene 
(Bergbreiter 1983). In these circumstances, catalysis was most effective in the 
presence of a soluble phosphine, with reactions occurring at room temperature 
on occasion. The importance of innovative forms of catalysts, such as colloidal 
metal catalysts, for various catalytic processes, including cross-coupling 
reactions, has recently increased (Reetz 2004). Pd(0) colloidal catalysts, for 
example, exhibit a high reactivity, which is likely synthesized in situ during 
cross-coupling chemistry from Pd(II) palladacycle molecules (Consorty 2005). 
The technique of electroless copper deposition onto dielectric substrates 
utilizing pd+2/poly(acrylic acid) thin films is provided by Jackson (1990), who 
noticed the catalyst production mechanism. Dip-coating dielectric substrates 
in aqueous poly (acrylic acid) forms a 50-300 nm thick polymer layer on the 
surface, which is then dipped in water, where the process is catalyzed by PdSO4. 
Palladium absorption in the poly(acrylic acid) film is revealed to be owing to the 
ion exchange H+/Pd+2. In most situations, the polymer ligand used in polymer￾metal complex catalysts is made up of only one type of polymer, according 
to Jiang (1994). Polymethacrylic acid-palladium (PMAA-Pd) (Guo 1984) and 
chitosan-palladium (CS-Pd) (Wang 1992) complexes have been produced and 106 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Figure 3. Synthesis of Pd–PAA-g-PS catalysts 
used as heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. As is well known, enzymes 
are natural polymeric catalysts with extremely high activity and selectivity at 
mild conditions. A bipolymer palladium complex was used as a homogenous 
catalyst (Lio 2001). The Pd nanoparticles were manufactured inside a new form 
of porous polymeric support, which is reported by Liu (2001). The support is 
made up of diblock microspheres with block-segregated inner domains. The 
diblock microspheres were created using an oil-in-water emulsion process that 
has previously been used to make homopolymer preform spheres (Nakachi 
2000) PtBA-b-PCEMA (poly(t-butyl acrylate)-block-poly (2-cinnamoyloxyethyl). 
Erman (2004) discovered electrospun copolymers of acrylonitrile and acrylic 
acid (PAN-AA) mats; catalytic palladium (Pd) nanoparticles were produced 
by reducing PdCl2 with hydrazine. PAN-AA and PdCl2 solutions in dimethyl 
formamide were used to make electrospun fibre mats (DMF). Electrospun fibres 
with Pd particles have 4.5 times the catalytic activity of current fibres. Gröschel 
et al. (2005) describes catalytically active membranes based on poly(acrylic 
acid) networks that incorporate palladium nanoparticles as a suitable catalyst 
for a gas-phase hydrogenation process. In the presence of a block copolymer, 
palladium particles were produced in organic solutions using reducing agents such 
as NaBH4 or LiAlH4 from Pd(OAc)2. After combining the metal dispersion with 
a polymer dispersion having a predefined proportion of polymer, catalytically
active membranes were created by cross-linking it with a difunctional epoxide 
(acrylic acid). The effects of membrane porosity, catalyst loading, and reactant  
 
Polyacrylic Acid and Its Derivatives-supported Catalyst 107 
mixture flow velocity on membrane catalytic behaviour are investigated. Chen 
(2006) observed that Pd(0) crystallites can be supported by grafts of poly(acrylic 
acid) on polyethylene powder (PE-g-PAA) or polystyrene (PS-g-PAA) in some 
procedures, acting as a homogeneous Pd(0) catalyst. These Pd–PE-g-PAA catalysts 
were active in allylic substitution reactions in the presence of a phosphine ligand. 
In these reactions, the active catalysts are leached from the support. The allylic 
substitution procedure requires external triphenylphosphine and substrate for the 
chemistry and Pd leaching (Bergbreiter 2006). 
2.4 Polyacrylic acid and its derivatives-supported 
TEMPO catalyst 
The stable nitroxyl radical TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) is 
extensively used in polymer research as a spin-label for assessing polymer 
chain mobility and in controlled radical polymerizations (Nicolas 2013, Lappan 
2015). TEMPO-grafted water-soluble polymers are redox active and could be 
engaged in energy storage. TEMPO is often used as an oxidation mediator for 
polysaccharides because it favourably oxidizes primary alcohols to the related 
aldehydes and carboxylic acids. Brag (2013) focused on the use of TEMPO 
grafted on water-soluble polymers to oxidize cellulose. In one variation, 
polyvinylamine with grafted TEMPO (PVAm-T) adsorbs on cellulose and 
promotes oxidation, resulting in surface aldehydes, which then form covalent 
bonds with amine groups on PVAm-T chains (Pelton 2011). A single procedure is 
used for oxidation and grafting at output. In a different experiment, author made 
poly(acrylic acid-g-TEMPO) (PAA-T) and showed that it may be a beneficial 
cellulose oxidant (Pelton 2014). 
The breakdown of layer-by-layer (LbL) thin films formed of 2,2,6,6-
tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl free radical-appended poly(acrylic acid) (TEMPO￾PAA) and poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) was examined using a quartz crystal 
microbalance (QCM) and cyclic voltammetry by Anzai (2014). The shift in the 
resonance frequency of the QCM increased after electrolysis, indicating that 
the film was decomposed. Pelton (2016) tested the water solubility properties
over the pH range as part of our ongoing study with PAA-T. Under acidic 
circumstances (pH 24.5), author was started to see adjustable stage separation 
of PAA-T polymers, dependent on the polymer content and degree of TEMPO 
substitution. Author offered a systematic set of experiments in which PAA-T
stage performances in water were described, the theory of the powerful factor for 
phase separation is supported by an after sign. Huang (2017) seems that addition 
of catalysts to magnetic polyvalent provisions to help with catalyst reusing and 
recapture can be viable option. Author offered a simple and effective approach 
for immobilizing TEMPO onto polymer-modified magnetic nanoparticles. The
resultant poly (acrylic acid) magnetic nanocomposite is an excellent material for 
immobilizing the organocatalyst H-TEMPO by an esterification reaction with
the polymer chain’s pendant carboxyl group. Recycling tests revealed that the 108 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Figure 4. Preparation of PAA-TEMPO
nanocomposite catalyst’s stability and reusability met expectations. Liu (2018) 
used solution polymerization to make water-soluble polyacrylic acid; P(AA-co￾TA) was employed in place of free TEMPO as a recoverable catalyst. The use 
of water-soluble supported TEMPO in the selective oxidation of cellulose was 
initially described by Pelton (2011), Liu (2013), Shi (2014), and Fu (2017). A 
water-dissoluble nitroxide polymer of PVAm-TEMPO was formed by loading
4-COOH TEMPO onto water-dissoluble polyvinyl amine (PVAm). PVAm TEMPO
impulsively adsorbed on cellulose and oxidized the C6 hydroxyl to aldehyde 
groups, which cooperated to generate covalent connections with primary amines 
on PVAm, according to the findings. Temporarily, they immobilized TEMPO
on PAA via acylation between the amino groups of 4-NH2-TEMPO and the
carboxyl groups of PAA, resulting in a water-dissoluble nitroxide polymer of 
PAA-TEMPO. To make the PAA TEMPO performance as a catalytic oxidation 
catalyst, it was important to adsorb a layer of PVAm on the surface of cellulose, 
unlike PVAm-TEMPO.
Li (2018) created extremely biocompatible DO30 nanoassemblies based on 
oxidized starch self-assembly at biological concentrations for improved anti-cancer 
behaviour. DO30 nanoassemblies were revealed to be non-toxic in numerous
cell lines. When compared to DOX alone or DOX-loaded PAA-PEG-RGD
nano-assemblies, DOX-loaded DO30-PEG-RGD nano-assemblies demonstrated 
special buildup and enhanced inhibitory propagation of HepG2 cells via v3

integrin-mediated gratitude. The demonstration of the RGD modified DO30
nano-assembly is a great opportunity to develop a new method for constructing 
safe and effective anti-cancer nanocarriers.
2.5 Polyacrylic acid and its derivatives-supported 
other catalyst 
Molybdenum complexes formed via dispersion of MoCl5 in a polyacrylic 
acid matrix. The particulars of taster preparation, heat treatment and adsorbate 
experience all mark the exact bonding of the cation to the support. After activation 
at 373 K, molybdenum is prepared to the polymer matrix through mono and 
bi-dentate oxygen ligands, exposing the progressive replacement of chlorine 
ligands in activated material by oxygen ligands from the polymer. The Mo￾Cl bond is resistant to dioxygen and hydrolysis in the PAA medium, implying 
strong matrix bonding and the presence of coordinately saturated octahedral Mo 
(V) complexes (Dyrek 1993). 
A simple method to a degradable form of poly (acrylic acid) – poly (glyceric 
acid carbonate) by the copolymerization of benzyl glycidate and CO2 using the 
bi-functional catalyst followed by hydrogenolysis. The polymerization method 
provides a strong selectivity for carbonate linkages (>99%) as well as a polymer/ 
cyclic carbonate selectivity. Poly (glyceric acid carbonate) is generated when the 
resultant polymer is deprotected, and it degrades in aqueous solution. The PGAC 
hydrogel rapidly dissolves when a degradable site is inserted into each repeating 
unit (Zhang 2015). Only a few well-defined structures, such as poly(malic acid)
s, make up the existing pool of acidic polymers, which is both small and diverse 
(Guerin 1985). Along with its biocompatibility and degradability, the authors 
believe that poly (glyceric acid carbonate) will be useful to chemists and material 
scientists working on a variety of chemical, biological, and pharmacological 
difficulties. The nanocomposite material was characterized using a variety 
of spectroscopic approaches. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns indicated the
formation of silver nanoparticles, while a transmission electron microscopy image 
revealed that Ag nanoparticles are formed and equally diffused in mesoporous 
polyacrylic acid (Mandi 2016). With glycerol as a hydrogen basis, the Ag-MCP-1 
nanocomposite may be working as an effective heterogeneous catalyst in the
reductive coupling of nitrobenzenes and alcohols. 
Poly (acrylic acid) may be utilized as a stabilizer for nanoparticle production 
to increase the dispersion of nanoparticles within the hydrogel matrix and partially 
avoid the development of aggregates. PAA’s carboxyl functional groups have 
the capability to cooperate with an extensive variety of inorganic materials. Our 
own research has shown that reinforced silver nanoparticles have higher catalytic 
movement in a variety of processes. Silver possesses the greatest electrical 
conductivity, as well as improved catalytic activity, antimicrobial characteristics, 
and biocompatibility. As a result of the right selection of organic mesoporous 
PAA and inorganic Ag particles phases, Brodt (2014) have produced a unique 
material that shows both organic and inorganic features.  
 
110 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
The electrodes’ stability was shown to be much greater than that of electrodes 
made from the same catalyst using traditional procedures (Brodt et al. 2014). Brodt 
et al. suggested that PAA occupies a crucial role in increasing the electrode’s 
stability based on their findings. The electrospinning and solution characteristics of
mixed Nafion and PAA solutions were investigated by Chen et al. (2008). The least
quantity of PAA required for bead-free electrospinning while retaining sufficient 
conductivity has been observed to be about 25% by weight (Chen et al. 2008). 
The use of PAA-Nafion composites as a catalyst support for PEM fuel cell 
electrodes was investigated. A modified UV light driven photochemical reaction 
of the Pt precursor with a modest quantity of Nafion as surfactant was employed 
to manufacture the catalyst. The freshly produced Pt nanoparticles were treated 
with a PAA-Nafion solution. Carbon was only added afterwards to increase the 
electrical conductivity. The stability of the catalyst was tested in a fuel cell test 
bench using potential cycling in aqueous solution and accelerated degradation 
experiments. A formula for electrospinning was included in the manufactured 
catalyst suspension. 
3. Application of polyacrylic acid-supported 
catalyst 
Polyacrylic acid-supported catalyst prospective uses in chemical and biological 
devices, layer-by-layer (LbL) thin films have gotten a lot of interest in the field 
of polymer science and technology. Alternate deposition of polymeric materials 
by electrostatic bonding, hydrogen bonding, or biological affinity can be used to 
make LbL thin films, linear polymers, dendrimers, proteins, and polysaccharides 
(Decher 1997), which are examples of polymeric materials for LbL deposition. 
In a pH 8.4 aqueous buffer solution, cross-linked hydrogels made from
poly(glyceric acid carbonate) and poly(ethylene glycol) diaziridine degrade 
significantly more than hydrogels made from poly(acrylic acid) and poly(ethylene
glycol) diaziridine. For example: ion-exchange resins, emulsifiers, chelating
agents, scale inhibitors, superabsorbents, and dispersants. Many of these 
applications use linear or cross-linked PAA designs, the PAA backbone’s flexibility
allows for multivalent interactions with a variety of surfaces or ions, which may 
be influenced by branching. Tunable synthetic approaches for the insertion of
controlled branching into well-defined PAA designs are necessary to understand 
the structure–property correlations for these significant commercial systems.
Authors have produced a library of PAA polymers with systematic architectural 
alterations to solve this difficulty (Inoue 2005).
Polymer brushes have emerged as a useful and promising tool for 
immobilizing various specimens and moieties on macroscopic surfaces, such 
as macromolecules, proteins, and nanoparticles. When compared to alternative 
methods for chemical grafting of various species, the incorporation of polymer 
brushes into specimens on silicon substrates, such as electron-beam lithography, Polyacrylic Acid and Its Derivatives-supported Catalyst 111 
block copolymer micelle nanolithography (BCML), in situ nucleation and growth, 
layer by layer deposition, or self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), has a number 
of advantages (Verma 2018, Jadoun 2018, Verma 2017, Riaz 2015). 
4. Conclusion and future prospects 
Polyacrylic acid and its derivatives are produced in various ways with the 
help of catalyst. Platinum (Pt) is one of the most commonly used catalysts 
for polymer support because of its remarkable catalytic activity, stability, and 
conductivity. For aqueous-alcoholic solution and ionic liquids, rhodium has 
the same catalytic mechanism. TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) 
is a spin-label used in polymer research to measure polymer chain mobility 
and in controlled radical polymerizations. Pd–C catalytic support is often used 
in the hydrogenation of alkenes. A wide spectrum of polyacrylic derivatives is 
tolerated by the whole catalytic system. The aforementioned catalytic method 
has numerous advantages, including a simple set-up procedure and the ability to 
reuse the catalyst for multiple reaction cycles. These qualities make the method 
inexpensive and environmentally benign, and it has a lot of potential for polymer 
value addition synthesis.

1. Introduction 
Catalysis has always been a hot area in the domain of chemistry and in recent 
years many studies have been done; still, numerous distinguished challenges are 
yet to be explored (Bossion et al. 2019, Munirathinam et al. 2015). Improved 
tools for catalyst characterization and new approaches for catalyst screening 
might help to resolve many futuristic problems (Vogt and Weckhuysen 2022). 
New avenues have been opened for the discovery of completely new products 
because of catalyst development in the realm of polymer synthesis (Kiesewetter 
et al. 2010). The scientific community engaged in evolving developments is 
always striving for new catalyst discoveries. In the field of polymer science, 
catalysis is a key to many reactions (Shifrina et al. 2019). Any scientist or 
researcher is hardly ever aware of the precise methodology to achieve any 
novel product without knowing the extensive interpretation of catalysts. In

Polyether-supported Catalyst 119 
general, the catalysts are usually put in service as an adolescent component 
in any reaction mixture enabling the desired chemical process to occur (Kwon 
et al. 2021). 
Polymer-supported catalysts are a type of heterogeneous catalyst where the 
catalytic active site is anchored onto polymeric support (Gu et al. 2021). The 
polymeric support can be either a natural or a synthetic polymer, and it is chosen 
based on its compatibility with the reaction conditions and the nature of the 
catalytic active site (Nasrollahzadeh et al. 2019). Polyethers-supported catalysts 
are one of the types of polymer-supported catalysts widely used in various organic 
transformations including polymerization, hydrogenation, oxidation, and reduction 
reactions (Pirinen and Pakkanen 2015). They have several advantages over other 
types of catalysts including higher stability, lower toxicity, and ease of handling. 
The performance of polyethers-supported catalysts depends on the nature of the 
active site, the polyether polymer, and the method of preparation. The active 
site can be a metal complex, metal oxide, or a chiral ligand, depending on the 
specific reaction. New polyether structures can be more approachable with new 
catalysts making modern raw materials more attractive and lucrative (Gini et al. 
2020, Hu et al. 2019). 
There are various inborn attributes of ether linkage that drove the large-scale 
development and use of polyethers in a wide range of applications during the 
last several decades (Paraja et al. 2020). Talking about some of them highlights 
low polarity and low Van der Walls interaction characteristics, it provides fewer 
hurdles to the coiling and uncoiling of chains as the carbon-oxygen bond, and 
has lower barrier to rotation than the carbon-carbon bond. An important factor 
allowing for greater chain flexibility is that all its backbone units cumulate to the 
smallest “excluded volume” because ether oxygen has an even lower excluded 
volume than a methyl group (Wick and Theodorou 2004). Compared to ester, 
acetal, or amide links, it offers greater hydrolytic resistance because the carbon￾oxygen bond has a stronger bond energy (85 kcal/mol) than the carbon-carbon 
bond (82 kcal/mol) (Price 1974). 
2. Polyethers-supported catalysts 
Polyether-supported catalysts have several advantages over other types of 
catalysts, including higher stability, easier handling, and recyclability (Dembinski 
2004). This polymer provides stable and solid support for the active catalytic 
site, preventing aggregation and loss of activity. It allows the catalyst to be used 
for multiple reaction cycles, reducing the overall cost and waste generated by 
the reaction (Modak et al. 2021). 
Polyether-supported catalysts can be used in a wide range of organic 
transformations, including hydrogenation, oxidation, reduction, and polymerization 
reactions. They are effective in both small-molecule and large-molecule synthesis,
and can be used in both batch and continuous flow reactors. The choice of the 
active site, polyether polymer, and preparation method can greatly impact the  
 
 
 
 
 
120 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
performance of the polyether-supported catalyst. For example, the size and shape 
of the polyether polymer can influence the accessibility of the active site to the 
reactants, while the choice of metal complex or ligand can greatly affect the
selectivity and efficiency of the reaction (Lu and Toy 2009). 
One potential drawback of polyether-supported catalysts is that the polymer 
support can limit the diffusion of the reactants to the active site, leading to slower
reaction rates. However, this can often be addressed through careful selection of 
the polymer and the preparation method (Fukunishi et al. 1981). 
3. Synthesis of polyether-supported catalyst 
The synthesis of a polyether-supported catalyst typically involves several steps, 
including the preparation of the polyether, the attachment of the catalytic active 
site to the polymer, and the activation of the catalyst. Here is a general overview 
of the synthesis process: 
(i) Preparation of the polyether polymer: The first step is to prepare the polyether 
polymer that will serve as the support for the catalytic active site. The polymer 
can be either a natural or a synthetic polymer and is typically chosen based on 
its compatibility with the reaction conditions and the nature of the catalytic 
active site. The polymer is typically synthesized through a polymerization 
reaction, such as ring-opening polymerization (Wilms et al. 2010). 
(ii) Attachment of the catalytic active site to the polymer: Once the polymer is 
prepared, the next step is to attach the catalytic active site to the polymer. 
This can be done through a variety of methods, such as covalent attachment, 
adsorption, or ion exchange. The choice of attachment method depends on 
the nature of the active site and the polymer support (Rudolf et al. 2015). 
(iii) Activation of the catalyst: Once the active site is attached to the polymer, 
the catalyst needs to be activated to be effective. This typically involves a 
reduction or oxidation step, depending on the nature of the catalytic active 
site (Isono 2021). 
The specific steps and conditions for synthesizing a polyether-supported
catalyst will depend on the nature of the active site, the polymer support, and 
the desired reaction. Careful attention must be paid to optimizing the conditions 
to achieve the desired activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst. 
Huang et al. developed a polyether sulfone (PES) based cyclitic non￾permselective membrane reactor (CNMR) by basic blending process to achieve 
enhanced catalytic performance for cellulose for rapid reduction of phenolic 
pollutants in a continuous flow through the reaction from industrial wastewater 
(Huang et al. 2021). Polyepichlorohydrin (PECH), a functional polyether, 
was first synthesized in 1950’s using catalytic ring opening polymerization
of epichlorohydrin (ECH). ECH played a pioneering role in the discovery of 
epoxides. Being discovered by Edwin J. Vandenberg, it is popularly known as 
Vandenberg catalyst since then which empowered the synthesis of numerous brand  
 
Polyether-supported Catalyst 121 
new, economically viable, PECH-based rubber constituents. They reacted the alkyl 
aluminum–water catalyst with acetylacetone, to block a monomer coordination 
site to gain insight into some mechanistic aspects of epoxide polymerizations 
with the catalyst (Figure 1) (Shukla and Ferrier Jr 2021).

Meticulous synthesis of well-defined hyperbranched polyglycerol (PG) 
using ring-opening multi-branching polymerization of glycidol to prepare 
hyperbranched and polyfunctional polyethers with measurable molar mass and 
low polydispersities (Mw/Mn=1.2-1.9) via various monomer addition protocols 
is rigorously used (Ahn 2018). Hu et al. studied various alkali and alkaline earth 
metal salts with various linear and branched polyether complexing agents/co￾catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2, where 
polyethylene glycol dimethyl ethers appeared to be most promising ones (Hu 
et al. 2019). 
4. Properties of polyether-supported catalysts 
Polyether-supported catalysts have emerged as an important tool for a wide 
range of chemical transformations, offering many advantages over other types of 
catalysts. In this essay, we will discuss some of the key properties of polyether￾supported catalysts, including their stability, selectivity, recyclability, and 
customizability (Dunjic et al. 1994). 
4.1 High stability 
One of the key properties of polyether-supported catalysts is their high stability. 
The polyether polymer provides a stable matrix for the catalytic active site, 
preventing aggregation and loss of activity. This allows the catalyst to be used 
for multiple reaction cycles, reducing the overall cost and waste generated by 
the reaction. In addition, the polyether support can help to reduce the leaching of 
the active site into the reaction mixture, which can be important for maintaining 
high activity and selectivity (Konieczynska et al. 2015). 
4.2 Selectivity 
Another important property of polyether-supported catalysts is their selectivity. 
The polymer support can help to increase the selectivity of the catalyst by 122 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
allowing for more precise control over the reaction environment. For example, 
the size and shape of the polymer can influence the accessibility of the active site 
to the reactants, while the choice of metal complex or ligand can greatly affect 
the selectivity and efficiency of the reaction. This selectivity can be especially 
important in complex organic transformations where multiple reaction pathways 
are possible (Hirahata et al. 2008). 
4.3 Recyclability 
Polyether-supported catalysts are also highly recyclable, which can reduce 
the overall cost and waste generated by the reaction. The solid nature of the 
catalysts makes them easy to handle and store, and they can often be recovered 
and reused. This can be especially important in industrial-scale reactions, 
where the cost and waste generated by the reaction can be significant (Sawant 
et al. 2011). 
4.4 Customizability 
One of the most important properties of polyether-supported catalysts is their 
customizability. The choice of the active site and the polymer support can be 
customized to optimize the catalyst for a specific reaction. For example, the 
choice of polymer support can be influenced by the nature of the reaction and 
the reaction conditions, while the choice of active site can be tailored to the 
desired selectivity and efficiency of the reaction. This customizability has led to 
the development of a wide range of polyether-supported catalysts for a variety 
of chemical transformations (Harun et al. 2021). 
4.5 Others 
In addition to these key properties, polyether-supported catalysts also offer 
several other advantages. For example, they are compatible with a wide range 
of organic transformations, including hydrogenation, oxidation, reduction, and 
polymerization reactions. They are also often more environmentally friendly 
than other types of catalysts, as they can reduce the amount of waste generated 
by the reaction (Peighambardoust et al. 2011). 
Polyether-supported catalysts are a promising area of research in the field of 
catalysis, offering many advantages over other types of catalysts. They are likely 
to continue to be an important tool for synthetic chemists and chemical engineers 
in the years to come (Yu et al. 2010). 
5. Applications of polyether-supported catalyst 
Polyether polyols are principal chemical raw materials with a versatile spectrum 
of applications. Their intense use in many industries like petroleum, sealants, 
foam, elastomers, adhesives, coatings, textiles, and paper proves the worth itself 
(Segura et al. 2005). Polyether-supported Catalyst 123 
Polyether-supported catalysts have become increasingly important in the 
field of catalysis, offering a range of benefits over traditional catalysts. These
benefits include high stability, selectivity, recyclability, and customizability,
which make polyether-supported catalysts attractive for use in a wide range of 
chemical reactions. In this essay, we will discuss some of the major applications 
of polyether-supported catalysts. 
5.1 Organic synthesis 
Polyether-supported catalysts have been extensively used in organic synthesis 
reactions such as hydrogenation, oxidation, reduction, and condensation 
reactions. For example, polyether-supported palladium catalysts are commonly 
used for Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a reaction used in the synthesis of complex 
organic molecules. Polyether-supported ruthenium and iridium catalysts have 
also been used in hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation reactions, which 
are important in the synthesis of fine chemicals (Yu et al. 2010, Weber and 
Gokel 2012). 
5.2 Environmental remediation 
Polyether-supported catalysts have also found applications in environmental 
remediation, particularly in the removal of pollutants from wastewater and 
air. For example, polyether-supported copper catalysts have been used in the 
degradation of organic pollutants such as dyes and pesticides in water, while 
polyether-supported iron catalysts have been used in the removal of nitrogen 
oxides from the air (Ahmed and Jhung 2021). 
5.3 Pharmaceuticals 
Polyether-supported catalysts have emerged as a valuable tool in the synthesis 
of pharmaceuticals due to their high selectivity, low leaching, and recyclability. 
For example, polyether-supported chiral catalysts have been used in asymmetric 
hydrogenation reactions, which is an important step in the synthesis of chiral 
drugs. The selectivity of these catalysts can be fine-tuned by varying the polymer 
support, which can lead to higher yields and fewer side reactions (Thomas 
et al. 2014). 
5.4 Polymerization 
Polyether-supported catalysts have been used in a variety of polymerization 
reactions, including the polymerization of olefins and other monomers. 
Polyether-supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts are commonly used in the production 
of polyethylene and polypropylene, while polyether-supported metallocene 
catalysts have been used in the production of specialty polymers with unique 
properties, such as polyethylene with high strength and elasticity (Dookhith et 
al. 2022, Brocas et al. 2013). 124 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
5.5 Fuel cells 
Polyether-supported catalysts have also been explored for use in fuel cells, which 
are an important technology for producing clean energy. Polyether-supported 
platinum catalysts are commonly used in fuel cells to catalyze the oxygen 
reduction reaction, which is an important step in the production of electricity 
(Peighambardoust et al. 2011). 
5.6 Others 
Additionally, polyether-supported catalysts have also been used in a range of 
other chemical reactions, including epoxidation, cycloaddition, and carbonylation 
reactions. The stability, selectivity, recyclability, and customizability of these 
catalysts make them attractive for use in a variety of chemical reactions, and 
they are likely to continue to be an important tool for synthetic chemists and 
chemical engineers in the years to come (Wilms et al. 2010, Homberg and 
Lacour 2020). They are also very much useful in nowadays booming aerospace 
industry applications, notably missile propellants. Gu et al. (2021) probed into 
the optimization of polyether polyol coming from propylene oxide using Single 
Factor Experiments and Response Surface Methodology by way of composite 
alkaline earth metal catalyst (BaO/MgO/γ-Al2O3). This is a highly stable and 
environmentally friendly catalyst favorable for steady production having very 
high catalytic activity, needs no post-treatment and most importantly can be 
reused (Li et al. 2020). ECH comprising polymers are utilized in a broad 
range of applications because of the alkyl chloride functional group and ether 
backbone. Some of the applications are Anion Exchange Membranes (AEM), 
Polymer Electrolytes (in lithium-ion batteries) and CO2 separation (Noh et al. 
2019). Hyperbranched polyglycerols have proved enormous potential to be used 
as soluble support for catalysts and organic synthesis, in biomineralization and 
biomedical applications (Noh et al. 2019). 
6. Conclusion 
Polyether-supported catalysts have emerged as a valuable tool in catalysis, 
offering a range of benefits over traditional catalysts. The stability, selectivity, 
recyclability, and customizability of these catalysts have made them attractive 
for use in a wide range of chemical reactions, including organic synthesis, 
pharmaceuticals, polymerization, environmental remediation, and fuel cells. The 
ability to tailor the polymer support and the active site of the catalyst has led 
to the development of a wide range of polyether-supported catalysts for specific 
applications. Polyether-supported catalysts have not only improved the efficiency 
of chemical reactions, but they have also reduced the environmental impact 
by providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution to chemical processes. 
Moreover, the use of these catalysts has led to significant cost savings in the 
chemical industry due to their recyclability and long-term stability. The continued Polyether-supported Catalyst 125 
development of new polyether-supported catalysts and their applications is 
likely to play an increasingly important role in the field of catalysis in the 
coming years. As researchers continue to optimize these catalysts for specific 
applications, we can expect to see breakthroughs in the synthesis of complex 
organic molecules, the production of high-performance polymers, the removal of 
environmental pollutants, and the generation of clean energy. Overall, polyether￾supported catalysts have the potential to revolutionize the field of catalysis and 
contribute to a more sustainable and efficient chemical industry.

1. Introduction 
The development of polymeric catalyst has attracted the researchers for the 
synthesis of new organic and inorganic macromolecules with control properties. 
The facilitation of these reactions in presence of visible light with respect to 
green chemistry is very interesting and promising approach. For the synthesis of 
polymer-supported catalysts, many significant techniques have been utilized and 
among them ring opening metathesis and atom transfer radical polymerization are 
the most widely utilized techniques. Catalyst required to synthesize the polymer 
is often more valuable and is always discarded after single polymerization and 
their use in this regard is nothing more than an academic curiosity. This renders 
the recovery and reuse of the less-precious supported catalyst inconsequential 
(Rossegger et al. 2013). Synthetic (co)polymer materials have been also 
investigated due to their wide range of properties and functions which can be 
modulated by tuning their structures’ properties in biomedical sciences such as 
for controlled and triggered drugs delivery, responsive bio-interfaces mimicking 
natural surfaces’ biosensors and in chemo-mechanical actuators; among them, 
stimuli-responsive (co)polymers have become a major polymer research area 
which shows significant applications in tissue engineering, bio-imaging and

in environmental remediation (Rapoport 2007, Shim and Kwon 2012, Cheng 
et al. 2015, Traitel et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2019, Mendes 2008, Stuart et al. 
2010, Wei et al. 2017, Joseph and Jose 2021, Jeong et al. 2001, Liu and Urban 
2010, Roy et al. 2010, Chen et al. 2010, Lu and Urban 2018). They undergo 
reversible and irreversible changes in their physical chemical properties after 
the modification and variations in pH, temperature, light, redox potential, ionic 
strength, ultrasound, electrical and magnetic fields as shown in Figure 1.

Some natural stimuli-responsive polymers and bio-macromolecules like 
proteins and nucleic acids are also known as “environmentally sensitive” and 
“intelligent biomaterials” (Hoffman 1995, Kikuchi and Okano 2002, García￾Fernández et al. 2019, Kocak et al. 2017, Kim and Matsunaga 2017, Bertrand 
and Gohy 2017, Sedighipoor et al. 2019, Huo et al. 2014, Yoshida et al. 2013, 
Magnusson et al. 2008, Hu et al. 2012, Shahriari et al. 2019, Ma and Shi 2014, 
Lin and Theato 2013, Manouras and Vamvakaki 2017). 
But due to lack of some significant properties like non-toxicity, biocompatibility
and biodegradability, they have been never considered as ideal biomedical 
materials. In last few years, many polymeric biomaterials have been prepared 
for biomedical applications using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and various other 
significant polymeric properties (Kumar et al. 2007, Cabane et al. 2012, Berglund
et al. 2016, Tian et al. 2012, Knop et al. 2010, D’souza and Shegokar 2016, De La
Rosa 2014, Konradi et al. 2012, Hucknall et al. 2009, Banerjee et al. 2011). But 
PEG-containing polymers produce toxins in enzymatic oxidation in physiological
environment; therefore, to overcome these limitations, new polymers have  
Poly(ethylene imine) and Poly(2-oxazoline)-supported Catalyst 131 
been synthesized, in which poly(2-oxazoline)s is considered to be a promising 
alternative to PEG-containing polymers. We can hydrolyze these P(Ox)s by acids
and these are degradable in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The 
poly(2-oxazoline)s class of compounds attracted great attention of researchers due
to its versatility in the synthesis of various materials with different properties.
These polymeric 2-oxazoline materials are currently receiving much interest as 
potential biomaterials in microwave reactors which are designed for chemical 
synthesis (Bauer et al. 2012, Hoogenboom 2009, Hoogenboom and Schlaad 2011, 
Jana and Uchman 2020, Luxenhofer et al. 2012). 
Now a days, polyoxazolines-based substituted polymers are in demand and 
considered as competitive as compared to other biocompatible polymer like PEG,
poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), and poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) for the 
synthesis and development of next-generation therapeutics (Van Kuringen et
al. 2012, Ulbricht et al. 2014, Sedlacek et al. 2012). Schematic representation
highlighting the research interest of researchers in P(Ox) for the development of 
polymer therapeutics is shown in Figure 2.

2. Synthesis and applications of poly(ethylene 
imine) and poly(2-oxazoline) 
Substituted poly(2-oxazoline)s were prepared by microwave assisted method 
in inert atmosphere. After weighing poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline), poly(2-ethyl￾2-5oxazoline), poly(2-phenyl-2-oxazoline) and poly(2-nonyl-2-oxazoline) in  
 
132 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
microwave vial, all these poly(2-oxazoline)s were heated with methyl tosylate 
and acetonitrile at 140 °C and quenching is carried out after the addition of 
water (Hwang et al. 2019). In the last few years, many investigations have been 
carried out by the researchers for the synthesis and development of poly(2-
substituted 2-oxazolines) (POx) and other significant initiators and terminators 
via cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) and supercritical CO2-assisted 
and microwave assisted green methodologies. Advancements in synthesis and 
development of POx made it a competitive alternative for polymer systems due 
to its easy synthetic methods and chemical diversity which in turn strengthened 
the liability of POx. Many functionalized POx products are part of current 
commercial market which increases the opportunity for the uptake of these 
promising materials. As POXs are considered as enormous potential material 
because of their structural properties and various biological and physicochemical 
properties, CROP can be considered to have a “living” character, which meets 
appropriate reaction conditions and has an integral characteristic (Hoogenboom 
2017, Verbraeken et al. 2017, De Macedo et al. 2007, Bonifácio et al. 2012, 
Wang et al. 2007, Hoogenboom et al. 2005, Kempe et al. 2011). This living 
cationic ring-opening polymerization facilitates the incorporation of various 
functional groups by using appropriate initiators and terminating agents like 
2-substituted 2-oxazolines (Figure 3).

mechanism: Demonstrating the initiation, propagation and termination steps. https://s100.

Poly(2-oxazoline)s (POx) have been known for a little over 50 years and this family
of polymers has seen very variable interest by researchers and industry. Poly(2-ethyl-2-
oxazoline) (PEtOx) and hydrophilic poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (PMeOx) are the
actual chemical species investigated in the last few years. PEtOx is an amphiphilic
polymer that exhibits excellent solubility in water and some other organic solvents
and also very significant applications in the field of biomaterials like in organic 
electronics. Cationic ring-opening polymerization of 2-oxazoline monomers
can be performed in a way to suppress all the side-reactions like termination 
of chain growth as this type of polymerization is also considered as living or 
quasi-living polymerization. Due to significant developments of polymerization 
and green methodologies like supercritical CO2-assisted, microwave-assisted  
 
 
 
 
Poly(ethylene imine) and Poly(2-oxazoline)-supported Catalyst 133 
techniques and improved synthesis of initiators, monomers, and terminators, the 
synthesis of poly(2-substituted 2-oxazolines) (POx) via cationic ring-opening
polymerization is the area of significant research during the last few years. These 
improvements have also strengthened the commercial viability of POx, and hence
there are now a number of functionalized POx products available in the market, 
thereby increasing the opportunity for broad uptake of these promising materials. 
Specifically, care must be taken to ensure the absence of chain-transfer promoting
impurities and reagents, as well as nucleophilic species that could cause unwanted 
chain termination (Figure 4). 
Poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) containing primary, secondary and tertiary amino
group, which is synthesized by the CROP of ethylene imine, is the best known 
polymer. We can modify the functionalities of PEI to obtain desired polymer
by substituting various organic moieties (Kobayashi et al. 1986, Tomalia and
Sheetz 1966). Poly(2-oxazoline)s was first synthesized by the research group of 
Tomalia and co-workers (1966). They studied the hydrolysis of poly(2-methyl-2-
oxazoline) and PEI in the presence of sulphuric acid for the acetic acid formation.
Hydrolysis of poly(2-oxazoline)s is a promising route for the preparation of linear
PEI, and for the easy determination of structure-property relationships (SAR).
Cationic ring-opening polymerization of 2-oxazolines is the best known synthetic
procedure for the preparation of significant polymers with desired physiochemical
properties (Tomalia and Sheetz 1966, Aoi and Okada 1996, Kobayashi et al. 1986,
Hoogenboom 2007, Adams and Schubert 2007, Seeliger et al. 1966, Kagiya et al.
1966, Bassiri et al. 1967, Christova et al. 2002, 2003). Research group of Saegusa
and other researchers studied the synthesis and characterization of linear PEI
through the cationic ring-opening polymerization of 2-oxazoline and hydrolysis of
the poly(2-oxazoline) in alkaline conditions. Poly(2-oxazoline)s can be also used 
as precursor for linear PEI upon hydrolysis under alkaline or acidic conditions 
(Saegusa et al. 1972, Tanaka et al. 1983, Jeong et al. 2001). In textile industry, 
PEI is used for the pre-treatment of fibres for a better adsorption or desorption 
of dyes, for the treatment of paper and for DNA and RNA delivery into cells 
due to its high charge density, which is due to the nitrogen atom present in it, 
which can be easily protonated and make PEI capable of condensing plasmid
DNA and RNA into stable complexes through electrostatic interactions (Jones and
Thompson 2009). As its contain variety of side chain (methyl, ethyle) and due 
to its versatile nature, poly(2-oxazoline) has been considered to be hydrophilic 
in nature while poly(2-oxazoline) with longer side chains has been considered to 
be hydrophobic in nature. Very few studies have been carried out by researchers 
on poly(2-oxazoline)s or poly(alkyl ethyleneimine)s (PalkylEI) due to very small
difference in molecular structure in poly(2-oxazoline) and PalkylEI. We can
prepare PalkylEI by two synthetic routes, i.e either by the alkylation of linear 
PEI and/or by the reduction of poly(2-oxazoline)s (Kobayashi et al. 1986, Jin
2002, Hoogenboom 2007, Aoi and Okada 1996, Wiesbrock et al. 2004, Sinnwell 
and Ritter 2005, Hu et al. 2017).

Frech and co-worker synthesized linear poly (methyl ethylene imine) (PMEI)
and linear poly(ethyl ethylene imine) (PEEI) via the alkylation of linear PEI and 
Tanaka and research group synthesized PMEI by Eschweiler-Clarke reductive
N-methylation method and reported its properties (Frech et al. 2005). PEtOx
was also synthesized by cationic ring opening polymerization (CROP). 2-ethyl￾2-oxazoline and 1,4-dibromo-2E-butene in 30:1 molar ratio were mixed in a flask 
in acetonitrile at 80 °C for 20 h in inert atmosphere. Quenching was carried out 
by adding methanolic KOH. Precipitation of prepared polymer was done in cold 
diethyl ether and dried under vacuum (Christova et al. 2002).

3. Conclusions 
Researchers have been focused on polymer-supported catalyst for the synthesis 
and development of polymeric materials in the last few decades. Due to 
biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, family of polymers like poly(2-
oxazoline)s (POX) and poly(ethylene imine) have gained much more interest 
as biomaterials. In view of these pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, 
we have tried to study the polymer-supported catalyst for the development of 
various polymers.

Polyisobutylene and Polynorbornenes￾supported Catalysts 
Deepshikha Rathore* and Diksha Verma

1. Introduction 
Catalysis is a prime area of synthetic chemistry which can be used to perform 
typical reactions under mild conditions with significantly higher yields in shorter 
reaction times. The reuse and recycling of catalysts is currently an important 
focus area in organic synthesis (Holladay and Albrecht 2012). In this endeavour, 
polymeric supported catalysts have become increasingly popular and are widely 
used, particularly since the rapid development of contemporary chemistry that 
idealises the concepts of “green” and “sustainable” (Ley and Baxendale 2002). 
The primary benefits of these solid support catalysts are their ease of synthesis, 
effortless fabrication, physical separability, recyclability, and high environmental 
stability. Starting with the Merrifield and Letsinger’s ground-breaking discovery 
of cross-linked polystyrene in peptide synthesis, insoluble polymeric systems 
have achieved a lime light in the catalyst world (Benaglia 2007, Benaglia et al. 
2003). However, there are various shortcomings in the use of these insoluble 
resins due to their heterogeneous nature in the reaction conditions. Therefore, 
replacing the insoluble heterogeneous resins with soluble homogeneous polymeric 
supports have been employed and are considered preferably due to their ease of 
characterization, high reactivity, selectivity, polydispersity, and flexibility. There 
are many polymeric support systems available that have been widely used as 
catalyst, such as atactic-polypropylene (PP), or isotactic-poly(propylene-co￾hexene) (iPPH), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(N-alkylacrylamide) and 
polystyrene derivatives etc. (Anna et al. 2013). PEG is the most common soluble

142 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
support polymer used for the synthesis and catalytic activity due to its wide 
commercial availability and history of being easily modified (Bandaiphet and 
Kennedy 2004, Dickerson et al. 2003). The soluble Polyisobutylene (PIB) and 
Poly(norbornene) (PNB) based supports have recently been widely involved 
in the catalytic reactions, and are regarded as two important pillars of the 
polymer supported catalyst (Bergbreiter et al. 2011a & b, Sommer and Weck 
2006, Su et al. 2010). 
PIB is a vinyl polymer made by cationic polymerization of isobutylene 
(IB) monomer. Despite the fact that it has a linear structure, it is classified as a 
synthetic rubber or elastomer. They have unique properties such as low moisture 
permeability, chemical resistivity, oxidative and thermal stability (Boyd and 
Pant 1991, Kunal et al. 2008). PIB and its derivatives have the advantage of a 
structurally simple and chemically inert alkane backbone. It is considered as an 
analogue of PEG with a commercially available average molecular weight of 1000 
or 2300 Da. It is mostly soluble in aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents 
but insoluble in polar solvents due to their non-crystalline, paraffinic, and nonpolar
nature. This phase soluble selectivity of PIB and its derivatives is appealing, as 
any polymer or species attached to it can be easily removed from the reaction 
mixture simply by extraction. PIB-attached ligands and metal complexes can be 
easily characterized by NMR spectroscopy because they have only two major 
protons appearing in the range of δ2.00-1.00 ppm (Li et al. 2005). Furthermore, 
PIB contains complex heterogeneous morphology, good swelling properties, and 
extremely high mechanical strength. Therefore, the polymer based on IB with 
branched architectures has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications 
such as microencapsulation, dispersion of chemicals and catalysts, production 
of reactive polymers, modifications of rheological properties of solutions and
suspensions, and additive polymer processing operations. The major advantage 
of using PIB as a catalyst is its easy alteration in carbon-carbon double bond 
by standard reactions of alkene. Also, PIB supported ligands behave like a low 
molecular weight counterpart in metal coordination and are useful in catalysis. 
Thus, commercially available PIB derivatives have been frequently modified
terminally to prepare a wide variety of soluble polymeric reagents and ligands such 
as PIB-bounded phosphine ligands, salen catalysts, olefins metathesis catalysts, 
organocatalysts, Cu(I) catalyst for atom transfer radical polymerization and 
azide-alkene cyclization, Rh(II) and Cu(II) cyclopropanation catalyst, and vinyl 
ether sequestering agents (Bergbreiter and Li 2004, Liang and Bergbreiter 2016).
On the other hand, PNB which was first developed by CdF-Chimie in 
France in 1976, is notable for being the first ROMP polymer to be used for
commercial purposes by Nippon Zeon Company of Japan under the trade name 
Norsorex®. The monomer for PNB is synthesised by Diels-Alder reaction of 
cyclopentadiene and ethylene. The PNB is made up of a cyclohexene ring with a 
methylene bridge that restricts rotation around the main chain. An exceptionally 
high molecular weight (>3,000,000 g mol-1) material with a predominance of 
trans olefins is produced as a result of polymerization in the presence of a 
Polyisobutylene and Polynorbornenes-supported Catalysts 143 
RuCl3/HCl/BuOH catalyst system. The material has remarkable qualities, acting 
as both an elastomeric and thermoplastic material due to its large molecular 
weight and unsaturated microstructure (Blank and Janiak 2009). Norsorex®’s
exceptional damping qualities in applications for shock, vibration, and sound
control are a result of its Tg of 37 °C. It can absorb up to ten times its dry weight 
in hydrocarbons due to its low polarity and large molecular weight, generating 
a gel that retains acceptable mechanical qualities. Because of this, it has specific 
uses for removing oil spills. In the field of catalysis, solubility/swellability
profile, level of functionalization, and potential participation of the polymer
backbone are just a few of the various characteristics of polymeric supports that 
need to be taken into account (Kann 2010). PNB is a good option for catalyst 
support due to its distinctive solubility selectivity, which allows its removal 
from the reaction mixture by straightforward filtration. PIB supported catalyst
such as salen catalysts, C–C coupling-catalyst, olefins metathesis catalysts, metal 
organocatalysts etc. have been used widely (Fredlund et al. 2017, Karimi et al. 
2013, Madhavan et al. 2011). 
Here, a brief survey on recent developments in the field of PIB and PNB 
supported catalyst system is given. We have considered the progressive efforts 
made in the area of catalyst preparation, properties, catalytic applications including 
its catalytic performance and recyclability, since 2005. In terms of content, we 
chose to include a few representative articles published on the topic of PIB 
and PNB supported catalyst in addition of research available so as to give 
an overview. 
2. Modes of isobutylene and norbornene 
polymerization 
PIB can be classified on the basis of their molecular weight as low molecular 
weight PIB (Mn <5000 g/mol), medium molecular weight PIB (Mn = 10,000-
100,000 g/mol), and high molecular weight PIB (Mn >100,000 g/mol). Amongst 
them, low molecular weight PIB is the most demanding in the market and is 
available as highly reactive (HR) PIB and “conventional” PIB. HR PIB is 
primarily composed of terminal exo-olefin groups while the “conventional” PIB 
holds predominantly internal tri- and tetra-substituted olefinic end groups and is 
thus found to be less reactive (Alves et al. 2021). For the mode of polymerization, 
different cationic polymerization approaches have been accomplished in the last 
few decades. Particularly, the chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) in non-polar 
solvents using Lewis acid-ether complexes (LA-ether) has gained interest for the 
polymerization method (Figure 1) (Rajasekhar et al. 2017, 2020).
There are three ways to polymerize bicyclo [2.2.1] hept-2-ene, often known as
norbornene (NB), and its derivatives (Figure 2). Each path results in a particular 
form of polymer and may be distinguished from one another by the catalyst used. 
The ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), which is technically used  
144 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Figure 1. Modes of isobutylene (IB) polymerization 
Figure 2. Modes of norbornene (NB) polymerization 
in the Norsorex method, is the most well-known NB polymerization technique 
(Ohm and Vial 1978). This highly controlled polymerization method enables 
tuning of the metal loading as well as the solubility of the produced catalysts. 
The majority of these catalysts are, in fact, soluble in the reaction media, but 
they are easily recoverable by adding diethyl ether or ethyl acetate to the 
catalyst solution. Figure 2 shows a schematic illustration of the three distinct 
NB polymerization processes (Frank et al. 2018, Xu et al. 2017). Other technical 
ROMP methods usually utilize metal halides, tungsten, molybdenum, rhenium 
or ruthenium and metal oxides or metal oxo-chlorides along with alkylating
agents (e.g. R4Sn, EtAlCl2) and promoting agents (e.g. O2, EtOH, PhOH). 
Academic ROMP research has concentrated on molecular single-component 
catalysts with metal-carbene complexes playing a key role, whereas commercial 
catalysts are typically heterogeneous. The complexes of tungsten, molybdenum, 
and ruthenium with carbenes are a few examples. There have been reports of 
the potential for ring-opening metathesis polymerization of NB using catalyst 
systems based on titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, 
osmium, and rhenium. The cationic and radical polymerizations of NB are poorly 
understood. The outcome is a low molecular mass oligomeric material with 
2,7-connectivity of the monomer. tert-Butyl peracetate, tert-butyl perpivalate, 
or azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN) were some examples of initiators for the radical Polyisobutylene and Polynorbornenes-supported Catalysts 145 
polymerization. Ethylalmunium dichloride (EtAlCl2) was used to launch the 
cationic polymerization. Additionally, NB can be polymerized while preserving 
the bicyclic structural unit, i.e. by just opening the double bond of the component. 
Vinyl or addition polymerization is the term used for this type of polymerization, 
which is similar to the traditional olefin polymerization. There are no longer any 
double bonds in the vinyl addition product. NB’s vinyl polymerization can be 
either a homo- or a copolymerization (Alentiev and Bermeshev 2022, Blank and 
Janiak 2009).
3. Polyisobutylene-supported catalysts 
Utilising polymer-supported catalysts to remove metal species from a reaction 
mixture is a successful approach. The fascinating terminal vinyl group is a key 
characteristic of PIB, which can easily be modified and utilized for numerous 
organic syntheses as catalyst support. A number of researchers have made 
efforts in this direction e.g. Hongfa and his co-researchers reported PIB as a 
catalyst support in thermomorphic system and used it for Pd catalyzed cross￾coupling reactions (Hongfa et al. 2007). The PIB terminus was attached to the 
sulfur-carbon-sulfur ligand and phosphine ligand which are used to prepare 
Pd complexes 1 and 2 (Bergbreiter et al. 2000, Bergbreiter and Sung 2006). 
The obtained catalysts were used to perform Heck, Sonogashira, and allylic 
substitution reactions with good recyclability. In their study, PIB is also used 
to support chiral bisoxazoloine ligands for copper-catalyzed cyclopropanation 
reactions (Bergbreiter and Tian 2007). 
In subsequent work, a PIB-supported RCM catalyst (3) and a chromium￾based polycarbonate polymerization catalyst (4) have been reported (Hongfa et 
al. 2008). Both of these catalysts exhibited similar activity to their unanchored 
counterparts, and can easily be recovered for reuse used without any appreciable 
loss of activity. Another report also mentioned the use of PIB-supported Cu(I) 
complex (5) for ATRP polymerization of styrene. Additionally, β-diketone ligands
were also prepared in only two steps using PIB methyl ketone enolate as a
nucleophile and readily available low molecular weight carbonyl compounds (ester 
or acid chloride) as the electrophile. Further, the ligand was subjected to undergo 
an exchange reaction with Ni(OAc)2 or Co(OAc)2 for the formation of PIB￾supported Ni and Co complex (6) which is used as a catalyst for the epoxidation 
reaction. Bergbreiter et al. prepared PIB-bound 10-N-phenylphenothiazine (PIB￾PTH) photoredox catalyst (7) (Liang and Bergbreiter 2016). This organocatalyst 
bounded PIB is effective in the light-mediated radical polymerization reactions 
of the acrylate monomers, has good catalytic activity, is recyclable, and provides 
modest control over the polymer molecular weight and polydispersity. 
PIB oligomers can bind to N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) in various 
ways and form metal complexes that are phase selective soluble in heptane of 
thermomorphic mixtures of heptane and polar solvents. The prepared PIB-NHC 
complex is known as Hoveyda-Grubbs-type catalysts (8/9). The first synthesis 146 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts

Polyisobutylene and Polynorbornenes-supported Catalysts 147 
and application of the Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst was described in 2007 (Hongfa 
et al. 2007, Su et al. 2010). These catalysts are used for ring-closing metathesis 
reactions of dienes affording >90% average yield. In the catalytic reactions, the 
recoverability/recyclability was executed by ICP-MS analysis (Bano et al. 2022). 
In 2011, PIB-supported N-heterocyclic carbene catalyst, N,N-dialkyl and N,N￾bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl) (10/11) were prepared and successfully employed to 
form palladium cross-coupling catalysts (Scheme 1). 
The ligand exchange of PIB-COOH with Rh2(OAc)4 in refluxing toluene
produced the PIB-supported Rh(II) carboxylate catalyst 12. The cyclopropanation 
of octene with ethyl diazoacetate in cyclohexane or heptane worked well with this
catalyst 12. In 2007, Bergbreiter and Tian performed a post-reaction extraction 
with ethylene glycol diacetate (EGDA), the polymer-supported catalyst 12 was 
easily separated and recovered (Bergbreiter and Tian 2007). The synthesis of the 
poly isobutylene-derived BIAN-IMes-based H-G2 catalyst 13 (Scheme 1) was 
reported by Bazzi and colleagues in 2016. The benefit of polyisobutylene tether 
is the ability to recycle the catalyst through the use of a non-polar solvent for the 
reaction and acetonitrile for the extraction process. Furthermore, catalyst 13 was 
used to produce high molecular weight polymers by polymerizing norbornene 
derivatives with a ring-opening reaction (Suriboot et al. 2016). A C–N cross￾coupling utilizing catalyst 14 immobilized on PIB was recently described by
Suriboot and colleagues as the Buchwald-Hartwig amination process (Chen et 
al. 2021). Chao and Bergbreiter reported an efficient recyclable homogeneous
catalyst (15) using a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoMPc) that contains covalently 
linked PIB groups as phase anchors in a semithermomorphic system (Chao and 
Bergbreiter 2016). 
4. Polynorbornenes-supported catalysts 
Pd(II) pincer complexes (SCS, NCN, PCP) are among the most promising and 
well-defined transition metal catalysts for carbon-carbon coupling processes 
(Scheme 2). Through the use of either amide or urea linkages, PCP and SCS￾pincer Pd(II) complexes have been covalently immobilized on the soluble PIB 
and PNB substrates (Yu et al. 2005). 
In this context, the Jones research group developed a five step process to get 
desired product as PNB-immobilized SCS-N pincer Pd(II) complex (16) using 
the SCS-NH2 complex and cyclobutadiene as starting material in 82% yield.
Because of the presence of amide bond in this polymer, the supports are readily 
soluble under reaction conditions (Yu et al. 2004). Sommer et al. developed the 
soluble PNBs PCP pincer Pd(II) complexes 17 and 18 starting from palladium 
containing monomers (Anna et al. 2013, Yu et al. 2005). In 2006, NHC was 
used as the ligand rather than a SCS pincer by Weck and Sommer when they
developed a PNB-supported Pd catalyst (19/20) using the same ROMP method 
(Sommer and Weck 2006). In another approach, Weck and co-workers reported 
the development and applications of a number of PNB supported metal (Mn/Co/ 148 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts

kinetic resolutions (HKR), asymmetric epoxidations, and conjugate additions of 
cyanide (Madhavan et al. 2008). Based on a sequential click/ROMP approach, 
a nanomagnetic cobalt/carbon core-shell-based NB polymeric tag ligand was 
developed by Reiser and colleagues in 2010 (catalyst 26) (Schätz et al. 2010).

150 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Although NHCs serve as effective ligands for metals such as palladium,
the free carbenes are unstable substances that can be challenging to work with. 
However, carbon dioxide can act as a protective group for carbenes (Bantu et al. 
2009). In a solid phase setting, Pawar and Buchmeiser used this useful technique 
to create a carbon dioxide adduct of a tetrahydropyrimidine-derived carbene 
attached to a polymeric support. This in situ preparation involved the ring-opening 
metathesis of a pendant NB functionality attached to the protected carbene. The 
protected polymer-bound ligand was subsequently changed into a supported metal 
complex, where the metal might be palladium, iridium, or rhodium but palladium 
supported catalyst 27 shows effective catalytic activity in carbon-carbon coupling
reactions (Pawar and Buchmeiser 2010). 
Sagamanova et al. reported the preparation of PNB-supported proline 28a–d 
and 29 and their application as catalysts in the direct asymmetric aldol reaction. 
These catalysts (28a–d and 29) were prepared by using the ω-bromoalkyl
functionalized PNB as starting reactant (Sagamanova et al. 2015). In 2017, 
a nonpolar phase tag was incorporated by Fredlund et al. to develop phase￾selectively soluble PNB support (30) in 82% yield. In contrast to existing ROMP￾based supports that rely on wasteful solvent precipitations, these catalytic supports 
have a high selectivity for nonpolar solvents compared to their polar counterparts 
and can be recovered and reused five times in their analysis (Fredlund et al. 2017).
An influential, PNB-supported ruthenium based catalyst 31 for ring closing 
metathesis was introduced by Sommer and Weck in 2006. In order to produce 
polymers having 1,4,7-triazacyclononane moieties, manganese-loaded PNB
based support 32 was investigated and successfully employed for epoxidation 
of alkene using H2O2 as oxidant. Further for comparison study for epoxidation 
of PNB supported salen, catalysts 33 were developed using a modular approach, 
much like supported triazacyclononane catalysts (32) (Ju et al. 2019). A different 
approach utilized by the researchers to produce an effective PNB based catalyst 
34, the R-salen and R-pybox monomers were copolymerized. In this case, two 
salen catalysts attached to the same polymer backbone were cooperating in a
bimetallic transition state. 
5. Applications of polyisobutylene and 
polynorbornenes-supported catalysts 
5.1 Coupling reactions 
Heck, Suzuki, and Sonogashira’s transition-metal-catalyzed processes for 
carbon-carbon coupling reactions have undergone extensive development for 
their various significant synthetic applications such as versatile precursors in 
the total synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, functional materials, 
conducting polymers, among others (Sutthasupa et al. 2010, Yu et al. 2005). 
However, coupling reactions driven by polymer-supported catalysts have 
revealed a growing interest in the design and development of environmentally  
 
Polyisobutylene and Polynorbornenes-supported Catalysts 151 
benign and economically advantageous catalytic systems in the form of 
supported metal nanoparticles or supported metal complexes. In this section, 
some of the following soluble PIB and PNB based metal complexes as catalysts 
are summarized below. 
5.1.1 The Heck coupling 
In the Heck reaction, an organohalide (aryl or vinyl halides) is cross-coupled 
with an alkene in the presence of a base to produce a substituted alkene as 
shown in Scheme 4. Metal-catalyzed reactions are hazardous to the environment 
and challenging to control. Also, leaching of Pd catalyst is a very tedious task. 
To overcome these issues, various polymer-supported catalysts have been used 
in this coupling reaction. In light of this, (PIB)-supported NHC-Pd complexes 10 
and 11 reported by Bergbreiter et al. exhibited high activity in the Heck coupling 
reaction. Catalyst 10 could be recycled upto 10 runs (1 mol% of Pd, 75°C) and 
6 runs (130°C) with high yields; however, catalyst 11 showed a sharp decline 
in yield in the second run. The breakdown of 11 under the described reaction 
circumstances is the key factor for such an observation (Bergbreiter et al. 2011b, 
Suriboot et al. 2016). In the Heck coupling of iodobenzene and acrylic acid or 
methyl acrylate, the PIB-supported SCS complex 1 was utilized. The highly 
active aryl iodides were the sole compounds with which this catalyst worked, as 
was the case with earlier supported SCS-Pd(II) species. Better results were while 
working with the phosphine complexed 2 species with 90-92% yields.
Scheme 4. Representation of Heck coupling reaction
In 2005, Jones and his co-researchers’ soluble PNB supported SCS-pincer PdII 
catalyst (16) was reported for Heck coupling reaction of iodobenzene with butyl 
acrylate in 99% yield within one hour. However, pincer complexes only served as
precatalysts for soluble Pd species, according to the results of poisoning studies 
using Hg(0) and poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVPy) instead of leaching of the complex.
A year later, Weck and Sommer utilized the same methodology to synthesize a 
PNB-supported Pd catalyst (19/20) but they substituted SCS pincer with a NHC 
as the ligand. In the Heck, Suzuki and Sonagashira coupling reactions, all three 
synthesized PNB-supported Pd-NHC catalysts (20a-c) had the same activity as 
their tiny monomer predecessors. 
It has been established that the Heck reaction could be successfully carried out
using the most effective PNB-based catalyst (19a). In 2010, Pawar and Bucheister
reported carbon dioxide adduct of a tetrahydropyrimidine-derived carbene attached  
152 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
to a polymeric support. The complex catalyst’s protected polymer-bound ligand 
contains PNB as a polymer support in addition to palladium metal species. 
Furthermore, the Heck reaction of styrene and butyl acrylate with various aryl 
bromides was found to be particularly well-catalyzed by the palladium-supported 
complex 27, with turnover numbers as high as 100,000 (TOF 25,000). Herein, PIB 
and PNB based catalysts utilized for Heck coupling are summarized in Table 1.
5.1.2 Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling 
The Suzuki Coupling process, which is the cross-coupling of boric acid and its 
esters with organohalides in the presence of solvent, is depicted in Scheme 5. This 
coupling process was discovered in 1979 by Akira Suzuki, who was awarded 
the Nobel Prize in 2010. In following work, PIB-supported chromium-based 
polycarbonate (4) catalyzed the reaction of iodobenzene and phyenylboronic 
acid to obtain Suzuki coupling product. This catalyst exhibited similar activity 
to their unanchored counterparts, and can easily be recovered for reuse without 
appreciable loss of activity. The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of 
haloarenes with arylboronic acid in THF/water in the presence of Na2CO3 
was carried out at 65°C using PNB supported hybrid magnetic nanoparticles 
(26). According to Reiser et al., the yield for the coupling product of a few 
iodo- and bromoarenes was high (86–96%) but the yield for chlorobenzene 
was significantly lower (38%). Catalyst recycling can be accomplished with 
ease by using an external magnetic field due to the magnetic moment of 
Co/C nanoparticles (Schätz et al. 2010). In 2006, Weck and Sommer reported 
synthesized PNB-supported Pd-NHC catalysts (20a-c) for remarkable activity 
with chloroarenes, including sterically hindered substrates and the extremely 
challenging 2-bromopyridines. One of the catalysts’ key features is that it 
produces the relevant coupling products in good to excellent yields. 
Scheme 5. Demonstration of Suzuki coupling reaction
It has also been shown that palladium precursors can induce polymer￾supported NHC-based metal catalysts through ring-opening metathesis. Polymers 
19a-c and 20a-c were produced by copolymerizing substituted NB co-monomer 
with palladium-based monomers in various ratios. Each of the six supported 
palladium catalysts was used to perform the Suzuki coupling reactions (19a-c
and 20a-c). Isolated yields of 80–99% for all the substrates were attained (Karimi
et al. 2013). The examples provided in this coupling reaction (Table 2), which 
is based on PIB and PNB-based catalysts, clearly demonstrate how crucial and 153 Polyisobutylene and Polynorbornenes-supported Catalysts Table 1.

even inevitable it is to use this technique as a significant tool in the process of 
organic synthesis of biologically important compounds. 
5.1.3 Sonogashira Coupling 
The Sonogashira Coupling was proposed by N. Hagihara, Y. Tohda and Kenkichi 
Sonogashira in 1975. Sonogashira Coupling reaction is an extention of Cassar 
and Dieck and Heck reactions. It is a process of cross-coupling reaction of a 
terminal alkyne and an aryl or vinyl halide by utilizing palladium catalyst as well 
as copper co-catalyst to form carbon–carbon bonds in organic synthesis (Scheme 
6). In the Sonagashira alkyne-arene coupling chemistry, the PIB-PPh2-ligated 
Pd(0) complex 2 had good activity. In a heptane DMA thermomorphic system, 
Sonagashira reactions were conducted, and recycling was accomplished by the 
system’s simple cooling and phase separation (Table 3). Weck and Sommer in 
2006 utilized the PNB-supported Pd catalyst with an NHC as the ligand. All 
three of the synthesized PNB-anchored Pd-NHC catalysts (20a-c) have the same 
activity as their small monomer for the Sonagashira coupling process (Sommer 
and Weck 2006).
Scheme 6. Illustration of Sonogashira coupling reaction 
5.2 Epoxidation 
The epoxidation reaction of the C=C is one of the most powerful and versatile 
synthetic chemistry methods, from the laboratory to the industrial scale. It 
is used to produce bulk compounds like ethylene oxide and propylene oxide 
as well as fine chemicals with high added value (i.e. epoxidized terpenes). 
A range of reagents, including as air oxidation, hypochlorous acid, hydrogen 
peroxide, and organic peracids, are used in the chemical process known as 
epoxidation to convert the carbon-carbon double bond into oxiranes (epoxides). 
The choice is based on the substrate type, the features of the catalyst being 
used, as well as the process’s safety, efficacy, and long-term viability. Several 
efforts have been made to develop polymer-supported epoxidation catalysts and 
comprehensive reviews of polymer-supported epoxidation catalysts in general 
have been published. The most recent chapter concerning polymer-supported 
metal complex epoxidation catalysts in particular appeared in 2008 (Arnold 
2008). It should be emphasized that only three polymer types account for around 
80% of the documented epoxidation catalysts. About 65% of the researched 
catalytic systems are based on polystyrene, and remaining 15% are made of 
polymethacrylate, and poly (ethylene glycol). The trend in recent research  
 
156 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
toward developing soluble polymer-supported catalysts has grown in popularity. 
Using a range of thermosetting supports, such as PNB, polybenzimidazole, and 
polyimide, intriguing results have already been obtained. 
In order to produce polymers having 1,4,7-triazacyclononane moieties, NB 
connected to the azacycle was subjected to ring-opening metathesis polymerization 
(ROMP). For the epoxidation of alkene using H2O2 as the oxidant, manganese￾loaded PNB based support (32) was investigated. High activity under mild reaction 
conditions comparable to or even superior to that of the monomeric complex 
was reported. Additionally, for comparing the reusability and recyclability of 
the catalyst, manganese (II) Schiff base complexes supported on a styrene-DVB 
copolymer were studied, but their activity in the epoxidation of cyclooctene and 
NB with tert-butyl hydroperoxide was modest and decreases with recycling. 
According to a report, PNB supported salen catalysts [33] were developed 
using a modular approach, much like supported triazacyclononane catalysts [32]. 
For this, ring-opening metathesis polymerization was used to create a manganese￾salen complex coupled to a NB monomer. When m-CPBA/N-methylmorpholine￾N-oxide (NMO) was used as the oxidant, the resultant polymers and copolymers 
demonstrated strong catalytic activity and enantioselectivity; however, a 
notable drop in activity and selectivity was noted upon catalyst recycling in the 
epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (Table 4) (Ju et al. 2019).
5.3 Miscellaneous 
In 2013, Anna et al. reported the activity of polymer-supported Al salen-complex 
(25) for the enantioselective 1,4-addition reaction of cyanide to various α,β￾unsaturated imides obtaining high yields in each case (between 88 and 96%) 
along with high ee (98 or 99%). In only one case, the yield was low (22%) 
when tert-butyl-substituted imide was used as substrates. With the exception of 
the tert-butyl-substituted imide substrate, compound 25 was both more active 
and selective than its unsupported analogue, even with a metal loading of just 5 
mol% (as compared to 15 mol% for the unsupported analogue). They proposed 
that the flexible backbone increased the concentration of local catalysts, hence 
enhancing catalytic activity. Additionally, the enantioselectivity and activity 
of catalyst 25 may be recycled up to five times without any significant loss 
of activity. 
In another study, two salen catalysts mounted onto the same polymer 
backbone were cooperating in a bimetallic transition state. The R-salen monomer
and the R-pybox monomer were copolymerized to create catalyst 34. Seven
carbon atom linkers were chosen for both monomers because they allowed
the best interactions between the two catalytic PNB-supported salen centres 
that were required for the transformation. To evaluate the catalytic activity of 
polynorborene catalyst 34, cyanide addition to alpha-beta unsaturated imide was 
deployed, and 88% of the isolated yield with 80% ee was obtained. WithoutPolyisobutylene and Polynorbornenes-supported Catalysts 157 Table 3.

any significant conversion losses, the catalyst remained in the reaction flask and 
was reported to be utilized for three cycles. With each consecutive cycle, ee 
decreased, showing a reduction in catalytic selectivity that could be attributable 
to the degradation of chiral pybox ligand. Compound 30 was employed in DMAP 
assisted Boc protection of 2,6-dimethylphenol yielding 92% of the product in less
than 20 minutes. Through copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC)
reactions, L-proline derivatives have been immobilized onto PNB support to 
create PNB supported catalysts (28a-d and 29), which are employed for the direct 
asymmetric aldol reaction of cyclohexanone with p-nitrobenzaldehyde in aqueous 
medium (Sagamanova et al. 2015, Salvo et al. 2016). 
An efficient recyclable homogeneous catalyst (15) for the reduction of 
nitroarene utilising hydrazine hydrate as a reducing reagent was demonstrated 
using a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoMPc) that contains covalently linked PIB groups
as phase anchors in a semithermomorphic system at 110°C and is highly soluble 
in both nonpolar and polar organic solvents. Several solvents were used, but the 
best results were obtained with an equivolume mixture of ethylene glycol and 
heptane (Chao and Bergbreiter 2016). 
Furthermore, allylic substitution of cinnamyl acetate by secondary amines in 
a latent biphasic system was successfully accomplished using a PIB-supported 
Pd catalyst 25. In this instance, the separation was accomplished by adding 10 
vol% water to a mixture of EtOH and heptane solvent that was utilized at room 
temperature. This catalyst for allylic substitution was successfully recycled five 
times. The Pd(0) complex 2 with PIB-PPh2-ligation displayed good activity in 
the allylic substitution process. In order to produce biphasic conditions and phase 
separation, the allylic substitution reactions were carried out in heptane-EtOH 
latent biphasic systems. The catalyst was reused and recycled in this setting 
(Priyadarshani et al. 2013). 
In Buchwalde-Hartwig aryl amination process, the PIB-bound catalyst 11 was 
initially tested. At 80°C in either heptane or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 4-bromotoluene
underwent full conversion to N-(4-methylphenyl)morpholine in 20 minutes
with a 1 mol% catalyst. Ring opening of epoxides with thiols catalysed by
PIB-supported salen Cr(III) 4 at room temperature for 24 h gives the desired
product (Bergbreiter et al. 2011a). Recently, Bazzi and colleagues described the 
Buchwald-Hartwig amination process as a Palladium-BIAN-NHC-catalyzed C–N 
cross-coupling using catalyst 14 immoblized on PIB. Easy catalyst separation in 
a biphasic heptane/acetonitrile combination is a practical benefit of PIB-tagging. 
However, in comparison to the similar imidazolylidene-based catalyst, Pd-BIAN￾NHC catalyst 14 shows somewhat reduced reactivity under the studied reaction 
conditions (Chen et al. 2021). PNB-supported complex 31 (3 mol% loading)
was reported for the ring closing metathesis of Diethyl malonate (DEM) in the 
presence of dichloromethane (DCM) solvent at 45°C to get the desired product 
(Table 5) (Sommer and Weck 2006).Polyisobutylene and Polynorbornenes-supported Catalysts 159 Table 5.

6. Summary and future prospects 
In conclusion, this literature review’s findings indicate that PIB and PNB 
oligomers are effective non-polar phase-selective supports that can serve as both 
a catalytic support and a ligand used in catalytic chemistry. These catalysts’
molecular building blocks are adaptable by nature, making it possible to 
systematically alter their catalytic performance. Another interesting feature of 
these catalysts was shown to be separable from the product by straightforward 
filtration or by precipitation after addition of a small amount of solvent, in the 
case where the supported catalyst is soluble in the reaction medium. These 
catalysts demonstrated high efficiency and/or excellent selectivity in a variety 
of reactions. Without losing activity or selectivity, the recovered catalyst is 
frequently able to be employed in additional cycles. This would not only make 
it easier to understand the catalyst’s structure and conduct additional mechanistic 
research on pertinent reactions, but it might also result in the creation of brand￾new single-site catalysts for highly selective synthesis. 
The supporting catalyst’s solubility characteristics are also highly significant.
While heterogeneously supported catalysts are typically thought to be more 
stable, manageable, and easily recovered and recycled, a homogenous catalytic 
system is expected to be more reactive, stereochemically more efficient, and more
dependable in reproducibility. Although there is no perfect support, one must 
choose the right one for each unique catalytic system. In this regard, substantial 
advancement may result from the multidisciplinary expertise being developed 
with the assistance of organic and inorganic material chemists, particularly in 
the area of polymeric materials. 
Furthermore, recently reported PIB/PNB based catalysts, which combine 
organic polymers with inorganic components, offer new opportunities for the
development of hybrid and effective polymer-support for carbon-carbon coupling
reactions, carbon-nitrogen coupling reactions, epoxidation catalysts, and other 
catalysts. It can be predicted that catalytic systems based on alternative polymers 
still have a lot of potential.

1. Introduction 
Philippe Gengembre (1783) observed phosphine, an inorganic compound, by 
heating phosphorus in an aqueous solution of K2CO3. The unique element 
phosphorus plays crucial roles in both organic and inorganic chemistry. Its 
ability to readily transition into +3 and +5 oxidation states and form three and 
five covalent bonds with carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen is largely 
attributable to its versatility in synthetic applications (Methot et al. 2004). It is 
a colorless gas with a rotten-fish odor, highly poisonous, sparingly soluble in 
water, soluble in organic solvents, and it acts as a Lewis base by donating its 
lone pair of electrons when it reacts with hydrogen iodide to function as a Lewis 
base. PH3 is a major component of the Holme signal. Phosphine fumigants are a 
typical household product used to limit the invasion of pests, rats, and rabbits in a 
wide variety of stored grains. In addition, phosphine is utilized as a doping agent 
for n-type semiconductors, a polymerization initiator, a condensation catalyst, 
and a polymer-supported reagent in the fabrication of flame retardants for cotton 
fabrics. (Salmeia et al. 2016). The majority of the molecules used in the polymer 
chemistry of phosphorus have stable C-P bonds, or they are inorganic acids or 
their derivatives. These phosphorus-containing compounds are few in number 
compared to other organic polymers (Strasser and Teasdale 2020).

Polyphosphazene, also referred to as an inorganic rubber, was the first
synthetic rubber that was recorded by Stokes in 1897. Its technological
potential was first overlooked. However, in recent years, a growing interest in 
organophosphine polymers has been noticed, which is certainly related to their 
significant contribution to science and industry. These polymers have unique
properties such as medical sector, anticorrosive compounds, flame retardant,
metal ions removal from wastewater etc. (Chauhan and Chundawat 2019). 
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that phosphorus-containing compounds 
can improve material solubility (hydrophilicity), adhesion, biocompatibility, and 
biodegradability. Different chemical properties of phosphine based compounds 
are depicted in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Different chemical properties based on phosphine based compounds 
Non-cross-linked polystyrene was used in 1983 as the base polymer for 
making poly(styryldiphenylphosphine), which had a phosphine loading of 2.7–
3.0 mmol per gram of polymer. This was the first report of a soluble polymer-

supported phosphine. It’s interesting to note that the polymer-supported 
phosphine’s efficiency in producing alkyl chlorides from an alcohol and carbon
tetrachloride was found to be comparable to poly(styryldiphenylphosphine) 
cross-linked with divinylbenzene. Initially, the reaction’s starting linear
polystyrene was soluble, but once the reaction was complete, the polymer
precipitated, allowing for filtration-based purification; however, after long-term
storage, the polymeric reagent appeared to cross-link and become insoluble.
It has been reported that a triphenylphosphine reagent on NCPS has been 
further improved for a Staudinger/aza-Wittig process, with better outcomes 
than the reagent’s insoluble-polymer variant. 
In a subsequent study, this second-generation reagent was used in the
highly regioselective SN2 ’ Mitsunobu reaction to synthesize E-tri-substituted
alkenes from Baylis-Hillman adducts. Interestingly, the soluble polymer-bound 
reagent significantly outperformed triphenylphosphine in this reaction in terms 
of regioselectivity. 
2. Synthetic methods 
In Suzuki reactions, palladium-supported triphenylphosphine-functionalized 
microporous knitting aryl network polymers (Pd@KAPs(Ph-PPh3)) have 
been employed (Li et al. 2012). It has demonstrated a number of benefits, 
including the ability to prevent the contamination of products with palladium 
and ligand residue, good reusability of the expensive metal and phosphine 
ligand, and an abundance of open micropore and macropore structures that 
are advantageous for catalysis. Palladium supported on triphenylphosphine 
functionalized porous organic polymer (Pd@KAPs(Ph-PPh3)) is reported as 
a catalyst in an effective method for the alkoxycarbonylation of aryl iodides. 
When different aryl iodides are carbonylated with alcohols and phenols under 
CO balloon pressure, the corresponding products are produced in moderate to 
excellent yields (74–96%) (Lei et al. 2015). 
By incorporating [(Me2S)AuCl] into a phosphine-based hyper-cross-linked 
polymer, Shen and coworkers developed a neutral gold(I) complex, Au@HCPs￾PPh3, which has been shown to be an effective and versatile heterogeneous catalyst
for the regioselective hydration of a number of alkynes to ketones (Shen et al. 
2022). For their high catalytic activity and stability, Rh-based catalysts supported 
on porous vinyl triphenylphosphine (3V-PPh3) polymers have been recommended. 
Density functional theory (DFT) was used to examine the formation process
of catalyst active species after CO insertion as well as the mechanism of the
reaction of ethylene hydroformylation to propionaldehyde. However, the effect 
of the carrier-ligand bifunctional interaction of 3V-PPh3 on the mechanism of 
heterogeneous ethylene developed two types of crosslinked 3V-PPh3 supported 
Rh-based catalysts (Xie et al. 2022).  
 
 
 
 
168 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
By reacting 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane and bis(4-fluorophenyl) 
phenylphosphine, phosphine-containing poly(arylene ether)s with three covalent 
bonds phosphorus are developed. In order to prevent partial phosphine derivative 
oxidation during polycondensation, the reaction conditions are changed. In 
contrast, copolymers with high molar contents of phosphine oxide (up to 45
mol-% P = O repeating units) and 85 mol-% repeating units containing phosphine
are produced by solvent-free melt polycondensation of bis(4-fluorophenyl) 
phenylphosphine with bis(trimethylsilyl)-2,2-bis(4-oxyphenyl)propane and CsF 
as catalyst (Satpathi et al. 2020). 
An important part of metal catalysis for chemical transformations at the
industrial and laboratory levels is the hybridization of porous synthetic polymers 
and sophisticated ligands. The high permeability, ease of modification, rapid mass
transfer properties and high stability of a monolithic porous polymer, which is 
a single piece with continuous macropores, are desirable. A monolithic porous 
polystyrene with three-fold cross-linked PPh3 (M-PS-TPP) was developed by
Matsumoto and coworkers for transition-metal catalysis (Matsumoto et al. 2020). 
By using a porogenic solvent to induce phase separation during polymerization, 
the monolithic and macroporous structure of M-PS-TPP was achieved. Suzuki￾Miyaura cross-coupling of chloroarenes, a difficult Pd-catalyzed reaction, was
made easier by the macroporous characteristics and controlled mono-P-ligating 
behavior of M-PS-TPP. 
By using azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator in solution
polymerization, 4-(diphenylphosphino) styrene (DPPS), di(ethylene glycol)
methyl ether methacrylate (DEGMA), and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether
methacrylate (OEGMA300), a copolymer with an average molecular weight of 300,
was developed. Different lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) were used 
to synthesize a series of P(DEGMA-co-DPPS-co-OEGMA300) copolymers. The 
Suzuki-Miyaura reaction was successfully carried out in water in the presence of 
the thermoresponsive copolymer-supported palladium catalyst (Chen et al. 2019). 
The Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction has been used to develop a “one-pot”
method for synthesizing polymer-supported phosphine-Pd catalyst.
A “one-pot” strategy has been developed for the synthesis of polymer￾supported phosphine-Pd catalyst using Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction. On
the skeleton of the polymer containing phosphine, the fine and uniform Pd
nanoparticles were evenly distributed. In the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction 
with the mild conditions and water-ethanol mixed media, this Pd catalyst
demonstrated excellent catalytic activity and recycling performance (Chen 
et al. 2017). 
In order to catalyze the homogeneous enantioselective hydroarylation of aryl
allyl ethers and produce the benzene-fused cyclic skeletons that are frequently 
found in pharmaceuticals, natural alkaloids, and fascinating building blocks in 
organic synthesis, Xu and coworkers developed the Pd/Xu-Phos system (Zhang  
 
 
 
Polymer-supported Phosphine Reagents 169 
et al. 2018). In heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis, the immobilization of Pd/Xu￾Phos catalyst can also demonstrate exceptional catalytic performance. However, 
the Xu-Phos chiral ligand has a greater steric hindrance than the previous polymer￾bound chiral gold catalyst, which makes it more difficult to immobilize, and the 
ligand with more electron density is more susceptible to oxidation (Zhang et al. 
2023). Furthermore, the coordination becomes more complicated and difficult to 
control due to the Pd catalyst with bidentate chelation (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Immobilization of polymer-supported Xu-Phos to form polymer-supported 
palladium based complexes having excellent catalytic activity, higher cross linking degree 
and good recyclability (Zhang et al. 2023) 
Phosphine-based conjugated hyper crosslinked polymer (PPh3-CHCP) 
photocatalyst and its use in the development of the first large-scale, persistent Cu￾ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization) powered by sunlight with a limited 
O2 tolerance (without a deoxygenation procedure) (Fang et al. 2023). Reversible 
addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization was used to produce a 
polymer with the bis(hydroxymethyl)phosphine oxide pendant group from a
phosphine-containing monomer, 4-vinylbenzyl-bis-hydroxymethyl phosphine
oxide (VBzBHPO) (Sun et al. 2021). The structure and 1H NMR spectrum is 
depicted in Figure 3. 
Dichloromethane has been used as a solvent in the synthesis of coordination 
polymers based on diethyl-1-(pyridine-2-yl)phosphine and copper (I) 
iodide. According to Scheme 1, by the previously described method,
diethylpyridylphosphine was produced in a two-step reaction that was set up
with primary phosphine PyPH2 (Enikeeva et al. 2023). 
The electronic and steric influences on phosphine, amine, and phosphine
oxide moieties are systematically investigated for terpolymerization in a series 
of [P,O]-type cationic Pd and Ni complexes developed by Li and coworkers and 
supported by a diphosphazane monoxide (PNPO) platform (Li et al. 2023). 170 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts

3. Applications 
Applications for polymer-supported reagents in synthetic organic chemistry are 
numerous. As a result, Ley has effectively demonstrated the use of supported 
reagents in medicinal chemistry by the multi-step synthesis of pharmacological 
targets and natural products like sildenafil (Viagra), epimaritidine, and 
epibatidine (Baxendale et al. 2000). Using polymer-supported reagents is an 
increasingly common approach in the field of organic synthesis, particularly in

polymers with copper. 
the pharmaceutical industry. As a result of the catalysts being immobilized on 
polymers via covalent or coordination interactions in recent years, a significant 
number of polymer-supported Lewis acids have been developed. These acids are 
frequently utilized in synthetic organic chemistry. 
Phosphine-functionalized polymer reagents are frequently used in
organic synthesis, particularly in Mitsunobu, Wittig, Aza-Wittig and,
Staudinger reaction-type processes (Xie et al. 2021, 2022). Functional group 
transformations are frequently carried out under mild reaction conditions 
and pH neutrality by taking advantage of P(III)’s strong affinity for oxygen
and nitrogen. Because the phosphorus atom is rarely incorporated into the 
product during organic synthesis, the production of phosphorus by-products 
is unavoidable. These are notoriously difficult to remove, especially if the desired
product is very polar. Immobilizing organophosphorus reagents on insoluble solid
supports is therefore particularly appealing because it makes it simple to remove 
and recover the phosphorus reagents (and their by-products) via simple filtration.
Polymer-supported polystyryldiphenylphosphine (PS-PPh2), an analogue of 
the common triphenylphosphine (PPh3), is one of the most useful reagents that 
may be credited for various chemical reactions. The latter is a frequently used 
chemical reagent that, in numerous instances, is oxidized to triphenylphosphine 172 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
oxide (Ph3PO). Ph3PO must be removed from the product via expensive 
chromatographic separation and/or crystallization procedures, making PPh3 
worthless. Triphenylphosphine supported by polystyrene was made available as 
an alternative. This reagent has an advantage over its soluble equivalent in that it 
may be filtered to remove it from any oxidation byproducts. The reagent can be 
prepared in a single step and is conveniently supplied by a number of chemical 
suppliers (100–200 mesh, labelling extent: ~3 mmol g-1 triphenylphosphine 
loading). 
To bind transition metals and explore potential electrocatalytic uses, porous 
organic polymers with phosphine oxide groups have been developed. As mono￾and di-phosphine monomers with numerous phenyl substituents were cross-linked,
the Friedel-Crafts reaction and the oxidation process were used to develop
phosphine oxide porous polymers with up to 0.92 cm3/g of pore capacity and 
about 990 m2/g of surface area (Bonfant et al. 2022). Different porous polymers 
having phosphine oxide units are depicted in Fig. 4. 
Figure 4. Porous polymers having phosphine oxide moieties (Bonfant et al. 2022) 
4. Conclusion 
Phosphine based polymer-supported catalysts are very promising candidates 
for organic functional group conversions. These catalysts have high catalytic 
activity and superior cycling stability. It exhibits various catalytic activities Polymer-supported Phosphine Reagents 173 
towards various reactions including reduction, cross-coupling (Suzuki-Miyaura, 
Heck coupling), hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes etc.

1. Introduction 
Catalysis is an indispensable technology, and since the idea of catalyst-mediated 
chemical transformation has been established, it has been evolving continuously. 
Catalysis has become a critical pursuit for chemistry, and the improvements in 
catalyst-based synthesis methodologies increase the efficiency and sustainability 
of chemical synthesis while reducing byproducts and wastes (Chorkendorff and 
Niemantsverdriet 2017). The trending modern chemical processes usually do 
not feature several green synthesis principles. A careful process design including 
several vital strategies, methodologies, and techniques can develop a chemical 
process that would be safe, customarily dependent on renewable resources, 
and efficient in energy and waste generation, which is evident through various 
examples available in the literature. A catalyst can alternate to every required 
parameter to perform chemical transformations. It can play a central role by 
aiming to use safer and cost-effective chemicals, increasing the atom economy 
of the reaction, and reducing the number of steps for the synthesis. It is always 
a necessity to innovate catalytic technologies. 
The fundamental categories of catalysts, i.e. homogeneous and heterogeneous 
catalysts, have pros and cons. The heterogeneous catalysts are of more importance 
to the industries, although homogeneous catalysts can be fine-tuned to better
selectivity by using suitable ligands. However, it is rarely seen that the presence 
of ligands can provide substantial thermal stability and insensitivity towards air

176 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
and moisture (Joshi et al. 2019, 2020, 2021). This is the foremost reason that 
restricts homogeneous catalysts’ applications in commercial applications. 
The heterogeneous catalysts refer to the type of catalysis in which catalysts 
are not soluble in the reaction media, and because of that, such catalysts can be 
easily separated (Ross 2012, Rase 2016, Urakawa et al. 2021). In addition, the 
heterogeneous catalysts are more tolerant to the extreme reaction conditions of 
heat, pressure and mostly, these catalysts do not show air and moisture sensitivity 
(Astruc et al. 2005). The major drawback the heterogeneous catalysts suffer is 
the desired products’ selectivity. For heterogeneous catalysts, fine-tuning of the 
catalytic properties to achieve a better extent of selectivity requires a significant 
amount of effort and an intelligent design (Somorjai et al. 2009). 
Based on the pros and cons of the known homogeneous and heterogeneous 
catalysts, there is a need for an intermediary alternate that can address the 
issues of both types of catalysis. It is well-known that there are several types of 
intramolecular interactions, which are broadly termed as covalent, non-covalent, 
and encapsulation. Using these properties, there is a possibility to partially 
heterogenise a homogeneous catalyst. Taking this idea of partial heterogenization 
seriously, many research groups are developing transition metal-based catalysts by 
immobilizing them on a support. The covalent interactions, i.e. the ligands of any 
homogeneous complexes, are covalently bound to an insoluble support, ultimately 
producing an immobilized catalyst, while in the non-covalent interactions, 
physisorption, intermolecular hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, or 
Vander Waal forces can induce heterogeneity in the catalyst. Encapsulation is a 
different approach for heterogenization, which involves a physical entrapment
of the catalyst in zeolites, porous polymers, and metal-organic frameworks or 
multitopic ligands. 
Polymers are the most versatile material; since their discovery, their 
applications have increased exponentially. Polymers are an excellent material 
for catalyst support because polymeric supports are nontoxic, nonvolatile, and 
reusable. Polymers as catalyst support can play various roles, depending upon 
the catalyst available. Polymers are the only type of catalytic support which falls 
under all the catalytic supports, i.e. covalent, non-covalent and encapsulation. 
Covalently bonded polymeric supports are most commonly known, while 
encapsulation of nanoparticles in porous via impregnation is often reported. Non￾covalent interaction between metal complexes and polymer support is rarely seen. 
In 1963, an American biochemist Prof. Robert B. Merrifield, introduced the 
concept of polymer-supported catalyst (Merrifield 1963). This proof of concept 
includes synthesizing chloromethylated cross-linked resin by copolymerizing 
styrene and divinylbenzene. This copolymer was used as a support for the peptides. 
Since then, several strategies have been developed and commercialized for organic
synthesis using metal complexes supported on styrene polymers (McNamara et 
al. 2002, Fan et al. 2002, Thomas et al. 2005, Haag et al. 2004). Based on the 
available literature in the past, several approaches have been explored for the 
heterogenization of the catalyst. Some recent reports show the use of organic 
Ruthenium and Iridium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 177 
polymers (Buchmeiser 2005, Lu et al. 2009, Altava et al. 2018), organic-inorganic 
polymers (Li et al. 2014), inorganic bulk supports (Regalbuto 2017), magnetic 
nanoparticles, and nanoparticles (Freire et al. 2012, Rossi et al. 2012). All of 
these reports embrace some excellent research related to catalyst heterogenization. 
Metal complexes as catalysts have made countless contributions to organic 
synthesis. Most metals present in the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition series are excellent 
catalysts, and the main reason is the various achievable oxidation states. Besides 
palladium and rhodium, the most widely used transition metals are used for 
catalysis. Ruthenium and iridium have shown the most comprehensive scope of 
catalytic applications. Ruthenium especially shows stability in the broad range 
of oxidation states (–2 to +8), which is why it is suitable for catalysis (Griffith 
1967). In addition, ruthenium is relatively inexpensive compared to most of 
the 4d and 5d transition metals, having considerable catalytic potential. While 
iridium-based complexes also show excellent potential for catalytic application. 
However, the iridium-based catalysis advancement is relatively slow because it 
is more valuable than gold, silver, and platinum. Nevertheless, the investigations 
show the significant stability of Ir-H and Ir-C bonds, enabling better isolation of 
iridium complexes (Vaska 1968). 
2. Ruthenium containing polymer-supported 
catalysts 
Pittman and coworkers reported the first illustration of an organic synthesis 
carried over a cross-linked polymer-supported catalyst in 1974 (Pittman and 
Smith 1974). This sequential catalytic reaction was performed by two catalysts 
anchored over a mixture of two resins. The ruthenium complex was immobilized 
on PPh3 functionalized resins using a standard methodology. Various research 
groups well accepted this methodology during the 1970s because of its 
straightforward synthetic approach and efficiency. In recent years, phosphine￾based polymers and linkers have been used for catalytic support. Palkovits 
and coworkers in 2019 reported a synthesis of solid phosphine-based polymers 
1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ethane (pDPPE), 1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene 
(pTPPB), and triphenylphosphine (pTPP) and via simple wet impregnation 
of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 to phosphine polymer in methanol, which offered an 
excellent catalyst (Palkovits et al. 2019). 
Bergbreiter and coworkers during the 1980s reported some different 
methodologies to use polymers in the reactions, not as a support but as an ion 
exchange material, which increases the activity of catalysts by removing those 
byproducts, which were poisoning these catalysts (Bergbreiter et al. 1987). 
However, this method increases reaction productivity by increasing the catalytic 
activity but does not produce a reusable catalyst. The same group in 1989 ended 
up with the development of a polyethylene-based Ru catalyst, using an earlier 
known methodology, which requires a PPh3 functionalized polymer as support 
(Phelps & Bergbreiter 1989). Another modification of their previous work was  
178 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
reported in 1990, where Bergbreiter and coworkers used polyethylene carboxylate 
as a support material. This polyethylene carboxylate works as a support and 
recovers the Ru(II) present in the reaction mixture; in other words, this catalyst 
regenerated itself during the catalysis (Bergbreiter and Treadwell 1990). 
Support materials were combined to induce selectivity in the reaction;
charcoal and anionic polymer composite with ruthenium particles show excellent 
hydrophilicity. As the reaction was performed in the aqueous media, the 
hydrophilicity of the support material became an important factor controlling the 
selectivity (Hronec et al. 1996). Cross-linking polymers usually show enhanced 
stability as compared to linear chain polymers. In the earlier reports, polystyrene, 
especially the PPh3 functionalized polystyrene, was frequently used as catalyst 
support. Ram and coworkers in 1998 reported an observation that the polystyrene 
and divinylbenzene copolymers are more stable as catalyst support. However, 
the extent of cross-linking is also one factor that controls the catalytic activity; 
as observed, 2% cross-linked polymer was found best as catalytic support while 
more than 5% cross-linking reduces the overall catalyst activity. It is a common 
phenomenon that ligands usually show a significant effect on the selectivity of 
product formation. In this series, Ram and coworkers used chloro-methylated 
polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymer to support and further functionalize it 
with the Schiff base as a ligand (Antony et al. 1998). It was observed that the 
type of Schiff base and extent of cross-linking significantly affects the catalytic 
activity (Scheme 1). 
Scheme 1. Schiff base functionalized chloro-methylated polystyrene-divinylbenzene 
copolymer as catalyst support (Antony et al. 1998) 
Barrett and coworkers synthesized a release-return (Boomerang) type 
polymer-supported catalyst and reported catalytic activity in 1999. Boomerang 
type catalyst has a substantial benefit in that it is a heterogeneous catalyst, but 
in the reaction media, it behaves as a homogeneous catalyst (Barrett et al. 1999). 
This report includes an exciting outcome showing the increased efficiency of a 
polymer-supported catalyst. Here, Grubbs catalyst was used with vinyl resins, and  
 
Ruthenium and Iridium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 179 
a simple shaking of a mixture produces desired catalyst. It was observed that the 
extended time of shaking reduces the catalytic activity, which may be due to the 
binding of active sites with the polymer. However, this catalyst is highly active 
and reusable up to three catalytic cycles. Because of a bulky polymer matrix, 
polymer-supported catalysts always suffered low enantio- and stereo-selectivity. 
Homogeneous asymmetric catalysis is always considered a distinctive 
approach because of its wide applications. During the 1990s, several reports 
came up with polymer-supported asymmetric catalysis. However, most polymer￾supported asymmetric catalysts lose their efficiency and selectivity significantly. As
an alternative, Chan and coworkers reported an idea of “one phase catalysis and 
two-phase separation,” which retains the catalytic activity and selectivity while 
remaining as a polymer-supported heterogeneous catalyst. Polymer-supported 
BINAP ligand was prepared by polycondensation of (S)-1 or (R)-1, terephthaloyl 
chloride, and (2S,4S)-pentanediol. These polyester-supported ligands are usually 
soluble in non-polar solvents like benzene and toluene and can be precipitated 
by adding methanol in the mixture (Chan et al. 1999). 
Porphyrins ligand-based complexes are well known for catalysis as some 
unusual selectivity was observed with such ligand systems. A ruthenium porphyrin 
complex was synthesized and covalently immobilized on Merrifield Peptide Resin
(MPR) (Scheme 2). MPR resin is a chloromethylated styrene-divinylbenzene
copolymer, which is not soluble in benzyl chloride but soluble in DCM and 
DMF. This property of solid support allows the metal porphyrin complex to 
remain intact with the solid surface (Che et al. 2000). A similar approach of using 
chloromethylated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer was used with EDTA (Dalal 
and Ram et al. 2001) (Scheme 3). 
Other than EDTA, Schiff bases are also reported as a ligand for complexations
and an anchor to the polymer support. Yusuff and coworkers prepared a Schiff
base functionalized polystyrene bound aldehyde and 1,2-phenylenediamine (PS￾opd), 2-aminophenol (PS-ap), or 2-aminobenzimidazole (PS-ab) condensation
polymers (Yusuff et al. 2007). This is the only report showing condensation 
polymer as catalyst support.

Scheme 3. Ruthenium EDTA complex covalently immobilized to chloromethylated 
styrene-divinylbenzene or MPR (Merrifield Polymer Resins) (Dalal and Ram et al. 2001) 
The work of Ram and coworkers during the 1990s exploring the extent of 
cross-linking, the presence of ligand as a covalent anchor, and the type of ligand 
significantly affected the catalytic potential of immobilized catalysts. In this series,
Brown and coworkers added a new hierarchy based on the type of cross-linking 
functionality. This report involved sulfide and ether cross-linked polystyrene as 
catalyst support (Brown et al. 2001). It was observed that the sulfide cross-linking
had reduced the catalytic activity because of low polarity and the high-density 
polymer matrix. While with the ether cross-linking, better results were observed 
when alcohols were used as a solvent. However, water and other polar aprotic 
solvents were also not suitable because of swelling in the polymer matrix. 
Before discussing further methodological advancements, let us detour 
and understand the limitations observed in the previous polymer-supported 
Ru catalysis. Ruthenium-based catalysis has always received considerable 
attention from researchers and industries. It is because it is comparatively 
cheaper than other 4d transition metals. In addition, we are well aware of the 
work of some prominent scientists like Chauvin, Grubbs, Schrock, and Dixneuf. 
Heterogenization of Grubbs and Grubbs type catalysts was much explored by 
various research groups. As we discussed at the beginning of this section, the 
phosphine-functionalized polymers were excellent support materials. However, 
these phosphine-based polymer matrices reduce the catalytic activity, and hence 
the amount of metal loading required for transformation is usually increased to 
two times compared to their homogenous counterpart. Hoveyda and coworkers 
used a dendrimer-supported Ru catalyst (Hoveyda et al. 2000). Yes, it is also an 
example of an immobilized catalyst but not in the scope of this chapter. Various 
other researchers reported using polystyrenes and polystyrenes copolymers with 
or without cross-linking; also, there are some examples of ligand-functionalized 
polymer matrices as catalyst support. There are some more examples reported 
by Yao, Blechert, and coworkers using Grubbs-type immobilized catalysts. Yao 
reported polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a support material; compared to phosphine 
functionalized and halide functionalized polystyrenes, PEG offers remarkable
chemical stability and is cost effective and support material (Yao 2000). A slight 
modification in Yao’s approach has been observed in the work of Lamaty and 
coworkers. Here, Polyethylene glycol (PEG) or Diethylene glycol (DEG) was 
used as polymer support (Lamarty et al. 2003) (Scheme 4). Ruthenium and Iridium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 181 
Scheme 4. Synthesis of PEG supported Grubbs type ruthenium catalyst
(Lamarty et al. 2003) 
While Blechert and coworkers utilize the same Merrifield resin (polystyrene￾divinylbenzene copolymer) as catalyst support (Blechert et al. 2000, 2001), there 
is one standard limitation, which has been observed in almost all the previous 
reports: several synthetic steps are required to develop polymer-supported 
catalyst. Iwasa and coworkers reported a two-step synthesis of polymer-supported 
ruthenium complex in 2013. The idea was significantly considerable as compared
to earlier reports. It was made possible by changing the synthetic protocol; most 
of the earlier known methodologies are based on polymerization, followed by 
the immobilization of the metal complexes. However, Iwasa and coworkers 
slightly changed the order of this synthetic protocol. Using starting material 
p-chloromethyl benzoyl chloride and 2-amino-2-methyl propane-1-ol, Ru(II)-
dm-Pheox complex was prepared further by reaction of acrylic acid, which 
produces a ruthenium complex having an acrylate functionality, which is used 
as one of the reactants in styrene-divinylbenzene copolymerization (Iwasa et al. 
2013) (Scheme 5).
Even though multistep synthesis of polymer-supported rthenium catalysts 
was explored until the previous decade, Chen and coworkers reported using 
monodisperse polystyrene as a support material to immobilize ruthenium 
nanoparticles (Chen et al. 2009) (Figure 1). We have also discussed chiral synthesis 
using polymer-supported catalysts. Most polymer matrices reduced the catalytic 
activity to a certain extent but performed asymmetric catalysis using immobilized 
catalysts. It is because asymmetric catalysis requires specific ligands to induce  
182 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Scheme 5. Synthesis of porous-polymer supported Ru(II)-dm-pheox 
catalyst (Iwasa et al. 2013) 
stereo and enantio-selectivity in the final compounds. Wang and coworkers
reported the polymer-supported Ru-TsDPEN catalyst (Noyori’s Catalyst) using a 
similar approach by using polystyrene as a support material (Wang et al. 2005). 
Figure 1. A Schematic explaining the preparation of ruthenium immobilized 
polymer-supported catalyst (Chen et al. 2009) 
The idea of multistep synthesis and copolymerization of the polymer matrix 
can be an expensive approach because most of the earlier methodologies were 
based on the covalent anchoring of the ruthenium complexes or the complexation 
of functionalized polymer matrix with the ruthenium. An alternate methodology 
reported by Nolan and coworkers, despite covalently anchoring ruthenium 
complex to the polymer support, this idea was based on the impregnation of 
ruthenium complex to the porous polymer support. A simple polydivinylbenzene 
and ruthenium complex in toluene produce the desired catalyst (Nolan et 
al. 2002) (Scheme 6). Lau and coworkers established quite a similar idea in
2011; cation exchange resins Dowex-50W and Chelex-100 have used catalyst 
support polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complex, cis-[RuII(2,9-Me2phen)2(H2O)2]
2+ Ruthenium and Iridium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 183 
(Lau et al. 2011). Another example of catalyst synthesis by polymer impregnation 
was recently reported in 2016. Here, amine-functionalized nanoporous polymer 
(AFPS)-supported Ru nanoparticle-based catalysts were prepared by a simple
impregnation-chemical reduction method (Hwang et al. 2016) (Figure 2). In all 
the cases, the porosity of the support material enables ruthenium complexes to 
impregnate into the porous sites while leaving the active catalytic sites available 
for catalysis.

(Nolan et al. 2002) 
Figure 2. Amine functionalized nanoporous polymer (AFPS) supported Ru nanoparticle￾based catalyst prepared by impregnation (Hwang et al. 2016) 
As we know, the extent of heterogenization of catalyst has an inverse 
relation with the catalytic activity; however, it cannot be explained through any 
mathematical equation. It is understood that as the heterogenization increases, 184 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
the homogeneity of the reaction mixture usually decreases and hence the 
catalytic activity decreases. All the examples we had discussed in this section 
focused entirely on the ruthenium complexes’ heterogenization by immobilizing 
it on the polymer support. However, it is essential as immobilization increases 
thermal stability, reusability, and ease of handling. It is to mention that such 
immobilization reduces the catalytic activity and shows several inherent issues 
like such complexes are challenging to characterize. Because most of the catalyst 
supports are crystalline, these materials have very low mechanical strengths, which 
reduces the long-term application of these materials. Soluble polymers are an
alternative that can address these issues. We have discussed one such example in 
the previous paragraphs; PEG is a soluble polymer that is readily available and 
cost-effective. It can be noted that even though polymers are well explored as 
catalyst support, soluble polymers are yet an uncharted territory. Polyisobutylene 
(PIB) has been widely used for various applications, but it recently came under 
the limelight and got recognition as catalyst support. It is non-crystalline and 
chemically inert; moreover, the characterization of PIB is comparatively easy 
because its 1H NMR spectrum shows only two types of protons. Above all, this 
compound has a vinyl terminus, compared to polyether in the case of PEG. The 
presence of vinyl groups offers accessibility to further functionalization.
In 2010, Bergbreiter and coworkers reported using PIB as soluble polymer 
and support for ruthenium complex (Bergbreiter et al. 2010) because PIB has the 
vinyl terminal, converted to an NHC by electrophilic aromatic substitution that 
phase immobilize a benzylidene Ru catalyst. The formed complex is soluble in 
various solvents and can be used as a homogeneous or biphasic catalyst. Again in 
2016, the same group reported using polyisobutylene and poly(4-dodecylstyrene) 
copolymer as soluble polymer support for transition metal catalysts (Liang et al. 
2016). Porous organic polymers (POPs) are another class of polymers categorized 
as soluble polymers. Recently, Yoon and coworkers reported a novel POP that 
incorporates NNN pincer type of ligand, i.e. 2,6-Bis(pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine, (3-bpp￾POP) was prepared via solvent-knitting method. 
3. Iridium containing polymer-supported catalysts 
A study was reported in the year 1975, which comprises the controlled addition 
of triphenyl phosphines to Rh6(CO)16. This study was further extended to add 
Rh carbonyls on polystyrenes functionalized with PPh2 (Watters et al. 1975). 
This idea was further implemented with Ir4(CO)12 using a similar methodology 
(Stuntz and Shapley 1976). However, the synthesized complexes were not used 
for any catalytic applications. In 1978, Gates and coworkers used a similar 
synthetic approach of PPh2 functionalized styrenes and referred to it as a novel 
catalyst (Gates et al. 1978). 
After a decade in 1989, sulphoxide functionalized polystyrene was used as 
polymer support to produce Ir(III) complexes. This is the first report in which 
polymer-supported Ir(III) complex has been used for catalysis. The formed  
Ruthenium and Iridium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 185 
complex has been used for its potential application as a catalyst for hydrogen 
transfer reaction from isopropanol to ketones (Davies and Sood 1989). Since
2001, Ir-based polymer-supported complexes were not established as an option 
for catalysis. It is because no continuous development in synthetic approaches 
has been done. A report by Ley and coworkers in 2001 attracted the research 
groups by highlighting the catalytic application of polymer-supported Ir catalyst 
(Ley et al. 2001). Using earlier known Ir-based Felkin’s catalyst (Felkin et al. 
1976, 1978), Ley and coworkers immobilized the Felkin’s catalyst to a PPh2 
functionalized polymer support. 
Figure 3. Polymer-supported iridium catalyst (Felkin et al. 1976, 1978) 
Until 2016, a minimal number of polymer immobilized Ir-based heterogeneous 
catalysts were known for catalytic application. Boisson and coworkers elaborated 
a simple way to synthesize a polyethylene-supported Ir catalyst (Boisson et al. 
2016). The catalyst stability was further improved by the NHC ligand used for 
the complexation. The synthetic protocol involves the imidazole-based NHC 
ligand attached to the polyethylene by iodine-functionalized polyethylene with 
NHC ligand (Scheme 7).

186 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Single-atom catalysis is a relatively new area of interest in heterogeneous 
catalysis, and in recent times, such catalysis has gained significant attention from 
various research groups. More importantly, supported single atom catalysis is an 
excellent approach with polymer. An amino pyridine functionalized porous organic 
polymer was used to develop an anatomically dispersed Ir catalyst (Shao et al. 
2019) (Figure 4). This catalyst was highly stable and did not require any ligand 
to anchor the polymer support. This methodology is straightforward and robust 
in catalytic activity compared to catalyst loading and recyclability. 
Figure 4. Polymer-supported iridium-based single-atom catalyst (Shao et al. 2019) 
Sun and coworkers reported the only example of polymer-supported
heterogeneous Ir photocatalyst (Sun et al. 2020). In here, organic porous polymers 
were used to support Ir complexes. These complexes were synthesized through 
a Sonogashira coupling reaction. Heterogeneous visible-light photocatalysts
were prepared through a reaction between two [Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+-based biopic 
linkers and triphenylmethane tetraborate. Such polymer-conjugated complexes
provide promising platforms for organic synthesis. In the previous year, Wang and 
coworkers reported a four-step synthetic protocol for synthesizing divinylbenzene 
polymer functionalized with benzothiazole ligated Ir catalyst (Wang et al. 2021). 
4-vinyl benzyl boronic acid was used to bridge benzothiazole and divinylbenzene 
polymer. This catalyst was heterogeneous with excellent reproducibility up to 
several catalytic cycles, the synthetic pathway was relatively easy, and a very 
common Ir dimer [Ir2(Cp*Cl)2] has been used as a precursor. Ruthenium and Iridium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 187 
Scheme 8. Synthesis of POP-MBTS-Ir (Wang et al. 2021) 
Li and coworkers have used a slightly different approach; here, a coordinative
immobilization has been used to anchor a half sandwich Ir complex. Ir2(Cp*Cl)2 
dimer has been used as a precursor with poly(4-vinyl pyridine) polymer (Li et 
al. 2021). Cp*Ir@P4VP catalyst was synthesized through a single-step reaction 
of P4VP and Ir precursor. This Ir catalyst was supported on a linear polymeric 
chain, unlike previous polymer-supported complexes, where cross-linked polymer 
was used as support (Scheme 9).

4. Conclusion 
Polymer-bound catalysts are getting considerable interest in academic and 
industrial research in the last five decades. These supported catalysts provide 188 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
an alternate paradigm in catalytic synthesis protocols. An organometallic moiety 
anchored to polymer support shows considerable advantages compared to other 
heterogenization techniques. Significantly, the pharmaceuticals and Active 
Pharmaceutical Industries (API) industries greatly benefit from this idea. No 
other heterogenization or immobilization techniques address the leaching of 
metal atoms into the products. Apart from the apparent advantages of polymer￾supported catalysts like heterogeneous catalysts, it provides a comprehensive 
option of support materials, which can be modified as needed. Ruthenium 
complexes have been well explored for many decades in the case of ruthenium and 
iridium-based polymer-supported catalysts. However, there is a lot to study with 
iridium-based polymer-supported catalysts. Not only for ruthenium catalysts, but 
there are also methods available for impregnating other nanoparticles directly 
to the porous polymer supports, which can be considered a comparatively more 
straightforward method to immobilize catalysts. Since the establishment of 
this idea, few limitations have been observed, like the loss of catalytic activity 
and the difficulty of characterization of prepared catalyst, which some recent 
advances in this area can overcome. For example, soluble polymers and porous 
organic polymers are possible alternatives to address these issues.

1. Introduction 
More than a century of research has contributed to the development of 
homogeneous catalysis. In every aspect of chemical synthesis, homogeneous 
catalysis has notable involvement. Organic molecules work as organocatalysts, 
or some organic molecules work as ligands channelizing the catalytic potential 
of transitions metal (List 2007, Eelkema et al. 2019, Lundgren et al. 2016). 
This control over the catalytic potential was so effective that researchers could 
perform regio-, stereo-, and enantio-selective reactions (Suib 1993). Because of 
this exceptional potential of catalysis, catalysts have become a critical parameter 
to optimize any reaction for commercial or societal benefits. In every aspect, we 
can say that a catalyst can make any reaction productive by reducing cost and 
effort. Consider a couple of parameters that influence any chemical reaction are 
temperature and time while the type of solvents and in several cases the pressure 
of gas participating in a reaction also controls the productivity of a reaction. It 
is observed in several instances that a suitable catalyst can overcome the use or 
requirement of any of these parameters. Suitable catalysts can reduce the required 
reaction time, temperature, and pressure of a gas used as a reactant. In addition, 
it has been observed that suitable catalysts can replace the need for co-catalysts 
or some particular reagents required to pursue any chemical transformation, in 
the words of Alwin Mittasch, a renowned chemical engineer. He did all the 
optimization of Haber’s Process for commercial application (Dronsfield 2007).

194 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Mittasch said, “Chemistry without catalysis would be a sword without a handle, 
a light without brilliance, a bell without sound”, which appears very true in the 
present scenario. It is because all the major industrial processes are capable of 
fulfilling commercial and societal demands only because suitable catalysts are 
involved. Moreover, continuous research is ongoing to improve the quality of 
catalysts further. 
At a laboratory scale synthesis, there are several aspects through which 
anyone can say the quality and efficiency of catalyst has been improved. For
example, at small scale, the most important parameter that shows the quality and 
activity of the catalysts is the product yield. However, on a commercial scale the 
most important factor that ensures applicability of the catalyst is the economic 
viability. However, from last two decades considerable efforts have been invested
to increase the applicability of 3d transition metal-based catalysis for commercial 
applications. Nevertheless, 4d transition elements Ru, Rh, Pd and Ag are the most 
versatile elements as catalysts. Especially these four elements as catalysts have the 
widest applications. The Nobel Prize was awarded to some eminent researchers 
in 2005 and 2010 for establishment of Ru and Pd based catalytic methodologies. 
These catalytic methodologies were economical and safe compared to the earlier 
known synthetic procedures. 
Pd as a catalyst for variety of chemical transformations has excellent 
applicability. Especially for CC cross coupling and CN coupling reactions, 
these reactions are part of API, natural product synthesis, molecular material 
development, and pharmaceuticals. The pioneering works of Heck, Suzuki, 
Nigeshi, Casser, Sonogashira and Buchwald reactions are some of the most 
popular protocols. Compared to homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts 
are always more economical. With the growing societal and industrial demands, 
there is always a need for new catalysts. However, usually introducing a novel 
catalyst and replacing an older and established catalyst requires a lot of studies 
and optimizations in every aspect. Since the idea of partial heterogenization 
over a solid support has been established, it has become a very well accepted 
alternate for catalysis. It is because a heterogeneous catalyst usually shows low 
catalytic activity compared to homogeneous catalysts. Storage, transportation, 
handling and lack of reusability are the common problems usually faced with 
the homogeneous catalysts. 
Polymers are a wide class of chemical compounds or we can say a material. 
They are classified on the basis of nature of polymerization process, presence of 
cross linkers, morphology of the formed polymer – either cross linked or non-cross 
linked – and the chemical nature of used monomers or the polymers formed as a 
product. Large variety of polymers were known for their application as a support 
material. During the 1970s, it was discovered that catalyst support materials made 
up of polymers such as polyamides and polyurea were used as support material. 
The report by Zhang et al. in 1983 is one of the first report where the idea of 
polyurea-supported Pd catalyst originated. That was a two-step catalyst preparation 
in which co-monomers 2,4-toluenediisocynanate complexed with Pd acetate Palladium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 195 
and 4,40-diamino-2,20-bipyriridine were condensed followed by the reduction 
of Pd(II) by LiAlH4, which produces the final catalyst for use. The idea of Pd 
containing monomer for polymerization shows an excellent outcome as a novel 
polymer-supported catalyst and in comparison to Pd/C, this new catalyst shows 
40% less Pd loading and a greater life time for catalysis. However, other results 
show that this new catalyst was greatly affected by the polarity of the solvent. 
As it appears, polymer-supported Pd catalysts have a very rich and diverse 
history, which can be a difficult task to converse in only one chapter. Therefore, 
in this chapter we are going to discuss the recent developments of past two 
decades. Even in these two decades, there are significant reports available with 
excellent outcomes. 
2. Polystyrene-supported Pd catalyst 
Styrene is one of the most commonly available polymers and its immense 
number of functionalization possibilities makes it extremely useful for the 
domestic and commercial applications (Wünsch 2012). This versatility of 
polystyrenes in it various forms attracts researchers worldwide to explore 
its application in catalysis. Merrifield resins are the cross-linked polystyrene 
which contains chloromethyl functionality. Merrifield resins are one of the most 
common examples and frequently used for the development of Pd supported 
catalysts. In year 2001, Buchwald and coworkers extensively explored the C–C 
and C–N coupling reactions using Pd catalysts; they came up with an innovative 
idea to use this Merrifield resin as catalyst support (Buchwald 2001). The 
reported methodology was uncomplicated and refined, which involved linking 
biphenylphosphine, a widely recognized ligand, to the polymer backbone through 
an ether linkage. A biphenyl framework is easy and a well-known synthetic 
protocol: 2-dicyclohexylphosphine-2-methoxybiphenyl was synthesized through 
a reaction of 2-methoxyphenyl magnesium bromide with benzyne and subsequent 
addition of chlorodicyclohexylphosphine. This is followed by deprotection of 
aryl methyl ether with boron tribromide, which produces the desired ligand. 
The formed ligand with hydroxyl group was reacted with Merrifield resin cross 
linked with 1% divinylbenzene, the reaction of NaH in DMF solvent produces 
resin bound dicyclohexylphosphine ligand which is further complexed by the 
Pd(OAc)2. The formed catalyst was quite stable, active and reusable for Suzuki 
coupling and C-N coupling reactions. One of the limitation, which is observed 
here, was that the multistep synthetic protocol requires absolute care in inert gas 
environment that restricts its applicability for scalable applications (Scheme 1). 
Technical simplicity is always the foremost requirement for any methodological 
advancement for its application in scalable synthesis. Wet impregnation is one 
of the most widely used method for the development of heterogeneous catalysts 
because of its simplicity, low cost and because it is a less waste producing method. 
Shekher and co-workers (2002) reported a polymer supported Pd catalyst for 
Suzuki coupling. The synthesis protocol involved a simple wet impregnation

with triphenyl phosphine can be directly ligated with PdCl2 or Pd(0) (Shekhar 
et al. 2002) (Scheme 2). 
Scheme 2. Triphenylphosphine functionalized polystyrene (Shekhar et al. 2002) 
Similar to the work of Buchwald and coworkers (2001), Ram and coworkers 
(2003) reported the use of chloromethylated poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) 
copolymers (PS-DVB) with 8–14% crosslinking, which was functionalized with 
Schiff base ligand based Pd(II) complex. Initially, chloromethylated polystyrene 
was converted to aldehyde functional group through a reaction with NaHCO3 
and DMSO. Formed PS-DVB with aldehyde was reacted with ethylenediamine 
or 2-aminopyridine to produce Schiff base – functionalized PS-DVB followed by
a reaction with PdCl2 in ethanol solvent to produce desired catalyst. This simple 
synthetic approach produces bidentate Schiff-base-ligand complexed with Pd for 
an efficient hydrogenation of olefins (Ram et al. 2003) (Scheme 3).
Compared to p-chloromethyl polystyrene, another approach was developed 
with p-anilinopolystyrene, which was reported by Mukherjee in 2003. In here, 
macropourous polystyrene cross-linked with divinylbenzene was used as a 
polymer backbone and a similar methodology of schiff base is used complex
with Pd for catalytic applications. Some other alternates like nitropoly-N-vinyl 
carbazole are also reported in this work (Mukherjee 2003).

N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has gained a considerable interest in the 
recent decades. These ligands are well known for the development of stable and 
active catalysts. It is because NHCs are conformationally stabilized ligand, and 
its strong σ–donor abilities makes these catalysts more active (Gonzalez 2016). 
Even in some recent reports, chalcogenated NHCs are gaining more interest due to 
multiple donor sites of different nature, which makes them more facile to interact
with variety of metals and their oxidation states (Joshi et al. 2019, 2021, 2021, 
2022). Lee and co-workers (2005) reported a novel methodology to develop a 
polymer-supported catalyst using a NHC ligand based Pd complex supported on 
Poly(1-methylimidazoliummethyl styrene)-surface grafted-poly(styrene) resin. A 
methodology known as suspension polymerization is used to produce the desired

by 1-methyl-3-(4-vinylbenzyl)imidazolium hexaflouorophosphate, which was
used to synthesize and copolymerize with styrene and divinylbenzene in aqueous 
media. This idea was interesting research, which produces an extremely stable 
and reusable catalyst; most effectively, this methodology produces a catalyst,
which has all the active sites embedded on the polymer surface (Lee et al. 2005) 
(Scheme 4).

Bakherad and coworkers (2009) reported a polymer-supported Pd(II) 
ethylenediamine complex as a highly active catalyst that is used for sonogashira 
coupling reaction. The synthesis protocol includes the use of chloromethylated 
polystyrene cross-linked by 2% divinylbenzene. As reported, this polymer is 
flexible and capable of interaction with metallic atom via ligands that are attached
to the polymer beads. The merits of this prepared catalyst are important; this 
catalyst was prepared using commercially available reagents and the synthetic 
protocol was very convenient (Bakherad et al. 2009) (Scheme 5).

A reusable, air-stable and polymer anchored Schiff base ligated Pd catalyst 
has been synthesized and reported by Mondal and coworkers in 2009. The 
remarkable advantages of this catalyst are that it is economical, easily accessible, 
and reusable. As discussed by the author, this is free from fire hazard or explosions
and has shown notable activity towards variety of substrate with excellent yields 
of products (Mondal et al. 2009) (Scheme 6).

(Mondal et al. 2009) 
Udaykumar and coworkers (2010) showed the used of Pd imidazole 
complex supported over chloromethylated polystyrene for the hydrogenation of 
benzylideneaniline. In here, polystyrene cross-linked with 6.5% divinyl benzene 
is used as a catalyst support. Functionalization of PS-DVB with imidazole was 
done via a simple reaction performed under a mixture of toluene and acetonitrile 
on a hot water bath for 60 h. The imidazole-functionalized catalyst was separated 
through soxhlet extraction followed by a reaction of PdCl2 in ethanol that produces 
desired product (Udaykumar et al. 2010) (Scheme 7).

polystyrene (Udaykumar et al. 2010) 200 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
The same group of Udaykumar and coworkers in 2011 reported another 
catalyst with slight modification in the ligand. Polymer supported Pd-2-
methylimidazole was synthesized and reported for the catalytic activity. There is 
no reasonable explanation that has been provided for the effect of methylimidazole
on the catalytic reaction (Udaykumar et al. 2010) (Scheme 8). 
Scheme 8. Synthesis of Pd methylimidazole complex supported over chloromethylated 
polystyrene (Udaykumar et al. 2011) 
In the previous decade, the use of styrene as catalyst support for Pd catalyst 
has been reduced; to the best of our knowledge, only two reports are available. 
Extensive work by various research groups has been done on the soluble polymer￾supported catalysts. Bergbreiter and coworkers in 2015 reported synthesis 
strategies for the more effective soluble ligands for phosphine ligand based Pd 
complex. RAFT (Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer) polymerization
is used to prepare an alkane soluble polyl(4-alkylstyrene)-bound phosphine 
ligands. In here, 4-dodecylstyrene and 4-tert-butylstyrene were copolymerized 
with 7% of 4-diphenylphosphine styrene or 4-chloromethylstyrene using RAFT
chemistry and produced poly(tert-butylstyrene-co-4-dodecylstyrene) copolymers. 
The formed polymers with chloromethylene functionality react with the phenolic 
group of dicyclohexylbiarylphosphine ligand. This work includes the development 
of supported polymer catalyst using a soluble polymer (Bergbreiter et al. 2015) 
(Schemes 9, 10 and 11).

202 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Merrifield resin is one of the most common form of polystyrene which
is commercially available. In one of the most recent report by Sreekumar and 
coworkers (2020), they had shown the use of dendromerized form of Merrifield 
resin with ethylene glycol. The synthesis procedure was relatively easy compared 
to several previous reports. The merrfield resin polymer supported by ethylene 
glycol was allowed to swell in the DMF and a methanolic solution of Pd(OAc)2 
is charged to get the desired catalyst. Compared to the earlier reports, this 
methodology produces symmetrical dendrons bonded on to the linear polymer 
chain, resulting in a rigid and permanent polymer chain having Pd. This is an 
intresting phenomenon which produces a site isolation to the peripheral active 
sites that are available for catalysis (Sreekumar et al. 2020) (Figure 1). 
3. Polymer support other than polystyrene 
As we have discussed earlier, polymers are a diverse class of materials with 
excellent properties to withstand harsh conditions. Apart from polystyrene, 
in previous decades several other polymers were used as a catalyst support. 
Amberlyst is one of the neutral ion exchange resin and bears a basic chemical 
nature; it is an inexpensive and commercially available polymer. Ye and 
coworkers (2008) reported the use of amberlyst A-21 as catalyst support. The 
synthesis protocol is quite reasonable: Pd(OPf)2 and amberlyst A-21 were 
directly refluxed in acetone for 24 h that produces the desired product (Ye et al. 
2008) (Scheme 12). 
Scheme 12. Amberlyst A-21 as catalyst support for Pd(OPf)2 (Ye et al. 2008) 
Another report by Li and coworkers (2011) reported the use of a most 
commonly available biopolymer, cellulose. Cellulose is one of the best material as 
a catalyst support because it is naturally available or it can be easily synthesized 
and can have wide applications. A slightly modified cellulose, functionalized with
OPPh2 is an attractive option as a catalyst support. Nano Pd is an active catalyst 
but it is difficult to bind with the ligands and polymer supports; also, nano Pd 
are sensitive to air and moisture. In this report, Cellulose – OPPh2 – Pd0 was 
synthesized and reported for catalytic application. The two-step synthesis protocol 
was not difficult and easily produces the desired product. Initially, cellulose was 
reacted with PPh2Cl, which produces an intermediate Cellulose – PPh2, which 
is further reacted by PdCl2 in ethanol solution, and affords desired catalyst (Li 
et al. 2011) (Scheme 13). Palladium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 203

Shou and coworkers (2012) reported a porous polymer synthesized by 
copolymerization of divinylbenzene and methylacrylate monomers, which were 
reacted in presence of AIBN; after stirring for 3 h, the mixture was transferred 
to autoclave for 24 h at 100°C, which produces the solid product. The formed 
product contains carboxyl group, which upon treatment with HCl converted to 
acyl group. The formed acyl group was further reacted with acylamidation reaction 
with 1,6-hexadiamine followed by a reaction with pyridine-2-aldehyde to produce 
Schiff base. The formed product is a polymer-supported ligand, which can be
complexed with Pd(OAc)2 (Shou et al. 2012) (Scheme 14).

Palladium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 205 
In the last few decades, MOFs (Metal Organic Framework) are extensively 
studied for their applications in catalysis and they are well suitable for various 
other applications. The reasons for the applications of MOF, particularly in the 
area of catalysis, are the porosity and metal bonding capacities as well as their 
multichemical functionalities. However, it is observed that MOF have very poor 
hydrothermal stability and it is not much stable in certain organic solvents in 
the longer duration reactions (Zhou et al. 2012, Gao et al. 2012, Wu et al. 2012, 
Kreno et al. 2012, Gu et al. 2011, Aijaz et al. 2012). While looking for potential 
alternatives, researchers came up with an idea by making a composite of MOF 
with microporous polymers, which are relatively stable because of covalent bonds. 
Recently, covalent organic polymers (COP’s) were synthesized and reported 
by Xiang and coworkers (Xiang et al. 2012). This novel polymer is quite porous 
and extremely stable under hydrothermal conditions. Therefore, COPs are well 
suited as catalyst support. Zhou and coworkers (2013) reported an initial report 
of a Pd catalyst supported by COP-4. COP-4 was synthesized via a reaction of 
1,5-cyclooctadiene and 2,4,6-tris-(4-bromo-phenyl)-[1,3,5-] triazine in presence 
of bis(1,5-dicyclooctadiene) Ni (0) catalyst in DMF. Further, the Pd nitrate was 
impregnated to the prepared COP-4 in DMF or aqueous media (Zhou et al. 2013).
This work shows a high dispersion of superfine particles, and hence the high
catalytic activity and stability (Figure 2).

Schiff base ligands or Schiff base functionalized polymer supports are excellent
in terms of the stability they impart to the metal complexes. Numerous reports are 
available showing applications of these catalysts. The reasons for the privilege 
these ligands are receiving are because of the multidentate chelating capabilities 
and ability to withstand under strong oxidizing and reducing conditions, and most 
importantly, the ease of availability of precursors and synthesis of desired ligands. 
Taking these merits into account, Zhao and coworkers (2014) reported the use 
of polyallylamine polymer as catalyst support. In addition, the novel part of the 206 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
work is that they included phosphine functionality to the polymer support, which 
brings an interesting outcome that it provides multiple coordination sites for the 
Pd acetate. The synthetic protocol was relatively easy, the cross-linked polymer of 
polyallylamine and epichlorohydrin were obtained under basic reaction conditions 
and converted to carbonate by an ion exchange reaction with NaHCO3. Further, 
a reaction with 3-(diphenylphosphanyl)benzaldehyde produces a Schiff base
functionalized polyallylamine polymer, followed by a reaction with Pd acetate 
that afforded the desired catalyst (Zhao et al. 2014) (Scheme 15). 
Sajiki and coworkers have reported a slight modification of the work of Zhao
and coworkers in 2019. The authors suggest that polyethyleneimine polymers, 
polystyrene-divinylbenzene and polymethacrylate polymers have similar Pd 
scavenging capabilities. It is also mentioned that due to the similar affinities to Pd,
these polymer supports show similar type of selectivity and catalytic efficiency. 
However, polyethyleneimine modified polymers show better catalytic activities

support (Zhao et al. 2014)

towards the chemoselective hydrogenations. In this report, a comparative study 
has been performed to show the ability to chelate with the residual or leached Pd 
present in the sonogashira reaction (Sajiki et al. 2019) (Figure 3). 
Porous polymer monoliths are a new class of polymer, which is recently 
discovered. In a very small duration of its discovery, monolith polymers had 
proved their presence in various areas of application, most importantly in the 
production of ultrapure water (Murayama et al. 2011). Moreover, these polymers 
were studied for their applications in the flow chemistry. Because most of the 
polymers swell and show different physical properties in the organic solvents,
it is an important drawback which restricts their applications in the flow 
and microchannel reactors. Sajiki and coworkers (2017) reported the use of 
polystyrene-divinylbenzene based monolith polymer as a catalyst support. They 
prepared an unfunctionalized polymer via two-step successive polymerization 
of styrene and divinylbenzene using sorbitan fatty acid as emulsifier and radical

indicator AIBN, followed by the sulphonation of monolithic polymer using an 
acidic cation exchange resin. Finally, this polymer has been treated with the
methanolic solution of Pd acetate to obtain the desired catalyst (Sajik et al. 2017) 
(Scheme 16). 
Scheme 16. Showing the use of porous polymer monoliths as a catalyst 
support (Sajik et al. 2017) 
An alternate to the porous polymer monoliths, porous organic polymers 
(POPs) are emerging as a versatile material for a catalyst support. After 
introduction of COFs (Covalent Organic Frameworks), these porous polymers
can be synthesized by two different methods via two-component condensation 
or by two-component coupling. After establishment of these synthesis protocols, 
because of their ease of synthesis, these polymers are gaining substantial interest. 
In addition, due to their large surface area, and flexible binding properties,
hierarchical porosity provides a dispersion medium to produce a single atom 
catalyst also. Recently in 2018, Zhu and coworkers reported the use of 1,3,5-
TDTB (1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol) based POP and used as a catalyst support. 
Using Duff formylation reaction, POP were synthesized, followed by the reaction
with Pd acetate, which produces the desired catalyst (Zhu et al. 2018) (Figure 
4), while in another report by Ding and coworkers (2020), a PPh3 functionalized 
POP as catalyst support was used (Ding et al. 2020) (Figure 5).
Anas and coworkers showed the use of polyacrylonitrile as a catalyst support. 
The novelty of the work is situated in the linear structure of this molecule, 
and because it is thermoplastic it has a high melting point above 300 °C. In 
addition, this polymeric material provides the diversity to produce copolymers 
with different acrylonitriles. Based on this perspective, two new catalysts have 
been reported. These two modifications were based on the functionalization of 
the polyacrylonitriles with ethylene diamine and mono-ethanolamine (Anas et al. 
2021, 2022) (Schemes 17 and 18). 
Nevertheless, it is a new decade coming up with new targets and new 
horizons are yet to be achieved. In the previous year, an excellent report by Li and 
coworkers (2021) showed an innovative idea of polymer supported catalysis. As 
we know, catalyst deactivations and aggregations are the most common problems, 
and these problems are yet to be addressed, specially in heterogeneous catalysts, 
and even in the polymer-supported catalysis. This report includes an exceptional 
idea by developing a hyper crosslinked polymer integrated NHC (N-Heterocyclic 
carbenes) as a polymer support for Pd catalyst. This polymeric support has 
potential to recapture the aggregated or leached Pd (Li et al. 2021) (Figure 6).Palladium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 209

4. Conclusion 
Heterogeneous catalysis is unquestionably a field of fascination, which is 
continuously growing because of the efforts of excellent research groups. Due 
to this, extensive research is leading to the development of more dependable 
and credible methods for catalyst production, characterization, and catalyst 
applications. 
Catalysis systems, which are chemically relevant and interesting, and also 
effective in terms of catalytic applications with potential reusability and reduced 
metal leaching, will always, remain in demand. Even though there are substantial 
and effective reports available, very few are getting attention from the industries 
for commercial applications. The most common reason is the lack of innovations 
and modifications in the existing polymeric supports. Moreover, a number of
new polymers are being developed by the researchers, which have considerable 
potential as catalyst support but their application is yet limited. 
Pd based catalysts have significant applications in laboratory and industrial 
scale applications. At present, to make synthetic protocols, energy efficient
industries are shifting towards the flow and microchannel reactors and these
reaction techniques are well suited with the homogeneous catalysts but with 
homogeneous catalysis, the question of separation of catalyst is a major problem. 
Therefore, there is a robust requirement to develop heterogeneous catalysts 
suitable for these types of reactor techniques.

1. Introduction 
Water is one of the most vital elements for life on Earth. Nowadays, it’s necessary 
to have access to clean water, which is crucial for maintaining excellent health 
(Anderson et al. 2019). One of today’s most significant and potentially fatal 
problems is environmental contamination, which demands a specific focus from 
researchers. Environmentally hazardous toxins in nature are rising quickly as 
a result of human activities like industrialization (Bengtsson et al. 2019). The 
advancements made in science have both positive and negative effects on the 
environment. Poor industrial effluent discharge practices into soil and water 
bodies, surface runoff from agricultural lands, municipal waste disposal that is 
left untreated, and mining activities are all responsible for this pollution, which 
negatively affects health and life and degrades our environment (Delkash et al. 
2018). Due to their refractory properties, heavy metals, a naturally occurring 
component of the Earth’s crust, and an economically significant mineral cause 
heavy metal pollution that degrades water quality and has an impact on the 
food chain. To do this, numerous researchers have carried out studies to 
identify effective techniques for wastewater remediation (Munir et al. 2021). 
Consequently, a lot of study has focused on designing and developing strategies

216 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
to cope with these contaminants. Among many other approaches, the creation 
of an active catalyst has drawn a lot of interest in addressing the potentially 
harmful contaminants present in aqueous environments (Farhan et al. 2022). 
Numerous research from both the economic and environmental aspects 
has been conducted on the catalytic reactions utilizing catalysts based on 
transition metals. There have been numerous research initiatives over the 
past 15 years to develop new, environmentally-friendly catalytic systems for 
reactant transformations; replacing traditional processes with newer catalytic 
conversions using different metallic catalysts under cleaner, greener conditions 
has also continued (Javaid et al. 2019). These catalytic systems are frequently 
homogeneous, making it impossible to separate or extract the catalysts from the 
reaction. Due to their renewability, reusability, ease of handling, and insolubility 
in solvents, heterogeneous catalytic systems have recently received a lot of 
attention from researchers to overcome the shortcomings of their homogeneous 
counterparts (Nasrollahzadeh et al. 2021a). 
Copper (Cu), arsenic (As), rhodium (Rh), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cobalt 
(Co), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) are 
examples of heavy metals with specific densities of around 5 g/mL or above
and higher mass numbers (Qasem et al. 2021). These substances are naturally 
present in the Earth’s crust and are regarded as being incredibly dangerous even 
at low concentrations. They can enter the human body by the consumption of 
contaminated food, water, or air and cannot biodegrade (Tabelin et al. 2018). 
However, the human body’s metabolism needs just a little amount of heavy metals 
as trace elements. They pose a serious threat to all living organisms as their level 
rises. In addition, domestic and agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and other
sources of heavy metals are the main causes of water contamination. As a result, 
heavy metal ion removal from polluted streams is crucial (Rathi et al. 2021). 
Applications of polymer-based materials for adsorption and catalysis have 
grown significantly over the last few years. Novel polymeric composites and
nanocomposites have been created to address the issue of the growing scale of 
water contamination by various mono- and multivalent heavy metal ions in recent 
years from an adsorption perspective (Eskandari et al. 2020). The polymer can 
be coupled with a variety of organic/inorganic, natural, or synthetic materials to 
create novel sorbents that have enhanced sorption characteristics for heavy metal 
ions and higher removal efficiencies due to its remarkable properties like the ease
of production and biocompatibility (Zhang et al. 2021a). The polymer-supported 
catalyst has shown its ability as a suitable platform for hydrogenizing the catalyst 
of various catalytic reactions, operating either as a protective material or as a 
catalytic component (Hou et al. 2020). 
Polymer-based adsorbents were used in optics and medication administration 
in addition to wastewater treatment. Physical characteristics of polymer-supported 
adsorbents include mechanical stability, large surface area, size distribution, and 
regenerative, flexible, controllable surface chemistry with high surface area and 
tiny inter-fibrous pore size (Pereao et al. 2019).  
 
 
 
Cobalt, Copper, and Rhodium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 217 
Recently, metal catalysts based on chitosan and its derivatives have drawn 
a lot of interest. The benefits of heterogeneous processes include better product 
isolation, reusable catalysts, enhanced steric control of reaction intermediates, 
and more (Wang et al. 2022). These advantages led scientists to immobilize a 
homogenous catalytic site on a variety of supports, including polymers, zeolites, 
silica, and magnetic materials. Because it plays a vital role in transition metal￾catalyzed processes and is environmentally friendly, chitosan (CS) has recently 
attracted a lot of attention (Dohendou et al. 2021). For C–C bond-forming 
procedures such as the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction (CS-supported Pd catalyst) 
(Chen et al. 2022), Henry reaction (CS-supported Ti catalyst) (Dhakshinamoorthy 
et al. 2021), hydroformylation process (CS-supported Rh catalyst) (Madkour et 
al. 2021), and C-N bond-forming methods such as click reaction (Patureau et al. 
2019), chitosan-supported metal complexes have been used as catalysts. There 
have been reports from several groups about these chemicals’ catalytic activity 
(Nasrollahzadeh et al. 2021b). 
Numerous studies have shown how chitosan and its derivatives successfully 
function to adsorb metal ions like lead, cadmium, copper, cobalt, rhodium, and 
nickel as well as oxyanions and complexed metal ions (Adeyemi et al. 2022). 
Chitosan is a common adsorbent for extracting metal ions from aqueous solutions 
and is one of the most used adsorbents in waste treatment. The primary factor 
influencing chitosan’s ability to bind metal ions is its amine groups (-NH2), which 
can serve as coordination sites for different metals. The degree of deacetylation, 
the kind of metal ion, and solution characteristics like pH all have an impact on 
how frequently metal is adsorbable (Wang et al. 2019). 
The removal of heavy metals from contaminated water has recently drawn 
attention to several adsorbents with high selectivity and metal-binding capabilities 
(Kaur et al. 2022). To improve the sorption selectivity and adsorption capability of 
chitosan for metal ions, several chitosan derivatives have been made by grafting 
extra functional groups such as succinic anhydride, heparin, histidine, and N, 
O-carboxymethyl through a cross-linked chitosan backbone (Gim et al. 2019). 
Chitosan has also undergone chemical changes to increase its selectivity and 
capacity toward heavy metal ions. To facilitate chitosan’s capacity for heavy metal 
adsorption, substituted chitosan was synthesized using a simple and effective
technique (Zhang et al. 2021b). 
The concentration of metal ions ultimately dropped as the immersion time 
was further extended. The maximum adsorption efficiency was achieved when 
unmodified chitosan was present. The best efficiency is 99.4% and 99.8%, 
respectively, when Co (II) and Cu (II) metal ions are present in an alkaline medium 
(pH 9) (Kalak et al. 2021). In a neutral medium, the adsorption efficiency is 47.2%
and 73.9%, respectively (pH 7). The adsorption effectiveness of glycine-chitosan 
modified biosorbents dropped to 94.1% and 95.4%, respectively, in the presence of
Co (II) and Cu (II) in an alkaline medium (pH 9) (Wang et al. 2018). In a neutral 
solution (pH 7), the adsorption effectiveness of Co (II) and Cu (II) metal ions were 
 
218 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
reduced by 34.4 % and 65.8 %, respectively. The adsorption effectiveness of the 
biopolymer treated with chloroacetic acid followed a similar pattern for Co (II) 
and Cu (II) metal ions (Emamy et al. 2021). In an alkaline medium, Co (II) and 
Cu (II) had adsorption efficiencies of 65,3% and 78,2%, respectively. However, 
the adsorption efficiency dropped to 26.6 and 34.4 %, respectively, when the
medium’s pH was adjusted to neutral (pH 7). In an alkaline medium, the process 
of metal ion adsorption is more efficient than it is in a neutral one. Additionally, 
cobalt ions are less likely to adsorb than copper ions (Kwak et al. 2019). 
2. Chitosan-supported catalysts 
The development of biomaterial-supported catalysts for green chemical 
synthesis has drawn more attention in recent years. Polysaccharides are 
frequently utilized as substrates for biocatalysts in the synthesis of complex 
compounds due to their outstanding properties, including non-toxicity, 
renewability, availability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability (Bilal et al. 
2019). The N-deacetylated derivative of chitin, chitosan, offers an excellent 
substitute to other biomaterials for the immobilization of catalytic metals due 
to its availability of amine and hydroxyl chelating functional groups, physical 
moldability (to provide porous open framework hydrogels), stability of metal 
ions, and chemical flexibility due to the chemical change of amino groups 
(Rafiee et al. 2019). 
Chitosan is a chitin derivative that is created by deacetylating the chitin 
polymer. It is a biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, and environmentally 
friendly biopolymer (Peter et al. 2021). Although chitosan has diverse applications, 
its inability to dissolve in water limits the scope of those uses. To make chitosan 
soluble in aqueous fluids, it is therefore subjected to various changes. Numerous 
carboxymethyl chitosan derivatives that are water-soluble have been created 
(Journot et al. 2020). 
Chitosan has the potential to function as a useful stabilizing polymer for 
metal nanoparticles, reducing metal ions to a zero-valent oxidation state while 
managing nanoparticle development. This biopolymer’s significant affinity for
interacting with the metal nanoparticles resulted in stability and prevented metal 
leaching (Ken et al. 2020). 
To create coordination sites, chitosan has been functionalized chitosan-metal 
complexes have created heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation, cycloaddition, 
oxidative carboxylation of olefins, acetalization, hydrogenation, cyclopropanation
of olefins, and cross-coupling mechanisms (Rafiee et al. 2018).
2.1 Chitosan-supported catalyst containing cobalt 
Several highly effective and magnetically recyclable cobalt catalytic systems 
(Co-ligand@MNPs/Ch) were produced by integrating magnetic chitosan with 
a few stable and easily accessible organic compounds (Hajipour et al. 2021). 
CHNS, FT-IR, SEM, TGA, XRD, TEM, VSM, and ICP-OES are a few of  
 
Cobalt, Copper, and Rhodium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 219 
the physicochemical methods that were used to confirm the structure of 
these nanocomposites (Ouardi et al. 2021). In moderate and environmentally 
friendly reaction conditions, these nanocomposites demonstrate excellent 
catalytic efficiency for Suzuki and Heck cross-coupling reactions. Our 
catalysts’ advantages include easy accessibility to raw materials, the ability to 
function in the presence of air, and environmentally benign circumstances (Honk 
et al. 2020). 
Electrostatic interactions and the density functional theory (DFT) model of 
the molecular approach were also used to characterize and gain insight into the 
function and impact of the ligands present in these catalysts (Sellaoui et al. 2019). 
First, a model reaction involving the reactions of bromobenzene and 
phenylacetylene was designed, and the effects of various variables such as catalyst
concentrations, base, solvent, and temperature were examined (Munusamy et
al. 2019). The produced catalyst’s catalytic activity was also tested in a control 
experiment under identical reaction circumstances, along with that of magnetic 
chitosan and cobalt-free magnetic nanofiber (Amrutha et al. 2022). Finally, it was 
determined that K3PO4 and polyethylene glycol (PEG-200) were the best bases and 
solvents, respectively. The other ideal parameters were chosen to be 60 degrees 
with 5 milligrams of catalyst. After the reaction conditions were improved, the 
range of the catalyst Co-DMM@MNPs/Cs in the Sonogashira coupling reaction 
was broadened to include the reaction of aryl halides and phenylacetylene with 
varied electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents as shown in 
Scheme 1 (Nair et al. 2021). 
The coupling products had high yields due to the electron-withdrawing and 
electron-donating substituents of aryl halides (62%–82%). Aryl chlorides remained 
inactive under these circumstances, but the reaction of sterically inhibited aryl 
halides likewise produced a high yield of the appropriate product (Babij et al. 
2019). 
Scheme 1. Sonogashira coupling reactions of Co-DMM@MNPs/Cs are shown, 
and the conditions are optimized 
Using an external magnetic bar, it is simple to remove the produced catalyst 
Co-DMM@MNPs/Cs from the reaction media and re-use it for additional reaction
runs. Six recycling of Co-DMM@MNPs/Cs is possible without significantly
lowering coupling yields. ICP-AES was used to determine the precise quantity 
of cobalt used in the final catalytic process, and it was discovered that only 15% 
of cobalt was lost (Mohajer et al. 2021). 220 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
Pure cobalt nanoparticle (Co-NPs) and a complex of cobalt N-heterocyclic 
ligands supported by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Co-NHC@MWCNTs)
were synthesized as the catalyst (Han et al. 2019). In green solvents, this catalyst 
produced very high yields of derivatives of propargylamine. The catalytic system 
is simply recoverable and may be utilized seven times without losing any of its 
functionality (Darroudi et al. 2021). To compare the two catalytic systems, the 
Sonogashira reaction of phenylacetylene and iodobenzene was carried out in their 
presence (Scheme 2 and Scheme 3). Four equivalents of KOH in EtOH/H2O

Scheme 3. Aryl halide cross-coupling with terminal acetylenes by Sonogashira in the 
presence of Co-NPs Cobalt, Copper, and Rhodium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 221 
at 65°C were used in the process. The necessary compounds were produced in 
acceptable yields by effectively coupling aryl chlorides, which were less reactive 
and showed greater reactivity, with aryl iodides (Cook et al. 2021). 
The use of both catalysts resulted in excellent yields of up to 98 percent for 
the reaction catalyzed by Co-NPs and a still-good yield of up to 91 percent for 
the procedure catalyzed by Co-NHC@MWCNTs. As demonstrated, the Co-N￾heterocyclic ligand molecule exhibits higher activity (Cheng et al. 2020). 
Another example is the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction which is one of the 
most often used techniques for creating carbon-carbon bonds in organic synthesis. 
Commercially, this reaction is used to produce a variety of compounds, including 
active medicinal components (Salih et al. 2019). Despite having strong catalytic 
activity, palladium metal’s employment in Suzuki cross-coupling reactions is 
undesired because of its availability, high cost, and toxicity. Pharmaceutical 
products have standard limits of palladium traces that are typically established 
at ppm levels (Diyali et al. 2022). As a result, there is an increasing desire to 
change it for better alternatives that make use of the Earth’s abundant metals. 
First-row transition metals, such as Suzuki cross-coupling reactions with nickel 
and iron catalysts, are particularly attractive in this respect (Nassar et al. 2021). 
These catalytic systems have several benefits, including cost, accessibility, 
and efficiency, but they also have significant drawbacks, including the inability 
to be reused. It is necessary to use a unique catalytic mechanism to get around 
this constraint (Sestelo et al. 2020). The cross-coupling reaction of aryl halides 
with phenylboronic acid has been described here, and heterogeneous cobalt 
catalysts synthesized from reliable, non-toxic, and easily available commercial 
precursors have been used. We are unaware of any reports of Suzuki reactions 
with a heterogonous cobalt catalyst (Sobhani et al. 2020). 
One of the other most important reactions in organic synthesis is the Heck 
cross-coupling reaction, which is used in the agrochemical, pharmaceutical, 
and fine chemical industries (Devendar et al. 2018). Palladium is a common 
component in Heck couplings’ conventional catalytic mechanism. However, the 
use of palladium-free catalytic systems is more interesting in the context of current 
organic synthesis due to its high cost and toxicity (Zhu et al. 2019). Nevertheless, 
a variety of synthetic processes using nickel-based palladium-free catalysts are 
available. Heck reactions have been seen for copper, iron, and cobalt. Cobalt 
stands out among them because it is easily accessible, non-toxic, inexpensive, 
stable, and has potent catalytic properties (Goetzke et al. 2021). There are a few 
studies on the Heck coupling reaction’s use of cobalt catalysts. For instance, 
cobalt nanoparticles were reported in 2009 by Qi et al. as a catalyst for the Heck 
cross-coupling process (Bankar et al. 2020). It is noteworthy that the class of aryl 
halides was not described, despite the challenging reaction conditions. Recently, 
Zhu et al. employed uniform Co-B amorphous alloy nanoparticles as a catalyst 
in the Heck process as shown in Scheme 4 (Wang et al. 2020). 
Nanoparticle-based catalytic systems frequently exhibit more activity than 
comparable bulk materials because of their high surface-to-volume ratio as shown  
222 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
in Table 1. However, the catalytic activity of the nanoparticles is diminished 
when they group to create bigger bulk particles. Utilizing the right stabilizers or 
protective chemicals will help you prevent it (Hajipour et al. 2020).

Aryl halide (1.0 mmol), methyl acrylate (1.1 mmol), K3PO4 (4.0 equiv.), and 
1 mg of catalyst (2.4 mol percent of Co) were used in the reaction, which was 
conducted at 40°C for one hour (Lee et al. 2021). 
2.2 Chitosan-supported catalyst containing copper 
It was possible to make a very effective and easily recoverable heterogeneous Cu 
catalyst for the production of aryl sulfones by simply swirling an aqueous solution 
of chitosan in water containing copper ions (Zare et al. 2020). The coupling of 
aryl halides with sodium sulfinates to easily produce the corresponding sulfones 
in good to excellent yields was catalyzed by the chitosan@copper catalyst as 
shown in Scheme 5 and with varying substrates and reaction conditions shown in 
Table 2. Numerous re-uses of the highly active catalyst are possible without losing 
any of its catalytic power. Additionally, this process made it simple to create the 
commercially available medication zolimidine (antiulcer) as shown in Scheme 6 
(Reddy et al. 2021). 
The CuSO4, CuI, and Cu(OAc)2 CS-supported copper salts are often 
synthesized using the following method: to create the catalyst, chitosan was 
immersed in an aqueous medium of CuSO4, CuI, or Cu(OAc)2 for three hours Cobalt, Copper, and Rhodium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 223 
under neutral circumstances at 50°C (Chang et al. 2020). After copper adsorption, 
the material was thoroughly washed to remove any remaining Cu compounds. 
Then, it was dried underneath the vacuum at 50°C for a whole night to generate 
the chitosan@copper catalyst (Narayanan et al. 2020).

224 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
The material was extensively cleaned to remove any stray Cu compounds 
following the extraction of copper ions from wastewater using a chitosan 
membrane, and then it was dried under a vacuum at 50°C overnight to form the 
chitosan@copper catalyst (Lu et al. 2022). 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), inductively coupled plasma￾atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), 
X-ray diffraction (XRD), and infrared analysis (FT-IR) have all been used to
analyze catalysts (Niakan et al. 2020). According to FT-IR characterization of 
the chitosan catalysts, the pure chitosan powder displayed unique absorption 
bands of O–H and N–H stretching vibrations of amine groups at 3440 cm-1. 
When compared to chitosan, the peak at 3426 cm-1 for the CS@copper catalysts 
is sharper and stronger. The peaks at about 1085, 1384, 1606, and 2877–2925 
cm-1 are corresponding to the chitosan molecules’ C–OH, C–N, N–H, and C–H 
stretching models, respectively (Hu et al. 2021). The copper catalysts’ FT-IR 
results showed that the metal Cu coordinates with the molecules -NH2 and -OH. 
However, the thermal stability is relatively low than that of chitosan due to the 
drop in the number of principal amino groups on further coordination with the 
metal Cu (Huang et al. 20201). Importantly, the TG demonstrated the durability 
of these catalysts up to 200 °C, indicating that they are compatible with the 
majority of organic reactions due to their high thermal stability. The copper metal’s 
signals were not detected by XRD because of its chelation with chitosan or even 
its low percentage level (Xu et al. 2021). The results of the TEM investigation 
revealed that the dispersion of the copper nanoparticles was excellent and that 
their average diameter was between 3 and 8 nm. ICP-AES was used to measure 
the copper loading levels of the catalysts, and the values were 1.95, 1.50, and 
1.46 mmol g-1 (Wei et al. 2021). 
The recovery and recycling of the catalyst is a major issue with a transition￾metal catalyzed process for sustainability, both economically and environmentally 
concerned. This is due to the frequent high cost and toxicity of transition metal 
catalysts (Dhawa et al. 2021). A simple filtration was adequate to separate the 
catalyst solution from the products owing to the high solubility of the products and 
the catalyst’s insolubility within the solvent. The C–S coupling reaction was then 
used to examine the catalyst’s recyclability (Caliskan et al. 2021). The separated 
CS@Cu(OAc)2 was recharged in the recycling experiment with a new substrate 
for the subsequent run under the same reaction conditions. It was remarkable 
that even after being utilized five times, the catalyst was still catalytically active. 
The required product was produced via the C–S coupling reaction with yields of 
87% and 85% in the fourth and fifth runs, respectively (Ding et al. 2018). 
Another example of an ion-containing chitosan-supported-catalyst is numerous 
C–N coupling reactions, including Buchwald-Hartwig amination processes, 
Chan-Lam coupling reactions, and Ullmann reactions, which are described in 
the literature (Cortes et al. 2019). Various metal catalysts, including nickel, 
palladium, and copper, are used in all of these reactions together with various 
coordinating ligands, including bisamines, amino acids, DPPF, phosphoramidites,  
 
 
Cobalt, Copper, and Rhodium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 225 
and oxime-phosphine oxides as shown by Table 3 (Zahmatkesh et al. 2019). 
The toxicity carried on by the presence of metals in the products is a severe 
drawback of these reactions, even though these catalysts and ligands are utilized 
at minimal loadings. Han et al. described N-arylation of amines/amino alcohols 
with aryl halides utilizing free CuCl as a catalyst as shown in Scheme 7 (Palacios
et al. 2021). This reaction has a longer reaction time (8 h), but it also results 
in substantial metal contamination of the end products. Therefore, it is highly 
essential to create novel approaches that take into account a decrease in reaction 
time, minimal metal contamination of products, simple reaction conditions, simple 
product and catalyst isolation, and catalyst renewability. Due to their low cost 
and low toxicity, applications of eco-friendly polymer-supported metal catalysts 
are particularly promising in this aspect (Miceli et al. 2021).
Scheme 7. Reaction yields of chitosan@copper-catalyzed C–N cross-couplings 
between aryl halides and diamines/amino alcohol in acetonitrile at 1 equiv and 2 equiv, 
respectively 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TGA, powder XRD, and IR analyses 
were used to characterize the produced chitosan@copper catalyst. To determine 
the size and shape of the manufactured copper catalyst with chitosan incorporated, 
a SEM analysis at a 15 kV accelerating voltage is used (Jayaramudu et al. 2020). 
2.3 Chitosan-supported catalyst containing rhodium 
Transition metals have a variety of uses as catalysts, whether in their elemental 
state or as the central core of metal complexes. They may be in several oxidation 
states and readily switch between them, which allows them to lend or take 
electrons from various reagents, which is the major factor in their remarkable 
performance (Favre et al. 2022). As a result, transition metals work by combining 
with the reagent to produce complexes. There are just a few practical uses for 
transition metal complexes (TMCs), even though several research organizations 
have concentrated on their synthesis. This is because homogenous complexes 
have several serious drawbacks, including high cost, particular handling needs, 
challenges with recycling and reuse, and a non-contentious mode of operation 
(Liu et al. 2021). 
Numerous additional metals, including nickel, iron, copper, and rhodium, 
were successfully used for the Suzuki reaction after the development of the first

palladium catalyst (Arora et al. 2021). Rhodium-based catalysts were shown to 
be beneficial for the Suzuki reaction with halobenzens that retain both aldehydes 
and nitriles on their aromatic ring when used as nano- and micro-particles on 
diverse supports, providing efficient heterogeneous catalysts (Leviev et al. 2020). 
We finally introduced a simple and effective method for immobilizing TMCs in 
polysaccharide matrices. An aqueous solution of polysaccharides like Carrageenan 
types lambda (λ), iota (i), xanthan-gum (x), and kappa (κ) was combined with an 
aqueous solution of rhodium or palladium salts with sodium triphenylphosphine 
trisulfonate (TPPTS) as a ligand to produce the heterogeneous catalysts

FTIR analysis showed that the resulting xerogels, or “sponge-like” solid 
catalyst systems, allowed the recycling of the catalyst without the complex 
being leached. This was only achieved by forming a new linkage between 
the hydroxyl groups on the polysaccharide and the sodium sulfonic acid salt 
on the TPPTS ligand (Leviev et al. 2019). Due to their renewable nature, 
biodegradability, and low toxicity, polysaccharides derived from natural sources, 
such as carrageenans, and chitosan, cellulose, have subsequently found several 
uses in the biomedical product, pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and building 
block sectors. A variety of polysaccharides were also utilized as substrates for 
metal catalysts, notably palladium and rhodium catalysts for the Suzuki process, 
resulting in heterogeneous and recyclable systems (Wolfson et al. 2020). 
The homogeneous reaction with rhodium chloride saw a poor conversion rate 
when a polysaccharide was added, in contrast to the reactions with palladium 
(Bauer et al. 2020). This led to the hypothesis that rhodium, unlike palladium, 
would interact with the ligands on the polymer backbone and, as a result, might 
be attached to the polysaccharide even in the lack of a ligand. In light of these 
earlier results, the goal of this work is to clarify the interaction between rhodium 
and polysaccharides and assess the viability of using it as a heterogeneous catalyst 
for the Suzuki process (Villemin et al. 2019). 
The heterogenization of several polysaccharides which are derived from 
natural sources takes place on a relatively simple, ligand-free rhodium chloride 
medium. The Suzuki cross-coupling of halobenzenes with phenylboronic acid 
and sodium carbonate in ethanol utilizing the novel heterogeneous catalysts is 
shown in Scheme 8 (Ontman et al. 2021). 
Scheme 8. Suzuki cross-coupling of halobenzene and phenylboronic acid 
To sum things up, RhCl3 was successfully immobilized to a straight￾forward procedure, and it was successfully used in a Suzuki cross-coupling 
process. The salt did not seep into the reaction mixture, and the catalyst was 
successfully regenerated with a rise in activity during the first and second recycles
(Kadib et al. 2020). In addition, the evaluation of the lyophilized -RhCl3 system 
showed that the salt is integrated into the support even though FTIR indicated 
that there is probably no new link between the salt and the polymer (Peng et 
al. 2022). Additionally, SEM images show that the addition of RhCl3 produced 
a structure that was more porous and structured than the native one, pointing 
to a potential interaction between the two (Loreto et al. 2021). Additionally, 
XPS research revealed a typical Rh+3 binding energy when the heterogeneous 
catalyst’s Rh:Cl atomic ratio was about 3:1 (Bai et al. 2020). Finally, viscosity  
 
 
228 Polymer Supported Organic Catalysts 
studies showed that RhCl3 interacts with polysaccharides since adding RhCl3 to 
an aquatic solution caused the viscosity to rise. It was therefore proposed that 
the rhodium salt was not entrapped inside the polysaccharide matrix but rather 
was immobilized by -carrageenan coordination to RhCl3 via the sulphate groups 
in their backbone (Hammi et al. 2020). 
Another example is hydroformylation, which has been extensively employed 
in industry to produce aldehydes from alkenes. The OXEA method, which has 
been generating 8.0 × 105 tons of C4 and C5 aldehydes from propene or butene 
yearly since 1984, is a significant case in point (Sole et al. 2020). The catalyst 
used in this procedure is Rh/P(C6H4SO3Na)3 (TPPTS). Aldehydes are the raw 
material used to create a variety of beneficial secondary products, including
specialized chemicals (which are relevant to the organic synthesis of fragrances 
and complex natural products) and alcohols (used to make detergents). Production 
capacity grew to 6.6 × 106
 tons in 1995 (Mika et al. 2018). The creation of highly 
active and selective catalysts for the hydroformylation process utilizing various 
transition metals has received a lot of attention during the past several decades. 
Due to their high activity and selectivity under more favorable circumstances, Rh 
complex-based catalysts are the most often utilized for this reaction (Motokura 
et al. 2021). 
However, issues with the separation of the catalyst/product combination
have restricted the industry’s use of homogeneous hydroformylation systems in 
practice. Distillation separation is also a time-consuming, energy-intensive, and 
equipment-corrosive process (Shende et al. 2019). As a result, several techniques 
have been used to address this issue, including supported aqueous phase, ionic 
liquids, aqueous biphasic, supported liquid phase, supercritical fluids, and 
supported ionic liquid-phase catalysts (Jin et al. 2019). Despite solving the 
separation problem, these methods frequently lead to metal leaching and poor 
aldehyde product regioselectivity. Alternatives include immobilizing homogeneous 
catalysts on solid supports such as mesoporous materials, metal oxides, polymers, 
dendritic scaffolds, and various forms of carbon (Cho et al. 2020). 
Researchers have lately looked to biopolymers as supports for transition metal 
catalysts due to their apparent renewability, abundance in nature, biodegradability, 
and non-toxicity. Several biopolymers, namely starch, cellulose, gelatin, chitosan, 
and alignate, have been suggested in this context. These activities do result in 
more environmentally friendly and sustainable chemistry (Carrion et al. 2021). 
It is simple to alter the amine groups in chitosan to provide ligand 
donor sites for efficient and reliable metal coordination. The creation of fresh
chitosaniminophosphine Pd catalysts for carbon-carbon cross-coupling processes 
was recently reported (Goff et al. 2020). The catalysts provided yields that were on 
a level with or better than those made using a homogeneous catalyst of a related 
kind. They also exhibited excellent activity. As part of our continuous efforts to 
expand the utilization of the chitosan-Schiff base ligands, the first occurrences 
of chitosan-iminopyridyl and -iminophosphine Rh complexes have been created. 
An unmodified chitosan-Rh catalyst was reportedly employed for 1-hexene 
 
Cobalt, Copper, and Rhodium Containing Polymer-supported Catalyst 229 
hydroformylation processes in the past, but no research on metal leaching or 
catalyst recyclability was published (Burkart et al. 2019). 
We now present the preparation, characterization, and analysis of the new 
supported catalysts used in the hydroformylation of 1-octene. The utilization of 
biodegradable and non-toxic biopolymer support and the atom economy are two 
green chemistry concepts that are used in this study (Raghuvanshi et al. 2020). The 
hydroformylation activity of model mononuclear Rh homogeneous catalysts has 
also been produced and investigated in comparison to that of their heterogenized 
counterparts (Siangwata et al. 2019). 
By treating chitosan-Schiff base ligands (1 and 2) with [RhCl(CO)2], chitosan￾supported Rh catalysts (3 and 4) were quickly created as shown above in Scheme 
9. As a result, dry acetone was heated to room temperature while the appropriate 
chitosan-Schiff base ligand (loading values: 0.12 mmol g-1 (1) and 0.13 mmol g-1 
(2)) was mixed with too much [RhCl(CO)2]2. The supported catalysts (3 and 4) 
were successfully manufactured into stable light-orange and purple solids with 
good yields (Garba et al. 2021). 
Microanalysis, FT-IR, UV-vis, solid state 31P and 13C NMR spectroscopy,
ICP-MS, PXRD, and TEM have all been used to describe them. These techniques
have been used to confirm that the reported structure of the chitosan-supported Rh
catalysts (3 and 4) and the predicted structure of the chitosan Schiff base ligands 
(1 and 2) are accurate (Yazdanseta et al. 2022).

3. Conclusion 
Compared to the typical heating approach, this catalyst demonstrated outstanding 
activity with a slower reaction time and much less catalyst. When the catalyst’s 
reusability was tested, it was discovered that it could be reused up to seven 
times. Tests for mercury toxicity and leaching also revealed that the catalyst 
was heterogeneous. As a result of its benefits, including ease of setup, quick 
reaction times, high reaction yields, the lack of solvents, high selectivity with 
low catalyst amounts, long lifetimes, high thermal stability, high TON and TOF 
values, renewability, and the presence of oxygen and moisture insensitivities, we 
can anticipate that this new efficient synthesis technique with a novel catalyst 
will find use in a wide range of applications in various fields.
