Preface
Our book is intended to be significantly different from other process design books. The expected
readership will include recent graduates from chemical engineering schools as well as engineers
re-assigned to process design. The book will be shorter relative to some previous books. We believe
this – along with the content – will recommend itself to selective and even complete reading. With
regard to recent graduates, this book may serve as a “finishing school” to fill in concepts that the
curriculum omitted or covered inadequately.
It is divided into two main sections: the first covering topics such as synthesis and process mod￾elling, one of two essential prototyping (process verification) methods discussed in this book. Sage
advice on prototyping using pilot plantsis also provided. The process verification steps – from paper
design to pilot plant, to semi-works, to commercial facility – to minimize the chance of project
problems are discussed. In the chapter “Operating Problems: Solution by Design,” ten common
problems are identified that can crop up in an operating plant, and some means are proposed to
circumvent them.
In the second section (Chapters 11 through 20), the selection of technologies for a design is
approached by explaining the technology (e.g. heat exchangers) but by focusing on the process
needs and relating those to technologies that can be utilized. An effort has been made to ferret out
the whole range of technologies, some obscure, that are possibilities for each need. Furthermore,
the book utilizes chemical engineering principles to help a designer prioritize the design needs.
In addition to the usual suspects of technologies used in the design of chemical processes – such
as reactions, separations, heat transfer, mass transfer, and so forth – a variety of process needs not
covered in many undergraduate programs or process design books are discussed, such as:
● Formation, Modification, and Transportation of Solids
● Mixing, Blending, and Agitation
● Integrated Process Operations.
Patents are rarely discussed, but they should be. This book discusses intellectual property for the
process designer.
Keith Marchildon and David Modyxv
To Keith: Dedication and Foreword
Keith Marchildon didn’t live long enough to see this joint book with his friend and colleague David
Mody published, but it is the culmination of his life-long dream. From as far back as we, Keith’s
five children, can remember, writing a book had always been on Keith’s list of things to do. How￾ever, this list was long, encompassing Keith’s many responsibilities, ambitions, and interests. Keith
placed a high value on family, community, and service to others, which had to be balanced with his
professional responsibilities and academic pursuits.
In addition to raising the five of us with his wife Joan, Keith led boy scout troops, was an active
member of his church, organized university reunions, taught engineering courses at Queen’s Uni￾versity and elsewhere, created and presented courses on nylon polymerization fundamentals to his
DuPont colleagues around the world, wrote and acted in skits for the annual Dupont Christmas
party, and hosted grandchildren, cousins, DuPont and extended family at his cottage, all while
becoming one of the foremost technical authorities at Dupont Canada and being promoted to
DuPont fellow in 2000. From 2010, Keith was the primary caregiver for Joan on her journey with
Alzheimer’s, noting that for the first 40 years of their marriage she had cared for all of us, and now
it was his turn to take care of her.
True to his engineering training, Keith believed that any problem could be resolved with a suf￾ficient application of thought and analysis. Moreover, the solution to any problem starts with a
consideration of first principles. He mulled over and researched issue after issue, including getting
up to speed as much as necessary on new technologies. Nevertheless, he drew the line when it
came to computer programming, insisting until the end on doing all his programming in Fortran.
Getting the right answer was always more important to Keith than a deadline.
It was only after Keith was diagnosed with cancer in February 2019 at the age of 82 that the
finiteness of his life – and the need to finish this book – came into stark view. Always deliberative,
Keith joked that his terminal cancer diagnosis was the first deadline that he truly couldn’t ignore.
Keith threw himself into the final stages of his book-writing the way he tackled most challenges
in life, with an intensity and energy that doesn’t come easy to many of us. Blessed with a steel
trap memory and a boundless love for learning and teaching, Keith spent many hours bent over in
complete stillness reading papers he had written or collected over the span of decades. Other times
we would find Keith lying in bed, hands behind his head as he worked through mathematical
problems in his mind, a look of pure contentment on his face.
Thankfully, Keith had more than two years after his diagnosis to collaborate with his friend and
colleague, David Mody, on this book. David completed the remaining work after Keith died in July
2021. We are exceptionally grateful to David for bringing their joint project to fruition and fulfilling
Keith’s dream.xvi To Keith: Dedication and Foreword
Keith’s efforts in this book reflect the high priority he put on teaching and the transfer of knowl￾edge to his kids, hisstudents, and his colleagues. We hope that this book contributes to the practice
of chemical engineering process design in a way that Keith had hoped.

Acknowledgments
Keith and I (Dave) have a long list of people whom we thank for contributing to the book. The
book’s origin dates back to professional development courses that Keith and other DuPont Canada
engineers developed and taught. I think we owe a thank you to those individuals for the beginning
of this endeavor. The notes for those courses turned into professional development courses that
Keith and I taught in various locations across Canada. Each course we taught brought unique and
interesting perspectives and questions from engineers across Canada, and we thank those partic￾ipants for that. Keith taught many courses at DuPont, Invista, and Queen’s and I know he would
want to thank those individuals. David’s work at Fluor Canada with the engineers, designers, and
managers made possible his lifelong enjoyment of learning from others and teaching engineer￾ing ways of thinking and the skills needed to do design. Those technical and management leaders
helped me to build a skill set and an enthusiasm for the creativity that underlies all of engineer￾ing. Several of those individuals have advised and contributed directly to this book, and I’m deeply
grateful for their time and commitment to helping myself and the next generation of designers. I
echo Keith’s sentiments of never letting an opportunity to learn pass you by, and to that, we owe a
lot to the many operations and maintenance people we worked with over the years.
In my second career, while working at Queen’s University,I worked with so many bright, aspiring
engineering students who, in many ways, contributed to this book through their enthusiasm, their
questions, and their monumental efforts to become engineers. I never really considered myself to
be teaching, as much as working with the students. In addition, a host of engineers and professors
helped with the courses I mentored, and they refined my understanding and teaching of design,
project management, and chemical engineering. I was blessed with the opportunity to see and
understand engineering from a remarkable variety of industries. The names are numerous, but
I would like to say thank you to all of them and to the ones who have answered my questions
and provided feedback and suggestions, an even larger thank you! Your contributions are truly
appreciated.
Keith was a devoted family person. We both owe a huge thank you to our wives and families for
their unwavering support and love.1

A Plan for Process Design
This book is about process design, the kind of design in which the knowledge and talents of a
chemical engineer are significantly required. Design may include selection, modification, and even
invention of equipment, as well as specification of operational sequences and conditions. Design
always involves choices.
Engineers perform many functions, but for most engineers, the chance to be a designer is at the
top of their ambition. Design is a chance to be creative, to integrate existing knowledge, and possibly
the opportunity to be famous – doubly so if the design does not work!
A design assignment may be small – a modification to an existing process – or it may be a whole
new plant. It may be a close duplicate of something else or a radical departure. However, the oper￾ative word is always “choice”.
At the very outset, the activity of process design must be distinguished from that of project
implementation or project management. Process design is part, but only a part, of a project. The
project only ends when everything is up and running. The project leader – usually an engineer –
has responsibility to see that all required engineering components are attended to, not just the
chemical ones, that regulatory permits are obtained, that funding is obtained, and that the system
is built and operational. The process designer is an integral part of the project implementation
team. If the project is small, the process designer may be the leader of the implementation team.
In any case, the designer needs to take this role as a member of the team seriously because there
are no accolades if the project fails, even if the design was great.
To be specific then, this book is about process design. One chapter is included to better explain
how projects are managed and how process design and project management mesh with each other.
The plan comprises the following three sections:
Principles of Project Design
Operations and Equipment
Appendices
We review each section here.
1.1 Principles of Process Design
In the 10 chapters of this section, the considerations that accompany all designs are presented.
Documents and Communications are given pride of place because the designer must get his or
her plans into the hands of others who will take the next step, which is in the hands of the rest of
the project team. There are formal ways of doing this, and they are explained.

The mention of “choice” above implies that the designer must Synthetize the process. This is a
creative operation with no step-by-step procedure. However, there are configurations and guide￾lines that chemical engineers know and which can help.
To back up the synthesis, the process designer engages in Experimentation and also in
Modeling. The gold standard for experimentation is the pilot plant, which, if designed thoughtfully
and the resultsinterpreted properly, provides a huge help to the success of the commercial unit. But
pilot plants are expensive, all-inclusive, and have issues with scale-up. Modeling of key elements
can be cheaper, whether it is physical modeling, computational fluid modeling, or mathematical
modeling of the transport and chemical phenomenon. Sometimes a simple homemade model
suffices: Math modeling should be in every engineer’s bag of skills.
Solution by Design addresses some of the untoward problems that often arise in the operation of
an eventual process, such things as corrosion, interaction between vessels, etc. Ten items are listed
and probably many more could be. Better to deal with them at the design phase rather than be
surprised at the operational stage.
Process Monitoring and Control are integral parts of the process design. Control is obvious,
although subject to various strategies to make it sharper and to various equipment choices.
Monitoring is not so obvious, especially to management who are trying to cut costs. However,
the conscientious process designer insists on heavy monitoring to assist the personnel who will
subsequently operate and troubleshoot and modify the system. Who knows, it might be the
designer themselves.
Safety and Health are paramount concerns these days for all industries, in spite of past transgres￾sions over earlier decades and centuries. The chemical industries are highly regarded in their efforts
to keep their workers safe, to make safe products, and to protect the integrity of their worksites and
the people and land around them. There are formal procedures for making this happen.
Protecting the Environment is part ofsafety and health, namely the well-being of the world around
the plant or process. It has risen over the years to be a major part of new industrial installations.
It is highly regulated and rightly so.
Project Economics, Capital Cost Estimates, and Operating Cost estimates may seem like more of
a task for the project manager or for management in general. However, there is no use building a
wonderful process design if it is obvious that it will be a technical success but an economic failure.
The designer may want to keep an eye on what others are doing with the cost figures to make sure
that items are evaluated fairly and that costs for extraneous items are not being added on.
And finally, Project Implementation is addressed since the process designer is an integral part of
the project team and may often find her or himself lying on the critical scheduling path.
Thus, ends the general considerations that all process designs must adhere to, to a greater or
lesser extent.
We turn now to resources for designing specific processes.
1.2 Operations and Equipment
The approach here is to list according to process needs, rather than according to technologies.
For instance, a design might require a miscible solution of two liquids to be separated. The obvi￾ous choice might be distillation, but there are other methods, and these will be described. In some
cases, the technologies are described more than once because they serve more than one design
need. Hopefully, a full palette of technologies is described, but of course, the genius of chemical
engineering from time to time results in new and improved methods.1.2 Operations and Equipment 3
The sequence was meant to start at the plant door and to proceed stepwise through the plant.
But plants do not operate in a linear fashion. However, the first of the eleven parts of this section
does start at the beginning.
Bulk Shipping and Storage of Gases, Vapors, Liquids, and Solids are common to many operations,
with a variety of modes depending on the phase and nature of the material.
In-Plant Transport of Liquids, Liquid–Solid Mixtures(Slurries), and Liquid–Gas Mixtures, with the
combinations quite common but generally not taught in initial chemical engineering education.
In-Plant Transport and Compression of Gases, which because of variable density, are more com￾plicated than other phases.
In-Plant Transport of Solids: Solids being very common in the chemical industry, yet their trans￾port is not much touched on academically.
Formation and Modification of Solids are again not much studied in initial chemical engineering
education but important because solids are more susceptible to modification than liquids or gases.
Solids may be comminuted or built up, including by 3-D printing these days. Solids may be melted
and recast, and they may be made into film or laminates, or spun into fibers, or converted into
extremely tiny nanoparticles.
Energy Transfer is a very frequent accompaniment of other operations, i.e., in heating and cool￾ing and changing phase of materials. This includes sensible effects as well as vaporization and
condensation. Liquids, gases, and solids as well as combinations require various treatments.
Mixing, Blending, and Agitation are ubiquitous in chemical plants. Similar phases and mixed
phases generally require different equipment. Material properties – e.g., the viscosity of a liquid –
may call for radically different agitators.
Separation of materials is also found generally somewhere along a process. Mechanical
Separations remove separate immiscible phases from one another using a surprising number of
techniques suited to specific occasions.
Molecular Separations, by contrast, are used to break apart a single phase into more than one
phase, with the object of having the different phases richer or poorer in various components.
Not every process design includes chemical reaction, but, of course, chemical engineers require
the ability to design reactors. Many general Chemical Reactors are described.
For biochemical applications, there are additional restrictions, so a small treatment is provided
of Biochemical Reactors.
One of the talked about topics of the day is processintegration to reduce costs, increase efficiency,
and reduce “footprint.” We finish this section with a part on Integrated Operations.5

Documentation and Communication
All communication is essentially good. For chemical and chemical engineering projects, a set of
formal documents has evolved over the years, which is almost universally used. The production
of some of these documents is the sole prerogative of the process designer or process design team.
Others have shared responsibility with other members of the project team, including management,
to a greater or lesser extent.
Here is a summary of the possible documents that can accompany a project. The list is arranged
chronologically. The names may differ from organization to organization, but the content and
sequence are universal.
1. Basic data – responsibility of management sponsor, laying out the goals and constraints of the
projects.
2. Process flow diagram (PFD) and the heat and material balance – graphically displaying the
result of process synthesis, showing the flow and properties of internal and external streams.
An accompanying process description document may also be provided for the purpose of
clarity.
3. Equipment list – evolving as equipment becomes better defined, providing key parametersthat
can be used for an initial and ongoing estimate of capital cost, and providing key information
for other disciplines such as weights, size, and so on for preliminary design and estimating.
4. Piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) – showing interconnections and interactions
between vessels and the required instrumentation hardware and controllers.
5. Equipment data sheets – showing details, as they are calculated, about each major piece of
equipment; added by other specialists and vendors so that quotes can be provided.
6. Instrument data sheets.
7. Functional specifications for distributed control system (DCS) to augment the P&IDs.
8. Scope of work and cost estimation.
9. Notes from process hazard review.
10. Input to applications for environmental permits.
11. After the project has been approved and before plant start-up, training manual and operating
instructions.
12. Maintenance instructions.
13. Record of design calculations for future troubleshooting and modification of the system.
This is a formidable list and does not apply in full to every project. For a large project, several
people may be involved in creating these documents. Of course, if management eventually decides

against proceeding with the project, then some documents (e.g. operating instructions) would be
curtailed or never be written.
Here is an overview of the general content of each document.
2.1 Basic Data
Projects always start with a sponsor, i.e., someone who can authorize the money. That person or
persons may be wishing to make a new product and will convey in the basic data document the
production rate and characteristics (e.g. purity) of that product. The sponsor may be a government
agency and perhaps wish to build a facility to deal with a waste stream. Again, the rate is given,
and, in this case, the purity of the stream leaving the facility is specified. In particular cases, there
may be additional requirements and constraints. The key is to ensure that the process designer and
the project team deliver what the sponsor asks for. The document also serves as a reference point
for any subsequent negotiation between the sponsor and the team as the details of the project start
to emerge.
Sponsors and designers will engage in producing a workable document and may wish to refer
to writings on this subject, such as Read (2000), Manganaro (2002), Ainsworth and Brocklebank
(2003), Pavone (2006), Buckbee (2010), Lagace (2011), Ogle and Carpenter (2014), and Toghraei
(2015).
2.2 Process Flow Diagram (PFD)
The PFD can be drawn for any process but is most commonly illustrated for continuous processes.
It consists of a sheet on which schematics of the major vessels are located. The interconnec￾tions between the vessels are shown with arrows. Every flow stream is indicated with a number.
The streams are listed in a table outside the diagram,showing their properties, e.g., phase, flow rate
of each of the components in the stream (kg s−1), temperature, pressure, and physical properties.
In some jurisdictions, this information is listed on the diagram itself, but this can introduce clutter
and make it difficult to list extra information about the streams,so it issimplest to have itseparated
in a table. The details of the flows, in the initial version of the PFD, may be simply what the process
designer wishes them to be, with no reference to the actual equipment that will produce these
flows. Design of the equipment can come later. Nasby (2012) saw PFDs as communication tools.
The example shown in Figure 2.1 is a chemical reactor feeding into the side of a distillation
column, with recycle from the top of the distillation column back to near the entrance point of
the reactor. Near the top of the column, there is a waste or purge stream. At the bottom of the
column, almost pure product B emergesready forsale. Thisis a very common scenario in chemical
process systems, which deals with the situation where one possibility is that the reaction of A to B
approaches equilibrium. Another is that B has a tendency to degrade into C and B is removed as
quickly as possible. The seven streams are numbered as follows:
1. raw material feed stream,
2. the exit from the reactor,
3. the recycle return flow to the reactor,
4. the pure B product stream from the bottom of the distillation column, and
5. 6 and 7 – the streams around the C-purge unit.2.2 Process Flow Diagram (PFD) 7

Thisisthe way the processisintended to operate and for which the designer hasspecified the size,
geometry, and operating conditions. Subsequently, the details of the vessels will be worked out and
will appear in the equipment data sheets. A process description similar to the description above is
a useful document for communication to other members of the team.
For simplicity in this example (Figure 2.1), all components A, B, and C have the same molecular
weights. The order of volatilities is “A” (most volatile), “C”, and “B”.
The flow data are useful to other members of the team, particularly the pipe designers who
need to know the flow and properties of the stream and any corrosion potential. The principal
vessels on the chart may have names attached to them, but in many cases, this is not done to
avoid giving a competitor information in case the sheet falls into the wrong hands. PFDs are gen￾erally quite guarded by the enterprise and released to other employees only with a need to know.
For aesthetic purposes, the vessels are usually shown with rounded corners rather than squared
corners.
The choice of flows for this process is dictated by the amount of product that the manufacturer
wants this process to yield. Some of the vessels, when eventually chosen, would be quite capable of
outperforming theirrate in this particular flow sheet. All of the flows have to be consistent with one
another and one way would be to count the atomic species in the streams in the PFD. The numbers
in the flow table should be checked for consistency with the reaction kinetics or conversions and
the vessel sizes.
The flow table can and should display more data than shown, especially the phases of the
stream. In this case, only stream 6 and stream 3 before the condenser are vapor; all the rest
is liquid.8 2 Documentation and Communication
2.2.1 PFD for Batch Processes
The continuous version of the PFD does not lend itself to batch processes because the flow streams
are not constant. There is, in fact, no hard and fastrule that diagrams have to appear on a flow sheet;
however, they do assist engineering personnel in interpreting the sheet for any process. In batch
processing, there may be a single vessel which undergoes various cycles or there could be two or
more vessels all of which need to be described.
Consider the example of a single vessel undergoing four cycles of operation from start to finish
(Figure 2.2). In the first cycle, the pressure rises autogenously with temperature. In the second
cycle, the pressure is kept constant by virtue of the release of volatile material from the vessel.
In the third cycle, the pressure is reduced. In the fourth cycle, the material is expelled from the
vessel. A single image of the vessel would suffice, but an alternative is to show an image for each
cycle since the valves or pumps can be shown as on or off for each cycle. In this case, four copies
of the vessel could be printed on the process flow sheet. The figure shows two of the cycles, with
the time-wise progression of the variables during the initial pressurization and then during the
emptying.
Sometimes a batch process uses an extra feed somewhere along its process path. Thisis known as
a batch-fed process. A particular cycle in which this feed is introduced is separated into two cycles.
The additional feed also has a time line for the time it takes to be introduced: its time, pressure,
temperature, flow, and composition are listed out in the same manner as the actual emissions of
the main process vessel. Note that this is an addition rather than an emission. Once again, the
full rate out of the vessel is useful to the piping designer. In these situations, it is useful to docu￾ment the instantaneous flow rate for sizing pipes, etc., and the time average flow rate for material
consumption and yearly production.
In some cases, one batch vessel feeds to another. In that case, the above treatment is required,
again with data along horizontal time lines. The time lines have to be coordinated between the
two vessels. In multiproduct batch plants, vessels may have to be shown many times because their
cycles are specific to given products. In such an arrangement, if common pipes are employed for

different flows, then the diagram requires more imagination. Creating a PFD for a batch process is
discussed by Cooper and Moore (2013).
******
For both continuous and batch processes, the PFD is a living document. It begins with sketch￾ing the proposed equipment items but only indicating their function and their interconnectivity.
The flows and properties of the streams are then added, but these are what is intended by the pro￾cess designer based on the chemistry and phase behavior of the materials. The design of equipment
follows, in order to effectuate the desired material transformations. The process flow sheet will live
on to assist future workers in understanding the process. The calculations which led to the PFD
and its development need to be available to future workers. We have not discussed simulators and
optimization at this point, and, in some cases, the final PFD is not complete until those tools and
processes have been utilized.
2.3 Equipment List
Although the equipment has not been fully designed at this point, the nature and size of the vessels
and major auxiliary equipment may be approximately determined. Assembling the equipment
list and applying well-known cost factors allow an initial estimate of capital cost. This is an early
step in the ongoing communication among the project team and the sponsor. Toghraei (2014A)
acknowledged that equipment is designed with margins, but these margins must be thought
through and managed.
2.4 Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID)
The P&ID is actually more recognized among project managers and engineersthan the PFD. Thisis
because, when fully completed, it shows essentially every piece of equipment in the system includ￾ing pipe sizes, reducers, expanders, valves, strainers, sample points, points of measurement, and
points of control action along with all of the main vesselsin the form ofsimple blocks. Like the PFD,
the P&ID is a living document. It begins with the process engineer adding essential controls, and,
eventually, the diameters, wall thickness, length, and code of every pipe are included. In a large
corporation, the piping would be handled by a piping specialist. In a smaller operation, it may be
handled by the process designer. This is the diagram to which the operators and maintenance per￾sonnel refer. In many cases, the P&ID is taped to the wall in the control room for ready reference.
For a P&ID on multiple sheets, it is highly convenient to match up the outflows from one P&ID to
the inflows of the subsequent P&ID (Figure 2.3).
At some point, the process designer must specify the process monitoring and control equipment
and add these detailsinto the P&ID. Essentially, this means, for monitoring, points of measurement
of temperature, pressure, level, flow, and possibly concentration. It also includessample points. For
control, some of these points of measurement are included as parts of feedback loops that activate
final control elementssuch as valve position, pump speed, and energy flow to heat-transfer devices.
The designation of these loops forms part of the P&ID. As part of the initial calculation of cost,
there is usually an average cost-per-loop which can be used for initial estimates. Rinker (2017)
provided a valuable compendium of symbols for piping and instrumentation and also for valves.

Of course, an enterprise often has its own symbols, which should be used. Shah (2020A, 2020B)
spoke about P&IDs. Toghraei (2014B) provided principles of P&ID development.
A PFD with controls is the first step in the transition from PFD to P&ID. Some aspects of P&IDs
are illustrated in Figure 2.4 for the reactor-with-recycle example for which the PFD is shown in
Figure 2.1. Starting in the lower right-hand corner, it is seen that the product is desired to be
delivered at a constant rate, with the flow indicator and controller (FIC) measuring the flow, com￾paring it with the set point, and manipulating the pump to deliver the desired product rate. Heat is
provided at the bottom of the distillation/separation column, and the heating rate is manipulated
to maintain the desired bottom temperature – that temperature indicates the composition of the
bottom product. This is the function of the temperature indicator and controller (TIC). The bottom
liquid level is also measured (level indicating controller (LIC)) and is controlled by manipulating
the flow from the reactor into the column.
If some upstream malfunction were to cause the liquid level at the bottom of the column to fall
below its set point and possibly to zero, the outlet pump would run dry, with damaging effects to
itself. For this reason, the level control measurement connects to an interlock (“I”), which shuts
off the pump regardless of the signal from the FIC (which would have speeded up the pump if it
detected reduced flow).
The purge of component “C” near the top of the column is a small vapor stream which gets par￾tially condensed with the liquid running off to waste. The level in the separation tank is controlled
by manipulating the outlet valve.
The recycle line contains vapor from the purge separator which is condensed and fed to the reac￾tor. An analytical detector (Analyzer Indicator (AI)) for component “C” could be installed in the
recycle line since it is desired to keep the impurity from building up in the system. This detection
could consist of just a sample point, where occasional samples are taken and transmitted to an
online analyzer or to the lab for analysis. The fresh feed to the reactor is manipulated in order to
control level. The temperature is maintained by external heating. The reader is invited to consider
what equipment or controls would be needed to provide liquid reflux for the column, and what
would be required to handle an impurity with a lower volatility than component A.
Usually, there are more than one P&ID. The very practical custom is to make the piping on one
drawing line up with the same piping on the next drawing. The P&IDs are often posted,side by side
around the walls of the control room.12 2 Documentation and Communication
2.5 Equipment Data Sheets
The process designer begins the specification of the equipment which is going to be used to carry
out the process. Referring to the example in Figure 2.1, the major items will include (i) the size and
internals of the reactor, (ii) the dimensions and tray schedule of the distillation column, (iii) the
dimensions and cooling requirements of the “C” separator, (iv) the duty and type of the heat
exchanger for condensing the recycle flow, and (v) the characteristics of the two pumps. Other
specialists may examine the vessels and auxiliaries and decide on changes. Mechanical specialists
will pronounce on the wall thicknesses and the material of construction, and the company that
supplies the distillation column will likely make some changes. One of the key considerations
is the actual size of the two main vessels. Because it is a split process, the duty could be varied
between the two vessels within certain limits. Hence, if the shop in which, say, the reactor is
being built has space only up to a given dimension, then there is no use specifying a reactor that
will exceed that space. It can be made somewhat smaller and a greater load shifted over to the
distillation column. If, as part of this project, a mathematical model has been built, then it could
be used to optimize the whole process, relative to temperature, pressure, and reactor-column split.
At this stage, it is appropriate to revisit the PFD and modify it in accordance with the performance
of the actual equipment. As stated previously, the PFD, the P&ID, and the equipment data sheets
are “living documents”. Shelley (2008) advised how to streamline data sheets. Toghraei (2013A)
stressed data sheets as the key document.
Ultimately, the equipment data sheets have been so augmented and put into the final compre￾hensive form that a vendor or manufacturer can quote a price.
2.6 Monitoring and Control Data Sheets
The process designer will have added the process monitoring and control equipment into the P&ID.
Most ofthe control loops are SISO – single inputsingle output. Some controlschemes are more com￾plicated. Every controlled variable and every manipulated variable has an expected range. Values
outside this range must trigger a visual and/or audio indication and, at excessive deviation, an
interlock on some process variable – typically a pump or valve. The PMC data sheets capture all of
these details.
2.7 Functional Specification for Distributed Control System (DCS)
In large plants, the monitoring and control are generally part of a much larger entity called a DCS.
The process designer has a significantresponsibility for writing specificationsto communicate with
vendors of DCSs. These systems not only handle the final control loops in the process but also
provide internal calculations, graphic displays, historians, and recipe handling. The details of the
functional specification are the shared responsibility of the designer and manufacturing. This is a
task of considerable effort. As early as possible, the vendor needs to provide a quote. Deitz et al.
(2003) offered help in this area.
2.8 Scope of Work
This document is the culmination of the foregoing efforts. Although not all of the above work has
been done, there is enough for an estimate of the time, effort, and money to bring the plant or2.12 Maintenance Instructions 13
process to physical completion. The process designer is expected to contribute, but usually engi￾neering planners and estimators take the lead. Management expects the cost to be estimated to
within some limit – even as small as 10%. Maas (2005) described a very full content of the scope
of work. Uppal (2002) urged as much upstream work to have been done as possible, in order for
a scope of work to yield an accurate capital cost. Planners and estimators will object if they per￾ceive uncertainty in the specifications of the process designer. Their reputation depends on how
well their report agrees with eventual reality. Rosentrator (2001) divided the scope of work into
“preliminary” and “final”, which gives some space for reconciliation.
2.9 Notes from Process Hazard Reviews
As the design becomes more fixed, and particularly as the PFD and P&ID become more complete
and comprehensive, a review team is set up to seek out possible malfunctions and safety hazards.
The team meetsfor a few hours, possibly more than once, and notes are taken. The process designer
will obviously be part of this team and may likely be the notetaker. He or she then has to follow
up on the team recommendations: either to satisfy that some point that was raised is not in fact
a hazard or that a point requires action because it was overlooked in the design so far. All of this
needs to be documented and followed up on, for the following reasons:
● so that no one gets hurt,
● so that the plant does not malfunction, and
● so that there is evidence of due diligence if something untoward still occurs.
2.10 Input to Applications for Environmental Approval
All plants create some change to the surrounding land, water, and air. Governments have strictrules
on the form and extent of these disturbances. In the initial design, these restrictions will have been
honored. However, whatever emissionsstillremain must be approved by the regulatory authorities.
Quantitative data must accompany applications, and the process designer is in the best position to
provide this information. Deakins (2010) provided advice on generating regulatory documents.
2.11 Operating Instructions
Providing detailed instructions for starting up, operating, and shutting down the plant is a major
task. A great deal of thought is required because there may be more than one possible procedure
in some cases. Usually, more than one person handles the task because there is often debate. This
document is often conjoined with the process hazard review. By thistime, the elements(instrument
numbers, equipment numbers, and pipe or ‘line’ numbers) in the P&ID need to have numbers
assigned to them, in order to tie in with the instructions. At some point, there should be training
sessions for the operators and first-line supervision. Gentilcore (2001) assisted here.
2.12 Maintenance Instructions
Long-term viability requires inspection and repairs over time. The process designer can help by, at
least, advising on setting up a maintenance program to anticipate and ward off process and equip￾ment problems.14 2 Documentation and Communication
2.13 Record of Design Calculations
At some time in the future, the plant will likely be required to increase production or move to an
altered product. The original process designer may still be available to lead or assist the changes, but
more likely this will not be the case. Then, it will be important for his or hersuccessorto understand
how the existing plant was conceived. Design calculations done by hand should be scanned into
the computer, and any mathematical model input and output should be preserved – along with the
model itself. These records show the existing constraints and show where selected changes to the
equipment or flow path can bring about the desired upgrades. The extent and quality of the records
depend, of course, on the conscientious of the original process designer or design team, on the will￾ingness of management to devote time for this post-project step, and on the records-management
system in use.
One other communication isthe Cost Sheet, which sums up the cost per unit mass of the product,
including entries for labor, supervision, materials, energy, and depreciation. This document is the
summation of the total plant design and of its fairly close cost estimates, and it indicates what
the product will have to sell for in order to make a profit. The process designer will have started the
progress toward this ultimate document. This document is described in Chapter 9, Economics.
2.14 People Communications
Every project in which an engineer or other designer engages produces an impression in the mind of
management. It may be a feeling of a job well done or it may be a feeling of incompetence. Futures

Introduction to Synthesis
Synthesis, as defined in the dictionary, is a combination of ideas to form a system. For a chemical
engineering process designer, that system is the process and those ideas are the thinking which is
put into the design.
The process can have a range ofscales. At maximum, it may be for a totally new product of which
there is no precedent for its manufacture. At minimum, it may be a minor improvement in part of
an existing facility. In all cases, the design of the process is a synthesis.
The idea of carrying out a synthesis in a systematic manner has been pursued by many work￾ers with the objective of putting synthesis onto the same step-by-step basis as the design of unit
operations or standard chemical reactors. These efforts have been very fruitful in the area of heat
integration, but, in general, they are successful only for design problemsthat are much better posed
or defined than is commonly the case in practice. If processsynthesis could truly be done in a direct
linear fashion, then there would not be the many patents that are taken out every year on “novel”
chemical processes. Process synthesis is more akin to the work of an artist who, while drawing on
common principles of technique and using tools that are available to all, uses his or her experience
and inner imagination to create an original work. The objective of the present chapter is to present
to the “artist” who creates processes, some insights that augment experience and fire imagination.
A caution to the designer with an oversupply of “artistic” ambitions: There are often existing
examples of successful designs for facilities somewhat similar to the present objective. They may
be found within the company or in the literature, especially in patents. There may also be licensing
opportunities. The designer will be criticized for failing to make a survey before launching into
his or her creative phase. There will still be opportunity within the design for ingenuity and the
choosing of options.
The present book, and especially Part II, Chapters 10–20, is about synthesis. Each of these
chapters takes up a specific task in chemical processes. The 11 chapters are structured to provide
options for meeting the physical and chemical requirements that arise as the designer puts
together the concept for the process. For instance, at some point in the process, it may be necessary
to separate the components of a fluid in which the components are intermingled at the molecular
level: Chapter 17, Molecular Separations, describes possible methods including, hopefully,
the method most appropriate for the particular fluid and components.
In this chapter, a higher-level, more general examination is made of the synthesistask. Thisintro￾duction to synthesis generalizes about process configurations, e.g., batch and continuous, plug flow
and mixed flow, and countercurrent and cocurrent – all of which are central to the way in which
chemical engineers set up material transfer and material transformation.

3.1 Economic Basis of Synthesis
The goal of a process is usually but not necessarily to make money for a company: Sometimes it is a
public work like a waste-treatmentsystem. However, if the objective of the design is, asit usually is,
to maximize profit for the company, then it turns on the twin desires to minimize capital cost and
operating cost per unit of production. Using standard methods of accounting, these two costs are
brought into a single quantity (i.e. a single “objective function”)such as net present value,return on
investment, or cost of manufacture. In the latter case, the capital cost is converted to a component
of the operating cost by assigning a portion of it (e.g. 10%) as an annual depreciation or write-off.
Then, it can be combined with and compared with the other operating costs, which are mainly
● raw materials,
● energy and other services,
● human resources,
● maintenance, and
● waste disposal,
in order to arrive at the total cost of manufacture. With this scheme in place, quantitative judg￾ments can be made on such trade-offs or choices as
● adding equipment (capital cost) to capture process heat and reduce energy consumption (oper￾ating cost),
● using energy to power purification columns that increase yield from raw materials – i.e., increas￾ing one operating cost to reduce another capital or operating cost,
● automating to reduce the number of operating personnel, and
● increasing the vessel size and hold-up time to allow a decrease in the reactor temperature that
lessens waste production, or to reduce operating cost in a separation and recycle system.
Implicit in these considerations is that the facility will operate at a high percentage of the time,
typically at more than 8000 hours out of the annual 8766. If there is significant “down time”, then
the plant will not return the expected profit. Since many costs such as depreciation, heating and
ventilating, and operating salaries are at least partially independent of the production rate, the
cost of manufacture per unit of product goes up. To help ensure that the process will stay largely
“on stream”, the process designer needs to champion the following inclusions:
1. adequate process monitoring and sampling, for early detection and diagnosis of problems,
2. storage capacity for raw materials, product, and intermediate streams, in order to buy time and
keep the plant operating if there is a difficulty at one point,
3. redundancy of ancillary equipment such as pumps, and
4. ability to handle a range of throughputs, below and above the flow sheet values.
The boundaries that are set around the synthesis assignment are typically
● required production rate,
● required product quality,
● unit cost for raw materials and for services,
● raw material characteristics, and
● environmental regulations.
The process designer has little or no control over these parameters but should be aware that
some of them may change in the future. Most commonly, if the process and product are successful,3.2 The Rate Concept 19

then the business may begin requesting higher rates of production. It would be unfortunate if the
plant immediately had to have an expensive replacement of equipment because everything had
been designed at its very limit. Pumps and piping can usually be considerably oversized, and oper￾ating vessels can be sized so that the initial throughput falls in the middle of their operating range.
The extra money which these provisions cost is quantifiable, and the extra expenditure should be
strongly proposed to the project team and to business management.
Figure 3.1 shows the cost-bearing and revenue-making streams in a chemical operation.
3.2 The Rate Concept
It can be said that the motivation for process synthesis is “all about money”, and it can
equally well be said that the execution of process synthesis is “all about rates”. Taking first a
“macroscopic” view of the process, it is seen from Figure 3.1 that there are good rates and
bad rates: Good are the rates of production of product and useful coproducts; bad are all the
other rates, which are associated with costs. The goal is to maximize the good and mini￾mize the bad in such a way as to maximize the return on investment or minimize the cost of
manufacture.
Achieving this happy state requires a “microscopic” view of the process, coming to grips with all
the interiorrates. Forthe most part, they are the chemical engineering rates of momentum transfer,
heat transfer, mass transfer, chemical reaction, and biological transformation. There are others:
rates of corrosion, rate of supplier delivery, fluctuating rate of sales, etc., which will be examined
in other chapters. The present discussion focuses on the three transfer phenomena (momentum,
heat, and mass) and on chemical reactions. For all of these happenings, a very general but very
instructive equation can be written:
Rate = Rate coefficient × zone of action × driving force (3.1)20 3 Introduction to Synthesis
In the case of convective heat transfer, for instance, Eq. (3.1) becomes
Rate of heat transfer = Heat transfer coefficient × area normal to the flow of heat
× temperature difference (3.2)
Equation (3.1) has two key characteristics:
(1) If any one of the three terms on the right side is increased, the whole rate is increased propor￾tionately, and
(2) if any one of the three terms goes to zero, the rate goes to zero.
Thus, the process designer is presented with both an opportunity and a warning.
We desire to increase the rates of favorable phenomena, e.g., chemical production of useful
product, necessary heating and cooling of streams, and necessary separation of compo￾nents. We try to suppress the rates of unfavorable phenomena, e.g., chemical production of
unwanted products, heat loss to atmosphere, evaporation of components, and frictional loss
in piping. Collectively, all these interior rates determine the exterior cash-carrying rates of
Figure 3.1. The discussions of this chapter are aimed at how the chemical engineer can manip￾ulate the interior rates in order to bring about the desired exterior rates that the business is
interested in.
In many cases, an overall outcome depends on the occurrence of two sub events, each with its
own rate constant and its own zone of action. An example is the conduction of heat through a
composite sheet of two layers of unlike materials. Each layer has its own thermal conductivity, its
own thickness, and its own area normal to the flow of heat. An overall driving force exists acrossthe
sheet, but it is quite possible that one layer imposes a significantly greater resistance to the flow of
heat than doesthe other and, as a consequence, uses up a greatershare of the driving force.In terms
of Eq. (3.1), that layer has a lesser value of the product “Rate Constant × Zone of Action”, a quantity
which we may call the Rate Product. In this simple case, the relative resistances of the two layers
are easily calculated, but in many other cases of this common resistances-in-series situation, the
relative resistances are not so obvious. If the designer is to improve an overall rate, then he or she
must make a judgement on which individual resistance requires attention. The following are four
examples:
1. Heating of pellets with a hot gas: Two heat transfers are going on simultaneously: from gas to
the pellet surface and from the pellet surface to pellet interior. If the former has the smaller rate
product (Case 1 in Figure 3.2), then it may be advantageous to improve that heat transfer coef￾ficient by operating as a fluidized bed with lots of gas–particle surface agitation and turbulence.
If the latter has the smaller rate product (Case 2), then consideration should be given to making
the pellets smaller.
2. Drying of pellets with a hot gas: Two mass transfers are going on simultaneously: moisture
diffusion within the pellets and moisture vaporization from pellet surface into the hot gas.
If the former has the smaller rate product, then it would be beneficial to make the pellets
smaller. If the latter has the smaller rate product, then fluidize the bed of particles.
In a particular case where these questions arose, it was calculated that, for heat transfer, the
external rate was limiting, but for mass transfer, the internal rate was limiting. By making these
quantitative determinations, it was possible to take the appropriate steps, leading to the desired
improvement in overall rates.
3. Chemical reaction and heat transfer in a batch polymerization: A condensation polymerization
is being carried on in a boiling reactor with concurrent boiling out of a reaction by-product as3.2 The Rate Concept 21

a vapor. If not continuously removed, the by-product causes reverse reaction. It is desired to
reduce batch time, but it is not known whether the rate of chemical reaction or the rate of heat
transfer is determining the overall speed of the process. If the former, then a catalyst should
be sought. If the latter, then an extra heat transfer surface should be added. Both routes will be
expensive and a hunch-based approach may give the wrong route. Some possible aidsin making
the determination:
• an experiment in which extra – electrical – heat is supplied,
• lab measurement of the polymerization kinetics, and
• engineering calculations.
In this particular case, the rate of heat transfer turned out to be limiting, which led to an
increase in the production rate by installing more heat transfer surface.
4. Chemical reaction in a sparged reactor: A reactant “C” is sometimes introduced as a vapor into
a liquid-phase reaction mixture. This “sparged” reactant must
(a) first be absorbed into the liquid and then
(b) enter into the reaction.
Both actions depend on the dissolved concentration of “C”:
The rate of absorption is at least approximately proportional to the difference between [C]vle
the liquid-phase concentration that would be in equilibrium with the concentration in the
vapor and [C]the actual dissolved concentration; the reaction rate dependsin a positive way
on the dissolved concentration.
At steady state, the two actions – absorption and reaction – must take place at the same rate,
but if one has a significantly lower rate product than the other, then there is potential for improv￾ing it to increase the overall rate. Figure 3.3 shows three cases: (i) The absorption rate limits the
process – more agitation would help, (ii) the chemical reaction rate limits the process – a catalyst
would help, and (iii) both actions are significant and either could be profitably improved to make
a limited increase in the overall rate.
These examples are given to show the importance of applying chemical engineering know-how
in order to determine where to concentrate effort. The literature is replete with correlations for
making most of these predictions. Sometimes a targeted experiment must be done to isolate and
measure a rate. Chapter 4 presents some predictive methods and also discusses the use of pilot
plants for obtaining key data.
Returning to the general concept of rates and looking again at Eq. (3.1), it is logical to examine
separately the three independent factors – rate coefficient, zone of action, and driving force – and22 3 Introduction to Synthesis

to explore ways in which to increase each. It turns out that the creation and maintenance of
driving force largely dictate the arrangement of chemical processes, and, therefore, this factor
is studied first.
3.3 Achieving Driving Force: Some Patterns in Single-Stream
Processes
The observer of chemical processes soon notes that there are certain standard configurations that
occur regularly. For single-stream processes, they are
● batch and continuous
● plug and back-mixed
● multistage back-mixed, the stages being similar or stages being dissimilar, and
● separation and recycle.
These configurations are now examined for their influence on driving force and ultimately on
process efficiency and economics. The general objective is to maximize driving force in order to
minimize equipment size and capital cost.
Single-stream systems are those in which changes in a mass or stream of process material,
although affected by other systems, can be considered independently of its own effect on those
other systems. An example is the flow of fluid through a pipe: The frictional pressure drop caused
by the force of the pipe wall on the fluid is calculated without reference to the fact that the fluid
is also exerting a force on the pipe (a fact that the pipe designer must recognize in specifying
the piping supports). Another example is heat transfer to the same fluid from a fixed-pressure
condensing medium (e.g. steam): The rise in fluid temperature is calculated without reference
to the fact that steam must be continuously supplied in order to maintain its pressure. Another
example is the chemical reaction in a vessel or pipeline where all reactants begin together and
flow concurrently.
Consider first the Batch – Continuous option. Many processes begin life as batch operations
because batch isthe way they were developed in the laboratory and batch is considered the simplest
route to commercialization. By batch, it is meant that discrete quantities of raw material are fed to
the system at some times and not at others and that discrete quantities of product are issued from
the system at some times and not at others. A batch operation may comprise more than one vessel3.3 Achieving Driving Force: Some Patterns in Single-Stream Processes 23
in series, with an upstream vessel discharging intermediate material from time to time to the next
vessel. Batch versus continuous is a comparison that is often made in a general manner, with many
good arguments on both sides, but for a specific process, the choice is sometimes obvious. Some
advantages of batch processing are as follows:
● It is generally simpler, with less vessels.
● Process development tends to be done by changing operating conditions rather than the design
of vessels.
● There is relatively easy transition between successive product types.
● Incremental expansion can be low cost: just add duplicate vessels.
● For some biological processes, batch is the only option due to the nature of the organisms
being used.
The disadvantages of batch processing are usually stated to be greater human resources to
operate, greater batch-to-batch product nonuniformity, and more challenging to recover and reuse
energy. The first two conditions are being alleviated because
● modern-day systems of distributed control incorporate recipe handling and automated addition
of raw materials and additives, which relieve many operator functions;
● advanced control schemes, particularly model-based control, can track batches and keep them
all to an identical process path and/or detect any that stray and require segregation.
In the common view, batch operation is usually seen as less “advanced” than continuous, so
that there is a progression from batch to continuous processing. In this case, the batch experience
provides valuable information for the design of the continuous process. Itshould also be noted that
there are hybrids, with
● a continuous process that has batch operation somewhere along its length, usually for raw mate￾rial introduction or for product handling;
● a batch process that has a continuous feed of some component during all or part of its course.
Continuous processes normally operate at steady state, where conditions vary along the path but
are constant at any point. They also operate at unsteady state during start-up,shut-down, transition
periods, and unusual incidents: They are designed to handle all of these modes. One possible con￾figuration of a continuous system is plug flow, where the process stream follows a path of “first in,
first out”. Typically, this condition is approximated in a pipeline with internal fittings that prevent
or minimize axial mixing but that promote good lateral mixing. Plug flow makes the best use of
vessel volume, as will be examined shortly. Plug flow and a well-mixed batch system are analogous
because the batch can be considered to be “plug flow” with respect to time. In practice, perfect plug
flow is difficult to achieve because of wall resistance to flow and because of turbulence.
The other extreme of continuous processing is the fully back-mixed vessel. The contents of the
vessel are deliberately made as uniform as possible, and the material leaving the vessel has the
same properties as the material within. As will be seen, this type of operation makes less efficient
use of vessel volume and is therefore, at first examination, more expensive. However, it has the
following two advantages:
● It is easier to achieve than plug flow.
● It is uniform and avoids local regions of adverse conditions such as hot spots.
A hybrid between plug flow and fully back-mixed flow isthe multistage back-mixed configuration
in which the fluid flows continuously from one fully back-mixed stage to the next.24 3 Introduction to Synthesis

configurations.
Figure 3.4 shows these three flow configurations.
The relative efficacies of these vessel types can be assessed by considering them as reactors
for a first-order reaction in which an entering component “C” is consumed according to the
equation,
Rate of consumption = k × liquid mass × [C] (3.3)
The extent of reaction is defined as
Extent = ([C]no reaction−[C])∕[C]no reaction (3.4)
It can be shown that, starting with extent of zero and finishing with extent equal to Extfinal:
● For plug flow,
Required hold-up time = HUT = (1∕k) × ln [1∕(1−Extfinal)] (3.5)
● For a single-stage fully back mixed vessel,
Required HUT = (1∕k) × Extfinal∕(1−Extfinal) (3.6)
● For a series of m equal-hold-up-time back-mixed stages,
Required overall hold-up time = HUT = (m∕k) × {[Extfinal∕(1−Extfinal)]∧(1∕m) − 1}
(3.7)
Table 3.1 shows the required hold-up times for various final extents of reaction in comparison
with a plug-flow reactor at a final extent of 0.99.
Table 3.1 Relative sizes of various reactor types.

10-stage reactor 0.02 0.05 0.16 0.56 1.273.3 Achieving Driving Force: Some Patterns in Single-Stream Processes 25
The following observations are clear:
(1) Required hold-up time falls off greatly as the final extent of reaction drops.
(2) All configurations behave about the same at extents up to 0.5.
(3) At high (0.99) extent, the single well-mixed reactor requires very large hold-up time.
(4) A sequence of well-mixed stagesis much more efficient than one stage and, with enough stages,
can even approach the performance of plug flow.
These results all show the effect of driving forces and are most readily understood in terms of
the concentration [C], which is the driving force for the reaction. Take [C]no reaction as 100. In plug
flow (or in a batch reactor), the concentration of the reactant is high (100) at the beginning and
produces a rapid reaction. The concentration of reactant is everywhere as high as it can be, subject
to the fact that it has been reduced by the reaction that has taken place up to that point. O the
other hand, in a continuous fully back-mixed stage, the concentration is everywhere equal to its
final (low) value, which limits the rate everywhere: At Extfinal of 0.99, [C] is 1. In the compromise
case, e.g., the two-stage system, if the stages are of equal size and if the second stage is producing
a stream of 0.99 extent of reaction, then it is calculated that the first stage contains and produces
0.90 extent of reaction, i.e., from Eq. (3.4), its concentration [C] is 10. Thus, the first stage, with
[C] of 10, achieves 90% of the reaction and the second stage, with [C] of 1, achieves 9%. Between
them, they cut the overall required residence time to less than a quarter of the single-stage time.
The benefit of multistaging is obvious and is greatly taken advantage of in chemical process design.
Some typical configurations are shown in Figure 3.5.
In these examples, it is implied that the stages are similar. Sometimes it is advantageous to adopt
what could be called a Vari-Stage approach in which the successive stages are customized for the
nature of the reaction mass and forthe task to be handled. Forinstance, in a polymerization process,
the initial reaction mass may be of low viscosity, while the final mass may have a viscosity that

is greater by many orders of magnitude. The early stages may require no mechanical agitation,
while the later stages must be heavily stirred. A classic example of vari-staging is the paper-making
machine, where paper is produced starting with a slurry of wood pulp. The process is illustrated in
Figure 3.6.
Vari-staging has its counterpart in batch processing where a sequence is used of two or more
vessels of different types, each appropriately designed for its part of the process.
In another configuration for single-stream processing, use is made of Separation and Recycle.
In the case of chemical reaction, the inspection of Table 3.1 shows that the reactor volume for
low final extent of reaction is very much smaller than for high (e.g. 0.99) final extent. An option,
then, is to take the reaction to only a low extent, accept the fact that the outlet stream contains a
large amount of unreacted reactant, separate this unreacted material, and return it to the reactor.
This separation is typically (but not necessarily) done by distillation. The other stream from the
separation is rich in the desired product and proceeds to final processing. Figure 3.7 shows the
principle.
The advantage here is the smaller reactor size. The disadvantages are the capital cost and the
energy requirement of the separation device and also the possibility of the time-wise buildup in the
recycle stream of unwanted reaction by-products. If saving of the reactor size is the only benefit,
then separation-and-recycle may not be a good choice. However, including this case, there are four
situations where the approach should be considered:
1. The process must be taken to a high final extent of reaction, either for reasons of product purity
or because of high cost of the raw material.
2. There is a significant reverse reaction which slows the process and limits the achievable extent.
3. The product is susceptible to a further undesired reaction if it remains at reactor conditions.
4. The product has a poisoning effect on a catalyst.
The latter three conditions may make separation-and-recycle mandatory.
This technique has some applications other than in chemical reaction. Figure 3.8 illustrates the
comminution ofsolids – e.g., in rock crushing – the product from the crusher may move to a screen

(the separation device), where the acceptably small pieces pass through and the oversize pieces
return to the crusher.
In using a centrifugal pump to generate a specified flow, the pump may be set up to pump a
flow greater than desired and the excess is split off and returned to the supply tank. In feeding a
settleable slurry to an intermittent user, a “ring” feed pipe may be used, with continuous recycle to
the source and withdrawal at the user as needed.
3.4 Achieving Driving Force: Some Patterns in Two-Stream
Processes
Two-stream processes are defined as those in which it is necessary to consider the interaction
between two process streams or, in the case of a batch process, between two masses of material.
There are processes where the interaction among more than two streams must be considered, but,
for the present discussion, two streams will be enough to deal with.
It will be recalled that, for single-stream systems, the purpose of maximizing the driving force is
to minimize the equipment size and capital cost. This objective also applies to two-stream systems
and a second objective now comes into play: to minimize such operating costs as
● Generating utility streams: a utility stream could be a liquid (e.g. a hot oil) used for supplying
heat to the process. Designing to efficiently maintain driving force (temperature difference)
allows both the flow of oil and also the temperature at which it must be generated to be
minimized.
● Recovering secondary process streams: a secondary stream could be a gas used to strip a compo￾nent from a liquid. Efficiently maintaining driving force (concentration difference) allows less
of the gas to be used and minimizes the effort required to subsequently separate the component
from the gas.
● Treating waste streams: a waste stream could be a discardable flushing liquid. Efficient usage
minimizes the amount required and the amount sent to waste treatment.
Many standard operations of chemical engineering involve two interacting streams. Examples
are as follows:
● two-liquid heat exchangers, where the temperature of each liquid affects and is affected by the
temperature of the other,
● gas absorbers, where the composition of gas and of absorbing liquid are interrelated,
● liquid strippers, where the composition of liquid and of the stripping gas are interrelated,
● liquid–liquid extractors, where the compositions of the two liquid streams interact,28 3 Introduction to Synthesis
● pneumatic conveying, where momentum is continuously exchanged between particles and con￾veying gas, and
● drying, where the concentration of vapor in a gas stream is determined by and helps determine
the rate of transfer from the material being dried.
Some of these processes are shown schematically in Figures 3.9 and 3.10.
As with single-stream operations, those with two streams display some commonly recurring
patterns:
● batch and continuous,
● plug and back-mixed, and
● multistage back-mixed.
Additionally, two-stream operations are distinguished as
● cocurrent, crosscurrent, and countercurrent.
This new distinction is illustrated, for a continuous process, by the following example of drying,
as shown in Figure 3.11.
In this operation, hot air is being passed over the surface of a moving bed of particles with the
objective of heating them and extracting moisture from them. The air can be oriented to move in the
same direction as the particles, at right angles, or in the opposite direction. The rate of transfer of

moisture is governed by the rate of heat transfer from air to solid, which is governed by the temper￾ature difference between air and solid. For a specific case, the distance-wise profiles of temperature
are shown in Figure 3.12. The following conditions applied:
● Ratio of (solid’s flow × specific heat) to (air flow × specific heat) was 0.7.
● Parameter (heat-transfer-coefficient × area/(solid’s flow × specific heat) was 2.
● Initial temperature of solids was 20 ∘C.
● Initial temperature of air was 200 ∘C.
Countercurrent operation isseen to be most efficient,raising the solidsto a temperature of 152 ∘C.
The cocurrent arrangement has the disadvantage that the air cools as the solid’s heat up, reducing
the driving force and making the final section of the dryer relatively ineffective. The solid’s reach a
temperature of only 122 ∘C. The cross-flow arrangement ensures that all parts of the dryer see the
full temperature of the hot air but is still not as effective as countercurrent, raising solid’s tempera￾ture to 139 ∘C. For eitherthe cocurrent orthe crosscurrent configuration to match the 152 ∘C solid’s
outlet temperature, either the flow rate of the hot air would have to be increased, entailing more
operating cost, or the supply temperature of the hot air would have to be increased, probably also
entailing more operating cost and, if the solids are temperature sensitive, possibly degrading them.
If the required increase in flow or temperature is made, then a calculation of entropy production in
each of the three configurations shows the lowest amount for countercurrent and the highest for
cocurrent. A general principle is thus illustrated of maximizing efficiency by minimizing entropy.
The three configurations of counter, cocurrent, and crosscurrent operation are found in batch
processing as well. Consider a vessel which accumulates a small amount D ofresidual fouled mate￾rial which must be flushed out from time to time with a solvent. Assume that whatever amount of
solvent is used it completely dissolves the undesired residue, but, upon draining, 5 kg of solution
remains behind. One procedure would be to charge a single amount – say 100 kg – of solvent, let
it dissolve the fouled material, and then drain it, i.e., 95 kg that comes out. Left behind would be
(5/100) or 5% of the original fouling. This procedure is shown in Figure 3.13.
More effective would be the crosscurrent approach, which is also shown in Figure 3.13. The sol￾vent is divided into two 50-kg aliquots. The first is used where it leaves behind (5/50) or 10% of the30 3 Introduction to Synthesis

the fouled material.
The third approach isthe countercurrent, asshown in Figure 3.14.It is also a two-pass procedure,
but the liquid from the second pass, which is relatively clean, is saved in a storage tank and is used
for the first pass the next time the vessel has to be cleaned.
The advantage of the countercurrent idea is that with only one charge of 50 kg of solvent, per
flush, almost the same cleaning can be attained as with two 50-kg chargesin crosscurrent operation.
About 1% of the fouled material is left after the second pass. A domestic example of the principle is
“suds saving” in a washing machine: The relatively clean rinse water from the second wash of one
load of wash issaved in a sink and then used asthe wash waterforthe first wash of the next load. The
example has focused on application to a single vessel: It becomes more attractive when applied to a
whole bank of vessels, where the intervals between cleaning are shorter. The suds-saving example
shows a case where the “process material” rather than a vessel is being treated.
3.5 Summary of Synthesis
Time constraints make it necessary for the process designer to focus on aspects with greatest pay￾back.In Figure 3.1, the cash-generating and the cash-consuming “streams” are shown. One or more
might be identified as having potential to be optimized to give a significant increase in the net cash
flow and a decrease in the unit product cost. These possibilities should be discussed by the project
team early in the design.
The rate equation, Eq. (3.1), provides the framework for process improvement. When more than
one action governs the rate, it is essential to focus on the one which is dominating.32 3 Introduction to Synthesis
A number of flow regimes may present themselves to the designer: batch and continuous,
plug flow and back-mixed flow, countercurrent and cocurrent, single-stage and multistage, and
single-mode and multi-mode. Some may not be appropriate to the situation but others may be
options.
Sometimes the configuration that has the theoretically highest rate, e.g., plug flow, gets super￾seded by a less-efficient configuration, e.g., mixed flow, simply because true plug flow is difficult
to achieve and therefore to characterize.33

Experimentation and Modeling in Support of Design
The goal of chemical engineering process design is to create a facility that will transform materials.
It begins with the designer’s concept, aided by the principles of Chapter 3, of the steps in making
that transformation. Unit operations and chemical reactors are chosen from Chapters 10–20. The
properties of the materials along the process path are accessed from the literature or measured.
The internals and the dimensions of the equipment are determined from chemical engineering
principles. A test facility, of greater or less similarity to the commercial end product, is built to
verify the design. These are the steps for which the present chapter provides guidance.
Some general recommendations can begin this guidance.
● For material properties, the task can comprise lab measurements, literature review, estimation
methods, and access to property data banks or to a commercial math model that includes a
property’s database. A principle to keep in mind is that an hour in the library can save a month
in the lab.
● If a chemical reaction is part of the design, then a separate set of experiments may be needed to
establish rate, order, and selectivity: These experiments may well be done batchwise even though
the ultimate design is for a continuous process.
● For design of the equipment, the task can start with knowledge from undergraduate studies, but
most engineerssafely resort to furtherstudy, advice from specialists, and recommendationsfrom
vendors. If a similar existing commercial unit exists, then useful data may be had, especially if
the unit is allowed to vary in its settings.
● The verification task generally requires some approximation of a pilot plant. A comprehensive
well-designed pilot plant is the gold standard for verification, but it does require time and
expense, some of which can sometimes be judicially circumvented.
The chapter containsthree parts. In the first part, a suggested three-pronged approach to making
and checking designs. The second part discusses pilot plants and the associated problem of scaling
up or down between units of small scale and commercial scale. The third part presents a very
simplified example of how a mathematical model can support the process design.
4.1 A Systematic Review of Process Design
The designer must not neglect any details of her or his design, but, of course, it is very easy to
miss something. Because every design is different, it is not possible in general to make specific
recommendations for given cases. However, with application of some sort of organization, it is

possible to split up the study and to lessen the omission of essential elements. The organization
that is proposed is the threefold division of chemical engineering science, namely
● momentum transfer,
● heat transfer, and
● mass transfer.
These three phenomena are the core of chemical engineering science, and so a good place to
start from.
Momentum is mass times velocity (units kg m s−1). The transfer of momentum is described by
choosing a quantity of material and setting the time-wise derivative of its momentum to the sum
of all the factors that would influence the momentum. This is the momentum balance,
dM
dt = ∑factors influencing momentum (4.1)
These factors are
● gravity,
● physical force (as in Newton’s second law) (i.e. pressure and viscous forces), and
● change of density because of phase change.
The quantity on which we are doing the balance does not have to be homogeneous. A mass is
static if all the forces balance out.
Momentum transfer is a consideration not only in chemical processes but in mechanical, civil,
aerospace, and other disciplines.
Momentum balances can be used to analyze the following fluid and phase flow situations:
● Pipe flow: Analyzing fluid flow through pipes is a common application. Momentum balances
can be used to predict pressure drops, flow rates, and velocities in different sections of a pipe
network.
● Reactors and mixers: In chemical reactors and mixers, momentum balances help optimize
mixing efficiency and avoid dead zones where fluid stagnation could lead to inefficiencies or
safety issues.
● Fluidized beds:In processesinvolving fluidized beds, momentum balances are used to determine
the minimum fluidization velocity and to understand particle behavior in fluidized systems.
● Distillation and separation: In distillation columns and separation units, momentum balances
are important for understanding fluid distribution and ensuring even vapor–liquid contact.
● Pump and fan sizing: Momentum balances can help in the determination of the required pump
or fan size to achieve a desired flow rate and pressure in a system.
● Environmental fluid dynamics: In environmental engineering, momentum balances play a role
in understanding natural fluid systems like rivers, lakes, and oceans, as well as the dispersion of
pollutants.
Heat, in the sense used here in “heat transfer”, is partially a misnomer and is in fact the internal
energy (U, joules) of the molecules, atoms, and partly of electrons of a chosen mass. It depends on
the thermal properties, the temperature, and the phase(s) of the mass. The transfer is expressed
by choosing a quantity of material and setting the time-wise derivative of its internal energy (or
“heat”) to the sum of all the factors that would influence the energy,
dU
dt = ∑factors influencing heat transfer (4.2)4.1 A Systematic Review of Process Design 35
These factors include the following:
● heat entering or leaving by conduction, convection, and radiation,
● work, and
● internal energy consumed by or created by chemical reaction.
Like momentum transfer, heat transfer considerations are shared with other disciplines besides
chemical.
Mass transfer is almost exclusively the domain of chemical engineering. The “mass” being
referred to is some defined portion of a single chemical component: more specifically all of that
component that resides in a particular single phase, by itself or in a molecular mixture with other
components. The time-wise derivative of the mass is set equal to the sum of the factors that would
augment or deplete it,
dM
dt = ∑factors influencing mass transfer (4.3)
These factors are as follows:
● transfer of the mass out of its phase, one molecule at a time, into another phase and
● chemical conversion of the mass into another substance.
Many chemical engineers have forgotten (or never realized) that their specialty revolves around
these three quantities and these equations. However, implicitly most of the chemical engineer’s
technical activities consist of identifying and quantifying the right-hand sides of these equations.
Consequently, this structure helps to sort out the issues which a particular design must address.
4.1.1 Momentum Transfer Considerations (see also Chapter 12)
Momentum transfer for chemical processes is concerned mainly with the flow of sub￾stances – gases, liquids, solids, and various mixtures of two or three members of these three
states of matter. One common assumption about liquids is that their rheology is Newtonian, that is,
thatshearstressislinear with the shearrate. See Figure 4.1. Thisisthe basisforthe usual equations
relating frictional pressure drop to flow and geometry. In support of the design, it is necessary
to check that this is true for all liquids that are part of the proposed process. Some “aberrant”
behaviors that might complicate the predictions of flow and pressure drop are when the liquid is:
● rheopectic, with its apparent viscosity (stress/strain) increasing with time of strain,
● thixotropic, where the apparent viscosity decreases with time under strain,

● a Bingham plastic, where a critical stress is needed to move the liquid at all,
● dilatant, where the apparent viscosity increases with shear rate, and
● pseudoplastic, where the apparent viscosity decreases with shear rate.
Identifying a liquid that has one of these behaviors will allow appropriate modificationsin piping
and other pressure-drop devices. Some advice from a rheologist or fluid flow specialist may be
necessary.
Another momentum-transfer problem is dealing with two-phase gas–liquid flow. There have
been many studies over the years attempting to relate (i) flow friction factor and (ii) in situ
composition to the flow and properties of the gas and liquid. One of the common and most quoted
is the graphical procedure of Lockhart and Martinelli (Chem. Eng. Prog., vol 45, p. 39–48, 1949),
which generally predicts pressure drop to within about 40%.
For horizontal flow, there are several types of flow – stratified, wave, annular, bubble or froth,
spray or dispersed, plug, and slug – which are displayed on a map devised by Baker (1954).
The axes of the plot are gas mass flow and the ratio of liquid flow to gas flow, each with some
multiplicative modification based on fluid properties. Much to be avoided is slug flow, which
causes masses of liquid at high velocity to be intermittently flung through piping and equipment,
with possible mechanical detriment. The Baker plot is shown in Chapter 5, along with a similar
plot (the Charles plot) for vertical flow.
Momentum transfer also takes place where one phase passes through another, either as immis￾cible droplets or as bubbles. Densities for liquid phases and the viscosity of a continuous liquid
need to be confirmed.
4.1.2 Heat (or Energy) Transfer Considerations (see also Chapter 14)
Transfer of heat is almost always a consideration because (i) mass-transfer operations such
as distillation require heat to power the generation of vapor and (ii) most chemical reactions
require elevated temperatures to proceed at acceptably high rates. At the same time, heat must be
extracted at some point in order to regain the liquid phase (if appropriate) and to get back to room
temperature. The tasks are to
● estimate the required heating and cooling rates,
● choose heating and cooling media that are able to deliver the rates, and
● estimate overall heat transfer coefficients to allow the calculation of required transfer areas.
The simplest and most common heat transfer media are steam for heating and water for cooling.
However, a process stage to be heated may be at too high a temperature for the usage of steam at
a safe pressure or at any pressure at all. Analogous to steam, there are condensable heat transfer
fluids which operate at significantly higher temperatures and at significantly lower pressures than
steam systems. Commercially, there are several such products, among them a eutectic mixture of
diphenyl and diphenyl oxide, e.g., Dowtherm ATM. Comparing thissubstance with steam (Table 4.1)
Water is the first thought for cooling, but if the temperature of the hot source is too high or too
low, again a commercial heat transfer liquid may be more appropriate.

Heat is lost from inter-vessel piping. It may be kept low enough by insulation, but other times an
expensive jacket of steam or hot oil is needed at critical points.
The scale-up of heat transfer requires preserving the ratio of heating rate to mass of material,
which becomes a challenge if a vessel is being heated though its walls. Internal heating coils or
external pump-around coils may be required for large vessels. Heat transfer can be a problem with
scale-up and will be discussed later at more length.
4.1.3 Mass Transfer Considerations (see also Chapters 17 and 20)
The transfer of mass takes on six variations:
1. gas/vapor phase+gas/vapor phase,
2. gas/vapor phase+liquid phase,
3. gas/vapor phase+solid phase,
4. liquid phase+liquid phase,
5. liquid phase+solid phase,
6. chemical reaction.
Here, we are including chemical reaction as an aspect of mass transfer inasmuch as it is one of
the actions that can augment or deplete a “mass”.
For interphase transfer, the key considerations are rate and equilibrium. For chemical reaction,
the following characteristics are required to be determined:
● reaction order,
● equilibrium between reactants,
● rate of reaction, and
● selectivity for desired product.
For a given process design, all of the following processes that are relevant have to be recognized
so that they can be studied and evaluated quantitatively. This activity may well carry over into the
mandate of a pilot plant (Figure 4.2).
Case 1 requires the two phases to be separated by a semipermeable barrier through which the
component understudy may pass but not the entire phase. Such barriers, in the form of membranes,
do exist forspecific cases. Membrane-separation methods constitute a specific and relatively recent
technology.
In case 2, if the gas is a permanent one which has a limited solubility in the liquid, Henry’s
law describes the equilibrium amount. Oxygen, for instance, has solubility in water at 25 ∘C and
atmospheric pressure of 40 ppm. Its Henry’s Law constant is approximately

For water in contact with air, the solubility is 0.2 × 40 or 8 ppm.
A component (i.e. the “mass” in which we are interested) in the gas may have a higher solubility
than the carrier gas. Bubbling of gas through the liquid is typically the way to bring about the
transfer of mass: stripping to remove component mass from the liquid and absorption to add it to
the liquid.
In case 2, if the gaseous phase is a condensable vapor, then multistage distillation can bring
about transfer of mass from one phase to the other. Vapor–liquid equilibrium data are needed
and particularly identification of azeotropes. There are many compilations of such data for binary
systems, e.g., Gmehling & Onken (2000). Predictive methods (e.g. UNIFAC/UNIQUAC) exist
based on the molecular structure of the components. For a particular combination of components,
it may be necessary to set up a lab-scale vapor–liquid measurement apparatus.
Case 3 is generally about transferring the gas or vapor (the “mass”) by absorption into or adsorp￾tion onto solid particles, or about stripping it out of solid particles.
Case 4 is liquid–liquid extraction, which brings two nonmiscible or slightly miscible liquids
into physical contact with each other. The component in question passes molecularly through
the interface between the liquids, the interface being made as large as possible generally through
agitation. The equilibrium is often measured by a simple process of shaking the liquids together
vigorously in a flask, then letting them settle, and withdrawing from the two phases for analysis.
Case 5 may be about absorption or stripping of the “mass” from solid particles. It may be the
dissolution of a solid into the liquid. It may be gradual accretion of the component of interest onto
existing solid particles, as in crystallization.
Case 6: Rarely does chemistry have a simple “feed substance → desired product”. Other products
are produced to a lesser or greater extent, some of them costly waste and some useful and saleable.
In many cases,some purification of the productstream is needed. Often the unwanted products are
produced from the further reaction of the desired products, thus necessitating early withdrawal
of the product stream, separation of the desired product, and recycle of the residue back to the
reactor. This is shown in Figure 2.1. If it turns out that not enough is known about the reaction,
then experiments may be necessary. One could follow the change in composition in a batch vessel
at various lengths of time at reaction temperature.
One way to interpret the data is to simulate, on a spreadsheet, the reaction process, assuming
guessed values for the reaction coefficients. Then, when data become available, adjust the coeffi￾cients to match the measured changes in composition. As an example, a simple first-order reaction
scheme is shown here,
Raw material A ⇄ desired product B (4.5)
B → by-product C (4.6)
The initial estimate k for the forward rate constant (reciprocal minute) is 0.015 for reaction 1;
equilibrium constant K is 200 for reaction 1; rate constant kc is 0.002 for reaction 2.
The results of the spreadsheet simulation are shown here (Table 4.2).
When the results of an experiment of 30 minutes or more become available, the three constants
k, K, and kc can be adjusted to provide a match, bringing them closer to their true values. This
procedure should be repeated for different times and, perhaps, for different compositions ofstarting
materialsin orderto yield confidence in the estimates of the constants. The example isfor first-order
kinetics only so, in practice, a fourth parameter – order of reaction(s) would have to be included.
However, once these constants are known with confidence, then they can be used in the chemical
calculations for any geometry – batch, well-mixed, plug flow, and recycle flow.4.2 Pilot Plants and Scale-up 39

The reaction scheme is the same as that used in the example of Figure 2.1. With the above set
of reaction constants, it is calculated that the reactor would require 0.95 m3 of working volume
(Example 2.1 conversion of 100 mol min−1 with a reactor residence time/conversion selected of
30 minutes).
The objective in thissection has been to alert the designer to some of the considerationsthat may
have to be addressed. Hopefully, many of the answers are in the literature or have been found in
comprehensive bench-scale studies. Information from bench-scale should be maximized, often by
negotiation with the chemists.
4.2 Pilot Plants and Scale-up
The degree of assurance that the process will function as intended rests with the owner of
the facility. Least prudent would be to go from bench-scale, through process design, and then
directly to commercial scale. In contrast with this minimalist approach, Figure 4.3 shows a
stepwise verification process, with the size and comprehensiveness of the second stage – the pilot
plant – undefined. In order to save money, it is often proposed to combine the second and third
steps. The combined mandate necessitates a larger plant than the imperatives of a pilot plant by
itself requires, but the imperatives of the pilot plant must still be observed. The present discussion
concerns only the pilot plant.
A pilot plant must verify the following five aspects of the process design:
● The stability, once the steady state is achieved, of all recycle streams and purge points so that
impurities do not build up with time.
● The absence or measurement of fouling, scaling, corrosion, and polymerized buildup with time.
● The conditionsrequired for adequate mixing in vessels which are intended to be fully back mixed.
● The strategy and characteristics of controller feedback loops.
● Start-up and shut-down procedures.
The pilot plant provides the opportunity to correct deficiencies in these and any other aspects.
Berg (2011) urged the review of piloting plans early and often using a peer group that is external
to the project team. They recommend any steps involving solids as important to be part of an inte￾grated pilot plant. Working with a contractor who has experience with pilot plants can speed up
the work and avoid mistakes.

To what extent should the equipment of the pilot plant mimic the eventual commercial plant?
If it is lumped in as part of a semiworks unit, then the resemblance will have to be more or less
complete. However, by itself as a pilot plant, it requires only those parts that satisfy the above five
aspects. Some other parts of the process may be handled by vendors in their labs.
4.2.1 Size and Cost of Pilot Plants
The cost of a pilot plant depends significantly on how big it is and how elaborate and comprehen￾sive. The cost, if grossly beyond expectation, may even cause the project to terminate. Hence, a
realistic estimate is called for and is a challenge to generate.
The first decision is always how big the pilot plant will be. Basically, it should be as small as
possible. There are several factors to consider.
1. Although the unit is not intended to make products for customer testing, it will generally be
tasked with producing small quantities for in-house evaluation. It should have a production
rate equal to the needs for these tests.
2. Are raw materials plentiful or scarce?
3. Are there any “break points” in the handling of raw materials and/or product? At what rate does
the handling require more labor or more or different equipment?
4. Are certain necessary pieces of small-scale equipment available?
5. For vertical columns, a rule of thumb is that an eight-inch internal diameter is the point below
which wall effects have a significant influence. Wall effects would complicate scale-up. Hence,
if a column is part of the process, then its size could dictate the scale of the whole pilot plant.
Estimating the cost of a pilot plant can be difficult because of the following:
1. The task may fall to the process designer, who does not have the costing skills of people working
with commercial plants.
2. There are few cost comparisons because pilot plants are not plentiful within a company and
details are not published by outside companies.
However, there are well-known types and methods used for estimating, at various accuracies,
full-scale plant costs. They are the best one can use for estimating the capital cost of pilot plants.
The well-known 0.6 power could also be applied:
Pilot plant estimated cost = (commercial plant estimated cost)
× (throughput of pilot plant∕throughput of commercial plant)
0.6
(4.7)
4.2.2 Equipment and Piping
The challenge is the small size of the facility. Two of the most common vessels are discussed here,
namely, liquid-phase chemical reactors and separation columns, as presented in the example of
Figure 2.1.
Many suppliers of laboratory equipment provide lab-scale jacketed batch reactors in the
25–250-liter size range, with temperature capability −60 to 200 ∘C. Glass reactors can take
pressures from full vacuum to 0.5 or 1.0 bar above atmospheric: If this range is acceptable, then
the visual capability allows the verification of flow patterns and makes possible the measurement
of the liquid level through optical techniques. For higher pressures, many of the same suppliers4.2 Pilot Plants and Scale-up 41
Figure 4.4 Continuous flow reactor vessel.

Raw material feed
Return from separator
provide vessels of stainless steel or other metals that can work at several hundred bar. Suppliers
provide not only the vesselsthemselves but also, with the customer, develop whole custom systems
to support the operation.
Although the vessels are advertised as “batch,” Figure 4.4 shows how they are easily converted
to continuous for the example from Figure 2.1.
For the scale-up or scale-down of columns with trays, there are two somewhat conflicting
considerations. One imperative is to match the mass transfer between columns of different sizes,
which means including the same number of stages. The other is to approximate the hydraulic
behavior: the tendency for the liquid phase to flood and the upward carry-up of liquid from tray
to tray. A large part of that matching is achieved by retaining the ratio of cross-sectional area
to column throughput. However, the inter-tray distance is also a factor and can only be kept
constant by making all columns the same height – not very practical for a pilot plant. Figure 4.5
shows a commercial column and a scaled-down pilot column. The cross section corresponds to
the throughput, but the height is made as high as practical to minimize the effect of inter-tray
distance. Another approach is to test the removal of one or two trays from the pilot column to
check if there is any effect on flooding and carryover. The Souders–Brown equation should be
applied to the geometry to further check on hydraulics. For packed columns, there is no inter-tray
Figure 4.5 Scaling of distillation column.42 4 Experimentation and Modeling in Support of Design
issue, so height consideration becomes moot. However, packing efficiency may still depend on the
column diameter, especially if it is less than 8 inches.
Pilot plants may use the multistage glass Oldershaw column, which is sold in various forms by
several vendors. However, the maximum available internal diameter is 100 mm or about 4 inches
(failing the 8-inch criterion for the absence of wall effects), so this device is more suitable for
bench-scale use. It is often used in vapor–liquid studies.
The first requirement of piping is that it must not leak. One sure way is to use welded piping
everywhere. However, pipe runs are never continuous, so piping must be joined at places by open￾able connections. These joints may be permanent, but others need to be openable unions. There is
a choice between tubing and standard threaded piping. It is generally recommended that, for pilot
plants, tubing and compressible fittings are preferred for resistance to leakage, for size ranges, and
for flexibility. Tubing and fittings are generally made of stainless steel but are available in other
materials needed to withstand corrosion.
In the valves of full-scale plants, the flow in valves is generally turbulent. This is the assumption
in the commonly used equation for liquid flow and/or pressure drop,
Cv = Q {
[SG∕(P1 − P2)]0.5} (4.8)
● where Cv Is the valve flow coefficient when fully open,
● Q is the volumetric flow of liquid in US gallons per minute,
● SG is the specific gravity of the fluid relative to water, and
● P1 and P2 are the inlet and outlet pressures in pounds per square inch.
Forsmall pilot plants, needle valves are almost exclusively used because of their ability to regulate
low rates of flow. The flow is generally laminar or in laminar-transition. Equation (4.8), which is
just a definition, holds, but the characteristic curve of pressure-drop versus flow for various valve
openings becomes more complicated. The valve vendorshould have an equation or a characteristic
curve since this is required for sizing the valve and for including it as a final control element in a
feedback loop. Whereas valvesin a full-scale plant often include variousrefinements, it may be best
to opt for simplicity for pilot plant valves.
4.2.3 Scale Considerations for Heat Transfer and for Flow Regime
The small vessels of a pilot plant have largersurface-to-volume ratiosthan the vessels of a full-scale
plant. For heat transfer, this is an advantage and a disadvantage. When a vessel requires heat, it
is easier to supply it from outside, i.e., from a jacket or by electrical heating. On the contrary, if
heat is supplied at only one point – for instance, at the bottom of a distillation column – then it is
easy for it to be lost from the rest of the vessel and completely disrupt the mass transfer function.
Minimizing the loss requires insulation and/or jacketing. Some small distillation columns (e.g.
Oldershaw) provide vacuum jacketing to impede heat loss.
The full-scale commercial vessels have lower surface-to-volume ratios and that too can be an
advantage and a disadvantage. Heat losses might be controlled by insulation only, whereas the
pilot plant required jacketing. However, if the vessel requires positive heat input, then heating
through the walls may need to be supplemented by heating from internal coils or by an external
heat exchanger through which contents of the vessel are continually passed. A poor solution is to
raise the temperature of the heat transfer medium: This causes local excessive temperature in the
process fluid next to the heating surface and potential degradation.
The designer plans for a given flow regime in a vessel, quite often fully back-mixed unless
internal baffling is provided to direct the flow. In a glass pilot vessel, full mixing is easily checked.4.3 Mathematical Modeling 43
Especially to be checked is that there are no dead or stagnant spots where degradation and/or
overheating could occur. If this issue is a real concern, then a CFD (computational fluid dynamics)
could be made, showing flow patterns for both pilot plant and full-scale vessels. An experimental
technique – process tomography – with electrodes inside the vessel provides a comprehensive
picture. Tracer tests for any vessel are also revealing: An extraneous substance is added to the
feed, and then samples are taken of the vessel output over time and analyzed for this tracer. The
time-wise pattern is indicative of the internal flow pattern within the vessel. Of course, this only
works for an existing vessel. If there are serious questions about the behavior of the full-scale
vessel, then a full-sized mock-up can be built and tested.
4.3 Mathematical Modeling
Mathematical modeling is a very valuable supplement to the physical design of any plant, including
a pilot plant. There is a widespread opinion that ordinary engineers no longer do math modeling but
rather resort to one or another of the commercial simulators. Also, unfortunately, general-purpose
languages are not alwaystaught in undergraduate programs. However, commercialsimulators have
licensing fees and, because they are general purpose, may not be a good fit to the problem at hand.
It is valuable to have a person on the design team who is able to construct models in a general
programming language, e.g., FORTRAN or C. As ideas arise, the model can be adjusted to sim￾ulate them, possibly saving a lot of time and allowing more ideas to be tested. The existence of
a well-documented math model is a great addition to the final report on the whole project. The
building of a model takes time, so it should be started as soon as the broad outline of the process is
known.
The power of math modeling may not be apparent to process designers. Many are aware of only
the steady-state “flow sheet” type of model. In the example of Figure 2.1, this is the model that
produced the flow rates in Figure 2.1.
The steady state equations, assuming chemical reactions are first-order, are presented for the
process presented in Figure 2.1.
Author’s note: A mass basis is used in this example rather than the more common molar basis.
A different situation may require a modified approach:
A1 + A3 − k M A2∕(A2 + B2 + C2)+(k∕K) M B2∕(A2 + B2 + C2) − A2 = 0 (4.9)
A2 − A3 − A4 − A5 = 0 (4.10)
k M A2∕(A2 + B2 + C2)−(k∕K) M B2∕(A2 + B2 + C2) − kc M B2∕(A2 + B2 + C2) − B2 = 0
(4.11)
B2 − B4 = 0 (4.12)
kc M B2∕(A2 + B2 + C2) − C2 = 0 (4.13)
C2 − C3 − C5 = 0 (4.14)
where
M is the total mass in the reactor,
K is the equilibrium constant for A ⇄ B (dimensionless),
k is the forward rate constant for A → B (h−1), and
kc is the forward rate constant for B → C (h−1).44 4 Experimentation and Modeling in Support of Design
Solving these six equations requires knowledge of the values of M and K, k, and kc at the tem￾perature of operation. It also requires the setting of one or more boundary conditions. In this case,
it is sufficient to set:
the production rate of product B, i.e., B4 kg h−1,
the purge rate of C, C5 kg h−1, and
the ratio of A to C in the purge stream, A5/C5.
The process designer does not initially know M but rather seeks to determine what it must be.
Another boundary condition, the ratio of B toAin the stream leaving the reactor, allows the reaction
terms to be inverted and yield the value of M (this assumes the concentration of C to be small). The
ratio of B to A is likely the specification that the designer wants to make since it defines the split
between the reactor and separation column.
Steady-state modeling showsthe flows and compositionsthat the designer hopesto see. However,
process materials, being inanimate, do not read the flow sheet and therefore must be constrained,
by process control, to adhere to the flow sheet. Control is therefore part of process design, and this
aspect can be very much helped by creating a dynamic math model. Creating such a model should
be very much within the capabilities of a skilled model builder.
Referring once again to the example of Figures 2.1 and 4.6, let M be the total mass of material in
the reactor. Figure 2.3 shows this amount to be controlled by manipulating the flow of stream 1. A
simple dynamic model is
d[M]∕d[𝜙] = F1 + F3 − F2 (4.15)
where 𝜙 is the time. Because of the nonzero derivative, we can numerically integrate the equation
to follow how the process develops. However, unless the flows F1, F2, and F3 rigorously follow the
steady-state values, the reactor will either overfill or empty itself with time.
A controllerfunction must be added to the model, and a proportional–integral control isselected,
f = minus GAIN × {(M − M∘) + RESET−1 × Σ(M − M∘)Δ𝜙} (4.16)
where f is the correctional signal to the manipulated variable, F1,
GAIN and RESET (or RESET time) are the controller constants, and
M∘ is the set point for level in the reactor.
For now, derivative action is being neglected,
Instantaneous F1 (for use in Eq. (4.5) = f + F1 (from the steady − state equation)) (4.17)

With this very simple model – Eqs. (4.15)–(4.17) – the fluctuations in F1 and M can be tracked
with time.
This model can be used to determine the best valuesfor GAIN and RESET. In Eq. (4.7), a periodic
(sinusoidal or square wave) fluctuation can be imposed on F2 or F3 and the effect can be seen in
the resulting predictions of fluctuations of mass M. The values for GAIN and RESET can be varied
to minimize the fluctuations in mass, thus indicating the best choices.
The simplicity of this example is owing to the simplicity of the task, namely (i) controlling the
overall contents of a simple well-mixed vessel and (ii) using an active final control element – a
pump. Creating a similar model for the control of temperature in the reboiler would require
knowledge of the relationship between the liquid composition and temperature and also of the
characteristics of the control valve.

Operating Problems: Solution by Design
The objective in this chapter is to anticipate problems that may occur during full-scale operation
and to suggest how initial design can help avoid them before they ever occur.
There will be enough problems that are not foreseen: Those residual problems will call for a very
important skill in plant operation, namely troubleshooting. However, the goal of this chapter is to
minimize the necessity for that skill.
Ten common potential trouble spots are examined here:
1. Buildup of extraneous substances
2. Corrosion
3. Erosion and cavitation
4. Flashing and phase separation
5. Excessive foaming and entrainment
6. Interaction between units
7. Liquid hammer and vibrations
8. Restrictions in piping systems
9. Scaling and fouling
10. Static buildup
5.1 Buildup of Extraneous Substances
Substances other than the desired product are often tolerable at low concentrations either in
the product itself or at intermediate points. A substance may simply be considered as a product
impurity. It may have entered with the feed stream or it may be internally generated chemically.
At steady state, the goal is to have it expelled at the same rate as it enters or is generated and
to have its in situ concentration low. Figure 5.1 shows a situation where this is not the case.
The gas mixture which enters the condenser has a component which does not condense, at
least under the conditions of the condenser. The mass of gas would gradually extend down
into the vessel and interfere with its operation. The solution to the problem is also shown
in the figure.
Figure 5.2 shows a distillation column (on the right) in which a minor component Z is trapped
and reaches major concentrations. This happens when it vaporizes at the high temperature near
the bottom of the column and condenses at the lower temperature near the top. The solution may
be to withdraw a sidestream purge at the point where it has maximum concentration, or possibly

the column pressure could be changed, which alters relative volatility and affects boiling points, so
that the component exitsthe tower. Figure 5.2 shows a purge stream of component C from a recycle
system which helps keep its concentration in control. Such a stream unfortunately includes some
wastage of useful components.
Dealing with component trapping requires knowledge of the chemistry of the process. It is also
an effect that an integrated and comprehensive pilot plant needs to investigate.
Kister (2004) and Ramchandran (2006) provided more information on this topic.
5.2 Corrosion
The chemical breakdown of piping and containment vessels can take place both internally and
externally. The latter occurs between insulation and the outer wall and is due to moisture invading
that space. The prevention is to cover up outdoor insulation. To detect issues, potential trouble
spots should be subjected to periodic visual, ultrasonic inspection, or X-ray inspection.5.3 Erosion and Cavitation 49
In choosing material for vessels and piping, the designer consults tables of material compati￾bility. If the process materials are complex, then testing should be done at conditions of eventual
operation. Coupons of possible construction materials can be installed in a pilot plant, and their
weight loss is measured over time.
The temperature of a heat transfer surface should be kept low by making it large and by
providing a favorable coefficient of heat transfer. This minimizes the undesirable chemistry in
both the surface metal and the process fluid next to it.
The quality of the construction material also plays a role. It should be checked (and rejected)
for defects, sharp edges, crevasses, and dissimilar metals. The last condition can occur when an
instrument of a different metal is installed.
Kane (2007) discussed corrosion monitoring, and Whitaker (2005) discussed corrosion under
insulation.
5.3 Erosion and Cavitation
Over a long time, the interior of vessels and pipe will shed a few molecular layers due to friction
with process fluids. Assuming no chemical attack, this erosion can largely be ignored if the flow
velocity is kept to recommended rates [Ludwig (1999) provided additional guidelines]:
● 1.2–2.4 m s−1 for low-viscosity liquids,
● 25–40 for steam, and
● around 30 for air or gas.
The walls of pneumatic conveying pipes for solid particles are an obvious candidate for erosion,
but the vendor/designer sizes these pipes with this in mind. A high-density solid material with
sharp edges might warrant special attention.
Cavitation is the sudden appearance of vapor bubbles in an otherwise flow of liquid. When this
happens in a centrifugal pump – which would be at the entrance hub where the local pressure is at
a minimum – it can be damaging to the pump as well as reducing efficiency. Pump manufacturers
specify a minimum net positive suction head (NPSH), for a given pump, namely how far above the
fluid vapor pressure the upstream entry to the pump must be. This allows for the drop between the
pump inlet pressure and hub pressure. That pressure difference is actually expressed in the “head”
of liquid to allow for differences in liquid density. If a pump is run with an NPSH less than the
manufacture-specified minimum, then cavitation may occur. It is recommended that the piping
diameter and vertical sections be designed to keep the NPSH available at least 3 ft, or 20%, above
the minimum required by the manufacturer.
The same effect can also occur for valves, as seen in Figure 5.3.
Ludwig (1999) provided guidance.

5.4 Flashing and Phase Separation
Some varieties of this phenomenon are as follows:
● A liquid stream splits into a vapor–liquid mixture.
● A liquid stream splits into two immiscible liquid phases.
● Solid particles appear in a liquid stream, or a coating starts to precipitate on solid surfaces.
● A vapor starts to condense into a liquid (or a solid). This is a particular problem when it happens
in or before a compressor, which is designed to handle gases but is damaged by the presence of
liquid.
● A solid being conveyed starts to liquefy or sublime.
To guard against these occurrences, it is fundamental to understand the phase equilibria and
chemistry of the process materials. This lets the design maintain conditions of pressure and
temperature to prevent the undesirable splits. In construction, cold spots and hot spots should be
eliminated. The pipe or vessel may have to be traced with tempered water or hot oil or electrical
heating. If high pressure is involved, seek out and consult an academic or other expert with a
high-pressure viewing facility that allows the observation of phase behavior.
5.5 Excessive Foaming and Entrainment
As part of the process design, a determination should be made of the propensity of the process
materials to foam. Organic compounds possessing polar groups are especially prone to foaming.
The usual method of reducing this action is by the addition of an antifoam compound.
Whether a liquid is a foamer or not, it will expand if gas or vapor is passed up through it. See
Figure 5.4. The key parameter is the superficial velocity of the gas US and of its related parameter
the f-factor. A rule of thumb is to keep the superficial velocity less than 0.5 fts−1 or 0.15 m s−1. The
f-factor is defined as
f = US∕
√liquid density
and it should be kept less than 0.1 in imperial units and 0.12 in SI units. This is done by making
the cross-sectional area of the column adequate.
For distillation columns, the Souders–Brown criteria should be consulted.
The expansion of the mixture is related to the bulk density of the mixture,
Hexpanded∕Hliquid = 1∕bulk density
where, for low viscosity liquids, the bulk density can fall to 0.6 at high US, and for high viscosity
liquids, down to 0.35.

Adequate freeboard must also be provided in orderto allow liquid entrainment to settle back into
the pool.
Koller (2004) discussed foam control in fermentation processes.
5.6 Interaction Between Units
Figures 5.5–5.7 illustrate some of the waysin which one part of a system inadvertently affects other
parts. The system in Figure 5.5 shows two flows, A and B, fed by a common source. If the common
line is too small, then the pressure drop in the common line imposed by the flow to B restricts the
flow to A. The simplest solution is to make the common pipe bigger. A more expensive solution is
to provide each inlet with its own separate pump.
Figure 5.6 shows flooding of a vessel because of low pressure. A solution would be to have a
separate drainage system from the low pressure vessel. A cheaper solution would be to install a
flow restriction (e.g. a valve) in the line between the two vessels so that the liquid from the second
vessel sees a lesser downstream pressure (P2 or less) and is able to flow.
Figure 5.7 shows a venting system where the driving force is inadequate: P3 is too high.

Pressure balances are often overlooked when chemistry, mass transfer, and heat transfer
are the focus. Time should be scheduled for a separate review of this potentially troublesome
aspect – which is generally fairly easy to correct. A “pressure profile” of the process can be
generated to assist in understanding and eliminating such problems.
Other interactions can be prevented by providing buffer vessels between process units.
Structuring of control schemes requires consideration of unwanted interactions: avoid the tail
wagging the dog.
5.7 Liquid Hammer and Vibrations
Two-phase gas–liquid flow can assume a number of forms, depending mainly on the ratio of gas
flow to liquid flow and also on the velocity of the overall flow. Sketches of the varieties of flows and
predictive methods are given in Chapter 12. For the present, the warning is to avoid the slug-flow
region. This region is shown on the Baker plot for horizontal flow and on the Charles plot for
vertical flow (Figures 5.8 and 5.9).In thistype of two-phase flow, the gas and liquid travel in separate
axial pockets. The liquid pockets, impelled by the high gas velocity, reach a speed such that at
any change in direction, there is a large force on the piping and its support. This action is well
recognized (especially by anyone in the vicinity of the steam hammer) and is considered potentially
damaging and dangerous. Any situation where the two-phase flow is going to occur should be
checked to make sure the flow regime is in a safe area of the Baker or Charles plot. If the desired
flow is a gas and the liquid is simply a condensate, then installing a low-point drain in the pipe can
help shift the flow regime into a safer territory.
“Hammer”, also called water hammer or hydraulic shock, can also occur with only one phase
(liquid). The mechanism is the sudden stopping of flow (e.g. closing of a valve) and the sudden
change in fluid momentum. Significant damage to the piping can occur. Slowly closeling valves,
providing surge suppressors, or piping changes can provide protection against liquid hammer.
The tubes in heat exchangers sometimes enter into vibrations. One such vibration mode
occurs in sympathy with the frequency of periodic shedding of fluid from the wake behind a
tube (Figure 5.10). A vendor would know about the conditions where this could occur, as well
as conditions for other modes of vibration. It could affect the mechanical integrity of the heat
exchanger.

5.8 Restrictions in Piping Systems
Among much more complicated design questions, inadequacies in piping should seldom happen.
However, there are several situations that could arise.
1. It is desired to expand the plant, but the piping – sized asjust big enough initially – imposes flow
restrictions.
2. The pressure drop of fittings and valves was underestimated.
3. The piping gotrougher because of erosion, corrosion, or precipitation, causing the friction factor
to rise. Cavitation in the piping may not increase the pressure drop, but it may cause the piping
or valves to fail prematurely.
4. A gravity-driven flow is impeded by vapor entrainment.
5. A gas flow, assumed to be incompressible and so calculated, turns out to have a Mach number
greater than the 0.3 limit for incompressible-flow assumptions for calculations.
To minimize the occurrence of these difficulties, there are a few measures:
● Err on the generousside in pipe sizing, unlesssettling orstratification could occur. The largersize
piping will impose less pressure drop initially and will facilitate plant expansions in the future.
● Use the most conservative predictions of pressure loss in valves and fittings.
● Use predictive methods for gravity flow, where entrained air or gas can accompany the liquid.54 5 Operating Problems: Solution by Design
● If there is any doubt about whether a gas flow should be considered compressible (Mach No
greater than 0.3), use the isothermal compressible-flow formula for pressure drop,
P1
2 − P2
2 = (4 f L∕D)×[G2 R T∕(gC M)] × {1 + [2∕(4 f L∕D)] ln(P1∕P2)} (5.1)
which reduces to the usual incompressible-flow formula at low Mach,
P1 − P2 = (4 f L∕D) [G2
∕(2 gC 𝜌)] (5.2)
where P is the pressure, f is the friction factor, L is the pipe length, D is the pipe internal diameter,
G is the gas mass velocity, R is the gas constant (mass basis), T is the temperature, gC is the
flow-to-pressure conversion factor, M is the molecular weight, and 𝜌 is the gas density.
5.9 Scaling and Fouling
Scaling and fouling show up gradually, typically in a loss of heat transfer across a surface or
in an increase of pressure drop in the fluid flow. For heat transfer, these effects may be slowed
down by providing adequate transfer area so that the surface temperature does not have to be
excessive and by ensuring high fluid sheer rates (Nesta J. – Hyd. Proc. 2004). For fluid flow,
provide access points where brushes or other cleaning tools can reach the scaled or fouled
surface.
Passivating chemical agents may be able to keep “crud” from adhering to metal walls of pipes
and vessels. See references for further applicable guidelines and articles on this.
5.10 Static Buildup
The sudden discharge of electricity between two unequally charged surfaces can be an unpleasant
sensation when a home is at low humidity during the winter.
In an industrial plant, it can be the trigger of a fire or an explosion.
Electrostatic charge can develop whenever work is done on a liquid or solid. For a liquid, the
work may consist of forcing it through a pipe or filter, agitating it, spraying it, and letting it fall or
settle.
For solid pellets or powders, the work may consist of pneumatically transferring them through a
pipe, blending them, grinding them, and classifying them.
Most of the hazards are eliminated by connecting vessels and piping to ground and by
conductively bonding various parts of the system to one another.
There are several measuresthat can be taken to avoid this very serioussituation ofstatic buildup:
1. Ensure that filling systems operate at low velocity (less than 3 ft (1 m) per second if there is free
fall of the fluid),
2. Avoid mist-generating situations,
3. Provide adequate and secure grounding and bonding,
4. For procedures where bonding is provided only periodically, allow time forthe charge to “relax,”
5. For particles or powders that have been in motion, provide a charge-dissipation step before
loading into nonmetallic containers, and
6. Refer to API Recommended Practice, “Protection against ignitions arising out of static,
lightning, and stray currents”.References 55

Process Monitoring and Control
An important part of any chemical process is the instrumentation that is provided to monitor and
control it. The common element of the two functions, monitoring and control, is measurement.
Not every quantity that is measured gets controlled, but every quantity that is controlled must be
measured. Many noncontrolled quantities are measured in order to understand how the process is
functioning and to detect if it is drifting away from normalcy. From the point of view of the process
operator, the more things that are measured the better, including sometimes hard-to-measure
but important quantities. From the point of view of management and the project person who is
installing the process, the fewer things measured the better because instrumentation costs money.
It is often a tug-of-war between the two parties.
The control that is discussed in this chapter is automatic process control, which is the regulation
of the process via quick-acting mechanisms that do not require human intervention except for
the setting of set points (SPs). There is another type of control: statistical process control. Although
not discussed in this chapter, it merits a description because it too contributes to the success of
the process once in operation. It is “powered” by humans and takes place over time. The core
activity is the time-wise gathering and statistical analysis of process data, including especially the
characteristics of the final product. Each of these process quantities has a mean and an inherent
variability about the mean. The data gathering aims to detect any departure from the mean or
the usual variability. The aim is to detect incipient problems, determine the source, and correct
them early.
The following topics of automatic process control are examined in this section:
● the options for measurement of control variables (CVs),
● combinations of controllers for specific purposes,
● causes of non-optimum control, and
● programmable controllers and distributed control systems.
6.1 Options for Measurement of Control Variables (CVs)
A single control loop, as shown in Figure 6.1, comprises at least three, generally five, and
sometimes more elements. Three of these elements – the controller itself (LIC, level indicator
and controller) plus signal converters for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog – are generic
nonmechanical devices. A person knowledgeable in controls specifies the details of these elements
with input from the process designer who communicates desired ranges and relevant process
details such as freezing points, the presence of solids, or trace corrosive components.

The fourth element is the final control device (a valve in Figure 6.1), and its choice may be a joint
decision between a specialist and the process designer.
However, it is the fifth element that requires the greatest attention by the process designer: the
device which continually measures the variable (the CV) which it desires to control. In the case of
the control loop of Figure 6.1, the CV is the liquid level.
The other four components of the control loop are often left to the process control specialists,
but choosing the method of measurement should involve the process designer and is therefore
discussed here.
The following table shows most of the combinations of controlled variables and manipulated vari￾ables (MVs) that are found in chemical processes.
Other quantities that are controlled directly or by inference are compositions, including pH.
The MV is the “handle,” whereby the controlled variable is being continually brought to its SP.
It is seen that the same CV may be controlled by a choice of MVs.
In this section, measurement methods are reviewed for the four control quantities listed in the
left-hand column of Table 6.1. The principle is described, and precautions are given that help
avoid the “failure” of the instrument to deliver a reliable measurement. A fifth discussion concerns
the inference of composition by the measurement of a physical quantity such as pH, refractive
index, and viscosity.

6.1.1 Temperature
The simplest and most common device is the thermocouple (Figure 6.2). It makes use of the fact
that when wires of two dissimilar metals are joined at two points of unequal temperature, a small
voltage difference appears between the two ends. One end is the point where the temperature is to
be measured. Theoretically, the other end should be kept at a fixed temperature, but, in practice,
variation is compensated for electronically. The temperature at the measurement point is inferred
from the electromotive force (EMF) at the other end.
The advantages of thermocouples are as follows:
● low cost and simplicity,
● high-temperature capability (750, 1250 ∘C depending on the wire materials), and
● potentially quick response.
The disadvantages are as follows:
● only moderate accuracy, e.g., +/− 2 ∘C,
● long-term instability,
● dependence on the measurement of small EMF, and
● susceptibility to extraneous electrical paths.
A thermocouple can be used bare-ended, but generally they are provided with a closed sheath
to protect them from process fluids. The figure shows the thermocouple both insulated from the
sheath and in contact with the sheath. The latter configuration gives faster response but requires
that the sheath be insulated from the measurement circuitry. If the device is positioned in a
thermowell, then it must make good contact with the end of the well.
Resistance
Figure 6.3 Resistive
temperature device
(RTD).
Another electrically based instrument is the resistive temperature device
or RTD (Figure 6.3). The principle is that the resistance of a metal changes
with temperature. By making a length of wire (wound into a coil) subject
to the temperature to be measured and building it into an automated
Wheatstone bridge so that its resistance can be measured, the temperature
is determined.
The wire coil occupies a finite space as opposed to the point junction of
the thermocouple, so the measurement is not as localized.
EMF
Figure 6.2 Thermocouples, sheathing and wells.60 6 Process Monitoring and Control
The advantages are as follows:
● accuracy, e.g., +/− 0.15 ∘C;
● long-term stability.
The disadvantages are as follows:
● cost,
● fragility, and
● upper temperature limit of about 500 ∘C.
Whereasthe thermocouple must make good contact with the end of a thermowell, the RTD must
have a tight fit along its sides.
6.1.2 Flow
One class of flow meter depends on the interconvertibility of pressure and momentum.In the orifice
(Figure 6.4) and venturi meters, the flow is accelerated by passing through a constriction and the
volumetric flow is inferred from the decrease in pressure.
A similar but more sophisticated device is the venturi tube (Figure 6.5), which is less prone to
plugging or stagnation and which imposes less net drop in the pressure between upstream and
downstream.
Figure 6.4 Orifice volumetric flow meter.
∆P
Figure 6.5 Venturi volumetric flow meter.6.1 Options for Measurement of Control Variables (CVs) 61
Figure 6.6 Pitot tube for volumetric flow.
∆P
Dynamic hole
Static hole
In the pitot tube (Figure 6.6), the flow is brought to zero at a point (the “dynamic hole”) and the
excess pressure above that at the “static hole” is a measure of velocity.
The pitot tube is even less obstructive to the flow but gives a local measurement of velocity which
may not be representative of the total flow. The holes may also be prone to plugging.
An advantage of all these devices is their relative simplicity and low cost. A disadvantage is the
fact that that the signal,
Pressure difference, ΔP is proportional to velocity2
This relationship makes the devices inaccurate at flow rates below about 25% of full scale.
With all three devices, care must be taken to ensure zero or equal liquid head in the lines leading
to the differential pressure cell.
Two instruments that provide a signal that is proportional to the first power of velocity are the
turbine meter and the vortex-shedding meter (Figures 6.7 and 6.8). Both of them require an external
electronic “pickup” to count either turbine rotation or shedding frequency.
The advantage of the turbine is good “turndown”, about 10 : 1, and good accuracy, about 0.25%.
The disadvantage is susceptibility to fouling, especially of the bearings at each end of the turning
shaft.
The advantages of the vortex-shedding meter are a turndown of 25 : 1, an accuracy of 1%, no
moving parts, and resistance to fouling.
The disadvantages are the susceptibility of the electronics to miscellaneous noise and also the
requirement of a Reynolds number range to ensure that the shedding frequency really is propor￾tional to the velocity. Thisrange is between 300 and 100 000 based on the diameter ofthe obstruction
that generates the wake shedding.

Magnetic

flowmeter.
The magnetic flow meter or magmeter (Figure 6.9) works on the principle that
a voltage (EMF) gets induced in a conductor moving through a magnetic field.
In this case, the conductor is the flowing fluid, which must possess some con￾ductivity and is therefore restricted to liquids. It is ineffective for demineralized
water and nonconducting oils.
The advantages are a turndown of 30 : 1 and an accuracy of about 0.75%.
The disadvantages are as follows:
● restriction to conductive liquids;
● temperature limited to 200, 300 ∘C.
All of the above devices measure velocity or volumetric flow. The Coriolis meter
or mass flowmeter (Figure 6.10) measures mass flow. The principle is that of
Coriolis which is the rotational form of Newton’s second law, Force = Mass × Acceleration. The
fluid flows through a U-bend, the center of which is vibrated up and down. The result is a twisting
of the U-tube by an amount proportional to the mass flow rate.
The advantages are as follows:
● high accuracy, 0.1%,
● high turndown, 100 : 1,
● applicable to both gases and liquids,6.1 Options for Measurement of Control Variables (CVs) 63
● sensitivity to mass rather than volumetric flow,
● pressure range up to 1500 psi, and
● temperature range –240 to +400 ∘C.
The disadvantage is cost.
All of the above measurements produce a signalrelated to instantaneous flow. An alternative isto
accumulate and weigh material(M) over a time period (𝜙) and calculate the flow as M/𝜙. This could
be a quick and simple method for bench-scale experiments.Itis also a way of checking or calibrating
the results of the above instantaneous methods. It has particular application for measuring the flow
of solids, where the solid stream is periodically directed onto a load cell for fixed time intervals and
the weight is measured.
6.1.3 Level
∆P
Figure 6.11 Liquid
level by static head
pressure differential.
Two of the most common methods of measuring the level make use of
the static-head pressure that a liquid exerts (Figure 6.11). In one case,
the differential pressure between the vapor space above the liquid and a
point below the surface isinterpreted to determine the level. Seals can be
provided to isolate the process fluid from the sensorto reduce the chance
of freezing for plugging. In the second case (Figure 6.12), the pressure
required to maintain a stream of gas into the lower levels of the liquid is
measured.
The advantages of these two methods are simplicity and relatively
low cost.
The disadvantages are as follows:
● direct contact with the process liquid,
● dependence on the knowledge of density,
● restriction of the bubbler system to vented systems,
● necessity to keep lines free of condensate, e.g., condensate, and
● sweep gas reduces the possibility of plugging, but depending on the service, that possibility
remains.

∆P
Air or
gas64 6 Process Monitoring and Control
A better indication of the situation in the vessel is obtained by mounting a second mea￾suring point at a different level in the liquid. The difference in static head between the two
liquid-immersed points gives a measure of density, which can then be used in interpreting the
height signal.
When it is desired to avoid intrusion into a vessel, for instance, if it is under high pressure or high
vacuum orif the contents are hazardous, it is possible to use nuclearradiation to “see” what isinside
(Figure 6.13). An expanding beam from a source on one side of the vessel is partially intercepted
and attenuated by liquid in the vessel. The receiver on the otherside picks up the residualradiation.
The nuclear source is usually the isotope Cesium 137 or Cobalt 60.
The advantages of this method are as follows:
● non-contact with process materials,
● effectiveness even through heavy-walled vessels,
● for existing vessels, no modification required, and
● low maintenance.
The disadvantages are as follows:
● stringent regulation,
● potential hazard to health if mismanaged,
● relatively narrow range of height, and
● confounding effect of foam and density.
The property of liquid capacitance can be used to detect the level(Figure 6.14). A probe isinserted
into the liquid, and the capacitance is measured between an outer sheath and an inner core. The
signal depends on how much of the surfaces are in contact with liquid.
The advantage is that such probes are in common use and therefore economical and well
developed.
The disadvantages are as follows:
● full contact with the process liquid,
● capacitance sensitivity to the nature of the liquid, and
● possibility of surface fouling and therefore the change of response.
Figure 6.13 Nuclear level gage.6.1 Options for Measurement of Control Variables (CVs) 65
Figure 6.14 Capacitance liquid level probe.
Figure 6.15 Ultrasonic level detector.
An ultrasonic source and detector mounted on the top of a vessel provides a measurement of
level by measuring the time it takes for sound waves to travel down to the surface and reflect back
(Figure 6.15).
The advantages are as follows:
● The intrusion into the vessel is at the top, where leakage and contamination are least likely.
● There are no moving parts.66 6 Process Monitoring and Control
The disadvantages are as follows:
● The signal can be affected by dust, foam, waves, and noise.
● The upper temperature limit is low.
● The instrument must be calibrated against an empty tank.
The level measurement of solids is complicated because of the fact that solids, unlike liquids, do
not seek their own uniform level. A nuclear level gauge or an ultrasonic level detector could detect
the peak of the solid pile. If only the amount of solids is required, then it can be weighed.
6.1.4 Pressure
Pressure is measured forits own sake and also as part of the measurement of flow and of liquid level.
In many cases, the measurement is the difference of pressure between two points. The instrumen￾tation is based on the movement of a flexible element, forinstance, a bellows or a diaphragm, which
is translated into a gauge reading and/or into a pneumatic or electrical signal for transmission to a
controller (Figure 6.16).
If a differential pressure, say between “A” and “B”, is being measured, the two pressures are con￾nected to opposite sides ofthe instrument.If a single-point gauge pressure is desired,the instrument
is put in “vented” mode, i.e., one side is left open to atmosphere. If single-point absolute pressure
is desired, then one side of the instrument is plugged and evacuated (Figure 6.17).
In the case of differential measurement, the actual difference to be measured may be much
smaller than the overall pressure of the system. In this case, the two sides of the device must be

equipped with a balance line which is open when the device is put in service to avoid having high
unbalanced pressure exerted on one side of a delicate diaphragm or bellows (Figure 6.18). Valve
“C” is then closed after both valves “A” and “B” are open.
6.1.5 Concentration
The most important information about a process stream is its content, and measuring that con￾tent is not as straightforward as measuring physical parameters like temperature and flow. The
fallback is to take regular samples for analysis in a laboratory. The technique of gel permeation
chromatography has been developed as an online instrument which can provide data for inspec￾tion and feedback within minutes. Near infrared can also detect key aspects of a stream and can
be an integral part of a control loop. Both of these techniques require much time and expensive
equipment, so they are not wide spread. However, they can make a process possible that would not
otherwise be so.
The more common practice is to develop a relation between (a) some easily measured physical
property and (b) the concentration of interest. Those physical properties include pH, refractive
index, density, and viscosity. The relation must be robust in the sense that it is one-to-one and not
influenced by extraneousfactorssuch astemperature and the concentrations of other components.
6.2 Combinations of Controllers for Specific Purposes
The simplest configuration in process control is the single input/single output loop (SISO), as
shown in Figure 6.1. The following illustrations expand on more complex possibilities.68 6 Process Monitoring and Control

The two basic PMC units are indicators and controllers (and combined indicator controllers).
Figure 6.19 shows two flows, both indicated (their values displayed), and one of them controlled,
plus a liquid level which is controlled but not indicated.
These devicesinteract with each other only at the processlevel. The flow controller(on the right)
causes the tank level to fluctuate, but that CV (the level) is regulated by its own loop (on the left).
The following schemesshow some waysin which control loops are configured to work in tandem
with one another.
Figure 6.20 shows an alarm is given if the contents of the tank drop below a prescribed level.
A second alarm is given, and the outflow is shut off via an interlock if the tank level drops further
to a second prescribed (low low) value.
Notes on symbology in Fig 6.20: The symbology in this diagram uses a dashed line perInstrument
Society of America standard for P&ID’s (standard ISA 5.1A). A dashed line represents a hardwired
electrical signal connection between devices. The circle symbol (e.g. LIT (Level Indicating Trans￾mitter)) is used to show instrument devices that are mounted in the field. The circle in a square
symbol (e.g. LIC) shows a device that is located in a computer control system, usually a distributed
control computer. The arrow pointing down on a valve stem indicatesthe valve is a fail closed valve.
Symbols and line types on PFDs commonly do not conform to ISA standards for P&IDs. The
reader of a PFD is often expected to know whether a solid line type is intended to be a process line
or a control signal (electrical, pneumatic, and software).
It is desired to control the tank temperature by using a steam heater (Figure 6.21). Instead of
manipulating the steam valve directly to control the vessel temperature, we use Cascade control.6.2 Combinations of Controllers for Specific Purposes 69
FIC
LC
PC TIC
Figure 6.21 Cascade control.
FIC
LC
ZC
Figure 6.22 Balancing control or valve-position control.
The temperature is controlled by manipulating the SP of the steam pressure controller. The benefit
is that the control is less sensitive to any fluctuations in steam upstream supply pressure. Note that
the steam pressure isthe MV of the outer control loop and isthe controlled variable of the innerloop.
To obtain more precise control of the outflow, we provide parallel paths and do the immediate
manipulation on the smaller flow (Figure 6.22). This valve is precise, but its range is small, so we
add a slower loop to adjust the large flow to keep the small valve near the center of its range. This
is called balancing control (in this case valve-position control), and we are using the second loop to
control the small-valve position, denoted by “Z”.
It is desired to keep a constant composition of flow feeding a subsequent unit, so the sidestream
flow is kept in a constant ratio to the main flow. This technique of ratio control (Figure 6.23) is
a form of feed-forward control: instead of waiting for the final combined flow to show deviance
from its desired composition and then correcting it, the correction is already made. In many cases,
there is no online method of measuring composition, so ratio control is a necessity. Taking samples
regularly and analyzing in the lab will ensure that the correct proportions are indeed being met.
In order to maintain closer control over the tank level, provision is made to respond early to
changes in outflow SP setting. This is an example of feed-forward control even though, in this
example, the direction of information flow is backward. The use of a calculational block isillustrated
in Figure 6.24, combining the flow signal with the level signal and using a programmed algorithm
to determine the correct position of the inflow valve.70 6 Process Monitoring and Control

Sometimes there is an interaction between control loops: In this case, the heater may create bub￾bles which affect level and, at the same time, changes in level may uncover part of the heater and
affect the ability to transfer heat. In Figure 6.25, “LIT” and “Temperature Transmitter (TT)” denote
level-measuring and temperature-measuring devices. To deal with the interaction, multiple input,

multiple output (MIMO) control may be appropriate. This is not a common practice: 95% of control
loops are said to be SISO.
As can be seen, there are specific avenues for reaching the accuracy and tightness of control that
is required. For the operator of the process, it is important to know what is controlling what.
6.3 Causes of Non-Optimum Control
Some of the following difficulties are apparent only afterthe processis operational. However, many
can be circumvented by proper attention during the process design stage.
Good and bad control is a very simple concept: How close does the controlled variable stay to the
SP. It is understood that CV will always deviate somewhat because this is the nature of feedback
control: A deviation is required before control action is taken. Only if disturbances are absent and
if the SP is constant, will the CV stay exactly at the SP.
The key questions are as follows:
● How close is it really necessary for CV to be to its SP?
● How reliable is the measurement of CV?
● How fast and with how much cycling does CV return to its SP after a disturbance or a SP change?
The answer to the first question depends on the nature of the process. Sometimes the limits are
wide: Forinstance, the level in a holding tank orsurge tank mightsatisfactorily be allowed to range
between almost empty and almost full although half-full may be the preferred level, i.e., the SP.
If the operator sees or suspects that the answer to the second or third question is not satisfactory,
then there are four areas to examine.
The process itself may be difficult to control. It may be inherently unstable, in which case the
control system has to deal with this fact. On the contrary, it may be suffering from disturbances
that are correctable. For instance, it may be hard to control temperature in a vessel if a nearby door
is opened from time to time to a winter wind. Sometimes control loops “fight” each other: In the
example of Figure 6.25 showing MIMO control, if the level control and temperature control had
been done separately (in two SISO loops), the interaction would have made one or both controls
lessthan optimum.In Figure 6.26, if level control in the downstream vessel is aggressive, i.e., calling
for large fluctuations in inflow, then it may be difficult to control the level in the upstream vessel.
Figure 6.26 also shows a design error that sometimes goes unnoticed across different PFD or
P&ID sheets. When the same variable is being manipulated (i.e. liquid flow) by two different con￾troller types, a dueling between controllers can occur.
Another situation where control may be difficult is for a loop that receives its SP as the output
from another controller. For instance, it may be the “inner” loop in a cascade or balancing
configuration. If the outer loop is tightly tuned, with high gain and rapid reset, it will cause the
inner loop to work excessively.
The sensor, i.e., the measurement of the controlled variable, may be the source of trouble. There
are several possibilities:
● It may be broken. This condition can manifest itself as a constantsignal or as a rapidly fluctuating
signal and is usually quite obvious.
● Its accuracy may be compromised: A thermocouple may be improperly installed in its thermow￾ell, or a differential-pressure cell may have legs unevenly filled with liquid, or a flow meter may
be operating at the low end of its range.
● It may be improperly calibrated, or it may have been replaced by a unit with different calibration.72 6 Process Monitoring and Control

It may be poorly located relative to the point at which the MV acts. In Figure 6.27, the presence
of the vessel between the point of additive addition and the point of measurement makesit difficult
to achieve good control (“A” denotes an analyzer measurement).
The final control element may suffer from malfunction. The most common final element is a
valve, which may suffer from
● stickiness, causing it to move in jumps rather than smoothly with its input signal,
● hysteresis, causing it to have, for the same signal, a different opening depending on whether the
opening is increasing or decreasing, and
● saturation.
The first two conditions can be checked by taking the valve offline and observing its position as
the signal to it is changed manually. Proper maintenance can usually correct the problem.
Saturation is the condition where the element reaches the limit of its ability to affect the process.
For instance, if the controller is calling for a flow that drives the valve wide open or to a state
where further opening does not produce significantly more flow, then control is not achieved.
This situation arises typically where either the valve was undersized in the first place or an
increase in production rate causes a valve to become undersized. This is especially true of the
controller that has an integral component to it, and a “integral anti-windup” feature should be
considered.
The control system itself may be the cause of poor control. Control action is one of the three
actions that affect the controlled variable, the other two being external disturbances and resetting6.3 Causes of Non-Optimum Control 73

the SP. Poor controllersettings can make the controlled variable fluctuate and even make the system
unstable. This happens when the process gain is set too high or when the reset (integral) action
comes on too quickly. On the contrary, low gain and low integral action let the controlled variable
wander loosely around the SP. Controller “tuning” is the art of setting gain, reset, and derivative
action to the correct intensity for adequate control.
Figures 6.28 and 6.29 show the time-wise response of the controlled variable to a disturbance with
fast-acting and slower-acting control. The former gets the CV back to its SP more quickly but in an
oscillatory fashion with some significant undershoot. As long as the undershoot can be tolerated,
this is a very satisfactory control action. If the oscillations persist and especially if they grow, then
the control action is less ideal and possibly even destructive. Recall, the standard control equation
for a control loop is
MV = GAIN × {CV − SP + (1∕RESET) × Σ(CV − SP) + DERIV × d(CV − SP)∕d(time)}
(6.1)

optimum combination of GAIN, RESET TIME, and DERIV.74 6 Process Monitoring and Control
6.4 Programmable Controllers and Distributed Control Systems
A short history of the development of process control helps to put the current state in perspective.
The earliest process controllers were human beings, who read the gauges and turned the valves.
For instance, in the manufacture of nitroglycerine, in the 1950s, the control was still carried out
manually and at the process equipment itself. To save manpower, some plants were configured to
bring the indicators and control elements into a central location: doing this required routing the
actual process piping through that location. This was all very primitive.
As automatic controllers became available, they were still often grouped together in panels and
in control rooms, but the measuring elements and final control elements stayed in the field. Rather
than routing the process piping through the central location, it was necessary only to bring the
information lines (pneumatic or electric) to the panel.
The advent of minicomputersled to the invention of the Programmable LogicController or PLC in
the 1960s. It comprises one or more continuous control loops plus discrete control of events, relays,
and interlocks. The device contains programmable software for carrying out these functions. It is
built to be rugged so that it can be located at the process itself. PLCs are everywhere in industry
today.
Historically, a totally different concept in computer-based process control was DDC or Direct
Digital Control. Because the individual pneumatic or electronic controller is designed to operate
according to a mathematical expression (i.e. the control equation, Eq. 6.1), it seemed natural to
turn this function over to a large central computer since mathematics is a thing that computers
do very well. The computer would communicate through cables with the field-located measuring
devices and the final control elements but would handle all control functions within itself. It
could be programmed with control algorithms more sophisticated than those of an electrical or
pneumatic device. However, there was reluctance to put all the control “eggs in one basket” since
a computer sometimes fails and a whole plant might fail along with it.
A less daunting approach was supervisory SP control, in which traditional controllers were
used but their SPs were set by a computer. This approach is commonly used today in labs, pilot
plants, and other small operations, with a Personal Computer (PC) supplying the calculational
power.
In the mid-1970s, distributed control systems (DCS) were introduced (i.e. Honeywell TDC2000),
which left the individual controllers and PLCs in or near the field but which provides commu￾nication with them and communication with the frontline human operators. The DCS provides
valuable enhancement to the whole control scheme, including “hot” backup to individual con￾trollers that occasionally fail.
Computerized central systems like DCS, PLC, and PC-based configurations provide greatly
enhanced capability to help the operator run a stable and well-observed process:
● simple and sophisticated control algorithms,
● reliability through redundancy,
● easy ability to reset SPs as well as controller settings,
● programmability of varying difficulty,
● graphic display of current information,
● tabular and graphical records of past operation, i.e., a data historian,
● alarms,6.4 Programmable Controllers and Distributed Control Systems 75
● logging of events and alarms, and
● recipe handling.
The details of these capabilities are decided by the process designer and by the future operators of
the process, in consultation with the vendor of the DCS. The document containing thisinformation
is called the functional specification and, if a distributed control system is part of the project, is a
significant part of the process design.77

Design for Safety and Health
A process design, no matter how efficient in carrying out its commercial purpose, would be
completely unacceptable if it was prone to cause injury, health impairment, equipment damage,
or detrimental change to the environment. It is part of the responsibility of the process designer to
make sure these events do not happen.
The following three steps are needed:
1. Assess hazards of the process materials, the process steps, and the process area.
2. Design the process to deal with all hazards while operating in its intended manner, but add
reactive measures for possible component failures.
3. Assemble a team of mixed competency colleagues to review both the process and the adequacy
of Safety and Health measures. Document the assessment as well as the changes made as a
result.
The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provides some guidance to the
process designer in carrying out the above tasks. They have formulated a Process Safety Manage￾ment (PSM) program, to which US industries that handle hazardous materials must adhere. It is a
fourteen-part program that extends over the life of the facility, with five of those parts of particular
relevance to design and start-up of new facilities:
● Process safety information (#1)
● Process hazard analysis (#2)
● Operating procedures (#3)
● Training (#4)
● Pre-startup safety review (#13)
The following account largely follows the PSM requirements for these five parts.
It would also be wise, as part of the design, to refer to the recommendations of Chapter 5.
7.1 Identification of Safety and Health Hazards
At the top of the list of hazards are substances that, in themselves, are hazardous. They may cause
injury to the skin (whether cold or hot), they may be acutely or chronically poisonous even in
small doses, and they may promote cancer. The OSHA website lists 254 substances that are con￾sidered highly hazardous (Note: there are 137 substances as of the 2019 edition of OSHA 1910.119
App A). Yourjurisdiction may have guidelines you should consult. The table contains, for each sub￾stance, the name, the CAS (Chem Abstracts) number, and the threshold quantity (pounds), above
which there is potential for severe damage and/or catastrophe. It is also advisable to check the
Practical Process Design for Chemical Engineers, First Edition. Keith Marchildon and David Mody.

AEGLs (Acute Exposure Guideline Levels), ERPGs (Emergency Response Planning Guidelines),
and TEELs (Temporary Emergency Exposure Limits) for any chemicals that may be present, and
guidelines for exposure concentrations.
Next on the list of hazardous substances are substances that, although not inherently deleterious
to personnel and equipment, are onesthat can react with the environment or with othersubstances
to create hazards. For example, substances that decompose at high temperature, or a hydrocarbon
mixed with air, or a polymer monomer exposed to an excess of catalyst are all candidates.
Apart from substances, the existence of high pressure can be a hazard. Chemical processes very
often operate at elevated pressure, and the hazard is a pressure that lies outside the Maximum
Allowable Working Pressure (MAWP) of the equipment. Containment within the MAWP range is
assured by mechanical and pipe specialists, who calculate the wall thickness by formula. The
MAWP is chosen as some safety factor above the design pressure, which is stated by the process
designer as the maximum pressure the process device will ever reach in normal operation. The
vessel is stamped with the MAWP. Relief valves are set at the design pressure since they may be
protecting other elements in a process.
The hazard of pressure can also apply to subatmospheric vessels. A vessel containing ammonia
vapor suddenly receives an influx of water, which absorbs all the ammonia and leaves a large
vacuum. The vessel will collapse if it is not designed for higher pressure on its outside than on its
inside. Commonly process vessels and storage tanks are specified to have a vacuum rating. Process
vessels are often designed for full vacuum, but storage tanks usually are not.
One cause of overpressure is a blockage somewhere downstream of a pump, which should show
up in pressure and/or flow measurements.
Overpressure can be the result of over-temperature.It is much more seriousif it takes place where
a liquid is the sole phase confined in a vessel rather than in a two-phase, vapor–liquid, mixture.
In the latter case, pressure is constrained to follow the vapor–liquid-equilibrium relation. In the
liquid-only case, there is no vapor to compress, and the liquid has very little compressibility, so the
pressure rises precipitately. For water, the rule of thumb is 100 psi per ∘F or 12 bar per ∘C. Thus,
this situation requires very careful monitoring, possibly interlock protection, and protection via
pressure safety relief devices (relief valves, rupture disks, etc.).
High temperature is ubiquitousin chemical processes, producing products which are then stable
at temperatures of human use. Some hazards of high temperature are as follows:
● Insufficient insulation to protect the human person. OSHA restricts human contact to 60 ∘C and,
at this temperature, for only up to five seconds.
● Insufficient insulation to maintain process flows from freezing in cold weather.
● Interaction with pressure as noted above.
● Acceleration of chemical reaction and, if exothermic, start of a runaway situation if temperature
is not controlled.
● If excessive, weakening of the strength of containment vessels and piping.
The area in which the facility is being located may already have hazards created by priorfacilities.
In North America, areas are classified by the National Electrical code (US) or the National Fire
Protection Association as
● Division 1, where an atmospheric substance is present orlikely to be present in normal operation
and could be ignited;
● Division 2, where such a substance is not present in normal operation but could be present in
abnormal operation.
Each of the two divisions are further classified according to the nature of the substance7.2 Process Design for Hazard Control: Equipment 79
● Class 1, gas or vapor;
● Class 2, dust;
● Class 3, fiber.
The knowledge of the class and division is needed when purchasing equipment and controls.
Division 1 requires items that will not spark.
None of these hazards can be allowed to jeopardize people and plant, and so must be controlled
or eliminated by proper process design.
7.2 Process Design for Hazard Control: Equipment
A process designer may be unlucky enough to have to deal with an inherently hazardoussubstance,
but there are a number of practices and devicesto reduce the risk. One approach, known asinherent
safety, is to substitute the material for something more safe or minimize the inventory. If large
amounts are needed over time, then most of it can be stored in facilities that are specially designed
forsecure storage. Piping systems will be chosen to minimize leakage: noncorroding seamless-wall
tubing with minimal openable connections. Where connections are needed, they should be with
compressible fittings; fittings with vacuum capability are considered most secure against leakage.
To keep the fluid from escaping up the stem in a leaking valve, bellows-sealed valvesshould be used,
where the stem resides inside the bellows and is attached to the bottom of the bellows. The bellows
is attached and sealed at its top to the body of the valve. See Figure 7.1.
Rather than using a centrifugal pump to move an inherently hazardous liquid, the better choice
is a seal-less centrifugal pump, which keeps process liquids away from leaking mechanical seals.
Other choices include diaphragm and peristaltic pumps, which separate fluids from the surround￾ings and can be easier to clean: See Figures 7.2 and 7.3, but consider the effects of the diaphragm
or peristaltic pump failing.
Figure 7.1 Bellows-sealed valve.80 7 Design for Safety and Health
Figure 7.2 Diaphragm pump.
Figure 7.3 Peristaltic pump.
For the measurement of temperature, a thermowell containing either a thermocouple or a resis￾tance temperature device is suitable. At other points, a thermocouple can be welded or soldered
onto the exterior wall of a pipe or vessel and covered up with insulation. The objective is to prevent
leakage and to prevent contact between process substances and hardware.
Various commercial devices measure pressure without mechanical contact with the fluid. The
pressure is generally conveyed across a membrane, but you must consider the effects of that
membrane failing either into the process or to the surroundings.

Forsubstancesthat are less of a hazard, many of the above measures are still advisable. These are
compounds that are not objectionable in themselves but must be controlled in their interactions
with other substances. Typically, a flammable material must be kept from air. However, sometimes
a controlled oxidation is part of the process itself. See Figure 7.4 where air is used to produce a
mild oxidation of a hydrocarbon. A close check is kept on the oxygen content (AIC, Analyzer
Indicating Controller) of the vessel and triggers an interlock on the air supply if the level rises
above a predetermined safe amount.
Santo (2023) discussed inherently safer design concepts to existing facilities.
7.3 Process Design for Hazard Control: Instrumentation
When pressure, temperature, flow, or composition depart from the values or limits intended in the
design of the process, one or more of the consequences need to result according to the “layers of
protection” as follows:
● early indication to the personnel operating the process,
● alarms,
● interlocks,
● relief systems, and
● plant and community emergency response systems.
This layered protection approach may require significant study since nonconformity may come
from different causes. Safety is such a paramount imperative that there should be no issue with
time or expense for making everything safe.
Alert operators regularly and systematically scan the indicators of the operating variables and
can generally tell if there is something unusual. One of the outputs from a controller is the value
of the manipulated variable, which is the signal sent by the controller to the final control element.
However, this value does not necessarily tell what the final element is doing. A sticky or broken
valve does not show up. Attaching a physical indicator to a valve stem lets the operator check.
These valves may be in a process-flow line orin a heating-fluid line. Some advanced flow controllers
already have this capability. See Figure 7.5. It is also possible to use limit switches which are inputs
to the computer control system to ensure valves have properly opened and closed.
Likewise, it is a good practice to install a confirmation of flow using a pressure switch, a speed
indicator (tachometer) on a pump, or a flow measurement after the pump. With two pumps in
parallel, one in use at a time, any unplanned change in flow can be checked out by switching pumps.
Pumps need servicing anyways. See Figure 7.6.
While conscientious operators will notice the gradual trending of controlled and manipulated
variables, sometimes the deviation from normal occurs quickly. In this case, an alarm needs to
show up, either on the operator control room screen or audibly. Controllers should have indicators

for small and large deviations of controlled variables. For example, a level controller would have
a level alarm low (LAL) for small deviations below the set point and level alarm low low (LALL)
for larger deviations. They can show up on the screen, and the LALL would be accompanied by
an audible alarm. In critical situations, two or three measurement devices may be provided, and
possibly with different underlying measurement techniques to protect from failures that may have
common modes. For example, a level sensor may become plugged and isolated from the process in
a failure scenario, so a different technology (i.e. capacitance switch or ultrasonic level) that would
resist the failure scenario might be used in addition to the level sensor.
Alarm management should be thought through. Too many alarms cause operators to lose focus.
Alarms for small deviations can interfere with alarms for more serious situations. The science of
alarm management in general has been studied and reported on.
An example of a tank level control is shown in Figures 7.7 and 7.8. On the right, a valve
is manipulated to control a flow rate out of the tank. On the left, a valve is manipulated to
maintain the level at its set point in the tank. The controllers for both loops are digital, with
analogue/digital converters interposed with the analogue signals from the measuring devices and
to the final control element (P&IDs often do not show the a/d converters because they are built
into modern transmitters or valves). The level control loop has high and high–high warnings, plus
a digital interlock (or a “trip”) to shut off the feed valve (left-hand valve) and keep the tank from
overflowing. The right-hand valve also has an interlock to keep the tank from running dry.
The warnings and interlock on the incoming flow are activated digitally within the level con￾troller (LIC). The interlock on the outgoing flow is hardwired using either the computers software
(shown) or analogue hardwired signals (not shown) which are either pneumatic or 4–20 mA
electrical or, in critical situations, both computer and hardwired. This avoids any computer delay
or computer malfunction.
In cases where there is no tolerance for uncertainty about the controlled variable, which could
happen if a single measuring element malfunctions, a second parallel measuring point can be
installed (Fig 7.8). However, if the indicators start to disagree there is no way to know which is
right. Hence, a third measuring point is added and the correct value of CV istaken according to the
two indications that agree. An even surer way to gain the “truth” is for the three measurements to
be made by different principles, so as to avoid common-cause errors. The severity of the situation
may require a separate isolation valve, and the signal from the level transmitters and the logic solver
for the voting system be built into a separate computer to ensure a reliable interlock system. The
reader is referred to the topic of Functional Safety, Safety Instrumented Systems, Safety Integrity
Level design in standards such as IEC 61508 and 61511, and Coleman (2020).
In spite of alarms and interlocks, unsafe conditions can still arise, sometimes suddenly, and they
may require relief flow from a vessel. Relief valves must be provided per the legal jurisdiction
the plant is located, and usually that means following ASME code requirements. The difficulties
around relief valves include:7.4 Process Reviews for Safety and Health 83
● Sizing them. The fluid which they must handle can be of varied composition – gas or vapor, vapor
and liquid, and liquid and solid. There are sizing methods for each of these combinations.
● Maintaining them so that they function at the rare time when needed.
● Handling the effluent.
● Predicting the effect on the rest of the process caused by their sudden action.
● Possibly designing a system of relief valves if relief is needed at different locations and different
design pressures in the process.
The process designer generally leaves the choice of the details of relief to a specialist or someone
with more experience.
Safety systems are sometimes summed up in a scheme called layers of protection, as shown in
Figure 7.9. The objective for the process designer is to build a process that never has to climb very
far up the ladder.
VanCamp (2016) discussed alarm management; Coleman (2020) discussed avoiding SIL (Safety
Integrity Level) misconceptions, and Schmidt (2007) discussed tolerable risk – the missing link to
complete risk assessments.
7.4 Process Reviews for Safety and Health
The process designer (or the process design team) is responsible for formulating a safe process, but
they then bring in a review team to assess and augment their work. This team should include
● the designers themselves,
● a facilitator,
● a control specialist,
● a mechanical or pipe specialist,

● one or more of the people who will operate the process.
The review may take several sessions and will require full wide-awake participation by all
participants. These people have tasks of their own, so there needs to be efficiency both at the
sessions and in providing documents and drawings (PFDs, P&IDs, and equipment drawings) for
preliminary study.
Ideally, a project would divide the review into phases. The first phase, occurring early in the
design, would examine the inherent hazards, such as the chemicals used, conditions present,
and the PFD. At this stage, significant design changes can be made with minimal (possibly7.5 Training and Operating Procedures (PSM #3, #2) 85
positive) impact on the schedule and project cost. Subsequent phases, featuring progressively
more engineering detail (e.g. P&ID and varying degrees of plant layout completion – even a cubic
3D model in the form of blocks is useful), can delve into the process in greater detail, but changes
will be at greater cost in budget and schedule impact the later the review is done. It is worth noting
that the plant’s location can influence the risk levels of some events, so having that information
available early on is useful.
Depending on the available information, different review formats might be suitable. The review
will adhere to a specific format, with potential methods including:
● what if questions,
● checklist,
● hazard and operability study (HAZOP),
● failure mode and analysis (FMEA),
● fault tree analysis (FTA), or
Bow Tie analysis, and
● Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA).
The “What if” scenario and the FMEA approach are similar, in that a failure of a component
(large orsmall)is postulated and the consequences are then thought through.It depends very much
on the experiences of the participants: What they have experienced themselves and what they have
observed over the course of their career. The FTA approach is in the opposite direction: A truly bad
occurrence is studied and the conditions that would lead up to it are identified.
The most common – and time-consuming – approach is the HAZOP. If the process is complex, it
is broken down into nodes and every aspect is examined:
flow, pressure, temperature, level, time (batch, start-up, shutdown, draining, venting,
inerting), agitation, reaction, utility failure, DCS failure, and vibrations.
The questions asked regarding flow, for instance, are the causes and effects of its being too high,
too low, not flowing at all, flowing in reverse, and being contaminated. Since most of the conditions
are unlikely but must be included, a HAZOP study can be quite extensive. However, it is the “gold
standard” as a review. An experienced facilitator will mix in a smattering of “What if” and FMEA
at crucial points in the process.
A scribe writes down the conclusions after the discussions on each issue. It will include action
items that arise. At the next session, the process designer(s) reports on what has been done for
each item or not done if they have, on reflection, come to the conclusion that the situation needs
no changes.
The review of processes is mandatory in the United States according to process safety manage￾ment. A lax review or an undocumented review leaves the designer and the company open to legal
proceedings if there is an accident. From the moral standpoint, a good process review is a must.
7.5 Training and Operating Procedures (PSM #3, #2)
These two activities generate a document, but those documents are greatly different in content and
style.
The Training Document has at its core the process description, set at a technical level between
process operators and engineers. It does not hurt operatorsto learn a little of chemical engineering,
and will enhance their familiarity and judgment in supervising the process.86 7 Design for Safety and Health
The documentshould also have a long-term mission by having added to it the design calculations
and any mathematical modeling. It will serve as the basis for future engineers to troubleshoot the
process and to change capacity or product type.
Operating procedures also require a document but of a different sort. It comprises step-by-step
procedures for start-up, normal shutdown, nonscheduled shutdown, emergency response to a
variety of occurrences, and normal supervision of the operation. This document needs to have
all physical elements of the process numbered and labeled, initially just on the P&IDs, and then
tagged on the equipment when built. It is a laborious task to prepare these instructions but is
essential to avoid having operators missing some crucial step.
7.6 Pre-Startup Safety and Health Review
Safety is always paramount. In the earlier part of this chapter, the objective was to build safety and
health into the design of the process. When the equipment is installed and ready to be started up,
the review is aimed at safe operation. There are obvious perils like tripping hazards or an electrical
panel with no cover. At a deeper level, the control personnel should check that the wiring from
device to device is properly connected, that measurement devices are sending plausible signals,
and that the final control elements are responding to signals.

Protecting the Environment
Protecting the environment is the logical off-site extension of protecting Safety and Health within
the plant.
Like safety and health, it has four aspects:
Morality Legality Technology Economics
Most ideally, the plant or process should have the least possible “footprint”:
● It should draw only the minimal required materials and energy to make the product.
● It should yield only the desired product and pure streams of side components like water and air.
The design and construction of a plant or process usually requires approval from regulatory
authorities, particularly if there are deviations from the ideal footprint. It is part of the process
designer’s responsibility to provide conditions and equipment to minimize deviations. A caution
is that environmental rules change with time, always to tighter standards, so the process designer
needs to consider jumping ahead of current rules. An example of this is the concept of a circular
economy which will require corporations to look at their products and processes in a new way
(Glavic 2021).
Many articles have been written on this topic. Savage (2009) asked “What does it mean to be
green?”; Anastas & Zimmerman (2003), Allen (2007), and Anonymous (2002) listed general prin￾ciples and approaches. Contreras & Bravo (2011) and Mendez (2007) have valuable suggestions.
Curran (2015) proposed the idea of a life cycle assessment in making decisions. Jenkins (2010)
cautioned that likely increases in carbon pricing should be factored into economics. Williams &
Dunwoody (2012) recommended the use of mathematical models to quantitatively design for
environmental protection. Ternes (2012) reviewed the intricacies of the regulatory process, and
Jennings (2008) provided a good background on the topic of climate change. Glavic (2021)
provided a review of process design and sustainable development in Europe. Other references are
Allen (2007), Anonymous (2002), Chin & Gillespie (2010), and Contreras & Bravo (2011).
The present chapter deals with the two aspects of the “footprint”:
1. Consumption: The use, by the plant or process, of material substances and of energy;
2. Emission: The emissions of substances other than the intended product.
The objective is to minimize all of these various flows.

8.1 Consumption
To the outside world, the main entities which a plant consumes are raw process materials, water,
air, and energy. The energy may appearin the form of delivered fuel orit may be direct as electricity
or water-powered. Minimization of these consumables often presents opportunities for savings in
operating costs, which of course have to be measured against capital cost to achieve.
The three components of consumption are now considered in turn.
8.1.1 Raw Materials
The very minimum amount of the principal raw materials is obtained from the reaction equation,
A → B (8.1)
whereAisthe raw material and B isthe desired product. However, two types of eventuality interfere
with this simple relationship.
One is the presence of another process, chemical or physical, so that a second consumption of A
occurs in parallel
A → B or A → B →→→
↘ C ↘ C (8.2)
Lab studies or pilot plantruns can identify the chemistry and hopefully identify conditions where
the parallel process is minimized. Assuming that the final product needs to be substantially free of
the co-product C, there may be loss of A or B in separating out component C. Capital spending will
likely be needed especially if the optimum temperature for best yield is low and requires a larger
process unit. Capital may also need to be spent in obtaining a clean separation of impurities.
The other is wastage of components A and B, as explained here. Potentially, one of the largest,
although intermittent, waste is at start-up, shutdown, and changes in the product type. Here
is where an unsteady-state mathematical model can help by identifying a time-wise transition
process path that keeps the product close to specification for as long as possible during transitions.
Figure 8.1 illustratessuch a transition. In this simple but illustrative case, it is desired to double the
concentration of component C in the outlet of the vessel. The quick action of a forced transition
is seen.

Cout

Figure 8.1 Forced transition.8.1 Consumption 89
In this case of a well-mixed holding tank, the outflow composition of component C is desired to
be doubled. This is done by doubling the composition of the inflow. If the inflow is just doubled,
then the outflow takes an exponential asymptotic increase to its new value, leaving a long period of
transition. However, if the inflow is tripled for a short period, the outflow achieves its desired new
value very quickly.
Transition waste may also be reduced or eliminated by adding holding vessels to the facility, to
which nonconforming product can be diverted during transition. It may be possible to gradually
blend this material back into the product stream when the transition is over. Holding tanks cost
money, but they are much prized by operating personnel to deal with upset conditions as well as
transitions.
8.1.2 Consumption of Water
Water is a ubiquitous material in most processes where substances are being consumed, trans￾formed, or produced. Muller et al. (2013) suggested optimization of energy use in cooling systems.
Willa (2005) suggested proper distribution in cooling towers. Schultz (2008) urged water reuse
and conservation. Sutikno (2007) and Tanthapanichakoon (2012) proposed energy savings around
steam generation.
Facilities are often situated near lakes and rivers or over aquifers. The supply may be plentiful,
but nevertheless application must be made to “take water”. Sometimes water is not so plentiful,
and it is required to recycle and reuse it within the process. These measures may also be necessary
to avoid hydraulic overload of the treatment system for water being returned to the environment.
Within-process reuse of water requires capital investment, so the cost/necessity will be examined
in process design.
Figure 8.2 summarizes the common paths of water within a plant.
The uses to which water is put dictate the sort of treatment which is applied.
1. Because its naturally occurring temperature is generally lower than process temperatures, it is
an excellent coolant. It is also an excellent heating medium in the form of steam. These two
applications are often the only ones in many processes. The separation between the water and
the process fluids keeps the water relatively contamination free. Treatment is needed only to
keep the water courses suspension-free and to minimize surface scaling. Treatment #1, on the
supply side, would likely be softening and filtration (at least to keep the fish out). Water purity is
especially important for uses in food processing and other human contact applications such as
cosmetics and bio/pharma or health-related industry, in electronics, and in feed to high-pressure

steam production. Process equipment metallurgy and process materials such as catalysts may
also be sensitive to water quality. Fortunately, there are companies that specialize in providing
water treatment and water quality services.
2. The RECYCLE loop shown with User #1 and Treatment #3 could represent a steam boiler and a
process unit, where the condensate from the process is used as the boiler feed water. Treatment
#3 isthe addition of anti-scaling, anticorrosion, and anti-bacteriological compoundsto maintain
levels obtained in Treatment #1.
3. The same RECYCLE loop could also represent cooling of the process followed by cooling of the
waterso that it can be used again. The lattertask commonly takes place in a cooling tower, where
air is used to partially vaporize and to thereby lower the water temperature. Hairston (2003)
discussed cooling towers, and Huchler (2016) suggested the measures to eliminate legionella
bacteria from cooling towers. Puckorius (2013) considered recycled water for cooling tower
makeup.
4. Treatment #4 represents the use of water outflow from one process unit as the feed for a
second, unlike, process unit. This is a very broad categorization depending on the properties
of the effluent and the acceptable requirements of the influent. The discrepancy may simply
be temperature, but could be impurities in the effluent. Some ways in which water is used and
may get contaminated (i.e. in Unit #1) are as a diluent or as a solvent in extraction. Techniques
for cleaning up this stream are suggested in the literature: chemical softening, reverse osmosis,
coagulation followed by ultrafiltration or RO, membrane filtration, oxidation, ozonation,
peroxidation, ultraviolet radiation, electrodialysis, ion exchange, heat, and biotreatment – the
choice depending on the nature of the objectionable substances to be reduced or eliminated.
Cost is also a factor.
Authors who have listed and described these techniques are Aerts & Tong (2009), Cartwright
(2006), Hairston (2003), Harfst (2010), Jenkins (2013, 2015), and Uribe et al. (2015). Harfst
particularly focused on nonchemical treatments.
5. Treatment #2 is the interface between the process and the world around. It must be effective
in order for the plant to legally operate. Some of the above techniques may form part, or all,
of “Treatment 2”, but the most common sequence is the mechanical separation of insoluble
impurities, followed by a biological digestion of soluble impurities. This operation is examined
in Section 8.2.2, where we also look at the other aspects of the process footprint. Zero discharge
plant practices are becoming the goal of operations.
The above considerations of use, recycle, reuse, and treatment could constitute a major
sub-design project in its own right. The complexity lends itself to mathematical modeling.
Cartwright (2006) identified three treatments of in-house water: to get it up to required quality
for use and to keep it there. Amminudin et al. (2008) and Durham & Patria (2006) recommended
a survey of existing water systems in a plant, in search of opportunities for improvement. Huchler
(1999) focused on getting a record of the use of utility water. Foo et al. (2006) suggested the appli￾cation of the techniques of pinch analysis. Nolen (2016) also suggested the application of energy
conservation principles to water conservation. Nystuen (2011) and Putra (2015) recommended
the integration of the treatment of wastewater with the conservation of water – that is the joint
consideration of the above four “treatments”. Pakzadeh & Zbacnik (2015) and Schultz (2008)
suggested incidental sources of water that may be acceptable, at least after some treatment or
“polishing”. Anonymous (2015B) looked for sustainability. Parkinson (2005) suggested about
getting the most out of water. Da Silva & Goodman (2014) were helpful. Durham & Patria
(2006) showed that wastewater can sometimes be a reliable source. Frenkel (2002) discussed the8.1 Consumption 91
pretreatment of water. Harfst (2010) and Jenkins (2013) discussed the nonchemical treatment
of water. Jenkins (2015) covered water treatment technologies in general, and Jenkins (2020)
suggested about the use of ion-exchange resins. Dalan (2000) provided advice on zero liquid
discharge design. Uribe et al. (2015) listed advanced technologies for water treatment and reuse.
The manufacturer applies to the regulatory body for permission to establish these flows. They
receive either acceptance or a set of requirements to reduce or alter the streams. Generally, there
are negotiations between the partiesto arrive at a path forward which is environmentally acceptable
and minimally costly and with an eye to future tightening of regulations.
8.1.3 Consumption of Energy
The two energy streams that feed most plants are fuel (natural gas as opposed to oil or coal) and
electricity. The formeris used forthe generation of heat, the latterfor powering mechanical devices.
Electricity is too expensive to be degraded into heat, except in some specific cases where the load
is small or high temperature is needed, or where it is awkward to use a heating fluid.
Natural gas is often compared unfavorably with electricity because of its carbon dioxide com￾bustion product, although it is the least CO2 producer of all the fossil fuels. However, electricity
also has some social flaws in its production. It may come from innocuous sources like isolated
hydroelectric sites or from nuclear reactors. However, it may also come from a fossil-fuel burning
generating station or a hydroelectric site that despoils the land around where people live.
The starting point is best to distinguish the above distinction between sources, i.e., natural gas
and electricity and to look for waysto transfer energy from one to the other where there is otherwise
going to be wastage.
Alternative sources of energy could be explored. Wood chips and the remains of dead trees have
been studied. A small nuclearreactorseems daunting but may become practical and manageable in
the nearfuture: SMRs(Small Modular Reactors) in the range of around 300 MW (see Figure 8.6) are
being developed. Geothermal heating is also coming to the fore, although that possibility depends
on the siting of the plant and what lies beneath it. Unfortunately, the surroundings around the
installation become exhausted of heat because of slow diffusivity of heat in the soil.
Many of the referred articles assume that a plant already exists and can be explored for energy
savings. Some general references are Rossiter (2006), Hardin (2007), Harrison (2008), Chin &
Gillespie (2010), Elshout & Marchant (2010), Rossiter & Venkatesan (2012), Reddy et al. (2013),
Scheihing (2014), Rossiter & Davis Jr (2014), Blume (2014), Scheihing (2014), Rossiter & Jones
(2014), Rossiter (2015A–C), Rossiter (2015A), and Anonymous (2015A). There are a multitude
of suggestions – some major but mostly minor, which do add up. These references show the
process designer what the final plant might look like. For an existing plant, Griesbach et al. (2013)
recommended conducting an energy design review. Any of these concepts could form part of the
predesign planning, and a mock audit could be done during a HAZOP review.
Among the suggestions are those that indicate measurement devices that will help in reducing
the energy load. Some of the devices are as follows:
● Sampling of exhaust gases from fossil-fuel combustion (e.g. combustibles, carbon monoxide and
nitrogen oxides) to ensure that the combustion process is as complete as possible.
● Characterization of streams, by way of measuring flow, of sampling for contents and
concentration – preferably with quick online measurements such as gas chromatographs.
● Provision for passing information to online optimizing computers.
Fully implementing all of these devices may be controversial to the funders of the project, so
at a minimum the sampling and measure points should be installed and plugged off until further92 8 Protecting the Environment
equipment is eventually bought. This all requires planning for the final state. Some references for
in-plant information and automation are White (2010), Blume (2014), and Parisi et al. (2015).
The general objective is to fully use the heating value of the fuel [see Axon (2009)] and to
recover waste heat. Recovery may be simply transferring heat from a hot waste source into
a lower-temperature useful stream – perhaps for domestic and comfort use within the plant.
This application requires efficient transfer of heat. An article, Anonymous (2015A), described a
commercial device the Compabloc heat exchanger by Alfa Laval. It is claimed that it can provide
3–5 times the rate of standard devices and is also easy to keep clean.
Reddy et al. (2013) reviewed the opportunities and methods of waste heat recovery. Labrecque &
Kiari (2006) also provided suggestions. Flue gases are a likely source, see Bourji et al. (2010).
One use for waste heat is to run turbines for the production of electricity. This may mean the
purchase of turbines solely for this purpose, see Ganapathy (2009) and Kaupert et al. (2015).
Obviously, the saving of a particular amount of energy must be sufficient to justify the capital
expense. The operation is governed, in the abstract, by the Rankin Cycle. Bourji & Winstead (2013)
described a Rankin Cycle based on an organic liquid of higher volatility than water, to which the
waste heat has been transferred and which causes it to vaporize.
A combined cycle gas turbine uses hot combustion gas to generate electricity and continuously
followsit up with the transfer of heat from the exit gasinto steam, which powers another generator.
Many plants have installed, or are installing, cogeneration facilities. As described in the literature,
a common heat source drives the production of steam, some of which is immediately applied to
electricity-producing equipment or other rotating machinery. Claims for the conversion of incom￾ing fuel energy into plant-useful energy can be as high as 85%. This can be much higher than if the
two operations were done separately.
The objective is to wring as much useful energy as possible out of whatever fuel is expended.
Some other pointers may be useful. Add heat only when it needs to be added. In general, proper
instrumentation will tell that. If a vessel is to supply a hot fluid, there is no use of heating the
whole vessel; rather heat the outflow as it emerges. Both heating and cooling require energy: use
“pinch” or other methods to transfer heat between streams; however, start-up and shutdown, as
well as process operation dependencies, require careful thought in a system with heat integration.
Remember that energy can constitute a major operating expense, especially in jurisdictions where
electricity is expensive.
8.2 Emission of Waste
This is the other facet of plant footprint, the uncalled-for, unwanted emission of extraneous
substances into the public domain. It is also the area where the plant may get into trouble, so
requires attention early in the design phase. Regulators may lack urgency of action, so can hold
up approval or plant start-up. Four areas are looked at here (noise is not considered here, but can
be an issue, and it is regulated in jurisdictions):
● liquid waste,
● gaseous waste,
● solid waste, and
● carbon dioxide and other climate-affecting substances.
Raaphorst (1998), Lad (2002), Jones & Rankin (2015), Shah (2016), and Shah (2016) alerted
managers and process designers to the strict mandates around this topic. Powell (2008) presented8.2 Emission of Waste 93
“best practices”, a guide to managers and technical personnel. Emissions monitoring is insisted
by regulators, see Malosh (2008). Siegell (2010) suggested auditing emissions inventory. Moftah
(2000), Reinemann (2006), and Khaqan (2011) recommended statistical assistance in getting
the data. Neimeier (2004) recognized that emissions testing costs money, so get the most from
tests. Scheier (2001) focused on completeness in assessing the potential to emit. Schuster (2015)
reminded that what we can measure, we can improve. Ulrich (2007)stressed considering pollution
control during the design phase. White (2010) recommended generous use of automation.
Provision for dealing with waste is highly specialized and not merely considered as a typical part
of process design. There is too much at stake and too many options that require specialized help.
8.2.1 Dealing with Liquid Waste
A chemical plant or a plant using chemicals to produce materials is bound to have significant
liquid waste. This waste could be a concentrated nonaqueous substance, which would require a
specialized company to haul it away and dispose of it. Losing such a stream could be costly, so
a process would undoubtedly be examined to avoid or minimize the loss. See Mueller & Cipullo
(2008).
Very typically, this waste is in dilute form as part of an aqueous stream. The object is to remove
the contaminant from the stream, so that water can be sent back into the environment often first
through a public wastewater system. This problem is discussed here.
The general topic of wastewater was discussed by Gucciardi (2003) and Doble & Geetha (2011).
Huchler (2010) explained the essential step of obtaining a permit to emit water. Putra (2015)
suggested improvements for wastewater plants.
8.2.1.1 Biological Treatment of Wastewater
With regard to technology, the activated sludge process is the most-used process, being based on
the remarkable ability of certain microorganisms to grow by extracting organic materials and
biodegradable compounds from water. Information on this process is contained in Carson (2002),
Kleerebezem & Macarie (2003), Schultz (2005), Cartwright (2006), Doble (2006), Marshall (2007),
and Sustarsic (2009). This process was devised in the early 1900s in England, and various forms
have been implemented worldwide.
Most activated sludge processes operate with oxygen (usually air-oxygen) assisting in bringing
about the chemistry of assimilation. This need depends on the particular microorganisms. The
physical form is for the organisms to be suspended and swirled in the wastewater. Two references
give a good picture of this aerobic process: Sustaric (see above) and Ataei (2010). The other detail
which makesthis process possible isthe clumping together of the organisms,so the Arntsen at they
separate out after the absorption.
Figure 8.3 shows schematically how a suspended-solid aerobic system operates. Some of the
peripherals are included, including a holding tank for containing water resulting from unusual
conditions that might upset the treatment system.
The aeration tank is the heart, with agitation of some sort keeping the solid flocs of organisms in
suspension and also entraining and distributing the oxygen. The physical mixture continually flows
out of the aeration tank into the clarifier, where the microorganism flocs settle out as sludge. Part
is sent to sludge disposal; the rest is recycled back to the aeration tank to maintain concentration.
A key consideration is the mutual dependence of the organisms and the water, i.e., there must be
sufficient contamination in the water to feed the hungry “bugs”. If the water feed is cut off or drops
to a low content, then supplemental feed must be administered.94 8 Protecting the Environment

A variant of the process is to conduct it without oxygen. Again, this possibility depends on the
particular combinations of microorganisms and water contamination. Kleerebezem and Macarie
(see above) explained this process, giving its advantages and weaknesses. Marshall (2007) pre￾sented a list of contaminants that lend themselves to anaerobic treatment. A third variation, anoxic
low-oxygen condition is a possibility. In general, the omission of oxygen makes the process less
expensive to operate, energy-wise.
The above distinctions apply to oxygen use. A second distinction applies to the form of the
microorganisms. Instead of being on the loose in the wastewater, they are attached to, and grow
on, solid surfaces, which may be fixed or may float about in the waste. These reactors are referred
to as biofilm. A fixed bed of such surfaces is known as a trickling filter. Flocs do break loose from
the solid surfaces but not to the extent that they need recycling back to the aeration tank. The
gases from anaerobic processes may be combustible (unlike the CO2 from aerobic processes)
and could be tapped for energy. Gas from solid landfill may also be combustible and only needs
trapping.
A very instructive account of the use of the two configurations, biofilm and suspended solid, in
tandem with each other is given by An (2013). The biofilm in this case was contained on wafers,
which floated in suspension, so that the process was called MBBR – Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor.
8.2.1.2 Other Treatments of Wastewater
Wastewater may contain components unsuitable for bio treatment, which need to be removed
independently. Such are volatile components (VOCs) in significant amounts. Zygula (2008)
presented a trayed steam-stripping column, where contaminated water enters at the top, flows
downward, and is met by steam flowing upward. With proper design the steam carries VOCs
up and out of the device. Stripped water flows out the bottom for release or for a further type of
treatment. The top stream contains the VOCs along with some steam, all of which is condensed
and disposed of. It may be partially funneled back to the plant process. The optimal pressure for
such a system is close to atmospheric.
Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is a process for floating solid material out of water, typically flocs of
microorganisms out of bio treatment sludge. Water, flowing upstream, deposits solids near the top
where they are withdrawn. The water flows back down a parallel channel where it is withdrawn.
This process is described by Vlyssides et al. (2006). Carson (2002) provided tips on the handling
of sludge.8.2 Emission of Waste 95
Carr & Vaughn (2003) alerted to the efficacy of activated carbon in many applications. It has
very high absorption powers and, for instance, is good at removing such heavy metals as arsenic,
cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury. Other absorbents are zeolites and other molecularsieves.
Vardhan et al. (2019) suggested heavy-metal pollution and remedial measures.
An objective of zero liquid discharge has been adopted by some enterprises. Dalan (2000) and
Shaw & Brosdal (2008) advised on how to approach this happy state. Evaporation and possibly
crystallization are useful.
Ataei (2010) showed that wastewater treatment can present energy-conservation opportunities.
Sometimesthe contamination isin the form of ground water. Beal & Faircloth (2002) and Adams
et al. (2006) discussed ISB, in situ bio remediation for cleaning up this form of pollution.
Arntsen (2020) described a recent installation where membrane filtration is used to clean up a
stream prior to aerobic treatment.
8.2.2 Dealing with Gaseous Waste
Again, this is a specialized area of design and not to be approached without engaging specialists.
The objective isto reduceVOCs(volatile organic compounds), HAPs(hazardous air pollutantssuch
as sulfur dioxide, benzene, perchloroethylene, methylene chloride, and a whole host of others),
NOx (nitrogen oxides), and carbon monoxide to permissible levels for emission from the plant.
This often meansreducing them by 99%. An overallsurvey of methodsis provided by Moretti (2002)
and Karell (2013). These methods are discussed in general terms here. Moretti provided a map of
methods suitable for different conditions.
Treatment of waste gas streams is often referred to as “end of pipe”. A better alternative is to
modify the process or procedures so that these contaminants do not show up at the end of the pipe
or are at least minimized. That sort of development may have too long a time frame for the project
at hand. Buchanan (2007) helped with the efficiency of air pollution control devices. Gendron et al.
(2004) discussed perimeter air-monitoring programs.
8.2.2.1 Thermal Oxidation and Thermal Catalytic Oxidation
This group of methods is very aggressive and effective for most waste gas impurities.
Air is used to combust with the unwanted components and convert them into the innocuous
products water and CO2. References are Klobucar (2002), Venkatesh & Woodhull (2003), Mack
(2003), Blocki (2005), Goldshmid (2005), Sims (2007), Baranski & Underwood (2014), and
Armstrong & Predatsch (2019). Baranski & Underwood (2014) specifically discussed the catalytic
approach. Goldshmid is particularly useful in providing a map of which oxidizer is suitable for
combinations of waste flow and waste concentration.
The simplest version isthe direct-flame thermal oxidizer.It consists of three parts: a burner, which
mixes air plus gas plus a fuel such as methane, a mixing zone, and a retention zone for complete
combustion. It is flexible relative to flow rates and composition, but expensive to operate because
of the need for fuel.
The recuperative thermal oxidizer conveys the heat generated by the combustion of impurities to
heat and boil other streams. The heat exchangers are an essential part of the device, but there may
be flexibility in their design.
The regenerative thermal oxidizer contains within itself two or more beds of ceramic media to
alternatively store and then release the heat. The flow is cycled back and forth. Three beds are
often used for smoother operation and can give heat recovery of typically 93–97%. Essentially, the96 8 Protecting the Environment
heat is transferred to the incoming waste gas which passes through the bed on its way to combine
with air.
Generally, no additional heat (i.e. natural gas) is needed. Recuperative and regenerative systems
are obviously less expensive to operate, but they cost more. Some typical temperatures are
850–1050 ∘C. Destruction efficiency (DE) of contaminants can be 90%, even as high as 99.5,
hopefully enough to satisfy regulators.
Catalysts for oxidation are also used (as in motor vehicles) and are also shown in Figure 8.4.
There is a reduction in temperature requirement of 100–200 ∘C, although if part of the contam￾ination is halogenated, that requires more temperature. There are the usual difficulties with beds,
e.g., “blinding” with particles, poisoning with sulfur, silicon, arsenic, phosphorus, and the periodic
need for refurbishing the bed. The catalyst may be a precious metal, e.g., palladium or platinum,
or a metal oxide (e.g. vanadium or titanium), and it may be in the form of a monolith or a packed
bed. Sims (2007) discussed minimization of particle interference.
Figure 8.5 shows the concept of the two cycles of the regenerative oxidizer. It is controlled by the
action of the valves. In the diagram, the closed valves are shown in black. The arrows show where
flow takes place. The heat recovery in this device is probably the best that can be had.
Figure 8.5 shows the cycles of the regenerative oxidizer. Combustion gases are cooled; waste
stream is heated. This is all internal and an integral part of the system. The switch is made
automatically through valves that are alternatively open and closed. The valves that are closed
are shown in black in the diagram. Needless to say, such high-frequency high-temperature valves
must be of good quality and leak-proof.
Some quantitative characteristics are that total residence time in the combusters is generally
0.75–2 seconds. A flow of gaseous waste is typically 1000 scfm, with 5000 being considered high.
A volumetric concentration of 10 ppm is considered low. A rotary concentrator, as described by
Herraiz et al. (2020), may be used to increase concentration before thermal or other treatment.
That application is for CO2 but can apply to other gases. Moretti (2002) claimed a 1000 : 1
concentrating is possible.

Finally, the option of thermal oxidation is effective but extreme. The high temperatures are haz￾ardous to personnel and a source of fire. A flame arrester is sometimes installed on the hot waste
gas before combustion since the gas may be a collection from various sources some of which would
be compromised by blowback. A safety rule is that the waste stream be maintained at 25% or less
of its LEL, lower explosive limit.
8.2.2.2 Other Treatments for Waste Gases
Moretti (2002) is a good source of alternatives (along with thermal oxidation) for dealing more
mildly with gaseous emissions. These are described here.
1. Adsorption: The adsorbing material is one of the known substances with affinity for organics,
i.e., activated carbon, zeolites, or polymeric adsorbents. Two or more beds are needed so that
gas can be directed through a clean one, while the other(s) are cleaned. Efficiency is claimed up
to 95%.
2. Absorption: The waste gas stream is scrubbed with a suitable solvent – often just water, or
mineral oils, or other nonvolatile petroleum oils. Of course, the contaminant must be soluble.
The solvent plus contaminant must be continuously separated so that the solvent can be reused
and the contaminant can be sent for further treatment or back into the plant process.
3. Condensation: Low temperature is generally used. Along with its beneficial action, the
scrubbant must undergo cleanup, whether continuous or periodic, which still leaves the CO2
on hand, to be disposed of.
4. Flares: Liquids are rigorously kept out of the stack in orderto keep hot burning particulatesfrom
falling on people or on the ground. A flame arrester prevents blowback, especially if feed to the
flare falls too low. Bader et al. (2011) advised on selecting the proper flare systems.
5. Biofiltration: The filter bed may consist of natural materials (e.g. compost, soil, or bark),
supporting and nourishing microorganisms that ingest contaminants. The system must be98 8 Protecting the Environment
continuously kept wetted. Contaminants that contain oxygen, such as aldehydes, ketones,
alcohols, ethers, esters, and organic acids, are good candidates. Such filters have surprisingly
long lives – in years.
6. Membranes: A solvent dissolves and carries in the waste gas, which then permeates the mem￾brane, leaving the contaminant up to 20 times more concentrated than the original feed. This
makes it more easy to dispose of, whether treated or returned partially to the plant process.
Startin & Elliott (2009) suggested controlling emissions with ceramic filters.
8.2.3 Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)
The term nitrogen oxides incorporates a collection of compounds containing the nitrogen–oxygen
link. Most of the emissions accompany combustion, i.e., from burners and smoke stacks. Another
source can be the emission from thermal oxidizers. NOx is a source of smog, especially in
geographical terrains that allow this unhealthy nuisance to develop. The necessity to control NOx
is especially concentrated in vicinities of high population.
The production mechanism and rate of production of nitrogen oxides are still being studied.
McGowan (2004) suggested that the predominant mechanism is described by the Zeldovich
equation:
N2 + O → NO + N
N + O2 → NO + O
Rate of NOx formation = A [N2] ∫
t
0
exp(−b∕T)[O2] d𝜃 (8.3)
Consequently, the objective is to keep temperature low and excess oxygen low as well. The latter
requirement runs into the need to use excessive oxygen to gain complete consumption of fuel.
A well-instrumented combuster, especially if it includes quick or online analysis, can optimize the
balance between the two needs.
Anonymous (2020B) deals with NOx absorption. NOx emissions and their reduction are
discussed by McGowan (2004), Dakshinamoorthy (2009), and Colannino (2020). Colannino listed
9 (!) measures to alleviate NOx emissions, of which one is to stage the adding of fuel and air in
boilers, to keep both temperature and oxygen low.
8.2.4 Fugitive Emissions
The many valves and seals around chemical plants all have the potential to leak vaporized process
fluids and unwanted contaminants into the surrounding. Parkinson (2007), Adkins & Ehlers
(2008), Drago (2010), Wilwerding (2011), and Khiani (2017) wrote about this difficulty. Some of
these references actually discuss the making and characteristics of a low-leak valve. Others detail
the interaction of regulators (e.g. the EPA in the United States) with commercial plants – with
everyone having a common goal. A 2008 estimate is that global fugitive emissions are greater than
one million metric tons per year.
Much of the discussion has to do with measuring emissions. The original procedure had
personnel taking “sniffer” samples around points of possible leakage, generally around valves, of
which there are many in a chemical plant. Valves are estimated to cause 65% of fugitive emissions.
This plan was very costly in people effort. Over the years, the techniques of image analysis have
been worked upon, in which scanning can reveal the extent and composition of leakage. However,8.2 Emission of Waste 99
the goal of LDAR – leak detection and repair – is always underlying. A fixed-mounted scanner can
monitor a range of potential leak points and can alert if an adverse event occurs.
A vacuum system also has the potential for fugitive emissions, as explained by Peress (2002).
None of these measures have anything to do with internal flow past a valve when it is closed,
which is a plant problem.
8.2.5 Odors
Odors may seem like a minor problem among other technical challenges, but residents outside
the plant will not long put up with the nuisance; and rightly so, even if the plant pre-dated their
moving in. If ignored by the company, the problem gets referred to the political sphere and soon
a restraining order and plant shutdown occur. In some jurisdictions, odor is actually considered a
pollutant.
Neuman (1999), Tetley (2002), and Gans (2006) considered the problem. The consensus is that
dilution along with mixing technology can be effective.
8.2.6 Greenhouse Gases
This is a situation when The Tragedy of the Commons could take place, where a commonly owned
domain is exploited solely forlocal interests and eventually despoiled. Thatsituation does notseem
to be the case with greenhouse gases and climate change, and those considerations are slowly rising
to the top of human concerns. Reducing the emission of greenhouse gases will become the future
dominant mandate, both for nations and for industries.
The measurestaken by governments are obviously of interest to citizens, but measuresthat could
be taken by industry are the focus for the process designer. Here, we look at some remedial mea￾sures, as well as the details of reporting.
Other discussions of greenhouse gas control or mitigation are given by Parisi et al.(2015), Sullivan
& Oliva (2007), Princiotta (2007), Jennings (2008), and Balicka (2018).
8.2.6.1 Carbon Dioxide
While CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas – there are many, including water and methane, itssteady
release to the atmosphere is commonly seen as driving climate change. Reduction of CO2 is the
number one objective. Methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas but is not as ubiquitous
and is being dealt with separately. Water, with its heat-trapping action, is essential to keeping the
planet warm enough for human habitation.
The single forward step for a plant is to use, as a fuel, natural gas – this to replace coal or oil. It
is only an intermediate step because burning still generates carbon dioxide. Comparison of fuels
shows that emissions of CO2, in pounds per million btu’s of heat, are
anthracite coal 228.6
diesel and heating oil 161.3
natural gas 117.0
Natural gas has many different compositions depending on its source, but generally contains
methane at 75% or more, with hydrocarbons up to C5 and higher hydrocarbons making up the rest.
Impurities such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, and water also subsist.100 8 Protecting the Environment
Until an adequate alternative source of energy is developed, industry is stuck with reducing CO2
emissions. Axon (2009) offered suggestions on improving the combustion system efficiency.
One measure isto extract as much energy as possible from the burning of natural gas. A combined
cycle was alluded to in the conservation of energy (Section 8.1.2). A combined cycle gasturbine uses
hot burning combustion gas to generate electricity and continuously follows it up with the transfer
of heat from the exit gas into steam, which powers another generator. The hot wastewater or steam
from the steam turbine can be further used.
The topic of using condensing economizers for added heat recovery from flue gas frequently
arises. Although there is often reluctance to adopt this method due to concerns about corrosion
and equipment lifespan, there have been successful implementations of the technology. Thus, the
energy value of the natural gas is almost fully used. However, this will still not bring about the
major reduction in carbon dioxide emission that is sought.
8.2.6.2 Alternative Sources of Energy
Carbon dioxide is generated within a plant when natural gas is burned for heat or for powering gas
turbines, and outside the plant as part of the mix in the generation of electricity. Obviously NG, for
all its low-CO2 propensity, must eventually be replaced or dealt with. The technologies are being
developed, and a company or plant might want to work with a promising and pertinent developer
to accelerate and test new methods.
Here are some current suggestions.
1. Symbolic: Install racks of solar panels on the sunny side of the plant; install small windmills on
the windy side of the plant; plant CO2-absorbing trees all around. Even taken together, these
actions will likely come nowhere close to canceling out the detrimental emissions. What they
do is to advertise to the neighbors and the world that this plant takes climate change seriously.
This is a contribution to the world effort. Since it costs capital funds to do this, the power from
the panels and windmills could be sold to the grid for income.
2. Geothermal: When one looks at the heat and energy in the earth’s core, it appears that it would
more than satisfy our consumption on the surface forever – without carbon dioxide. Two factors
militate against this drawing up of the energy:
(1) access must be made far under the earth (say, 10 km) to get at the hot spots;
(2) the ground around the equipment (e.g. piping) gradually loses its temperature which takes
a long time to recover due to the poor thermal conductivity of the soil.
Typically, in continentalregions, in the first 3–5 km down, the geothermal gradient is 25 ∘C km−1.
However, the plant buildershould check on his/her own particularsite, which may have a more
favorable gradient. At the very least, there may be opportunities for heat pumping. Geothermal
to Rankin Cycle electrical generators typically convert about 11% of the geothermal heat to
electricity; thus, the symbiotic use of low temperature heat is often investigated along with the
generation of electricity in these systems.
Plants often buy up large amounts of land around them, partly forfuture expansion and partly to
keep odor-sensitive and noise-sensitive neighbors at bay. Geothermal stations thrive on lateral
separation,so they could be established around the property. The whole system could be phased
in, with new wells being dug or deepened, until a truly new meaningful energy stream was
built up.
3. Carbon capture and utilization: This approach, because of its expense, is more suited to major
CO2 emitters, like gas turbine power plants. It is not a popular concept since it stores but does
not eliminate CO2. Carbon dioxide is captured by a solvent, typically a methyl amine, although8.2 Emission of Waste 101
more effective solvents are being sought. The solvent must give up its capture since it needsto be
used again. And so there is the carbon dioxide, although now in a purer form that may enhance
its usefulness. Anonymous (2020A) discussed carbon capture.
A more acceptable term is CCUS, where the “U” stands for utilization. Unfortunately, the pro￾duction of carbon dioxide greatly exceeds its needs. If the plant location is anywhere near an
oil field, then some CO2 can be used for Enhanced Oil Recovery, EOR. There are many studies
where carbon dioxide can form a useful, stable combination with other materials. Because it is
at the bottom of the energy chain, it is hard to turn it into anything useful.
4. Burning of on-surface natural products: A fortuitous combination may be a plant near a dead or
dying forest or other natural product that could fuel a boiler. Since the natural decomposition
of the wood would release CO2 over the near time, burning it just accelerates the eventuality.
5. Small-module nuclear reactor: The few, rather disastrous accidents with large nuclear stations
have dampened the enthusiasm for this form of power. However, it is such an effective solution
to the CO2 problem that it is resurging. For plant applications, there is much development of
small reactors. For instance, a 15-MW reactor is under development for remote communities,
and there are many more developments, bigger or smaller. The use of nuclear power may be
daunting, but it is a technology that can be learned. The new reactors have enhanced safety
features. Many people are turning in this direction. The negatives of this technology are well
recognized and are being worked on: disposal of waste fuel, need for recharging, and shutdown
during overheating.

8.2.7 Auditing and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases (GHG)
Regulators are requiring reports on GHG emissions, although not necessarily forcing reductions.
Wintergreen & Sandler (2004), Ritter et al. (2005), and Baranski & Ternes(2010) advised on prepar￾ing such reports, and they described “the monitoring plan as a living document that, at a minimum,
describes
● the calculation methods that will be used for reporting GHG emissions
● the data required for those calculations
● the data-gathering equipment’s calibration, maintenance, and repair procedures
● the party who will be responsible for gathering each data component”.
Consistency is key here, with details differing from plant to plant.
8.2.8 Handling of Solid Waste
Solid-waste disposal methods vary depending on local regulations, environmental considerations,
and available infrastructure. Here are some common methods for disposing of solid waste:
1. Recycling: Recycling involves collecting and processing materials like paper, plastics, glass,
and metals to manufacture new products. Recycling helps reduce the volume of solid waste
and conserves resources.
2. Hazardous waste disposal through contracting: Handling and disposing of hazardous wastes,
such as chemicals and toxic materials, require specialized methods to protect both people and
the environment. In cases where specific expertise is needed, or due to scale and other con￾siderations, it is often prudent to contract this task to qualified companies. These firms may
employ methods like incineration, secure landfilling, or other specialized treatments.
3. Landfilling: This is one of the most common methods worldwide. Solid waste is buried in
designated landfill areas. Landfills are engineered to minimize environmental impact and
control leachate and gas emissions. However, landfills can still contribute to environmental
problems if not properly managed.
4. Sanitary landfilling: This is an engineered landfill with measures to minimize environmental
impacts, including leachate collection systems and gas extraction. While both landfilling and
sanitary landfilling involve burying solid waste, the key difference is the level of engineering
and environmental safeguards in place to protect the environment and public health. Sanitary
landfills are considered a more advanced and environmentally responsible form of landfilling
compared to traditional landfills.
5. Composting: Organic waste like food scraps and yard waste can be composted, turning it into
nutrient-rich soil conditioner. Composting reduces waste and enriches soil.
6. Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT): MBT combines mechanical sorting and biological
treatment (composting or anaerobic digestion) to process mixed waste streams.
7. Bioremediation: This method uses microorganismsto break down or detoxify hazardous waste
in soil and water.
8. Incineration: This method involves burning solid waste at high temperatures, with air or
oxygen to reduce its volume and convert it into ash, flue gas, and heat energy. Modern
incinerators are equipped with emission control systems to minimize air pollution. Energy
can also be recovered from the process.
9. Pyrolysis and gasification: These are advanced thermal treatment methods that operate in the
absence of oxygen (or with limited oxygen). They break down the waste into syngas (a mixture
of hydrogen and carbon monoxide), char, and other byproducts.References 103
10. Waste-to-Energy (WtE): Some facilities use waste as a fuel to generate electricity or heat. This
method reduces the volume of waste and produces energy.
11. Dumping and open burning: These are informal and often illegal methods used in some areas,
particularly in regions with limited waste management infrastructure. These methods can be
harmful to the environment and public health.
The choice of disposal method depends on factors like waste composition, local regulations,
environmental concerns, and available resources. Many places are shifting toward waste reduction,
recycling, and sustainable waste management practices to minimize the environmental impact of
waste disposal.

Capital Cost Estimating and Economic Analysis
Most chemical engineers are familiar with and have utilized some form of factored equipment esti￾mate (FEE) method and economics in the undergraduate capstone design courses. This chapter is
for those who want to expand on what was taught at school in a way that will help them under￾stand and create better estimates. The referencessection containsthe originalsources of estimating
procedures, some quite old, but well worth obtaining and reading.
This chapter supports engineers and others in developing capital cost (CAPEX) estimates and
the project economic analysis for the front-end stage gate decisions.
9.1 What Is an Estimate
When we say an estimate, we usually mean a capital project estimate, the dollar figure represent￾ing the total cost for engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning of a chemical
plant. It is also known as the project CAPEX, or the depreciable asset value when it includes the
owner-associated project costs. The estimate will have a stated accuracy range and a date the esti￾mate was prepared. Along with the estimate values are several supporting documents explaining
the basis for the estimate, the most important being the scope of work. The scope explains in
words what the proposed project will provide and explains assumptions, inclusions, exemptions,
and details that the numbers in the estimate cannot. Depending on the type of estimate, differ￾ing amounts of engineering will be required, resulting in a collection of engineering documents to
show the design basis and details.
A CAPEX estimate contains a list of items that fit into the following categories:
1. Direct costs: All costs that are directly attributed to installing equipment. This includes the
equipment, bulk materials (piping, valves, and instruments), and labor to install this. It also
includes what is known as “Off-sites” which includes pipe racks, rail spurs, and utility facilities
such as waste water, steam boilers, and so forth.
2. Indirect costs: This category includes costs that are spread across many pieces of equipment,
such as engineering, freight, insurance, overhead, and construction supervision.
3. Contingency, allowance, fees, etc.: This includes those items, the first fill of the plant, taxes,
duties, and escalation.

9.2 Why Estimate
Chapter 10 describes the business steps of bringing a new chemical product from discovery to final
product launch. Section 10.5 and Figure 10.5 illustrate how the estimates fit within the project exe￾cution framework for a typical chemical engineering project. Section 10.6 delves into the front-end
engineering in further detail. In the context of a stage gate review process, each gate typically cul￾minates with an estimate review as part of the decision-making process to continue.
There are numerous reasons why an estimate is needed in a project, and understanding why
you are preparing an estimate is key to understanding how much effort must be put into the task.
Estimates and the subsequent economics analysis support that business process by providing
insight into the financial implications and risks of the project at regular intervals. However,
estimates cost money, not just in preparing the cost values but in the engineering that leads to
those values. Thus, there are numerous approaches tailored to minimizing the effort costs while
providing a required level of accuracy (Lagace 2006).
A stage gate business processissaid to reduce the overall cost of innovation of a company by stop￾ping projects that are uneconomical before significant engineering costs are wasted on a dead-end
design. This chapter is intended to help a person understand the deliverables and steps involved
in developing the capital and operating costs (OPEX) for a design and making economic decisions
through various stage gates. Later in the life of a project, the “detailed” estimate is used to moni￾tor and control the construction so that overruns in cost and time can be identified and possibly
avoided before they become serious obstructions.
9.3 The What and Why of Economic Analysis
Economic analysis is one aspect of deciding whether to approve and continue with a project.
The analysis utilizes the capital estimate and adds the OPEX to determine the cost of manufactur￾ing a product. If revenues are available, they can be added, and a year-over-year analysis of cash
inputs and outputs can be built to provide a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. Subsequently,
the following metrics can be developed: payback period, net present value (NPV), ROR (Rate of
Return), IRR (Internal Rate of Return), and others which support decisions to:
● continue, recycle, or discontinue a project based on corporate benchmarks;
● compare other investments more easily for ranking and prioritization;
● include projections in forward-looking business documents, such as forecasts of future earnings;
● assess the factors contributing to economic risks in the project;
● employ Monte Carlo analysis methods to estimate probabilities for a range of values.
Above is the usual understanding and use of DCF analysis regarding project approval.
Christensen (2008) presented an alternate approach to project approval. The premise he states is
that the stage gate process is flawed, that conventional DCF analysis methods require assumptions
that can be intentionally, or unintendedly, biased in a way that would mislead decision-makers. His
solution is called “discovery-driven planning”, and it is to work backward to find the assumptions
that must be met to achieve the necessary financial hurdles. He refers to this as a reverse income
statement. The method determinesthe most important assumptionsin ensuring a project’ssuccess
and works toward ensuring their success. A checklist can be used to help. The team “revises its
strategy until assumptions are all plausible. If no set of plausible assumptions will support the case
for success, the project is killed”. Regardless of the approach, many of the tools require working
with an economic analysis.9.5 Estimate Types and Methods 111

9.4 A Process Engineer’s Role in Estimating
In smaller projects, or ones that are very early in development, the process engineer may perform
most, or all, of the tasks in creating the estimate and analysis, given some guidelines from the
business roles. On larger projects, or later in the stage gate process, specialists in estimating, as
well as other engineering disciplines, and business decision and risk analysis people will be more
involved. In those cases, the process engineer provides an engineering lead role and helpsto ensure
all the right people have the information they need; people understand the assumptions that are
present, and that important details are not missed.
Early-stage estimates aim to support the decision-making process of whether to continue a
project. Figure 9.1 shows the progression of different estimates, their accuracy, and the project
completion timeline. The approach is always to minimize the cost of creating the estimate while
providing a desired level of accuracy. The estimate classes are defined by numerous people, such
as the Association for the Advancement of Cost Estimates (AACE), but are described below
with the accuracy and information required for chemical engineering projects by Lagace (2006)
(Table 9.1).
9.5 Estimate Types and Methods
9.5.1 Order of Magnitude
One of the issues every project grapples with is having an idea of the CAPEX before a project begins.
The following describes fast but low-accuracy methods for determining the approximate cost of a
plant. Unfortunately, people often believe the first number they hear is the correct number, prob￾ably because it is the lowest value they will see, and that can hurt credibility later in a project,
so caution is advised in using the methods below.
Experienced engineers and business people have the experience to guesstimate the CAPEX of a
process remarkably well.Table 9.1 Estimate types and required information.

There may be some information available such as a plant cost per ton of product made, or per $
of sales (turnover ratio). See Garrett (2012).
You might consider back-calculating a range for an acceptable CAPEX using the observation that
the CAPEX and OPEX combined must be paid by the difference between revenue and raw material
costs (gross margin). In a sense, this is a simplified variation on a payback period.
Prior experience with similar processes can provide you with a CAPEX:OPEX ratio that can be
used, or failing that by utilizing a wide range of values leads to a rough range of values for the
CAPEX as follows:
● Gross Margin = Revenue – Raw Material Costs.
● Gross margin is divided up to pay for CAPEX+ OPEX, ignore profit, taxes, fixed expense, etc.,
for the benefit of simplicity.
● CAPEX is recovered over multiple years.
● If a plant is dominated by OPEX, the CAPEX:OPEX ratio per year could be 10 : 90 (1/10th).
● If a plant is dominated by CAPEX costs, the CAPEX:OPEX ratio per year could be 90 : 10 (9/10th).
Example: If the Revenue – Raw Materials costs are $100MM per year, and the life of the plant is
10 years, the CAPEX might range from:
$100MM × 1∕10 × 10 years = $100MM to
$100MM × 9∕10 × 10 years = $900MM
While this is a large range, it does provide some useful information very quickly.
Unfortunately, published CAPEX:OPEX ratios for various technologies are not readily available,
so they need to be developed by industry or company for a more accurate assessment.
Other approaches to back calculating an approximate range of allowable CAPEXs can be used:
● Return on Investment (ROI), where the % return is assumed, and the expected cash flow per year
is used to provide an initial investment value.
● Return on Assets (ROA) is a value that can be determined from a corporation’s publicly traded
financial statements. Net income, also known as profit (income after all expenses, depreciation,
interest, and taxes has been deducted from revenue), is divided by total assets. This % can be used
to determine a corporation’s typical asset value based on the income you expect it to provide.
An alternative to this would be the ratio of gross profit to asset value. Gross profit includes the
costs to produce the product such as raw materials, labor, and utilities, but not taxes.
● Asset turnover ratio is the revenue divided by the asset value. These values can also be derived
from the corporate financial documents’ values more specific to the company’s business.
9.5.2 Licensor Estimate
If a process is to be built from licensor information, initial estimates of economics can be obtained
from them. On the other hand, licensor estimates can be difficult to obtain without signing nondis￾closure documents, which can increase the time and effort to obtain them.
9.5.3 Capacity Factored Estimate
The capacity cost curve type estimate, also known as the 6/10th’s law, is a very useful one. Where
a larger multiunit process is being estimated, it might resemble other technologies which have
been previously been built and operating, and for which cost information is available. The cost of114 9 Capital Cost Estimating and Economic Analysis
a new plant based on that prior plant can be determined using a ratio of the two plant capacities
to an exponent, adjusted for inflation between years, and if necessary, adjusted for differences in
locations.
Cost of new plant = Cost of old plant (capacity new plant∕capacity old plant)
∧exponent
The exponent often used is 0.6 to 0.7 but varies. Dysert (2003B) discussed capacity factored esti￾mates and presented a table for different technologies. Perry had a list of exponents by technology.
Since the old plant and the new plant are being built at different times, inflation can be accom￾modated by utilization of a “plant cost index” value available for different years, and an educated
guess for the value when the new plant will be built. Plant cost index values are available from
sources such as the magazine Chemical Engineering (CEPCI index value) and others. See Dysert
(2003B), Ulrich (2009), and Williams (2021). See also the Cost Index Section 9.5.4.2.
If the regulatory environment has changed since the older plant was built, a hybrid estimate
composed of a capacity factored estimate and a more detailed method described below may achieve
the accuracy needed with minimal engineering effort.
There are numerous sources of information for these types of estimates. It is likely that a large
company has a database of these projects that can be relied on, but an hour in the library or search￾ing for similar projects is an excellent starting place. One source of process and technology feasi￾bility studies, and capacity factored cost information is the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL) website.
While the estimates below contain more detail, and thus more perceived accuracy, a capacity fac￾tored estimate hassome advantagesin that it may include equipment and issuesthat other estimate
methods could miss until significant engineering effort has been invested. Merrow (1979) warned,
“A carefully implemented time-consuming estimate based on uncertain plant characteristics is lit￾tle better than an initial estimate performed quickly”.
To compensate for inaccuracies in this method, contingency is added (as it is to all estimates).
Contingency is discussed well by Lagace (2006) and in the chapter below. Methods for calculating
contingency that are said to achieve estimate accuracy to within +/−10% regardless of the engi￾neering development performed are presented by Merrow (1981). This method isfurther discussed
below (section 9.8.2.4).
9.5.4 Factored Equipment Estimate (FEE)
There are three types of estimates that are used that fit in this category. All use the equipment costs
and multipliersto determine the overall plant cost. They require that you have the equipment deter￾mined, sized, and to some extent costed. For this reason, there is substantially more engineering
costs and time involved in developing an estimate this way.
The first of these estimates, the Lang factor method,sums up the equipment costs and multiplies
this value by 5 (or some value similar to this based on experience) to reach a total installed cost
(TIC). Despite the simplicity of this method, a very large proportion of companies use this method
ubiquitously. The second, pioneered by Guthrie and others, uses a more complex method, which
can simultaneously determine costs for the equipment based on physical design parameters like
size. This is the preferred method used by engineering companies who have a budget to prepare
the engineering required for it.
If you miss equipment in a FEE, it can impact the estimate, possibly significantly. Ensuring
enough engineering design is complete to use this method along with judicious use of decision
and risk analysis techniques is advised.
It wasstated by Lagace (2006) that in almost all cases, estimates are more accurate than the scope
used to develop them, and that most inaccurate estimates are caused by things we forgot to include,9.5 Estimate Types and Methods 115
things we decided to leave out, wishful thinking, and things in the realm of “known unknowns”.
Since the FEE methods rely on pricing all the equipment (or at least all the expensive equipment),
before diving into the method, we will look at the issues a process engineer should understand that
contributes to inaccurate FEE estimates.
Many FEE estimates have a process simulation to support them. Understandably, for the sake
of completing the engineering in a reasonable amount of time, simulations (and hand material
balances) do not necessarily model the entire process and usually have assumptions built in such
as:
● Not all the chemical components that could exist in a process are in the model.
● There is zero pressure drop between equipment, and gravity or hydraulic head effects are not
considered.
● The process is at steady state, and start-up or shutdown is not considered in the model.
● A fictitious unit-op (i.e. “component splitter”) can somehow be turned into a piece of equipment
later. Models can use black box unit-ops where an actual process cannot.
● Process storage and storage tanks for feeds and products may not be represented in a model, and
these can have significant cost implications.
● Feed streams magically appear, and waste streams magically disappear. These assumptions can
require extensive engineering and subsequent capital and/or OPEX.
● Control of the process, and product quality, is achievable.
The design process usually requires an engineering step after the simulation to generate a more
detailed PFD that is adequate to base an estimate upon. The engineer and estimator must ensure
all the necessary pumps, compressors, and fans,start-up heaters/coolers, and so forth are included.
They must satisfy themselves that they have accounted for the frictional, process pressure dif￾ferential, and gravity requirements to move material around the plant. They should also ensure
equipment for start-up or shutdown has been included. An approach for waste streams must be
defined, so the estimate can have associated capital equipment or OPEX included.
An approach to ensure a higher quality FEE isto prepare preliminary P&IDsforthe plant. P&IDs
will inevitably uncover some equipment that was missing from the design. The P&IDs can also
provide information about the complexity of the control system which can be included in the
estimate.
9.5.4.1 Obtaining Equipment Prices
FEEs rely on equipment prices and factors to determine the TIC. Obtaining equipment prices
is therefore key but getting vendor prices can be a lengthy and expensive task. Thus, there
are fast-track methods using correlations, or experience to determine the equipment prices, as
described in Figure 9.2.
Vendor quotes require the most engineering effort and time to obtain but provide the benefit
of accuracy and a price “guarantee” for a period of time. That guarantee can be useful in the risk
analysisforthe project.If only a “budget quote” isrequested, a vendor can use their own experience
to provide an estimate in a shorter period without resorting to their own engineering, but without
the price guarantee. There is a balance between accuracy for minimum risk, time, and cost.
Engineering experience from recent jobs can provide a reasonable level of accuracy in lieu of
equipment quotes. An experienced person may just know that a fan or pump will cost roughly
$10 000, and if, relative to the overall estimate, this is not a significant amount, the impact of such
a decision can be assessed.
Where experience or vendor quotes are not possible, there are two major methods that can be
used to obtain equipment costs from correlations. The first method is detailed by Guthrie (1969A),
Ulrich (2009), Perry’s, and Turton (2003), and others utilizes key equipment parameters (i.e. heat116 9 Capital Cost Estimating and Economic Analysis
exchanger type, materials of construction, design pressure, and total tube surface area) to obtain a
price from historical correlations.
A second method might be considered by some to be a variation of the Guthrie method.
This method is built into some commercial software packages (i.e. those contained within
Aspen/HYSYS or The Richardson Process Plant Standards) and uses process information similar
to Guthrie. Some correlations are more complex and simulate those used in a fabrication shop
to design and cost equipment. Simplified equipment prices based on the Aspentech program are
presented by Loh (2002). A comparison of various costing programs is presented by Feng (2011).
It is worth noting that equipment costs are strongly affected by the selected materials of construc￾tion. Preparing a materials of construction flowsheet can aid in defining materials for equipment
and piping. Merrow (1981) further discussed the risks to the process lifespan from contaminants.
Carbon steel is usually the starting point for material selection and, with the exception of poly￾mers, is generally the least costly. The cost differential when using other materials,such asstainless
steel, is not solely limited to the purchase cost of the materials. Welding practices, shop cleanli￾ness, hydrotest water quality, quality assurance, and other fabrication requirements are significant
to the final equipment cost. These factors make it difficult to confirm the material of construction
factors in the correlations against currently known raw material costs without obtaining vendor
quotes. To give a sense of the effects of materials of construction, the factors for different materials
of construction for pressure vessels per Turton (2003) are in Table 9.2.
9.5.4.2 Cost Indexes – Timing Is Important
To address the issue of using costs from prior projects, most methods rely on an industry cost index
such as the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI) to inflate the cost of equipment from

a known date, or CEPCI index value, to the cost of the equipment now or at a future time. The
estimator may find recent values for the CEPCI, but must forecast and specify the expected future
CEPCI value for the project.
Clearly, all these methods rely on factors and assumptions to develop the total installed equip￾ment cost. Regardless, the value for equipment costs can be good enough to make decisions, espe￾cially so by testing the sensitivity of the costs in the overall project decision and risk analysis.
After the equipment costs have been determined, the installed equipment and overall plant cost
can be developed using the following methods.
9.5.4.3 Lang Factor Estimates
The Lang factor method is performed by multiplying the sum of the equipment costs by a single
value to obtain the total installed plant cost (see Table 9.3).
The lower factors for solids processing plants do not imply that those plants are cheaper to con￾struct, only that the equipment alone is a higher proportion (about 32%) of the overall cost versus
a fluid processing plant where equipment is about 20% of the overall cost.
9.5.4.4 Guthrie Method
The Guthrie method has been modified, extended, and customized by numerous people and com￾panies (Figure 9.3). It deviates from the Lang factor method by using separate factors for each

well when providing different levels of accuracy or allowance for equipment costs that have been
obtained with different methods.
A modified Guthrie method determines the plant cost as follows:
Where the equipment factors are from Table 9.4.
More expensive metallurgy utilizes lower equipment factors because the equipment costs are a
higher proportion of the TIC, which includes items like wire, concrete, and structural steel, which
do not change with process equipment metallurgy.
There are variations on Guthrie’s method that calculates a “base cost” representing the cost of a
piece of equipment in a standard material and pressure (usually carbon steel and 150 psig). The
base cost is multiplied by a factor for installation to cover structural steel, concrete, electrical,
instruments, etc. The multipliers on base cost will vary less. We prefer to use methods that work

with a mixed method of obtaining equipment costs in actual materials being used, so they can be
compared or more easily integrated with vendor quotes.
A comparison of the FEE methods follows (Figure 9.4), which illustrates that the two methods
before allowances are added provided similar results. Figure 9.5 has a note that back calculates the
approximate hours required to do the initial process engineering for such a project based on the
engineering breakout for process hours of 8% of the engineering budget.
Engineering costs can range as a percentage of direct field costs (DFCs) from 10% to 30%, but
25% was the most common value used. Engineering costs are also often stated as a ratio of the
total project cost (TIC) and historically ran 12% of the TIC. More recent values indicate a range of
12–30% of the TIC, with 18–21% being the average. Process engineering is about 8–12% of the total
engineering budget.
It may be necessary to add additional line items or factors to these estimates to account for the
following:
● Location factor: The cost correlations are generally based on plants built on the US Gulf Coast.
Plants built in other areas can provide historical information on the location factor to build in
those areas. Alternatively, there are published values for location factors. In most situations, the
location factors affect the labor to construct and shipping, but not the equipment costs, so the
modified Guthrie method approach above is a good one for utilizing a location factor. Uppal
(1997) presented a table of labor productivities for American cities to provide location adjust￾ments. Reemer (2002) provided a list of sources to determine location factors. Garrett (2012) had
a list of construction cost location factors.
● Winterization: If the plant requires protection from winter, a 3% addition to the DFC can be
added.
● Utility systems, site preparation, etc. may be required, and these factors vary from 1.2 to 2 of the
IFC+ DFC subtotal.
● DCSs: Typically, the instrumentation that was used when the equipment factors were developed
was more primitive than what is used today. If P&IDs are available, the number of control loops
can be counted, and a line item of $500/loop can be added for the DCS. A multiplier on older
instrumentation costs is another approach.
A summary of the equipment costs could look as follows (Figure 9.5).
9.6 Detailed Capital Cost Estimates and Design/Build Projects
Detailed estimates use material takeoffs and per-unit costs that will include many line items.
For example, with a single-pump installation, in a FEE, just the pump is costed and factors are
used to account for the installation. In the case of a detailed estimate, the following would be
considered along with the labor costs to install the pump:
● earthworks, foundations, steel, etc;
● pump and motor, labor to mount and align;
● motor control center (MCC);
● length and gauge of the wiring from the MCC to the motor;
● local switches for On/Off/Auto;
● pressure indicators;
● pressure switches, wiring back to the control system;9.7 Hybrid Capital Cost Estimates 121
● vibration switches, wiring back to the control system;
● any other control hardware (flow meters);
● control valve;
● control system hardware;
● control system software and configuration;
● length and diameter of the piping, manual isolation valves, automatic valves, fire safety valves,
strainers, filters, check valves, etc.;
● structural steel and hangers for piping, which may require piping stress analysis;
● relief valve installation and piping, which may also require a disposal system;
● diameter and length of pipe insulation;
● tracing, and controls.
Generating those numbers requires a high level of engineering design to be completed and an
experienced estimator.
An owner’s engineering team might complete smaller plant projects, but most expansion or new
capital projects are completed by contractors to save time and costs, as well as bringing special￾ized knowledge into the design process. While the contractors often have experience in estimating
and the database of costs, they are neither mind readers nor magicians, and the same rules of
design development that apply to an owner also apply to them. To create an estimate in the face
of uncertain information, a contractor might need to add substantial allowances or incorporate
numerous assumptions and exclusion clauses. Alternatively, they could produce a lower-quality
estimate, which typically leads to issues that can haunt the project later. Ensuring the engineer￾ing documentation is thoroughly prepared is crucial for producing a quality estimate. Failure to do
so will leave a project that you, your operators, and your maintenance people may not like, or if
you are unfortunate, a poor process with unexpected costs and lawsuits. Define the project, com￾municate the needs, and prepare a quality estimate to ensure the project has its best chance of
success.
On small projects, a detailed estimate may be something that does not require a great deal of
time and effort. Williams(2021) discussed matching the estimate type to the projectsize. Generally,
large-project detailed estimates are prepared by specialists and require a lot of engineering support
and are often done after the project has already been approved based on a less rigorous method
(see Chapter 10, Project Management). If you are preparing a detailed estimate and it is more than
a few pages in length, you will probably want to consult with an experienced project engineer to
ensure you have not missed any considerations.
9.7 Hybrid Capital Cost Estimates
Estimates methods can be adapted to suit the situation. If a capacity factored estimate provides
enough accuracy, apart from the environmental controls, then it can be combined with a FEE or a
detailed estimate to provide the necessary level of accuracy.
In our view, an ideal estimating method allows you to obtain equipment prices via a mixed vari￾ety of methods(vendors, correlations, and manual estimates). Costsfor more expensive,specialized
equipment or those made from special materials that correlations do not cover can be determined
by obtaining quotes from vendors. Less expensive or price-predictable equipment can be obtained
with a faster less costly method. The estimate can combine the different price accuracies to deter￾mine an overall improved estimate accuracy.122 9 Capital Cost Estimating and Economic Analysis
9.8 Estimate Summaries and Additional Factors
A key deliverable in these estimates is usually a “priced equipment list”, which could look like
Figure 9.6. The estimate summary sheet (Figure 9.7) may add variousline itemsfor additional costs
(vendor package, non-core process facilities, etc.), location factors, general project construction
costs, and so forth.
9.8.1 Grass Roots Factor
The grass roots factor is sometimes applied at the base of FEEs. This factor would not appear as a
separate line item in a detailed estimate since the equipment costs would be individually listed and
included. The value, often ranging from 1.3 (according to Guthrie) to 1.5 times the process unit
costs, accounts for general site facilities, such as loading/unloading facilities, maintenance, and
utility facilities. Literature sources provide vague guidance on thisfactor because it is highly specific
to the site and process. The significant impact of this factor on the total estimated cost introduces
a considerable amount of uncertainty. While it might be adequate for early-stage estimates, it is
advisable to attempt to estimate these costs directly and incorporate them into the capital estimate
as early as possible.
9.8.2 Allowance and Contingency – Estimating the Unknowns
The reader should be advised that there is some contention in the definitions being used below.
Communication between the estimator and stakeholders is essential to confirm definitions and
the application of allowance, contingency, etc. A list of exclusions and inclusions written into the
scope of work is equally as important.
This section also introduces projected risks, those possible issues that might have an impact on
a project’s completion. The topic of risk will be expanded upon below and in other chapters.
9.8.2.1 Escalation
This is the amount of money that needs to be allocated to address inflation over the period of the
project. It might be added to the line items for the equipment, assuming a schedule is available, or
just across the entire estimate.
9.8.2.2 Allowance – Probability 1, but Unknown Costs
An estimate can miss its stated value by items that are 100% needed and known about, but the
actual cost value has some uncertainty (plus or minus). Examples are as follows:
● Depending on the type of estimate (feasibility or detailed), the piping was estimated to go from
A to B, but later in the design, it is realized that it needs to go through C.
● In the feasibility estimate, you estimate that a pump will cost X based on experience, but quotes
were not obtained. You are reasonably sure that your guess is close, so the solution is to add an
allowance for line items that have some uncertainty at the point the engineering design is at.
● A compressor package is quoted from a supplier, but history would suggest as work on the design
proceeds, there are additional costs.
These are sometimes called known unknowns, though it might be better to be called known
issues. Note that quantity or amount errors on some items could also reduce the cost of the estimate.
Some companies will not allocate very much for allowances, expecting they are overestimatingProject: Costing example Date: March 31, 2024

as often as they are underestimating. Factors that can affect how much allowance to carry are
as follows:
● How much design has been completed
● What type of equipment is included
● Typical experience in scope growth of this type of equipment or with that vendor
● Whether the project is a greenfield or brownfield (plant expansion), where the brownfield
projects typically need a higher allowance.9.8 Estimate Summaries and Additional Factors 125
A project might typically spend 10% extra on equipment not identified on the P&IDs at the time
of the estimate (filters,small tanks, etc.). If the experience isthat you will need this money on every
project, placing it in the allowance category is sensible.
An owner may decide late in the design that instead of having one pump operating and one pump
spare, they want two pumps operating and a third pump as a spare. The contractor will undoubtedly
view this as a scope change (see Section 9.8.3), but an owner typically knows there will be small
design changes they will want to do during a project and will need to allocate a pool of funds to
these needs. Hence, while the contractor sees this as a scope change, the owner may see this as an
issue dealt with by allowance funds (they may also categorize it as a contingency).
Communication between contractors and owners on these contentious definitions and what is
included is critical. A good working relationship between the two parties will make these types of
issues just part of the project process rather than a cause for concern.
9.8.2.3 Contingency – Probability <1
Another source of error in an estimate is for line items that do not have a 100% certainty of being
needed, or unpredictable situations (e.g. weather). This is also contentious because an engineering
contractoris not a mind reader, and they are encouraged not to pad an estimate forfear of losing the
contract. However, there are risks, such as a project that is being built on the US Gulf Coast during
hurricane season. You might have a hurricane, you might not, and the project might be stopped
for a day, a week, or not at all. For these types of situations, either contingency or insurance is
advisable. Contingency allocates a pool of fundsto handle a few likely but uncertain situations, but
not all of them. For instance, you might not allocate funds for both a snowstorm and a hurricane
since both are unlikely to occur over the duration of the project. There may be a 50% chance that
wet weather will cause a 10% increase in construction costs. There may be a 25% chance that it will
be a dry construction period and save 5% of the cost. A risk-based approach can help determine
how much contingency to include in the estimate.
9.8.2.4 Rand Contingency Analysis
In the 1980s, the Rand Corporation analyzed chemical process industry projects to understand
factors contributing to project cost, schedule, and quality problems. Their original work was pub￾lished as a series of four papers listed in the references (see Merrow 1979, 1981, 1983, 1986). While
those papers are still relevant today, a company that provides updates and consulting services to
an industry consortium was spun out of that work. For more information, refer to the company
website Independent Project Analysis (www.ipaglobal.com).
The original papers provide further details for a person to understand and estimate some key
factors that can predict the CAPEX uncertainty and start-up duration in projects. The factors are
as follows:
1. New technology: The ratio of the cost of equipment used for new, commercially unproven
technology to that used in proven technologies.
2. Impurities: The susceptibility of the process to problems that arise from the buildup of
impurities.
3. Complexity: The number of processsteps(not the pieces of equipment, number ofsteps, i.e. feed
handling, gasification, reaction, and separation).
4. Project definition:
a. Have pre-start-up personal costs been included?
b. Have pre-start-up inventory costs been included?126 9 Capital Cost Estimating and Economic Analysis
c. Have land purchase costs been confirmed and included?
d. Is the design in the R&D stage, or (pre-)commercial?
e. To what degree has engineering been completed?
f. To what degree has site-specific information been obtained?
Utilizing those considerations, a cost growth ratio is determined (Figure 9.8) and used as a
contingency in the project. The original paper states that projects using their method of con￾tingency calculations will achieve an estimate accuracy of 10% regardless of engineering design
development.
9.8.2.5 Insurance – Very Low Probability Factors
There are situations that have a very low probability, but if they occur, you need funds to recover
and thus need to address them. A fire might be one example. These events might affect only a few
projects in a basket of many, so it may make sense to use insurance, which you will see as one of
the estimate line items. This is a risk you pass along to another party, and you obviously have a
subsequent counterparty risk that they may not pay.
9.8.3 Scope Changes
There are times when external situations cause a design to not meet the requirements, and
it needs to be changed, which has cost and schedule consequences. It is easy to imagine
a regulatory change, or perhaps the process is to make toothpaste, and the market size
has changed. These are unforeseen, “unknown unknowns”, changes that cannot reason￾ably be listed, their effect cannot be predicted, and they cannot be given a probability. The
only solution to these situations is to stop, decide the impact on the project, and decide
on the soundness of the changes. In these situations, the budget for the project could be
increased.
Depending on the contract,small design error changes or design omissions with relatively minor
cost implications are passed to the owner (who must carry an allowance for these) or be dealt with
by the contractor’s inclusion of some allowance into their fee.
9.9 Economic Analysis
The primary objectives for constructing or modifying a process are to improve some, or all of:
● regulatory requirements,
● safety, environmental, societal impact,
● earnings of a company by saving money or increasing revenue.
In the case of meeting regulatory requirements or improving the societal impact, the objective
from an economic point of view may be to minimize any negative economic impact. However, it
is common to also look for opportunities that will improve the economic impact through better
reliability, better quality, possibly high production rates, reduced waste and energy, lower envi￾ronmental footprint, and so forth. Determining the economic impact of a process design is an
important part of assessing the viability, and options available to a designer.
Following the preparation of the CAPEX estimate, the economic viability of the project is typi￾cally performed, followed by an analysis of opportunities and problems.9.9 Economic Analysis 127

Figure 9.8 Contingency calculation via rand methodology.128 9 Capital Cost Estimating and Economic Analysis
In situations where revenue is difficult to predict at the time of the estimate, Anderson (2009)
mentions toothpaste as such an example, then the cost to manufacture is a metric that can be
developed and further utilized by the organization. If revenue values can be estimated, then tools
such as NPV, IRR, and a myriad of other metrics can be developed and utilized in the decision
making.
The economic analysis allows the project to be analyzed from a variety of angles, can assist the
technology development on how further research or engineering might be needed to improve the
project. Forinstance, it might be recognized that a utility, a solvent, a waste stream, or other costs are
disproportionally large, and the overall project would benefit from reducing their costs. Sensitivity
analysis can be performed on the uptime of the process which can lead to reliability and redundancy
guidance, thus feeding back to the engineering design and capital estimate.
Thissection begins with the determination of operating expenses and proceedsto the calculation
of economics, risk analysis, and decision making.
9.9.1 Operating Costs, Profitability Risk Analysis, and Economic Optimization
9.9.1.1 Operating Expenses
Operating expenses(OPEX)forrunning the plant are the nextstep before the economic analysis can
be completed. Similarto the CAPEX, there are direct costs and indirect manufacturing costs. Direct
costs include: Cost of feed chemicals, waste disposal, and utilities should be gathered based on the
throughput of the plant in kg h−1 of product produced. Operating labor, supplies, maintenance,
and repairs as well as laboratory charges and any relevant patent royalties should be included in
the direct manufacturing costs. Indirect OPEX are those overhead costs associated with running
the plant such as administration, human resources, accounting costs, some aspects of R&D, and
so forth.
There are ways to estimate the number of operators a plant will require based on the equipment,
but usually, an experienced engineer will have a good sense of how many DCS operators are needed
and how many field operators may be required. Considerations for field operators should include
the number of pieces of equipment, the physical distances in the plant, the likely need for multiple
operatorsto help each otherin the field, and the number and duration of manual operationssuch as
rail/truck unloading or produce loading, and sample taking. Once the number of operators has been
assessed per shift, the total number of employed operators will take into consideration: 12 hour
shifts, days off, vacation and statutory holidays as follows:
Total employed operators = 4.5 × operators per shift
Utility and Waste Disposal preliminary cost values Turton (2003) are presented in Figure 9.9.
Ulrich (2006) presents a method to calculate utility costs based on fuel and electricity costs.
A series of equations and factors utilizing the capital and direct OPEX is presented below and
mostly from Turton (2003) follows in Table 9.5.
Where typical values for the factors are in Table 9.6.
The Operating Income Before Tax (EBITA) may be calculated at this point. If there is a profit that
year, the depreciation is determined from applicable corporate tax income laws, and is applied as
a deduction against income, thus reducing the taxable income to a value no lower than 0.
Working Capital is the amount of money that must be spent on raw materials and the inventory
of raw materials on an ongoing basis. For instance, the plant needs to be filled with raw materials
before any product is produced and can be sold. Product usually must be inventoried, and typically
30 days are allowed for customersto pay. Working capital can be assumed to be 17.5% of Equipment9.9 Economic Analysis 129

Capital if no better value can be determined (Turton 2003).In the final year of the plant, the working
capital can be assumed to be removed and sold.
In Canada, the depreciation is dealt with using the term Capital Cost Allowance. Capital Cost
Allowance has two accounts that must be tracked. The first account is the “Unused CCA” which
begins at the total CAPEX. Each year a percentage of the Unused CCA, as determined by the CCA
class, is transferred to the second account, the “CCA account”. If the company has enough pretax
income, it may claim the entire amount in the CCA account, thus zeroing it annually. However,
the CCA cannot be used to create a loss. If a loss would result, the remaining CCA stays in the
account and can be used against future year’s income. One special situation is that the first year of
claiming CCA, you may only transfer 50% of the allowable amount from the “unused CCA”. This
is to address the fact that, on average, the plant started up and began depreciating halfway through
the year.
In the final year of the plant, the difference between any unused or unclaimed CCA and the scrap
value (10% of the CAPEX) can be claimed as a loss or profit.
Taxable income isthus calculated asthe before tax income minusthe allowableCCA forthat year.
If a loss is incurred for that year, the loss is accumulated and can be used against future income.
Large plants may have other tax implications that are specific to their location.
Positive taxable income is taxed at the corporate tax rate (assume 30%), and the remaining
amount is the after-tax “operating income”, or profit.
A summary sheet showing these calculations and the year by year DCFs follows (Figure 9.10):
9.9.2 Economic Comparison Methods
Measures of profitability include (see Table 9.7):
● Return On Investment
● Payback Period,
● Net Present Value
● Internal Rate of Return
Discounted methods rely on a “discount rate”, also known as the “hurdle rate”, or “minimum
acceptable rate of return (MARR)”. This value can be thought of as the interest rate that is expectedTable 9.5 Typical cost factors and equations.

if an equivalent amount of CAPEX money is invested. An acceptable value for this varies based on
the cost of obtaining the initial investment (cost of capital), the risk of the project not achieving the
stated cash flow, and otherfactors. A projectrequired for a regulatory requirement may only use the
company’s cost of capital, whereas an unproven new technology project may require a risk-adjusted
cost of capital or hurdle rate that ensures a basket of such projects, in which some will fail, can still
achieve an overall minimum investment return requirement.
At a high enough hurdle rate value, the profit becomes great enough that the project will pay for
itself simply from the cash flow in the first year, and no extended external source of capital funds
is required.
After-tax profit is carried forward to the enterprise’sincome statement, which would be reflected
in higher corporate earnings and an improved Price-to-earnings ratio.
9.9.3 Determine the Cost of Manufacturing
A balance sheet of ongoing costs and revenues, along with a portion of the initial capital (assuming
straight-line depreciation over a set number of years), can be used to calculate the cost of manufac￾turing.
The cost of manufacture is also the product selling price when the venture breaks even. There is
likely to be some discussion as to what exactly is meant by “break-even”, but it can be interpreted
as when the NPV is calculated to be zero, when the discount rate is set to zero. An arguably better
metric would be the cost of manufacture when the discountrate isset to the MARR value. When the
Discount rate = MARR, the minimum selling price, or cost of manufacture, would be determined
for the minimum viable project.
9.10 Risk Analysis of Project Economics
Risk, regardless of the context in which it occurs, is the multiplication of probability and conse￾quences. If the issue is 100% going to happen, it’s not a risk; it’s an issue, so you start making plans
for its occurrence.

Risks are composed of:
● an existing condition(s) or cause(s) which is something that is true today,
● an uncertainty or risk factor of a triggering event, and
● an effect if that risk factor becomes true.
Risk Analysis enters many aspects of engineering design and business. Projects in the chemical
processindustry are characterized by their complexity,significantscale, high costs, extensive reach,
and long timelines. The risks have implications in various domains:
● Environmental and public health impact: These projects can affect the environment and the
health and safety of extensive populations across broad geographical regions for extended
periods.
● Raw materials and waste management: The handling of raw materials, management of waste
streams, and the risk of accidental chemical releases or energy discharges pose localized yet
substantial risks.
● Financial investment: The construction of facilities often demands substantial financial invest￾ment, with costs frequently reaching into the billions of USD, making economic losses a major
concern.134 9 Capital Cost Estimating and Economic Analysis
● External uncertainty: Factorssuch as fluctuating customer demands, competitive dynamics,reg￾ulatory changes,societal acceptance, technologicalshifts, and business cycles critically influence
project necessity and viability.
⚬ A facility initially deemed economically viable may face budget constraints and cost-cutting
measures in subsequent years, affecting safety of operations and community relations.
● Internal uncertainty: The reliability of underlying technology and the effectiveness of project
execution are pivotal to a project’s success, with uncertainties in these areas posing significant
risks to its feasibility.
This underscores the varied risks and considerations inherent in chemical process industry
projects, highlighting the need for meticulous planning, risk management, and adaptability in
response to both internal and external uncertainties.
From a project execution perspective, the effects or consequences of risks within a project can
come in the form of missed objectivesin cost,schedule, or quality. These can, in turn, be risk factors,
along with others, in the long-term viability of the project. Issues such as safety, environmental
impact, and so forth also need to be considered, but in this chapter, we will limit our risk analysis
efforts to economic ones.
Risks can be opportunities or threats, and both could be examined for their potential benefits
and harm. The general process of Risk Analysis includes these steps:
1. Define the objectives of the risk analysis: It may be as simple as achieving a certain economic
return value, but there could be others to document.
2. Risk identification: Utilizing a method such as a checklist, brainstorming, or other tools, define
the factors that lead to undesirable (or desirable) outcomes.
a. This may include reviewing factors used in the estimate and their certainty. To save time,
break the risk analysis into just a few major sections of the economic analysis. If one section
shows a high sensitivity, that section can be broken down further.
3. Risk evaluation: Prioritize the risk impact by determining the effect (possibly through economic
modeling).
4. Define responses: Determine what should be done to mitigate the risks.
5. Execute the responses as required.
6. Review the responses for their desired effect and change as needed.
Some Tools for performing a risk analysis overlap with process hazard analysis risk tools and
include:
● Risk registers: Are a useful tool for documenting and managing the risk management process.
See Table 9.8.
● SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats)
● Checklists: provide flexibility to tailor to any situation, but require expertise to generate
● Experts (Delphi Technique)
● FMEA (Failure mode and Effects Analysis)
● FTA (Fault Tree Analysis)
● Risk Matrices (Risk Impact/Probability Charts)
● Pert Analysis (Program Evaluation and Review Technique): for schedule risk
● Sensitivity Analysis
● Scenario Analysis
● Monte Carlo Simulations
● Rand/IPA analysis9.10 Risk Analysis of Project Economics 135

The economic model is a useful tool for determining the consequences and ranking of risks,
either individually in a sensitivity analysis or collectively for scenarios and Monte Carlo analysis.
Sensitivity of metrics to individual inputs:
● The economic model can be tested for positive NPV using various input values, such as high and
low CAPEX estimates or high and low revenue values.
● By providing individual equipment accuracies, it’s possible to develop an estimate of the CAPEX
range.
● A worst-case value that would make the NPV = 0 can be determined for input variables.
● Test for the effects on NPV from a longer-than-expected start-up or production rates that do not
meet targets, either due to technical problems or lack of customers.
● Scenario development: Scenarios are an effective tool for developing an economic assessment
given multiple factors that have all changed in some way. This method is popular with Royal
Dutch Shell, and several online articles discuss their use of it.
● Monte Carlo analysis: This method provides the probabilities of achieving a range of economic
metrics given ranges in multiple input assumptions. A simple Monte Carlo Analysis is surpris￾ingly quick to add to a spreadsheet using a macro. More sophisticated tools are available com￾mercially for that purpose.
9.10.1 Managing Risk in the Project CAPEX
By definition, an estimate is never completely accurate. You hope the final project will fall within
the range of accuracy you’re aiming for, but thought and care must be applied to make that happen.
Managing the risk in the CAPEX is done by incorporating the previously discussed estimate line
items of Allowance, Contingency, Insurance, Escalation, and Scope Change.
9.10.2 Decision Making: The “So What?” of Risk Analysis
Risk analysis identifies the factors and consequences. Decisions can then be made about how to
address the possibility of those factors becoming true. A risk register provides an excellent way to
document and control risks that are ongoing in a project. However, there is a strategic go/no go
decision-making process also.
Decisions to continue a project are both economic and strategic. For instance:
● The company may be limited in the amount of capital available at the time of the evaluation.
A project may have to be halted due to lack of capital.
● Other projects competing for capital may be ranked higher in return, importance, need,
or strategic fit.
● The payback period, if less than a year, implies the capital can be paid through the project’s own
cash flow. That’s usually a very attractive situation.136 9 Capital Cost Estimating and Economic Analysis
● How long is the project cash flow required to pay the project back, and how certain is the cash
flow? Longer-period projects are subject to greater risk in the business environment; thus, cash
flow predictability is a risk.
● Projects, ones with long-term contracts for raw material purchases and/or product sales, are
potentially less risky. Counter-party risk becomes an aspect that may require examination.
● If the project is strategic and allows the company to increase market share or leverage other
corporate assets or competencies, it may be more attractive.
The information from a project’s economic and decision risk analysis can help engineers or busi￾ness professionals focus efforts on areas needing improvement or uncertainty reduction.
A range of values can be trialed in the economic model, and the results could indicate the plant
should definitely be built and operated. More likely, as in the case of a Monte Carlo analysis, the
outcome may show a positive NPV across a percentage of scenarios. That leaves the analysis possi￾bly creating as many questions asitstarted with. However, the analysis can point to specific areas of
uncertainty in the technology or business situation that need further effort to be studied and accu￾racy reduced. It may point to where variability needs to be reduced through contracts or other risk
management techniques. The solutions will be very project-specific, so creative problem-solving
and returning to economic modelling may be advisable. Christensen (2008) discusses how a reverse
balance sheet can help direct business, research, and engineering efforts more effectively and avoid
financial tools such as DCFs from killing innovation.

Project Management
10.1 Introduction
The scope of what constitutes a “project” is as varied as the challenges they present. A robust,
tailored, project management (PM) process can handle any of these scenarios. This chapter dis￾cusses the application of PM principles and tools across a range of projects, from the simple writ￾ing of a report to the complexity of designing and constructing large-budget chemical facilities.
Beginning with outlining the general steps and tools of PM planning, then narrowing the focus
to the chemical engineering discipline, and finally providing some guidance for process engineer￾ing tasks.
Recognizing that chemical engineers engage in projects outside their core field, this chapterintro￾duces the general PM tools and methodologies for any project and subsequently integrates them
with the details tailored for chemical engineering projects. PM terminology traditionally used in
the chemical industry does not align perfectly with that of the Project Management Institute (PMI),
which we choose to use in this text. The PMI framework is designed to be universally applicable,
but must be customized forspecific industries. Portny’s(2022) text is a valuable resource forfurther
application of the PMI framework. We suggest reading this chapter in combination with Chapter 2
(Documentation) and Chapter 9 (Capital Costing).
10.2 Comparison of Academic Versus Industry Project
Environments
We felt this chapter was necessary because PM, as Peachey (2007) and this author’s experience sug￾gest, is a challenging subject to address in university due to the lack of complex multi-stakeholder
situations to apply the theory. PM systems are intended to facilitate the generation of products effi￾ciently, inexpensively, and with high quality in an environment that has many internal and external
variables affecting the outcome. University projects aim to teach a particularset ofskills or thought
approaches, but the projects are typically highly defined or constrained,short-term, and (hopefully)
insulated from third-party interactions that could sidestep the learning objectives. Highly defined
projects exist in industry too, as tasks and often as part of a larger project; like their counterparts in
the educational system, they are manageable with tools like to-do lists. Projects that involve longer
durations, complex interactions between stakeholders, and third parties without direct benefit from
the project’ssuccess will benefit from PM’s more in-depth project initiation steps and tools,such as
network charts and Gantt charts, for effective planning and management.

10.3 The Core Principles of Project Management
No PM discussion would be complete without beginning with the three constraints: cost,schedule,
and scope; and the joke, “choose two” (Figure 10.1). The reality is that a project manager is chal￾lenged to fulfill the needs of all three while maintaining the necessary quality.
Engineers are experienced in optimizing multiple objectives and constraints in their field.
Successful projects require identifying the objectives and constraints as early as possible by
knowing who to consult and inform, achieving a design that best accommodates them, and
informing the stakeholders of their status.
The objectives and constraints can be financial, schedule, and performance (anything else).
The planning stages of PM involve revealing an onion of layers composed of stakeholders, their
requirements, and ideally an understanding of why. As much as possible, these layers are identified
during the project planning phase, but inevitably some slide into later phases of the project and
must be adequately accommodated through a change management system.
Objectives and requirements of a project can be non-tangible, for instance, an objective could
be for “the project to position the company as a world leader in the production of ABC.” Objectives
need to be converted into tangible deliverables, like a report or a chemical plant with a defined
production rate and quality. The section on project planning will delve into this in more detail.
10.4 Phases of a Project
A good general PM system will work for any type of project. Whether it is for a vacation, ren￾ovating an office, writing a report, designing a product, or building a chemical plant, the steps
and their management are very similar. Portny (2022) described the PMI process and deliverables.
Rosentrator (2013) related PMI practices to the chemical process industry discussed later in this
chapter.
There are four phases to every project:
1. initiation,
2. planning or front-end engineering with design iterations ending with project definition and
approval,
3. execution, detailed design, construction, and start-up, and
4. project closing.

10.4.1 Initiation
In the “100 Rules for Project Managers,” Madden and Stewart (1996) says, “The seeds of problems
are laid down early. Initial planning is the most vital part of a project. The review of most failed
projects or project problems indicates the disasters were well planned to happen from the start.”
Initiation involves collecting the objectives, known inputs, and constraints to the problem and
usually presenting them in some communicable format.Ifsomeone, the primary stakeholder(you),
were planning a vacation trip, you might say your objective is to go on a relaxing beach vacation
with the following constraints: You have two weeks in December and USD $5000, and you would
like to have a spot that has plenty of nice restaurants. In PMI terminology, this would be called
the project charter; in the engineering field, some people would call such an input a “business
objectives letter.” It will be short and contain key information about the project’s objectives and
rationale, but not a lot of background or details.
A second document could accompany the project charter or business objectives and issometimes
called the project briefing document or the first version of the “Basic Data.” The second, more
detailed document is a place to communicate everything you know about the problem and any prior
work that might have been done on the project. Basic data is going to be specific to the industry
and specific to the project.
In the travel example above, information such as you have been to three locations already, you
want to try somewhere different, you really like Italian food, it isthe rainy season in Bali during your
time off, you have a friend’sitinerary from two years ago that you like, and a magazine article on the
bestsnorkeling tripsin the world could all be relevant information and included in that background
project briefing document. The chemical process industry project will have background informa￾tion such as laboratory testing, reaction kinetic data, prior design work, and people who should
be consulted. A product design project would have relevant market and customer background and
needs information.
There are only three times when a project can be derailed: the beginning, the middle, and the end.
With the right tools and templates, the project manager can help avoid the project problems from
the beginning. Using a tool such as the “five why’s” (root cause analysis) during the project charter
will help to uncover and understand the nature and drivers of why the project is being undertaken
in a way that will assist future design decisions [Read (2015)].
Larsen (2005) and others described the initiation phase as one with extensive communication
between the sponsor, the project manager, and others.
Schatz (2018) discussed the metricsfor projectsuccessthat are different from the historically used
metrics. He also applies those metrics to the results of several projects in the chemical industry.
In addition, he emphasized prior project closeout reports should be consulted.
No doubt, the reader of this chapter has worked on projectsthat have had changes occur because
initial objectives were not clearly defined early on or opportunities for improvement were not fol￾lowed because of a lack of project understanding. The initiation of the project is well documented
by Portny to have several steps that seek to document and communicate the project in a way that
will help reduce these situations.
Objectives can be murky sometimes, and it is not uncommon in development projects for the
objectives to gain clarity once more engineering or business effort is expended. Getting a clear
understanding of the purpose early on will make a project manager more likely to be successful.
Portny (2022) described the following tasks in the initiation phase:
1. The initiation and planning phases involve gathering information to decide whether a project
can be done and whether it should be done. That simple phrase reveals quite a bit of insight,
and when unwrapped, it reveals a great deal about the PM steps.142 10 Project Management
2. Look at the big picture: How your project fits in and why you are doing it by identifying the
initiator(not necessarily the person who asked to do the project – dig deeperto find that person).
3. Perform a cost-benefit analysis: The idea of doing a cost-benefit of the project early on is an
effective tool for understanding what is important about the project, uncovering metrics that
should be included in the project objectives, and deciding if the project should be done.
4. Creating an audience list that identifies:
a. Project champion: A person in the organization who has significant influence to help the
project be successful.
b. Project drivers: Those people who have a say in what the project should accomplish or affect
itsscope. Drivers may be internal (sale reps, business people, operations people, maintenance
people, etc.) or external (ultimate customers, regulatory and government officials, etc.).
c. Project supporters: Those people who will help you with the project.
d. Others: People who are affected by, or will affect, the project in some manner.
5. Determine the project drivers’ real expectations and needs. There may be public relations or
other less obvious goals that are not stated in the project charter.
6. Uncover other activities that are occurring and relate to your project. Coordinate with those
efforts as needed.
7. Use the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Aggressive, Realistic, Time sensitive) technique to
describe the desired project objectives.
8. Document limitations, constraints, and assumptions.
9. Review, review, review.
10.4.2 Planning Phase: Project Plan Development and Scope Finalization
Once the project is initiated, it proceeds to the planning, preliminary, or front-end engineering
phase to explore options and add necessary detail to create the core project plan elements as well
as other optional project plan elements listed by Rosentrator (2013) in Figure 10.2.
In the chemical process industry, the planning phase is often divided into three phases
[Front-End Loading (FEL) 1, 2, and 3 explained in detail below] that are in reality, progressively

more detailed feasibility studies. By adding engineering definition to the project and certainty to
the cost plan in phases, the project can minimize costs and focus on issues in a timelier manner.
A key step in the planning phase is to turn the project objectives into a list of deliverables which
is documented in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
The WBS should be a list of tangible deliverables, not activities or metrics. The following is debat￾able in the PM community, but we believe it is better to stick to deliverables being physical objects
you could give to someone, and leave the non-tangibles in the project objectives (e.g. an objec￾tive is to achieve a 90% performance metric, and a deliverable is a printed report documenting the
plant performance metric). Portny (2022) presented the example of a WBS for building a house and
showed how it progressively decomposes the project’s intent into physical details of the house that
describe what will be delivered to the owner. A different example could be a project that delivers
a report. The WBS for that project could be the table of contents describing what the report will
contain to the level of detail necessary for the stakeholders to agree upon. The WBS should break a
project down to the level that the deliverables are clear to everyone who needs to create that deliv￾erable and can estimate how long it will take to produce it, and everyone who will be receiving the
deliverable agrees they will have what they want. Depending on how familiar people are with a
particular deliverable, there may need to be more detail. Sometimes the deliverable can be difficult
to describe if the team or project sponsor has never executed a similar project. In such situations,
try to find an example project that can provide a template of deliverables, plan a little more than you
think you need, and be prepared for the WBS and all its subsequent documents to evolve during
the life of the project. Upon completing the WBS, it logically leads to creating the list of activities,
the network diagram, and the Gantt chart.
There are numerous tutorials for creating Gantt charts, starting with a spreadsheet, which is a
useful first-time exercise, orspecific scheduling toolssuch as MS Project. The discussion below will
focus on the preparation needed in creating the inputs for a Gantt chart, rather than the mechanics
of building the chart using the software of your choice.
Once the WBS is generated, with the help of the project team, the next steps (Figure 10.3) move
this information to a schedule that will be used to monitor and manage the project. Since the WBS
is a hierarchy of deliverables, not tasks, the next step is to create a list of work packages or activities
that produce the deliverables. The activity/work packages can include one or more deliverables
that will be assigned to a single person for accountability purposes. The list of activities is then
numbered for ease of the next step. Activities are given a calendar duration to complete them and a
list of the prior activity names or numbers that must be performed before this activity can begin (or
finished), see Figure 10.4. A word of advice, in some situations, it may help in the communication

with others if you clarify the state of the deliverable in the activity description. In a sense, this is
clarifying what the successors are, which is not strictly required, but it can help with communica￾tion with team members.
For example, in a chemical engineering design, P&IDs are a key document that both initiate
many other discipline’s work and undergo continuous development; they are a living document.
The implication is that other people will begin using a P&ID at various stages of its completion and
will, in turn, contribute to the P&ID. For instance, the electrical department might use the P&IDs
at an early point in the project to count motors and determine electrical loads, the instrumentation
department may use them to estimate the number of control loops, and the piping department
may use them to build a line list (list of pipes). The mechanical department will use them to add
to the equipment list. Thus, the activity to draw the P&IDs needs to be broken into phases and
qualified with a state that others will understand and decide when their activities can begin. Typical
milestone states are IFR – issued for (internal, client, and hazard) review, IFE – issued for estimate,
IFD – issued for design, IFC – issued for construction, and As-Built. Another way to accomplish
this is to qualify the states as various %’s of the completed activity.
There are two approaches to creating the Gantt chart that are quite successful.
One approach is to gather the people responsible for creating the deliverables, give them each a
different colored pad ofsticky notes, and ask them to write down the activitiesthey need to perform
to create the deliverables (in most cases, each deliverable will convert to one activity), one activ￾ity per sticky note (Figure 10.4). Along with the activity description is the calendar duration (not
the number of work hours) that the activity will take to complete, and a list of any predecessors.
Planning in units of weeks or days usually makes sense, but any duration can be accommodated.
Any task that islongerthan weeksis probably one that would benefit from being broken into stages
for easier tracking.
A little aside, choosing a calendar duration is less straightforward than it appears because you
can be constrained to hit certain dates or constrained by your available resources. The duration can
be determined using either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. A top-down approach looks at
the overall deadline for the project and estimatesthe activity needsto occur over a certain period of
time, and resources are allocated to achieve that date. A bottom-up approach looks at the “effort”
hours it takes to complete a task and divides it by say eight hours per day to determine the calendar
duration, but it does not consider the following:
● A task can be completed by multiple people. It is worth noting that there is a limit to how many
people can be applied to a task to decrease the calendar duration. More people may slow the task
down.
● The number of people working on the task may change during the calendar duration.
● The hours per day people spend on the task may change from day to day. You may spend a few
hours a day on the task at the beginning, eight hours a day in the middle, and a few hours toward
the end.
● There may be gaps in when the work is being completed, and this could be handled by breaking
the task into subtasks.10.4 Phases of a Project 145
You can assume some average work hours per day are spent on an activity, or there are advanced
scheduling toolsthat accommodate nonconstantresource loadings, but it is probably best to decou￾ple the two concepts and use your experience to monitor calendar progress and effort hour progress
separately. To determine the duration using a bottom-up approach, look at the activity and the work
hours needed, make an assumption about the number of people available to work on the activity
and how many hours per day they will be able to work, and use a safe percentage of that. Try to
check with other projects to see if that duration makes sense.
It is entirely possible a top-down approach is being asked for by the management to achieve
particular dates, and you must use a bottom-up approach to determine the reasonableness of the
resources that are needed to achieve this. Remember, there is often a limit to how many people can
simultaneously work on a particular task.
The sticky notes are placed on a wall, or long roll of paper (the name of the meeting has been
called a “brown paper exercise”), in the order in which they can be completed. Where one activity
requires another to be completed (has a predecessor), an arrow is drawn from the “finish” of the
predecessor to the “start” of the next activity. This is called a Finish to Start (FS) relationship. More
complicated relationships can be defined (see Portny 2022). You will have a Network Diagram at
the end of this. Add in the start date, use some software, and the Gantt chart is the result. At that
point, you can check to see when the project finishes and compare it with the needed date for
completion. The Gantt chart can be used to further understand the critical path and modify or
optimize it accordingly.
A second way to create a Gantt chart that works well for small teams is to gather the deliver￾ables and create a list of activities and calendar durations in a spreadsheet. You can copy those
two columns into project planning software (e.g. MS Project) and then add the predecessors. The
software will create a network diagram, and the Gantt chart and find the critical path, and you can
proceed to optimize the schedule as needed.
You can imagine your vacation trip itinerary is the schedule developed from the list of the
locations and hotels you wish to visit, your WBS. A budget can then be developed with a list of
quoted and estimated costs (airfare ticket quotes, hotel costs, rental car costs, and possibly you
have peeked at the restaurant menus and the prices). There will still be some known unknown
estimated costs, like additional taxi costs or snorkel trips, so you add some design allowance, and
there may be some unknown unknowns, so you add some contingency to both the budget and
the schedule (plan to leave the airport early to accommodate unknown delays). Larsen (2005)
discussed known unknowns, and unknown unknowns in the context of chemical engineering
projects, as does Chapter 9 of this book. Unknowns and assumptions logically lead to the risk plan.
There are several possible components in a project plan (Figure 10.2), such as budget and sched￾ule, but the Risk Plan is a source of confusion with engineers and especially chemical engineers
who are familiar with process hazard analysis tools. While some authors indicate that a process
hazard analysis is a risk plan, that is not completely correct. Portny (2022) described the project
planning phase as answering two questions: “Can the project be done? and should the project
be done?”
The first question, “Can the project be done?”, is answered by an analysis of available versus
required resources, budget, timeline, assumptions, and other risk factors using a risk analysis and
management tool like a risk registry. In the travel example, if the trip involved a small boat trip
to a remote island in a location that was prone to hurricanes, there is a very real possibility that
you might not get to the destination (weather is a risk factor). Similarly, for an engineering project,
there are numerous risk factors that you may need to understand to ensure you can complete the
project as required in the project plan. For instance, if the project is to deliver a written report,146 10 Project Management
you may not ever find information that is needed because it does not exist, or you do not have the
budget to obtain the information.If it is a chemical plant that will need permits or other elementsto
complete it, they may not be granted (politicsis a risk factor). These are risksthat you cannot deliver
what is required (the report, the plant, the product, etc.) to meet the project objectives. To answer
the question, “Can the project be done?”, conducting a risk analysis of the project’s execution, via
brainstorming or a checklist using a risk register, is advisable.
The second question is about whether you should deliver the project? This is the more familiar
risk analysis chemical engineers deal with. If the project creates an unacceptable societal or safety
hazard, then the answer is no, or at least the design needs to change so it is acceptable. This second
question is answered by a process hazard analysis, an environmental review, in the case of a chem￾ical project, or other tools such as FMEA and FTA for product development projects, and strategic
review of the project as a whole.
Hence, while the first question answers to the execution of the project and thus should be part
of the project plan, the second question is both integral to the design development and the project
plan. You need to be able to say, “Yes, we can” and “Yes, we should” deliver this project before
continuing to the execution phase.
A third type of review(s), a design review, answers the question, are we making the best plant or
product possible? That question would be answered by reviews that include the following:
● design reviews,
● construction reviews,
● design for manufacturing analysis,
● Quality Function Deployment (QFD) analysis, and so forth.
While these last reviews are a normal part of the optimization of the design, they are a significant
element of planning by deciding what the final design will be.
There are more documents that PMI advises are part of the project planning stages, which we
will discuss below, but as you can see, the essence of project planning is easy to relate to any type
of project. Portny (2022) discussed additional elements for effective project execution.
The project plan is finalized at the end of the planning phase and involves a detailed outlin￾ing of the project’s scope, objectives, timelines, cost estimates, resources, risk management plans,
and communication strategies (Figure 10.2). The objective of the planning phase is to establish a
roadmap for the project team to follow, ensuring all project activities are aligned to achieve the
project goals within the defined constraints.
However, it is important to note that while the project plan is “finalized” at the end of the plan￾ning phase, it is notset in stone.In reality, the project plan is a living document that may be revisited
and revised throughout the project lifecycle. Changesin projectscope, unexpected risks, orshiftsin
stakeholder requirements can necessitate updates to the plan. Effective PM requires flexibility and
responsiveness to such changes, with appropriate adjustments made to the project plan as needed,
following established change management processes.
Therefore, while the project plan is initially finalized at the end of the planning phase, it remains
subject to review and revision to accommodate changes and ensure the projectstays on track toward
its objectives. This process is often called management of change.
In the chemical industry, there are specific “deliverables” at the end of the front-end engineering
that are discussed in Chapters 2 and 9, throughout this book, and below.
At logical points in the project, you have an ever-increasing knowledge and confidence in what
you plan to do, what the final deliverables will be (Scope), what the cost of the project will be
(Budget), what the timing/schedule will be (Schedule), and whether you are likely to meet the10.5 Business Phases of a Project 147
project’s objectives. At key points in time, projects pause to make a decision. Does this project meet
the project objectives? For the vacation trip, will it be relaxing, will there be some good restaurants,
will you be on a beach, and will it likely cost lessthan $5000? Thisis called a Stage Gate Review. If
the objectives are reasonably sure to be met, and there are no other issues, you proceed to the next
stage gate, or the Execution Phase. If the objectives are not met, then you have a choice to stop
the project (not go on vacation) or recycle the project by looking at different options and possibly
alter some objectives and constraints.
At the end of the planning phase, the decision is made to move forward with the project or not.
10.4.3 Execution Phase
Execution implies you are proceeding with the project. Money is being spent, commitments are
being made, and details are being finalized that could not or did not need to be done in the planning
phase, and you are following your plan to completion.
For the trip, you start booking airline tickets, reserving hotels and restaurants, and monitoring
that the actual expenses are what you expected them to be in the estimate. Last-minute design
details are performed, such as getting your bags packed now that you know where you are going,
for how long, and that you will be snorkeling and sitting on the beach, and a last-minute check
of the weather to assess your clothes for the duration. You hop in a taxi and off you go according
to your plan with some minor changes as might be necessary. When you come back, you should
complete the project closing phase.
In theory, the project would be formally approved at the end of FEL III and thus would proceed
to detailed design. However, quite often, there is enough confidence in the FEL II estimate, the
economics, and the design thatsome long-lead items will be ordered, and some construction items,
such as site preparation, will begin.
10.4.4 Project Closing Phase
In the travel analogy, you might review your initiating process and see if there were any objectives
that you missed early on. Perhaps you forgot that in the back of your mind, you wanted to make sure
the beach location had calm water for swimming. You look at your estimate and see if it matches
your actual expenditures and review your process for making an estimate. You might review what
went well during the trip, jot down some notes and create a checklist for a future experience, and
even pass that information along to others who are doing something similar.
10.5 Business Phases of a Project
Before getting into specific details of executing chemical engineering design projects, we will exam￾ine how chemical plant capital projects fit within the context of bringing a new chemical product
to market.
The steps from product discovery to production are discussed by Berg (2011) and in Figure 10.5,
to which the FEL phases of engineering asset development have been added. The diagram illus￾trates the parallel path that often happens in product development to accelerate an idea to market
and certainly appliesto other products, with prototyping and customer verification as key elements
of the development. You can imagine the diagram below broken into many interconnected busi￾ness, research and development, and engineering (sub)projects to reach the end goal.148 10 Project Management

There is a natural conflict between the goal to define a project so well that changes will not
affect cost and schedule, and a project that is able to, or must, innovate in some way as it proceeds
(Ben Mahmoud-Jouini 2016). This conflict is especially prevalent in design projects where the cus￾tomer, market, and thus the product have not been established. Recognize, though, that change
occurs in every project, and PMI practices provide systems to manage the changes. Larsen (2005),
Berg (2011), Karol (2002A&B), and Eldon (2005) discussed the challenges of executing Research
and Develoment (R&D) projects. The Independent Project Analysis (IPA) company provides a
consulting service to improve the PM practices of companies in the chemical industry. An excel￾lent introduction to their methods is presented in Understanding Cost Growth and Performance
Shortfalls in Pioneer Process Plants (Merrow 1981). Three other articles in that series complete the
background and are relevant today for understanding cost growth issues in plant designs. The IPA
methods can help with risk management and can provide contingency planning for chemical engi￾neering projects (see Chapter 9).
10.6 Engineering Project Phases
Chemical engineering projects that are executed in phases or stage gates (Front End I, FE II, FE
III, or similar name) enable efficient classification of viable and nonviable projects with a mini￾mum of engineering costs and time. The tools of capital costing discussed in the previous chapter
allow decisions to be made earlier and can help focus the project on the factors that make the most10.7 Project Initiation: Project Charter and Project Business Objectives 149

difference to its viability. If technology and financial issues can be identified early on, changes can
be made to the design that will have a minimum effect on cost and schedule (Figure 10.6), thus
allowing for greater innovation and more efficient use of available funds.
The stage-gate process allows for innovation while minimizing engineering costs by deciding at
each phase whetherto pause,recycle, orstop in situations when the cost,schedule, or performance
objectives cannot be met. The process also helps to communicate issues to the management level
more quickly. Many projects are shelved during the review process, thus incurring only the engi￾neering design cost to that point. The deliverables that typically accompany these stage gates are
discussed below.
10.7 Project Initiation: Project Charter and Project Business
Objectives
The Project Charter or business objectives is written by the primary stakeholder (the business per￾son) explaining the need for the project. What is the problem to be solved, or what opportunity
is to be capitalized upon? An “objective” needs to be defined, along with any constraints (such as
time, money, performance, etc.). The best projects clearly articulate the challenge or “customer pain
point,” enabling designersto explore a wide range ofsolutions. However, considering other projects
might explore alternative options, setting exclusions could be beneficial to narrow the scope and
expedite the project’s progress. If there is a great deal of information that must be communicated
in an engineering project, then typically a more detailed document (basic data or project briefing
document) will accompany the shorter project charter. Read (2015) and Pavone (2006) discussed
basic data for chemical projects in more detail.
Objectives of the project should be formulated to be “SMART,” which is to say they are spe￾cific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound. Objectives can be tangible (a report or a
chemical plant), but they can also be non-tangible, like increase production by 10% of the current
production rate (× kg h−1) within one month of start-up. Deliverables should only be tangible (the
facility, the report, etc.).150 10 Project Management
Taking the authoring of a report as an example, approaching it as a project employs a similar
process. Understanding the report’s purpose, its audience, and usage provides crucial insights for
the authors as they consider the necessary content. Similarly, engineers designing products and
processes must identify the end users and their requirements. The project initiator might also need
to specify needs and opportunities during project initiation, so be aware that the initiation phase is
often iterative with all the stakeholders.
10.8 Project Initiation for Chemical Engineering Projects
The Initiation phase for a chemical engineering project should include a basic data document.
Pavone (2006) discussed the general topic of project initiation. Basic data begins at initiation
and ends at the planning stage and will contain constraints and objectives that are driven by the
following:
● Internal:
⚬ sales needs, plant reliability, labor availability and skills, etc.,
⚬ financial goals,
⚬ the physical plant location, and
⚬ utilities, existing infrastructure, or lack thereof, transportation methods, raw materialsources,
and weather.
● External:
⚬ customer requirements,
⚬ legal and intellectual property,
⚬ environmental,
⚬ government regulatory,
⚬ goodwill with neighbors and other societal needs, or ethical factors, and
⚬ sustainability.
The project initiation documents should include the objectives and constraints that are known.
This might include known customer quality requirements for the product, and growth plans for its
production. Why? A designer can decide to size pipes a little bit larger for an easier plant expansion
at minimal expense or to keep the cost of maintenance spares to a minimum if initial capital cost is
more important than plant uptime and reliability. This stage of the project will likely involve many
unanswered questions, but tabling as many of those questions as early as possible will provide a
facility that achieves objectives earlier and more cheaply.
The project initiation documentsshould include an evolving list ofstakeholders, those categories
or groups of people who will have input into the project and have needs or constraints. In the chem￾ical engineering domain, this might include identifying legal and regulatory groups, operations and
maintenance groups, community groups, and downstream users.
Glavic (2021) described the future “Circular Economy” involving product manufactures (includ￾ing chemical producers) taking responsibility for the end-of-life destruction of their products. This
possible future requirement affects the overall economics of producing a product and, ultimately,
the design of a process that economically and socially prioritizes reuse or recycling options ahead
of destruction. Objectives, such as zero discharge plants, are key to the design planning process.
It is normal to create an initial list of people (or functions, e.g. environmental group, utilities
group, maintenance group, and the general public) who need to be consulted or informed dur￾ing the project definition phase. This list will grow and change over time and into the execution10.9 Chemical Engineering Project Planning 151
or construction phase of the project, but certainly it is important to include other people in the
definition of most projects.
A RACI chart (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), and sometimes linear respon￾sibility chart, is a useful tool for defining what team members are responsible for on the project
throughout its execution.
10.9 Chemical Engineering Project Planning
The project plan for a chemical engineering project will need to contain the elements described by
Pavone (2006) in his article about the “How to Prepare a Process Design Basis,” which is not a PMI
term, but the elements overlap with a PMI project plan requirement. Some of those elements, as
indicated in the article, are necessary at the initiation phase, and some may be completed as part of
the front-end engineering. Review the list and upgrade the project plan during the planning phase
as necessary.
A flow diagram for completing the FEL I process engineering design stepsisshown in Figure 10.7.
The primary objective of these stepsisto create a technical, economic, and safety risk analysis of the
processidea. Should there be options, alternatives, or optimizationsthat need to be considered, and
they can be assessed as a part of these steps or complete cycles. FEL II and III would add additional
deliverables and definition based on these, such as line lists, line sizing, instrument data sheets,
relief valve sizing, further hazard and environmental analysis, and layouts, providing progressively
more information for other disciplines to perform their estimates and thus accuracy to the capital
and operating estimates of the business analysis.
At the beginning, the project is initiated with the business objectives, basic data, and sometimes
a block flow diagram or PFD. For a heat and material balance to be prepared, usually with a simu￾lation or model, several actions need to be performed:
● If there is a reaction occurring, the reaction equations and kinetic data must be determined.
● The molecular species that need to be tracked in the simulation need to be identified, and an
appropriate physical property model/library/methods must be selected and possibly checked.
● Identifying the information you wish to obtain from the completed simulation may guide what
species you model and to what level of rigor. Species that do not already exist in the simulator
can usually be added, but it may take some time to obtain the relevant physical property data,
and some expertise to fit the data to the physical property equations.
● Determining the property package to be used can be challenging. Guidelines provided by the
simulator vendor will help. Checking the predictions of the property package may be necessary.
Ultimately, it is worth recognizing that the materials are virtual, and thus, only the properties
that matter to the simulation you are preparing need to be modeled accurately.
● It might not be possible or desirable to model all that is within the process. Small contaminants
that do not significantly contribute to the heat and material balance, but may cause corrosion or
catalyst issues could be dealt with outside of the simulation. Unusual unit operations or equip￾ment may need to be modeled in a simpler fashion in the simulation software, leaving the details
for manual material balance calculations, or the equipment sizing. However, others need to be
made aware of the simplifications that may exist in the simulation model, so documentation
is key.
● While pressure drops can be modeled in process simulations, most people choose to only model
the major groupings of pressures and leave the piping and gravitational pressure changesforlater
analysis (see process rationalization) and refined further once equipment sizes are available.152 10 Project Management

● The process of finalizing the simulation may undergo several iterations that attempt to optimize
it (perhaps by comparing the capital costs to the operating costs). Therefore, there may need to
be a route to the economic analysis that bypasses some steps (detailed equipment sizing, P&IDs,
or hazard analysis) only to iterate back and complete these steps in a later design cycle.
● The simulation can be used laterin the design process(once vessel volumes and so on are known)
to assess control system ideas and tune controllers.
Owing to the simulation having some simplifications (e.g. not including pressure drops, or miss￾ing some chemical components, and the need to check the simulation for errors), a step we call
“simulation rationalization” produces a final material balance/PFD should be completed to iden￾tify and deal with issuesthat matterin equipmentselection,sizing, and further process design. This
may be documented with a final PFD and material balance in a spreadsheet. A reliability strategy
will guide you toward what equipment (rotating equipment, holdup tanks, etc.) must be spared
and must be shown on the P&IDs.
Arguably, copying the simulation material balance information into a spreadsheet by hand is
superfluous and time-consuming, but adding the equipment needed in the simulation rational￾ization into a final PFD is very much necessary. Both are usually required to promote effective10.9 Chemical Engineering Project Planning 153
communication with others, especially later. An idea of equipment sizes and a rough elevation
from the layout of equipment can provide an excellent basis for preliminary pump sizing.
The selection of materials of construction should be completed before equipment is costed and
should consider the possibility of corrosive chemicals in the process that may not have been mod￾eled in the simulation, especially in situations where those chemicals can build up in concentration.
Equipment is usually sized using a combination of:
● Manual methods using a spreadsheet or, preferably, Mathcad. Mathcad is adept at catching errors
due to its handling of units and its paper calculation look that shows the equations being used.
● Software programs, such as for sizing heat exchangers, tower trays, fans, etc., provided by a sim￾ulation software provider, vendors, or other third parties.
● Vendor or in-house sizing software and methods for specialized equipment such as tower inter￾nals, compressor sizing, and so forth.
Although not strictly called for during the early FEL stages, P&IDs are invaluable for instru￾ment engineers and other disciplines to prepare their estimates. They enable the preparation of
more accurate cost estimatesfor control hardware, process plant computer hardware, and software,
as well as better estimates for the piping, electrical, and civil disciplines. P&IDs can help identify
items that might be overlooked or excluded from an equipment factored estimate. Depending on
the size of the project, the need for other disciplines to contribute to the FEL II and FEL III, and
the need for vendor information, some aspects of the P&IDs are completed at different stages of a
project, but in general, the P&IDs will be completed according to the following steps:
First draft P&IDs include the following:
● all known equipment and controls,
● the basic control scheme, including interlocks,
● known standard piping details, such as bypasses on pumps, and control valves,
● known critical dimensions as determined by the process engineer (e.g. elevations for NPSH,
mixing or separation that are inline, etc.),
● known drains and vents around equipment,
● secondary containment,
● relief valve locations,
● process lines, drain and fill lines, and utility lines, and
● vendor package scope demarcation and known vendor requirements for utilities.
Issued for Engineering Internal/Engineering Review:
● Updates from the internal review are made and issued for client review.
Issued for Client Review (including operations and maintenance input):
● Updates from the client review and/or response to questions from the review,
● prehazard review notes and operation notes are added, and
● in the event, the project is performed solely as an owner arrangement, not a contractor/owner
situation, and the P&IDs are issued and reviewed with the stakeholders, maintenance, and oper￾ation people.
Prehazard Review Activities(line numbers and instrument numbers are required forthe HAZOP
method):
● Line numbers,
● instrument numbers and details, and
● off-page connectors match.154 10 Project Management
Issued for Hazard Review (HAZOP):
● Updates from the Hazard Review are addressed, and drawings may be issued.
● In situations where there are unresolved design aspects either from the PHA, from vendors, or
otherwise, the affected areas are clouded and put “on-hold for …” to denote the design details
will be completed at a later date.
Estimate Preparation (supporting discipline factored estimates with some takeoff type estimates):
● Vendor data as available is added.
● Line sizes, pipe specifications, and insulation requirements suitable for the line list and factored
estimate by piping, as well as input for piping stress analysis. In some situations, piping stress
analysis may be completed forsome linesin FEL III, with the remaining pipe analysis being done
during detailed design.
● Motor sizes (may be documented on the equipment list instead of the P&ID), but the elec￾trical discipline usually maintains their own motor list that coincides with their single line
diagrams.
● Equipment sizes and weights (may be documented on the equipment list instead of the P&ID).
Different companies have differing philosophies with respect to how much information will be
placed on the P&IDs about equipment for intellectual property security purposes.
● Relief valve disposal system.
● Utility P&IDs will likely be started at this stage and completed during detailed design.
P&IDs issued for estimate (FEL II, III, or Design)*:
Depending on the owner/engineering firm culture, the end of the FEL II stage may approve the
project to purchase long lead equipment and do site preparation. Thus, engineering disciplines
such asinstrumentation, piping, electrical, and civil (pipe bridges) will ask forthe P&IDsto have
a reasonable level of completion for their (factored) estimates. For instance, instrumentation’s
early estimate method may count control loops from the P&IDs and assume some average cost
per control loop for hardware and distributed control system (DCS) configuration.
The FEL III estimate will utilize more material takeoffs, possibly with some factored estimating,
and thus requires better P&ID definition than the previous design phase. During the detailed
design phase, a “Construction Control Estimate” is produced based on a complete bill of mate￾rials and material takeoffs; however, the expectation is that the estimate will not change signifi￾cantly from the FEL III, or even the FEL II values. Thus, disciplines will push to have as much
design definition to base their estimates on as early as possible.
In other situations, especially for smaller projects, the project approval may happen at the “issued
for design” phase, in which case some P&ID details above may move out to coincide with
that stage.
P&IDs issued for construction:
● These are issued to the construction contractor as the approved final design.
P&IDs issued as-built:
● Inevitably, there are changes that occur during construction, start-up, and commissioning, and
these changes need to be updated on the P&IDs, so the plant records are up to date. Some
changes occur because the design will leave small bore piping, heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC) ducts, electrical wiring conduit, etc., to be field run by the contractor. This
can sometimes affect the overall design in minor ways. Alternatively, the construction contractor10.9 Chemical Engineering Project Planning 155
may see opportunities to reduce costs either by constructing the project in a different way than
was imagined, or through design changes. These construction changes can be opportunities
for reducing costs as long as the integrity of the design is not compromised. A thorough review
of the final project is required, and the as-built P&IDs are a part of that final review and
sign-off.
During FEL 1 and II, a tool such as SketchUp and a prebuilt library of process equipment (even
just simple cubes) can be used by a process engineer to quickly generate a rough 3D equipment
layout model of the plant (without including piping) in a surprisingly short period of time. That
model can guide the proper plant layout and provide significant insight during early process hazard
analysis studies. A model is especially helpful if placed in the plant location via Google Earth for
assessing off-site hazard consequences.
Process hazard analysisstudiesshould begin at the FEL I/PFD stage. Knowledge of the chemicals
and reactions that are present, approximate operating conditions, and possibly a heat and material
balance will provide an adequate amount of information for this review. Substituting hazardous
chemicals and operating conditionsto make the processless hazardous via an inherentsafety anal￾ysis during this early phase of design can save a great deal of engineering and capital costs later.
A checklist hazard review is also appropriate at this stage. The process hazard analysis (PHA) may
develop a list of questions that need to be answered as part of further design development.
The next phase of process hazard analysis should take place when P&IDs are available. Owing
to the ease of creating a 3D model with simple tools (e.g. SketchUp), it is advisable to have a draft
of the 3D model for reference. PHA methods such as checklists, HAZOPs, and so forth make sense
at this point. Major safety issues identified and dealt with early, can be done so without causing
significant design changes to other disciplines, thus keeping the cost of changes to a minimum.
Using the material balance and PFD, the equipment list can then be developed in combination
with sizing calculations, discussions with vendors as necessary, and a materials of construction
review. Subsequently, equipment data sheets and the equipment list evolve together. Pricing the
equipment list via vendor quotes is preferable but not always practical during the early stages of
the design. Where vendor quotes are not practical, cost equations or in-house costing methods can
be used.
With the deliverables described above, an overall economic model including utilities, raw mate￾rials, product sales, and capital costs can be developed and analyzed. Where there is uncertainty
in some variables, a Monte Carlo analysis can be performed, and a range of economic values (net
present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR)) can be developed along with probabilities
(see Chapter 9).
10.9.1 Chemical Engineering Deliverable Time Requirements
It is difficult to determine how many hours it will take to prepare the chemical engineer’s deliv￾erables in a design project. The hours can vary significantly if the project is a modification of
an existing design or a novel design, which is likely to have many unforeseen challenges. Other
disciplines often rely on the capital or total engineering costs to determine their engineering esti￾mate. Often, the chemical engineer’s work is significantly complete before a capital cost estimate
is complete for a project. The timing makes using historical budgets or hours difficult based on the
project’s overall cost. Below we provide some guidance for estimating the hoursfor different design
situations.
If there is an estimate for the project, either a capital estimate or an engineering estimate, the
following guidance can be used. A process department budget is commonly 2.5% to 8% (average156 10 Project Management
5%) of the engineering costs, which is, in turn, about 12% to 30%, with an average of around 15% to
17% (12% in past years). Lower percentages (12%) for larger projects that are proven technologies,
and higher numbers (20% to 30%) for small projects and/or unproven technologies of the total
installed project costs. About 50% to 80% of the process engineering budget costs would be spent
by the time stage gate III is complete.
If the design development isto the stage where a known number of P&IDsfor the project is avail￾able, the total process department budget can be estimated to be 150 hours/P&ID. This includes all
process engineering tasks such as data sheets, equipment lists, preparing P&IDs, hazard reviews,
etc. Bear in mind, there can be exceptions. A revamp job may only require a single P&ID, but the
fact that it interfaces with X other existing P&IDs will make the process hazard analysis X+1 times
more involved than it might appear.
Another method is to draw a rough process flow diagram and estimate the hours based on the
number and type of unit operations present. You can assume one major piece of equipment per
P&ID, and 150 hours/P&ID. The PFDs at an early stage in design tend not to have included all
the equipment so add some margin (say 20%) to this and consider the need for utility P&IDs. One
project manager has observed that typically, about 10% of additional equipment items are added to
the P&IDs after stage gate III (during detailed design).
Alternatively, you can build the estimate from the ground up using the guidelines below. While
we have tried to use our experience to give you some idea of the time required to develop the deliv￾erables in the table and notes below, the specific situation at hand must be considered.
Table 10.1 and the following notes provide some experiential guidance for estimating process
design engineering hours. In general, effort hours are described rather than the required durations
for a schedule. To convert effort hoursto durations, it is suggested that you sum the various activity
effort hours, round up to the nearest day and add 15% to 20% overhead to the task.
Notes: If a process simulation or other computer-based heat and material balance is utilized, the
following primary steps of producing that deliverable will require varying amounts of work:
Preparation – Step 0: Preparation includes determining objectives of simulation work, determin￾ing components, process topography hand sketch, and listing constraints and objectives.
Decide what information the model needs to provide in its finished state and what questions
need to be answered by the modeling. This can be a little more insidious than it might appear at
first glance. Give it some thought, and if necessary, ask yourself, “What if I had that information
today? What would I do with it?” Often further questions are uncovered in this way.
Physical properties – Step 1: Decide what chemical components will be included in the model.
Decide if one property package in the simulation will suffice, or if there will need to be a break in
the simulation with a second property package being used (that often adds significant complexity
to the model when recycles are present). The location of recycles can make or break the easy con￾vergence of a simulation. Check to see if the components you want to model have the needed data
for the property package you want to use, or if you will need to obtain and input that data into the
program. This may require library and possibly laboratory research, followed by property package
curve fitting and integration.
A duration of longer than 1 to 2 weeks indicates there is significant missing thermodynamic
information, and a separate R&D subproject might be required.
The shorter duration occurs when you have significant experience and confidence with the
components, operating conditions, and type of system that will be modeled.
Longer durations occur when the chemicals and operating conditions are not familiar and/or
there is the possibility of azeotropes, or other situations that may require that you generate binary
coefficients and check them. The assumption is that literature values are available, accurate, and
reliable.10.9 Chemical Engineering Project Planning 157

Table 10.1 illustrates an example of of estimating the hours from an initial PFD that is expected to contain 2
distillation units, 5 heat exchangers, 5 pumps, 9 separators, 1 reactor, 2 storage tanks, and 2 recycles in the process.160 10 Project Management
Reactions – Step 2:Identify what chemicalreactions you will, and will not, model (rememberthis
forthe simulation rationalization step). Heterogeneous catalysts might be reported in the literature
in waysthat may not be consistent with the equations used by the simulator(free volume vsreactor
volume vs mass basis). Determining reaction rates, reaction equilibrium coefficients, inhibiting or
poisoning conditions, and checking the simulator output can take substantial amounts of time in
our experience (a week to a month duration). If it is more than a couple of weeks in time, then you
may need an alternative approach because the data simply is not there for you to proceed. You may
need to model the system using a conversion reactor with an assumed conversion and come back
to the reactor design later.
A duration of more than 1 to 2 weeks indicates significant missing reaction information, and a
separate R&D subproject is likely required.
Consider using conversion or equilibrium reaction schemes to speed up this task while simulta￾neously developing necessary kinetic-type reaction modeling.
Heterogeneous catalyst modeling requires significant effort hours prior to modeling and check￾ing the reaction kinetics against laboratory data.
Build the simulation – Step 3: The time required to build a simulation and converge it is affected
by variables such as the number and type of unit operations in combination with the property
package. Whether or how many distillation towers are present (one to three days per tower). How
many recycles are in the simulation (one day per recycle), and how many other unit operations are
present (one hour per exchanger, pump, compressor, and vap/liq separator). The property pack￾age can affect how stable the solutions are in complex operations like towers. Typically, once the
simulation is first converged, there are numerous days spent tweaking inputs to check and obtain
the desired product flows and compositions. Optimization studies typically take a week or more
per study to run the various cases, perform calculations on the output variables, and assess the
economics.
Hours expended as part of doing equipment data sheets are considered part of the data
sheet hours.
10.9.2 Process Modeling Using a Spreadsheet
In circumstances that either do not lend themselves to using a commercial simulator or that
are straightforward, engineers sometimes elect to use a spreadsheet to create a process model.
Typically, this is a week or so per major piece of equipment. Tweaking, checking, improvements,
and automation will probably consume a month.
Spreadsheet models are often based on an existing processfrom which you can retrieve operating
data. Physical property calculations are complicated to include, so there is a tendency not to use a
spreadsheet if extensive physical property data is required in the modeling.
Batch processes are often modeled using a spreadsheet, although there are commercial batch
process simulators that provide scheduling.
10.9.3 Process Modeling via Custom Programming Language
These models are used when commercial simulators do not provide adequate modeling features.
Specialized property data or special equipment are examples where a custom model might be
preferred. Refer to the chapter on modeling.
Sometimes, a custom model can be combined with a commercial simulator to achieve the
objectives.10.9 Chemical Engineering Project Planning 161
10.9.4 Simulation Rationalization
This deliverable istypically not discussed by other design texts, orit isinferred in the preparation of
a PFD. Our experience isthat it helpsto separate it into a definite step. The purpose isto convert the
simulator output to a document(s) that further design work can proceed with, such as equipment
sizing and P&IDs. It typically involves a hydraulics analysis to add pumps or compressors due to
simplifications or lack of elevation or piping pressure drop information in the simulation. Storage
tanks and other outside battery limits equipment should be considered for inclusion. Temporary
process holdup should also be considered at this time. It should include at least a brief check of the
simulation heat and material balance and document any further simplifications in the simulation
that need to be addressed “manually” by the process engineer. Reactions that were ignored should
be addressed. This usually takes a small percentage of the time to prepare the simulation (a few
days or 10 to 25% of the time required to prepare the simulation), but situations vary. The result of
the simulation rationalization is a PFD drawn with all the necessary equipment to continue with
the design, and the simulation material balance with notes, or a final material balance prepared
by hand.
10.9.5 Final PFD and Material Balance
If deemed necessary, and it usually is, the simulation rationalization and the simulation model may
need to be combined and transcribed into a final spreadsheet material balance and PFD. Hours
spent transcribing the simulation output can sometimes be reduced with export functions.
10.9.6 P&IDs
P&IDs are the gateway for other disciplines to get started on the facility design. They become
authored by numerous groups, but the process engineer is ultimately responsible for signing off
on them to ensure safety and adherence to the proper design. They are a living document, so the
hours spent on them extend throughout the project, and it can be challenging to estimate how
many hours are needed over the project’s life. In addition to the core process P&IDs, utility P&IDs
are usually needed. Also, developing P&ID lead sheets keep everyone speaking the same language
because there is often some latitude in interpreting ISA P&ID symbology standards. We have also
found that creating a P&ID map, which isjust a block flow diagram of P&IDs, has helped to organize
and find drawings in a large project with many P&IDs.
Preparatory work includes a marked-up PFD with controls and usually some rough sketches.
Assuming you have a PFD with the basic control scheme sketched out, the initial drawing of a
P&ID is about 4 hours per frame; the quickest method isto hand draw them on 17 × 22” paper, with
usually one piece of equipment per drawing. The remaining effort is spent reviewing and updating
them with items such as details of the instrumentation (seals, isolation valves, interlocks, alarms,
and controller interactions), piping line numbers, pipe codes, manual valves, specification breaks,
integrating operation maintenance, and safety review comments, and vendor data as it becomes
available. More time will be taken during detailed design in reviewing vendor equipment and mak￾ing the P&IDs consistent with vessel nozzle schedules, specifying critical locations or dimensions
on the drawings and other details.
Materials of construction analysis is best done in combination with a process metallurgist
who is familiar with the site and the utilities present. The operating conditions and chemical
species, along with the PFD, are passed to them along with a process description that should be162 10 Project Management
adequate for them to understand any unusual situations that might be present. Small component
concentrations and less common operating conditions (start-up, shutdown, cleaning, hydro￾static testing with water, and relief conditions), or cycling can cause corrosion, fatigue, and
premature failure. The RAND report mentioned above will convince you of the importance of
spending adequate time discussing this analysis with operations, maintenance, and the process
metallurgist.
10.9.7 Equipment Sizing Calculations
The hours for these can also vary significantly. Vendors can be utilized to help size heat exchang￾ers, but a check of their calculations is prudent. Sometimes more process simulation work will be
necessary. Distillation column internals are typically the task of the vendors, but some checking
calculations are a wise thing to do. Pumps, knockout vessels, and simple holdup tanks might take
about 4–8 hoursto complete the data sheet for vendor costing, but there are a significant number of
hours spent checking vendor-submitted drawings against the P&IDs and other drawings, so allow
for 20–50 hours. Reactors, solid flow equipment, and other equipment can take 20–60 hours, or
more. If you have never sized a pump, it can take you 40 hours to do one, but with practice, you
can get the calculations and a data sheet done in 3 or 4 hours, with the rest of the time required
(15–25) for vendor drawings, verifying the final piping design against your assumptions around
piping fittings and checking the NPSH and so forth.
10.9.8 Line List
A process engineeris necessary to create and maintain their portion of the line list. Thisis a list of all
pipes, their operating conditions, their maximum operating conditions, the pipe specs, insulation
requirements, and so forth. Budget 5–15 minutes per line, assuming you have all the information
at your fingertips. In revamp jobsin which owners do not have up-to-date pipe codes or P&IDs, you
can expect to spend time in the plant reading valve model numbers and working with mechanical
integrity people.
10.9.9 Relief Valves
Relief valve calculations can be 8 hours for a preliminary sizing in which you have done the sys￾tem design and the valve vents to the atmosphere, but more typically, about 40 hours is needed to
provide thorough documentation. Two hundred hours is not uncommon when a disposal system
is present, and relief valve variable back pressures need to be determined. The hours to complete
a set of relief valve calculations depend on the availability of information for existing equipment
(especially design pressures and temperatures), piping (especially pipe specs), instrumentation doc￾umentation, mechanical integrity information, and whether there is a common disposal header
system. Usually, a field visit is required to acquire the necessary data.
The process engineer’sjob isto communicate the design intent to others. Assuch, a good process
description is necessary (8–20 hours), and time allowance for informal and formal reviews with
other engineers, environmental, operations, maintenance, management, and so forth is essential
(15% of your time).References 163

Storage and Bulk Transport
In walking through a plant or in considering the sequence of a process, the first items encountered
are the storage facilitiesforincoming raw materials. While passive, these elementsrequire the same
careful consideration as any other piece of equipment. They come in variousforms and dimensions,
depending on the phase (or phases) of the materials, the required on-site inventory, the pressure
and pressure range to be handled, and the hazard of the material. These same considerations apply
to intermediate storage facilities through the process, as well as to storage of finished product.
The bulk transportation of raw materials to the plant also depends on the phase, rate, pressure,
and hazard rating. The chapter reviews storage and transport in turn.
11.1 Choose the Phase of the Material to be Stored
The phase (liquid, gas, and solid) of the material to be stored is usually dictated by the form it takes
at ambient pressures and temperatures. However, in some cases, it may make economic sense to
convert the material to another state for storage. For instance, in the case where large quantities of
gases are to be stored (greater than about 1500 std cu M), the liquefaction of the gas may become
economical. However, liquefaction of gases (in cryogenic storage) often involves allowing a portion
of the liquid to boil off to maintain temperature and pressure in the tank. The losses, or prevent￾ing them, from this type of storage system can make the system environmentally or economically
less desirable.
Other phases such as absorption onto solids, dissolving into a liquid, or conversion to solids via
chemical reaction may be considered.
11.2 Choose the Volume of Storage Required
Large use plants may utilize pipelines with minimal or no storage to supply the process. Railcars
may be temporarily used to store chemicals, thus reducing or eliminating on-site storage. Haz￾ardous chemicals may be enough of a safety liability that minimal storage is preferred or possibly
on-site or in situ production of the material should be used. Extremely hazardous chemicals may
require a secondary “de-inventory” storage tank in the event a problem develops in the primary
storage system. However, for average materials, the following guidelines may be used to determine
storage requirements.
Raw material storage is provided to ensure the plant never (or rarely) shuts down because
the raw materials are unavailable. Thus, the reliability of the supply system must be examined.

Baasel (1976) presented the following guidelines:
Amount of feedstock that should be kept on-site = (date delivered − date ordered)
× feed rate
Storage size = Max amount that COULD be present when delivery arrives
+ amount ordered
Example:
A plant requires 20 000 lb of feedstock per day. The supplier will guarantee shipping the order in
15 days of order receipt. The time to ship the material is anywhere between 2 and 5 days. The mode
of transport is 36 000 gal jumbo railcars. The specific gravity of the material is 0.85.
Solution:
Examine the two possibilities (no delays and maximum delay)
Maximum delay:
● Our plant takes 3 days to process our order (over a long weekend).
● The supplier ships 15 days after receipt of the order.
● The shipping takes 5 days to travel to site.
Thus, the amount of feedstock that should be on-site when the order is placed should be
(3 days + 15 days + 5 days) × 20 000 lb d−1 = 460 000 lb
No delays:
● A jumbo railcar (36 000 gal) could arrive in 2 days.
If the railcar arrives in 2 days, when we had 460 000 lb of material on-site at the time of order,
then the amount of storage we need on-site is
460 000 lb − 2 days′ transit × 20 000 lb d−1 + 36 000 gal (0.85 × 62.4 lb ft−3
∕7.48 gal ft−3
)
= 676 000 lb of storage (34 days)
The logistics of when a second railcar must be ordered is left to the reader.
Reliable and efficient supply chains and storage are topics of the following references:
Cabezas et al. (2015), Fiksel (2010), Fuller (2009), Goti et al. (2011), Thomas & Tong (2009), and
Vazquez-Esparragoza and Chen (2016).
11.3 Choose a Design Pressure
In the situation where a liquid is to be stored, there are two ways to approach the choice of design
pressure:
● by determining the maximum expected pressure in the tank due to fluid thermal cycling and
by designing above that, which prevents vapor losses but may require a custom design pressure
tank, or
● by arbitrarily choosing a design pressure for a standard tank and then dealing with the losses in
some other way (i.e. a vapor recovery system).11.3 Choose a Design Pressure 167
The normal day-to-night thermal cycling of a tank causesthe pressure in the tank to rise and fall.
If the tank has an opening to atmosphere, the increased pressure is dissipated by the gases (rich
with the fluid being stored) in the tank escaping. As the tank cools, the pressure drops and air is
drawn in to maintain the atmospheric pressure. The disadvantages of this practice are the emissions
to atmosphere as well as the introduction of possibly undesired oxygen, humidity, or other gasses
into the tank.
In such a freely vented tank, the factors that affect how much gas is expelled through the vent
are as follows:
(1) the change in the temperature in the vapor space,
(2) the change in the vapor pressure of the liquid (thus the change in the stored fluid temperature,
which is likely different than the vapor space temperature), and
(3) the change in the liquid level due to the change in the stored fluid temperature/density.
The above disadvantages can be mitigated by providing a conservation vent, consisting of a path
that opensto allow gasto leave at a higher-than-atmospheric pressure, and another path that opens
to allow air to enter at subatmospheric pressure. See Figure 11.1 for this device.
The design’s low-pressure threshold which determines the disk weight on the conservation
vent’s vacuum side should be slightly below atmospheric (i.e. 1/2 oz/sq in). This is because
standard tanks have limited resistance to crushing pressure. From this low-pressure limit, we
calculate the highest anticipated pressure based on the factors mentioned. If the conservation
vent’s high-pressure limit exceeds this value (and assuming the tank can handle this pressure),

there will be no vapor losses (Figure 11.1b). Regardless, conservation vents help minimize these
losses.
If the material is valuable or if it is hazardous, then the outflow should be directed to a holding
tank, possibly with a condenser so that the material can be returned to the tank. The EPA states
tanks can economically justify vaporrecovery systemsto avoid breathing losses(Anonymous 2006).
If oxygen is undesired in the tank, then the inflow should be connected to an “inerting” gas, prob￾ably nitrogen.
11.4 Selecting a Tank Type
The choice of tank depends partly on the required design pressure and partly on the amount of
material to be stored.
The reader is cautioned that there is sometimes confusion in stating whether the stated volume
of a container is determined by its dimensions or by the volume of fluid (i.e. gas at high pressure)
that can be stored in the container.
Forinstance, a container 2 ft(0.61 m)in diameter and 20 ft(6.1 m)long has a dimensional volume
of about 1.8 cu M, but can store 300 std. cu M of gas when filled to a pressure of 2450 psig. In the
Table 11.1, the dimensional volume is used to state the capacity of the containers. The table is
published by the American Petroleum Institute.
11.5 Storage of Gases
Gases, due to their low density, tend to be stored under pressure to minimize the cost of the con￾tainer and plant real estate. The type and dimensions of a tank for a gas depend on the compressed
volume and the pressure.11.6 Storage of Liquids 169
11.5.1 Small Quantities
Range 0–1000 m3.
For low pressure, thin-walled tanks or drums can be used.
At higher pressure, the familiar upright thick-walled bottles are used, as are horizontal “bullet
tanks” which are cylindrical with semispherical ends. The choice of container size depends on the
consumption rate.
All pressure vessels must be built by shops that follow the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers (ASME) VIII code and are certified as so doing. Design pressures are allowed up to
3000 psig and, for vessels, above 10 000 psig.
11.5.2 Midsize Quantities
Thisrange istypically with a maximum of 35 000 m3. Tanksin the shape ofspheres orspheroids are
commonly used. Spheroids are typically used for pressures of 30 psig or less. Spherestake pressures
up to 200 psig. Sphere diameters typically range from 32 to 120 ft. Once again, the vessel must be
built to satisfy the ASME VIII code.
11.5.3 Mid to Large Quantities
Even though the gas has been compressed, the required storage volume becomes difficult to handle.
At this point, consideration should be given to storage as a liquid.
11.5.4 Very Large Quantities
It may be possible to store gases in underground caverns, where natural geography allows.
Guidance is provided in the Engineering Data Book of the Gas Processors Suppliers Association.
Another possible approach is to convert the gas into another, denser, substance.
11.5.5 High Consumption Rates; Hazardous Gases
Instead of the usual bulk transport – and – storage model, consideration should be given to
(1) bringing in the gas by pipeline, or
(2) producing the gas on-site. This choice may be the most economical. For hazardous gases, this
choice minimizes the possibility of human contact and emissions.
11.6 Storage of Liquids
Here, we look at the storage of liquids external to processes. The term of storage is usually more
than one day, and the tanks may be part of a tank farm, with facilities for inter-tank transfer and
for blending.
The combination of tank operating pressures (as dictated by the vapor pressure of the fluid) and
required storage volume drives the selection process (Figure 11.2).
A major distinction is the vapor pressure of the liquid, with different vessels being required for
pressures:
● less than 1.5 psia,
● less than 11.1 psia
all classified as low-pressure storage. Vapor pressures near or exceeding atmospheric pressure
require storage in pressure vessels.170 11 Storage and Bulk Transport

11.6.1 Low-Pressure Storage
Many industrial groups have published standards for liquid storage tanks. These publications
are intended to produce vessels that meet government regulations. Two sets of standards which
are in frequent use are those of Underwriters Laboratory and of the American Petroleum
Institute.
The UL-142 standard is used in constructing small low-pressure tanks for flammable and com￾bustible liquids (Figure 11.3). Domestic examples are fuel storage at service stations and oil storage
tanks for home heating. They are constructed to withstand a pressure of up to 5 psig, but this is
just for leak testing. The UL-2085 standard is for a double wall, thus eliminating the need for dikes.
These Underwriters Laboratory standards satisfy the legally required regulation 30 of the NFPA
(National Fire Protection Association).
For the construction of larger low-pressure tanks, the American Petroleum Institute provides
designs and standards (i.e. API 650 and 620). The simplest is the vertical vessel with a conical roof
(Figure 11.4), used for liquids of low vapor pressure, generally less than 1.5 psia. The head space is
a mixture of air, or inert gas, and vapor of the substance. These tanks are typically up to 300 ft in
diameter, but no actual limit is stated. This class of storage can also be used for liquids with higher
vapor pressure, up to about 11.1 psia. The cutoff forthis class of vessel is a total pressure of 14.9 psig,
above which the pressure-vessel regulations apply.11.6 Storage of Liquids 171
Figure 11.4 API tank.
Figure 11.5 Floating roof storage tank.
If the liquid has a vapor pressure in excess of 0.75 psia, then the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) requires a vapor recovery system if the storage quantity exceeds 40 000 US gallons. Other
conditions apply to smaller vessels. See EPA’s “NSPS Subpart Kb” for details on vapor recovery
system requirements for storage tanks (EPA 2023).
Also contained in the API 620, 650 standards is the floating roof storage tank (Figure 11.5),
which does not require a vapor recovery system. The tank has no headspace as the roof of the
tank floats on top of the liquid and rises and falls as the liquid level changes; thus, vapor is not
vented when liquid levels rise. The lack of headspace ensures there are no “breathing” losses from
the tank. A seal (of which there are various types) ensures negligible evaporation of the liquid
even with fluids that have low atmospheric boiling points. This type of tank design is required by
the EPA in the United States for fluids with vapor pressures greater than 1.5 psia and less than
11.1 psia.
A variation is the internal floating roof tank (Figure 11.6), a conical roof atop the floating roof
vessel, to protect from weather. Consideration to vent this secondary headspace may be required
to eliminate flammability issues.
In Table 11.1 are listed an API list of some typical tank sizes.172 11 Storage and Bulk Transport
Figure 11.6 Internal floating roof tank (hybrid cone/floating
roof tank).
The tanks so far described are all welded, and the welds have to be checked and certified. A dif￾ferent approach is to build the tank in the field by bolting together prefabricated sections. Suitable
for fluids with low vapor pressures, these tanks can be erected by hand and easily dismantled and
transported elsewhere later.
Various companies publish tables of APItank sizes and capacitiesthat companies use asstandard
sizes, but generally the tanks are custom made for the application.
11.6.2 High-Pressure Storage
For operating pressures from 15 psig upward to about 250 psig, spheres and spheroids may be used.
Designs are generally to ASME Section VIII Div 1 code (Figure 11.7).
Drums or “bullet tanks” which are cylindrical with flanged and dished (torispherical) heads
are suitable for high-pressure applications. Standards for pressures up to 3000 psig are covered by
ASME Section VIII Div 1. Designs for pressures greater than 10 000 psig are covered by ASME VIII
Div 3.
Underground storage is particularly useful for high-vapor-pressure fluids and large volumes of
liquid (equivalent of 100s of storage tanks) or gas. Pressures of 3000 psig or higher for compressed
natural gas are not unheard of. The storage requires particular geological formations such as salt
caverns or previous oil and gas production locations. No formal standards exist; thus, this storage
option will require extensive geological design and evaluation. Thus, the solution is not available to
every plant. An overview is “Deep-Well Storage in Salt Caverns- Lambton County” (Tom Hamilton
2006), a Profile of Underground Natural Gas Storage Facilities and Market Hubs(Anonymous, Fos￾ter Assoc Inc. 1995). See also the Compressed Natural Gas storage and consult the Gas Processors
Suppliers Association handbook for further information.
11.6.3 Storage Suggestions
It may be possible to reduce vapor pressure and facility cost by cooling the liquid.
The above descriptions have been for storage periods of greater than a day. Within an operation,
smaller tanks closer to the process are used as day storage. A small version of some of the above
tank styles may be appropriate, likely “bullet tanks”, in horizontal or vertical orientation.
For after-process waste disposal of liquids, a lined outdoor pond may be suitable, where liquid
can evaporate. This may be an intermediate step on the way to a treatment facility.11.6 Storage of Liquids 173
Figure 11.7 Spherical high-pressure storage tank.
11.6.4 Tank Management
Storage is such an important aspect of processes of all types that process operators have written
extensively about it. Ambrouche et al. (2002) presented some general rules. Gorgi & Jari (2006),
Jenkins (2009), Kenkre (2017), Montgomery IV (2002), Mukherjee (2006), and Pullarcot (2007)
provided education on the subject of tankage.
Although storage is normally the passive part of an industrial operation, there isstill maintenance
to be done and safety to be respected. Cerulli & Franks (2002) and Pagcatipunan (2003) presented
ideas on tank cleaning. Ritchie (2009)spoke about the prevention ofstorage tank fires. Gollin (2010)
and Kinsley Jr (2001) discussed purging and inerting. Mikkola & Lieb (2007) addressed corrosion
checking.
An ongoing part of tank management is the measurement and analysis of tank contents. An
anonymous article from 2011 discussed tank farm logistics. Agrawal (2007) discussed efficient
sampling. Blundell (2018) talked of overfill protection. Doane (2007), Hambrice & Hotard (2004),
Mallon (2019), Sivaraman et al. (2010), Skaug (2008), and Syrnyk & Seiler (2007) discussed the
measurement of liquid amount in vessels.174 11 Storage and Bulk Transport
One of the concerns of liquid storage, referenced in the above descriptions, is the handling of
vapor generated by vapor pressure. This aspect is treated by Bahadori (2009), Drennen (2019),
Foiles (2004), Norouzi & Mofrad (2008), and Peress (2001). The effect on stored liquid is discussed
by Anjan & Khan (2014) and Peress (2003).
11.7 Solid Storage
Solid storage is typically done either by piling on the ground (possibly inside a building, i.e. in the
case of hydroscopic materials), or in bins or silos.
Baasel (1976) suggested the following:
1. It is cheapest to build bins with a cylindrical cross section.
2. Provide one large bin wherever possible rather than multiple small bins to save on supports,
materials, fabrication costs, and conveyors.
3. Binslargerin diameterthan 11 ft 6 in are difficult to transport by road and should thus be avoided
if possible. A practical length is about 30 ft.
4. Coarse, uniform-particle size materials flow easily (i.e. plastic pellets). Fine, relatively uniform
materials are almost fluid (i.e. kitchen starch). The greater the distribution of particle sizes in a
mixture, the greater the tendency to compact and to resist flow.
5. To ensure materials freely flow out the bottom of a bin (to avoid bridging), make the bottom an
eccentric cone with one straight vertical side.
Experience has shown that the cone angle should always be the greater of the “angle of slide” or
the “angle of repose”.
Angle ofslide – The angle ofslide is measured by a simple test, whereby the material is placed on a
flat plate made from the materials and same finish asthe bin isto be constructed from. The flat plate
is tipped up, and the angle of the plate at which the material begins to slide is noted as the angle of
slide.
Angle of repose – The angle of the pile when the material is poured onto a flat surface.
For materialsthat may be hydroscopic,sticky, orfusestogether(i.e. ice),seek advice from experts
such asJennike and Johanson (http://www.jenike.com) orJerry Johanson (http://www.jrjohanson
.com).

11.8 Bulk Shipping
The ideal transportation method for materials and chemicals is dependent upon:
● the volume of material to be used on a weekly or monthly basis,
● the pressure required (for gases),
● the state of the material to be used (i.e. if liquid nitrogen is required for freezing, then vapor
delivery is of little use), and
● proximity to existing pipelines, proximity to rail, water, or roads, and suppliers of the material.
The common bulk shipping methods for gases, liquids, and solids are discussed further
below.11.8 Bulk Shipping 175
11.8.1 Cylinder
● Usually transported by trucks, cylinders provide a convenient method of moving small volumes
of gases (up to 10 m3 per cylinder).
● Where slightly larger volumes of gases are required, liquefied gas transported in dewars
(insulated vessels) is utilized (nitrogen liquid has 4× the density of nitrogen gas at 2450 psig,
hydrogen a factor of 5×).
11.8.2 Ship “Container”
● Although not a “mode” of shipment, containers may be shipped by road, rail, or water.
● There are a series ofstandardized sizesfor “containers”, but all containers are 8 ft wide. The most
widely used containers are the general purpose dry van (DV) containers having a nominal length
and height of 20′ × 8.5′
, 40′ × 8.5′
, and 40′ × 9.5′
.
● The capacity of a 20′ dry cargo container is 24 000 kg (52 900 lbs.), and that of a 40′ dry cargo
container is 30 480 kg (67 200 lbs.). The containers themselves weigh 2400 kg and 3900 kg,
respectively.
● Containers are available for carrying bulk gases, liquids, bulk solids, and refrigerated products.
11.8.3 Truck
● Generally, a transit distance within 1000 km using road freight is competitive compared to rail
and air freight.
● Maximum weight allowable on Canadian roads is a complex calculation based upon tire widths,
axel distances, the number of tires, and the time of year. However, the weight is generally in the
18 000–34 000 kg range.
● Bulk gases delivered by a tank truck (usually hydrogen or helium) are utilized when consumption
rates are 25 000–150 000 std ft3 per month.
● Liquefied gases may be transported where higher volumes of gas must be handled (usage rates
30 000 to several million std ft3 per month).
11.8.4 Rail
● Railcars are typically 40–89 ft long, and each car is limited to a weight of 120 metric tons (typical
range 60–120 metric tons). When handling containers, a typical 50-cartrain can haul 3 million kg.
● Hopper cars have typical volume capacities of 4750–5150 cu ft.
● General information about rail transportation can be found at the CN website at http://www.cn
.ca/en_index.shtml.
● The guidelines for transportation of dangerous goods can be found at the transport Canada web￾site at http://www.tc.gc.ca/tdg/menu.htm.
● Railcars can be insulated (for liquefied gases or liquids that must kept warm), and they will have
pressure ratings for pressurized gases.
11.8.5 Ship
● Suitable where easy access to water is available.
● Suitable for large volumes and especially heavy cargo.176 11 Storage and Bulk Transport
● Economical for large distances.
● Ships commonly utilize containers (approximately 180 million twenty foot equivalent unit
(TEUs) are handled by the world’s ports every year, pre-2021).
– A TEU is a 20-foot equivalent unit based on the size of a standard 20-foot long shipping
container.
– Containers are available for carrying bulk gases, liquids, and bulk solids.
● Ships are generally limited to 900 ft in length and 105 ft in width (to fit the Panama Canal) and
can carry 2000–4500 TEUs. Non-Panama Canal ships can handle over 24 000 TEUs.
● Liquid-carrying ships are measured in their cargo-carrying capacity expressed in deadweight
tons (DWTs). Capacity of ships typically vary from 10 000 to 320 000 DWT. The TI Oceania has a
capacity of 441 893 DWT.
11.8.6 Pipeline
● Commonly used method of delivering fluids and gases (i.e. tap water or natural gas to houses
and industry).
● Provides the lowest cost per lb transportation charge for large capacities.
● Where an existing pipeline infrastructure is nearby, economic and inherent safety (minimal site
inventory) advantages exist.
● Pipelines exist for water, natural gas, oil, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen (the later three in the
Gulf Coast area).
● For instance, natural gas pipelines transport on average 442 million cu M d−1 (2019, 15.7 billion
cu ft) in Canada.
● Steam distribution from central heating centers is less common today due to the use of natural
gas instead, but can be economical in certain situations.
● Liquid pipelines are designed with velocities up to 10 fts−1 and maximum pressures to 1000 psig.
Gas pipelines have higher velocities.
11.8.7 Conveyor Belt
● Conveyor belts are typically used in mining applications where large masses of material must be
transported over reasonable distances.
● Conveying distances of 8–98 km have been commercially proven.
● Example: 750 metric tons h−1 over 6 km distances, energy use = 0.4 kW per metric ton h−1 (0.68
BTU per lb), at an electrical cost (0.07 $ kW−1 h) (USD) of about 3.1E-5 $ kg−1 of material.
● See http://www.conveyor-dynamics.com/
11.8.8 Air
● Air freighters like the Boeing 747-8F can carry loads weighing up to 140 metric tons or about
30 000 cu ft of cargo.
● Generally, air freight is perceived as being expensive as compared to other forms of
transportation.
11.8.9 On-site Generation
Although not really a mode of transport, this is commonly grouped with transportation methods
for comparison purposes.References 177

● On-site generation of standard gases (nitrogen, oxygen) can provide for significantly larger con￾sumption rates: oxygen plants of 100–135 000 std ft3 h−1 (72 000–100 million std ft3 per month),
and typical nitrogen plant sizes are 5000–160 000 std ft3 h−1 (Table 11.2)

In-Plant Transfer of Liquids and Liquid Mixtures with Gases and Solids
The transfer of materials – whether they be liquids, gases, or solids – around a plant is a technology
unto itself. For liquids, the complications are as follows:
(1) Internal molecular structure manifests in a variety of viscosities and general rheological
stress–strain properties.
(2) The liquid, while being the main component, may be carrying a significant amount of gas or
solid.
These issues affect the choice of liquid movers and the choice of auxiliary hardware.
Sections 12.1 and 12.2 of this chapter discussthe flow of liquids and their admixtures, principally
their flow patterns and pressure drop. Thisis a prelude to the consideration of liquid movers, which
need to “know” what flows and pressures they must provide.
Section 12.3 discusses movers that are dynamic, which transform high-speed internal flow into
pressure to drive a liquid through pipes and other equipment. Centrifugal pumps are by far the
major representative of this class.
Section 12.4 discusses positive displacement movers, which impel a liquid by simply pushing on
it. Some other lesser-used pumps are also included.
Section 12.5 discussesthe ancillary itemsthat are part of liquid flow systems, e.g., piping, fittings,
valves, and seals.
A very helpful reference for the topics of this chapter is the Crane Flow of Fluids Handbook.
12.1 Flow of Liquids in Single Phase: Newtonian
and Non-Newtonian
The distinction between Newtonian and non-Newtonian liquids is based on the form of their
stress–strain behavior. It is easily visualized by considering a flat plate moving parallel to a
stationary plate with liquid in between. The shear rate is the plate velocity divided by the distance
between plates, and the shear stress is the force required to move the plate divided by its area
parallel to flow. Within a flowing fluid, every point has an internal stress and strain – related to
each other according to the rheological nature of the material.
12.1.1 Single-Phase Newtonian Flow
The definition of a Newtonian liquid is that the shear rate and shear strain are related linearly,
starting at (0,0). There are two key properties – the density and the viscosity, with viscosity

being the constant ratio between the shear stress and shear rate, units equal to (N m−2)/[(m s−1)
m−1)] = N m−2 s = Pa s.
Fluid flow at constant or near-constant temperature is described by Bernoulli’s energy balance,
P1∕𝜌 + (g∕gc) Z1 + u1
2
∕(2 gc) + 𝜂 Wf = P2∕𝜌 + (g∕gc) Z2 + u2
2
∕(2 gc) + hf (12.1)
where
P is the pressure,
𝜌 is the local density,
Z is the elevation,
g is the acceleration due to terrestrial gravity,
gc is Newton’s second law conversion factor, kg m s−2 N−1 ( = 1),
u is the fluid local velocity,
Wf is the mechanical energy input being received by the fluid, the work term, that increases
pressure and/or velocity,
𝜂 is the efficiency factor, and
hf is the rate of energy loss due to friction.
In a specific application, any of the terms may be important and should be estimated before being
deleted. If we leave out the elevation, velocity, and work terms, then the equation reduces to
P2 − P1 = −𝜌 × hf (12.2)
or the more familiar
ΔP = 4 f (L∕D) 𝜌 u2
∕(2 gc) (12.3)
for pressure drop in a circular pipe.
The Fanning friction factor, f , depends on the Reynolds number, Re, and, for turbulent flow, the
internal surface roughness of the pipe. This dependence is shown in Figure 12.1. The bulk of the
graph isforturbulent flow. Laminar flow isshown by the left-hand line, which issimply f =16 Re−1.
For accuracy, it is advised to use the original Moody graph, which is reproduced in references such
as Perry’s Chemical Engineers’ Handbook.

The Darcy friction factor is identical to the Fanning friction factor but includes a 4× factor in its
value. Some references (i.e. Crane Technical paper 10) will use the Darcy friction factor and the
Darcy equation, which excludes the four multiplier in Eq. (12.3).
The value of 𝜀 is the average height of protuberances in the pipe’s inner wall. Table 12.1 suggests
values.
To enable the use of the chart for calculation purposes, Colebrook (1939) developed the following
formula for turbulent flow:
1∕fD
0.5 = −2 × log 10 {
(𝜀∕D)∕3.7 + 2.51∕
(
Re × fD
0.5) } (12.4)
in which f D isthe Darcy friction factor, which is numerically exactly fourtimesthe Fanning friction
factor. After dividing the value from Eq. (12.4) by 4, it is seen that there is a satisfactory match
to Moody’s plot. The implicit form of Eq. (12.4) is a small, easy-to-get-around impediment in its
application.
The following authors have further studied this important prediction: Churchill (1977), Gilmont
(2006), Cordero (2008), and Goudar (2008). The equation of Churchill is explicit.
For cross sections other than circular, there are relations that calculate a pseudo-diameter to use
as the denominator D in Eq. (12.3).
The first part of Eq. (12.3) is sometimes written as
N = 4 f (L∕D)
so that
ΔP = N [𝜌 u2
∕(2 gc)] (12.5)
For other pipe elements, Eq. (12.5) is also used but with different values of N. The grouping
u2/(2 gc), units N m kg−1, is often referred to as a velocity head, so N is the number of velocity
heads given up by the passage of liquid through an element. The upstream velocity is used for u in
calculating the velocity head (Table 12.2).
12.1.2 Non-Newtonian Liquid Flowing as a Single Phase
For Newtonian liquids, the viscosity was defined as the ratio between the shear stress, 𝛾, and shear
strain, that is,
Dynamic viscosity, 𝜇 = 𝛾∕(du∕dy) (12.6)184 12 In-Plant Transfer of Liquids and Liquid Mixtures with Gases and Solids

Non-Newtonians do not have this simple relation. For some liquids, especially molten polymers,
the following simple variation is a good approximation:
Effective viscosity = A0∕(1 + A1× ∣ du∕dy ∣) (12.7)
Another common expression is
𝛾 = K × (du∕dy) × |du∕dy|
n−1 (12.8)
where K and n are constants. For Newtonian liquids, n is 1 and K is the viscosity.
Many rheologists have studied these flows, but the early work of Dodge and Metzner(1959)isstill
highly considered. They applied Eq. (12.8) to turbulent flow and derived the following expression
for use as the Fanning friction factor in Eq. (12.3) (Figure 12.2):

The Reynolds number, Re′
, still dimensionless, is defined as
Re′ = Dn V2−n 𝜌∕(gc K 8n−1
) (12.10)
where K and n come from Eq. (12.8). The expression reduces to the standard definition of Re for
Newtonian fluids, where n is 1 and K is the viscosity.
For Reynolds number less than about 3000, the formula for laminar flow should be used,
FF = 16∕Re′ (12.11)
Applying this procedure requires knowledge of the two constants, K and n, which could be
measured by viscometry in the lab. Those tests would also tell if, in fact, the behavior actually
follows Eq. (12.8). It may be necessary to conduct tests at full scale if the liquid displays highly and
non-Newtonian characteristics that have no existing correlations.
Figure 12.3 shows some of the types of fluid stress–strain.
12.2 Two-Phase Flows
Two-phase flows are common in the chemical and process industries, but not commonly treated
in the introductory fluid-flow instruction. There are three combinations:
● liquid and gas,
● gas and solid, and
● solid and liquid.
The gas–solid combination is treated in Chapter 14, Transportation and modification of solids.
The other two are discussed in this section. Also discussed is the flow of liquid under gravity.
12.2.1 Two-Phase Liquid–Gas Systems
In the case of a gas and a liquid flowing together, there are several different patterns of flow ranging
from fully stratified where the two phases move in separate top and bottom layers with minimal
influence on each other to spray/dispersed where the liquid is completely dispersed in the gas.
Some of these flow patterns are shown in Figure 12.4.186 12 In-Plant Transfer of Liquids and Liquid Mixtures with Gases and Solids

It is obviously desirable to be able to predict the nature of the flow in particular cases, and
the standard way of doing so is to locate the flow on the map (Figure 12.5) proposed by Baker
(1954). By experiment with water and air, Baker found the flow type to be a function of two
parameters:
● the weight–flow ratio of liquid to gas Gliquid/Ggas and
● the mass flow rate of gas Ggas. The plot, with these coordinates, shows the boundaries between
the various flow regimes.

(12.12a)
and
Ggas × [(0.075∕𝜌gas)×(62.3∕𝜌liquid)]1∕2 (12.12b)
In most cases, the slug region is the one to avoid. This type of flow consists of successive
zones of liquid and gas following each other, with the liquid “slugs” being propelled at large
velocity by the gas. Serious vibration and pipe stress can result. Steam hammer in steam pipes is a
common example.
For design purposes, it is necessary to predict the pressure drop under two-phase conditions.
Various methods exist, some of them specific to one or the other flow regime, but one method, that
of Lockhart and Martinelli (1949), provides a reasonable general prediction. The method makes
use of the curves in Figure 12.6.
The procedure is as follows:
1. For each of the two components, calculate the pressure gradient that would occur if that
component flowed by itself through the pipe, (dP/dL)liquid and (dP/dL)gas.
2. Form the parameter X equal to square root of (dP/dL)liquid/(dP/dL)gas.
3. From Figure 12.6, read off the appropriate multipliers, 𝛷g and 𝛷L.
Two phase pressure gradient = 𝛷L × (dP∕dL)liquid or 𝛷g × (dP∕dL)gas (12.13)
The choice of lines depends on whether the fictitious single-phase flows would have been both
viscous (i.e. laminar) or both turbulent. If one is viscous and the other is turbulent, set the value of
𝜙 halfway between the upper and lower prediction.
Lockhart and Martinelli also provided a graph for the in situ volumetric fractions of liquid
and gas. It must be realized that the ratio of volumetric flow rates and the ratio of local (in situ)
volumes are generally not the same because the speeds of the two phases are generally different.

Figure 12.6 provides a prediction of RL, the in situ liquid volumetric fraction, also as a function of
the parameter X. The concept of a homogeneous flow where gas and liquid move as a single fluid
with a single velocity is generally not correct.
For the use of this plot on the computer, the following empirical equations have been fitted (2nd
Author’s Note: There appears to be some equations below that do not predict the graph correctly.
Please check the output before using):
For the local liquid volumetric fraction, RL,
z = log10(1.32/X);
if X is less than 1.32, y = 1.0 z +0.556 exp(−1.36 z);
if X is greater than 1.32, y = 0.556 exp[0.4394 (z – (−z)̂2.117)],
RL = 10̂(−y).
For the liquid pressure drop multiplier, ΦL,
xx = log10(X);
if X is less than 1.0,
z = A {[B−C xx]/[B−xx]},
y = −2 xx + D exp(z),
where
A = 1.098 1, B = 0.025 4, C = 0.82, and D = 1.271 when both phases are turbulent;
A = 1.390 6, B = 0.066, C = 0.75, and D = 1.075 when one phase is turbulent and the other
is laminar;
A = 1.929 1, B = 0.124 3, C = 0.85, and D = 0.845 when both phases (in single flow) are
laminar.
If X is greater than 1.0,
y = A exp[(−B) (xx +xx̂C)],
where
A = 1.271, B = 0.475 5, and C = 1.835 when both phases (in the single-phase flow) are
turbulent;
A = 1.075, B = 0.469 9, and C = 1.713 for one phase turbulent and one laminar;
A = 0.845, B = 0.437 8, and C = 1.639 for both phases laminar.
ΦL = 10̂ y (12.14)
For vertical flow, Lockhart and Martinelli’s equations provide a reasonable prediction of
frictional pressure loss for vertical as well as horizontal flow, but, of course, in the vertical case the
effect of changing static head pressure must also be accounted for. Their equations also describe
the liquid in situ fraction except in the case of slug flow (where the local fractions would be
expected to be the same as the volumetric flow fraction). Vertical flow has regimes somewhat
similar to those of horizontal (Baker plot), but a different plot was developed by Charles and
Oshinowa (1974) (Figure 12.7). The coordinates and the chart are as follows:

12.2.2 Two-Phase Liquid and Solid Systems – Slurries
The closeness of densities distinguishes the liquid–solid combination from the other two com￾binations, gas–liquid and gas–solid. It has its own distinct technology. We examine the flow in
horizontal pipelines, and we assume that the density of the solids is greater than the density of the
liquid.
In most cases, the material of interest is the solid and the water is its carrier. However, this
assumption does not affect the following treatment.
If liquid flow were zero or very low, the solids would settle into a nonmoving zone at the bottom
of the pipe. As the liquid speeds up, the bed begins moving. At higher speeds, particles are swept
up by currents and ride along, at liquid velocity, until they subside into the bed. Thus, everything
is moving but at two separate speeds. At still higher liquid velocity, all particles are swept from the
bottom of the pipe and the flow becomes homogeneous, acting as a single phase.
The effect of liquid velocity on these regimes is shown qualitatively in Figure 12.8. The term
“saltation” is used to describe the action in the heterogeneous range. In practical applications, it
is not necessary to achieve fully homogeneous flow, which occasions high pressure drop and high
energy.
To be conveyed, the solid particles do need to be lifted off their bed. Durand (1953) determined
that a minimum value of the pipe-flow Froude number is required. The effect of the particle size
and particle loading (%CV) on this minimum number is shown in Figure 12.9.
FrL = Froude number =
√{
uL
2∕[2 g D (s − 1)]} (12.15)
where
uL is the velocity of the liquid,
g is the acceleration due to terrestrial gravity, 9.8 m s−2 or 32.2 fts−2,
D is inside diameter of the pipe, and
s is the ratio of densities of the solid to the liquid.
From the chart, (FrL)minimum is obtained so that the minimum liquid velocity to achieve
significant saltation is

Many studies have been done to measure and mathematically describe the pressure gradients
of combined liquid and solid flow. Turian & Yuan (1977) presented individual equations for the
various regimes based on the examination of the data of numerous workers. Lahiri & Ghanta
(2009B) have attested to the value of this correlation. By comparing these two works, it should be
noted that the solid concentration in Turian is expressed as a percentage and in Lahiri as a fraction.
Turian and Yuan’s equation is for the increase in the Fanning friction factor above the factor of
water alone, which can be quite significant. The general form for all regimes is

where AP is the area of the particle projected in the direction of motion. Values for this coefficient
are obtained from handbooks such as Perry’s.
Alderman & Heywood (2004A, 2004B), Duffy (2015), and Lahiri & Ghanta (2008, 2009A, 2009B)
discussed suspension rheology and flow.
12.2.3 Liquid Flow Under the Influence of Gravity
Bernoulli’s equation (12.1), includes gravity terms (g/gc)Z which account for the effect of fluid
height or head on the mechanical energy balance. These terms are insignificant for low-density
fluids, e.g., gases, but may be important for liquids. In the present discussion, the assistance of
gravity in moving a liquid is examined. Gravity may reduce the requirement for pumping; it may
be sufficient by itself to move the liquid, and it may require throttling to control the flow.
Gravity flow can be obtained in full pipes or partially full pipes. Circumstances usually dictate
which is appropriate. The one rule is to make a design decision: filled or not filled. Letting the
system determine the state may lead to instability (e.g. “fill-dump”) or to restriction of flow due to
vapor locking.
Two questions are addressed here: outflow from vessels and flow in partially filled pipes.
12.2.3.1 Vessel Outflow
Hills (1983) distinguished the two cases: filled-pipe outflow (sketches “A1” and “A2” in
Figure 12.10) and open-pipe outflow (sketches “B1” and “B2” in Figure 12.10). Either may be
acceptable, but a choice must be made and must be designed for. Hill defined a quantity as
JL = [4 Q∕(π d2
)]∕(g d)
1∕2 (12.19)
where Q is the flow rate in, say, cubic meters per second,
d is the outflow pipe diameter in meters, and
g is the acceleration due to terrestrial gravity, 9.8 m s−1.
Examination of the right-hand side shows JL to be a Froude number,
JL = U∕(g d)

The objective in cases “A1” and “A2” is to avoid the entrainment of gas into the liquid outflow,
i.e., to avoid a two-phase flow. For situation “A1”, bottom-flow, Hill specified the criterion,
JL < 1.6 (h∕d)
2 (12.21)
where h is the height of liquid above the bottom of the vessel. Here, the decision is where to set the
liquid height: Inverting Eq. (12.21) leads to
h > 0.892 [Q2
∕(g d)]0.25 (12.22)
Yu (1997) had a slightly different proposal for (12.21),
JL < 3.25 (h∕d)
2.5 (12.23)
leading to
h > 0.688 (Q∕g1∕2
)
0.4 (12.24)
Hills’ equation forsituation “A2” issimilarto Eq. (12.21) but appearsto have an errorin the index
of (2 h/d). Replacing Hills’ 1/2 by 2 gives
JL < (2 h∕d)
2 (12.25)
where h is the height above the top of the outflow pipe.
See also Rochelle & Briscoe (2010) and Ukil & Mathew (2011) for the elimination of air
entrainment during tank drainage. The tank drainage problem in general is treated by Kossik
(2000), Steve (2012), and Yu (2003).
12.2.3.2 Flow in Partially Filled Pipes
Two typical questions are as follows:
(1) for a given liquid flow, will the pipe be filled or partly filled;
(2) what pipe size is needed to convey a required flow at a desired level of fill.
Durand and Marquez-Lucero (1998) stated that, for a fully horizontal pipe (Figure 12.11), the
criterion for partial filling is
Q < 10.2 × d2.5 (12.26)
where Q is the volumetric flow in gallons per minute and
d is the pipe internal diameter in inches.
Durand and Marquez-Lucero presented the following formula relating volumetric flow to the
geometry of the space occupied by the liquid in a partially filled pipe (Figure 12.12):
Q (cubic inches∕minute) = (A3 g∕T)

where A is the cross-sectional area of the liquid flow in square inches,
g is the gravitational constant, 1.39E6 in/min2, and

Useful formulae for the geometric calculations, based on the fraction of filled height K, are as
follows:
Chord length = T = 2 d [K (1 − K)]0.5 (12.28)
Wetted perimeter = lw = 𝛼 d∕2 (12.29)

also for an un-sloped pipe.
Steve (2000) presented a formula for a sloped pipe,

Le is the equivalent length of the pipe, taking into account the pressure drop due to fittings,

12.3 Liquid Movers – Dynamic
As defined, the dynamic movers generate kinetic energy which is then converted to exit pressure
in accordance with Bernoulli’s mechanical energy balance. They are limited to low-viscosity
liquids, say up to 45 centipoise, and usually to non-flashing liquids. The pressure they generate
is low compared with positive-displacement devices. Significant solids can be handled but with12.3 Liquid Movers – Dynamic 195
appropriate design changes. In spite of these limitations, dynamic pumps – and in particular
centrifugal pumps – are ubiquitous in chemical processing.
12.3.1 Centrifugal Pumps
Centrifugal pumps are by far the most common liquid movers. As shown in the schematic in
Figure 12.13, a high-speed rotating impellerimparts kinetic energy to the liquid, which had entered
at the central “hub”, and this energy converts to pressure at the inside walls of the casing and at the
start of the exit piping.
A photograph of a typical impeller is shown in Figure 12.14.
For a given speed, a pump delivers a fixed energy per unit weight to the liquid. Within the pump,
this energy is kinetic and is the u2/(2 gc) term in the Bernoulli balance. The units are
Foot × pound force∕pound of liquid passing through or, Newton × meters∕kilogram of liquid
This energy converts to pressure potential, the P/density term in the Bernoulli balance, so that
Pressure = energy × density
At the same time, in Figure 12.15, the pressure equals Head × density, so
Energy × density = Pressure = Head × density
Consequently, Head is a measure of pump energy and is fixed regardless of liquid density. It is
the ordinate in the following plots of performance versus volumetric throughput.
Unfortunately, the impeller-imparted energy does not all end up in the outflow because there is
energy lossin friction through the vanes. Thislossincreases with volumetric flow. The key indicator
of pump performance is the pump curve, two examples of which are shown in Figure 12.16. One
pump is designed for higher output pressure, the other for higher flow. The feature of these curves

is the drop-off of pressure (or Head) with increased flow. Some pumps have variations in the shape
of the curves, as shown in (Figure 12.17), depending on the design, especially of the impellers.
A pump curve is specific to a given pump size, to a given impeller diameter, and to a given
speed. The prime use of these curves is in matching the pump to the combination of required
increase with the flow rate. Figure 12.18 shows the pump curves for three different speeds, along
with the system curve which shows how the downstream frictional losses increase with flow
[for instance, see Eq. (12.3)]. The intersection of the system curve with the three pump curves
shows the combination of head and flow that can be delivered. If none of these intersections is
satisfactory, then the pump may need to be larger or of a different design.
Along with the pumping characteristics, the pump has three other important features:
● the power required to run it,
● the efficiency with which the power is turned into actual useful pumping, and
● the required pressure at the inlet.12.3 Liquid Movers – Dynamic 197

Figure 12.19 Performance characteristics for a centrifugal pump.
Figure 12.19 incorporates curves for these three variables for a given pump at a particular speed.
Other pumps, and this pump at a different speed, would have similar plots but with different
numbers.
The thermodynamic prediction for power to raise pressure across the pump is
Pumping power = volumetric throughput × pressure rise = Q ΔP (12.32)
The brake power, on the other hand, is the measured power required to drive the pump and
includes all losses due to friction with packing and other inefficiencies. In Figure 12.19.
Pumping efficiency = Q ΔP∕brake power (12.33)198 12 In-Plant Transfer of Liquids and Liquid Mixtures with Gases and Solids
Since Figure 12.19 is expressed in “traditional” units, it will be instructive to
(1) convert the units to Systeme Internationale and
(2) recalculate the efficiencies at different conditions for comparison with the existing curve.
Head (m) = Head (ft) × 0.304 8,
Pressure rise (Pa) = ΔP = Head (m) × density (kg mass−3)
× kg force/kg mass (1) × N/kg force (9.8)
= 9800 × Head (m), assuming the fluid is water
Volumetric flow = Q (m3 s−1) = Q (USGPM) × 0.0000631
Brake power (watts) = Brake horsepower × 745.6
See Table 12.5.
One observation is that the best efficiency point (BEP), occurs when the head has decreased by
about 20% from its maximum (i.e. at zero flow). This is a fairly general conclusion. Pump experts
recommend operating close to the peak efficiency. Fortunately, the efficiency curve plateaus over
a wide range of conditions.
The other line in the plot is the required net positive suction head. It gives the minimum pressure
condition ahead of the pump, below which the pump malfunctions. The malfunction consists of
vapor formation at the pump entrance which has two adverse effects:
decrease in efficiency because of the space taken by vapor, and
collapse of vapor bubbles causing damaging cavitation inside the pump.
The net positive suction head (NPSH) is a differential pressure, is calculated as the pump inlet
pressure in absolute pressure minusthe vapor pressure of the liquid, and is converted to liquid head
(ft or m). It is recommended that the actual, or “available”, NPSH be the greater of 3 or 4 ft, or 20%,
than the “required” NPSH from the chart. If the intended positioning of the pump results in too
low a value, then the remedial action may be to
find a different pump,
lower the location of the pump,
increase the diameter of the upstream piping,
add a suction inducer (which creates other problems),
cool the fluid, and
increase the suction pressure.
Meeting NPSH requirements can be difficult if the feed is from a boiling reactor or if there are
dissolved gases in the liquid. Wood et al. (1998) discussed the latter situation.
Figure 12.20 illustrates the calculation of the net positive suction head.

Figure 12.21 Effect of the impeller diameter on pump characteristics.
A much rearranged version of Figure 12.19 is given in Figure 12.21, showing the effect of the
impeller diameter within a single casing. Obviously, the small impeller delivers a much reduced
result of both the head rise and quantity of flow. However, if those conditions are all that isrequired,
then changing the impeller is much cheaper than buying a whole new pump. As noted, the data
are for just a single pump speed.
The effects of the pump speed and pump diameter have been studied, and affinity laws have been
identified,
Qmax is proportional to D3 and to speed1 (12.34)
Hmax is proportional to D2 and to speed2 (12.35)
where D is the diameter of the impeller, which is assumed to contain a full-sized impeller.200 12 In-Plant Transfer of Liquids and Liquid Mixtures with Gases and Solids
If we eliminate D from the two relations, we determine that
Qmax 1∕2 × speed∕Hmax 3∕4 (12.36)
is a constant for the proportionalities of Eqs. (12.34) and (12.35).
This ratio is constant for a given style of pump (i.e. of its impeller) and is independent of size.

This ratio is known as the specific speed. In units of US gallons per minute for Q and feet of
liquid for H, the specific speed of commercially available pumpsrangesfrom about 500–15 000. The
designer of a system should calculate the specific speed based on the task planned for the pump.
This value will help in selecting the style of pump. If the value lies outside the range of availability,
then perhaps a multiple-stage pump or a non-centrifugal pump is a better choice.
Although centrifugal pumps are not positive displacement in nature, they may still be used asthe
final elementsin the control of floworlevel. The preferred methods, however, do not involve varying
the speed of a centrifugal pump: Not only would this introduce complexity into the drive but it is
also harmful to the pump if the flow drops too low. Most vendors recommend flows no lower than
25% of the maximum-efficiency flow. Rather, the most common practice is to provide a recycle
loop to handle part of the pump output. The sketches show two possible configurations. Method
“B” is preferred because it maintains a base flow even if the main line “AB” gets “dead-headed”,
i.e., completely shut off. The objective in both cases is for the pump to operate at a constant point
on its pump curve (Figures 12.22 and 12.23).
12.4 Liquid Movers – Positive Displacement and Other Pumps
Positive displacement means pockets of fluid are trapped and forced downstream by the direct
mechanical action. Pumps of this type are used in three situations:
where the liquid is viscous,
where the precise pumping rate is desired, and
where very high pressure rise is required.
The principle of the piston-driven reciprocating pump is easily visualized. Figure 12.24 is a sketch
of a mechanically actuated diaphragm-driven pump. Once again the inlet and outlet valving acts
to allow filling from a low-pressure source and emptying into a higher-pressure destination. The
ability of this valving may limit the viscosity that can be handled.
The pumping rate of reciprocating pumps can be varied in two ways:
by varying the speed of reciprocation or
by varying the stroke length.
Sometimes a set of pumps are “ganged” together on a common drive, in situations where a group
of liquids are being supplied to a single destination at a variable overall rate but always in the same

proportion to one another. The proportions are adjusted from time to time, as desired by adjusting
the stroke lengths of the individual pump heads.
Reciprocating pumps deliver a flow that pulsates at the frequency of the reciprocation. This
characteristic may or may not be acceptable. If it is not, then it can be partially redressed by
installing a pulsation dampener downstream of the pump. In specifying the strength of the piping
downstream of the pump, it must be remembered that the instantaneous flow of liquid can reach
values up to π times the average flow.
Experience is that reciprocating pumps must work against an adverse (rising) pressure gradient
in order that the valves open and close properly.
Rotary gear pumps, as seen in Figure 12.25, are commonly used for high-viscosity liquids. Two
or more gears trap liquid in the space between the gear teeth and the casing wall and convey it
from the inlet to outlet. Obviously, it is essential to minimize paths through which liquid could
flow backward, i.e., between the intermeshing gears, over the tips of the gears, and over the top
and bottom faces of the gears. This is especially important if the pump is raising the pressure
significantly. The pumping rate can be described by an equation of form
Q = α × RPM −β×ΔP∕𝜇
where Q is the volumetric throughput, 𝜇 is the liquid viscosity, ΔP is the pressure rise generated
by the pump, and α and β are constants that depend on the style, size, and clearances of the pump.
If clearances are too high, the pump loses much or all of its pumping efficiency. Gear pumps
are widely used in the polymer industries, where viscosities of thousands of poise (and even of
pascal-seconds) are encountered and where pressures of thousands of psi (tens of megapascal) are
required to force these liquids through pipes and vessels.
The screw pump in Figure 12.26 is related to the gear pump in that it acts by pushing liquid along
the inner surface of the casing, in this case the screw barrel. The most common embodiment is
Figure 12.26 Auger for a single-screw pump.12.4 Liquid Movers – Positive Displacement and Other Pumps 203
Figure 12.27 Twin screws, corotating.
a single screw in a single barrel, but other models make use of two screws in parallel intersecting
barrels, where the screws may corotate (Figure 12.27) or counter-rotate. Screw pumps are not
considered as positive displacement because the liquid is able to flow back along the screw
channels. The screw equation is similar to that of the gear pump,
Q = α × RPM −β×ΔP∕(𝜇 × L)
where L is the filled length of the screw. The constant β depends on both the cross-sectional
area of the screw channels and the clearances between the screw and barrel. Screw pumps
can still pump against significant pressures in spite of the backflow term. As the viscosity
increases, the backflow term decreases, which is why screw pumps are widely used for viscous
liquids.
Liquids containing gas or vapor can pose a problem, but centrifugal pumps are able to handle
some fraction of gas in a liquid stream and, in fact, specially designed pumps are said to be
able to tolerate up to 50% by the volume of gas. Naturally, there is a drop in the efficiency and
liquid pumping capacity, but this may be acceptable. However, a cavitating liquid is something
different because the vapor collapses within the pump and produces points of very high and
damaging stress. This was explained earlier. Cavitation is avoided by providing an adequate
suction head.
Prang (1997) recommended a counter-rotating rotary-screw pump for mixtures of gas and liquid,
where the volumetric fraction of gas goes as high as 90%. Even at such a high loading, there is
enough liquid to seal the clearances between the screw and screw and between the screw and wall.
Corrosive liquids: If an exotic metal is required to handle the liquid, it may be less expensive to
use a pump of plastic construction. Another choice is to use a reciprocating pump with an inert
diaphragm. A peristaltic pump, shown in Figure 12.28, may be the answer because the liquid never
leaves the tubing, which is made of inert plastic. Diaphragm and peristaltic pumps are members of
the class of seal-less pumps. There are other styles of seal-less pumps, and they too may be suitable
candidates if leakage is a major concern.
Slurries: Centrifugal pumps have some tolerance for slurries and, in fact, some manufacturers
have models specifically for that application. Akhtar (1996) presented data on the loss of head
generation and of efficiency that may be expected when a liquid contains particulates of various
types and loadings. Ondrey (2005) presented slurry-pump standards.204 12 In-Plant Transfer of Liquids and Liquid Mixtures with Gases and Solids

Figure 12.29 Moyno progressive cavity pump.
Three specialized types of pumps are recommended for handling solid-containing liquid streams:
progressive cavity, peristaltic, and double diaphragm.
The principle of the progressive cavity was formulated in 1929 in France by Rene Moineau, hence
the well-known Moyno pump. As shown in Figure 12.29, the device consists of
a barrel, an elastomeric lining molded with the shape of a two-start helix, bonded into the bar￾rel, and
a metal one-start helical rotor turning within the barrel and lining.
The rotating screw forms pockets with the lining, and these pockets move progressively toward
one or other end of the barrel depending on which way the screw is turning. The pump is able
to handle high loadings of even abrasive solids and can pump liquids with viscosity up to 1000
pascal-seconds, 10 000 poise. Displacement is positive although there is back-leakage (calculable)
if pumping against a pressure. The Moyno and other brands of progressive cavity pumps have other
attractive features, although they often find themselves pumping mixtures of waste that are less
than attractive. Whitmore (1998) is a reference for this type of pump.
Sealless pumps address a weakness of externally driven pumps: namely the possibility of
leakage along the driveshaft. Most pumps use either a packing or a mechanical seal to minimize or
eliminate leakage,see Section 12.5. A different approach isto eliminate the leakage path altogether
and to turn the driveshaft either magnetically (see Figure 12.30) or electrically (see Figure 12.31).12.5 Ancillary Equipment 205

Although these pumps are a small fraction of centrifugal pumps, they are an effective solution
when the fluid is too toxic or too flammable to be allowed into the atmosphere.
Information on these two types of sealless pumps is given by Brodersen (2001), Carr (1995),
Fegan (1996), Meyer (2001), Nasr (1996), Ondrey (2002), Shelley & Ondrey (1998), Vetter (1996),
and Vanetti (1997).
The “canned” pump, with internal electrical circuits, is safer in atmospheres that may be
flammable or explosive.
12.5 Ancillary Equipment
The transport of fluids requires piping, valves, and other fittings. Devices also exist to prevent the
undesirable transport of fluids, i.e., gaskets at pipe connectors and seals at the driveshafts of pumps.206 12 In-Plant Transfer of Liquids and Liquid Mixtures with Gases and Solids
12.5.1 Conduit
The path to convey fluids comes in many materials and many sizes. It also comes in two general
forms: pipe and tube. By far, the carbon steel pipe is the workhorse in industry and its many dimen￾sions are listed in tables such as in Perry’s handbook. Diameters range from 1/8 inch (nominal)
to 30 inches, wall thickness from 0.049 to 0.625 inch. It is rigid and comes in standard lengths of
20–40 ft. Sections are attached by screwed ends, welding, or flanged ends. Elbows and tees are used
for the change in direction, and reducers for the change in diameter.
Tubing is generally thinner walled, is bendable, and can be obtained in straight sections or in
coils of hundreds of feet. Its inner walls are smoother than pipe. Pieces are joined by soldering or
compression fittings. It is specified by its outer diameter, generally from 1/32 to 9 inches. The wall
thicknessis usually given by BWG (Birmingham Wire Gauge), with BWG being converted to inches
in Figure 12.32.
To obtain a rough indication of the required inside dimension, Table 12.6 may be consulted.
These velocity ranges are a safe compromise between the excessive pressure drop, erosion
of conduit walls, and stagnation. One consideration is to oversize pipe or tube with regard to
future plant expansion. Pressure and pressure drop are calculated using one of the formulae in
Section 12.1.

Figure 12.33 Tensile strength of materials.
The outside dimension is probably best left to a piping designer, who can calculate the wall thick￾ness required to contain the inner pressure. One (among several) formula for this relation is
Pb = 2 × Wt × St∕[OD − (0.8 × Wt)] (12.37)
where
Pb is the bursting pressure, psi,
Wt is the wall thickness,
St is the minimum tensile strength, psi, and
OD is the outside diameter.
For a 2-inch schedule 40 pipe, this works out to
2 × 0.154 × 60 000∕[2.375 − (0.8 × 0.154)] = 8207 psi
The intended maximum operating pressure in the line should be one-third or one-fourth of that
pressure, i.e., 8207/4 = 2051 psi.
The tensile strength depends on the piping material as well as on the temperature. As shown in
Figure 12.33, there begins a marked drop after about 700 ∘F (370 ∘
C).
There are many references on the subject of piping systems. A selection is Maiti (2019), Huitt
(2008A, 2008B, 2007A, 2007B, 2007C, 2007D), Shelley (2005), and Bandel & Lawson (2002).
Recommendations for pumping of hazardous fluids are presented by Huitt (2010) and Grossel
(2008).
12.5.2 Valves
The flow of a fluid often needs to be controlled or else to be manipulated in order to control some
other variable. Valves and fluid movers are the two methods of exerting control, valves being the
passive means and fluid movers being the active means. Valves are considered in this section.
Gordon (2009) provided a primer for valve selection. Sahoo (2004) and Herrera (2015) are also
helpful.
Valve bodies are often referred to according to the pressure for which they are rated, but it is
better to refer to the “Class”, which describes the whole spectrum of temperature-wise pressure
capability (Figure 12.34).208 12 In-Plant Transfer of Liquids and Liquid Mixtures with Gases and Solids

Figure 12.38 Typical valve characteristics.
Every stem-operated valve has a characteristic relation between the flow rate and amount ofstem
travel. Three forms of relation are shown in Figure 12.38.
These variations are due to different designs of the valve trim, the interior movable element that
regulates the flow. Assuming the valve is used as the final element in a process control scheme, the
different characteristics have different superiorities depending on what is being controlled: liquid
level, flow, or pressure.
Control systems using valves are discussed by Brucken (ball valves) (2002), Driskell (1983),
Niesen (2008), Noel & Lyons(2001), Purcell (2001), Roth & Stares (2001), Stepanek (2002), and Yu
(2000, 2007, 2008). Sizing control valves is discussed by Connell (1987).
The liquid flow capacity of valves is most simply described by Eq. (12.38),
Q = Cv [ΔP∕SG]
0.5 (12.38)
where
Q is the volumetric flow of liquid through a fully open valve, US gallons per minute,
Cv is the valve sizing coefficient, a number supplied by the vendor,
ΔP is the pressure difference between the upstream and downstream of the valve, psi, and
SG is the ratio of liquid density to density of water.
This equation issubject to various amendments. Darby & Molavi (1997) provided a correction for
viscosities that are significantly above that of water. The stream flow through a valve is captured in
Figure 12.39.
Complications arise when there is a possibility of partial volatilization of the liquid. While the
liquid may be safely above its vapor pressure PV at points “1” and “2”, it may fall below that pressure
at the vena contracta. There are three possible consequences:
P1 P2
Flow through a valve-like contraction
Vena contracta: point of maximum velocity, minimum pressure

1. The formation of vapor may accelerate the velocity into a range where sonic effects limit the
flow. This situation is called choking, and the overall rate of flow Q becomes independent of the
overall pressure differential, P1–P2.
2. As the pressure recovers, the vapor bubbles collapse and cause erosion-producing cavitation.
3. Alternatively, the pressure does not recover to a value greater than the vapor pressure and the
flow persists in a two-phase state, i.e., flashing has occurred.
These situations are illustrated in Figure 12.40. Profile “A” is free of the above effects and simply
follows Eq. (2.8). Profiles “B” and “C” show vapor formation at the vena contracta. Profile “B”
illustrates cavitation, and profile “C” illustrates flashing.
Manuals such as the Fisher Control Valve Handbook provide the methods and constants for
predicting the behavior of specific valves.
Pressure relief valves: The function of some valves is to provide relief from excessive pressure
in a system. The valve is normally closed, but it opens to allow the material to escape when a set
internal pressure is exceeded. Special treatment is required if the material is in two-phase or is
viscous. There is a wealth of articles on these important valves. Listed here is a selection:
Brosius & Dial II (1997), Darby & Molavi (1997), Darby (2000), Darby et al. (2001), Darby et al.
(2002), Darby (2003), Diener & Schmidt (2004), Fauske (1999), Mofrad (2008), Ouderkirk (2002),
Simpson (1991), and Van Ness (1997).

valve choices, and Torzewski (2008) illustrated valve types.
A valve of a different sort is the steam trap, which is able to distinguish between the two phases,
allowing condensate to pass and barring steam vapor. There are various designs. These devices often
malfunction, and some references deal with the problem: Sahoo (2005), Page (2006), and Marshall
(2007).

Transfer of Gases: Compression and Vacuum
Gases and liquids share the common designation of fluids, and they share some of the same meth￾ods of being moved. However, there are several differences in their characteristics that make the
technology different:
● Gases are compressible, unlike liquids which have close to constant density even under condi￾tions of extreme pressure.
● In moving a gas, there may be appreciable ∫ PdV work of compression.
● The work of compression may be accompanied by a significant temperature rise.
● Pressures can range from high vacuum, e.g., 10−6 atmospheres, absolute to as high as anything
encountered in liquid transport, e.g., 104 atmospheres, giving an overall range of 1010.
● If the gas is a vapor, that is, if it is below its critical temperature, then compression may bring on
liquefaction.
Section 13.1 introduces the subject of compressible flow and presents equations for calculating
pressure drop and maximum flow rate in gases undergoing significant pressure drop during flow.
Section 13.2 introduces fluid movers, the devices which impartsome combination of momentum
and pressure to impel a gas to move. The mechanical input produces heat, which causes temper￾ature to rise. This may or may not be important. It is not usually a factor for the small differential
pressure across fans and low-pressure-rise blowers but is a major factor in large compressions.
Sections 13.3 and 13.4 discuss fans and blowers, respectively, which have relatively low ratios of
outgoing to incoming pressure – the compression ratio, CR. Many of these devices have character￾istics similar to pumps for liquids.
Section 13.5 deals with compressors, which have more robust CRs. Their function may be to gen￾erate super-atmospheric pressure on the outgoing end or to support vacuum on the incoming end.
Section 13.6 also deals with compression but by the use of a nonmechanical device, the ejector.
Section 13.7 shows methods for calculating power consumption and temperature rise during
compression.
13.1 Compressible Flow
The density of a gas can be highly variable, depending on temperature and (approximately
linearly) pressure. This variability, when the pressure change is small, is easily gotten around in
pressure-drop calculations by either assuming that the density is constant or taking an average of
initial and final densities. In this case, the equations of liquid flow are carried over into gas flow.
There is no exact condition where compressibility must be treated more seriously, but the general

rule is when the velocity exceeds 0.3 of the speed of sound or when the change in pressure is above
ten percent. In Section 13.1, the equations for pressure drop in compressible flow are developed.
The complexity of compressible flow is inherent in the Bernoulli mechanical energy balance for
a flowing fluid:
P1∕𝜌 + (g∕gc) Z1 + u1
2
∕(2 gc) + 𝜂 Wf = P2∕𝜌 + (g∕gc) Z2 + u2
2
∕(2 gc) + hf (13.1)
where P is the pressure,
𝜌 is the local density,
Z is the elevation
g is the acceleration due to terrestrial gravity,
gc is the Newton’s second law conversion factor, kg m s−2 N−1 ( =1),
u is the fluid local velocity,
Wf is the mechanical energy input, the work term,
𝜂 is the efficiency factor, and
hf is the rate of energy loss due to friction.
Dropping the elevation terms and the work term and taking differentials,
dP∕𝜌 + d(u2
∕(2 gc)) + 4 (u2
∕(2 gc)) (f ∕D)dL = 0 (13.2)
where the last term is the expression for hf, the rate of energy loss due to friction, and f is the
Fanning friction factor(see also Chapter 12 for a comparison of Darcy and Fanning friction factors).
13.1.1 Isothermal Constant-Area Pipe Flow
For incompressible flow of gases and liquids in a pipe of constant cross section, only the first and
third terms are used, assuming that the velocity stays constant. The commonly used equation is as
follows:
For incompressible flow, P1 − P2 = 4 f (L∕D) 𝜌 u2
∕(2 gc). (13.3)
To extend to compressible flow, it is necessary to take the middle term into account because
the density and velocity change as the pressure decreases. Equation (13.2) is first converted by
substituting G/𝜌 for u, where G is the mass velocity, kg s−1 m−2.
Then 𝜌 is replaced by PM/(RT), assuming the gas to be ideal, where M is the molecular weight
and R is the gas constant,
dP∕(PM∕(RT)) + d(G2
R2
T2
∕(P2
M2 2 gc)) + 4 (G2
R2
T2∕(P2
M2 2 gc)) (f ∕D)dL = 0 (13.4)
It can be shown that the final result is
P1
2 − P2
2 = (N G2
RT∕(gc M)) (1 + (2∕N) ln(P1∕P2)) (13.5)
where N is 4 f L/D for a pipe of length L and diameter D. This equation is the general expression
for pressure change in an isothermal flow. It reduces to Eq. (13.3) as P2 and P1 become closer.
Equation (13.5) requires an iterative solution if P2 is being sought. If P1 and P2 are known, it is
solved directly for G. To see the consequences of this relation, a specific case was calculated, show￾ing the effect of P2/P1 on density, volumetric velocity, and mass velocity. Whereasin incompressible
flow, the mass velocity would have kept on increasing as P2/P1 went to zero; in this case,Greaches a
peak when the volumetric velocity reachessonic velocity (in this case about 377 m s−1) and P2/P1 is
around 0.5. Although the results are for a specific case, the pattern can be assumed as general. The
condition of peak G is called choke flow. The graph to the left of this point is meaningless because
the mass flow is restricted at its choke point.13.1 Compressible Flow 219
13.1.2 Adiabatic Constant-Area Pipe Flow
Industrial pipelines, because of their insulation, are more likely to be closer to adiabatic flow than
isothermal. The same general behavior as in Figure 13.1 is observed. Lapple (1943) studied this sit￾uation and published predictions, which were later corrected by Levenspiel (1977). To take account
of the change in temperature, these predictions incorporate the total energy balance (all in consis￾tent units):
Heat received (in this case zero because adiabatic) = (weight flow)
× [change in enthalpy + (change in volumetric velocity)
2
] (13.6)
The results are shown graphically in Figure 13.2.
The objective is to determine the mass velocity for combinations of pressure ratio, P2/P1, and
frictional loss.

The procedure for using these predictions is as follows:
(1) G* = maximum possible mass velocity when there is no frictional resistance
= P1 ×
√{
[gcM 𝛾∕(R T1)] × [2∕(𝛾 + 1)](𝛾+1)∕(𝛾−1)
} (13.7)
where
𝛾 is the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to specific heat at constant volume, CP/CV,
(2) the maximum possible mass velocity when the frictional resistance is N velocity heads
(for pipeline flow, N = 4 f L/D; for orifice flow, N = 0.63),
(GN∕G∗)max = 1 − exp(−1.435∕N0.484) (13.8)
(3) transition value of pressure ratio
TRAN = (P2∕P1)∕0.53 (see the sloped line in Figure 13.2) (13.9)
(4) if TRAN is less than (GN/G*)max, then the flow is choked and the realizable G/G* equals
(GN/G*)max, and
(5) if TRAN is greater than (GN/G*)max, then
G∕G∗ = [(GN∕G∗)max ∕(1 − X] × SQRT [(1 − Y) (1 + Y − 2X)] (13.10)
where X is 0.53 (GN/G*)max and Y is P2/P1
(the last equation has no theoretical basis and was developed simply to fit the Lapple curves).
Example, N of 5: (GN/G*)max = 1−exp (−1.435/50.484) = 0.482.
For P2/P1 of 0.2, TRAN = 0.2/0.53 = 0.377, i.e., less than (GN/G*)max, so G/G* equals (GN/G*)max.
For P2/P1 of 0.4, TRAN = 0.754, greater than (GN/G*)max; X = 0.53 (GN/G*)max = 0.255,
Y = 0.4, G/G* = [0.482/(1−0.255)] × SQRT [(1−0.4) (1+0.4−2 × 0.255)] = 0.473
which can be checked against the prediction of Figure 13.2.
13.1.3 Converging and Diverging Flow
Pipelines do occasionally narrow or widen. However, the importance of nozzles is their use in cre￾ating sonic and supersonic volumetric velocities and in the creation of vacuum. The equation for a
friction-less nozzle is
[d(P)] × (1 − Ma2
) = [𝜌 u2
∕(A gc)] Da (13.11)
where
P is the pressure at a local point along the length,
Ma is the Mach number, which is local volumetric velocity u divided by the speed of sound,
𝜌 is the local density, and
A is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle at any point along its length.
This equation is directly derivable from Eq. (13.2), with the third (frictional) term omitted.
In a converging nozzle, pressure and density continuously decrease, while volumetric velocity
increases. If Ma of 1 is not reached, then the nozzle acts simply as another piece of pipe.
From Eq. (13.11), it is obvious that the pressure can no longer decrease when Ma of 1 is reached.
This puts a limit, a choke, on the flow.
If the exit of the nozzle is directly into a low-pressure environment (e.g. the atmosphere), then a
shock wave establishes itself at the exit, where a sudden change in pressure occurs.13.2 Gas Movers – General 221

Pressure
If instead the flow is guided by installing a gradually diverging nozzle after the choke point, the
pressure keeps on decreasing but only gradually and the volumetric velocity rises – into the super￾sonic range. With proper geometry, it is possible to create a zone ofsubatmospheric pressure which
can be used to draw a vacuum. See Figure 13.3.
For more information on compressible flow, consult Demneh & Mesbah (2008), Kenkre (2013),
Kumar (2002), Shackelford (2015), Teng et al. (2014), and Yu (1999).
13.2 Gas Movers – General
Gas movers come in three types: fans, blowers, and compressors. A key parameter is CR, the CR,
PDiscarge/PInlet, P2/P1, where the pressures are in absolute units. This parameter is often used to
classify gas movers. In practice, each device operates over a range of CR and there is overlap rather
than a sharp demarcation. As will be seen in the discussion of fans, the ISO definition is not based
directly on CR, but it doesrestrict fans and blowersto a CR of 1.3 or less. However, above that value
are regenerative blowers that can produce CRs of 1.7 and multistage centrifugal blowers up to 2.7.
Beyond that is definitely the province of compressors. To some extent, the designation is in the eye
of the beholder.
If the gas is ideal or if its compressibility factor Z is close to constant, then the ratio of absolute
temperatures entering and leaving is given by
T2∕T1 = (P2∕P1)
(𝛾−1)∕𝛾 (13.12)
where 𝛾, i.e., CP/CV, is around 1.4 for many common gases.
The consequences of this relation can be seen in Table 13.1.
Two observations may be made:
● Forlarge CRs, overheating may cause (i) damage to the equipment, (ii) higher gas volumes which
lower the efficiency of the operation, and (iii) possibly dangerous conditions in the gas. Cooling
is required, and in multistage compression, cooling must be done within or between stages.
● For small pressure ratios, it may be permissible to ignore these effects.
Fans are dynamic (as opposed to positive displacement) devices and come in two types, centrifu￾gal and axial. There are fundamental differences between the two types, and they are considered
separately.
Compressors are considered to start at CRs above 1.2 or 1.3. In general, the devices are mechan￾ically driven and they comprise both dynamic and positive displacement types. Another gas
mover/compressor is the ejector, a nonmechanical system in which a high-pressure motive gas
entrains a gas stream of lower pressure and produces a combined stream of intermediate pressure.
The ejector is similar to the liquid-flow eductor but is more powerful because of the ability of the
motive gas to become supersonic and assume extremely low pressure.222 13 Transfer of Gases: Compression and Vacuum

13.3 Fans
The ISO definition of a fan (including blowers) is that the mechanical energy, Wf, imparted to the
gas is less than or equal to 25 000 J kg−1. It is instructive to calculate this energy. From thermody￾namics,
Wf = P2V2 − (P1V1 + ∫ P dV) = ∫ V dP = ∫ (1∕𝜌)dP (13.13)
where V is the specific volume of the gas, m3 kg−1.
If the density is assumed constant,
Wf = (P2 − P1)∕𝜌 (13.14)
To apply the condition that Wf is 25 000, consider the case of air, at density of 1.2 kg m−3, drawing
from the atmosphere, at P1 of 101 325 Pa,
P2 = P1 + Wf × 𝜌 = 101 325 + 25 000 × 1.2 = 131 325
giving
CR = 131 325∕101 325 = 1.3
The theoretical power can be calculated as
W × Wf = W × (1∕𝜌)×(P2 − P1) = Q × (P2 − P1) (13.15)
where W and Q are the weight flow and volumetric flow,respectively. However, the actualrequired
power is always greater – see Eq. (13.16).
13.3.1 Centrifugal Fans
Centrifugal fans (and blowers) are entirely analogous to centrifugal pumps. They use a vaned rotor
to impart rotational velocity and centrifugal force to the gas, which is opposed by pressure exerted
by the fan casing. The gas undergoes a ninety degree change in direction, entering at the center of
the rotor and leaving tangentially from the outer periphery of the casing. A typical fan and impeller
are shown in Figure 13.4.
The vanes can take one of five different forms, as shown in Figure 13.5. Qualitative performance
curves are shown for each style of vane, where13.3 Fans 223

SP is the static pressure, which is the term used in practice to denote the pressure rise across the
fan, i.e., ΔP is the differential pressure,
BrP is the brake power, which is the term used in practice to denote the power delivered to the
rotor impeller [as opposed to the power simply to compress the gas (Q × SP)], and
Q is the volumetric throughput of gas.
The behavior of a fan operating with constant impeller diameter, constant average gas pressure,
and constant RPM is shown in Figure 13.6. As the throughput increases, the SP (i.e. the pressure
rise across the fan) changes. For some vane types (other than radial), there is a slight increase at
low Q, but then the SP gradually drops to zero, at which point the capacity of the fan is capped.
Operation in the rising SP is unstable. In fact, the optimum operating point is about one-quarter of
the way down the decreasing-SP curve, giving the maximum mechanical efficiency and allowing a
range for fan control. The mechanical efficiency is defined as
ME = Q × SP∕BrP (13.16)
units of (m3 s−1) (N m−2)/W. Other units for theoretical power (Q × SP) are
Power = volumetric flow × static pressure × 0.0361 × 144 × 33 000−1
Horse- cubic feet inches water psi sq. in. horsepower
Power minute inch water sq.ft ft-lb/minute
The reason for the decrease of SP with Q isthe loss of pressure due to the friction of flow between
the vanes, as evidenced by the square-law dependence of SP loss versus Q.
The manufacturer of fans presents a table of fan performance from which the purchaser looks
for a fan that best supplies the need. From one catalog, a sampling of data for a specific style and
size of a fan is given in Table 13.2. For a desired air flow and SP, the table presents the required
speed of rotation and the resulting brake power.
It is instructive to plot these data in the form of Figure 13.6. The data have been interpolated to
show the effect of rotational speed (Figures 13.7 and 13.8).
Two observations stand out:
(1) the major effect of fan speed on both SP and brake power, and
(2) the presentation of data in the catalog is only for the region of likely operation, i.e., at or close
to maximum efficiency, Q × SP/BrP. The calculated efficiencies range from 0.54 to 0.78, with
most cases near the high end.13.3 Fans 225

Figure 13.7 Characteristics of a commercial fan: static pressure.
There are three laws of affinity for centrifugal fans:
(1) Q, volumetric flow of gas is proportional to rotor speed x rotor diameter3, N D3,
(2) SP, static pressure is proportional to rotor speed2 × gas density × diameter2, N2 𝜌 D2, and
(3) BrP, brake power is proportional to rotor speed3 × gas density × diameter5, N3 𝜌 D5.
These proportionalities, for Q, SP, and BrP, are often inexact, but they give an idea of the direction
and magnitude of changes. The first two are useful in devising one possible control for gas flow.
Figure 13.9 is an expansion of Figure 13.6, showing
● SP curves for three different rotational speeds and
● curves for downstream pressure drop, System Pressure Curve (SYSP), due to piping and other
equipment. They are roughly proportional to the flow rate.226 13 Transfer of Gases: Compression and Vacuum

characteristics.
If the rotational speed is rps2 and the downstream pressure follows the SYSP #1 line, then the
combination of SP and Q is at point “A”. If the downstream pressure shifts to SYSP #3 (perhaps
by opening a valve or louver), and if it is desired to maintain the same flow, then the point of
intersection must shift to point “B” and the rotational speed must shift to rps3. Mapping out these
curves would help to set the constants for a control system.
This type of flow control requires a variable-speed drive. An alternative is to install an adjustable
louver downstream of the fan to provide an additionalsource of pressure loss which can be manipu￾lated to compensate for changes in system pressure drop, SYSP. This method costs energy. Another
method is to install adjustable inlet vanes which cause swirl in the incoming flow and weaken the
ability of the fan to develop pressure, which conserves horsepower.
A parameter called specific speed is derived from affinity laws 1 and 2 by expressing them in
explicit form:
Q = kQ N D3 and SP = (kS∕gc) N2 𝜌 D2
where the constants kQ and kS depend on the style of fan, mostly the shape of the vanes.
By eliminating the diameter D, the following equation results:
Q0.5 N 𝜌0.75 SP−0.75 gc
−0.75 = kS
0.75 kg
−0.5 = constant (13.17)13.3 Fans 227
The left-hand side expression, the specific speed, is dimensionless and provides a distinction
between fans that are intended for moving the gas rather than developing pressure versus fans
that are mainly required to develop pressure. It is independent of fan size but rather describes a
class of fans. The purchaser should therefore estimate specific speed (using a likely value for N)
and search for a sufficiently sized fan in that category.
13.3.2 Axial Fans
Axial flow fans move gas in the same direction as the axis of rotation. They tend to have higher
specific speeds than centrifugal because they are used more for moving gas rather than developing
pressure. They have the same affinity laws as centrifugal fans.
There are three general types: propeller, tube-axial, and vane-axial. Propeller types are generally
completely in the open, as, for instance, in domestic fans, sometimes with a peripheral plate to
reduce backflow. The SP is practically nonexistent, 250 Pa or less. They are used industrially to
move large volumes of gas or vapor.
Tube-axial fans surround the rotating vanes with a tube, giving greater directionality and allow￾ing some pressure to be developed – e.g., 3–4 inches of water, 750–1000 Pa. Figure 13.10 shows a
typical tube-axial fan.
Vane-axial is a refinement of tube-axial but with an implanted set of vanes which convert much
of the swirl created by the rotating vanes into useful axial motion. They also allow the angle of
incidence (the pitch) of the rotating vanes to be set higher, generating more flow and pressure.
Both tube-axial and vane-axial are intended to be connected into piping systems.
Flow control of axial fans can take three approaches. The first two are the same as for centrifugal
fans, namely speed manipulation and upstream or downstream louvers. A third approach, specifi￾cally for axial fans, usesthe pitch of the rotating vanesto alter the SP-Q relation. Ideally, a means of
changing pitch on the run would be ideal, but an expensive construction. More likely, the pitch is
set ahead of time and louvers are used for fine-tuning. Pitch-control uses less energy than louvers.

New York Blower Company.228 13 Transfer of Gases: Compression and Vacuum
One manufacturer provides curves of SP and brake powerfor pitch angles of 4, 6, 10, 12, 14,showing
considerable variation across this range and scope for designing and controlling the device.
Fans are discussed by Jenkins (2012, 2013) and Martin & Martin (2019).
13.4 Blowers
The distinction has already been made among the three types of gas movers. It is summarized in
Table 13.3. The values for CR are specifically for supply pressure at 1 atmosphere, 101 325 Pa.
A fan at its very highest CR would be called a blower in some circles.
13.4.1 Regenerative Blowers
The regenerative blower and high-CR centrifugal devices are often used interchangeably, but their
principle of operation is different. Centrifugal fans and blowers use their vanes to trap the gas and
accelerate it toward the casing where the kinetic energy is converted into pressure. The velocity
of the gas is more or less the same as the linear velocity of the vanes. The inlet and outlet are at
right angles to each other, as seen in Figure 13.4. Regenerative blowers also have vanes, but they
act in a different manner. As the gas enters the impeller chamber, it is picked up by a vane which
accelerates it toward the wall. However, the periphery connects to a side channel which directs the
gas back to the base of the vanes, at which point another vane picks it up and repeats the cycle.
Each vane adds pressure to the gas, which gradually works its way around the chamber. As seen in
Figure 13.11, the gas inlet and outlet are in the same plane as the rotational plane of the vanes.
The constant “regeneration” of the gas as it moves from vane to vane, and its gradual increase
in pressure is what gives this blower a pressure advantage over centrifugal gas movers, as seen in
Table 13.3. Centrifugal blowers tend to be used where the flow capacity is more important than
pressure development, and regenerative blowers are used where the pressure development is key.
13.4.2 Rotary Lobe Blower
A photograph of the internals of a rotary lobe blower is shown in Figure 13.12. Unlike other blow￾ers and fans, which are classed as dynamic, this blower is of the displacement type. As shown in

A blower consisting of several centrifugal units, each one feeding the next, is capable of generating

Lamson and Hoffman company.
Blowers are discussed by Bloch (2009), and lobe blowers by Blanton (2002) and Bloch (2012).
13.5 Compressors – Mechanical
The generation of flow and the generation of pressure are common to all gas movers. A distinc￾tion among them is that fans focus mainly on flow, blowers focus on both flow and pressure, and
compressorsfocus mainly on the generation of pressure. In general, compressors handle CRs of 1.3
and higher, although regenerative, rotary lobe, and multistage centrifugal blowers reach into this
territory.
A compressor may be tasked with raising gas at ambient pressure (one atmosphere for air) to a
pressure above ambient. Alternatively, it may draw from a region of lessthan ambient and discharge
to ambient, i.e., creating or maintaining a vacuum. The same equipment may be suited for both,
but some are better suited for one or the other task.13.5 Compressors – Mechanical 231
Figure 13.14 Hoffman multistage centrifugal blower (Courtesy Gardner Denver).
Figure 13.15 Sliding-vane compressor.
For vacuum generation, the three mechanical devices are the rotary lobe blower (as shown in
Figures 13.12 and 13.13), the rotary sliding-vane pump, and the liquid-ring pump.
As a vacuum producer, the rotary lobe pump can sustain pressures as low as 60 mmHg abs,
8000 Pa, and 0.08 atmospheres.
A sketch of the sliding-vane pump isshown in Figure 13.15. The rotorislocated off-centered from
the casing, and the spring-loaded vanes move in and out. Their fullest extension is at the inlet. The
trapped gas is compressed as the rotor turns, and it is expelled at the point of minimum volume
and maximum pressure. A single stage can maintain a pressure of 15–20 mm. Hg abs and multiple
stages can lower the upstream pressure to 0.001 mmHg abs or 0.13 Pa. Oil is usually injected to
lubricate, seal, and cool.
The liquid-ring vacuum producer is shown in Figure 13.16. A rotor with vanes circulates liquid
around the periphery of a noncircular chamber. The space between the liquid and the rotor varies
around the chamber. Gasisintroduced at two points of maximum space (pointsI) and is withdrawn
at two points (points D) of minimum space, having shrunk and gained pressure. Vacuum as low
as 100 mmHg abs is attained by a single stage. If the gas tends to liquefy, that liquid may be what232 13 Transfer of Gases: Compression and Vacuum

is circulated around the chamber. Sometimes a liquid-ring compressor is teamed up with another
vacuum producer, providing a dumping spot for any in situ liquid or condensate.
The subject of vacuum generation is discussed by Collins (2012), Croll (1996), Datta (2008), Fay
et al. (2000), Govoni (2017), Torzewski (2008), and Vibert (2004).
Compressors that convert ambient-pressure gas into high-pressure gas are the following: recip￾rocating, centrifugal, screw, scroll, and axial.
One version of a reciprocating compressor is a simple device where the forward motion of a piston
reduces the volume of gas in a chamber and increases its pressure to equal the pressure down￾stream. On the backward motion, the low-pressure feed is pulled into the chamber. The piston may
have a chamber on both sides, fore and aft, acting at 180∘ from each other. Maximum CRs are 4–8.
A conceptualsketch of a single-acting pump isshown in Figure 13.17, illustrating the spring-loaded
valves that control flow into and out of the compressor. Efficiencies are generally high, at 80–90%.
A weakness of piston compressors is the possibility of leakage around the piston. This limits the
CR. A solution, also reciprocating, isthe reciprocating diaphragm compressor. Instead of contacting
a piston, the gas contacts a sealed flexible diaphragm, which is moved in and out by an attached

rod or by hydraulic oil behind it. A schematic is shown in Figure 13.18. This device can deliver the
highest pressure of any compressor and a higher CR than a piston unit. High-CR devices are more
likely needed for low molecular weight gases which require a higher adiabatic head.
Centrifugal compressors are similar to fans and blowers of the same type. They are popular
because they can be made to high capacity, have low contaminating oil injection, and are reliable.
Although each stage has a low CR (less than 3), they can be staged to produce a high CR of 20 or
more. A schematic is shown in Figure 13.19. There are two features that must be accounted for.
One is that head of fluid, rather than pressure, is delivered by the device. Since the SP, ΔP, equals
Head × gas density × gc, centrifugal compressors are not suitable for low-density gases. The other
is that the SP-versus-Q characteristic has an upward slope at low flow – see Figures 13.6 and 13.9.
The throughput must be kept above this region to avoid instability – known as surging.
Screw compressors use two counter-rotating dissimilar elements to trap and pressurize gas and
then to expel it. Asseen in Figure 13.20, one screw has cavities and the other haslobes which fit into
the cavities. Since the number of cavities and the number of lobes are generally not equal, the screws
turn at two differentrates. Timing gears are used to allow fortight fit, but without interference. With
no lubrication, the CR can be up to 5, and with lubrication 20 or more.

A scroll compressor consists of two spiral elements, one fixed and the other moving eccentrically
in contact with it. Gas (or liquid) is trapped and moved from the inlet to outlet. Clearance is very
tight. This is a quiet compact device, used in domestic and automotive service. CR is typically 3–4,
but also 8–9 by some reports.
An axial-flow compressor consists of a single central rotor containing aerodynamically shaped
vanes and a stator also containing aerodynamically shaped vanes. The rotating vanes, using the
principle of lift, impart pressure and a small amount ofswirl to the gas. The stationary vanesredirect
the swirl into the axial direction. Axial compressors are more efficient than centrifugal, and they
have the highest capacity of all compressors. See Figure 13.21 A comparison of compressors is
presented in Figure 13.22.
Compressors in general are discussed by Barnett & Schramke (2000), Bloch (2012), Bloch &
Geitner (2014), and Jandjel (2000). Almasi (2010) and Gong & Wan (2005) discussed reciprocat￾ing compressors. Centrifugal compressors are the subject of Almasi (2012C), Sorokes (2013), and
Wilcox (2007). Screw compressors are treated by Almasi (2012A) and Sofronas (2008).13.6 Ejectors 235

13.6 Ejectors
An ejector uses the principles of compressible flow and allows a high-pressure stream to create a
zone of low pressure (see Figure 13.3) into which a lesser-pressure stream is drawn and mixed.
The arrangement and flows are shown in Figure 13.23. Ejectors are used in two main applications236 13 Transfer of Gases: Compression and Vacuum

(1) using a high-pressure gas (usually steam) to create a vacuum, and
(2) upgrading a low-pressure stream of no value by combining with a high-pressure stream to cre￾ate a mid-pressure stream of value.
With steam as the motive force, there is the possibility of arranging ejectors in series to create
very low absolute pressures. A two-stage system is shown in Figure 13.24. The diagram shows a
number of features:
(1) intercoolers between the vessel and the first ejector and between the two ejectors, in order to
liquefy most of the steam,
(2) the use of a “bleed stream” to moderate and control the vacuum, and
(3) the use of barometric legs to allow condensate to flow to an atmospheric-pressure receiver.
The capability of an ejector is obtained from the graphs in Figure 13.25. This set of curves is an
extended version of the plot in Perry and Green, which is taken from the work of DeFrate & Hoerl
(1959). The objective is to determine the flow of motive gas (WM) for
a given CR, the ratio of absolute discharge pressure PD (probably
atmospheric for a single ejector) to suction pressure PS and
a given ratio of suction pressure PS to motive gas pressure PM.
The procedure is as follows:
● on the right-hand side of the chart, at the intersection of the two ratios, find the required ratio of
throat area to nozzle area (AT/AN);
● on the left-hand side, at the intersection of the AT/AN curve and the PS/PM line, read off the ratio
WS/WM on the bottom line, suction flow/motive flow;
● knowing the required process suction flow, WS, calculate the required flow of motive gas as
WS/(WS/WM).
For example, if PM, PD, and PS are 800, 100, and 8, respectively, in absolute units, then the chart
shows the required AT/AN to be around 15 and WS/WM to be around 0.04.
Another example, for waste steam upgrading, with PM, PD, and PS at 1825, 240, and 100 kPa,
respectively, is the chart that indicates an area ratio of 20 and a flow ratio of suction to motive of
around one. That is, one weight unit of high-pressure steam is required to boost one weight unit of
low-pressure steam into a useful pressure.13.6 Ejectors 237

The flow rate of motive gas is given by
Wm = 146 000 PM AN∕TM0.5 for air as the motive fluid and (13.18)
Wm = 113 000 PM AN∕TM0.5 for steam as the motive fluid (13.19)
The units are WM kg h−1, PM kPa, AN m2, and TM ∘C. In sizing an ejector, these equations get
reversed to solve for AN, the area of the nozzle.
Ejectors are the subject of papers by Lieberman & Cardoso (2016), Nayek & Venkatesh (2005),
and Temur et al. (2013).
13.7 Thermodynamics of Gas Compression
The compression of a gasrequires energy, and it also raisesthe temperature of the gas. These effects
can be calculated, but they are always subject to an efficiency factor.
The energy of compression is given by the general formula
Wf = P2 − P1 − ∫ P dV = ∫ V dP = ∫ (1∕𝜌) dP (13.20)
where
Wf is the energy (J) per unit (kg) of gas,
V is the volume (m3) of unit of gas, and
𝜌 is the density (kg m−3).
For compressible flow, it is necessary to account for the variation of density with pressure. Often
the process is close to adiabatic, and the relation is
P∕𝜌𝛾 = P1∕𝜌1
𝛾 (13.21)
where
𝛾 is CP/CV, the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to specific heat at constant volume.
Substituting into Eq. (13.19) gives
WFadiabatic = [𝛾∕(𝛾 − 1)] [P1∕𝜌1]
[
(P2∕P1)
(𝛾−1)∕𝛾 − 1
]
. (13.22)
The temperature rise is calculated from the other adiabatic relationship,
T2∕T1 = (P2∕P1)
(𝛾−1)∕𝛾 (13.23)
which can be shown to be
Tadiabatic − T1 = Wfadiabatic∕CP (13.24)
Compression is accompanied by irreversible energy losses so that energy consumption and tem￾perature rise are both greater than above. An efficiency factor 𝜂adiabatic may be applied such that
𝜂adiabatic = (T2 adiabatic − T1)∕(T2 actual − T1) = Wfadiabatic∕Wfactual (13.25)
An example is shown, for P2/P1 of 5, 𝛾 of 1.4, T1 of 50 ∘C, and 𝜂 of 0.75,
from Eq. (13.12), T2/T1 = 1.58 and T2 adiabatic = 1.58 × (50+273.16)−273.16 = 237 ∘C;
from Eq. (13.14), T2 actual = [237+(0.75−1) × 50]/0.75 = 299 ∘C, i.e., 62∘ above T2 adiabatic.
If a Mollier diagram (enthalpy versus entropy) exists for the gas, then the compression can be
graphed. In Figure 13.26, the adiabatic compression of steam from 30 psia (and 320 ∘F) to 50 psia13.7 Thermodynamics of Gas Compression 239

along a line of constant entropy isshown. The initial enthalpy is 1200 btu lb−1, and the adiabatically
compressed enthalpy would be 1245 btu lb−1.
If the process were ideal, the compressor would provide 45 BTU per pound and the gas tempera￾ture T2 adiabatic would be 420 ∘F. However, if the adiabatic efficiency is only 50%, then the actual final
enthalpy is 1200+45/0.5, i.e., 1290 btu lb−1. The combination of this enthalpy with 50 psia isshown
as point 3, and it indicates that the actual final temperature T2 actual will be 505 ∘F. This is the most
accurate method of calculation because it makes no general assumptions about the particular gas.
The large discrepancy between adiabatic and actual predictions has led to a different approach
in which the index 𝛾 (=CP/CV) is replaced by an arbitrary index n in Eqs. (13.10)–(13.12), chosen
to bring predictions closer to reality. Thus,
P∕𝜌n = P1∕𝜌1
n (13.26)
and
Wfpolytropic = [n∕(n − 1)] [P1∕𝜌1]
[
(P2∕P1)
(n−1)∕n − 1
] (13.27)
As opposed to adiabatic (an isentropic process), this approach is termed polytropic.
Since it is impossible to choose a single value of n to suit every case, a vendor will choose the
mean value and then correct individual cases by a polytropic efficiency factor, 𝜂polytropic. Then
Wfactual = Wfpolytropic∕𝜂polytropic (13.28)
T2 actual = T1 + Wfactual∕CP (13.29)240 13 Transfer of Gases: Compression and Vacuum

Formation and In-Plant Transfer of Solids
Unlike liquids and gases, solids have shape as part of their description. The shape may be a three￾dimensional pellet or powder, a two-dimensional film, or a one-dimensional filament. A particular
solid may be produced from the reduction in size from larger particles, from the removal ofsolvent,
through coating and agglomeration, or by molding during solidification from a melt.
The operations presented in this chapter are focused solely on solids in the form of pellets,
powders, or other small entities. Sections 14.1–14.3 deal with the solids themselves, treating size
reduction, size agglomeration, measurement, and characterization. Sections 14.4–14.6 deal with
the transport of pellets and powders within a plant.
14.1 Solid’s Size Reduction
The objective, here, is to use size reduction to produce the desired pellet or powder, starting with
some othersolid that may already be a pellet or may be in some otherform. There is no agreed-upon
dividing line in size between pellets and powder – usually, it is quite obvious. The term “granule”,
coming from grain, encompasses both pellets and powders. “Particle” is also used to denote both
the in-process and final products.
Several methods of size reduction are in use, and new embodiments of these methods are con￾stantly being developed, with the goal of
● being able to handle wider classes of materials,
● producing tighter distributions of size and shape, and
● requiring less energy.
With regard to materials, one device – the cutting mill – is used for relatively soft materials and
for materials near the top of the hardness scale. Some other devices are suitable only for harder
materials. Their capability is often matched against the scale of hardness proposed by Friedrich
Mohs (Table 14.1).
With regard to distribution, every collection of solid pellets has some variation of size,
as illustrated in Figure 14.1. Most often it is desired that this graph be as close to the ideal line as
possible – i.e., that the pellets be uniform. A long tail on the left-hand side extension of the graph
means there is a fraction of small particles that could end up as dust. The fineness of cut is often
quantified by d97, which is the diameter below which 97% of the weight of the particles falls.
With regard to shape, uniformity is usually desired. The shape is commonly a sphere or an ovoid.
Also common is the right-angle cylinder (length/diameter = 1, generally) obtained by continuous
cutting of a moving strand of material.

where E isthe energy in kW-h ton−1, the coefficients C are specific to the expression and the device,
and df and dp are the diameters of the feed and final product, respectively.
Even if the values of the coefficients cannot be ascertained for a particular device, the expressions
allow comparisons for various feed and product diameters.
The methods of size reduction can be divided into two categories:
passive – where the material is simply cut or crushed;
impact – where the material is moved about at high speed and participates in its own
reduction.14.2 Cutting Mills 245
The impact category itself can also be divided into two subcategories:
without media and
with media, where an extraneous and harder set of pellets or objects is mixed with the pro￾cess material to help with its reduction.
Silverberg et al. (1998) reviewed the family of size-reduction methods at that time, and much of
their information is included here.
14.2 Cutting Mills
A cutting mill (a passive device from the point of view of the process material) uses rotating and
stationary knives to cut materials on the shearing edges. Cutting mills are often used with soft,
medium-hard, fibrous, tough materials,such as vegetable matter, plastics, and paper, and industrial
scrap. The feed is often not a pellet but rather a continuous strand or a sheet. The end product size
is a pellet typically 1–6 mm in size.
A different type of cutter is used to convert strands of polymer into pellets. See Figure 14.2.
14.2.1 Crushers
Compressive force between two solid surfaces causes a size reduction. Crushers are often used
in the mining industry to reduce the size of minerals, gravel, and ores. The final particle size is
1–100 mm usually. Crushers may be used in series in order to achieve a low enough final parti￾cle size. A crusher may be used to prepare a feed for another, more sophisticated method of size
reduction. Kumana (2015) recommended practices for optimizing crushing and explained the size
distribution – which is Gaussian.
14.2.2 High Compression Roller Mills
These mills use compressive forces of one particle on another by way of a stationary roll or surface
pressed against a moveable rotating roll to reduce the size of the material (Figure 14.3). This process
again is passive to the process material. They exert at least 10-fold more pressure on the particles
than a coarse crusher. The material in the mill may be air classified (elutriation), or classified upon
exiting the mill. Alternatively, a roll press mill will have exit material in the form of a slab, and a
hammer mill or other universal mill is used to reduce it to its component particles, followed by air

classification. Coarse particles are returned to the roller mill. The roller mill can produce powders
from 5 to 45 μm, and with material which has a Mohs hardness up to 10. Compared to ball mills
(see Section 14.2.7), the power usage can be 50% lower.
14.2.3 Universal and Pin Mills
“Universal” comprises a whole class of mechanically driven impact devices. These are also referred
to as fine-grinding impact mills and make use of the principle of impact against both the grinding
surfaces and impact from interparticle collision and attrition. An example of this type of mill is the
pin mill which uses a set ofrotating pins and a set ofstationary pins. The particle size is determined
by the feed rate and the rotational rate. Other mills are equipped with hammers and screens, but
in all situations, the material hardness is limited to 3 Mohs because of internal (e.g. pin) materials.
The applications of this type of mill are wide and varied and include milling of pharmaceuticals,
food confectionaries, animal feeds, fertilizers, paints, pesticides, etc. If a problem with heat rise is
foreseen, then the mixing chamber is designed to be larger. Universal mills can produce particles
as coarse as d97 of 200 and as fine as d97 of 10 μm.
14.2.4 Hammer Mills
The material enters a chamber where it is struck repeatedly by hammers attached to a shaft that is
rotating at high speed. The material is crushed or shattered by the hammer impacts as well as by
impacts with the wall and with itself. Perforated screens or grates at the exit allow particles to leave
when small enough.
It issimple to stop the mill and change a screen,so the hammer mill isideal when a wide range of
different particle sizes or products are to be produced. Product dimensions are quoted as between
the 90 and 850 μm range. Cryogenic processing can be used which allows soft materials to be made
brittle for easier processing.14.2 Cutting Mills 247

14.2.5 Hammer Mill with Classifiers
Often, a hammer mill will be fitted with a classifier which entrains particles in a gas stream where
a classifier wheel (see Chapter 17, Mechanical separations) is used to reject and return oversized
material back to the mill. The classification system provides a tighter particle distribution in the
final product. The constant air flow reduces temperature and is thus beneficial to a material which
is heat sensitive.
14.2.6 Jet Mills
The original spiral and loop jet mills can produce very fine particles but only on materials with a
hardness up to 3 Mohs. The principle of operation of the devices is to reduce the particle size by
impact and to combine some degree of classification. The particle size is centered around the 10-μm
region (Figure 14.4).
The fluidized bed jet mill (FBJM) incorporates more than one gas inlet and operates internally
with gas at supersonic velocities. Particles are swept upward into an air (or gas) classifier which
separates product from oversized granules, which it drops back into the high-speed flow. With this
arrangement, there is greater separation by sizes than with the simple jet mill. The superiority of
the FBJM is that it can handle materials with hardness of 10 Mohs and produce a final particle size
of 2 μm.
Miranda (2017) reported the use of superheated steam, instead of air, as the motive gas in jet
mills. So long as the process material is able to tolerate the temperature, there are advantages in
fineness and size uniformity.
14.2.7 Dry Media Mills
The media is the grinding media, a set of spheres or rollers which accompany the material being
reduced and which aidsin the reduction. Typical of these millsisthe horizontal dry-ball mill. These
units along with a classifier can produce powdersin the 10–40 μm size. A variety of different config￾urations and materials of construction are possible to provide an iron-free material or for products
with a hardness above 4 Mohs. The media diameter is typically between 0.2 and 5 mm: The fine￾ness of the product is directly related to the size of the media. Although the mill itself is fairly
simple, the classification system can become sophisticated to ensure a narrow range in particle
distribution.
14.2.8 Wet Media Mills
These mills are very similar to their dry counterparts but provide finer particulates, e.g., 1 μm
in size, at lower energy costs than a dry mill. Wet media milling can produce particles less than248 14 Formation and In-Plant Transfer of Solids

50 nm, which is the upper limit for an object to be classed as a nanoparticle. The liquid phase
can be a solvent, and the mill can produce paints and inks. Way (2007) explained the technology.
Wet processing can produce a particle size distribution that is not possible or not economical in dry
processing. However, more recent developments in dry processing have narrowed the gap.
The various processes are compared in Figure 14.5 for the sizes of their end product.
For background on choosing a size-reduction device, the following references are useful:Jenkins
(2012), Clement & Purutyan (2002), Johanson (2013), Dhodapkar & Theuerkauf (2011), Miranda
(2017), and Silverberg et al. (1998).
14.3 Formation of Granules
Having dealt with the reduction in particle size, it is now important to look at growth. The objec￾tive is to cause individual particles to accrete together to form larger granules. The reasons for so
doing are
● ease of handling, i.e., elimination of flow problems that occur with finer particles,
● requirement for larger granules in the end product,
● reduction of dust, and
● control of solubility.
It is conceivable that the results of a size-reduction step might then be subjected to a rebuilding
step in order to narrow the distribution or swallow up troublesome low-size particles.
All processors are termed granulators because the end product is a granule. There are two groups
of processes: agglomeration and pressure compacting. In all cases, success depends on the particles
actually holding together. Mehos & Kozicki (2017) listed the possible binding forces, which may be
summarized as follows:
● solid binders that adhere to the particles,
● liquid bridges that fill the interspaces and develop capillary force,
● Van der Waals forces, valence forces, and hydrogen bonding, and
● solid bridges resulting from sintering and from partial melting and recrystallization.14.3 Formation of Granules 249
Mehos & Kozicki listed a number of potential binders, 10 of which are inorganic and 11 organic.
Ennis(2010A) listed the ingredientsthat may be used in wet granulators. They are the solid itself,
water or other solvent, binders, diluents, flow-aids, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricants, fillers,
and end-use aids.
The ratio of water to solid in wet grinding is 40–90% of the water which could be held in the
particle-to-particle matrix. Any excessive water must subsequently be removed, typically by vac￾uum drying or in a fluidized bed.
In wet processes, the mechanism of granule building comprises three parallel steps:
● wetting and nucleation, where two or more particles become attached,
● coalescence and growth, and
● consolidation, where an equilibrium is attained between growth and attrition.
The following descriptions are of four wet agglomeration processes.
14.3.1 Tumbling Granulators
Disc or drum tumbling granulators are suitable for generating solids in the 1–20 mm range.
Generally, they use a continuous feed of solids and wetting liquid to slowly enlarge the solid size.
In the case of a drum granulator, a large (up to 4 m in diameter) inclined (0 to 10∘) cylinder rotates
at 7–17 rpm, while the material flows in almost plug flow (first in, first out) manner. Scrapers are
sometimes employed to prevent buildup on the inside of the drum.
Disc granulators operate on the same agglomeration principle but with a more sophisticated
geometry. A revolving disc is mounted at an angle closer to vertical than horizontal. Solid and
liquid are continually fed onto the disc, and itsturning movement bringssolids up to the top where
they roll down and pick up other solids. As granules reach a certain size, they become too heavy
for this lift and they collect at the bottom where they are removed. There is enough classification
that there is no need for recycle, in contrast to the drum process which does use recycle because of
its broad range of product sizes in its output.
14.3.2 Mixer Granulators
Material 0.1–2 mm in size can be produced using mixer granulators. These devices use an agitator
to mix particles and liquid to create the granulation. They are particularly adept at handling sticky,
plastic type materials and are less sensitive to operating conditions than tumbling granulators.
14.3.3 Fluidized Granulators
Fluidized bed and spouted beds are suitable for producing solids in the range of 0.1–2 mm.
The particles can exhibit two distinct characteristics: They may become highly porous due to the
agglomeration of powders or evolve into high-strength layered granules as a result of seed particles
being coated by liquid feeds. Fluidized bed granulators provide simultaneous drying and particle
size growth.
14.3.4 Centrifugal Granulators
Primarily used in the pharmaceutical industry to generate particles of size 0.3–3 mm. In all of the
various designs, the feed enters a horizontal disk rotating at high speed to form a rotating rope-like250 14 Formation and In-Plant Transfer of Solids
solid. The particles created are spherical and can be coated if a liquid feed is provided. The particles
created are usually denser than those made in a granulator. Capital costs are higher than most
other types of granulators. Rotary fluidized bed designs are possible which provide simultaneous
drying.
14.3.5 Spray Methods (Spray Drying and Prilling)
Spray processes include spray dryers, prilling towers, and flash dryers. A variety of different
feeds (solution gel, paste, emulsion, slurry, and melt) can be accommodated. For a spray process,
the particle size is typically small (0.05–0.5 mm), which is dependent on the spray droplet size.
The solvent which is evaporated must be dealt with.
Prilling also uses a spray, but the purpose of the spray is simply to act as a heat-transfer medium,
to cool and solidify pellets of molten material dropped down a tower.
In the situation where fines are an issue, a fluidized system or hybrid fluid-bed spray dryer can
be used.
14.3.6 Pressure Compaction
Pressure compaction uses an external force to join particles which then maintain shape through
interparticle bonds. There are confined-pressure devices such as pistons, tableting, and roll presses
which can exert the necessary forces; alternatively, extrusion devices such as pellet mills and screw
extruders can be used.
14.3.7 Thermal Sintering
Solids may be combined through the use of elevated or reduced temperatures. This phenomenon
may be applied in conjunction with othersize enlargement processes or by itself. Metal powders are
often joined with this technology (sometimes with a binder). High temperatures with associated
operating costs are required (Figure 14.6).
Further information on these technologies is obtained in the following references:
Ennis (2010A, 2010B), Mehos & Kozicki (2011), Mehos & Kozicki (2017), and Pietsch (2007).

14.4 Measurement and Classification
Along with the processes that produce particles, another process is sometimes carried out, namely
classification, the sorting of a stream of particles into parallel streams of different size ranges. Con￾trolling all of these processes requires feedback, which requires the analysis of the final products:
determination of size and size distribution as well as particle shape. The methods may take place
offline or, more modernly, online where control can be done in real time.
Trottier & Dhodapkar (2014) listed 11 methods of particle sizing, the ranges of which are shown
graphically in Figure 14.7. They describe each method in some detail. Some of the oldertechniques,
such as sieving and sedimentation, are done offline. Others require high skill levels and are also
performed in the lab.
At the moment, the most common method in the industry of determining size and distribution
has been laser diffraction, a technique which covers a wide range of sizes and which can support
online feedback control. Online systems are discussed by DeNigris & Ferrari (2012), Pugh (2007),
and Pugh & Blasco (2005) based on laser diffraction. Thistechnique is based on the extent of diffrac￾tion being dependent on the particle size. Light is shone through a stream of particles in liquid,
and the diffracted beam is passed through a Fourier lens which directs the extents of diffraction to
a number of sensors. Jenkins & Duffy (2016) singled out four common techniques: sieving, laser
diffraction, imaging, and dynamic light scattering.
A number is needed to denote the average diameter of the particles. There is more than one way
to define this number, that is, there are different diameters for the same collection of particles,
Number–average diameter = [1,0] = ∑ni di
/∑ni (14.4)
where ni is the number of particles in the size range around di
. This definition of average counts
every particle of whatever size as contributing equally to the average.
The denotation [1,0] means that di appears to the first power in the numerator and to the zeroth
power in the denominator.

In this average, particles with larger area count for a more significant part of the average,
Volume–average diameter = [3,0] =
(∑ni di
3
/∑ni
)1∕3
(14.6)
In this definition, the higher-volume particles exert a greater contribution to the average.
The area-average is often suitable because it is at the surface of particles that mass transfer or
reaction or catalysis occurs. However, there is a fourth definition which is even more suitable,
Sauter mean diameter = [3,2] = ∑ni di
3
/∑ni di
2 (14.7)
This expresses the ratio of volume to surface area.
To compare these expressions, consider a mixture of 3 particles of diameter 2, 5 of diameter 6,
and 4 of diameter 9,
[1,0] = (3 × 2+5 × 6+4 × 9)/(3+5+4) = 6.0
[2,0] = [(3 × 2 × 2+5 × 6 × 6+4 × 9 × 9)/12]1/2 = 6.6
[3,0] = [(3 × 2 × 2 × 2+5 × 6 × 6 × 6+4 × 9 × 9 × 9)/12]1/3 = 6.94
[3,2] = (3 × 2 × 2 × 2+5 × 6 × 6 × 6+4 × 9 × 9 × 9)/(3 × 2 × 2+5 × 6 × 6+4 × 9 × 9) = 7.8.
The order of these numbers is general for whatever distribution, not just this example.
Applying these definitions to an actual collection of particles requires representative sampling,
a detection method that can sort the particles into size groups, and an algorithm to calculate these
averages. Depending on the end use toward which the particles are heading, one or the other of the
averages can be used as the control variable for the particle production or classification process.
A stream of particles may have too wide a size distribution for the intended application.
For instance, the low end of the size range may cause a dusting problem. The high end may
have oversized particles that disrupt the smoothness of paints and finishes. Classification is
needed in order to narrow the distribution. Wet or dry screening can eliminate unwanted sizes.
Sedimentation can weed out the oversized particles. Chapter 17, Section 2, although it is aimed
at separating particles of different composition, is useful in discussing solid–solid separation in
general. Crawley et al. (2002) compared three methods of air classification:
● elutriation, useful for fine particles, can be used as a preprocessor for vortices,
● free-vortex, similar to a cyclone, separates coarse particles from the rest, and
● forced vortex uses a vaned rotor to aid peripheral motion.
Some of the size-reduction processes incorporate a built-in classifier to eliminate dust and to
separate large particles which are recycled to the reduction zone.
Powders may pose flow problems with caking, and this subject is taken up by Armstrong et al.
(2014), Marinelli (2014), Mehos & Clement (2008), Mehos (2016), and Purutyan et al. (2005).
Powders or dust from pellets are a potential explosion hazard. Amyotte et al. (2003), Brazier &
Rooker (2009), Dhodapkar et al. (2006), Dhodapkar et al. (2007), Ebadat (2003), Kessler (2014), and
Zalosh et al. (2005) presented remedial measures for this very important problem.
14.5 In-Plant Transfer of Solids
Nearly every chemical plant must handle a solid at some point in the process, whether as a
raw material, additive, or finished product. Often the handling equipment for solids falls into
the domain of the mechanical engineering department, but it is not uncommon for chemical
engineers to be involved also. Preferably gravity (via chutes usually) should be used since it is the14.5 In-Plant Transfer of Solids 253
most reliable. Where gravity cannot be used, two classes of solids conveying systems are used:
mechanical conveyors and pneumatic conveying.
In first determining the means by which a solid should be transported, the physical properties of
the material should be understood. Properties such as:
● is the material friable (breaks apart easily)?
● is the material sticky, hydroscopic?
● what is the particle size and is it dusty?
A mechanical conveyor system is suitable when:
● materials require gentle handling and
● a high capacity (material flow rate) is required.
A pneumatic conveying system is suitable when:
● flexible routing is required,
● sealing the system (i.e. conveying under nitrogen, dry air, or when high levels of dusts might be
harmful), and
● there are multiple pickups or discharges.
Mechanical conveyors are summarized briefly:
● Belt
⚬ High capacity
⚬ Can handle large particles
⚬ Does not break up the material (low attrition)
● Screw (Rigid or flexible helix)
⚬ Screw conveyors can convey under dry air or nitrogen
⚬ Heating or Cooling can be done
⚬ Inclined and vertical orientation are possible
⚬ Can damage the material, but usually not very much
● Vibratory
⚬ Good for short distances
⚬ Slight inclines are allowed. Spiral vibratory conveyors for larger inclines
⚬ Can be sealed at both ends providing dust tight systems
⚬ Not good for sticky, damp powders
● En Masse
⚬ Drag disk and aeromechanical
⚬ Drag chain and Redler
⚬ Bucket elevator
Screw conveyors are discussed by Boger (2008) and by Podevyn (2009).
Pneumatic conveying utilizes the principal that energy in the form of air pressure and velocity
will move solidsthrough a pipe. The principal is commonly encountered in your household vacuum
cleaner. Two things need to be present to make solids flow using air. They are as follows:
1. The velocity of the air must be greater than the pickup or “saltation” velocity of the solids.
In other words, the material must become swept up into the air stream before it will move.
The pickup velocity can be determined from a theoretical point of view using drag coefficient
calculations, or you can measure it using a real system.254 14 Formation and In-Plant Transfer of Solids
2. As the air and solids move down the line, particles impact the pipe, slow down, and then are
accelerated again by the air. This absorbs energy and steadily reduces the pressure of the air.
Thus, there must be enough initial pressure in the air to offset the energy losses or the line will
stop moving and become plugged.
There are two basic types of conveying systems, vacuum and pressure. Pressure systems are then
subdivided into dilute-phase (high velocity) and dense-phase (low velocity) systems.
Within the dense phase category, there are several different variations provided by a variety of
different vendors (Figure 14.8).
Dense-phase conveying maintains the particles in a state of incipient fluidization, and it allows
the use of lower velocities, which normally means the material has less attrition by the time it
reaches the end of the conveying system. Dense-phase conveying systems are usually more expen￾sive to purchase (partially due the need for pressure piping, flanges, and screw compressors or use
of higher-pressure air), so the advantages offered by reduced velocities need to be justified. The
sizing of dense-phase conveying systems is normally left to the vendor and usually vendors that
can provide both dilute and dense-phase conveying should be consulted so as to seek out the most
economical system that meets the needs of the process. It is not uncommon for the pneumatic
conveying vendor to request a sample of the material for testing so that they can properly design
the system and provide performance guarantees. Crouch (1998) compared the dilute and dense
approaches.
Dilute-phase conveying can be provided in positive-pressure and negative-pressure systems.
Negative-pressure systems are well suited to situations where there are multiple pickups
(i.e. a central vacuum system in your house), and positive-pressure systems are well suited
where there are multiple destinations. In both systems, the standard equipment used is either a
positive-displacement rotary lobe type blower or in small systems, sometimes a regenerative type
blower (Figures 14.9 and 14.10).
Dilute phase systems can be sized with reasonable accuracy using straightforward calculations
that are based on an energy balance [Gerchow (1975)]. There is one empirical factor, the material
sliding friction coefficient, which depends on material properties and should be based on actual
experience with the material being conveyed.
The gas flow can be estimated early on from the phase density for a dilute phase conveying system
which is approximately 20 lb of material per lb of air for pressure systems and 10 lb of material per
pound of air for vacuum systems.

The pipe size is chosen to make the gas velocity high enough to pick up the solid particles from
the bottom of the horizontal pipe. Cabrejos & Klinzing (1994) gave the following equation:
Required pickup velocity (m s−1
) = 0.042 8 × pipe Reynolds number
× (Pipe diameter∕particle diameter)
0.25 (solid density∕gas density)
0.75
× √(acceleration due to gravity × particle diameter)
Knowing the gas volumetric flow, different pipe diameters can be chosen and tested with this
equation until a match is achieved. A smaller diameter and a larger velocity will be chosen, but
constraints are that (i) resistance to the air flow itself adds to the cost of operation and (ii) high
velocities erode the pipe surface.256 14 Formation and In-Plant Transfer of Solids
As the solids flow, they lose energy, which is calculated in the following four-part summation:
TME = Total material energy loss rate in foot–pounds force∕second (or in watts)
= acceleration + elevation + horizontal friction + elbow loss (14.8)
where
acceleration loss = 0.5 M × V2/gc,
elevation loss = M × H,
horizontal loss = M × distance × Sfc,
elbow loss = number of elbows × [M × V2/(gc × R)] × (2 × π × R/4) × Sfc,
M is the solid mass flow, pounds per second (or kg s−1),
V is the velocity of the gas–solid mixture, feet per second (or m s−1),
gc is the conversion – 32.2 lb mass × ft/(lb force × s2) or 1 kg mass × m/(kg force × s2),
H is the height of the vertical section (positive if upward), feet (or meters),
Sfc is the sliding friction coefficient, around 0.7 for plastic pellets, and
R is the radius of the elbow
(note that the radius of the elbow divides out in the Eq. 14.8).
Convert the total material energy loss rate into differential pressure:
Pressure drop due to solids (lbf∕sq ft) = TME (ft-lb force∕sec)∕gas volume flow (cu ft∕ sec)
The material losses are not the only the pressure drop in a system. If the chosen line size is too
small, the air losses through the system can be excessive and other items such as pickup boxes,
cyclones, filters, and diverter valves should be added (Table 14.2). The air losses should be calcu￾lated using compressible flow calculations for the entire length of pipe (air only pipe+ material
conveying pipe),
Total system pressure drop = Solids ΔP + Air ΔP + Other Losses.
When the differential pressure has been calculated, the actual pickup air velocity should be cal￾culated and compared to that which is required (for polymer pellets, the pickup velocity should be
greater than 4200 ft min−1).
The smallest line diameter should be selected that:
(1) ensures the pickup velocity for the material is met,
(2) the differential pressure of the blower is within practical values (for a rotary lobe blower, the
max discharge pressure is usually about 14 psig and minimum vacuum pressure is−7 psig), and
(3) other considerations such as future expansion should be considered.

A solids handling system will inevitably include one or more points where the material is accu￾mulated or lagged. Quite often this point is just before a feeder which is being controlled to supply
the next process step. It would seem that such a prosaic operation of material-holding could have
little effect on the overall system. This is true if the holding vessel is properly designed. Otherwise
there is the possibility of introducing nonuniformity into the particle stream and/or of causing the
outflow to be erratic or even stopped. These phenomena have been much studied over time.
The vessel that holds the pellets or powders is generally vertical and cylindrical and is called a
bin or silo. At the bottom is the hopper, a contraction down to an opening suitable for supplying
the feeder. The hoped-for result is that material will flow uniformly down the vessel, i.e., first in is
also first out. This is termed mass flow. Mass flow does not correct any time-wise variability in the
incoming feed, but it does not introduce any new variability.
The alternate to mass flow isfunnel flow, where substantial materialsettles on the sloping walls of
the hopper. The steady flow occupies only the central part of the hopper, as shown in Figure 14.11,
a phenomena known as “rat-holing”. Parts of the held-up material may break off at random inter￾vals, thus introducing a potential variability into the outflow. That material may, for instance, have
become degraded or at least different.
A second difficulty occursright at the point of discharge, where a collection of material, instead of
exiting, forms a coherent bridge or arch acrossthe opening. This obstruction may cause the outflow
to be reduced, either steadily or randomly, either partially or totally, and can starve the feeder.
These two difficulties mostly affect powder flow, where the interparticle forces are greatest.
Flow of pellets are less likely to suffer.
A third problem, which affects all sizes of particles, is segregation of sizes. If there is more than
a 30% difference in the diameters among particles, then small and large particles have a tendency
to separate. This may happen at the top of the pile, where larger particles roll across the surface
toward the wall. It may also happen if a gas (e.g. air) is used to aerate the mass. Also, if particles are
of different species and have different densities, then segregation can occur.
The measurement of solid properties is essential to answer these problems. Five properties are
listed by Mehos et al. (2018):
● cohesive strength,
● internal friction,
● compressibility,

● wall friction, and
● permeability.
In the vertical part of the vessel, gravity is the dominant force, and friction exerts only a minor
influence. However, in the hopper, gravity is reduced to a vertical component. Sometimes hoppers
are made too short in order to save height and material. Friction and high cohesive strength com￾bine together to plate the walls. Mehos et al. described test procedures (ASTM D-1628, D-6773) to
measure these properties and how they are used to predict how steep the hopper walls must be in
order to allow free flow and the desired mass flow situation. The tests produce a wall friction angle
which, in combination with hopper angle, delineates the boundary between mass flow and funnel
flow. See Figure 14.12.
Although the vertical part of the vessel may be cylindrical, the hopper can be transitioned into
a wedge shape. As it turns out, such a configuration is less prone to arching, particularly if the
bottom opening extends lengthwise across the bottom of the wedge. Wedges may also be allowed
to be lesssteep that conical. In general, all hoppersshould err on the steep side, even at the expense
of requiring higher vessel height.
Mehos et al. also proposed criteria for arching.
Dhodapkar et al. (2016) and Carson et al. (2016) gave calculations for discharge rates from bins.
Maynard (2012) dealt very completely with the segregation of particles due to size or density. The
mechanisms are described, and possible remedial steps are presented. These steps group into
● changes to the material,
● changes to the process, and
● changes to the equipment.
Other references on segregation are Bates et al. (2010), Carson (2004), Maynard (2008), Marinelli
(2006), and Mehos & Maynard (2009).

With the exception of segregation-due-to-fluidization, a
vessel in mass flow mode is better able to minimize the
effects of segregation. Fluidization occurs when gases are
added to a powder in order to help flowability [see Dho￾dapkar & Konanur (2005) and Purutyan et al. (2006)].
Bates et al.showed insertsforthe transition zone of a bin
which help to promote mass flow. See Figure 14.13. They
list the specific problems which each style of insert helps
ameliorate.
General references on bin flow are Carson et al. (2008), Johanson (2002), and Maynard (2013).14.7 Solids Feeding 259
14.7 Solids Feeding
The end point of a solids system is delivery either into a package or into a processing vessel. The
required consistency of feed depends on the nature of the destination. There are two types of
feeder – volumetric and gravimetric – and the former typically provides accuracy of weight flow
within 2–5%. Gravimetric is required for tighter control.
Marinelli & Miller (2017) listed seven types of volumetric feeders, of which the following are the
most used: screw, belt, rotary valve, and vibratory.
Screw feeders consist of a rotating shaft with flights wrapped around it and turning in a close
fitting trough. The flights push material along as they turn. The feeder is fed from a bin, and it is
important that the bin has been designed to allow a steady flow to reach the screw. The screw may
have a fairly sophisticated design along its length, with the flight depth being varied by changes
to the diameter of the rotating shaft and with the pitch of the flights also changing. Some designs
eliminate the shaft and simply have a spirally wound impeller turning in an enclosure.
Screw feeders can be oriented at any degree from the horizontal, from 0 to 90∘. Roberts (2015)
showed graphs of throughput versus speed for various angles of orientation. Bell et al. (2003) pre￾sented a guide to selection and use of screw feeders.
Belt feeders convey material on an endless belt. The rate depends on belt speed and belt loading.
In this case, to control rate, the discharge from the bin needs either a vertical screw in the hopper
or an adjustable gate.
Figure 14.14 Rotary valve.
Rotary valve feeders make use of rotating vanes attached in parallel
to a horizontal turning shaft, as shown in Figure 14.14. The system is
enclosed in a tight-fitting casing so that neither particles nor air can
flow backward. The speed of the rotation dictates the material flow,
providing the bin is designed to provide a uniform flow to the valve. A
pipe section between the bin and valve helps to eliminate preferential
flow from one side of the bin. This type of feeder is not suitable
for sticky materials, nor should it handle abrasive solids which will
damage the casing or the vanes and ruin the seal. Rotary valves are
also used at pellet pickup points when the pneumatic transport is
under pressure.
Vibratory feeders agitate the solid particles on a pan with a cyclic
motion, which throws them up slightly and forward slightly. The rate
is controlled by frequency. The extent to which a material responds
to the vibration depends on the particle size, cohesive strength,
and other properties. Key factors in design are the frequency range,
amplitude, and throw distance. Yandrick (2009) discussed up to date
developments.
Gravimetric feeders comprise weigh-belt feeders, loss-in weight
(LIW) systems, and gain-in-weight (GIW) systems.
The weigh-belt feeder is like the volumetric belt feeder, but is
mounted on load cells for continuous weighing. The material flow
rate is calculated from the speed of the belt combined with the weight
of the apparatus (minus the tare).
The LIW system precedes the feeder (e.g. a screw feeder) with a hopper mounted on load cells.
The rate of weight loss, and hence the feed rate, is controlled by manipulating the speed of the260 14 Formation and In-Plant Transfer of Solids
feeder. Provision must be made for the short occasions when the hopper has to be replenished.
Titmas & Carey (2007) discussed the choice of scales and load cells.
GIW applies only to batch operations, with the receiving vessel being mounted on load cells.

Heating, Cooling, and Change of Phase
It is a rare process in the chemical industry that does not require some exchange of thermal energy.
Examining many possible processes shows that 10 situations arise, as shown in Figure 15.1. For
gases and liquids, the substance may be a process stream or it may be a heat transfer fluid (HTF)
conveying heating or cooling to the process flow. The apparatus for any process must, among its
other considerations, be chosen and designed to facilitate the required exchange of energy.
In Section 15.1, several means by which energy is exchanged are considered individually for
ten situations. In subsequent sections, a number of ancillary topics are discussed: heat-transfer
media, insulation,shell-and-tube heat exchangers, plate-and-frame heat exchangers, modeling and
control, thermal integration and pinch technology, new developmentsin heat exchangers. A recent
review by Kleijn (2020) deals with heat exchangers and with the causes of heat-transfer surface
fouling.
15.1 Process Substances and Their Thermal Modifications
The three states of matter present different faces to the transfer of heat, made more interesting by
the occasions where one state converts into another. Gases must often be raised to high tempera￾tures and pressures if they are to react at a desired rate and equilibrium. Liquids, if they are to stay
liquid, must operate within constraints. Solids are the state which has shape: powder, pellets, film,
and thread-lines. Sometimes a mixture of a liquid and a solid – e.g., a paste orsuspension – requires
energy exchange.
15.1.1 Gas/Vapor Heating
The sensible heating of a gas or vapor is impeded by its relatively low coefficient of heat transfer.
When the gaseous and liquid forms of the same substance are subjected to the standard Dittus–
Boelter equation for flow in a pipe,
hDk−1 = 0.023 Re0.8 Pr0.333 (15.1)
the calculated “h” values (the heat transfer coefficients) can be an order of magnitude different.
However, a gas or vapor has the advantage of tolerating extremely hot heating surfaces.
Heating from an electrical element is effective but expensive at large scale. Direct firing is cheaper.
Cross (2002) discussed temperature gradients in fired heaters. Radiant heat for complex gases
(unlike simpler gases like oxygen) works at high temperature, where gases are often raised

for reaction. If a gas is combustible, then a small amount of air or oxygen
can be injected to combust a small fraction of the flow and provide heat.
Because convection varies as h × area, then one way to speed it is to
increase the area – that is, the area in contact with the gas. This is done by
fitting the heat source with fins, over which the gas flows. See Figure 15.2.
The inside of the heat source has good heat transfer, so the fins have high
temperature. Ganapathy (2013) presented quantitative data on types and
density of fins.
15.1.2 Gas–Vapor Cooling
Cooling of a gas or vapor presents the same problem of low heat transfer coefficients. As with
heating, a heat extractor can be equipped with finsfor effectiveness. Anecdotally, a study of a stream
of waterin a pipe being cooled by an external flow of airshowed a threefold increase in heat transfer
by the use of fins.
Water or other liquids can cool gases, either by spraying or by countercurrent flow in a packed
column.
15.1.3 Vapor Condensation
A vapor may condense on the cold surface of a condenser vessel.If the heat transferistoo great, then
a difficult-to-deal-with “fog” forms in the bulk of the vapor as well as at the cold surface. Fogs are
assumed to have low gas-like heat transfer coefficients versus the higher heat transfer coefficients
of condensing gases.
Condensation can take place into a falling film of the liquid phase. Also, a spray of liquid may be
enough to turn most of the vapor into liquid, leaving the rest for a secondary condensation.
Non-condensable gases may likely be present and must be allowed access for their escape.
Figure 15.3 shows an efficient condenser for handling small flows. The slope in the piping inlet
for the incoming process gas allows for non-condensable gases to leave when inlet gas velocities
are low. High gas velocity on the process side may benefit from a non-condensable gas vent at the
outlet of the exchanger, or at a high point, depending on the relative density of the gases, and where
gas velocities have dropped.15.1 Process Substances and Their Thermal Modifications 265

Vapors sometimes must be disposed of while under vacuum. A condenser may be used to turn
most into liquid, leaving the rest to be handled by an ejector or mechanical producer of vacuum.
Lines (2017) discussed this arrangement.
Wilhelmisson (2003) showed a compact condenser. Other references are Buecker (2003) and
Durand et al. (2002)
15.1.4 Liquid Vaporization
Occasionally, a pure liquid must be turned into its vapor. Usually, the liquid is part of a solution,
with the vaporization being done to separate componentsthat are volatile. Two cases are asfollows:
● reboiling in a distillation column and
● concentrating of components, as in the refining of sugar.
Reboiling is typically done in a kettle heated by internal piping carrying heat-transfer fluid
(e.g. steam). A kettle is defined as a shell-and-tube exchanger with no baffles. Figure 15.4 shows a
schematic.
Kettle operation is discussed by Das (2012), Hagan & Kruglov (2010), Kister & Chaves (2010),
Ondrey (2011), and Tammami (2008).
Evaporation of a solvent is often done inside the pipes of a verticalshell-and-tube heat exchanger.
When the motive force to keep the liquid and vapor mixture moving is the difference in density

Liquid Liquid
Heating
media266 15 Heating, Cooling, and Change of Phase
between the two-phase mixture in the tubes and the liquid phase elsewhere, the exchanger is usu￾ally called a thermosiphon reboiler.
Evaporation is energy intensive unless heat can be recovered from the generated vapor. In some
cases, if the evaporation is at high pressure, the vapor may be used for heating. If the vapor is steam
and if the evaporator is heated by steam – a common combination – then vapor recompression can
greatly cut the need for fresh steam. The concept is shown in Figure 15.5.
The benefits are shown in Table 15.1. Conditions are for a difference of 30 weight units between
the liquid feed and liquid product. In the calculation, no account is taken of the dependence of
latent heat on pressure and temperature.
Cooper & Lyon (2004) discussed applications of mechanical vapor recompression (MVR).
A companion concept uses an ejector to add pressure to the recycle flow.
Gabelman (2020) and Glover (2004) discussed evaporators.

Thermosiphon evaporators are highly efficient vaporizers. They
comprise two parts:
● a vertical tube bundle inside a heated shell and
● a holding tank to provide head forthe circulatory motion of the mix￾ture (Figure 15.6).
The source of heat isthe condensation of a heat-transfer fluid vapor:
It could be steam if there is sufficient temperature across the tubes.
Technology of these evaporators is referenced in Kister & Van Doorn
(2019), Zadakbar et al. (2008), and Zygula & Barkat (2000).
Liquid can also be vaporized by being sprayed into a hot
atmosphere.
Figure 15.7 shows a vaporizer that would be useful at lab or
pilot-plant scale.
15.1.5 Liquid Heating
A liquid can be heated by electrical dissipation, by infra-red
radiation, and, if the liquid possesses an adequate dielectric
constant, by microwaves. However, the most common approach
is to use another fluid of higher temperature and to extract from it latent and/or sensible heat.
A simple example is the double-pipe heat exchanger, shown in Figure 15.8.
Double pipes are not common, but they do provide a gateway into the most common type of
exchangers, the shell-and-tube (Figure 15.9), where one or more tubes pass through a heated shell.
The exit temperatures – from fluid leaving the tubes and from fluid leaving the shell-side – are
calculated asin Figure 15.8, but then a correction factoris applied to account for deviation from the
pure countercurrency of the double-pipe configuration. These factors are given in Perry’s handbook
for various types of arrangements. It is recommended that no design be based on a value of this if
the factor is less than 0.8.
There are many combinations of dimensions, number of tubes, number of baffles, and number
of tube passes. More information and some references on this important device are provided in
Section 15.4.

Figure 15.9 Shell-and-tube heat exchanger – typical.
Liquid heating (and cooling) is often done in vessels, which is discussed by Garvin (2001, 2005)
and Gentilcore (2000). A coil carrying hot heat-transfer fluid, vapor or liquid, is a good addition to
heating through the walls.
Bagley (2002) proposed submerged combustion for heating water.
An alternative to shell-and-tube is provided by the plate-and-frame exchanger, which is discussed
in Section 15.1.6.
15.1.6 Liquid Cooling
If the liquid to be cooled is water, then there are traditional methods: cooling towers and spray
ponds. Large cylindrical cooling towers are ubiquitous, sited around power-generating plants
where hot water is a by-product. Hot water is fed around the periphery at the top, and air (at less
than saturation) is fed from the bottom. Dendy (2008) and Goyal (2012) presented suggestions for
design and upgrading of cooling towers.
A shell-and-tube can certainly be used to cool liquids and isthe choice at high pressures. Another
device is the plate-and-frame heat exchanger. It consists of vertical plates, sealed around the edges,
with the space between them alternately being traversed by one or the other of the two fluids.
Figure 15.10 illustrates the principle. A frame is used to support and to align the plates for close
leak-free fit. One of the great advantages is that more plates can be added at will. All plates are sup￾ported on a frame. Plate and frame exchangers are often installed to recover heat from the cooling
of liquids.
15.1.7 Liquid Solidification
Processing may require a material to be in liquid form, but the ultimate product may be a solid.
Pellets, film, and strands are common.
If a liquid forms itself into a ball after passing through a multi-hole plate, and then drops into a
pool of water, a relatively uniform pellet results. Subsequently, the pellets must be separated from
the water and dried.

The Sandvik company market their Rotoform® process, which turns a liquid stream into liquid
pellets, which are then cooled and solidified on a moving belt. The belt issprayed with cooling water
on its underside. The process produces highly uniform pellets and is used in the food industry and
the polymer industry.
Watery solutions of wood (and other) fibers are processed over a series of felts and heated roles
to remove water and produce paper.
Molten polymer is “spun” as slender streams from multi-hole “spinnerets” and solidified by cool
air into solid fibers.
15.1.8 Solid Melting
Solids are frequently melted on a heated plate.
They may simply be added continuously to an inventory pool of already molten material.
They may be crushed and heated in the screws of an extruder.
15.1.9 Solid Heating
A solid can be heated in a column by a countercurrent flow of hot air or other gas. It can also be
heated by a hot gas in a fluidized or spouted bed, provided it is not friable.
Some solids with the right electrical properties are susceptible to microwaves.
A gentler heating is obtained in a thermal screw, provided by a number of manufacturers and
shown schematically in Figure 15.11.
15.1.10 Solid Cooling
The cooling of solid particles can also be accomplished in a thermal screw or in packed or fluidized
beds. Adham (2000) described different types of equipment for extracting heat from hot solids:
stationery coolers, rotary coolers, fluidized beds, and conveyor coolers. Mehos (2014) examined
different types of bed cooling. Solids on trays are cooled by passage of countercurrent air, nitrogen,
or other gas.
15.2 Heat Transfer Media
The term “media” encompasses all the fluidsthat aid in the heating, cooling, and transformation of
process materials. Thus, water,steam, air, and even liquid nitrogen qualify, along with the specialty
materials that we usually think of as HTFs.270 15 Heating, Cooling, and Change of Phase
Beteta & Ivanova (2015) discussed an application where liquid nitrogen was the coolant.
Chu (2005) gave heat transfer predictions for air-cooled exchangers.
Durand et al. (2012) and Winter & Peress (2003) examined cooling water practices.
Risko (2004) discussed the control of steam heating during fluctuating demand.
HTFs are used when steam or waterisinadequate. Forinstance,steam at 257.1 ∘C has a condens￾ing pressure of 40 atmospheres or bars, which would require impractically heavy-walled piping and
vessels to contain it. Instead, a well-known HTF, Dowtherm A®, a eutectic mixture of diphenyl and
diphenyl oxide (DP:DPO) is used which condenses at one bar. Even at 400 ∘C, its maximum useable
temperature in practice, its pressure is only 10.6 bars. This material can serve as both liquid media
and condensing-vapor media. As a liquid, it serves in cases where it may have to control temper￾ature by supplying or absorbing heat. The disadvantage (of any HTF used as a liquid) is that its
temperature changes as heat is given up, so large amounts may need to flow. As a vapor, it supplies
its latent heat (although only about 1/5 as much as steam) and its flow path must be designed to
avoid flooding and vapor lock. A schematic of a liquid system is shown in Figure 15.12 and of a
vapor system in Figure 15.13.

Dowtherm A, along with other Dowtherm’s, is sold by the Dow Chemical Company. The same
composition is sold as Therminol 66 by the Eastman Chemical Company, again as part of a stable
of HTFs.
Hudson (2011), Jenkins (2009, 2012), and Sahasranaman (2005) assisted in designing HTF sys￾tems. Gamble (2006) spoke of cost management. Arseneault (2009) and Armstrong & Arseneault
(2015) discussed degradation of HTFs, which is to be anticipated because of the high temperatures
(in spite of the relative stability of the compounds). Gamble & Schopf (2010) and Jenkins (2013)
dealt with leaks, and Oetinger (2002) discussed fires. Oetinger (2011) troubleshoot HTF systems.
15.3 Insulation, Tracing, and Fouling
One of the persistent problems in heat transfer is the gradual accumulation of degraded material
on heat transfer surfaces, which reduces the overall heat transfer coefficient. Kleijn (2020) distin￾guished four sources of fouling:
● chemical, where the chemistry in the process produces a by-product that adheres,
● biological, where organisms in the process fluid grow and adhere to surfaces,
● deposition, where particles in the process fluid settle out, and
● corrosion, where the metal surfaces produce a layer of low conductivity.
While every process substance has its own propensity for fouling, some general guidelines can
be followed:
● minimize the temperature of surfaces in contact with the process material,
● avoid regions of stagnation,
● maximize the velocity of the process flow,
● provide and maintain smooth surfaces of metal surfaces,
● avoid high fluxes that bring on film boiling, and
● make sure the material of the heat-transfer surface is compatible with the process.
An anonymous article (2006) and Panchal (2004) have suggestions regarding fouling.
Neste (2004) discussed tube velocities to minimize fouling rates and therefore factors and
costs. Cross (2009-11) discussed fouling for fired heaters.
Insulation is everywhere in a chemical plant, and it should logically be included in the design.
It is an initial expense, and it can be an ongoing financial drain if it is not adequate or if it needs to
be frequently replaced. Durand et al. (2015), Hart & Yarbrough (2010), Hart (2014), Jenkins (2016),
and Melton & Bittner (2019) provided information on this subject.
If piping is kept warm only by insulation, then the process fluid will lose heat at some small rate.
Heat transfertracing may be needed. Electrical heating tape is common.Jenkins(2010, 2015)spoke
about steam tracing and later about hot-oil tracing.
15.4 Shell-and-tube Heat Exchangers
Any serious proposal to design a shell-and-tube exchanger needs to start with Tubular Exchanger
Manufacturers Association (TEMA), the TEMA. This group has established standards for con￾struction, has defined the various combinations of shell and tube, and has developed software for
flow-induced vibration and expansion joints.272 15 Heating, Cooling, and Change of Phase
Shell-and-tube exchangers have received much study over the years. Several authors explained
the basic design: Bennett et al. (2007), Bhattacharyya & Mukherjee (2016), Greene (1999), Jones
(2002), Poddar & Polley (2000), Raza (2013), and Singh (2015).
Some specific aspects of design are as follows:
● selecting baffles, Bouhairie (2012),
● designing for flexibility including phase change, Butterworth (2004),
● calculation of pressure drop, Gulley (2004),
● choice of TEMA exchanger category, Mukherjee (2004), and
● allowing for two-phase flow in design, Polley et al. (2012C).
Enhancement of tubes is discussed by Nasr & Polley (2002), Ploix & Lang (2012), and Shilling
(2012).
Shell-and-tube heat exchangers are vulnerable to any action that weakens the sealing of tubes at
the headers, or tubesheet. One mechanism that makes this happen is the vibration caused by the
lateral passage of the shell-side fluid across the tubes. Specifically, the wake behind a tube releases
as a regular string of vortices, which can interact with the natural frequency of the tube. This
may lead to tube leakage, with mixing of the two fluids – with more or less serious consequences.
A number of workers have written about vibration: Babakr et al. (2010), Dole et al. (2015), Polley
et al. (2012B), Sofronas (2007), and Sutar (2016). Yokell (2005, 2007) has written on the general
topic of mechanical integrity and maintenance. A second mechanism that can cause the tube to
tubesheet connection to fail is differential thermal expansion of the tubes and shell. This can occur
when there are different materials used between the tube and shell, when there are significant
differences of temperature between the tube and shell, and when fixed tube sheet exchangers are
utilized. Consideration and checking for thermal expansion should be given whenever the shell
and tube process temperatures at either end differ by more than 93 ∘C (Ludwig 2002).
15.5 Plate-and-frame and Other Heat Exchangers
Design of plate-and-frame exchangers is treated by Haslego & Polley (2002) and, in more detail,
by Srinaphasawadi & Tanthapanichakoon (2014). Kerner(2009) cautioned against misconceptions.
Polley & Haslego (2002A, 2002B) examined one use of these exchangers, namely the recovery of
heat from process streams. Broad & Kauders (2019) described welded-plate exchangers.
An anonymous article (2011) presented two other high-efficiency devices: the fluted-plate block
heat exchanger and the spiral heat exchanger. LePree (2013), Moretta (2010), and Wajciechowski
(2011) also described spiral exchangers. Gunnarsson et al. (2009), Polley (2002), and Wadekar
(2000) presented compact heat exchangers, some of them cast as a unit and some welded together
in order to avoid leakage at gaskets which can happen with standard plate-and-frame units.
15.6 Modeling, Control, and Design Tools
Every chemical process benefitsfrom being accompanied by a mathematical model of its workings.
Models come in two forms:
● statistical, based on observations of behavior over a range of conditions, and
● fundamental, based on physical and chemical principles.15.7 Thermal Integration and Pinch Technology 273
The former type of model is useful on a day-to-day basis, especially if it incorporates a large
range of operating conditions. It generally becomes less trustworthy if conditions depart from its
data base.
The fundamental model, assuming the principles are correctly interpreted, is trustworthy over a
largerrange. Its precision improvesif checked againstranges of operating conditions, which allows
it to be “massaged”. Beck et al. (2014) and Casenave (2012) expounded on the benefits of rigorous
modeling. Models can be steady state: Bai et al. (2019), or they can be unsteady state: Perez &
Lenferink (2015).
Albers (1999) presented a model-based control scheme for a heat exchanger, the calculation
incorporating a fundamental dynamic (unsteady-state) mathematical model.
Commercial heat exchanger design software can be obtained from Aspentech and the HTRI con￾sortium. Either way, training is recommended.
15.7 Thermal Integration and Pinch Technology
Energy utilities, whether for heating or for cooling, are a significant cost factor in running a
plant, so there is a strong incentive to use the energy in a stream that needs to be cooled to
help raise the enthalpy in a stream that needs to be heated or vaporized. A plant that is thus
thermally integrated can save a lot of ongoing money. Unfortunately, the equipment to fully realize
this benefit constitutes a capital cost, so generally there is some optimum compromise in the
integration.
To achieve heat transfer between streams requires a temperature difference. In the following
discussions, this minimum approach of temperatures between hot and cold will be taken as 10 ∘C.
One of the first principles is that a design that keeps this difference of temperature as low as
possible (in this case 10∘) is a design that minimizes utility costs (while it increases capital costs
because of the need for more heat transfer area).
In Figure 15.14, the positioning of the exchanger in the left-hand configuration means that the
flows of both the cooling and heating medium can be less than for the coolant and heat in the
right-hand configuration – thus saving energy costs for these two utility streams.
The heat recovery around the above reactor is straight forward but the situation rapidly becomes
more complicated when more than two streams are considered. Be aware that the exchangers below
are assumed to all be countercurrent flow, which may not be practical in some situations. One of the
first treatments of multi-stream exchange is Linnhoff & Flower(1978). They provided a four-stream
example which we will explore (Table 15.2).

4 (hot) 4.0 150 40
There are a few variations on the original method, but the first step, as various authors agree on,
is to plot the streams as arrows on a temperature graph, as shown in Figure 15.15.
It is noticed that the scale for the heating steams is displaced upwards by 10∘ from the scale for
the cooling streams. The displacement results from the agreed-upon minimum difference of 10∘
between the streams in a heat exchanger. The graph provides guidance as to how the steams can
be matched up for exchange.
The graph is divided into five segments, in each of which particularstreams appear. The enthalpy
(kW) of each stream is noted within each segment. These enthalpies are calculated as flow × heat
capacity × temperature change. Starting at the top, the optimum design for each segment is to see
that each stream matches the above enthalpy at its bottom, whether by transfer of heat between
itself and anotherstream or by an externally provided infusion or a withdrawal of heat (Table 15.3).
The savings in coolant are 62% and in heating 81%. Linnhoff and Flower showed two possible
networks, one of which is shown in Figure 15.16.
It is likely that some shortcuts would be taken, with cuts in the number of utility exchangers and
increases in the input of the remaining exchangers. For instance, what would be the result if all
intermediate exchangers were eliminated, and only the final heating or cooling of the four streams
to meet their target temperatures were left in place? Most likely the system, interiorly, would reach
a “pinch point”, where temperatures between hot and cold streams become too low for effective
heat transfer. Simulations of Heat Exchanger Networks (HENs) detect such a situation.
By finding the pinch point, the minimum number of exchangers can be determined assuming
temperature crosses would not occur (which is not a valid assumption in all cases). The in situ
enthalpy content of each of the five zones is given Figure 15.15. The pinch temperature occurs at
the point where the enthalpy switches sign, that is between zone 3 and zone 4. The significance is
in the application of utilities: Only heat should be applied above the pinch point and only cooling
below. The theory behind this procedure is best explained in the Linnhoff papers.
The minimum number of exchangers is 6, and the energy consumed is predicted to be 60 kW of
heating and 145 kW of cooling (Figure 15.17). However, if such a network is created (Figure 15.18),
a temperature cross occurs cooling stream 4 with stream 1, which can be solved by decreasing the
heat that can be recovered. The result is an exchanger network that still requires only 6 exchanges,
and has 60 kW of heating, and 225 kW of cooling. It is advisable to review the assumption that
true countercurrent exchangers can be used in the application since this will impact the LMTD
correction factor and makes some designs infeasible. Three of the exchangers (H1, H3, and H5) in
this example would have low F factors if they were two-pass exchangers.Externally

Mixing and Agitation
In the production and processing of materials, it is very common to have to bring components
together into a mixture of some sort. The operation may be batch or continuous. We identify, and
will look at, six different combinations of components that may have to be mixed:
1. miscible liquids,
2. immiscible liquids,
3. gas and liquid,
4. solid particles in liquid,
5. solid particles with each other, and
6. solid particles and gas.
The process designer should follow these steps:
(1) specify the desired results of the mixing, including uniformity of the mixture both at the fine
scale and across the total mass being mixed,
(2) estimate or measure the properties of the components and of the final mixture,
(3) estimate the difficulty of mixing,
(4) choose and size the mixing device, and
(5) calculate the required power.
Mixing devices are and have been the subject of much development, all to the benefit of the
processes of which they are a part. For the first four of the above combinations, that is the ones
involving a liquid, and if the process materials are of low viscosity, then the common choice for a
device isthe turbine agitator.It is a ubiquitousitem that hasreceived much study, and it is discussed
at the start of Section 16.1, Blending of Miscible Liquids.
General references are textbooks and/or compilations by Nagata (1975), Uhl & Gray (1966, 1967,
1981), Harnby et al. (1985), Tatterson (1991), Hemrajani (1995), and Paul et al. (2003).
16.1 Mixing or Blending of Miscible Liquids
The requirement is to bring two or more liquids together and form a single phase. The mixture is
intended to be permanent, unlike other mixing situations where the phases are combined into a
mechanical mixture, which can subsequently separate or be separated.

There are two general cases:
1. the entering liquids are different from one another, and the resulting mixture is different from
any of the feeds:
2. the liquid is a single stream which may have fluctuations in its properties, and it is the intent of
the mixing to attenuate this variability (see Section 16.2.3).
For miscible liquids, the choices can be considered according to the following scheme in
Table 16.1.
16.1.1 Turbine Mixers
The mixer consists of a rotating shaft upon which is mounted one or more impellers which dis￾turb the liquid mixture. In a vessel, the shaft is generally, but not always, vertically and centrally
mounted. Impellers have various forms according to the effects they are intended to achieve, and
if the mixer has more than one impeller, the impellers need not necessarily be the same. Two of
the most common styles are shown in Figure 16.1, and the flow patterns which they generate are
shown in Figure 16.2.
Fasano (2015) showed many different styles of impellers, and D’Aquino (2004) showed some
novel types. Wyczalkowski (2004) showed an unusual case of counterflow impellers for a specific
task. Benz (2010) showed hydrofoil-shaped blades which are useful for slurries of fibrous solids.
The outerreaches of an impeller have a diameter, D, which isset assome fraction of tank diameter
T, this fraction being usually between 0.2 and 0.6. The rotational speed of the mixer is given by Ns.
Figure 16.1 Pitched-blade and straight-blade
turbine impellers.16.1 Mixing or Blending of Miscible Liquids 285
Figure 16.2 Flow patterns for pitched and straight impellers.
The definition of Reynolds number, an important parameter of the impeller, is
Re = 𝜌 Ns D2 𝜇−1 (16.1)
where 𝜌 and 𝜇 are liquid mixture density and viscosity, respectively. Another nondimensional
parameter is the pumping number (also called the flow number),
NQ = Q Ns−1 D−3 (16.2)
where Q is the vertical volumetric flow of fluid, up and down, caused by the impeller. The value of
this flow in a particular case will be seen to arise from the design procedure. NQ is related to Re, as
shown in Figure 16.3.
Finally, the power consumption, P, of the agitator is included in NP, the power number,
NP = P D−5 𝜌−1 Ns−3 (16.3)
This dimensionless number results from the hydrodynamic fact that power dissipation by an
impeller is proportional to (i) the fifth power of impeller diameter, (ii) the density of the mixture,
and (iii) the cube of the agitator rotational speed.
The power is that of a single impeller, so a multi-impeller shaft will add the powers together. For
multiple impellers, an effort should be made to optimize (equalize) the power consumptions – see
Benz (2012A).

Hicks et al. (1976) provided tabular data showing available agitator speeds and corresponding
agitator power for various viscosities, equivalent volumes (liquid volume × specific gravity), and
severity of agitation (SA).
All of these impellersrequire baffles along the wall, typically four equally spaced and ofstandard
width and position: baffle width typically 1/12 of the vessel diameter and allowing a gap of 1/72
of the vessel diameter between the baffle and wall to avoid stagnation. Without baffles, the liquid
simply swirls with little mixing. Myers et al. (2002) discussed baffles, and Pogal & Kehn (2018)
provided a very comprehensive treatment. Baffles and their design can play a significant role in
Table 16.2 Chemineer series on turbine mixing.

mixing and power consumption. There is obviously difficulty in baffling a glass-lined vessel, and
Dickey et al. (2004) illustrated how this is dealt with.
Benz (2004, 2012B) talked about the interplay between choices of impeller diameter as it affects
the speed and power. Dickey & Fasano (2004) espoused the use ofCFD forthe study of flow patterns,
including the identification of dead spots.
16.1.2 Chemineer Series on Turbine Mixing
In the mid-1970s, staff at Chemineer, Inc., published a 12-part series of articles in the Chemical
Engineering magazine, dealing with agitation of low viscosity liquids using turbine mixers. These
articles presented some very useful detailed design procedures which are still referenced after sev￾eral decades (Table 16.2). The set are still available in reprint form from the magazine. The design
procedures described in the first sections of this chapter are based largely on those articles.
16.2 Blending Calculation
If the viscosities of the components and mixture are moderate, then a turbine agitator is used, with
pitched-blade impellers. Drury & Gates (2001) presented a sequence of calculations to determine
vessel dimensions, impeller diameter, power requirement, and other quantities of interest. The
calculations presented here already assume the dimensions of the tank and the impeller and are
directed at determining the required speed and power.
Step 1: Decide on the SA on a scale of 1–10. This severity depends mainly on the disparities (i)
between feed liquid viscosities and/or (ii) between feed liquid densities, as shown in Table 16.3.
Choose SA to satisfy the more extreme of the two conditions.
Step 2: Note the required bulk fluid velocity, 𝛾B, corresponding to SA. This is a measure of the
vertical velocity, up and down, and indicates the rate with which the mixture must be turned over
by the agitator.

Step 3: Calculate effective pumping capacity, Q = 𝛾B ×A, where A is the cross-sectional area of
the tank.
(Calculations must be consistent with the units being used.)
Step 4: Select a trial impeller diameter, D, between 0.2 and 0.6 times the tank diameter.
Step 5:Initially assuming the motion to be turbulent (i.e. high Reynolds number),read the pump￾ing number, NQ, from the graph in Figure 16.3. This graph is a generic one, so if a more specific
relation is available, then it should be used.
Step 6: From Eq. (16.2), calculate agitatorspeed NS, and from Eq. (16.1), calculate Reynolds num￾ber Re.
Step 7: If the Reynolds number is less than 700, the indication is that a turbine agitator is becom￾ing unsuited forthis high-viscosity application. If using a turbine agitator, then obtain the diameter
correction factor, CF, from the graph in Figure 16.5 and calculate the corrected agitator diameter.
Repeat steps 4, 5, and 6.
Step 8: Choose the number, n, of agitator impeller elements to mount on the shaft, from
Table 16.4.
Step 9: Obtain the power number, NP, for each impeller.
Figure 16.4 shows the general trend of power numbers with Reynolds number. For the agitators
described in thissection, a power number of 1.6 is a good estimate. However, the designer willseek
more clarity on thisimportant coefficient because the estimation of power is directly proportionate
to NP.

With all quantities in SI units – D in meters, density in kg m−3, and NS in s−1 – the result is power

Pitched-blade impellers cause internal countercurrent liquid motion, producing zones of high
shear at the interface between upflow and downflow (see Figure 16.6). It is likely that most of the
intermolecular mixing takes place in this zone of high strain.
16.2.1 Wall-Wiping Impellers
For viscousliquids, a completely different type of agitator is used. In the absence of turbulence, it is
necessary to move the liquid directly instead of relying on momentum imparted just at the center
of the vessel. Two styles are shown below in Figure 16.7.
Bakker & Gates (1995) provided the following procedures for calculating the agitator power.
For helical-ribbon agitators, calculate the agitator Reynolds number in the usual manner.
If Re is less than or equal to 100, power number NP equals (350/Re) × f geo.
Figure 16.7 Helical-ribbon agitator and anchor agitator.290 16 Mixing and Agitation
If Re is greater than 100, NP equals
1.12 × Exp [6.15 − 1.37 ln(Re) + 0.0613 (ln(Re))2] × fgeo
where f geo equals
(D∕pitch)
1∕2 (height∕D) (width∕D∕0.1)
0.16 (D∕24∕(T − D))1∕2 (nf∕2)

with D being the outer diameter of the agitator,
pitch being the vertical distance for one full turn of the spiral,
height being the height of the agitator,
width being the width of the blade,
T being the diameter of the tank, and
nf being the number of flights for the helix.
For anchor agitators, if Re is less than or equal to 10, NP equals (400/Re) × f geo.
If Re lies between 10 and 10 000, NP equals
1.05 × Exp [5.64 − 0.783 ln(Re) − 0.0523 (ln(Re))2 + 0.00674 (ln(Re))3
] × fgeo
where f geo equals (height/D) (W/D/0.1)0.16 (D/49/(T–D))1/2.
We have experimented recently with a new design of mixer for viscous liquids, built from a cir￾cular rod or tubing in the form of a helix or spiral. Generally, we have used a double helix. The
outer diameter of the spiral may be as large as the tank diameter itself (minus a small clearance),
which helps keep the walls well wiped to prevent fouling and possibly enhance heat transfer. The
spiral arms are attached to a central drive shaft, which may enter the vessel from either the top or
bottom. The rod or tube diameter is chosen so that the force which it encounters does not cause
excessive deflection of the spiral. We have found it practical to design these agitators with no cross
bracing even at tank diameters up to 5 ft. The advantages are simplicity, low cost, elimination of
points of stagnation, and clear space within the spiral arms which allows for heating/cooling coils,
instrumentation, etc.

high-viscosity mixing.
16.2.2 Attenuation of Variation
The previous discussion concerned the blending of two somewhat different streams. A second
objective of blending can be to attenuate the fluctuations in properties of a single stream, simply
by providing a zone of full back-mixing.
Examining this second case, it can be shown mathematically that if an entering stream with a
regular fluctuation of frequency f in some property is blended in a fully mixed vessel of residence
time Φ, then the amplitude of the fluctuation is attenuated by the factor 1 √[1+(2π)2( f×Φ)2]
. For example,
see Table 16.5.
This calculation relies on the assumption of ideal “back-mixing”. If liquids bypass the main flow
or if there are zones of stagnation, then the attenuation will not be as great.
16.2.3 In-Line Mixers
In-line pipeline mixers are dedicated to the task of ensuring uniformity across the cross section of
the flow. Typically, they are used after two streams have been brought together. The mixer may
be dynamic, with a rotating element within the flow or it may be static or motionless, making
use of fixed deflectors to bring about interchange of streamlines. Some types of dynamic mixers16.3 Immiscible Liquids 291

are described in Perry & Green (1997). Static mixers add extra pressure drop to the line in which
they are located, so they are using the energy of the stream itself to bring about mixing. Several
varieties of static mixers are on the market.
Obviously, there would be a great advantage in eliminating the moving parts associated with a
mechanical agitator. Several companies have created designs ofstatic or motionless mixersthat can
be built into pipes to bring about radial homogenization. One of the simplest is the Kenics mixer
(Chemineer, Inc.), which is a sequence of successive elements consisting of metal strips 1.5 × pipe
ID long, each twisted through 180∘, with the twist of successive elements being in opposite direc￾tions. The start of each strip is at 90∘ to the end of the strip that it follows.
Static mixers are able to convert a highly nonuniform stream into a stream of any desired unifor￾mity if adequate length is provided. The effectiveness of various mixers is evaluated in terms of
(1) the length required to achieve a given reduction (e.g. 95%) of incoming nonuniformity and
(2) the pressure drop per unit length of mixer or, more specifically, the ratio of mixer pressure
gradient to the pressure gradient of a mixer-less pipe.
Godfrey (1985) compared the pressure drop and the effectiveness of various offerings. One can
choose between a device with high effectiveness and high-pressure gradient or a device with less
effectiveness per unit of length but lower-pressure gradient.
The two criteria can be multiplied into a single ratio, which is desired to be as low as possible.
There is a great range among commercial mixers, and there are some brands that we would stay
away from (See Table 16.6). Looking at the two Sulzer mixers, we might choose a long length of
the high-pressure-gradient SMX type if complete mixing were critical and adequate pressure were
available to us. In any case, the best mixers make the most effective use of pressure dissipation in
achieving uniformity. This is the indicator in the last column.

16.3 Immiscible Liquids
Immiscible liquids are brought together for one of the four reasons:
1. to extract a component out of one phase into the other phase,
2. to react components contained separately in different phases,

4. to create a permanent emulsion of one phase in another.
In cases 1, 2 and 3, the phases are subsequently separated from one another: Care may have
to be taken not to disperse so finely that a permanent emulsion results. In case 4, separation is
undesirable.
Turbine agitators are again suitable. For dispersing one liquid in another, the impeller blades are
in their straight form, as shown in Figure 16.1. The objective is to convert power of rotation into
comminution of droplets.
The drop size created by an agitator ofspecific size,shape, and speed depends on the properties of
the liquids. The coalescence ofsmall droplets may be taking place simultaneously,so agitation must
be carried on continuously while mass transfer and/or chemical reaction is taking place. In-line
mixers are not suitable for this application because the residence time in the mixer is too short.
If the objective is to create a permanent emulsion, then an in-line device is suitable. Several
designs of equipment are on the market, generally under the heading of homogenizers.
Figure 16.8 shows a continuous multistage agitated column forliquid–liquid extraction, where an
immiscible phase is alternately dispersed in a second phase to achieve mass transfer, then allowed
to settle out in order to flow separately to the next stage. Benz (2014) discussed such a column.

Permanent mixtures of immiscible liquids, with droplets of one liquid in the continuous phase of
the other liquid, constitute the class of emulsions. An analogoustype of mixture with solid particles
in a liquid is called a suspension. The creation of these substances is described in Section 16.2.3
16.4 Gas and Liquid
Gases are dispersed as bubbles in liquids and liquids are dispersed as sprays in gases, for such
purposes as cooling, mass transfer, and chemical reaction.
An adequate dispersion of gas in liquid may sometimes be attained simply by sparging
the gas into the liquid. If a finer dispersion is desired (e.g. to obtain greater interfacial sur￾face area), then a rotating agitator may be used (Figure 16.9). The same style of flat-bladed
turbine impeller is used as for dispersing immiscible liquids. A problem arises in that the
cloud of bubbles may overwhelm the action of the agitator and make it ineffective. Hicks &
Gates (1976) and also Deutsch & Van Essen (1998) provided predictive equations for this
effect and for how it may be overcome. The following calculation follows that of Hicks and
Gates.
Step 1: Assess the required SA from Table 16.7.
Step 2: Choose an agitator diameter, D. For this application, typically D is set at 0.15–0.5 times
tank diameter T.
Step 3: Calculate the superficial velocity of gas, US, equal to the volumetric flow of gas evaluated
at the point of entry, divided by the horizontal cross-sectional area of vessel.
Power for the impeller is the maximum of
● a rising function of the SA, regardless of the amount of gas, and
● a rising function of the amount of gas to be dispersed.
In Figure 16.10, the top line shows the first effect and the close-to-vertical lines of superficial
velocity show the second effect.
Step 4: Calculate parameter Y = SA × (D/T)

As opposed to the blending calculation of 16.1.2, where we set D and Ns and calculated power,
in the present calculation, we first determine the required power and then determine the speed to
give that power, thus steps 7–10.
Step 7: Make an estimate of the impeller rotationalspeed, NS, and then use Eq. (16.4) to calculate
the power (watts) that the agitator would require if operating at this speed in an un-gassed liquid,

Step 8: Calculate the aeration factor NA = QA/(NS D3),
where QA is the total volumetric flow rate of the gas.
Step 9: From Figure 16.11, determine a value of gassing factor GF based on NA.
Step 10: From Figure 16.11, obtain a “gassing factor” and apply the gassing factor to the power
calculated in Step 7. This accounts for the reduction, due to the interference of the gas, in power
transmitted to the fluid by the agitator,
P2 = GF × P2U
Step 11: Compare the value of P2 with P1. If they are not sufficiently close, then return to Step 7
and choose a new value of agitator speed. The objective is that the true rate of dissipation of energy
between the impeller and fluid is in fact P1.
Step 12: Choose the number of agitator impellers according to the following rule:
for Z/T less than or equal to 1.0, one impeller situated at a distance of T/6 from the floor of the
vessel,
for Z/T up to 1.8, two impellers, at T/6 and at (2/3) Z above the floor,
with Z and T being the height of liquid and the tank diameter, respectively.

The other type of gas–liquid mixing is the dispersion of a liquid into a gas, generally by means of
atomization. The main example isspray drying. Other applications are cooling of gases,scrubbing of
particulates, humidification, absorption of vapors, and chemical reaction. All of these phenomena
rely on a high ratio of surface-to-volume.

16.5 Solid Particles in Liquid
Some situations where solid particles need to be suspended in a liquid are
● heterogeneous catalysis,
● dissolution of solids, and
● preparation of a permanent slurry or emulsion.296 16 Mixing and Agitation
Assuming a turbulent liquid, the agitator of choice is a turbine with blades pitched to produce a
component of axial flow. The flow pattern is shown in Section 16.1.1. The speed and power of the
agitator are a function of
● the terminal velocity of the particles and
● the degree of suspension required.
Obviously, the greater the terminal velocity, the harder it is to keep the particles suspended. Par￾ticles that are small and/or similar in density to that of the liquid are easier to keep in suspension.
The degree of suspension refers to the uniformity of solids concentration in the vessel: Is it
enough just to sweep particles periodically off the bottom of the vessel or must there be unifor￾mity almost right to the top. If a slurry is being prepared, then the height to which uniformity must
extend is dictated by the point of slurry draw-off.
16.5.1 Suspension Calculations
Step 1: Once again, the calculation begins with selecting a SA. The following Table 16.8 gives the
criteria.
Step 2: Select impeller diameter, D, between 0.2 and 0.6 timesthe tank diameter, T, with 0.3 being
a commonly used ratio for this application.
Step 3: Determine the terminal settling velocity of a single solid particle, Ut.
Step 4: Correct the calculated terminal velocity to take account of interparticle interactions based
on the correction factor f w from Figure 16.12,
Step 5: Based on D/T and on the chosen value of SA, obtain the value of the parameter 𝜑 from
Figure 16.13.
Step 6: Calculate the required agitator speed as NS = (𝜑 Ud/D2.81)
1/3.75, where the units are
specifically
rpm for NS
ft min−1 for Ud
inches for D.
Step 7: Choose the number, n, of agitator elements (impellers) to mount on the shaft as follows:
for Z/T up to 1.2, one impeller situated Z/4 above the bottom of the tank;
for Z/T up to 1.8, two impellers situated T/4 and (2/3) Z above the bottom.

16.5.2 Problem Mixing and Extreme Mixing
Assumed in the above descriptions and calculations is that all liquids behave in the Newtonian
fashion, i.e., with strain and stress linear with each other starting at zero. A shear-thinning liquid
may create a zone of lesser disturbance in the vicinity of the agitator, which lessens the hoped-for
transfer of momentum from agitatorto process. Other varieties of fluid peculiarities can cause unex￾pected effects. Several authors addressed this problem, including Dickey (2000, 2015), Wilkens et al.
(2003), and Wyczalkowski (2004) with his counterflow impeller.
Turbine mixers and wall-wiping mixers are unable to generate and mix the fine droplets and
fine particles that make up emulsions and permanent suspensions. High-speed high-shear mixers
take on this task. This is a field of current development, with articles including Myers et al. (1993),
Shelley (2004, 2007), Cohen (2005), Dickey (2015), and Banaszek (2016, 2018).
16.6 Solid Particles with Solid Particles
Probably, most cases of particle mixing have the objective of removing or blending out nonunifor￾mities. The operation may be batch or continuous. Particle blenders come in different styles.
The tumbling blender (Figure 16.14) rotates, causing particles to tumbling over one another,
hopefully in a random manner.
Convective blenders are stationary and have an internal rotating system of paddles or a screw to
impart motion to the particles. Fluidized beds use a gas to move particles relative to one another.
A recirculating vessel with multiple staggered downcomers can rearrange particles (Figure 16.15).
Some considerations in particle mixing:
1. extra effort is required to mix particles that have a tendency to agglomerate,
2. tumble mixing typically takes 10–15 minutes,
3. a fluidized bed gives the fastest mixing,
4. particles of different size or density have a tendency to settle relative to one another. The mixer
must overcome this action, and
5. the speed of mixing needsto be restrained if particles are fragile. Also,rapid mechanical agitation
may raise the temperature.

16.7 Solid Particles and Gas
Some reasons why a solid may be mixed with a gas are
● to be conveyed,
● to be reacted,
● to be dried or otherwise treated, and
● to catalyze a reaction.
Conveying (e.g. by air)is carried out in one of two modes: dilute phase or dense phase. Asindicated
by the nomenclature, the ratio of solids to gas is quite different in the two modes. In the dilute
phase, the particles are mixed into the gas stream simply by being dropped in; a rotary feed valve is
needed if the gas system is under pressure. In the dense phase, the solids are assembled and then
gas is introduced to start moving them.
If the objective is mass transfer or chemical reaction, then intimate mixing can be done in a flu￾idized bed. The bed is designed in accordance with well-established fluidization technology. High
rates of surface transfer are achieved relative to say a packed or slowly moving bed (Figure 16.16).

beds.

Mechanical Separations
Mechanical separations comprise the operations in which different phases are parted from one
another. There are five general situations, namely where the phases are
1. liquid and liquid (immiscible or only slightly miscible in each other),
2. solid and solid,
3. gas and liquid,
4. gas and solid, and
5. liquid and solid.
By contrast with molecular separations, which are discussed in the Chapter 18, mechanical sep￾arations are distinguished by the absence of component transfer between phases.
The need for a mechanical separation may arise in dealing with mixtures of phases found in
natural raw materials or in purifying process materials where extraneous phases have infiltrated.
A mechanicalseparation also may be the finalstep in a molecularseparation: Two phases may have
been brought into intimate contact in order to promote component molecular transfer between the
phases; afterward the phases have to be separated. In another situation, a fluid (e.g. air) may have
been used to convey solid pellets and must then, at the end of the travel, be separated from both
the pellets and from any fines that were generated. A mechanical and a molecular separation may
be used in sequence: In a familiar domestic operation such as drying a load of washing, the clothes
are first wrung or spun to remove the bulk of the rinse water (a mechanical operation) and then
hung or tumbled to diffuse out the rest of the water – a molecular operation.
An excellentreference for many of the operations discussed in thissection isVolume 1,Chapter 4,
“Mechanical Separations” in Ludwig (1999) (Figure 17.1, Table 17.1).
17.1 Liquid–Liquid Separations
There are many situations where a process ends up with a mixture of two (or more) liquid phases.
The liquids may both be organics, or, very often, one is organic and the other is largely water. Some
situations are as follows:
● liquid–liquid extraction,
● a chemical reaction that generates an immiscible product or by-product (e.g. water),
● a feed stream containing water,

17.1.1 Decantation or Settling
If the density difference is sufficient, the simplest method is to use gravity to pull the phases apart.
The device or vessel is called a decanter if it operates partially full and a settler if it operates full.
If operating continuously, the mixture enters at one end and soon separates into a light top layer
and a heavy bottom layer. Part of the light phase remains in dispersed form in the bottom layer,
and part of the heavy phase remains in dispersed form in the top layer. Typically, a droplet size
of 150 μm (a micron being 1/1000th of a millimeter) is used for calculation purposes. In the rest
of the operation, the droplets rise or fall to join their appropriate phase and the vessel is sized to
allow this to happen. Sigales recommended that, regardless of the calculated value of droplet fall
or rise velocity, the velocity should never be assumed to be greater than 10 inches per minute.
Ludwig (1999) quoted one hour as a typical time for separation. Provision is made at the end of the
vessel to draw off the two phases. This is done in a controlled manner to regulate the level of the
interface between phases and, in the case of a decanter, to regulate the overall height in the vessel
(Figure 17.2).
References are Schultz (2005) and Sigales (1975).
17.1.2 Coalescence
To coalesce is to bring together and unite. In the present case, the coalescence is of small liquid
droplets dispersed in anotherliquid. Typically, the droplets are in the size range of 0.1–50 μm, which
is too small to separate under the influence of gravity. (This is because the terminal velocity of
small droplets varies as the square of diameter.) In coalescence, the two-phase mixture is passed
through a bed of fibers or particles onto which the dispersed liquid attaches (possibly adsorbs)
and builds up into larger droplets (e.g. 500–5000 μm), which can then be separated by gravity.
The effectiveness of coalescence in liquid–liquid separation requiressome degree of interfacial ten￾sion (IFT) between the two liquids. The lower limit is about 20 dynes cm−1 when glass fibers are
used. More recently, polymeric fibers, sometimes with a surface coating, have allowed coalescence
down to IFT of 0.5 dynes cm−1.

Katrona et al. (2001), and Wines (2011).
17.1.3 Centrifugation
Centrifugation makes use of rotation to create large centrifugal forces, hundreds or thousands of
times greater than gravity. Droplets that move very slowly under gravity can be significantly accel￾erated in a centrifuge. The subject of centrifugation is discussed in more detail in Section 17.5.1 on
liquid–solid separation. For liquid–liquid separation, a tubular bowl type of centrifuge is generally
used. The tube rotates about a vertical axis and achieves forces typically up to 62 000 times that
of gravity in laboratory centrifuges and 16 000 in industrial units. The liquid mixture enters at the
bottom of the tube and leaves in two phases through concentric outlets at the top.

A reference for liquid–liquid centrifugation is Hertle (2012). See Section 17.5.1 for further refer￾ences on centrifugation (Figure 17.3).
17.2 Solid–Solid Separations
Solid particles or pellets of different types often occur as mixtures. The difference in type may be
simply size, or it may be the chemical nature of the particles. Some separation situations are as
follows:
● remove oversized particles that would ruin a surface finish or cause an electronic product to fail,
● remove fine particlesthat would cause a dusting problem orthat would getrubbed off in a molded
or coated object,
● sort out and recycle oversized particles in a comminution operation,
● prepare feed for a mass-transfer operation or a chemical reaction, where small size processes
faster, and
● remove “tramp” metal from a solid product.
Some separation mechanisms depend on the differential behaviorin a separation system for gases
and solids or liquids and solids, examples being centrifugation, cyclone flow, hydroclone flow, differ￾entialsettling, and flotation. These operations are discussed subsequently.Itshould be noted that, in
these cases, the behavior of the solid particles may depend on a combination of their size, shape,
and density, so the separation with respect to the characteristic of interest may not be as distinct as
desired.
Three methods specific to solid–solid separation are screening, air classification, and separation
by magnetic or electrostatic forces and are discussed in this section.
Two terms that describe the nature and effectiveness of a size-separation operation are cut size
and size selectivity. Cut size is the size (diameter) of particle such that 50% is sorted into the “large”
category and 50% into the “small” category. Size selectivity is the relation (usually given graphi￾cally) between the particle diameter and percent retained as “large”. In an idealseparation, 100% of17.2 Solid–Solid Separations 307

particles bigger than the cut size are retained as “large” and zero percent of particles less than the
cut size are so retained. In practice, the selectivity curve is more or less “S-shaped” (Figure 17.4).
In designing or analyzing a solid–solid size-separation system, it is necessary to measure the size
and size distribution of the particles. Snow & Allen (1992) listed five techniques:
● screening with standard wire-mesh sieves, applicable to particles down to 200 μm and, with spe￾cial electroformed sieves, down to 5 μm,
● microscopy, applicable down to 1 μm,
● low-angle laser light scattering (diffraction) for particles from 0.05 to 1000 μm,
● electrical sensing and counting, applicable down to 0.7 μm, and
● BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) nitrogen gas adsorption to measure the surface area.
References on solid mixtures and separations are Snow & Allen (1992) and Mayo et al. (2014).
17.2.1 Screening
In continuous processing, a feed stream of particles is continuously deposited onto a horizontal
or nearly horizontal screen and conveyed across the surface of the screen by vibratory or gyratory
motion of the screen system. The objective may be to “scalp” the oversized particles, in which case
everything else passes through the screen, or the objective may be to remove “fines”, in which
case only the fines pass through the screen, or the objective may be to remove both oversized and
undersized particlesin which case two screens are used. It may even be desired to divide the pellets
into several size “cuts”, thus requiring multiple screens.
The effectiveness with which the size divisions are made is dictated by the speed of passage of the
pellets over the screen, by the type and vigor of the vibratory or gyratory motion, by the flowability
of the particles, by their shape, and by their density. Screening relies on gravity to pull the particles
through the screen apertures, so denser particles are easier to screen. Gyratory motion is more
effective in spreading particles across the screen surface. The capacity of a screen system is quoted
in pounds per hour of feed per unit area of screen, but the actual capacity depends on the type
of particles and on what constitutes an adequate degree of separation: how much off-specification
material can be left in the product and, conversely, how much wastage of product is acceptable.
Blockage of screen openings reduces system capacity; it can be addressed and minimized if it is
a problem for the material at hand.308 17 Mechanical Separations

Screening is effective down to about 30–100 μm, which isinadequate forsome of today’s products
that incorporate superfine particles (Figure 17.5).
References on screening are DeCenso (2000), Paulsen (2004), Lower (2006), and Dhodapkar
et al. (2007).
17.2.2 Elutriation and Air Classification
A particle immersed in a stationary or moving fluid but with a velocity different from the fluid is
acted upon by a drag force which tendsto make the particle take the same velocity asthe fluid. If an
external force (e.g. gravitational or centrifugal) acts on the particle, then the particle adopts a speed
and/or direction different from the fluid. The extent to which this happens depends on the relative
magnitudes of drag force and the external force. In general, the greater the size (and the greater the
density) of the particle, the greater the deviation. This principle is used in centrifugation, cyclone
separation, and settling, as well as in elutriation and air classification.
Elutriation itself is a crude separation tool, depending on only gravity asthe external force. If par￾ticles are introduced into an upward-moving stream of gas, the lighter ones are carried with the gas
and the heavier ones fall through the gas. The selectivity of this separation is poor, but elutriation
may be a good pre-separation step. Some commercial elutriators are in the form of a zigzag channel.
Air classification uses the rotational motion of air to create centrifugal force. The rotation may
come from tangentially introduced air, as in a cyclone, but the more effective and high-throughput
classifiers use a mechanicalrotor.Cyclones are effective down to particle size around 45 μm; they do
not give good “sharpness of cut”. Mechanically driven classifiers, incorporating also an elutriation
section, operate in the range 5–250 μm. Special high-energy dispersion classifiers operate in the
range 1–50 μm.
Classifiers are often used in combination with comminution and sometimes with the online laser
measurement of particle average size.
Sharpness of cut is defined on the basis of the size-selectivity curve. The particle diameter, D75, is
noted at which 75 weight % is classified as “large”, and the particle diameter, D25, is noted at which
25% is classified as “large”,
Sharpness of cut = D25∕D75
Values can range from extremes of 0.0 (no separation) to 1.0 (perfect separation). Typical values
are 0.3–0.7 but can reach 0.9 for low loading.17.3 Gas–Liquid Separations 309

17.2.3 Magnetic Separation, Electrostatic Precipitation
If particles of different composition are to be separated, then other properties besides size may
be put to use. Differences in density or shape (or size) may be invoked. Magnetic susceptibility is
another possibility. Certainly, if one component is a ferromagnetic, such as iron, cobalt, or nickel,
then because of its very high susceptibility, it is relatively easy to pull free from a mixture of par￾ticles. Many other materials – other elements and compounds – are paramagnetics and have the
ability (susceptibility) to be temporarily magnetized in a magnetic field. If the types of particles in
a mixture have different susceptibilities, then they may be separable by magnetic means. Tables of
susceptibility are available. Some substances are diamagnetic and are repelled by magnetic fields.
The equipment whereby separation is carried out is equipped first to attract the susceptible par￾ticles and then to deposit them in a different location from the non-attracted (or lesser) particles.
A magnetic drum is one such device.
Particles of different composition may sometimes be separated by electrical forces. A charge is
induced in the particles by means of contact, conduction or ionic bombardment. Depending on
the nature of the material, individual particles pick up more or less charge and are attracted
more or less to an electrode of opposite charge. The method becomes ineffective for particles
greater than about 4 mm diameter because gravitational forces (proportional to the cube of
diameter) become much greater than the electrical forces which are proportional to diameter
squared.
17.3 Gas–Liquid Separations
Two general situations are liquid-dispersed-in-gas and gas-dispersed-in-liquid. The first situation
arises, for instance, when310 17 Mechanical Separations
● vapor from a boiling or sparged pool of liquid carries (entrains) liquid droplets,
● vapor emerges from a flashing two-phase flow, and
● a gas–vapor mixture is cooled.
The second situation may arise when
● gas passes through, or vapor is generated within, a liquid and is particularly pronounced if the
liquid is viscous, and
● a liquid is agitated vigorously.
In general, these gas–liquid mixtures are undesired and require separation.
The liquid-in-gas situation is examined first. The method of separation depends on the size of
the liquid droplets and also on the loading in the gas. We examine the methods starting with the
largest droplets and the highest loadings.
17.3.1 Gravity Settling
Two-phase mixtures emerging from gas–liquid pipelines often have large liquid loadings and gross
dispersion of liquid in the gas. A typical liquid concentration is 50 l m−3 of gas. A simple “knock￾out” pot can do the initial separation of gas and liquid and should be installed ahead of any more
sophisticated device. Gas leaves at the top and liquid leaves at the bottom, both streams probably
containing some amount of the other phase.
A reference is Majeed (2019).
17.3.2 Cyclone Flow
For liquid content in the range 1–50 l m−3 a cyclone is effective in separating liquid from gas, espe￾cially if the liquid droplets are largerthan 10–50 μm. However,smaller droplets are carried out with
the gas stream.
17.3.3 Inertial Precipitation: Demisting and Scrubbing
For droplets greater than 5–50 μm, passage of the gas–liquid through a wire-mesh pad can remove
most of the liquid. The gas passes around the wire elements but the liquid, having more inertia,
collides with the wire and collects (precipitates) on it. The liquid runs together (i.e. coalesces) and
forms droplets that are large enough to detach and fall back against the main flow. The cut size of
the droplets removed (i.e. the diameter of droplet such that 50% are removed from the gas) may be
estimated from the formula
Cut size = 2.302 × 106 ×
[
(gas viscosity × wire diameter)
(liquid density × gas velocity)
]1∕2
It is common to install a mesh pad at the top of a knockout pot to remove some of the liquid that
still remains in the gas.
Another variety of inertial precipitation is the scrubber where the droplets which it is desired to
remove collide with larger drops of liquid sprayed into the path of the gas. These drops are large
enough to settle by gravity. This type of system is used for droplets 20 μm or less. There are several
styles ofscrubbers,some of them very thorough. Of course, the introduction of the additional liquid
must be compatible with the process materials.
A reference is “Anonymous” (2005).17.3 Gas–Liquid Separations 311
17.3.4 Electrostatic Precipitation
Droplets as small as 2 μm may be removed from a stream of gas by being given a charge through
(ionization of the gas) and then being collected on an electrode. The method works better at larger
sizes, e.g., above 50 μm.
17.3.5 Coalescence
When the droplet size is very small, say less than a μm, the inertial techniques become ineffective.
Mists and fogs comprise droplets in this size range. Small particles follow the motion of the gas
so closely that there is little chance for capture by impingement. In this case, the phenomenon of
choice is coalescence. The gas–liquid mixture is passed through a bed of fine fibers onto which the
liquid droplets adhere in passing and on which they grow to a size that lets them separate after
the gas–liquid mixture leaves the coalescer. The bed is typically a hollow cylinder, either vertical or
horizontal. Gas and liquid enter at one end and emerge from the outside of the cylinder all along
its length. The fibers are sized to enhance the growth of droplets. They may have a non-wetting
fluoropolymer coating which preservesthe captured droplets as droplets and enhancestheir ability
to unite with one another.
See Section 17.1.2 for references (Figure 17.7).
17.3.6 Foam-Breaking
The other type of gas–liquid mixture sometimes requiring separation is the mixture where the liq￾uid forms the continuous phase, i.e., froths and foams. Sometimes it is essential to separate the
liquid components from the gas components. Often, however, the problem is just that the foam
takes up space in a reactor or in the stages of a distillation column. In the extreme, foam may start
issuing from the vessel where gas was expected. There are three situations:
1. A liquid is boiling or gas is being passed through it. Even though the gas separates from the
liquid by leaving the top surface, it still occupies space within the bubbly mixture. The in situ
liquid volumetric fraction in the mixture is generally described by an expression of form
Vol frac liquid = 1∕(1 + a × US)
where US is the superficial velocity of the gas (volumetric flow divided by cross-sectional area)
and a is a constant, the value of which depends on the system and particularly on liquid viscosity.
Figure 17.7 Coalescer.
Gas and liquid,
in
Gas, out
Coalesced
liquid312 17 Mechanical Separations
This behavior is simply a fact of life: The expansion of the liquid into a bubbly mixture has to be
taken into account when designing or filling a vessel.
2. A gas has been introduced into the liquid during part of a process, but that part is over.
While most of the bubbles have risen and disappeared, a population of small slowly rising
bubbles remains. This situation occurs most commonly with viscous liquids. The rise velocity
is proportional to bubble diameter squared and inversely to liquid viscosity. If the gas must be
removed and if it is not practical to wait long enough, then a vacuum may be applied in order
to increase the size of the bubbles or the liquid may be heated to reduce its viscosity.
3. A true foam is present, i.e., a layer of stable bubbles at the top of the liquid pool. Generally, a
third, trace component is responsible for the stability of the bubbles. Mechanical means, like
rotating bars or paddles, are sometimes used to stir and break the bubbles. More commonly
a chemical, generally at low concentration (a few parts per million), is added as an antifoam.
The nature and operative mechanism of these substances vary, but it is thought that they may
substitute their activity for that of the component causing the foam. In any case, they cause
the liquid membrane between the bubbles to rupture or to thin and drain back into the pool,
thus allowing the gas in the bubbles to escape. Silicones are a popular antifoam, as are several
different organic compounds and a few inorganics. Antifoams are chosen for their effectiveness
in the system at hand and also for the lack of any adverse effects on the process or product. For
instance, some antifoams are unacceptable in food or in packaging materials that will come in
contact with food.
These topics are discussed in the Chemical Engineers’ Handbook: Perry & Green (1997A).
17.4 Gas–Solid Separations
Three possible reasons why gas stream bearing particulates may require separation are as follows:
● the particulates have value,
● the equipment into which the gas is subsequently entering would be damaged by particulates
(e.g. a compressor), and
● the gas is being released to atmosphere and must be clean.
A common situation is in pneumatic conveying of pellets, where not only must the pellets be
separated from the gas stream but so must any fines that were generated by attrition.
Phillips provided a survey of methods for removing particulates (both solid and liquid) from
gases. The following methods are discussed here:
● gravity settling,
● cyclone flow,
● scrubbing,
● filtration, and
● electrostatic precipitation.
General references on gas–solid separations are Phillips (2000), Agarwal (2005), and Jenkins
(2020).17.4 Gas–Solid Separations 313
17.4.1 Gravity Settling
If particulates are large enough, then they may be removable by providing a zone of low gas velocity
and low drag force so that gravity can do its work. The terminal or fall velocity U of small parti￾cles of diameter Dp can be calculated by equating the force of gravity to the resistive force of the
“stationary” gas:
(π∕6) D3 (𝜌p − 𝜌g) gc = 3 π 𝜇g Dp U
where 𝜌p is the particle density, 𝜌g is the gas density, 𝜇g is the gas viscosity, and gc is the conversion
9.8 newton per kilogram force. To achieve separation in any reasonable time (a few seconds), the
particles have to have diameters in the millimeter range. If the range of particle sizes extends up
this high, then settling is a good first stage in the separation sequence.
17.4.2 Cyclone Flow
Cyclones are one of the oldest methods of particulate separation. As mentioned in Section 17.2.2,
the size selectivity is mediocre (generally making cyclones inadequate for sorting particles by size)
and this fact must be kept in mind in when designing for separation of particles from gases. Typi￾cally, for cyclones, the sharpness of cut as defined in Section 17.2.2 is 0.2.
Zenz provides the method and equations required for designing a cyclone to remove particles
down to a required size. The overall efficiency (percent of entering particles removed) of a given
cyclone depends on the entering size distribution. Cyclones are not effective at sizes below about
5 μm.In some devices on the market, the centrifugal action of a cyclone isreplaced by mechanically
driven rotation and this allows particles as small as 1 μm to be separated.
References are Zenz (2001), Louis(2005), Dhodapkar & Heumann (2011), Muschelknautz (2019),
and Sakthivel & Pitchumani (2019).
17.4.3 Scrubbing
Scrubbing with a liquid can knockout particles in the range 0.1–100 μm. The simple spray tower
scrubber is not the most efficient design, with poor efficiency especially at particle sizes below
10 μm. More modern designs incorporate cyclone action, packed and fluidized beds, trayed
columns, orifice, and venturi flow. In most of these cases, the gas flow is channeled down at
selected locations to achieve high velocity so that its energy can be used to atomize the scrubbing
liquid and present large liquid surface area for particle capture. These scrubbers have higher
pressure drop than simple spray devices (Figure 17.8).
References on scrubbing are Jenkins (2012B), Resetarits (2013), and MacLeod (2018).
17.4.4 Filtration
The most common type of particulate filter used industrially is made of fabric, through which
the gas passes and on the surface of which the particles collect. In fact, the cake which forms
is the prime filter medium. These filters are sized for gas velocity of 0.3–2.5 m min−1 and pres￾sure drop of 0.5–1.5 kPa (2–6 inches of water). Fabric filters are very efficient (greater than 99%,314 17 Mechanical Separations
Figure 17.8 Scrubber for solid particles in gas.
approaching 100%) even for particles of submicron size. As the cake of collected particles builds
up, the pressure drop increases, so provision is made to periodically remove the cake by shaking or
pulsing the fabric or by reversing the flow. This type of filter is limited in the temperature it can tol￾erate, but new synthetic fibers have raised the limit. A knockout step to remove large hot particles
is sometimes provided upstream.
Another approach is to pass the gas-particle mixture through a granular bed. This type of fil￾ter can operate at higher temperature. An efficiency of 99.9% can be achieved. As the granules
become coated with particles, the bed requires regeneration or replacement. In some case, the bed
is moving: Granules are continuously withdrawn, cleaned, and recycled.
For low loading of particulates, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters provide high effi￾ciency down to very small sizes of particles (less than 0.1 μm). The medium is a paper comprising
very fine fibers (less than a micron diameter) in a matrix of larger fibers.
A reference on gas filtration is Muller (2017).
17.4.5 Electrostatic Precipitation
Electrical charge can be induced on particles, allowing them to be collected on an oppositely
charged surface. The advantages, relative to other separators, are low pressure drop and tolerance
of high temperature and pressure. The disadvantage is cost.
References are Grainger & Paulson (2003) and Louis (2006).
17.5 Liquid–Solid Separations
Some of the situations in which a liquid and solid particles are mixed with each other are as follows:
● naturally occurring streams of water bearing silt,
● liquid-phase reaction mixtures containing a catalyst in pellet form,
● mother liquor and crystallized material, and
● waste streams containing sludge or other environmental contaminants.17.5 Liquid–Solid Separations 315
The most often used separation techniques are centrifugation and filtration. They along with
some lesser methods are discussed here.
General references on liquid–solid separations are Butcher (2005), Engel (2015), and Perry &
Green (1997C).
17.5.1 Sedimentation Centrifugation
As explained previously, centrifugation is an extension of the technique of settling, where the force
of gravity is replaced by a much greater centrifugal force. The smallest and simplest centrifuge is
that found in the chemistry laboratory, where a circular rack of test tubes is whirled at high speed
generally to drive a dispersed precipitate to the bottom of the tube.
In Section 17.1.3, the tubular (sometimes called tubular bowl) centrifuge was mentioned as a
device for separating immiscible liquids. This device is also used for liquid–solid mixtures. This is
a more common usage of centrifuges in general and, when so designed and used, they are called
sedimentation centrifuges. There are several styles.
The solid-bowl basket (orsolid-bowl batch) centrifuge issimilarto the tubular but isless elongated
and is used at larger scales and can tolerate larger solid particles. Like the tubular, it is a batch
unit, requiring periodic shutdown to remove the solids that are deposited at the wall. Liquid is
continuously discharged. Both centrifuges rotate about a vertical axis.
The multichamber (or chamber bowl) centrifuge is also a batch vessel rotating about a vertical
axis.Internally, it is fitted with concentric vertical partitionssuch that the slurry hasto up and down
successive annuli. The effect is to produce more surface area for solids to settle on (Figure 17.9).
A family of disk (or disk stack) centrifuges are also fitted with internal partitions but inclined at
an angle to the vertical. Slurry isinitially directed to the outside of the rotating shell and then hasto
make its way back across the partitions to reach a central exit. Again the objective is to have more
area for solids settling. There are three main styles of disk centrifuges:
● The solid retaining (or manual discharge) disk centrifuge is a batch device in that it must be shut
down periodically and cleared of solids.

● The intermittent discharge (or solid ejecting) disk centrifuge allows solids to be expelled automat￾ically from time to time and is thus a continuous operation.
● The nozzle discharging disk centrifuge is provided with continuous discharge of solids and is
operated continuously. In all of the units, liquid is discharged continuously (Figure 17.10).
The large continuous versatile workhorse of industry is the scroll decanter (or solid-bowl
decanter). Some units rotate about a vertical axis, some about a horizontal axis. The rotating
cylinder or bowl is fitted with an internal wall-wiping helical screw which rotates at a slightly
different speed. The screw continuously pushes solids to a discharge port as the solids appear on
the wall (Figure 17.11).
A hybrid variation on this design is the screen-bowl decanter (or screen-bowl centrifuge) in which
the screw pushes the solids across a cylindrical screen before discharge, allowing the solid to rid
itself of free liquid. Along this theme, there are filters which use centrifugal action as the motive
force to achieve high rates of filtration.
The references provide comparisons of the operational details and the applicability of the various
centrifuge designs.

17.5.2 Filtration
Filtration is the separation of solids from a fluid by passage of the fluid through a medium that
restrains all or part of the solids. Filtration from gases has already been described in Section 17.4.4.
Here, the fluid is liquid.
Figure 17.11 Scroll decanter or solid-bowl decanter.17.5 Liquid–Solid Separations 317
Filtration tends to be used when the solid content in the liquid–solid slurry is relatively low.
In most cases, the liquid is the product of value and the removal of solids is done to improve the
value and processability of the liquid.
The filtration medium may be any one (or a combination) of woven screens or fabric, or non￾woven fabric or paper, or a porous membrane. The configuration may locate the medium in a
plate-and-frame apparatus, on horizontal plates, as circular or flat cartridges, as a belt, as a rotary
drum, or as the wall of a centrifuge. Granular beds are also sometimes used for filtration.
There are three basic types of filtration:
1. Cake filtration: The solids build up on the surface of the filter medium and form a cake ofsteadily
increasing thickness. This cake actually becomes the filter. A filter aid (e.g. diatomaceous earth)
may be added to enhance the filtration. However, it must be removed from time to time as the
pressure drop becomes excessive.
2. Depth filtration: The solid particles enter into the filter medium and are trapped between fibers.
Gradually, the medium becomes plugged or beginsto passsolids out with the filtrate (the leaving
liquid), so the filter requires periodic cleaning or replacement.
3. Cross-flow membrane filtration: This more recently developed type of filtration is designed to
separate out very small particles. Instead of flowing though the filter medium (in this case a
porous membrane), the liquid–solid mixture moves across it. Some material passes through the
membrane, but the surface of the membrane is kept free of solid accumulation. There are four
degrees of membrane filtration, as listed by Duffy (2003) in Table 17.2.
The subject of filtration has drawn a great deal ofstudy, and so there are many referencesto assist
the designer. The following list may be helpful:

2013, 2014), Berg (2011), Sentmanat (2011), Anonymous (2013), Perlmutter (2014), and Gabelman
(2015, 2017).
17.5.3 Settling
If the difference in densities of liquid and solid is great enough, then an adequate separation may
be achieved simply by letting the particles settle to the bottom of a vessel. The operation may be
batch or continuous. If the objective is to produce a clear liquid (e.g. water), then the settler is
called a clarifier. If the objective is to recover a valuable solid product, then the settler is called a
thickener. In any case, the behavior of the descending solid phase is complicated by the interaction
of particles with one another. One cannot simply extrapolate from the behavior of single particles.
In continuous operation, there will always be a gradient of solid concentration from top to bottom
of the vessel.

Micro 0.5–3 0.05–5 μm

Nano 6–20 100–300 mol wt
Reverse osmosis 10–60 Allows only water to pass318 17 Mechanical Separations
17.5.4 Flotation
In settling, the more common case and the case usually considered are that of particles heavier
than the liquid. Solids settle to the bottom. In the event that the solid material is less dense, then
the particles float to the top where they may be skimmed off. However, even denser particles can
be made to float if bubbles attach to them. This is the principle of flotation. It is used in the metal￾lurgical industry where ore particles are considerably heavier than water, but it is still convenient
to remove them from the top rather than the bottom. In waste water treatment, flotation is used to
remove fats, greases, and oily material, which would actually float on its own but only very slowly.
Bubbles form agglomerates between small globules and help them rise because they get bigger and
because they get lighter with the air attached. The process works best when the air bubbles are
small, around 2 mm in diameter. Flotation is also used in the recovery of oil from oil sands.
References on flotation are Belhateche (1995), Zinkus et al. (1998), and Hairston (2002).
17.5.5 Flocculation
In settling, where the terminal velocity varies as the square of particle diameter, and in any process
where fluid drag forces are involved, it is advantageous to have bigger particles.
A flocculating agent acts to bring small particles together into larger faster-settling entities.
Hughes (1977) listed a number of flocculants, all of them organic, most of them polymeric, some
nonionic, and some containing acidic or basic functional groups. To be economically practical, a
flocculating agent must be effective in low concentrations. They are used in settling and also in
decanting centrifuges.
References are Hughes(1977) and Perry & Green (1997B) in Chemical Engineers’ Handbook, Sev￾enth Edition, Chapter 18, p. 63.
17.5.6 Hydroclone Flow
The hydroclone (or hydrocyclone or hydraulic cyclone) isthe liquid-phase analogue of the gas-phase
cyclone. It is used to separate particles continuously from liquid where the particles are more dense
than the liquid. Like a cyclone, it has a tangential feed and a swirling motion which drives the par￾ticles toward the wall. The initial part of the wall is cylindrical, and the later part narrows down in
a conical fashion. Large particles leave along with some of the liquid through a central outlet at the
narrow end of the cone. This is the underflow. Small particles and most of the liquid leave through
a central pipe at the other end, the overflow. The design of a hydroclone starts with the specification
of the desired cut size D50, already defined as that particle diameter for which 50% of those particles
leave in the underflow. Gomez (1992) provided an equation for the required diameter of the hydro￾clone. He provided further equations for liquid capacity and pressure drop. Although hydroclones
are usually shown with their axis vertical, this orientation is not mandatory because gravity plays
little part in the operation.
Gomez stated the following relationship for the efficiency of separation of particles of diameter
D other than the cut size:
Percent leaving with the underflow = E = 100 ×
[
1 − e−((D∕D50)−0.115)
∧3
]
Based on this expression, the sharpness of cut (defined in Section 17.2.2) is calculated as 0.63,
which is quite good.
Hydroclones have the advantages of no moving parts and continuous operation. However, the
internal motion is vigorous and may damage some materials.References 319

17.5.7 Expression and Wicking
If the liquid–solid mixture is largely solid and if the liquid is loosely held, then it may be possible to
squeeze out or express a significant part of the liquid. Wringing a cloth and squeezing an orange are
domestic examples, and in fact, expression is used commercially in the making of juices. Expres￾sion may be used to get rid of the bulk of the liquid before a more intense step to reach the final
desired level.
In papermaking, press-felts are brought into contact with the formed sheet to wick away some
of the residual water left after the initial formation of the sheet. This step precedes the final drying
over steam-heated rolls. Blotting paper is another example of a wicking material.
These unit operations are discussed in Perry & Green (1997D).
17.5.8 Spray Drying
In Chapter 18, Molecular Separations, the technique of spray drying is presented as a way of split￾ting a dissolved solution into its component parts – the solvent as a liquid and the solute in its solid
state. In the present instance, the liquid and solid are in a mechanical mixture and the objective is
to split them. The combination of heat and finely divided matter make for high rates.

Molecular Separations
Molecularseparations consist of the transfer of components, molecule by molecule, from one phase
to another. They are sometimes used in sequence with one another or in sequence with mechan￾ical separations. An example is the manufacture of paper, where the stock slurry is first filtered
through a moving wire, then compressed and dewatered between press felts – both operations
being mechanical separations, and finally dried by passage over heated rolls – a molecular sep￾aration. Molecular separations are part of the chemical engineering domain of mass transfer, with
mechanical separations being part of momentum transfer (and, for completeness, most molecular
and mechanical separations also involve energy transfer).
The discussion is organized around the process-design situationsthat call fortreatment by molec￾ular separation. The above techniques are discussed as they crop up as one of the appropriate
approaches to particular situations. The separation situations to be addressed are as follows:
1. mixtures of permanent gases,
2. mixtures of vapors and permanent gases,
3. mixtures of vapors,
4. mixtures of liquids,
5. liquid solutions containing dissolved solids, and
6. solid solutions and solids containing liquids or vapor.
There are many techniques for molecular separations. An all-inclusive list cannot be given
because new techniques are developed from time to time. The ones that are considered here, to a
greater or lesser extent, are listed in Table 18.1.
The following two-volume reference, although somewhat out of date, describes several of the
more modern molecular-separation techniques that have been developed Li (1972).
18.1 Separation of Permanent Gases
Permanent gases are substances of very low critical (liquefaction) temperature and relatively low
reactivity, such as hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen as well as argon, and the other inert gases.
Sometimes a gas stream just needs to be enriched, and at other times, high purity is needed. There
are three methods generally used to separate mixtures.
18.1.1 Cryogenic Distillation
Although the gases are “permanent”, they can still be liquefied at sufficiently low temperature
accompanied by high pressure. The mixture is then distilled. For the separation of air into its

components, thisisthe oldest and most common method. Great purity can be attained: forinstance,
nitrogen containing one part per billion of contaminant. Such purity is needed in certain appli￾cations. Propane and propylene are commonly separated cryogenically because of the need for
high-purity propylene. The method is energy intensive, but the energy can be reduced by manage￾ment with heat exchangers. Alcantara-Avila et al. (2014). calculated a potential reduction of 75%.
18.1.2 Adsorption
The phenomenon of surface adsorption can be used to condense permanent gases and to do it
preferentially. Treybal (1980) showed a case where a 1 : 2 mixture of oxygen and nitrogen was
adsorbed in the ratio 1 : 1 on activated carbon because of the preference of oxygen for adsorption.
Figure 18.1 shows a continuous process for carrying out the adsorption. Adsorber #1 is currently
removing an unwanted component from a gas stream, the rate of adsorption being increased by
high pressure. Adsorber #2, which had been adsorbing until becoming saturated, is currently des￾orbing at low pressure aided by a small stream from adsorber #1.
The subject of gas fractionation by adsorption is treated in textbooks by Yang (1997, 2003).
An introduction to the technology is given by Broom (2018) and Gabelman (2017). Some calcula￾tional details are provided by Torzewski (2009B) and Louis (2005A). Sircar et al. (1995) discussed
the most widely used adsorbent, activated carbon, as a tool for separating gas mixtures. Vermesse
et al. (1996) measured the high-pressure adsorption on zeolites of nitrogen, methane, and some
noble gases. Siperstein & Myers (2001) explored the prediction of the equilibrium of individual
components when part of a multicomponent mixture.18.1 Separation of Permanent Gases 325

18.1.3 Membrane Permeation
Preferential diffusion through a membrane of one component over another is the principle of this
method. Hollow-fiber polymeric membranes are commonly used. Ceramic membranes are being
developed that will be more selective and that will allow higher temperature. The purity of the
separated components is not as high as that obtainable in cryogenic separation but is adequate
for many purposes. The equipment is less expensive and more portable, and the process uses less
energy than distillation. It is coming into common use.
Figure 18.2 illustratesthe principle ofseparation.If the initial gasis air, then “A” would be oxygen
and “B” would be nitrogen.
Loprete (2019) provided an introduction to the technology of separating gases with membranes.
Shelley (2009) described the use of membranes in capturing carbon dioxide from coal-burning
plants. Hairston (2000) discussed the merits of membrane separation relative to cryogenics.
A commercial product based on membrane separation is the PRISM® nitrogen membrane
separator. It can produce nitrogen at purities to 99.5%, which is needed for nitrogen to provide
inert atmospheres. Enriched air (in the permeate) is a by-product. Pressure is typically in the
10–15 bar gauge, temperature at or above ambient. The high pressure makes for easy handling
and loading.

18.2 Separation of Gas–Vapor Mixtures
The most common and most widely studied of the gas–vapor systems is air–water. A large amount
of graphical data exist. It should be noted that the coincidence of wet-bulb temperature and
adiabatic-saturation temperature for the air–water system is not generally true for gas–vapor
systems.
In general, the separation of vapor from a gas is easier than a gas from a gas. The following are
methods that are used alone or in sequence.
18.2.1 Condensation
If the vapor content issignificant and if very complete removal of vaporis notrequired, then simple
condensation may be adequate. This operation may be carried out in the type of condenser shown
in Figure 18.3, or it may be done using a cool spray of already condensed material. Condensation
may be used to remove the bulk of the vapor prior to a more thorough method.
18.2.2 Absorption
Absorption of organic components out of a gas stream is a traditional chemical engineering unit
operation. It is commonly carried out in a packed or a trayed countercurrent column. Figure 18.4
shows the gas–vapor mixture entering the bottom and emerging from the top free, or substantially
free, of vapor. The absorbing liquid (or “oil”) enters at the top and leaves at the bottom as a solu￾tion containing the absorbed vapor component. This stream must subsequently be stripped of the
condensed vapor component so that the oil can be reused in the absorber.
Absorption is a “senior member” of the chemical engineer’strusted company of operations. How￾ever, itstill enjoys efforts to upgrade the technology and to improve the accuracy of designs. LePree
(2015), Torzewski (2008B), Louis (2005), and Bennett (2000) suggested areas to examine, including
the shape of packing in packed columns. Graf (2011), Kister et al. (2007), and Bennett provided
design procedures and equations.
18.2.3 Adsorption
Adsorption on a solid is commonly used for vapor removal. For instance, in the lab, air is dried
by contact with silica gel. Common adsorbents are activated carbon (a highly porous material),

The last named adsorbents are distinguished by the following qualities:
● they can separate materials on the basis of molecular size and configuration;
● they are very tenacious, especially for polar and polarizable molecules;
● they have relatively high adsorption capacity even at low adsorbate concentration and elevated
temperature.
In some cases, activated carbon is preferred precisely because of its weaker bonding with
adsorbents, which allows easier regeneration. A reference to adsorption on zeolitesis Breck (1974).
18.2.4 Membrane Separation
The composition and construction of a membrane can be tailored to allow preferred passage
of a vapor component, similar to what is shown in Figure 18.2. This operation is called vapor
permeation.
18.3 Separation of Vapor Mixtures
Vapors can be separated from one another by three methods.
18.3.1 Distillation
Because vapors can be condensed, the traditional unit operation of distillation is a method of
separation. Two extreme cases are as follows:
1. the higher-condensing (i.e. less volatile) component is the major component;
2. the lower-condensing component is the major component.328 18 Molecular Separations

In the former case, the total vaporshould be condensed before feeding to the distillation column,
as shown on the left of Figure 18.5. In the latter case, the vapor should be fed as such to the col￾umn, as shown on the right. These practices avoid excessive and unnecessary vapor or liquid flows
respectively within the column.
18.3.2 Adsorption
Adsorption is frequently used to remove contaminants from vapor streams. Solid adsorbers can be
tailored to remove specific componentsfrom vapor(and liquid).In the case of activated carbon, two
aspects can be varied: the functionality and the energy. For instance, a catalytic functionality can
be imparted to the surface which allows oxygen to react with contaminants that would otherwise
adsorb only weakly and to convert them into productsthat adsorb well. The energy of an adsorberis
a measure of how strongly it adsorbs. The smaller the pore size, the greater the energy. High energy
is required for trace components and components that adsorb weakly Carr & Vaughn (2003).
18.3.3 Membrane Permeation
The term pervaporation takes its name from the fact that liquid components permeating through
the membrane exit on the other side in the form of vapor. If the component is already a
vapor, then the process is called vapor permeation. In either case, the process is distinguished
by the fact that the minor component (rather than the major component as in reverse osmosis)
diffuses through the membrane. One application is in the separation of water and ethanol where
vapor permeation is used to remove water from the (mainly ethanol) azeotropic vapor mixture
leaving the top of a distillation column.
A description of pervaporation is given by Wynn (2001).
18.4 Separation of Liquid Mixtures
The separation of a liquid mixture into its componentsis one of the most widely studied operations
in chemical engineering. While distillation is the first method that comes to mind, it is not always
suitable and it is always a considerable consumer of energy. Other methods have been developed
that are either more selective, more gentle, or less energy demanding.18.4 Separation of Liquid Mixtures 329

Figure 18.6 Liquid separation by sparging and flashing.
18.4.1 Distillation and Stripping
The effectiveness of distillation depends on volatility differences between components. As a rule of
thumb, if the ratio of volatilities is less than 2, then the separation begins to require an excessive
number ofstages and/or to require an excessive amount of reflux (which needs energy to produce).
On the other hand, if the volatility ratio is high and if the starting concentration of the more volatile
component is low, then it may be practical to remove it by a single stage of flashing or by stripping
with a permanent gas, as shown in Figure 18.6.
Two techniques are sometimes applied to extend the effectiveness of distillation down to volatility
ratios less than 2 and also to extend it to cases where the components form an azeotrope. One is
azeotropic distillation, where an extraneous liquid, an entrainer, is added part way up the column
to form a low-boiling azeotrope with one of the components, thus allowing that component to
free itself from the other and to leave the column as a vapor. The other is extractive distillation in
which, again, an extraneous liquid is added but, in this case, to form a low-boiling solution with
one component, thus allowing that component to separate from the other and leave the bottom of
the column.
If the starting liquid comprises more than two components and if all components are to be recov￾ered individually, then the required number of columns (or separation devices of some sort) equals
the number of components minus one. There is a choice in the order in which the separations are
done: For instance, with a mixture of A, B, and C, we could separate A from B and C in the first
column and then separate B from C in the second column, or we could separate B first, or we could
separate C first; i.e., there are three choices. For 4 components, there are 12 choices. The number of
choices grows rapidly with the number of components. Some heuristic rules have been developed
to assist in setting up the sequence that has lowest cost of capital and of energy:
I. Do the easy splits first, i.e., where the volatility ratio is high. Easy splits generally consume less
energy. Subsequently, the more difficult splits, which require more energy, will be done with
lower flow rates, reducing the overall energy needed by the system.
II. Separate out the large-fraction components early.
III. Run the columns with vapor–liquid splits as close as possible to 1 : 1.
IV. If possible, use the “direct” sequence, i.e., remove the isolated component from the top of the
column at each step.
V. Avoid refrigeration and vacuum, possibly by choosing the operating pressure of the column.
Avoid difficult splits. Seek alternative separation techniques.330 18 Molecular Separations
Obviously, these rules will sometimes conflict with one another, but they provide a helpful start￾ing point.
In dealing with a provider of distillation columns, it should be noted that even the ancient art of
distillation has seen some significant improvements in the equipment of which the vendor should
be aware. There is a wealth of publications of which a few recent articles are listed here:
O’Connell et al. (2019) using a membrane to separate heavy components out of the reflux stream,

(1997) extractive distillation.
18.4.2 Extraction
Extraction is another of the traditional chemical engineering operations, relying on the difference
of solubility, in an introduced solvent, of one component over another. The precise arrangement
of the system may depend on whether the component being extracted is a valuable product or
whether it is a contaminant in the non-extracted (or lesser-extracted) component. The simplest
extraction device is the laboratory separatory funnel. Generally, more than one stage of extraction
is needed in order to get the required degree of separation, each stage consisting of intimate
dispersion of the two liquid phases with each other in order to allow the transfer of extract,
followed by the separation of the two phases. The operation may be carried out in stirred tanks
followed by decanters, or it may be done in a multistage agitated column. The example in
Figure 18.7 shows a three-stage system with 70% separation efficiency for each stage resulting in
90% overall efficiency.
Gupta and Jain (2018) presented an optimized approach to choosing solvent. Koch & Shiveler
(2015) reviewed design principles for extraction. Glatz & Parker (2004) discussed improvements
that could improve extraction systems.

18.4.3 Adsorption
Adsorption on solids is frequently used to remove impurities (often color-producing impurities)
from products. Carr & Vaughn (2003 April) presented examples of the use of activated carbon in
this service.
18.4.4 Membrane Permeation
Pervaporation, as explained in Section 18.3.3, is a technique whereby a lesser component diffuses,
out of a main stream, through a membrane (Figure 18.8). Wynn (2001) presented examples.
Prime applications have been in the dehydration of organic liquids. Lower alcohols have also been
removed this way. For instance, in a biological process for producing ethanol, where the ethanol
is subsequently a poison for the organism, the ethanol is removed continuously by pervaporation.
18.4.5 Melt Crystallization
Crystallization from aqueous solutions is a well-practiced art. In that case, an innocuous solvent
(i.e. water) is being used. When the mixture consists of organic components, then any solvent that
is introduced will be another organic, which must subsequently be disposed of. To avoid solvents
is the purpose of melt crystallization: The organic mixture itself is the solvent. The technique is
effective when one of the components begins to solidify before the others and where there are no
solid solutions formed among components. The component must solidify into pure crystals, which
is generally the case because as crystals form they reject or expel extraneous substances. There
remains the need to separate the crystals from the residual organic melt.
One embodiment of a melt crystallizer is a batch system of vertical tubes inside of which the
starting organic mixture is loaded. Cooling is applied to the outside of the tubes and the desired
component freezes onto the inside walls. After a time, the residual melt is drained off. The tube
walls are heated somewhat to induce “sweating” of some liquid from the crystals: This liquid con￾tains most of the impurities that were trapped in the crystal film. It is drained off. Then the heat is
increased to melt the crystals, and they are drained off as a product.
A melt-crystallization system may be operated in a multistage manner, where the product (i.e.
the crystal-forming component) is recrystallized to further purify it and where the residual liquid
is put through another stage of crystallization in order to recover more useful product.
References to this process are Ondrey & Hairston (2001), Ondrey (2000), and Wynn (1992).
18.5 Separation of Liquid Solutions from Dissolved Solids
This section examines the class of homogeneous liquid mixtures where one of the components
would be a solid if in its pure state. When dissolved in the liquid, the solid may retain its molecular
form or it may dissociate into ions.332 18 Molecular Separations
18.5.1 Vaporization
One way to separate the dissolved component is simply to vaporize the liquid component(s) from
the mixture. However, this process consumes a significant amount of energy if the liquid is predom￾inant. We reserve vaporization where the object is to rid the solid of a small amount of liquid for
section 18.6.1. The process may consist of a boiling operation followed by a diffusional removal of
the last traces of liquid. An alternative is to spray dry by atomizing the solution and then exposing
it to elevated temperature. The temperature may be provided by a hot gas, or it may come by radia￾tion from hot walls of a vessel. The very high surface-to-volume ratio of the finely divided droplets
provides excellent heat transfer and vaporization. Usually, the desired product is the solid, which
collects at the bottom of the device.
18.5.2 Solution Crystallization
Crystallization from solution is a well-known operation, capable of producing a solid product
of great purity. Of course, if the remaining liquid is the product of interest and if the crystal￾lization is carried out just to eliminate an unwanted component, then the crystal purity is of
no interest.
The operation requires creating a metastable state in the liquid, where the concentration of dis￾solved solute exceeds the solubility limit. The difference between the actual concentration and the
soluble limit is the driving force for the dissolved solid to come out of solution. The objective is for
it to come out of solution in the form of large uniform crystals (Figure 18.9). The other objective is
for it to do so fairly rapidly.
The metastable state is created in one (or both, simultaneously) of two ways:
● cooling the solution or
● evaporating some of the solution.
It may be necessary to “seed” the solution with some initial crystals, with the goal that newly
solidifying material will adhere to and grow these initial crystals rather than form a multiplicity of
small new crystals.
Crystallization may be carried out batch-wise or carried out continuously (often in two or more
stages). It is important that the vessel be uniformly mixed but without damaging the crystals
through overly vigorous agitation: This condition is generally easier to achieve at the lab or
pilot-plant scale than at the commercial scale.

et al. (2004), and Genck (2011, 2000).
Figure 18.9 Regular and irregular crystals.18.5 Separation of Liquid Solutions from Dissolved Solids 333
18.5.3 Ion Exchange
Ion exchange may be considered as a form of adsorption, an adsorption in which ionic force binds
the adsorbate and adsorbent. It is used to remove ionic species from solution. The original ion
exchangers were zeolites in which relatively loosely held sodium ions were exchanged for heavier
ions in solution. The application was primarily the softening of water, and the heavier ions are
primarily calcium and magnesium. This is still a major application of ion exchange.
Modern day ion-exchange substances comprise a much wider variety and are tailored to specific
uses. Polymeric gels are used in which functionality is included to trap either positive or negative
ions. For positive ions, the functional groups are sulfonic, carboxylic, or phenolic: These are cationic
exchangers. For negative ions, the functional groups may be amines: These are anionic exchangers.
In some applications, a cationic exchanger and an anionic exchanger are used in series. In some
other exchangers, a mixed bed is used.
Ion exchangers have to be regenerated periodically to remove the trapped ions and replace them
with the original, exchangeable ions. This is done be exposing the gel beads to a concentrated solu￾tion of the original ions. Those ions may be typically sodium, or they may be hydrogen or hydroxyl.
In the latter two cases, in use the exchanger releases into the treated stream only hydrogen or
hydroxyl rather than an extraneous material like sodium.
McNulty (1997) and Shanley (2000) are references for ion exchange.
18.5.4 Reverse Osmosis and Dialysis
Dialysis is a general term for separating molecules on the basis of size using semipermeable non￾porous membranes. Pervaporation and vapor permeation are examples. Reverse osmosis (RO) is
another variant.
In the natural process of osmosis, if a solution and a solvent are on opposite sides of a membrane,
the solvent molecules will diffuse into the solution. In reverse osmosis, a pressure is applied to the
solution side, high enough to overcome the natural osmotic force and to force the solvent out of
the solution and across the membrane. Thus, in an application like the purification of saline or
brackish water, the major component, water, passes through the membrane. This contrasts with
pervaporation where the minor component passes through.
In modern practice, the membrane is the wall of hollow fibers as in DuPont’s PERMASEP® per￾meator. The substance may be cellulose acetate or, in the PERMASEP, an aromatic polyamide.
Considerations are as follows:
● the rate of permeation,
● the degree (“rejection”) to which the unwanted solute is left behind, and
● the extent of recovery of the desired solvent.
These factors depend on the nature of the solution and of the membrane but also on the differ￾ential pressure imposed across the membrane. This pressure is typically hundreds or thousands of
pounds per square inch, requiring the membrane to be adequately supported physically.
Reverting to processes where only a minor component crosses the membrane, a dialysis process
known as electrodialysis applies an electric potential across the membrane to facilitate the transfer
of specific charged ions.
Introduction to the technology of reverse osmosis is provided by Stover (2014), Huchler (2002,
2010, 2014), and Kucera (2008, 2019). Moftah (2003) discussed water purification by RO.334 18 Molecular Separations
18.6 Separations: Solid–Solid, Dissolved Fluids from Solid
By contrast with liquid solutions, which may contain normally solid solutes, the solid solution is
primarily solid but may contain normally liquid components. The prime example is a solid con￾taining dissolved water. On the other hand, the solid may be composed entirely of components
that would be solid in their pure state. Where the word “moisture” is used, in this case, it denotes
any liquid.
18.6.1 Drying
The term drying is used here for the removal of any component (not just water) in the form of
vapor. Drying is a major operation in the processing industries, and there are many types of dryers.
The choice depends on several factors.
Parikh (2014) reviewed drying in general. For guidance in choosing a dryer, see Moyers (2003).
The solid may be in different forms. A finely divided solid that is wetted by the liquid may be
in the form of a slurry or paste. If only surface moisture is present, then a heated carrier gas may
be sufficient to flash away the moisture, Christiansen & Sardo (2001). Spreading on a tray and
sweeping with an inert gas, possibly with heating, can be satisfactory. A more effective device is
the wiped-film evaporator, which continually refreshes the surface of the mixture.
Glover (2004), Raouzeos (2012), and Bethge (2016) discussed wiped-film evaporators.
If a slurry or paste can be atomized, then spraying the mixture through a hot carrier gas, possibly
with wall heating as well, is an effective way of reducing moisture. The small size of the solid parti￾cles effectively eliminates internal mass transfer resistance. Spray drying is discussed by Langrish
(2009) and Moller & Fredsted (2009).
Alternatively, the solid may be in fixed form as a thread, as a sheet, or as pellets. One key con￾sideration is whether the prime resistance to mass transfer is on the inside or the outside of the
solid. If on the outside, the governing process may be heat transfer. If the prime resistance is on
the inside, then time and temperature are the main requirement for drying. If on the outside, then
agitation will assist as in a fluidized bed or as in a tumbling or rotary drier. In many cases, the ratio
of internal-to-external resistance changes during the operation: At first, during the constant-rate
period, the vaporizing component is at or near the surface of the solid and requires only heat to
vaporize; later, in the falling-rate period, the remainder of the vaporizing component is in pores or
is truly dissolved and requires time to diffuse to the surface. If a high degree of drying is required,
encompassing both of these regimes, then a two stage system may be needed. For instance, in dry￾ing of pellets, a fluidized bed may do the initial drying and a slowly moving bed may do the final
drying.
The characteristics of the solid dictate the available forms of dryers. Fragility may rule out the
more vigorous styles of the dryer. A gravity dryer can be more suitable, with pellets descending and
a drying gas ascending in a tubular vessel (Mehos 2009). Vacuum-assisted drying is discussed by
Parikh (2015) and Tritschler (2017).
If the vapor is innocuous or of no value, like water, then direct drying using a stream of gas (e.g.
air, nitrogen, and superheated steam) is acceptable and effective. The main purpose of the gas is to
provide the heat and also to convey away the vapor.
If the vapor must be recovered or disposed of, then it may be preferable to use indirect drying in
which the heat issupplied through the dryersurfaces. A small amount of gas may be used to convey
away the vapor. In this type of dryer, it is necessary, in order to order to achieve good heat transfer,
to provide agitation. For slurries and pastes, a wiped-film evaporator is appropriate. Pellets can beReferences 335
agitated in a thermalscrew. Kimball(2001), Raouzeos(2003), and Lattman & Laible (2005) provided
guidance on the subject of direct versus indirect drying.
18.6.2 Leaching
In the operation of leaching, the component to be removed from the solid is taken out in the form
of liquid, using a solvent that penetrates the solid, dissolves the component, and carries it out of
the solid. This operation is akin to that of liquid–liquid extraction. Leaching is very prominent in
metallurgical practice and also in the food industry. Its rate is governed primarily by the diffusion
of solvent in and out of the solid Karnofsky (2005).
18.6.3 Melt Crystallization: Zone Melting
If the solid istruly a mixture ofsolids, then it may be advantageousto fully or partially melt it and to
use one of the liquid separation methodsto separate the components. A process called zone melting
is described by Atwood (1972) in which a solid solution is successively melted and frozen. During
each molten period, there is countercurrent diffusion of components.
Atwood (1969, 1972) described this process.

Chemical Reactions
A chemical engineer may expect, at some point in her or his career, to have to arrange for the
conduct of a chemical reaction. Reactors can take many forms depending on several factors but
primarily on the phase or phases of the reactants and products. The following seven situations are
examined here
1. gas phase,
2. liquid phase,
3. gas–liquid,
4. immiscible liquids,
5. fluid and solid, non-catalytic,
6. solid-catalyzed, and
7. bio-reactions.
However, before any thought of choosing and designing a reactor, the engineer must ascertain
two general facts about the proposed reaction:
A. The chemical characteristics of the reaction.
● Is it reversible?
● What is the order of the reaction with respect to each of the reactants?
● What is the rate constant? What is the equilibrium constant?
● Is it a simple reaction, following some simple path such as
Reactant → product
or are there intermediate species between the feed material and the desired product?
● Is the desired product subject to further, undesired reaction?
● Are there other (desirable or undesirable) reactions, parallel to the reaction that produces the
desired product?
● Are there inhibitors to the reaction or poisons to the catalyst that degrade or inhibit the reaction,
either products, intermediates, or temperature?
Ascertaining all of these facts may be very difficult. For a new reaction, extensive experiments
may be required, which, hopefully and ideally, can be carried out at the laboratory bench, i.e., at a
small scale. Understanding the chemistry is absolutely vital to successful reactor design. The scale
of a whole plant, for instance, can depend on the value of a single kinetic constant.
Practical Process Design for Chemical Engineers, First Edition. Keith Marchildon and David Mody.
© 2025 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2025 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.342 19 Chemical Reactions
B. The physical phenomena that accompany the chemical reaction.
● Is the reaction significantly endothermic so that heat must be continuously supplied in order to
sustain its progress? Is there a volatile product or by-product that must be continuously removed
by vaporization?
● Is the reaction significantly exothermic so that heat must be continuously removed in order to
maintain temperature and to prevent runaway?
● Is there a significant resistance to mass transfer of a reactant or product from one phase to
another?
● If a porous catalyst is involved, is the diffusion of components to and from the reactive sites a
limiting rate?
It is not unusual for the design of a particular reactor design to be focused more on heat, mass,
and momentum transfer rather than on chemistry. There may be more facts to learn, such as the
toxicity of reactants, intermediates, or products, and the tendency for runaway reaction.
The subject of reaction and reactors isimportant enough to attract a number of publications over
the years. Cusack (1999A,B, 2000) and Bartholomew & Farrauto (2006) provided a good overview.
Worstell (2001) and Ranade (2002) stated the questions which should be initially asked by anyone
before starting to design a reactor. The book by Conesa (2019) explores the many aspects of the
mathematical modeling of chemical reactors. Dutta & Gualy (2000) proposed a 14-step modeling
approach. Bakker et al.(2001)look at the physicalside ofreactors and their design by computational
fluid dynamics.
19.1 Gas-Phase Reactions
We are asked to design a reactor to react a gas or a mixture of gases. Likely, the choice will be to
operate at
● high temperature because reaction occurs faster and because there is no need or desire as there
would probably be in liquid-phase processing to keep materials below their boiling point, and
● high pressure because reaction occurs faster when the volumetric concentrations of the
components are higher.
Reactions within gasses are very frequently carried out in the presence of a solid catalyst, but
that aspect is considered later. For non-catalyzed reactions, the most efficient reactor is continuous
plug flow rather than back-mixed.
Some possibilities are as follows:
1. a simple long tube, operated in turbulent flow in order to approximate plug flow and to achieve
good mixing and heat transfer,
2. a simple tube fully or partially filled with static mixers to achieve even better plug flow, mixing,
and heat transfer (see Figure 19.1),
3. a vertical vessel (Figure 19.2) filled with a packing (but the packing uses up reaction volume),
4. a vertical vessel fitted with periodic sieve-plate baffles to achieve a staged, close-to-plug-flow
state, and
5. a multi-tube vertical vessel to achieve more surface area if heat rejection is a major concern,
which it often is with gaseous reactions.
For a reaction in any phase, plug flow is attractive because it makes the most efficient use of
reactor volume compared with any other continuous-flow configuration. Comparing, for instance,19.1 Gas-Phase Reactions 343
Figure 19.1 Continuous plug-flow reactor including static mixers.
Figure 19.2 Means for radial dispersion of continuous fluid flow.
with a back-mixed reactor, for a simple reaction of
Rate = −k × [X]
where d[X]/d(time) = rate = −k × [X],
i.e., the consumption of component “X” is first order in “X” and irreversible, then the following
conversions are achieved, as shown in Table 19.1.
Unfortunately, perfect plug flow is an ideal that is never fully attained in practice. In the flow
in a tube, there is always some degree of axial dispersion. This is obvious for laminar flow (see
Figure 19.3) because, although the axial dispersion due to molecular motion is very small, the344 19 Chemical Reactions

parabolic velocity profile creates the effect of a huge axial dispersion. For turbulent flow, which
has a much flatter velocity profile, axial dispersion is due to the turbulent fluctuations themselves
and may significantly detract from the efficiency of a nominally plug-flow tubular reactor. Cusack
(2000 February) provided the graphical relationships of Levenspiel (1999) that show how a tracer
test can be used to determine this loss of reaction efficiency.
19.2 Liquid-Phase Reactions
One or more miscible liquids are to be reacted. The product or a by-product may be a vapor,
but for purposes of this discussion, the system is still considered liquid phase. Also, the case of
immiscible liquids is considered later. Broadly, the reactor choices are batch, continuous plug-flow,
and continuous back-mixed. These options are discussed here. Milne et al. (2006B) offered some
thoughts on making this choice. Fontes (2015) compared the mathematical modeling of all
three types.
19.2.1 Batch Reactor and Fed-Batch Reactor
A batch reactor operates in a time-sequence of events: an amount of reactant is supplied, it is
converted chemically to product, and the product is discharged. Most new chemical technologies
start out as batch processes before ever being converted to continuous processing. Batch processes
have advantages, real or potential:
● relatively low capital cost,
● ease of incremental expansion (build more reactors),
● flexibility for different products, and
● transparency and ease of control,19.2 Liquid-Phase Reactions 345
Figure 19.4 Typical batch reactor with agitator, pressure control, and
additive port. P
and they have real or potential disadvantages:
● generally higher labor cost (which may be relieved by modern sequencing control),
● batch-to-batch nonuniformity of product, and
● internal nonuniformity if sufficient agitation is not supplied for adequate mixing of reactants or
for adequate suspension of solid reactants or catalyst particles.
Batch reactors are sometimes operated in fed-batch mode, where additions are made to the batch
during the course of the process (see Figure 19.4). The designation particularly applies to the case
where a significant amount of a reacting component is added. Some situations where this approach
is applicable are
● a reacting component is susceptible to an undesirable side-reaction or to volatilization,
● the reaction is a large producer or consumer of heat, so it is desired to moderate its rate, and
● a reaction by-product is continuously volatilized from the vessel, making room for more liquid.
McConville (2007) presented the Do’s and Don’ts of scaling up batch reactors. One of the
possibilities with batch processing is for an exothermic reaction to get out of hand. Venugopal
(2002), Shinskey (2004), Marshall (2007), and Kwasny (2008) dealt with the prevention of runaway
reactions.
19.2.2 Continuous Plug-Flow Reactor
For the advantage and with the considerations explained in Section 19.1, plug-flow or staged
plug-flow is a candidate for liquid-phase as well as gas-phase reactions. If a volatile product or
by-product results from the reaction, it can be carried along with the liquid or move ahead of
it: Prediction of the relative velocities of the two phases and prediction of the in situ volume
fraction occupied by liquid (and therefore available for reaction) is the province of two-phase flow
relationships (Figure 19.5).
19.2.3 Continuous Back-Mixed Reactor
The back-mixed reactor or Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is very common in chemical
processing. It has the following advantages:
● simple fluid dynamics, dependent only on the ability to be agitated,
● easy to scale up, and
● uniformity, absence of hot spots.346 19 Chemical Reactions
Figure 19.5 Two-phase flow – homogeneous and stratified.
The disadvantages are as follows:
● inefficient use of reactor volume because reactant concentration is all at the final values and
therefore low, minimizing the driving force, and
● possibility of inadequate mixing and therefore channeling and zones of stagnation.
The “Stirred” in CSTR tends to imply a mechanical agitator or stirrer, which is frequently
the case (Figure 19.6). Such an arrangement, with its requirement for a rotating seal, may be
inadvisable when the pressure differs significantly from atmospheric and/or when it is imperative

that the contents of the vessel be isolated from the atmosphere. In these cases, an external
pump-around loop (Figure 19.7), flowing at a rate of 10 (or more) times the net flow through the
vessel, or the introduction of a sparging gas may produce adequate mixing. The pump-around
gives the opportunity for including heat transfer along its length.
A very common configuration (see Figure 19.8) in chemical processing is the back-mixed reactor
followed by a separator which removes product and recycles unreacted material to the reactor.
There are four circumstances where this configuration should be considered:
1. The reaction must be taken to a very high degree of conversion. Thisis difficult in a CSTR, where
the driving force for reaction becomes very low when the starting reactants have been almost all
consumed. With separation and recycle, the CSTR can be operated at a modest conversion and
still achieve high conversion by the system as a whole.
2. The reaction is reversible. If product is not removed, then the reaction reaches a standstill.
3. The desired product is susceptible to further, unwanted reaction.
4. The product causes poisoning of a catalyst.
One of the problemsin the scale-up of reactorsisthe provision (or removal) of heat. At the bench
scale or in a small pilot plant, the wall of the vessel may provide sufficient surface area for heat
transfer. As the scale gets larger, the ratio of wall surface area to reactor volume gets less. In this
case, two options for increased heat transfer are as follows:
● provide an internal heating coil or a bank of heating coils (Figure 19.9);
● provide an external heat exchanger with liquid pumped through it or with a boiling mixture being
circulated by gravitational force with no need for a pump (Figure 19.10).348 19 Chemical Reactions
Figure 19.9 Internally heated reactor.
Figure 19.10 Externally heated reactor.19.3 Gas–Liquid Reactions 349
Simply cranking up the temperature of the heating system may not be possible, and it may be
undesirable because the hotter surfaces may degrade the product
19.3 Gas–Liquid Reactions
Not uncommonly, one reactant is a liquid and the other is a gas. It may be impractical to raise or
lower the temperature (and pressure) to bring all reactants into the same phase. Assuming that
reaction takes place in only the liquid phase, it is necessary to transfer the gaseous component into
this phase: that is, mass transfer becomes a consideration. The relative roles of mass transfer and
of chemical reaction in dictating the overall speed of the process are illustrated in Figure 19.11.
In this simple example, the component C is being transferred from the gas to the liquid and the
rate of reaction depends on the liquid-phase concentration [C] in some simple manner, as shown
by line “R1”. The rate of transfer of C into the liquid is proportional to the difference between
the concentration [C]vle that would be in equilibrium with the vapor and the actual liquid-phase
concentration [C], as shown by the line “M1”. The rate of transfer and the rate of reaction have to
be equal at steady state, so the concentration [C] and the overall rate of the process are determined
by the point at which the two lines cross. In the case shown, both the reaction and mass transfer
are exerting a significant influence and neither phenomenon can be ignored.
By contrast, the combination of lines “R2” and “M2” show a case where mass transfer has a
negligible effect and the combination of lines “R3” and “M3” show a case where mass transfer has
the dominating effect.
Some considerations are as follows:
● Forthe particularsystem, it is necessary to establish what isthe actualrelation between the chem￾ical rate and the transfer rate. This requires reference to the literature and also careful pilot-plant
study.
● On scale-up, the chemical rate staysthe same, but the masstransfer coefficient or rate factor may
change.
● Very fast reaction rates may actually enhance mass transfer, by continually lowering [C] at the
interface to zero (or by continually raising it if [C] is being transferred out of the liquid phase).
● In cases where masstransfer effects are significant, there is an opportunity to use agitation inten￾sity to speed up the process.
● In cases where the chemical reaction rate is a significant limitation, it may be profitable to look
for a better catalyst.
The definitive discussion of this type of reactor is given by Fair (1967).

19.4 Reaction of Immiscible Liquids
Two common situations are as follows:
1. The reactants themselves are immiscible and react only at their interface.
2. A non-reacting immiscible liquid is added to the reaction mixture in order to extract the product
as it is made. This removal of product may be desirable to protect it from further (or reverse)
reaction.
If the reaction is being carried out in a batch vessel orin a CSTR, the usual procedure isto provide
high-intensity agitation to break up the dispersed phase and increase the interfacial surface area. If
the reaction is being carried out in a pipeline, then high-intensity, high-pressure-drop static mixers
will maximize the dispersion. In either case, energy must be provided either to rotate an agitator or
to pump the liquid through the static mixers. In-line high-shear mixers that resemble centrifugal
pumps are also commercially available.
The interplay between the reaction rate and masstransferissimilarto that in a gas–liquid reactor.
Figure 19.12 shows a pipeline reactor with two streams of entering reactants. A third component
is added part way along the reaction path. The in-line static mixer which is shown is of only mild
intensity. It would be suitable for making the distribution of the two phases radially uniform, but
not to finely disperse the phases. For that purpose, a static mixer of the type shown in Figure 19.1
would be necessary.
Streiff & Rogers(1994) discussed the benefits and the technology for all pipeline reactorsin which
static mixers fill part or all of the pipe along its way.
19.5 Fluid–Solid Reactions, Non-Catalytic
This type of system occurs mainly in combustors and in ore smelting. Both the solids and the fluids
are reactants. The overall rate of reaction depends, again, on a combination of mass transfer and
chemical reaction rate, the individual actions being
1. diffusion of fluid (gas or liquid) from the bulk of the fluid to the surface of the particles,
2. diffusion through any crust that exists at the surface,
Figure 19.12 Pipeline reactor with static mixer.19.6 Solid-Catalyzed Reactions 351
AIC AI
Figure 19.13 Tumbling reactor, fluidized-bed reactor, moving-bed reactor.
3. diffusion within the particle,
4. reaction within the particle, and
5. diffusion of gaseous reaction products back out of the particle.
The diameter of the particles is a major determinant of rate. The surface area of a fixed total
mass varies inversely as the diameter of the particles into which it is divided. The external mass
transfer coefficient tends to vary inversely as diameter. The internal diffusion rate varies inversely
as diameter squared. All effects therefore point to the need to subdivide the solid mass as finely as
possible for the benefit of the reaction. Larger particles are favored when lower pressure drop and
less entrainment are important.
Fluid and solid reactant combinations are typically brought together in rotating drums or in flu￾idized beds (Figure 19.13) in order to enhance the surface contact between the two phases. Of
course, if the bulk of the mass transfer resistance lies within the particles, the enhanced contact
will be ineffective and a packed or slowly moving bed is appropriate.
19.6 Solid-Catalyzed Reactions
Solid or heterogeneous catalysts are used in many industrially important reactions. The fluid
medium may be gas or liquid or a mixture of both. The chemical reaction occurs at the solid
surface, and, in order to provide as much surface area as possible in a given volume of catalyst,
the catalyst particles are porous. The pore diameter is typically in the range 0.001–0.1 micron,
providing a surface area of 10 000–100 000 m2 (20 football fields) per kilogram of catalyst.
Just as in the case of non-catalyst solids (Section 3.10.5), the overall reaction speed is governed
by a combination of diffusion and actual chemical reaction. In this case, the principal diffusion
mechanism is the movement of reactive molecules up the pores and the movement of product
molecules back out of the pores. The ratio of actual reaction rate to the rate that would be achieved
if there were no pore diffusion resistance (i.e. the purely chemical rate) is called the effectiveness
factor, 𝜂. Design of a solid-catalyzed system requires some knowledge of the chemical rate and
of the effectiveness factor and of the conditions that affect them, e.g., temperature, pressure, and352 19 Chemical Reactions
concentration of reactants. This is knowledge that comes from the catalyst manufacturer and from
laboratory studies.
Liquid systems tend to have higher diffusional resistance than gas because diffusivity is lower
and viscosity is higher.
Other considerations are the selectivity of the catalyst for the desired reaction and also the speed
and nature of catalyst deactivation and/or poisoning. Also, the heat of reaction may be such as to
make the temperature of the interior of the catalyst significantly different from the bulk temper￾ature. A factor in scale-up is that external mass transfer around the catalyst pellet may also be a
limitation: Pilot-plant studies should address this effect.
The reactor type is usually a choice between the fixed bed and fluidized bed.
A fixed bed tends to be used if
1. the particles are large,
2. the catalyst has a long life,
3. plug flow is desired, and
4. heat effects are small.
A fluidized bed tends to be used if
1. the particles are small (e.g. less than 0.2 mm diameter),
2. significant heat must be removed,
3. the catalyst requires frequent regeneration,
4. plug flow is not required, and
5. the catalyst is not prone to attrition.
A variant of the fixed bed reactor is the moving bed, where the pellets are cycled into, through,
and out of the reactor so that they can be regenerated offline.
There are two considerations in building a solid-catalyzed system:
(1) choosing the catalyst;
(2) designing the reactor.
For background on the subject of solid catalysts, Heinen (2012) provided a history of 90 years
of development. Assistance in choosing a catalyst is provided by Bartholomew & Hecker (1994),
Loffler (2001), Maldonado & Rothenberg (2009), and Jenkins (2015). Problems with catalysts are
discussed by Worstell et al. (2000), Worstell & Worstell (2004), and Loffler (2002).
Designing the reactor often starts with a pilot plant. Scaling up is discussed by Worstell (2000),
Turaga et al. (2006), and Worstell (2007). Other design issues are taken up by Fontes et al. (2003)
and Nehlsen et al. (2007). Ahn et al. (2017, 2019) were helpful on the internals of catalytic reactors
in which the catalyst is held fixed in one or more beds. One paper presented a high-performance
vapor–liquid distributor. The other describes mixing chambers between beds, where mixing of
fluids can be reestablished and if necessary the stream can be cooled in order to protect the
catalysts from excessive temperatures.
19.7 Bio-Reactions
Chemical reactions deal with inanimate substances. Biochemical reactions deal with living sub￾stances, in the form of microbes, sometimes as small as consisting of just a single cell. Microbe
types are bacteria, archaea, fungi (mold or yeast), algae, protozoa, and also mammalian cells, all of
which are the province of biochemistry.19.7 Bio-Reactions 353
From the point of view of bio-reaction chemistry, the goal is either
1. to grow a living organism in a controlled manner or
2. to use an organism to convert one chemical species into another.
An example of the first case is the production of yeast, a single-cell microorganism of which
the variety saccharomyces cerevisiae is the desired product. Yeast exists beneficially in the body of
mammals, it is used in food, and it is used to power the production of other substances (such as
wine).
Another example of the growth of an organism is the bio-treatment of liquid wastes. A mixture
of bacteria and protozoa grows by ingesting impurities from the liquid and thereby purifying it.
The second application of bio-reactions, to convert substances into useful products, is the
subject of continuing development. The main products at present are pharmaceuticals. There
is hope for a future in which biology can replace petroleum-based processes, with attendant
reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and reduction in energy consumption. These
developments are in early stages. One very successful example is the production of 1,3-propane
diol from corn-based sugars. Developed by DuPont and Tate & Lyle, it uses a DNA-modified
Escherichia Coli bacteria to produce the product, with about 72% molar yield, 30–40% less energy
than an oil-based route and significantly less (GHG) emissions. Recent studies are presented
by Oh et al. (2018).
The prospects for the bio industry are discussed by Demain & Solomon (1981), van Hoek et al.
(2003), Jenkins (2010), Davison & Lievense (2016), and Schuster (2016).
Background on bio-chemistry is provided by Monk (2010), Jenkins (2011), Bhatia (2013, 2014),
and Le et al. (2016).
19.7.1 Bioreactors
Much of the technology of ordinary chemicalreactors carries overto bioreactors. Some aspectsthat
are specific to, or more important for, bio-systems are examined here.
1. At present, most bio-reactions are carried out batch-wise. Batch time is often long (days), so
labor requirements are not a factor.
2. A large reactor is often preceded by a small “seed” reactor (or even a series of increasing-size
seed reactors) where the microbe concentration grows. The addition of one reactor’s contents to
the next bigger reactor is an inoculum.
3. The “fed batch” mode of batch processing is often used in orderto avoid excessive concentrations
of the feed materials.
4. The reaction may include the consumption of oxygen (aerobic), or it may require the absence of
oxygen (anaerobic).
5. There must be some form of agitation in order to avoid stagnant zones. If oxygen is needed,
then the agitation must ensure an adequate mass transfer rate. However, the physical action of
agitation must respect the fragility of some microbial types, especially mammalian cells.
6. In most cases, avoidance of contamination is vital. This applies to the reactor itself and also
to agitators, pumps, valves, and piping around the vessel. Only the desired organisms must be
present, not the variety that float around in the world at large.
7. Control of conditions, e.g., pH, temperature, and oxygen concentration, is frequently important
in order to achieve the desired products and in desired yield.
8. If the product is a pharmaceutical, a proven record of the time-wise profile of each batch must
be kept for certification purposes.354 19 Chemical Reactions
Many publications provide guidance in the design of bioreactors. Benz (2011) is specifically
aimed at bio design for chemical engineers. Williams (2002) presents keys to bioreactor selections.
Adequate mass transfer for aerobic reactors is stressed by Doble (2006), not simply to make sure
that the oxygen requirement is met but also to ensure that the carbon dioxide waste product is
flushed out to keep its concentration low and avoid its toxic effects.
Benz (2008) treated the scale-up of agitators, and Benz (2016) discussed mass transfer in aerobic
fermenters. Bartow & Spark (2004) pointed out the restrictions on agitators when dealing with
fragile mammalian cell cultures.
Gregory & Green (2013), Gregory et al. (2014) discussed heat transfer and mass transfer
respectively in fermentation reactors. Heat transfer can be inadequate with large vessels if the only
heating surface is the vessel walls. Additional heat can be provided by an external heat exchanger,
through which some part of the reaction mixture is continually pumped, reheated, and returned
to the batch vessel. Excessively hot surfaces can be fatal to microbial populations.
As with all chemical processes, there is an impetusto switch from batch to continuous operation.
This transformation has been slow because mainly of the fragility of the reaction components and
because of the need for sterility. However, there are opportunities for continuous handling of feed
and product around a batch reactor. Le et al. (2015) proposed to replace fed-batch mode by instead
cycling a stream from inside the reactor through a perfusion cell, which draws off the liquid and
returns a concentrated stream of the solids to the reactor. By contrast, the fed-batch mode requires
drawing off a portion of the whole mixture (in order to keep constant the contents of the reactor).
Przybycien & Titchener-Hooker (2015) discussed making continuous some of the operations that
go on after the reactor.
Bioreactors, like any reactors, require process control. Particularly, for pharmaceutical
production, the control must be tight and the relevant process variables must be recorded for
product validation purposes. In 2001, the US Food and Drug Administration launched the Process
Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative, with the goal of ensuring product safety and quality.
Dream (2005) gave several examples of PAT. Alford (2011) discussed the application of automation
for this purpose. Wiss (2015) showed how various aspects of PAT come together in pharmaceutical
manufacturing. This concept extends beyond the reactor itself and includes feed preparation,
subsequent processing, and equipment maintenance.
19.7.2 Auxiliary Equipment and Operations for Bio-Systems
Miley et al. (2015) discussed the general principles of hygiene that are so necessary for bio systems.
Keeping equipment contamination-free often requires sterilization. Baez & Assaf-Anid (2008)
described novel and conventional approachesto this operation.Jenkins(2011) listed and described
five approaches. Rodriguez (2013) argued for single-use equipment, given that some stainless steel
units are being replaced by cheaper molded or flexible plastics.
Ingredients must be contamination-free. Baird & Williams (2005) presented eleven purification
options for water.
Leak-free facilities at and away from the reactor include pumps, valves, and seals. Weeks &
Bennett (2006) spoke about all the three items. Smith (2002) and Hiroyasu & Backes (2017) dealt
with pumps. Perusek & Orlando (2005) explained how diaphragm valves are leak proof. Benz
& Teng (2008) presented a selection platform for agitator seals. Birkmire (2007) focused on the
reactor itself and the use of bolted head closures.
The product from a bioreactor is never pure enough in form to be saleable or usable. Following
the reactor is a bio-separation train, which isolates the desired product. Methods include filtration,References 355
centrifugation, extraction, reverse osmosis, chromatography, and drying. If the product is a living
entity, then the intensity of a separation step must respect the allowable range of pH, temperature,
and other conditionsthat affect the product or any recyclable components. The separation sequence
should follow the usual rules for chemical separation, as stated by Harrison (2014):
● remove the most plentiful impurities first,
● remove the easiest-to-remove impurities first,
● make the most difficult and expensive separations last,
● select processes that make use of the greatest differences between the properties of the product
and those of its impurities, and
● select sequence processes that exploit different separation-driving forces.
Isolation and purification of the product is often the most difficult challenge in devel￾oping a complete bio-production system. Harrison, in his paper, focuses on two separation
techniques – filtration and chromatography.

Process Intensification and Integration
To meet its goals, the technology of chemical engineering comprises a wide variety of generic
processes and equipment, many of which have been described in Chapters 11–19. However,
Chemical Engineering also has a dynamism whereby its slate of processes and equipment is
periodically being expanded, being modified, being integrated, and/or simply being rearranged.
The incentives for these developments are a selection of the following:
● increase processing capacity,
● improve quality and/or uniformity of product,
● increase yield from raw materials,
● reduce energy requirement,
● reduce emissions, and
● reduce safety hazards.
Suppliers of process equipment regularly make changes that satisfy some of these objectives, but
these changes are usually incremental, as are likewise the changes that are made from time to time
by the operators of such processes. On the other hand, when a large step change with significant
benefits is made, often with innovative thinking “outside the box”, then this change qualifies as
ProcessIntensification. The term incorporatesthe making ofsuch technological upgrades anywhere
acrossthe entire field of processes. One major type of intensification is Process Integration, and that
large class of PI is specially featured in this chapter.
Process intensification has been going on for as long as chemical-engineering types of processes
have been around, but the idea of defining it as a subset of technology goes back to around the
1990s. Some early references are Green et al.(1999), Hallale (2001), Hendershot(2000), Stankiewicz
and Moulijn (2000), Tsouris & Porcelli (2003), Van Gerven & Stankiewicz (2009), and Stankiewicz
(2020). Kiss & Bildea (2015) presented a good list of the variety and benefits of PI. Bielenberg &
Bryner(2018)reviewed the currentsituation. Two recent books on the subject are Reay et al. (2013)
and Stankiewicz et al. (2019).
Any chemical-engineering processis a candidate forintensification. Several for which such work
has been done or proposed and which are instructive for general knowledge have been sought out,
grouped by similarity, and described in the next five sections (20.1 to 20.5).
20.1 Mixing and Comminution
Comminution is the physical dividing into smaller parts of a volume of solid or liquid. Mixing is a
broader term: It may act by causing comminution, but it may also act through other mechanisms.

Figure 20.1 Subdivison of volumes.
The arithmetic of subdivision is illustrated by the model of a cube of dimensions 1 × 1 × 1 cubic
units.Itssurface area is 6 × 1 × 1 or 6 surface units.If the cube is divided into eight parts by bisecting
it in the three dimensions, then the surface area becomes 8 × 6 × (1/2 × 1/2) or 12 units.
If it is trisected into a Rubik’s Cube, the surface becomes 27 × 6 × (1/3 × 1/3) or18 units
(Figure 20.1).
The surface area is key for a simple mass transfer operation like melting or freezing. From
Eq. (3.1),
Rate = Rate coefficient × zone of action × driving force
In this case, the “zone of action” is the particle surface. Hence, for change of phase and for any
interphase transfer where there is negligible other resistance in series with the surface resistance,
the rate of the process doubles when the solid is divided weight-wise by a factor of 8, and it triples
when the division is 27. However, if significant resistance to transfer also resides within the zone
in question or within the surrounding milieu, then the benefits of comminution are not as great:
see the example in Figure 3.2.
Comminution, which is brought about by mechanical means such as milling, requires energy
typically proportional to the new surface area produced. There are several theories to predict the
energy as a function of subdivision and of hardness and friability of the material. A comparative
review of these methods is found in the paper by Hukki (1961).
Polymers are often cast into pellet form and may require further modification such as control
of moisture or of solvent content, for further polymerization. Smaller pellets are generally an
advantage and are achieved by adjusting the extrusion and cutting of the molten polymer.
Potential for process intensification is moderate because of transfer resistance within the
pellets.
High-speed mixing and agitation of liquid–liquid or liquid–vapor mixtures can, in many cases,
produce major increases in process capacity. Chapter 16 presented the procedure for agitator
selection and speed for three mixing situations:
● blending of liquids,
● suspension of solid particles, and
● dispersion of gas phase in liquid.
These calculations produce the desired momentum behavior. With that aspect satisfied, it may
be possible, by enhancing agitator design and speed, to increase heat and mass transfer, which are
beneficial in themselves and which may have a direct effect on the rate of any reaction.
References on the effect of mixing on reaction rate and selectivity are Czerlinski et al. (2003) and
Shah et al. (2012B).20.2 Enhanced Energy 361
Chapter 16 also describes in-line static mixing whereby a flow of disparate liquids is continually
broken into mixed separate streams(i.e. comminuted),rotated, and then re-combined. The result of
a cycle is to disperse the liquids more finely into each other. A succession of these cycles makes the
dispersion finer and finer. Reaction between components may be speeded up, the benefit depending
on how fast the chemical rate compares with the rate of physical mixing. One application would be
to replace a continuously stirred reactor with a pipeline fitted internally with mixers. This would
replace a back-mixed unit with a close-to-plug-flow unit. Heating of the pipe would be simple,
especially if it were shaped into a coil and contained inside a shell (Myers et al. 2018).
20.2 Enhanced Energy
The vast majority of chemical engineering processes operate at a temperature other than, and
usually higher than, ambient. Heat must be provided to raise the temperature, as well as to
support evaporative phase change. In a small fraction of cases, the heat is provided electrically
or sometimes the heat of reaction is sufficient. However, in the large majority, the source is
conduction and convection from a hot heat-transfer fluid (liquid or vapor). This is the “heavy
duty” mode of providing energy, and it will likely continue to be so. The burning of the fuel to
heat the heat-transfer fluid imposes a contribution to atmospheric greenhouse gases, which can
sometimes be reduced by judicious design of a heat transfer network (HEN). For instance, the hot
effluent from a process step can cool itself down by transferring its heat to an incoming stream.
Provision of effective HENs anywhere in a process qualifies as Process Intensification.
In this section, we look at some “niche” sources of energy. In a specific geometrical situation,
they may add to or replace the usual mode of heat supply, but this does not generally qualify as an
intensification. Of greater interest is that these sources may affect the process in ways that direct
thermal heating cannot. Three of these sources are examined here: ultrasound, microwaves, and
ultraviolet radiation. They are reviewed in Stankiewicz (2007).
20.2.1 Ultrasound
Sound (and ultrasound) is a mechanical phenomenon, as opposed to electromagnetic phenomena
such as microwaves and ultraviolet waves. Ultrasound applications in chemistry comprise waves
of typical frequency 20–50 kHz, although much higher frequencies have been reported. The lower
limit sets it just above human hearing. The actual frequency is generally not important. The
corresponding wavelengths are set by dividing the speed of sound (in water it is 1481 m s−1) by the
frequency: at 20 kHz 0.74 m and at 50 kHz 0.30 m. The technique is applicable to liquids and to
liquid–solid mixtures. A pure liquid is susceptible only to ultrasounds of impractical power, but
any admixture of liquid or solid reduces required power greatly.
Sound waves consist of a sequence of high and low pressure, generated by the pulsing of an
electrically stimulated crystal – the piezoelectrical effect. With a high enough amplitude, the
mechanism is for the low-pressure swings of the sound cycle to generate mini cavities in the
liquid, which then collapse and produce large localized thermal energy input and agitation into
the mixture. Several cycles may be needed to build a cavity before it collapses. The benefits can be
● bringing reactants into more intimate contact, emulsification,
● breaking up agglomerates,
● speeding up phase change, e.g., dissolution of solids, mass transfer of a component,362 20 Process Intensification and Integration
● continually renewing the surface of a catalyst or solid reactant,
● momentarily creating free radicals, and
● enhancing heat transfer.
Some experiences with ultrasound are reported:
● by Wierschem et al. (2017A), a 50% increase in rate for one form of ethyl butyrate production,
● by Sarnaik & Gogate (2019), a 23% increase in the rate of sunflower hydrogenation,
● by Suslick (1989), a reduction in required temperature for cracking of crude oil, from 500 ∘C to
room temperature, and
● by Gogate et al. (2002), beneficial use of ultrasound in combination with other agents or with
electromagnetic waves.
20.2.2 Microwaves
A microwave is an electromagnetic wave (generated by a magnetron) in the frequency range
3–30 MHz. It interacts with three types of material:
(1) transparent, through which it simply passes unchanged. Nonmetals and nonpolar substances
like many polymers are in this class,
(2) reflective, mainly metals, of which the mobile electrons at the surface cause the waves to
bounce off in different directions, and
(3) absorbent – polar substances such as water.
The third type is most interesting, because microwaves excite molecular motion, causing the
creation of thermal energy and other effects on mass transfer and chemical reaction.
As in domestic use, microwaves are often used simply for thermal heating. A particular
geometry may lend itself to this type of heating rather than to hot-fluid or direct electrical
heating. Microwaves are extensively used in the drying of food, where they are competitive with
and/or have advantages over other methods of drying. Wang et al. (2015) have studied the energy
efficiency of microwave heating and have concluded that it never exceeds 80%. Other estimates
are closer to 50%, which could be compared with other systems. It is not low enough to keep this
type of heating from significant use.
The energy of this relatively low-frequency radiation is not high enough to break most chemical
bonds, but it can augment other methods and produce some of the following benefits:
● reaction rate acceleration,
● milder reaction conditions,
● higher chemical yield,
● lower energy usage, and
● different reaction selectivities.
The components in a mixture of immiscible liquids may have different susceptibilities to
microwaves and will heat up differently. The difference between temperatures can accelerate any
extraction of a compound from one fluid to the other.
A solid heterogeneous metal catalysis can attain higher than ambient temperature and become
more effective.
Some references are
● Wang et al. (2015) factors affecting energy efficiency of microwave heating,
● Kappe et al. (2012) other-than-thermal effects in microwave reaction chemistry, and
● Diaz-Ortiz et al. (2019) computer study of microwaves on reaction chemistry.20.2 Enhanced Energy 363
20.2.3 Ultraviolet Radiation
It was seen that the primary effect and usage of microwaves are in their ability to convert into
thermal energy. With regard to reaction chemistry, microwaves act by adding heat; there may be
other, more direct, effects, but they are not well recognized and play little role in technology.
The facts are different for ultraviolet waves, as the calculation below shows.
Figure 20.2 shows part of the electromagnetic spectrum, including the region of the microwaves
that have just been discussed. The frequency and the wavelengths are on the two scales and they
are related to each other by the relation
Frequency × wavelength = speed of light, approx. 3 × 108 m s−1 (20.1)
This relation may be checked by comparing any pair of corresponding numbers in Figure 20.2.
An electromagnetic wave has an energy which is called the photon, which is pure energy and has
no rest mass. The energy of a photon is given by
Energy (J) = Planck’s constant (J s) × speed of light (m s−1
)∕wavelength (m)
= 6.626 × 10−34 × 3 × 108
∕wavelength
= 2.2 × 10−26∕wavelength (20.2)
The low-frequency boundary of the ultraviolet zone has a wavelength of 4 × 10−7 m, therefore
from Eq. (20.2) its photons have energy 0.55 × 10−19 J. The high frequency boundary at the top of
the zone has a wavelength of 1 × 10−8, giving the photons an energy of 22 × 10−19 J.
A bond in a chemical compound has an energy associated with it, namely the energy that would
be required to pull the bond apart. A typical energy is for the carbon–carbon bond, 348 kJ mol−1.
The energy per bond itself is obtained by dividing by Avogadro’s number, 6.023 × 10+23, giving
57 × 10−23 kJ or 5.7 × 10−19 J.
The energies may be compared. 5.7 lies between the lower and upper bounds of 0.55 and 22.
It is evident that a low-frequency UV wave (and any waves with still lower frequencies, like

visual light and microwaves) is unable to disrupt the carbon–carbon connection. However, at the
high-frequency end, it is a possibility, and this action is what constitutesthe field of Photochemistry.
Not all chemical bonds are as strong as the C—C bond, so waves with somewhat lesser energy
may interact with them. There is a wide variety of reactions that can be photocatalyzed, including
● addition to an unsaturated molecule,
● addition of unsaturated molecules to each other,
● splitting off of molecular fragments,
● oxidation,
● hydration,
● cis-trans isomerization,
● rearrangement, and
● intermolecular electron transfer.
There are some reactions that cannot be done by thermal stimulation alone.
A review of the field is given by Glusac (2016).
In combination with transition-metal catalysis, the range of photocatalysis can extend into the
visible range – see Schultz & Yoon (2014).
Photocatalysis is used in the purification of water – see Laroussi et al. (2002).
Bremus-Kobberling et al. (2012) used a laser as a source of light and compared the speed of a
reaction with catalysis by a conventional xenon lamp. Time was reduced from hours to minutes,
and better selectivity was obtained.
A difficulty with photochemistry is conveying the energy-containing wave to its target, which
prompts research into suitable forms of reactors.
20.3 Solvent Development
Solvents are a ubiquitous liquid component in chemical processing. In chemical reactions, they
may act by bringing the reactive components into a single phase, where contact is at the molecular
level.In the process of extraction, they provide a welcoming phase into which the extracted material
is transferred.
The least expensive and safest solvent is water. Being polar itself, it is effective with polar solutes.
Unfortunately, it does not dissolve a large majority of organic compounds. Other common solvents
such as methanol, benzene and toluene are generally used.
The traditional solvents, including water, are volatile enough at process temperatures that
pressure is required. Subsequent to the process step, the solvent must be separated from its solute,
generally requiring an energy-consuming operation and a concomitant loss of a small fraction to
the environment.
A Process Intensification objective would be to eliminate some of the disadvantages of current
solvents. Much of the work on this goal is centered around the concept ofIonic Liquids. We examine
this topic, as well as related ones of Deep Extraction Solvents and Switchable Solvents.
20.3.1 Ionic Liquids
Ionic liquids are organic salts and, more specifically, organic salts with a melting point below
100 ∘C. Figure 20.3 shows examples of some popular cations and anions of such salts. There are
a multiplicity of cations and anions: these variations include the many functional groups that can
constitute part of the cations and which affect the nature of the particular liquid.20.3 Solvent Development 365

Many of these materials turn out to be good solvents, for both polar and nonpolar substances. A
major advantage is their very low volatility, thus eliminating the major problem of current solvents
mentioned above. Brennecke & Maginn (2001) provide one of the earliest general discussions of
ionic liquids in chemical processes. They list seven possible applications:
● replacing common solvents for reactions, with no loss in rates and selectivities,
● gas separations (including CO2 capture),
● liquid separations,
● solvents for cleaning,
● electrolytic liquids in batteries and fuel cells,
● lubricants, and
● heat transfer fluids.
For a brief history of ionic liquids, consult Welton (2018). For a well-balanced consideration of the
benefits of ionic liquids, see Jessop (2018) who cautioned that the complete life cycle of the solvent
needs to be studied. Such a study includes the cost and environmental effects of manufacturing
the ionic liquid, as well as the process, parallel to the main process, of separating, recovering, and
reusing the solvent.
20.3.2 Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs)
These solvents are often considered as part of the ionic liquid family, but they have some important
differences and applications. They are formed by the interaction of a quaternary ammonium salt
(see Choline chloride in Figure 20.4) and either a metal hydrate or a hydrogen-bond donor (see
Urea in Figure 20.4). The ratio is widely adjustable.
The term “eutectic” is very apt, as shown by the dramatic lowering of the following melting
points:
Choline chloride melting point 302 ∘C
Urea melting point 133 ∘C
1 : 2 mole ratio ChCl/urea melting point 12 ∘C

+366 20 Process Intensification and Integration
Some DESs can stay liquid down to still lesser temperatures. The whole concept of this type of
solvent is the fact that they stay liquid at these temperatures.
Like fellow ionic liquids, the DESs have very low vapor pressures and are therefore
non-flammable. They have the disadvantage of high viscosity. Relative to other ionic liquids,
the DESs have the advantage of components of low cost and low toxicity: the popular choline
chloride is often part of feeds for animals. As with ionic liquids in general, the DESs can comprise
a large variety of components and, unlike other liquids, the ratio can vary because the components
are not fixed into ionic bonds with each other.
Smith et al. (2014) provided authoritative discussions of DESs. With regard to applications,
their paper focused mainly on metal finishing, but also spoke of several successful examples of
use in chemical synthesis, in biotransformations, and in the purification and manufacturing of
biodiesel.
20.3.3 Carbon Dioxide-Switchable Solvents
A disadvantage with a low-volatility ionic solvent isitsinability – at the end of a processstep – to be
separated by vaporization from the processstream. It would be advantageousto effectsome change
in its nature to make it less-of-a solvent at this point. That is, to make it “switch”. Various switch
agencies are possible – temperature, pressure, addition of strong acid or base – but they are either
ineffective or permanently change the solvent. The idealreagent turns out to be carbon dioxide. For
certain organic liquids, sparging with CO2 converts the material into a polar form. Subsequently,
if the CO2 is removed (again by sparging, but with an inert gas), the liquid reverts to a nonpolar
form. This technology of the switching of a single solvent benefits from the fact that carbon dioxide
is cheap, nontoxic, noncorrosive, and abundant.
Many ionic-liquid solvents that are susceptible to this treatment have been identified over
the years. Cunningham & Jessop (2019) tell us that most switchable solvents are neutral
nitrogen-containing compounds, some of which are shown in Figure 20.5.
The switching is usually done in the presence of water or another proton-supplying species, as
shown in Figure 20.6. Forliquidsthat contain N—H bonds, the water may be dispensed with. Weak
organic acids may also be switchable.

Figure 20.7 Two paths for switchable solvent.
The suitability of a candidate depends on whether the addition or deletion of CO2 makes a
significant change in polarity. Jessop (2013) identified three different categories of switchable
solvents:
● switchable-polarity solvents (SPSs), which were described above,
● switchable-hydrophilicity solvents (SHSs), where the switch is between miscibility and immisci￾bility in water, and
● switchable water (SW), where the aqueous solution of a polyamine with low ionic strength has
the ability to dissolve organic compounds, but with its ionic strength increased by addition of
CO2 it separates from the organics.
Figure 20.7 illustrates how a switchable solvent could work with a process, acting as a normal
solvent in the reaction (orliquid–liquid extraction), then separating itself, and recycling back to the
start of the process.
20.4 Novel Reactors
The essential qualities of a reactor are:
● uniformity of product, at least to the extent that is required in downstream usage or in further
processing,
● management of temperature, whether heat must be added or must be removed, and
● mass transfer of components, to bring them into proximity to each other or to a catalyst for
reaction.368 20 Process Intensification and Integration
For solid-catalyzed reactions, Moulijn et al. (2003) recommended the use of a structured design
instead ofrandom packing. Random packing often resultsin uneven fluid flow and inactivity at ves￾sel walls.Instead, the catalystshould be shaped into three-dimensional (“monoliths”) that promote
good contact with reactants and which promote plug, radially uniform flow. The Sulzer Chemtech
company market their Katapak-SP structure: elements for vertical flow that have alternative ver￾tical layers of catalyst separated by a layer of mesh or packing that ensures good contact with the
catalyst. These improvements are logical steps in the drive for process intensification.
For continuous flow, the alternate extremes are a reactor that is fully back-mixed and a reactor
that operates in plug-flow. Since the latter alternative considerably economizes on reaction vol￾ume, there is always some consideration given to converting a back-mixed reactor into a plug-flow
configuration. Consider the following case:
● a back-mixed reactor of hold-up time 10 minutes (M/F),
● a through-flow of 5000 kg h−1 or 83.3 kg min−1 (F),
● entering concentration of reactant: 1.0 units per kilogram ([AI]), and
● in situ and exit concentration of reactant: 0.05 ([A]).
The steady-state mass balance on A is
d[A]∕d(time) = 0 = F [AI] − F [A] − k M [A] = 83.3 × 1.0 − 83.3 × 0.05 − k (10 × 83.3) × 0.05
from which the rate constant, k, is inferred as 1.9 min−1.
If the same analysis is applied to a plug-flow version, using k as 1.9, the steady-state mass
balance is
F [A] − F ([A] + Δ[A]) − k ΔM [A] = 0
∫ d[A]∕[A]1.0 to 0.05 = −k M∕F
from which M is calculated as 132 kg. This compares with 833 kg for the mixed reactor.
While this 84% reduction in hold-up mass is a great objective, the implementation is not as
impressive. Considering the density of fluid to be 1000 kg m−3, the mixed reactor occupies 0.833 m3.
Considering the plug flow reactor, choosing a 0.05 m internal diameter pipe (5 cm), a length of 68 m
isrequired. The likeliest plug flow configuration isfor 10 lengths of 7-meter-long pipe sections, each
section doubling back on the previous one and the whole reactor encased in a heated shell – about
0.25 m in diameter. The whole assembly occupies about 0.5 m3, just a 40% reduction from the mixed
reactor.
However, the plug-flow system has other benefits:
● less residence time for undesirable side reactions to occur,
● no un-mixed stagnant zones,
● powered by a pump rather than a more complicated agitator, and
● possibly adding other components at different points along the flow.
For smaller scale operations, some other plug-flow configurations may be available. Consider
the above case but at 50 kg h−1, say, for a pilot-plant or for manufacture of a fine chemical. All con￾ditions of hold-up mass, entering and leaving concentrations, kinetic constant being the same, a
plug-flow reactor of 17 m of 1 cm internal diameter pipe would be suitable. Noble (2001) described
a reactor similar to a plate-and-frame heat exchanger proposed by the Heatric heat-exchanger
company. One-half of the pipe cross section is chemically milled onto the surface of plates, and
then the plates are stacked and joined to provide a path for fluid to flow along them and from one
plate to the next. Figure 20.8 shows the concept. The stack is encased in a heat-transfer jacket.20.5 Combined Operations 369

person, a respected engineer, and a role model for all. In Engineering and life, he was always
one to help others be better. His success and experience in bridging research and development
with engineering and the physical realities of a plant brought him the respect of everyone he
touched. Few people can bridge the gap between theory, differential equations, programming,
and the realities of a physical plant and have a humorous personality that people would always
want to hear and learn from. I had the fortunate timing to be a newly graduated engineer he
tutored, a colleague he taught professional development courses with and wrote chapters together,
a university lecturer with whom together we helped students prepare for the world outside the
university, the person who helped to publish his last contribution to the engineering world, and
finally an engineer who thrived under his guidance. If I have taken one thing to heart that he told
me, it was, “Never think you can’t learn something from someone who knows less about a subject
than you”. Those lasting words from a man so knowledgeable rang true many times in my career
dealing with engineers, designers, operators, business people, and students. I hope you will forgive370 20 Process Intensification and Integration
that this book ends with his last written words, “Combined Operations,” which seems appropriate
given Keith’s commitment to family and church, community service, his success in engineering,
and what I call his “saving the butts of engineers everywhere.” I think he will be happy you have
read this book and learned something from someone who knows less about a subject than you.
